Reagan won't quit
WASHlNGTON—Campaigners for
Ronald Reagan called a press conference
yesterday to dispel reports that some
members of the Reagan camp have al
ready given up on his chances to win the
Republican presidential nomination.
Reagan campaign manager John Sears
claimed that Reagan already had 10 more
delegates than he needed to beat Presi
dent Gerald Ford for the nomination.
Most current polls show the former
California governor trailing Ford by
about 40 delegates, however, and a Ford
aided termed Sears' statement
"baloney." Ford continued to predict a
first-ballot victory for himself.
Kidnap arrest close?
CHOWCHII.LA—PoIice yesterday
found clothing belonging to the kidnap
ped Chowchilla bus driver in the Santa
Cruz mountains and said they were near
ing arrests of two kidnaping suspects.
The clothing belonged to Frank Rav.
the school-bus driver who was abducted
along with 2b children last Thursday.
The clothing, together with Ray's volun
teer tire department card, was found near
Saratoga, about 50 miles southwest of the
spot where Ray and the children pried
their way out of an underground prison
Friday night.
Lebanon evacuation off
BEIRUT —Conditions in Lebanon de
teriorated so rapidly yesterday that the

U.S. embassy decided to put off a plan
ned evacuation originally set for today.
Officials say they may try again later in
the week.
The latest escalation of the fighting
came after Syria rushed reinforcements
into battle against leftist positions north
and south of the capital city.
Earlier yesterday. 430 foreigners had
signed up for the U.S.-sponsored evacua
tion. At least 180 Americans were on the
list. But apparently U.S. officials thought
that the plan, which called for rival
Palestinian and Syrian forces to provide
security, was not sufficiently safe to
carry out the evacuation as scheduled.
More sex scandals
WASHINGTON—Ohio Rep. Wayne
Hays returned to the capital yesterday for
the first time since his sleeping-pill
overdose, and the investigation into
charges that he put his mistress on the
federal payroll continued in the midst of
other Congressional sex scandals.
In Salt Lake City. Utah Congressman
Allan Hobe, a leader of the Mormon
Church, went on trial yesterday on
charges of trying to buy prostitutes in the
city's red-light district. The judge in the
case says that the jury will be sequestered
due to the nature of the case.
And the Washington Post reported

yesterday that California Congressman
Robert Legget left classified information
unattended in his car while he was hav
ing an affair with a secretary of House
Speaker Carl Albert. Legget had no
comment.
Mars landing set
PASADENA—America's Viking One
spacecraft was set to attempt a risky land
ing on Mars this morning to conduct the
first search for life on another planet.
"Everything is go." declared mission
director Thomas Young last night. "We
find ourselves in very good condition."
The lander must perform with split
second accuracy todescendfrom an orbit
11,400 miles high to the surface of a
planet that mysteriously destroyed two
Soviet spacecraft as they landed in 1971
and 1973.
Olympic results
MONTREAL —American swimmers
Bruce Furniss and John Naber each
broke world records yesterday to win
gold medals in two Olympic races.
Furniss bettered his own mark in the
200-meter freestyle to key a U.S. sweep
in the event. Teammates Naber and Jim
Montgomery fished second and third.
Naber's time of 55.49 seconds set a

world mark in the 100-meter backstroke,
where he beat out teammate Pete Rocca
and long-time world champion Roland
Matthes of East Germany to win the gold
medal.
East German women scored a one
two-three sweep in the 200-meter but
terfly event.

be ejected from the games when it was
discovered that he had illegally wired
his fencing sword.

Reagan won't quit
WASHlNGTON—Campaigners for
Ronald Reagan called a press conference
yesterday to dispel reports that some
members of the Reagan camp have al
ready given up on his chances to win the
Republican presidential nomination.
Reagan campaign manager John Sears
claimed that Reagan already had 10 more
delegates than he needed to beat Presi
dent Gerald Ford for the nomination.
Most current polls show the former
California governor trailing Ford by
about 40 delegates, however, and a Ford
aided termed Sears' statement
"baloney." Ford continued to predict a
first-ballot victory for himself.
Kidnap arrest close?
CHOWCHII.LA—PoIice yesterday
found clothing belonging to the kidnap

The clothing belonged to Frank Rav.
the school-bus driver who was abducted
along with 2b children last Thursday.
The clothing, together with Ray's volun
teer tire department card, was found near

Lebanon evacuation off
BEIRUT —Conditions in Lebanon de
teriorated so rapidly yesterday that the

U.S. embassy decided to put off a plan

Officials say they may try again later in

The latest escalation of the fighting
came after Syria rushed reinforcements
into battle against leftist positions north
and south of the capital city.
Earlier yesterday. 430 foreigners had
signed up for the U.S.-sponsored evacua

list. But apparently U.S. officials thought
that the plan, which called for rival
Palestinian and Syrian forces to provide
security, was not sufficiently safe to
carry out the evacuation as scheduled.
