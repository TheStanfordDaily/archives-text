# Recycling program started

### Bill Wien 
Alpha Place, a non-profit or
ganization devoted to the estab
lishment of residential and re
habilitation programs for the se
verely handicapped, has set up
an extensive recycling operation
on the Stanford campus.
Drums painted light-blue and
stenciled for identification have
been placed near soft drink
machines at residences like
Branner, Crothers, Stern, Toyon
and Wilbur Halls; in laundry
rooms in Mirrielees Apartments
and Abrams, Barnes, Blackwel
der and McFarland Apartments
in Escondido Village; and the
laundry room at Manzanita Park.
These drums are for the recycl
ing of aluminum cans only.
For magzines, telephone
books, and newspapers, Alpha
Place has stationed a large blue
van on Pampas Lane beyond the
Stanford Credit Union. Paper
should be bundled for conve
nient handling, according to
H.R. Sawyer, director of recycl
ing operations for Alpha Place.
Glass containers and bi-metal
cans may also be brought to this

location.
In addition to providing the
severely handicapped with habi
tation and attendants, the or
ganization seeks to establish a
collection of books and provide
recreational services, according
to Stacie Davidson, a graduate
student involved in recycling.
"The general purpose of this
recycling operation," stated
Davidson, "is to further the effort

by Alpha toward attaining an
independent mode of life for its
handicapped participants by re
ducing and, if possible,
eliminating the need for solicit
ing donations for Alpha's many
activities."
More recycling drums are av
ailable, and anyone desiring in
formation about obtaining one
may call Alpha Place Recycling
at 328-5535.
