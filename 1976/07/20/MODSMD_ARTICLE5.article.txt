# Halt new Dumbarton Bridge

Sierra Club

On June 29, 1976, the Senate
passed the Holmdahl Bill,
5C1975. This bill eliminates the
right of cities to have a say, that
is to accept or veto, the proposed
approach roads (from the prop
osed new bridge) that enter their
communities. The bill now goes
to the Assembly Transportation
Committee on August 4, 1976.
If the Holmdahl bill passes the
Assembly, the new Dumbarton
Bridge is inevitable. We urge
you to write letters to members
of the Assembly, members of the
Transportation Committee,
Governor Brown, the U.S. Coast

Guard, the State Lands Commis
sion and the Corps of Engineers.
These last three agencies each
grant permits for the new bridge
and approach roads. Write to
day!
The proposed new Dumbarton
Bridge has a 10 year history. The
first proposals for it were drawn
up by the Toll Bridge Authority
in 1966. Funds were approp
riated for the study, but legisla
tive authority for the construc
tion of a new bridge did not
occur until 1972.
In 1972. two new bridges were
under consideration — a new

Dumbarton Bridge and the
Southern Crossing. Under gen
eral referendum in nine Bay
Area counties on June 6, 1972,
voters overwhelmingly defeated
Proposition A, killing the prop
osed Southern Crossing. Since
this defeat eliminated the main
justification for the existence of
the Division of Bay Toll Cros
sings, theagencyput tremendous
pressure on the legislators to au
thorize the construction of a new
Dumbarton Bridge — a new jus
tification for their existence.
Within two months of the de
feat of the Southern Crossing,
despite this overt expression by
the voters of their opposition to
any new constructions across
our Bay, the legislature signed
bills authorizing the new Dum
barton Bridge.
The proposed four approach
roads, four-lane roads on the east
side of Highway 101. would pass
over the freeway and dump traf
fic onto the already heavily con
gested Marsh Road, Willow
Road, University Avenue and
Embarcadero Road. The City of
Palo Alto exercised its veto
power over Embarcadero Road,
and has a lawsuit pending over
University Avenue approach.
There are many effects of and
problems with a new bridge
which you can cite in your op
position.

(1) A new bridge would in
crease traffic congestion in the
Bay Area. It would encourage
more commuting in individual
automobiles.
(2) The new bridgewouldbe of
most benefit to only 5000 com
muters from the East Bay who
come to the West Bay in the
morning and return at night.
(3) The original cost estimates
for a new bridge, the four ap
proach roads, new interchange
improvement at 101, some im
provement to Willow Road, and
a new storm drainage system for
East Palo Alto, for 1970 was
$26,700,000.
The escalated cost estimate in
1974 was $93,700,000.
Now the cost is approximated
at $100 million.
(4) At this cost, the service of a
new Dumbarton Bridge for the
5000 major users would be an
effective subsidy to them of
$20,000 each! If the users were to
pay all the costs, it would mean a
trip fee of over $5 each way!
If this money were used for
public transit instead, combined
with matching federal funds, it
would make nearly a half billion
dollars available for public
transit in the Bay Area.
