## McCloskey's wiles 
### 
Jack Moran

Has Rep. Pete McCloskey's
"Stanford Strategy" become ob
solete? McCloskey, who repre
sents the 12th Congressional
District which includes Stan
ford, denies he ever had such a
strategy. But students who were
here in 1974 remember diffe
rently.
In the Republican primary that
year. McCloskey faced conserva
tive Cordon Knapp. McCloskey

won by a slim margin — after he
had directed a massive effort to
get students here to reregister as
Republicans so they could vote
for him.
Perhaps it's no coincidence
that McCloskey ran unopposed
for his party's nomination this
year. The popular Knapp has
gone to work for the Defense De
partment — with McCloskey's
blessing.
And after preening his anti
war, anti-Nixon image to woo
Stanford students in 1974, Pete
quickly and easily became just
one of Gerald Ford's crowd.
McCloskey's lucky he didn't
need Stanford this year. It's
doubtful that many students
would have changed their re
gistration this year, when David
Harris was fighting for the
Democratic nomination.
McCloskey's anti-war record,
his sole strong suit as far as Stan
ford students are concerned,
pales in comparison to that of
Harris, a bona fide opponent of
the war from early on.
But Pete has no cause to be
worried. Few students realize
that the Republican nominee is a
virtual shoo-in in this largely
Republican, conservative sub
urban district. So once again
McCloskey will tread the com
fortable middle of the road, and
the only people who'll be footing
the bill are the students who won
it all for him just two years ago.
