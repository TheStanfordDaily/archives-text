# INTO THE DRINK
## 
### 
It was a hot day out by the
pools yesterday, and a thirsty
(and rather tame)scrub jay
was attracted by the big blue
bird baths.
His mother apparently
never told him that jays can't
swim, because after he failed
in this position, he hopped
right in for his sip of water.
After drinking his fill, he
fluttered back out and sat on
the nearest towel, drying
himself in the sun.
The bird was last seen
pecking away at his reflec
tion in the lenses of some
one's sunglasses.
