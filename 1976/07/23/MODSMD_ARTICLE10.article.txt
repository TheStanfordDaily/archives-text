# Lyman ponders; six Delts in limbo
## 
### 
President Richard Lyman has
heard the individual appeals of
each of the six students involved
in the Delta Tail Delta trashing
incidents of May 19. but has not
decided what punitive action
will be taken.
"I genuinely don't know when
mv decision will be reached, -
Lyman said yesterday, "because
I haven't made up my mind, and
when l do I'll have to write it
up."
The Stanford Judicial Council

(SJC) recommended two-quarter
suspensions for four of the stu
dents, a three-quarter suspen
sion for a fifth student — and a
one-quarter suspension for the
sixth Delt member.
Despite the official recom
mendations by the SJC. Lyman
can take anv action he desires.
The six students are Cary An
derson. Todd Anderson, Mark
Mill. George Scha'der. Rich Wat
ers and Mike Wilkinson.
