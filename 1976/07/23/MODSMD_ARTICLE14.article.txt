LOTS OF ROCKS—This photograph, one of the first returned from Mars by Viking I, doesn't look very
impressive in this re-re-re-re-reproduction. But scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who were
looking at an original, said that the clarity and resolution were beyond their highest expectations.
Later photographs have shown that the red planet is indeed red. and that the Martian sky is tinted
pink by dust suspended in the atmosphere.
