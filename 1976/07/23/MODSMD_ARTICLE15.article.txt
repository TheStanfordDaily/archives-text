# Bug Me

### Patty Fels 
I am interested in owning a fierce attack dog, and
was considering a baby wolf. However, I suspect
that a wolf puppy would be somewhat hard to
find and that it might be illegal. In that case I
ivould like to find some sort of wolf crossbreed.
Can you help me?-F.B.
You're barking up the wrong tree, according to
Marilyn Manolio, secretary to the director of the
San Francisco Zoo.
Wolves, contrary to popular belief, are not in
the least fierce but "very shy, submissive and fear
ful" in strange situations, especially around hu
mans, Manolio said.
"In a stress situation, wolves will often end up
being just quivering masses of terror," Manolio
said. "What a wolf tends to do in the face of man is
hide."
And a crossbreed between wolf and dog is even
worse, according to Manolio. These can become
"spooky, shy, dangerous animals" which tend to
"fear bite." An animal which "fear bites" gives no
warning signals (such as growling) to ward away
trespassers but lunges at them unexpectedly.
Manolio said that there are no documented
cases of wolves spontaneously attacking humans
in North America although there are occasional
European horror stories (An example is Saki's
short story "The Interlopers" in which two young
nobles from feuding families finally make up after
being trapped together under a fallen tree. As they
confidently wait to be rescued, they hear a rustl
ing panting noise, whereupon one screams
" W
olves!", obviously not the aforementioned
"quivering masses of terror.") However, some of
these have later been proven to be formerly
domesticated dogs which after returning to the
wild became very dangerous because, unlike
wolves, they no longer are afraid of humans.
"What you want is a trainable, controllable
animal . . . onethat's capableof being called off as
well as set on." Manolio said. "A rabid wolf might
attack a human being but then a rabid skunk prob
ably would too."
However, vou were right about the illegalitv of

owning a wolf. Private citizens are forbidden to
own certain "exotic animals," including wolves,
without a special license.
Although you can't have a wolf in the fur. you
can bring their voices into your home on a record
called The Language and Music of Wolves, in
cluding the most-requested "The Wolf You Never
Knew," narrated by Robert Redford. Or try read
ing The Wolf: the ecology and behavior of an
endangered species by David Mech.
If you still want a watchdog, and aren't particu
larly intrigued with the idea of a pert rabid skunk
frisking around the house, you might try contact
ing someone who trains attack dogs.
1 heard today, during a session ivith a personnel
representative discussing employer benefits, that
Stanford Medical Center staff have a dental care
plan in addition to the various health care plans
in which the University participates. Staff and
faculty on the rest of the campus, however, are
offered only the health plan - no dentistry.
Why?-O.N.
Gioia Munks, employee benefits supervisor,
said that the University offers other benefits to its
employees which offset the lack of a dental plan.
These include free long-term disability insurance
and the tuition grants to children of University
staff members, neither of which the medical
renter offers its employees.

1 heard today, during a session ivith a personnel
representative discussing employer benefits, that
Stanford Medical Center staff have a dental care
plan in addition to the various health care plans
in which the University participates. Staff and
faculty on the rest of the campus, however, are
offered only the health plan - no dentistry.
Why?-O.N.
Gioia Munks, employee benefits supervisor,
said that the University offers other benefits to its
employees which offset the lack of a dental plan.
These include free long-term disability insurance
and the tuition grants to children of University
staff members, neither of which the medical
renter offers its employees.


I am interested in owning a fierce attack dog, and
was considering a baby wolf. However, I suspect
that a wolf puppy would be somewhat hard to
find and that it might be illegal. In that case I
ivould like to find some sort of wolf crossbreed.
Can you help me?-F.B.
You're barking up the wrong tree, according to
Marilyn Manolio, secretary to the director of the
San Francisco Zoo.
Wolves, contrary to popular belief, are not in
the least fierce but "very shy, submissive and fear
ful" in strange situations, especially around hu
mans, Manolio said.
"In a stress situation, wolves will often end up
being just quivering masses of terror," Manolio
said. "What a wolf tends to do in the face of man is
hide."
And a crossbreed between wolf and dog is even
worse, according to Manolio. These can become
"spooky, shy, dangerous animals" which tend to
"fear bite." An animal which "fear bites" gives no
warning signals (such as growling) to ward away
trespassers but lunges at them unexpectedly.
Manolio said that there are no documented
cases of wolves spontaneously attacking humans
in North America although there are occasional
European horror stories (An example is Saki's
short story "The Interlopers" in which two young
nobles from feuding families finally make up after
being trapped together under a fallen tree. As they
confidently wait to be rescued, they hear a rustl
ing panting noise, whereupon one screams
" W
olves!", obviously not the aforementioned
"quivering masses of terror.") However, some of
these have later been proven to be formerly
domesticated dogs which after returning to the
wild became very dangerous because, unlike
wolves, they no longer are afraid of humans.
"What you want is a trainable, controllable
animal . . . onethat's capableof being called off as
well as set on." Manolio said. "A rabid wolf might
attack a human being but then a rabid skunk prob
ably would too."
However, vou were right about the illegalitv of

owning a wolf. Private citizens are forbidden to
own certain "exotic animals," including wolves,
without a special license.
Although you can't have a wolf in the fur. you
can bring their voices into your home on a record
called The Language and Music of Wolves, in
cluding the most-requested "The Wolf You Never
Knew," narrated by Robert Redford. Or try read
ing The Wolf: the ecology and behavior of an
endangered species by David Mech.
If you still want a watchdog, and aren't particu
larly intrigued with the idea of a pert rabid skunk
frisking around the house, you might try contact
ing someone who trains attack dogs.
