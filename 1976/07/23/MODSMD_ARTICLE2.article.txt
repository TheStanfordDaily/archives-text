# USE president resigns
## 
### Dave Ansley 
Jim Berk resigned yesterday as
president of United Stanford
Employees (USE), citing an ina
bility to "function effectively" in
his responsibilities as his reason
for quitting. He said his decision
was "irrevocable."
Before resigning, the controv
ersial union official appointed
Bill Reynolds, assistant presi
dent, to take over leadership
duties temporarily. A new pres
ident will be selected by the un
ion's executive committee next
week.
In a letter to that committee,
Berk asked that he be kept on as a
union staff member, since that is
his only job. However, he res
igned his position on the USE
negotiating team.
Contract talks
The union, which represents
1350 technical, maintenance
and service employes, began
contract talks with the Univer
sity Tuesday. The current con
tract expires Aug. 31.
Berk's replacement on the
negotiating team has not yet
been selected.
Berk refused to explain the
reasons for his action or for his
inability to effectively represent
USE, saying that he preferred to
discuss the matter with the
executive committee before
making a public statement.

However, Berk did say that his
decision was related to events
which occurred at a Wednesday
night meeting of the executive
committee. Berk had requested a
clarification of his duties as USE
president, but the committee
took no action on the issue.
Roger Hardy, USE reporter,
said that problems in relations

with USE office staff members
prompted Berk's request.
'No surprise'
Hardy said that Berk's resigna
tion was not a surprise to him.
"Although I didn't predict it,
it was deducible from the pres
sures that were building up," he
said. "My impression is that he
perceives that there is a signific
ant minority (within the union)
which feels very strongly that
he's not doing the most he can to
settle with management in ways
helpful to the union."
Although Hardy felt that
Berk's action would have little
effect on the current negotia
tions, he said it would
"strengthen the base of support"
the union would get from its
members.
He said that Berk, though "de
finitely the most conscientious
president that any union ever
had," had been unable to "con
vince people that the image (of
not doing his best) was false."
'Different' tone
Doug Barton, head of the Uni
versity negotiating team, said
that yesterday's contract meet
ing had "a very different tone"
from those conducted when
Berk was on the USE team.
"Certainly it's no secret," he
said, "that we found it somewhat
difficult to deal with Jim Berk."
Yesterday's meeting lasted

only about half an hour but Bar
ton called it "very positive" and
"very constructive."
The talks were adjourned to
allow the USE team to develop a
counterproposal to a University
plan for dealing with a backlog
of undecided employe grievance
cases.
Tuesday's opening session
dealt with "fairly insignificant
matters,"according to Hardy. He
said that the University and USE
reached a few agreements, none
of them of any substance, at that
meeting.
