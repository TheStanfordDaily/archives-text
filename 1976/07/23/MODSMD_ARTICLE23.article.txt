# Summer delights grace Ashland, Oregon
## A 						Shakespearean fairyland 
### Perry Simon 
If you have the urge to make
this summer a memorable one,
the Daily Entertainment De
partment heartily recommends
thuf you head north to Ashland,
Oregon. The following describes
the experience that aivaits you
there.
Afternoon shadows creep ac
ross this picturesque mountain
village, bringing relief from the
blistering summer sun. A short
hike and a skinny-dip in a sec
luded mountain stream earlier in
the afternoon have left our
bodies feeling warm, refreshed
and healthy. The tantalizing
scent of our pool-side barbecue
confirms how unusually clean
and fresh the Oregon mountain
air really is. Dinner is leisurely,
but time cannot be squandered.
A full evening lies ahead.
We amble down the town's
main street, cooled by a soft
mountain breeze. Flags, banners
and posters engulf the street, all
proclaiming the town's festival
atmosphere. The conversations
on every corner and in every
store revolve around the same
topic: the Festival. The entire
town is uniformly devoted to the
Festival both in body and soul.
We are engulfed by the Festival

spirit, and we can't help but join
the tide.
We pass by friendly-looking
taverns which, later tonight, will
overflow with Festival actors,
visitors and resident townsfolk
mingling together over pitchers
of Blitz-Weinhard. In the dis
tance we can see the tower of the
outdoor Elizabethan stage rise
above the trees.
As we pass into tranquil Lithia
Park which lies behind the
Elizabethan theatre, we come
upon a brace of ducks swimming
in a pond, displaying sheer in
difference to the Festival.
We start up the hill toward the
theatre. Light Renaissance
music floats down to us. dancing
on air. As we ascend a winding
set of brick steps, the gay timbre
of the tambourines turns our
walk into a light run. Finally, we
emerge onto the Festival square.
To one side of us lies the
ultra-modern Angus Bowmer
Indoor Theatre, an elegant glass
and concrete structure that
slopes gracefully down one end
of the square toward the park be
low. On our other side, the
Elizabethan stage, which is
fashioned after the Fortune
Theatre of Shakes-


THE PLAY'S THE THING. . .â€”Theatre designer Richard L. Hay, a graduate of Stanford, designed

and Alleyn-Peter Street contract for the Fortune Theatre of Shakespeare's London, 1599.
peare's London, towers
majestically over the square.
Thp reflection of the after
noon sun glimmers off its rich
brown wood.
An ivy-covered fence sur
rounds the audience pit that
slopes down to the foot of the
Tin* stage itself, with its
stately presence and intricate
design, seems to breathe
Shakespeare.
A small lawn above the au
dient e pit is packed with Fes
tival devotees watching
young dancers in Elizabethan
garb perform pavans. gal
liards and other dances of the
era. Rosy-cheeked maidens in
peasant dresses stroll through
the crowd selling plum
puddings to the anachronis
tii visitors. To the side of the
dancers, a troup of musicians
plays various Elizabethan
woodwind, brass and per
cussion instruments.
The music fills our ears: the
colorful garb and banners fill
our eyes. Shakespeare's Eng

land comes alive in our midst.
Suddenly, a trumpet call
rings out from above and all
heads turn upward toward
the stage tower. An elegantly
dressed herald doffs his
feathered hat to the spectators
below and signals that the
play is about to begin. The
crowd slowly descends from
the grassy knoll into the audi
ence pit to search for their
seats. It is 8:45. and from our
seats we can see the sun
slowly setting over the moun
tains surrounding the sec
luded town.
As the air begins to t hill,
we settle into our coveted
seats, wrap coats and blankets
around us and prepare to
enjoy an evening of some of
the finest Shakespearean
theatre offered anywhere in
the I nited States.
Summer has come to us. so
we have come to Ashland.
