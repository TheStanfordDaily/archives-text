# Summer delights grace Ashland, Oregon
## A Shakespearean fairyland
### Perry Simon 
If you have the urge to make
this summer a memorable one,
the Daily Entertainment De
partment heartily recommends
thuf you head north to Ashland,
Oregon. The following describes
the experience that aivaits you
there.
Afternoon shadows creep ac
ross this picturesque mountain
village, bringing relief from the
blistering summer sun. A short
hike and a skinny-dip in a sec
luded mountain stream earlier in
the afternoon have left our
bodies feeling warm, refreshed
and healthy. The tantalizing
scent of our pool-side barbecue
confirms how unusually clean
and fresh the Oregon mountain
air really is. Dinner is leisurely,
but time cannot be squandered.
A full evening lies ahead.
We amble down the town's
main street, cooled by a soft
mountain breeze. Flags, banners
and posters engulf the street, all
proclaiming the town's festival
atmosphere. The conversations
on every corner and in every
store revolve around the same
topic: the Festival. The entire
town is uniformly devoted to the
Festival both in body and soul.
We are engulfed by the Festival

spirit, and we can't help but join
the tide.
We pass by friendly-looking
taverns which, later tonight, will
overflow with Festival actors,
visitors and resident townsfolk
mingling together over pitchers
of Blitz-Weinhard. In the dis
tance we can see the tower of the
outdoor Elizabethan stage rise
above the trees.
As we pass into tranquil Lithia
Park which lies behind the
Elizabethan theatre, we come
upon a brace of ducks swimming
in a pond, displaying sheer in
difference to the Festival.
We start up the hill toward the
theatre. Light Renaissance
music floats down to us. dancing
on air. As we ascend a winding
set of brick steps, the gay timbre
of the tambourines turns our
walk into a light run. Finally, we
emerge onto the Festival square.
To one side of us lies the
ultra-modern Angus Bowmer
Indoor Theatre, an elegant glass
and concrete structure that
slopes gracefully down one end
of the square toward the park be
low. On our other side, the
Elizabethan stage, which is
fashioned after the Fortune
Theatre of Shakes-


THE PLAY'S THE THING. . .â€”Theatre designer Richard L. Hay, a graduate of Stanford, designed
Ashland's famed Elizabethan stagehouse. The theatre is dimensioned after the stages of the Henslowe
and Alleyn-Peter Street contract for the Fortune Theatre of Shakespeare's London, 1599.
