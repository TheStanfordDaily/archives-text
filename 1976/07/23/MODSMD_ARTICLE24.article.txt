DAVE MASON KEEPS HEADS ROCKING AT FROST—Famed British guitarist turned in a splendid
performance at Stanford's Frost Amphitheatre last Sunday before a sun-drenched crowd of avid fans.
The Gate Bros, and the New Riders of the Purple Sage rounded out the afternoon with some fine blues
rock and clean country licks.
