"Nyeh-heh-heh. . the evil
lear marks the familiar sound of
the melodrama, and no more de
lightfully dastardly an example
couldbefound this summerthan
Dirty Work at the Crossroads
which opened recently in Footh
ill College's Summerepetory '76
season.
In repertory with four other
fine American works, including
Room Service, Picnic, The
Gingerbread Lady and My Sister
Eileen, Foothill's drama de
partment is performing depend
ably well as it maintains it's high
standard of theater for the fifth
year in a row.
Dirty Work at the Crossroads
offers the perfect respite for
sumiper students who are burn
ing their brains and fizzling
themselves to a frazzle from late,
coffee-wired nights of studying.
Put your brain in low gear and
you'll have no trouble; the sly
guy in black is the villain, the
hfiro is the stout honest rustic in
the straw hat, and the heroine is
the golden haired lass in the
simple frock.
Although Bill Johnson's plot
is complex, the moral of the story
is simple: good will triumph
over evil, no matter what.
Several olio acts, variety enter
tainment performed by various
members of the company to
round out an evening are
utilized for act and scene breaks.
Most of these are good, with an

enthusiastic rendition of
"Good-bye My Coney Island
Baby" led by talented pianist
Fred Cummins in barbershop
quartet 'style receiving the most
enthusiastic applause.
Although some characters
were a little hard to believe upon
first impression, everyone in the
cast brought off their parts quite
well.
No slimier a villain could
there be than the conniving
Monro Murgatrovd played by
David Swan. Swan's villain is so
convincing that he wins the
sympathy of the audience and
(Horrors!) is an enjoyable
character, making it a sad sight
to see him foiled in all of his
frightfully foul deeds.
Nor could there be a more stoi
cal, yet impervious a hero as
Adam Oakhart portrayed by
James Amato, or so sweet and
innocent a lass as Nellie
Lovelace as acted by Carolyn
Keith.

The fallen women Ida
Rhinegold by Toni Tomei was
ideally contrasted with the high
society snobbery of Mrs. Upson
Asterbilt aired by Marjorie Ross.
The villain is duly booed and
the heros applauded on cue from
the pert miss on stage side, al
though the cues were sometimes
a slight bit late which detracted
from the effect of audience spon
taneity.
Costumes by Candy Maue are
ideal for the nostalgic capers,
and the sturdy sets by Charlie
Jaschob are simple but adequate.
The lightning effect of a train
chugging down the track into
the audience is realistically car
ried off by Kevin Boog, and
George Gilsbach wittily took
care of sound (and lack thereof)
for a twist.
Director Marti Stevens did
well with the classic production,
seeing to it that there was a con
sistent style of acting throughout
the two hour performance.
