# 'Baker's Wife' cute but dull
## 
### Jim O'Callahan 
The puzzle of the Civic
Light Opera's production of
The Baker's Wife is whether
the wares are raw or over
done. The ingredients are not
at fault, as they are all first
rate.
The show is adapted from a
charming ancient tale about
an elderly baker in a small
French town whose beautiful
young wife runs off with
another man.
The show revolves around
the famed Israeli actor,
Chaim Topol. Topol has a
sympathetic stage presence
which coupled with his deep

resonant voice naturally at
tracts an audience's attention.
Patti LuPome plays his wife,
Genvieve, admirably. Her
voice is strong yet attractive,
and her features beguiling.
Yet despite this formidable
cast. The Baker's Wi/e as a
whole just doesn't hang to
gether. The songs, though
melodious and catchy, just do
not seem to fit the moods of
the play and the simple
plot. The unimpressive and
unvarying set does not help.
In short, Topol and a fine
supporting cast cannot save
what is a dull and bleak pro
duction.
