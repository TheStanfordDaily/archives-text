Execution stays ordered
WASHINGTON—The NAACP Legal
Defense Fund won a reprieve for 166
condemned convicts yesterday when
Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell or
dered a stay of their executions.
The stay for death-row convicts in
Florida. Texas and Georgia will apply
until the court decides whether to review
its July 2 decision which ruled that the
states' execution laws were constitu
tional.
The Supreme Court has since ad
journed for the summer and unless a rare
special session is called will not return
until October. Interpretation of the
court's July 2 decision has puzzled offi
cials of other states.
Congress probe blocked
WASHINGTON —A Federal judge has
issued an order temporarily blocking
Congress from seeking information from
the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company on wiretaps ordered by the
FBI.
The restraining order was requested by
President Ford, who wants to slow an
investigation by the House Intelligence
Sub-Committee into possible abuses of
power by the FBI and CIA. The sub
committee is seeking to determine the
nature of wiretaps made by the FBI with
out court approval.
Such wiretaps are supposed to be
made only for national security pur
poses, and Ford and other members of
the executive branch said disclosure of
the AT&T records could reveal U.S. intel
ligence sources.

Lebanon breaks up
BEIRUT—The break-up of Lebanon
appeared imminent yesterday as Moslem
leftists announced that they had formed
a government council to rule their part of
Beirut.
Observers saw the move as counter to
the creation of similar governmental
structures by Christian rightists in recent
days. The leftists denied it, but their for
mation of a government appeared to be
one more step in the partition of the
country into separate Christian and Mos
lem states.
Reagan gets funds
WASHINGTON—RonaId Reagan re
ceived the largest federal campaign fund
ever given to a single candidate in one
day yesterday. The Federal Election
Commission gave the Republican presi
dential candidate $1.4 million in match
ing funds yesterday, bringing to $23
million the amount of aid that all prim
ary candidates have received so far.
But reports persisted that Reagan was
on the verge of elimination from the race
for Republican national convention de
legates. A New York Times survey yes
terday showed that President Gerald
Ford led Reagan by almost 50 delegates
and needed only 18morevotes to clinch

the nomination. And thepreviouslypro-
Reagan Mississippi delegation showed
signs that it might go over to the presi
dent.
Ford said he told cabinet members and
campaign officials yesterday that they
were to promise no favors or rewards in
their efforts to win over uncommitted de
legates.
Olympic results
MONTREAL—Nadia Comaneci.the
Rumanian gymnast who captured the

beam and uneven parallel bars to win
two more gold medals last night.

American men swimmers received
their ninth consecutive go»id medal last
night as the4oo-meter medley relay team

Goodell of the U.S. added his second
gold medal by taking the 400-meter

freestyle in world record time. Team
mate Tim Shaw was second.
The East Germans continued to domi
nate women's swimming. Kornelia
Ender became only the scond woman in
Olympic history to win four gold medals
— and she still has another event to
swim. Ender won twice yesterday, beat
ing out the best American swimmer,
Shirley Babashoff, in the 200-meter
freestyle and winning the 100-meter but
terfly as well.
In other American action, light
welterweight boxer Sugar Ray Leonard
outpointed Russia's European champ

Execution stays ordered
WASHINGTON—The NAACP Legal
Defense Fund won a reprieve for 166
condemned convicts yesterday when
Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell or
dered a stay of their executions.
The stay for death-row convicts in
Florida. Texas and Georgia will apply
until the court decides whether to review
its July 2 decision which ruled that the
states' execution laws were constitu
tional.
The Supreme Court has since ad
journed for the summer and unless a rare
special session is called will not return
until October. Interpretation of the
court's July 2 decision has puzzled offi
cials of other states.
Congress probe blocked
WASHINGTON —A Federal judge has
issued an order temporarily blocking
Congress from seeking information from
the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company on wiretaps ordered by the
FBI.
The restraining order was requested by
President Ford, who wants to slow an
investigation by the House Intelligence
Sub-Committee into possible abuses of
power by the FBI and CIA. The sub
committee is seeking to determine the
nature of wiretaps made by the FBI with
out court approval.
Such wiretaps are supposed to be
made only for national security pur
poses, and Ford and other members of
the executive branch said disclosure of
the AT&T records could reveal U.S. intel
ligence sources.

Lebanon breaks up
BEIRUT—The break-up of Lebanon
appeared imminent yesterday as Moslem
leftists announced that they had formed
a government council to rule their part of
Beirut.
Observers saw the move as counter to
the creation of similar governmental
structures by Christian rightists in recent
days. The leftists denied it, but their for
mation of a government appeared to be
one more step in the partition of the
country into separate Christian and Mos
lem states.
Reagan gets funds
WASHINGTON—RonaId Reagan re

million the amount of aid that all prim
ary candidates have received so far.
