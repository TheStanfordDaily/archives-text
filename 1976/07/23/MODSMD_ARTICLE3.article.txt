A postdoctoral researcher in
chemistry was found dead in his
Menlo Park apartment Tuesday
night, and a coroner's examina
tion indicated that he may have
been bound with adhesive tape
and strangled.
The body of Edward McNeill.
25. was discovered Tuesday
night by his landlady and a
friend in his apartment at 782
Coleman Avenue. The coroner's
examination disclosed that he
had been dead for approximately
two days and tentatively desig
nated strangulation as the cause
of death. The examination also
discovered traces of adhesive
tape on McNeill's hands and
mouth.
"We're still in the preliminary
stages of the investigation," said
Deputy Chief Robert Brickley of
the Menlo Park police. "There
are no new leads vet."
McNeill was engaged in post

doctoral research in inorganic
chemistry on a National Science
Foundation fellowship. Hewasa

very competent indeed." accord

Prof. Richard Holm.
Paul Sobotka, a recent
graduate who worked in the
same laboratory as McNeill, said
that "everybody in the lab was
scared shitless" when they
learned of the murder.
McNeill's murder is the fifth
unsolved murder of a member of
the Stanford community in three
years. The other four are:
—Leslie Perlov. who vanished
for two days and was found
strangled to death in the footh
ills on Feb. l(i. 1973. Police
speculated that she walked with
her murderer to the site from her
car. which was discovered
parked on Old Page Mill Koad
about three-quarters of a mile
away.
—David Levine, who was
stabbed several times in the back
while jogging in front of Meyer
Undergraduate Library early in
the morning of Sept. 11, 1973.
Police have not been able to
come up with so much as a mo
tive for the slaying of the 20-
year-old physics major, the son
of a Cornell University profes
sor. A subsequent killing on Dec.
20, 1973 on the UC-Berkeley
campus created brief specula
tion that the murderer was the
person who had killed Levine,
but nothing came of the theory.
—Janet Taylor, the daughter of
former athletic director Chuck
Taylor, who was found strangled
to death west of Menlo Park be
side Sand Hill Road on March
21. 1974. She had been last seen
hitchhiking along Junipero
Serra Boulevard the morning be
fore her body was found. Police
said that her murderer had
strangled her to death with bare
hands.
—Arlis Perry, the wife of a
Stanford student, who was dis
covered stabbed to death in
Memorial Church on Oct. 13,
1974. Perry, whose body was
nude from the waist down, had
been sexually molested with
candlesticks.
McNeill received his B.A.
from Occidental College and his
Ph.D. from Cornell University.
He is survived by his parents,
Mrs. and Mrs. Russell McNeill of
Bellevue, Wash.
Menlo Park Police Chief Vic-
tor Cizanckas asked that he be
contacted at the police station by
anyone who saw McNeill on
Sunday.
McNeill's last known contact
was at 1 a.m. Sunday, when his
friend Anthony Weld left him at
his apartment. McNeill, Weld
and two other people had been
playing miniature golf Saturday
night.
