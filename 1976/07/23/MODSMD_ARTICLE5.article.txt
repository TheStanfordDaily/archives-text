## Suspension 
### 
In comment on the column
'Over-Punishment' in the July I<>
Daily I think the writers might
have a point except for the fact
that this is not the first time the
Delts have found themselves in
trouble for property destruction
and abuse. The fraternity was
suspended from campus on a re
cent similar offense and here
they art' a year after their
reinstatement committing the
same offense.
I think President Lyman has a
right to suspend the individual
culprits. Since the punishment
of collective suspension a few
years ago was so lightly re
garded. there is no reason to be
lieve that the same thing will not
happen again a few years hence.
President Lvman, like a good pa
rent. is making the punishment
more severe for a second offense.
To think a group of university
students who want to be treated
as intelligent adults should act
in such a manner and have to be
chastised like naughty children
is bad enough but to suggest that
they be punished as a group
again when individual culprits
are known is like the old Freu
dian teaching of repeating to a
child over and over again that he
shouldn't break the "nice" win
dows when six of the best on the

seat of his anatomy would make
a lasting impression that such
conduct is not tolerated.
It is amazing to me how the
rowdy, disorderly and destruc
tive conduct of the Delts is per
petuated in each class of
pledges. —or is it that athletes
have a low alcohol tolerance
level?

L.H. Gann's response (Daily.
July lh) to my review of Sol
zhenitsyn's Leinin in Zurich
(daily. July 13) is a prime exam
ple of academic petrification,
hopefully of an "unconscious
kind." Mr. Cann apparently
holds that anything not com
pletely for is necessarily
thoroughly against.
My review stressed the seri
ousness of Solzhenitsyn's work,
not the merits or demerits of the
October Revolution or the pre
sent Soviet regime. The task of
dealing with the latter I leave to
Mr. Solzhenitsvn.
I suggest that you reread my
review before making any more
incorrect statements and that
you stop looking for communists
behind every rose bush. Mr.
Cann.
