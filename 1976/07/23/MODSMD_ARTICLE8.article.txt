# Intelligence on Mars?
## Buford Fennington

Now that the United States has-landed a thingy
on Mars and taken pictures of an area which looks
very similar to a gravel parking lot in South San
Jose, the question on everybody's mind is when,
indeed, NASA will subsidize exactly such an ex
pedition.
To San Jose, that is.
Is there intelligent life in San Jose?
Is there intelligent life at NASA?
Surely the most brilliant men in the world can
think of something more dramatic to do with our
tax dollars than shooting tin cans toward a hunk
of matter floating about in a vacuum.
To spend billions and trillions of dollars on an
expedition which proves little more than the fact
that Mars looks a lot like the moon strikes me as
slightly economically irresponsible.
Of course, maybe the thingy really didn't make
it to Mars. Maybe it just made a perfect "soft"
landing in the backyard of the Jet Propulsion

Laboratory. Just like that landing on the moon
seven years ago. You don't really think they'd risk
Neil Armstrong's life sending him to the moon,
did you ? Sout hern Californians have been pulling
that sort of trick on us for many years.
First they steal your water. Then they try to
make you believe they've gone to the moon. Now
they're even trying to make us believe there's in
telligent life in San Jose. Well I'm not going to fall
for it. And I suggest you do the same.
If there really are any little green men running
around, five will get you ten they're from NASA,
and the green is the money that's been sticking to
their pudgy little scientific hands.
In these days of government investigations, I
think it's high time we look into our American
space program.
If it's really American at all.
