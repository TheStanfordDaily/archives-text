# Town and Country Village
## Merchants forced out?

"For over three years it was a
pat on the back and friendly vis
its from (Town and Country Vil
lage President) Ron Williams.
Then suddenly." says florist Phil
Chew, "it was a kick in the pants
instead."
Chew is the former owner of
Town and Country (T&C) Florist,
located in one corner of the T&C
Market where another florist
now keeps shop.
One Saturday afternoon last
September, says Chew, his teen
age daughter was handed a
notice of rent increase by the
management. Four days later, on
Oct. 1, Chew's rent for 300
square feet would go up from
$300. to $750 per month, said the
letter.
"My counsel said that was il
legal, that we should have 30
day's notice.

"Ron (Williams) had given my
every indication that a new
three-year lease could be
negotiated after our first one ran
out (in late summer)." saysChew.
"And then unexpectedly,
'boom'
It has been "boom" for quite a
few other T&C tenants in recent
months. The bakery — Village
Pastries — is gone. Allegedly
baker Jack Was hi k was asked to
give up one third of his shop, but
to pay the same rent for the smal
ler area. Washik could not be
reached for confirmation. Her
man Neidhart. T&C Village Of
fice Manager, claims Washik
planned to retire soon anyway.
The Royal Polynesian shop at
the corner of El Camino and Em
barcadero is moving out this
week; Thinker Toys next door
went out last month; and the
Foot Care shop behind T&C
Pharmacy, the owners say, has
been "forced to move out by
Sept. 1." At least seven other
stores have gone out of business
and been replaced in the last
year.
Only the Foot ("are shop own
ers were able to confirm that
doubling their rent gave them no
choice but to move out of Town
and Country Village.
Jeff Langston, manager of
Thinker Toys' San Jose shop and
former manager of the Palo Alto
shop recalls "all kinds of argu
ments with the management."
He admits, however, that the toy
shop owner decided to move out
of Town and Country when his
lease ran out because "business
just wasn't good enough."
Ron Wilson, second-hand
man to president Williams states
the T&C Village policy simply.
"The only reason we change
our tenants is to give better ser
vice to our customers. When a
tenant isn't bringing in enough
business we replace him."
Wilson claims, however, that
in replacing tenants, "we never,
ever force anyone out."
Neidhard explains the recent
changes in another way.
"It's just the same as an apart
ment building," he says. "If you
have a 10-year lease at a 1966
price, you can be sure your rent
will be raised when the lease
runs out in 1976.
Neidhart claims that the man
agement is actually doing a favor
to long-time tenants by forcing
some of them out.
"Raising their rent is just our
way of telling them that they're
just not bringing in as much

money as they used to. In fact,
they are losing so much money
that it's not worth it to them to
stay in business."
Tenants do not see it quitethat
way.
"They're a dirty bunch over
there (at the manager's office), if
you want to know the truth,"
says a woman at the Foot Clare
Shop. "They gave (the shop
owners) no reason for doubling
their rent, and when the doctor
(Dr. Bakke. a podiatrist who
owns the shop) tried to negotiate
on the higher rent they told him
'take it or leave it.' They said a
T-shirt shop was willing to take
the space."
The woman expresses a
thought heard from a variety of
other shop owners. "Pretty
soon." she says, "there wi 11 be no
service-oriented placed left
around here — it will be all gift
shops and T-shirts. Where will
all the little old ladies go to get
their special shoes?"

EMPTY BAKERY—This store is one of many Town and Country
Village stores that have closed their doors recently. Depending on
who you talk to, the replacement will be a furniture store, another
bakery, a jewelry shop or the big area may be divided up into three
different shops.

EMPTY BAKERY—This store is one of many Town and Country
Village stores that have closed their doors recently. Depending on
who you talk to, the replacement will be a furniture store, another
bakery, a jewelry shop or the big area may be divided up into three
different shops.
"For over three years it was a
pat on the back and friendly vis
its from (Town and Country Vil
lage President) Ron Williams.
Then suddenly." says florist Phil
Chew, "it was a kick in the pants
instead."
Chew is the former owner of
Town and Country (T&C) Florist,
located in one corner of the T&C
Market where another florist
now keeps shop.
One Saturday afternoon last
September, says Chew, his teen
age daughter was handed a
notice of rent increase by the
management. Four days later, on
Oct. 1, Chew's rent for 300
square feet would go up from
$300. to $750 per month, said the
letter.
"My counsel said that was il
legal, that we should have 30
day's notice.

"Ron (Williams) had given my
every indication that a new
three-year lease could be
negotiated after our first one ran
out (in late summer)." saysChew.
"And then unexpectedly,
'boom'
It has been "boom" for quite a
few other T&C tenants in recent
months. The bakery — Village
Pastries — is gone. Allegedly
baker Jack Was hi k was asked to
give up one third of his shop, but
to pay the same rent for the smal
ler area. Washik could not be
reached for confirmation. Her
man Neidhart. T&C Village Of
fice Manager, claims Washik
planned to retire soon anyway.
The Royal Polynesian shop at
the corner of El Camino and Em
barcadero is moving out this
week; Thinker Toys next door
went out last month; and the
Foot Care shop behind T&C
Pharmacy, the owners say, has
been "forced to move out by
Sept. 1." At least seven other
stores have gone out of business
and been replaced in the last
year.
Only the Foot ("are shop own
ers were able to confirm that
doubling their rent gave them no
choice but to move out of Town
and Country Village.
Jeff Langston, manager of
Thinker Toys' San Jose shop and
former manager of the Palo Alto
shop recalls "all kinds of argu
ments with the management."
He admits, however, that the toy
shop owner decided to move out
of Town and Country when his
lease ran out because "business
just wasn't good enough."
Ron Wilson, second-hand
man to president Williams states
the T&C Village policy simply.
"The only reason we change
our tenants is to give better ser
vice to our customers. When a
tenant isn't bringing in enough
business we replace him."
Wilson claims, however, that
in replacing tenants, "we never,
ever force anyone out."
Neidhard explains the recent
changes in another way.
"It's just the same as an apart
ment building," he says. "If you
have a 10-year lease at a 1966
price, you can be sure your rent
will be raised when the lease
runs out in 1976.
Neidhart claims that the man
agement is actually doing a favor
to long-time tenants by forcing
some of them out.
"Raising their rent is just our
way of telling them that they're
just not bringing in as much

money as they used to. In fact,
they are losing so much money
that it's not worth it to them to
stay in business."
Tenants do not see it quitethat
way.
"They're a dirty bunch over
there (at the manager's office), if
you want to know the truth,"
says a woman at the Foot Clare
Shop. "They gave (the shop
owners) no reason for doubling
their rent, and when the doctor
(Dr. Bakke. a podiatrist who
owns the shop) tried to negotiate
on the higher rent they told him
'take it or leave it.' They said a
T-shirt shop was willing to take
the space."
The woman expresses a
thought heard from a variety of
other shop owners. "Pretty
soon." she says, "there wi 11 be no
service-oriented placed left
around here — it will be all gift
shops and T-shirts. Where will
all the little old ladies go to get
