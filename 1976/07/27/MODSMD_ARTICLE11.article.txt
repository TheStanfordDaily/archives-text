Reagan picks Schweiker
LOS ANGELES—Ronald Reagan made
one of the most surprising political
moves of the year yesterday when he an
nounced that Pennsylvania Senator
Richard Schweiker would be his running
mate if Reagan got the Republican nomi
nation three weeks from now.
The selection of Schweiker, whom
Reagan called "a man of independent
thought and action" who disdained
Washington's "buddy system," came
unexpectedly because Schweiker has the
reputation of a moderate-to-liberal
senator. Until yesterday Schweiker was
considered pledged to President Gerald
Ford as one of Pennsylvania's 103 con
vention delegates.
Democratic nominee Jimmy Garter cal
led Schweiker "a good man from what 1
have heard about him," but reaction from
Ford forces were not as temperate. Re
publicans in Congress termed Reagan's
announcement "a move of desperation"
and "an incredible aberration."

Hearst trial delayed
LOS ANGELES—A judge yesterday

on the same charges.
Suspect tried Canada

Reagan picks Schweiker
LOS ANGELES—Ronald Reagan made
one of the most surprising political
moves of the year yesterday when he an
nounced that Pennsylvania Senator
Richard Schweiker would be his running
mate if Reagan got the Republican nomi
nation three weeks from now.
The selection of Schweiker, whom
Reagan called "a man of independent
thought and action" who disdained
Washington's "buddy system," came
unexpectedly because Schweiker has the
reputation of a moderate-to-liberal
senator. Until yesterday Schweiker was
considered pledged to President Gerald
Ford as one of Pennsylvania's 103 con
vention delegates.
Democratic nominee Jimmy Garter cal
led Schweiker "a good man from what 1
have heard about him," but reaction from
Ford forces were not as temperate. Re
publicans in Congress termed Reagan's
announcement "a move of desperation"
and "an incredible aberration."
