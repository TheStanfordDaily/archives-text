## Beyers: news mediator 
### Caryn Coulter 
Something newsworthy is happening.
The Daily is there.
KZSU is there.
And so is someone else.
Look closely — but in an obscure corner
backstage or behind the scenes. You'll recognize
him by his pocket-sized tape recorder and black
leather "Earth" shoes, meticulously scribbling
with a stubby pencil.
Bob Beyers,Stanford's mass mediator, is always
there. As director of the University News Service,
he considers omniscience his job. But he's a silent
giant.
Autonomy
"I enjoy great autonomy in what I do at the
university," he confides.
His cohorts at the news office in Encina Com
mons will agree.
"He's the original 'I-can-do-it-myself boss,"
claims Eileen Willia, Beyers' secretary. Campus
Report editor Patricia Black adds, "He's also the
first 'Anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better'
boss."
One might be inclined to dub Beyers the official
"Gatekeeper of Stanford." Few facts pass through
the "Farm gate" without his seal of approval. In
addition to overseeing the publication of Campus
Report and the Stanford Observer, he personally
publishes and edits Education Digest, an as
semblage of timely articles he collects from the
five newspapers and 50 magazines he reads.
Press releases
Beyers also maintains contact with the world of
news media through weekly, daily and often
hourly press releases. But the side-burned star
reporter is more than t he average public "relater."
Under his jurisdiction, the news service thrives
as one of the world's top-quality college news
bureaus. Some HO percent of the editors who re

ceive his press releases consider them to be better
than most releases they receive.
Juanita Hogue of U.S. News and World Report
notes Beyers' distinction: "Absolutely superior
releases — most helpful I see from any college or
university."
"A splendid service!" proclaims Carey McWil
liams, editor of The Nation magazine.
Non-stop
It's no miracle. Beyers economizes on time by
doing several jobs at once. For instance, he is
probably one of the few individuals who can carry
on a telephone conversation while he is typing
press releases non-stop.
"In my opinion, all you need for any effective
news operation is a telephone, a typewriter,
paper, envelopes and a little postage money. If
you have lots of initiative, spend half your time
outside your office and acquire a reputation for
honesty and accuracy in reporting, you probably
can even dispense with postage," remarks Beyers.
In some cases, however, postage costs may be
replaced by telephone bills. Beyers' active role in
the international coverage of the kidnapings of
Stanford students in Tanzania earned him a repu
tation as a fact hustler. It also earned him a whop
ping $6000 telephone bill.
22-hour day
Putting in 22-hour days in the spring of '75,
Beyers' instinctive aggression surfaced as he un
covered — fact by fact — the realities of the Tan
zania kidnap.
"A fascinating problem in communication." he
calls it.
He went so far as to photograph a Boston
Whaler in Redwood City which would closely
resemble a boat which held the Stanford hostages.
"Have you seen this boat?" read the caption under
the photo he wired across the world.
