# A 						silent giant
## Beyers: news mediator 
### Caryn Coulter 
Something newsworthy is happening.
The Daily is there.
KZSU is there.
And so is someone else.
Look closely — but in an obscure corner
backstage or behind the scenes. You'll recognize
him by his pocket-sized tape recorder and black
leather "Earth" shoes, meticulously scribbling
with a stubby pencil.
Bob Beyers,Stanford's mass mediator, is always
there. As director of the University News Service,
he considers omniscience his job. But he's a silent
giant.
Autonomy
"I enjoy great autonomy in what I do at the
university," he confides.
His cohorts at the news office in Encina Com
mons will agree.
"He's the original 'I-can-do-it-myself boss,"
claims Eileen Willia, Beyers' secretary. Campus
Report editor Patricia Black adds, "He's also the
first 'Anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better'
boss."
One might be inclined to dub Beyers the official
"Gatekeeper of Stanford." Few facts pass through
the "Farm gate" without his seal of approval. In
addition to overseeing the publication of Campus
Report and the Stanford Observer, he personally
publishes and edits Education Digest, an as
semblage of timely articles he collects from the
five newspapers and 50 magazines he reads.
Press releases
Beyers also maintains contact with the world of
news media through weekly, daily and often
hourly press releases. But the side-burned star
reporter is more than t he average public "relater."
Under his jurisdiction, the news service thrives
as one of the world's top-quality college news
bureaus. Some HO percent of the editors who re

ceive his press releases consider them to be better
than most releases they receive.
Juanita Hogue of U.S. News and World Report
notes Beyers' distinction: "Absolutely superior
releases — most helpful I see from any college or
university."
"A splendid service!" proclaims Carey McWil
liams, editor of The Nation magazine.
Non-stop
It's no miracle. Beyers economizes on time by
doing several jobs at once. For instance, he is
probably one of the few individuals who can carry
on a telephone conversation while he is typing
press releases non-stop.
"In my opinion, all you need for any effective
news operation is a telephone, a typewriter,
paper, envelopes and a little postage money. If
you have lots of initiative, spend half your time
outside your office and acquire a reputation for
honesty and accuracy in reporting, you probably
can even dispense with postage," remarks Beyers.
In some cases, however, postage costs may be
replaced by telephone bills. Beyers' active role in
the international coverage of the kidnapings of
Stanford students in Tanzania earned him a repu
tation as a fact hustler. It also earned him a whop
ping $6000 telephone bill.
22-hour day
Putting in 22-hour days in the spring of '75,
Beyers' instinctive aggression surfaced as he un
covered — fact by fact — the realities of the Tan
zania kidnap.
"A fascinating problem in communication." he
calls it.
He went so far as to photograph a Boston
Whaler in Redwood City which would closely
resemble a boat which held the Stanford hostages.
"Have you seen this boat?" read the caption under
the photo he wired across the world.
At one point, two of the kidnap victims had
been released from custody. The third victim
didn't even realize he was alone until he heard
Beyers' press release broadcast over the BBC.
"If we're operating in a national-international
world, we've got to know what's going on." he
explains.
He's the son of a New York City salesman, who
appears to have inherited his father's hustling
instincts while traveling about the country in his
youth.
"1 went to 20 different schools before 1 entered
college," he recalls. And he still hasn't learned to
sit still.
At 6:52 p.m.. he hurries over to KZSU to cover
the broadcast of "Campus Conference" with Pres
ident Richard Lyman. Beyers slips a last-minute
press release into the hands of KZSU question
man Andrew Holtz, just as the program goes on
the air.
Holtz' question catches Lyman oft-guard, as he
asks for a comment on the strongarm robbery ar
rest of three Stanford students earlier the same
day.
"Where did you hear that?" Lvman asks,
somewhat shaken.
"Stanford news service," Holtz replies.
Lyman swivels in his chair to find Beyers
chuckling in the background.
An hour later. Beyers is behind the curtain in
Cubberlev Auditorium. The eternal scribble of his
green-leaded pencil records momentos of John
Kenneth Calbraith's speech. "1 just go to see if
there's anything the Daily doesn't pick up." he
says. It's no small wonder that the Daily staff often
uses Beyers' news material in their paper, as does
almost every major college-oriented news
medium.

Beyers objects to the stereotypical news opera
tions of most colleges. Despite the opinion of
those who have christened him "Boh Bias" in the
past, he deplores those who would paint a rosy
picture of Stanford.
/'This practice quickly kills the credibility and
effectiveness of any communications program; for
students, faculty, administrators and alumni will
rarely agree on what's 'good' and what's 'bad'
news," he explains.
Since 196 t.he has held to this philosophy as
the University official link with the outside
world. His workers say he's married to his work,
but somehow he handles his free-lance-writing
wife and seven children.
His 13-14 hours a day end as he drops an en
velope of press releases in the Palo Alto Times
mailbox, at a time of night when most solid
thinking University administrators are at home
watching Johnny Carson.
"Otherwise they (the Palo Alto Times) won't get
the mail until maybe 10 in the morning." he exp
lains.
In his effort to reach key audiences "firstest
with the mostest." he's famous for "slumber par
ties" in the news service office. The Wall Street
Journalrecords one such marathon work period in
the spring of 1970. during the Cambodia protests.
Beyers and his staff, "the sleeping bag six,"
delivered 18 stories a day to the news media while
protesters blockaded his office. His secretary re
calls the pandemonium: "It was like World War II
without bombs."
Things have settled down since then, but news
service activities never let up.
"This has been one of our quieter .springs."
Beyers remarks, almost sounding disappointed,
"but 1 never know what might happen when 1
wake up tomorrow.!"

Something newsworthy is happening.
The Daily is there.
KZSU is there.
And so is someone else.
Look closely — but in an obscure corner
backstage or behind the scenes. You'll recognize
him by his pocket-sized tape recorder and black
leather "Earth" shoes, meticulously scribbling
with a stubby pencil.
Bob Beyers,Stanford's mass mediator, is always
there. As director of the University News Service,
he considers omniscience his job. But he's a silent
giant.
Autonomy
"I enjoy great autonomy in what I do at the
university," he confides.
His cohorts at the news office in Encina Com
mons will agree.
"He's the original 'I-can-do-it-myself boss,"
claims Eileen Willia, Beyers' secretary. Campus
Report editor Patricia Black adds, "He's also the
first 'Anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better'
boss."
One might be inclined to dub Beyers the official
"Gatekeeper of Stanford." Few facts pass through
the "Farm gate" without his seal of approval. In
addition to overseeing the publication of Campus
Report and the Stanford Observer, he personally
publishes and edits Education Digest, an as
semblage of timely articles he collects from the
five newspapers and 50 magazines he reads.
Press releases
Beyers also maintains contact with the world of
news media through weekly, daily and often
hourly press releases. But the side-burned star
reporter is more than t he average public "relater."
Under his jurisdiction, the news service thrives
as one of the world's top-quality college news
bureaus. Some HO percent of the editors who re

ceive his press releases consider them to be better
than most releases they receive.
Juanita Hogue of U.S. News and World Report
notes Beyers' distinction: "Absolutely superior
releases — most helpful I see from any college or
university."
"A splendid service!" proclaims Carey McWil
liams, editor of The Nation magazine.
Non-stop
It's no miracle. Beyers economizes on time by
doing several jobs at once. For instance, he is
probably one of the few individuals who can carry
on a telephone conversation while he is typing
press releases non-stop.
"In my opinion, all you need for any effective
news operation is a telephone, a typewriter,
paper, envelopes and a little postage money. If
you have lots of initiative, spend half your time
outside your office and acquire a reputation for
honesty and accuracy in reporting, you probably
can even dispense with postage," remarks Beyers.
In some cases, however, postage costs may be
replaced by telephone bills. Beyers' active role in
the international coverage of the kidnapings of
Stanford students in Tanzania earned him a repu
tation as a fact hustler. It also earned him a whop
ping $6000 telephone bill.
22-hour day
Putting in 22-hour days in the spring of '75,
Beyers' instinctive aggression surfaced as he un
covered — fact by fact — the realities of the Tan
zania kidnap.
"A fascinating problem in communication." he
calls it.
He went so far as to photograph a Boston
Whaler in Redwood City which would closely
resemble a boat which held the Stanford hostages.
"Have you seen this boat?" read the caption under
the photo he wired across the world.
At one point, two of the kidnap victims had
been released from custody. The third victim
didn't even realize he was alone until he heard
Beyers' press release broadcast over the BBC.
"If we're operating in a national-international
world, we've got to know what's going on." he
explains.
He's the son of a New York City salesman, who
appears to have inherited his father's hustling
instincts while traveling about the country in his
youth.
"1 went to 20 different schools before 1 entered
college," he recalls. And he still hasn't learned to
sit still.
At 6:52 p.m.. he hurries over to KZSU to cover
the broadcast of "Campus Conference" with Pres
ident Richard Lyman. Beyers slips a last-minute
press release into the hands of KZSU question
man Andrew Holtz, just as the program goes on
the air.
Holtz' question catches Lyman oft-guard, as he
asks for a comment on the strongarm robbery ar
rest of three Stanford students earlier the same
day.
"Where did you hear that?" Lvman asks,
somewhat shaken.
"Stanford news service," Holtz replies.
Lyman swivels in his chair to find Beyers
chuckling in the background.
An hour later. Beyers is behind the curtain in
Cubberlev Auditorium. The eternal scribble of his
green-leaded pencil records momentos of John
Kenneth Calbraith's speech. "1 just go to see if
there's anything the Daily doesn't pick up." he
says. It's no small wonder that the Daily staff often
uses Beyers' news material in their paper, as does
almost every major college-oriented news
medium.

Beyers' instinctive aggression surfaced as he un
covered — fact by fact — the realities of the Tan
zania kidnap.
"A fascinating problem in communication." he
calls it.
He went so far as to photograph a Boston
Whaler in Redwood City which would closely
resemble a boat which held the Stanford hostages.
"Have you seen this boat?" read the caption under
the photo he wired across the world.
At one point, two of the kidnap victims had
been released from custody. The third victim
didn't even realize he was alone until he heard
Beyers' press release broadcast over the BBC.
"If we're operating in a national-international
world, we've got to know what's going on." he
explains.
He's the son of a New York City salesman, who
appears to have inherited his father's hustling
instincts while traveling about the country in his
youth.
"1 went to 20 different schools before 1 entered
college," he recalls. And he still hasn't learned to
sit still.
At 6:52 p.m.. he hurries over to KZSU to cover
the broadcast of "Campus Conference" with Pres
ident Richard Lyman. Beyers slips a last-minute
press release into the hands of KZSU question
man Andrew Holtz, just as the program goes on
the air.
Holtz' question catches Lyman oft-guard, as he
asks for a comment on the strongarm robbery ar
rest of three Stanford students earlier the same
day.
"Where did you hear that?" Lvman asks,
somewhat shaken.
"Stanford news service," Holtz replies.
Lyman swivels in his chair to find Beyers
chuckling in the background.
An hour later. Beyers is behind the curtain in
Cubberlev Auditorium. The eternal scribble of his
green-leaded pencil records momentos of John
Kenneth Calbraith's speech. "1 just go to see if
there's anything the Daily doesn't pick up." he
says. It's no small wonder that the Daily staff often
uses Beyers' news material in their paper, as does
almost every major college-oriented news
medium.

Beyers objects to the stereotypical news opera
tions of most colleges. Despite the opinion of
those who have christened him "Boh Bias" in the
past, he deplores those who would paint a rosy
picture of Stanford.
/'This practice quickly kills the credibility and
effectiveness of any communications program; for
students, faculty, administrators and alumni will
rarely agree on what's 'good' and what's 'bad'
news," he explains.
Since 196 t.he has held to this philosophy as
the University official link with the outside
world. His workers say he's married to his work,
but somehow he handles his free-lance-writing
wife and seven children.
His 13-14 hours a day end as he drops an en
velope of press releases in the Palo Alto Times
mailbox, at a time of night when most solid
thinking University administrators are at home
watching Johnny Carson.
"Otherwise they (the Palo Alto Times) won't get
the mail until maybe 10 in the morning." he exp
lains.
In his effort to reach key audiences "firstest
with the mostest." he's famous for "slumber par
ties" in the news service office. The Wall Street
Journalrecords one such marathon work period in
the spring of 1970. during the Cambodia protests.
Beyers and his staff, "the sleeping bag six,"
delivered 18 stories a day to the news media while
protesters blockaded his office. His secretary re
calls the pandemonium: "It was like World War II
without bombs."
Things have settled down since then, but news
service activities never let up.
"This has been one of our quieter .springs."
Beyers remarks, almost sounding disappointed,
"but 1 never know what might happen when 1
wake up tomorrow.!"

Something newsworthy is happening.
The Daily is there.
KZSU is there.
And so is someone else.
Look closely — but in an obscure corner
backstage or behind the scenes. You'll recognize
him by his pocket-sized tape recorder and black
leather "Earth" shoes, meticulously scribbling
with a stubby pencil.
Bob Beyers,Stanford's mass mediator, is always
there. As director of the University News Service,
he considers omniscience his job. But he's a silent
giant.
Autonomy
"I enjoy great autonomy in what I do at the
university," he confides.
His cohorts at the news office in Encina Com
mons will agree.
"He's the original 'I-can-do-it-myself boss,"
claims Eileen Willia, Beyers' secretary. Campus
Report editor Patricia Black adds, "He's also the
first 'Anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better'
boss."
One might be inclined to dub Beyers the official
"Gatekeeper of Stanford." Few facts pass through
the "Farm gate" without his seal of approval. In
addition to overseeing the publication of Campus
Report and the Stanford Observer, he personally
publishes and edits Education Digest, an as
semblage of timely articles he collects from the
five newspapers and 50 magazines he reads.
Press releases
Beyers also maintains contact with the world of
news media through weekly, daily and often
hourly press releases. But the side-burned star
reporter is more than t he average public "relater."
Under his jurisdiction, the news service thrives
as one of the world's top-quality college news
bureaus. Some HO percent of the editors who re

ceive his press releases consider them to be better
than most releases they receive.
Juanita Hogue of U.S. News and World Report
notes Beyers' distinction: "Absolutely superior
releases — most helpful I see from any college or
university."
"A splendid service!" proclaims Carey McWil
liams, editor of The Nation magazine.
Non-stop
It's no miracle. Beyers economizes on time by
doing several jobs at once. For instance, he is
probably one of the few individuals who can carry
on a telephone conversation while he is typing
press releases non-stop.
"In my opinion, all you need for any effective
news operation is a telephone, a typewriter,
paper, envelopes and a little postage money. If
you have lots of initiative, spend half your time
outside your office and acquire a reputation for
honesty and accuracy in reporting, you probably
can even dispense with postage," remarks Beyers.
In some cases, however, postage costs may be
replaced by telephone bills. Beyers' active role in
the international coverage of the kidnapings of
Stanford students in Tanzania earned him a repu
tation as a fact hustler. It also earned him a whop
ping $6000 telephone bill.
