## Carter born again in Southern minds 
### 
Stephen Carter

ATLANTA, Ga.—The morn
ing after was a pretty heady time
for Georgians and other Deep
Southerners, so accustomed to
being lambasted by the Punitive
Pundits of the Deep North.
A simple. God-fearing, born
again Christian peanut farmer
from South Georgia had just
achieved every simple. God
fearing. Ghristian American
boy's dream come true — he had
received the nomination of the
Democratic Party for president
of the United States.
At last, the forces of evil — the
Brazen Browns, the Chastizing
Ghurches, the Useless lldalls —
had been halted and a new
crown prince would take his
place in the vanguard of history,
casting out the pagan Republi
cans, and ushering in, virtually
unaided, a new Ghristian era of
unity and peace and peanuts.
Or at least, that's what the
Georgians seem to think. Accus
tomed to being the butts of jokes
("Did you hear the one about the

hillbilly and the moonshine in
Okeefenokee Swamp?") or of
conventional wisdom ("Of
course, no Southerner could
ever be elected again"), these re
sidents of the Deep South have
been desperate for the chance to

prove themselves as good as —
no. better than — the ruling
clique (as they call it) in
America.
In James Earl Carter of Plains,
Ga.. they at last see their chance.
I mean, here's a man who has
served only one term as gover
nor. and was not all that popular
a governor at that, and suddenly
he is everybody's hero. You
know, "okay, I've taken this long
enough, but here comes my big
brother to knock your block off,
vou rich Northeastern estab-

lishment media liberals."
The Atlanta Journal and the
Atlanta Constitution — the only
papers of any importance in the
state, if not in the region — have
been fawning and gushing over
Carter all summer. He dominates

the front page. After his nomina
tion. every single story on the
front of the Constitution dealt
with Carter. Both papers have at
least two pages of Carter stories,
and countless Carter features,
inside every day.
The Sunday Magazine section
of the Journal Constitution de
voted the bulk of a recent issue to
Carter. The women's section ran
an entire page full of quotes from
his wife.
Now. all this isn't that strange

— except when you realize that
neither paper endorsed Carter
when he ran for governor in
1970, and both sniped at him
throughout his term.
Political opponents now call
themselves his old friends. He
has received massive black sup
port, despite his somewhat in
different record (claim some),
and charges during the cam
paign that he was in fact a racist.
(Some even charge that Carter
forces planted these rumors to
gain him votes.)
Now. these charges don't have
to be true; the point is, most of
those who made them have long
since abandoned them, in the
hope that a real son of Dixie will
at last be elected President.
Well, why not let the South
have its fling? The West (Nixon),
the rest of the South (Johnson),
the Northeast (Kennedy), and
the Midwest (Ford) have all had
their innings — and have pro
duced four of the most

militarily-oriented presidents in
the nation's history.
But I'm sorry — that'san issue,
and issues are apparently taboo
in Carter Country. People here
don't care whether Carter's
stands have conveniently
changed from audience to audi
ence.
They don't cotton to those
who charge that Carter's highest
priority is winning at any cost.
And they certainly don't ap
preciate those who would
charge Carter with being any
thing but an honest, forthright,
born-again Christian Sunday
School teacher.
What they care about is mainly
the chance to see one of their
own in the saddle, and the
chance to say, after all these
years, "We told you so."

lishment media liberals."
The Atlanta Journal and the
Atlanta Constitution — the only
papers of any importance in the
state, if not in the region — have
been fawning and gushing over
Carter all summer. He dominates

the front page. After his nomina
tion. every single story on the
front of the Constitution dealt
with Carter. Both papers have at
least two pages of Carter stories,
and countless Carter features,
inside every day.
The Sunday Magazine section
of the Journal Constitution de
voted the bulk of a recent issue to
Carter. The women's section ran
an entire page full of quotes from
his wife.
Now. all this isn't that strange

— except when you realize that
neither paper endorsed Carter
when he ran for governor in
1970, and both sniped at him
throughout his term.
Political opponents now call
themselves his old friends. He
has received massive black sup
port, despite his somewhat in
different record (claim some),
and charges during the cam
paign that he was in fact a racist.
(Some even charge that Carter
forces planted these rumors to
gain him votes.)
Now. these charges don't have
to be true; the point is, most of
those who made them have long
since abandoned them, in the
hope that a real son of Dixie will
at last be elected President.
Well, why not let the South
have its fling? The West (Nixon),
the rest of the South (Johnson),
the Northeast (Kennedy), and
the Midwest (Ford) have all had
their innings — and have pro
duced four of the most

militarily-oriented presidents in
the nation's history.
But I'm sorry — that'san issue,
and issues are apparently taboo
in Carter Country. People here
don't care whether Carter's
stands have conveniently
changed from audience to audi
ence.
They don't cotton to those
who charge that Carter's highest
priority is winning at any cost.
And they certainly don't ap
preciate those who would
charge Carter with being any
thing but an honest, forthright,
born-again Christian Sunday
School teacher.
What they care about is mainly
the chance to see one of their
own in the saddle, and the
chance to say, after all these
years, "We told you so."

ATLANTA, Ga.—The morn
ing after was a pretty heady time
for Georgians and other Deep
Southerners, so accustomed to
being lambasted by the Punitive
Pundits of the Deep North.
A simple. God-fearing, born
again Christian peanut farmer
from South Georgia had just
achieved every simple. God
fearing. Ghristian American
boy's dream come true — he had
received the nomination of the
Democratic Party for president
of the United States.
At last, the forces of evil — the
Brazen Browns, the Chastizing
Ghurches, the Useless lldalls —
had been halted and a new
crown prince would take his
place in the vanguard of history,
casting out the pagan Republi
cans, and ushering in, virtually
unaided, a new Ghristian era of
unity and peace and peanuts.
Or at least, that's what the
Georgians seem to think. Accus
tomed to being the butts of jokes
("Did you hear the one about the

hillbilly and the moonshine in
Okeefenokee Swamp?") or of
conventional wisdom ("Of
course, no Southerner could
ever be elected again"), these re
sidents of the Deep South have
been desperate for the chance to

prove themselves as good as —
no. better than — the ruling
clique (as they call it) in
America.
In James Earl Carter of Plains,
Ga.. they at last see their chance.
I mean, here's a man who has
served only one term as gover
nor. and was not all that popular
a governor at that, and suddenly
he is everybody's hero. You
know, "okay, I've taken this long
enough, but here comes my big
brother to knock your block off,
vou rich Northeastern estab-

lishment media liberals."
