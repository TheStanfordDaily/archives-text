# 'Up Close and Personal'
## Judges give ABC a 6 
### 
Midway through the Color and the Pageantry of
the XXI Olympic Cames in Montreal and ABC's
coverage of it, it seems like an appropriate time to
look back on the first week of television reporting.
ABC, "the network of the Olympics . . . the net
work that brought you Mexico City, Sapporo,
Grenoble, Munich. Innsbruck. . has saturated
the airwaves with scene after scene of sports
events from Canada.
The first few days of telecasts were exciting
enough until Nikolai Andrianov and his gymnas
tic opponents began to get boring, until 64 dives
off the platform all began to look the same — pike
or tuck — and before Clint Jackson. Sugar Ray
Leonard, Davey Armstrong, Howard Davis and all
the other I'nited States boxers began to seem like
cheap imitations of Muhammad Ali made in
Taiwan (the timely pun was irresistable) — while
Howard Cosell packed the nine-minute bouts
with fifteen minutes worth of talk.
In other words, there's been too much ot the
same this time around. It would be a welcome
change if ABC spent some of its next 35 hours of
coverage (out of 72 total hours) showing some
different sports. By its coverage, it's impossible to
know that there really is an Olympic sport called
team handball. Is soccer an Olympic sport? Field
hockey? Not at the Olympics, according to ABC.
Some of the individual announcers have made
deep impressions. Jim McKay, the anchorman,
sounds and looks very rushed in spots, but at least
he's changed out of that crusty, old sweater he
wore night after night in Innsbruck.
Bill Fleming, announcing the diving along with
Micki King, has taken a turn from the better away
from his ridiculous monologues on college foot

ball highlights. He's interesting to listen to, and
with the help of King, they're making diving a
little less boring. But not much.
Chris Schenkel, who has mercifully shed that
ridiculous tuxedo he wore in the winter, could
make any event boring — but sending him to
cover the bland equestrian events was almost un
forgiveable.
He is infinitely preferable, however, to the mot
ley threesome whose function must be to sedate
nervous viewers — Pierre Salinger, Jim Lampley
and the buffoonish Leßoy Nieman.
Regrettably, ABC has chosen to recast the
Olympics in its own image — the image of a
medium that makes sports out of insipid contests
(remember A/most Anything Goes?) and unen
durably dreary talkathons out of legitimate sports
like college football and Monday Night Baseball.
Commercials, overbearing pronouncements by
Mark Spitz, the latest dive, the latest "Up Close
and Personal," the latest brush-stroke by grinning
Leßoy, a half-minute of weight-lifting with the
always breathless Bob Beattie.becomes a dreary
formless mass — and seldom has so little memor
able sports footage beenpresentedin so much time.
Embarassingly enough for ABC, the most interest
ing aspect of the coverage has been the films on
Russian athletes made by the Soviet government.
Maybe expanding Olympic coverage to 72
hours in two weeks was an unwise move after all.
But if ABC can aim its cameras this week on more
different and exciting events, maybe you won't
notice the bland, talking heads on the screen after
all.

ley threesome whose function must be to sedate
nervous viewers — Pierre Salinger, Jim Lampley
and the buffoonish Leßoy Nieman.
Regrettably, ABC has chosen to recast the
Olympics in its own image — the image of a
medium that makes sports out of insipid contests
(remember A/most Anything Goes?) and unen
durably dreary talkathons out of legitimate sports
like college football and Monday Night Baseball.
Commercials, overbearing pronouncements by
Mark Spitz, the latest dive, the latest "Up Close
and Personal," the latest brush-stroke by grinning
Leßoy, a half-minute of weight-lifting with the
always breathless Bob Beattie.becomes a dreary
formless mass — and seldom has so little memor
able sports footage beenpresentedin so much time.
Embarassingly enough for ABC, the most interest
ing aspect of the coverage has been the films on
Russian athletes made by the Soviet government.
Maybe expanding Olympic coverage to 72
hours in two weeks was an unwise move after all.
But if ABC can aim its cameras this week on more
different and exciting events, maybe you won't
notice the bland, talking heads on the screen after
all.

Midway through the Color and the Pageantry of
the XXI Olympic Cames in Montreal and ABC's
coverage of it, it seems like an appropriate time to
look back on the first week of television reporting.
ABC, "the network of the Olympics . . . the net
work that brought you Mexico City, Sapporo,
Grenoble, Munich. Innsbruck. . has saturated
the airwaves with scene after scene of sports
events from Canada.
The first few days of telecasts were exciting
enough until Nikolai Andrianov and his gymnas
tic opponents began to get boring, until 64 dives
off the platform all began to look the same — pike
or tuck — and before Clint Jackson. Sugar Ray
Leonard, Davey Armstrong, Howard Davis and all
the other I'nited States boxers began to seem like
cheap imitations of Muhammad Ali made in
Taiwan (the timely pun was irresistable) — while
Howard Cosell packed the nine-minute bouts
with fifteen minutes worth of talk.
In other words, there's been too much ot the
same this time around. It would be a welcome
change if ABC spent some of its next 35 hours of
coverage (out of 72 total hours) showing some
different sports. By its coverage, it's impossible to
know that there really is an Olympic sport called
team handball. Is soccer an Olympic sport? Field
hockey? Not at the Olympics, according to ABC.
Some of the individual announcers have made
deep impressions. Jim McKay, the anchorman,
sounds and looks very rushed in spots, but at least
he's changed out of that crusty, old sweater he
wore night after night in Innsbruck.
Bill Fleming, announcing the diving along with
Micki King, has taken a turn from the better away
from his ridiculous monologues on college foot

ball highlights. He's interesting to listen to, and
with the help of King, they're making diving a
little less boring. But not much.
Chris Schenkel, who has mercifully shed that
ridiculous tuxedo he wore in the winter, could
make any event boring — but sending him to
cover the bland equestrian events was almost un
forgiveable.
He is infinitely preferable, however, to the mot
ley threesome whose function must be to sedate
nervous viewers — Pierre Salinger, Jim Lampley
