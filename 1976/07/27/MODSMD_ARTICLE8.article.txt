# Root for East Germany in Olympics
## 
### Chris Baker 
"An honorable and fair strug
gle awakens the best virtues in
man. It does not separate; on the
contrary, it binds the contestants
together in mutual understand
ing and equal respect. It all
serves to strengthen the bonds of
freedom between nations. For
this reason may the Olympic
flame never die out." -Adolf Hi
tler at the opening ceremonies of
the 1936 Olympics.

Except for Nadia Comaneci
and a few other stars of the 1976
Summer Olympics, all the other
athletes might as well be named
John or Wendy Smith. Besides
the exploits of the few media
stars who have emerged from
these games, the most interest
ing thing is the "unofficial"
medal standings which appear
in the newspapers everyday.
Last Sunday one Bay Area
newspaper heralded Saturday's
disastrous day of competition for
the U.S. track team with a banner
headline. The medal race has re
placed the presidential race; at
least for two weeks.
Maybe Olympic gold medal
winner Mac Wilkins was on the
right track when he said he
hoped East Germany won every
thing in track and field. Wilkins
isn't a member of the communist
party. He was simply criticizing
this country, for not supporting
its athletes like some Eastern
European countries.
'Did it alone'
Wilkins was forced to quit his
job as a school teacher two years
ago to train for the Olympics.

"America is not a bad country,
but I've done it alone," he said
after winning the discus.
East German swimmer Kor
nelia Ender told an interviewer
she could not imagine training
in any situation except one in
which everything is taken care.
The U.S. Olympic Committee,
with it's luxurious office in New
York, operates on a shoestring
budget. It cannot afford to sub
sidize the training of athletes as
Eastern European sports federa
tions do.
But vou can bet that if the U.S.

"loses" the Olympics, people
will react as if we just lost the
arms race. The Olympic Games
are a thing of the past, it's the
Olympic War Games.
And many of the athletes
competing from other countries
were trained at the expense of
U.S. taxpayers at state colleges.
Some of these athletes made
schools like UTEP into national
track powers and have now re
turned home to turn their coun
tries into track powers.
And once the American
athlete is out of college he must

somehow travel to competitions
while maintaining his status as
an amateur. The amount of train
ing required of world-class
athletes makes it impossible to
hold a full-time job.
Beggars
In this country, he is forced to
go begging. And athletic equip
ment manufactures are only too
happy to oblige. Some athletes,
like Wilkins and shot putter Al
Fuerbach, pool their resources
and train together.
While other countries have
their best athletes in Montreal

we have lefl people like Steve
Williams at home. The selection
process used by the U.S. in track
and field is absurd.
The Olympic track trials may
help some unknown athlete
make it to the Games. But if. in
Williams' case, you injure your
self it's all over.
Maybe we should root for the
Russians or the East Germans. It
they win then perhaps this coun
try will wake up. But probably
not. The Moscow Games may be
even more glorious than the re
volution.

freedom between nations. For
this reason may the Olympic
flame never die out." -Adolf Hi
tler at the opening ceremonies of
the 1936 Olympics.

Except for Nadia Comaneci
and a few other stars of the 1976
Summer Olympics, all the other
athletes might as well be named
John or Wendy Smith. Besides
the exploits of the few media
stars who have emerged from
these games, the most interest
ing thing is the "unofficial"
medal standings which appear
in the newspapers everyday.
Last Sunday one Bay Area
newspaper heralded Saturday's
disastrous day of competition for
the U.S. track team with a banner
headline. The medal race has re
placed the presidential race; at
least for two weeks.
Maybe Olympic gold medal
winner Mac Wilkins was on the
right track when he said he
hoped East Germany won every
thing in track and field. Wilkins
isn't a member of the communist
party. He was simply criticizing
this country, for not supporting
its athletes like some Eastern
European countries.
'Did it alone'
Wilkins was forced to quit his
job as a school teacher two years
ago to train for the Olympics.

"America is not a bad country,
but I've done it alone," he said
after winning the discus.
East German swimmer Kor
nelia Ender told an interviewer
she could not imagine training
in any situation except one in
which everything is taken care.
The U.S. Olympic Committee,
with it's luxurious office in New
York, operates on a shoestring
budget. It cannot afford to sub
sidize the training of athletes as
Eastern European sports federa
tions do.
But vou can bet that if the U.S.

"loses" the Olympics, people
will react as if we just lost the
arms race. The Olympic Games
are a thing of the past, it's the
Olympic War Games.
And many of the athletes
competing from other countries
were trained at the expense of
U.S. taxpayers at state colleges.
Some of these athletes made
schools like UTEP into national
track powers and have now re
turned home to turn their coun
tries into track powers.
And once the American
athlete is out of college he must

somehow travel to competitions
while maintaining his status as
an amateur. The amount of train
ing required of world-class
athletes makes it impossible to
hold a full-time job.
Beggars
In this country, he is forced to
go begging. And athletic equip
ment manufactures are only too
happy to oblige. Some athletes,
like Wilkins and shot putter Al
Fuerbach, pool their resources
and train together.
While other countries have
their best athletes in Montreal

we have lefl people like Steve
Williams at home. The selection
process used by the U.S. in track
and field is absurd.
The Olympic track trials may
help some unknown athlete
make it to the Games. But if. in
Williams' case, you injure your
self it's all over.
Maybe we should root for the
Russians or the East Germans. It
they win then perhaps this coun
try will wake up. But probably
not. The Moscow Games may be
even more glorious than the re
volution.


Steve Williams " D * l, "" J '°°' k "
"An honorable and fair strug
gle awakens the best virtues in
man. It does not separate; on the
contrary, it binds the contestants
together in mutual understand
ing and equal respect. It all
serves to strengthen the bonds of
freedom between nations. For
this reason may the Olympic
flame never die out." -Adolf Hi
