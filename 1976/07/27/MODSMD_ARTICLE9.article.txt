Rinconoda Avenue, Rinconada
Park, Rinconoda Annex, Rin
conoda Apartments, Rinconoda
Masters Swim Club, Rinconoda
Country Club . . . perhaps you
sense the pattern. As a former
resident of Rinconada Hall, I
ivould be fascinated to discover
the source of the name Rin
conoda. Surely there must be
some great explorer, hero, town
or pervert in California history
by that name. What's the story?
-DA.
Since our polyglottish staff is
virtually fluent in Spanish, we
assumed that Rinconada had
only its literal meaning — "in
the corner." We were wrong.
Rinconada is the name of the
large ranch that once included
most of downtown Palo Alto —
Rancho Rinconada del San
Francisquito, or "Ranch at the
Bend of the San Francisquito

Creek." This ranch, one of the
Spanish land .Hints, was first
given to Maria Louisa Soto
(another familiar name) and pas
sed down final Iv to a guy named
Henry Cric
It was fii ler that Leland
Stanford !' a go-between
named I imutliy Hopkins)
bought part i the Rancho Rin
conada so that he could start a
little town to go along with his
brand-new Univer Ity. Origi
nally known as Uni\ ersity Park,
the place is now Palo Alto.
All our information came from

the I'alo Alto Historical Society,
spe tically Georgiana Kjerulff.
However, should you crave
further info on th great ranches,
try reading Ralph Rambo's
Ranchos of Santa Clara County.
How about giving us a rundown
on what the salaries are for stu
dents in the ASSU? Specifically,
how much does the Student Fi
nancial Manager, members of
the Council of Presidents, pro
ject managers, and the Senate
Chairman get? -G.E.L.
No sooner asked than done.
Chris Mathe, financial manager,
provided us with the following
figures for 1976-77, presented
here (using remarkable restraint)
completely without comment:

—Financial Manager — $6993
plus $1350 tuition grant;
—COP members — $3600 di
vided by the number of people,
plus same tuition grant as above;
—Senate chairman — $1125;
—project managers — salary
negotiable, generally between
$100-$l5O per month.

I'd like to comment on the in
quiry about the Orange Capri

("Bug Me," July 20). This person
must request a loading permit
four times a year because he has
been parking in that "reserv ed
space since last year. I haven't
seen this person unload any
thing but his own load. I'm sur
prised the Police Department
hands out permits so easily,
since I was under the impression
that loading and unloading
zones had a time limit-I.R.A.
The folks at the Police De
partment were under the same
impression. In fact, they would
appreciate it if you would con
tact them regarding the car.
Whoever owns the vehicle is de
finitely abusing his privilege,
and they aren't happy about it.
