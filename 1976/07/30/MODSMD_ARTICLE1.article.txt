Two groups of summer vis
itors will remember their stays at
Stanford with souvenir T-shirts
which say "I Slept On The Farm:
Olympic Sleeping Team."
Sleeping at Lambda Nu, the
visitors are participating in sleep
research experiments. Both the
Stanford Sleep Disorders Sum
mer Clinic and the summer In
somnia Project are being held at
the house.
The Sleep Disorders Clinic,
directed by William Dement,
noted sleep researcher and pro
fessor of psychiatry, and Thomas
Anders, head of pediatric
psychiatry at the Stanford Medi
cal School, is studying sleep
disorders in children and inves
tigating what effect the disorders
may have on children's educa
tion. This project is one of the
first investigations of children's
sleeping behavior.
The Summer Insomnia Project
is testing a new sleeping pill
produced by a pharmaceutical
company. Six adults who comp
lain of chronic insomnia are par
ticipating in the study.
Six groups
Six groups of four children,
ages 10-13, are participating in
the sleep disorders study. Most
of the children have no sleeping
problems. By studying them re
searchers will be able to define
normal sleeping behavior and

compare it with the behavior of
children who have sleep disor
ders.
Children stay at the clinic,
which has been nicknamed "The
Summer Sleep Camp," for six
days. When they are asleep, a
machine monitors their different
physiological behaviors. The
polygraph machine records
EEGs, eye movements, muscle
tone and respiration.
During the day the children
take tests and fill out question
naires. They take performance
tests involving addition,
word-memory and listening
skills three times a day. Every
half hour they fill out a ques
tionnaire. In addition to these
tasks, the children take six 20-
minute naps each day.
When they are not being
tested, the children are kept en
tertained with a variety of games
and activities. They can play
with board games, sports
equipment and musical instru
ments at Lambda Nu. Some leave
the house to go bowling at Tre
sidder. Children interested in
music bring their instruments
and hold jam sessions.
Birthday party
Staff members do all they can
to make the children's six days
enjoyable. They prepare all the
meals at Lambda Nu, cooking
the children's favorite foods.
When thev found out that one

girl would have a birthday while
she was at the clinic, the staff
threw her a surprise party, com
plete with cake and presents.
"The sleep camp must have
the highest staff/camper ratio
ever," said Mary Carskadon, re
search assistant supervising the
summer sleep laboratory.

monitoring. The project, one of two sleep research programs being held at Lambda Nu, is a test of a new
sleeping pill.
