A head-on bus collision. Dozens of
wounded children. Firemen and paramedics
rushing to the scene. The entire Stanford
Medical Center on alert.
The worst disaster in Palo Alto history?
Nope. It's all part of the plan. The buses are
imaginary. One child has had a wound

painted ori, another has been told to "go into
convulsions," a third is instructed to "be un
conscious."
The result? The Stanford and Palo Alto
medical and emergency facilities took the
"Disaster Simulation Drill" very seriously,
and the kids had a great time playing dead.
