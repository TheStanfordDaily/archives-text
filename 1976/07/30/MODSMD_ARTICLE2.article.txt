# Delts suspended in trashing case
## 
### Ron Beck 
Five students were suspended
Tuesday by President Richard
Lyman for their participation in
the Delta Tau Delta campus dis
ruptions on May 19.
Four of the students received
one-quarter suspensions, with
the option of choosing which
quarter during the 1976-77
academic year each will take off.
All of the four are varsity
athletes, and, because of the tim
ing option, will still be able to
play during their sport's season.
The four are:
—Gary Anderson, senior, a
second-string guard on last sea
son's football team;
—Mark Hill, junior, a
scheduled starter at center on the
football team and a shot-putter
on the track squad;
—George Schader, senior, a
starting forward on the basket
ball team; and
—Rich Waters, senior, a start
ing football safety last season.
Senior Todd Anderson, who
used up his athletic eligibility
last season as the football team's
starting center, was suspended
for the entire 1976-77
academic year. He is 17 units
short of graduating.
A sixth student charged in the
case, senior Mike Wilkinson, re
ceived a one-quarter suspension,
but Lyman suspended the pen
alty and imposed an 80-hour
work fine as punishment. Wil

kinson was a second-string
noseguard on the football team
last season.
S)C recommendation
Before Lyman made the final
decision, the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) had recommended
that each student except Wilkin
son and Todd Anderson receive
two-quarter suspensions that
would start fall quarter.
In the text of his decision.
Lyman said that, "the penalties
recommended by the SJC as to
(all but Todd Anderson) go
somewhat beyond what is re
quired to emphasize the seri
ousness of the offences in ques
tion."
The six students admitted
they had violated the Universi
ty's Fundamental Standard. The
students' appeal, handled by at
torney Joseph Mell, was based
on an individual responsibility
defense, rather than collective
guilt. According to the text of
Lyman's decision, however, the
advice of the SJC to judge the
defendants in "the context in
which these events occurred"
was followed.
Potential harm
"The SJC has accurately de
scribed the dangerousness, the
potential for far more serious
harm that was done that night, of
this kind of proceeding, regard
less of the extent of pre-planning
or initial malicious intent,"

harm that was done that night, of
this kind of proceeding, regard
less of the extent of pre-planning
or initial malicious intent,"
Lyman said.
Therefore, the misdeeds per
petrated by the defendantswere
judged with the knowledge that
31 Delta Tau Delta members and
friends raided and caused dam
age to at least one other fraternity
after a bachelor party.
Additionally, according to the
five-page decision, Lyman dis
agreed with Mell's contention
that "the defendants' activities
were relatively innocuous."
"I cannot agree with that esti
mation," Lyman wrote. "Rather,
I find persuasive the (SJC's re
commendation) statement that
'the context in which these
events occurred is crucial.' "
Lyman dealt with the stu
dents' athletic standing:
"Student-athletes must not gain
special privilege or dispensation
not available to student non
athletes. I believe that student
athletes should be treated
exactly like other students."
Choice of quarter
"It is the case, however, that in
nine instances over the past two
years, a student convicted of a
breach of student disciplinary
regulations and sentenced to a
quarter's suspension has been
given his/her choice of the quar
ter in which the suspension
would be applied," he said.
"The practice has troublesome
implications, however, if it is
applied selectively and without
general criteria that can be in
volved.
"I would like here to suggest
that the most effective way to as
sure equity, in the sense of pro
ducing penalities that will mean
the same tiling to all who suffer
them, will be to allow a reasona
ble choice of the period of sus
pension (usually excluding
summer quarter) for all con
victed offenders except those

whose offenses are so threaten
ing to the community that they
ought to involve immediate or
protracted separation from the
Universiy."
Important principle
Prof. Jonathan D. Casper, fa
culty co-chairman of the SJC,
said that, "the principle that
there's no particular advantage
given to athletes is important."
"Speaking for myself, I think
that if the case came to (the SJC)
next week subsequent to the pol
icy (of choosing which quarter to
accept suspension), we
would've reached essentially the
same decision," he said.
Lyman said that his reduction
of the SJC recommendation was
an instance of "honest minds"
clashing "as to the severity and
dimensions of the penalties
necessary to (show the gravity of
the offences)."
"I trust that it will be clear
from this case that behavior of
the kind exhibited by the defen
dants will be met with meaning
ful penalties at Stanford, what
ever may be the alleged force of
"tradition" in its favor," he said.

—George Schader, senior, a
starting forward on the basket
ball team; and
—Rich Waters, senior, a start
ing football safety last season.
Senior Todd Anderson, who
used up his athletic eligibility
last season as the football team's
starting center, was suspended
for the entire 1976-77
academic year. He is 17 units
short of graduating.
A sixth student charged in the
case, senior Mike Wilkinson, re
ceived a one-quarter suspension,
but Lyman suspended the pen
alty and imposed an 80-hour
work fine as punishment. Wil

kinson was a second-string
noseguard on the football team
last season.
S)C recommendation
Before Lyman made the final
decision, the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) had recommended
that each student except Wilkin
son and Todd Anderson receive
two-quarter suspensions that
would start fall quarter.
In the text of his decision.
Lyman said that, "the penalties
recommended by the SJC as to
(all but Todd Anderson) go
somewhat beyond what is re
quired to emphasize the seri
ousness of the offences in ques
tion."
The six students admitted
they had violated the Universi
ty's Fundamental Standard. The
students' appeal, handled by at
torney Joseph Mell, was based
on an individual responsibility
defense, rather than collective
guilt. According to the text of
Lyman's decision, however, the
advice of the SJC to judge the
defendants in "the context in
which these events occurred"
was followed.
Potential harm
"The SJC has accurately de
scribed the dangerousness, the
potential for far more serious
harm that was done that night, of
this kind of proceeding, regard
less of the extent of pre-planning
or initial malicious intent,"
Lyman said.
Therefore, the misdeeds per
petrated by the defendantswere
judged with the knowledge that
31 Delta Tau Delta members and
friends raided and caused dam
age to at least one other fraternity
after a bachelor party.
Additionally, according to the
five-page decision, Lyman dis
agreed with Mell's contention
that "the defendants' activities
were relatively innocuous."
"I cannot agree with that esti
mation," Lyman wrote. "Rather,
I find persuasive the (SJC's re
commendation) statement that
'the context in which these
events occurred is crucial.' "
Lyman dealt with the stu
dents' athletic standing:
"Student-athletes must not gain
special privilege or dispensation
not available to student non
athletes. I believe that student
athletes should be treated
exactly like other students."
Choice of quarter
"It is the case, however, that in
nine instances over the past two
years, a student convicted of a
breach of student disciplinary
regulations and sentenced to a
quarter's suspension has been
given his/her choice of the quar
ter in which the suspension
would be applied," he said.
"The practice has troublesome
implications, however, if it is
applied selectively and without
general criteria that can be in
volved.
"I would like here to suggest
that the most effective way to as
sure equity, in the sense of pro
ducing penalities that will mean
the same tiling to all who suffer
them, will be to allow a reasona
ble choice of the period of sus
pension (usually excluding
summer quarter) for all con
victed offenders except those

whose offenses are so threaten
ing to the community that they
ought to involve immediate or
protracted separation from the
Universiy."
Important principle
Prof. Jonathan D. Casper, fa
culty co-chairman of the SJC,
said that, "the principle that
there's no particular advantage
given to athletes is important."
"Speaking for myself, I think
that if the case came to (the SJC)
next week subsequent to the pol
icy (of choosing which quarter to
accept suspension), we
would've reached essentially the
same decision," he said.
Lyman said that his reduction
of the SJC recommendation was
an instance of "honest minds"
clashing "as to the severity and
dimensions of the penalties
necessary to (show the gravity of
the offences)."
"I trust that it will be clear
from this case that behavior of
the kind exhibited by the defen
dants will be met with meaning
ful penalties at Stanford, what
ever may be the alleged force of
"tradition" in its favor," he said.
Five students were suspended
Tuesday by President Richard
Lyman for their participation in
the Delta Tau Delta campus dis
ruptions on May 19.
Four of the students received
one-quarter suspensions, with
the option of choosing which
quarter during the 1976-77
academic year each will take off.
All of the four are varsity
athletes, and, because of the tim
ing option, will still be able to
play during their sport's season.
The four are:
—Gary Anderson, senior, a
second-string guard on last sea
son's football team;
—Mark Hill, junior, a
scheduled starter at center on the
football team and a shot-putter
on the track squad;
—George Schader, senior, a
starting forward on the basket
ball team; and
—Rich Waters, senior, a start

decision, the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) had recommended
that each student except Wilkin
son and Todd Anderson receive
two-quarter suspensions that
would start fall quarter.
In the text of his decision.
Lyman said that, "the penalties
recommended by the SJC as to
(all but Todd Anderson) go
somewhat beyond what is re
quired to emphasize the seri
ousness of the offences in ques
tion."
The six students admitted
they had violated the Universi
ty's Fundamental Standard. The
students' appeal, handled by at
torney Joseph Mell, was based
on an individual responsibility
defense, rather than collective
guilt. According to the text of
Lyman's decision, however, the
advice of the SJC to judge the
defendants in "the context in
which these events occurred"
was followed.
Potential harm
"The SJC has accurately de
scribed the dangerousness, the
potential for far more serious
harm that was done that night, of
this kind of proceeding, regard
less of the extent of pre-planning
or initial malicious intent,"
Lyman said.
Therefore, the misdeeds per
petrated by the defendantswere
judged with the knowledge that
31 Delta Tau Delta members and
friends raided and caused dam
age to at least one other fraternity
after a bachelor party.
Additionally, according to the
five-page decision, Lyman dis
agreed with Mell's contention
that "the defendants' activities
were relatively innocuous."
"I cannot agree with that esti
mation," Lyman wrote. "Rather,
I find persuasive the (SJC's re
commendation) statement that
'the context in which these
events occurred is crucial.' "
Lyman dealt with the stu
dents' athletic standing:
"Student-athletes must not gain
special privilege or dispensation
not available to student non
athletes. I believe that student
athletes should be treated
exactly like other students."
Choice of quarter
"It is the case, however, that in
nine instances over the past two
years, a student convicted of a
breach of student disciplinary
regulations and sentenced to a
quarter's suspension has been
given his/her choice of the quar
ter in which the suspension
would be applied," he said.
"The practice has troublesome
implications, however, if it is
applied selectively and without
general criteria that can be in
volved.
"I would like here to suggest
that the most effective way to as
sure equity, in the sense of pro
ducing penalities that will mean
the same tiling to all who suffer
them, will be to allow a reasona
ble choice of the period of sus
pension (usually excluding
summer quarter) for all con
victed offenders except those

whose offenses are so threaten
ing to the community that they
ought to involve immediate or
protracted separation from the
Universiy."
Important principle
Prof. Jonathan D. Casper, fa
culty co-chairman of the SJC,
said that, "the principle that
there's no particular advantage
given to athletes is important."
"Speaking for myself, I think
that if the case came to (the SJC)
next week subsequent to the pol
icy (of choosing which quarter to
accept suspension), we
would've reached essentially the
same decision," he said.
Lyman said that his reduction
of the SJC recommendation was
an instance of "honest minds"
clashing "as to the severity and
dimensions of the penalties
necessary to (show the gravity of
the offences)."
"I trust that it will be clear
from this case that behavior of
the kind exhibited by the defen
dants will be met with meaning
ful penalties at Stanford, what
ever may be the alleged force of
"tradition" in its favor," he said.
