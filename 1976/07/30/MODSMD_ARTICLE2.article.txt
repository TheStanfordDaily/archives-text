# Delts suspended in trashing case
## 
### Ron Beck 
Five students were suspended
Tuesday by President Richard
Lyman for their participation in
the Delta Tau Delta campus dis
ruptions on May 19.
Four of the students received
one-quarter suspensions, with
the option of choosing which
quarter during the 1976-77
academic year each will take off.
All of the four are varsity
athletes, and, because of the tim
ing option, will still be able to
play during their sport's season.
The four are:
—Gary Anderson, senior, a
second-string guard on last sea
son's football team;
—Mark Hill, junior, a
scheduled starter at center on the
football team and a shot-putter
on the track squad;
—George Schader, senior, a
starting forward on the basket
ball team; and
—Rich Waters, senior, a start
ing football safety last season.
Senior Todd Anderson, who
used up his athletic eligibility
last season as the football team's
starting center, was suspended
for the entire 1976-77
academic year. He is 17 units
short of graduating.
A sixth student charged in the
case, senior Mike Wilkinson, re
ceived a one-quarter suspension,
but Lyman suspended the pen
alty and imposed an 80-hour
work fine as punishment. Wil

kinson was a second-string
noseguard on the football team
last season.
S)C recommendation
Before Lyman made the final
decision, the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) had recommended
that each student except Wilkin
son and Todd Anderson receive
two-quarter suspensions that
would start fall quarter.
In the text of his decision.
Lyman said that, "the penalties
recommended by the SJC as to
(all but Todd Anderson) go
somewhat beyond what is re
quired to emphasize the seri
ousness of the offences in ques
tion."
The six students admitted
they had violated the Universi
ty's Fundamental Standard. The
students' appeal, handled by at
torney Joseph Mell, was based
on an individual responsibility
defense, rather than collective
guilt. According to the text of
Lyman's decision, however, the
advice of the SJC to judge the
defendants in "the context in
which these events occurred"
was followed.
Potential harm
"The SJC has accurately de
scribed the dangerousness, the
potential for far more serious
harm that was done that night, of
this kind of proceeding, regard
less of the extent of pre-planning
or initial malicious intent,"
