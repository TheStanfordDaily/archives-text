## 'Yes' has crowd rocking in S.F. 
### Rick Brand 
The Yes- Gentle Giant concert
last week at the Cow Palace
could best be described as a les
son on the dos and don'ts of rock
and roll.
While both groups used the
same types of instruments and
styles, all similarity ended there.
Yes was suberb in almost every
department, while Gentle Giant
was on the opposite end of the
spectrum.
Yes started off their set with a
selection from the album Close
to the Edge , and instantly got
the crowd going. With the aid of
an electric Chinatown-like dra
gon suspended overhead and
some interesting laser lights, Yes
launched into their unique
intelligensia-type rock.
"Sound Chaser" from the Re
layer album was the next tune.
Yes amazed the crowd with a
flawless presentation of the
studio version of the song. Jon
Anderson, who did little on the
rhythm guitar, was nonetheless a
great asset with his near-perfect
vocals.
Instrumental excellence
Turning now to acoustical
equipment, Yes played another
impeccable song, which possi
bly was the best of the night, "I
Seen All Good People." Not only
was their instrumental work ex
cellent, but the three-man har
mony of Jon Anderson, Chris
Squire and Steve Howe was
exhilarating.
The problem that Yes now
faced was not unlike that of
gymnast Nadia Comaneciâ€”after
getting three perfect scores
what do you do next?
What Yes chose to do was
another selection from Relaver,
"The Gates of Delerium." Al

though certainly not one of their
more famous songs from their
repertoire. Yes did a good job of
another difficult piece of pro
duce.
The next part of the show was
a time for some solo work. Pat
rick Moraz, who replaced the
departed Rick Wakeman on
keyboards and synthesizers,
started off. During the preceding
songs he had filled in admirably
for Wakeman, but now that he
was on his own that certainly
changed. Moraz' synthesizer
work sounded melodramatic
and forced. One couldn't help
but visualize what Wakeman
would have been doing during
this time, and any comparison
between the two would have
been a joke.
Steve Howe, who had all night
been playing some fine electric
guitar riffs, now came on stage
and gave the crowd quite a sur
prise. He plucked and strummed
a country music style solo on the
acoustic guitar, a remarkable
change from what had pre
ceeded.
Closing numbers
Yes closed out its set with
two more selections, "Heart of
the Sunrise" and "Ritual."
The inevitable encores fol
lowed, and as everyone could
have guessed, "Roundabout"
was the choice. However, the
group cleverly disguised the
opening few bars to keep the
crowd in suspense for just a
