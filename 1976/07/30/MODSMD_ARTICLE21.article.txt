# Gorshin offers sparkling show in Venetian Room
## 
### Perry Simon 
If you have one special night
to go "bucks up." try spending it
at the Fairmont Hotel's elegant
Venetian Room in San Fran
cisco. The dancing is divine, the
cuisine magnificent and the en
tertainment consistently first
rate.
As to the latter ingredient, the
Venetian room is currently pre
senting the talented singer
comedian-impressionist, Frank
Gorshin, through August 4. On
opening night, Gorshin offered
his warmly-receptive audience a
potpourri of comic vignettes that
made fine use of his multiple ta
lents.
Gorshin's repertoire ranged
from suave vocal renditions of
standard night club fare to clas
sic stand-up comic soliloquies.
Although Gorshin's abilities in
these areas were admirable, they
would not be strong enough to
carry his entire act. Fortunately
for Gorshin, and for us, they do
not have to.
Frank Gorshin is indeed an
impressionist extraordinaire,
and the material between his
impressionist routines amounts
to extremely pleasant filler. Gor
shin's act thrives on his imper
sonations, and his many years of
entertainment experience have
clearly taught him how to mix
these routines into his act with
maximum effectiveness.
Beginning his show with a
medley of songs varying in
tempo from mellow MOR to up
beat rhythms, Gorshin's voice
ranged like a slide trombone
throughout his extensive vocal
register. He then launched into
his comic material by telling the
audience, "It's always so nice to
be back again close to Daly City."

A rapid fire soliloquy fol
lowed in which Gorshin expres
sed the trials and tribulations of
being an impressionist. For
example, "I go to a psychiatrist
and he charges me for group
therapy."
But soon it came time for Gor
shin to start in on his varied as
sortment of impressions, and
once he did he was smart enough

to keep all other material to a
minimum. Gorshin mimics his
subjects in their totality includ
ing the facial and body charac
teristics.
His repertory was divided into
independent routines, within
which he would perform multi
ple impressions. For instance,
one "Western" routine pitted
Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster
against Marlon Brando and Rod
Steiger in a gun-slinging shoot
out.
In all of these routines, Gor
shin's impressions are shock
ingly realistic, but even more
importantly, his lines are witty
and humorous.
In Gorshin's suite after the
show, he expressed some con
cern about the audience reaction
to a few new insertions into his
act. But given Gorshin's multi
ple talents and the splendid
showcase in which they were
being displayed, he may rest as
sured that his act is a winner.

his warmly-receptive audience a
potpourri of comic vignettes that
made fine use of his multiple ta
lents.
Gorshin's repertoire ranged
from suave vocal renditions of
standard night club fare to clas
sic stand-up comic soliloquies.
Although Gorshin's abilities in
these areas were admirable, they
would not be strong enough to
carry his entire act. Fortunately
for Gorshin, and for us, they do
not have to.
Frank Gorshin is indeed an
impressionist extraordinaire,
and the material between his
impressionist routines amounts
to extremely pleasant filler. Gor
shin's act thrives on his imper
sonations, and his many years of
entertainment experience have
clearly taught him how to mix
these routines into his act with
maximum effectiveness.
Beginning his show with a
medley of songs varying in
tempo from mellow MOR to up
beat rhythms, Gorshin's voice
ranged like a slide trombone
throughout his extensive vocal
register. He then launched into
his comic material by telling the
audience, "It's always so nice to
be back again close to Daly City."

A rapid fire soliloquy fol
lowed in which Gorshin expres
sed the trials and tribulations of
being an impressionist. For
example, "I go to a psychiatrist
and he charges me for group
therapy."
But soon it came time for Gor
shin to start in on his varied as
sortment of impressions, and
once he did he was smart enough

to keep all other material to a
minimum. Gorshin mimics his
subjects in their totality includ
ing the facial and body charac
teristics.
His repertory was divided into
independent routines, within
which he would perform multi
ple impressions. For instance,
one "Western" routine pitted
Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster
against Marlon Brando and Rod
Steiger in a gun-slinging shoot
out.
In all of these routines, Gor
shin's impressions are shock
ingly realistic, but even more
importantly, his lines are witty
and humorous.
In Gorshin's suite after the
show, he expressed some con
cern about the audience reaction
to a few new insertions into his
act. But given Gorshin's multi
ple talents and the splendid
showcase in which they were
being displayed, he may rest as
sured that his act is a winner.

If you have one special night
to go "bucks up." try spending it
at the Fairmont Hotel's elegant
Venetian Room in San Fran
cisco. The dancing is divine, the
cuisine magnificent and the en
tertainment consistently first
rate.
As to the latter ingredient, the
Venetian room is currently pre
senting the talented singer
comedian-impressionist, Frank
Gorshin, through August 4. On
opening night, Gorshin offered
his warmly-receptive audience a
