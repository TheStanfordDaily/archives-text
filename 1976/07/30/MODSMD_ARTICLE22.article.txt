# 'Picnic' a challenging success
## 
### Jan Miller 
"Picnic," which opened last
Sunday night in Foothill Col
lege's Summerepertory '76 sea
son, was no picnic for the
talented cast, who performed
with great zest and profes
sionalism the difficult drama by
William Inge.
As the wayfaring Hal Carter is
thrown into the lives of several
small town American women,
forcing them to redefine them
selves and their sexuality, "Pic
nic" itself is a comet thrown into
the Summerepertory '76 reper
toire of melodrama, slapstick
and genuine comedy, forcing the
troupe to perform to their fullest
capabilities.
Like Hal, who inadvertently
affects all of the women he
meets, so it is that the Sum
merepertory cast affects their
•audience.
The action takes place in the
joint backyards of two women in
a little more than a 24 hour
period. Inge's first act moves
slowly, gradually introducing
the characters to the audience,
but the pace and the drama pick
up significantly in the second
and final acts.
Believable portrayals
All of the company carried off
their parts with fine finesse.
Bruce Anderson as ex-football
hero Hal Carter successfully
combines the required
stereotypical animal nature with
sensitivity and blatant openness
that wins him Madge Owens.
The beautiful Madge Owens,
torn inside by her fondness of

the familiarity of her small town
home and her desire to break
loose and escape her defined
role, is capably played by Caro
lyn Keith.
Linda Piccone is her plain but
talented and appropriately
awkward little sister Millie
Owens, and Toni Tomei has sev
eral challenging scenes that she
handles with skill and mastery
as the girls' overprotective
mother, Flo Owens.
Marjorie Ross is stupendous as
the desperate school teacher
Rosemary Sydney, as is Charlie
Jaschob as Howard Bevans, her

skeptical boyfriend.
Sweet, generous Helen Potts is
acted by Peg Meyers, and
Madge's beau, the ivy-league
fraternity man Alan Seymour is
done righteously by Robert Ch
ase.
The two schoolteachers,
played by Martha Brumbaugh
and Jane Sanders are fortunately
not over-acted and add a wel
come touch of comedy to the
dramatic tone of the show.
Imaginative direction
Director Jeffrey D. Mason de
serves the majority of the
plaudits, as his staging is drama

tic and actively involves the au
dience by having the characters
parade to and from center stage
via the main aisle of the small
theatre.
Mason chose his cast well
also, with ideal juxtaposition of
the characters. By isolating these
pairs throughout various scenes,
the characters themselves be
come more dynamic.
Lighting by Kevin Boog
catches the mood of the show
well, and costumes by Doyne
Mraz are perfect in keeping with
the 1952 era.

Like Hal, who inadvertently
affects all of the women he
meets, so it is that the Sum
merepertory cast affects their
•audience.
The action takes place in the
joint backyards of two women in
a little more than a 24 hour
period. Inge's first act moves
slowly, gradually introducing
the characters to the audience,
but the pace and the drama pick
up significantly in the second
and final acts.
Believable portrayals
All of the company carried off
their parts with fine finesse.
Bruce Anderson as ex-football
hero Hal Carter successfully
combines the required
stereotypical animal nature with
sensitivity and blatant openness
that wins him Madge Owens.
The beautiful Madge Owens,
torn inside by her fondness of

the familiarity of her small town
home and her desire to break
loose and escape her defined
role, is capably played by Caro
lyn Keith.
Linda Piccone is her plain but
talented and appropriately
awkward little sister Millie
Owens, and Toni Tomei has sev
eral challenging scenes that she
handles with skill and mastery
as the girls' overprotective
mother, Flo Owens.
Marjorie Ross is stupendous as
the desperate school teacher
Rosemary Sydney, as is Charlie
Jaschob as Howard Bevans, her

skeptical boyfriend.
Sweet, generous Helen Potts is
acted by Peg Meyers, and
Madge's beau, the ivy-league
fraternity man Alan Seymour is
done righteously by Robert Ch
ase.
The two schoolteachers,
played by Martha Brumbaugh
and Jane Sanders are fortunately
not over-acted and add a wel
come touch of comedy to the
dramatic tone of the show.
Imaginative direction
Director Jeffrey D. Mason de
serves the majority of the
plaudits, as his staging is drama

tic and actively involves the au
dience by having the characters
parade to and from center stage
via the main aisle of the small
theatre.
Mason chose his cast well
also, with ideal juxtaposition of
the characters. By isolating these
pairs throughout various scenes,
the characters themselves be
come more dynamic.
Lighting by Kevin Boog
catches the mood of the show
well, and costumes by Doyne
Mraz are perfect in keeping with
the 1952 era.
"Picnic," which opened last
Sunday night in Foothill Col
lege's Summerepertory '76 sea
son, was no picnic for the
talented cast, who performed
with great zest and profes
sionalism the difficult drama by
William Inge.
As the wayfaring Hal Carter is
thrown into the lives of several
small town American women,
forcing them to redefine them
selves and their sexuality, "Pic
nic" itself is a comet thrown into
the Summerepertory '76 reper
toire of melodrama, slapstick
and genuine comedy, forcing the
troupe to perform to their fullest
capabilities.
