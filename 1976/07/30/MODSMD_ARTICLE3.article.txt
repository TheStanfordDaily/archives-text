# Committee steps up efforts to find child care facilities

### Bill Wien 
The Committee on Child Care,
established by the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents on July 13, has
stepped up its efforts to obtain
funding and a location for child
care facilities for the Stanford
community before elementary
schools resume on September 7.
The Stanford-Nixon After
school childcare Program
(SNAP), located in a large class
room in Nixon Elementary
School until the closing of three
Palo Alto elementary schools
created new demands for space,
had provided care for about 30
children of Stanford students,
faculty and staff.
After SNAP folded in June, a
search for off-campus sites
found no available structure that

would meet state licensing re
quirements for child care, ac
cording to Jane Norris, a Stan
ford student and parent involved
in the child care effort. The
committee, working through the
Dean of Student Affairs Office,
was similarly unable to find an
available on-campus structure.
Members of the committee
met on June 19 with adminis
trators of the Palo Alto public
schools to discuss putting a
portable unit on the Escondido
School grounds. School officials
decided to support the after
school program and lend play
ground facilities contingent
upon the placement of a unit on
Stanford land close to Escondido
School. The Escondido Village
Council endorsed the use of

Stanford land for a modular unit
for after school care.
Attempts to obtain a firm
commitment on a site and to
raise money for purchase of a
portable unit on Stanford land
remain unsuccessful, according
to Sandra Chapek, who chairs
the committee.
Leasing of a portable unit
would require an increase over
SNAP fees of about $95 per
month per child, well beyond
the means of many students' pa
rents, according to Norris. Fund

being sought.
"SNAP gave me peace of
mind," stated one Stanford stu
dent and parent. "I could go to
work and classes knowing that
my child would be cared for and
interested in the things happen
ing there. Even if she should
somehow wander off, I knew the
SNAP staff would search for her
as well as notify me promptly."
With summer on the wane and
parental concern waxing, the
Committee on Child Care plans
to meet in August with the Palo

Alto Board of Education regard
ing the Escondido School site.
Allocation of Stanford land is a
lengthy process and thus highly
unlikely by the Sept. 7 date, ac
cording to Chapek.
"The location is the im
mediate critical problem,"
said Chapek. "Unless the Palo
Alto Board of Education con
sents to the use of land under
their jurisdiction, there may be
no after-school care program in
the fall and no organized ar
rangement for these children,
many of whom are out of school
at noon."
The Committee on Child Care,
established by the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents on July 13, has
stepped up its efforts to obtain
funding and a location for child
care facilities for the Stanford
community before elementary
schools resume on September 7.
The Stanford-Nixon After
school childcare Program
(SNAP), located in a large class
room in Nixon Elementary
School until the closing of three
Palo Alto elementary schools
created new demands for space,
had provided care for about 30
children of Stanford students,
faculty and staff.
After SNAP folded in June, a
search for off-campus sites
found no available structure that

would meet state licensing re
quirements for child care, ac
cording to Jane Norris, a Stan
ford student and parent involved
in the child care effort. The
committee, working through the
Dean of Student Affairs Office,
was similarly unable to find an
available on-campus structure.
Members of the committee
met on June 19 with adminis
trators of the Palo Alto public
schools to discuss putting a
portable unit on the Escondido
School grounds. School officials
decided to support the after
school program and lend play
ground facilities contingent
upon the placement of a unit on
Stanford land close to Escondido
School. The Escondido Village
Council endorsed the use of

Stanford land for a modular unit
for after school care.
Attempts to obtain a firm
commitment on a site and to
raise money for purchase of a
portable unit on Stanford land
remain unsuccessful, according
to Sandra Chapek, who chairs
the committee.
Leasing of a portable unit
would require an increase over
SNAP fees of about $95 per
month per child, well beyond
the means of many students' pa
rents, according to Norris. Fund
ing for purchase of a unit would,
however, allow the program to
be self-sufficient, with a fee
schedule approximating the
former SNAP fee schedule, she
added. Scholarship funds for
low-income families are also
being sought.
