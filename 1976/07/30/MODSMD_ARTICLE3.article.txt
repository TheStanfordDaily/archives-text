# Committee steps up efforts to find child care facilities

### Bill Wien 
The Committee on Child Care,
established by the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents on July 13, has
stepped up its efforts to obtain
funding and a location for child
care facilities for the Stanford
community before elementary
schools resume on September 7.
The Stanford-Nixon After
school childcare Program
(SNAP), located in a large class
room in Nixon Elementary
School until the closing of three
Palo Alto elementary schools

schools to discuss putting a
portable unit on the Escondido
School grounds. School officials

school program and lend play
ground facilities contingent

Stanford land close to Escondido
School. The Escondido Village
Council endorsed the use of

Stanford land for a modular unit
for after school care.
Attempts to obtain a firm
commitment on a site and to
raise money for purchase of a
portable unit on Stanford land
remain unsuccessful, according
to Sandra Chapek, who chairs
the committee.
Leasing of a portable unit
would require an increase over
SNAP fees of about $95 per
month per child, well beyond
the means of many students' pa

ing for purchase of a unit would,
however, allow the program to
be self-sufficient, with a fee
schedule approximating the
former SNAP fee schedule, she
added. Scholarship funds for
