## Buford's folly 
### 
Stan Kent

My first reaction to. Buford
Fennington's "article" (Daily,
July 23) was to laugh. It was
another "brilliantly satirical" ar
ticle in the true Daily style. (I
mean, anyone with a name like
that has to be kidding.)
But for the record let's have a
look at Buf's claims.
1.) I'll personally nominate ol'
Buf for the Nobel Prize if he can
find me a parking lot in South
San Jose with rust red/gray soil
and orange-pink skies sur
rounded by an atmosphere of
carbon dioxide, nitrogen and ar
gon.
2.l Each Viking cost $1 billion,
not "billions and trillions."
3.) The "Flat Earth" mentality
of Buford's insults to the people
who worked on Apollo and Vik
ing shows little regard for the
dedication of thousands of en
gineers and scientists.
At best Buford's article
is childishly funny: at
its worst it is criminally
dangerous. While Buford is
ridiculing the peaceful use of $4
billion per year he neglects to
attack a $100 billion per year de
fense budget.
One day in the not-too-distant
future, when Buford's thick con
crete skull has saved him from

the nuclear armed missiles he
didn't question, a probe from a
civilization many light years
away will land in what is left of
Stanford. Apprehensively it will
analyze Buford and across the
light years the message will re
sound: "No intelligent life on
Earth."
