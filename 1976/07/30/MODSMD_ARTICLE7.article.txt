A campaign issue
As a longtime "Stanford
watcher" I was interested in the
Daily's July 16 story on Rep. Paul
N. McCloskey's campaign for
re-election.
I don't know much about his
rival, David Harris (who de
serves credit for having the
courage to serve time rather than
make war against his consci
ence), but I hope both these ri
vals will address themselves to
the "unmentionable" one-half
million Vietnam veterans who
were forced onto the drug habit
in that war.
Why had the U.S. government

abandoned these pathetic cases?
I believe I know. All are, in real
ity, U.S. military disability
cases, and it would cost the Vete
rans' Administration a good deal
to treat them.
Yet at a time when the gov
ernment is willing to negotiate
with draft deserters, is it justice
and gratitude to ignore the drug
cases? â€” especially when the
drugs came from pushers and
profiteers in the military.
As it stands the military's pol
icy toward these men is rotten
and cowardly. A special charter
should be drawn up by Congress
to work with the relatives to re
trieve and treat and place on vet
erans' disability the heroes of
honorable service who have
been forced into this tragic habit.

Olympic mess
As it stands, the competitors
in the Montreal Olympics par
ticipate as representatives of
their countries and not as indi
viduals. The International
Olympic Committee insists that
it alone can decide the legiti
macy of the competitors. Grant
ing that, which is the guilty
party; the IOC, which by its

complete indifference is pre
venting participation in the
games by the representatives of
one quarter of humanity; or
Canada, which merely wanted
Taiwan not to usurp the name of
China in the sports arena after
Taiwan lost the battle elsewhere
including in Washington?
Secondly, the African pullout
is certainly a tragedy of the
people of South Africa far grim
mer? Politics ought not be in
jected in sports. But is not denial
of representation to black
sportsmen and sportswomen
solely on the basis of their color
an unjust injection of the ruling
party's politics in South African
sports? Can sports stand in isola
tion, segregated from everything
else including moral commit
ment to fellow human beings?
The evil of apartheid has to be
opposed in whichever field it
raises its ugly head. But if the
minority regime, in the genuine
spirit of sports permits full in
tegration in sports, it will have a
strong claim for inclusion in the
games.
And lastly, there is something
to say on the TV ads. If pornog
raphy is defined as concentra
tion on the part to the detriment
of the whole, this inane peren
nial extolling of the (non
existent) virtues of this or that
fodder or the "perfect" drink (so
perfect that one never drinks it

but just spits it out) qualifies for a
vicious form of porno thrust on
unwilling victims in the middle
of a live program on women's
gymnastics.

Don't emulate Germans
I am amazed by Chris Baker's
muddled glorification of the
Eastern European, specifically
East German, approach to the
status of athletes in society
(Daily, July 17).
True, the athlete in countries
of the Soviet bloc is given every
possible privilege, both monet
ary and otherwise. True, such
professionalism makes ludi
crous the "amateur" status of
Olympic-class athletes from
those countries. But if the issue
is rampant professionalism
amongst Olympic athletes,
emulating the East Germans
does not seem like the way to
deal with it.
1 suspect that Baker would
probably be loath to endorse
other aspects of the East German
government's involvement in the
lives of its citizens which his
rooting for East German athletes
implicitly lauds.
