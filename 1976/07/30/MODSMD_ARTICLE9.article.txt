Wou/d you confirm or refute the
story I have heard; to wit, that
Catherine the Great was killed
while having sexual relations
with a horse. If so, what history
hook has so racy a footnote? If
not, how did such a nasty rumor
emerge?-8.8.
"She had relationships with
just about everyone else, but not
with a horse so far as I know,"
said History Professor Terence
Emmons after a bout of semi
hysterical laughter.
Emmons had never heard this
story, and neither had Asst. His
tory Professor Dorothy Atkin
son. However, they did say that
Catherine's countless lovers had
prompted many dirty stories
about her, popular among his
tory buffs.
Apparently Catherine's men
were checked out very carefully,
much like modern-day R.A.'s.
They were first recommended,
then interviewed for personality
traits and finally made love to by
a panel of discriminating coun
tesses. Then, and only then,
could they be the queen's lovers.
Catherine's colorful history
finally ended on the toilet,
where she suffered a stroke and

never regained consciousness.
No shit!

Who is the little old man who is
usually at the corner of Bowdoin
and Stanford Avenue between
8:00 and 8:30 every morning? He
has two canes and usually
waves "Hi" to the cars that
pass.-J.S. . . . Who is the elderly
bearded gentleman who walks
along Bowdoin near Stanford
Avenue most mornings around
8:00? He often stops to direct
traffic with two canes. Does he
have a Stanford history?-
C.C..Who is the old man who di
rects traffic each morning at the
corner of Stanford Avenue and
Bowdoin? He seems old but spry
and carries two canes.-E.L.
Once again (and we've still
never heard anything about Jay
Alexander), "Bug Me" must
admit a failure of sorts. Our per
sistent staff tracked down every
source we could think of, but no
one knows this obviously rather
renowned figure.
Lots of people have seen him,
including the Stanford police,
but no one's ever talked to him,
much less asked him his name.
Our staff contacted people up

and down both Stanford Avenue
and Bowdoin, people who con
sider this little old man an indis
pensable part of their day. We
even had two lengthy conversa
tions with the woman on whose
lawn he sits. Finally, in despera
tion, we drove by the site ourse
lves and waited for him to show
up — but he never did.
And so we turn to our faithful
readers for help. Does anyone,
anywhere know this guy? If so,
call 497-4632.

This past year the Daily ran an
article on Stanford's backlands
which described the places out
there. I've driven all over the
backlands several times now
and am having a hard time find
ing that spot which interests me
most -a girls' camp. In that arti
cle there was a map pointing out
the camp, but stupidly I forgot to
save it. Can you help me and my
fellow molesters out?-G.E.L.
Not much, I'm afraid. We
checked the article and found
nary a mention of a camp. And
we talked with various Univer
sity administrators — all to no
avail.
The only girls in the backlands
are some girl apes, according to
Dan DeYoung, director of ser
vice operations. Depending on
your preferences, these may or
may not fill the bill.

This past year the Daily ran an
article on Stanford's backlands
which described the places out
there. I've driven all over the
backlands several times now
and am having a hard time find
ing that spot which interests me
most -a girls' camp. In that arti
cle there was a map pointing out
the camp, but stupidly I forgot to
save it. Can you help me and my
fellow molesters out?-G.E.L.
Not much, I'm afraid. We
checked the article and found
nary a mention of a camp. And
we talked with various Univer
sity administrators — all to no
avail.
The only girls in the backlands
are some girl apes, according to
Dan DeYoung, director of ser
vice operations. Depending on
your preferences, these may or
may not fill the bill.


Wou/d you confirm or refute the
story I have heard; to wit, that
Catherine the Great was killed
while having sexual relations
with a horse. If so, what history
hook has so racy a footnote? If
not, how did such a nasty rumor
emerge?-8.8.
"She had relationships with
just about everyone else, but not
with a horse so far as I know,"
said History Professor Terence
Emmons after a bout of semi
hysterical laughter.
Emmons had never heard this
story, and neither had Asst. His
tory Professor Dorothy Atkin
son. However, they did say that
Catherine's countless lovers had
prompted many dirty stories
about her, popular among his
tory buffs.
Apparently Catherine's men
were checked out very carefully,
much like modern-day R.A.'s.
They were first recommended,
then interviewed for personality
traits and finally made love to by
a panel of discriminating coun
tesses. Then, and only then,
could they be the queen's lovers.
Catherine's colorful history
finally ended on the toilet,
where she suffered a stroke and

never regained consciousness.
No shit!

Who is the little old man who is
usually at the corner of Bowdoin
and Stanford Avenue between
8:00 and 8:30 every morning? He
has two canes and usually
waves "Hi" to the cars that
pass.-J.S. . . . Who is the elderly
bearded gentleman who walks
along Bowdoin near Stanford
Avenue most mornings around
8:00? He often stops to direct
traffic with two canes. Does he
have a Stanford history?-
C.C..Who is the old man who di
rects traffic each morning at the
corner of Stanford Avenue and
Bowdoin? He seems old but spry
and carries two canes.-E.L.
Once again (and we've still
never heard anything about Jay
Alexander), "Bug Me" must
admit a failure of sorts. Our per
sistent staff tracked down every
source we could think of, but no
one knows this obviously rather
renowned figure.
Lots of people have seen him,
including the Stanford police,
but no one's ever talked to him,
much less asked him his name.
Our staff contacted people up

and down both Stanford Avenue
and Bowdoin, people who con
sider this little old man an indis
pensable part of their day. We
even had two lengthy conversa
tions with the woman on whose
lawn he sits. Finally, in despera
tion, we drove by the site ourse
lves and waited for him to show
up — but he never did.
