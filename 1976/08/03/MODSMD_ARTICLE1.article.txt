# Bookstore to expand
## 
### Pan Demetrakakes 
After stumbling for the fifth time over the
Psych I textbooks packed along the mezzanine
rail, did it ever occur to you that the Stanford
Bookstore is a little cramped for space?
Bookstore officials think so, too, and that's
why the Bookstore will start constructing an
expansion later this month.
Administrative Assistant Rose Anne Sims
said that although the bookstore has its
warehouse and its accounting office in two
different Palo Alto locations, "we're bursting
at the seams."
Double
But the expansion, which will double the
existing space, will allow everything to be
brought under one roof while providing more
room for books and other goodies.
The expansion will include extensions of
the main floor and mezzanine with the addi
tion of a basement, Sims said. The basement
will be used for storage and will also house the
accounting office and a computer.

Of the $2.9 million estimated cost, the Uni
versity will loan the bookstore $2 million,
Sims said.
Trees axed
But if, after an afternoon's stumbling over
Psych I textbooks, you like to relax under one
of the pine trees in back of the bookstore,
you're out of luck. The expansion will take
place in that direction, and the two pines are
smack in the middle of the construction area.
"(The pine trees) were a great topic of dis
cussion among the University Planning
Board, and it was decided that there was no
alternative but to move them," Sims said. One
Atlas Cedar will be moved, according to
Grounds Superintendent Herb Fong.
The expansion wil 1 be completed in approx
imately 18 months, Sims said. The architect
will be John Carl Warnecke and Associates of
San Francisco, who designed the original
building. The contractors will be the Bur
roughs Corp. and another firm yet to be cho
sen.
