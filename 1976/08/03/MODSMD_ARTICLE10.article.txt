Who is the little old man who is
usually at the corner of Bowdoin
and Stanford Avenue between 8
and 8:30 every morning? He has
two canes and usually waves
"Hi" to the cars that pass. -j.S.
We've found it! After more
than six months of fruitless
searching, our staff received an
answer less than four hours after
our column hit the pavement.
That old man is James E.
Stead, Sr., father of a James Stead
who used to work at Stanford.
But you won't be seeing much of
Stead, Sr. anymore because he
and his son moved to Walnut
Creek in June.
In 1971 Stead had a colos
tomy. And. recovering from the
operation, he began walking the
following year.
"Since January 22, 1972, I've
walked two to three hours every
day," said Stead. "I start walking
at 6 in the morning, and I proba
bly cover three to four miles a
day."
All of which is not very impre
ssive until one considers Stead's
age. He turned 92 this year.
"That walking's nothing . . .
nothing for me," said Stead. "I
get my mind off myself getting
out. I don't sit in the rocking
chair worrying about myself,
dreaming about the past and all
that crap."
"All people want nowadays is
money and power," Stead said.
"They go to Las Vegas to be en
tertained. the hellhole of the
earth. They wait until five mi
nutes before it's time to get to
work and then they're in a hell of
a hurry. Even my son does that."
But Stead doesn't. He starts
walking early so that he can see

everything in the morning, not
just the hurry.
"First I see the cats, then I see
the birds, then I see people jog
ging and finally 1 see those cars
flying around the corner," said
Stead. "There must be five to ten
thousand automobiles that go by
that corner every day and practi
cally everyone waves at me. Alot
of the joggers and walkers smile
and say 'Hi, Jim.'
"I try to spread a little sun
shine. I smile and tell everyone
that things are going to be good."
And apparently a lot of them be
lieved it. The people we talked to
called Stead an important part of
their days, something they mis
sed now.
Stead was surprised that
people considered him some
thing of a Stanford legend.
"Now that I'm gone people
will forget pretty quick," he said.
"I'd estimate about 30 days." He
found it hard to believe that our
column had received so many
letters and phone calls about
him.
At the present, Stead is busy
becoming a new legend in Wal
nut Creek. "The street I walk up
and down there is so busy," he
said. "I don't wave at one-tenth
of the cars up there, like I did in
Palo Alto. Up there everyone
knew the name of Jim, thousands
of them for four or five years. But
I'm still walking. Tell everybody
I'm having agood timeuphere."

"Now that I'm gone people
will forget pretty quick," he said.
"I'd estimate about 30 days." He
found it hard to believe that our
column had received so many
letters and phone calls about
him.
At the present, Stead is busy
becoming a new legend in Wal
nut Creek. "The street I walk up
and down there is so busy," he
said. "I don't wave at one-tenth
of the cars up there, like I did in
Palo Alto. Up there everyone
knew the name of Jim, thousands
of them for four or five years. But
I'm still walking. Tell everybody
I'm having agood timeuphere."



Who is the little old man who is
usually at the corner of Bowdoin
and Stanford Avenue between 8
and 8:30 every morning? He has
two canes and usually waves
"Hi" to the cars that pass. -j.S.
We've found it! After more
than six months of fruitless
searching, our staff received an
answer less than four hours after
our column hit the pavement.
That old man is James E.
Stead, Sr., father of a James Stead
who used to work at Stanford.
But you won't be seeing much of
Stead, Sr. anymore because he
and his son moved to Walnut
Creek in June.
In 1971 Stead had a colos
tomy. And. recovering from the
operation, he began walking the
following year.
"Since January 22, 1972, I've
walked two to three hours every
day," said Stead. "I start walking
at 6 in the morning, and I proba
bly cover three to four miles a
day."
All of which is not very impre
ssive until one considers Stead's
age. He turned 92 this year.
"That walking's nothing . . .
nothing for me," said Stead. "I
get my mind off myself getting
out. I don't sit in the rocking
chair worrying about myself,
dreaming about the past and all
that crap."
"All people want nowadays is
money and power," Stead said.
"They go to Las Vegas to be en
tertained. the hellhole of the
earth. They wait until five mi
nutes before it's time to get to
work and then they're in a hell of
a hurry. Even my son does that."
But Stead doesn't. He starts
walking early so that he can see

everything in the morning, not
just the hurry.
"First I see the cats, then I see
the birds, then I see people jog
ging and finally 1 see those cars
flying around the corner," said
Stead. "There must be five to ten
thousand automobiles that go by
that corner every day and practi
cally everyone waves at me. Alot
of the joggers and walkers smile
and say 'Hi, Jim.'
"I try to spread a little sun
shine. I smile and tell everyone
that things are going to be good."
And apparently a lot of them be
lieved it. The people we talked to
called Stead an important part of
their days, something they mis
sed now.
Stead was surprised that
people considered him some
thing of a Stanford legend.

will forget pretty quick," he said.
