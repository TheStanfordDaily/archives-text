Big Daddy's bazaar
Faculty Club head chef Dave
"Big Daddy" McCullum is hold
ing yet another in his series of
famine-fighting fundraisers.
His latest, a bazaar, is being
held each day through Friday
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in Tresid

der's second floor lobby.
Funds from the event will go
to volunteer student organiza
tions which have assisted
McCullum in his efforts, which
have raised more than $12,000 in
four years for drought-stricken
residents of the Sahel in western

Africa.
McCullum says he is now
fighting against hunger and
poverty wherever it might sur
face.
Correction
Friday's Daily article on child
care should have reported that

leasing of a portable childcare
unit in lieu of the defunct
Stanford-Nixon Afterschool
Childcare Program (SNAP)
would represent an increase
over SNAP fees to about $95 per
month per child. The actual in
crease would be about $10 to $15
per month per child.
