The West End Horror
E P. Dutton 8r Co., Inc. $7.95
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would
be proud.
Long after the last of Doyle's
Sherlock Holmes' novels had
been published, 28-year old
Nicholas Meyer "discovered" a
lost manuscript of Doctor John
H. Watson. Meyer's discovery
shot up to the top of the best
seller lists under the title The
Seven-Per-Cent Solution.
One screenplay and two years
later, Meyer's discovery of
another lost Holmes manuscript
has skyrocketed onto the best
seller lists.
What is it about these dis
coveries that has made the pub
lic so eager to read them? A
number of authors have tried to
update and continue the charac
ters of successful novelists such
as Doyle and lan Fleming, but
none have done as expert a job as
Meyers.
Meyers captures the flavor of
the original Holmes stories.
Gareful pre-release scrutiny by
Holmesians has eliminated
technical errors, so the final pro
duct is a well-conceived and per
fectly executed suspense thriller
in the finest tradition of detec
tive novls.
The West End Horror com
bines all the trappings of the
Holmes and Watson writings
with past-dated fictionalized
history. In the Seven-Per-Cent
Solution, Holmes worked
alongside Sigmund Freud to
forestall World War I. The West
End Horror matches Holmes

with Oscar Wilde, Bertard Shaw,
Bram Stoker and Gilbert and Sul
livan in an attempt to discover
the cause of a number of murders
in London's West End.
Meyers writes a fine story, and
the plot constantly provides
surprises. As soon as Dr. Watson
makes his usual presumptions
(that the reader is inclined to
agree with), Holmes explains
why Watson's conclusions are
incorrect, proving Holmes the
master of deduction.
With the success that Meyers'
Holmes' novels are meeting
with, expect a new one soon.
Knowing Meyers' work, it will
be another spellbinder.

The Uses of Enchantment: The
Meaning and Purpose of Fairy
Tales
Alfred Knopf. 5i2.95
Few things in life are as vulgar
and corny as doctrinaire
Freudism, but those gruesome
tales collected by the Grimm
brothers are among them. Freu
dians have perpetrated some ter

rifying tortures on legitimate
works of art (one recalls with a
shudder Freud's "biography" of
Leonardo), but here is a case
where Bettelheim's victim richly
deserves its fate.
Most Americans do not know
the grotesque versions of famil
iar fairy tales that the Grimms
serve up, and this saddens Bet
telheim, whose goal is to guide
children through their various
neuroses, complexes and fixa
tions. Apparently only the most
violent fairy tales suffice.
Thus it will not do for the wolf
in "Red Riding Hood" to survive
in any manner: he must be
hacked to death, or children will
become uneasy. The wolf of
"The Three Little Pigs" must be
burned to a crisp, Cinderella's
stepmother be made to dance in
red-hot slippers until she drops
dead; and"The Three Bears"
won't do at all, because there is
no bitter conflict to resolve.
To Bettelheim, fairy, tales are
"great art": every time that, say,
a frog forces its way into a prin
cess's bed, gets thrown against
the wall by her, and turns into a

prince, the child learns some of
the wisdom of the world.
Bettelheim prefers that chil
dren be drilled in such "art" as
an understandably little-known
tale, "The Goose Girl," in which
a villainess suggests stuffing a
victim into a barrel studded with
nail points and dragging that
victim up and down the street
until dead. Naturally, the villai
ness is then subjected to that
very form of fatal torture — a just
(?) and happy resolution.
And surely, our author insists,
there are profound psychologi
cal insights to be gleaned here.

He analyzes many tales, supply
ing such hidden (sorry, latent)
meanings as the following:
1.) Hansel's and Gretel's
gingerbread house should not be
eaten, proving that children
ought not to think they can eat
their parents (even though they
would like to).
2.) Giants symbolize grow
nups. and children are com
forted and calmed when they
hear tales of giants' deaths.
3.) Jack's tall, firm beanstalk
symbolizes — well, this very
solemn book can be highly
amusing at times. _ ...

The West End Horror
E P. Dutton 8r Co., Inc. $7.95
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would
be proud.
Long after the last of Doyle's
Sherlock Holmes' novels had
been published, 28-year old
Nicholas Meyer "discovered" a
lost manuscript of Doctor John
H. Watson. Meyer's discovery
shot up to the top of the best
seller lists under the title The
Seven-Per-Cent Solution.
One screenplay and two years
later, Meyer's discovery of
another lost Holmes manuscript
has skyrocketed onto the best
seller lists.
What is it about these dis
coveries that has made the pub
lic so eager to read them? A
number of authors have tried to
update and continue the charac
ters of successful novelists such
as Doyle and lan Fleming, but
none have done as expert a job as
Meyers.
Meyers captures the flavor of
the original Holmes stories.
Gareful pre-release scrutiny by
Holmesians has eliminated
technical errors, so the final pro
duct is a well-conceived and per
fectly executed suspense thriller
in the finest tradition of detec
tive novls.
The West End Horror com
bines all the trappings of the
Holmes and Watson writings
with past-dated fictionalized
history. In the Seven-Per-Cent
Solution, Holmes worked
alongside Sigmund Freud to
forestall World War I. The West
End Horror matches Holmes

with Oscar Wilde, Bertard Shaw,
Bram Stoker and Gilbert and Sul
livan in an attempt to discover
the cause of a number of murders
in London's West End.
Meyers writes a fine story, and
the plot constantly provides
surprises. As soon as Dr. Watson
makes his usual presumptions
(that the reader is inclined to
agree with), Holmes explains
why Watson's conclusions are
incorrect, proving Holmes the
master of deduction.
With the success that Meyers'
Holmes' novels are meeting
with, expect a new one soon.
Knowing Meyers' work, it will
be another spellbinder.

The Uses of Enchantment: The
Meaning and Purpose of Fairy
Tales
Alfred Knopf. 5i2.95
Few things in life are as vulgar
and corny as doctrinaire
Freudism, but those gruesome
tales collected by the Grimm
brothers are among them. Freu
dians have perpetrated some ter

rifying tortures on legitimate
works of art (one recalls with a
shudder Freud's "biography" of
Leonardo), but here is a case
where Bettelheim's victim richly
deserves its fate.
Most Americans do not know
the grotesque versions of famil
iar fairy tales that the Grimms
serve up, and this saddens Bet
telheim, whose goal is to guide
children through their various
neuroses, complexes and fixa
tions. Apparently only the most
violent fairy tales suffice.
Thus it will not do for the wolf
in "Red Riding Hood" to survive
in any manner: he must be
hacked to death, or children will
become uneasy. The wolf of
"The Three Little Pigs" must be
burned to a crisp, Cinderella's
stepmother be made to dance in
red-hot slippers until she drops
dead; and"The Three Bears"
won't do at all, because there is
no bitter conflict to resolve.
To Bettelheim, fairy, tales are
"great art": every time that, say,
a frog forces its way into a prin
cess's bed, gets thrown against
the wall by her, and turns into a

prince, the child learns some of
the wisdom of the world.
