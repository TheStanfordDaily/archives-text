# Lifeguard a relevant movie for youth
## Does not sell out 
### Howard Baldwin 
Rick Carlson is a Hermosa
Beach lifeguard. His responsibil
ity is to keep the beach safe from
assorted voyeurs, muggers,
flashers and troublemakers. But
his primary responsibility is to
guard his own life, he discovers,
to preserve it for himself so that
he will be happy.
Rather than guarding it for his
parents, girlfriends and
classmates of yesteryear, who in
trude at various times with
suggestions for becoming a
businessman, he decides he is
the one for whom he must live
his life.
A deadly message for any
wavering college student won
dering whether the time spent
studying and in classrooms is
worth it, when there are people
like Rick Cajdson running
around loose, surviving quite
happily without participating in
the financially motivated world
of high-pressure, low-integrity
business. It's enough to make
one hesitate.
Carlson has everything he
needs to survive. He loves the
ocean and its peacefulness, and
he has even gotten used to the
weirdos who populate what he
refers to as 'his' beach. His job is
thankless, the people inconsid
erate, yet something mystical
and hypnotic about the ocean
captivates him.
In the eyes of the world,
though,he is a shiftless,unmoti

vated menial laborer with no
ambitions. What he must con
vince both the world and himself
at this crucial turning point in
his life is that he doesn't need art
galleries and Porsche dealer
ships and gray hair and asphalt.
Produced by Ron Silverman
and directed by Daniel Petrie,
who did Buster and Billie.
Lifeguard is a look at that cros
sroads everyone faces at one
time in their lives, having to
make an irreversible decision af
fecting their destiny, one which
they may very well regret later.
Such a decision is usually made
blindly with no clues as to the
best alternative—like predicting
an election's outcome before the
polls open.
His girls are played by 1971
Playmate of the Year Sharon
Weber as Tina; Kathleen Quin
lan, as Wendy, who has a sweet
voice like Melanie Griffith,
though not as gooey; and Anne
Archer as Cathy, the flame from
high school whom Rick meets at
a reunion.
The film captures both the
beauty and the depravity of
Southern California. It is not per
fect, but it is not my position to
propose where it might be im
proved. Rick's indecision is
something almost all of us can
relate to. His final decision
proves that his life will not be
controlled by others, but only by
himself.

NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT—Kathleen Quinlan (left) plays a young lonely girl who falls in love
with professional lifeguard Rick Carlson (Sam Elliott), who must choose between a life of
professional security in business and his love of being on the beach.
Rick Carlson is a Hermosa
Beach lifeguard. His responsibil
ity is to keep the beach safe from
assorted voyeurs, muggers,
flashers and troublemakers. But
his primary responsibility is to
guard his own life, he discovers,
to preserve it for himself so that
he will be happy.
Rather than guarding it for his
parents, girlfriends and
classmates of yesteryear, who in
trude at various times with
suggestions for becoming a
businessman, he decides he is
the one for whom he must live
his life.
A deadly message for any
wavering college student won
dering whether the time spent
studying and in classrooms is
worth it, when there are people
like Rick Cajdson running
around loose, surviving quite
happily without participating in
the financially motivated world
of high-pressure, low-integrity
business. It's enough to make
one hesitate.
Carlson has everything he
needs to survive. He loves the
ocean and its peacefulness, and
he has even gotten used to the
weirdos who populate what he
refers to as 'his' beach. His job is
thankless, the people inconsid
erate, yet something mystical
and hypnotic about the ocean
captivates him.
In the eyes of the world,
though,he is a shiftless,unmoti

vated menial laborer with no
ambitions. What he must con
vince both the world and himself
at this crucial turning point in
his life is that he doesn't need art
galleries and Porsche dealer
ships and gray hair and asphalt.
Produced by Ron Silverman
and directed by Daniel Petrie,
who did Buster and Billie.
Lifeguard is a look at that cros
sroads everyone faces at one
time in their lives, having to
make an irreversible decision af
fecting their destiny, one which
they may very well regret later.
Such a decision is usually made
blindly with no clues as to the
best alternative—like predicting
an election's outcome before the
polls open.
His girls are played by 1971
Playmate of the Year Sharon
Weber as Tina; Kathleen Quin
lan, as Wendy, who has a sweet
voice like Melanie Griffith,
though not as gooey; and Anne
Archer as Cathy, the flame from
high school whom Rick meets at
a reunion.
The film captures both the
beauty and the depravity of
Southern California. It is not per
fect, but it is not my position to
propose where it might be im
proved. Rick's indecision is
something almost all of us can
relate to. His final decision
proves that his life will not be
controlled by others, but only by
himself.
