# Fine ragtime
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
When Max Morath surged
onto the stage at the Great
American Music Hall last week,
the audience, aged from 18 to 80,
applauded, suddenly aware that
a vibrant aura of energy had en
tered their midst.
Morath. a ragtime expert, de
livered his routine — a com
bination of music, history,
humor and dancing — with such
obvious enjoyment and en
thusiasm that he couldn't help
perspiring and the audience
couldn't help being swept away
by his charm.
This is the third consecutive
year I have seen Morath perform,
and he gets better every year. He
cheerfully and brightly leads the
audience on a ragtime apprecia
tion course, converting all non
believers into toe-tapping,
hand-clapping, finger-snapping
aficionados.
He became interested in rag
time as a youngster, when he
found some compositions in his
family piano bench. Now he
spreads his enjoyment of it
wherever he goes.

Morath's repertoire includes
renditions of Mr. Dooley, satirist
Thomas Nast's political com
mentator; ragtime music made
famous by Scott Joplin, Eubie
Blake and other contemporaries
of theirs; and jokes and foibles of
the 1890s through the 19205.
One of the joys of the show is
Morath's obvious pleasure at en
tertaining. His laughs, smiles
and chuckles are too infectious
to be ignored.
Discussing the reaction to rag
time of the United States presi
dents, Morath reports, "Teddy
Roosevelt liked it. Woodrow
Wilson didn't. Calvin Coolidge
wouldn't say." His adeptness at
the pacing and delivery of a joke
matches his dexterity and talent
on the keyboard.
Morath takes pains to insist
that he is not infatuated with the
past, that today is the best time to
be living. However, he continues

— if there was a time machine to
transport him to any place and
any time he chose for a few
weeks, he would without hesita
tion choose the Midwest at the
turn of the century.
At that time, along the mid-*
way of the 1903 St. Louis Exposi
tion especially, ragtime was
being created and nurtured.
However, there is Morath's
piano, which he refers to as such
a time machine. That it is.
Innocent
But Morath's specialties are
not strictly confined to music.
Analyzing correctly that "the
more things change, the more
they stay the same." he com
ments on the idiosyncrasies of
that"innocent"era and compares
it to our own.
"In those days, boys were
supposed to 'sow their wild
oats,' as they put it." He pauses
for emphasis. "The girls we
ren't." Another pregnant pause,
and then almost as an after
thought, "If you think about that
a minute, you'll know it's
mathematically impossible. Ob
viously, there have to be some
girls playing by the boys' rules.
We will never know how many
girls did this, but if we estimate
their numbers to be even as high
as 10 percent, we know that
these girls were, if nothing else,
busy."
Great American
The Great American Music
Hall, as might be suggested by its
name, was the most appropriate
setting for Morath's perfor
mance. Two balconies on either
side of the hall, elaborately
sculpted along with decor re
miniscent of the era helped make
the evening a complete journey
back into another era that still
lives on.
Appearing Friday and Satur
day at the Great American Music
Hall will be Blood, Sweat and
Tears featuring David Clayton-
Thomas; on August 13-14 will be
jazz man Ahmad Jamal. Minors
are welcome, and food is served.
