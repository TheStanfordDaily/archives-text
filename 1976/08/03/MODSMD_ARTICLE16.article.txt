Flood victims count rises
LARLMER COUNTY. Colorado—At
last count last night 76 bodies had been
recovered from flooded regions of the
Big Thompson River canyon, and over
500 vacationers and residents were
stranded overnight in the 35-mile region
where flash floods hit last weekend.
Rescue teams on horseback and in four
wheel-drive vehicles tried to enter the
canyon yesterday, and one elderly diabe
tic woman was rescued by helicopter.
But rescue operations, already blocked
by accumulated mud and debris, may be
further hampered by a rise in the river
level as officials release some water
stored behind the overflowing Mount
Olympus Dam.
Reagan talks of delegates
WASHINGTON —Ronald Reagan
named some names yesterday, listing 12
national convention delegates who will
votefor him forthe Republican presiden
tial nomination. But of the 12 uncommit
ted delegates he listed, nine had already
been widely counted as Reagan suppor
ters.
Reagan's campaign chief, John Sears,
charged yesterday that Gerald Ford had a
"cavalier" attitude towards the presi
dency. and that he has "played games"
with the office since moving into the
White House.
Ford's staff sent letters to GOP dele
gates yesterday asking for lists of possi
ble running mates for Ford. Ford's
former campaign manager, "Bo" Calla
way. said yesterday that if the election
were held now. Democratic nominee
Jimmy Carter would win.
Carter met with his campaign planners
in Plains, Ga. yesterday. They agreed on
a $19 million operating budget for the
fall effort. The projected budget calls for
a cut in advertising spending.

Republican Senator Hugh Scott re
ported yesterday that Chinese officials
have no preference on who wins the U.S.
election in November, provided that
Sino-American relations continue to im
prove. Scott recently returned from a trip
to China.
Defense bill passes test
WASHINGTON —The Senate last
night rejected a move by liberals to cut
about $1 billion from a $104 billion de
fense bill. By a 60-to-37 margin, the
senators rejected what opponents called
a "meat axe" cut proposed by Missouri
Democrat Thomas Eagleton.
The Senate also voted down by a large
margin an amendment offered by
Senator Edward Kennedy which would
have delayed until Feb. 12 the spending
of $274 million requested by President
Ford for 60 minuteman missiles.
Mystery virus hits east
PHILADELPHIA—A mysterious dis
ease. apparently a virus, has killed 15
persons in Pennsylvania and put another
35 in the hospital, state health officials
reported yesterday.
"There's no reason to panic," said the
state's health secretary, "but we don't
know what we're dealing with." All the
victims of the disease were in Philadel
phia last month for an American Legion
convention. Symptoms are like those of a
common cold, working up to severe
headaches and high temperatures. Some

officials have mentioned swine flu as a
possibility.
Woods returned to Oakland
OAKLAND —Fred Woods, the local re
sident who is one of three men charged
with the kidnaping of 26 children and a
bus driver in Chowchilla, was flown to
Oakland yesterday to face charges. Ear
lier in the day he appeared nervous at a
hearing before a U.S. magistrate in Sac
ramento. Officials dropped a federal
warrant for unlawful flight to avoid pro
secution, clearing the way for Woods to
face kidnaping charges.
Harris jury undecided
LOS ANGELES—The jury has still not
reached a verdict in the trial of former
Symbionese Liberation Army members
William and Emily Harris after three
days of deliberation. The judge in the
case yesterday sternly denied a motion to
declare a mistrial, but said that if the
Harrises are found guilty on any of the
counts of kidnaping, assault and robbery
with which they are charged he will hear
a new mistrial motion.
Foreigners flee China
TOKYO — Foreign residents left Pek
ing and Tientsin for places of safety as
the Chinese government reported 110 af
tershocks — an average of nearly five an
hour — in the devastated Tangshan area.
The aftershocks Saturday night and

Sunday, combined with such other indi
cations as nervous behavior of animals in
the Peking Zoo, prompted new warnings
from Chinese seismologists that a new
major quake was imminent. It was the
third such warning since Friday.
Tennis results
LOUISVILLE—Fourth-seeded Harold
Solomon defeated Wojtek Fibak of Po
land, 6-2, 7-5, yesterday to win the
$20,000 first prize in the Louisville Ten
nis Tournament. Fibak, who was playing
in his first American tournament final,
said he was nervous and was in constant
trouble with his serve.
Defending champion Jimmy Connors,
Manuel Orantes, Arthur Ashe and Ken
