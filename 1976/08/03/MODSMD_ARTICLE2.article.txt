# Tresidder pub plans hit snag
## 
### John Freed 
Plans for an on-campus pub
have been indefinitely sus
pended. Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Dan Williams confirmed
yesterday.
TDS Inc., which runs Tresid
der concessions such as the Cof
fee House and the Transition,
has already obtained a liquor
license from the state Alcoholic
Beverage Commission (ABC).
The license terms, however,
would keep out some students,
which is contrary to the Tresid
der spirit, Williams said.
"Everything we've always
done at Tresidder is for
everyone. The license would
prohibit people under 21 from
entering the pub," he explained.
"Should we say, 'Come on over,
but there are some things you
can't do'?"
Substantial' investment
Renovation of the bowling al
ley's games area for a pub would
require a "substantial" initial
investment, he claimed.
"I have a whole lot of concerns
(about the pub) . . . I'm not sure
it's the right thing to do," Wil
liams noted, adding that he has
"decided to sit on this for a
while."
'Not final'
Williams said his decision "is
not final and absolute," realizing
that "this kind of argument
would not be welcomed by large
numbers of people."
"I'm worried that a group of
people will be sitting in a resi
dence hall . . . and say, 'Hey,
let's go over to the pub,' but then
some of them — one or two, say

— won't be able to go because
they're under 21," he said.
The Oasis
Other drinking establish
ments, such as The Oasis in
Menlo Park, permit minors to
enter if accompanied by a guar
dian over 21. Although the
minors may not drink, they are
free to enjoy the "atmosphere."
Williams guessed why the TDS
license was more restrictive than
some others.
"Given that it's a college cam
pus. the (ABC) is possibly more
restrictive," he noted.
Williams denied a rumor that
a member of the Board of Trus
tees had urged scrapping of the
pub.
"It's very much my own con
clusion," he said.
