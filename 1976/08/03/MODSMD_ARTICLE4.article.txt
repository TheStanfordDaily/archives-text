# Summer campus: conference center
##

A black Lincoln Continental drives up
to the door. A man wearing a dark suit
carries a piece of luggage and an attache
case into the building. Two porters greet
him. He walks over to the clerk who gives
him his registration form and brochure of
recreational facilities.
Rickey's Hyatt House? Wrong. Would
you believe Stern Hall?
While many students spend their vaca
tions away from Stanford this summer,
their dormitories are serving as hotels for
thousands of campus visitors. Stern,
Moore and Lagunita are housing nearly
7400 people while they attend one of the
74 conferences held at Stanford this
summer. Athletic training sessions, re

ligious camps and other groups are lo
cated in Toyon, Roble and other campus
houses.
Conferences range in duration from a
few days to several months. Just as varied
as their lengths are the conference
themes. So far this summer, a cheerlead
ing camp, a meeting for "Primary In
struction in the Principles of Christian
Science " and the Second International
Symposium on Psoriasis have been held.
People attending short conferences
stay in Stern Hall. Conferees in Stern pay
$8.50 for a single room or $6 for half of a
double, far below regular hotel rates. In
addition to having porters at Stern to
help simulate a hotel-like environment,
the dormitory provides daily maid ser
vice for summer residents. Most con

ferees enjoy living in Stern.
"For the price, they're excellent," said
Tom Hamilton, graduate student in his
tory at UCSB attending "The History of
Revolution in Modern America.""The
overwhelming courtesy of the people
I've had to deal with has impressed me
the most," he said.
The staff at Stern tries to make the con
ferees' stay trouble-free. When Mark
Narvaez, Stanford undergraduate work
ing at the conference dormitories, found
out that one conferee was waiting for a
taxi to go to the San Francisco airport, he
offered to drive him there.
Narvaez and Miv London, another staff
person, said they enjoy working with the
conferees.

"You can get really attached to some of
them," London said.
Some of the conferees are foreigners
visiting the United States for their first
time. Staff people try to make sure these
people understand important English
phrases and American customs. Once,
however, they failed to recognize and
explain one important American word to
a group of non-English speakers â€” pizza.
One night six hungry foreigners de
cided to order an evening snack. Discov
ering that restaurants would deliver piz
zas to them, they decided to order six
large ones. When their food came, the
foreigners were surprised to find out that
pizzas were not sandwiches.
