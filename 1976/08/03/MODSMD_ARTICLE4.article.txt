# Summer campus: conference center
## 
### Rochelle Sharpe 
A black Lincoln Continental drives up
to the door. A man wearing a dark suit
carries a piece of luggage and an attache
case into the building. Two porters greet
him. He walks over to the clerk who gives
him his registration form and brochure of
recreational facilities.
Rickey's Hyatt House? Wrong. Would
you believe Stern Hall?
While many students spend their vaca
tions away from Stanford this summer,
their dormitories are serving as hotels for
thousands of campus visitors. Stern,
Moore and Lagunita are housing nearly
7400 people while they attend one of the
74 conferences held at Stanford this
summer. Athletic training sessions, re

ligious camps and other groups are lo
cated in Toyon, Roble and other campus
houses.
Conferences range in duration from a
few days to several months. Just as varied
as their lengths are the conference
themes. So far this summer, a cheerlead
ing camp, a meeting for "Primary In
struction in the Principles of Christian
Science " and the Second International
Symposium on Psoriasis have been held.
People attending short conferences
stay in Stern Hall. Conferees in Stern pay
$8.50 for a single room or $6 for half of a
double, far below regular hotel rates. In
addition to having porters at Stern to
help simulate a hotel-like environment,
the dormitory provides daily maid ser
vice for summer residents. Most con

ferees enjoy living in Stern.
"For the price, they're excellent," said
Tom Hamilton, graduate student in his
tory at UCSB attending "The History of
Revolution in Modern America.""The
overwhelming courtesy of the people
I've had to deal with has impressed me
the most," he said.
The staff at Stern tries to make the con
ferees' stay trouble-free. When Mark
Narvaez, Stanford undergraduate work
ing at the conference dormitories, found
out that one conferee was waiting for a
taxi to go to the San Francisco airport, he
offered to drive him there.
Narvaez and Miv London, another staff
person, said they enjoy working with the
conferees.

"You can get really attached to some of
them," London said.
Some of the conferees are foreigners
visiting the United States for their first
time. Staff people try to make sure these
people understand important English
phrases and American customs. Once,
however, they failed to recognize and
explain one important American word to
a group of non-English speakers — pizza.
One night six hungry foreigners de
cided to order an evening snack. Discov
ering that restaurants would deliver piz
zas to them, they decided to order six
large ones. When their food came, the
foreigners were surprised to find out that
pizzas were not sandwiches.

foreigners were surprised to find out that

Conferees have also been able
to enjoy free sneak previews of
new movies this summer. One
conferee who works for 20th
Century Fox had received from
his company copies of Silent
Movie, The Omen, as well as
other new 20th Century Fox
productions.
All conferees attending the
Executive Business Program live
at Lagunita. Hotel-like facilities
there are even more plentiful
than they are at Stern. Rooms in
Lagunita are decorated -for the
summer with color-coordinated
draperies, bedspreads and post
ers. Besides having daily maid
service, conferees can send their
laundry to be dry-cleaned from
the Lagunita Office.
When asked if they had any
complaints about Stanford, con
ferees often mentioned the qual
ity of dormitory food.
"The food is too good, I'm
gaining a lot of weight" said
Jesse Benton who works for
Chubb & Sons Inc.
Diet
Sibby Freeman, conference
assistant, said many of the con
ferees had made plans to diet
during the conference, expect
ing mediocre food. They were
surprised to find steak served
several times a week.
Freeman enjoys working for
the long-term program. "Work
ing with these people is like se
eing them go from their
freshman to senior year," he
said. "At the beginning they're
asking where the union and the
bookstore are and by the end

they're old hands."
Besides providing visitors and
staff members with pleasant
memories of the summer, con
ferences generate income for the
Stanford housing and food ser
vices. By using the housing
facilities all summer, the Uni
versty can employ its housing
and food staff year-round,
eliminating the need for staff
unemployment compensation.
Profit
"Any profit we make goes
back into the student residences
to keep room and board at a

reasonable level." said Lois
Fariello. manager of confer
ences.
As manager of conferences,
Fariello makes preparation for
each conference group. She and
her staff set up cocktail parties,
arrange for telephone installa
tions and take care of other con
ference details.
There is no advance applica
tion deadline for groups who
want to hold conferences at
Stanford. Fariello has set up con
ferences with only a few days'
notice.

The staff at Stern tries to make the con
ferees' stay trouble-free. When Mark
Narvaez, Stanford undergraduate work
ing at the conference dormitories, found
out that one conferee was waiting for a
taxi to go to the San Francisco airport, he
offered to drive him there.
Narvaez and Miv London, another staff
person, said they enjoy working with the
conferees.

"You can get really attached to some of
them," London said.
Some of the conferees are foreigners
visiting the United States for their first
time. Staff people try to make sure these
people understand important English
phrases and American customs. Once,
however, they failed to recognize and
explain one important American word to
a group of non-English speakers — pizza.
One night six hungry foreigners de
cided to order an evening snack. Discov
ering that restaurants would deliver piz
zas to them, they decided to order six
large ones. When their food came, the
foreigners were surprised to find out that
pizzas were not sandwiches.
Conferees have also been able
to enjoy free sneak previews of
new movies this summer. One
conferee who works for 20th
Century Fox had received from
his company copies of Silent
Movie, The Omen, as well as
other new 20th Century Fox
productions.
All conferees attending the
Executive Business Program live
at Lagunita. Hotel-like facilities
there are even more plentiful
than they are at Stern. Rooms in
Lagunita are decorated -for the
summer with color-coordinated
draperies, bedspreads and post
ers. Besides having daily maid
service, conferees can send their
laundry to be dry-cleaned from
the Lagunita Office.
When asked if they had any
complaints about Stanford, con
ferees often mentioned the qual
ity of dormitory food.
"The food is too good, I'm
gaining a lot of weight" said
Jesse Benton who works for
Chubb & Sons Inc.
Diet
Sibby Freeman, conference
assistant, said many of the con
ferees had made plans to diet
during the conference, expect
ing mediocre food. They were
surprised to find steak served
several times a week.
Freeman enjoys working for
the long-term program. "Work
ing with these people is like se
eing them go from their
freshman to senior year," he
said. "At the beginning they're
asking where the union and the
bookstore are and by the end

they're old hands."
Besides providing visitors and
staff members with pleasant
memories of the summer, con
ferences generate income for the
Stanford housing and food ser
vices. By using the housing
facilities all summer, the Uni
versty can employ its housing
and food staff year-round,
eliminating the need for staff
unemployment compensation.
Profit
"Any profit we make goes
back into the student residences
to keep room and board at a

reasonable level." said Lois
Fariello. manager of confer
ences.
As manager of conferences,
Fariello makes preparation for
each conference group. She and
her staff set up cocktail parties,
arrange for telephone installa
tions and take care of other con
ference details.
There is no advance applica
tion deadline for groups who
want to hold conferences at
Stanford. Fariello has set up con
ferences with only a few days'
notice.
A black Lincoln Continental drives up

Rickey's Hyatt House? Wrong. Would
you believe Stern Hall?
While many students spend their vaca
tions away from Stanford this summer,
their dormitories are serving as hotels for
thousands of campus visitors. Stern,
Moore and Lagunita are housing nearly
7400 people while they attend one of the
74 conferences held at Stanford this
summer. Athletic training sessions, re

ligious camps and other groups are lo
cated in Toyon, Roble and other campus
houses.
Conferences range in duration from a
few days to several months. Just as varied
as their lengths are the conference
themes. So far this summer, a cheerlead
ing camp, a meeting for "Primary In
struction in the Principles of Christian
Science " and the Second International
Symposium on Psoriasis have been held.
People attending short conferences
stay in Stern Hall. Conferees in Stern pay
$8.50 for a single room or $6 for half of a
double, far below regular hotel rates. In
addition to having porters at Stern to
help simulate a hotel-like environment,
the dormitory provides daily maid ser
vice for summer residents. Most con

ferees enjoy living in Stern.
"For the price, they're excellent," said
Tom Hamilton, graduate student in his
tory at UCSB attending "The History of
Revolution in Modern America.""The
overwhelming courtesy of the people
I've had to deal with has impressed me
the most," he said.

When asked if they had any
complaints about Stanford, con
ferees often mentioned the qual
ity of dormitory food.
"The food is too good, I'm
gaining a lot of weight" said
Jesse Benton who works for
Chubb & Sons Inc.
Diet
Sibby Freeman, conference
assistant, said many of the con
ferees had made plans to diet
during the conference, expect
ing mediocre food. They were
surprised to find steak served
several times a week.
Freeman enjoys working for
the long-term program. "Work
ing with these people is like se
eing them go from their
freshman to senior year," he
said. "At the beginning they're
asking where the union and the
bookstore are and by the end

they're old hands."
Besides providing visitors and
staff members with pleasant
memories of the summer, con
ferences generate income for the
Stanford housing and food ser
vices. By using the housing
facilities all summer, the Uni
versty can employ its housing
and food staff year-round,
eliminating the need for staff
unemployment compensation.
Profit
"Any profit we make goes
back into the student residences
to keep room and board at a

reasonable level." said Lois
Fariello. manager of confer
ences.
As manager of conferences,
Fariello makes preparation for
each conference group. She and
her staff set up cocktail parties,
arrange for telephone installa
tions and take care of other con
ference details.
There is no advance applica
tion deadline for groups who
want to hold conferences at
Stanford. Fariello has set up con
ferences with only a few days'
notice.
