## For Carter 
### 
Liz Shi veil

Stephen Carter (Daily, July 27)
claims three things: First, that
Jimmy Carter is "a man who
served only one term as governor
and wasn't a very popular gov
ernor at that." Second, that Car
ter not only has an indifferent
record but may have planted
rumors of being a racist in order
to gain votes. Third, that in Car
ter's campaign, issues are taboo.
I strongly recommend that the
author do a little research while
he's in Georgia. First, according
to Georgia law. a governor may
only serve one term.
Second, one very real cause in
his drop in popularity (as best
remembered in the cases of
Strom Thurmond and George
Wallace) was his vigorous im
plementation of civil rights and
mental health legislation.
Third, on any poll from Gallup
to CBS News, voters have named
three issues that are most impor
tant for the fall elections: gov
ernment corruption, govern
ment spending and unemploy
ment.
Carter has addressed these is
sues in both his primary
speeches and his party's plat-

form by pledging an open and
honest administration, zero-.base
budgeting in the federal gov
ernment, and the implementa
tion of a full-employment policy
as outlined in the Humphrey-
Hawkins bill.
Stephen Carter's article is just
another example of the Daily's
inane and inaccurate writing. 1
look forward to its improvement.
