A pity that Olympic champion
Mac Wilkins, a talented but con
fused young man, has succeeded
in confusing Chris Baker, whose
"Root for East Germany in
Olympics" raises more ques
tions than it answers. According
to Baker, "Mac Wilkins was on
the right track, when he said that
he hoped East Germany won ev
erything in track and field. Wil
kins isn't a member of the Com
munist party; he was simply
criticizing this country, for not
supporting its athletes like some
Eastern European countries."
(Daily. July 27).
First questions first: Is the
vaunted East German system so
much better than ours? More ef
ficient perhaps, but is it better?
True, our women swimmers
were soundly (but honorably)
defeated by their East German
competitors. But how come
our men swimmers crushed not
only their East German oppo
nents, but all the rest of the
world in the process?
A belief shared by many is that
our young women are selfish
enough to refuse overdevelop
ing their musculature by taking

male hormones and by engaging
in heavy weight lifting. Should
they be patriotic instead and fol
low their East German rivals in
these practices? I. for one, think
not. happy as 1 am with the way
Shirley Babashoff looks, thinks,
and swims, even if it means br
inging home silver rather than
gold.
But granted that the East Ger
man system is more efficient —
i.e. produces more champions,
medals and records — should we
adopt it? Before answering re
member that the East German
system has two characteristic
features: it is totally subsidized
and controlled by the State; and
it is highly disciplinarian, re
gimented. coercive. Which
raises two questions.
Should our government sub
sidize sports and athletics?
Which is to say. should we be
taxing lowa farmers so that Mac
Wilkins can go about the world
throwing the discus? I am not
sure. But the least we can do is
ask the lowa farmer how he feels
about it.
And assuming that we can
persuade American taxpayers to

subsidize an East German-like
system in our country, will our
young people put up with it?
Would our Mac Wilkinses be
willing to comply with curfews,
would they accept being told
when to go to bed and with
whom? Would they let govern
ment officials tell them whether,
when and where they should be
competing and travelling?
Would they be prepared to
petition the State for permission
to marry? Would they accept
walking downtown Montreal in
the perpetual company of an "in
terpreter" whose task is to make
sure that they do not "defect"?
(The fantastic Nadia Comaneci
was whisked back to Southern
Moldavia hours after she com
pleted her last floor exercise; not
for Nadia the pleasure of enjoy
ing the Olympics after a job wel 1
done.)
Do you believe that the sports
field is a legitimate battleground
for political warfare? That athle
tic performance is an acceptable
weapon of political struggle?
That champions, records and
medals reflect the goodness of a
society? That lowa farmers
should be made to pay for Olym
pic medals? That young people
should be conscripted, discip
lined and regimented for the

greater glory of the fatherland?
Now if you believe all this,
then by all means, do join Chris
Baker and root for East Germany.
But if you don't, then root for Old
Glory.

yards dashes.)
