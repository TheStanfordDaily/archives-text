### 
Fennington's folly
In regard to B. Fennington's
article of July 24, the recent and
memorably efforts of the United
States Space Program to put a
"thingy" on Mars is neither a
travesty nor a sham, but a merit
ous milestone in the history of
space exploration.
The Viking expedition has
provided information of great
value to mankind, and proven
what the Olympics have thus far
been unable to do, namely that
this country remains at the lead
ership position for all men to
look up to.
