# All-Jewish camp arrives

Bagels, blintzes and borscht.
That's what nearly 400 children
have been eating here this sum
mer.
The children are participating
in Camp Arazin, the first all-
Jewish summer camp held here.
The program tries "to give cam
pers the experience of living in a
total Jewish environment," said
director Jack Gruenberg.
In addition to eating tradi
tional Jewish food and observing
the Jewish dietary laws, campers
speak Hebrew as much as possi
ble. They wear Kipot, skull caps,
to help them maintain a sense of
community identity.
Each day they attend
shacharit, a traditional morning
service. On Sabbath, following
the Jewish customs, campers do
not use electrical appliances,
watch television, ride in cars or
write.
For Jews, "education, religion
and recreation are equally im
portant," explained Sheldon
Mitchell, the camp administra
tive director.
Prayer important
"To maintain the Jewish life
style in our program, prayer be
comes as important as sports,
and study becomes as important
as swimming and eating,"
Mitchell said.
After campers attend morning
services and eat breakfast, they
participate in a class on the camp
theme; attend workshops in
dance, arts and crafts, music or
drama; take part in different
sports; and receive swimming
instruction.
Campers spend their after
noons on trips to different points
of interest in the local area.

At night special camp events
take place. During the first
three-week session, when the
camp theme was the Jewish life
cycle and its symbols, evening
activities included a mock Bar
Mitzvah and a mock Jewish
wedding.
Drawn from hat
To choose the bride and groom
for the wedding ceremony, the
names of one boy and one girl
camper were drawn from a hat.
Beth Astor, 12, was chosen as
bride. Astor, who lost a tooth a
few days before the wedding,

has attended Camp Arazim for
four years.
"I like the spirit of the camp
and the people who work here a
lot," she Said.
The camper to staff ratio is 2.5
to 1. All staff members are col
lege students or graduates who
have majored in Judaic studies.
Children are having a great
time at the camp. Jonathan
Ehrenkrantz, 10, had so much
fun first session that he called
his parents in New York to ask if
he could stay second session.

GETTING ACQUAINTED —Like all good campers, participants in the all-Jewish camp being held this
summer are supposed to get to know each other. But their camp, where Hebrew is often spoken and
where religion is the focus, is substantially different from most summer experiences.
More than 200 children, in
grades 3-8, participated in the
first session, held July 6-25. Dur
ing the second session. July 27-
August 15. nearly 200 children
in grades 6-11 have studied the
five megilloth: the Book of
Esther, Book of Ruth, Song of
Songs, Lamentations and
Ecclesiastes. They will also learn
one of 10 Judaic specialties, such
as prayer-chanting. Torah read
ing and Jewish cooking.
Camp Arazim is a
conservative-movement camp
sponsored by conservative con
gregations of northern Califor
nia. It has been operating for four
years. In 1972, when it opened in
Soquel, only 65 campers at
tended the three-week session.
Since then, the program has ex
panded so rapidly that it has
outgrown the Soquel facilities.
The Stanford campus will
serve as the camp location only
until a permanent home for it is
found. This summer the camp is

located in Toyon Hall. Mitchell
feels that Toyon is "a great
place to hold a camp." since
children can take advantage of
the recreational facilities in and
around Stanford.
"Campers are hardly aware of
their proximity to civilization,"
Mitchell said. Toyon has been
changed so much that few would
believe it is the same dormitory-
Four rooms have been converted
into mock-synagogues — com
plete with Torahs and prayer
books. Campers even follow a
different time system. The camp
operates on standard time so
children can take full advantage
of daylight hours.
Most children who attend the
camp are from northern Califor
nia, although some have come
from as far as Israel.
"We do not want to be known
as a camp for rich kids," said
Mitchell. "We try to keep the
cost low enough so every Jewish
child can participate in a Jewish
living experience."

serve as the camp location only
until a permanent home for it is
found. This summer the camp is

located in Toyon Hall. Mitchell
feels that Toyon is "a great
place to hold a camp." since
children can take advantage of
the recreational facilities in and
around Stanford.
"Campers are hardly aware of
their proximity to civilization,"
Mitchell said. Toyon has been
changed so much that few would
believe it is the same dormitory-
Four rooms have been converted
into mock-synagogues — com
plete with Torahs and prayer
books. Campers even follow a
different time system. The camp
operates on standard time so
children can take full advantage
of daylight hours.
Most children who attend the
camp are from northern Califor
nia, although some have come
from as far as Israel.
"We do not want to be known
as a camp for rich kids," said
Mitchell. "We try to keep the
cost low enough so every Jewish
child can participate in a Jewish
living experience."
Bagels, blintzes and borscht.
That's what nearly 400 children
have been eating here this sum
mer.
The children are participating
in Camp Arazin, the first all-
Jewish summer camp held here.
The program tries "to give cam
pers the experience of living in a
total Jewish environment," said
director Jack Gruenberg.
In addition to eating tradi
tional Jewish food and observing
the Jewish dietary laws, campers
speak Hebrew as much as possi
ble. They wear Kipot, skull caps,
to help them maintain a sense of
community identity.
Each day they attend
shacharit, a traditional morning
service. On Sabbath, following
the Jewish customs, campers do
not use electrical appliances,
watch television, ride in cars or
write.
For Jews, "education, religion
and recreation are equally im
portant," explained Sheldon
Mitchell, the camp administra
tive director.
Prayer important
"To maintain the Jewish life
style in our program, prayer be
comes as important as sports,
and study becomes as important
as swimming and eating,"
Mitchell said.
After campers attend morning
services and eat breakfast, they
participate in a class on the camp
theme; attend workshops in
dance, arts and crafts, music or
drama; take part in different
sports; and receive swimming
instruction.
Campers spend their after
noons on trips to different points
of interest in the local area.

At night special camp events
take place. During the first
three-week session, when the
camp theme was the Jewish life
cycle and its symbols, evening
activities included a mock Bar
Mitzvah and a mock Jewish
wedding.
Drawn from hat
To choose the bride and groom
for the wedding ceremony, the
names of one boy and one girl
camper were drawn from a hat.
Beth Astor, 12, was chosen as
bride. Astor, who lost a tooth a
few days before the wedding,

has attended Camp Arazim for
four years.
"I like the spirit of the camp
and the people who work here a
lot," she Said.
The camper to staff ratio is 2.5
to 1. All staff members are col
lege students or graduates who
have majored in Judaic studies.
Children are having a great
time at the camp. Jonathan
Ehrenkrantz, 10, had so much
fun first session that he called
his parents in New York to ask if
he could stay second session.

GETTING ACQUAINTED —Like all good campers, participants in the all-Jewish camp being held this
summer are supposed to get to know each other. But their camp, where Hebrew is often spoken and
where religion is the focus, is substantially different from most summer experiences.
More than 200 children, in
grades 3-8, participated in the
first session, held July 6-25. Dur
ing the second session. July 27-
August 15. nearly 200 children
in grades 6-11 have studied the
five megilloth: the Book of
Esther, Book of Ruth, Song of
Songs, Lamentations and
Ecclesiastes. They will also learn
one of 10 Judaic specialties, such
as prayer-chanting. Torah read
ing and Jewish cooking.
Camp Arazim is a
conservative-movement camp
sponsored by conservative con
gregations of northern Califor
nia. It has been operating for four
years. In 1972, when it opened in
Soquel, only 65 campers at
tended the three-week session.
Since then, the program has ex
panded so rapidly that it has
outgrown the Soquel facilities.
