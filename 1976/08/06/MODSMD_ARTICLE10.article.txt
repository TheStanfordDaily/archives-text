# Economics helped shrink Victorian-era families

### Bill Wien 
A decline in sexual activity among
urban professionals in 19th-century
America may have been caused not only
by Victorian attitudes but by economic
factors as well, a new report suggests.
A remarkably detailed sex survey
begun in the 1890s by a female student
here and U.S. censuses helped
Economics Professors Paul David and
Warren Sanderson reach this and other
tentative conclusions in the first attempt
at a quantitative history of contraception
in Victorian America.
The questionnaire used by the Stan
ford student. Clelia Duel Mosher, 50
years before Kinsey is "a veritable
Rosetta Stone for the study of the demog
raphic and social history of an important
segment of the American population."
the economists said, in a paper prepared
for the recent Western Economics As
sociation meetings in San Francisco.
Findings lost
Mosher. an 1893 Stanford graduate, in
1900 became one of the first women to
earn an M.D. at Johns Hopkins Univer
sity. She collected her data in the course
of her travels among American univer
sities. which included a return here as a
member of the Department of Hygiene.
Her findings lay unnoticed in the Uni

versity archives until History Prof. Carl
Degler discovered them a few years ago.
The Mosher Survey dealt with the sex
ual and reproductive experience of mar
ried women, many of whom were the
wives of university professors. David
and Sanderson found that, in their fertil
ity and marital durations, members of
this group were surprisingly representa
tive of the wives of urban professionals
in the U.S. at large circa 1900.
Those age 25 to 34 reported having
intercourse with their husbands an aver
age of four to five times per month. Those
age 35 to 44 reported an average fre
quency of three to four times per month.
Kinsey comparison
This compares with an average fre
quency of more than seven times per
month reported for younger married
women in the Kinsey studies for 1935-50
and roughly 5.5 for the older age group.
More recent findings from the 1970 Na
tional Fertility Survey for the United
States indicate average frequencies of 8.5
times per month among women age 25 to
34 and 6.4 times among women age 35 to
44.
Among the suggestive patterns relat
ing to contraceptive practice before 1914
is a wider use of methods such as douch
ing and periodic continence than retros

pective inference from 20th century evi
dence has led historians to suppose.
The fertility of those in the iMosher
Survey who reported using these
methods was considerably lower than
one would expect (even considerng their
low coital frequencies) if the pre-modern
forms of douche and periodic continence
were as wholly ineffectual as a reading of
historians might lead one to surmise.
The economists' detailed mathemati
cal modeling of various contraceptive
techniques indicates that the effective
ness of these inherently unreliable, in
termediate methods in limiting
childbirths is significantly enhanced
when the frequency of intercouse re
mains comparatively low.
Economic forces
Analysis of economic data for the same
period shows that urban professional
couples had a fairly strong incentive to
keep their families small because their
economic status was static or even de
clining compared to the rest of society.
"Members of the professional class
also were strongly motivated to reduce
their fertility to bring it in line with the
continuing decline in infant and child
mortality," the economists said.
"Equally crucial, professional couples
were in a favored position to make effec

tive use of the weak contraceptive
technology that was available from the
1850s onward. Its effectiveness was en
hanced by relatively low levels of coital
frequency," they noted.
In urban portions of the Northeast, na
tive white women of native parents, born
as early as 1845-54, averaged fewer than
three births during their lifetime.
In Rhode Island, Cleveland and Min
neapolis, those married from 10 to 19
years and under age 45 at the turn of the
century had an average of only 2.4 births.
This compares with an average of 2.9
children among similar urban white
women as late as 1970.

This compares with an average fre
quency of more than seven times per
month reported for younger married
women in the Kinsey studies for 1935-50
and roughly 5.5 for the older age group.
More recent findings from the 1970 Na
tional Fertility Survey for the United
States indicate average frequencies of 8.5
times per month among women age 25 to
34 and 6.4 times among women age 35 to
44.
Among the suggestive patterns relat
ing to contraceptive practice before 1914
is a wider use of methods such as douch
ing and periodic continence than retros

pective inference from 20th century evi
dence has led historians to suppose.
The fertility of those in the iMosher
Survey who reported using these
methods was considerably lower than
one would expect (even considerng their
low coital frequencies) if the pre-modern
forms of douche and periodic continence
were as wholly ineffectual as a reading of
historians might lead one to surmise.
The economists' detailed mathemati
cal modeling of various contraceptive
techniques indicates that the effective
ness of these inherently unreliable, in
termediate methods in limiting
childbirths is significantly enhanced
when the frequency of intercouse re
mains comparatively low.
Economic forces
Analysis of economic data for the same
period shows that urban professional
couples had a fairly strong incentive to
keep their families small because their
economic status was static or even de
clining compared to the rest of society.
"Members of the professional class
also were strongly motivated to reduce
their fertility to bring it in line with the
continuing decline in infant and child
mortality," the economists said.
"Equally crucial, professional couples
were in a favored position to make effec

tive use of the weak contraceptive
technology that was available from the
1850s onward. Its effectiveness was en
hanced by relatively low levels of coital
frequency," they noted.
In urban portions of the Northeast, na
tive white women of native parents, born
as early as 1845-54, averaged fewer than
three births during their lifetime.
In Rhode Island, Cleveland and Min
neapolis, those married from 10 to 19
years and under age 45 at the turn of the
century had an average of only 2.4 births.
This compares with an average of 2.9
children among similar urban white
women as late as 1970.
A decline in sexual activity among
urban professionals in 19th-century
