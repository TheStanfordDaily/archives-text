LIVE LONG AND PROSPER—Trekkies, disappointed by the loss
of their favorite television show for the entire summer, can
console themselves over a Klingon beer this weekend at the
Oakland Star Trek Convention at the Municipal Auditorium.
Leonard Nimoy, above, William Shatner and DeForest Kelley
will all be there. Call BASS Tickets for details.
