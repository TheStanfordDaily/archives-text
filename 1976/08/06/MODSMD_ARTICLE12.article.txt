# Too dry? Blame Sol
## 
### 
Every few years, various parts
of the world suffer from
droughts. And each time, folks
get together and try to decide
what's causing the dry spell.
They must be running out of
clever ideas — they're blaming
the sun for being too sunny.
There's a "persistent suspi
cion" that the current lack of
sunspots on Sol's surface is re
lated to the current lack of rain
on Earth's surface, says the Na
tional Geographic Society.

The society puts it this way:
"Without sunspots, there's not
enough rain and crops are
burned out, causing all kinds of
problems from the farm to the
grocery store, from country
swimmin' hole to city bathtub."
Thank God their magazine
isn't written like that.
The "sunspot connection"
maybe coincidental, they admit,
but some scientists have noted a
remarkable series of parched
years coming during slack
sunspot seasons.
