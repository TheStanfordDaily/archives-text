Could you please clarify the
University's policy regarding
the parking spaces in front of
Crothers Hall? I thought 1 re
member your column saying
(hat during the summer any stu
dent permit was allowed to park
in the spaces due to the vacancy
of Crothers. I did and received a
parking citation.-E.C.
Any summer student (that's
the Catch-22) living in an on
campus residence can park
there. You must have a black and
white summer residence sticker.
Any other type won't work.

1 am surprised that your inquiry
about Catherine the Great's in
timate and fatal liaison with a
horse encountered ignorance in
the faculty of the History De
partment. I thought this was
common knowledge among his
torians in the know. At least it
was at Union College and Har
vard when I was a student. Stan
ford is apparently more provin
cial than 1 had believed.-P.V.T.
We attempted to substantiate
your story by contacting Russian
history professors at both in
stitutions. Unfortunately profes
sors there never come into their
offices so we couldn't find them.
However, it doesn't really sur
prise us that the Stanford of the
East continues to hold on to out
dated rumors. After all, it's tradi
tional.
One final note that is true es
caped us in our previous col
umn. Not only did Catherine die
on the toilet, she died on the
Polish throne. After Russia had
finished dividing up Poland into
nothing, she apparently thought
it would be appropriate to use
the Polish throne in such a man
ner.

I am a resident of Crothers
Memorial. Under my shaving
mirror is a tiny slot labeled
"Drop Used Blades Here=~" This
bothers me. How can 1 possibly
put my blades in there, not
knowing to what end they might
come? Help!—K.Y.W.
Those seeking to im
memorialize themselves at Stan
ford might well consider drop
ping an initialed blade into one
of these slots. According to Rich
Richardson, maintenance
supervisor of student resi-

dences, these chutes have not
been cleaned out since World
War 11 (when the dorms were
constructed) and won't be until
2050.
If you take the big step and
drop your blade, it will plummet
into a chute directly under the
bathroom. Most, Richardson
said, have about two cubic feet of
razor blades in them already and
have another 12 to 15 feet to go.
Don't think that the mainte
nance supervisor spends all his
time investigating partially fil
led razor blade chutes, though.
Actually Richardson discovered
this phenomenon quite by acci
dent when his staff accidentally
dug into one of the chutes while
trying to fix something else.

about Catherine the Great's in
timate and fatal liaison with a
horse encountered ignorance in
the faculty of the History De
partment. I thought this was
common knowledge among his
torians in the know. At least it
was at Union College and Har
vard when I was a student. Stan
ford is apparently more provin
cial than 1 had believed.-P.V.T.
We attempted to substantiate
your story by contacting Russian
history professors at both in
stitutions. Unfortunately profes
sors there never come into their
offices so we couldn't find them.
However, it doesn't really sur
prise us that the Stanford of the
East continues to hold on to out
dated rumors. After all, it's tradi
tional.
One final note that is true es
caped us in our previous col
umn. Not only did Catherine die
on the toilet, she died on the
Polish throne. After Russia had
finished dividing up Poland into
nothing, she apparently thought
it would be appropriate to use
the Polish throne in such a man
ner.

I am a resident of Crothers
Memorial. Under my shaving
mirror is a tiny slot labeled
"Drop Used Blades Here=~" This
bothers me. How can 1 possibly
put my blades in there, not
knowing to what end they might
come? Help!—K.Y.W.
Those seeking to im
memorialize themselves at Stan
ford might well consider drop
ping an initialed blade into one
of these slots. According to Rich
Richardson, maintenance
supervisor of student resi-

dences, these chutes have not
been cleaned out since World
War 11 (when the dorms were
constructed) and won't be until
2050.
If you take the big step and
drop your blade, it will plummet
into a chute directly under the
bathroom. Most, Richardson
said, have about two cubic feet of
razor blades in them already and
have another 12 to 15 feet to go.
Don't think that the mainte
nance supervisor spends all his
time investigating partially fil
led razor blade chutes, though.
Actually Richardson discovered
this phenomenon quite by acci
dent when his staff accidentally
dug into one of the chutes while
trying to fix something else.


Could you please clarify the
University's policy regarding
the parking spaces in front of
Crothers Hall? I thought 1 re
member your column saying
(hat during the summer any stu
dent permit was allowed to park
in the spaces due to the vacancy
of Crothers. I did and received a
parking citation.-E.C.
Any summer student (that's
the Catch-22) living in an on
campus residence can park
there. You must have a black and
white summer residence sticker.
Any other type won't work.
