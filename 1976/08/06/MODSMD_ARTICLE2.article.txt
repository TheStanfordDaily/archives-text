# Flores released; coming to teach

### Dave Ansley 
Fernando Flores, a former Chi
lean cabinet minister, was re
leased from jail yesterday and ar
rives this morning to begin work
here.
Imprisoned three years ago,
after the overthrow of Salvador
Allende's government, Flores,
33, will take a permanent post in
the Computer Science Depart
ment, a job that was offered to
him last year.
Stanford officials have been
working with Amnesty Interna
tional, a worldwide organization
seeking freedom for political
prisoners, to encourage Flores'
release.
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park) and groups includ
ing Chile Democratico and the
National Coordination Group for
Chile Solidarity have also been
working for Flores' freedom.
Word was received last Friday
that Flores would be released.
He was due to be let out of jail
yesterday in Santiago, taken di
rectly to an airport and flown to
the United States.
Flores, accompanied by his
wife and five children, should
arrive at San Francisco Interna
tional Airport this morning.
Temporary housing for the fam
ily has already been provided.
His release "came as a corn

plete surprise," according to
Charles Meyers, dean of the law
school, who has been represent
ing Stanford in efforts to free
Flores.
Attempts to convince the
Chile government to let Flores
come to this country have failed
repeatedly. Meyers said he had
personally become "pessimis
tic" about Flores' chances for
freedom.
But last Friday. Meyers heard
from a friend, who is acting as
Stanford's lawyer in Santiago,
that Flores was to be set free.
Later confirmations of the news
came from McCloskey and the
State Department.
Neither Meyes, Amnesty In
ternational nor McCloskey's of
fice knew why the Chileans sud
denly changed their minds. But
the decision may have been re
lated to a meeting between
McCloskey and the Chilean am
bassador, Manuel Trucco, last
week.
According to a McCloskey
staff member, the congressman
raised the question of Flores'
imprisonment, because almost
all other Allende cabinet officers
have already been freed. The
staff member said that Trucco
seemed surprised to hear that
Flores was still in prison and
that he was unable to explain the
situation.
