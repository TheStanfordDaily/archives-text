## Steve Martin's humor delights 
### Ron Beck 
"You paid how much to see
me?" comedian Steve Martin
asked the Boarding House audi
ence earlier this week.
"Four dollars," a few less-in
hibited members of the crowd
answered.
"Four dollars?" Martin re
peated incredulously. "You paid
four dollars to see me?" Martin
could hardly hold his laughter
back.
There's little doubt that Mar
tin is one of the zaniest come
dians presently on the nightclub
circuit. His mixture of comic
stories, props and crazy facial
expressions have attracted a
nationwide following. That and
his numerous appearances on
The Tonight Show.
Martin ties together an amaz
ing amount of one-liners, banjo
songs, card tricks, juggling
stunts and balloon animals into a
solid hour and a half of laughter.
"I like to perform a miraculous
feat in every one of my shows,"
Martin deadpanned, "so I'm
going to try and suck the piano
through this straw into my
lungs."
The resulting failure didn't
bother him at all. "Oh well."
Martin is of the same breed as
Albert Brooks and Woody Allen,
who all string together a bunch
of absolutely ridiculous lines.
"I love people who ask if I
mind that they smoke," he
started off. "No, do you mind if I

fart? It's just a habit of mine. It's
great after sex."
After the laughter dies down,
Martin quickly shifts to new to
pics.
"Crowds used to be a lot flip
per than they are now. They'd
come to the show stoned, and I'd
be stoned. Afterwards someone
would usually come backstage
and ask me if I wanted to smoke
some shit.
"No thanks, I'm not into
marijuana."
"No man, this isn't marijuana,
this is shit, man, I roll my own
now. It's a lot cheaper that way."
Martin ends his show by walk
ing out of the theatre with the
audience and improvising in the
street. That would be weird
enough, but Martin usually does
it with a balloon animal hat,
fake nose and glasses, and a pair
of rabbit ears. If he sounds
strange enough to merit seeing,
he'll be at the Boarding House
through Sunday evening.
Despite what Martin implies,
it's well worth the money.
