# 'The Gingerbread Lady': Foothill's fragile drama
## 
### Jan Miller 
Enter the lives of the former star vocalist, now a
reformed alcoholic with a tormenting lover and
concerned daughter, the frustrated, aspiring
homosexual actor and the fanatically beautiful
woman shaken by divorce, and there you have
The Gingerbread Lady.
Written by Neil Simon, the success of The
Gingerbread Lady hinges entirely on the perfor
mance of one actress. Marti Stevens as the brash,
sarcastic and even vulgar Evy Meara is unsurpas
sed in making The Gingerbread Lady an over
whelmingly successful addition to Foothill Col
lege's Summerepertory '76 season.
Her daughter Polly Meara, played by Leslie Rit
ter, shines as the sun in the blackened lives of
those around her. Cajoling, caring, demanding
and persevering, Ritter is perfect as the seemingly
straight-laced, typically no-bra pot-smoking
youngster. Well reared by her father due to their
broken home, she frantically fights to communi
cate on her mother's level in order to save their
relationship from crumbling as her gingerbread
house did long ago..
The hyperactive homosexual who is dependa
bly over-concerned with Evy's welfare is Jimmy
Perry. Acted convincingly though not mincingly
by William Hines, Jimmy is the aspiring actor: "I

want to be a big star, not a little star."
Conceited, insecure Toby Landau is well
brought off by Lois Jaschob. Ironically, the com
bination of her divorce, coupled with Jimmy's
humiliating dismissal from his acting job return
Evy to the bottle and to her unscrupulous and
tormenting lover.
Manuel, the fast talking spanish delivery boy,
who adds a light touch to the somberness of the
play, is well acted by Ronald Ross although his
accent fades in his longer monologues.
Executive director Doyne Mraz knew his actors
well in casting the brilliantly jocular, though seri
ous piece. Although a certain amount of profanity
is necessary for a play of this nature, a good deal of
the desecrational oratories are superfluous to the
plot.
Sets by Paul Strayer are appropriately un
polished, but it appears that lack of funding or
time may have been the reason for the disjointed
array that is purportedly the inside of the
Brownstone apartment in New York City where
the action takes place.
Leading it's audience on an emotional tour
through the crumbling lives of it's actors The
Gingerbread draws both laughter and tears
equally as it dashes dreams and ultimately leaves
it's audience with hope for the future of the group.
