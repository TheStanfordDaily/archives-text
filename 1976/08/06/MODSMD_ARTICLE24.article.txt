# The
						Ashland story: Shakespearean splendor nursed on community pride

Hidden away in Oregon's
scenic Rogue River Valley just
north of the California-Oregon
border, a vacation experience of
a lifetime awaits the avid theatre
fan this summer â€” just as it has
for the past 40 years.
The Oregon Shakespeare Fes
tival traces its roots back to July
4. 1935. when a young Shakes
peare enthusiast named Angus
L. Bowmer convinced the town
of Ashland to let him stage a
shoestring production of The
Merchant of Venice as part of a
Fourth of July celebration. The
town only relented after arrang
ing to stage a boxing match pre
ceding the play in order to gain
some profits to offset the ex
pected losses from Bowmer's
"high-browed" entertainment.
But Bowmer proved more of a
fighter than the boxers them
selves. After daringly calling his
production "The First Annual
Shakespearean Festival,"

Bovvmer built a makeshift stage
on the ruins of the long
abandoned Chautauqua Theatre
and presented a dazzling per
formance of Merchant. The pro
fits from his popular production
helped offset the losses from the
boxing matches held earlier that
afternoon. But most importantly,
some of the profits were saved to
help finance the Second Annual
Festival.
From those humble origins,
the Festival has grown in size
and stature year by year. The
Oregon Shakespearean Festival
Association (OSFA) was formed
in 1936 as a non-profit corpora
tion. The Company began ac
cumulating sets and costumes
and enlarging its skeleton staff.
In the late 1940'5. the Festival
embarked on its now-famous
history cycle, committing itself
to present all of Shakespeare's
seldom-performed history plays
in order, one each season. As the
Festival entered the 1950'5, new

programs were established to
provide a fuller Festival experi
ence for the summer visitor. The
OSFA also implemented a scho
larship program to attract young
actors and actresses.
In short, not only did the Fes
tival grow during the 1940's and
'50's, but it matured as well.
The two most striking changes
in the Festival since its inception
have both taken place in the
1970'5. Construction began on
an indoor theatre having an un
derground link to the
Elizabethan stage so that
backstage facilities could be
shared by both theatres. On
March 21, 1970, the Angus
Bowmer Indoor Theatre was de
dicated.
Designed by Stanford
graduate Richard Hay (who also
designed the Elizabethan stage),
the strikingly modern Bowmer
Theatre seats 600 in a semi-circle
and at a sharp rake, so that no
audience member is very far

from the action on the stage. The
stage itself is amazingly pliable,
capable of being shaped into al
most any configuration.
Once Ashland had a second
stage at its disposal, it was ready
to embark on the second part of
its expansion plan: year-round
theatre. The first season of
spring plays, called Festival/
Stage 11, opened in 1970 and ran
for six weeks. Since then, the
Spring season has steadily ex
panded. Also, the new theatre is
used for matinees during the
summer season.
The Festival offers a coveted
opportunity for aspiring theatre
professionals to gain a foothold
in their ever-competitive trade.
For many Festival actors and ac
tresses, their stint in Ashland
immediately follows graduation
from college and represents their
final stepping stone before
breaking into professional ranks.
The players are not under Equity
contract and the token pay they
receive (hardly enough to cover
living expenses) comes in the
form of scholarships.
But financial considerations
are of low priority to all Festival
participants. Most of the theatre
house staff are local townsfolk
working on a volunteer basis.
For both the players and the pro
duction staff, the main attributes
available at Ashland are experi
ence, prestige and fun.
Each season, the Festival par
ticipants resemble a family, at
tending lectures together in the
afternoons and relaxing in local
taverns during the late evenings.
One of the trademarks of the
Ashland Festival is the general
assumption that every particip
ant will be willing to help out in

any manner required, regardless
of his or her official capacity.
Some actors spend as much time
in the set and pro shops as they
spend on the stage.
Shakespeare's plays serve as a
catalyst for a wide variety of ex
citing educational opportunities
available in Ashland. Daily
backstage tours led by Festival
actors and technicians provide
a whole new perspective for the
theatre enthusiast. Lectures by
Festival participants and promi
nent guests take place almost
daily, often held in picturesque
Lithia Park. Festival musicians
perform small concerts and de
monstrations continually
throughout the summer.
On a larger scale, the Festival
conducts an extensive high
school student educational
program during the spring. In
fact, students comprise up to
one-half the total audience dur
ing the spring season. In addi
tion, the Festival sponsors a
highly successful program
which takes actors into schools
throughout the Pacific North
west to work directly with
teachers and students in their
classrooms.
Of greatest interest to college
students is the Festival's Insti
tute of Renaissance Studies. For
six weeks every summer the In
stitute offers a campus in the
spirit of the Festival. To quote
the Institute, "We reject the no
tion that high academic stan
dards require boredom or pain."
The campus makes full use of
all the Festival's riches: the two
theatres, the company of over 150
actors, directors, designers,
technicians, dancers, musicians,
