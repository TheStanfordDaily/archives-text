Reagan hunt goes on
NEW YORK—Republican presidential
challenger Ronald Reagan and his run
ning mate, Senator Richard Schweiker of
Pennsylvania, traveled to New York and
New Jersey yesterday to search for dele
gate support. Reagan said the tide was
turning in his favor.
The former California governor repor
tedly picked up five uncommitted dele
gates from the two states. They argued
that only a Reagan-Schweiker ticket
could beat Jimmy Carter in November.
Reagan's selection of Schweiker has
reportedly given President Gerald Ford a
wider choice of possible running mates.
Some eastern Republicans are urging
Ford to retain vice president Nelson
Rockefeller on his ticket, while former
Texas governor John Connally has been
widely mentioned as a possible choice.
In Detroit yesterday, Connally said
there was no evidence that could elimi
nate him from consideration, and called
statements linking Connally's image
with Richard Nixon "cowardly." Repub
lican Congressmen Tom Railsback and
William Cohen have made such asser
tions.
Mysterious illness kills
HARRISBURG, Pa.—The mysterious
illness afflicting American Legion con
ventioneers in Pennsylvania claimed a
23rd life yesterday while scientists tried
to determine the identity of the disease.
The illness so far has struck over 160
persons whose common link was attend
ing a convention two weeks ago in

Philadelphia. Officials last night were
investigating the possibility of a 24th
disease-related death.
Researchers have all but ruled out the
possibility that the disease is swine flu.
Medical investigators in Harrisburg and
at Atlanta's Center for Disease Control
are now examining other viruses and
poisons as possible causes of the disease.
Divers seek bodies
LOVELAND, Col. —Scuba divers yes
terday searched the murky waters of the
Big Thomson River for flood victims
trapped in dozens of submerged cars and
campers last weekend. More than 100
victims of the disaster have been reco
vered. but only a third of them have been
identified.
Authorities said that an accurate count
of the missing is impossible, but the Red
Cross has reported that it has a list of 800
missing persons compiled from inter
views with survivors and nearly 4000 in
quiries from relatives and friends.
Carter: pardon no issue
WASHINGTON —Jimmy Carter has
said he doesn't want to make the Nixon
pardon a campaign issue, but the ques
tion cropped up again during interviews

yesterday. The Democratic candidate
said that he might have pardoned
Richard Nixon himself — but only after a
trial and what Carter called "the inevita
ble conviction."
Carter refused to criticize President
Ford's pardon, saying he thought Ford
was doing what he deemed best for the
country. But Carter said he would use the
Watergate scandals generally as an issue
and would argue that Ford's policies are
little different from Nixon's.
Chinese rap Soviets
TOKYO—The Peking government
yesterday blasted recent Soviet military
buildups, calling Moscow leaders "the

Mediterranean. China called the move
part of Soviet "gunboat policy" to rule
the seas.
The official New China News Agency
and the communist party newspaper
People's Dailyboth said the Soviet milit
ary buildup had increased Mideast ten
sions and constituted blackmail of West
ern Europe and the United States.
The chief of U.S. forces in Europe,
General Alexander Haig, said the Soviet
buildup might become worrisome if it
continued.
