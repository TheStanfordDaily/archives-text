# Planners see gold in arches
## Shopping center grows 
### Kit Warfield 
All summer a continuous
rainbow painted on tempor
ary walls has led shoppers
through the maze of path
ways at Stanford Shopping
Center.
One wonders whether
somewhere amid the dust and
bulldozers there is an end to
that rainbow, and a pot of
gold.
Actually there are several
pots of gold going into the ex
tensive four-phase moderni
zation of the center, accord
ing to John Breedlove, man
ager of land resources for the
University.
The Board of Trustees "ap
proved funding for up to $17
million for the entire pro
ject," he notes.
"We're hoping not to spend

that much," says Breedlove.
Spending on Phase I, how
ever, will use up a substantial
portion of the $17 million
though "it will cost less than
half the total amount," he
says.
The first phase, to be com
pleted in November, involves
substantial improvements to
the existing mall. Storefronts
are being remodeled and
huge steel arches have been
put in place to create en
tranceways and a series of
mini-malls. The vast waste
land of parking lots will be
landscaped with over 680
trees.
Plans call for two new
buildings at the west end of
the shopping center, a third
building constructed in 1978


GOLDEN ARCHES?â€”Massive steel arches weighing eight tons
each were lifted into place at the west end of the mall last week.
The bent pipe arches vault 2Vi stories above the mall to support a
freestanding roof of wood and brown-tinted plexiglass.
