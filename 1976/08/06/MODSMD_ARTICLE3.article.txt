# Planners see gold in arches
## Shopping center grows 
### Kit Warfield 
All summer a continuous
rainbow painted on tempor
ary walls has led shoppers
through the maze of path
ways at Stanford Shopping
Center.
One wonders whether
somewhere amid the dust and
bulldozers there is an end to
that rainbow, and a pot of
gold.
Actually there are several
pots of gold going into the ex
tensive four-phase moderni
zation of the center, accord
ing to John Breedlove, man
ager of land resources for the
University.
The Board of Trustees "ap
proved funding for up to $17
million for the entire pro
ject," he notes.
"We're hoping not to spend

that much," says Breedlove.
Spending on Phase I, how
ever, will use up a substantial
portion of the $17 million
though "it will cost less than
half the total amount," he
says.
The first phase, to be com
pleted in November, involves
substantial improvements to
the existing mall. Storefronts
are being remodeled and
huge steel arches have been
put in place to create en
tranceways and a series of
mini-malls. The vast waste
land of parking lots will be
landscaped with over 680
trees.
Plans call for two new
buildings at the west end of
the shopping center, a third
building constructed in 1978


GOLDEN ARCHES?—Massive steel arches weighing eight tons
each were lifted into place at the west end of the mall last week.
The bent pipe arches vault 2Vi stories above the mall to support a
freestanding roof of wood and brown-tinted plexiglass.

and a "major specialty store
probably similar to I. Magnin
or Saks" to be built in 1981,
according to Breedlove.
The Stanford Shopping
Center actually belongs to the
University, though Stanford
has no hand in the center's
management. The University
planners decided in the early
70s that it was time for the
20-year-old shopping center
to have a facelift.
"The center was built in the
mid-'sos and had reached a
point where it was really
looking out of date," says
Breedlove. "Also, we had a
large number of leases expir
ing between 1975 and 1981,
many of them 20-year leases
dating from when the shop
ping center first opened. It
seemed like a good time to go
in and do a little moderniz
ing."
How are the changes being
funded?
"It's an outright investment
of Stanford endowment

funds, just like an investment
in stocks or bonds. It has no
thing to do with University
operating funds," Breedlove
explains.
It is not surprising that the
new architecture at the mall
reflects the prevailing charac
ter on campus. In fact, the
eight-ton steel arches that
span 2Vz stories above the
brick-plazas-to-be were de
signed as a modern treatment
of the campus's Romanesque
arches, according to Director
of Facilities and Properties
James Nelson.
"Our goal in the center is
comparable to our goal on the
Stanford campus." he says.
"We attempt to provide the
proper setting to accomplish
a desired result. In the case of
our campus buildings, we
provide the maximum con
venience to further the learn
ing process. In the case of the
center, our goal is to provide
our tenants with the best at
mosphere to sell merchan
dise."

ager of land resources for the
University.
The Board of Trustees "ap
proved funding for up to $17
million for the entire pro
ject," he notes.
"We're hoping not to spend

that much," says Breedlove.
Spending on Phase I, how
ever, will use up a substantial
portion of the $17 million
though "it will cost less than
half the total amount," he
says.
The first phase, to be com
pleted in November, involves
substantial improvements to
the existing mall. Storefronts
are being remodeled and
huge steel arches have been
put in place to create en
tranceways and a series of
mini-malls. The vast waste
land of parking lots will be
landscaped with over 680
trees.
Plans call for two new
buildings at the west end of
the shopping center, a third
building constructed in 1978

each were lifted into place at the west end of the mall last week.

probably similar to I. Magnin
or Saks" to be built in 1981,
according to Breedlove.
The Stanford Shopping
Center actually belongs to the
University, though Stanford
has no hand in the center's
management. The University
planners decided in the early
70s that it was time for the
20-year-old shopping center
to have a facelift.
"The center was built in the
mid-'sos and had reached a
point where it was really
looking out of date," says
Breedlove. "Also, we had a
large number of leases expir
ing between 1975 and 1981,
many of them 20-year leases
dating from when the shop
ping center first opened. It
seemed like a good time to go
in and do a little moderniz
ing."
How are the changes being
funded?
"It's an outright investment
of Stanford endowment

funds, just like an investment
in stocks or bonds. It has no
thing to do with University
operating funds," Breedlove
explains.
It is not surprising that the
new architecture at the mall
reflects the prevailing charac
ter on campus. In fact, the
eight-ton steel arches that
span 2Vz stories above the
brick-plazas-to-be were de
signed as a modern treatment
of the campus's Romanesque
arches, according to Director
of Facilities and Properties
James Nelson.
"Our goal in the center is
comparable to our goal on the
Stanford campus." he says.
"We attempt to provide the
proper setting to accomplish
a desired result. In the case of
our campus buildings, we
provide the maximum con
venience to further the learn
ing process. In the case of the
center, our goal is to provide
our tenants with the best at
mosphere to sell merchan
dise."
All summer a continuous

One wonders whether
somewhere amid the dust and
