Construction boom
It is bad enough that the campus is cluttered
with buildings whose architecture is, as one art
professor likes to say, "pedestrian"; what is worse
is that the construction of these buildings is, ap
parently. perpetual.
There is nothing more annoying and unsightly
than the excavation meant to accommodate this or
that building. For a long time the law school site
provided much dirt for the cars of Stern Hall resi
dents. Today the pit for the Terman engineering
building is so windblown that the Stanford Press
and its neighboring buildings may soon be buried
under a layer of red dust.
And now we learn that the bookstore will soon
expand. The only sure result, I fear, willbeanugly
hole in the middle of campus — followed by
another banal building. Its competent landscap
ing and incomparable amount of open space make
Stanford's an attractive campus, scarred only by
construction. But the scars are proliferating.

Stolen sign
On September 20, Tom Watson will bring 20 of
his colleagues from the professional golf tour to
Stanford.
The beneficiaries of the entry fees and gallery
charges will be the golf course and the men's golf
team program.
Last year we put up a sign on the bridge which
crosses over the road beneath the first tee. That
sign cost about $700 to purchase, print and install.
It was stolen, and it occurred to me that this sign
might in fact be in someone's dormitory room.
Tom Watson's wife. Linda, asked whether I might

advertise well in advance of the tournament that
the sign was missing and that the tournament
sponsors would be grateful for the sign's return.

To clarify one point in Caryn Coulter's recent

feature about me (Daily, July 27), News Service
will provide informal help to members of the
Stanford community who prefer to work directly
with news media.
While we obviously are concerned about the
accuracy of our own releases, we have no illusions
about being the sole source of news at Stanford.
To the extent that we are seen as "gatekeepers,"
we prefer to keep the gates open as wide as possi
ble.
