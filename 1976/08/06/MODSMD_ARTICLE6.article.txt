The Olympics were hardly
over, and the picture tube on my
Sylvania black-and-white, 15
inch rectangular instant-on TV
set had hardly cooled before my
friend, Warren Mumpkenner,
was on the phone.
Mumpkenner, an old political
theorist and masterful rhetoriti
cian, informed me in no uncer
tain terms that he had some clas
sified rumors received from
sources high in the "right" cir
cles of Washington which he,
lowly Mumpkenner, was willing
to reveal to me and my typewri
ter for a bottle of Ripple he could
drink in the dark confines of his
abode deep in the basement of
Main Library.
He settled for a thermos of
rubbing alcohol I brought to him
as soon as I could find my shoes.
Mumpkenner wiped his
mouth with the back of his hand
and leaned toward me, whisper
ing. "The goverment has infor
mation which will restore the
confidence our capitalistic but
democratic system lost during
the Olympic Games."
"Who lost confidence in it?'
Mumpkenner raised his eyeb
rows in surprise. "The ten mill
ion beer-drinking auto-workers

across the country, that's who,
when they watched us face
humiliation at the hands of those
treacherous eastern Europeans."
"Most auto workers are in De
troit," I said.'
"Don't pick at the details," my
friend warned. "This was seri
ous. Our whole ideology was on
the verge of collapse."
"I didn't realize that."
"Of course you didn't"
Mumpkenner shouted. He
paused, then smiled. "But every
thing's okay now. The CIA has
the answer."
"To what?"
Mumpkenner ignored me, and
leaned forward again. "We now
know that Nadia Comaneci was
nothing more than a glorified
bionic woman." He smiled.
"Like one of those Disney
animatronic things." He shrug
ged. "And so were all the other
eastern bloc athletes. Which
means we couldn't possibly
have won. Which means they
cheated. Which means our
ideology isn't in trouble."
"Of course," I said.
Mumpkenner leaned back. "It
was all a communist plot."
