Roger Hardy, newly elected
president of United Stanford
Employees (USE) union, said
yesterday that he does not expect
a new union contract to be
signed by Sept. 1, the day the old
contract expires.
But he quickly amended that
statement by adding that he has
"every hope" that a settlement
will be reached by Sept. 1 "or
soon thereafter."
"Time is very short," he said,
"but we're going to take all the
time that it takes" to agree on a

new contract.
USE, which represents 1350
University technical, service
and maintenance employes, has
been conducting negotiations on
meetings with the University
since July 20.
Hardy charged that Doug Bar
ton, chief bargainer for the Uni
versity, has been stalling the
talks for two months by refusing
to present any monetary or be
nefit proposals.
Hardy said that the union
would go on strike "if we think
it's effective in gaining a con
tract settlement. But we think
there are other ways short of
that."
He said that USE has no
specific strike deadline, because
a decision to walk out would be
based largely on the "progress"
of the contract talks.
But he said that if there is no
progress by Oct. 1, there will
"certainly" be a strike.

"We would definitely take to
the streets." Hardy said.
The union struck for three
weeks in the spring of 1974.
Workers returned to their jobs
when the current contract was
signed.
