Mesothelioma, once rare, is a
cancer of the lung, chest or ab
dominal cavities. Researchers
now link the disease to asbestos,
and one study showed it to be
responsible for 10 out of 124
deaths of insulation workers.
Other studies have shown that
workers in the asbestos industry
die of lung cancer at five times
the expected rate. And asbestos
workers who smoke develop 90
times more lung cancer than
smokers without asbestos expo

"There is no cause for panic,"
Sidlow cautioned, "but there is

good reason to become aware ot
the hazard and avoid exposure.
Furthermore, by recognizing the
hazard, we can all help to elimi
nate it by reporting conditions
that should be corrected."
These include hot water pipe
coverings or other insulation
that may be loose and dangling
fibers that could blow off and be
carried in the air.

girders as fire retardants; these
areas have been posted as
dangerous and should be av

oided until they can be treated
with sealants or covered up to
hold the fibers securely in place,
Sidlow said.
Sidlow has been taking air
samples inside and outside
campus buildings since spring
and has found only very low
quantities of asbestos fibers
anywhere on the campus.

at Stanford sounds pretty good,"

exposure is too much. Why

now link the disease to asbestos,
and one study showed it to be
responsible for 10 out of 124
deaths of insulation workers.
Other studies have shown that
workers in the asbestos industry
die of lung cancer at five times
the expected rate. And asbestos
workers who smoke develop 90
times more lung cancer than
smokers without asbestos expo
sure.
"There is no cause for panic,"
Sidlow cautioned, "but there is

good reason to become aware ot
the hazard and avoid exposure.
Furthermore, by recognizing the
hazard, we can all help to elimi
nate it by reporting conditions
that should be corrected."
These include hot water pipe
coverings or other insulation
that may be loose and dangling
fibers that could blow off and be
carried in the air.
Other sources of asbestos in
clude asbestos compounds
sprayed on roof interiors and
girders as fire retardants; these
areas have been posted as
dangerous and should be av

oided until they can be treated
with sealants or covered up to
hold the fibers securely in place,
Sidlow said.
Sidlow has been taking air
samples inside and outside
campus buildings since spring
and has found only very low
quantities of asbestos fibers
anywhere on the campus.
"The low asbestos fiber count
at Stanford sounds pretty good,"
Sidlow said, "but I feel that any
exposure is too much. Why
should we get any at all if we can
avoid it completely?"
