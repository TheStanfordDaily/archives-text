New Kresge grant
The Kresge Foundation of
Troy. Michigan, has donated $1
million to the construction fund
for a new Main Library.
The new building, which will
more than double Stanford's
major research library space,
will cost approximately $20
million. Counting the Kresge
commitment, nearly half of that
total has been raised.
Kresge's support is in the form
of a "challenge" pledge, with
payment withheld until Stan
ford obtains the remaining funds

needed for the project.
The foundation's previous
contributions to Stanford have
enabled the building of Kresge
Auditorium in the new law
school and renovation of the
west wing of Encina Hall.
Noon concert

will perform on the Tresidder
Union patio at noon this Friday.
The concert will be free. Page is a
protest singer who was instru
mental in getting street music
legalized in Seattle.
