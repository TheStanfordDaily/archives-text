# Bug Me

What does it take to become a California resident
for tax purposes? I'm still registered to vote in
Massachusetts, but I've figured it have
saved me $ 130 last year had I paid California's
taxes instead of Massachusetts's. A friend of mine
says it's just a question of where I earned the
money, and that since I worked in California, all I
have to pay is Calfornia taxes. Is this true? -D.VV.
Actually you don't really have an option. Ac
cording to city hall, everyone who works in
California must pay California state income tax.
Consequently we've mailed your name and ad
dress to Jerry Brown.
It's also rather simple to change your voting
registration here. All you do is go to the registrar
and register.
Incidentally, our staff expressed surprise at the
revelation that Massachusetts residents pay
higher taxes than Californians. We would have
saved over $100 had we paid our taxes at home
(Arizona) rather than in California. I guess it costs
to live in such a superior state.

I've been meaning to ivrite in about this, as I have
no idea ivhom in the University to go to. Finally
decided today was the day after watching a
trailer-camperand a pickup truck make the same
mistake within 10 minutes. You know where
Panama Street runs into White Plaza between the
Nitery and the Energy Information Center? When
the poles that normally block off the Plaza are

taken down for University vehicles, which hap
pens almost daily, deluded drivers assume they
can go right in. Usually they take a spin around
the Plaza and come right out, hut yesterday I saw
one completely lost family stuck between the traf
fic barriers in front of the Biz School. Is there any
way the University can be convinced to put up at
least a sign saying "no thoroughfare"? Or better
yet, why not a "You Are Here" map? -A.G.
VVe read your letter to Steve Schmidt in the
Planning Office who promised to contact Plant
Services regarding your complaint. He also said
that he would suggest that drivers of University
vehicles be cautioned to put the poles back up
immediately after going through.

I recently heard an extremely upsetting rumor (or
so I pray); to wit, that you ivould be teaching in
Sacramento next year and consequently would
have to give up the column. Say it isn't so! -G.J.S.
Unlike most of the other scurrilous rumors
floating around at the end of summer, this one
unfortunately (or actually fortunately, consider
ing the teaching market) happens to be true. How
ever, like a phoenix, "Bug Me" will rise again in
the fall, under a different by-line, and, undoub
tedly with universal regret, under a different
photo.Our staffhas been wearing black armbands
for several weeks now, but such is life. Even the
writers of this column occasionally grow up and
become real live members of the working class.
