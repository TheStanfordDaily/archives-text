# 'The Tenant' an eerie trip into insanity
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
In The Tenant, Roman Polanski creates a
character named Trelkovsky who is that faceless
wallflower we have all encountered who seems
destined to fade into any scenery he happens
upon. At times his buffoonery is sadly funny, but
eventually it develops into a sadly pathetic state.
His destiny is to be stepped on, taken advantage
of, and generally ignored by the world.
His own life is so dissatisfying to him that he
unconsciously intrudes on the lives of those
around him, aimlessly drifting without a rudder
in his own life, searching for anything to latch
onto.
Polanski's story, by himself and Geard Brach,
chronicles an absorbing journey into madness of a
man unnoticed by society, buffetted about by
forces beyond his control, both internal and ex
ternal. Anything — anyone else — would be more
interesting by comparison to Trelkovksy's exis
tence.
When he tries to rent an apartment, he discovers
that the previous tenant — a masochistic girl
named Simone — attempted suicide but hasn't
succumbed yet. Already he is unconsciously in
truding on her life, first by wanting to see her
apartment and then by visiting her in the hospital.
The landlord (Melvyn Douglas) and-concierge
(Shelley Winters) alternately shut windows in his
face and avoid looking at him, almost as if he is so
inconsequential that he isn't there.
As his desperation increases, slowly but in
exorably his life encompasses possessions of
Simone's — her apartment, her mail, her friends,
even objects as normal as her brand of cigarettes. It
is only a matter of time before he is overtaken by
her habits and tendencies, too.
Polanski grips the audience as firmly as Simone's

presence grips Trelkovsky. Each descent Trel
kovsky takes from his own life is seemingly nor
mal and innocuous, but each occurrence joins
with the others until his doom is imminent.
He withdraws into a never-neverland where
paranoia is the order of the day and his apathetic
neighbors suddenly become violently concerned
with his destruction. But it is not only society that
motivates Trelkovsky. There is some fatal flaw
within him that makes him despise and shun
human contact and love of any sort. After making
love with one of Simone's friends, he is so re
pulsed that he heads for the toilet swirling with
nausea.
Trelkovsky rsembles Harry Moseby, the private
eye portrayed by Gene Hackman in Night Moves,
who had to observe the world around him rather
than participate in it. Particularly characteristic of
Trelkovsky is that he never does anything, but
things always happen to him.
Polanski treads a thin line between boredom
and fascination with firm and secure footing.
Rarely has an actor directed himself with such
skill and dexterity. Portraying someone so face
less and ultimately dull can be treacherous in
filmmaking because the possibility always exists
that the film itself will absorb the qualities of the
characterand become dull and faceless itself. This
possibility never presents itself in The Tenant,
however.
Polanski's portrayal of obsession gone awry
simultaneously entrances and horrifies. To think
that someone could be so dissatisfied with his
own existence that the life of another could so
easily overtake his own. The film is a subtle yet
jarring, smooth yet unsettling vision of hysteria.

THE TENANT—Roman
Polanski. director of Chinatown
and Repulsion, has created a
character of shocking
psychological disabilities in his
new film about a man who rents
the apartment of a woman who
committed suicide.
