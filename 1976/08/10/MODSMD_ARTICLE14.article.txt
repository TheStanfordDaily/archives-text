# Cleo Laine shines at the Fairmont
## 
### Alexander Leff 
Cleo Laine is one of the few vocalists
who actually deserves the honorific title
of song stylist. She takes a variety of
songs—pop. jazz and big band—and
gives them all original interpretations.
Laine accomplishes this by brewing her
diverse repertoire in her unique stvle,
with a pinch of jazz and a touch of theat
rics; and then filtering all of these ingre
dients through her magnificent vocal
technique.
Cleo put on a fine show at the Venetian
Room at the Fairmont Hotel in San Fran
cisco last Thursday. She was aided on
stage by her husband-collaborator John

Dankworth, their small combo and the
big band sound of the Venetian Room's
Ernie Heckscher Orchestra. The evenings
repertoire was a potpourri of songs from
such diverse talents as Ellington, Buffy
St. Marie and Geshwin. The intense bal
lad, "Until it's Time for You to Go," was
included, as was the jazzy "It Don't Mean
a Thing Unless You Got the Swing" and
the current disco hit "I Got the Music In
Me."
A singer with an astounding vocal
range. Laine covers territory from boomy
lows to soaring highs with disarming
ease and control.
She has a strong stage presence and

Cleo delivers her numbers with theatri
cal gestures and body movements.
Her husband was featured on clarinet
and alto saxophone. His very talented and
lively efforts on these instruments pro
vide punctuation to the orchestra's har
monies and a foil to his wife's singing.
Dankworth's and Laine's zesty yet
elegant presentation coupled with their
top-rate musical talents makes their
show rise far, far above the typical
night-club vocalist. Their show did have
two faults. First, Laine's articulation gets
hazy at some points. This can prove fatal
to expressive ballads or narratives.
Also, she commits a common error of
night-club singers who seek to incorpo

rate contemporary hits into their acts;
their unfamiliarity with Top 40 material
leads them to choose numbers that are
noticeably inferior to the rest of their re
pertoire. Cleo's inclusion of the pedest
rian hit "I've Got the Music in Me" is a
case in point.
But aside from these minor points of
criticism, Cleo Laine put on a lively and
enjoyable show. Although she has, in
years past, appeared in some of the Bay
Area's larger concert halls, the intimate
and elegant environment of the Venetian
room at the Fairmont in San Francisco
provides a stunning showcase for her
fine talents. She continues there, with
two shows nightly, until August 18.

A singer with an astounding vocal
range. Laine covers territory from boomy
lows to soaring highs with disarming
ease and control.
She has a strong stage presence and

Cleo delivers her numbers with theatri
cal gestures and body movements.
Her husband was featured on clarinet
and alto saxophone. His very talented and
lively efforts on these instruments pro
vide punctuation to the orchestra's har
monies and a foil to his wife's singing.
Dankworth's and Laine's zesty yet
elegant presentation coupled with their
top-rate musical talents makes their
show rise far, far above the typical
night-club vocalist. Their show did have
two faults. First, Laine's articulation gets
hazy at some points. This can prove fatal
to expressive ballads or narratives.
Also, she commits a common error of
night-club singers who seek to incorpo

rate contemporary hits into their acts;
their unfamiliarity with Top 40 material
leads them to choose numbers that are
noticeably inferior to the rest of their re
pertoire. Cleo's inclusion of the pedest
rian hit "I've Got the Music in Me" is a
case in point.
But aside from these minor points of
criticism, Cleo Laine put on a lively and
enjoyable show. Although she has, in
years past, appeared in some of the Bay
Area's larger concert halls, the intimate
and elegant environment of the Venetian
room at the Fairmont in San Francisco
provides a stunning showcase for her
fine talents. She continues there, with
two shows nightly, until August 18.
