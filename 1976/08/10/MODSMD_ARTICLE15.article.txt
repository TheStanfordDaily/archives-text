# The 						Foothill College repertory scene 'My Sister Eileen'
## 
### Jan Miller 
If you're looking for ashowatwhichyou can't
wait for the intermission because your cheeks and
stomach ache from too much ear-to-ear grinning
and all-out laughing, Foothill College's Sum
merepertory '76 theatre troupe has the answer: My
Sister Eileen.
The two short breaks in the two hour show
barely give you time to recover from the excep
tionally high comedy that leaves you chuckling
all the way home.
Director Marti Stevens deserves the lion's share
of the credit for making the 1940 play by Joseph A.
Fields and Jerome Chedrove such an exception
ally successful production. Her staging is tight,
fast-paced, witty and fun, and the conglomeration
of off-beat characters parading across the stage at
the most inopportune moments is a delightfully
refreshing addition.
The classic tale is about two sisters — one a
writer, the other an aspiring actress — and their
twelve-month stay in a most distracting Green
wich Village basement apartment. Through their
basement grating, the twirling life of the village,
its drunks and gamins, its hucksters and hustles
and cops seep, flow and sometimes come through

their apartment in an unwelcome deluge.
Although the typical smart but ugly, dumb but
pretty roles of the sisters are the essence of their
relationship, the cliche actually enhances the hi
larity rather than detracts from it.
Toni Tomei, in the role of Ruth Sherwood, and
Cori Hudson as the blonde-haired beauty, are
played off well against each other for the desired
contrast.
All of the actors are superb in
their portrayals, with a handful of the hodge
podge being exceptionally oustanding.
Among those are Jeffrey D. Mason as the very
un-suave Frank Lippencott, Eileen's free meal tic
ket at the local drugstore, and Leslie Ritter as
Violet Shelton, the sleazy, good-hearted call girl.
Other standouts included sweet, prissy Helen
Wade by Helen Wilson, the aggressive, gin
nipping reporter Chick (click-click) Clark by Gary
Graves, James Amato as the commander of the
Portuguese-speaking commander of the Brazilian
Consul, and David Swan as Lonigan the cop.
A production that you'll love in spite of your
self, My SisterEileen is ideal family entertainment
and will be performed again on August 4, 10, 19,
22, 23, 28 and 31.
