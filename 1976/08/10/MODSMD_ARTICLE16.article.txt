# 'Room Service'
## 
### 
Foothill College Summerepertory's recent pro
duction of Room Service doesn't warrant a tip.
Due to over-acting and a lack of enthusiasm, the
slapstick comedy falls flat, and although there is
quite a bit of falling over furniture and bodily
collisions in this play, this type of fall is not a part
of the script.
Written by John Murray and Allen Boretz, the
story centers on a nimble witted producer, living
on credit in a Broadway hotel with his actors,
desperately in need of a good script. He finds one,
begins the perennial search for a backer and fi
nally, despite insurmountable obstacles, pro
duces the show.
Director Doyne Mraz deserves credit for his
casting and well rehearsed timing that flows
slowly with controlled spontaneity.
The show's saving grace is that not all of the
characters are overdone. Gregory Wagner, the eas
ily excitable hotel manager steals the show, and is
forcefully and competently acted by David Swan,
while Gay Graves as Gribble suffers nobly under
his explosive verbiage.

The key roles that are overdone are James
Amato as the fast talking, scheming and broke
producer, Gordon Miller. His director, Harry Bin
ion (Robert Chase), whose prized possessions are
two stuffed owls he has hocked and a large
moosehead, is almost too much to swallow.
The third member of this unlikely trio is An
drew Y. Wood, who turns in a fine performance as
Faker England, renowned for his great ideas and
quick assertions that "I'll think of something
else."
David Woods almost brings conviction to the
role of the innocent playwright from. Oswego who
doesn't stay innocent for very long, and Gary
Kingston is superb as the meek, grey-haired agent
for the head honcho with the dough for backing
the show.
The rough and tumble staging is all kept to the
men, while two ladies are introduced to provide
some romantic flair: Christine Marlow (Helen
Wilson) for Miller and Hilda Manney (Linda Pic
cone) for Davis.
