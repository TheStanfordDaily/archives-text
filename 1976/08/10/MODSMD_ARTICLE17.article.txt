Harrises found guilty
LOS ANGELES —After nine days of de
liberation, a superior court jury yester
day handed down a guilty verdict on
kidnap and robbery charges against
former Symbionese Liberation Army
members William and Emily Harris.
The jury, however, acquitted the Har
rises on six counts of assault with a
deadly weapon in connection with a
shooting spree at a Southern California
sporting goods store.
The couple took the verdict with no
visible show of emotion. A few hours
before the verdict. Deputy Sheriff Dennis
Banowetz testified that during jury selec
tion a prospective member of the panel
wandered around an assembly room
with a small hangman's noose. The judge
in the case has agreed to question the
jurors about possible prejudice.
Ford prepares acceptance
WASHINGTON—President Gerald Ford
marked his second anniversary in the
White House yesterday by writing his
acceptance speech for the GOP nomina
tion he says he expects to win.
Aides for both Ford and Reagan were
working hard yesterday to prevent a fight
over the party's platform that could split
Republicans. But some hard-core Reagan
backers, led by North Carolina Senator
Jesse Helms, were still pushing some
conservative planks.
The party's rules committee over
whelmingly defeated a proposal by
Reagan's campaign manager that would
have required Ford to name his running
mate before anyone got the nomination.
Defense bill passed
WASHINGTON —The Pentagon got
what it wanted from the Senate yesterday
as the senators passed a $104 billion de
fense appropriations bill for fiscal 1977.

The bill contains almost everything the
Pentagon asked for, although the legis
lators sidestepped the controversial B-l
bomber issue for the present.
Congressional cuts in the administra
tion s request on the latest weapons
spending bill are the smallest in recent
history. Combined trimmings from the
billbytheHouseand Senate add uptos4
billion.
Questions on disease
HARRISBURG, Pa.—Dr. David Fraser
of the Federal Epidemic Investigation
Service said yesterday that 10,000 ques
tionnaires had been sent around the
country to American Legion posts in an
effort to pinpoint the cause of the mys
terious illness linked to the legion's con
vention last month.
So far all 27 deaths in the mysterious
outbreak of the disease have been linked
in some way with the legion convention,
fraser said the questionnaires center on
incidents in which the disease might
have spread. Doctors say they have con
firmed 155 cases of the illness.
Influenza has now been ruled out as a
cause of the deaths, but tests are still
being made to determine whether the
illness may be caused by a poison or a
freak virus.
Carter talks consumers
WASHINGTON—Jimmy Carter and
his running mate, Walter \londale. vis
ited Capitol Hill yesterday to talk with
Democratic congressional leaders. They

talked to the House Democratic cam
paign committee, and then conferred
with members of the Texas delegation.
Carter lunched with consumer advo
cate Ralph Nader and then challenged
President Ford's stand on consumer
legislation. Carter promised that if Ford
vetoed a bill aimed at creating a con
sumer protection agency, he would make
the bill into a major campaign issue.
Carter also said he believed there was
too much violence on TV. He also said he
was now against federally taxing or ban
ning non-returnable bottles and cans, but
said he might change his mind after he
explored the issue further.
He summed up his overall political
philosophy as "populism," adding, "I
would almost equate that with con
sumerism."
Kissinger in France
DEAUVILLE, France—Henry Kis
singer flew to a French resort town yes
terday for a two-day rest, but a senior
official in the secretary of state's party
said that Kissinger might interrupt his
visit in order to clarify his opposition to
proposed French sales of a nuclear plant
to Pakistan.
Kissinger had just returned from
Pakistan, where he threatened to cut off
U.S. aid if the Pakistanis buy the plant
without providing strong safeguards.
Kissinger reportedly thinks the French
haven't attached enough provisions to
the sale.
Kissinger will fly to Holland tomorrow
to meet with the Dutch foreign minister.

Viking I ready again
PASADENA—Viking I's robot arm is
repaired and ready to plow below the
Martian surface for another handful of
the red dust that continues to hint that it

delivering soil to one of Viking's minia
ture laboratories.

Ford prepares acceptance
WASHINGTON—President Gerald Ford
marked his second anniversary in the
White House yesterday by writing his
acceptance speech for the GOP nomina
tion he says he expects to win.
Aides for both Ford and Reagan were
working hard yesterday to prevent a fight
over the party's platform that could split
Republicans. But some hard-core Reagan
backers, led by North Carolina Senator
Jesse Helms, were still pushing some
conservative planks.
The party's rules committee over
whelmingly defeated a proposal by
Reagan's campaign manager that would
have required Ford to name his running
mate before anyone got the nomination.
Defense bill passed
WASHINGTON —The Pentagon got
what it wanted from the Senate yesterday
as the senators passed a $104 billion de
fense appropriations bill for fiscal 1977.

The bill contains almost everything the
Pentagon asked for, although the legis
lators sidestepped the controversial B-l
bomber issue for the present.
Congressional cuts in the administra
tion s request on the latest weapons
spending bill are the smallest in recent
history. Combined trimmings from the

Questions on disease
HARRISBURG, Pa.—Dr. David Fraser
of the Federal Epidemic Investigation
Service said yesterday that 10,000 ques
tionnaires had been sent around the
country to American Legion posts in an
effort to pinpoint the cause of the mys
terious illness linked to the legion's con
vention last month.
So far all 27 deaths in the mysterious
outbreak of the disease have been linked
in some way with the legion convention,
fraser said the questionnaires center on
incidents in which the disease might
have spread. Doctors say they have con
firmed 155 cases of the illness.
Influenza has now been ruled out as a
cause of the deaths, but tests are still
being made to determine whether the
illness may be caused by a poison or a
freak virus.
Carter talks consumers
WASHINGTON—Jimmy Carter and
his running mate, Walter \londale. vis

Democratic congressional leaders. They

talked to the House Democratic cam

with members of the Texas delegation.
Carter lunched with consumer advo
cate Ralph Nader and then challenged
President Ford's stand on consumer
legislation. Carter promised that if Ford
vetoed a bill aimed at creating a con
sumer protection agency, he would make
the bill into a major campaign issue.
Carter also said he believed there was
too much violence on TV. He also said he
was now against federally taxing or ban
ning non-returnable bottles and cans, but
said he might change his mind after he
explored the issue further.
He summed up his overall political
philosophy as "populism," adding, "I
would almost equate that with con
sumerism."
Kissinger in France
DEAUVILLE, France—Henry Kis

terday for a two-day rest, but a senior

said that Kissinger might interrupt his

proposed French sales of a nuclear plant
to Pakistan.
Kissinger had just returned from
Pakistan, where he threatened to cut off
U.S. aid if the Pakistanis buy the plant
without providing strong safeguards.
Kissinger reportedly thinks the French
haven't attached enough provisions to
the sale.
Kissinger will fly to Holland tomorrow

Harrises found guilty
LOS ANGELES —After nine days of de
liberation, a superior court jury yester
day handed down a guilty verdict on
kidnap and robbery charges against
former Symbionese Liberation Army
members William and Emily Harris.
The jury, however, acquitted the Har
rises on six counts of assault with a
deadly weapon in connection with a
shooting spree at a Southern California
sporting goods store.
The couple took the verdict with no
visible show of emotion. A few hours
before the verdict. Deputy Sheriff Dennis
Banowetz testified that during jury selec
tion a prospective member of the panel
wandered around an assembly room
with a small hangman's noose. The judge
in the case has agreed to question the
jurors about possible prejudice.
Ford prepares acceptance
WASHINGTON—President Gerald Ford
marked his second anniversary in the
White House yesterday by writing his
acceptance speech for the GOP nomina
tion he says he expects to win.
Aides for both Ford and Reagan were
working hard yesterday to prevent a fight
over the party's platform that could split
Republicans. But some hard-core Reagan
backers, led by North Carolina Senator
Jesse Helms, were still pushing some
conservative planks.
The party's rules committee over
whelmingly defeated a proposal by
Reagan's campaign manager that would
have required Ford to name his running
mate before anyone got the nomination.
Defense bill passed
WASHINGTON —The Pentagon got
what it wanted from the Senate yesterday
as the senators passed a $104 billion de
fense appropriations bill for fiscal 1977.

The bill contains almost everything the
Pentagon asked for, although the legis
lators sidestepped the controversial B-l
bomber issue for the present.
Congressional cuts in the administra
tion s request on the latest weapons
spending bill are the smallest in recent
history. Combined trimmings from the
billbytheHouseand Senate add uptos4
billion.
Questions on disease
HARRISBURG, Pa.—Dr. David Fraser
of the Federal Epidemic Investigation
Service said yesterday that 10,000 ques
tionnaires had been sent around the
country to American Legion posts in an
effort to pinpoint the cause of the mys
terious illness linked to the legion's con
vention last month.
So far all 27 deaths in the mysterious
outbreak of the disease have been linked
in some way with the legion convention,
fraser said the questionnaires center on
incidents in which the disease might
have spread. Doctors say they have con
firmed 155 cases of the illness.
Influenza has now been ruled out as a
cause of the deaths, but tests are still
being made to determine whether the
illness may be caused by a poison or a
freak virus.
Carter talks consumers
WASHINGTON—Jimmy Carter and
his running mate, Walter \londale. vis
ited Capitol Hill yesterday to talk with
Democratic congressional leaders. They

talked to the House Democratic cam
paign committee, and then conferred
with members of the Texas delegation.
Carter lunched with consumer advo
cate Ralph Nader and then challenged
President Ford's stand on consumer
legislation. Carter promised that if Ford
vetoed a bill aimed at creating a con
sumer protection agency, he would make
the bill into a major campaign issue.
Carter also said he believed there was
too much violence on TV. He also said he
was now against federally taxing or ban
ning non-returnable bottles and cans, but
said he might change his mind after he
explored the issue further.
He summed up his overall political
philosophy as "populism," adding, "I
would almost equate that with con
sumerism."
