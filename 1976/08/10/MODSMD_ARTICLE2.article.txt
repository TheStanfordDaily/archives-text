# Popular summer spot
## Students flock to de Guerre 
### Tyler Bridges 
The deGuerre pool complex, opened in 1973
and located near Maples Pavilion, has become a
popular recreational spot on campus.
The three pools offer a variety of choices to the
swimmer. The Olympic hopeful can swim lap
after lap to his or her heart's content in the
Olympic-sized 50-meter pool. The musclebound
jock can show off his physique while poised on
the high dive surveying the scene (For the junior
jock there is a lower board.)
For the middle aged, portly faculty or staff
member, the water polo pool offers a limited area
for a leisurely sidestroke.
For the 700-1000 persons who use the pools
daily, taking it easy from work or study, the at
mosphere is relaxed with infrequent hassles.
Students registered for summer quarter can
swim anytime the pool is open (12-6 every day) at
no cost. Regular students who are not registered
can buy a summer swim card for $10. Faculty and
staff members can buy individual cards for $10 or

spring for $30 and take along the whole family.
In theory, only persons with Stanford IDs or
summer swim cards can get in; no guests are al
lowed.
However, the lifeguard/checker is usually dis
tracted, and if you flashed a friend's card, the
guard probably wouldn't know it.
One student evades the no-guests rule by pas
sing his ID card through the fence to a waiting
friend who then easily gains admittance.
There are no plans to tighten security at the
pools, according to Jeff Hammett. assistant athle
tic director for swimming.
"I personally enjoy the relaxed atmosphere at
deGuerre," Hammett notes, but said the Univer
sity will not sell the cards to those outside the
University community.
"Although deGuerre pools lose money for the
University, they will never be opened to the pub
lic," he said; citing possible overcrowding as one
reason, and a possible loss of University tax
exempt status as another.
