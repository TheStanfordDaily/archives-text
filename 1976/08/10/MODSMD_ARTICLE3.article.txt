# Lyman upholds band decision
## 
### Dave Ansley 
President Richard Lyman has
approved the recommendation
of the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC) in the case of the band's
performance in Meyer Library.
The SJC's recommendation
was that two members of the Le
land Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (LSJUMB) be
placed on probation for one
quarter as punishment for the
May 24 performance, according
to LSJUMB manager Kent Blum
berg. one of the defendants.
William Stone, assistant to the
president, said that Lyman will
send his decision to Prof.
Jonathan Casper, faculty co
chairman of the SJC. this morn
ing.
Blumberg and drum major Jim
Jett were cJiarged with violating
the Campus Disruption Policy.
Fifty members of the LSJUMB
and the Dollies entered the lib
rary shortly before 10 p.m..
gathered on the second, third
and fourth floors, and played
two songs.
Both Jett and Blumberg have
said that the University's reac
tion to the disturbance came as a
surprise.
"(Meyer Library) is a place we
like to play in because we get an
enthusiastic response. We didn't
expect any trouble," Jett said.
He said that the band had
played in Meyer before without
repercussions. But Blumberg,
when informed last night of Ly
man's decision, said. "As long as

I'm around anyway, the band
won't go to the library again."
Blumberg said that the case
"worked out as fairly as the
whole situation could have
worked out." Jett could not be
reached for comment, but Blum
berg said that he doubted the
pair would try to challenge the
ruling. "I think Jimand lareboth
going to let it slide." he said.
lames Siena, legal advisor to
the president, who served as the
prosecutor in the case, has said
that the decision to punish the
students was based on the lib
rary's new hard-line policy on
disruptions.
After hearing the case, the SJC
sent its recommendation to
Lyman about a month ago, said
Casper.
Stone said that Lyman made
his decision "at least a week
ago."
Three factors helped create the
announcement delay, said an
administration source. Lyman
has been out of town often this
summer, he spent a great deal of
time working on the Delt deci
sion and he was unable to find a
library committee report he
wished to quote in this decision,
the source said.
According to Stone. Lyman
decided late yesterday afternoon
that there was no point in delay
ing the announcement any
further. "Normally there'sa little
quicker turn-around," Stone
said. "The defendants have the
right to an apology."

Fifty members of the LSJUMB
and the Dollies entered the lib
rary shortly before 10 p.m..
gathered on the second, third
and fourth floors, and played
two songs.
Both Jett and Blumberg have
said that the University's reac
tion to the disturbance came as a
surprise.
"(Meyer Library) is a place we
like to play in because we get an
enthusiastic response. We didn't
expect any trouble," Jett said.
He said that the band had
played in Meyer before without
repercussions. But Blumberg,
when informed last night of Ly
man's decision, said. "As long as

I'm around anyway, the band
won't go to the library again."
Blumberg said that the case
"worked out as fairly as the
whole situation could have
worked out." Jett could not be
reached for comment, but Blum
berg said that he doubted the
pair would try to challenge the
ruling. "I think Jimand lareboth
going to let it slide." he said.
lames Siena, legal advisor to
the president, who served as the
prosecutor in the case, has said
that the decision to punish the
students was based on the lib
rary's new hard-line policy on
disruptions.
After hearing the case, the SJC
sent its recommendation to
Lyman about a month ago, said
Casper.
Stone said that Lyman made
his decision "at least a week
ago."
Three factors helped create the
announcement delay, said an
administration source. Lyman
has been out of town often this
summer, he spent a great deal of
time working on the Delt deci
sion and he was unable to find a
library committee report he
wished to quote in this decision,
the source said.
According to Stone. Lyman
decided late yesterday afternoon
that there was no point in delay
ing the announcement any
further. "Normally there'sa little
quicker turn-around," Stone
said. "The defendants have the
right to an apology."
