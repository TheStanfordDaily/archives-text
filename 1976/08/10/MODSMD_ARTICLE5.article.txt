Driving across that godawful
Dumbarton Bridge a few days
ago I was struck by something I
hadn't realized before. I've dri
ven over the watery wastelands
preceding Newark thousands of
times, and wondered every time
what the hell I was driving over,
the bay or someone's idea of
Okefenokee Swamp.
But the last time 1 finally fi
gured out what the hell was
going on, and it's made me none
too happy.
Local government is I think
instituting a program to fill in

the bay and build another one of
those tacky Santa Clara amuse
ment parks.
"Hah!" you say. Who is this
guy, anyway?
Well, at least I'm not someone
else, and unless something is
done about the filling in of the
Bay a lot of people with sailboats
are going to be awfully sur
prised.
The Bay provides this area
with a variety of valuable things.
It keeps us cool in the summer,
with breezes blowing across it. It
separates Oakland and San

Francisco. There are some fish in
it. Birds live around it, and enjoy
its presence.
But mostly, it prevents this
area from becoming another Los
Angeles, and we're all grateful
for that.
I think what's being done — to
fill in the bay I mean — is simply
atrocious. They've filled in a
third of the bay already, and now
they seem to be trying to extend
Newark to San Mateo. Which
means the Dumbarton Bridge
would have to be changed to the
Dumbarton Byway, and then
somebody would really have to
do something about it. And no
one could sail to San Jose.
Regardless of the profit local

government expects to net from
another gargantuan amusement
park, there's really no reason to
go on filling in one of the Bay
Areas oldest institutions. It will
get filled in soon enough if the
kids around here keep throwing
their old bottles and cars in it. It's
high time we put our foot down
and let our local government
know that we're not going to just
lie around and watch them
change the face of the earth.
What I want to know, is who is
at the bottom of all this. Maybe
we could take him out and fill
him in.

we could take him out and fill
