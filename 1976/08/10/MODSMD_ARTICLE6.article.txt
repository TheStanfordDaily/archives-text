## Chowchilla lesson Melanie Harris 
### 
The Chowchilla kidnaping
has raised the consciousness of
the American people a great
deal. People have concerned
themselves with the ever
creeping anarchistic elements of
society, among other things.
Something that particularly
interests me is the character of
Ed Ray, the bus driver whose
miraculous deeds in the face of
imminent disaster saved an en
tire busload of children.

What if Ed Ray had been a
woman?
Would she have been able to
overcome the fear, find the re
solve and deliver the ingenuity
that Ed Ray did? Many busdriv
ers are women, and it is well
worth considering whether or
not a woman would have been fit
in a situation such as Chowchil
la's.
This is only one of a number of
questions which deserve the im
mediate attention of the Ameri
can public.
Another pressing question is
that of armed bus drivers. Is it
necessary to protect our school
children by arming schoolbus
drivers? Who can we trust to de
liver our children from harm?
It would behoove us to study
these and other related problems
seriously. Though I do not wish
to play the role of the doomsday
forecaster, I fear the Chowchilla
kidnaping will not be unique in
the annals of twentieth century
crime.
I have wrestled with these
questions for some time, and am
unable to offer any conclusive
solutions. I would like to hear
the opinions of others on this
subject.
Can we really afford to learn
by our mistakes when the price
we will pay is the lives of inno
cent children?
