Anne Tyrell (Daily, Aug. 6)
seems puzzled by the fact that
excavation is needed for new
buildings on campus. Unfor
tunately no one has, as yet, disco
vered a way of constructing
basements or installing sewers
and water lines without the
needed excavation.
Robert Moses, when he was
criticized for building parkways,
recreational areas and public
beaches in New York, once said.

"You can't make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs."

I've been reading OATQ all
summer, and keep seeing all
this limmv Olsen and Lois
Lane Fan Club stuff. I happen to
know that these people never
meet where they say they're

going to meet, because I've tried
to meet them there and they're
never there. What's going on? Is
somebody making these things
up? I think you have a respon
sibility to find out.

always accepted as ingenuous
