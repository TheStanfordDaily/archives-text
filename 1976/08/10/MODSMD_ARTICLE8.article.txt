# Bicycle bridge planned for creek
## 
### 
Stanford students will be
treated to a long-awaited sur
prise soon when a new
pedestrian-bicycle bridge is
built over the San Francisquito
Creek. That means that bike
rides from campus to the Oasis
will be made without having to
deal with the hazard of El
Camino Real traffic.
The new span, to cost $90,000,
will be paid for by Menlo Park.
Stanford will lay a pathway to
its eastern terminus of the creek
opposite San Mateo Drive. The
pathway will link the bridge to
Willow Road, where it will con
nect with other bikeways.
Laminated wood
The bridge will be 120 feet
long, eight feet wide and con
structed of prestressed lami
nated wood beams. If all goes as
scheduled, students will be rid
ing to a pitcher of Michelob by
next January.

Residents of San Mateo
Street protested the proposal
when it came before the Menlo
Park City Council last April.
Clarence Genasci, whose home
is 100 feet from the bridge, told
the Daily last April "this thing
has been crammed down our
throats."
Local residents, totalling 115,
also presented a petition to have
the project stopped.
But they appear resigned to
the bridge now. "I've been pes
tered about that (bridge) long
enough," Genasci said last
night.
Menlo Park Bikeways Club
Chairman Janiee La Fetra said.
"It's sort of a dead point now.
There's been very little interest.
Once it went through everyone
has been very quiet.' 1
