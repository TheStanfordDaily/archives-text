# University hires potential scabs?

The Stores Department used
methods of questionable legality
to hire students who will cross
picket lines if the United Stan
ford Employees (USE) decide to
strike.
Edward Corder, head
storekeeper of the warehouse,
routinely asked students who
applied for part-time jobs as
storekeepers whether they
would work if USE went on
strike.
"It is illegal to reject an
applicant because he refuses to
give a commitment not to
strike," said William Gould, pro
fessor of law.
Herman Holtslander, manager
of Stores, defended Corder's
questioning of students. "It's a
freedom of choice question," he
said.
"If I were an interviewer, I
might probably ask that question
myself."
The jobs will only last until
school starts, Holtslander said.

"I have to get personnel and if
they're only going to work a few
weeks, I can't afford to train
them."
Corder said he did not refuse
to hire any students who said
they would honor a strike. He
explained that some students
said they were no longer in
terested in the job after they were
asked what they would do if a
strike occurred.
Jim Green, one student inter
viewed for the job, said that after
he told Corder he would not
work during a strike, he had the
impression he had given the
wrong answer. Green said he de
cided he didn't want the job be
cause of that, and asked Corder if
he was hiring people specifi
cally because of the possibility of
a strike.
Corder, according to Green,
said yes. "You mean strike
breakers?" Green asked. "Corder
said yes. Then he told me if I ever
changed my mind about work
ing in a strike to call him back."
Cara McCarty, another job
applicant, also decided she
didn't want the job after she was
asked if she would honor a
strike. "The question took me by
surprise," she said. "It was
strange for somebody to ask me
that at the beginning of an inter
view."
McCarty felt the Stores De
partment was "unusually con
cerned" about whether she was
on financial aid. "I think they
wanted somebody on financial
aid because those people need

"No other job application in

Allen Cummings. Manager of
Logistics and supervisor of
Holtslander's department, said.
"It was not our intention that

get the job. It confounds me that
this is how it was interpreted."
Cummings said the depart

started as possible."
Cummings said that planning
for a possible strike has been
going on for the last two weeks.
"Contingency planning is a
necessary prerequisite." he said.
The Stores Department is de
veloping contingency plans to
continue providing materials
with first priority to hospitals,
then other medical school de
partments and then to the gen
eral campus. Orders for supplies
have already increased greatly

and the department has hired
several students to help with the
work increase.
"We can never be totally pre
pared for a strike because the
warehouse is too small to hold a
large surplus of supplies,"
Holtslander said.
Unlike the Stores Department,
the University Food Service has
made few preparations for the
possible strike. "We would basi
cally follow the same policies
that were in effect during the
strike in 1974," said Maxine An
derson. Manager of University
Food Services.

In 1974, all students on board
plans were given the option of
discontinuing the plan. Hashers
who honored the strike were not
penalized.
"We seemed to get by in 1974
with a minimum of fuss," An
derson said.
The managerial staff kept
three dining halls operating,
working from 4:30 a.m. to 10
p.m. All meals were served, al
though the menus contained
fewer choices.

partment was "unusually con
cerned" about whether she was
on financial aid. "I think they
wanted somebody on financial
aid because those people need
the money and wouldn't quit if a
strike occurs." she said.
"No other job application in
the Financial Aids Office lists
under qualifications that stu
dents needing financial aid are
preferred."
Allen Cummings. Manager of
Logistics and supervisor of
Holtslander's department, said.
"It was not our intention that
people commit themselves to
work during a strike in order to
get the job. It confounds me that
this is how it was interpreted."
Cummings said the depart

ment's "primary purpose was to
get students who would work
until as close to the time school
started as possible."
Cummings said that planning
for a possible strike has been
going on for the last two weeks.
"Contingency planning is a
necessary prerequisite." he said.
The Stores Department is de
veloping contingency plans to
continue providing materials
with first priority to hospitals,
then other medical school de
partments and then to the gen
eral campus. Orders for supplies
have already increased greatly

and the department has hired
several students to help with the
work increase.
"We can never be totally pre
pared for a strike because the
warehouse is too small to hold a
large surplus of supplies,"
Holtslander said.
Unlike the Stores Department,
the University Food Service has
made few preparations for the
possible strike. "We would basi
cally follow the same policies
that were in effect during the
strike in 1974," said Maxine An
derson. Manager of University
Food Services.

In 1974, all students on board
plans were given the option of
discontinuing the plan. Hashers
who honored the strike were not
penalized.
"We seemed to get by in 1974
with a minimum of fuss," An
derson said.
The managerial staff kept
three dining halls operating,
working from 4:30 a.m. to 10
p.m. All meals were served, al
though the menus contained
fewer choices.
Like the Food Service, if a
strike occurs. Plant Services will
basically follow the same con

tingency plan that was in effect
in 1974.
"The core of emergency set up
was the operations center.
Supervisors worked 12-hour
shifts to keep Plant Services
running.
Asked what he learned from
the 1974 strike, Mavis said, "We
learned to keep a lot more spare
tires on hand." During the strike
the tires on many of the service
trucks were slashed.
Negotiations with the Univer
sity over a new contract are con
tinuing. The present contract
expires Aug. 31.
The Stores Department used
methods of questionable legality
to hire students who will cross
picket lines if the United Stan
ford Employees (USE) decide to
strike.
Edward Corder, head
storekeeper of the warehouse,
routinely asked students who
applied for part-time jobs as
storekeepers whether they
would work if USE went on
strike.
"It is illegal to reject an
applicant because he refuses to
give a commitment not to
strike," said William Gould, pro
fessor of law.
Herman Holtslander, manager
of Stores, defended Corder's
questioning of students. "It's a
freedom of choice question," he
said.
"If I were an interviewer, I
might probably ask that question
myself."
The jobs will only last until
school starts, Holtslander said.

"I have to get personnel and if
they're only going to work a few
weeks, I can't afford to train
them."
Corder said he did not refuse
to hire any students who said
they would honor a strike. He
explained that some students
said they were no longer in
terested in the job after they were
asked what they would do if a
strike occurred.
Jim Green, one student inter
viewed for the job, said that after
he told Corder he would not
work during a strike, he had the
impression he had given the
wrong answer. Green said he de
cided he didn't want the job be
cause of that, and asked Corder if
he was hiring people specifi
cally because of the possibility of
a strike.
Corder, according to Green,
said yes. "You mean strike
breakers?" Green asked. "Corder
said yes. Then he told me if I ever
changed my mind about work
ing in a strike to call him back."
Cara McCarty, another job
applicant, also decided she
didn't want the job after she was
asked if she would honor a
strike. "The question took me by
surprise," she said. "It was
strange for somebody to ask me
that at the beginning of an inter
view."
McCarty felt the Stores De
partment was "unusually con
