# University hires potential scabs?

The Stores Department used
methods of questionable legality
to hire students who will cross
picket lines if the United Stan
ford Employees (USE) decide to
strike.
Edward Corder, head
storekeeper of the warehouse,
routinely asked students who
applied for part-time jobs as
storekeepers whether they
would work if USE went on
strike.
"It is illegal to reject an
applicant because he refuses to
give a commitment not to
strike," said William Gould, pro
fessor of law.
Herman Holtslander, manager
of Stores, defended Corder's
questioning of students. "It's a
freedom of choice question," he
said.
"If I were an interviewer, I
might probably ask that question
myself."
The jobs will only last until
school starts, Holtslander said.

"I have to get personnel and if
they're only going to work a few
weeks, I can't afford to train
them."
Corder said he did not refuse
to hire any students who said
they would honor a strike. He
explained that some students
said they were no longer in
terested in the job after they were
asked what they would do if a
strike occurred.
Jim Green, one student inter
viewed for the job, said that after
he told Corder he would not
work during a strike, he had the
impression he had given the
wrong answer. Green said he de
cided he didn't want the job be
cause of that, and asked Corder if
he was hiring people specifi
cally because of the possibility of
a strike.
Corder, according to Green,
said yes. "You mean strike
breakers?" Green asked. "Corder
said yes. Then he told me if I ever
changed my mind about work
ing in a strike to call him back."
Cara McCarty, another job
applicant, also decided she
didn't want the job after she was
asked if she would honor a
strike. "The question took me by
surprise," she said. "It was
strange for somebody to ask me
that at the beginning of an inter
view."
McCarty felt the Stores De
partment was "unusually con
cerned" about whether she was
on financial aid. "I think they
wanted somebody on financial
aid because those people need
