# ASSU: not just stuffed shirts
## 
### 
T-shirts have become a war
drobe necessity for American
men and women. In keeping
with this trend, the ASSU will be
opening a T-shirt service for the
Stanford community this fall.
Susan Graham, a senior in
economics, will be managing the
service. She said the T-shirt ser
vice will be providing students
with heat transfers and silk
screen designs on T-shirts of any
size, color or style.
An added feature of the ser
vice will be original artists' de
signs. They will also accept any
design offered to them, or trans
fer special words on individual
requests, such as a name.
The service is not yet prepared
to quote an exact price, but
Graham said that its prices will
be competitive with other
T-shirt stores. The price of
T-shirts will probably be calcu
lated on an individual job basis.
Graham said the service will
be publicizing its products this
fall, talking to dorm staff people
and contacting as many people
as possible to tell them about the
service.
