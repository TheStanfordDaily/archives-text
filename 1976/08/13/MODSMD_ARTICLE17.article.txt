# Sunny vibes at Frost
## Crosby and Nash offer mellow melodies 
### Linda Buddenberg 
"You'll have to forgive us for being
loose, but we're feeling awfully fucking
good today "
The crowd at Frost on Saturday didn t
seem to mind the "looseness" at all. The
lack of theatrics, the tuning time-outs
and the lack of planning ("We have to
play something. They'll think we don t
know how.") all became irrelevant as the
performers seemingly wanted to merely
share their music, instead ot trying to
prove how good they were.
Of course, when you're David Crosby
and Graham Nash, you (lon t exactly
have to prove how good you are. Every
song they played, mostly older songs
with only a few cuts oft of Whistling
Down the Wire, their latest album, was
met with whoops of approval from the
crowd.

Crosby and Nash came across, though,
not only as fine musicians, but as pretty
fine people. Their continuous conversa
tions with the audience were almost as
entertaining as their music. From their
initial greeting — "You're a pretty heal
thy looking crowd for a bunch of cell
damage cases'' — the pair kept the crow d
smiling.
Interspersed with "Fee Shore, a
well-received and well-performed "Im
migration Man," "Southbound Train "
and "Take the Money and Run." Crosby
poked fun at the scores of photographers
at his feet. "I know photographers are mv
enemies." he commented. "1 bend over
and pick my nose, and fifty cameras go
off. When I'm sittin* here, looking noble,
no one takes my picture."
Between other old C&N favorites and a
spirited new instrumental called

"Dancer," Crosby compared his own
stocky silhouette with Nash's slight
frame, bringing cries of "Let's hear it for
beer bellies!" from the crowd.
"I hate the thin people of the world,"
said Crosby. "I walk by an ice cream store
and pick up three pounds."
"Yeah," returned Nash. "Three
pounds to take home and eat later."
The crowd also roared approval for
C&N's backup string man. David Lynley.
After telling the sound men to turn up
the volume "until it's painful." he had
the entire Frost crowd stamping and
clapping to a lively solo played on his
colorful violin.
Nash opened the half alone, playing
from his "Songs for Beginners" album.
Crosby then joined him for a showstop
per, as the two invited the audience to
join them in singing "Our House.'' After

eliminating the accompaniment, they
excitedly asked the audience, "Do you
hear that? It's YOU!!! The fact that Nash
blew the piano ending to the song did
nothing to diminish the crowd's en
thusiasm.
Crosby also flirted with the women in
the audience, hinting that "the more
shirts come off, the better I sing."
"Well, in that case ..." answered
Nash and obliged by taking his shirt off.
The show's finale — "Military Mad
ness" and "Deja \ u had the entire
crowd on its feet, anil Crosby and Nash
weren't allowed to leave until after play
ing two encores.
Not that the stars seemed to mind,
though. As he waved goodbye, Nash
hardly had to tell the audience, "I've
gotta confess: we love it. too."

Crosby then joined him for a showstop
per, as the two invited the audience to
join them in singing "Our House.'' After

eliminating the accompaniment, they
excitedly asked the audience, "Do you
hear that? It's YOU!!! The fact that Nash
blew the piano ending to the song did
nothing to diminish the crowd's en
thusiasm.
Crosby also flirted with the women in
the audience, hinting that "the more
shirts come off, the better I sing."
"Well, in that case ..." answered
Nash and obliged by taking his shirt off.
The show's finale — "Military Mad
ness" and "Deja \ u had the entire
crowd on its feet, anil Crosby and Nash
weren't allowed to leave until after play
ing two encores.
Not that the stars seemed to mind,
though. As he waved goodbye, Nash
hardly had to tell the audience, "I've
gotta confess: we love it. too."
"You'll have to forgive us for being
loose, but we're feeling awfully fucking
good today "
The crowd at Frost on Saturday didn t
seem to mind the "looseness" at all. The
lack of theatrics, the tuning time-outs
and the lack of planning ("We have to
play something. They'll think we don t
know how.") all became irrelevant as the
performers seemingly wanted to merely
share their music, instead ot trying to
prove how good they were.
Of course, when you're David Crosby
and Graham Nash, you (lon t exactly
have to prove how good you are. Every
song they played, mostly older songs
with only a few cuts oft of Whistling
Down the Wire, their latest album, was
met with whoops of approval from the
crowd.

Crosby and Nash came across, though,
not only as fine musicians, but as pretty
fine people. Their continuous conversa
tions with the audience were almost as
entertaining as their music. From their
initial greeting — "You're a pretty heal
thy looking crowd for a bunch of cell
damage cases'' — the pair kept the crow d
smiling.
Interspersed with "Fee Shore, a
well-received and well-performed "Im
migration Man," "Southbound Train "
and "Take the Money and Run." Crosby
poked fun at the scores of photographers
at his feet. "I know photographers are mv
enemies." he commented. "1 bend over
and pick my nose, and fifty cameras go
off. When I'm sittin* here, looking noble,
no one takes my picture."
Between other old C&N favorites and a
spirited new instrumental called

"Dancer," Crosby compared his own
stocky silhouette with Nash's slight
frame, bringing cries of "Let's hear it for
beer bellies!" from the crowd.
"I hate the thin people of the world,"
said Crosby. "I walk by an ice cream store
and pick up three pounds."
"Yeah," returned Nash. "Three
pounds to take home and eat later."
The crowd also roared approval for
C&N's backup string man. David Lynley.
After telling the sound men to turn up
the volume "until it's painful." he had
the entire Frost crowd stamping and
clapping to a lively solo played on his
colorful violin.
Nash opened the half alone, playing
from his "Songs for Beginners" album.
