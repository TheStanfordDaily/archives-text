# BRT's 'Earnest' lively and skillful

### Sue Simmons 
Oscar Wilde's The Importance
of Being Earnest — a "Trivial
Comedy for Serious People" —
proves the frivolity of that pre
scription in its present produc
tion by the Berkeley Repertory
Theatre.
Outside of Wilde's words,
what has insured the success of
this production? Turn of the cen
tury trimmings in set, costume
and even brilliantine may lure
audiences back to that age of
convention Wilde rebuffs, but
postures or stances of the period
positively transport us to the
London flat, garden and draw
ingroom from which each of the
three acts takes off.
Wilde's spoof on this "age of
surfaces" spends most of its sa
tire on Algernon Moncrieff and
Jack Worthing, played respec
tively by Douglass Johnson and
Joe Spano. Cunning Algy and
doltish Jack woo their
sweethearts, Cecily (Anne Swift)

and Gwendolyn (L.L. Johnson)
under the sobriquet of "Ear
nest," a name which conjures up
all the "principle and profile" a
girl could want.
Anne Swift and L.L. Johnson
portrayed their impressionable
heroines with ease, each glory
ing in fin-de-siecie girlishness.
Douglass Johnson betrayed
however, the most intense sym
pathy with that age, brimming
with belligerent nonsense.
Straight-man, Joe Spano, added
just enough starch to keep BRT's
uncontained audience from col
lapsing.
The balance of blatant and
piquant, Wildean humor is pre
sent throughout the play, sup
ported by Karen Ingenthron as
Lady Bracknell and unnamed
performances in the roles of Re
verend Chasuble and Miss
Prism.
The Importance of Being Ear
nest runs Monday through
Saturday, closing Aug. 29.
