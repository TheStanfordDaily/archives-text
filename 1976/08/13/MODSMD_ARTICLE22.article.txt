# A 						film identity crisis
## 'Bingo Long': what is it? 
### Howard Baldwin 
The Bingo Long Traveling
All-Stars And Motor Kings is a
trailblazing movie no matter
which way you look at it. For one
thing, it's got a title longer than
the Democratic National Con
vention. For another, the title
doesn't exactly clue us in on
exactly which sport, if any, the
movie's about. Racing? Hockey?
Bingo?
Also, it's plainly impossibly to
discern exactly which of the ti
tle's words are adjectives and
which are verbs, a situation
which could provide some un
usual interpretations. As for the
movie, it's the first to success
fully ridicule every minority
group, except for Eskimos, in
cluding Blacks. Cubans.
Swedes. Indians and southerners
It's the first movie about black
baseball teams before anyone
broke the color line in major
league baseball. It's the first
movie to insinuate that the Har
lem Globetrotters devil-may
care style of sportsmanship ac
tually originated on a baseball
diamond.
Billy Dee Williams plays
Bingo Long, a member of the
Ebony Aces baseball team, who
forms his own baseball team to
avoid the inhumane treatment
the black owners inflict upon the
players. Incensed at Long for
stealing their stars, the owners
band together to hinder the All-
Stars with Mafia tactics. And
this is the story of Bingo Long
etc.
In chronicling the rise and fall
of the team, the story is true-to-,
life, mixing bitter tragedy with
joyous victory.
Unfortunately, the situation
gets far too bleak as the team re

gresses into cheating, grand lar
ceny and potato picking in order
to survive. The movie makes the
same mistake that The Sugar
land Express did — it's too sad to
be a comedy and too funny to be
a drama. leaving it in a nebulous
void. Coincidentally, Hal Bar
wood and Matthew Robbins
wrote both movies.
The film is full of scenes that
just ache to be laughed at. but
alas are too far-fetched or embar
rassing. A scene in which Bingo
steals a Packard when he's actu
ally trying to steal back his own
car comes off as ridiculous
mostly because there has been
no indication that Bingo has the
makings of a thief prior to the
scene.
But as I said, it is true-to-life.
The barnstorming players came
into towns only to face racism,
poverty and apathy. Forced to
discover their own method of en

tertainment that strayed some
what from the traditional rules of
baseball, they were still oppres
sed by the wily agents ol the
angry black owners. Highlights
of comedy are interspersed
among the occasional violence,
but the latter still mars the over
all production.
The trend this summer, what
with Murder By Death. Silent
Movie, Harry And Walter Go To
New York, The Big Bus and
Bingo Long is obviously toward
comedy. It has something to do
with an economic downturn,
whatever that is, because people
tend to want more escapism in
times of financial distress. For
tunately, we've already weath
ered the disaster movie syn
drome. Now all we have to do is
weather all these well
intentioned "comedies" that
only help the economic distress
of the studios without giving any
enjoyment in return.

HERE THEY COME, READY OR NOT—The happy, high-stepping,
smiling players belie their financial problems, as the Traveling
All-Stars and Motor Kings enter town for another game not always
played by the strictest rules.
The Bingo Long Traveling
All-Stars And Motor Kings is a
trailblazing movie no matter
which way you look at it. For one
thing, it's got a title longer than
the Democratic National Con
vention. For another, the title
doesn't exactly clue us in on
exactly which sport, if any, the
movie's about. Racing? Hockey?
Bingo?
Also, it's plainly impossibly to
discern exactly which of the ti
tle's words are adjectives and
which are verbs, a situation
which could provide some un
usual interpretations. As for the
movie, it's the first to success
fully ridicule every minority
group, except for Eskimos, in
cluding Blacks. Cubans.
Swedes. Indians and southerners
It's the first movie about black
baseball teams before anyone
broke the color line in major
league baseball. It's the first
movie to insinuate that the Har
lem Globetrotters devil-may
care style of sportsmanship ac
tually originated on a baseball
diamond.
Billy Dee Williams plays
Bingo Long, a member of the
Ebony Aces baseball team, who
forms his own baseball team to
avoid the inhumane treatment
the black owners inflict upon the
players. Incensed at Long for
stealing their stars, the owners
band together to hinder the All-
Stars with Mafia tactics. And
this is the story of Bingo Long
etc.
In chronicling the rise and fall
of the team, the story is true-to-,
life, mixing bitter tragedy with
joyous victory.
Unfortunately, the situation
gets far too bleak as the team re

gresses into cheating, grand lar
ceny and potato picking in order
to survive. The movie makes the
same mistake that The Sugar
land Express did — it's too sad to
be a comedy and too funny to be
a drama. leaving it in a nebulous
void. Coincidentally, Hal Bar
wood and Matthew Robbins
wrote both movies.
The film is full of scenes that
just ache to be laughed at. but
alas are too far-fetched or embar
rassing. A scene in which Bingo
steals a Packard when he's actu
ally trying to steal back his own
car comes off as ridiculous
mostly because there has been
no indication that Bingo has the
makings of a thief prior to the
scene.
But as I said, it is true-to-life.
The barnstorming players came
into towns only to face racism,
poverty and apathy. Forced to
discover their own method of en

tertainment that strayed some
what from the traditional rules of
baseball, they were still oppres
sed by the wily agents ol the
angry black owners. Highlights
of comedy are interspersed
among the occasional violence,
but the latter still mars the over
all production.
The trend this summer, what
with Murder By Death. Silent
Movie, Harry And Walter Go To
New York, The Big Bus and
Bingo Long is obviously toward
comedy. It has something to do
with an economic downturn,
whatever that is, because people
tend to want more escapism in
times of financial distress. For
tunately, we've already weath
ered the disaster movie syn
drome. Now all we have to do is
weather all these well
intentioned "comedies" that
only help the economic distress
of the studios without giving any
