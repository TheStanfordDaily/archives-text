Republican platform finished

conferences yesterday, top strategists for
President Gerald Ford and Ronald
Reagan expressed satisfaction with the
drafting of the 1976 Republican party
platform.

paign manager, nor Dean Burch. a
spokesman for Ford, would rule out the
possibility of floor fights or endorse the
platform's final draft, which will be is
sued today.
Meanwhile, hard-line Reagan conser
vatives were working independently of
their candidate yesterday. They said they
would carry their fights to the conven
tion floor on the issues of the Panama
Canal. Taiwan, detente and a mandatory
balanced budget.
Ford claimed to have the support of the
majority of the Mississippi delegation,
and was preparing to crack a delegation
rule that requires all delegates from the
state to vote as a bloc. According to re
cent polls. Ford would have more than
enough delegates to win a first-ballot
nomination if he succeeded in erasing
the Mississippi rule.
White House News Secretary Ron Nes
sen said the president would assume
"personal direction" of the nomination
when, breaking tradition, he arrived at
the convention early Sunday.

Bush and Brown. Brown said he told Car

strength in the state had been "over
emphasized."

Catholic publication. Carter reiterated

that he opposed a constitutional
amendment banning abortion. But Carter
said the government should do nothing

ease, which appears to have affected only
those who attended an American Legion
convention recently held in Philadel
phia.
