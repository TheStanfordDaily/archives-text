# Cards: Pac-8 underdogs
## 
### Chris Baker 
The 1976 football season
may be Stanford's best shot at
the Rose Bowl until President
Carter decides to run for
re-election.
Card football coach Jack
Christiansen, who will wel
come back 80 gridders for
early practice a week from
tomorrow, gave the press a
season preview at the annual
Stanford football press clinic
Wednesday.
But those who were hoping
that Chris would use the oc
casion to name a starting
quarterback were disap
pointed. ."We still have the
same two people," said Chris-

tiansen. "The situation hasn't
changed a lot from last fall.
"Benjamin improved a lot
this spring in handoffs,
handling the team and matur
ity. Cordova improved his
passing," he added.
Christiansen went to the
history books to give some
examples of successful teams
with two quarterbacks. But he
promised to name a starter on
Sept. 1, 10 days before the
season opener at Penn State.
The Cards face the same'
brutal pre-seasont
schedule that they faced last
year — back-to-back road
games with nationally
ranked powers Penn State

and Michigan.
Christiansen agreed with
the pre-season polls which
pick USC to win its fourth
Pacific-8 title in five years.
"We usually rely on the pro
scouts who go through there
during spring practice, and
they say that they've never
seen a team as good as USC."
The Trojans, fifth in the
conference last year, had only
one offensive weapon —
Heisman Tj-ophy winner elect
— Ricky Bell. But Christian
sen said USC quarterback
Vince Evans, who completed
a sickly .293 of his passes last
year, has improved.
