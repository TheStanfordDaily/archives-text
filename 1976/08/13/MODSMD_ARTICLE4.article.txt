# Campus parking rules revised
## 
### Pan Demetrakakes 
Students returning here this fall Will face
a series of changes in on-campus parking
regulations, including reorganization of the
zone system. .
Instead of being organized into concen
tric zones, parking lots will be individually
classified according to the convenience of
their location, according to Director of
Police Services Marvin Herrington.
"A" lots, the most convenient ones, will

be available to faculty and staff merhbers
only, for a charge of $60 a year, Herrington
said; "B" lots, in less desirable locations,
will be open to non-resident students for
$40 a year and "C" lots will be free.
Also, car owners will have to pay to use
three formerly free lots: the half of the Tre
sidder parking lot near Dinkelspiel, the lot
on Serra St. near the Chemistry building
and the lot on Memorial Way.
Herrington said that those three lots were
intended as visitor parking, but because so
many residents used them, "the visitors
never got a chance at it."
Furthermore, most time-zone parking
will be cut down to 40 minutes.
"It was brought up that this way, students
wouldn't be tempted to drive in for a 50-
minute class," Herrington said.
"One of the things we're trying to keep
down is resident students' use of cars, be

cause it's a lot 6f traffic we don't need," he
said. "The idea behind the time-zone park
ing is to allow visitors and anyone else who
had reason to be in the area to park there, but
they stayed all day. We give citations, but
that doesn't move the car."
The University will compensate for the
loss of parking lots to construction sites by
making greater use of previously neglected
lots, according to Master Planner Oscar Nel
son, Jr.
Nelson said that parking displaced by the
Terman construction site can be accomo
dated by Parking Lot B, near the Roble Ten
nis Courts, which is usually only half-full.
Cars turned away by the construction
around the Main Library can park in Lot H,
near the Encina Gym. Nelson said.
"Numerically, it works out fine, even
though it probably won't be quite as conve
nient," he said.
