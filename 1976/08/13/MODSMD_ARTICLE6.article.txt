Stanford myth
I am a 21-year-old graduate of Stanford Univer
sity. 1 have been supporting myself this summer
through odd jobs. I am intelligent, have a number
of what should be marketable skills and am rather
clever.
I've sent over 90 resumes to prospective
employers, and the best luck I've had is someone
saying. "We'll keep your application on file.
Is a Stanford degree the means to becoming a
social pariah? It seems to,be. because rather than
taking the world by surprise like I'd been told I
would, the world is taking me by surprise.
Why?

Stanford manners
With the summer quarter coming to a close,
something about Stanford has bothered me
enough to make me write.
I may not be a Californian, but that hardly
neans that I'm to be looked down on by so-called
natives of the Sunshine State. I have been rided for
he way I dress, my slight "Midwest twang" and
?ven the way I eat. Well I'm tired of it.and I must
idmit I'm glad to get out of this "paradise."
Maybe Californians could live better if they un
lerstood the maxim "Do unto neighbors as you
.vould do unto yourself."

I want to be president too. My blood is newer
than Brown's, and never having even been in D.C.,
I am purer than Carter. My proposals are much
more coherent than those of either governor:
1) No tax. As the government requires funds it
will print money. To insure that this doesn't bloat
the national debt, the following two proposals
will drastically reduce federal spending.
2) Self-supporting defense. In peacetime, the
forces waste tremendous funds and energy
through useless exercises and drills. Instead, the
armed forces can be organized into vast planta
tions, supporting themselves with their produce.
3) Self-supporting prisons. The prisons,
likewise, can be organized into huge farms. The
prisoners would enjoy the varied daily duties so
much that demonstrations for prison reform
would become obsolete. Note two important dif
ferences between the defense plantations and the
prison farms. The prisoners do not have to take
part in regimented drills, and prisoners may be
released early for good behavior.
4) No unemployment. Taking a lesson from the
Chinese, all unemployed members of society
would be put to work building a great wall. It
would entirely surround the U.S., from sea to
shining sea.
5) No foreign relations problems. Due to prop
osal 4 we would have no foreign relations, hence
no foreign relations problems.
Please remember to write my name all over your
ballots.

through useless exercises and drills. Instead, the
armed forces can be organized into vast planta
tions, supporting themselves with their produce.
3) Self-supporting prisons. The prisons,
likewise, can be organized into huge farms. The
prisoners would enjoy the varied daily duties so
much that demonstrations for prison reform
would become obsolete. Note two important dif
ferences between the defense plantations and the
prison farms. The prisoners do not have to take
part in regimented drills, and prisoners may be
released early for good behavior.
4) No unemployment. Taking a lesson from the
Chinese, all unemployed members of society
would be put to work building a great wall. It
would entirely surround the U.S., from sea to
shining sea.
5) No foreign relations problems. Due to prop
osal 4 we would have no foreign relations, hence
no foreign relations problems.
Please remember to write my name all over your

Stanford myth
I am a 21-year-old graduate of Stanford Univer
sity. 1 have been supporting myself this summer
through odd jobs. I am intelligent, have a number
of what should be marketable skills and am rather
clever.
I've sent over 90 resumes to prospective
employers, and the best luck I've had is someone
saying. "We'll keep your application on file.
Is a Stanford degree the means to becoming a
social pariah? It seems to,be. because rather than
taking the world by surprise like I'd been told I
would, the world is taking me by surprise.
Why?

Stanford manners
With the summer quarter coming to a close,
something about Stanford has bothered me
enough to make me write.
I may not be a Californian, but that hardly
neans that I'm to be looked down on by so-called
natives of the Sunshine State. I have been rided for
he way I dress, my slight "Midwest twang" and
?ven the way I eat. Well I'm tired of it.and I must
idmit I'm glad to get out of this "paradise."
Maybe Californians could live better if they un
lerstood the maxim "Do unto neighbors as you
.vould do unto yourself."

New candidate
I want to be president too. My blood is newer
than Brown's, and never having even been in D.C.,
I am purer than Carter. My proposals are much
more coherent than those of either governor:
1) No tax. As the government requires funds it
will print money. To insure that this doesn't bloat
the national debt, the following two proposals
will drastically reduce federal spending.
2) Self-supporting defense. In peacetime, the
forces waste tremendous funds and energy
through useless exercises and drills. Instead, the
armed forces can be organized into vast planta
tions, supporting themselves with their produce.
3) Self-supporting prisons. The prisons,
likewise, can be organized into huge farms. The
prisoners would enjoy the varied daily duties so
much that demonstrations for prison reform
would become obsolete. Note two important dif
ferences between the defense plantations and the
prison farms. The prisoners do not have to take
part in regimented drills, and prisoners may be
released early for good behavior.
4) No unemployment. Taking a lesson from the
Chinese, all unemployed members of society
would be put to work building a great wall. It
would entirely surround the U.S., from sea to
shining sea.
5) No foreign relations problems. Due to prop
osal 4 we would have no foreign relations, hence
no foreign relations problems.
