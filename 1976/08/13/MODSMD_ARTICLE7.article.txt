The other evening my wife
and I attended a showing of the
highly touted "R" picture The
Sailor Who Fell From Grace
With The Sea, in Menlo Park.
Imagine my astonishment when
we found sitting next to us four
children ranging in age from
about 7 to 14. How they got in I'll
never know (1 presume someone
paid their admission and the tic
ket taker let them through).
Here is what they were sub
jected to: 1) A preview of a com
ing attraction Futureivorld
showing murder and violence in
the Brave New World to come. 2)
A runner on The Exorcist with
appropriate violence and
suicide death scenes. 3) A run
ner on The Omen with simi
larly appropriate violence and
death scenes. 4) The main fea
ture. based on a story by a de
mented Japanese author (unfor
tunately he committed harikari
after he wrote the story which
was obviously lifted from the
pages of Kraft-Ebing).
There is this over-indulged
and underdisciplined high
school boy and his beautiful,
young, wealthy widowed
mother living in an isolated
mansion by the sea on this pic
turesque but forbidding estuary
on the English coast. Acciden
tally the lad discovers a loose
knot in the wood paneling bet
ween his room and his mother's
boudoir.

Then the director (brilliant!)
takes us on a Parisian peep show

as we see through the eyes of the
boy what he witnesses through
the knot hole. First comes a
scene in which the boy watches
his nude mother (pardon me
â€” she was wearing her knickers)
as she masturbates while gazing
lovingly at a photograph of her
not-so-recently deceased hus
band.
Things improve a few days
later when the mother fortuit
ously meets the handsome
young navigator of the tramp
steamer Belle which has been
laid up in the nearby port for
repairs. From the cleverly scat
tered hints provided by the di
rector the viewers immediately
know that the Belle isn't the only
thing that will be laid up and
down and sideways.
Looking at the four children in
the row with us and other young
people in the audience as we
filed out of the darkened theater,
a sense of rage welled up in meat
the mindless greed and stupidity
of the people who produce and
dispense this visual poison to
deaden the minds and souls of
young and old and the criminal
negligence and utter stupidity of
parents who permit their chil
dren to receive this kind of dis
pensation. And these idiot pa
rents w-onder why Chowchilla
happened.
