I WHO MAKES THE BEST |
ICE CREAM IN TOWN?
- ■ Before we could answer that question, we would first point out
that there are two distinct types of Ice Creams available today:
Commercial Ice Cream, like those sold in your neighborhood ice
cream stores, and Old-fashioned Ice Cream, like you might make
I at home.
To further distinguish them. Commercial Ice Creams are made
from a pre-packaged mix that contains smoothers and other add
itives to give them a "creamy" texture; Old-fashioned Ice I
Creams, on the other hand, are made from Fresh Cream, Grade A
I Milk, Fresh Eggs, 100% Cane Sugar or Honey, Salt, Fruits and
Extracts and have a rich, well-bodied texture.
Who makes the best ice cream in town?
We really can't say. But we know who makes the ONLY Old- I
fashioned-lce Cream in town!
