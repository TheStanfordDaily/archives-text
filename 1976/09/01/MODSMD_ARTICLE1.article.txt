# The 						Class of 1980: Able, accomplished and energetic
##

One of Fred Hargadon's funnier
stories is about the kind of photo
graphs that come in with the freshman
applications. He says he occasionally
finds a female applicant's prom pic
tiiif that has been cut in half, so he gets
<i good look at the bedecked applicant,
who has sprouted an extra arm around
her waist.
Director of Admissions Hargadon
must believe in three-armed females,
because this year's freshman class is 42
percent female, the largest number of
women ever enrolled in a freshman
class at Stanford. The class totals 1530
women and men. give or take the few
students who will < hange their minds
before September 23.
The members of the Class of 1980
come from all 50 states. Washington.
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands
and 18 foreign nations. Less than halt
are from California, and many hail
from small towns across the U.S.
The class has its share of preppies:

26 percent are from independent (in
cluding parochial) schools. With their
publicly-schooled peers, they come
from 937 different secondary schools,
the largest number of schools ever rep
resented in the freshman class.
High scores
Look out sophs, because your suc
cessors are your academic superiors.
They have "slightly better test scores
and slightly better grades" than the
members of the (Mass of '79, according
to Hargadon. Eight new freshmen are
Presidential Scholars.
Barely over eight percent of last
year's high school seniors scored 600
or better on the Verbal SAT, but 42
percent of the 10,000 applicants to
Stanford scored at that level. Sixty
four percent of the candidates for ad
mission scored 600 or better on the
Math SAT, compared to 16 percent ac
ross the nation.
No one has figured out the usually
astonishing percentage of high school

student body presidents in the new
class, but Hargadon tells us 1478 of the
applicants had a 4.0 grade point aver
age.
Harvard recruits
Stanford admitted 2509 of the
applicants, but was rejected by about
980 of those accepted. One-third of
those admitted and not coming have
opted for the Rig Three; Harvard.
Princeton or Yale. About one-half of
those misled souls are going to Har
vard.
Kthnic minorities are represented by
a 5.4 percent black, 5.3 percent
chicanoand 5.4 percent Asian Ameri
can population in this year's class.
Over one-tenth of the freshmen are
following in the footsteps of older sibl
ings, and 14 percent are the sons or
daughters of Stanford alumni.
Illustrious frosh
Among the most illustrious of the
new frosh are two members of the U.S.
Olympic Team, one of whom won a
gold medal. Then there are those who
may not have reached such heights of

athletic achievement, but who run
away with the prize for most original
names: Pichri Pithayachariyakul.
Pramwal Chutikamontham and Aruna
Giovanni Amirthanayagam. We wish
them luck in filling out their Permits to
Register.
Pramwal will have peers hailing
from such towns as Seldovia, Alaska
and Superior, Arizona. Hut 18 mem
bers of the class have found something
better to do this fall and so have
deferred admission until 1977.
Pre-med interest down
Pre-med horror stories of the cut
throat competition in introductory
chemistry classes are still running
rampant, but in fact, a recent report
from the Stanford University News
Service claims that "expressed interest
in medicine among incoming Stanford
freshmen has declined for the third
straight year."
In the same report, Asst. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Robert
Hamrdla says there's opportunity to

both train for a marketable vocational
skill and receive a broad liberal arts
education at Stanford.
Hamrdla, who is also director of the
Academic Information Center, notes
that "any student who plans his nr her
education cogently can work toward a
vocation and at the same time achieve
the best a liberal education can offer."
Engineering more popular
A second University report claims
that interest in engineering among
freshmen has increased for the fourth
year in a row More frosh are also look
ing towards the humanities as their
primary academic interest, ending a
three-year decline in that field.
One out of four freshmen have ex
pressed interest in mathematics,
technology and the natural sciences, a
percentage which is down after a sud
den increase last year.
There is also preliminary evidence
that students are now more interested
in business careers than before.

The job of processing over 1 0.000
applicants keeps the Admissions Of
fice staff busy the entire year.
Each application the office receives
goes into a folder where the informa
tion waits to be computer-coded. The
folder contains at least seven items:
supplementary forms, references,
school reports, test scores and letters
from interested parties (all those plugs
you thought might help you out).
One of the first tasks of the staff is to
evaluate high school transcripts ac
cording to established Stanford
guidelines. Since grading systems are
not standardized throughout the
world. Stanford must find a common
basis upon which to evaluate the
applicants' academic credentials.
This can get to be a tricky process,
since the admissions staff really has no
way of evaluating grading systems .is
to level of difficulty. All students with
a 4.00 or its equivalent are assigned an
academic weight of 1. the scale runs on
down to five.

When the proper documents are in a
candidate's folder, it is sent to one of
the eight admissions officers, who re
views the application and writes a
summary resume.

Although a student's academic re
cord is by far the weightiest factor in
the process of review, extra-curricular
activities and special talents are taken
into consideration.
Hargadon suggests the most out
standing athletes, artists and musi
cians have a definite edge over those
who may have better scholastic re
cords hut less exceptional
nonacadeinic achievements.
In the past, he has admitted that
applicants with alumni parents are
given preference, hut "only if all other
things are equal."
Once the decisions are made, the
congratulatory admit and consoling
reject letters are written and mailed off
on April 1.
Transfers arriving
While the freshmen enjoy their
four-day "summer camp" orientation,
about 250 transfer students will be
moving into their campus residences.
Admission was offered to 330 of the
1917 transfer applicants. The total
number of undergraduates will
stabilize at approximately (>475 stu
dents this academic year.
Although Hargadon admits there are
a couple of "characters" he wouldn't
care to room with (and many who
would request a change if assigned to
share with him), he describes the Class
of 1980 as "able, accomplished, attrac
tive. energetic and diverse a group of
young men and women as I've ever
seen." Last year, he lauded the ("lass of
1979 as merely "able, diverse and
energetic." Like 1 said before, look out
sophs!
In releasing the statistics on the
Class of 1980, Hargadon had the fol
lowing comment: "1 think if I were able
to do it all over again. I'd like to start
college with the (.lass of 1980 at Stan
ford."
