# AIC provides information

### Jacob Young 
At some point during his or
her Stanford career, nearly every
student is sure to encounter an
academic question to which no
one seems to have an answer.
More often than not. the
Academic Information Center
(AIC), housed on the third floor
of Old Union, can provide a
satisfactory solution.
The AIC exists to help under
graduate students define and
achieve their academic and edu
cational goais. The center serves
as a clearinghouse of informa
tion dealing with academic af
fairs.
One of the most frequently
used AIC, services is the im
mense collection of literature
from various colleges, univer
sities and graduate schools
They have information about
scholarships at other institu
tions, plus those available speci
fically to women and other
minorities. Here, too, can be
found applications to the stag
gering array of graduate school

admissions examinations
MCAT, LSAT, (IRE and others.
Another AIC program in
volves preprofessional counsel
ing, available lor students in any
field, but especially those in
pre-med, pre-law and pre
business. Because of specific cir
ricula requirements, pre-med
students are assigned individual
advisors, most of whom .ire
physicians. Because of less
specific requirements, other
preprofessional advision is less
structured.
However, the AIC does not
stress preprofessionalism. Ac
cording to Center Director
Robert Hamrdla. "... there is
nothing further from our minds.
The service exists because stu
dents feel the need for it." In ad
dition. the AIC offers preprofes
sional (rather than just pre-med
or pre-law) advising in order to
encourage students to consider
other career alternatives within
their major field.
For students outside the pre
professional areas, the AIC pri

marially offers help in dealing
with advisors and advising. All
undergraduates who have not
declared a major and all inter
departmental majors are under
the supervision ot the Alt-.
The AlCalso is in charge of all
transfer advising and keeps track
of writing and departmental dis
tribution requirements for every
student.
One brief note: The recent
rush of preprofessionalism
seems to have abated a bit, if last
year's Stanford seniors are any
indication of the trend. Accord
ing to a report released by the
Stanford News Service several
weeks ago, attendance of
graduate school in business is
the only rapidly growing field,
while law held steady (at about
1H percent) and medical school
attendance actually dropped.
Hamrdla is quick to point out
that there has always been a de
mand for preprofessional advis
ing at Stanford, "perhaps be
cause of the kind of students
here," he said.
