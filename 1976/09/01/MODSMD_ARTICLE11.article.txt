### Kathryn Ma 
Freshman Orientation Week
presents the entering student
with an array of activities which
is both fascinating and confus
ing. Every year, there is too
much to see and absorb and too
little time to do it all. We've put
together a brief guide of major
events to help make things a bit
more clear.
Thursday, Sept. 23 — History
of Stanford presentation by Uni
versity Archivist Ralph Hansen
(7 p.m.)
The capsulized storv of iiow
Stanford began—it's really much
more interesting than it sounds.
Ralph Hansen mixes fact with
anecdotes and slides of the orig
inal campus. Well worth your
time, since you probably won't
have the chance to see it again.
Friday, Sept. 24 — Welcome
address by University President
Richard Lyman (10:30 a.m.)
Catch a glimpse of The Man on
campus. This speech can't prove
dull; if the speaker doesn't grab
you. make some new friends.
—Tours of campus facilities
(3-6 p.m.)
Go to those places that vou'll

probably never get to see once
classes begin, like the Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve or the
laser display. If you miss some
thing more common, like the lib
rary, your Resident Associates
(RA's) will be glad to give you a
briefing.
—Dinner with academic ad
visors (6 p.m.)
Know that face, and get to
know that person. Your
academic advisor can be a truly
helpful source of information
and advice, but you must make
the effort to seek out him/her
during the year, besides those
times you need your class study
list approved.
Saturday, Sept. 25 — Football
game: Stanford vs. San Jose State
(1:30 p.m.) If you hate football,
go to see (the Incomparable) L.e
land Stanford Junior University
Marching Band. It will put on a
show like you've never seen be
fore.
—Programs in local resi
dences (afternoon and evening)
Take this time to get to know
people on your hall or corridor
— remembering five names out
of 60 is a good start. Let's hope

one of them is your roommate's.
Sunday, Sept. 26 — Relax and
have fun most of the day, hut
take a few moments to read over
the volumes of material you will
receive from the Orientation
Committee and your Residence
Staff so you know how to go
through Registration. Ask ques
tions: your RA's will know or
find out the answers.

versity Archivist Ralph Hansen
(7 p.m.)
The capsulized storv of iiow
Stanford began—it's really much
more interesting than it sounds.
Ralph Hansen mixes fact with
anecdotes and slides of the orig
inal campus. Well worth your
time, since you probably won't
have the chance to see it again.
Friday, Sept. 24 — Welcome
address by University President
Richard Lyman (10:30 a.m.)
Catch a glimpse of The Man on
campus. This speech can't prove
dull; if the speaker doesn't grab
you. make some new friends.
—Tours of campus facilities
(3-6 p.m.)
Go to those places that vou'll

probably never get to see once
classes begin, like the Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve or the
laser display. If you miss some
thing more common, like the lib
rary, your Resident Associates
(RA's) will be glad to give you a
briefing.
—Dinner with academic ad
visors (6 p.m.)
Know that face, and get to
know that person. Your
academic advisor can be a truly
helpful source of information
and advice, but you must make
the effort to seek out him/her
during the year, besides those
times you need your class study
list approved.
Saturday, Sept. 25 — Football
game: Stanford vs. San Jose State
(1:30 p.m.) If you hate football,
go to see (the Incomparable) L.e
land Stanford Junior University
Marching Band. It will put on a
show like you've never seen be
fore.
—Programs in local resi
dences (afternoon and evening)
Take this time to get to know
people on your hall or corridor
— remembering five names out
of 60 is a good start. Let's hope

one of them is your roommate's.
Sunday, Sept. 26 — Relax and
have fun most of the day, hut
take a few moments to read over
the volumes of material you will
receive from the Orientation
Committee and your Residence
Staff so you know how to go
through Registration. Ask ques
tions: your RA's will know or
find out the answers.
