# Off Campus
## 
### 
If you're not a freshman, but
you're here early anyway,
chances are good that you're
looking for housing. Since we
just found a two story town
house in Menlo Park (with
pool), we can't really em
pathize with you. But we do
have some advice.
First, curse your foul luck.
Kant and rave over the inequity
of the draw. Cry a little.
Then, visit the Clearing
House, room 270 in Tresidder
Union, a special service de
signed to help locate off campus
housing.
The Clearing House will be in
operation from September 7
until September 28, from 9 until
5:30, seven days a week. A
student-run service, headed by
Tony 1 laney and KaylaTemplin,
it will provide housing listings,
roommate-finding sheets, ac
tivities and orientation about the
Palo Alto area, bus schedules,
free telephones, coffee and con
solation.
In addition to the Tresidder
service, the Clearing House
1 lotel, offering a place to shower
and sleep, will be in operation in
Zapata and Burbank Houses in
Stern Hall from September 7 to
September 20. The charge will
be $3.00 per night including li

nen.
In addition to the regular eat
ing places at Tresidder and the
Commons, the eating clubs, lo
cated behind Toyon Hall, will
offer three meals a day. Prices
and times are: breakfast (8-10)
$1.25, lunch (12-1) $1.50, dinner
(5:30-7) $2.50.
For those really new in the
area, the Clearing House Hotel
will offer special inlormation
about the Palo Alto area, public
transportation schedules and
general orientation to the whole
Peninsula.
The receiving office for the
Clearing House Hotel is in the
entrance to Burbank House, on
the west side of Stern Hall. Park
ing is provided in the Stern Hall
rear lots.
The outlook for finding that
perfect room is none too good at
this point. Clearing House offi
cials estimate that 2000 students
will be seeking off-campus hous
ing for the first time this fall. Be
cause of the scarcity of listings,
those with open rooms, houses
or apartments are encouraged to
contact theOff-Campus Housing
Office (497-3906).
A Stanford I.D. or letter of ac
ceptance is required for all Clear
ing House services.

MOVE 'EM OUT — These are just a few of the estimated 2000 who
are seeking off campus housing for the first time this fall. These
were smart people — they used the Clearing House — you could
too. Go to Tresidder.
