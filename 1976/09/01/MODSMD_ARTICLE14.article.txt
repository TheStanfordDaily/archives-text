# Alumni student services
## 
### Jacob Young 
Most undergraduates view the alumni associ
ations as organizations which helps ancient
grads throw parties and keeps them informed
about "how these kids are killing the old alma
mater."
But the Stanford Alumni Association takes a
much more active and productive role in the life
of the University. Through a variety of services,
the Association attempts to facalitate student
access to alumni and to allow both groups to
communicate, in hopes that each may learn from
the other.
The Alumni Contact Service, potentially one
of the most valuable to the undergraduate is a
program designed to provide students with
career information, through contact with an
alumnus. This is not a placement service, but is
rather directed at discovering what is involved
in specific careers.
Many of the participants inthe contact service
are recent graduates, and it is hoped that this
will grow into an extensive program, with con
tacts in every state. Many Stanford Alumni
Clubs, scattered across the nation, have taken up
the service as a Club project.
Student-Alumni dinners are also held at vari
ous times during the year. Alumni Clubs also
sponsor freshman or senior parties for students
in their cities.
Stanford in Government
The Alumni Association also supports the
Stanford-in-Government (SIC) program, which
helps current students find positions and in
ternships in all levels of government, but espe
cially in Washington, D.C. SIG sents lobbyists to
Washington each spring to contact potential
employers and to help students find housing

during their Washington stay.
Planned for this year is a Summer Job Direc
tory which would help students find vacation
employment. Again, this is not a placement ser
vice, but rather a listing of job possibilities.
The Association Executive Board, the guiding
body of the Association, has a student member.
Tom Newell, director of the Association, is
quick to emphasize that, "the alumni are in
terested in students. Often both students and
alumni are apprehensive about one another."
Newell hopes that increased contact between
the two can be accomplished by the Student
Associates program, under which currently en
rolled students would visit the meeting of an
Alumni Club.
Scholarships
In addition to the above services, the Associa
tion offers a number of scholarships, among
them the new Pierce Memorial Award, estab
lished in memory of Robert Pierce, former direc
tor of the Association. The annual award con
sists of a $750 cash grant awarded to a student or
group of students to fund a specific project
which might not fall under normal University
funding criteria.
The Alumni Association, with membership of
41,000 has one of the highest percentage of
graduates as members of any comparable alumni
association. It offers many services specifically
to alumni, among them: Summer Alumni Col
leges, reunions, Stanford Clubs and Travel/
Study Programs.
Anyone seeking information about any
Alumni Association program, especially the
Pierce Memorial Award, should contact the As
â€¢ sociation Office, Bowman Alumni House.
