William Stone served as assis
tant dean of students before
moving to the Inner Quad to be
come assistant to the president
in 1971.
Stone's job is "to improve his
(President Lyman's) chances of
getting things done." Stone, for

while Lyman is busy with some
thing else.

Vice President for Develop
ment K«nneth Cuthbertson is in
charge of one of the most impor
tant duties of a university —
fund-raising. It is a fact of life
that any private university is de
pendent on gift support.

University two-thirds of the way
through the $300 million Cam
paign for Stanford. Collection of
the remainder of those funds
seem almost assured.

Street to pick his vice president
for business and finance. Robert

charge of the "support func

services, police services, the
university press and manage
ment of University land. With a
campus as large as Stanford's

very big job.
On Wall Street. Augsburger
was executive vicn president of
an investment banking firm be
fore taking on his position here
in 1971.

The job of the University pres
ident is analagous to that of a

teachers.
