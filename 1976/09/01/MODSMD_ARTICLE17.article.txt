during the quarter to exchange

views and discuss current topics
and issues in American and

have included: Latin American
and the U.S. Influence. The U.S.
Political Scene, and Poverty,
Environment and the Third
World.
The I-Center also presents
noted speakers from around the
world. Speeches are usually fol

period or general discussion,
and allow for lively (and some
times heated) debate.
