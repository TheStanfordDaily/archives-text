# LAC: It seems to work

At Stanford, where the average high school
CPA of entering freshmen is 3.H, it is ironic that
one of the most popular groups of classes is
taught by the Learning Assistance Center
(LAC).
The center, which opened in 1972, otters
courses in study skills, improvement, reading,
vocabulary, peer counseling and tutoring, as
well as methods of tackling term papers and
theses.
According to LAC director Michael
McHargue, "Stanford students are so bright they
haven't had to develop effective learning skills.
They have achieved high marks without such
instruction."
He explains that cause of poor learning skills
stems from the fact that most students have had
no formal instruction in reading since elemen
tary school. The challenges present in the envi
ronment here — peer pressure, competition for
admission to graduate and professional schools
and personal expectations formed in high
school — have led students to the realization
that efficiency will be what distinguishes them
from other students of equal intelligence.
Departmental tutoring
Besides offering the learning skills improve
ment classes, LAC was instrumental in de
veloping departmental tutoring programs such
as the Physics Reference Frame, the Chemistry
Information Room and the Math Consulting
Center.
Individual tutoring is handled by under
graduates who enroll in the tutor training
course and earn credit for both their training
and the tutoring services.

In 1974, LAC received a grant of $6000 from
the Exxon Education to plan, develop and
evaluate a peer counseling program aimed at
improving study skills.
The peer counselors themselves must take
the LAC-1 "Effective Learning Skills" class to
reinforce their knowledge of learning skills.
After viewing the success of the LAC peer coun
seling program, former undergraduate studies
dean James Gibbs allowed LAC to become the
accrediting agency for all campus peer counsel
ing programs.
Funding
Funding for L.AC programs comes from Un
dergraduate Studies. Uut, since money all over
the University is tight. McHargue sees the
budget as the limiting factor.
"1 don't see facilities expanding mostly be
cause of budget requirements ... we could fill
twice as many reading courses as we have
now," McHargue said.
The LAC program was the subject of a Time
article last year and was labeled a "remedial
program for the bright." McHargue takes a
slightly different approach, wanting to "make it
clear that people don't have to get into an
academic jam in order to use our services. Stan
lord students have a lot of difficulty accepting
help—but everyone, including graduate stu
dents and faculty uses our program."
The techniques of the LAC seem to be effec
tive. McHargue reports that after taking one or
more LACcourses. grades, units completed and
academic reading rates all improve.
The Learning Assistance Center is located in
Meyer 12:1 and is open from 9 until 5 daily.

improving study skills.
The peer counselors themselves must take
the LAC-1 "Effective Learning Skills" class to
reinforce their knowledge of learning skills.
After viewing the success of the LAC peer coun
seling program, former undergraduate studies
dean James Gibbs allowed LAC to become the
accrediting agency for all campus peer counsel
ing programs.
Funding
Funding for L.AC programs comes from Un
dergraduate Studies. Uut, since money all over
the University is tight. McHargue sees the
budget as the limiting factor.
"1 don't see facilities expanding mostly be
cause of budget requirements ... we could fill
twice as many reading courses as we have
now," McHargue said.
The LAC program was the subject of a Time
article last year and was labeled a "remedial
program for the bright." McHargue takes a
slightly different approach, wanting to "make it
clear that people don't have to get into an
academic jam in order to use our services. Stan
lord students have a lot of difficulty accepting
help—but everyone, including graduate stu
dents and faculty uses our program."
The techniques of the LAC seem to be effec
tive. McHargue reports that after taking one or
more LACcourses. grades, units completed and
academic reading rates all improve.
The Learning Assistance Center is located in
Meyer 12:1 and is open from 9 until 5 daily.
At Stanford, where the average high school
CPA of entering freshmen is 3.H, it is ironic that
one of the most popular groups of classes is
taught by the Learning Assistance Center
(LAC).
The center, which opened in 1972, otters
courses in study skills, improvement, reading,
vocabulary, peer counseling and tutoring, as
well as methods of tackling term papers and
theses.
According to LAC director Michael
McHargue, "Stanford students are so bright they
haven't had to develop effective learning skills.
They have achieved high marks without such
instruction."
He explains that cause of poor learning skills
stems from the fact that most students have had
no formal instruction in reading since elemen
tary school. The challenges present in the envi
ronment here — peer pressure, competition for
admission to graduate and professional schools
and personal expectations formed in high
school — have led students to the realization
that efficiency will be what distinguishes them
from other students of equal intelligence.
Departmental tutoring
Besides offering the learning skills improve
ment classes, LAC was instrumental in de
veloping departmental tutoring programs such
as the Physics Reference Frame, the Chemistry
Information Room and the Math Consulting
Center.
Individual tutoring is handled by under
graduates who enroll in the tutor training
course and earn credit for both their training
and the tutoring services.

In 1974, LAC received a grant of $6000 from
the Exxon Education to plan, develop and
evaluate a peer counseling program aimed at
improving study skills.
The peer counselors themselves must take
the LAC-1 "Effective Learning Skills" class to
reinforce their knowledge of learning skills.
