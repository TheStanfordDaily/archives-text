# Big classes: What to expect
## 
### 
In every university, there are a
number of classes with pere
nially high freshman enroll
ments. The following is a partial
list (by no means complete) of
such classes at Stanford. We
have tried to be frank, yet
humorous — hence all advice
should be taken with a grain of
salt.
For further course informa
tion, there are several campus
listing. Course Abstracts is a list
of all classes, by department,
which includes' information
about class requirements and
often the books and subject mat
ter to be covered.
Courses and Degrees is the
Stanford catalog of classes and
University and departmental re
quirements.
The Course Review, pub
lished by the ASSU, is a report of

student questionnaires and.
gives opinion and facts about
most courses.
History 1
Perhaps more than any other
class, History 1, along with
series partners History 2 and 3
(hereafter Modern Europe 1-3),
seems to polarize students —
they love it or they hate it. The
Modern Europe series, Stan
ford's equivilent of Western Civ,
is an attempt at a survey course
without giving shallow treat
ment to any period. The readings
are frequently from primary
sources, which adds substance
to the course.
Admittedly, Modern Europe is
a tough class. The reading is
plentiful, and it ranges from de
lightful and stimulating (Peter
Laslett's The World We Have
Lost) to just plain dull (H.R.R.

Palmer and Joel Coulton's His
tory of the Modern World). Lec
tures are three times a week and
attendence is almost mandatory
if you want to keep up with the
course. There is a two-hour dis
cussion section once a week
which can be a lifesaver or a
pain, depending on the Teach
ing Fellow in charge. Teaching
Fellows are all good historians;
some are just better teachers than
others.
All things considered. Mod
ern Europe 1 gives the fledgling
historian a large dose of history,
philosophy and culture, for
many people their first such ven
ture.
Chemistry 31
The opening day of Chem. 31
is a show to be remembered. Al
most everyone in the class will
consider it a "good idea" to
laden themselves with cal
culators, that brilliant orange
textbook and all their old high
school chemistry notes. The
reason for such an overkill is
both simpleand painful: hereare
the Stanford freshman pre-meds.
Blah, blah and blech bleh.
The material of the introduc
tory Chemistry sequences,
which are "highly recom
mended" for introductory Biol--
ogy 1 and required for later bio
courses, is not in itself difficult.
Nonetheless, the courses are
backbreakers, mostly because of
the competition to "weed out"
those who will not succeed and
eventually drop away to more
enlightened fields.
Although there is a crossec
tion of students from several dis
ciplines (ranging from the mel
low Geology folks to the spaced
Chem majors) the atmosphere is
dominated by grade-craziness.
Chemistry 31 is basically an
easy class. Its main trouble is
that about one third of the stu
dents shouldn't be there in the
first place, hence it looks impos
sible. Your roomma'te may not
cut it, but you will. If the mate
rial is at all familiar the best way
to take the course is with one's
feet up on the desk; enjoy the rest
of Stanford, it may be one of the
last chances you will get for a
while. If Chemistry 31 is taxing,
you hate it, and you'd rather read
Sartre, read Sartre; there is no
mercy in the Mudd building.
Pre-meds work too much,
party too little and complain all
the time; in other words they're
just like everybody else who
thinks he's different. The pre
medical "program in general" at

Stanford is different from most
other universities. Both Chemis
try and Biology dive right into
the toughest parts of each discip
line almost immediately with
organic chem and biochem.
They save the cutting up of ani
mals until the end.
Math 41
The general 'consensus of a
gioup of Daily dinner table con
sultants is that Math 41 is not a
bad class nor an extremely dif
ficult one. It's just plain crazy.
For several reasons.
First, it is offered at H in the
morning. The homework, prob
lem sets are long and must be
turned in. Hence, attendance is
almost mandatory three times a
week.
The final exam is generally
given at night, which means a
whole day of pre-test jitters. The.
final is very difficult. One con
sultant, angry even three years
later, claimed it "downright im
possible."
Prof. Sunseri received very
high marks all around for being a
capable instructor and for being
understanding and helpful
when difficulties arise, as they
well may.
A final warning: The class is
chock-full of pre-med red hots
(see above). They compete like
crazy. You can count on at least
one turkey who stays up half of
every night thinking up "in
sightful" questions with which
to demonstrate his wisdom.
Political Science
An excellent introduction to
some of the major issues facing
the U.S. today. Lectures and
reading in the past have dealt
with freedom vs. equality, pov
erty, control of big business, and
foreign affairs. Reading may
seem taxing, but it isn't, com
pared to higher level political
science courses. Good training
in how to read, how to study
(sections will help here) and
how to take an essay exam.
Psychology 1
Psychology 1: As is tradition
in the Psychology Dept., the
Psych. 1 lecturer is organized,
knowledgeable and articulate. A
favorite among freshmen and
sophomores, this class is large
but worth! the disadvantages of
anonymity. Too many topics are
covered to mention here —
check out the text for the course
(in the bookstore) and the Fall
Course Abstracts (in your resi
dence library and UGLY) for the
complete list. A hard course to
fail if you just go to the lectures,
which will be entertaining and
informative.

Psychology 1
Psychology 1: As is tradition
in the Psychology Dept., the
Psych. 1 lecturer is organized,
knowledgeable and articulate. A
favorite among freshmen and
sophomores, this class is large
but worth! the disadvantages of
anonymity. Too many topics are
covered to mention here —
check out the text for the course
(in the bookstore) and the Fall
Course Abstracts (in your resi
dence library and UGLY) for the
complete list. A hard course to
fail if you just go to the lectures,
which will be entertaining and
informative.

In every university, there are a
number of classes with pere
nially high freshman enroll
ments. The following is a partial
list (by no means complete) of
such classes at Stanford. We
have tried to be frank, yet
humorous — hence all advice
should be taken with a grain of
salt.
For further course informa
tion, there are several campus
listing. Course Abstracts is a list
of all classes, by department,
which includes' information
about class requirements and
often the books and subject mat
ter to be covered.
Courses and Degrees is the
Stanford catalog of classes and
University and departmental re
quirements.
The Course Review, pub
lished by the ASSU, is a report of

student questionnaires and.
gives opinion and facts about
most courses.
History 1
Perhaps more than any other
class, History 1, along with
series partners History 2 and 3
(hereafter Modern Europe 1-3),
seems to polarize students —
they love it or they hate it. The
Modern Europe series, Stan
ford's equivilent of Western Civ,
is an attempt at a survey course
without giving shallow treat
ment to any period. The readings
are frequently from primary
sources, which adds substance
to the course.
Admittedly, Modern Europe is
a tough class. The reading is
plentiful, and it ranges from de
lightful and stimulating (Peter
Laslett's The World We Have
Lost) to just plain dull (H.R.R.

Palmer and Joel Coulton's His
tory of the Modern World). Lec
tures are three times a week and
attendence is almost mandatory
if you want to keep up with the
course. There is a two-hour dis
cussion section once a week
which can be a lifesaver or a
pain, depending on the Teach
ing Fellow in charge. Teaching
Fellows are all good historians;
some are just better teachers than
others.
All things considered. Mod
ern Europe 1 gives the fledgling
historian a large dose of history,
philosophy and culture, for
many people their first such ven
ture.
Chemistry 31
The opening day of Chem. 31
is a show to be remembered. Al
most everyone in the class will
consider it a "good idea" to
laden themselves with cal
culators, that brilliant orange
textbook and all their old high
school chemistry notes. The
reason for such an overkill is
both simpleand painful: hereare
the Stanford freshman pre-meds.
Blah, blah and blech bleh.
The material of the introduc
tory Chemistry sequences,
which are "highly recom
mended" for introductory Biol--
ogy 1 and required for later bio
courses, is not in itself difficult.
Nonetheless, the courses are
backbreakers, mostly because of
the competition to "weed out"
those who will not succeed and
eventually drop away to more
enlightened fields.
Although there is a crossec
tion of students from several dis
ciplines (ranging from the mel
low Geology folks to the spaced
Chem majors) the atmosphere is
dominated by grade-craziness.
Chemistry 31 is basically an
easy class. Its main trouble is
that about one third of the stu
dents shouldn't be there in the
first place, hence it looks impos
sible. Your roomma'te may not
cut it, but you will. If the mate
rial is at all familiar the best way
to take the course is with one's
feet up on the desk; enjoy the rest
of Stanford, it may be one of the
last chances you will get for a
while. If Chemistry 31 is taxing,
you hate it, and you'd rather read
Sartre, read Sartre; there is no
mercy in the Mudd building.
Pre-meds work too much,
party too little and complain all
the time; in other words they're
just like everybody else who
thinks he's different. The pre
medical "program in general" at

Stanford is different from most
other universities. Both Chemis
try and Biology dive right into
the toughest parts of each discip
line almost immediately with
organic chem and biochem.
They save the cutting up of ani
mals until the end.
Math 41
The general 'consensus of a
gioup of Daily dinner table con
sultants is that Math 41 is not a
bad class nor an extremely dif
ficult one. It's just plain crazy.
For several reasons.
First, it is offered at H in the
morning. The homework, prob
lem sets are long and must be
turned in. Hence, attendance is
almost mandatory three times a
week.
The final exam is generally
given at night, which means a
whole day of pre-test jitters. The.
final is very difficult. One con
sultant, angry even three years
later, claimed it "downright im
possible."
Prof. Sunseri received very
high marks all around for being a
capable instructor and for being
understanding and helpful
when difficulties arise, as they
well may.
A final warning: The class is
chock-full of pre-med red hots
(see above). They compete like
crazy. You can count on at least
one turkey who stays up half of
every night thinking up "in
sightful" questions with which
to demonstrate his wisdom.
Political Science
An excellent introduction to
some of the major issues facing
the U.S. today. Lectures and
reading in the past have dealt
with freedom vs. equality, pov
erty, control of big business, and
foreign affairs. Reading may
seem taxing, but it isn't, com

science courses. Good training

For several reasons.
First, it is offered at H in the
morning. The homework, prob
lem sets are long and must be
turned in. Hence, attendance is
almost mandatory three times a
week.
The final exam is generally
given at night, which means a
whole day of pre-test jitters. The.
final is very difficult. One con
sultant, angry even three years
later, claimed it "downright im
possible."
Prof. Sunseri received very
high marks all around for being a
capable instructor and for being
understanding and helpful
when difficulties arise, as they
well may.
A final warning: The class is
chock-full of pre-med red hots
(see above). They compete like
crazy. You can count on at least
one turkey who stays up half of
every night thinking up "in
sightful" questions with which
to demonstrate his wisdom.
Political Science
An excellent introduction to
some of the major issues facing
the U.S. today. Lectures and
reading in the past have dealt
with freedom vs. equality, pov
erty, control of big business, and
foreign affairs. Reading may
seem taxing, but it isn't, com
pared to higher level political
science courses. Good training
in how to read, how to study
(sections will help here) and
how to take an essay exam.
Psychology 1
Psychology 1: As is tradition
in the Psychology Dept., the
Psych. 1 lecturer is organized,
knowledgeable and articulate. A
favorite among freshmen and
sophomores, this class is large
but worth! the disadvantages of
anonymity. Too many topics are
covered to mention here —
check out the text for the course
(in the bookstore) and the Fall
Course Abstracts (in your resi
dence library and UGLY) for the
complete list. A hard course to
fail if you just go to the lectures,
which will be entertaining and
informative.

In every university, there are a
number of classes with pere
nially high freshman enroll
ments. The following is a partial
list (by no means complete) of
such classes at Stanford. We
have tried to be frank, yet
humorous — hence all advice
should be taken with a grain of
salt.
For further course informa
tion, there are several campus
listing. Course Abstracts is a list
of all classes, by department,
which includes' information
about class requirements and
often the books and subject mat
ter to be covered.
Courses and Degrees is the
Stanford catalog of classes and
University and departmental re
quirements.
The Course Review, pub
lished by the ASSU, is a report of

student questionnaires and.
gives opinion and facts about
most courses.
History 1
Perhaps more than any other
class, History 1, along with
series partners History 2 and 3
(hereafter Modern Europe 1-3),
seems to polarize students —
they love it or they hate it. The
Modern Europe series, Stan
ford's equivilent of Western Civ,
is an attempt at a survey course
without giving shallow treat
ment to any period. The readings
are frequently from primary
sources, which adds substance
to the course.
Admittedly, Modern Europe is
a tough class. The reading is
plentiful, and it ranges from de
lightful and stimulating (Peter
Laslett's The World We Have
Lost) to just plain dull (H.R.R.

Palmer and Joel Coulton's His
tory of the Modern World). Lec
tures are three times a week and
attendence is almost mandatory
if you want to keep up with the
course. There is a two-hour dis
cussion section once a week
which can be a lifesaver or a
pain, depending on the Teach
ing Fellow in charge. Teaching
Fellows are all good historians;
some are just better teachers than
others.
All things considered. Mod
ern Europe 1 gives the fledgling
historian a large dose of history,
philosophy and culture, for
many people their first such ven
ture.
Chemistry 31
The opening day of Chem. 31
is a show to be remembered. Al
most everyone in the class will
consider it a "good idea" to
laden themselves with cal
culators, that brilliant orange
textbook and all their old high
school chemistry notes. The
reason for such an overkill is
both simpleand painful: hereare
the Stanford freshman pre-meds.
Blah, blah and blech bleh.
The material of the introduc
tory Chemistry sequences,
which are "highly recom
mended" for introductory Biol--
ogy 1 and required for later bio
courses, is not in itself difficult.
Nonetheless, the courses are
backbreakers, mostly because of
the competition to "weed out"
those who will not succeed and
eventually drop away to more
enlightened fields.
Although there is a crossec
tion of students from several dis
ciplines (ranging from the mel
low Geology folks to the spaced
Chem majors) the atmosphere is
dominated by grade-craziness.
Chemistry 31 is basically an
easy class. Its main trouble is
that about one third of the stu
dents shouldn't be there in the
first place, hence it looks impos
sible. Your roomma'te may not
cut it, but you will. If the mate
rial is at all familiar the best way
to take the course is with one's
feet up on the desk; enjoy the rest
of Stanford, it may be one of the
last chances you will get for a
while. If Chemistry 31 is taxing,
you hate it, and you'd rather read
Sartre, read Sartre; there is no
mercy in the Mudd building.
Pre-meds work too much,
party too little and complain all
the time; in other words they're
just like everybody else who
thinks he's different. The pre
medical "program in general" at

Stanford is different from most
other universities. Both Chemis
try and Biology dive right into
the toughest parts of each discip
line almost immediately with
organic chem and biochem.
They save the cutting up of ani
mals until the end.
Math 41
The general 'consensus of a
gioup of Daily dinner table con
sultants is that Math 41 is not a
bad class nor an extremely dif
ficult one. It's just plain crazy.
For several reasons.
First, it is offered at H in the
morning. The homework, prob
lem sets are long and must be
turned in. Hence, attendance is
