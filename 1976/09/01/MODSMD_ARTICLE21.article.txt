# Places to Know
## MEYER LIBRARY 
### 
The J. Henry Meyer Memo
rial Library (known as
IKILY). designed primarially
for undergraduates, holds ti
collection of over 100,000
volumes and can provide sea
ting space for 1500 persons.
The four floors are divided
into eight large reading and
service areas.
The general book collec

tion is arranged on open
shelves throughout the upper
three floors.
IJGLY is not the place to go
for concentrated study. Often
talking and other social
pastimes take precedence
over academics.
During finals and dead
week, the disturbances take
on a truly creative air. The

Band, General Patten or (tick,
in the Box are likely to ap
pear. although University of
ficials cracked down on such
activities after particularly
destructive antics last winter.
UGLY is open Monday
through Friday from 8 a.m.
until midnight and from
10 a.m. until midnight on
Saturday and Sunday.
