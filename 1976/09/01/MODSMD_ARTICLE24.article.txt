# HOOVER TOWER
## 
### 
The Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace is
located in the major, campus
landmark, Hoover Tower.
The structure is 285 feet high,
with 23 levels.
At the top of the tower is a
35-bell carrillion, a gift of
thanks to Herbert Hoover
from the Belgian American
Educational Foundation.
The extensive library
which includes government
documents, rare periodicals
and unpublished documents
is open to all students of col
lege level and above Monday
through Friday from 8 a.m.
5 p.m. and 8 a.m. â€” 1 p.m.
Saturdays. The library is
closed on Sundays.
About 150 visiting and re
sident scholars, research as
sociates. curators, librarians
and administrative personel
are involved in the Institu
tion.
Institution fellows include
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,
former California Gov.
Ronald Reagan, Seymour
Lipset and many others.
The Institution remains a
mystery to many students. It
is an independent body
within the framework of the
University and many of its
scholars have little or no con
tact with students.
Visitors to the tower may
take an elevator to the top
during daylight hours. On a
clear day, the view of the
campus and the Bay is spec
tacular.
