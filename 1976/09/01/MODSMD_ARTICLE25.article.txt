For many freshman, col

lifestyle, long nights .it vari
ous activities, new experi

broadened horizons. But
Stanford students will get
sick, and when you do, the
Cowell Student Health
Center, located on Campus

Drive behind the Wilbur and
Stern dorms is the place to go.
During the course of the
year, Cowell handles almost
every type of illness or injury,
from minor cuts and bruises
all the way to the almost
annual flu bug which races
through the dorms.

Cowell also offers exten
sive birth control and con
traceptive counseling. Any
services at Cowell are free of
charge, except for common
over-the-counter drugs or
very expensive medications.
There is someone on duty
at Cowell 24 hours a day.
