# Campus Almanac

### 
Stanford continues to change
each year for students, faculty
and administrators. The school
is in a process of evolving — as
each event takes place, it pulls
tht; University in one direction,
until something else happens to
upset the balance again.
Herewith is a summary of the
events of the year 1975-76: how
they affected the campus and
may continue to do so for some
time.
Tenure Controversy
For the second year in a row.
major controversy over tenure
troubled the Stanford academic
community. The issue centered
on thetimeworn academic adage
of "publish or perish"and on the
presence of professors of radical
doctrines. Many junior faculty
members have claimed that the
present tenure system limits
academic freedom, while stu
dents claim that untenured pro
fessors worry so much about te
nure that they are uneffective as
lecturers.
In 1975, Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, a popu
lar instructor and winner of the
Cores Award for Excellence in
teaching, was denied tenure.
Despite protest from students
and faculty, the University Ap
pointments and Promotions
Committee (A and P) insisted
that Irish had not published
enough of his own work to war
rant tenure at Stanford.
Last year. Asst. Sociology
Prof. Anne McMahon, also a
winner of the Cores Award, and
Assoc. Economics Prof. Duncan
Foley, a popular instructor of
Marxist tendencies, were also
denied tenure.
Protest over the Foley decision
was particularly vehement, and
resulted in a day-long boycott of
economics classes in which an
estimated 85% of econ students
participated. Student demands
during the controversy included
a reconsideration of the Foley
decision and student participa
tion in University tenure deci
sions.
On the University side, in
1972, Dean of Humanities and

Sciences Albert Hasdorf said,
" . . . any individual who is to be
recommended for tenure must
be truly superior as either a
teacher or a scholar. He or she
must be demonstrably the best
person available."
Last spring Provost William
Miller stated that "... scholar
ship is an investment in the fu
ture. To neglect it is to be unfair
to faculty members and future
students alike."
Thus a clash between students
seeking personal faculty atten
tion and administration desires
for superior scholarship will no
doubt continue.
Stanford Political Activity
The Stanford student body is
apparently heir to the liberal
political attitudes of the student
movements of the late sixties.
But it also seems to have adopted
the basically apolitical position
of the uni nvolved children of the
seventies.
However, last year several
Stanford political groups spon
sored a wide range of political
events which temporarily urged
many students out of their pre
professional repose.
In January, the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), a leftist
group dedicated to the fight
against "imperialism, sexism
and racism," sponsored a week
long lecture series entitled "Dis
orientation Week."
Among the speakers were
David Dellinger, antiwar activist
and former Chicago Seven de
fendant; H. Bruce Franklin,
former Stanford professor who
was fired in 1971 after one of his
speeches resulted in the obstruc
tion of services at the Stanford
Computation Center, and Marx
ist social critic and philosopher
Herbert Marcuse.
Later in the year, the Stanford
Committee on Political Educa
tion (SCOPE) sponsored a politi
cal orientation program, "Cam
paign '76: Presidential Perspec
tives." Featured during the week
were panel discussions with
representatives of the major
presidential candidates, campus
appearences by Maureen Reagan

(daughter of former California
Gov. Ronald Reagan)and Forrest
Church (son of Idaho Sen. Frank
Church) and a screening of The
Candidate, starring Robert Red
ford.
A straw ballot election was
also held. The Stanford student
body was apparently out of
touch with much of the rest of
the nation, as California Gov.
Edmund Brown, )r. was awarded
32 percent of the vote, while
eventual Democratic nominee
Jimmy Carter received a dismal
9.8 percent.
Student interest was also high
in several state and local races.
David Harris, antiwar activist
and former Stanford student
body president received strong
support in his successful bid for
the Democratic nomination to
challenge Congressman Pete
McCloskey (also a one-time
Stanford student). Tom Hayden,
student activist of the sixties,
lost his bid for the Democratic
senatorial nomination, but

nevertheless received strong
campus support.
Among the few who are truly
political at Stanford, there is a
wide range of political tastes.
Last year offered a varied selec
tion of special guests of various
political leanings.
For those of a conservative
mind, one of the first speeches
last fall featured columnist Wil
liam Buckley, Jr. His speech was
followed by a panel discussion
which featured former San Fran
cisco mayor Joseph Alioto and
Law Prof. Kenneth Scott.
In his winter quarter speech,
Nobel Laureate Milton Fried
man, Prof, of Economics at the
University of Chicago blasted
big government, stating that, "in
every case, government's desire
to do good has led towards a per
version of the public will."
Hoover Institution Senior Fel
low Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, on
campus several times during the
year, was at Hoover working on a
new book on the Russian revolu
tion. Solzhenitsyn is author of
Gulag Archipelago, Cancer
Ward and August 1914.
For persons on the other side
of the political fence, spring
quarter brought access to two
outstanding radical scholars, a
privilege many see as all to rare
at Stanford.
This opportunity came in the
form of the ASSU guest profes
sorships. Financed by an ASSU
fee assessment, the guest profes
sors taught classes here spring
quarter.
Marxist philosopher Angela
Davis taught a class entitled
"The Female Condition: A
Search for a Marxist Approach."
In the opening lecture of the
class, held in Memorial Au
ditorium, Davis characterized
the position of women under
capitalism as "an extreme con
tradiction," noting that
capitalism needs women in the
work force, yet refuses to sup
port them in domestic work.
Radical clinical psychologist
Claude Steiner, author of Scripts
People Live, taught a class in
Radical Psychology. He urged

students to re-examine their at
titudes about psychiatry and to
consider alternatives to tradi
tional behaviorist ideas.
Campus Disturbances
Several times last year, cam
pus disturbances resulted in dis
ciplinary action by the Univer
sity. A far cry from the riots of the
late sixties, the three major inci
dents involved campus organi
zations in supposedly harmless
social activities.
The first major incident oc
cured during Dead Week last
winter quarter. During Dead
Week, there were a series of dis
turbances in Meyer Library in
cluding a variety of musical

groups, an oriental dance
routine and a stereo blasting
"The William Tell Overture."
Normally such activities are
overlooked, as the\ tend to help
relieve the pre-exam pall that
descends on the campus. Hut the
winter quarter uproar included
water baloons and garbage
thrown from the Meyer upper
levels, and was more serious
than the normal pranks.
The result was a new library
policy which declared interfer
ence with library facilities
would henceforth result in pro
secution by the Campus Student
Judicial Council. (SIC").
The next major disturbance
occured late in May. when about
15 members of the Delta Tau
Delta (Delts) fraternity and a
number of friends trashed three
other fraternity houses after a
bachelor party for a Delt at the
chapter house.
The damage included empty
ing trash cans, opening a hole in
the wall at the Beta Theta Phi
(Betas) house and general intimi
dation of Beta House residents.
As a result of the incident.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton announced that the
Delts would be suspended from
using its on campus house for
three years.
There was a great deal of pro
test over the announcement, and
a rally attended by an estimated
450 persons was held in White
Plaza. The Delts charged that the
whole fraternity was being
punished "by association" and
particularly objected to what
they considered Morton's "lack
of due process" in reaching the
decision.
This summer, The Student
judiciary Committee (SJC) an

nounced the suspension ot five
students in connection with the
incident.
In two later disturbances,
members of tin' Band (LSJUMB)
led a rally in Meyer Library late
during spring quarter, and
members of the Band Zeta Psi
fraternity (Zetes) were involved
in trashing a Roble tennis court.
These incidents resulted in
the suspension of twoßandsper
sons. but only a reprimand from
Horton for the Zetes.
Infamous Company
Early last year, the National
Institute of Health (Nil 1) accused
former Microbiology Prot.
Leonard Hayflick with selling
research specimens that were
property of the federal govern
ment.
Hayflick had earlier resigned
from the Medical School faculty
after being informed that the
Medical Center was "not satis
fied" with the way he handled
the specimens. Hayflick's resig
nation was voluntary.
TheNlH charged that Hayflick
opened a private savings ac
count in 1972 and deposited fees
from tests done in University
laboratories. The report then
stated that in 1974, Hayflick
closed that account, deposited
the monies in a personal account
and used them to set up a private
corporation.
Asked at the time whether the
money was still available, Hayf
lick answered, "Oh yes. It al
ways has been."
This was corroborated by John
Schwartz, an asst. vice president
at the Medical Center.
Hayflick has gained an inter
national reputation for his work
in gerontology, the study of ag
ing.

was hurled from the upper levels by students who

Stanford continues to change
each year for students, faculty
and administrators. The school
is in a process of evolving — as
each event takes place, it pulls
tht; University in one direction,
until something else happens to
upset the balance again.
Herewith is a summary of the
events of the year 1975-76: how
they affected the campus and
may continue to do so for some
time.
Tenure Controversy
For the second year in a row.
major controversy over tenure
troubled the Stanford academic
community. The issue centered
on thetimeworn academic adage
of "publish or perish"and on the
presence of professors of radical
doctrines. Many junior faculty
members have claimed that the
present tenure system limits
academic freedom, while stu
dents claim that untenured pro
fessors worry so much about te
nure that they are uneffective as
lecturers.
In 1975, Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, a popu
lar instructor and winner of the
Cores Award for Excellence in
teaching, was denied tenure.
Despite protest from students
and faculty, the University Ap
pointments and Promotions
Committee (A and P) insisted
that Irish had not published
enough of his own work to war
rant tenure at Stanford.
Last year. Asst. Sociology
Prof. Anne McMahon, also a
winner of the Cores Award, and
Assoc. Economics Prof. Duncan
Foley, a popular instructor of
Marxist tendencies, were also
denied tenure.
Protest over the Foley decision
was particularly vehement, and
resulted in a day-long boycott of
economics classes in which an
estimated 85% of econ students
participated. Student demands
during the controversy included
a reconsideration of the Foley
decision and student participa
tion in University tenure deci
sions.
On the University side, in
1972, Dean of Humanities and

Sciences Albert Hasdorf said,
" . . . any individual who is to be
recommended for tenure must
be truly superior as either a
teacher or a scholar. He or she
must be demonstrably the best
person available."
Last spring Provost William
Miller stated that "... scholar
ship is an investment in the fu
ture. To neglect it is to be unfair
to faculty members and future
students alike."
Thus a clash between students
seeking personal faculty atten
tion and administration desires
for superior scholarship will no
doubt continue.
Stanford Political Activity
The Stanford student body is
apparently heir to the liberal
political attitudes of the student
movements of the late sixties.
But it also seems to have adopted
the basically apolitical position
of the uni nvolved children of the
seventies.
However, last year several
Stanford political groups spon
sored a wide range of political
events which temporarily urged
many students out of their pre
professional repose.
In January, the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), a leftist
group dedicated to the fight
against "imperialism, sexism
and racism," sponsored a week
long lecture series entitled "Dis
orientation Week."
Among the speakers were
David Dellinger, antiwar activist
and former Chicago Seven de
fendant; H. Bruce Franklin,
former Stanford professor who
was fired in 1971 after one of his
speeches resulted in the obstruc
tion of services at the Stanford
Computation Center, and Marx
ist social critic and philosopher
Herbert Marcuse.
Later in the year, the Stanford
Committee on Political Educa
tion (SCOPE) sponsored a politi
cal orientation program, "Cam
paign '76: Presidential Perspec
tives." Featured during the week
were panel discussions with
representatives of the major
presidential candidates, campus
appearences by Maureen Reagan

(daughter of former California
Gov. Ronald Reagan)and Forrest
Church (son of Idaho Sen. Frank
Church) and a screening of The
Candidate, starring Robert Red
ford.
A straw ballot election was
also held. The Stanford student
body was apparently out of
touch with much of the rest of
the nation, as California Gov.
Edmund Brown, )r. was awarded
32 percent of the vote, while
eventual Democratic nominee
Jimmy Carter received a dismal
9.8 percent.
Student interest was also high
in several state and local races.
David Harris, antiwar activist
and former Stanford student
body president received strong
support in his successful bid for
the Democratic nomination to
challenge Congressman Pete
McCloskey (also a one-time
Stanford student). Tom Hayden,
student activist of the sixties,
lost his bid for the Democratic
senatorial nomination, but

nevertheless received strong
campus support.
Among the few who are truly
political at Stanford, there is a
wide range of political tastes.
Last year offered a varied selec
tion of special guests of various
political leanings.
For those of a conservative
mind, one of the first speeches
last fall featured columnist Wil
liam Buckley, Jr. His speech was
followed by a panel discussion
which featured former San Fran
cisco mayor Joseph Alioto and
Law Prof. Kenneth Scott.
In his winter quarter speech,
Nobel Laureate Milton Fried
man, Prof, of Economics at the
University of Chicago blasted
big government, stating that, "in
every case, government's desire
to do good has led towards a per
version of the public will."
Hoover Institution Senior Fel
low Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, on
campus several times during the
year, was at Hoover working on a
new book on the Russian revolu
tion. Solzhenitsyn is author of
Gulag Archipelago, Cancer
Ward and August 1914.
For persons on the other side
of the political fence, spring
quarter brought access to two
outstanding radical scholars, a
privilege many see as all to rare
at Stanford.
This opportunity came in the
form of the ASSU guest profes
sorships. Financed by an ASSU
fee assessment, the guest profes
sors taught classes here spring
quarter.
Marxist philosopher Angela
Davis taught a class entitled
"The Female Condition: A
Search for a Marxist Approach."
In the opening lecture of the
class, held in Memorial Au
ditorium, Davis characterized
the position of women under
capitalism as "an extreme con
tradiction," noting that
capitalism needs women in the
work force, yet refuses to sup
port them in domestic work.
Radical clinical psychologist
Claude Steiner, author of Scripts
People Live, taught a class in
Radical Psychology. He urged

students to re-examine their at
titudes about psychiatry and to
consider alternatives to tradi
tional behaviorist ideas.
Campus Disturbances
Several times last year, cam
pus disturbances resulted in dis
ciplinary action by the Univer
sity. A far cry from the riots of the
late sixties, the three major inci
dents involved campus organi
zations in supposedly harmless
social activities.
The first major incident oc
cured during Dead Week last
winter quarter. During Dead
Week, there were a series of dis
turbances in Meyer Library in
cluding a variety of musical

groups, an oriental dance
routine and a stereo blasting
"The William Tell Overture."
Normally such activities are
overlooked, as the\ tend to help
relieve the pre-exam pall that
descends on the campus. Hut the
winter quarter uproar included
water baloons and garbage
thrown from the Meyer upper
levels, and was more serious
than the normal pranks.
The result was a new library
policy which declared interfer
ence with library facilities
would henceforth result in pro
secution by the Campus Student
Judicial Council. (SIC").
The next major disturbance
occured late in May. when about
15 members of the Delta Tau
Delta (Delts) fraternity and a
number of friends trashed three
other fraternity houses after a
bachelor party for a Delt at the
chapter house.
The damage included empty
ing trash cans, opening a hole in
the wall at the Beta Theta Phi
(Betas) house and general intimi
dation of Beta House residents.
As a result of the incident.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton announced that the
Delts would be suspended from
using its on campus house for
three years.
There was a great deal of pro
test over the announcement, and
a rally attended by an estimated
450 persons was held in White
Plaza. The Delts charged that the
whole fraternity was being
punished "by association" and
particularly objected to what
they considered Morton's "lack
of due process" in reaching the
decision.
This summer, The Student
judiciary Committee (SJC) an

nounced the suspension ot five
students in connection with the
incident.
In two later disturbances,
members of tin' Band (LSJUMB)
led a rally in Meyer Library late
during spring quarter, and
members of the Band Zeta Psi
fraternity (Zetes) were involved
in trashing a Roble tennis court.
These incidents resulted in
the suspension of twoßandsper
sons. but only a reprimand from
Horton for the Zetes.
Infamous Company
Early last year, the National
Institute of Health (Nil 1) accused
former Microbiology Prot.
Leonard Hayflick with selling
research specimens that were
property of the federal govern
ment.
Hayflick had earlier resigned
from the Medical School faculty
after being informed that the
Medical Center was "not satis
fied" with the way he handled
the specimens. Hayflick's resig
nation was voluntary.
TheNlH charged that Hayflick
opened a private savings ac
count in 1972 and deposited fees
from tests done in University
laboratories. The report then
stated that in 1974, Hayflick
closed that account, deposited
the monies in a personal account
and used them to set up a private
corporation.
Asked at the time whether the
money was still available, Hayf
lick answered, "Oh yes. It al
ways has been."
This was corroborated by John
Schwartz, an asst. vice president
at the Medical Center.
Hayflick has gained an inter
national reputation for his work
in gerontology, the study of ag
ing.

Stanford continues to change
each year for students, faculty
and administrators. The school
is in a process of evolving — as
each event takes place, it pulls
tht; University in one direction,
until something else happens to
upset the balance again.
Herewith is a summary of the
events of the year 1975-76: how
they affected the campus and
may continue to do so for some
time.
Tenure Controversy
For the second year in a row.
major controversy over tenure
troubled the Stanford academic
community. The issue centered
on thetimeworn academic adage
of "publish or perish"and on the
presence of professors of radical
doctrines. Many junior faculty
members have claimed that the
present tenure system limits
academic freedom, while stu
dents claim that untenured pro
fessors worry so much about te
nure that they are uneffective as
lecturers.
In 1975, Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, a popu
lar instructor and winner of the
Cores Award for Excellence in
teaching, was denied tenure.
Despite protest from students
and faculty, the University Ap
pointments and Promotions
Committee (A and P) insisted
that Irish had not published
enough of his own work to war
rant tenure at Stanford.
Last year. Asst. Sociology
Prof. Anne McMahon, also a
winner of the Cores Award, and
Assoc. Economics Prof. Duncan
Foley, a popular instructor of
Marxist tendencies, were also
denied tenure.
Protest over the Foley decision
was particularly vehement, and
resulted in a day-long boycott of
economics classes in which an
estimated 85% of econ students
participated. Student demands
during the controversy included
a reconsideration of the Foley
decision and student participa
tion in University tenure deci
sions.
On the University side, in
1972, Dean of Humanities and

Sciences Albert Hasdorf said,
" . . . any individual who is to be
recommended for tenure must
be truly superior as either a
teacher or a scholar. He or she
must be demonstrably the best
person available."
Last spring Provost William
Miller stated that "... scholar
ship is an investment in the fu
ture. To neglect it is to be unfair
to faculty members and future
students alike."
Thus a clash between students
seeking personal faculty atten
tion and administration desires
for superior scholarship will no
doubt continue.
Stanford Political Activity
The Stanford student body is
apparently heir to the liberal
political attitudes of the student
movements of the late sixties.
But it also seems to have adopted
the basically apolitical position
of the uni nvolved children of the
seventies.
However, last year several
Stanford political groups spon
sored a wide range of political
events which temporarily urged
many students out of their pre
professional repose.
In January, the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), a leftist
group dedicated to the fight
against "imperialism, sexism
and racism," sponsored a week
long lecture series entitled "Dis
orientation Week."
Among the speakers were
David Dellinger, antiwar activist
and former Chicago Seven de
fendant; H. Bruce Franklin,
former Stanford professor who
was fired in 1971 after one of his
speeches resulted in the obstruc
tion of services at the Stanford
Computation Center, and Marx
ist social critic and philosopher
Herbert Marcuse.
Later in the year, the Stanford
Committee on Political Educa
tion (SCOPE) sponsored a politi
cal orientation program, "Cam
paign '76: Presidential Perspec
tives." Featured during the week
were panel discussions with
representatives of the major
presidential candidates, campus
appearences by Maureen Reagan

(daughter of former California
Gov. Ronald Reagan)and Forrest
Church (son of Idaho Sen. Frank
Church) and a screening of The
Candidate, starring Robert Red
ford.
A straw ballot election was
also held. The Stanford student
body was apparently out of
touch with much of the rest of
the nation, as California Gov.
Edmund Brown, )r. was awarded
32 percent of the vote, while
eventual Democratic nominee
Jimmy Carter received a dismal
9.8 percent.
Student interest was also high
in several state and local races.
David Harris, antiwar activist
and former Stanford student
body president received strong
support in his successful bid for
the Democratic nomination to
challenge Congressman Pete
McCloskey (also a one-time
Stanford student). Tom Hayden,
student activist of the sixties,
lost his bid for the Democratic
senatorial nomination, but

nevertheless received strong
campus support.
Among the few who are truly
political at Stanford, there is a
wide range of political tastes.
Last year offered a varied selec
tion of special guests of various
political leanings.
For those of a conservative
mind, one of the first speeches
last fall featured columnist Wil
liam Buckley, Jr. His speech was
followed by a panel discussion
which featured former San Fran
cisco mayor Joseph Alioto and
Law Prof. Kenneth Scott.
In his winter quarter speech,
Nobel Laureate Milton Fried
man, Prof, of Economics at the
University of Chicago blasted
big government, stating that, "in
every case, government's desire
to do good has led towards a per
version of the public will."
Hoover Institution Senior Fel
low Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, on
campus several times during the
year, was at Hoover working on a
new book on the Russian revolu
tion. Solzhenitsyn is author of
Gulag Archipelago, Cancer
Ward and August 1914.
For persons on the other side
of the political fence, spring
quarter brought access to two
outstanding radical scholars, a
privilege many see as all to rare
at Stanford.
This opportunity came in the
form of the ASSU guest profes
sorships. Financed by an ASSU
fee assessment, the guest profes
sors taught classes here spring
quarter.
Marxist philosopher Angela
Davis taught a class entitled
"The Female Condition: A
Search for a Marxist Approach."
In the opening lecture of the
class, held in Memorial Au
ditorium, Davis characterized
the position of women under
capitalism as "an extreme con
tradiction," noting that
capitalism needs women in the
work force, yet refuses to sup
port them in domestic work.
Radical clinical psychologist
Claude Steiner, author of Scripts
People Live, taught a class in
Radical Psychology. He urged

students to re-examine their at
titudes about psychiatry and to
consider alternatives to tradi
tional behaviorist ideas.
Campus Disturbances
Several times last year, cam
pus disturbances resulted in dis
ciplinary action by the Univer
sity. A far cry from the riots of the
late sixties, the three major inci
dents involved campus organi
zations in supposedly harmless
social activities.
The first major incident oc
cured during Dead Week last
winter quarter. During Dead
Week, there were a series of dis
turbances in Meyer Library in
cluding a variety of musical

groups, an oriental dance
routine and a stereo blasting
"The William Tell Overture."
Normally such activities are
overlooked, as the\ tend to help
relieve the pre-exam pall that
descends on the campus. Hut the
winter quarter uproar included
water baloons and garbage
thrown from the Meyer upper
levels, and was more serious
than the normal pranks.
The result was a new library
policy which declared interfer
ence with library facilities
would henceforth result in pro
secution by the Campus Student
Judicial Council. (SIC").
The next major disturbance
occured late in May. when about
15 members of the Delta Tau
Delta (Delts) fraternity and a
number of friends trashed three
other fraternity houses after a
bachelor party for a Delt at the
chapter house.
The damage included empty
ing trash cans, opening a hole in
the wall at the Beta Theta Phi
(Betas) house and general intimi
dation of Beta House residents.
As a result of the incident.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton announced that the
Delts would be suspended from
using its on campus house for
three years.
There was a great deal of pro
test over the announcement, and
a rally attended by an estimated
450 persons was held in White
Plaza. The Delts charged that the
whole fraternity was being
punished "by association" and
particularly objected to what
they considered Morton's "lack
of due process" in reaching the
decision.
This summer, The Student
judiciary Committee (SJC) an

nounced the suspension ot five
students in connection with the
incident.
In two later disturbances,
members of tin' Band (LSJUMB)
led a rally in Meyer Library late
during spring quarter, and
members of the Band Zeta Psi
fraternity (Zetes) were involved
in trashing a Roble tennis court.
These incidents resulted in
the suspension of twoßandsper
sons. but only a reprimand from
Horton for the Zetes.
Infamous Company
Early last year, the National
Institute of Health (Nil 1) accused
former Microbiology Prot.
Leonard Hayflick with selling
research specimens that were
property of the federal govern
ment.
Hayflick had earlier resigned
from the Medical School faculty
after being informed that the
Medical Center was "not satis
fied" with the way he handled
the specimens. Hayflick's resig
nation was voluntary.
TheNlH charged that Hayflick
opened a private savings ac
count in 1972 and deposited fees
from tests done in University
laboratories. The report then
stated that in 1974, Hayflick
closed that account, deposited
the monies in a personal account
and used them to set up a private
corporation.
Asked at the time whether the
money was still available, Hayf
lick answered, "Oh yes. It al
ways has been."
This was corroborated by John
Schwartz, an asst. vice president
at the Medical Center.
Hayflick has gained an inter
national reputation for his work
in gerontology, the study of ag
ing.

This was corroborated by John

Stanford continues to change
each year for students, faculty
and administrators. The school
is in a process of evolving — as
each event takes place, it pulls
tht; University in one direction,
until something else happens to
upset the balance again.
Herewith is a summary of the
events of the year 1975-76: how
they affected the campus and
may continue to do so for some
time.
Tenure Controversy
For the second year in a row.
major controversy over tenure
troubled the Stanford academic
community. The issue centered
on thetimeworn academic adage
of "publish or perish"and on the
presence of professors of radical
doctrines. Many junior faculty
members have claimed that the
present tenure system limits
academic freedom, while stu
dents claim that untenured pro
fessors worry so much about te
nure that they are uneffective as
lecturers.
In 1975, Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, a popu
lar instructor and winner of the
Cores Award for Excellence in
teaching, was denied tenure.
Despite protest from students
and faculty, the University Ap
pointments and Promotions
Committee (A and P) insisted
that Irish had not published
enough of his own work to war
rant tenure at Stanford.
Last year. Asst. Sociology
Prof. Anne McMahon, also a
winner of the Cores Award, and
Assoc. Economics Prof. Duncan
Foley, a popular instructor of
Marxist tendencies, were also
denied tenure.
Protest over the Foley decision
was particularly vehement, and
resulted in a day-long boycott of
economics classes in which an
estimated 85% of econ students
participated. Student demands
during the controversy included
a reconsideration of the Foley
decision and student participa
tion in University tenure deci
sions.
On the University side, in
1972, Dean of Humanities and

Sciences Albert Hasdorf said,
" . . . any individual who is to be
recommended for tenure must
be truly superior as either a
teacher or a scholar. He or she
must be demonstrably the best
person available."
Last spring Provost William
Miller stated that "... scholar
ship is an investment in the fu
ture. To neglect it is to be unfair
to faculty members and future
students alike."
Thus a clash between students
seeking personal faculty atten
tion and administration desires
for superior scholarship will no
doubt continue.
Stanford Political Activity
The Stanford student body is
apparently heir to the liberal
political attitudes of the student
movements of the late sixties.
But it also seems to have adopted
the basically apolitical position
of the uni nvolved children of the
seventies.
However, last year several
Stanford political groups spon
sored a wide range of political
events which temporarily urged
many students out of their pre
professional repose.
In January, the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), a leftist
group dedicated to the fight
against "imperialism, sexism
and racism," sponsored a week
long lecture series entitled "Dis
orientation Week."
Among the speakers were
David Dellinger, antiwar activist
and former Chicago Seven de
fendant; H. Bruce Franklin,
former Stanford professor who
was fired in 1971 after one of his
speeches resulted in the obstruc
tion of services at the Stanford
Computation Center, and Marx
ist social critic and philosopher
Herbert Marcuse.
Later in the year, the Stanford
Committee on Political Educa
tion (SCOPE) sponsored a politi
cal orientation program, "Cam
paign '76: Presidential Perspec
tives." Featured during the week
were panel discussions with
representatives of the major
presidential candidates, campus
appearences by Maureen Reagan

(daughter of former California
Gov. Ronald Reagan)and Forrest
Church (son of Idaho Sen. Frank
Church) and a screening of The
Candidate, starring Robert Red
ford.
A straw ballot election was
also held. The Stanford student
body was apparently out of
touch with much of the rest of
the nation, as California Gov.
Edmund Brown, )r. was awarded
32 percent of the vote, while
eventual Democratic nominee
Jimmy Carter received a dismal
9.8 percent.
Student interest was also high
in several state and local races.
David Harris, antiwar activist
and former Stanford student
body president received strong
support in his successful bid for
the Democratic nomination to
challenge Congressman Pete
McCloskey (also a one-time
Stanford student). Tom Hayden,
student activist of the sixties,
lost his bid for the Democratic
senatorial nomination, but

nevertheless received strong
campus support.
Among the few who are truly
political at Stanford, there is a
wide range of political tastes.
Last year offered a varied selec
tion of special guests of various
political leanings.
For those of a conservative
mind, one of the first speeches
last fall featured columnist Wil
liam Buckley, Jr. His speech was
followed by a panel discussion
which featured former San Fran
cisco mayor Joseph Alioto and
Law Prof. Kenneth Scott.
In his winter quarter speech,
Nobel Laureate Milton Fried
man, Prof, of Economics at the
University of Chicago blasted
big government, stating that, "in
every case, government's desire
to do good has led towards a per
version of the public will."
Hoover Institution Senior Fel
low Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, on
campus several times during the
year, was at Hoover working on a
new book on the Russian revolu
tion. Solzhenitsyn is author of
Gulag Archipelago, Cancer
Ward and August 1914.
For persons on the other side
of the political fence, spring
quarter brought access to two
outstanding radical scholars, a
privilege many see as all to rare
at Stanford.
This opportunity came in the
form of the ASSU guest profes
sorships. Financed by an ASSU
fee assessment, the guest profes
sors taught classes here spring
quarter.
Marxist philosopher Angela
Davis taught a class entitled
"The Female Condition: A
Search for a Marxist Approach."
In the opening lecture of the
class, held in Memorial Au
ditorium, Davis characterized
the position of women under
capitalism as "an extreme con
tradiction," noting that
capitalism needs women in the
work force, yet refuses to sup
port them in domestic work.
Radical clinical psychologist
Claude Steiner, author of Scripts
People Live, taught a class in
Radical Psychology. He urged

students to re-examine their at
titudes about psychiatry and to
consider alternatives to tradi
tional behaviorist ideas.
Campus Disturbances
Several times last year, cam
pus disturbances resulted in dis
ciplinary action by the Univer
sity. A far cry from the riots of the
late sixties, the three major inci
dents involved campus organi
zations in supposedly harmless
social activities.
The first major incident oc
cured during Dead Week last
winter quarter. During Dead
Week, there were a series of dis
turbances in Meyer Library in
cluding a variety of musical

groups, an oriental dance
routine and a stereo blasting
"The William Tell Overture."
Normally such activities are
overlooked, as the\ tend to help
relieve the pre-exam pall that
descends on the campus. Hut the
winter quarter uproar included
water baloons and garbage
thrown from the Meyer upper
levels, and was more serious
than the normal pranks.
The result was a new library
policy which declared interfer
ence with library facilities
would henceforth result in pro
secution by the Campus Student
Judicial Council. (SIC").
The next major disturbance
occured late in May. when about
15 members of the Delta Tau
Delta (Delts) fraternity and a
number of friends trashed three
other fraternity houses after a
bachelor party for a Delt at the
chapter house.
The damage included empty
ing trash cans, opening a hole in
the wall at the Beta Theta Phi
(Betas) house and general intimi
dation of Beta House residents.
As a result of the incident.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton announced that the
Delts would be suspended from
using its on campus house for
three years.
There was a great deal of pro
test over the announcement, and
a rally attended by an estimated
450 persons was held in White
Plaza. The Delts charged that the
whole fraternity was being
punished "by association" and
particularly objected to what
they considered Morton's "lack
of due process" in reaching the
decision.
This summer, The Student
judiciary Committee (SJC) an

nounced the suspension ot five
students in connection with the
incident.
In two later disturbances,
members of tin' Band (LSJUMB)
led a rally in Meyer Library late
during spring quarter, and
members of the Band Zeta Psi
fraternity (Zetes) were involved
in trashing a Roble tennis court.
These incidents resulted in
the suspension of twoßandsper
sons. but only a reprimand from
Horton for the Zetes.
Infamous Company
Early last year, the National
Institute of Health (Nil 1) accused
former Microbiology Prot.
Leonard Hayflick with selling
research specimens that were
property of the federal govern
ment.
Hayflick had earlier resigned
from the Medical School faculty
after being informed that the
Medical Center was "not satis
fied" with the way he handled
the specimens. Hayflick's resig
nation was voluntary.
TheNlH charged that Hayflick
opened a private savings ac
count in 1972 and deposited fees
from tests done in University
laboratories. The report then
stated that in 1974, Hayflick
closed that account, deposited
the monies in a personal account
and used them to set up a private
corporation.
Asked at the time whether the
money was still available, Hayf
lick answered, "Oh yes. It al
ways has been."
This was corroborated by John
Schwartz, an asst. vice president

Hayflick has gained an inter

TheNlH charged that Hayflick
opened a private savings ac
count in 1972 and deposited fees
from tests done in University
laboratories. The report then
stated that in 1974, Hayflick
closed that account, deposited
the monies in a personal account
and used them to set up a private
corporation.
Asked at the time whether the
money was still available, Hayf
lick answered, "Oh yes. It al
ways has been."
This was corroborated by John
Schwartz, an asst. vice president
at the Medical Center.
Hayflick has gained an inter
national reputation for his work
in gerontology, the study of ag
ing.

Stanford continues to change
each year for students, faculty
and administrators. The school
is in a process of evolving — as
each event takes place, it pulls
tht; University in one direction,
until something else happens to
upset the balance again.
Herewith is a summary of the
events of the year 1975-76: how
they affected the campus and
may continue to do so for some
time.
Tenure Controversy
For the second year in a row.
major controversy over tenure
troubled the Stanford academic
community. The issue centered
on thetimeworn academic adage
of "publish or perish"and on the
presence of professors of radical
doctrines. Many junior faculty
members have claimed that the
present tenure system limits
academic freedom, while stu
dents claim that untenured pro
fessors worry so much about te
nure that they are uneffective as
lecturers.
In 1975, Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, a popu
lar instructor and winner of the
Cores Award for Excellence in
teaching, was denied tenure.
Despite protest from students
and faculty, the University Ap
pointments and Promotions
Committee (A and P) insisted
that Irish had not published
enough of his own work to war
rant tenure at Stanford.
Last year. Asst. Sociology
Prof. Anne McMahon, also a
winner of the Cores Award, and
Assoc. Economics Prof. Duncan
Foley, a popular instructor of
Marxist tendencies, were also
denied tenure.
Protest over the Foley decision
was particularly vehement, and
resulted in a day-long boycott of
economics classes in which an
estimated 85% of econ students
participated. Student demands
during the controversy included
a reconsideration of the Foley
decision and student participa
tion in University tenure deci
sions.
On the University side, in
1972, Dean of Humanities and

Sciences Albert Hasdorf said,
" . . . any individual who is to be
recommended for tenure must
be truly superior as either a
teacher or a scholar. He or she
must be demonstrably the best
person available."
Last spring Provost William
Miller stated that "... scholar
ship is an investment in the fu
ture. To neglect it is to be unfair
to faculty members and future
students alike."
Thus a clash between students
seeking personal faculty atten
tion and administration desires
for superior scholarship will no
doubt continue.
Stanford Political Activity
The Stanford student body is
apparently heir to the liberal
political attitudes of the student
movements of the late sixties.
But it also seems to have adopted
the basically apolitical position
of the uni nvolved children of the
seventies.
However, last year several
Stanford political groups spon
sored a wide range of political
events which temporarily urged
many students out of their pre
professional repose.
In January, the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), a leftist
group dedicated to the fight
against "imperialism, sexism
and racism," sponsored a week
long lecture series entitled "Dis
orientation Week."
Among the speakers were
David Dellinger, antiwar activist
and former Chicago Seven de
fendant; H. Bruce Franklin,
former Stanford professor who
was fired in 1971 after one of his
speeches resulted in the obstruc
tion of services at the Stanford
Computation Center, and Marx
ist social critic and philosopher
Herbert Marcuse.
Later in the year, the Stanford
Committee on Political Educa
tion (SCOPE) sponsored a politi
cal orientation program, "Cam
paign '76: Presidential Perspec
tives." Featured during the week
were panel discussions with
representatives of the major
presidential candidates, campus
appearences by Maureen Reagan

(daughter of former California
Gov. Ronald Reagan)and Forrest
Church (son of Idaho Sen. Frank
Church) and a screening of The
Candidate, starring Robert Red
ford.
A straw ballot election was
also held. The Stanford student
body was apparently out of
touch with much of the rest of
the nation, as California Gov.
Edmund Brown, )r. was awarded
32 percent of the vote, while
eventual Democratic nominee
Jimmy Carter received a dismal
9.8 percent.
Student interest was also high
in several state and local races.
David Harris, antiwar activist
and former Stanford student
body president received strong
support in his successful bid for
the Democratic nomination to
challenge Congressman Pete
McCloskey (also a one-time
Stanford student). Tom Hayden,
student activist of the sixties,
lost his bid for the Democratic
senatorial nomination, but

nevertheless received strong
campus support.
Among the few who are truly
political at Stanford, there is a
wide range of political tastes.
Last year offered a varied selec
tion of special guests of various
political leanings.
For those of a conservative
mind, one of the first speeches
last fall featured columnist Wil
liam Buckley, Jr. His speech was
followed by a panel discussion
which featured former San Fran
cisco mayor Joseph Alioto and
Law Prof. Kenneth Scott.
In his winter quarter speech,
Nobel Laureate Milton Fried
man, Prof, of Economics at the
University of Chicago blasted
big government, stating that, "in
every case, government's desire
to do good has led towards a per
version of the public will."
Hoover Institution Senior Fel
low Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, on
campus several times during the
year, was at Hoover working on a
new book on the Russian revolu
tion. Solzhenitsyn is author of
Gulag Archipelago, Cancer
Ward and August 1914.
For persons on the other side
of the political fence, spring
quarter brought access to two
outstanding radical scholars, a
privilege many see as all to rare
at Stanford.
This opportunity came in the
form of the ASSU guest profes
sorships. Financed by an ASSU
fee assessment, the guest profes
sors taught classes here spring
quarter.
Marxist philosopher Angela
Davis taught a class entitled
"The Female Condition: A
Search for a Marxist Approach."
In the opening lecture of the
class, held in Memorial Au
ditorium, Davis characterized
the position of women under
capitalism as "an extreme con
tradiction," noting that
capitalism needs women in the
work force, yet refuses to sup
port them in domestic work.
Radical clinical psychologist
Claude Steiner, author of Scripts
People Live, taught a class in
Radical Psychology. He urged

students to re-examine their at
titudes about psychiatry and to
consider alternatives to tradi
tional behaviorist ideas.
Campus Disturbances
Several times last year, cam
pus disturbances resulted in dis
ciplinary action by the Univer
sity. A far cry from the riots of the
late sixties, the three major inci
dents involved campus organi
zations in supposedly harmless
social activities.
The first major incident oc
cured during Dead Week last
winter quarter. During Dead
Week, there were a series of dis
turbances in Meyer Library in
cluding a variety of musical

groups, an oriental dance
routine and a stereo blasting
"The William Tell Overture."
Normally such activities are
overlooked, as the\ tend to help
relieve the pre-exam pall that
descends on the campus. Hut the
winter quarter uproar included
water baloons and garbage
thrown from the Meyer upper
levels, and was more serious
than the normal pranks.
The result was a new library
policy which declared interfer
ence with library facilities
would henceforth result in pro
secution by the Campus Student
Judicial Council. (SIC").
The next major disturbance
occured late in May. when about
15 members of the Delta Tau
Delta (Delts) fraternity and a
number of friends trashed three
other fraternity houses after a
bachelor party for a Delt at the
chapter house.
The damage included empty
ing trash cans, opening a hole in
the wall at the Beta Theta Phi
(Betas) house and general intimi
dation of Beta House residents.
As a result of the incident.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton announced that the
Delts would be suspended from
using its on campus house for
three years.
There was a great deal of pro
test over the announcement, and
a rally attended by an estimated
450 persons was held in White
Plaza. The Delts charged that the
whole fraternity was being
punished "by association" and
particularly objected to what
they considered Morton's "lack
of due process" in reaching the
decision.
This summer, The Student
judiciary Committee (SJC) an

nounced the suspension ot five
students in connection with the
incident.
In two later disturbances,
members of tin' Band (LSJUMB)
led a rally in Meyer Library late
during spring quarter, and
members of the Band Zeta Psi
fraternity (Zetes) were involved
in trashing a Roble tennis court.
These incidents resulted in
the suspension of twoßandsper
sons. but only a reprimand from
Horton for the Zetes.
Infamous Company
Early last year, the National
Institute of Health (Nil 1) accused
former Microbiology Prot.
Leonard Hayflick with selling
research specimens that were
property of the federal govern
ment.
Hayflick had earlier resigned
from the Medical School faculty
after being informed that the
Medical Center was "not satis
fied" with the way he handled
the specimens. Hayflick's resig
nation was voluntary.
TheNlH charged that Hayflick
opened a private savings ac
count in 1972 and deposited fees
from tests done in University
laboratories. The report then
stated that in 1974, Hayflick
closed that account, deposited
the monies in a personal account
and used them to set up a private
corporation.
Asked at the time whether the
money was still available, Hayf
lick answered, "Oh yes. It al
ways has been."
This was corroborated by John
Schwartz, an asst. vice president
at the Medical Center.
Hayflick has gained an inter
national reputation for his work
in gerontology, the study of ag
ing.
