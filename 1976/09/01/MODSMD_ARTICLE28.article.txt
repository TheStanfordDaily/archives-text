# Campus musical groups are diverse
## 
### Jacob Young 
The Stanford Department of Music
offers a wide selection of organized
groups which perform nearly every
type of music imaginable. All musical
groups are open to students and for
most you need not be a music major.
Since the list of musical groups is ex
tensive. anyone seeking detailed in
formation about any group should
contact the department offices, located
on the Knoll.
Tht> University Chorus, a group of
150 members, performs only "serious
music" according to John Planting,
departmental administrative assistant.
The first scheduled concert of the
Chorus is Nov. 21. when they will pre
form a new choral work written and
directed by Howard Hansen.
During spring quarter, the Chorus
will preform Das Klagende Lied by
Mahler, in conjunction with the Stan
ford Symphony Orchestra.
The Memorial Church Choir sings at
the weekly University worship ser
vices. Their repertoire is composed
mostly of sacred music and works for
special services. The Choir consists of
about 60 members.
Chorale
For those interested in classical
Chorale, particularly that of the lHth
century, the Stanford Chorale offers
small groups which performat various
times during the year.
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra
and the Stanford Chamber Orchestra
provide the community with several
fine concerts each year. As with most
of the musical groups, one unit of cre
dit per quarter may be earned for each.
The courses may also be audited.
Perhaps the most well-known, and
certainly the most visibleof thegroups
is the Incomparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band,
(LSJIJMB). Under the direction of Ar
thur Barnes, the Band performs during
football and basketball games and also
at spontaneous, exuberant and some

times illegal troupes around campus.
The Wi nd Ensemble and Studio Jazz
Band, also under the direction of
Barnes, and the Brass Choir, complete
the list of modern wind groups.
Those who favor music from a diffe
rent age, will appreciate the Renais
sance Wind Band, which performs
medieval and early baroque music. All
instruments used are authentic repro
ductions of period instruments.
Early Music Singers
The Early Music Singers, under the
direction of William Mart, perform
vocal renditions of music from the
same time period.
Bonnie Hempen, a member of Stan
ford's premier group. The Francesco
Trio, directs the Chamber music prog
ram, which contains a number of
groups.
If your tastes run more towards light
and popular music, the Clee Club, a

large group is probably the one for you.
Another musical group which is not
under the Department of Music is the
Mendicants. They are an all-male
vocal group whose repertoire ranges
from Bach to the Beachbovs.
As you can see. to list the complete
details of the program would be im
possible. But one group, because of
their diligent efforts, deserves special
mention.
Savoyards
Stanford has a very active Cilbert
and Sullivan company, "The Stanford
Savoyards." A unique combination of
students, staff, faculty and alumni, it
produces two shows a year, a fall and
spring quarters. The 1976-77 season
will offer "The Pirates of Penzance"
and"The Condoliers."
Members of the company give of
their talents in diverse ways for diffe
rent shows. Thus someone who is in

the cast for one show might be a re
hearsal accompanist, or work on sets
or costumes for a not her. Several of the
major leads in recent Savoyard pro
ductions began as either chorus mem
bers or minor leads in previousshows.
About 130 people are required to put
on each show: 50 in the cast, 30-40 in
the orchestra, the rest in the many pro
duction jobs.
Auditions for the fall production
"The Pirates of Penzance" will be held
on Sept. 27 and 2H from 9-10 p.m.
Further information will be an
nounced in the Daily and posted
around campus.
In addition, many people will be
needed to build sets and costumes, to
act as rehearsal accompanist and to
help with clerical jobs.
Anyone interested should contact
Rita Taylor. Producer of the
Savoyards.
