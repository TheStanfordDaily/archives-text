# Drama welcomes student involvement
## 
### Jacob Young 
The Stanford Department of Drama,
under the direction ofacting chairman
Elenor Prosser. has lined up an excit
ing season of traditional and modern
theatre. But one of the most exciting
prospects for the year centers around
the appointment of Martin Esslin to
the Drama faculty.
Trained as a director, Esslin worked
for many years with the BBC in a
number of positions. But his most
famous work, that which caused Pros
ser to describe him as, "... the plum
which every university has been trying
to pick." comes in the area of criti
cism.
Author of Brecht: A Choice of Evils,
and The Theatre of the Absurd, Eisslin
has helped to develop the shape of
modern theatre through his extensive
work in writing, especially in his posi
tion as official translator of the works
of Harold Pinter.

Not to be shunted into the academic
attic, Esslin will teach both graduate
and undergraduate courses.
The main season of the Drama De
partment will consist of three major
productions.
"Coriolanus"
First, on Nov. 24-30 and December
1-4. Yannis Chioles will direct the
Brecht/Shakespeare play.
"Coriolanus." Based on Shakespeare's
play, this production of Brecht's in
terpretation presents a society ruled by
war-mongers and generals who force
their lifestyle on an unwilling
populace.
During February, a production of
Peter Weiss' "The Persecution and As
sassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Pre
formed by the Inmates of the Asylum
of Charenton Under the Direction of
Marquis de Sade" will be presented.
This is a fascinating play, with plenty

of psychological conflict, and will be
staged in the Scene Shop, which al
lows a theatre-in-the-round affect, not
possible on the Mem Aud main stage.
As a final offering in May. William
Shakespear's "As You Like It" will be
produced under the direction of
graduate student Leigh Sealv-
The department has arranged sev
eral opportunities for those interested
in any aspect of drama to become ac
quainted with the offerings of the de
partment. During Orientation Week,
tours of the Little Theatre will be of
fered. with Drama facultv present.
Open house
The Drama Office, located on the
back of Memorial Auditorium, will be
open during Registration Day. On Oct.
3, there will be an open house in the
Little Theatre, located on the left side
of Mem Aud. Refreshments will be
served.
The Annual Departmental Reunion

will be held on Oct. 2. Potential majors
are invited, but please contact the
Drama office for reservations.
Auditions for "Coriolanus" will be
held on Sept. 29-31 on the Mem Aud
main stage.
Prosser urges non-majors to become
involved in the department. She states
that. "It's really wide open. Many lead
roles go to non-majors and some to
first-timers." In drama classes, also
open to non-majors, "the students and
faculty develop close knit groups. The
classes also provide entrance into
other areas of the department." she
said.
Ram's Head is a student drama
group which reorganized last year
after a three year hiatus. Last spring
they staged a production of the musi
cal Guys and Dolls. The group has
plans to produce another play this
year.

The Stanford Department of Drama,
under the direction ofacting chairman
Elenor Prosser. has lined up an excit
ing season of traditional and modern
theatre. But one of the most exciting
prospects for the year centers around
the appointment of Martin Esslin to
the Drama faculty.
Trained as a director, Esslin worked
for many years with the BBC in a
number of positions. But his most
famous work, that which caused Pros
ser to describe him as, "... the plum
which every university has been trying
to pick." comes in the area of criti
cism.
Author of Brecht: A Choice of Evils,
and The Theatre of the Absurd, Eisslin
has helped to develop the shape of
modern theatre through his extensive
work in writing, especially in his posi
tion as official translator of the works
of Harold Pinter.

Not to be shunted into the academic
attic, Esslin will teach both graduate
and undergraduate courses.

partment will consist of three major

"Coriolanus." Based on Shakespeare's
play, this production of Brecht's in

war-mongers and generals who force
their lifestyle on an unwilling
populace.
