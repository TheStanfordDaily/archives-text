# Lively Arts at Stanford: 'Best season ever'
## 
### Meg Walker 
Freshmen are lucky people. Not only do they receive a
valuable coupon in the mail for a night of delicious
entertainment right here on campus, but they also have
arrived for a promising performing arts season at Stan
ford.
"It's the best season ever." smiles Tom Bachetti. direc
tor of the Office of Public Events. Bachetti has pushed
performing arts at Stanford ever since he was Associate
Producer for Stanford's Summer Festival back in 1964.
After the unfortunate folding of the Summer Festival.
Bachetti became involved with the Office of Public
Events Tuesday Night Series. This was a weekly event
that featured special lectures and travel films. Bachetti
cut out the lecture series and expanded the performing
arts section.
Eventually the Program became the Lively Arts at
Stanford. What are Lively Arts? Lively Arts include
selections of music, drama and dance. However it's not
just any artistic piece. As Bachetti says. "There is a
difference between Beethoven and the Beatles, even
though they're both art."
How does a suburban, fresh air campus like Stanford
attract some of the most intense, exquisite artists in the
country?
"Let's face it."says Bachetti. "the Center of Perform
ing Arts is New York City."
But all is not lost. Due to traveling companies and
tours. Bachetti has managed to bring an exciting prog
ram to Stanford. In fact, in the earlier part of his career,
Bachetti brought the prestigious loffrev Ballet to per
form in S<m Francisco and the American Conservatory
Theatre (A.C.T.). now one of San Francisco's finest re
pertory theatres.
Personally. Bachetti is more excited about the first
Lively Arts Performance by the Chamber Music Society
of Lincoln Center. The Music Society is always a sellout
in New York and for the first time it is traveling to the
West Coast. Noted for its unusual and interesting per
formances. the Music Society is sure to start off the
season right. It will play in Memorial Auditorium on
Oct. 22.
Another exciting musical program will be presented
by the Guarneri String Quartet. The Quartet is 10 years
old and performs regularly at Stanford, although it
originated in New York. This is the first year it has an
all-Beethoven program for Stanford.
After distributing Lively Arts programs to the com
munitv. the tickets have alreadv sold so ouicklv that

Hachetti has had to reserve 200 tickets to each perfor
mance for students. The Guarneri will perform in
November and February in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
An unusual combination of acting, singing, musicand
pantomine will be found in the performance of the Music
Ensemble to be held Friday, Nov. 5. The Ensemble, an
outgrowth of the renown New York Fro Musica Antigua,
looks into liturgical drama and early theatre, beginning
in the church. Returning to Stanford, the Ensemble will
present a fourteenth century secular french drama, "Ro
man de Fauvel." A satire, encompassing exciting topics
of love, morality and politics, the performance should be
a successful occasion.
The Lively Arts seems to have turned inside out, and
completely overwhelmed itself with this year's schedule
of dance performance. But when you encounter Les Bal
lets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, everything starts and
ends with no purpose.
An all-male ballet troupe, the Monte Carlo, takes off
with classical ballet and comes out with a witty and
perhaps bizarre experience. The troupe does not idolize
ballet or the dancers. No longer are these dancers made
godlike; in fact, often a performance may be led bv an
unnervingly flabby performer.
Les Ballets Trockadero will be presented by the Monte
Carlo on Oct. 29 in Memorial Auditorium. ArleneCroce,
dance critic for New Yorker magazine, says a Monte
Carlo dancer "runs on ego. He is a star because he has a
self."
Hachetti suggests, "Go to look at it as fun and you will
be entertained." At any rate, art is certainly lively with
the Monte Carlo.
The dance performances don't end with Monte Carlo.
Remember the "lets" in West Side Story? Well. Baby
John Jet comes to Stanford in February. He is now direct
ing his own company, the Eliot Feld Ballet.
The group was formed in 1974 and is already one of
the finest dance companies, right up there with Alvin
Ailev and the Joffrey Ballet. Feld is a classic choreog
rapher who has gained experience from every sort of
dance.
The highlights of the Lively Arts program are endless,
lose Ferrer, the celebrated actor and author, presents
"The Art of Monologue." There will be a production of
"Are You Now or Have You Ever Been . . .?." a dramati
zation of the McCarthy Era.
y Lively Arts even presents a child prodigy, leffrev
Svvann began his career at the age of 4; in November he
will play works of Beethoven. Ravel and Lizst.


OVER. UNDER AND AROTND — The Pilobolus Dance
Theatre was only one of the productions brought to Stanford
last year hy the Office of Public Events. The group is com-
IMisecl of six young dancers who began working together
when they were students at Dartmouth. The group combines
mime, acrobatics and gymnastics with dance, to create a

smooth, flowing stream of movement which is truly unique.
Public. Affairs will nrnduce other dance companies this year,
including Lea Ballets Trockadero <!«• Monte Carlo, .1 male
group of classical dance spofters, and the newly acclaimed
f.liot Field Ballet.

Theatre was only one of the productions brought to Stanford
last year hy the Office of Public Events. The group is com-
IMisecl of six young dancers who began working together

mime, acrobatics and gymnastics with dance, to create a

Public. Affairs will nrnduce other dance companies this year,

Freshmen are lucky people. Not only do they receive a

entertainment right here on campus, but they also have
arrived for a promising performing arts season at Stan
ford.
"It's the best season ever." smiles Tom Bachetti. direc
tor of the Office of Public Events. Bachetti has pushed
performing arts at Stanford ever since he was Associate
Producer for Stanford's Summer Festival back in 1964.
After the unfortunate folding of the Summer Festival.
Bachetti became involved with the Office of Public
Events Tuesday Night Series. This was a weekly event
that featured special lectures and travel films. Bachetti
cut out the lecture series and expanded the performing
arts section.
Eventually the Program became the Lively Arts at
Stanford. What are Lively Arts? Lively Arts include
selections of music, drama and dance. However it's not
just any artistic piece. As Bachetti says. "There is a
difference between Beethoven and the Beatles, even
though they're both art."
How does a suburban, fresh air campus like Stanford
attract some of the most intense, exquisite artists in the
country?
"Let's face it."says Bachetti. "the Center of Perform
ing Arts is New York City."
But all is not lost. Due to traveling companies and
tours. Bachetti has managed to bring an exciting prog
ram to Stanford. In fact, in the earlier part of his career,
Bachetti brought the prestigious loffrev Ballet to per
form in S<m Francisco and the American Conservatory
Theatre (A.C.T.). now one of San Francisco's finest re
pertory theatres.
Personally. Bachetti is more excited about the first
Lively Arts Performance by the Chamber Music Society
of Lincoln Center. The Music Society is always a sellout
in New York and for the first time it is traveling to the
West Coast. Noted for its unusual and interesting per
formances. the Music Society is sure to start off the
season right. It will play in Memorial Auditorium on
Oct. 22.
Another exciting musical program will be presented
by the Guarneri String Quartet. The Quartet is 10 years
old and performs regularly at Stanford, although it
originated in New York. This is the first year it has an
all-Beethoven program for Stanford.
After distributing Lively Arts programs to the com
munitv. the tickets have alreadv sold so ouicklv that

Hachetti has had to reserve 200 tickets to each perfor
mance for students. The Guarneri will perform in
November and February in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
An unusual combination of acting, singing, musicand
pantomine will be found in the performance of the Music
Ensemble to be held Friday, Nov. 5. The Ensemble, an
outgrowth of the renown New York Fro Musica Antigua,
looks into liturgical drama and early theatre, beginning
in the church. Returning to Stanford, the Ensemble will
present a fourteenth century secular french drama, "Ro
man de Fauvel." A satire, encompassing exciting topics
of love, morality and politics, the performance should be
a successful occasion.
The Lively Arts seems to have turned inside out, and
completely overwhelmed itself with this year's schedule
of dance performance. But when you encounter Les Bal
lets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, everything starts and
ends with no purpose.
An all-male ballet troupe, the Monte Carlo, takes off
with classical ballet and comes out with a witty and
perhaps bizarre experience. The troupe does not idolize
ballet or the dancers. No longer are these dancers made
godlike; in fact, often a performance may be led bv an
unnervingly flabby performer.
Les Ballets Trockadero will be presented by the Monte
Carlo on Oct. 29 in Memorial Auditorium. ArleneCroce,
dance critic for New Yorker magazine, says a Monte
Carlo dancer "runs on ego. He is a star because he has a
self."
Hachetti suggests, "Go to look at it as fun and you will
be entertained." At any rate, art is certainly lively with
the Monte Carlo.
The dance performances don't end with Monte Carlo.

John Jet comes to Stanford in February. He is now direct
ing his own company, the Eliot Feld Ballet.
The group was formed in 1974 and is already one of
the finest dance companies, right up there with Alvin
Ailev and the Joffrey Ballet. Feld is a classic choreog
rapher who has gained experience from every sort of
dance.
The highlights of the Lively Arts program are endless,

"The Art of Monologue." There will be a production of
"Are You Now or Have You Ever Been . . .?." a dramati
zation of the McCarthy Era.

Freshmen are lucky people. Not only do they receive a
valuable coupon in the mail for a night of delicious
entertainment right here on campus, but they also have
arrived for a promising performing arts season at Stan
ford.
"It's the best season ever." smiles Tom Bachetti. direc
tor of the Office of Public Events. Bachetti has pushed
performing arts at Stanford ever since he was Associate
Producer for Stanford's Summer Festival back in 1964.
After the unfortunate folding of the Summer Festival.
Bachetti became involved with the Office of Public
Events Tuesday Night Series. This was a weekly event
that featured special lectures and travel films. Bachetti
cut out the lecture series and expanded the performing
arts section.
Eventually the Program became the Lively Arts at
Stanford. What are Lively Arts? Lively Arts include
selections of music, drama and dance. However it's not
just any artistic piece. As Bachetti says. "There is a
difference between Beethoven and the Beatles, even
though they're both art."
How does a suburban, fresh air campus like Stanford
attract some of the most intense, exquisite artists in the
country?
"Let's face it."says Bachetti. "the Center of Perform
ing Arts is New York City."
But all is not lost. Due to traveling companies and
tours. Bachetti has managed to bring an exciting prog
ram to Stanford. In fact, in the earlier part of his career,
Bachetti brought the prestigious loffrev Ballet to per
form in S<m Francisco and the American Conservatory
Theatre (A.C.T.). now one of San Francisco's finest re
pertory theatres.
Personally. Bachetti is more excited about the first
Lively Arts Performance by the Chamber Music Society
of Lincoln Center. The Music Society is always a sellout
in New York and for the first time it is traveling to the
West Coast. Noted for its unusual and interesting per
formances. the Music Society is sure to start off the
season right. It will play in Memorial Auditorium on
Oct. 22.
Another exciting musical program will be presented
by the Guarneri String Quartet. The Quartet is 10 years
old and performs regularly at Stanford, although it
originated in New York. This is the first year it has an
all-Beethoven program for Stanford.
After distributing Lively Arts programs to the com
munitv. the tickets have alreadv sold so ouicklv that

Hachetti has had to reserve 200 tickets to each perfor
mance for students. The Guarneri will perform in
November and February in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
An unusual combination of acting, singing, musicand
pantomine will be found in the performance of the Music
Ensemble to be held Friday, Nov. 5. The Ensemble, an
outgrowth of the renown New York Fro Musica Antigua,
looks into liturgical drama and early theatre, beginning
in the church. Returning to Stanford, the Ensemble will
present a fourteenth century secular french drama, "Ro
man de Fauvel." A satire, encompassing exciting topics
of love, morality and politics, the performance should be
a successful occasion.
The Lively Arts seems to have turned inside out, and
completely overwhelmed itself with this year's schedule
of dance performance. But when you encounter Les Bal
lets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, everything starts and
ends with no purpose.
An all-male ballet troupe, the Monte Carlo, takes off
with classical ballet and comes out with a witty and
perhaps bizarre experience. The troupe does not idolize
ballet or the dancers. No longer are these dancers made
godlike; in fact, often a performance may be led bv an
unnervingly flabby performer.
Les Ballets Trockadero will be presented by the Monte
Carlo on Oct. 29 in Memorial Auditorium. ArleneCroce,
dance critic for New Yorker magazine, says a Monte
Carlo dancer "runs on ego. He is a star because he has a
self."
Hachetti suggests, "Go to look at it as fun and you will
be entertained." At any rate, art is certainly lively with
the Monte Carlo.
The dance performances don't end with Monte Carlo.
Remember the "lets" in West Side Story? Well. Baby
John Jet comes to Stanford in February. He is now direct
ing his own company, the Eliot Feld Ballet.
The group was formed in 1974 and is already one of
the finest dance companies, right up there with Alvin
Ailev and the Joffrey Ballet. Feld is a classic choreog
rapher who has gained experience from every sort of
dance.
