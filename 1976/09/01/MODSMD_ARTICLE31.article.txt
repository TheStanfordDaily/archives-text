# Traditions

Who remembers the Plug
I Jgly? The freshman-sophomore
rush? How about tubbing, or the
annual pajamarino?
Almost nobody. All are Stan
ford traditions that died out long
ago. And while some, like "kis
sing in the Quad," are making a
comeback, others are recalled
only in tin; musty pages of the
earliest Quads.
Hut why did Stanford tradi
tions evolve in the first place?
And it our grandparents enjoyed
them so much, why aren't the
same rituals around today?
"People have a need for tradi
tions." says Gerald Talley, act
ing assistant professor of sociol
ogy. Years spent in college are
ones of emotional, intellectual
and aspirational change. "It is
important to have something st
able, even if it's belonging to the
Stanford community," remarks
Talley.
There are two basic reasons for
the existence of traditions here,
according to Talley. The first is
to initiate members into the
group "so they got a feeling they
really belong here, that they're
not still at home, but in a new
place."
The second reason people

cling to traditions is to "reaffirm
their membership in the group."
For example, Talley says, "only
insiders participate in the Big
Came." He explains that taking
part in Big Game activities such
as the bonfire "says 'I'm a Stan
ford person, in contrast to those
others at Gal.' "
These needs have created
some antics at Stanford that can
only be termed bizarre. Birge M.
Clark, a member of the class of
1914, can remember one such
custom — the freshman
sophomore rush, an annual
wale-on-'em free-for-all.
"In those days the freshman
sophomore rushes were called
'tie-ups,' " he reminisces, "and
they were held on the baseball
diamond" located between the
main library and Kncina, a men's
dorm at that time.
Compounds for each class
were marked off and the men
(women "strictly were not in
volved" in this sort of thing)
were provided with cloth ban
dages. Each class was divided
into groups of five and lined up
on opposite sides of the baseball
diamond.
Juniors and seniors super
vised as the groups of under
classmen "rushed at each other

and tried to isolate one of the
opposite class" in order to tie
him up.
"Some (men) were quite skill
ful" in taking one wrist or ankle,
making "a slip noose, and jerk
ing up the other one," recalls
Clark. "Then they would go
running off. carrying or drag
ging their victim to the com
pound.
"The sophomores usually
succeeded in tying up most of
the freshmen. The freshmen had
a reputation for not being very
well organized." laughs (Hark.
Tubbing was a more odious
form of freshman hazing, ac
cording to Clark.
The bathtubs were filled with
water from Searsville Lake,
which "smelled very bad." Clark
says. The unfortunate freshman
was "held under until he bub
bled, which meant that he had
taken water into his lungs. Then
he'd be taken out and rescusci
tated." No one ever died, but one
man "almost drowned," recalls
Clark.
Hats were an important part of
one's dress in the early days at
Stanford. Although the 1915
Quad says that traditionally,
"due to the climatological result
of Stanford's mild and clear air"

Stanford women went hatless,
the men still wore them.
Freshmen donned caps or
"dinks," while the sophomores
sported red hats with gray
bands.
"Gray stovepipe hats" called
plugs were worn by the juniors,
says Clark, and emeritus profes
sor Harold Bacon recalls that the
senior sombreros, which looked
like "engineers' hats or army
campaign hats," dated back to
before 1901, when his father was
a student.
Plug llgly'
The junior hats were the focus
of another long-dead tradition,
the Plug Ugly. This was "an up
perclass fight between the
juniors and seniors," explains
Clark.
Art students would paint the
junior plugs with a white paint
containing lead, which dried to a
very hard finish. On a desig
nated day the juniors would
march around the inner Quad
carrying their hats, which Clark
says were "used as weapons"
against bands of marauding
seniors bent on smashing the
plugs.
Clark comments that the
heavy, hard hats were very
dangerous and that "several
people were badly cut."
Because of increasing physi
cal danger associated with the
Plug Ugly, the ceremony was
abolished in 1913. As Clark puts
it, tongue-in-cheek, "it was all
right for the freshmen and
sophomores to fight because
they were kind of savages any
way, but upperclassmen
shouldn't do that sort of thing."
But the annual pajamarino, or
"nightshirt peerade," had to
have been the zaniest custom of
all.
On the first moonlight night of

the year Encina men, instead of
growing hair on their palms,
marched to Roble where they
serenaded the sleepy female in
habitants. From there they
paraded along the Row. and fi
nally cruised into Palo Alto and
crashed the theatre for some late
night entertainment.
Human ladders
That entertainment must have
been extremely stimulating be
cause records tell of student
police clashes and people in
jured when they were used as
ladders to reach the balcony.
The 1915 Quad says this
quaint tradition "started the
night of April 23,1892 when 220

Encina men in white night shirts
(over clothes) marched along
Alvarado. circling around Roble
and then to Mayfield."
The men were celebrating
Stanford's baseball victory over
Cal, and eventually marched to
Menlo to provide an escort for
the homecoming heroes.
Sociology Prof. Morris
Zelditch )r. presents two com
pelling reasons most such tradi
tions are gone for good.
First, he notes that over the
years graduate enrollment has
increased relative to the number
of undergraduates at Stanford.
He hypothesizes that graduate
students are more interested in

what's going on in their fields
worldwide rather than in local
symbols and rituals, and that
this global view has broadened
the isolated, tightly-knit com
munity feeling necessary for
many Stanford traditions.
Zelditch also points out that
Stanford is no longer a finishing
school for the middle and upper
classes. Four years at Stanford
used to be social "preparation

for assuming a certain place in
the class structure."
Playboy school
Hut as increasing numbers of
students are preparing for
careers rather than inherited
wealth a Stanford education has
become less socially oriented.
The image of Stanford as a
playboy school has waned, and
with it have gone many social
traditions.
Talley agrees with Zelditch
that students' increasing career
orientations led to the death of
many traditions.
"Stanford is more and more a
training institution," Talley exp
lains. "It doesn't have the flavor

of community and family" it
used to have.
"People have enormous career
drives," Talley concludes. Stu
dents are at Stanford to prepare
for med school or law school.
"They're on their way to some
other community, even if it's
only in their heads. In the early
days college was an end in it
self," but that feeling isn't so
common today.

ago. And while some, like "kis
sing in the Quad," are making a
comeback, others are recalled
only in tin; musty pages of the
earliest Quads.
Hut why did Stanford tradi
tions evolve in the first place?
And it our grandparents enjoyed
them so much, why aren't the
same rituals around today?
"People have a need for tradi
tions." says Gerald Talley, act
ing assistant professor of sociol
ogy. Years spent in college are
ones of emotional, intellectual
and aspirational change. "It is
important to have something st
able, even if it's belonging to the
Stanford community," remarks
Talley.
There are two basic reasons for
the existence of traditions here,
according to Talley. The first is
to initiate members into the
group "so they got a feeling they
really belong here, that they're
not still at home, but in a new
place."
The second reason people

cling to traditions is to "reaffirm
their membership in the group."
For example, Talley says, "only
insiders participate in the Big
Came." He explains that taking
part in Big Game activities such
as the bonfire "says 'I'm a Stan
ford person, in contrast to those
others at Gal.' "
These needs have created
some antics at Stanford that can
only be termed bizarre. Birge M.
Clark, a member of the class of
1914, can remember one such
custom — the freshman
sophomore rush, an annual
wale-on-'em free-for-all.
"In those days the freshman
sophomore rushes were called
'tie-ups,' " he reminisces, "and
they were held on the baseball
diamond" located between the
main library and Kncina, a men's
dorm at that time.
Compounds for each class
were marked off and the men
(women "strictly were not in
volved" in this sort of thing)
were provided with cloth ban
dages. Each class was divided
into groups of five and lined up
on opposite sides of the baseball
diamond.
Juniors and seniors super
vised as the groups of under
classmen "rushed at each other

and tried to isolate one of the
opposite class" in order to tie
him up.
"Some (men) were quite skill
ful" in taking one wrist or ankle,
making "a slip noose, and jerk
ing up the other one," recalls
Clark. "Then they would go
running off. carrying or drag
ging their victim to the com
pound.
"The sophomores usually
succeeded in tying up most of
the freshmen. The freshmen had
a reputation for not being very
well organized." laughs (Hark.
Tubbing was a more odious
form of freshman hazing, ac
cording to Clark.
The bathtubs were filled with
water from Searsville Lake,
which "smelled very bad." Clark
says. The unfortunate freshman
was "held under until he bub
bled, which meant that he had
taken water into his lungs. Then
he'd be taken out and rescusci
tated." No one ever died, but one
man "almost drowned," recalls
Clark.
Hats were an important part of
one's dress in the early days at
Stanford. Although the 1915
Quad says that traditionally,
"due to the climatological result
of Stanford's mild and clear air"

Stanford women went hatless,
the men still wore them.
Freshmen donned caps or
"dinks," while the sophomores
sported red hats with gray
bands.
"Gray stovepipe hats" called
plugs were worn by the juniors,
says Clark, and emeritus profes
sor Harold Bacon recalls that the
senior sombreros, which looked
like "engineers' hats or army
campaign hats," dated back to
before 1901, when his father was
a student.
Plug llgly'
The junior hats were the focus
of another long-dead tradition,
the Plug Ugly. This was "an up
perclass fight between the
juniors and seniors," explains
Clark.
Art students would paint the
junior plugs with a white paint
containing lead, which dried to a
very hard finish. On a desig
nated day the juniors would
march around the inner Quad
carrying their hats, which Clark
says were "used as weapons"
against bands of marauding
seniors bent on smashing the
plugs.
Clark comments that the
heavy, hard hats were very
dangerous and that "several
people were badly cut."
Because of increasing physi
cal danger associated with the
Plug Ugly, the ceremony was
abolished in 1913. As Clark puts
it, tongue-in-cheek, "it was all
right for the freshmen and
sophomores to fight because
they were kind of savages any
way, but upperclassmen
shouldn't do that sort of thing."
But the annual pajamarino, or
"nightshirt peerade," had to
have been the zaniest custom of
all.
On the first moonlight night of

the year Encina men, instead of
growing hair on their palms,
marched to Roble where they
serenaded the sleepy female in
habitants. From there they
paraded along the Row. and fi
nally cruised into Palo Alto and
crashed the theatre for some late
night entertainment.
Human ladders
That entertainment must have
been extremely stimulating be
cause records tell of student
police clashes and people in
jured when they were used as
ladders to reach the balcony.
The 1915 Quad says this
quaint tradition "started the
night of April 23,1892 when 220

Encina men in white night shirts
(over clothes) marched along
Alvarado. circling around Roble
and then to Mayfield."
The men were celebrating
Stanford's baseball victory over
Cal, and eventually marched to
Menlo to provide an escort for
the homecoming heroes.
Sociology Prof. Morris
Zelditch )r. presents two com
pelling reasons most such tradi
tions are gone for good.
First, he notes that over the
years graduate enrollment has
increased relative to the number
of undergraduates at Stanford.
He hypothesizes that graduate
students are more interested in

what's going on in their fields
worldwide rather than in local
symbols and rituals, and that
this global view has broadened
the isolated, tightly-knit com
munity feeling necessary for
many Stanford traditions.
Zelditch also points out that
Stanford is no longer a finishing
school for the middle and upper
classes. Four years at Stanford
used to be social "preparation

for assuming a certain place in
the class structure."
Playboy school
Hut as increasing numbers of
students are preparing for
careers rather than inherited
wealth a Stanford education has
become less socially oriented.
The image of Stanford as a
playboy school has waned, and
with it have gone many social
traditions.
Talley agrees with Zelditch
that students' increasing career
orientations led to the death of
many traditions.
"Stanford is more and more a
training institution," Talley exp
lains. "It doesn't have the flavor

of community and family" it
used to have.
"People have enormous career
drives," Talley concludes. Stu
dents are at Stanford to prepare
for med school or law school.
"They're on their way to some

Hut why did Stanford tradi
tions evolve in the first place?
And it our grandparents enjoyed
them so much, why aren't the
same rituals around today?
"People have a need for tradi
tions." says Gerald Talley, act
ing assistant professor of sociol
ogy. Years spent in college are
ones of emotional, intellectual
and aspirational change. "It is
important to have something st
able, even if it's belonging to the
Stanford community," remarks
Talley.
There are two basic reasons for
the existence of traditions here,
according to Talley. The first is
to initiate members into the
group "so they got a feeling they
really belong here, that they're
not still at home, but in a new
place."
The second reason people

cling to traditions is to "reaffirm
their membership in the group."
For example, Talley says, "only
insiders participate in the Big
Came." He explains that taking
part in Big Game activities such
as the bonfire "says 'I'm a Stan
ford person, in contrast to those
others at Gal.' "
These needs have created
some antics at Stanford that can
only be termed bizarre. Birge M.
Clark, a member of the class of
1914, can remember one such
custom — the freshman
sophomore rush, an annual
wale-on-'em free-for-all.
"In those days the freshman
sophomore rushes were called
'tie-ups,' " he reminisces, "and
they were held on the baseball
diamond" located between the
main library and Kncina, a men's
dorm at that time.
Compounds for each class
were marked off and the men
(women "strictly were not in
volved" in this sort of thing)
were provided with cloth ban
dages. Each class was divided
into groups of five and lined up
on opposite sides of the baseball
diamond.
Juniors and seniors super
vised as the groups of under
classmen "rushed at each other

and tried to isolate one of the
opposite class" in order to tie
him up.
"Some (men) were quite skill
ful" in taking one wrist or ankle,
making "a slip noose, and jerk
ing up the other one," recalls
Clark. "Then they would go
running off. carrying or drag
ging their victim to the com
pound.
"The sophomores usually
succeeded in tying up most of
the freshmen. The freshmen had
a reputation for not being very
well organized." laughs (Hark.
Tubbing was a more odious
form of freshman hazing, ac
cording to Clark.
The bathtubs were filled with
water from Searsville Lake,
which "smelled very bad." Clark
says. The unfortunate freshman
was "held under until he bub
bled, which meant that he had
taken water into his lungs. Then
he'd be taken out and rescusci
tated." No one ever died, but one
man "almost drowned," recalls
Clark.
Hats were an important part of
one's dress in the early days at
Stanford. Although the 1915
Quad says that traditionally,
"due to the climatological result
of Stanford's mild and clear air"

Stanford women went hatless,
the men still wore them.
Freshmen donned caps or
"dinks," while the sophomores
sported red hats with gray
bands.
"Gray stovepipe hats" called
plugs were worn by the juniors,
says Clark, and emeritus profes
sor Harold Bacon recalls that the
senior sombreros, which looked
like "engineers' hats or army
campaign hats," dated back to
before 1901, when his father was
a student.
Plug llgly'
The junior hats were the focus
of another long-dead tradition,
the Plug Ugly. This was "an up
perclass fight between the
juniors and seniors," explains
Clark.
Art students would paint the
junior plugs with a white paint
containing lead, which dried to a
very hard finish. On a desig
nated day the juniors would
march around the inner Quad
carrying their hats, which Clark
says were "used as weapons"
against bands of marauding
seniors bent on smashing the
plugs.
Clark comments that the
heavy, hard hats were very
dangerous and that "several
people were badly cut."
Because of increasing physi
cal danger associated with the
Plug Ugly, the ceremony was
abolished in 1913. As Clark puts
it, tongue-in-cheek, "it was all
right for the freshmen and
sophomores to fight because
they were kind of savages any
way, but upperclassmen
shouldn't do that sort of thing."
But the annual pajamarino, or
"nightshirt peerade," had to
have been the zaniest custom of
all.
On the first moonlight night of

the year Encina men, instead of
growing hair on their palms,
marched to Roble where they
serenaded the sleepy female in
habitants. From there they
paraded along the Row. and fi
nally cruised into Palo Alto and
crashed the theatre for some late
night entertainment.
Human ladders
That entertainment must have
been extremely stimulating be
cause records tell of student
police clashes and people in
jured when they were used as
ladders to reach the balcony.
The 1915 Quad says this
quaint tradition "started the
night of April 23,1892 when 220

Encina men in white night shirts
(over clothes) marched along
Alvarado. circling around Roble
and then to Mayfield."
The men were celebrating
Stanford's baseball victory over
Cal, and eventually marched to
Menlo to provide an escort for
the homecoming heroes.
Sociology Prof. Morris
Zelditch )r. presents two com
pelling reasons most such tradi
tions are gone for good.
First, he notes that over the
years graduate enrollment has
increased relative to the number
of undergraduates at Stanford.
He hypothesizes that graduate
students are more interested in

what's going on in their fields
worldwide rather than in local
symbols and rituals, and that
this global view has broadened
the isolated, tightly-knit com
munity feeling necessary for
many Stanford traditions.
Zelditch also points out that
Stanford is no longer a finishing
school for the middle and upper
classes. Four years at Stanford
used to be social "preparation

for assuming a certain place in
the class structure."
Playboy school
Hut as increasing numbers of
students are preparing for
careers rather than inherited
wealth a Stanford education has
become less socially oriented.
The image of Stanford as a
playboy school has waned, and

traditions.
Talley agrees with Zelditch
that students' increasing career
orientations led to the death of
many traditions.
"Stanford is more and more a
training institution," Talley exp
lains. "It doesn't have the flavor

of community and family" it
used to have.
"People have enormous career
drives," Talley concludes. Stu
dents are at Stanford to prepare
for med school or law school.
"They're on their way to some

"People have a need for tradi
tions." says Gerald Talley, act
ing assistant professor of sociol
ogy. Years spent in college are
ones of emotional, intellectual
and aspirational change. "It is
important to have something st
able, even if it's belonging to the
Stanford community," remarks
Talley.
There are two basic reasons for
the existence of traditions here,
according to Talley. The first is
to initiate members into the
group "so they got a feeling they
really belong here, that they're
not still at home, but in a new
place."
The second reason people

cling to traditions is to "reaffirm
their membership in the group."
For example, Talley says, "only
insiders participate in the Big
Came." He explains that taking
part in Big Game activities such
as the bonfire "says 'I'm a Stan
ford person, in contrast to those
others at Gal.' "
These needs have created
some antics at Stanford that can
only be termed bizarre. Birge M.
Clark, a member of the class of
1914, can remember one such
custom — the freshman
sophomore rush, an annual
wale-on-'em free-for-all.
"In those days the freshman
sophomore rushes were called
'tie-ups,' " he reminisces, "and
they were held on the baseball
diamond" located between the
main library and Kncina, a men's
dorm at that time.
Compounds for each class
were marked off and the men
(women "strictly were not in
volved" in this sort of thing)
were provided with cloth ban
dages. Each class was divided
into groups of five and lined up
on opposite sides of the baseball
diamond.
Juniors and seniors super
vised as the groups of under
classmen "rushed at each other

and tried to isolate one of the
opposite class" in order to tie
him up.
"Some (men) were quite skill
ful" in taking one wrist or ankle,
making "a slip noose, and jerk
ing up the other one," recalls
Clark. "Then they would go
running off. carrying or drag
ging their victim to the com
pound.
"The sophomores usually
succeeded in tying up most of
the freshmen. The freshmen had
a reputation for not being very
well organized." laughs (Hark.
Tubbing was a more odious
form of freshman hazing, ac
cording to Clark.
The bathtubs were filled with
water from Searsville Lake,
which "smelled very bad." Clark
says. The unfortunate freshman
was "held under until he bub
bled, which meant that he had
taken water into his lungs. Then
he'd be taken out and rescusci
tated." No one ever died, but one
man "almost drowned," recalls
Clark.
Hats were an important part of
one's dress in the early days at
Stanford. Although the 1915
Quad says that traditionally,
"due to the climatological result
of Stanford's mild and clear air"

Stanford women went hatless,
the men still wore them.
Freshmen donned caps or
"dinks," while the sophomores
sported red hats with gray
bands.
"Gray stovepipe hats" called
plugs were worn by the juniors,
says Clark, and emeritus profes
sor Harold Bacon recalls that the
senior sombreros, which looked
like "engineers' hats or army
campaign hats," dated back to
before 1901, when his father was
a student.
Plug llgly'
The junior hats were the focus
of another long-dead tradition,
the Plug Ugly. This was "an up
perclass fight between the
juniors and seniors," explains
Clark.
Art students would paint the
junior plugs with a white paint
containing lead, which dried to a
very hard finish. On a desig
nated day the juniors would
march around the inner Quad
carrying their hats, which Clark
says were "used as weapons"
against bands of marauding
seniors bent on smashing the
plugs.
Clark comments that the
heavy, hard hats were very
dangerous and that "several
people were badly cut."
Because of increasing physi
cal danger associated with the
Plug Ugly, the ceremony was
abolished in 1913. As Clark puts
it, tongue-in-cheek, "it was all
right for the freshmen and
sophomores to fight because
they were kind of savages any
way, but upperclassmen
shouldn't do that sort of thing."
But the annual pajamarino, or
"nightshirt peerade," had to
have been the zaniest custom of
all.
On the first moonlight night of

the year Encina men, instead of
growing hair on their palms,
marched to Roble where they
serenaded the sleepy female in
habitants. From there they
paraded along the Row. and fi
nally cruised into Palo Alto and
crashed the theatre for some late
night entertainment.
Human ladders
That entertainment must have
been extremely stimulating be
cause records tell of student
police clashes and people in
jured when they were used as
ladders to reach the balcony.
The 1915 Quad says this
quaint tradition "started the
night of April 23,1892 when 220

Encina men in white night shirts
(over clothes) marched along
Alvarado. circling around Roble
and then to Mayfield."
The men were celebrating
Stanford's baseball victory over
Cal, and eventually marched to
Menlo to provide an escort for
the homecoming heroes.
Sociology Prof. Morris
Zelditch )r. presents two com
pelling reasons most such tradi
tions are gone for good.
First, he notes that over the
years graduate enrollment has
increased relative to the number
of undergraduates at Stanford.
He hypothesizes that graduate
students are more interested in

what's going on in their fields
worldwide rather than in local
symbols and rituals, and that
this global view has broadened
the isolated, tightly-knit com
munity feeling necessary for
many Stanford traditions.
Zelditch also points out that
Stanford is no longer a finishing
school for the middle and upper
classes. Four years at Stanford
used to be social "preparation

for assuming a certain place in
the class structure."
Playboy school
Hut as increasing numbers of
students are preparing for
careers rather than inherited
wealth a Stanford education has
become less socially oriented.
The image of Stanford as a
playboy school has waned, and
with it have gone many social
traditions.
Talley agrees with Zelditch
that students' increasing career
orientations led to the death of
many traditions.
"Stanford is more and more a
training institution," Talley exp
lains. "It doesn't have the flavor

of community and family" it
used to have.
"People have enormous career
drives," Talley concludes. Stu
dents are at Stanford to prepare
for med school or law school.
"They're on their way to some
other community, even if it's
only in their heads. In the early
days college was an end in it
self," but that feeling isn't so
common today.

OI J) BOY HIGH F ASHION — These members of the Class of '99 followed a number of traditions which
have fallen by the wayside through the years. The high hats were an important wardrobe accessory.
