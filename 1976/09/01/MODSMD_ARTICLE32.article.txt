# The 						City
## 
### 
San rrancisco is the biggest
tourist attraction in northern
California, and it deserves to be
treated with respect. After the
rush of the first few weeks of the
quarter, you'll want to get out
and explore the area, and San
Francisco is a good place to start.
The best way to see it is to
drive to a central location (say
the Wharf or near Grant Street),
park and then walk. There's
plenty to see, and driving about
will cause you to miss the real
flavor of the place.
Try to go in a group the first
time. It can really help to have
friends along when you get tired.
It you art; totally unfamiliar with
San Francisco, you might want
to get a map. If you don't want to
carry it, at least spend a few mi
nutes absorbing the general lay
out of things.
On July 1. the bureau opened a

Visitor Information Center in
Benjamin H. Swig Pavilion. Hal-
I id it; Plaza. Powell and Market
Streets. Located on the lower
level — directly opposite the
HAK I' station — it will be open
from a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
There's one important thing to
remember while visiting San
Francisco. The worst thing one
.111 do while there is identify
inese|t to the natives as a tourist.
And the best way to look like a

tourist is to reter to the place as
"Frisco." Calling it "SF" won't
get one much further. Only Herb
Caen can get away with
"Baghdad by the Bay."
While "San Francisco" may
sound unwieldy when used in
every other sentence, it is the ac
cepted term.
To save a little breath, "the
City" is permitted. True, there
are dozens of cities around here,
but only one merits capitaliza
tion.
While we're on the topic of
things one doesn't do in San
Francisco, perhaps we should
discuss one more. While on the
cable cars, do not sing the Rice
a-Roni theme song. Don't even
whistle it, no matter how strong
the temptation. It's considered
very tacky.
Now. What does one do in the;
City?

Cable Cars: Three different
lines serve the City and its vis
itors. The fare is 25 cents, and
you can ask for a transfer, which
is good on any cable car. street or
bus. On Sundays and holidays,
the cable car lines offer a 50 cent
all-day excursion pass.
Powell-Hyde starts at the turnta
ble ;it Powell and Market, climbs
Nob Hill, turns west, and turns
around at Victorian Park, next to
Chirardelli Square.

Powel/-Mcison starts at Market
Street, goes up No!) Hill and
through North Beach to Bay
Street, near Fisherman's Wharf.
California Street travels in a
straight line from California and
Market on Van Ness, going
through the Financial District
and Chinatown.
Chinatown: An area best
traveled on foot. Located on a
section of Crant Ave., near
Union Square, it includes lots of
gift shops, groceries and herb
dealers, and a fortune cookie fac
tory.
Coit Tower: At the top of Tele
graph Hill, this is one of the ci
ty's best lookout spots, with a
panoramic view of the bay. Cet
there by following Lombard
Street up the hill.
Crookedest Street in the World:
On Russian Hill, a block-long
portion of Lombard Street drops

from Hyde to Leavenworth, zig
zagging back and forth several
times. It is one-way downhill.
Fisherman's Wharf: Fishing
boats, seafood, museums. T-shirt
shops, amusement arcades, Kip
ley's "Believe It or Not" estab
lishment, street artists, street
musicians and lots of assorted in
teresting characters. Not to be
missed, even if all you do is walk
around and stare. The main in
tersection is Taylor and Jefferson

Street, and it is a short walk from
either the Cannery or Ghirardelli
Square.
49-mile drive: If you've got at
least three hours free and lots of
gas in your tank, you might like
this scenic drive that winds
through the city, passing many
of the more popular parts of
town. Follow the signs with the
seagull on them.
Ghirardelli Square (and the
Cannery and Victorian Park):
Many more shops, galleries, sin
gers, restaurants and un
employed musicians. Visit the
Maritime Museum at the foot of
Polk Street and the Wine
Museum on Beach Street near
Hyde Street.
(>olden (iate Bridge: Probably
the most famous San Francisco
landmark, the bridge joins the
Peninsula with Marin county
and points north. The best view
is from the parking plaza, but if
you want to walk across on foot,
it won't cost you anything.
Golden (iate Park: A surpris
ingly well-kept park in the mid
dle of the city. It covers more
than 1000 acres and extends
from Arguello Boulevard to the
ocean. Filled with bike and bri
dle paths, lakes, meadows and
playfields. Places to visit in
clude the M.H. de Young
Museum, Japanese Tea Garden,
arboretum and Hall of Flowers,
California Academy of Sciences
and Asian Art Museum. Boats
are available for rent at Stow
Lake.
Haight Street: Remember the
good old days of Haight-
Ashbury? This is where it all
started, legend says. It's changed
now, ol course, but you can still
lind interesting stores, people
and atmosphere. Go from I iaight
and Stanyan to Haight and
Masonic.
Hyatt Regency Hotel: Divine
decadence that has to be seen to
be believed. Go up a couple of
floors to the inside courtyard
and gawk at the architecture and
artwork. Dress in something be
sides jeans. California and Mar
ket.
lapantown: An area filled
with Japanese groceries, import
stores, restaurants, newspapers,
temples and shrines. Visit Japan
Center, too, which includes a
Japanese style hotel, restaurants,
manufacturers' showrooms and
a theatre. It is bounded by Geary,
Post Laguna, and Fillmore
Streets.
Nob Hill: An area rich in
beautiful architecture, it used to

be the home of San Francisco's
elite crowd, which included Le
land Sr. Take Sacramento Street
up from Chinatown.
North Beach: Lots of enter
tainment and night life.
Theatres. Italian restaurants,
boutiques, etc. Lots of strip
joints, porno flicks and bars are
centered around Columbus and
Broadway.
Twin Peaks: 410 feet up there,
they offer a great view of every
thing. day or night. Located in
the middle of the City.
Union Square: Lots of high
class shopping in the area. Four
levels of parking are available
under the square, which is
bounded by Post. Stockton.
Geary and Powell Streets.
Though impossible to cover in
this space. Berkeley and the Fast
Bay at least deserve mention.
Dredge back in your memory
to 1968. That was the heyday of
Berkeley, when it was the center
of student unrest and riots over
the war in Vietnam. The major
attraction here now is Telegraph
Street, which may be one of the
last strongholds of the Age of
Aquarius counter-culture.
There is an assortment of head
shops, bookstores and used ev
erything dealers to be found
nowhere else. Take the Bay
Bridge (50 cents on the way
back) and follow the signs. Park
on the Cal campus, if possible.
Addendum: Two or three
things that aren't in the City, but
nearby at any rate. We just
couldn't resist.

North of San Francisco, in the
Napa Valley, is the famous
California wine country. The
good thing ahout having the
wineries so close is that a great
number of them allow you to
tour their facilities. Some charge
a modest admission, hut many
let you sip for free. One warning:
The drinking age in California is
21. Some wineries check closely,
others will admit minors in the
company of adults.
If you have a car and a free
evening, take a drive over the

foothills to Half Moon Bay. This
is post-card California coastline
it there ever was any. complete
with rocky crags and setting sun.
further down the coast are the
resort cities of Monterey and
Carmel. Both have fantastic
beaches and Carmel is gaining a
reputation as the campy, chic
place to be.
All in all. if it's exciting and
different places you want, then
Stanford was probably the right
university for you. Don't miss .1
thing.
