## Palo Alto theaters show classic films 
### Howard Baldwin 
What do you do when you
miss the first run of a movie you
wanted to see? What do you do
when you have the urge to see a
classic like The Hig Slurp or It
//uppened One Night? What do
you do when foreign films strike
your fancy?
The answer is simple — truck
to downtown Palo Alto, where
the Festival Ginema on I lamilton
Avenue and the New Varsity
Theater on University Avenue
run movies you may either have
missed or fondly remember.
Theaters like this are not un
usual — the Mountain View
Theater shows third-run films,
tht! Vitaphone in Saratoga runs
( lassies and there are many in
San Francisco. What is unusual
is that they both sprouted here in
Palo Alto within one block of
each other.
The Festival Ginema is a little
more than two years old. It re
placed the Academy Ginema,
which opened and closed in a
relatively short time, starved,
according to Festival co-owner
I .arry Rockwell, on a diet of mus
icals. The theater was renovated,
sloped for better visibility and
reopened with the new name
under the management of
Rockwell and Jerome Gary.
Classic Movies
"The intention was to basi
cally show classic movies." says
Rockwell. "It's something that
I've had experience with in New
York City. I've worked for vari
ous film distributors and I really
love film, and I love the history
of film. And I don't particularly
like modern new first-run films
with a few notable exceptions,
and it seemed to me that there's a
market in this area."
"As far as I knew at that point,
nobody had tried it before. And 1
knew enough people around

here that liked movies to think
that there were probably
more . . . (people) who would be
more willing to spend their
money seeing something that
they knew than to go out and
spend three dollars to see some
thing they didn't know." So
Rockwell's hobby began to dou
ble as a career.
The office at the Festival is
crammed into a corner behind
the candy counter, surrounded
by a library of film books. It is
overseen by a parrot named
Jo-Jo, who supplies inspiration.
The walls are covered with post
ers and stills.
The New Varsity Theater and
Restaurant, on the other hand,
more closely resembles your
run-of-the-mill theater, if you
ignore the restaurant tables and
directors' chairs, each with a
star's name on it.
Wide Variety
The New Varsity operates
under the management of Tom
and Bev Corbin and Glenn and
Judith Lutge.
The New Varsity shows a
widevariet> of movies — foreign
films, classics, "cult" films.
There is a very good chance that
something you've missed will
turn 11 p at the New Varsity —
anything from Day For Night to
Cuba rut to Fellini's Homo.
Glover attributes thequality in
the theater's program to the time
the Corbins and the Lutges
spend constructing their format,
as well as their booker's ability to
follow through with movies that
complement each other (exam
ple: Dr. Strangelo\e and Little
Murders, black humor deluxe).
The New Varsity has an easier
time pairing its features because
it has .'*s mm projectors, and 35
mm features are generally avail
able. The Festival, according to
employee Alan Ligda. has a
more difficult time because it is
only equipped with lfi mm pro
jectors. Getting the movies they

want when thev want them is
their biggest problem.
Mixed Lot
Distributors ol Hi mm films
often want 35 pf»rt ent of the
gross (and ii both do. that's 70
percent, a situation that quickly
ceases to be profitable) and to
have a double feature of their
movies. United Artists, tor
example, will not be thrilled to
send a picture that will be billed
with a feature from Paramount.
Who patronizes these theat
ers? Ligda says. "You get sort of
a mixed lot — we yet a lot of
college students, we get a lot of
what we euphemistically call

senior citizens, we get a lot of
kids, depending on what we
show. Like we showed the origi
nal Murk of Zurm. with Douglas
Fairbanks — we had so many
kids in there you wouldn't have
believed it. a lot of them accom
panied by their parents or their
grandparents."
Lynn Glover recognizes many
New Varsity customers as regu
lar patrons. "The clientele in this
theater is a lot better than when it
was a commercial theater ... I
don't know what the difference
is. but they're a much nicer
clientele. They like this idea —
this is new to them — so they

open up and they like it." she
says.
Economy is one big attraction
of these theaters: the $2.50 ad
mission prices ($2 on week
nights at the Festival) are con
siderably less than what you'd
pay to see a brand-new release.
The New Varsity has an addi
tional magnet called the Varsity
dollar, given with each admis
sion and worth a dollar on the
next visit.
Cultural Center
Although it may seem unusual
that these theaters should appear
in Palo Alto, rather than on other
cities on the Peninsula,
Rockwell offers an explanation:
"1 think there are a lot of aspects
involved. One is the area has a
higher-tban-average income,
and concurrent to that, or .is a
result of that, a higher-than
average intelligence or educa
tional level. That derives in part
from Stanford and in part from
the types of industry that have
somehow gravitated to this area
— electronics, aerospace and so
on ... I think the fact that Stan
ford is here makes Palo Alto a
certain cultural center, whether
it wants to be or not."
Alan I.igda voices similar
opinions, believing that after 70
years Palo Alto is finally coming
alive as a city, rather than a sub
urb.
There are very few stars, direc
tors or movies that can be
counted on to definitely draw
customers. Katharine Hepburn.
Humphrey Bogart and the Marx
Brothers do very well at the Fes
tival, but sodoOrson Welles and
Francois Truffaut.
At the New Varsity, says
Glover. Federico Fellini does
well. She also contends that ev
erything does well because of
their condensed screening
periods of days instead of a week
like the Festival. This tends to
draw the people in. because if
they put off seeing the movie, it's
gone.

SHOWING THE CLASSICS — Two theatres in Palo Alto show
classic films from years past. Prices are reasonable, and it beats
the tube by far.
