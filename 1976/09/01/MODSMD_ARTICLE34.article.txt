# Sunday Flicks

### Howard Baldwin 
Now that you're here, you
should know of our traditions.
One as time-honored as the
Academy Awards is the Sunday
Night Flicks, sponsored by
ASSU. This ritual has occurred
every Sunday since 1937 (except
for some World War 11 years),
making it as old as Robert Red
lord. Stanford students, along
with an assortment of Palo Alto
high school students, go into
Memorial Auditorium, across
from Hoover Tower, and pretend
to watch the movie.
Often it is no more than an ex
cuse to leave one's studying for a
few hours, and it always re
freshes. making one ready to re
turn to the books — or Frankie,
Johnny, and l.uigi's. Too Pizza
Parlor, depending on how infec
tious the atmosphere is and who
you run into.
The Flicks, as they are affec
tionately referred to. were the
brainchild of Oley kil
lingsworth, who still works here
as the communications super
visor in the Plant Services De
partment. He remembers some
very interesting facts about the
lirst years of the Flicks, which
should raise some eyebrows,
even among seniors.
Did you know . . that the
Flicks were originally shown in
the History Corner for a dime?
They are now 75 cents.
. . . that when enough money
had been collected for the rental
of the quarter's films, admission
wasn't charged?
. . . that there wasn't the
choice or variety that we have
now? In the so-called 'good old
days,' there were many repeats
of the films which were easiest to
get, as well as serials. Those
were the days of block-booking,
when if an organization rented
one Paramount film, it rented
only Paramount films. Thus
manv independent films were

shown, according to Kil
lingsworth
Difficulties
There were often difficulties
with the Fox Theatre in
downtown Palo Alto (which the
Flicks have outlived). The man
agers detested the thought of lost
revenue — after all. the Flicks
were 15 cents less than the Fox
in those days. They made it im
possible for ASSU to get a film
unless a certain period of time
had elapsed since its engage
ment at the Fox.
Today, however, we have any
thing and everything we want —
almost. On Dec. 9. 1973. X-rated
Behind The Green Door was the
scheduled film. Someone in the
Santa Clara County District At
torney's office frowned on the
idea of pure Stanford students
being subjected to such filthy
and immoral degradation up
there on the screen and
threatened to arrest the projec
tionist and confiscate the film.
The film was one of the 10
most popular on a survey list of
45 films, and the Flicks manager
at that time. Hob Sisson, said he
"would like to show the film just
because of the great demand for
it. But I'll be in finals that week
and 1 don't want to be a test
case."
So, instead of fighting legal
battles, Sisson replaced the con
troversial film with lui sy Hi dor.
Most of the time, though, the
dramatics are on the screen.
Nevertheless,"something hap
pens to 1500 people left to their
own devices for two hours in the
dark. A mysterious spell enters
and overcomes.
