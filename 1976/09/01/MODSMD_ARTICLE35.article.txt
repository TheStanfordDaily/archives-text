The Stanford community is
served by a number of student
run and student-affiliated publi
cations. Many involve minority
or special-interest groups and all
the publications will welcome
new staffers this year. Since
editors of most publications
have changed over the summer,
some details are unavailable.
More information on individual
publications can be obtained
from Jeffrey Stoler. chairman of
the Publications Board. Stoler
can be reached at the Publica
tions Hoard office, second floor
Tresidder.
The Arena, a newspaper pub
lished in affiliation with the
(Conservative Student Union,
carries news analysis, opinions
and political features. Its found
ers perceived the need for a con
servative voice iti the Stanford
community and began the paper
as an alternative to the Daily.
There is no regular publica
tion schedule of the Arena, but it
is generally published twice
during each quarter, under the
editorship of Bill McDougall.
The Chaparral is the official
publication of the Hammer &
Coffin Society, an organization

which was established in 1906,
just before the major earthquake
which destroyed much of the
Stanford campus. (Hammer &
Coffin Society members regard
this as a particularly significant
historical "coincidence.")
The Chaparral publishes
humorous articles, cartoons and
satire. Since its staff does all of
their own paste-up and composi
tion, the Chappie can always use
artists or persons interested in
publication design. In addition,
the Chappie needs business staf
fers and ad salesmen.
Those who are interested in
writing for the Chaparral or in
working on the business staff
should contact Barry Parr or Pat
Hall at the Chaparral offices, lo
cated on the second floor of the
Storke Publications Building
(the Friendly Whist Club).
The Stanford chicano com
munity has several publications.
Imagenes de la Chicana is a
woman's literary journal. It pub
lishes poems, short stories, polit
ical analysis and features about
chicana women.
Atisbos is the only chicano re
search journal published in the
United States. It publishes full
length research papers on
chicano topics.

La Onda is the monthly news
letter published by the Chicano
Fellows Program. It carries fea
ture stories and information on
chicano community events.
Persons interested in these
publications should contact
Cecilia Burciaga in Bldg. 1.
> The ASSU Course Cuide
publishes reviews of
many University courses. Stu
dents are asked to evaluate their
courses on a standardized ASSU
form at the end of each quarter.
The results of the surveys are
tabulated and compiled in
newspaper form.
The Course Guide asks stu
dent volunteers to conduct the
surveys, which means distribut
ing questionnaires to classes
near the end of the quarter. It also
welcomes business and ad staff
and persons interested in layout
and design.
For information about the
Course Guide, contact Greg Lar
son in the ASSU offices, second
floor Tresidder.
The Stanford Daily, the most
widely-circulated student
newspaper on campus, is pub
lished Monday through Friday
each week during the academic
year, with the exceptions of dead
week, finals week and vacations.
The Daily can always use
writers, photographers and
people interested in learning
about the workings of a news
paper. No experience in writing
or interviewing is needed for
those students interested in re
porting. There are also oppor
tunities to write a regular col
umn for the opinions page and
in-depth features. A meeting for
all interested, would-be Woods
teins will be held early in the
quarter.
the Quad is the Stanford
yearbook. Publishing a year
book, especially at a school of
Stanford's size, is no easy task,
so the Quad can always use new
staffers. If you enjoy doing lay
out, photography, artwork or
graphics, the Quad can use your
skills.
The Quad also has an exten

sive advertisement section.
Editors for the coming year are
Katie Bowen and Marie Shih.
The Real News is published
by the black community of Stan
ford and Palo Alto. It publishes
political analysis, news and fea
tures stories and an occasional
poem.
The main purpose of the Real
News is to provide members of
the black community with an al
ternative news service. Persons
interested in the paper should
contact Keith Archuleta at
Ujamaa House.
One new publication is
scheduled to begin this year. It
will be called the Weekly and
will carry news analysis and in
depth feature stories. Ad staff
workers are needed. Interested
persons should contact Charlie
Hall through the Publications
Board office in Tresidder Union.
Stanford has been blessed
with its very own radio station.
KZSIJ which is staffed and
funded by the student body.
KZSLJ's studios are located in
the basement of Memorial Au
ditorium, amidst the catacombs
beneath the Little Theatre. "The
"Zoo." as it is known by staffers,
broadcasts at all hours around
the clock almost seven days a
week.
The station is organized into
several departments, including
programming (dj's). news,
sports, engineering, and music.
The airsound ranges from jazz
through mainline rock and roll
to disco and R& B. depending on
the tastes of the dj. A number of
specialty shows exist, including
imports and new music.
Located at 90.1 on the KM dial,
KZSIJ needs new and interested
people to help out all the time,
especially in the high turnover
departments such as news. If
you're itching to expand your
horizons or join a great gang of
hardworking weirdos, look for
announcements or organiza
tional meetings and/or sign up at
the KZSIJ booth at Maples rlur
ing registration.
