# Needed: make up geography
## 
### Jordan Lorence 
Many students have com
plained that a Stanford educa
tion is not practical; it offers lit
tle more than a prestigious dip
loma and a mountain of debt. To
counter this deficiency, some
individuals have suggested that
the University offer classes to
prepare its wards for the "out
side world." Class suggestions
have ranged from auto
mechanics to xylophone repair.
These classes might be benefi
cial for the Stanford masses. If
these "practical" classes are in
stituted, the first one should
teach geography to native
Californians. One can always tell
a native Californian by his ina
bility to name or describe any
thing in that amorphous void
east of Lake Tahoe.
The class would be called,
"Remedial Geography for Native
Californians." and would be re
quired for all the indigenous de
nizens of Beach Hoy Land. I his
class would try to sort out the
various components that consti
tute the term "hack East." As an
innovative first here, this class
will offer neither a Marxist nor a
feminist perspective.
Some of you might be uncon
vinced that such a class is
needed. Let me prove my case.
I'm from Minnesota. Ask a 11011-
Californian what he knows
about Minnesota and you will
get an answer like this:
"Minnesota, the 32nd state,
was admitted to the Union in
IHSB. The state is bordered by
Wisconsin. North and South

Dakota, lowa, Canada and Lake
Superior. The state population is
3,917,000 and the capital is St.
Paul. The state contains 1"> -41
lakes and is home to the M.ivo
Clinic. Tonka Toys. Hubert
Humphrey and John Dei \ e-
If you ask a native Californian
what heknowsabout Minnesota,
you will get a variety of answers:
"Minnesota is cold."
"Minnesota is part of
Canada."
"Minnesota is by New York"
(the 14th colony?).
"Minnesota is where Mary
Tyler Moore lives."
"Minnesota?"
The main purpose of the class
would be to shatter popular
Californian myths about the rest
of the United States. The class
would show that Pensacola is
not a Florida soft drink, that
Cheyenne is not a bashful lass
from the Rockies, that Michigan
is not a French tire company and
that Vermont is not a martini in
gredient.
The biggest practice of
Californians hoped to be cor
rected by this innovative class
will be to stop the prostitution of
the term "East." Referring to ev
erything from Nevada to Dela
ware as "back East" is an unfor
givable sin to most non-
Californians.
If Stanford pioneers this class,
educators all over California, yes
even all over the world, will
marvel at the University's in
novative trailblazing in practical
education. This class might very
well put Stanford on the map.
