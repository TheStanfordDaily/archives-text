# Bay Area Rock
## 
### Bruce Turner 
The Bay Area music scene is
divided into two spheres of in
fluence. On one hand, the big
groups that tour the country are
handled almost exclusively by
Bill Graham and his cohorts. The
other area of musical outlet in
volves small clubs and local
bands.
The communication between
Bill Graham's forces and the
general public is limited almost
totally to the pink section in the
Sunday edition of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle and to signs
posted in the Bay Area Seating
Service (BASS) ticket outlets.

Needless to say. this is one of the
more troublesome drawbacks in
getting to see your favorite
groups, because almost invari
ably the best seats are long gone
by the time you even hear about
the upcoming concert.
Bill Graham schedules his
concerts in several different
arenas, depending on how much
money he feels like making. The
largest of these is the Oakland
Stddium, home of the A's. which
is the scene of the infamous "Day
on the Green" concerts. These
consist mostly of getting sun
burned. waiting endlessly and
the standard "close-knit atmos

phere" of general admission sea
ting.
Also in Oakland is the Oak
land Coliseum, the basketball
arena, which has slightly better
acoustics than the stadium and
is smaller, but is still a has
sle . . . unless you can assemble
a group of friends with a car to
make the trip.
Earsplitting rock
In San Jose, the Civic Au
ditorium is the site of radio sta
tion KOME (with help from
Graham) concerts, usually of the
raunch and/or earsplitting rock
variety. If you're a fan there's not
much wrong with the place, and

it's closer. Also in San )ose is San
lose State's Spartan Stadium,
which is used very sparingly,
one or two concerts a year. SJSU
usually gets a good line-up of
groups and is independent of
Graham and his usual misman
agement.
The only other major-group
attracting places that are not as
sociated with Bill Graham are
the Concord Pavilion in Con
cord and Stanford's ASSI! Spe
cial Events. Concord is a beauti
ful new facility with an open air
stage covered by a huge roof that
is not at all obtrusive. It has seat
ing for 3000 and general admis
sion gets you onto the hillside
lawn that surrounds the covered
area. The Concord people
schedule all manner of musical
artists into the place, ranging
from week-long classical music
festivals to single events with
some of rock and roll's bigger
stars and bands.
Stanford has perhaps the best
facilities of any single organiza
tion in the Bay Area, including
Graham. The most beautiful and
mellow of these is Frost Am
phitheatre, which fits so well
with the surrounding terrain
that simply driving by gives no
indication of its 10,000-plus sea
ting capacity. Frost is used
mostly in thesummerand spring
and the ASSU is reluctant to take
full advantage of it for fear of
ruining the Peninsula's most
beautiful concert site.
Even without Frost the ASSU
can still provide students and
visitors with good music year
round. Classical concerts are
given quite often in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, with solo artists
and small groups appearing in
the Tresidder lounge.
Campus sites
For intimate evenings with
rock performers and comedy
acts (like Firesign Theatre),
Memorial Auditorium is an ex
cellent place with incredible
acoustics.
Maples Pavilion, home of Dick
Dißiaso's cage team, has also
seen some excellent groups
come and go. although the
crowd control there is always
one of the night's bigger
headaches. The acoustics are not
very good, but magic things do
tend to happen. As an example,
Neil Young wandered onstage in
the middle of Stephen Stills's
acoustic set last fall, and ignited
the flame that led to their re
cently released album. The qual
ity of Stanford concerts this year

will depend on how well the
Special Events Director does his
job. Now if we can just get the
Stones to appear at Stanford
Stadium . . .
In the City
Up in San Francisco, Winter
land is Graham's main and most
famous arena. It's located at Post
and Steiner Streets in SF and
seats only 6000, which has led to
its popularity. San Francisco's
other large arena is the Cow
Palace which holds about 10,000
and is located in South SF featur
ing sardine seating (general ad
mission). Almost all the big
groups come there, but you
rarely want to go back unless
you're a fanatic for the group
coming next. Prices for all the
big name groups throughout the
Bay Area range from $5.50 to
$10.00 (outrageous is the word),
with one of the only breaks com
ing at Stanford for its students,
around $4.50.
Also in San Francisco is the
Great American Music Hall, a
small, relatively worthwhile
place that occasionally has
music of interest.
Quality
If ticket prices and big crowds
get you down, you can take sol
ace from the fact that some of the
best music in the Bay Area hap
pens all the time at the small
dance bars all over the place and
in auditoriums at area campuses.
The list of bars is much too long
to print here, other than to men
tion the closest: Sophie's in Palo
Alto has seen in just the last
three months Roger McGuinn,
Chris Hillman and some of the
best unrecorded bands in the
state.
Berkeley has the Community
Theatre, among other places,
and often has good-vibe benefit
concerts. The Keystone in Bizer
keley is probably the most fam
ous of the Bay Area bar and
dance halls.
The place to find out about all
these is usually in free music
magazines and papers such as
BAM (Bay Area Music) which
are distributed at music stores
and campuses. If you're a music
devotee or just really care about
where you sit and what you see,
it takes a lot of vigilance and a
sharp eye to pick out those
places that will showcase the
"gems." But you've got to admit
that some people may be right in
saying that the Bay Area is the
music capital of the world. At
any rate, it certainly is better
than Sacramento.

these is usually in free music

it takes a lot of vigilance and a

CROSBY AND NASH — David Crosby and Graham Nash were featured in a Ampitheater
concert this summer.
The Bay Area music scene is
divided into two spheres of in
fluence. On one hand, the big
groups that tour the country are
handled almost exclusively by
Bill Graham and his cohorts. The
other area of musical outlet in
volves small clubs and local
bands.
The communication between
Bill Graham's forces and the
general public is limited almost
totally to the pink section in the
Sunday edition of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle and to signs
posted in the Bay Area Seating
Service (BASS) ticket outlets.

Needless to say. this is one of the
more troublesome drawbacks in
getting to see your favorite
groups, because almost invari
ably the best seats are long gone
by the time you even hear about
the upcoming concert.
Bill Graham schedules his
concerts in several different
arenas, depending on how much
money he feels like making. The
largest of these is the Oakland
Stddium, home of the A's. which
is the scene of the infamous "Day
on the Green" concerts. These
consist mostly of getting sun
burned. waiting endlessly and
the standard "close-knit atmos

phere" of general admission sea
ting.
Also in Oakland is the Oak
land Coliseum, the basketball
arena, which has slightly better
acoustics than the stadium and
is smaller, but is still a has
sle . . . unless you can assemble
a group of friends with a car to
make the trip.
Earsplitting rock
In San Jose, the Civic Au
ditorium is the site of radio sta
tion KOME (with help from
Graham) concerts, usually of the
raunch and/or earsplitting rock
variety. If you're a fan there's not
much wrong with the place, and

it's closer. Also in San )ose is San
lose State's Spartan Stadium,
which is used very sparingly,
one or two concerts a year. SJSU
usually gets a good line-up of
groups and is independent of
Graham and his usual misman
agement.
The only other major-group
attracting places that are not as
sociated with Bill Graham are
the Concord Pavilion in Con
cord and Stanford's ASSI! Spe
cial Events. Concord is a beauti
ful new facility with an open air
stage covered by a huge roof that
is not at all obtrusive. It has seat
ing for 3000 and general admis
sion gets you onto the hillside
lawn that surrounds the covered
area. The Concord people
schedule all manner of musical
artists into the place, ranging
from week-long classical music
festivals to single events with
some of rock and roll's bigger
stars and bands.
Stanford has perhaps the best
facilities of any single organiza
tion in the Bay Area, including
Graham. The most beautiful and
mellow of these is Frost Am
phitheatre, which fits so well
with the surrounding terrain
that simply driving by gives no
indication of its 10,000-plus sea
ting capacity. Frost is used
mostly in thesummerand spring
and the ASSU is reluctant to take
full advantage of it for fear of
ruining the Peninsula's most
beautiful concert site.
Even without Frost the ASSU
can still provide students and
visitors with good music year
round. Classical concerts are
given quite often in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, with solo artists
and small groups appearing in
the Tresidder lounge.
Campus sites
For intimate evenings with
rock performers and comedy
acts (like Firesign Theatre),
Memorial Auditorium is an ex
cellent place with incredible
acoustics.
Maples Pavilion, home of Dick
Dißiaso's cage team, has also
seen some excellent groups
come and go. although the
crowd control there is always
one of the night's bigger
headaches. The acoustics are not
very good, but magic things do
tend to happen. As an example,
Neil Young wandered onstage in
the middle of Stephen Stills's
acoustic set last fall, and ignited
the flame that led to their re
cently released album. The qual
ity of Stanford concerts this year

will depend on how well the
Special Events Director does his
job. Now if we can just get the
Stones to appear at Stanford
Stadium . . .
In the City
Up in San Francisco, Winter
land is Graham's main and most
famous arena. It's located at Post
and Steiner Streets in SF and
seats only 6000, which has led to
its popularity. San Francisco's
other large arena is the Cow
Palace which holds about 10,000
and is located in South SF featur
ing sardine seating (general ad
mission). Almost all the big
groups come there, but you
rarely want to go back unless
you're a fanatic for the group
coming next. Prices for all the
big name groups throughout the
Bay Area range from $5.50 to
$10.00 (outrageous is the word),
with one of the only breaks com
ing at Stanford for its students,
around $4.50.
Also in San Francisco is the
Great American Music Hall, a
small, relatively worthwhile
place that occasionally has
music of interest.
Quality
If ticket prices and big crowds
get you down, you can take sol
ace from the fact that some of the
best music in the Bay Area hap
pens all the time at the small
dance bars all over the place and
in auditoriums at area campuses.
The list of bars is much too long
to print here, other than to men
tion the closest: Sophie's in Palo
Alto has seen in just the last
three months Roger McGuinn,
Chris Hillman and some of the
best unrecorded bands in the
state.
Berkeley has the Community

and often has good-vibe benefit

groups come there, but you
rarely want to go back unless
you're a fanatic for the group
coming next. Prices for all the
big name groups throughout the
Bay Area range from $5.50 to
$10.00 (outrageous is the word),
with one of the only breaks com
ing at Stanford for its students,
around $4.50.
Also in San Francisco is the
Great American Music Hall, a
small, relatively worthwhile
place that occasionally has
music of interest.

If ticket prices and big crowds
get you down, you can take sol
ace from the fact that some of the
best music in the Bay Area hap
pens all the time at the small
dance bars all over the place and
in auditoriums at area campuses.
The list of bars is much too long
to print here, other than to men
tion the closest: Sophie's in Palo
Alto has seen in just the last
three months Roger McGuinn,
Chris Hillman and some of the
best unrecorded bands in the
state.
Berkeley has the Community
Theatre, among other places,
and often has good-vibe benefit
concerts. The Keystone in Bizer
keley is probably the most fam
ous of the Bay Area bar and
dance halls.
The place to find out about all
these is usually in free music
magazines and papers such as
BAM (Bay Area Music) which
are distributed at music stores
and campuses. If you're a music
devotee or just really care about
where you sit and what you see,
it takes a lot of vigilance and a
sharp eye to pick out those
places that will showcase the
"gems." But you've got to admit
that some people may be right in
saying that the Bay Area is the
music capital of the world. At
any rate, it certainly is better
than Sacramento.

CROSBY AND NASH — David Crosby and Graham Nash were featured in a Ampitheater
concert this summer.
The Bay Area music scene is
divided into two spheres of in
fluence. On one hand, the big
groups that tour the country are
handled almost exclusively by
Bill Graham and his cohorts. The
other area of musical outlet in
volves small clubs and local
bands.
The communication between
Bill Graham's forces and the
general public is limited almost
totally to the pink section in the
Sunday edition of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle and to signs
posted in the Bay Area Seating
Service (BASS) ticket outlets.

Needless to say. this is one of the
more troublesome drawbacks in
getting to see your favorite
groups, because almost invari
ably the best seats are long gone
by the time you even hear about
the upcoming concert.
Bill Graham schedules his
concerts in several different
arenas, depending on how much
money he feels like making. The
largest of these is the Oakland
Stddium, home of the A's. which
is the scene of the infamous "Day
on the Green" concerts. These
consist mostly of getting sun
burned. waiting endlessly and
the standard "close-knit atmos

phere" of general admission sea
ting.
Also in Oakland is the Oak
land Coliseum, the basketball
arena, which has slightly better
acoustics than the stadium and
is smaller, but is still a has
sle . . . unless you can assemble
a group of friends with a car to
make the trip.
Earsplitting rock
In San Jose, the Civic Au
ditorium is the site of radio sta
tion KOME (with help from
Graham) concerts, usually of the
raunch and/or earsplitting rock
variety. If you're a fan there's not
much wrong with the place, and

it's closer. Also in San )ose is San
lose State's Spartan Stadium,
which is used very sparingly,
one or two concerts a year. SJSU
usually gets a good line-up of
groups and is independent of
Graham and his usual misman
agement.
The only other major-group
attracting places that are not as
sociated with Bill Graham are
the Concord Pavilion in Con
cord and Stanford's ASSI! Spe
cial Events. Concord is a beauti
ful new facility with an open air
stage covered by a huge roof that
is not at all obtrusive. It has seat
ing for 3000 and general admis
sion gets you onto the hillside
lawn that surrounds the covered
area. The Concord people
schedule all manner of musical
artists into the place, ranging
from week-long classical music
festivals to single events with
some of rock and roll's bigger
stars and bands.
Stanford has perhaps the best
facilities of any single organiza
tion in the Bay Area, including
Graham. The most beautiful and
mellow of these is Frost Am
phitheatre, which fits so well
with the surrounding terrain
that simply driving by gives no
indication of its 10,000-plus sea
ting capacity. Frost is used
mostly in thesummerand spring
and the ASSU is reluctant to take
full advantage of it for fear of
ruining the Peninsula's most
beautiful concert site.
Even without Frost the ASSU
can still provide students and
visitors with good music year
round. Classical concerts are
given quite often in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, with solo artists
and small groups appearing in
the Tresidder lounge.
Campus sites
For intimate evenings with
rock performers and comedy
acts (like Firesign Theatre),
Memorial Auditorium is an ex
cellent place with incredible
acoustics.
Maples Pavilion, home of Dick
Dißiaso's cage team, has also
seen some excellent groups
come and go. although the
crowd control there is always
one of the night's bigger
headaches. The acoustics are not
very good, but magic things do
tend to happen. As an example,
Neil Young wandered onstage in
the middle of Stephen Stills's
acoustic set last fall, and ignited
the flame that led to their re
cently released album. The qual
ity of Stanford concerts this year

will depend on how well the
Special Events Director does his
job. Now if we can just get the
Stones to appear at Stanford
Stadium . . .
In the City
Up in San Francisco, Winter
land is Graham's main and most
famous arena. It's located at Post
and Steiner Streets in SF and
seats only 6000, which has led to
its popularity. San Francisco's
other large arena is the Cow
Palace which holds about 10,000
and is located in South SF featur
ing sardine seating (general ad
mission). Almost all the big
groups come there, but you
rarely want to go back unless
you're a fanatic for the group
coming next. Prices for all the
big name groups throughout the
