## Earthquake: campus damage 
### J. Kelly Button 
STANFOHD - At least 150
students were killed and 500 in
jured in the catastrophic ear
thquake that struck the Stanford
campus yesterday, April 1H -70
years to the day after the disus
ferous 1906 tremor. Damage ivas
extensile hut school officials
hope to reopen classes in the
fall. . . .
Will we be reading that story
next week? Next year? Or never?
Living, studying and building
in an earthquake-prone area
naturally leads to speculation
about the effects of an ear
thquake on Stanford. Unfortu
nately. it is just that — specula
tion — because of the uncer
tainty of earthquake and ear
thquake damage prediction.
One thing that is predictable is
that a major quake will hit Stan
ford — eventually. According to
Asst. Geophysics Prof. David
Boore. however, there is "not a
great chance" that tin; quake will
be in the near future.
Boore said that the San An
dreas Fault, which passes within
a couple miles of campus, is "es
sentially locked" so that when
the quake occurs, the movement
and force released will be mas

sive. Boore foresees a tremor of
equal or greater magnitude than
the '06 quake — 8.3 on the Rich
ter scale. A quake of that size
would, in turn, cause lateral —
side-to-side — forces on Stan
ford buildings of five- to six
tenths the force of gravity (g).
The present California Building
Code is designed to withstand
approximately one-tenth g with
little or no damage.
Another possibility is a quake
emanating from the Hay ward or
Calaveras faults on the east side
of the Bay. A quake there would
probably exert forces of about
two-tenths g on the buildings
here. Boore said the chances of a
quake from those faults were
"slightlv butter" than from the
San Andreas.
When the quake finally comes,
what kind of damage to Univer
sity buildings is expected'!* Gene
Kershner of the Planning Office
said that "Stanford will fare no
worse than anywhere else." But
what exactly does that mean?
Again, there is a problem with
predicting earthquake effects.
"Prediction is an art. not a sci
ence," said Civil Engineering
Prof. Haresh Shah. A lot of as
sumptions have to be made and

actual predictions can be wildly
divergent. Everyone agrees,
though, that there will be exten
sive damage in a major (8.0-8.5
Richter) quake.
In 1965. Civil Engineering
Prof. James Wells conducted a
University-wide survey on the
possible monetary damages
from a 1906-type quake. Meant
to investigate the adequacy of
the University's earthquake in
surance. the report predicted a
10 percent loss in strictly monet
ary terms. That figure masks dif
ferences in possible damage
among the buildings, however,
and is somewhat deceptive in
terms of physical damage. Also,
according to Shah. Wells' fi
gures could be off by "a factor of
three." meaning 10 percent
could just as easily be 30 per
cent.
Still, the Wells report is use
ful. according to Kershner. in
prioritizing reconstruction of
older buildings. Thus, those
buildings classified as sustain
ing 20 to 40 percent possible
damage are higher on repair lists
than those listed at five to 10
percent.
Another, later, Wells report
(1069), although less extensive,
also lists high-risk buildings.
Seven structures were men
tioned in that report, only one of
which has since been renovated.
History problem
The Wells report and Shah
both focused attention on the

older buildings on campus as the
most dangerous, especially as
causes of possible fatalities.
Three corners of the outer Quad
seriously damaged in the 1906,
quake — History. Fngineering
and Geology — were major con
cerns.
(The fourth corner. Math, has
been extensively rebuilt, with
what Kershner terms a "new
building inside the old skin"
and does not pose a major
threat.)
Those three stand a "serious
chance of collapse." said Shah.
History corner has been vacated
for renovation similar to that
done in Math corner. Future
plans are for work on the other
two. also, but no timetable has
been set. Wells lists all three as
subject to 20 percent damage,
with Math at 10 percent.
Inner Quad safe
The inner Ouad is in much
less danger, since most of the
buildings are lower and already
reinforced. Wells forsaw eight to
10 percent damage to most of
those buildings and archways —
one major casualty in the 190H
quake and since greatly
strengthened. The one exception
was the arcade in front of Memo
rial Church, listed at 40 percent.
Kershner said future plans are to
reinforce that arcade.
Wells and Shah disagreed
somewhat over the safety of the
older dorms on campus. Shah

Wells and Shah disagreed

older dorms on campus. Shah
said that he believed dorms such
as Tovon. Branner. Ruble and
Lagunita would be in danger of
collapse. This, he said, was one
of the greatest life-endangering
problems on campus. Wells
listed all four at 10 percent, but
Shah said that even 10 percent
damage would pose serious pos
sibilities of major fatalities. ker
shner's opinion was that all the
dorms, including the four oldest,
were of high structural integrity
and had little chance of collapse
or fatalities.
Shah stated that besides the
problem in tin; four dorms, the
major threat of fatalities in .in
earthquake came from falling ob
jects. He said that the adage in
civil engineering circles is
"never walk near a building at
Stanford."
In his mind, the greatest
threats were the tile roofs and

"non-load-carrying" architec
tural pieces used for aesthetic
value. The latter include con
crete overhangs at the Mitchell
building and the glass-and
concrete walls at Meyer Library.
As to the tile roofs, kershner
and Robert Beth, director of risk
management, both stated that
many, although not all. the
buildings had each tile indi
vidually wired down. Kershner
stated that on all the buildings
repaired during his 18 years at
Stanford the tiles had been
wired, hut no one on campus
knows exactly what buildings
haven't been done.
Students who had been up the
tire escape on History corner or
on the roof at Toyon stated that
in neither of those buildings
were the tiles all secured. Ker
shner confirmed that possibility,
saying that neither had been
worked on recently.

reinforced. Wells forsaw eight to
10 percent damage to most of
those buildings and archways —
one major casualty in the 190H
quake and since greatly
strengthened. The one exception
was the arcade in front of Memo
rial Church, listed at 40 percent.
Kershner said future plans are to
reinforce that arcade.
Wells and Shah disagreed
somewhat over the safety of the
older dorms on campus. Shah
said that he believed dorms such
as Tovon. Branner. Ruble and
Lagunita would be in danger of
collapse. This, he said, was one
of the greatest life-endangering
problems on campus. Wells
listed all four at 10 percent, but
Shah said that even 10 percent
damage would pose serious pos
sibilities of major fatalities. ker
shner's opinion was that all the
dorms, including the four oldest,
were of high structural integrity
and had little chance of collapse
or fatalities.
Shah stated that besides the
problem in tin; four dorms, the
major threat of fatalities in .in
earthquake came from falling ob
jects. He said that the adage in
civil engineering circles is
"never walk near a building at
Stanford."
In his mind, the greatest
threats were the tile roofs and

"non-load-carrying" architec
tural pieces used for aesthetic
value. The latter include con
crete overhangs at the Mitchell
building and the glass-and
concrete walls at Meyer Library.
As to the tile roofs, kershner
and Robert Beth, director of risk
management, both stated that
many, although not all. the
buildings had each tile indi
vidually wired down. Kershner
stated that on all the buildings
repaired during his 18 years at
Stanford the tiles had been
wired, hut no one on campus
knows exactly what buildings
haven't been done.
Students who had been up the
tire escape on History corner or
on the roof at Toyon stated that
in neither of those buildings
were the tiles all secured. Ker
shner confirmed that possibility,
saying that neither had been
worked on recently.
STANFOHD - At least 150
students were killed and 500 in
jured in the catastrophic ear
thquake that struck the Stanford
campus yesterday, April 1H -70
years to the day after the disus
ferous 1906 tremor. Damage ivas
extensile hut school officials
hope to reopen classes in the
fall. . . .
Will we be reading that story
next week? Next year? Or never?
Living, studying and building
in an earthquake-prone area
naturally leads to speculation
about the effects of an ear
thquake on Stanford. Unfortu
nately. it is just that — specula
tion — because of the uncer
tainty of earthquake and ear
thquake damage prediction.
One thing that is predictable is
that a major quake will hit Stan
ford — eventually. According to
Asst. Geophysics Prof. David
Boore. however, there is "not a
great chance" that tin; quake will
be in the near future.
Boore said that the San An
dreas Fault, which passes within
a couple miles of campus, is "es
sentially locked" so that when
the quake occurs, the movement
and force released will be mas

sive. Boore foresees a tremor of
equal or greater magnitude than
the '06 quake — 8.3 on the Rich
ter scale. A quake of that size
would, in turn, cause lateral —
side-to-side — forces on Stan
ford buildings of five- to six
tenths the force of gravity (g).
The present California Building
Code is designed to withstand
approximately one-tenth g with
little or no damage.
Another possibility is a quake
emanating from the Hay ward or
Calaveras faults on the east side
of the Bay. A quake there would
probably exert forces of about
two-tenths g on the buildings
here. Boore said the chances of a
quake from those faults were
"slightlv butter" than from the
San Andreas.
When the quake finally comes,
what kind of damage to Univer
sity buildings is expected'!* Gene
Kershner of the Planning Office
said that "Stanford will fare no
worse than anywhere else." But
what exactly does that mean?
Again, there is a problem with
predicting earthquake effects.
"Prediction is an art. not a sci
ence," said Civil Engineering
Prof. Haresh Shah. A lot of as
sumptions have to be made and

actual predictions can be wildly
divergent. Everyone agrees,
though, that there will be exten
sive damage in a major (8.0-8.5
Richter) quake.
In 1965. Civil Engineering
Prof. James Wells conducted a
University-wide survey on the
possible monetary damages
from a 1906-type quake. Meant
to investigate the adequacy of
the University's earthquake in
surance. the report predicted a
10 percent loss in strictly monet
ary terms. That figure masks dif
ferences in possible damage
among the buildings, however,
and is somewhat deceptive in
terms of physical damage. Also,
according to Shah. Wells' fi
gures could be off by "a factor of
three." meaning 10 percent
could just as easily be 30 per
cent.
Still, the Wells report is use
ful. according to Kershner. in
prioritizing reconstruction of
older buildings. Thus, those
buildings classified as sustain
ing 20 to 40 percent possible
damage are higher on repair lists
than those listed at five to 10
percent.
Another, later, Wells report
(1069), although less extensive,
also lists high-risk buildings.
Seven structures were men
tioned in that report, only one of
which has since been renovated.
History problem
The Wells report and Shah
both focused attention on the

older buildings on campus as the
most dangerous, especially as
causes of possible fatalities.
Three corners of the outer Quad
seriously damaged in the 1906,
quake — History. Fngineering
and Geology — were major con
cerns.
(The fourth corner. Math, has
been extensively rebuilt, with
what Kershner terms a "new
building inside the old skin"
and does not pose a major
threat.)
Those three stand a "serious
chance of collapse." said Shah.
History corner has been vacated
for renovation similar to that
done in Math corner. Future
plans are for work on the other
two. also, but no timetable has
been set. Wells lists all three as
subject to 20 percent damage,
with Math at 10 percent.
Inner Quad safe
The inner Ouad is in much
less danger, since most of the
buildings are lower and already
reinforced. Wells forsaw eight to
10 percent damage to most of
those buildings and archways —

In 1965. Civil Engineering
Prof. James Wells conducted a
University-wide survey on the
possible monetary damages
from a 1906-type quake. Meant
to investigate the adequacy of
the University's earthquake in
surance. the report predicted a
10 percent loss in strictly monet
ary terms. That figure masks dif
ferences in possible damage
among the buildings, however,
and is somewhat deceptive in
terms of physical damage. Also,
according to Shah. Wells' fi
gures could be off by "a factor of
three." meaning 10 percent
could just as easily be 30 per
cent.
Still, the Wells report is use
ful. according to Kershner. in
prioritizing reconstruction of
older buildings. Thus, those
buildings classified as sustain
ing 20 to 40 percent possible
damage are higher on repair lists
than those listed at five to 10
percent.
Another, later, Wells report
(1069), although less extensive,
also lists high-risk buildings.
Seven structures were men
tioned in that report, only one of
which has since been renovated.
History problem
The Wells report and Shah
both focused attention on the

older buildings on campus as the
most dangerous, especially as
causes of possible fatalities.
Three corners of the outer Quad
seriously damaged in the 1906,
quake — History. Fngineering
and Geology — were major con
cerns.
(The fourth corner. Math, has
been extensively rebuilt, with
what Kershner terms a "new
building inside the old skin"
and does not pose a major
threat.)
Those three stand a "serious
chance of collapse." said Shah.
History corner has been vacated
for renovation similar to that
done in Math corner. Future
plans are for work on the other
two. also, but no timetable has
been set. Wells lists all three as
subject to 20 percent damage,
with Math at 10 percent.
Inner Quad safe
The inner Ouad is in much
less danger, since most of the
buildings are lower and already
reinforced. Wells forsaw eight to
10 percent damage to most of
those buildings and archways —
one major casualty in the 190H
quake and since greatly
strengthened. The one exception
was the arcade in front of Memo
rial Church, listed at 40 percent.
Kershner said future plans are to
reinforce that arcade.
Wells and Shah disagreed
somewhat over the safety of the
older dorms on campus. Shah
said that he believed dorms such
as Tovon. Branner. Ruble and
Lagunita would be in danger of
collapse. This, he said, was one
of the greatest life-endangering
problems on campus. Wells
listed all four at 10 percent, but
Shah said that even 10 percent
damage would pose serious pos
sibilities of major fatalities. ker
shner's opinion was that all the
dorms, including the four oldest,
were of high structural integrity
and had little chance of collapse
or fatalities.
Shah stated that besides the
problem in tin; four dorms, the
major threat of fatalities in .in
earthquake came from falling ob
jects. He said that the adage in
civil engineering circles is
"never walk near a building at
Stanford."
In his mind, the greatest
threats were the tile roofs and

"non-load-carrying" architec
tural pieces used for aesthetic
value. The latter include con
crete overhangs at the Mitchell
building and the glass-and
concrete walls at Meyer Library.
As to the tile roofs, kershner
and Robert Beth, director of risk
management, both stated that
many, although not all. the
buildings had each tile indi
vidually wired down. Kershner
stated that on all the buildings
repaired during his 18 years at
Stanford the tiles had been
wired, hut no one on campus
knows exactly what buildings
haven't been done.
Students who had been up the
tire escape on History corner or
on the roof at Toyon stated that
in neither of those buildings
were the tiles all secured. Ker
shner confirmed that possibility,
saying that neither had been
worked on recently.
STANFOHD - At least 150
students were killed and 500 in
jured in the catastrophic ear
thquake that struck the Stanford
campus yesterday, April 1H -70
years to the day after the disus
ferous 1906 tremor. Damage ivas
extensile hut school officials
hope to reopen classes in the
fall. . . .
Will we be reading that story
next week? Next year? Or never?
Living, studying and building
in an earthquake-prone area
naturally leads to speculation
about the effects of an ear
thquake on Stanford. Unfortu
nately. it is just that — specula
tion — because of the uncer
tainty of earthquake and ear
thquake damage prediction.
One thing that is predictable is
that a major quake will hit Stan
ford — eventually. According to
Asst. Geophysics Prof. David
Boore. however, there is "not a
great chance" that tin; quake will
be in the near future.
Boore said that the San An
dreas Fault, which passes within
a couple miles of campus, is "es
sentially locked" so that when
the quake occurs, the movement
and force released will be mas

sive. Boore foresees a tremor of
equal or greater magnitude than
the '06 quake — 8.3 on the Rich
ter scale. A quake of that size
would, in turn, cause lateral —
side-to-side — forces on Stan
ford buildings of five- to six
tenths the force of gravity (g).
The present California Building
Code is designed to withstand
approximately one-tenth g with
little or no damage.
Another possibility is a quake
emanating from the Hay ward or
Calaveras faults on the east side
of the Bay. A quake there would
probably exert forces of about
two-tenths g on the buildings
here. Boore said the chances of a
quake from those faults were
"slightlv butter" than from the
San Andreas.
When the quake finally comes,
what kind of damage to Univer
sity buildings is expected'!* Gene
Kershner of the Planning Office
said that "Stanford will fare no
worse than anywhere else." But
what exactly does that mean?
Again, there is a problem with
predicting earthquake effects.
"Prediction is an art. not a sci
ence," said Civil Engineering
Prof. Haresh Shah. A lot of as
sumptions have to be made and

actual predictions can be wildly
divergent. Everyone agrees,
though, that there will be exten
sive damage in a major (8.0-8.5
Richter) quake.
