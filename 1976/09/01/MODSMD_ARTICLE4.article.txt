## Stanford: A family affair 
### Mary Ingersoll 
Lpland Stanford Junior Unive
rsity was founded out of a very
simple but intense love and
memory of a mother and father
for their son, but its ideals were
so broad as to include the educa
tion of all children and tht; desire
to teach people to do something
useful with their lives.
I,eland Stanford was born in
1 Ml! 4 in Waterliet. New York. He
never received the university
education that was to mean so
much to him for others in the
founding of his university. In
stead, he was educated at coun
try schools and later apprenticed
himself to a law firm in Albany,
lie was admitted to the New
York and Wisconsin bars.
Ilis future wife. Jane Lathrop,
was born in Albany, New York,
in 1828. She was the daughter of
moderately well-to-do parents,
and received the normal private
school education that was fitting
for girls of her day.
The Stanfords were married in
1850. In 1852, Leland went alone
to San Francisco to begin his

business ventures. Jane stayed
behind in New York until 1855
to cure tor her ailing father, to
vyhom she was very close.
Settled in California
The Stanfords then moved to
Wisconsin, where they lived
until <i tragic fire destroyed Le
land's law library. To start a new
lite, they moved to Sacramento
via Nicaragua in 1856; I,eland's
father had told them that Califor
nia was the place to he.
In Sacramento, heland purch
ased his brothers' store, and then
began his political life. In 1858.
he helped to organize Sacramen
to's Republican party. Four years
later, he was chosen as a delegate
to the Chicago convention,
where he supported Lincoln.
Stanford gradually became
more of a political influence with
his election in 1881 as governor
of C California. As former Stanford
student, and later president. Kay
bvman Wilbur writes in his
memoirs, "as governor of
(California he had led in tin; bat
tle to keep California in the
I 'nion against those who wanted
it to follow the South or to set it
up as a separate republic." In
1885. he was to be elected to the
I 'nited States Senate.
Stanford museum docent and
i hairman of the Stanford Family
Portfolio Peg Haneberg says that
I .eland was a pacifist.
Arbitrator
"He believed that the standing
armies of Furope were a waste of
time and manpower." she says.
"Me believed that disputes

should be settled by arbitration."
The same year, 1861, Stanford
and three other men formed the
Central Pacific Railroad, of
which he later was elected pres
ident. Later, a series of compli
cated mergers consolidated sev
eral railroads into the Central
Pacific System.
Ralph Hansen, chief librarian
at tht; University libraries, says
that Leland and his three as
sociates'were known as the "big
four."
"He has been characterized by
some historians as a robber ba
ron." he adds. "If he was really
so despicable he wouldn't have
been liked so much by his
employees."
At first the railroad was consi
dered to be a risky financial ven
ture. but it later proved to be a
most lucrative investment, as it
was later to help support the
University. To celebrate the first
transcontinental line, Leland
drove a golden spike in a cere
mony in Promontory, Utah, in
18(H).

Stanford's business adven
tures allowed him some measure
of play. In 1870 he bought his
first race horse, named Occident.
He later bred, trained and raced
horses very successfully; one
year his horse won a world's re
cord. When the horse died, Ken
tucky racers were relieved.
An investment in the Califor
nia Street Cable Railroad
Franchise made Stanford an
even wealthier man. He tried to
talk his influential friends into
investing in the company, but
only a few were willing to take
the chance; he bought most of
the shares himself.
The cable was completed in
1877. Because Stanford never
did anything halfway, the cable
was made the best in the world
by a new method of molding
concrete. In spite of the low
five-cent fare for riding the cable
cars, the stock eventually made
him an even wealthier man.
Stanford wasn't successful at
everything. In 1881 he bought a
vineyard in Vina. Ca., and tried
to make table wine. According to
Haneberg, he invested a lot of
money in wine and made good
brandy, but never got good table
wine.
'Farmer at heart'
I lansen says that Stanford was
a "farmer at heart," and
made his first money by selling
crops he grew himself.
'He was a pioneer ot viticul
ture." he continues. "The
reasons for his failure at Vina

were soil problems." Stanford
planted 3000 acres of grapes
from France for champagne, but
they failed and became brandy.
His Weidel Winery at Mission
San lose still produces success
fully.
Jane had meanwhile made her
husband her career, and the two
were very close. Because of her
husband's many personal and
business interests, she knew
many famous people, traveled
widely, and lived well. And after
her husband's death, she suc
cessfully kept the University
running despite legal and finan
cial complications with the es
tate.
Hansen says that "Jane's out
standing characteristic was that
she was deeply religious. Her
life centered in her belief in im
mortality and Jesus Christ." Jane
supported Catholic charities, but
neither she nor Leland belonged
to any particular church. At the
University's dedication, both a
rabbi and a bishop officiated at
the ceremony.
Charitable
"She was charitable, but she
didn't toot her horn about it,"
Hansen continues. "She estab
lished kindergartens in Menlo
Park and San Francisco. She was
involved in women's suffrage,
and supported Susan B. An
thony. She was ahead of her
time."
In his memoirs, Wilbur de
scribes Jane as "never a beautiful
woman — some thought she re
sembled Queen Victoria in gen
eral appearance, which rather
pleased her. She had a com
manding presence and friendly
dignity which only a great heart,
courage and strong convictions
and character can Rive."
Up until their 18th year of mer
riage.the Sanfords remained
childless. Finally, in 1808 in
Sacramento, Leland Jr. was born.
Jane was 40 at the time of his
birth; according to Stanford Art
Museum docent Glenda North
way. he was her "precious
jewel."
Leland Jr had everything a
child could want. He was taken
on trips abroad, was educated by
the best tutors. For a while he
attended Heald Business College
in San Francisco.
Unspoiled
Yet Haneberg says that he
wasn't spoiled; research has it
that as a child his uncle bought
him a pair of boots he had been
longing for. He loved tht? boots,
and slept in them the first night.
The next day, he saw a poor boy
who had no shoes, so Leland |r.
gave him his boots.
Hansen says that Leland Jr..
was vej-y intelligent, had a good
sense of humor and enjoyed
playing boyish pranks. Yet "he
was brought up to be aware of
the responsibilities that wealth
brought."
In his memoirs, Wilbur writes
that Leland and Jane had a
"happy and dignified home life"
and trained their son in a "sensi
ble and careful way . . . for re
sponsibility that be would
handle wisely and wel I their vast
fortune which they thought
would become his. . ."
The joys of parenthood were
not long to last for Leland and
Jane. While the family was vaca
tioning in Istanbul, Leland Jr.
contracted typhoid fever. He got
worse in Naples and Rome, and
in 1884 died in Florence. He was
18.
Tremendous blow
The Stanfords had been very
close; the loss of an only child
was a tremendous blow. When
Leland Jr. died, his father sank
into a coma from the shock.
In his father's dreams, it is said
that Leland Jr. appeared and
said, "live for humanity." When
he awoke. Leland said. "Califor
nia's children shall be my chil
dren." Thus Leland founded Le
land Stanford Junior University.
Jane, as a memorial to her son,
established the Leland Stanford
Junior Museum. Museums were
her son's passion and lifelong
dream; the fall he was 16. he had
planned to enter Harvard and
study courses pertaining to the
running of a museum.
Today, the museum has as
permanent collections pottery,
weavings and sculpture that tin?
Stanfords brought back from
their many European travels.
And a room devoted entirely to
the Stanford family has the per
sonal boyhood mementos of Le
land Jr.. as well as paintings of
the family.
Cornerstone laid
The cornerstone for the new
I Jniversitv was laid on May 14 in
1887 — it would have been Le
land Ir. 's HMh birthday. In a cop
per box in the cornerstone, the

Stanfords placed, among other
documents pertaining to the or
ganization of the University, a
photograph of their son. The
University was to open four
years later.
According to Wilbur, Sen.
Stanford had no trouble choos
ing the site for hisllniversity.Al
though the Stanfords had vari
ous houses. Palo Alto was home,
so be chose his Palo Alto Farm.
'The Senator's opinion,"
writes Wilbur, "was that any
place that was good for raising
race horses ought to be good for
students."
Wilbur continues, "1 particu
larly liked Mr. Stanford's idea ol
what education should be. that it
should be for 'direct usefulness
in life.' He wanted it to break
away from the tradition-bound
classical and philosophical
programs of some of the older
eastern institutions, and to de
velop along the more practical
anil scientific lines in which
Cornell University, the Johns
Hopkins University and the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology were pioneering,
(ordan first president
"He wanted for president of
the new Western institution a
man of courage and initiative,
scientifically trained, who could
see and try new ways of doing
things. Such a man he found in
David Starr Jordan."
Wilbur, who entered Stanford
in 1802, writes of his early im
pressions of the physical expan
siveness and vastness of the
University "We came along El

Gamino Real, then a narrow dirt
road. . . We swung up to the
University buildings, which
were then only what we call now
the Inner Quadrangle (Memorial
Church had not yet been built).
"With the buff sandstone wall,
red-tiled roofs, and long
sandstone arcades they were de
lightfully different from any
educational buildings we had
ever seen."
Unlike many universities,
from the beginning Stanford was
coed. Girls were housed in Roble
Hall; the men in Encina Hall.
Hansen says that Encina has
been "slowly remodeled" and
now houses offices, the
Economics Department anil the
Food Research Institute.
Women 'favored'
Jane was not particularly
pleased that women were ac
cepted at Stanford; I lanebrg says
that Leland"favored"women. But
Jane went along with her
husband's wishes, and in spite of
hei misgivings, women were re
spected and given equal rights.
To welcome the women. Jane
gave tea parties at their Palo Alto
home, the site of the present
Children's Hospital.
Hansen explains that "the
founding grant doesn't prohibit
women; in 1800. women began
to increase. Jane became con
cerned that more women than
men would attend the Univer
sity that had been dedicated to
her son."
He adds that a clause to the
founding grant prohibited more
than 500 women. "Up until the
early 30s. they were known as
the 'Stanford 500.' It was later
rescinded by the trustees."
No tuition
In the early days there was no
tuition; Leland believed that all
his "children" should be enti
tled to an education. Students

were responsible for paying
their own miscellaneous ex
penses, and the University
charged $4.50 weekly for room
and board.
Wilbur writes that in his first
year at Stanford, one of those
miscellaneous expenses was
laundry. A "quiet, friendly
chap" came to Wilbur's room at
Encina anil asked if Wilbur
wanted to send his laundry to a
"San Jose company of which he
was the Stanford agent. He
promptly got my limited busi
ness." The quiet, friendly chap
was Herbert Hoover.
Stanford suffered the usual
growing pains that any new

educational institution could be
expected to encounter. Wilbur
writes that "not only was the
university undergoing organiza
tion, with educational processes
in debate at practically every
meeting of the faculty, but the
students themselves were
likewise developing their own
organizations their athletic
teams, their debating, literary
and musical societies and frater
nities. . . .

"A good many . . . new tradi
tions evaporated with one trial,
some lasted a little longer, a few
became a lasting part of Stanford
life. With the trial and error
method there developed, good
leadership and some rather un
ique and appropriate customs. . .
We were starting from the very
beginning."
Stanford's death
In spite of its growing pains,
the University continued
smoothly enough for two years.
But the young University was
devastated by the death of its
founder in 1893.
There was some question if the
University could survive finan
cially after Leland's death. The

estate was tied up in court tor
some time. Jane, who had a mas
sive jewelry collection second
only to the queen of England, es
tablished the Jewel Fund, the
money of which was used to pay
for salaries and books.
Hansen says that because of
Jane's firm, single-minded de
termination to do what she
wanted, she "plunged full speed
ahead" to save the University.
'When Leland died, the

lawyers advised her to close tin;
University," Hansen says. "She
refused, saying, 'If the school
closed down 1 would have no
thing to live tor.' The University
became her son; every energy
and dollar mustered wept to the
University. It was part of her
Christian zeal."
In 1905, Jane died.
Confusion
There was much confusion as
to the cause of her death. Wilbur
and Haneberg concur that death
was caused by a heart attack.
Rumors at the time had it that
she was poisoned with
strychnine by a maid . . . "as was
headlined in some of the more
sensational newspapers," writes
Wilbur.
Jane's body was placed, along
with her husband and son, in the
mausoleum, set apart from the
main grounds in a grove of oak
trees.
Another shock was to come to
the University, this time in the
form of the massive 1906 ear
thquake. The new Outer Quad,
much of the museum, the lib
rary, the gym, arches and Jane's
beloved, recently-built Memo
rial Church were badly dam
aged. The statue of biologist
Agassiz, located in front of Jor
dan Hall, fell headfirst into the
pavement. A student and fire
man were killed.
Wilbur writes that the Univer
sity was relieved that Jane wasn't
alive to see the damage, as that in
itself would have killed her. "It
was just a case of starting all over
again.
"Starting all over again" meant
immediately beginning restora
tion of the damaged buildings.
Wilbur writes that President Jor
dan issued a statement saying
that "the actual needs of the
growing University" would be
first considered.
"No backward" steps were
taken in repairs, nor were faculty
numbers reduced. For a while,
the University could not accept
any more students; the year after
the quake, students returned "in
greater number than ever he
fore."
President Jordan, Wilbur
writes, "drew some philosophi
cal lessons from the earthquake,
commenting that "forever man
must rise above his own crea
tions.' " The young university
soon fullv recovered.

estate was tied up in court tor
some time. Jane, who had a mas
sive jewelry collection second
only to the queen of England, es
tablished the Jewel Fund, the
money of which was used to pay
for salaries and books.
Hansen says that because of
Jane's firm, single-minded de
termination to do what she
wanted, she "plunged full speed
ahead" to save the University.
'When Leland died, the

lawyers advised her to close tin;
University," Hansen says. "She
refused, saying, 'If the school
closed down 1 would have no
thing to live tor.' The University
became her son; every energy
and dollar mustered wept to the
University. It was part of her
Christian zeal."
In 1905, Jane died.
Confusion
There was much confusion as
to the cause of her death. Wilbur
and Haneberg concur that death
was caused by a heart attack.
Rumors at the time had it that
she was poisoned with
strychnine by a maid . . . "as was
headlined in some of the more
sensational newspapers," writes
Wilbur.
Jane's body was placed, along
with her husband and son, in the
mausoleum, set apart from the
main grounds in a grove of oak
trees.
Another shock was to come to
the University, this time in the
form of the massive 1906 ear
thquake. The new Outer Quad,
much of the museum, the lib
rary, the gym, arches and Jane's
beloved, recently-built Memo
rial Church were badly dam
aged. The statue of biologist
Agassiz, located in front of Jor
dan Hall, fell headfirst into the
pavement. A student and fire
man were killed.
Wilbur writes that the Univer
sity was relieved that Jane wasn't
alive to see the damage, as that in
itself would have killed her. "It
was just a case of starting all over
again.
"Starting all over again" meant
immediately beginning restora
tion of the damaged buildings.
Wilbur writes that President Jor
dan issued a statement saying
that "the actual needs of the
growing University" would be
first considered.
"No backward" steps were
taken in repairs, nor were faculty
numbers reduced. For a while,
the University could not accept
any more students; the year after
the quake, students returned "in
greater number than ever he
fore."
President Jordan, Wilbur
writes, "drew some philosophi
cal lessons from the earthquake,
commenting that "forever man
must rise above his own crea
tions.' " The young university
soon fullv recovered.

Lpland Stanford Junior Unive
rsity was founded out of a very
simple but intense love and
memory of a mother and father
for their son, but its ideals were
so broad as to include the educa
tion of all children and tht; desire
to teach people to do something
useful with their lives.
I,eland Stanford was born in
1 Ml! 4 in Waterliet. New York. He
never received the university
education that was to mean so
much to him for others in the
founding of his university. In
stead, he was educated at coun
try schools and later apprenticed
himself to a law firm in Albany,
lie was admitted to the New
York and Wisconsin bars.
Ilis future wife. Jane Lathrop,
was born in Albany, New York,
in 1828. She was the daughter of
moderately well-to-do parents,
and received the normal private
school education that was fitting
for girls of her day.
The Stanfords were married in
1850. In 1852, Leland went alone
to San Francisco to begin his

business ventures. Jane stayed
behind in New York until 1855
to cure tor her ailing father, to
vyhom she was very close.
Settled in California
The Stanfords then moved to
Wisconsin, where they lived
until <i tragic fire destroyed Le
land's law library. To start a new
lite, they moved to Sacramento
via Nicaragua in 1856; I,eland's
father had told them that Califor
nia was the place to he.
In Sacramento, heland purch
ased his brothers' store, and then
began his political life. In 1858.
he helped to organize Sacramen
to's Republican party. Four years
later, he was chosen as a delegate
to the Chicago convention,
where he supported Lincoln.
Stanford gradually became
more of a political influence with
his election in 1881 as governor
of C California. As former Stanford
student, and later president. Kay
bvman Wilbur writes in his
memoirs, "as governor of
(California he had led in tin; bat
tle to keep California in the
I 'nion against those who wanted
it to follow the South or to set it
up as a separate republic." In
1885. he was to be elected to the
I 'nited States Senate.
Stanford museum docent and
i hairman of the Stanford Family
Portfolio Peg Haneberg says that
I .eland was a pacifist.
Arbitrator
"He believed that the standing
armies of Furope were a waste of
time and manpower." she says.
"Me believed that disputes

should be settled by arbitration."
The same year, 1861, Stanford
and three other men formed the
Central Pacific Railroad, of
which he later was elected pres
ident. Later, a series of compli
cated mergers consolidated sev
eral railroads into the Central
Pacific System.
Ralph Hansen, chief librarian
at tht; University libraries, says
that Leland and his three as
sociates'were known as the "big
four."
"He has been characterized by
some historians as a robber ba
ron." he adds. "If he was really
so despicable he wouldn't have
been liked so much by his
employees."
At first the railroad was consi
dered to be a risky financial ven
ture. but it later proved to be a
most lucrative investment, as it
was later to help support the
University. To celebrate the first
transcontinental line, Leland
drove a golden spike in a cere
mony in Promontory, Utah, in
18(H).

Stanford's business adven
tures allowed him some measure
of play. In 1870 he bought his
first race horse, named Occident.
He later bred, trained and raced
horses very successfully; one
year his horse won a world's re
cord. When the horse died, Ken
tucky racers were relieved.
An investment in the Califor
nia Street Cable Railroad
Franchise made Stanford an
even wealthier man. He tried to
talk his influential friends into
investing in the company, but
only a few were willing to take
the chance; he bought most of
the shares himself.
The cable was completed in
1877. Because Stanford never
did anything halfway, the cable
was made the best in the world
by a new method of molding
concrete. In spite of the low
five-cent fare for riding the cable
cars, the stock eventually made
him an even wealthier man.
Stanford wasn't successful at
everything. In 1881 he bought a
vineyard in Vina. Ca., and tried
to make table wine. According to
Haneberg, he invested a lot of
money in wine and made good
brandy, but never got good table
wine.
'Farmer at heart'
I lansen says that Stanford was
a "farmer at heart," and
made his first money by selling
crops he grew himself.
'He was a pioneer ot viticul
ture." he continues. "The
reasons for his failure at Vina

were soil problems." Stanford
planted 3000 acres of grapes
from France for champagne, but
they failed and became brandy.
His Weidel Winery at Mission
San lose still produces success
fully.
Jane had meanwhile made her
husband her career, and the two
were very close. Because of her
husband's many personal and
business interests, she knew
many famous people, traveled
widely, and lived well. And after
her husband's death, she suc
cessfully kept the University
running despite legal and finan
cial complications with the es
tate.
Hansen says that "Jane's out
standing characteristic was that
she was deeply religious. Her
life centered in her belief in im
mortality and Jesus Christ." Jane
supported Catholic charities, but
neither she nor Leland belonged
to any particular church. At the
University's dedication, both a
rabbi and a bishop officiated at
the ceremony.
Charitable
"She was charitable, but she
didn't toot her horn about it,"
Hansen continues. "She estab
lished kindergartens in Menlo
Park and San Francisco. She was
involved in women's suffrage,
and supported Susan B. An
thony. She was ahead of her
time."
In his memoirs, Wilbur de
scribes Jane as "never a beautiful
woman — some thought she re
sembled Queen Victoria in gen
eral appearance, which rather
pleased her. She had a com
manding presence and friendly
dignity which only a great heart,
courage and strong convictions
and character can Rive."
Up until their 18th year of mer
riage.the Sanfords remained
childless. Finally, in 1808 in
Sacramento, Leland Jr. was born.
Jane was 40 at the time of his
birth; according to Stanford Art
Museum docent Glenda North
way. he was her "precious
jewel."
Leland Jr had everything a
child could want. He was taken
on trips abroad, was educated by
the best tutors. For a while he
attended Heald Business College
in San Francisco.
Unspoiled
Yet Haneberg says that he
wasn't spoiled; research has it
that as a child his uncle bought
him a pair of boots he had been
longing for. He loved tht? boots,
and slept in them the first night.
The next day, he saw a poor boy
who had no shoes, so Leland |r.
gave him his boots.
Hansen says that Leland Jr..
was vej-y intelligent, had a good
sense of humor and enjoyed
playing boyish pranks. Yet "he
was brought up to be aware of
the responsibilities that wealth
brought."
In his memoirs, Wilbur writes
that Leland and Jane had a
"happy and dignified home life"
and trained their son in a "sensi
ble and careful way . . . for re
sponsibility that be would
handle wisely and wel I their vast
fortune which they thought
would become his. . ."
The joys of parenthood were
not long to last for Leland and
Jane. While the family was vaca
tioning in Istanbul, Leland Jr.
contracted typhoid fever. He got
worse in Naples and Rome, and
in 1884 died in Florence. He was
18.
Tremendous blow
The Stanfords had been very
close; the loss of an only child
was a tremendous blow. When
Leland Jr. died, his father sank
into a coma from the shock.
In his father's dreams, it is said
that Leland Jr. appeared and
said, "live for humanity." When
he awoke. Leland said. "Califor
nia's children shall be my chil
dren." Thus Leland founded Le
land Stanford Junior University.
Jane, as a memorial to her son,
established the Leland Stanford
Junior Museum. Museums were
her son's passion and lifelong
dream; the fall he was 16. he had
planned to enter Harvard and
study courses pertaining to the
running of a museum.
Today, the museum has as
permanent collections pottery,
weavings and sculpture that tin?
Stanfords brought back from
their many European travels.
And a room devoted entirely to
the Stanford family has the per
sonal boyhood mementos of Le
land Jr.. as well as paintings of
the family.
Cornerstone laid
The cornerstone for the new
I Jniversitv was laid on May 14 in
1887 — it would have been Le
land Ir. 's HMh birthday. In a cop
per box in the cornerstone, the

Stanfords placed, among other
documents pertaining to the or
ganization of the University, a
photograph of their son. The
University was to open four
years later.
According to Wilbur, Sen.
Stanford had no trouble choos
ing the site for hisllniversity.Al
though the Stanfords had vari
ous houses. Palo Alto was home,
so be chose his Palo Alto Farm.
'The Senator's opinion,"
writes Wilbur, "was that any
place that was good for raising
race horses ought to be good for
students."
Wilbur continues, "1 particu
larly liked Mr. Stanford's idea ol
what education should be. that it
should be for 'direct usefulness
in life.' He wanted it to break
away from the tradition-bound
classical and philosophical
programs of some of the older
eastern institutions, and to de
velop along the more practical
anil scientific lines in which
Cornell University, the Johns
Hopkins University and the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology were pioneering,
(ordan first president
"He wanted for president of
the new Western institution a
man of courage and initiative,
scientifically trained, who could
see and try new ways of doing
things. Such a man he found in
David Starr Jordan."
Wilbur, who entered Stanford
in 1802, writes of his early im
pressions of the physical expan
siveness and vastness of the
University "We came along El

Gamino Real, then a narrow dirt
road. . . We swung up to the
University buildings, which
were then only what we call now
the Inner Quadrangle (Memorial
Church had not yet been built).
"With the buff sandstone wall,
red-tiled roofs, and long
sandstone arcades they were de
lightfully different from any
educational buildings we had
ever seen."
Unlike many universities,
from the beginning Stanford was
coed. Girls were housed in Roble
Hall; the men in Encina Hall.
Hansen says that Encina has
been "slowly remodeled" and
now houses offices, the
Economics Department anil the
Food Research Institute.
Women 'favored'
Jane was not particularly
pleased that women were ac
cepted at Stanford; I lanebrg says
that Leland"favored"women. But
Jane went along with her
husband's wishes, and in spite of
hei misgivings, women were re
spected and given equal rights.
To welcome the women. Jane
gave tea parties at their Palo Alto
home, the site of the present
Children's Hospital.
Hansen explains that "the
founding grant doesn't prohibit
women; in 1800. women began
to increase. Jane became con
cerned that more women than
men would attend the Univer
sity that had been dedicated to
her son."
He adds that a clause to the
founding grant prohibited more
than 500 women. "Up until the
early 30s. they were known as
the 'Stanford 500.' It was later
rescinded by the trustees."
No tuition
In the early days there was no
tuition; Leland believed that all
his "children" should be enti
tled to an education. Students

were responsible for paying
their own miscellaneous ex
penses, and the University
charged $4.50 weekly for room
and board.
Wilbur writes that in his first
year at Stanford, one of those
miscellaneous expenses was
laundry. A "quiet, friendly
chap" came to Wilbur's room at
Encina anil asked if Wilbur
wanted to send his laundry to a
"San Jose company of which he
was the Stanford agent. He
promptly got my limited busi
ness." The quiet, friendly chap
was Herbert Hoover.
Stanford suffered the usual
growing pains that any new

educational institution could be
expected to encounter. Wilbur
writes that "not only was the
university undergoing organiza
tion, with educational processes
in debate at practically every
meeting of the faculty, but the
students themselves were
likewise developing their own
organizations their athletic
teams, their debating, literary
and musical societies and frater
nities. . . .

"A good many . . . new tradi
tions evaporated with one trial,
some lasted a little longer, a few
became a lasting part of Stanford
life. With the trial and error
method there developed, good
leadership and some rather un
ique and appropriate customs. . .
We were starting from the very
beginning."
Stanford's death
In spite of its growing pains,
the University continued
smoothly enough for two years.
But the young University was
devastated by the death of its
founder in 1893.
There was some question if the
University could survive finan
cially after Leland's death. The

estate was tied up in court tor
some time. Jane, who had a mas
sive jewelry collection second
only to the queen of England, es
tablished the Jewel Fund, the
money of which was used to pay
for salaries and books.
Hansen says that because of
Jane's firm, single-minded de
termination to do what she
wanted, she "plunged full speed
ahead" to save the University.
'When Leland died, the

lawyers advised her to close tin;
University," Hansen says. "She
refused, saying, 'If the school
closed down 1 would have no
thing to live tor.' The University
became her son; every energy
and dollar mustered wept to the
University. It was part of her
Christian zeal."
In 1905, Jane died.
Confusion
There was much confusion as
to the cause of her death. Wilbur
and Haneberg concur that death
was caused by a heart attack.
Rumors at the time had it that
she was poisoned with
strychnine by a maid . . . "as was
headlined in some of the more
sensational newspapers," writes
Wilbur.
Jane's body was placed, along
with her husband and son, in the
mausoleum, set apart from the
main grounds in a grove of oak
trees.
Another shock was to come to
the University, this time in the
form of the massive 1906 ear

in 1802, writes of his early im
pressions of the physical expan
siveness and vastness of the
University "We came along El

Gamino Real, then a narrow dirt
road. . . We swung up to the
University buildings, which
were then only what we call now
the Inner Quadrangle (Memorial
Church had not yet been built).
"With the buff sandstone wall,
red-tiled roofs, and long
sandstone arcades they were de
lightfully different from any
educational buildings we had
ever seen."
Unlike many universities,
from the beginning Stanford was
coed. Girls were housed in Roble
Hall; the men in Encina Hall.
Hansen says that Encina has
been "slowly remodeled" and
now houses offices, the
Economics Department anil the
Food Research Institute.
Women 'favored'
Jane was not particularly
pleased that women were ac
cepted at Stanford; I lanebrg says
that Leland"favored"women. But
Jane went along with her
husband's wishes, and in spite of
hei misgivings, women were re
spected and given equal rights.
To welcome the women. Jane
gave tea parties at their Palo Alto
home, the site of the present
Children's Hospital.
Hansen explains that "the
founding grant doesn't prohibit
women; in 1800. women began
to increase. Jane became con
cerned that more women than
men would attend the Univer
sity that had been dedicated to
her son."
He adds that a clause to the
founding grant prohibited more
than 500 women. "Up until the
early 30s. they were known as
the 'Stanford 500.' It was later
rescinded by the trustees."
No tuition
In the early days there was no
tuition; Leland believed that all
his "children" should be enti
tled to an education. Students

were responsible for paying
their own miscellaneous ex
penses, and the University
charged $4.50 weekly for room
and board.
Wilbur writes that in his first
year at Stanford, one of those
miscellaneous expenses was
laundry. A "quiet, friendly
chap" came to Wilbur's room at
Encina anil asked if Wilbur
wanted to send his laundry to a
"San Jose company of which he
was the Stanford agent. He
promptly got my limited busi
ness." The quiet, friendly chap
was Herbert Hoover.
Stanford suffered the usual
growing pains that any new

educational institution could be
expected to encounter. Wilbur
writes that "not only was the
university undergoing organiza
tion, with educational processes
in debate at practically every
meeting of the faculty, but the
students themselves were
likewise developing their own
organizations their athletic
teams, their debating, literary
and musical societies and frater
nities. . . .

"A good many . . . new tradi
tions evaporated with one trial,
some lasted a little longer, a few
became a lasting part of Stanford
life. With the trial and error
method there developed, good
leadership and some rather un
ique and appropriate customs. . .
We were starting from the very
beginning."
Stanford's death
In spite of its growing pains,
the University continued
smoothly enough for two years.
But the young University was
devastated by the death of its
founder in 1893.
There was some question if the
University could survive finan
cially after Leland's death. The

estate was tied up in court tor
some time. Jane, who had a mas
sive jewelry collection second
only to the queen of England, es
tablished the Jewel Fund, the
money of which was used to pay
for salaries and books.
Hansen says that because of
Jane's firm, single-minded de
termination to do what she
wanted, she "plunged full speed
ahead" to save the University.
'When Leland died, the

lawyers advised her to close tin;
University," Hansen says. "She
refused, saying, 'If the school
closed down 1 would have no
thing to live tor.' The University
became her son; every energy
and dollar mustered wept to the
University. It was part of her
Christian zeal."
In 1905, Jane died.
Confusion
There was much confusion as
to the cause of her death. Wilbur
and Haneberg concur that death
was caused by a heart attack.
Rumors at the time had it that
she was poisoned with
strychnine by a maid . . . "as was
headlined in some of the more
sensational newspapers," writes
Wilbur.
Jane's body was placed, along
with her husband and son, in the
mausoleum, set apart from the
main grounds in a grove of oak
trees.
Another shock was to come to
the University, this time in the
form of the massive 1906 ear
thquake. The new Outer Quad,
much of the museum, the lib
rary, the gym, arches and Jane's
beloved, recently-built Memo
rial Church were badly dam
aged. The statue of biologist
Agassiz, located in front of Jor
dan Hall, fell headfirst into the
pavement. A student and fire
man were killed.
Wilbur writes that the Univer
sity was relieved that Jane wasn't
alive to see the damage, as that in
itself would have killed her. "It
was just a case of starting all over
again.
"Starting all over again" meant
immediately beginning restora
tion of the damaged buildings.
Wilbur writes that President Jor
dan issued a statement saying
that "the actual needs of the
growing University" would be
first considered.
"No backward" steps were
taken in repairs, nor were faculty
numbers reduced. For a while,
the University could not accept
any more students; the year after
the quake, students returned "in
greater number than ever he
fore."
President Jordan, Wilbur
writes, "drew some philosophi
cal lessons from the earthquake,
commenting that "forever man
must rise above his own crea
tions.' " The young university
soon fullv recovered.

Lpland Stanford Junior Unive
rsity was founded out of a very
simple but intense love and
memory of a mother and father
for their son, but its ideals were
so broad as to include the educa
tion of all children and tht; desire
to teach people to do something
useful with their lives.
I,eland Stanford was born in
1 Ml! 4 in Waterliet. New York. He
never received the university
education that was to mean so
much to him for others in the
founding of his university. In
stead, he was educated at coun
try schools and later apprenticed
himself to a law firm in Albany,
lie was admitted to the New
York and Wisconsin bars.
Ilis future wife. Jane Lathrop,
was born in Albany, New York,
in 1828. She was the daughter of
moderately well-to-do parents,
and received the normal private
school education that was fitting
for girls of her day.
The Stanfords were married in
1850. In 1852, Leland went alone
to San Francisco to begin his

business ventures. Jane stayed
behind in New York until 1855
to cure tor her ailing father, to
vyhom she was very close.
Settled in California
The Stanfords then moved to
Wisconsin, where they lived
until <i tragic fire destroyed Le
land's law library. To start a new
lite, they moved to Sacramento
via Nicaragua in 1856; I,eland's
father had told them that Califor
nia was the place to he.
In Sacramento, heland purch
ased his brothers' store, and then
began his political life. In 1858.
he helped to organize Sacramen
to's Republican party. Four years
later, he was chosen as a delegate
to the Chicago convention,
where he supported Lincoln.
Stanford gradually became
more of a political influence with
his election in 1881 as governor
of C California. As former Stanford
student, and later president. Kay
bvman Wilbur writes in his
memoirs, "as governor of
(California he had led in tin; bat
tle to keep California in the
I 'nion against those who wanted
it to follow the South or to set it
up as a separate republic." In
1885. he was to be elected to the
I 'nited States Senate.
Stanford museum docent and
i hairman of the Stanford Family
Portfolio Peg Haneberg says that
I .eland was a pacifist.
Arbitrator
"He believed that the standing
armies of Furope were a waste of
time and manpower." she says.
"Me believed that disputes

should be settled by arbitration."
The same year, 1861, Stanford
and three other men formed the
Central Pacific Railroad, of
which he later was elected pres
ident. Later, a series of compli
cated mergers consolidated sev
eral railroads into the Central
Pacific System.
Ralph Hansen, chief librarian
at tht; University libraries, says
that Leland and his three as
sociates'were known as the "big
four."
"He has been characterized by
some historians as a robber ba
ron." he adds. "If he was really
so despicable he wouldn't have
been liked so much by his
employees."
At first the railroad was consi
dered to be a risky financial ven
ture. but it later proved to be a
most lucrative investment, as it
was later to help support the
University. To celebrate the first
transcontinental line, Leland
drove a golden spike in a cere
mony in Promontory, Utah, in
18(H).

Stanford's business adven
tures allowed him some measure
of play. In 1870 he bought his
first race horse, named Occident.
He later bred, trained and raced
horses very successfully; one
year his horse won a world's re
cord. When the horse died, Ken
tucky racers were relieved.
An investment in the Califor
nia Street Cable Railroad
Franchise made Stanford an
even wealthier man. He tried to
talk his influential friends into
investing in the company, but
only a few were willing to take
the chance; he bought most of
the shares himself.
The cable was completed in
1877. Because Stanford never
did anything halfway, the cable
was made the best in the world
by a new method of molding
concrete. In spite of the low
five-cent fare for riding the cable
cars, the stock eventually made
him an even wealthier man.
Stanford wasn't successful at
everything. In 1881 he bought a
vineyard in Vina. Ca., and tried
to make table wine. According to
Haneberg, he invested a lot of
money in wine and made good
brandy, but never got good table
wine.
'Farmer at heart'
I lansen says that Stanford was
a "farmer at heart," and
made his first money by selling
crops he grew himself.
'He was a pioneer ot viticul
ture." he continues. "The
reasons for his failure at Vina

were soil problems." Stanford
planted 3000 acres of grapes
from France for champagne, but
they failed and became brandy.
His Weidel Winery at Mission
San lose still produces success
fully.
Jane had meanwhile made her
husband her career, and the two
were very close. Because of her
husband's many personal and
business interests, she knew
many famous people, traveled
widely, and lived well. And after
her husband's death, she suc
cessfully kept the University
running despite legal and finan
cial complications with the es
tate.
Hansen says that "Jane's out
standing characteristic was that
she was deeply religious. Her
life centered in her belief in im
mortality and Jesus Christ." Jane
supported Catholic charities, but
neither she nor Leland belonged
to any particular church. At the
University's dedication, both a
rabbi and a bishop officiated at
the ceremony.
Charitable
"She was charitable, but she
didn't toot her horn about it,"
Hansen continues. "She estab
lished kindergartens in Menlo
Park and San Francisco. She was
involved in women's suffrage,
and supported Susan B. An
thony. She was ahead of her
time."
In his memoirs, Wilbur de
scribes Jane as "never a beautiful
woman — some thought she re
sembled Queen Victoria in gen
eral appearance, which rather
pleased her. She had a com
manding presence and friendly
dignity which only a great heart,
courage and strong convictions
and character can Rive."
Up until their 18th year of mer
riage.the Sanfords remained
childless. Finally, in 1808 in
Sacramento, Leland Jr. was born.
Jane was 40 at the time of his
birth; according to Stanford Art
Museum docent Glenda North
way. he was her "precious
jewel."
Leland Jr had everything a
child could want. He was taken
on trips abroad, was educated by
the best tutors. For a while he
attended Heald Business College
in San Francisco.
Unspoiled
Yet Haneberg says that he
wasn't spoiled; research has it
that as a child his uncle bought
him a pair of boots he had been
longing for. He loved tht? boots,
and slept in them the first night.
The next day, he saw a poor boy
who had no shoes, so Leland |r.
gave him his boots.
Hansen says that Leland Jr..
was vej-y intelligent, had a good
sense of humor and enjoyed
playing boyish pranks. Yet "he
was brought up to be aware of
the responsibilities that wealth
brought."
In his memoirs, Wilbur writes
that Leland and Jane had a
"happy and dignified home life"
and trained their son in a "sensi
ble and careful way . . . for re
sponsibility that be would
handle wisely and wel I their vast
fortune which they thought
would become his. . ."
The joys of parenthood were
not long to last for Leland and
Jane. While the family was vaca
tioning in Istanbul, Leland Jr.
contracted typhoid fever. He got
worse in Naples and Rome, and
in 1884 died in Florence. He was
18.
Tremendous blow
The Stanfords had been very
close; the loss of an only child
was a tremendous blow. When
Leland Jr. died, his father sank
into a coma from the shock.
In his father's dreams, it is said
that Leland Jr. appeared and
said, "live for humanity." When
he awoke. Leland said. "Califor
nia's children shall be my chil
dren." Thus Leland founded Le
land Stanford Junior University.
Jane, as a memorial to her son,
established the Leland Stanford
Junior Museum. Museums were
her son's passion and lifelong
dream; the fall he was 16. he had
planned to enter Harvard and
study courses pertaining to the
running of a museum.
Today, the museum has as
permanent collections pottery,
weavings and sculpture that tin?
Stanfords brought back from
their many European travels.
And a room devoted entirely to
the Stanford family has the per
sonal boyhood mementos of Le
land Jr.. as well as paintings of
the family.
Cornerstone laid
The cornerstone for the new
I Jniversitv was laid on May 14 in
1887 — it would have been Le
land Ir. 's HMh birthday. In a cop
per box in the cornerstone, the

Stanfords placed, among other
documents pertaining to the or
ganization of the University, a
photograph of their son. The
University was to open four
years later.
According to Wilbur, Sen.
Stanford had no trouble choos
ing the site for hisllniversity.Al
though the Stanfords had vari
ous houses. Palo Alto was home,
so be chose his Palo Alto Farm.
'The Senator's opinion,"
writes Wilbur, "was that any
place that was good for raising
race horses ought to be good for
students."
Wilbur continues, "1 particu
larly liked Mr. Stanford's idea ol
what education should be. that it
should be for 'direct usefulness
in life.' He wanted it to break
away from the tradition-bound
classical and philosophical
programs of some of the older
eastern institutions, and to de
velop along the more practical
anil scientific lines in which
Cornell University, the Johns
Hopkins University and the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology were pioneering,
(ordan first president
"He wanted for president of
the new Western institution a
man of courage and initiative,
scientifically trained, who could
see and try new ways of doing
things. Such a man he found in
David Starr Jordan."
Wilbur, who entered Stanford
in 1802, writes of his early im
pressions of the physical expan
siveness and vastness of the
University "We came along El

Gamino Real, then a narrow dirt
road. . . We swung up to the
University buildings, which
were then only what we call now
the Inner Quadrangle (Memorial

"With the buff sandstone wall,

who had no shoes, so Leland |r.
gave him his boots.
Hansen says that Leland Jr..
was vej-y intelligent, had a good
sense of humor and enjoyed
playing boyish pranks. Yet "he
was brought up to be aware of
the responsibilities that wealth
brought."
In his memoirs, Wilbur writes
that Leland and Jane had a
"happy and dignified home life"
and trained their son in a "sensi
ble and careful way . . . for re
sponsibility that be would
handle wisely and wel I their vast
fortune which they thought
would become his. . ."
The joys of parenthood were
not long to last for Leland and
Jane. While the family was vaca
tioning in Istanbul, Leland Jr.
contracted typhoid fever. He got
worse in Naples and Rome, and
in 1884 died in Florence. He was
18.
Tremendous blow
The Stanfords had been very
close; the loss of an only child
was a tremendous blow. When
Leland Jr. died, his father sank
into a coma from the shock.
In his father's dreams, it is said
that Leland Jr. appeared and
said, "live for humanity." When
he awoke. Leland said. "Califor
nia's children shall be my chil
dren." Thus Leland founded Le
land Stanford Junior University.
Jane, as a memorial to her son,
established the Leland Stanford
Junior Museum. Museums were
her son's passion and lifelong
dream; the fall he was 16. he had
planned to enter Harvard and
study courses pertaining to the
running of a museum.
Today, the museum has as
permanent collections pottery,
weavings and sculpture that tin?
Stanfords brought back from
their many European travels.
And a room devoted entirely to
the Stanford family has the per
sonal boyhood mementos of Le
land Jr.. as well as paintings of
the family.
Cornerstone laid
The cornerstone for the new
I Jniversitv was laid on May 14 in
1887 — it would have been Le
land Ir. 's HMh birthday. In a cop
per box in the cornerstone, the

Stanfords placed, among other
documents pertaining to the or
ganization of the University, a
photograph of their son. The
University was to open four
years later.
According to Wilbur, Sen.
Stanford had no trouble choos
ing the site for hisllniversity.Al
though the Stanfords had vari
ous houses. Palo Alto was home,
so be chose his Palo Alto Farm.
'The Senator's opinion,"
writes Wilbur, "was that any
place that was good for raising
race horses ought to be good for
students."
Wilbur continues, "1 particu
larly liked Mr. Stanford's idea ol
what education should be. that it
should be for 'direct usefulness
in life.' He wanted it to break
away from the tradition-bound
classical and philosophical
programs of some of the older
eastern institutions, and to de
velop along the more practical
anil scientific lines in which
Cornell University, the Johns
Hopkins University and the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology were pioneering,
(ordan first president
"He wanted for president of
the new Western institution a
man of courage and initiative,
scientifically trained, who could
see and try new ways of doing
things. Such a man he found in
David Starr Jordan."
Wilbur, who entered Stanford
in 1802, writes of his early im
pressions of the physical expan
siveness and vastness of the
University "We came along El

Gamino Real, then a narrow dirt
road. . . We swung up to the
University buildings, which
were then only what we call now
the Inner Quadrangle (Memorial
Church had not yet been built).
"With the buff sandstone wall,
red-tiled roofs, and long
sandstone arcades they were de
lightfully different from any
educational buildings we had
ever seen."
Unlike many universities,
from the beginning Stanford was
coed. Girls were housed in Roble
Hall; the men in Encina Hall.
Hansen says that Encina has
been "slowly remodeled" and
now houses offices, the
Economics Department anil the
Food Research Institute.
Women 'favored'
Jane was not particularly
pleased that women were ac
cepted at Stanford; I lanebrg says
that Leland"favored"women. But
Jane went along with her
husband's wishes, and in spite of
hei misgivings, women were re
spected and given equal rights.
To welcome the women. Jane
gave tea parties at their Palo Alto
home, the site of the present
Children's Hospital.
Hansen explains that "the
founding grant doesn't prohibit
women; in 1800. women began
to increase. Jane became con
cerned that more women than
men would attend the Univer
sity that had been dedicated to
her son."
He adds that a clause to the
founding grant prohibited more
than 500 women. "Up until the
early 30s. they were known as
the 'Stanford 500.' It was later
rescinded by the trustees."
No tuition
In the early days there was no
tuition; Leland believed that all
his "children" should be enti
tled to an education. Students

were responsible for paying
their own miscellaneous ex
penses, and the University
charged $4.50 weekly for room
and board.
Wilbur writes that in his first
year at Stanford, one of those
miscellaneous expenses was
laundry. A "quiet, friendly
chap" came to Wilbur's room at
Encina anil asked if Wilbur
wanted to send his laundry to a
"San Jose company of which he
was the Stanford agent. He
promptly got my limited busi
ness." The quiet, friendly chap
was Herbert Hoover.
Stanford suffered the usual
growing pains that any new

educational institution could be
expected to encounter. Wilbur
writes that "not only was the
university undergoing organiza
tion, with educational processes
in debate at practically every
meeting of the faculty, but the
students themselves were
likewise developing their own
organizations their athletic
teams, their debating, literary
and musical societies and frater
nities. . . .

"A good many . . . new tradi
tions evaporated with one trial,
some lasted a little longer, a few
became a lasting part of Stanford
life. With the trial and error
method there developed, good
leadership and some rather un
ique and appropriate customs. . .
We were starting from the very
beginning."
Stanford's death
In spite of its growing pains,
the University continued
smoothly enough for two years.
But the young University was
devastated by the death of its
founder in 1893.
There was some question if the
University could survive finan
cially after Leland's death. The

estate was tied up in court tor
some time. Jane, who had a mas
sive jewelry collection second
only to the queen of England, es
tablished the Jewel Fund, the
money of which was used to pay
for salaries and books.
Hansen says that because of
Jane's firm, single-minded de
termination to do what she
wanted, she "plunged full speed
ahead" to save the University.
'When Leland died, the

lawyers advised her to close tin;
University," Hansen says. "She
refused, saying, 'If the school
closed down 1 would have no
thing to live tor.' The University
became her son; every energy
and dollar mustered wept to the
University. It was part of her
Christian zeal."
In 1905, Jane died.
Confusion
There was much confusion as
to the cause of her death. Wilbur
and Haneberg concur that death
was caused by a heart attack.
Rumors at the time had it that
she was poisoned with
strychnine by a maid . . . "as was
headlined in some of the more
sensational newspapers," writes
Wilbur.
Jane's body was placed, along
with her husband and son, in the
mausoleum, set apart from the
main grounds in a grove of oak
trees.
Another shock was to come to
the University, this time in the
form of the massive 1906 ear
thquake. The new Outer Quad,
much of the museum, the lib
rary, the gym, arches and Jane's
beloved, recently-built Memo
rial Church were badly dam
aged. The statue of biologist
Agassiz, located in front of Jor
dan Hall, fell headfirst into the
pavement. A student and fire
man were killed.
Wilbur writes that the Univer
sity was relieved that Jane wasn't
alive to see the damage, as that in
itself would have killed her. "It
was just a case of starting all over
again.
"Starting all over again" meant
immediately beginning restora
tion of the damaged buildings.
Wilbur writes that President Jor
dan issued a statement saying
that "the actual needs of the
growing University" would be
first considered.
"No backward" steps were
taken in repairs, nor were faculty
numbers reduced. For a while,
the University could not accept
any more students; the year after
the quake, students returned "in
greater number than ever he
fore."
President Jordan, Wilbur
writes, "drew some philosophi
cal lessons from the earthquake,
commenting that "forever man
must rise above his own crea
tions.' " The young university
soon fullv recovered.

Lpland Stanford Junior Unive
rsity was founded out of a very
simple but intense love and
memory of a mother and father
for their son, but its ideals were
so broad as to include the educa
tion of all children and tht; desire
to teach people to do something
useful with their lives.
I,eland Stanford was born in
1 Ml! 4 in Waterliet. New York. He
never received the university
education that was to mean so
much to him for others in the
founding of his university. In
stead, he was educated at coun
try schools and later apprenticed
himself to a law firm in Albany,
lie was admitted to the New
York and Wisconsin bars.
Ilis future wife. Jane Lathrop,
was born in Albany, New York,
in 1828. She was the daughter of
moderately well-to-do parents,
and received the normal private
school education that was fitting
for girls of her day.
The Stanfords were married in
1850. In 1852, Leland went alone
to San Francisco to begin his

business ventures. Jane stayed
behind in New York until 1855
to cure tor her ailing father, to
vyhom she was very close.
Settled in California
The Stanfords then moved to
Wisconsin, where they lived
until <i tragic fire destroyed Le
land's law library. To start a new
lite, they moved to Sacramento
via Nicaragua in 1856; I,eland's
father had told them that Califor
nia was the place to he.
In Sacramento, heland purch
ased his brothers' store, and then
began his political life. In 1858.
he helped to organize Sacramen
to's Republican party. Four years
later, he was chosen as a delegate
to the Chicago convention,
where he supported Lincoln.
Stanford gradually became
more of a political influence with
his election in 1881 as governor
of C California. As former Stanford
student, and later president. Kay
bvman Wilbur writes in his
memoirs, "as governor of
(California he had led in tin; bat
tle to keep California in the
I 'nion against those who wanted
it to follow the South or to set it
up as a separate republic." In
1885. he was to be elected to the
I 'nited States Senate.
Stanford museum docent and
i hairman of the Stanford Family
Portfolio Peg Haneberg says that
I .eland was a pacifist.
Arbitrator
"He believed that the standing
armies of Furope were a waste of
time and manpower." she says.
"Me believed that disputes

should be settled by arbitration."
The same year, 1861, Stanford
and three other men formed the
Central Pacific Railroad, of
which he later was elected pres
ident. Later, a series of compli
cated mergers consolidated sev
eral railroads into the Central
Pacific System.
Ralph Hansen, chief librarian
at tht; University libraries, says
that Leland and his three as
sociates'were known as the "big
four."
"He has been characterized by
some historians as a robber ba
ron." he adds. "If he was really
so despicable he wouldn't have
been liked so much by his
employees."
At first the railroad was consi
dered to be a risky financial ven
ture. but it later proved to be a
most lucrative investment, as it
was later to help support the
University. To celebrate the first
transcontinental line, Leland
drove a golden spike in a cere
mony in Promontory, Utah, in
18(H).

Stanford's business adven
tures allowed him some measure
of play. In 1870 he bought his
first race horse, named Occident.
He later bred, trained and raced
horses very successfully; one
year his horse won a world's re
cord. When the horse died, Ken
tucky racers were relieved.
An investment in the Califor
nia Street Cable Railroad
Franchise made Stanford an
even wealthier man. He tried to
talk his influential friends into
investing in the company, but
only a few were willing to take
the chance; he bought most of
the shares himself.
The cable was completed in
1877. Because Stanford never
did anything halfway, the cable
was made the best in the world
by a new method of molding
concrete. In spite of the low
five-cent fare for riding the cable
cars, the stock eventually made
him an even wealthier man.
Stanford wasn't successful at
everything. In 1881 he bought a
vineyard in Vina. Ca., and tried
to make table wine. According to
Haneberg, he invested a lot of
money in wine and made good
brandy, but never got good table
wine.
'Farmer at heart'
I lansen says that Stanford was
a "farmer at heart," and
made his first money by selling
crops he grew himself.
'He was a pioneer ot viticul
ture." he continues. "The
reasons for his failure at Vina

were soil problems." Stanford
planted 3000 acres of grapes
from France for champagne, but
they failed and became brandy.
His Weidel Winery at Mission
San lose still produces success
fully.
Jane had meanwhile made her
husband her career, and the two
were very close. Because of her
husband's many personal and
business interests, she knew
many famous people, traveled
widely, and lived well. And after
her husband's death, she suc
cessfully kept the University
running despite legal and finan
cial complications with the es
tate.
Hansen says that "Jane's out
standing characteristic was that
she was deeply religious. Her
life centered in her belief in im
mortality and Jesus Christ." Jane
supported Catholic charities, but
neither she nor Leland belonged
to any particular church. At the
University's dedication, both a
rabbi and a bishop officiated at
the ceremony.
Charitable
"She was charitable, but she
didn't toot her horn about it,"
Hansen continues. "She estab
lished kindergartens in Menlo
Park and San Francisco. She was
involved in women's suffrage,
and supported Susan B. An
thony. She was ahead of her
time."
In his memoirs, Wilbur de
scribes Jane as "never a beautiful
woman — some thought she re
sembled Queen Victoria in gen
eral appearance, which rather
pleased her. She had a com
manding presence and friendly
dignity which only a great heart,
courage and strong convictions
and character can Rive."
Up until their 18th year of mer
riage.the Sanfords remained
childless. Finally, in 1808 in
Sacramento, Leland Jr. was born.
Jane was 40 at the time of his
birth; according to Stanford Art
Museum docent Glenda North
way. he was her "precious
jewel."
Leland Jr had everything a
child could want. He was taken
on trips abroad, was educated by
the best tutors. For a while he
attended Heald Business College
in San Francisco.
Unspoiled
Yet Haneberg says that he
wasn't spoiled; research has it
that as a child his uncle bought
him a pair of boots he had been
longing for. He loved tht? boots,
and slept in them the first night.
The next day, he saw a poor boy
who had no shoes, so Leland |r.
gave him his boots.
Hansen says that Leland Jr..
was vej-y intelligent, had a good
sense of humor and enjoyed
playing boyish pranks. Yet "he
was brought up to be aware of
the responsibilities that wealth
brought."
In his memoirs, Wilbur writes
that Leland and Jane had a
"happy and dignified home life"
and trained their son in a "sensi
ble and careful way . . . for re
sponsibility that be would
handle wisely and wel I their vast
fortune which they thought
would become his. . ."
The joys of parenthood were
not long to last for Leland and
Jane. While the family was vaca
tioning in Istanbul, Leland Jr.
contracted typhoid fever. He got
worse in Naples and Rome, and
in 1884 died in Florence. He was
18.
Tremendous blow
The Stanfords had been very
close; the loss of an only child
was a tremendous blow. When
Leland Jr. died, his father sank
into a coma from the shock.
In his father's dreams, it is said
that Leland Jr. appeared and

he awoke. Leland said. "Califor

land Stanford Junior University.
Jane, as a memorial to her son,
established the Leland Stanford
Junior Museum. Museums were
her son's passion and lifelong

planned to enter Harvard and
study courses pertaining to the
running of a museum.
Today, the museum has as

nia Street Cable Railroad
Franchise made Stanford an
even wealthier man. He tried to
talk his influential friends into
investing in the company, but
only a few were willing to take
the chance; he bought most of
the shares himself.
The cable was completed in
1877. Because Stanford never
did anything halfway, the cable
was made the best in the world
by a new method of molding
concrete. In spite of the low
five-cent fare for riding the cable
cars, the stock eventually made
him an even wealthier man.
Stanford wasn't successful at
everything. In 1881 he bought a
vineyard in Vina. Ca., and tried
to make table wine. According to
Haneberg, he invested a lot of
money in wine and made good
brandy, but never got good table
wine.
'Farmer at heart'
I lansen says that Stanford was
a "farmer at heart," and
made his first money by selling
crops he grew himself.
'He was a pioneer ot viticul
ture." he continues. "The
reasons for his failure at Vina

were soil problems." Stanford
planted 3000 acres of grapes
from France for champagne, but
they failed and became brandy.
His Weidel Winery at Mission
San lose still produces success
fully.
Jane had meanwhile made her
husband her career, and the two
were very close. Because of her
husband's many personal and
business interests, she knew
many famous people, traveled
widely, and lived well. And after
her husband's death, she suc
cessfully kept the University
running despite legal and finan
cial complications with the es
tate.
Hansen says that "Jane's out
standing characteristic was that
she was deeply religious. Her
life centered in her belief in im
mortality and Jesus Christ." Jane
supported Catholic charities, but
neither she nor Leland belonged
to any particular church. At the
University's dedication, both a
rabbi and a bishop officiated at
the ceremony.
Charitable
"She was charitable, but she
didn't toot her horn about it,"
Hansen continues. "She estab
lished kindergartens in Menlo
Park and San Francisco. She was
involved in women's suffrage,
and supported Susan B. An
thony. She was ahead of her
time."
In his memoirs, Wilbur de
scribes Jane as "never a beautiful
woman — some thought she re
sembled Queen Victoria in gen
eral appearance, which rather
pleased her. She had a com
manding presence and friendly
dignity which only a great heart,
courage and strong convictions
and character can Rive."
Up until their 18th year of mer
riage.the Sanfords remained
childless. Finally, in 1808 in
Sacramento, Leland Jr. was born.
Jane was 40 at the time of his
birth; according to Stanford Art
Museum docent Glenda North
way. he was her "precious
jewel."
Leland Jr had everything a
child could want. He was taken
on trips abroad, was educated by
the best tutors. For a while he
attended Heald Business College
in San Francisco.
Unspoiled
Yet Haneberg says that he
wasn't spoiled; research has it
that as a child his uncle bought
him a pair of boots he had been
longing for. He loved tht? boots,
and slept in them the first night.
The next day, he saw a poor boy
who had no shoes, so Leland |r.
gave him his boots.
Hansen says that Leland Jr..
was vej-y intelligent, had a good
sense of humor and enjoyed
playing boyish pranks. Yet "he
was brought up to be aware of
the responsibilities that wealth
brought."
In his memoirs, Wilbur writes
that Leland and Jane had a
"happy and dignified home life"
and trained their son in a "sensi
ble and careful way . . . for re
sponsibility that be would
handle wisely and wel I their vast
fortune which they thought
would become his. . ."
The joys of parenthood were
not long to last for Leland and
Jane. While the family was vaca
tioning in Istanbul, Leland Jr.
contracted typhoid fever. He got
worse in Naples and Rome, and
in 1884 died in Florence. He was
18.
Tremendous blow
The Stanfords had been very
close; the loss of an only child
was a tremendous blow. When
Leland Jr. died, his father sank
into a coma from the shock.
In his father's dreams, it is said
that Leland Jr. appeared and
said, "live for humanity." When
he awoke. Leland said. "Califor
nia's children shall be my chil
dren." Thus Leland founded Le
land Stanford Junior University.
Jane, as a memorial to her son,
established the Leland Stanford
Junior Museum. Museums were
her son's passion and lifelong
dream; the fall he was 16. he had
planned to enter Harvard and
study courses pertaining to the
running of a museum.
Today, the museum has as
permanent collections pottery,
weavings and sculpture that tin?
Stanfords brought back from
their many European travels.
And a room devoted entirely to
the Stanford family has the per
sonal boyhood mementos of Le
land Jr.. as well as paintings of
the family.
Cornerstone laid
The cornerstone for the new
I Jniversitv was laid on May 14 in
1887 — it would have been Le
land Ir. 's HMh birthday. In a cop
per box in the cornerstone, the

Stanfords placed, among other
documents pertaining to the or
ganization of the University, a
photograph of their son. The
University was to open four
years later.
According to Wilbur, Sen.
Stanford had no trouble choos
ing the site for hisllniversity.Al
though the Stanfords had vari
ous houses. Palo Alto was home,
so be chose his Palo Alto Farm.
'The Senator's opinion,"
writes Wilbur, "was that any
place that was good for raising
race horses ought to be good for
students."
Wilbur continues, "1 particu
larly liked Mr. Stanford's idea ol
what education should be. that it
should be for 'direct usefulness
in life.' He wanted it to break
away from the tradition-bound
classical and philosophical
programs of some of the older
eastern institutions, and to de
velop along the more practical
anil scientific lines in which
Cornell University, the Johns
Hopkins University and the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology were pioneering,
(ordan first president
"He wanted for president of
the new Western institution a
man of courage and initiative,
scientifically trained, who could
see and try new ways of doing
things. Such a man he found in
David Starr Jordan."
Wilbur, who entered Stanford
in 1802, writes of his early im
pressions of the physical expan
siveness and vastness of the
University "We came along El

Gamino Real, then a narrow dirt
road. . . We swung up to the
University buildings, which
were then only what we call now
the Inner Quadrangle (Memorial
Church had not yet been built).
"With the buff sandstone wall,
red-tiled roofs, and long
sandstone arcades they were de
lightfully different from any
educational buildings we had
ever seen."
Unlike many universities,
from the beginning Stanford was
coed. Girls were housed in Roble
Hall; the men in Encina Hall.
Hansen says that Encina has
been "slowly remodeled" and
now houses offices, the
Economics Department anil the
Food Research Institute.
Women 'favored'
Jane was not particularly
pleased that women were ac
cepted at Stanford; I lanebrg says
that Leland"favored"women. But
Jane went along with her
husband's wishes, and in spite of
hei misgivings, women were re
spected and given equal rights.
To welcome the women. Jane
gave tea parties at their Palo Alto
home, the site of the present
Children's Hospital.
Hansen explains that "the
founding grant doesn't prohibit
women; in 1800. women began
to increase. Jane became con
cerned that more women than
men would attend the Univer
sity that had been dedicated to
her son."
He adds that a clause to the
founding grant prohibited more
than 500 women. "Up until the
early 30s. they were known as
the 'Stanford 500.' It was later
rescinded by the trustees."
No tuition
In the early days there was no
tuition; Leland believed that all
his "children" should be enti
tled to an education. Students

were responsible for paying
their own miscellaneous ex
penses, and the University
charged $4.50 weekly for room
and board.
Wilbur writes that in his first
year at Stanford, one of those
miscellaneous expenses was
laundry. A "quiet, friendly
chap" came to Wilbur's room at
Encina anil asked if Wilbur
wanted to send his laundry to a
"San Jose company of which he
was the Stanford agent. He
promptly got my limited busi
ness." The quiet, friendly chap
was Herbert Hoover.
Stanford suffered the usual
growing pains that any new

educational institution could be
expected to encounter. Wilbur
writes that "not only was the
university undergoing organiza
tion, with educational processes
in debate at practically every
meeting of the faculty, but the
students themselves were
likewise developing their own
organizations their athletic
teams, their debating, literary
and musical societies and frater
nities. . . .

"A good many . . . new tradi
tions evaporated with one trial,
some lasted a little longer, a few
became a lasting part of Stanford
life. With the trial and error
method there developed, good
leadership and some rather un
ique and appropriate customs. . .
We were starting from the very
beginning."
Stanford's death
In spite of its growing pains,
the University continued
smoothly enough for two years.
But the young University was
devastated by the death of its
founder in 1893.
There was some question if the
University could survive finan
cially after Leland's death. The

estate was tied up in court tor
some time. Jane, who had a mas
sive jewelry collection second
only to the queen of England, es
tablished the Jewel Fund, the
money of which was used to pay
for salaries and books.
Hansen says that because of
Jane's firm, single-minded de
termination to do what she
wanted, she "plunged full speed
ahead" to save the University.
'When Leland died, the

lawyers advised her to close tin;
University," Hansen says. "She
refused, saying, 'If the school
closed down 1 would have no
thing to live tor.' The University
became her son; every energy
and dollar mustered wept to the
University. It was part of her
Christian zeal."
In 1905, Jane died.
Confusion
There was much confusion as
to the cause of her death. Wilbur
and Haneberg concur that death
was caused by a heart attack.
Rumors at the time had it that
she was poisoned with
strychnine by a maid . . . "as was
headlined in some of the more
sensational newspapers," writes
Wilbur.
Jane's body was placed, along
with her husband and son, in the
mausoleum, set apart from the
main grounds in a grove of oak
trees.
Another shock was to come to
the University, this time in the
form of the massive 1906 ear
thquake. The new Outer Quad,
much of the museum, the lib
rary, the gym, arches and Jane's
beloved, recently-built Memo
rial Church were badly dam
aged. The statue of biologist
Agassiz, located in front of Jor
dan Hall, fell headfirst into the
pavement. A student and fire
man were killed.
Wilbur writes that the Univer
sity was relieved that Jane wasn't
alive to see the damage, as that in
itself would have killed her. "It
was just a case of starting all over
again.
"Starting all over again" meant
immediately beginning restora
tion of the damaged buildings.
Wilbur writes that President Jor
dan issued a statement saying
that "the actual needs of the
growing University" would be
first considered.
"No backward" steps were
taken in repairs, nor were faculty
numbers reduced. For a while,
the University could not accept
any more students; the year after
the quake, students returned "in
greater number than ever he
fore."
President Jordan, Wilbur
writes, "drew some philosophi
cal lessons from the earthquake,
commenting that "forever man
must rise above his own crea
tions.' " The young university
soon fullv recovered.

Lpland Stanford Junior Unive
rsity was founded out of a very
simple but intense love and
memory of a mother and father
for their son, but its ideals were
so broad as to include the educa
tion of all children and tht; desire
to teach people to do something
useful with their lives.
I,eland Stanford was born in
1 Ml! 4 in Waterliet. New York. He
never received the university
education that was to mean so
much to him for others in the
founding of his university. In
stead, he was educated at coun
try schools and later apprenticed
himself to a law firm in Albany,
lie was admitted to the New
York and Wisconsin bars.
Ilis future wife. Jane Lathrop,
was born in Albany, New York,
in 1828. She was the daughter of
moderately well-to-do parents,
and received the normal private
school education that was fitting
for girls of her day.
The Stanfords were married in
1850. In 1852, Leland went alone
to San Francisco to begin his

business ventures. Jane stayed
behind in New York until 1855
to cure tor her ailing father, to
vyhom she was very close.
Settled in California
The Stanfords then moved to
Wisconsin, where they lived
until <i tragic fire destroyed Le
land's law library. To start a new
lite, they moved to Sacramento
via Nicaragua in 1856; I,eland's
father had told them that Califor
nia was the place to he.
In Sacramento, heland purch
ased his brothers' store, and then
began his political life. In 1858.
he helped to organize Sacramen
to's Republican party. Four years
later, he was chosen as a delegate
to the Chicago convention,
where he supported Lincoln.
Stanford gradually became
more of a political influence with
his election in 1881 as governor
of C California. As former Stanford
student, and later president. Kay
bvman Wilbur writes in his
memoirs, "as governor of
(California he had led in tin; bat
tle to keep California in the
I 'nion against those who wanted
it to follow the South or to set it
up as a separate republic." In
1885. he was to be elected to the
I 'nited States Senate.
Stanford museum docent and
i hairman of the Stanford Family
Portfolio Peg Haneberg says that
I .eland was a pacifist.
Arbitrator
"He believed that the standing
armies of Furope were a waste of
time and manpower." she says.
"Me believed that disputes

should be settled by arbitration."
The same year, 1861, Stanford
and three other men formed the
Central Pacific Railroad, of
which he later was elected pres
ident. Later, a series of compli
cated mergers consolidated sev
eral railroads into the Central
Pacific System.
Ralph Hansen, chief librarian
at tht; University libraries, says
that Leland and his three as
sociates'were known as the "big
four."
"He has been characterized by
some historians as a robber ba
ron." he adds. "If he was really
so despicable he wouldn't have
been liked so much by his
employees."
At first the railroad was consi
dered to be a risky financial ven
ture. but it later proved to be a
most lucrative investment, as it
was later to help support the
University. To celebrate the first
transcontinental line, Leland
drove a golden spike in a cere
mony in Promontory, Utah, in
18(H).

Stanford's business adven
tures allowed him some measure
of play. In 1870 he bought his
first race horse, named Occident.
He later bred, trained and raced
horses very successfully; one
year his horse won a world's re
cord. When the horse died, Ken
tucky racers were relieved.
An investment in the Califor
nia Street Cable Railroad
Franchise made Stanford an
even wealthier man. He tried to
talk his influential friends into
investing in the company, but
only a few were willing to take
the chance; he bought most of
the shares himself.
The cable was completed in
1877. Because Stanford never
did anything halfway, the cable
was made the best in the world
by a new method of molding
concrete. In spite of the low
five-cent fare for riding the cable
cars, the stock eventually made
him an even wealthier man.
Stanford wasn't successful at
everything. In 1881 he bought a
vineyard in Vina. Ca., and tried
to make table wine. According to
Haneberg, he invested a lot of
money in wine and made good
brandy, but never got good table

planted 3000 acres of grapes

try schools and later apprenticed
himself to a law firm in Albany,
lie was admitted to the New
York and Wisconsin bars.
Ilis future wife. Jane Lathrop,
was born in Albany, New York,
in 1828. She was the daughter of
moderately well-to-do parents,
and received the normal private
school education that was fitting
for girls of her day.
The Stanfords were married in
1850. In 1852, Leland went alone
to San Francisco to begin his

business ventures. Jane stayed
behind in New York until 1855
to cure tor her ailing father, to
vyhom she was very close.
Settled in California
The Stanfords then moved to
Wisconsin, where they lived
until <i tragic fire destroyed Le
land's law library. To start a new
lite, they moved to Sacramento
via Nicaragua in 1856; I,eland's
father had told them that Califor
nia was the place to he.
In Sacramento, heland purch
ased his brothers' store, and then
began his political life. In 1858.
he helped to organize Sacramen
to's Republican party. Four years
later, he was chosen as a delegate
to the Chicago convention,
where he supported Lincoln.
Stanford gradually became
more of a political influence with
his election in 1881 as governor
of C California. As former Stanford
student, and later president. Kay
bvman Wilbur writes in his
memoirs, "as governor of
(California he had led in tin; bat
tle to keep California in the
I 'nion against those who wanted
it to follow the South or to set it
up as a separate republic." In
1885. he was to be elected to the
I 'nited States Senate.
Stanford museum docent and
i hairman of the Stanford Family
Portfolio Peg Haneberg says that
I .eland was a pacifist.
Arbitrator
"He believed that the standing
armies of Furope were a waste of
time and manpower." she says.
"Me believed that disputes

should be settled by arbitration."
The same year, 1861, Stanford
and three other men formed the
Central Pacific Railroad, of
which he later was elected pres
ident. Later, a series of compli
cated mergers consolidated sev
eral railroads into the Central
Pacific System.
Ralph Hansen, chief librarian
at tht; University libraries, says
that Leland and his three as
sociates'were known as the "big
four."
"He has been characterized by
some historians as a robber ba
ron." he adds. "If he was really
so despicable he wouldn't have
been liked so much by his
employees."
At first the railroad was consi
dered to be a risky financial ven
ture. but it later proved to be a
most lucrative investment, as it
was later to help support the
University. To celebrate the first
transcontinental line, Leland
drove a golden spike in a cere
mony in Promontory, Utah, in
18(H).

Stanford's business adven
tures allowed him some measure
of play. In 1870 he bought his
first race horse, named Occident.
He later bred, trained and raced
horses very successfully; one
year his horse won a world's re
cord. When the horse died, Ken
tucky racers were relieved.
An investment in the Califor
nia Street Cable Railroad
Franchise made Stanford an
even wealthier man. He tried to
talk his influential friends into
investing in the company, but
only a few were willing to take
the chance; he bought most of
the shares himself.
The cable was completed in
1877. Because Stanford never
did anything halfway, the cable
was made the best in the world
by a new method of molding
concrete. In spite of the low
five-cent fare for riding the cable
cars, the stock eventually made
him an even wealthier man.
Stanford wasn't successful at
everything. In 1881 he bought a
vineyard in Vina. Ca., and tried
to make table wine. According to
Haneberg, he invested a lot of
money in wine and made good
brandy, but never got good table
wine.
'Farmer at heart'
I lansen says that Stanford was
a "farmer at heart," and
made his first money by selling
crops he grew himself.
'He was a pioneer ot viticul
ture." he continues. "The
reasons for his failure at Vina

were soil problems." Stanford
planted 3000 acres of grapes
from France for champagne, but
they failed and became brandy.
His Weidel Winery at Mission
San lose still produces success
fully.
Jane had meanwhile made her
husband her career, and the two
were very close. Because of her
husband's many personal and
business interests, she knew
many famous people, traveled
widely, and lived well. And after
her husband's death, she suc
cessfully kept the University
running despite legal and finan
cial complications with the es
tate.
Hansen says that "Jane's out
standing characteristic was that
she was deeply religious. Her
life centered in her belief in im
mortality and Jesus Christ." Jane
supported Catholic charities, but
neither she nor Leland belonged
to any particular church. At the
University's dedication, both a
rabbi and a bishop officiated at
the ceremony.
Charitable
"She was charitable, but she
didn't toot her horn about it,"
Hansen continues. "She estab
lished kindergartens in Menlo
Park and San Francisco. She was
involved in women's suffrage,
and supported Susan B. An
thony. She was ahead of her
time."
In his memoirs, Wilbur de
scribes Jane as "never a beautiful
woman — some thought she re
sembled Queen Victoria in gen
eral appearance, which rather
pleased her. She had a com
manding presence and friendly
dignity which only a great heart,
courage and strong convictions
and character can Rive."
Up until their 18th year of mer
riage.the Sanfords remained
childless. Finally, in 1808 in
Sacramento, Leland Jr. was born.
Jane was 40 at the time of his
birth; according to Stanford Art
Museum docent Glenda North
way. he was her "precious
jewel."
Leland Jr had everything a
child could want. He was taken
on trips abroad, was educated by
the best tutors. For a while he
attended Heald Business College
in San Francisco.
Unspoiled
Yet Haneberg says that he
wasn't spoiled; research has it
that as a child his uncle bought
him a pair of boots he had been
longing for. He loved tht? boots,
and slept in them the first night.
The next day, he saw a poor boy
who had no shoes, so Leland |r.
gave him his boots.
Hansen says that Leland Jr..
was vej-y intelligent, had a good
sense of humor and enjoyed
playing boyish pranks. Yet "he
was brought up to be aware of
the responsibilities that wealth
brought."
In his memoirs, Wilbur writes
that Leland and Jane had a
"happy and dignified home life"
and trained their son in a "sensi
ble and careful way . . . for re
sponsibility that be would
handle wisely and wel I their vast
fortune which they thought
would become his. . ."
The joys of parenthood were
not long to last for Leland and
Jane. While the family was vaca
tioning in Istanbul, Leland Jr.
contracted typhoid fever. He got
worse in Naples and Rome, and
in 1884 died in Florence. He was
18.
Tremendous blow
The Stanfords had been very
close; the loss of an only child
was a tremendous blow. When
Leland Jr. died, his father sank
into a coma from the shock.
In his father's dreams, it is said
that Leland Jr. appeared and
said, "live for humanity." When
he awoke. Leland said. "Califor
nia's children shall be my chil
dren." Thus Leland founded Le
land Stanford Junior University.
Jane, as a memorial to her son,
established the Leland Stanford
Junior Museum. Museums were
her son's passion and lifelong
dream; the fall he was 16. he had
planned to enter Harvard and
study courses pertaining to the
running of a museum.
Today, the museum has as
permanent collections pottery,
weavings and sculpture that tin?
Stanfords brought back from
their many European travels.
And a room devoted entirely to
the Stanford family has the per
sonal boyhood mementos of Le
land Jr.. as well as paintings of
the family.
Cornerstone laid
The cornerstone for the new
I Jniversitv was laid on May 14 in
1887 — it would have been Le
land Ir. 's HMh birthday. In a cop
per box in the cornerstone, the

Stanfords placed, among other
documents pertaining to the or
ganization of the University, a
photograph of their son. The
University was to open four
years later.
According to Wilbur, Sen.
Stanford had no trouble choos
ing the site for hisllniversity.Al
though the Stanfords had vari
ous houses. Palo Alto was home,
so be chose his Palo Alto Farm.
'The Senator's opinion,"
writes Wilbur, "was that any
place that was good for raising
race horses ought to be good for
students."
Wilbur continues, "1 particu
larly liked Mr. Stanford's idea ol
what education should be. that it
should be for 'direct usefulness
in life.' He wanted it to break
away from the tradition-bound
classical and philosophical
programs of some of the older
eastern institutions, and to de
velop along the more practical
anil scientific lines in which
Cornell University, the Johns
Hopkins University and the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology were pioneering,
(ordan first president
"He wanted for president of
the new Western institution a
man of courage and initiative,
scientifically trained, who could
see and try new ways of doing
things. Such a man he found in
David Starr Jordan."
Wilbur, who entered Stanford
in 1802, writes of his early im
pressions of the physical expan
siveness and vastness of the
University "We came along El

Gamino Real, then a narrow dirt
road. . . We swung up to the
University buildings, which
were then only what we call now
the Inner Quadrangle (Memorial
Church had not yet been built).
"With the buff sandstone wall,
red-tiled roofs, and long
sandstone arcades they were de
lightfully different from any
educational buildings we had
ever seen."
Unlike many universities,
from the beginning Stanford was
coed. Girls were housed in Roble
Hall; the men in Encina Hall.
Hansen says that Encina has
been "slowly remodeled" and
now houses offices, the
Economics Department anil the
Food Research Institute.
Women 'favored'
Jane was not particularly
pleased that women were ac
cepted at Stanford; I lanebrg says
that Leland"favored"women. But
Jane went along with her
husband's wishes, and in spite of
hei misgivings, women were re
spected and given equal rights.
To welcome the women. Jane
gave tea parties at their Palo Alto
home, the site of the present
Children's Hospital.
Hansen explains that "the
founding grant doesn't prohibit
women; in 1800. women began
to increase. Jane became con
cerned that more women than
men would attend the Univer
sity that had been dedicated to
her son."
He adds that a clause to the
founding grant prohibited more
than 500 women. "Up until the
early 30s. they were known as
the 'Stanford 500.' It was later
rescinded by the trustees."
No tuition
In the early days there was no
tuition; Leland believed that all
his "children" should be enti
tled to an education. Students

were responsible for paying
their own miscellaneous ex
penses, and the University
charged $4.50 weekly for room
and board.
Wilbur writes that in his first
year at Stanford, one of those
miscellaneous expenses was
laundry. A "quiet, friendly
chap" came to Wilbur's room at
Encina anil asked if Wilbur
wanted to send his laundry to a
"San Jose company of which he
was the Stanford agent. He
promptly got my limited busi
ness." The quiet, friendly chap
was Herbert Hoover.
Stanford suffered the usual
growing pains that any new

educational institution could be
expected to encounter. Wilbur
writes that "not only was the
university undergoing organiza
tion, with educational processes
in debate at practically every
meeting of the faculty, but the
students themselves were
likewise developing their own
organizations their athletic
teams, their debating, literary
and musical societies and frater
nities. . . .

"A good many . . . new tradi
tions evaporated with one trial,
some lasted a little longer, a few
became a lasting part of Stanford
life. With the trial and error
method there developed, good
leadership and some rather un
ique and appropriate customs. . .
We were starting from the very
beginning."
Stanford's death
In spite of its growing pains,
the University continued
smoothly enough for two years.
But the young University was
devastated by the death of its
founder in 1893.
There was some question if the
University could survive finan
cially after Leland's death. The

estate was tied up in court tor
some time. Jane, who had a mas
sive jewelry collection second
only to the queen of England, es
tablished the Jewel Fund, the
money of which was used to pay
for salaries and books.
Hansen says that because of
Jane's firm, single-minded de
termination to do what she
wanted, she "plunged full speed
ahead" to save the University.
'When Leland died, the

lawyers advised her to close tin;
University," Hansen says. "She
refused, saying, 'If the school
closed down 1 would have no
thing to live tor.' The University
became her son; every energy
and dollar mustered wept to the
University. It was part of her
Christian zeal."
In 1905, Jane died.
Confusion
There was much confusion as
to the cause of her death. Wilbur
and Haneberg concur that death
was caused by a heart attack.
Rumors at the time had it that
she was poisoned with
strychnine by a maid . . . "as was
headlined in some of the more
sensational newspapers," writes
Wilbur.
Jane's body was placed, along
with her husband and son, in the
mausoleum, set apart from the
main grounds in a grove of oak
trees.
Another shock was to come to
the University, this time in the
form of the massive 1906 ear
thquake. The new Outer Quad,
much of the museum, the lib
rary, the gym, arches and Jane's
beloved, recently-built Memo
rial Church were badly dam
aged. The statue of biologist
Agassiz, located in front of Jor
dan Hall, fell headfirst into the
pavement. A student and fire
man were killed.
Wilbur writes that the Univer
sity was relieved that Jane wasn't
alive to see the damage, as that in
itself would have killed her. "It
was just a case of starting all over
again.
"Starting all over again" meant
immediately beginning restora
tion of the damaged buildings.
Wilbur writes that President Jor
dan issued a statement saying
that "the actual needs of the
growing University" would be
first considered.
"No backward" steps were
taken in repairs, nor were faculty
numbers reduced. For a while,
the University could not accept
any more students; the year after
the quake, students returned "in
greater number than ever he
fore."
President Jordan, Wilbur
writes, "drew some philosophi
cal lessons from the earthquake,
commenting that "forever man
must rise above his own crea
tions.' " The young university
soon fullv recovered.

Lpland Stanford Junior Unive
rsity was founded out of a very
simple but intense love and
memory of a mother and father
for their son, but its ideals were
so broad as to include the educa
tion of all children and tht; desire
to teach people to do something
useful with their lives.
I,eland Stanford was born in
1 Ml! 4 in Waterliet. New York. He
never received the university
education that was to mean so
much to him for others in the
founding of his university. In

closed down 1 would have no
thing to live tor.' The University
became her son; every energy
and dollar mustered wept to the
University. It was part of her
Christian zeal."
In 1905, Jane died.
Confusion
There was much confusion as
to the cause of her death. Wilbur
and Haneberg concur that death
was caused by a heart attack.
Rumors at the time had it that
she was poisoned with
strychnine by a maid . . . "as was
headlined in some of the more
sensational newspapers," writes
Wilbur.
Jane's body was placed, along
with her husband and son, in the
mausoleum, set apart from the
main grounds in a grove of oak
trees.
Another shock was to come to
the University, this time in the
form of the massive 1906 ear
thquake. The new Outer Quad,
much of the museum, the lib
rary, the gym, arches and Jane's
beloved, recently-built Memo
rial Church were badly dam
aged. The statue of biologist
Agassiz, located in front of Jor
dan Hall, fell headfirst into the
pavement. A student and fire
man were killed.
Wilbur writes that the Univer
sity was relieved that Jane wasn't
alive to see the damage, as that in
itself would have killed her. "It
was just a case of starting all over
again.
"Starting all over again" meant
immediately beginning restora
tion of the damaged buildings.
Wilbur writes that President Jor
dan issued a statement saying
that "the actual needs of the
growing University" would be
first considered.
"No backward" steps were
taken in repairs, nor were faculty
numbers reduced. For a while,
the University could not accept
any more students; the year after
the quake, students returned "in
greater number than ever he
fore."
President Jordan, Wilbur
writes, "drew some philosophi
cal lessons from the earthquake,
commenting that "forever man
must rise above his own crea
tions.' " The young university
soon fullv recovered.

Lpland Stanford Junior Unive
rsity was founded out of a very
simple but intense love and
memory of a mother and father
for their son, but its ideals were
so broad as to include the educa
tion of all children and tht; desire
to teach people to do something
useful with their lives.
I,eland Stanford was born in
1 Ml! 4 in Waterliet. New York. He
never received the university
education that was to mean so
much to him for others in the
founding of his university. In
stead, he was educated at coun
try schools and later apprenticed
himself to a law firm in Albany,
lie was admitted to the New
York and Wisconsin bars.
Ilis future wife. Jane Lathrop,
was born in Albany, New York,
in 1828. She was the daughter of
moderately well-to-do parents,
and received the normal private
school education that was fitting
for girls of her day.
The Stanfords were married in
1850. In 1852, Leland went alone
to San Francisco to begin his

business ventures. Jane stayed
behind in New York until 1855
to cure tor her ailing father, to
vyhom she was very close.
Settled in California
The Stanfords then moved to
Wisconsin, where they lived
until <i tragic fire destroyed Le
land's law library. To start a new
lite, they moved to Sacramento
via Nicaragua in 1856; I,eland's
father had told them that Califor
nia was the place to he.
In Sacramento, heland purch
ased his brothers' store, and then
began his political life. In 1858.
he helped to organize Sacramen
to's Republican party. Four years
later, he was chosen as a delegate
to the Chicago convention,
where he supported Lincoln.
Stanford gradually became
more of a political influence with
his election in 1881 as governor
of C California. As former Stanford
student, and later president. Kay
bvman Wilbur writes in his
memoirs, "as governor of
(California he had led in tin; bat
tle to keep California in the
I 'nion against those who wanted
it to follow the South or to set it
up as a separate republic." In
1885. he was to be elected to the
I 'nited States Senate.
Stanford museum docent and
i hairman of the Stanford Family
Portfolio Peg Haneberg says that
I .eland was a pacifist.
Arbitrator
"He believed that the standing
armies of Furope were a waste of
time and manpower." she says.
"Me believed that disputes

should be settled by arbitration."
The same year, 1861, Stanford
and three other men formed the
Central Pacific Railroad, of
which he later was elected pres
ident. Later, a series of compli
cated mergers consolidated sev
eral railroads into the Central
Pacific System.
Ralph Hansen, chief librarian
at tht; University libraries, says
that Leland and his three as
sociates'were known as the "big
four."
"He has been characterized by
some historians as a robber ba
ron." he adds. "If he was really
so despicable he wouldn't have
been liked so much by his
employees."
At first the railroad was consi
dered to be a risky financial ven
ture. but it later proved to be a
most lucrative investment, as it
was later to help support the
University. To celebrate the first
transcontinental line, Leland
drove a golden spike in a cere
mony in Promontory, Utah, in
18(H).

Stanford's business adven
tures allowed him some measure
of play. In 1870 he bought his
first race horse, named Occident.
He later bred, trained and raced
horses very successfully; one
year his horse won a world's re
cord. When the horse died, Ken
tucky racers were relieved.
An investment in the Califor
nia Street Cable Railroad
Franchise made Stanford an
even wealthier man. He tried to
talk his influential friends into
investing in the company, but
only a few were willing to take
the chance; he bought most of
the shares himself.
The cable was completed in
1877. Because Stanford never
did anything halfway, the cable
was made the best in the world
by a new method of molding
concrete. In spite of the low
five-cent fare for riding the cable
cars, the stock eventually made
him an even wealthier man.
Stanford wasn't successful at
everything. In 1881 he bought a
vineyard in Vina. Ca., and tried
to make table wine. According to
Haneberg, he invested a lot of
money in wine and made good
brandy, but never got good table
wine.
'Farmer at heart'
I lansen says that Stanford was
a "farmer at heart," and
made his first money by selling
crops he grew himself.
'He was a pioneer ot viticul
ture." he continues. "The
reasons for his failure at Vina

were soil problems." Stanford
planted 3000 acres of grapes
from France for champagne, but
they failed and became brandy.
His Weidel Winery at Mission
San lose still produces success
fully.
Jane had meanwhile made her
husband her career, and the two
were very close. Because of her
husband's many personal and
business interests, she knew
many famous people, traveled
widely, and lived well. And after
her husband's death, she suc
cessfully kept the University
running despite legal and finan
cial complications with the es
tate.
Hansen says that "Jane's out
standing characteristic was that
she was deeply religious. Her
life centered in her belief in im
mortality and Jesus Christ." Jane
supported Catholic charities, but
neither she nor Leland belonged
to any particular church. At the
University's dedication, both a
rabbi and a bishop officiated at
the ceremony.
Charitable
"She was charitable, but she
didn't toot her horn about it,"
Hansen continues. "She estab
lished kindergartens in Menlo
Park and San Francisco. She was
involved in women's suffrage,
and supported Susan B. An
thony. She was ahead of her
time."
In his memoirs, Wilbur de
scribes Jane as "never a beautiful
woman — some thought she re
sembled Queen Victoria in gen
eral appearance, which rather
pleased her. She had a com
manding presence and friendly
dignity which only a great heart,
courage and strong convictions
and character can Rive."
Up until their 18th year of mer
riage.the Sanfords remained
childless. Finally, in 1808 in
Sacramento, Leland Jr. was born.
Jane was 40 at the time of his
birth; according to Stanford Art
Museum docent Glenda North
way. he was her "precious
jewel."
Leland Jr had everything a
child could want. He was taken
on trips abroad, was educated by
the best tutors. For a while he
attended Heald Business College
in San Francisco.
Unspoiled
Yet Haneberg says that he
wasn't spoiled; research has it
that as a child his uncle bought
him a pair of boots he had been
longing for. He loved tht? boots,
and slept in them the first night.
The next day, he saw a poor boy
who had no shoes, so Leland |r.
gave him his boots.
Hansen says that Leland Jr..
was vej-y intelligent, had a good
sense of humor and enjoyed
playing boyish pranks. Yet "he
was brought up to be aware of
the responsibilities that wealth
brought."
In his memoirs, Wilbur writes
that Leland and Jane had a
"happy and dignified home life"
and trained their son in a "sensi
ble and careful way . . . for re
sponsibility that be would
handle wisely and wel I their vast
fortune which they thought
would become his. . ."
The joys of parenthood were
not long to last for Leland and
Jane. While the family was vaca
tioning in Istanbul, Leland Jr.
contracted typhoid fever. He got
worse in Naples and Rome, and
in 1884 died in Florence. He was
18.
Tremendous blow
The Stanfords had been very
close; the loss of an only child
was a tremendous blow. When
Leland Jr. died, his father sank
into a coma from the shock.
In his father's dreams, it is said
that Leland Jr. appeared and
said, "live for humanity." When
he awoke. Leland said. "Califor
nia's children shall be my chil
dren." Thus Leland founded Le
land Stanford Junior University.
Jane, as a memorial to her son,
established the Leland Stanford
Junior Museum. Museums were
her son's passion and lifelong
dream; the fall he was 16. he had
planned to enter Harvard and
study courses pertaining to the
running of a museum.
Today, the museum has as
permanent collections pottery,
weavings and sculpture that tin?
Stanfords brought back from
their many European travels.
And a room devoted entirely to
the Stanford family has the per
sonal boyhood mementos of Le
land Jr.. as well as paintings of
the family.
Cornerstone laid
The cornerstone for the new
I Jniversitv was laid on May 14 in
1887 — it would have been Le
land Ir. 's HMh birthday. In a cop
per box in the cornerstone, the

Stanfords placed, among other
documents pertaining to the or
ganization of the University, a
photograph of their son. The
University was to open four
years later.
According to Wilbur, Sen.
Stanford had no trouble choos
ing the site for hisllniversity.Al
though the Stanfords had vari
ous houses. Palo Alto was home,
so be chose his Palo Alto Farm.
'The Senator's opinion,"
writes Wilbur, "was that any
place that was good for raising
race horses ought to be good for
students."
Wilbur continues, "1 particu
larly liked Mr. Stanford's idea ol
what education should be. that it
should be for 'direct usefulness
in life.' He wanted it to break
away from the tradition-bound
classical and philosophical
programs of some of the older
eastern institutions, and to de
velop along the more practical
anil scientific lines in which
Cornell University, the Johns
Hopkins University and the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology were pioneering,
(ordan first president
"He wanted for president of
the new Western institution a
man of courage and initiative,
scientifically trained, who could
see and try new ways of doing
things. Such a man he found in
David Starr Jordan."
Wilbur, who entered Stanford
in 1802, writes of his early im
pressions of the physical expan
siveness and vastness of the
University "We came along El

Gamino Real, then a narrow dirt
road. . . We swung up to the
University buildings, which
were then only what we call now
the Inner Quadrangle (Memorial
Church had not yet been built).
"With the buff sandstone wall,
red-tiled roofs, and long
sandstone arcades they were de
lightfully different from any
educational buildings we had
ever seen."
Unlike many universities,
from the beginning Stanford was
coed. Girls were housed in Roble
Hall; the men in Encina Hall.
Hansen says that Encina has
been "slowly remodeled" and
now houses offices, the
Economics Department anil the
Food Research Institute.
Women 'favored'
Jane was not particularly
pleased that women were ac
cepted at Stanford; I lanebrg says
that Leland"favored"women. But
Jane went along with her
husband's wishes, and in spite of
hei misgivings, women were re
spected and given equal rights.
To welcome the women. Jane
gave tea parties at their Palo Alto
home, the site of the present
Children's Hospital.
Hansen explains that "the
founding grant doesn't prohibit
women; in 1800. women began
to increase. Jane became con
cerned that more women than
men would attend the Univer
sity that had been dedicated to
her son."
He adds that a clause to the
founding grant prohibited more
than 500 women. "Up until the
early 30s. they were known as
the 'Stanford 500.' It was later
rescinded by the trustees."
No tuition
In the early days there was no
tuition; Leland believed that all
his "children" should be enti
tled to an education. Students

were responsible for paying
their own miscellaneous ex
penses, and the University
charged $4.50 weekly for room
and board.
Wilbur writes that in his first
year at Stanford, one of those
miscellaneous expenses was
laundry. A "quiet, friendly
chap" came to Wilbur's room at
Encina anil asked if Wilbur
wanted to send his laundry to a
"San Jose company of which he
was the Stanford agent. He
promptly got my limited busi
ness." The quiet, friendly chap
was Herbert Hoover.
Stanford suffered the usual
growing pains that any new

educational institution could be
expected to encounter. Wilbur
writes that "not only was the
university undergoing organiza
tion, with educational processes
in debate at practically every
meeting of the faculty, but the
students themselves were
likewise developing their own
organizations their athletic
teams, their debating, literary
and musical societies and frater
nities. . . .

"A good many . . . new tradi
tions evaporated with one trial,
some lasted a little longer, a few
became a lasting part of Stanford
life. With the trial and error
method there developed, good
leadership and some rather un
ique and appropriate customs. . .
We were starting from the very
beginning."
Stanford's death
In spite of its growing pains,
the University continued
smoothly enough for two years.
But the young University was
devastated by the death of its
founder in 1893.
There was some question if the
University could survive finan
cially after Leland's death. The

estate was tied up in court tor
some time. Jane, who had a mas
sive jewelry collection second
only to the queen of England, es
tablished the Jewel Fund, the
money of which was used to pay
for salaries and books.
Hansen says that because of
Jane's firm, single-minded de
termination to do what she
wanted, she "plunged full speed
ahead" to save the University.
'When Leland died, the

lawyers advised her to close tin;
University," Hansen says. "She
refused, saying, 'If the school
closed down 1 would have no
thing to live tor.' The University
became her son; every energy
and dollar mustered wept to the
University. It was part of her
Christian zeal."
In 1905, Jane died.
Confusion
There was much confusion as
to the cause of her death. Wilbur
and Haneberg concur that death
was caused by a heart attack.
Rumors at the time had it that
she was poisoned with
strychnine by a maid . . . "as was
headlined in some of the more
sensational newspapers," writes
Wilbur.
Jane's body was placed, along
with her husband and son, in the
mausoleum, set apart from the
main grounds in a grove of oak
trees.
Another shock was to come to
the University, this time in the
form of the massive 1906 ear

from the beginning Stanford was
coed. Girls were housed in Roble
Hall; the men in Encina Hall.
Hansen says that Encina has
been "slowly remodeled" and
now houses offices, the
Economics Department anil the
Food Research Institute.
Women 'favored'
Jane was not particularly
pleased that women were ac
cepted at Stanford; I lanebrg says
that Leland"favored"women. But
Jane went along with her
husband's wishes, and in spite of
hei misgivings, women were re
spected and given equal rights.
To welcome the women. Jane
gave tea parties at their Palo Alto
home, the site of the present
Children's Hospital.
Hansen explains that "the
founding grant doesn't prohibit
women; in 1800. women began
to increase. Jane became con
cerned that more women than
men would attend the Univer
sity that had been dedicated to
her son."
He adds that a clause to the
founding grant prohibited more
than 500 women. "Up until the
early 30s. they were known as
the 'Stanford 500.' It was later
rescinded by the trustees."
No tuition
In the early days there was no
tuition; Leland believed that all
his "children" should be enti
tled to an education. Students

were responsible for paying
their own miscellaneous ex
penses, and the University
charged $4.50 weekly for room
and board.
Wilbur writes that in his first
year at Stanford, one of those
miscellaneous expenses was
laundry. A "quiet, friendly
chap" came to Wilbur's room at
Encina anil asked if Wilbur
wanted to send his laundry to a
"San Jose company of which he
was the Stanford agent. He
promptly got my limited busi
ness." The quiet, friendly chap
was Herbert Hoover.
Stanford suffered the usual
growing pains that any new

educational institution could be
expected to encounter. Wilbur
writes that "not only was the
university undergoing organiza
tion, with educational processes
in debate at practically every
meeting of the faculty, but the
students themselves were
likewise developing their own
organizations their athletic
teams, their debating, literary
and musical societies and frater
nities. . . .

"A good many . . . new tradi
tions evaporated with one trial,
some lasted a little longer, a few
became a lasting part of Stanford
life. With the trial and error
method there developed, good
leadership and some rather un
ique and appropriate customs. . .
We were starting from the very
beginning."
Stanford's death
In spite of its growing pains,
the University continued
smoothly enough for two years.
But the young University was
devastated by the death of its
founder in 1893.
There was some question if the
University could survive finan
cially after Leland's death. The

estate was tied up in court tor
some time. Jane, who had a mas
sive jewelry collection second
only to the queen of England, es
tablished the Jewel Fund, the
money of which was used to pay
for salaries and books.
Hansen says that because of
Jane's firm, single-minded de
termination to do what she
wanted, she "plunged full speed
ahead" to save the University.
'When Leland died, the

lawyers advised her to close tin;
University," Hansen says. "She
refused, saying, 'If the school
closed down 1 would have no
thing to live tor.' The University
became her son; every energy
and dollar mustered wept to the
University. It was part of her
Christian zeal."
In 1905, Jane died.
Confusion
There was much confusion as
to the cause of her death. Wilbur
and Haneberg concur that death
was caused by a heart attack.
Rumors at the time had it that
she was poisoned with
strychnine by a maid . . . "as was
headlined in some of the more
sensational newspapers," writes
Wilbur.
Jane's body was placed, along
with her husband and son, in the
mausoleum, set apart from the
main grounds in a grove of oak
trees.
Another shock was to come to
the University, this time in the
form of the massive 1906 ear
thquake. The new Outer Quad,
much of the museum, the lib
rary, the gym, arches and Jane's
beloved, recently-built Memo
rial Church were badly dam
aged. The statue of biologist
Agassiz, located in front of Jor
dan Hall, fell headfirst into the
pavement. A student and fire
man were killed.
Wilbur writes that the Univer
sity was relieved that Jane wasn't
alive to see the damage, as that in
itself would have killed her. "It
was just a case of starting all over
again.
"Starting all over again" meant
immediately beginning restora
tion of the damaged buildings.
Wilbur writes that President Jor
dan issued a statement saying
that "the actual needs of the
growing University" would be
first considered.
"No backward" steps were
taken in repairs, nor were faculty
numbers reduced. For a while,
the University could not accept
any more students; the year after
the quake, students returned "in
greater number than ever he
fore."
President Jordan, Wilbur
writes, "drew some philosophi
cal lessons from the earthquake,
commenting that "forever man
must rise above his own crea
tions.' " The young university
soon fullv recovered.
