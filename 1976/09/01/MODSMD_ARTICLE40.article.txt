# Bug Me

### Patty Fels 
Daily columnist Patty Fels became famous last
year for having an answer to every question. Al
though she refused to reveal any of her sources,
the student population trusted her as the local
font of wisdom and gossip. Patty has gone on to
bigger and better things, but the Daily hopes to
continue "Bug Me" in the Fels tradition. Mean
while. here are a few of Patty's more illuminating
answers to some worthwhile questions.
What is that song that the Hand plays over and
over at footbull games? It's played every time ive
score a point. -F.H.
The song is called "Come Join the Band." and
the non-obscene lyrics (consult the Stanford Band
for any others) go like this:
dome join the band
And give a cheer for Stanford red.
Throughout the land.
Our banners waving overhead.
Stanford for you.
Our loyal comrades brave and true.
With might and main, sing this refrain.
Forever and forever. Stanford red.
Next time you're at a game, stand up and sing it
lustily. With that kind of spirit we might even beat
the big ones â€” like San Jose State.

Could you please print the words to the Cal fight
song? I think we should give the freshmen an
opportunity to learn them. -D.S.
There are actually two versions of the Cal fight
song. The proper one goes like this:
The dirty golden bear
is losing all his hair.
His teeth are out
He's got the gout
He don't know what it's all about.
His eyes are made of glass
He's losing all his class.
So take your dirty golden bear

And shove him up your ass.
The other version is simply a parody of the first.
Here's how it goes:
Our sturdy golden bear
is watching from the sky.
Looks down upon our colors fair
And guides us from his lair.
Our banner gold and blue
The symbol of it true.
Means fight for California
For California through and through.
We don't know where that second version came
from. But we heartily recommend that you sing
the first one (and loudly) whenever the Cal
Weenie Hand strikes up the inspiring ditty.

What is the average coarse load of a Stanford
studenf? -/.IV.
The Registrar's office says that the average stu
dent completes about 16 units per quarter.
What's (he real story behind becoming a "Stan
ford Woman"? -/.M.
There is a tradition officially known as "the
making of a Stanford Woman" and is described in
the Daily (Sept. 25. 1964) in this way:
"No Stanford undergraduate woman is consi
dered a true Stanford Woman until she has been
kissed by a Stanford senior, at twelve midnight,
under a full moon, in the middle of the Quad."
Apparently, this was once an old and hallowed
tradition on nights of the full moon. Seniors and
their girlfriends would gather .it the middle of the
Quad in what was called Senior Circle. Crowds of
freshmen would also turn out for the event, armed
with water balloons. At the stroke of midnight
there would be much kissing and balloon throw
ing, and countless wet but happy coeds would
leave the Circle, secure in the knowledge that they
were women at last.
