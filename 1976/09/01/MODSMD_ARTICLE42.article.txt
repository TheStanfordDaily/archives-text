# Even though they 'aren't boneheads'
## Students have trouble writing 
### John Burner 
A few months ago a Newsweek
magazine cover story on "Why
Johnny (ian't Write" exposed the
inadequate writing skills in
American high schools and col
leges.
The following excerpt from a
college freshman's paper was
used as an example: "It's obvi
ous. in our modern world of
today theirs a lot of impreci.se
ness in expressing thoughts we
have."
Although some Stanford stu
dents might jokingly attribute
this piece ot prose to a typical
freshman at (!al. no one in the
English Department here is
laughing. Eor in the past few
years one fact has become in
creasingly evident: "Johnny"
lias come to Stanford.
The problem was apparent last
fall, when Wilfred Stone, direc
tor of "Freshman English." ad
ministered an English place
ment test to the 17H freshmen
who received a score of 700 or
better on the College Entrance
Examination Hoard (CiEEB) En
glish Achievement Test. After
assessing their writing, a com
mittee ol five "Freshman En
glish" teachers and other faculty
passed only students.
Few exempt
In addition. 74 freshmen pas
sed tin! CEEB Advanced Place
ment English Test with a grade
ol 4 or 5. Therefore, only 117
freshmen wore exempted from

the writing requirement, out of a
class of 1502.
Stone stresses, however, that
the test results do not reflect on
the intelligence of the students,
but simply on their lack of prac
tice in expressing their thoughts
on paper.
"They are anything hut
boneheads." he says. "We just
felt that they needed at least a
quarter, probably two quarters,
of work. . . . With errors just in
spelling and punctuation they
probably would have been pas
sed. But the problems were usu
ally problems of logic, of organi
zation, of being able to direct
one's attention to the point."
Stone and Teaching Adminis
trator Joe O'Mealy supervise a
staff of 45 "Freshman English"
instructors, most of them Ph.D.
candidates, to combat these de
ficiencies by teaching writing
workshops, theme courses and
tutorials.
Parts of speech
Some of the instructors ex
pressed surprise at their stu
dents' unfamiliarity with basic
grammar. They cannot identify
the parts of speech, such as ad
verbs, adjectives and preposi
tions.
"They don't have the gram
matical knowledge that we had
when we went through school."
notes Mickiko Widigen, a Ph.D.
candidate in comparative litera
ture who teaches a writing work
shop course. "They have taken

language for granted."
Instructors also observe that
the students tend to express their
thoughts in abstract, general
terms, rather than in specific,
concrete language.
"The biggest thing I've noted
is the total disregard for preci
sion." John Bishop, a Ph.D. can
didate in English, says."The
language is so general that you
don't know what's going on."
Arouse motivation
The instructors generally ag
ree. however, that the most for
midable part of their task is not
teaching basic grammar and the
mechanics of writing. Instead, it
is to arouse the students' motiva
tion to improve their writing.
"The heart of any composition
class is getting the wheels spin
ning. getting the students in
terested in a subject or a prob
lem. getting them in the state of
mind where they want to write,
want to express themselves,"
Stone says.
"When that occurs you can
handle problems of grammar,
logic, organization and all the
rest of it easily, because there is a
desire to communicate, to be
clear. Motivation is the prime
thing. That's why it makes a lot
of difference whether the
'Freshman English' teacher is an
interesting teacher or not."
The instructors' skill and en
thusiasm appear to have paid off,
since most have reported in
creased motivation among many

of their students.
"At the end of the quarter
some instructors are resentful of
what they feel is sort of a sub
standard effort by the students,
but I think for the most part
they're fairly pleased with the
majority of them," O'Mealy says.
The instructors' enthusiasm is
an important and influential fac
tor. But stimulating student in
terest in composition is an uphill
battle, because for many stu
dents practicality often over
comes enthusiasm.
A required writing workshop
with a pass-no-credit option
simply isn't high priority for the
pre-medical student who is
struggling for an "A" in his
Chemistry 31 class.
Furthermore, college students
still question the value and prac
ticality of a writing course be
cause the importance of good
writing was probably never
stressed by their high school
teachers.
"There has been a tendency in
the high schools which is now
reversing itself, I think, to not
teach writing, to turn to the subject
matter, to teach existentialism,
to teach urban blight and stuff
like that and just not get around
to writing. ... So you get stu
dents here who have virtually
never written and had corrected
a singleessay," Stone points out.
Departmental jargon
Stone says the University
must reemphasize clear writing.
He notes that frequently stu
dents are not required to pro
duce concise, clear writing for
their courses in other depart
ments and, in addition, are
forced to adopt departmental
jargon.

"When a student says to the
'Freshman English' teacher. 'If 1
wrote, the way you're asking me
to write, on my sociology papers.
I'd flunk.' what answer do you
give?" Stone asks. "Among
other things, it points out that
there are several languages in
the University.... 1 think that
part of our job is to declare war
on bad writing, on unnecessary
verbiage, unnecessary jargon
and doublethink, wherever they
are found in the University, in
cluding the English Depart
ment."
Stone's insistent opinion,
however, does not cloak a kind
of English Department "siege
mentality" in the face of the in
creased prestige of the sciences.
He stresses that the University
must openly recognize that
"Freshman English" is "a ser
vice, not just to freshmen who
need the writing requirement,
but for the University as a whole,
that we need more courses di
rected to the University as a
whole, inviting students to come
in after their freshman year if
they want more writing.
"I hope to offer four or five
courses in directed writing next
year aimed at that clientele, but
I'm not sure that (the School of)
Humanities and Sciences is en
tirely happy about funding it."
he says.
" 'Freshman English' has al
ways been a 'bargain basement'
operation for the University, and
I think the University should
subsidize it more generously
than it does. We do compara
tively well in the area of instruc
tor salaries but not so well in the
area of class size," he adds.
