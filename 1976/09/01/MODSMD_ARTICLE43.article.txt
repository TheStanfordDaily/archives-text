Adjusting to rigorous uni
versity classes is difficult for
most students, but lack of
working knowledge of English
can seriously hinder academic
performance.
The Stanford program in En

(EFS), under theauspices of the
Linguistics Department, pro

comprehension, speaking and
writing.
According to Senior Linguis
tics Lecturer Freida Politzer.
"We've expanded to include a
variety of classes geared to fit
specific needs." In addition to
basic English skills, the prog
ram includes courses in
academic orientation, voc
abulary expansion, note
taking. and the presentation of
theses and term papers.
Each foreign student, prior to
acceptance into a graduate
program, is required to take the
Test ol English as a Foreign
Language (TOEFL), adminis
tered by the Educational Test
ing Service. The composite
score determines whether the
student will be exempted from
the Stanford English Place
ment Test or will be required to
take English classes before en
rolling in his degree program.
Proficiency level
"On the basis of the Place
ment Test, which includes an
interview, we decide how
many units of English classes
each student should take,"
explained Politzer. "We have a

responsibility to the student
and his academic department
to help him attain a level of pro
ficiency in English adequate
for his academic needs."
Many of the students in the
EFS program are graduates in
engineering, earth sciences,
education, or related fields.
"We have to arrange our
schedule around student's
schedules," said Polit/.er. "We
also offer an intensive program
in summer which helps pre
pare in-roming students forthe
next academic year."
Funding tor the program
comes from the School of
Humanities and Sciences. Lin
guistics lecturer Meverley
McChesney commented. "We
make up just a small part of the
Linguistics Department
budget."
'English the tool'
"English is the tool," said
Politzer. "not the result. We
want their pronunciation to be
good enough for them to speak
in a seminar or class. Getting
their degree is their goal . . .
and ours too."
McChesney noted that. "We
see some amazing results."
Katsumi Muraki. a graduate
student in statistics, has taken
several of the EFS courses and
has gone on lo audit a class in
methods of teaching English to
foreign students. "He's one of
our most interested students,"
said Politzer.
both McChesney and

each student should take,"
explained Politzer. "We have a

responsibility to the student
and his academic department
to help him attain a level of pro
ficiency in English adequate
for his academic needs."
Many of the students in the
EFS program are graduates in
engineering, earth sciences,
education, or related fields.
"We have to arrange our
schedule around student's
schedules," said Polit/.er. "We
also offer an intensive program
in summer which helps pre
pare in-roming students forthe
next academic year."
Funding tor the program
comes from the School of
Humanities and Sciences. Lin
guistics lecturer Meverley
McChesney commented. "We
make up just a small part of the
Linguistics Department
budget."
'English the tool'
"English is the tool," said
Politzer. "not the result. We
want their pronunciation to be
good enough for them to speak
in a seminar or class. Getting
their degree is their goal . . .
and ours too."
McChesney noted that. "We
see some amazing results."
Katsumi Muraki. a graduate
student in statistics, has taken
several of the EFS courses and
has gone on lo audit a class in
methods of teaching English to
foreign students. "He's one of
our most interested students,"
said Politzer.
both McChesney and
Politzer agree that for the stu
dents, the value of getting to
know other foreign students is
a very important aspect of the
program.
Adjusting to rigorous uni
versity classes is difficult for
most students, but lack of
working knowledge of English
can seriously hinder academic
performance.
The Stanford program in En
glish tor Foreign Students
(EFS), under theauspices of the
Linguistics Department, pro
vides foreign graduate stu
dents with a structured prog
ram tor improvement in aural
comprehension, speaking and
writing.
According to Senior Linguis
tics Lecturer Freida Politzer.
"We've expanded to include a
variety of classes geared to fit
specific needs." In addition to
basic English skills, the prog
ram includes courses in
academic orientation, voc
abulary expansion, note
taking. and the presentation of
theses and term papers.
Each foreign student, prior to
acceptance into a graduate
program, is required to take the
Test ol English as a Foreign
Language (TOEFL), adminis
tered by the Educational Test
ing Service. The composite
score determines whether the
student will be exempted from
the Stanford English Place
ment Test or will be required to
take English classes before en
rolling in his degree program.
Proficiency level
"On the basis of the Place
ment Test, which includes an
interview, we decide how
many units of English classes
each student should take,"
explained Politzer. "We have a

responsibility to the student
and his academic department
to help him attain a level of pro
ficiency in English adequate
for his academic needs."
