# Up against the wall
## Palo Alto's still-life residents 
### Mark Bamberger 
On the corner of University
and YVaverly Avenues in Palo
Alto, a man stands in a trench
(.oat with a turned-up collar. His
hands are deep in his pockets
and the brim of his hat rests on
his dark glasses. Motionless, he
watches what goes on about him.
At Wideman's men's store on
I 'niversity, a masked burglar in a
jump suit has just landed on the
root. He is looking around, hur
riedly trying to decide which
way to go. His partner, a simi
larly attired woman, is close be
hind sliding down a rope that
hangs over the wall from which
they dropped.
At University and Cowper.
there is a woman in a heavy coat
with a pelican on a leash.
These are not real people.
Rather, they are the work of artist
CJreg Brown. 24. ol Palo Alto.
Sincp January, he has painted
several similar characters on the
walls of Palo Alto buildings.

Brown is working on Palo Al
to's "art in public places" project
and is funded by a federal Com
prehensive Employment Train
ing Act grant.
If you've been in Palo Alto,
perhaps you've seen his "wall
people." If you have, and if you
were shocked, amazed, scared or
maybe just amused, then Brown
has achieved his goal.
Brown says he is a "funster"
who enjoys "watching people
see something unusual." This
shows up not only in his art but
in the rest of his life as well.
He is a "master of surprise,"
according to his wife. Julie. Sht;
recalls that in the San Francisco
apartment in which he lived he
had a coffin for a couch.
Macabre phase
Visitors to his small but com
fortable home are greeted by
what Brown says is part of the
"macabre phase" that he went
through. On a shelf outside the
front door rest two brittle animal

skulls with a wax finger sticking
out of each.
Inside are many of his own
works, including several from
his recent "Vegetables on Vaca
tion" show. In one piece,
humanized fruits and vegetables
with arms and legs battle each
other. In the picture, a banana,
armed with a knife, cuts a bell
pepper in two, just as it is about
to stab a helpless tomato with a
fork.
All over Palo Alto people
enjoy talking about how they
were fooled by Brown's work.
One woman said she once asked
directions from the pictureof the
man pushing his cat in a cart.
Another admits that she was
once afraid to cross the street be
cause "the spy" scared her.
"The spy" has had the police
called on him three times, and he
has been attacked once. "But
he's asking for it." Brown said
proudly.
Mystique
While many people are fasci
nated by his work. Brown's iden
tity frequently is a mystery-
Brown says he enjoys the mys
tique. but he sees no reason lor it.
as he is not at all secretive. In
broad daylight on Waverly Av
enue. he finished another
character, an old woman water
ing her plants.
Tall, lean and neatly dressed
in a loose, long-sleeved shirt and
a pair of slim-cut jeans, he casu

ally dabbed varnish on the arms
of the woman.
The piece is his latest surprise,
as the woman is his grandmother.
She does not know about it and
will not be told, he said. How
ever. he expects that she will see
it sooner or later. He chose his
grandmother, he says, "just to
make her happy."
As he worked passersbv con
stantly stopped and com
plimented him. "Thank you.
thank you very much." Brown
responded awkwardly.
"Aw, shucks." he said, at
tempting to find a new. cute way
to acknowledge the praise.
Mustachioed man
Later, he put on his dark glas
ses. smoothly lit up a cigarette
and sat comfortably on a nearby
staircase. People who stopped to
look at the new piece did not
realize that the handsome, mus
tachioed young man was at all
involved with the work.
Brown enjoys doing the wall
work because he feels it is
"people's art." "It is something
they can relate to," he said, "and
everyone feels a part of it." Un
like gallery art, he said, "people
are not intimidated by it."
Although he has now com
pleted six wall pieces, he said
the project came about uninten
tionally. He was simply "doodl
ing" while working on other city
projects, he said, when he came
up with the trench-coated man.

He "liked him so much as a
character" that he had to find a
place for him.
He says he "conned" the
owner of the Palo Alto Drug Co.
into letting him put the man up
outside the store. That was the
only one that he planned to do,
he said.
I hat was it as far as I was
concerned," he said. Hut people
became so excited about it that
Brown continued to do them.
The attention he has been get
ting is new for Brown, and he

readily admits that he enjoys it.
"It is pleasant to say the least,"
he said.
"1 was always a super loiv-*-."
he said, hut this project has
"brought me out of my shell."
"For the first time in my life,"
he said, "1 have a real sense of
community, and 1 dig it."
Brown, a Palo Alto High
School graduate, worked in a
local gallery while in high
school — he said he "hardly
went to school." At 17, when he
graduated, he knew that he

wanted to be an artist. "It was all
1 was ever interested in." he said.
Brown's federal grant termi
nates in July, at which point he
will no longer be working for
Palo Alto. Just where his art will
take him in the future is at this
point uncertain, although lit!
says he has lined up a few pri
vate projects.
Wherever he goes, however.
Brown has seen to it that he and
his wife will not be "leaving"
Palo Alto. This is because they
are the "Wideman burglars."

himself and his wife (ulie as cat burglars on a downtown storef

"For the first time in my life,"

Brown, a Palo Alto High
School graduate, worked in a
local gallery while in high
school — he said he "hardly
went to school." At 17, when he
graduated, he knew that he

wanted to be an artist. "It was all
1 was ever interested in." he said.
Brown's federal grant termi
nates in July, at which point he
will no longer be working for
Palo Alto. Just where his art will
take him in the future is at this
point uncertain, although lit!
says he has lined up a few pri

Wherever he goes, however.
Brown has seen to it that he and
his wife will not be "leaving"
Palo Alto. This is because they
are the "Wideman burglars."


CAUCiHT IN THE ACT — Palo Alto artist Greg Brown depicted
himself and his wife (ulie as cat burglars on a downtown storef
ront. While this passerby appeared unperturbed, others have
reacted with surprise or amusement.
On the corner of University
and YVaverly Avenues in Palo
Alto, a man stands in a trench
(.oat with a turned-up collar. His
hands are deep in his pockets
and the brim of his hat rests on
his dark glasses. Motionless, he
watches what goes on about him.
At Wideman's men's store on
I 'niversity, a masked burglar in a
jump suit has just landed on the
root. He is looking around, hur
riedly trying to decide which
way to go. His partner, a simi
larly attired woman, is close be
hind sliding down a rope that
hangs over the wall from which
they dropped.
At University and Cowper.
there is a woman in a heavy coat
with a pelican on a leash.
These are not real people.
Rather, they are the work of artist
CJreg Brown. 24. ol Palo Alto.
Sincp January, he has painted
several similar characters on the
walls of Palo Alto buildings.

Brown is working on Palo Al
to's "art in public places" project
and is funded by a federal Com
prehensive Employment Train
ing Act grant.
If you've been in Palo Alto,
perhaps you've seen his "wall
people." If you have, and if you
were shocked, amazed, scared or
maybe just amused, then Brown
has achieved his goal.
Brown says he is a "funster"
who enjoys "watching people
see something unusual." This
shows up not only in his art but
in the rest of his life as well.
He is a "master of surprise,"
according to his wife. Julie. Sht;
recalls that in the San Francisco
apartment in which he lived he
had a coffin for a couch.
Macabre phase
Visitors to his small but com
fortable home are greeted by
what Brown says is part of the
"macabre phase" that he went
through. On a shelf outside the
front door rest two brittle animal

skulls with a wax finger sticking
out of each.
Inside are many of his own
works, including several from
his recent "Vegetables on Vaca
tion" show. In one piece,
humanized fruits and vegetables
with arms and legs battle each
other. In the picture, a banana,
armed with a knife, cuts a bell
pepper in two, just as it is about
to stab a helpless tomato with a
fork.
All over Palo Alto people
enjoy talking about how they
were fooled by Brown's work.
One woman said she once asked
directions from the pictureof the
man pushing his cat in a cart.
Another admits that she was
once afraid to cross the street be
cause "the spy" scared her.
"The spy" has had the police
called on him three times, and he
has been attacked once. "But
he's asking for it." Brown said
proudly.
Mystique
While many people are fasci
nated by his work. Brown's iden
tity frequently is a mystery-
Brown says he enjoys the mys
tique. but he sees no reason lor it.
as he is not at all secretive. In
broad daylight on Waverly Av
enue. he finished another
character, an old woman water
ing her plants.
Tall, lean and neatly dressed
in a loose, long-sleeved shirt and
a pair of slim-cut jeans, he casu

ally dabbed varnish on the arms
of the woman.
The piece is his latest surprise,
as the woman is his grandmother.
She does not know about it and
will not be told, he said. How
ever. he expects that she will see
it sooner or later. He chose his
grandmother, he says, "just to
make her happy."
As he worked passersbv con
stantly stopped and com
plimented him. "Thank you.
thank you very much." Brown
responded awkwardly.
"Aw, shucks." he said, at
tempting to find a new. cute way
to acknowledge the praise.
Mustachioed man
Later, he put on his dark glas
ses. smoothly lit up a cigarette
and sat comfortably on a nearby
staircase. People who stopped to
look at the new piece did not
realize that the handsome, mus
tachioed young man was at all
involved with the work.
Brown enjoys doing the wall
work because he feels it is
"people's art." "It is something
they can relate to," he said, "and
everyone feels a part of it." Un
like gallery art, he said, "people
are not intimidated by it."
Although he has now com
pleted six wall pieces, he said
the project came about uninten
tionally. He was simply "doodl
ing" while working on other city
projects, he said, when he came
up with the trench-coated man.

He "liked him so much as a
character" that he had to find a
place for him.
He says he "conned" the
owner of the Palo Alto Drug Co.
into letting him put the man up
outside the store. That was the
only one that he planned to do,
he said.
I hat was it as far as I was
concerned," he said. Hut people
became so excited about it that
Brown continued to do them.

and sat comfortably on a nearby
staircase. People who stopped to
look at the new piece did not
realize that the handsome, mus
tachioed young man was at all
involved with the work.
Brown enjoys doing the wall
work because he feels it is
"people's art." "It is something
they can relate to," he said, "and
everyone feels a part of it." Un
like gallery art, he said, "people
are not intimidated by it."
Although he has now com
pleted six wall pieces, he said
the project came about uninten
tionally. He was simply "doodl
ing" while working on other city
projects, he said, when he came
up with the trench-coated man.

He "liked him so much as a
character" that he had to find a
place for him.
He says he "conned" the
owner of the Palo Alto Drug Co.
into letting him put the man up
outside the store. That was the
only one that he planned to do,
he said.
I hat was it as far as I was
concerned," he said. Hut people
became so excited about it that
Brown continued to do them.
The attention he has been get
ting is new for Brown, and he

readily admits that he enjoys it.
"It is pleasant to say the least,"
he said.
"1 was always a super loiv-*-."
he said, hut this project has
"brought me out of my shell."
"For the first time in my life,"
he said, "1 have a real sense of
community, and 1 dig it."
Brown, a Palo Alto High
School graduate, worked in a
local gallery while in high
school — he said he "hardly
went to school." At 17, when he
graduated, he knew that he

wanted to be an artist. "It was all
1 was ever interested in." he said.
Brown's federal grant termi
nates in July, at which point he
will no longer be working for
Palo Alto. Just where his art will
take him in the future is at this
point uncertain, although lit!
says he has lined up a few pri
vate projects.
Wherever he goes, however.
Brown has seen to it that he and
his wife will not be "leaving"
Palo Alto. This is because they
are the "Wideman burglars."


CAUCiHT IN THE ACT — Palo Alto artist Greg Brown depicted
himself and his wife (ulie as cat burglars on a downtown storef
ront. While this passerby appeared unperturbed, others have
reacted with surprise or amusement.
On the corner of University
and YVaverly Avenues in Palo
Alto, a man stands in a trench
(.oat with a turned-up collar. His
hands are deep in his pockets
and the brim of his hat rests on
his dark glasses. Motionless, he
watches what goes on about him.
At Wideman's men's store on
I 'niversity, a masked burglar in a
jump suit has just landed on the
root. He is looking around, hur
riedly trying to decide which
way to go. His partner, a simi
larly attired woman, is close be
hind sliding down a rope that
hangs over the wall from which
they dropped.
At University and Cowper.
there is a woman in a heavy coat
with a pelican on a leash.
These are not real people.
Rather, they are the work of artist
CJreg Brown. 24. ol Palo Alto.
Sincp January, he has painted
several similar characters on the
walls of Palo Alto buildings.

Brown is working on Palo Al
to's "art in public places" project
and is funded by a federal Com
prehensive Employment Train
ing Act grant.
If you've been in Palo Alto,
perhaps you've seen his "wall
people." If you have, and if you
were shocked, amazed, scared or
maybe just amused, then Brown
has achieved his goal.
Brown says he is a "funster"
who enjoys "watching people
see something unusual." This
shows up not only in his art but
in the rest of his life as well.
He is a "master of surprise,"
according to his wife. Julie. Sht;
recalls that in the San Francisco
apartment in which he lived he
had a coffin for a couch.
Macabre phase
Visitors to his small but com
fortable home are greeted by
what Brown says is part of the
"macabre phase" that he went
through. On a shelf outside the
front door rest two brittle animal

skulls with a wax finger sticking
out of each.
Inside are many of his own
works, including several from
his recent "Vegetables on Vaca
tion" show. In one piece,
humanized fruits and vegetables
with arms and legs battle each
other. In the picture, a banana,
armed with a knife, cuts a bell
pepper in two, just as it is about
to stab a helpless tomato with a
fork.
All over Palo Alto people
enjoy talking about how they
were fooled by Brown's work.
One woman said she once asked
directions from the pictureof the
man pushing his cat in a cart.
Another admits that she was
once afraid to cross the street be
cause "the spy" scared her.
"The spy" has had the police
called on him three times, and he
has been attacked once. "But
he's asking for it." Brown said
proudly.
Mystique
While many people are fasci
nated by his work. Brown's iden
tity frequently is a mystery-
Brown says he enjoys the mys
tique. but he sees no reason lor it.
as he is not at all secretive. In
broad daylight on Waverly Av
enue. he finished another
character, an old woman water
ing her plants.
Tall, lean and neatly dressed
in a loose, long-sleeved shirt and
a pair of slim-cut jeans, he casu

ally dabbed varnish on the arms
of the woman.
The piece is his latest surprise,
as the woman is his grandmother.
She does not know about it and
will not be told, he said. How
ever. he expects that she will see
it sooner or later. He chose his
grandmother, he says, "just to
make her happy."
As he worked passersbv con
stantly stopped and com
plimented him. "Thank you.
thank you very much." Brown
responded awkwardly.
"Aw, shucks." he said, at
tempting to find a new. cute way
to acknowledge the praise.
Mustachioed man
