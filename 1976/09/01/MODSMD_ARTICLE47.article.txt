## Chris wants to 'finish strong' Season kicks off with Cordova on top 
### Chris Baker 
For the past three seasons, Stan
ford's football team has gotten off to a
slower crawl than GOP Presidential
loser Ronald Reagan. But each season
after getting off to a poor start, the
(lards have won five of their last six
games.
Last year coach Jack Christiansen's
(lardinals turned an early 1 -3-1 mark to
a respectable 6-4-1 bv season's end.
That mark was good enough for third
place in the Pacific-8, just one game
back of co-champions UCLA and
California.
(Ihristidnsen hopes to change things
around this year.
"Our goal." says the fifth-year Stan
lord coach, "is to start strong and
finish strong. We're going to go after
every game on our schedule more ag
gressively than ever before."
Hut one thing hasn't changed.
Quarterback controversy
Stanford still has two fine quarter
backs and until one is clearly superior
to the other in game situations, the
great quarterback debate will con
tinue.
Benjamin or Cordova? Cordova or
Benjamin? This question has caused
alumni to call for Christiansen's con
tract. students to boo the team and
Daily cartoonists to draw uncom
plimentary pictures of Christiansen.

Benjamin finished as the starter last
year, but the intense Cordova was the
starter most of the year. He was under
more pressure than Notre Dame Coach
Dan Devine.
Christiansen has once again named
Cordova the starter, but he made it
clear that the designation is only tem
porary if Cordova lapses.
'Excellent quarterbacks'
"They're both excellent quarter
backs. I don't think it matters who
starts and our players are beginning to
realize that too," said Chris.
Cordova, 6-foot-3, 215, has a strong
arm but has been about as consistent as
gasoline prices. Last year he com
pleted .459 of his passes for 1311 yards
and 11 touchdowns. He threw nine in
terceptions.
Benjamin, 6-3, 200, was a .586 pas
ser on 96 fewer attempts. He passed for
1046 yards, had ten touchdowns and
was intercepted eight times.
But many of the fans think Benjamin
is a miracle worker. Two years ago he
came off the bench to engineer a 22-20,
last-second win over California. Last
season he came off the bench again to
direct a 13-10 last second win over
use.
Benjamin or Cordova?
While the quarterback controversy
has been grabbing the headlines, the
fact that the Cards have the potential to

ivi n the conference has been obscured.
"This could be as explosive a team
as we've had in some time," said Chris
tiansen. "We have the best receiver in
the nation in Tony Hill, two outstand
ing quarterbacks in Cordova and Ben
jamin, a strong line, three good tight
ends and all our top runners are back
from last year."
Both quarterbacks benefit from
throwing to Hill, who is on the verge of
breaking career school receiving re
cords held by Gene Washington of the
San Francisco 49ers and two-time
Card All-American Bill McColl. whose
son. Duncan, is a prospective Ail-
American defensive end this year.
The 6-3, 185-pound Hill ranked
seventh nationally in receiving last
year with 55 catches for 916 yards and
seven touchdowns.
"Hill should be the first receiver
taken on the pro draft next year," says
Dallas Cowboys' Vice-President Gil
Brandt.
The Cards have always lived by the
pass. Stanford has never traditionally
been a running team, with such great
passers as Jim Plunkett and John
Brodie heading the aerial attack in the
past.
Running game
But Christiansen says he's never
been better fixed for runners from a
standpoint of speed, size and depth.
Don Stevenson, Ron Inge (who has
never played up to his full potential),
John Finley, Gary Lynn and DaveTenn
give the Cards their best backfield
since the Rose Bowl years.
Last year Stanford rushed for 1745
yards and 17 touchdowns. The backs
had the best rushing day in Stanford
history, running for 345 yards, as the
Cards demoralized hapless
Washington State 54-14.
They'll be operating behind an of
fensive line that averages over 250
pounds. It's the biggest line in school
history. Three starters return in All-

Coast guard Alex Karakazoff (6-3, 250),
junior tackel Gordy King (6-4,253) and
senior guard A 1 Tenßruggencate (6-3,
255), who switches to tackle.
Offensive line
"Karakazoff and King are two out
standing football players," said Christ
iansen. "We should have a good strong
line, though we lack depth."
Defensively, the Cards will drop the
"50" defensefora multiple front. "Cur
goal is to give people a lot of different
looks," said Christiansen. "We plan to
use some form of a four-man front most
of the time."
Leading the charge will be the 6-4,
245-pound McColl. The defensive
tackle, who was in on 139 tackles last
year, will rush from the left side.

Chuck Kvans, 6-4, 245, will slant from
the right side. The tackles are John
Harris and Jeff Kieburtz.
The Cards lost two good linebackers
to graduation, Ceb Church and Dan
Francis, but returns six lettermen, led
by sophomore Cordy Ceresino.
The Stanford secondary was spotty
at times last year, because it contained
two freshmen, but sophomore corner
backs Larry Reynolds and Savann
Thompson are a year older and hope
fully a year better. All-Coast safety

Rich Waters figures to add some ex
perience to the group.
Tough schedule
Last year the Cards played one of the
toughest schedules in the nation and
it's the same this year. Back-to-back
road games with nationally-ranked
Penn State and Michigan open the sea
son for Stanford.
The Nittany Lions shellacked Stan
ford last year, 34-14. But the Cards
came back the next week to tie Michi
gan 19-19.
Although Penn State was hit hard by
graduation, coach Joe Paterno will
come up with a good squad. The
Nittany Lions have won three in a row x
from the Cards.

The Wolverines were ranked first by
Sports Illustrated and they're ranked
second in both wire service polls. The
Cards have two relatively easy contests
after that, coming home to take on San
Jose State in ABC regionally televised
game and traveling to West Point to
take on Army.
The Pac-8 used to be jokingly refer
red to as "Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs." "Snow White," former USC
coach John McKay, is now in the NFL,
but USC is still the team to beat.
The Trojans are loaded, with Hesi
man Trophy candidate Ricky Bell

leading the way. The Trojans had their
three year Rose Bowl string snapped
by UCLA last year and as first-year
coach John Robinson says, "We don't
aspire to be average."
USC does have an average passer in
quarterback Vince Evans, who com
pleted under 40 percent of his passes
last year. It's unlikely that USC can
win their eighth Pac-8 title in 11 years
unless they improve in this depart
ment.
Christiansen and Cal coach Mike
White are now the dean of the Pac-8.
and this is only their fifth year.
White, whose Bears tied UCLA for
the Pac-8 crown, would love to go to
Pasadena this vear. and he has the po

tential to do it.
Although Ail-American run
ningback Chuck Muncie and premier
receiver Steve Rivera have graduated,
the Golden Bears still have Ail-
American quarterback Joe Roth. Roth
will be throwing to wide receiver Wes
ley Walker, who has run the 100-
meters in 10.1 and caught 36 passes for
839 yards last year.
Tom Newton, who rushed for 544
yards on 98 carries last year, moves
into Muncie's tailback spot. Newton
doesn't have the moves of Muncie. but

he certainly has his power.
The Bruins may have to come up
with a miracle to wind up in Pasadena
again. UCLA lost its coach. Dick Ver
meil. now of the Philadelphia Eagles,
and ils Mi-American quarterback.
John Sci.irra. The Bruins have to face a
seething W r oody Hayes, still smarting
from the Rose Bowl, in Columbus, be
fore opening the league.
The non-California schools don't
have the quality players to be in the
race. Washington, which tied Stanford
for third place by beating both UCLA
and USC, was hard hit by graduation
and is rebuilding.
The rest of the league is just build
ing.

gasoline prices. Last year he com
pleted .459 of his passes for 1311 yards
and 11 touchdowns. He threw nine in
terceptions.
Benjamin, 6-3, 200, was a .586 pas
ser on 96 fewer attempts. He passed for
1046 yards, had ten touchdowns and
was intercepted eight times.
But many of the fans think Benjamin
is a miracle worker. Two years ago he
came off the bench to engineer a 22-20,
last-second win over California. Last
season he came off the bench again to
direct a 13-10 last second win over
use.
Benjamin or Cordova?
While the quarterback controversy
has been grabbing the headlines, the
fact that the Cards have the potential to

ivi n the conference has been obscured.
"This could be as explosive a team
as we've had in some time," said Chris
tiansen. "We have the best receiver in
the nation in Tony Hill, two outstand
ing quarterbacks in Cordova and Ben
jamin, a strong line, three good tight
ends and all our top runners are back
from last year."
Both quarterbacks benefit from
throwing to Hill, who is on the verge of
breaking career school receiving re
cords held by Gene Washington of the
San Francisco 49ers and two-time
Card All-American Bill McColl. whose
son. Duncan, is a prospective Ail-
American defensive end this year.
The 6-3, 185-pound Hill ranked
seventh nationally in receiving last
year with 55 catches for 916 yards and
seven touchdowns.
"Hill should be the first receiver
taken on the pro draft next year," says
Dallas Cowboys' Vice-President Gil
Brandt.
The Cards have always lived by the
pass. Stanford has never traditionally
been a running team, with such great
passers as Jim Plunkett and John
Brodie heading the aerial attack in the
past.
Running game
But Christiansen says he's never
been better fixed for runners from a
standpoint of speed, size and depth.
Don Stevenson, Ron Inge (who has
never played up to his full potential),
John Finley, Gary Lynn and DaveTenn
give the Cards their best backfield
since the Rose Bowl years.
Last year Stanford rushed for 1745
yards and 17 touchdowns. The backs
had the best rushing day in Stanford
history, running for 345 yards, as the
Cards demoralized hapless
Washington State 54-14.
They'll be operating behind an of
fensive line that averages over 250
pounds. It's the biggest line in school
history. Three starters return in All-

Coast guard Alex Karakazoff (6-3, 250),
junior tackel Gordy King (6-4,253) and
senior guard A 1 Tenßruggencate (6-3,
255), who switches to tackle.
Offensive line
"Karakazoff and King are two out
standing football players," said Christ
iansen. "We should have a good strong
line, though we lack depth."
Defensively, the Cards will drop the
"50" defensefora multiple front. "Cur
goal is to give people a lot of different
looks," said Christiansen. "We plan to
use some form of a four-man front most
of the time."
Leading the charge will be the 6-4,
245-pound McColl. The defensive
tackle, who was in on 139 tackles last
year, will rush from the left side.

Chuck Kvans, 6-4, 245, will slant from
the right side. The tackles are John
Harris and Jeff Kieburtz.
The Cards lost two good linebackers
to graduation, Ceb Church and Dan
Francis, but returns six lettermen, led
by sophomore Cordy Ceresino.
The Stanford secondary was spotty
at times last year, because it contained
two freshmen, but sophomore corner
backs Larry Reynolds and Savann
Thompson are a year older and hope
fully a year better. All-Coast safety

Rich Waters figures to add some ex
perience to the group.
Tough schedule
Last year the Cards played one of the
toughest schedules in the nation and
it's the same this year. Back-to-back
road games with nationally-ranked
Penn State and Michigan open the sea
son for Stanford.
The Nittany Lions shellacked Stan
ford last year, 34-14. But the Cards
came back the next week to tie Michi
gan 19-19.
Although Penn State was hit hard by
graduation, coach Joe Paterno will
come up with a good squad. The
Nittany Lions have won three in a row x
from the Cards.

The Wolverines were ranked first by
Sports Illustrated and they're ranked
second in both wire service polls. The
Cards have two relatively easy contests
after that, coming home to take on San
Jose State in ABC regionally televised
game and traveling to West Point to
take on Army.
The Pac-8 used to be jokingly refer
red to as "Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs." "Snow White," former USC
coach John McKay, is now in the NFL,
but USC is still the team to beat.
The Trojans are loaded, with Hesi
man Trophy candidate Ricky Bell

leading the way. The Trojans had their
three year Rose Bowl string snapped
by UCLA last year and as first-year
coach John Robinson says, "We don't
aspire to be average."
USC does have an average passer in
quarterback Vince Evans, who com
pleted under 40 percent of his passes
last year. It's unlikely that USC can
win their eighth Pac-8 title in 11 years
unless they improve in this depart
ment.
Christiansen and Cal coach Mike
White are now the dean of the Pac-8.
and this is only their fifth year.
White, whose Bears tied UCLA for
the Pac-8 crown, would love to go to
Pasadena this vear. and he has the po

tential to do it.
Although Ail-American run
ningback Chuck Muncie and premier
receiver Steve Rivera have graduated,
the Golden Bears still have Ail-
American quarterback Joe Roth. Roth
will be throwing to wide receiver Wes
ley Walker, who has run the 100-
meters in 10.1 and caught 36 passes for
839 yards last year.
Tom Newton, who rushed for 544
yards on 98 carries last year, moves
into Muncie's tailback spot. Newton
doesn't have the moves of Muncie. but

he certainly has his power.
The Bruins may have to come up
with a miracle to wind up in Pasadena
again. UCLA lost its coach. Dick Ver
meil. now of the Philadelphia Eagles,
and ils Mi-American quarterback.
John Sci.irra. The Bruins have to face a
seething W r oody Hayes, still smarting
from the Rose Bowl, in Columbus, be
fore opening the league.
The non-California schools don't
have the quality players to be in the
race. Washington, which tied Stanford
for third place by beating both UCLA
and USC, was hard hit by graduation
and is rebuilding.
The rest of the league is just build
ing.

For the past three seasons, Stan
ford's football team has gotten off to a
slower crawl than GOP Presidential
loser Ronald Reagan. But each season
after getting off to a poor start, the
(lards have won five of their last six
games.
Last year coach Jack Christiansen's
(lardinals turned an early 1 -3-1 mark to
a respectable 6-4-1 bv season's end.
That mark was good enough for third
place in the Pacific-8, just one game
back of co-champions UCLA and
California.
(Ihristidnsen hopes to change things
around this year.
"Our goal." says the fifth-year Stan
lord coach, "is to start strong and
finish strong. We're going to go after
every game on our schedule more ag
gressively than ever before."
Hut one thing hasn't changed.
Quarterback controversy
Stanford still has two fine quarter
backs and until one is clearly superior
to the other in game situations, the
great quarterback debate will con
tinue.
Benjamin or Cordova? Cordova or
Benjamin? This question has caused
alumni to call for Christiansen's con
tract. students to boo the team and
Daily cartoonists to draw uncom
plimentary pictures of Christiansen.

Benjamin finished as the starter last
year, but the intense Cordova was the
starter most of the year. He was under
more pressure than Notre Dame Coach
Dan Devine.
Christiansen has once again named
Cordova the starter, but he made it
clear that the designation is only tem
porary if Cordova lapses.
'Excellent quarterbacks'
"They're both excellent quarter
backs. I don't think it matters who
starts and our players are beginning to
realize that too," said Chris.
Cordova, 6-foot-3, 215, has a strong
arm but has been about as consistent as

past.
Running game
But Christiansen says he's never
been better fixed for runners from a
standpoint of speed, size and depth.
Don Stevenson, Ron Inge (who has
never played up to his full potential),
John Finley, Gary Lynn and DaveTenn
give the Cards their best backfield
since the Rose Bowl years.
Last year Stanford rushed for 1745
yards and 17 touchdowns. The backs
had the best rushing day in Stanford
history, running for 345 yards, as the
Cards demoralized hapless
Washington State 54-14.
They'll be operating behind an of
fensive line that averages over 250
pounds. It's the biggest line in school
history. Three starters return in All-

Coast guard Alex Karakazoff (6-3, 250),
junior tackel Gordy King (6-4,253) and
senior guard A 1 Tenßruggencate (6-3,
255), who switches to tackle.
Offensive line
"Karakazoff and King are two out
standing football players," said Christ
iansen. "We should have a good strong
line, though we lack depth."
Defensively, the Cards will drop the
"50" defensefora multiple front. "Cur
goal is to give people a lot of different
looks," said Christiansen. "We plan to
use some form of a four-man front most
of the time."
Leading the charge will be the 6-4,
245-pound McColl. The defensive
tackle, who was in on 139 tackles last
year, will rush from the left side.

Chuck Kvans, 6-4, 245, will slant from
the right side. The tackles are John
Harris and Jeff Kieburtz.
The Cards lost two good linebackers
to graduation, Ceb Church and Dan
Francis, but returns six lettermen, led
by sophomore Cordy Ceresino.
The Stanford secondary was spotty
at times last year, because it contained
two freshmen, but sophomore corner
backs Larry Reynolds and Savann
Thompson are a year older and hope
fully a year better. All-Coast safety

Rich Waters figures to add some ex
perience to the group.
Tough schedule
Last year the Cards played one of the
toughest schedules in the nation and
it's the same this year. Back-to-back
road games with nationally-ranked
Penn State and Michigan open the sea
son for Stanford.
The Nittany Lions shellacked Stan
ford last year, 34-14. But the Cards
came back the next week to tie Michi
gan 19-19.
Although Penn State was hit hard by
graduation, coach Joe Paterno will
come up with a good squad. The
Nittany Lions have won three in a row x
from the Cards.

The Wolverines were ranked first by
Sports Illustrated and they're ranked
second in both wire service polls. The
Cards have two relatively easy contests
after that, coming home to take on San
Jose State in ABC regionally televised
game and traveling to West Point to
take on Army.
The Pac-8 used to be jokingly refer
red to as "Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs." "Snow White," former USC
coach John McKay, is now in the NFL,
but USC is still the team to beat.
The Trojans are loaded, with Hesi
man Trophy candidate Ricky Bell

leading the way. The Trojans had their
three year Rose Bowl string snapped
by UCLA last year and as first-year
coach John Robinson says, "We don't
aspire to be average."
USC does have an average passer in
quarterback Vince Evans, who com
pleted under 40 percent of his passes
last year. It's unlikely that USC can
win their eighth Pac-8 title in 11 years
unless they improve in this depart
ment.
Christiansen and Cal coach Mike
White are now the dean of the Pac-8.
and this is only their fifth year.
White, whose Bears tied UCLA for
the Pac-8 crown, would love to go to
Pasadena this vear. and he has the po

tential to do it.
Although Ail-American run
ningback Chuck Muncie and premier
receiver Steve Rivera have graduated,
the Golden Bears still have Ail-
American quarterback Joe Roth. Roth
will be throwing to wide receiver Wes
ley Walker, who has run the 100-
meters in 10.1 and caught 36 passes for
839 yards last year.
Tom Newton, who rushed for 544
yards on 98 carries last year, moves
into Muncie's tailback spot. Newton
doesn't have the moves of Muncie. but

he certainly has his power.
The Bruins may have to come up
with a miracle to wind up in Pasadena
again. UCLA lost its coach. Dick Ver
meil. now of the Philadelphia Eagles,
and ils Mi-American quarterback.
John Sci.irra. The Bruins have to face a
seething W r oody Hayes, still smarting
from the Rose Bowl, in Columbus, be
fore opening the league.
The non-California schools don't
have the quality players to be in the
race. Washington, which tied Stanford
for third place by beating both UCLA
and USC, was hard hit by graduation
and is rebuilding.
The rest of the league is just build
ing.

he a real treat — note the full stands of students neglecting their Saturday homework.
For the past three seasons, Stan
ford's football team has gotten off to a
slower crawl than GOP Presidential
loser Ronald Reagan. But each season
after getting off to a poor start, the
(lards have won five of their last six
games.
Last year coach Jack Christiansen's
(lardinals turned an early 1 -3-1 mark to
a respectable 6-4-1 bv season's end.
That mark was good enough for third
place in the Pacific-8, just one game
back of co-champions UCLA and
California.
(Ihristidnsen hopes to change things
around this year.
"Our goal." says the fifth-year Stan
lord coach, "is to start strong and
finish strong. We're going to go after
every game on our schedule more ag
gressively than ever before."
Hut one thing hasn't changed.
Quarterback controversy
Stanford still has two fine quarter
backs and until one is clearly superior
to the other in game situations, the
great quarterback debate will con
tinue.
Benjamin or Cordova? Cordova or
Benjamin? This question has caused
alumni to call for Christiansen's con
tract. students to boo the team and
Daily cartoonists to draw uncom
plimentary pictures of Christiansen.

Benjamin finished as the starter last
year, but the intense Cordova was the
starter most of the year. He was under
more pressure than Notre Dame Coach
Dan Devine.
Christiansen has once again named
Cordova the starter, but he made it
clear that the designation is only tem
porary if Cordova lapses.
'Excellent quarterbacks'
"They're both excellent quarter
backs. I don't think it matters who
starts and our players are beginning to
realize that too," said Chris.
Cordova, 6-foot-3, 215, has a strong
arm but has been about as consistent as
gasoline prices. Last year he com
pleted .459 of his passes for 1311 yards
and 11 touchdowns. He threw nine in
terceptions.
Benjamin, 6-3, 200, was a .586 pas
ser on 96 fewer attempts. He passed for
1046 yards, had ten touchdowns and
was intercepted eight times.
But many of the fans think Benjamin
is a miracle worker. Two years ago he
came off the bench to engineer a 22-20,
last-second win over California. Last
season he came off the bench again to
direct a 13-10 last second win over
use.
Benjamin or Cordova?
While the quarterback controversy
has been grabbing the headlines, the
fact that the Cards have the potential to

ivi n the conference has been obscured.
"This could be as explosive a team
as we've had in some time," said Chris
tiansen. "We have the best receiver in
the nation in Tony Hill, two outstand
ing quarterbacks in Cordova and Ben
jamin, a strong line, three good tight
ends and all our top runners are back
from last year."
Both quarterbacks benefit from
throwing to Hill, who is on the verge of
breaking career school receiving re
cords held by Gene Washington of the
San Francisco 49ers and two-time
Card All-American Bill McColl. whose
son. Duncan, is a prospective Ail-
American defensive end this year.
The 6-3, 185-pound Hill ranked
seventh nationally in receiving last
year with 55 catches for 916 yards and
seven touchdowns.
"Hill should be the first receiver
taken on the pro draft next year," says
Dallas Cowboys' Vice-President Gil
Brandt.
The Cards have always lived by the
pass. Stanford has never traditionally
been a running team, with such great
passers as Jim Plunkett and John
Brodie heading the aerial attack in the
past.

at times last year, because it contained
two freshmen, but sophomore corner
backs Larry Reynolds and Savann
Thompson are a year older and hope
fully a year better. All-Coast safety

Rich Waters figures to add some ex
perience to the group.
Tough schedule
Last year the Cards played one of the
toughest schedules in the nation and
it's the same this year. Back-to-back
road games with nationally-ranked
Penn State and Michigan open the sea
son for Stanford.
The Nittany Lions shellacked Stan
ford last year, 34-14. But the Cards
came back the next week to tie Michi
gan 19-19.
Although Penn State was hit hard by
graduation, coach Joe Paterno will
come up with a good squad. The
Nittany Lions have won three in a row x
from the Cards.

The Wolverines were ranked first by
Sports Illustrated and they're ranked
second in both wire service polls. The
Cards have two relatively easy contests
after that, coming home to take on San
Jose State in ABC regionally televised
game and traveling to West Point to
take on Army.
The Pac-8 used to be jokingly refer
red to as "Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs." "Snow White," former USC
coach John McKay, is now in the NFL,
but USC is still the team to beat.
The Trojans are loaded, with Hesi
man Trophy candidate Ricky Bell

leading the way. The Trojans had their
three year Rose Bowl string snapped
by UCLA last year and as first-year
coach John Robinson says, "We don't
aspire to be average."
USC does have an average passer in
quarterback Vince Evans, who com
pleted under 40 percent of his passes
last year. It's unlikely that USC can
win their eighth Pac-8 title in 11 years
unless they improve in this depart
ment.
Christiansen and Cal coach Mike
White are now the dean of the Pac-8.
and this is only their fifth year.
White, whose Bears tied UCLA for
the Pac-8 crown, would love to go to
Pasadena this vear. and he has the po

tential to do it.
Although Ail-American run
ningback Chuck Muncie and premier
receiver Steve Rivera have graduated,
the Golden Bears still have Ail-
American quarterback Joe Roth. Roth
will be throwing to wide receiver Wes
ley Walker, who has run the 100-
meters in 10.1 and caught 36 passes for
839 yards last year.
Tom Newton, who rushed for 544
yards on 98 carries last year, moves
into Muncie's tailback spot. Newton
doesn't have the moves of Muncie. but

he certainly has his power.
The Bruins may have to come up
with a miracle to wind up in Pasadena
again. UCLA lost its coach. Dick Ver
meil. now of the Philadelphia Eagles,
and ils Mi-American quarterback.
John Sci.irra. The Bruins have to face a
seething W r oody Hayes, still smarting
from the Rose Bowl, in Columbus, be
fore opening the league.
The non-California schools don't
have the quality players to be in the
race. Washington, which tied Stanford
for third place by beating both UCLA
and USC, was hard hit by graduation
and is rebuilding.
The rest of the league is just build
ing.

he a real treat — note the full stands of students neglecting their Saturday homework.
For the past three seasons, Stan
ford's football team has gotten off to a
slower crawl than GOP Presidential
loser Ronald Reagan. But each season
after getting off to a poor start, the
(lards have won five of their last six
games.
Last year coach Jack Christiansen's
(lardinals turned an early 1 -3-1 mark to
a respectable 6-4-1 bv season's end.
That mark was good enough for third
place in the Pacific-8, just one game
back of co-champions UCLA and
California.
(Ihristidnsen hopes to change things
around this year.
"Our goal." says the fifth-year Stan
lord coach, "is to start strong and
finish strong. We're going to go after
every game on our schedule more ag
gressively than ever before."
Hut one thing hasn't changed.
Quarterback controversy
Stanford still has two fine quarter
backs and until one is clearly superior
to the other in game situations, the
great quarterback debate will con
tinue.
Benjamin or Cordova? Cordova or
Benjamin? This question has caused
alumni to call for Christiansen's con
tract. students to boo the team and
Daily cartoonists to draw uncom
plimentary pictures of Christiansen.

Benjamin finished as the starter last
year, but the intense Cordova was the
starter most of the year. He was under
more pressure than Notre Dame Coach
Dan Devine.
Christiansen has once again named
Cordova the starter, but he made it
clear that the designation is only tem
porary if Cordova lapses.
'Excellent quarterbacks'
"They're both excellent quarter
backs. I don't think it matters who
starts and our players are beginning to
realize that too," said Chris.
Cordova, 6-foot-3, 215, has a strong
arm but has been about as consistent as
gasoline prices. Last year he com
pleted .459 of his passes for 1311 yards
and 11 touchdowns. He threw nine in
terceptions.
Benjamin, 6-3, 200, was a .586 pas
ser on 96 fewer attempts. He passed for
1046 yards, had ten touchdowns and
was intercepted eight times.
But many of the fans think Benjamin
is a miracle worker. Two years ago he
came off the bench to engineer a 22-20,
last-second win over California. Last
season he came off the bench again to
direct a 13-10 last second win over
use.
Benjamin or Cordova?
While the quarterback controversy
has been grabbing the headlines, the
fact that the Cards have the potential to

ivi n the conference has been obscured.
"This could be as explosive a team
as we've had in some time," said Chris
tiansen. "We have the best receiver in
the nation in Tony Hill, two outstand
ing quarterbacks in Cordova and Ben
jamin, a strong line, three good tight
ends and all our top runners are back
from last year."
Both quarterbacks benefit from
throwing to Hill, who is on the verge of
breaking career school receiving re
cords held by Gene Washington of the
San Francisco 49ers and two-time
Card All-American Bill McColl. whose
son. Duncan, is a prospective Ail-
American defensive end this year.
The 6-3, 185-pound Hill ranked
seventh nationally in receiving last
year with 55 catches for 916 yards and
seven touchdowns.
"Hill should be the first receiver
taken on the pro draft next year," says
Dallas Cowboys' Vice-President Gil
Brandt.
The Cards have always lived by the
pass. Stanford has never traditionally
been a running team, with such great
passers as Jim Plunkett and John
Brodie heading the aerial attack in the
past.
Running game
But Christiansen says he's never
been better fixed for runners from a
standpoint of speed, size and depth.
Don Stevenson, Ron Inge (who has
never played up to his full potential),
John Finley, Gary Lynn and DaveTenn
give the Cards their best backfield
since the Rose Bowl years.
Last year Stanford rushed for 1745
yards and 17 touchdowns. The backs
had the best rushing day in Stanford
history, running for 345 yards, as the
Cards demoralized hapless
Washington State 54-14.
They'll be operating behind an of
fensive line that averages over 250
pounds. It's the biggest line in school
history. Three starters return in All-

Coast guard Alex Karakazoff (6-3, 250),
junior tackel Gordy King (6-4,253) and
senior guard A 1 Tenßruggencate (6-3,
255), who switches to tackle.
Offensive line
"Karakazoff and King are two out
standing football players," said Christ
iansen. "We should have a good strong
line, though we lack depth."
Defensively, the Cards will drop the
"50" defensefora multiple front. "Cur
goal is to give people a lot of different
looks," said Christiansen. "We plan to
use some form of a four-man front most
of the time."
Leading the charge will be the 6-4,
245-pound McColl. The defensive
tackle, who was in on 139 tackles last
year, will rush from the left side.

Chuck Kvans, 6-4, 245, will slant from
the right side. The tackles are John
Harris and Jeff Kieburtz.
The Cards lost two good linebackers
to graduation, Ceb Church and Dan
Francis, but returns six lettermen, led
by sophomore Cordy Ceresino.
The Stanford secondary was spotty
at times last year, because it contained
two freshmen, but sophomore corner

White, whose Bears tied UCLA for
the Pac-8 crown, would love to go to
Pasadena this vear. and he has the po

tential to do it.
Although Ail-American run
ningback Chuck Muncie and premier
receiver Steve Rivera have graduated,
the Golden Bears still have Ail-
American quarterback Joe Roth. Roth
will be throwing to wide receiver Wes
ley Walker, who has run the 100-
meters in 10.1 and caught 36 passes for
839 yards last year.
Tom Newton, who rushed for 544
yards on 98 carries last year, moves
into Muncie's tailback spot. Newton
doesn't have the moves of Muncie. but

he certainly has his power.
The Bruins may have to come up
with a miracle to wind up in Pasadena
again. UCLA lost its coach. Dick Ver
meil. now of the Philadelphia Eagles,
and ils Mi-American quarterback.
John Sci.irra. The Bruins have to face a
seething W r oody Hayes, still smarting
from the Rose Bowl, in Columbus, be
fore opening the league.
The non-California schools don't
have the quality players to be in the
race. Washington, which tied Stanford
for third place by beating both UCLA
and USC, was hard hit by graduation
and is rebuilding.
The rest of the league is just build
ing.
