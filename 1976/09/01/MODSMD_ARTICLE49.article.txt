# Robber Barons stronger this year
## Watch Cross Country 
### 
This year will be a whole new
ball game so to speak for the
Stanford cross country team.
Last year the (lards were able
'to capture the Pac-8 Southern
Division championship, but
could muster only fifth place in
the finals on their home course at
the Stanford Golf course. That
meet was won by the powerful
Cougars of Washington State,
the fifth time they have reached
that goal in as many years.
This year Stanford will be
without the talents of Tony San
doval, the standout runner for
several years. In fact, the team is
almost "without a real star," ac
cording to coach Marshall Clark.
That may present some prob
lems during the coming season,
since cross country depends on

placing a few runners near the
front of the pack.
But Clark hopes to overcome
that the lack of a star by keeping
his runners together well at the
front. "We have seven of eight
runners who have trained well
over the summer," Clark said.
"Our grouping should be good
several of our people should be
out front. But watch for almost a
completely new team."
That will be the order of
things, as a new crop of runners
takes over. Near the top of his
list, Clark places Roy Kissin,
who did not run last year, but
chose to red shirt in order to
allow an injured thigh to heal
properly.
"Roy has worked hard," Clark
said. "And it looks as if he will

be strong this season."
In addition to Kissin, Clark is
placing high hopes on several
other runners. Jerry Emery, who
had the top time last year, is
back, as is Jeff Farietti, a three
year letterman who was voted
Most Improved by last year's
squad.
Stacy Geikin, a junior whose
specialty is the steeple chase,
has decided to give cross coun
trya try. Clark will also be count
ing on three year letterman
Frank Boutin, junior Steve
Crolie and Jeff Norton.
As far as new students'go,
Clark hopes the year will be a
good one. Greg Eger, a transfer
from DeAnza College will be in
the front. Clark is also betting on
freshmen David Corey and Bill
Haldeman.
Anyone interested in running
cross country who has been in
training during the summer,
should contact Marshall Clark in
the Track office.

his runners together well at the
front. "We have seven of eight
runners who have trained well
over the summer," Clark said.
"Our grouping should be good
several of our people should be
out front. But watch for almost a
completely new team."
That will be the order of
things, as a new crop of runners
takes over. Near the top of his
list, Clark places Roy Kissin,
who did not run last year, but
chose to red shirt in order to
allow an injured thigh to heal
properly.
"Roy has worked hard," Clark
said. "And it looks as if he will

be strong this season."
In addition to Kissin, Clark is
placing high hopes on several
other runners. Jerry Emery, who
had the top time last year, is
back, as is Jeff Farietti, a three
year letterman who was voted
Most Improved by last year's
squad.
Stacy Geikin, a junior whose
specialty is the steeple chase,
has decided to give cross coun
trya try. Clark will also be count
ing on three year letterman
Frank Boutin, junior Steve
Crolie and Jeff Norton.
As far as new students'go,
Clark hopes the year will be a
good one. Greg Eger, a transfer
from DeAnza College will be in
the front. Clark is also betting on
freshmen David Corey and Bill
Haldeman.
Anyone interested in running
cross country who has been in
training during the summer,
should contact Marshall Clark in
the Track office.
