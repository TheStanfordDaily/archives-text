# The diamond will shine
## Card Baseball: Getting stronger 
### Linda Buddenberg 
New coach. New league. New
Stanford program structure.
Afraid that the "good old
days" of Stanford baseball are
gone forever?
Now, just wait a minute. These
changes are not as radical as you
might think.
For one thing, the faces on the
field will be just about the same.
The team lost only four graduat
ing seniors last year. Although
the "new" coach is considering
playing some musical chairs
with infield positions, he'll be
drawing from an almost-intact
75-76 ball club.
"New?"
Actually, "new" would be
considered a misnomer to fans
who have been listening to
Coach Mark Marquess's "Huh,
now!" ringing across the
diamond for the past few years.
A former Stanford Ail-American
first baseman and assistant
coach here for the past five years.
Marquess was a natural to fill the
vacancy left by Ray Young's
move into the Athletic Depart
ment management hierarchy.
"I don't think the players will
have to make any big coaching
adjustments," said Marquess.
"They understand how 1 coach."
"We're going to be a similar
ballclub to last year," he con
tinued. "We have good speed
and not much power. We're
going to have to peck away at the
other team, just like we did last

year."
"The key is going to be pitch
ing — whether (John) Yandle has
a good year, if (Brian) Harrison
comes along. You've just got to
have strong pitching in a league
as strong as ours," Marques said.
Stotz arrives
Stanford will also be picking
up another familiar face for the
new assistant coach. Dean Stotz,
an ex-Cardinal pitcher who
coached the JV team in 1975,
will be returning to Stanford to
help Marquess.
"New" isn't really a good
word for the league structure,

either, according to Marquess.
"We're going back to the old
system, where we (the Southern
Division champs) play the
Northern champion, and the
winner gets automatic qualifica
tion for the NCAA playoffs,"
explained Marquess. The NCAA
changed back to this system be
cause they received "so much
criticism for not inviting UCLA
to the playoffs last year," he ad
ded.
The "new" Stanford program
is actually a step backwards — it
unfortunately involves the
elimination of the JV program

due to budget cuts.
"Since there's no JV program,
it'll change our style of coaching
a little bit at the beginning," said
Marquess. "Usually the fall is an
instructional period, but now
the players are going to have to
show me what they can do, since
I'll have to cut it down by
January."
Coach Marquess added that
anyone wishing to try out for the
team should get in touch with
him immediately, as there will
be a team meeting on September
28th, with practices starting on
the 29th.


JUST LIKE THE BABE —Tom Guardino, Card
baseball standout, is supposed to knock in the
homers this year. With a number of returners and

diamond.
