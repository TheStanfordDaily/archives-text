While Jack Christiansen's men
were busy out-controversying
each other on the gridiron last
year, a group of women athletes
were busy creating a large cam
pus following all the way across
campus.
If you searched around cam
pus and finally found your way
to the Roblefields, you were sure
to come across Stanford's wo
men's field hockey team. In a
short six-game season, the

scotchers turned their sport
into a well-watched and popular
event. Only about 20 devoted
friends or friends of 112 riends came
around to watch the first game of
the season, but by the final game,
a crowd of over 300 stood three
deep on the sidelines to watch
the scotchers pass and stick their
way to a heartbreaking loss and a
second-place finish behind San
lose State in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athle
tic Conference (NCIAC).
A fabulous second-place
showing shortly after at the
Western Regional Qualifers sent

the women off to Virginia for the
National Field Hockey Champ
ionships. From there, the season
turned a little less illustrious.
Field hockey has never been a
big participant sport on the west
coast, and Stanford surely
doesn't recruit field hockey
players out of high school, but
head coach Shirley Schoof and
assistant coach Carla Soracco
managed to find enough natural
talent at the school to fashion an
outstanding 5-0-1 team last sea
son.
Fred Hargadon, director of
admissions, after watching the
scotchers mil over a late-season
opponent, was even led to say,
"With talent like that, who needs
to recruit?"
He's right. And the women
will have another strong team
this year.
Offensive standouts Onnie
Killefer, Sukie Jackson and
Kathy Levinson all return this
season. Betsy Morris, last year's

captain and an outstanding
goalie, graduated, but Schoof
expects that one of two goalies
from last year's JV team will ably
replace her.
"The team is very experi
enced." Schoof said. "We have
all the talent and experience
needed tor a championship
team."
The scotchers will need it
again this year, because the route
they took to the nationals has
been closed oft. Only the first
place finisher in the Western Re
gionals will qualify for the na
tionals, so the Card women will
either have to oust San Jose State
from the conference champion
ship or will have to win the Reg
ionals.

season. Betsy Morris, last year's

captain and an outstanding
goalie, graduated, but Schoof
expects that one of two goalies
from last year's JV team will ably
replace her.
"The team is very experi
enced." Schoof said. "We have
all the talent and experience
needed tor a championship
team."
The scotchers will need it
again this year, because the route
they took to the nationals has
been closed oft. Only the first
place finisher in the Western Re
gionals will qualify for the na
tionals, so the Card women will
either have to oust San Jose State
from the conference champion
ship or will have to win the Reg
ionals.

SCOTCH—The women's field hockey team took second place in
the Western Regional Qualifying matches last year and expect
another winning season.
While Jack Christiansen's men
were busy out-controversying
each other on the gridiron last
year, a group of women athletes
were busy creating a large cam
pus following all the way across
campus.
If you searched around cam
pus and finally found your way
to the Roblefields, you were sure
to come across Stanford's wo
men's field hockey team. In a
short six-game season, the

scotchers turned their sport
into a well-watched and popular
event. Only about 20 devoted
friends or friends of 112 riends came
around to watch the first game of
the season, but by the final game,
a crowd of over 300 stood three
deep on the sidelines to watch
the scotchers pass and stick their
way to a heartbreaking loss and a
second-place finish behind San
lose State in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athle
tic Conference (NCIAC).
A fabulous second-place
showing shortly after at the
Western Regional Qualifers sent

the women off to Virginia for the
National Field Hockey Champ
ionships. From there, the season
turned a little less illustrious.
Field hockey has never been a
big participant sport on the west
coast, and Stanford surely
doesn't recruit field hockey
players out of high school, but
head coach Shirley Schoof and
assistant coach Carla Soracco
managed to find enough natural
talent at the school to fashion an
outstanding 5-0-1 team last sea
son.
Fred Hargadon, director of
admissions, after watching the
scotchers mil over a late-season
opponent, was even led to say,
"With talent like that, who needs
to recruit?"
He's right. And the women
will have another strong team
this year.
Offensive standouts Onnie
Killefer, Sukie Jackson and
Kathy Levinson all return this
season. Betsy Morris, last year's

captain and an outstanding
goalie, graduated, but Schoof
expects that one of two goalies
from last year's JV team will ably
replace her.
"The team is very experi
enced." Schoof said. "We have
all the talent and experience
needed tor a championship
team."
The scotchers will need it
again this year, because the route
they took to the nationals has
