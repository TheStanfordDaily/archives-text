# Home is where the Axe is
## The 						Axe: tradition with an edge 
### Chris Baker 
At the end of last year's 48-15
Hig Game farce, Cal's Rally
Committee came over to the
Stanford side to claim the prize
that goes to the winner of the
79-year old rivalry.
They picked up the 50-pound
plaque upon which the
Stanford-California Axe is
mounted and ran over to the
other side of Stanford Stadium.
They forgot one thing though.
You see. a Stanford band
member had removed the 10-
pound broad Axe from the
plaque. He was hiding it under
his pants.
The bandsman gave it back.
You see. when you steal the Axe
months of planning must go into
the venture. That's why it's only
been stolen eight times.
The Stanford Axe ranks right
up there with cherished football
trophies as the Indiana-Purdue
"Old Oaken Bucket" and the
Michigan-Michigan State "Little
Brown Jug."
Billy Erb
Why, Billy Erb would be
proud. Oh, he's the quarterback
who took us to the 1952 Rose
Bowl. Right?
No, you're dead wrong. Al
though Erb's picture doesn't
hang next to Jim Plunkett's, or
even Mike Cordova's, in the
football office, he's done more
for the Big Game than anyone.
It was Erb who started this
nonsense. And 75 years later, the

Axe:
—been fought over at sword
point;
—caused cancellation of clas
ses for two days in 1930;
—was heisted at a sportswrit
ers luncheon in a cross between
armed robbery and a con-game
worthy of The Sting.
And all this over a 10-pound
broad Axe with a 15-inch blade.
Actually the Axe yell preceeded
the Axe. Since 1896 it had been
used to symbolically taunt Cal.

But after losing the first two
games of a three-game baseball
series to the Bears, Billy Erb
came up with the marvelous idea
of getting a real Axe.
So in 1899, Erb brought an un
sharpened broad Axe to a pre
game bonfire and in a satanic
like ritual chopped up a dummy
bear. Charlie Manson would
have loved it.
Erb took the Axe up to the
game in San Francisco and cut
up blue and gold ribbons in his
idle pre-game hours. During the

game, which Stanford lost 9-7.
Erb walked around giving Gol
den Bear rooters a free sample of
his new improved razor.
After the contest Erb entrusted
the Axe to a group of guards in
cluding former Arizona Sen.
Carl Hayden. They were no
match for a Cal mob which in
cluded Bear football player Paul
Castlehun. The Cal people grab
bed it, then Stanford's Frank
Strout snatched it away momen
tarily, but it was taken from his
hands by Cal "wonder quarter
back" jim Hooper.
It remained in Berkeley for 31
years, locked in a bank vault and
was brought out for Cal rallies in
an armored car.
Enter the Immortal 21. On
April 3, 1930, after three years of
planning, this group returned
the Axe to its rightful owners.
Ray Walsh and Warren Cage
followed the armed truck back to
the bank, and posing as news
paper photographers, asked the
Cal freshmen guarding the
Trophy to pose for pictures.
But when the flashbulbs went
off, theCal idiots discovered that
they were teargas bombs. The
next day one Berkeley professor
said, "Gentlemen, this shows the
value of chemical warfare."
Howard Avery snatched the
Axe in the confusion which fol
lowed and tossed it into the back
of a rented Hertz car and headed
for the Farm.
The Immortal 21 was awarded

the highest award that can be
bestowed upon a Stanford stu
dent — block "S"letters — and
they won the gratitude of all
Stanford alumni.
But Cal students were talking
of violence, and officials from
both schools signed a pact, mak
ing t he Axe the Big Came trophy.
Thefts continued occasion
ally, but it was not until two
years ago that another grand
theft occured. Residents of Theta
Delta Chi, calling themselves the
"Infamous Three," imitated Cal
Coach Mike White and asked to
pick up the Axe for photos at the
Big Came luncheon at Ming's
Restaurant.
infamous Three'
Dave Silteanu and Tim Con
way arrived at the Cal Student
Union, where the Axe is kept in a
nuclear-attack-proof case after
Cal wins, and asked for the Axe.
But theCal Axe Commission had
taken the Axe down for
safekeeping. The pair convinced
the Union manager to call the
Axe Commission and produce
the Axe.
But there was one hitch. The
Cal people demanded that the
Axe ride in their car. Thinking
fast. Matt Conway, Tim's older
brother, used his last dime to call
for reinforcement at Ming's. But
when the car pulled into Ming's
there were no Theta Delts.
Suddenly they came out from
behind the parked cars and it
was no contest.
The Axe was home.

member had removed the 10-

You see. when you steal the Axe
months of planning must go into
the venture. That's why it's only
been stolen eight times.
The Stanford Axe ranks right

Billy Erb
Why, Billy Erb would be
proud. Oh, he's the quarterback
who took us to the 1952 Rose
Bowl. Right?
No, you're dead wrong. Al
though Erb's picture doesn't
hang next to Jim Plunkett's, or
even Mike Cordova's, in the
football office, he's done more
for the Big Game than anyone.
It was Erb who started this
nonsense. And 75 years later, the

Axe:
—been fought over at sword
point;
—caused cancellation of clas
ses for two days in 1930;
—was heisted at a sportswrit
ers luncheon in a cross between
armed robbery and a con-game
worthy of The Sting.
And all this over a 10-pound
broad Axe with a 15-inch blade.
Actually the Axe yell preceeded
the Axe. Since 1896 it had been
used to symbolically taunt Cal.

But after losing the first two
games of a three-game baseball
series to the Bears, Billy Erb
came up with the marvelous idea
of getting a real Axe.
So in 1899, Erb brought an un
sharpened broad Axe to a pre
game bonfire and in a satanic
like ritual chopped up a dummy
bear. Charlie Manson would
have loved it.
Erb took the Axe up to the
game in San Francisco and cut
up blue and gold ribbons in his
idle pre-game hours. During the

game, which Stanford lost 9-7.
Erb walked around giving Gol
den Bear rooters a free sample of
his new improved razor.
After the contest Erb entrusted
the Axe to a group of guards in
cluding former Arizona Sen.

It remained in Berkeley for 31
years, locked in a bank vault and
was brought out for Cal rallies in
an armored car.
Enter the Immortal 21. On
April 3, 1930, after three years of
planning, this group returned
the Axe to its rightful owners.
Ray Walsh and Warren Cage
followed the armed truck back to
the bank, and posing as news
paper photographers, asked the
Cal freshmen guarding the
Trophy to pose for pictures.
But when the flashbulbs went
off, theCal idiots discovered that
they were teargas bombs. The
next day one Berkeley professor
said, "Gentlemen, this shows the
value of chemical warfare."
Howard Avery snatched the
Axe in the confusion which fol
lowed and tossed it into the back
of a rented Hertz car and headed
for the Farm.
The Immortal 21 was awarded

the highest award that can be
bestowed upon a Stanford stu
dent — block "S"letters — and
they won the gratitude of all
Stanford alumni.
But Cal students were talking
of violence, and officials from
both schools signed a pact, mak

Union, where the Axe is kept in a
nuclear-attack-proof case after
Cal wins, and asked for the Axe.
But theCal Axe Commission had
taken the Axe down for
safekeeping. The pair convinced
the Union manager to call the
Axe Commission and produce
the Axe.
But there was one hitch. The
Cal people demanded that the
Axe ride in their car. Thinking
fast. Matt Conway, Tim's older
brother, used his last dime to call
for reinforcement at Ming's. But
when the car pulled into Ming's
there were no Theta Delts.
Suddenly they came out from

was no contest.
The Axe was home.

At the end of last year's 48-15

Stanford side to claim the prize

hang next to Jim Plunkett's, or
even Mike Cordova's, in the
football office, he's done more
for the Big Game than anyone.
It was Erb who started this
nonsense. And 75 years later, the

—caused cancellation of clas

—was heisted at a sportswrit

armed robbery and a con-game

And all this over a 10-pound
broad Axe with a 15-inch blade.
Actually the Axe yell preceeded
the Axe. Since 1896 it had been
used to symbolically taunt Cal.

But after losing the first two
games of a three-game baseball
series to the Bears, Billy Erb
came up with the marvelous idea
of getting a real Axe.
So in 1899, Erb brought an un
sharpened broad Axe to a pre
game bonfire and in a satanic
like ritual chopped up a dummy
bear. Charlie Manson would
have loved it.
Erb took the Axe up to the
game in San Francisco and cut
up blue and gold ribbons in his
idle pre-game hours. During the

Erb walked around giving Gol
den Bear rooters a free sample of
his new improved razor.
After the contest Erb entrusted
the Axe to a group of guards in

Strout snatched it away momen
tarily, but it was taken from his
hands by Cal "wonder quarter
back" jim Hooper.
It remained in Berkeley for 31
years, locked in a bank vault and
was brought out for Cal rallies in
an armored car.
Enter the Immortal 21. On
April 3, 1930, after three years of
planning, this group returned
the Axe to its rightful owners.
Ray Walsh and Warren Cage
followed the armed truck back to
the bank, and posing as news
paper photographers, asked the
Cal freshmen guarding the
Trophy to pose for pictures.
But when the flashbulbs went
off, theCal idiots discovered that
they were teargas bombs. The
next day one Berkeley professor
said, "Gentlemen, this shows the
value of chemical warfare."
Howard Avery snatched the
Axe in the confusion which fol

of a rented Hertz car and headed
for the Farm.
The Immortal 21 was awarded

the highest award that can be
bestowed upon a Stanford stu

nuclear-attack-proof case after
Cal wins, and asked for the Axe.
But theCal Axe Commission had
taken the Axe down for
safekeeping. The pair convinced
the Union manager to call the
Axe Commission and produce
the Axe.
But there was one hitch. The
Cal people demanded that the
Axe ride in their car. Thinking
fast. Matt Conway, Tim's older
brother, used his last dime to call
for reinforcement at Ming's. But
when the car pulled into Ming's
there were no Theta Delts.
Suddenly they came out from
behind the parked cars and it
was no contest.
The Axe was home.
