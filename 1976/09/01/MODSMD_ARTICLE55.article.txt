# Team is 'on its way up'
## Basketball has all it needs 
### Paul Bauman 
You lucky freshman basket
ball fans.
Over your next four years on
the Farm, you're going to see a
good, interesting Stanford team
without enduring all the boring,
agonizing, losing, lousy years
that came before. And there have
been plenty of them.
Stanford may even be a serious
Pacific-8 contender in a year or
two. Then, you might find it
hard to believe that basketball at
Stanford was once considered
just a "filler" sport to pass the
time between football and tennis
seasons.
In the past, Stanford just
hasn't had the coach or the
players to field a strong team.
Last year, it got the first item. I lis
name is Dick Dißiaso (pro
nounced Dee-BYF-So), a former
assistant to Digger Phelps at
Notre Dame.
The players
This year, Stanford has the
second item — the players.
I'reshman recruits Tom
Schmaltzreid, a 6-foot-10
center-forward from Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.; Kimberly Mel
lon. a 0-7 forward from New
York (lity and Doug Barnes, a 0-2
guard out of Lakewood/Colo.,
plus a pretty good nucleus of re
turning players give Stanford
the machinery it needs to win.
Now leave the driving to Di-
Biaso.
Stanford basketball is defi
nitely on its way up. and the
main reason is Dißiaso himself.
He's a confident, determined
coach and an aggressive recrui
ter.

Dißiaso inherited a team
which had lost four starters off a
squad that went 12-14 the previ
ous year. Adding to Stanford's
problems last season, the (lards
lost what little depth they had
due to injuries.
Stanford finished the 1975-76
season only 9-18, and 3-11 in the
Pac-8. hut even three league
wins was an accomplishment
considering that every Pac-8
team had better personnel than
the Cards. Opposing coaches
recognized Dißiaso's achieve
ments in his first year at Stanford
and named him co-Coach-of
the-Year along with Washington
State's (ieorge Raveling.
Now l)i Biaso has the players
he wants, instead of the players
somebody else wanted. Some
people considered Bel ton one of
the best forwards in New York
City last year. Schmaltzreid was
All-Florida last year, and has a
good outside shot and good
speed, according to Dißiaso.
Barnes was All-Colorado a year
ago and also ran the 100 and 220
in track.
Returning standouts
The top returning players are
sophomore guard Wolfe Perry,
senior guard Mike Bratz and
senior forward Ceorge Schader.
Perry is flashy and really de
veloped at the end of last season.
Bratz is a good ball-handler and
shooter. Schader looks like the
ideal football tight-end and is
murder under the boards. He
also has a nice outside shot.
Stanlord isn't going to set the
Pac-8 afire this year, but it might
not be too much to expect a win
ning season. The Cards haven't
had one of those in four years.

IN THE HOOP—Coach Dick Dißiaso says this year's team is "on its
way up" and looks forward to a winning season. Pans may see
better playing than they've watched for the last four years.
