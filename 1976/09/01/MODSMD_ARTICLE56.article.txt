Since arriving here from
DeAnza Junior College three
years ago, water polo coach Art
Lambert has rebuilt the Cardi
nals into a national power in the
sport.
Last year Lambert guided
Stanford to a fourth place finish
in the NCAA water polo champ
ionships. In 1974, his first year
on the Farm, he took a squad
which had finished fourth in the
Pacific-8 the year before and
guided it to a sixth place finish
in the tournament.
If that wasn't enough, the
former U.S. Olympic water polo
coach has just returned from the
Soviet Union, where he led his
Cards through a grueling 19-day
water polo tour.
Stanford made international
water polo history in 1974, by
hosting Moscow State in a two
game series.
A young Card team, composed
mostly of sophomores and
juniors played two games with
Moscow State, winning one and
tying the other.
Moscow's State water polo
squad was composed mainly of
players who participated on the
Soviet Olympic water polo team,

which finished in the top ten in
Montreal this summer.
The Cards also won two games
from a West German squad and
two games from a team from the
Netherlands. Lambert gave his
players some time off to see the
sights in Leningrad and Mos
cow.
With this grueling competi
tion under their belts, the Cards
should be well prepared for the

Pac-8 season. Last year three of
the top four finishers in the
NCAA tournament were from
the conference.
Stanford returns its leading
scorer sophomore Doug Burke.
Many Stanford followers
thought the Cards might have
won the NCAA tournament if
Burke had not suffered an eye
injury on the eve of Stanfords
first tournament game last
November.

OH NO YOU DON'l—With this kind of defense, it's easy to see
why the Stanford vvaterpolo team is fast making a name for itself.
Don't worry, that Bruin didn't score.
