# Team tees to better season
## 
### 
One of the brighter faces in the
Stanford Athletic offices this
year should be that of Golf coach
Bud Finger. After a very good
season last year, the entire team
is back, and should play even
better golf this season.
"We should be a little stronger
than last year," Finger said.
Last year's team managed to
put together some impressive
victories. Perhaps the brightest
spots of the season were in April,
when the Cards scored impres
sive showings in two major
tournaments.
It all began with a surprise vic
tory in the Western Division In
tercollegiate Nationals, when
the fifth ranked Cards upset
some fine competition, led by
junior Mike Peck.
A week later, the same squad,
led by Jay Johnson and Doug
Rice, took second place in the
Stanford US Invitational.
Finger hopes that consistency
will be the virtue of this year's

older team. "We had flashes of
brilliance last year," he said,
"but as far as holding it all to
gether, that was an entirely diffe
rent story."
One of the more disappointing
of the tourneys last year — de

spite the second place finish —
was the Stanford Invitational,
when the Cards hlew a first day
lead. That particular event
caused Finger to comment that,
"... one or two players had two
really good rounds, but then
dropped out by the fourth."
1 he Cards will be led this year
by junior Mike Peck, who ended
last year with a 73.8 average,
which is "not really low" ac
cording to Finger. Hut Peck did
manage some impressive statis
tics last year, notably was his
win in the Stanford Invitational.
In that effort, he recorded a total
of 212, the University record for
54 holes, which tied the Univer
sity record set by Tom Watson in
1971 when he was a senior. Wat
son is now on the pro golf tour.
If you have hopes of becoming
a Stanford golfer, but aren't quite
good enough yet, don't worry.
V ou can join "the pack," a group
of golfers who vie constantly for
the back positions on the team.
The organizational meeting
for the golf team will be held on
Oct. 28 at 5 p.m. at the course
Clubhouse.
