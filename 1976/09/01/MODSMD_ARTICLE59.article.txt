What are Stanford's athletic

An interesting ques
tion . . . that no one can answer.
A student election last year
found the "Robber Barons" the
popular name, but University
administrators insist the official
name is still the "Cardinals."
Where do Stanford's major

tests?

home games in Stanford
Stadium, the largest privately
owned stadium in the country.

home games in Roscoe Maples
Pavilion, which has a seating
capacity of 8000. The baseball
team plays in Sunken Diamond,
which is directly behind the
Stadium. The swimming and
water polo teams hold their
meets at DeGuerre Pools. The
track team uses Stanford
Stadium for its matches. The
tennis team uses the Tennis
Stadium for some of its contests
and switches to Maples for the
big matches.

Can anyone try out for a Stan

In major sports such as foot
ball. Stanford has had a higher
number of walk-ons than any
other conference school. But
don't expect to be a Jim Plunkett.
You'll probably be meeting a lot
of all-something high school

athletes here. Stanford still
fields junior varsity squads
though, and walk-ons have a
good chance of making these
squads.
