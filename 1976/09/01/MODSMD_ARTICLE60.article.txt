# They aren't cheerleaders
## Pompon Dollies are people, too 
### Linda Buddenberg 
"They sure don't look like any
other pompon girls I've ever
seen!"
"Typical dumb blonde
. . . what a bunch of puff
heads!"
"1 think the tall one is the
linebacker's girlfriend."
"They're obviously all pre
weo's here for their M.R.S. de
grees."
"How can anyone exploit
herself like that?"
"Who cares about the football
team? I come here to watch them
and the Band!"
"I'll say one thing — they sure
know how to dance!"
"Those girls have no dancing
talent whatsoever — they're just
down there to look pretty."
"I never knew that bodies
could . . . could . . . could wig
gle like that!"
No one agrees on anything
about the Stanford Dollies. Trad
itional enemies to women's lib

bers and darlings to the frats, ev
erything has been said about this
group. Whatever you've heard
about them is probably true: Dol
lies have been as diversified as
any other group of Stanford stu
dents.
One thing Dollies are not are
traditional cheerleaders. They're
the only Pacific-8 group which is
not a spirit organization; in
stead, they belong to the Band.
Consequently, Dollies have
different functions than spirit
groups from any other school.
Terry Bowman, '74-'75 Dollie
explains, "Alumni and coaches
ask us to lead cheers and appear
at all the athletic events; but
we're not cheerleaders we're
dancers. We go where the band
goes."
Also unlike other groups, Dol
lies can only be Dollies for one
year. "When you practice 50
hours a week in the fall, you can
only take it for one year," says
ex-Dollie Loretta Churchill.

"You burn out after that."
Tryouts are held in February
for the following year. Potential
Dollies learn a traditional
routine, then make up their own
routine, perform for judges, and
are interviewed by the Band.
Supposedly, with this proce
dure, the girls have to de
monstrate originality as well as
basic coordination ('74-'75 Dol
lie Denise Callardo remarks,
"When you have to make up
about 60 routines all by yourself,
you darn well better have some
good ideas!").
The interview started many,
many years ago in response to a
Southern Dollie who wouldn't
cooperate with the black girls in
her group. The band decided it
needed a screen against
"difficult-to-work-with" girls.
Now the interview mainly as
sures that the girls can cope with
the "hang loose" band style. As
Denise told potential Dollies at
trvouts, "If you're at all sensitive

about being flat-chested or
something, forget Dollies be
cause the Band gives you a lot of
shit about everything."
Build reputation
Every year's Dollies build up
their own reputation. While the
general Dollie style could be cal
led a cross between pompon and
jazz dancing, each group varies
slightly. Some groups are consi
dered more jazzy, some have a
classic pompon style.
Physically, too. each group is
different. No "typical" Dollie
exists. Ages have ranged from
sophomore to senior, and
heights have gone from tiny to
tall.
This year's group consists of
sophomores LynnePreslo, Heidi
Jacobsen, Kerrie Teage, Cathie
Pelton and senior Carla Murray.
