# The 						spring sport on the Farm
## Tennis team steals the show 
### Paul Bauman 
Stanford may have neither the
best men's tennis team in the
country nor the best women's
team, but combine the two, and
you probably have the nation's
best tennis program.
I hat seems a tair statement
after the Cardinal men and
women finished third and sec
ond in their respective national
collegiate championships last
spring and together placed nine
players on All-American teams.
The men (15-3 in dual matches
last year) held the early lead in
the 1976 NCAA Championships
at Corpus Christi, Tex., and re
mained in position to win the
tournament until the next-to-last
day of competition, but eventu

ally gave way to co-champions
USC and UCLA. All four Card
singles players — Pat DuPre, Bill
Maze, Mark Mitchell and Matt
Mitchell — made it to the
round-of-16, thereby earning
All-American status.
Stanford achieved its third
place finish without two of its
top players. Two-time All-
American Nick Saviano turned
pro at the beginning of last sea
son and Gene Mayer, the third
ranking amateur in the U.S. last
year, sat out virtually the whole
season with a smorgasbord of in
juries and illnesses.
New recruits
Men's coach Dick Gould has
recruited three players to help
offset the graduations of DuPre
and Mark Mitchell. The best
seems to be Jim Hodges of Chevy
Chase, Md. Hodges, a Junior
Davis Cupper, was the 10th
ranked junior in the country last
year.
The other recruits are Peter
Rennert, No. 12 in the 16-and
unders last year, from Great
Neck, N.Y. and Lloyd Bourne,
No. 15 in the 16-and-unders a
year ago, from Pasadena.
"They're three good, solid
players," Gould said. "One —
maybe two — has a good chance
to start right away. It's very im
portant that two of the three de
velop very quickly if we're to
have a contending team."
Thinking ahead to the 1977
season, Gould said a lot depends
on Mayer. Mayer has said he'll
return to Stanford for his senior
season.
"If Gene plays," Gould said,
"we'll have a great team. If he
doesn't, we'll have a verv good
team. It'll be a bonus if he plays."
Meanwhile, the Cards have

been playing on various summer
circuits. Mayer has been touring
Europe, including Wimbledon
in June. The senior from New
Jersey lost in the first round there
to Russian Alex Metreveli after
retiring in the second set with a
leg injury.
Maze and John Rast, the fifth
player on the Stanford ladder
last spring, have been playing on
the under-21 Davis Cup Team.
Maze also reached the finals in
the National Grass Court Champ
ionships at Newport. R.I.
Matt Mitchell and Perry
Wright, who played at the sixth
spot for the Cards last year, have
been playing on the Northwest
Circuit. Mitchell, a sophomore,
finished second overall on the
circuit, which put him directly
into the draw at Forest Hills.
Women's team
The women's team got some
bad news this summer when
Lele Forood, its No. 1 player last
season, decided to take the
1976-77 school year off to work
on her tennis. Women's coach
Anne Hill said Forood is not
ready to turn pro, but she's not to
return to school either. "We'll
miss her obviously," Hill said,
"but 1 think it was the right deci

sion for her."
The Cards do return three of
last year's most outstanding
freshmen in the country — Susie
Hagey, Barb Jordan, and Diane
Morrison. Each was named
All-American. along with
Forood and Marcy O'Keefe, after
the national collegiate champ
ionships at Salt Lake City in
June.
The women, who were 10-0 in
dual matches last year, lost the
championship to Trinity by one
point. Hagey and Morrison did
win the doubles title though.
Hill said there are no outstand
ing incoming freshmen because
of a poor overall group nation
all v.
Cardinal Notes:The Stanford
tennis team has been a real sttip
ping stone for several players
who made the break into the
pros. Roscoe Tanner, star of
years past, has done extremely
well making it to the final
rounds of Wimbleton for the past
two years. Last year two players
left the team before graduation.
Nick Saviano, eigth ranked ama
ture in the U.S. made the move as
a junior, and John Whitlinger,
the 1974 NCAA champion
turned pro also.

unders last year, from Great
Neck, N.Y. and Lloyd Bourne,
No. 15 in the 16-and-unders a
year ago, from Pasadena.
"They're three good, solid
players," Gould said. "One —
maybe two — has a good chance
to start right away. It's very im
portant that two of the three de
velop very quickly if we're to
have a contending team."
Thinking ahead to the 1977
season, Gould said a lot depends
on Mayer. Mayer has said he'll
return to Stanford for his senior
season.
"If Gene plays," Gould said,
"we'll have a great team. If he
doesn't, we'll have a verv good
team. It'll be a bonus if he plays."
Meanwhile, the Cards have

been playing on various summer
circuits. Mayer has been touring
Europe, including Wimbledon
in June. The senior from New
Jersey lost in the first round there
to Russian Alex Metreveli after
retiring in the second set with a
leg injury.
Maze and John Rast, the fifth
player on the Stanford ladder
last spring, have been playing on
the under-21 Davis Cup Team.
Maze also reached the finals in
the National Grass Court Champ
ionships at Newport. R.I.
Matt Mitchell and Perry
Wright, who played at the sixth
spot for the Cards last year, have
been playing on the Northwest
Circuit. Mitchell, a sophomore,
finished second overall on the
circuit, which put him directly
into the draw at Forest Hills.
Women's team
The women's team got some
bad news this summer when
Lele Forood, its No. 1 player last
season, decided to take the
1976-77 school year off to work
on her tennis. Women's coach
Anne Hill said Forood is not
ready to turn pro, but she's not to
return to school either. "We'll
miss her obviously," Hill said,
"but 1 think it was the right deci

sion for her."
The Cards do return three of
last year's most outstanding
freshmen in the country — Susie
Hagey, Barb Jordan, and Diane
Morrison. Each was named
All-American. along with
Forood and Marcy O'Keefe, after
the national collegiate champ
ionships at Salt Lake City in
June.
The women, who were 10-0 in
dual matches last year, lost the
championship to Trinity by one
point. Hagey and Morrison did
win the doubles title though.
Hill said there are no outstand
ing incoming freshmen because
of a poor overall group nation
all v.
Cardinal Notes:The Stanford
tennis team has been a real sttip
ping stone for several players
who made the break into the
pros. Roscoe Tanner, star of
years past, has done extremely
well making it to the final
rounds of Wimbleton for the past
two years. Last year two players
left the team before graduation.
Nick Saviano, eigth ranked ama
ture in the U.S. made the move as
a junior, and John Whitlinger,
the 1974 NCAA champion
turned pro also.

RALLY—Tennis standout Bill Maze reaches to make a return during one of last year's indoor
matches. The Cards play inside Maples several times each year.
Stanford may have neither the
best men's tennis team in the
country nor the best women's
team, but combine the two, and
you probably have the nation's
best tennis program.
I hat seems a tair statement
after the Cardinal men and
women finished third and sec
ond in their respective national
collegiate championships last
spring and together placed nine
players on All-American teams.
The men (15-3 in dual matches
last year) held the early lead in
the 1976 NCAA Championships
at Corpus Christi, Tex., and re
mained in position to win the
tournament until the next-to-last
day of competition, but eventu

ally gave way to co-champions
USC and UCLA. All four Card
singles players — Pat DuPre, Bill
Maze, Mark Mitchell and Matt
Mitchell — made it to the
round-of-16, thereby earning
All-American status.
Stanford achieved its third
place finish without two of its
top players. Two-time All-
American Nick Saviano turned
pro at the beginning of last sea
son and Gene Mayer, the third
ranking amateur in the U.S. last
year, sat out virtually the whole
season with a smorgasbord of in
juries and illnesses.
New recruits
Men's coach Dick Gould has
recruited three players to help
offset the graduations of DuPre
and Mark Mitchell. The best
seems to be Jim Hodges of Chevy
Chase, Md. Hodges, a Junior
Davis Cupper, was the 10th
ranked junior in the country last
year.

1976-77 school year off to work
on her tennis. Women's coach
Anne Hill said Forood is not
ready to turn pro, but she's not to
return to school either. "We'll
miss her obviously," Hill said,
"but 1 think it was the right deci

sion for her."
The Cards do return three of
last year's most outstanding
freshmen in the country — Susie
Hagey, Barb Jordan, and Diane
Morrison. Each was named
All-American. along with
Forood and Marcy O'Keefe, after
the national collegiate champ
ionships at Salt Lake City in
June.
The women, who were 10-0 in
dual matches last year, lost the
championship to Trinity by one
point. Hagey and Morrison did
win the doubles title though.
Hill said there are no outstand
ing incoming freshmen because
of a poor overall group nation

Cardinal Notes:The Stanford
tennis team has been a real sttip
ping stone for several players
who made the break into the
pros. Roscoe Tanner, star of
years past, has done extremely
well making it to the final
rounds of Wimbleton for the past
two years. Last year two players
left the team before graduation.
Nick Saviano, eigth ranked ama
ture in the U.S. made the move as
a junior, and John Whitlinger,
the 1974 NCAA champion
turned pro also.
