Among the new faces on the
Stanford soccer team this year
will be that of Nelson Lodge,
who has taken over coaching
duties from Fred Priddle, who
retired last year after over 50
years as head coach. Lodge
comes to the Farm from Hay
ward State, where in just four
years he led the Pioneers to a na
tional soccer reputation.
Lodge has impressive creden
tials even l>y Stanford standards.
He holds an A license from the
United States Soccer Associa
tion, the equivalent of a Ph.D. for
soccer coaches. He has played
and studied soccer in England,
Germany and Switzerland. In
addition, he was named Western
Division Soccer Coach of the
Year in 107f>. At forty, Lodge is
still a First Division soccer
player, which means he could
probably step right in to an
NCAA match.
Lodge will get his first real
look at the Robber Barons on
Sept. 1 1 when they report for
preseason training. Returning
from last year will be standouts
Jim Melamed at wing, fullback
Hobby Ceiger and forward Skip
Pfeiffer.
The schedule for this year is,
"very demanding." Lodge said.
" . . lots of teams have wanted
to play Stanford in the past, be
cause of the prestige and because
they were so easy to beat," he
said.
Lodge intends to employ the
newest and most efficient game
strategies. On defense, the Rob
ber barons will use the Dutch
Whirl, which Lodge describes as
"a soccer full court press." On
offense, they will use the
Oerman-Polish style which con
centrates on speedy attack rather
than building up a number of
players downfield.
"Soccer is a very physical
game, but also a very mental

game. Attitudes about yourself
and winning make all the differ
ence," Lodge said.
The budget for soccer is low,
but Lodge sees the sport on its
way up here. He cites attendance
at the Stanford summer soccer
clinic — almost 200 per week —
as evidence of soccer's growing
popularity.
Any serious players interested
in trying out for the fall season
should contact Nelson Lodge at
the Athletic office, or go to the
soccer field at 1 p.m.
Last year the Robber Barons
tried something new — soccer in
the Stanford Stadium. The occa
sion was the "Big Game"against
Cal, in which the booters cap
tured the Pellas trophy, soccer
equivalent to the Axe. An esti
mated 2000 fans watched the
Stanford booters down Cal 2-1.
This was quite a switch from
the normally sparse crowds at
soccer matches. In fact, many of
the players were besieged by
young fans for autographs. The
kids had attended a pregame
clinic where the Stanford
players demonstrated basic
game skills.
Last fall, Athletic Director Joe
Reutz agree on the funding is
sue. "To build up a sport," he
said, "You need promotion."
Part of that promotion may
come from the American Youth
Soccer Organization, a group de
termined to give soccer its just
place in the American sports
world.
According to Lodge, the
biggest problem in soccer is not a
lack of interest. "The problem
here is not that kids don't want to
play," he said, "but that there
aren't enough players."

place in the American sports
world.
According to Lodge, the
biggest problem in soccer is not a
lack of interest. "The problem
here is not that kids don't want to
play," he said, "but that there
aren't enough players."

DON'T SKlP—Skip Pfeiffer will be one of the mainstays of the
Robber Baron hooters this fall. Watch for soccer to boom under the
direction of new coach Nelson Lodge.
Among the new faces on the
Stanford soccer team this year
will be that of Nelson Lodge,
who has taken over coaching
duties from Fred Priddle, who
retired last year after over 50
years as head coach. Lodge
comes to the Farm from Hay
ward State, where in just four
years he led the Pioneers to a na
tional soccer reputation.
Lodge has impressive creden
tials even l>y Stanford standards.
He holds an A license from the
United States Soccer Associa
tion, the equivalent of a Ph.D. for
soccer coaches. He has played
and studied soccer in England,
Germany and Switzerland. In
addition, he was named Western
Division Soccer Coach of the
Year in 107f>. At forty, Lodge is
still a First Division soccer
player, which means he could
probably step right in to an
NCAA match.
Lodge will get his first real
look at the Robber Barons on
Sept. 1 1 when they report for
preseason training. Returning
from last year will be standouts
Jim Melamed at wing, fullback
Hobby Ceiger and forward Skip
Pfeiffer.
The schedule for this year is,
"very demanding." Lodge said.
" . . lots of teams have wanted
to play Stanford in the past, be
cause of the prestige and because
they were so easy to beat," he
said.
Lodge intends to employ the
newest and most efficient game
strategies. On defense, the Rob
ber barons will use the Dutch
Whirl, which Lodge describes as
"a soccer full court press." On
offense, they will use the
Oerman-Polish style which con
centrates on speedy attack rather
than building up a number of
players downfield.
"Soccer is a very physical
game, but also a very mental

game. Attitudes about yourself
and winning make all the differ
ence," Lodge said.
The budget for soccer is low,
but Lodge sees the sport on its
way up here. He cites attendance
at the Stanford summer soccer
clinic — almost 200 per week —
as evidence of soccer's growing
popularity.
Any serious players interested
in trying out for the fall season
should contact Nelson Lodge at
the Athletic office, or go to the
soccer field at 1 p.m.
Last year the Robber Barons
tried something new — soccer in
the Stanford Stadium. The occa
sion was the "Big Game"against
Cal, in which the booters cap
tured the Pellas trophy, soccer
equivalent to the Axe. An esti
mated 2000 fans watched the
Stanford booters down Cal 2-1.
This was quite a switch from
the normally sparse crowds at
soccer matches. In fact, many of
the players were besieged by
young fans for autographs. The
kids had attended a pregame
clinic where the Stanford
players demonstrated basic
game skills.
Last fall, Athletic Director Joe
Reutz agree on the funding is
sue. "To build up a sport," he
said, "You need promotion."
Part of that promotion may
come from the American Youth
Soccer Organization, a group de
termined to give soccer its just
place in the American sports
world.
According to Lodge, the
biggest problem in soccer is not a
lack of interest. "The problem
here is not that kids don't want to
play," he said, "but that there
aren't enough players."
