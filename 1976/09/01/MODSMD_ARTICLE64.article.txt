## Intramurals are great 
### 
You need not be a superstar to
participate in organized athle
tics at Stanford. Every year hun
dreds of students participate in
the intramural program who are
not jock types — but they enjoy it
just the same.
Intramural teams are or
ganized through living groups,
eating clubs, graduate schools
and social organizations. All IM
sports are co-ed, but there are
several all-women's events.
Teams are grouped in divisions,
which are in turn divided into
leagues. Each team must select a
manager, who represents his
team at intramural meetingsand
is responsible for seeing that
each team member is notified
about all games.
The organizational meeting
for the IM season will be at 4 p.m.
on Sept. 30 in room 350 Encina
Gym.
The agenda for this fall will
int.hide bowling, tennis, basket
ball free-throws, cross country,
golf, doubles table tennis, touch
football and two person vol
leyball. All events are co-ed.

In addition, a lineup of all
women's events will include
golf, tennis, touch football, two
person volleyball and cross
country.
Howling will use a league
format and players will be as
signed handicaps. Most other
sports will use single elimina
tion tournaments, with the ex
ception of one day wrestling and
cross country events.
Hut if you teallv want to be a
star. you have to make the effort
yourself. Organize a team and
get involved, you may find your
self fighting the always

powerful Theta I)elts tor the lead
next spring.
On the other hand, you may
find your plight much like that
of one Larkin team several years
ago. After the team manager ar
rived late at the basketball sign
up meeting, the freshmen were
assigned to the A league with the
legendary Seek and Destroy
team. Final score: Seek and De
stroy 108, Larkin 20.
Needless to say. the season
was a disaster. Hut the agony of
defeat is part of the game, right?
Right ?


BROKEN FlELD—These women are intent on just one thing:
marching down the field with the ball. IM sports are offered foi
everyone, so take your pick.
