# Band works on being gross

Marching Hand (LSJUMB)
makes people smile. LSJUMB
seems to be made up of a crossec
tion of your freshman dorm,
leaning heavily on the happy
go-lucky crazies that had their

room two doors down from
yours and always played Lou
Reed far into the night.
However, this may be some
what misleading. There are
rumors that the people in the
Band are actually quite normal,
but these are unsubstantiated as
of this printing.
What they appear to be down

on the field during a football
game or under the basket in
Maples is <1 collection of Stan
ford's zaniest, the antithesis to
the ugly rumor that rich kids
never have any fun.
Most normal "extraordinary"
students are given to fits of
periodic insanity — like waiting
in line for hours for concerts at
Maples, registration hassles and
flit; food service. The Band how
ever has nothing what so ever to
do with any of these, except that
LSJI 'MM never has to wait in line
for anything. Rut that's because
they're never in line, except once
(which no one will let them
forget) at the start of the Rose
Parade in 1971.
The most exciting thing about
the Band is that they seem to
have a hell of a good time pluy
ing music, which is really what
it's all about anyway. When they
hit you with the lively fanfare of
"Living in the USA" or start
cookin' on "Uncle John's Band"
or, best of all, usher the football
team onto the field to their long
time favorite "All Right Now,"
you can't help getting into the
rhythm and excitement of the
concert.
Football stars
They make everybody move
their feet. A large portion of the
students who attend football
games come only to see
LSJUMB. Some leave after
half time is over, but the real
aficionados stay until the final
gun and beyond when the Band
is J at its emotional best. The Dol
lies crank out outrageous
routines, and the Bandspeople
boogie until the fans are
exhausted.
Music is not the sole reason for
the Band's popularity. Many
times their halftime presenta
tions will be talked about far
beyond the poi nt where recollec
tions of the I JSC] Band have dis
appeared. The reason for this is
primarly the Band's well-known
lewdness on the field.
As a sidelight, it should be
noted that the television net
works which occasionally see
the light and televise Stanford
football games will not show the
Band on the tube, due to certain
formations performed during
Rose Bowl halftimes in the past.
The imflammatory nature of the

tuba paint jobs doesn't help
either. "Marijuana leaves!!! Mv
God!"
The crude masterminds be
hind LSJUMB's original forma
tions and shocking choice of
material is an informal group
that call themselves the Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers or
SMUT for more obvious reasons.
SMUT meets every Monday
night, as far as anyone can tell,
consumes massive quantities of
beer and other mind-altering
substances, and sets to work.
In the past they've whipped
off such winners as a tribute to
Nixon's health th.it included the
spellout of CLOT while playing
the song "Killing Me Softly"
(which was never done because
of heavy pressure from Howard
Hughes, the CIA, FBI, Mary
Hartman, and Joanie Caucus.)
One popular formation in
volved an outline of Florida,
complete with several
Bandspeople forming Lake
Okeechobee in the center of the
state. Near the end of the song
the lake collapsed and members
ran south, out the tip of Florida
into the Carribean — you get the
idea. The students loved it, and
spent the rest of the afternoon
completely blown away in the
hot sun. No one remembers
which game it was, which is in
itself a comment on the singular
ity of LSJUMB.
Back Fast
This summer before school
starts the Band will again make
its traditional trek across the
country to help the football team
open its season against Penn
State. This all began several
years ago when "the gallant and
brave 67" made their way back to
Arkansas to debut on national
TV in one of the Rose Bowl years.
Last year LSJUMB made it to
both Penn State and Michigan.
The Wolverine fans treated the
crew badly and this year they
were left off the schedule in
favor of spending three days in
New York City.
But the Band is not just all
football and basketball. On occa
sion. usually when the full moon
is obscured behind wispy
clouds, impromptu rallies will
be held (like sometime in
Freshman Orientation week) in
which everyone blows their best
for the sake of the Dollies,
Lambda Nu and dope brownies.
The ape man will blast his way
through another number, the
percussion section will be snio
kin'. and everything will be all
right now.

Reed far into the night.
However, this may be some
what misleading. There are
rumors that the people in the
Band are actually quite normal,
but these are unsubstantiated as
of this printing.
What they appear to be down

on the field during a football
game or under the basket in
Maples is <1 collection of Stan
ford's zaniest, the antithesis to
the ugly rumor that rich kids
never have any fun.
Most normal "extraordinary"
students are given to fits of
periodic insanity — like waiting
in line for hours for concerts at
Maples, registration hassles and
flit; food service. The Band how
ever has nothing what so ever to
do with any of these, except that
LSJI 'MM never has to wait in line
for anything. Rut that's because
they're never in line, except once
(which no one will let them
forget) at the start of the Rose
Parade in 1971.
The most exciting thing about
the Band is that they seem to
have a hell of a good time pluy
ing music, which is really what
it's all about anyway. When they
hit you with the lively fanfare of
"Living in the USA" or start
cookin' on "Uncle John's Band"
or, best of all, usher the football
team onto the field to their long
time favorite "All Right Now,"
you can't help getting into the
rhythm and excitement of the
concert.
Football stars
They make everybody move
their feet. A large portion of the
students who attend football
games come only to see
LSJUMB. Some leave after
half time is over, but the real
aficionados stay until the final
gun and beyond when the Band
is J at its emotional best. The Dol
lies crank out outrageous
routines, and the Bandspeople
boogie until the fans are
exhausted.
Music is not the sole reason for
the Band's popularity. Many
times their halftime presenta
tions will be talked about far
beyond the poi nt where recollec
tions of the I JSC] Band have dis
appeared. The reason for this is
primarly the Band's well-known
lewdness on the field.
As a sidelight, it should be
noted that the television net
works which occasionally see
the light and televise Stanford
football games will not show the
Band on the tube, due to certain
formations performed during
Rose Bowl halftimes in the past.
The imflammatory nature of the

tuba paint jobs doesn't help
either. "Marijuana leaves!!! Mv
God!"
The crude masterminds be
hind LSJUMB's original forma
tions and shocking choice of
material is an informal group
that call themselves the Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers or
SMUT for more obvious reasons.
SMUT meets every Monday
night, as far as anyone can tell,
consumes massive quantities of
beer and other mind-altering
substances, and sets to work.
In the past they've whipped
off such winners as a tribute to
Nixon's health th.it included the
spellout of CLOT while playing
the song "Killing Me Softly"
(which was never done because
of heavy pressure from Howard
Hughes, the CIA, FBI, Mary
Hartman, and Joanie Caucus.)
One popular formation in
volved an outline of Florida,
complete with several
Bandspeople forming Lake
Okeechobee in the center of the
state. Near the end of the song
the lake collapsed and members
ran south, out the tip of Florida
into the Carribean — you get the
idea. The students loved it, and
spent the rest of the afternoon
completely blown away in the
hot sun. No one remembers
which game it was, which is in
itself a comment on the singular
ity of LSJUMB.
Back Fast
This summer before school
starts the Band will again make
its traditional trek across the
country to help the football team
open its season against Penn
State. This all began several
years ago when "the gallant and
brave 67" made their way back to
Arkansas to debut on national
TV in one of the Rose Bowl years.
Last year LSJUMB made it to
both Penn State and Michigan.
The Wolverine fans treated the
crew badly and this year they
were left off the schedule in
favor of spending three days in
New York City.
But the Band is not just all
football and basketball. On occa
sion. usually when the full moon
is obscured behind wispy
clouds, impromptu rallies will
be held (like sometime in
Freshman Orientation week) in
which everyone blows their best
for the sake of the Dollies,
Lambda Nu and dope brownies.
The ape man will blast his way
through another number, the
percussion section will be snio
kin'. and everything will be all
right now.

ford's zaniest, the antithesis to
the ugly rumor that rich kids
never have any fun.
Most normal "extraordinary"
students are given to fits of
periodic insanity — like waiting
in line for hours for concerts at
Maples, registration hassles and
flit; food service. The Band how
ever has nothing what so ever to
do with any of these, except that
LSJI 'MM never has to wait in line
for anything. Rut that's because
they're never in line, except once
(which no one will let them
forget) at the start of the Rose
Parade in 1971.
The most exciting thing about
the Band is that they seem to
have a hell of a good time pluy
ing music, which is really what
it's all about anyway. When they
hit you with the lively fanfare of
"Living in the USA" or start
cookin' on "Uncle John's Band"
or, best of all, usher the football
team onto the field to their long
time favorite "All Right Now,"
you can't help getting into the
rhythm and excitement of the
concert.
Football stars
They make everybody move
their feet. A large portion of the
students who attend football
games come only to see
LSJUMB. Some leave after
half time is over, but the real
aficionados stay until the final
gun and beyond when the Band
is J at its emotional best. The Dol
lies crank out outrageous
routines, and the Bandspeople
boogie until the fans are
exhausted.
Music is not the sole reason for
the Band's popularity. Many
times their halftime presenta
tions will be talked about far
beyond the poi nt where recollec
tions of the I JSC] Band have dis
appeared. The reason for this is
primarly the Band's well-known
lewdness on the field.
As a sidelight, it should be
noted that the television net
works which occasionally see
the light and televise Stanford
football games will not show the
Band on the tube, due to certain
formations performed during
Rose Bowl halftimes in the past.
The imflammatory nature of the

tuba paint jobs doesn't help
either. "Marijuana leaves!!! Mv
God!"
The crude masterminds be
hind LSJUMB's original forma
tions and shocking choice of
material is an informal group
that call themselves the Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers or
SMUT for more obvious reasons.
SMUT meets every Monday
night, as far as anyone can tell,
consumes massive quantities of
beer and other mind-altering
substances, and sets to work.
In the past they've whipped
off such winners as a tribute to
Nixon's health th.it included the
spellout of CLOT while playing
the song "Killing Me Softly"
(which was never done because
of heavy pressure from Howard
Hughes, the CIA, FBI, Mary
Hartman, and Joanie Caucus.)
One popular formation in
volved an outline of Florida,
complete with several
Bandspeople forming Lake
Okeechobee in the center of the
state. Near the end of the song
the lake collapsed and members
ran south, out the tip of Florida
into the Carribean — you get the
idea. The students loved it, and
spent the rest of the afternoon
completely blown away in the
hot sun. No one remembers
which game it was, which is in
itself a comment on the singular
ity of LSJUMB.
Back Fast
This summer before school
starts the Band will again make
its traditional trek across the
country to help the football team
open its season against Penn
State. This all began several
years ago when "the gallant and
brave 67" made their way back to
Arkansas to debut on national
TV in one of the Rose Bowl years.
Last year LSJUMB made it to
both Penn State and Michigan.
The Wolverine fans treated the
crew badly and this year they
were left off the schedule in
favor of spending three days in
New York City.
But the Band is not just all
football and basketball. On occa
sion. usually when the full moon
is obscured behind wispy
clouds, impromptu rallies will
be held (like sometime in
Freshman Orientation week) in
which everyone blows their best
for the sake of the Dollies,
Lambda Nu and dope brownies.
The ape man will blast his way
through another number, the
percussion section will be snio
kin'. and everything will be all
right now.

PLAYING IN THE BAND—It might be grosser than you see or even
imagine. Who knows what wretched thoughts lie in the minds of
these vested gentlemen?
