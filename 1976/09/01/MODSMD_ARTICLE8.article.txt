# ASSU offers student services
## 
### Jacob Young 
The Associated Students of
Stanford University (ASSU) is
the representative body of all the
students at Stanford.
The ASSU is comprised of a
Senate, elected at large each fall
and a Council of Presidents
(COP), elected each spring.
The present COP members are
Vic Petroff, Carole Houck, Deric
Jennings and Al Tomaszczuk.
Ths issues they stressed during
the campaign last spring were
student input into the tenure de
cision process and a restructur
ing of the ASSU Senate, which
would allow candidates to run as
senators associated with a par
ticular University committee.
They also favored the estab
lishment of a system of teaching
evaluation as a means of affect
ing the quality of education and
allowing students to "vote with
their feet" on specific professors.
According to Jennings,
a number of these
plans are already beginning to
take shape. The ASSU has begun
a Teaching Resource Center, de
signed to, "... promote teach
ing and teaching skills for TA's
(teaching assistants) and
teachers," Jennings said. A TA

orientation session will begin on
Oct. 8 under the direction of
David Halliburton of the Center
for Teaching and Learning.
The COP is working on a
number of programs designed
for graduate students. Among
them are a Graduate Weekend
(Oct. 1 B-l 7) and restructuring of
the Graduate Aid Program.
The COP is also working on a
plan for a child care center and
an after school program, but
have "met with some resistance
from the University," Jennings
said.
Plans for student review of
junior faculty under considera
tion for tenure have "run into
some problems with the pro
vosts office," Jennings said.
"They saw some problems with
confidentiality," he added.
The ASSU will also sponsor a
SWOPSI course on restructuring
the Senate, which, according to
Jennings, would allow them to
work towards "better communi
cation in the Senate."
In addition to the COP prog
rams. the ASSU offers a host of
special services for members of
the Stanford community.
One of the most popular ser
vices has been the ASSU Lecture
Notes Service. Notes from

selected courses are taken by
ASSU representatives, and are
duplicated and distributed to
student subscribers. They cost
between $4 and $6 dollars, de
pending on the number of times
the class meets per week.
A few of the courses for which
the service will be offered this
fall are Philosophy 1, Psychol
ogy 1 and Chemistry 31.
Students have given the ser
vice varied ratings. Some see the
Lecture Notes as a valuable
study aid, but one student was
heard to comment that, "I ended
up taking notes on my notes. It
was impossible."
A new service this year which
is sure to be a success is the
ASSU t-shirt service. The plan is
to allow campus groups to de
sign and wear their own t-shirt
with a personalized logo or slo
gan. Manager Susan Graham has
promised that artists will be av
ailable for consultation and the
target price for lots of 12 or more
shirts is $3-$4.
The ASSU Legal Counseling
Service offers aid and legal
counseling to students with
legal problems. The Legal Coun
seling Service is funded by fee
i assessments and has offices in
t the Old Firehouse.

ASSU Special Events
schedules campus entertain
ment, mostly of the rock genre.
Last year's list of performers in
cluded Steven Stills with spe
cial guest Neil Young, Leo
Kottke, Boz Scaggs and come
dian Robert Kline. During the
summer, Frost Amphitheatre
played host to David Crosby and
Graham Nash.
The ASSU sponsors a re
frigerator rental service each fall.
The refrigerators are small and
fit nicely under a desk in dorm
rooms.
For everyone headed back east
at vacation time, the ASSU
Travel Service runs a fairly in
expensive airline charter prog
ram. The flights go to such
places as Boston and New York,
and are always full.
The Course Guide is a free
publication of the ASSU which
attempts to rate classes and pro
fessors in terms of teaching abil
ity and value in the department.
One Course Guide will be given
to each dorm room.
In addition, the ASSU offers a
number of convience services in
the Tresidder Offices. These in
clude a Bay Area courtesy
phone, a Ride Board and a copy
machine.

have promised student input on tenure and a number of graduate
student benefits.
The Associated Students of
Stanford University (ASSU) is
the representative body of all the
students at Stanford.
The ASSU is comprised of a
Senate, elected at large each fall
and a Council of Presidents
(COP), elected each spring.
The present COP members are
Vic Petroff, Carole Houck, Deric
Jennings and Al Tomaszczuk.
Ths issues they stressed during
the campaign last spring were
student input into the tenure de
cision process and a restructur
ing of the ASSU Senate, which
would allow candidates to run as
senators associated with a par
ticular University committee.
They also favored the estab
lishment of a system of teaching
evaluation as a means of affect
ing the quality of education and
allowing students to "vote with
their feet" on specific professors.
According to Jennings,
a number of these
plans are already beginning to
take shape. The ASSU has begun
a Teaching Resource Center, de
signed to, "... promote teach
ing and teaching skills for TA's
(teaching assistants) and
teachers," Jennings said. A TA

orientation session will begin on
Oct. 8 under the direction of
David Halliburton of the Center
for Teaching and Learning.
The COP is working on a
number of programs designed
for graduate students. Among
them are a Graduate Weekend
(Oct. 1 B-l 7) and restructuring of
the Graduate Aid Program.
The COP is also working on a
plan for a child care center and
an after school program, but
have "met with some resistance
from the University," Jennings
said.
Plans for student review of
junior faculty under considera
tion for tenure have "run into
some problems with the pro
vosts office," Jennings said.
"They saw some problems with
confidentiality," he added.
The ASSU will also sponsor a
SWOPSI course on restructuring
the Senate, which, according to
Jennings, would allow them to
work towards "better communi
cation in the Senate."
In addition to the COP prog
rams. the ASSU offers a host of
special services for members of
the Stanford community.
One of the most popular ser
vices has been the ASSU Lecture
Notes Service. Notes from

selected courses are taken by
ASSU representatives, and are
duplicated and distributed to
student subscribers. They cost
between $4 and $6 dollars, de
pending on the number of times
the class meets per week.
A few of the courses for which
the service will be offered this
fall are Philosophy 1, Psychol
ogy 1 and Chemistry 31.
Students have given the ser
vice varied ratings. Some see the
Lecture Notes as a valuable
study aid, but one student was
heard to comment that, "I ended
up taking notes on my notes. It
was impossible."
A new service this year which
is sure to be a success is the
ASSU t-shirt service. The plan is
to allow campus groups to de
sign and wear their own t-shirt
with a personalized logo or slo
gan. Manager Susan Graham has
promised that artists will be av
ailable for consultation and the
target price for lots of 12 or more
shirts is $3-$4.
