As an entering student, you
are about to receive an advisor.
Advisors come in several diffe
rent styles and models, so some
versatility is needed in dealing
with them. The key to success
with your new advisor is — in a
word — persistence.
MODEL A: The Advisor Who
Knows Everything
A thorough search for the
Stanford edition of Model A has
proven fruitless. You won't find
it at the Academic Information
(.'enter (AIC) or in any particular
department, and tlie student
who nurses expectations of dis
covering the omniscient advisor
finds only disappointment.
While an advisor cannot ans
wer all of your questions, he can
l>r a helpful source of general
academic information. But more
important, your advisor will
serve as a sounding board in dis
cussions about your professional
and or educational goals. Talk
ing with someone who is famil
i.ir with the field of your interest
( an help you generate new ideas
about your academic program
and — dare we say it?
your career.
MODEL B: The Advisor Who
Ihinks He Knows Everything
(Or The Advisor Who Plugs His
Own Meld)
A tew factory rejects always
make it to the shelves; advisors
are not an exception. It is not dif
ficult to change your advisor, but
sin h drastic action isn't always
necessary. Gathering several
opinions on a subject from diffe
irnt sources will offset one
sided ad\ ice and correct a misin
formed advisor.
One objective of the advising
system is to provide an oppor
tunity tor students to develop
personal contacts with profes
sors in their opportunity for stu
.driits to develop personal con
tacts with professors in their
primary field of interest. Chang
ing an advisor several times
makes it more difficult to estab
lish a rapport with your advisor.
MODEI, C: The Advisor Who
Can Never Be Reached
Don't let him get away with it.
Advisors volunteer their time, so

it's understandable that they
won't be at your every beck and
call. But if you're having no luck
day after day, go ahead and
complain. Write a letter if you
have to.
MODEL D: The Model Advisor
The model advisor won't
show his stuff until his advisee
encourages him to do so. A stu
dent's effort to use his advisor's
knowledge and experience will
usually pay off. But don't expect
your advisor to arrange all the
meetings and initiate discus
sion. If the student doesn't show
a need for assistance, the advisor
probably won't offer it.
Nor are advisors known for
giving opinions on specific clas
ses or instructors. Their purpose
is not to tell you which professor
to take for Chem 31 or which his
tory TA's to avoid. More often
than not, they don't know,and if
they did, they wouldn't liberally
slander or promote their col
leagues.
The best you can expect from
an advisor is a good listener and
a person who helps you examine
all the opportunities in the broad
academic program offered here.
MODEL E: The Closet Advisor
Everyone loves to give advice
(me, for instance). Sometimes it
helps to seek it. In all-freshmen
dorms, the RA's and Resident
Fellows can often answer
academic as well as personal
questions. Four-class dorms are
teeming with hopeful Dear Ab
bv's. Students, more tha{i
teachers, are willing to recom
mend courses and professors.
Find someone with similar
tastes if you want to take peer
advice — your roommate might
just love the class you cut every
morning.
If human help fails to meet
your every need, start consu 1 ting
the reams of printed material av
ailable to make course planning
and selection easier. In addition
to Courses and Degrees, the
ASSU Course Guide, and Course
Abstracts, there's a new hand
book called Distribution Re
quirements and Things (DRAT),
published by the AIC. All of
these publications can be found
in the AIC and UGLY.

MODEL A: The Advisor Who
Knows Everything
A thorough search for the
Stanford edition of Model A has
proven fruitless. You won't find
it at the Academic Information
(.'enter (AIC) or in any particular
department, and tlie student
who nurses expectations of dis
covering the omniscient advisor
finds only disappointment.
While an advisor cannot ans
wer all of your questions, he can
l>r a helpful source of general
academic information. But more
important, your advisor will
serve as a sounding board in dis
cussions about your professional
and or educational goals. Talk
ing with someone who is famil
i.ir with the field of your interest
( an help you generate new ideas
about your academic program
and — dare we say it?
your career.
MODEL B: The Advisor Who
Ihinks He Knows Everything
(Or The Advisor Who Plugs His
Own Meld)
A tew factory rejects always
make it to the shelves; advisors
are not an exception. It is not dif
ficult to change your advisor, but
sin h drastic action isn't always
necessary. Gathering several
opinions on a subject from diffe
irnt sources will offset one
sided ad\ ice and correct a misin
formed advisor.
One objective of the advising
system is to provide an oppor
tunity tor students to develop
personal contacts with profes
sors in their opportunity for stu
.driits to develop personal con
tacts with professors in their
primary field of interest. Chang
ing an advisor several times
makes it more difficult to estab
lish a rapport with your advisor.
MODEI, C: The Advisor Who
Can Never Be Reached
Don't let him get away with it.
Advisors volunteer their time, so

it's understandable that they
won't be at your every beck and
call. But if you're having no luck
day after day, go ahead and
complain. Write a letter if you
have to.
MODEL D: The Model Advisor
The model advisor won't
show his stuff until his advisee
encourages him to do so. A stu
dent's effort to use his advisor's
knowledge and experience will
usually pay off. But don't expect
your advisor to arrange all the
meetings and initiate discus
sion. If the student doesn't show
a need for assistance, the advisor
probably won't offer it.
Nor are advisors known for
giving opinions on specific clas
ses or instructors. Their purpose
is not to tell you which professor
to take for Chem 31 or which his
tory TA's to avoid. More often
than not, they don't know,and if
they did, they wouldn't liberally
slander or promote their col
leagues.
The best you can expect from
an advisor is a good listener and
a person who helps you examine
all the opportunities in the broad
academic program offered here.
MODEL E: The Closet Advisor
Everyone loves to give advice
(me, for instance). Sometimes it
helps to seek it. In all-freshmen
dorms, the RA's and Resident
Fellows can often answer
academic as well as personal
questions. Four-class dorms are
teeming with hopeful Dear Ab
bv's. Students, more tha{i
teachers, are willing to recom
mend courses and professors.
Find someone with similar
tastes if you want to take peer
advice — your roommate might
just love the class you cut every
morning.
If human help fails to meet
your every need, start consu 1 ting
the reams of printed material av
ailable to make course planning
and selection easier. In addition
to Courses and Degrees, the
ASSU Course Guide, and Course
Abstracts, there's a new hand
book called Distribution Re
quirements and Things (DRAT),
published by the AIC. All of
these publications can be found
in the AIC and UGLY.
