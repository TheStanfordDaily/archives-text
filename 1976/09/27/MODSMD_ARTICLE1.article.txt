# USE, university clash on salaries
## No more talks until Wednesday 
### Jacob Young 
Negotiations between the univer
sity and United Stanford Employees
(USE) have reached an apparent im
passe in the settlement of a new con
tract. According to both sides, no
further meetings are scheduled until
Wednesday.
The problems center mainly on the
issues of salary and benefit. Both par
ties are holding firm lines on their
present demands.
The university has made the offer
of a three-year contract which would
give employes a 7.5 per cent raise the
first year, a 5.5 per cent raise the sec
ond year and a 5 per cent raise the
third year. Included would be provi
sions for cost of living allowances, if
the cost of living in the Bay Area were
to rise sharply.
Union demands ask for even grea
ter increases. They seek a 14 per cent
increase the first year of the contract
and a 7 per cent increase during the
second year. They also are asking for
a cost of living allowance and
another plan which would be either a
dental plan for union members, an
extension of the health insurance be
nefits to include all dependents or

substantial pension improvements.
Many areas affected
If a strike does occur, the following
areas of the university will probably
be affected: Plant Services, dining
halls and residences, Medical Center,
university stores, the steam plant,
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
Stanford Center for Information Pro
cessing and Hansen Laboratories.
Food services would be drastically
reduced, as would maintenance of
grounds and residences.
According to USE President Roger
Hardy, "the university is fairly em
barrassed about the way our salaries
compare to other groups who do the
same capacity in the outside mar
ket."
fie insisted that the union de
mands are not unreasonable, because
USE pay raises and benefit plans are
inferior to those offered to most other
labor groups in the past few years.
"Fourteen per cent is really a min
imal figure when you consider wage
rates in the rest of the Bay Area. Most

of our people could go to other places
and get much better treatment,"
Hardy said.
Points of controversy
Other major points of controversy
include union security and person
nel classification. At present, LISE is
a modified agency shop, which
means that employes who are hired
by the university must become mem
bers of the union as a condition for
employment, but persons employed
by the university before the union
gained the right to represent Stanford
employes are not required to join the
union.
According to Hardy, the union is
attempting to have a union shop ag
reement inserted into this year's con
tract. This would require all
employes who fall under the classifi
cations covered by the union to be
come union members.
"1 predict that Doug Barton will
resist this," Hardy said. Barton is
university staff council, who is head
ing the university's negotiating team.

Personnel classification is an im
portant subject since it involves the
system used in placing employes in
payment classifications. Many union
members are in the wrong classifica
tion and hence are being "under
compensated for their services,"
Hardy said.
The university is seeking a clause
in the new contract which would
"amount to a union agreement that
all our people are properly clas
sified," Hardy said. He added that
this would be a major problem in set
tlement, "because it just isn't so."
According to Hardy, the union has
already distributed strike vote bal
lots. These will be counted at noon
tomorrow in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium.
Strategy meeting
After the strike votes are counted.
Hardy said USE would hold a
"strategy meeting." Following that
meeting USE would probably ask
Barton for a response.
Hardy blasted the university for

not yet realizing that it is dealing
with a labor union and that it has to
bargain collectively.
According to Barton, the major ob
ject now is to avoid a strike. "1 think
there is still a possibility of that."
Barton also expressed guarded op
timism over the details of the settle
ment, saying, "We are boiling things
down to very specific questions."
Hardy also expressed hopes over
the prospect of a settlement before a
strike, saying "we hope it doesn't
reach that point."
Extension expired
The current USE contract expired
Sept. 1. The union and the university
signed a 15-day extension which has
since expired. Despite thefact that no
contract is now in effect, normal rela
tions and working hours will be ob
served by both parties until the an
nouncement of either a strike or some
sort of settlement.
In early August Hardy had said
that if no progress was made in con

tract talks by Oct. 1. there would
"certainly" be a strike.
Construction on campus which
could be delayed or halted by the
threatened strike include the $14
million Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building, the $9 million Seeley G.
Mudd Chemistry Building and the $9
million Terman Engineering Center.
The university has apparently
begun to stock extra supplies in the
event of a strike. The Medical Center
has an "abnormal" supply of glass
syringes for patients. At least one de
partment has been warned not to ex
change its chemical solutions with
other departments because there is a
"strike pending."
Problems with a possible settle
ment of the new contract began last
spring, when the university and USE
clashed over the proper procedure
for the presentation of new contract
demands. At the time, one union of
ficial blasted the university for taking
such a hard stance even in the pre
negotiation talks. The university re
plied with charges that the union's
method of demand presentation was
unacceptable. A
