# Carter threatens liberty, peace
## 
### 
An examination of Jimmy Carter's stands on
problems facing America shows that he does not
deserve the support of those genuinely concerned
with human liberty nor the support of those who
would like to see the United States pursue a nonin
terventionist foreign policy.
In the area of victimless crimes, Carter as gover
nor of Georgia supported a law which mandated
life sentences for second-time convictions for sale
of LSD, cocaine and other drugs. Far from advocat
ing nation-wide decriminalization or legalization
of drugs, Carter merely favors making a lessening of
penalties for marijuana possession a state-level op
tion.
On the question of preventive detention, Carter
as governor supported a bill permitting judges to
deny bail to those arrested for selling drugs. Since
winning the Democratic nomination, Carter has
strongly criticized the Warren Court decisions
which upheld the civil liberties of persons accused
of committing crimes.
Concerning freedom of information and gov
ernmental secrecy, it is worth noting that at the
time newspapers were trying to publish the Penta
gon Papers, Carter telephoned a U.S. senator and
advocated subjecting journalists to new criminal
penalties in order to prevent similar publications in
the future.
Increased wiretapping
On the right to privacy, it is a matter of record that
Carter as governor supported a bill to extend the
use of bugging by police.
Concerning the Central Intelligence Agency, Car
ter has no intention of dismantling the agency or
curbing its power to engage in secret warfare. In
stead of abolition or drastic institutional reform,
Carter says we should trust him personally to
supervise the agency.
just how far we should trust him is apparent from
his expression of dismay that recent investigations
of the CIA and attendant publicity have "crippled"
the agency.
On the question of amnesty, Carter opposes
across-the-board amnesty for deserters. His general
attitude favoring abject obedience to authority is
summed up in his statement that "the right thing to
do is to go and fight even if you think a war is
immoral."
Restricted abortion
On the topic of abortion and a woman's owner
ship of her own body, Carter said during the cam
paigning before the lowa caucuses that he favored
"a national statute" that "would restrict the prac
tice of abortion in our country." He has since
backpedaled somewhat on this issue, but his fun
damental antagonism to abortion has led him to
repudiate the Democratic Party platform plank on
abortion.

In an August interview with the National
Catholic News Service, Carter re-emphasized that
he had supported the restrictive Georgia law that
was found unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme
Court in its 1973 decision on abortion. The Georgia
law permitted abortions only when the mother's
life or health was considered to be in danger or if
the pregnancy was a result of rape — a rape that had
to be proven in court.

In economics, Carter favors the age-old,
monopoly-fostering policies of farm subsidies (in
cluding those for peanuts), maritime industry pro
tection, oil import quotas, protection of the domes
tic clothing industry, wage-price controls, and so
forth.
His supposedly innovative reform of the gov
ernment structure is strikingly similar to the plans
floated by Nixon aide Roy Ash for streamlining the
executive branch.
Continued intervention
In general terms, Carter's foreign policy would
continue American dictation to the rest of the
world. Carter says that the U.S. "has an inevitable
role of leadership to play." He stresses that "this is
no time for thoughts of isolationism." Since he is an
Annapolis graduate, it is not surprising that Carter
favors increased spending on the U.S. Navy, in
cluding support for the Trident submarine.
Carter's foreign policy remarks follow the theme
of Sen. Henry Jackson and Daniel P. Moynihan that
the United States, Western Europe, Israel, Japan,
Australia, and New Zealand should combine to
gether against the rest of the world. As the man who
nominated Jackson at the 1972 Democratic conven
tion, it is not surprising that Carter is sharply criti
cal of detente with the Soviet Union.
Carter fully supported American intervention in
Vietnam through 1971. Even then his partial
change of heart was based on his view that U.S.
involvement and the form it had taken was a
strategic error and not immoral aggression.
'Win or get out'
It is apparent from a column Carter wrote for
small Georgia newspapers (Press Ready News Ser
vice, Waynesboro, Ga.J in August 1971 that Carter

held the typical militant interventionist's "win or
get out" position. His complaint was that higher
ups had insufficient will to win, and thus the only
option was getting out.
As columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak
note: "This exactly duplicated the position then
held by many hawks, including George C. Wal
lace."
When Nixon ordered the Christmas bombing of
North Vietnam and the mining of Haiphong harbor,
Carter supported these actions. He urged that "we
give President Nixon our backing and support —
whether or not we agree with specific decisions."
On June 19, 1971, at the Democratic Governors
Conference in Omaha, Carter sponsored a resolu
tion which would have ruled out making Vietnam a
Democratic issue in the upcoming presidential
campaign. According to Carter, "we should have
appreciated and supported Nixon's efforts."
Aid to Saigon
On April 2, 1975 with the North Vietnamese and
the National Liberation Front (NLF) in the outskirts
of Saigon, Carter told political reporters that he
favored continuing $500 million to $600 million in
military aid for another year to "stabilize" the
Saigon government.
While governor, Carter described William Calley
as a "scapegoat" after Galley's conviction in the My
Lai massacre case. But Calley was in no way an
innocent bearing the blame of others; he was a duly
convicted atrocity murderer, and Carter's catering
to Calley's apologists here should not go unnoticed.
Since he has developed presidential aspirations,
Carter has been tutored on foreign policy issues
largely by such veteran Cold Warriors as Dean Rusk
and Zbigniew Brzezinski.
During the presidential campaign, Carter's un
critical bipartisanship on matters of substance in
foreign policy has led him to support explicity
Ford's bellicose handling of the tree-pruning inci
dent in Korea and Ford's refusal to normalize rela
tions with Vietnam.
On the Middle East, Garter says: "Our commit
ment to the maintenance of a viable Israeli state is
unshakable and unmistakable." He stands behind
permanent Israeli retention of the Golan Heights
and Jewish and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem.
On June 24,1976, Carter told the New York Times
that as president he would definitely consider sta
tioning U.S. troops in the Middle East to enforce a
peace settlement.
It appears that with Carter as president we will
have at least four more years of erosion of the liber
ties of Americans and meddling by the U.S. gov
ernment abroad.
