# Play-by-play on 'Great Debate'

While the debates between Presi
dent Gerald Ford and former Governor
Jimmy Carter can't compete with
Monty Python's Flying Circus for
laughs, the first of four televised
"showdowns" Thursday had its
lighter moments.
They started on an upbeat note.
Moderator Edwin Newman of NBC
pointed out right from the beginning
that as many as "100 million people
throughout the country" might be
watching the "first presidential debate
in 16 years."
About two dozen of the 100 million
were jammed into the Serra House
lounge.
They were sitting four to a couch
and sprawled on the floor. There was
not enough room in the small chamber
which housed the television to seat
everybody, so a couple of people drew
up chairs and peered through the
doorway.
Interest in the debates was high.
The first image to flicker across the
screen was Carter. Nobody cheered as
he made his opening statement. On the
other hand, he wasn't booed.
And while nobody said they de
tected a sweating upper lip, the only
comment made during the opening
three minutes was "Carter looks nerv
ous."
That was an understatement, but if
the Serrans had any other thoughts,
they kept them to themselves.
That would change about 15 mi
nutes into the debate.
Ford was next and the first thing he

did was assail Carter's credibility. This
drew a few cackles and catcalls. It also
changed the tone of the crowd. Now
when someone made a statement, he
was challenged by the Serra television
crowd.
In his opening statement, the presi
dent said he felt the administration
could save "the CITIZENS of the UN
ITED STATES OF ahhh AMERICA"
tax dollars. Someone shouted at him to
cut the defense budget.
Carter's response to Ford's self
praise of his administration's fiscal
policies was direct. He said emphati
cally that things have net been so bad
in this country since "the Great Depre
ssion of the 19405."
History books will tell you that de
pression took place in the 19305, but as
one student said, "1 guess World War II
was kind of depressing, too."
Ford wanted to talk a little bit more
about taxes, and countered that he had
lowered them "by eliminating 10 mill
ion taxpayers in the last year." Well,
they were probably working class and
potential Carter voters to boot.
The students liked that one. "Clas
sics," exclaimed a professor in the
room.
Actually, the most admiration was
expressed for the questions asked by
panelists Frank Reynolds, Elizabeth
Drew and lames Cannon. In fact,
Reynolds drew applause from the back
of the room for one particularly deft
question on Ford's pardon of Richard
Nixon.
By this time, the reserve that had

greeted Carter's opening statement
had crumbled. Almost everybody had a
comment of some sort to add to the
debate. It became four sided — Carter,
Ford, the panel and the Serrans.
The Serrans were scoring the most
debating points.
They were particularly fascinated
with the way Carter would occasion
ally juxtapose, superimpose and then
transpose Ford and Nixon.
Ford kept harkening back to the
issue of taxation and the way in which
he felt Carter would raise the federal
deficit with a number of new programs
he was proposing. The Serran solution
was to "print more money. That's what
they always do."
And when Carter told America that
"we're running out of oil," one person
screamed, "oh no — my major.
Down the drain." A petro-chemical
engineer, no doubt.
After the first half hour of the debate,
some of the students were able to more
or less anticipate Ford or Carter re
sponses to questions even before they
answered them.
Once, when Ford was decrying the
Democratically controlled Congress,
he was asked what effect he felt the
administration had among senators
and representatives. A voice near the
door responded, "It acts like a system of
checks and balances."
Sure enough. 30 seconds later. Ford
said the administration "acts like a
system of checks and balances" on the
Congress.
The last great guffaw was made, not

by Ford or Carter, but by the television
people. What was to have been a media
spectacle turned into a media sham
when the audio was lost during the last
nine minutes of the debate.
Carter was about to comment on il
legal activities perpetrated by the CIA
and the FBI when, suddenly, there was
no sound.
"The CIA dio it it," one student
speculated. "It's Eugene McCarthy,"
another countered. "Probably
Reagan," said a third.
Whatever or whoever it was, it was
an anti-climax to the debates. In spite
of NBC and Douglas Kiker's rather be
mused comments (Walter Cronkite,
CBS, and David Brinkley, NBC, were
quick to point out that ABC was handl
ing the pool arrangements for this de
bate), the showdown ended on a
downbeat which could be blamed on
neither candidate.
It was at this point that most of the
Serrans lost interest. There were just
too many "who won" interviews with
Jimmy's wife Rosalynn, Ford's press
secretary Ron Nessen and other parti
sans for them to take.
Perhaps the most accurate statement
was made by a Serran when he was
asked who he thought won. "Neither
of them did," he said. "I think it will
only re-enforce what people thought of
them already."
Eugene McCarthy, independent
candidate for president, may run well
on this campus.
