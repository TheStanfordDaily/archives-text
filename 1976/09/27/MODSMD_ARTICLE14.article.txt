# Prof is student favorite
## It's all Greek to him 
### Meg Walker 
Professor Anthony
Raubitschek icame into his career
quite unexpectedly. Educated in
a traditional, small academic
high school in Austria, he was
discouraged from studying
medicine and told he was "too
dumb" to study mathematics.
So, "obediently," following the
advice of a family friend, he
began to study classics. And that
has made all the difference.
At least for Kaubitchek arid the
many Stanford students whom
he has guided through Greek
plays, epic poems and the teach
ings of Aristotle and Plato, the
difference has been consequen
tial. Though classics is the study
of ancient literature and culture,
it has given Raubitschek a posi
tive, open approach to the prob
lems of contemporary life, not to
mention a sense of principles,
and values.
Raubitschek acknowledges
the paradox between the new
and the old; in fact he feels the
old has become very new be
cause of modern industry, which
has made books of ancient litera
ture more accessible. He looks at
the "renaissance of knowledge"
today, the wealth of paperback
literature that makes it possible
for a class like Humanities 61 to
be taught efficiently. "With a
reading list of at least 11 books,"
Raubitschek says, "a class like
Humanities 61 would have been
economically impossible for the
student of 1937."
Not only does Raubitschek see
progress in industry helping
eduction but also the new
perspectives a college student
puts on his education. "In a
sense," he says, "young people
are more sensible than their el

ders on the question of going to
college. They want to be honest
about it."
'Honesty'
Referring to the growing trend
of stopping out (taking time off
from school), Raubitschek says
honesty is the basic issue. He
points out that some students
feel the need to "test their moti
vation" concerning their educa
tion and they are simply being
honest about where their in
terests lie. Hut too often, he feels,
extraneous circumstances are
involved.
For Raubitschek, a college
education should be based on
the amount of interest a student
has in his education. "People in
and out (of college) suffer be
cause of tfie social pressures, the
prestige of getting a college edu
cation," Raubitschek explained.
If he had a hand in admissions
he would be more concerned
about "true interest than about
outstanding talent when
eliminating people." He feels a
university can easily overlook
true interest and admit people
who do not really care. "This
makes for many bored hostile
students who are trapped into
going to college si mplv by social
pressures," Raubitschek says.
For Raubitschek. interest does
not only apply to the academic
world. It also underlies all as
pects of life and is often bet
rayed. In politics it is made par
ticularly apparent by the upcorn
ing elections. "There is too
much debate without basis"
Raubitschek says,"and too
many politicians jump into the
fray giving the clear impression
they aren't the least bit in
terested in doing good."
Go slowly
Raubitschek would like to en
courage them to go slowly. It
takes time to understand cul
tures and values. He questions
cultures and valued because
politicians have so often ignored
them. It is not the actual doings
of Watergate and other political
scandals that shock Raubitschek
but it's "the politician's not own
ing up to them" that is so disap
pointing. "Honesty."
Raubitschek adds, "is an inhe
rent part of culture and some

where they have disregarded
that culture."
Raubitschek admits going to
school 25 years of one's life and
studying from 7-12 p.m. every
night is somewhat of a burden.
He encourages a balanced edu
cation; a student should pursue
pastimes and hobbies as well as
studying.
Raubitschek feels the lack of
student representation in the
administration is responsible for
many problems, especially con
cerning student-teacher rela
tionships. With a University pol
icy that requires a professor to
publish in order to gain tenure, it
â– is often hard for a student to get
all the attention or guidance
needed.
For Raubitschek, the question
of research presents two sides. In
a sense, he feels the pressure
stimulates a professor's perspec
tive and keeps him from "going
stale." However, Raubitschek
understands the frustrations of a
student when a professor is too
busy to give advice or guidance.
Student initiative
It's a difficult problem to solve
but the "students should defi
nitely take the initiative,"
Raubitschek says. "I'm sure the
qualifications for administrators
are very high but what you need
is someone who's around and
knows how the students are feel
ing."
Raubitschek received the Wal
ter J. Gores award this year for
his excellence in teaching. The
award pointed out his "enduring
freshness of his love for the scho
larly life and the twinkling good
humor with which he seeks to
teach all comers." Maybe this
explains his appeal and over
flowing classes. At any rate, it is
essential, for Raubitschek, "to be
always willing and open to life."
He, adds, "if you stop growing
and changing, you're really not
living anymore."
