# CROW gets new funds, director

### Jacob Young 
The Center for Research On
Women (CROW) has recently re
ceived funding from the univer
sity and the Ford Foundation
which puts them on a "perma
nent basis" as an organization
here, according to Margaret Col
lins, CROW director.
CROW is "a student initiated
program which coordinates re
search and scholarly writing on
the changing roles of men and
women," Collins said. New to
the job herself, Collins came to
CROW this year after spending
several years at other institu
tions serving mostly in academic
administration positions. She is
a graduate of Scripps College.
CROW offers a variety of pro
grams for research on women,
but one which will undoubtedly
draw much attention this fall is
the Wednesday Noon Lecture
series, entitled "The Family in
Flux." It will investigate the
family in today's world and try
to develop "understanding and
assist in wiser choices about

change or the preservation of the
institution of the family," Col
lins commented.
Based on the premise that the
tamily is changing rapidly as
women take more active roles in
the economic and social world,
it is hoped that this series will
contribute to, "better under
standing of changing roles in the
family," she added.
'Female depression'
The first lecture will be pre
sented on Friday Oct. 1 in room
86 of theCraduate School of Bus
iness and will feature Jessie Ber
nard, who will speak on Female
Depression. Bernard is a
sociologist and emeritus profes
sor at Pennsylvania State Uni
versity. She is also the author of
several books, among them The
Future of Marriage and
Academic Women.
Other topics for the fall series
will include "Working Women
and the Family" and"The Legal
Status of Women in the Family."
For further information about
the series, contact CROW at
497-1994 or go by the offices at
105 Polya Hall.
The lecture series is offered
each quarter and features varied
subjects. The topic for winter
will be Women's Health and
spring quarter will investigate
the role of women in developing
countries.
CROW is in the process of hir

ing a research scholar who will
run her own research project, or
ganize and encourage faculty
and staff research on women's
topics and advise students on
their own research on women re
lated topics.
'Contribute to growth'
According to Collins, this per
son will be hired in the very near
future and will further contri
bute to the growth of Women's
Studies at Stanford. "We want to
encourage people to do research
in women's studies in all fields
and through their regular class
room work." she said.
The research fellow will also
be in charge of keeping lists of
faculty research positions which
deal with women's topics. In ad
dition, there will be up to five
research positions available to
students at the center, Collins
said.
Another program which will
be developed in the future is the
Women in Science program,
which would, according to Col
lins "Provide women in science
fields with information on
faculty-peer interaction, busi
ness and lifestyle planning and
also help these women with en
hancing self-image. We would
like input from all women on
this subject. We want to be flexi
ble in order to meet their needs."
Collins pointed out that there
is already a very active group

called Women In Science and
Engineering (WISE) here, and
that any CROW program in this
area would receive much input
and support from WISE.
Compendium
Other current CROW projects
include the Compendium of
Women's Classes, which is a list
ing of all classes that focus on
women's studies.
The center publishes a news
letter which is directed specifi
cally at the donors and patrons of
the program. It includes infor
mation about people and current
research, as well as reviews of
lectures and books.
CROW also maintains exten
sive files on a number of women
related topics. These can be an
invaluable aid to doing research
on women's topics. The files in
clude copies of articles, publica
tions from various institutions
and foundations, copies of re
search papers and extensive list
ings of women's studies prog
rams and listings of national and
local women's groups.
CROW will attempt to involve
more persons in their various
programs and activities this
year, Collins said. The Center
will continue to attempt to place
those interested in research in
specific programs, and will also
have a number of internshi ps av
ailable. The Center is located at
105 Polya Hall.

managed to hiest the ABC logo from beneath the network
cameras at Saturday's game against San Jose State.

The freshpersons refused to identify either their names or
their dorm, but all involved seemed quite proud of this
mass effort, which included a chase by ABC officials.
