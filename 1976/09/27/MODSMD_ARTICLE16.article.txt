# ASSU Tee Shirts begin
## 
### 
The ASSU will offer a cus
tomized tee shirt service for the
first time this fall. According to
Susan Graham, director of the
program, the ASSU Tee Shirt
Service will "try to provide a
normally off campus service on
campus, entirely run by stu
dents. I'm sure our prices will be
more reasonable than most out
side services."
At present, the service is print
ing and selling tee shirts for the
Black Students Union, Man
zanita Park and the "I'm a
freshperson" shirts being sold to
entering freshmen.
The plans for the service, ac
cording to Graham, are to de
velop the capacity to carry out
the entire operation on campus.
At present, the ASSU contracts
with an outside company to
print the designs on heat trans
ferable paper, and the designs
are placed on shirts in the Tee
Shirts office.
Graham said she hopes that IM
teams, dorms and other campus
groups will use the service. The
ASSU Tee Shirts offers a wide
variety of shirt styles. They have
the capacity to print an order of
any size, with a delivery time of
one to two weeks. Projected
costs are from $3-$4 for each
shirt in a large order (12 or more)
and only slightly higher for
single shirts.
The ASSU Tee Shirts office is
located in the ASSU office, sec
ond floor Tresidder Union. The
number for the office is 497-
1394.
