Lusaka, Zambia (AP) — Presidents
of the five "frontline" black African
states yesterday rejected Prime Minis
ter lan Smith's terms for a surrender of
power to Rhodesia's black majority but
apparently accepted the principle of
an interim government to prepare the
way.
The black leaders called on Britain
to convene a constitutional conference
to establish a black-majority interim
government, and Britain agreed to do
so.
However, the black leaders also reaf
firmed their commitment to the
guerrilla struggle against the white
minority regime in Rhodesia.
The State Department declared in
Washington that "the road to a
negotiated solution is now open."
In Pretoria, South Africa, Prime
Minister John Vorster issued a state
ment saying that "the Rhodesian gov
ernment has fully executed the agree
ment reached" during talks he and
Smith had last week U.S. Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger.
"It is very difficult to understand the

Lusaka statement and it is of cardinal
importance that if a peaceful solution
is to be found, the United States and
British governments must as soon as
possible clear up the confusion which
now exists," Vorster said.
He added that he had "provisionally
called off" the planned visit to
Washington of Foreign Secretary
Brand Fourie, and that "any discus
sions which may (take) place" would
be conducted by South African Am
bassador Roelof Botha.
There was no immediate reaction
from Salisbury, the Rhodesian capital.
After deliberating for 4V2 hours over
the British-American plan to achieve
black rule within two years, the lead
ers of Zambia, Tanzania, Mozambique,
Angola and Botswana announced
their agreement that a constitutional
conference must be held to set up a
black-dominated interim government
and write a new constitution for

He added that he had "provisionally
called off" the planned visit to
Washington of Foreign Secretary
Brand Fourie, and that "any discus
sions which may (take) place" would
be conducted by South African Am
bassador Roelof Botha.
There was no immediate reaction
from Salisbury, the Rhodesian capital.
After deliberating for 4V2 hours over
the British-American plan to achieve
black rule within two years, the lead
ers of Zambia, Tanzania, Mozambique,
Angola and Botswana announced
their agreement that a constitutional
conference must be held to set up a
black-dominated interim government
and write a new constitution for
Rhodesia.
Smith had called for an interim ad
ministration evenly divided between
blacks and whites, with whites retain
ing substantial power.
A communique issued by the five
presidents said accepting the plan as
outlined by Smith would be "tan
tamount to legalizing colonialist and
racist structures of power."
British Foreign Secretary Anthony
Crosland announced in Blackpool,
England, that his government had ag
reed to convene the conference and a
government minister would leave for
Africa within 48 hours.
Conference location
The black leaders said in their
statement the conference should be
held outside Rhodesia. Crosland said
at a news conference earlier that it
should take place inside the country,
but in his statement asked only that
"the parties concerned" say how and
where the talks "could best be ar
ranged and who the participants
should be."
"We have seen the statement of the
African presidents in Lusaka and wel
come it."the State Department said in
an official announcement, and"the

United States is now consulting with
the United Kingdom" on the constitu
tional conference.
Crosland said in Blackpool that the
most sensible course of action for black
Africans would be to press for an in
terim Rhodesian government headed
by a black prime minister. Crosland
said an immediate constitutional con
ference would delay the process of
bringing black majority rule.
Lusaka, Zambia (AP) — Presidents
of the five "frontline" black African
states yesterday rejected Prime Minis
ter lan Smith's terms for a surrender of
power to Rhodesia's black majority but
apparently accepted the principle of
an interim government to prepare the
way.
The black leaders called on Britain
to convene a constitutional conference
to establish a black-majority interim
government, and Britain agreed to do
so.
However, the black leaders also reaf
firmed their commitment to the
guerrilla struggle against the white
minority regime in Rhodesia.
The State Department declared in
Washington that "the road to a
negotiated solution is now open."
In Pretoria, South Africa, Prime
Minister John Vorster issued a state
ment saying that "the Rhodesian gov
ernment has fully executed the agree
ment reached" during talks he and
Smith had last week U.S. Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger.
"It is very difficult to understand the

Lusaka statement and it is of cardinal
importance that if a peaceful solution
is to be found, the United States and
British governments must as soon as
possible clear up the confusion which
now exists," Vorster said.
He added that he had "provisionally
