# Berkeley women hassle hookers

Berkeley (AP) — A group of
Berkeley women believe they
have found a way to make street
hookers hightail it elsewhere.
"The trick is to present your
self as a nuisance," said one of
the women, Charlene Spiller.
"And that's what we do."
For the past three weeks, Spil
ler, a businesswoman, and seven
other women friends have bun
dled up and stationed them
selves in a group at pickup cor
ners along a stretch of University
Avenue, popular with prosti
tutes in recent months. They
don't talk to the prostitutes or
hand out literature. They just
stand and watch.
"The first one was really nerv
ous," she said. "Her reaction was
great because she was really
mad.
"Once we got into it, it was
like playing. We were thinking
of getting choir groups out there,
or maybe carrying a Bible — any
thing."

But the mere presence of the
neighborhood women usually
made the prostitutes sufficiently
nervous to move on to other cor
ners. Spiller and company next
plan to confine the street walkers
to the middle of the block.
"They do all their business on
the corners," she explained. "If
you can keep a whore in the
middle of the block, you put her
out of commission. If they lose
enough money, their men will
take them elsewhere."
Spiller said she and her
friends don't object to prostitu
tion as such but don't want pros
titutes brazenly parading around
their businesses and homes.
The police, she said, rightfully
should be devoting more energy
to fighting violent crime.
"If a citizen can go stand on a
street corner with prostitutes
and make sure they don't do any
business that night, the citizen is
doing her part," she said.
