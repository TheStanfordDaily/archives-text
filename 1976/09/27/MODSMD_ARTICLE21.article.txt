# KZSU gets closer to power hike okay
##

Student radio station KZSU's
long-sought power increase
came a step closer to reality this
summer, according to Station
Manager Larry Goldman.
The power-hike application to
the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC), prepared
with the help of a professional
consultant, languished for more
than 18 months. Notice of the
application appeared in the Fed
eral Register for one month be
ginning July 2, during which
time any person could have filed
a formal complaint with the
FCC.
"Fortunately, we didn't get a
single complaint," Goldman
said. An objection would have
put a major roadblock in the way
of approval.
Although still in limbo, the
station is hoping to increase its
power from "rated for 40 watts"
(it is currently operating at 10
watts) to a rating for 500 watts.
One major group that could
have been detrimental to KZSU's
hopes for an increase in power is
Foothill Junior College radio sta
tion KFJC, which is directly ad
jacent to KZSU on the dial. Ac
cording to Goldman, they are
also trying to get an increase in
power now.
Both must succeed or fail to
gether, because if only one gets
an increase it will have too much
interference around the other's
transmitter and violate FCC
standards, Goldman said. The
two stations have been working
together in their attempts to raise
power, he added.
"They've been very patient
with us this summer," he said.
"We had some trouble with the

transmitter equipment and
would accidently begin to inter
fere with their signal. That's
cleaned up now and we've been
working well together to get the
increases."
The FCC has a 2V2-year
backlog of applications, and this
is causing considerable delay on
the action on KZSU's applica
tion, according to Goldman. Re
cently the chairman of the FCC
insisted the backlog be elimi
nated. Since that time there have
been no new applications ac
cepted.
"They think they'll be up to
date by next January," said
Goldman, "so we'll hopefully
know by then one way or the
other."
According to Tom Hedges,
KZSU'schief engineer, thephys
ical plant and studios are all in
the condition such that "we
could go to higher power within
a week of getting word from the
FCC, we're that ready. We're re
ally at their mercy." Recent im
provements have been made in
the large studio, equipping it for
newscasts and improving the
audio circuitry, he said.
According to the manage
ment, there is a heavy rumor that
KUSF, the University of San
Francisco station, which is also
close to KZSU on the dial, has
gotten their increase recently.
"This is a good sign for all of
us," Goldman said. "We're very
hopeful."
Today and tomorrow, KZSU
will broadcast special music for
the registration and will offer
live bi-hourlv "traffic reports"
on the congestion in Maples
Pavilion. It will also have a booth
in Maples for questions and raps.
