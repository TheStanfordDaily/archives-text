# Human rights largely Ignored, says Amnesty International
## 
### 
London (AP) — More than 100 countries
throughout the world jailed people tor their be
liefs, denied them fair trials, tortured them or
otherwise violated their human rights in 1975-70,
Amnesty International reported yesterday.
Most of the countries mentioned are communist
or in the third world, but the United States, Bri
tain, France and Sweden also came in for scrutiny.
The United Nations Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, proclaimed in 1948, is still largely
ignored, said the London-based human rights or
ganization in its report for the year June 1975
through May 1976.
Institutions like the U.N. Commission on
Human Rights "are not immune from political
pressure" and governments are reluctant to
submit to effective international control of their
behavior on human rights," wrote Amnesty's
executive committee chairman Dirk Boerner, in a
preface to the report.
As of May, the organization said, it was inves
tigating or working on behalf of 3859 prisoners. It
made protests or took other action in 112 coun
tries over the year. The organization claims more
than 97,000 members in 78 countries.
Amnesty said it is impossible to estimate the
number of political prisoners in the United States.
It said Amnesty groups "are working on eight
cases of American prisoners."
"People are not officially imprisoned in the Un
ited States because of their political views or ac
tions . . . but in some cases it is difficult to avoid
the suspicion that an individual's imprisonment
may be due to his political actions, rather than to
the crime which he or she is alleged to have com
mitted," it said.
In a regional review the report said:
—On Africa: "Detention without trial. Major
political trials weighted heavily against the ac

cused, torture and the death sentence have all
continued to feature as aspects of government in
many African states: very few are without at least
one of these evils."
—On Latin America: "Throughout 1975-76
there has been a slight but unmistakable deterio
ration in the overall human rights situation in the
Americas," particularly in Chile, Argentina,
Brazil and Uruguay.
"Approximately 30,000 political prisoners are
believed held in these four countries alone." It
claimed one of every 500 citizens in Uruguay is a
political prisoner.
—On Asia: "It can be said of hardly any Asian
country that the judiciary in the exercise of its
functions acts with integrity and faith in ordinary
principles of justice. Nor is it common for the
legal profession of most Asian countries to take a
strong public position against persistent erosion
of civil liberties."
—On Europe: "The incidence of political im
prisonment varies from one state to another. But it
is common to all of Europe that almost all prison
ers of conscience are tried, sentenced and impris
oned under domestic legislation which specifi
cally restricts the exercise of freedom of consci
ence."
—On the Middle East: "There is ... a general
lack of awareness in the Middle East of individual
legal rights, both nationally and internationally.
In the Soviet Union, the report said, Amnesty
International has adopted or is investigating the
cases of about 320 "prisoners of conscience."
It also outlined cases in Eastern Europe and
gave prominent mention to India, Iraq, Iran, In
donesia, South Africa and Rhodesia.
In Sweden, the report said, Amnesty took on the
cases of two conscientious objectors who were
jailed after disagreements with the government
over civilian'alternatives to military service.
