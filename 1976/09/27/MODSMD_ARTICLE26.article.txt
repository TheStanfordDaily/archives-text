Palestinians hanged by Syrians
Damascus, Syria — A Palestinian commando
team captured a Damascus luxury hotel yesterday
and held about 90 hostages until Syrian troops
blasted them out in a bloody three-hour battle.
One terrorist and four hostages died in the fight,
and within 24 hours the government announced
that it had hanged the three surviving terrorists.
The three were executed in front of the hotel at
dawn today, the official Damascus radio said.
The commandos called themselves the "Black
June" group, security officers said, in apparent re
ference to Syria's military intervention last June
against Palestinian guerrillas in the Lebanese civil
war.
Red-bereted Syrian military police and
plainclothes intelligence agents killed the com
mando leader and captured three others of the
four-man band, a government statement said.
It was not clear if the hostages were kil led prior to
the Syrian assault on the hotel. The government
statement said only, "The commandos killed four
hostages, including three women, and wounded 34
others."
Three Americans were reported in the hotel dur
ing the attack and witnesses said one American was
among the hostages, but a spokesman for the U.S.
Embassy said no Americans were hurt in the shoot
out. Witnesses said all four hostages killed were
Arabs.
Ford in South; Chavez backs Carter
President Gerald Ford launched the second
phase of a political drive across Jimmy Carter's
Southland yesterday while the Democratic presi
dential nominee campaigned in California, talking
taxes and looking for the Mexican-American vote.
President Ford campaigned along the Missis
sippi Gulf Coast, asserting that Democrat Jimmy
Carter advocates excessive federal spending at
home, but wants to make defense budget cuts that
"would be disastrous."
Since arriving in Louisiana on Saturday, Ford
has sought to demonstrate that Carter can be beaten
in the South.
Carter blamed Republican mismanagement of
the nation's economy for sharply rising local prop
erty taxes yesterday and proposed a four-point
program to reduce the burden of local taxes.
He campaigned intensively among Spanish
speaking voters by riding in a Mexican indepen
dence day parade in Santa Ana, and attending a
get-out-the-vote rally in the hills near San Juan
Capistrano. Carter won the endorsement over the
weekend of Cesar Chavez, California farm workers

organizer and a leader in the state's Spanish
speaking community, and George Christopher,
former Republican mayor of San Francisco, who
said he was disillusioned with President Ford's
domestic and foreign policies.
Kidnap victim found tied to post
Jacksonville, Fla. — Sheri Jaffa, the 35-year-old
wife of a wealthy contractor, was found in satisfac
tory condition yesterday bound to a post in a field
where she had been for 91V2 hours after she was
abducted and $200,000 in ransom demanded for
her release.
Police said Jack McWilliams, already serving a
jail sentence on weekends in another case, was
charged with kidnaping, and a woman also was
being held in connection with the case. McWil
liams' brother is a business partner of Mrs. Jaffa's
husband, Richard.
Mrs. Jaffa disappeared Wednesday. A televised
tearful appeal from Jaffa, including a pledge to pay
a $200,000 ransom demand, failed to win her re
lease.
Arthur Nehrbass, in charge of the Jacksonville
FBI office, said a map drawn by Edith Burton, 22,
led officers to the spot. He said Mrs. Burton, who
was identified as a German national afraid of being
deported, lived with McWilliams, 39.
Officials initially said Mrs. Burton was being
held as a material witness, but later refused to dis
cuss her status. During McWilliams' arraignment,
she was referred to as a "suspected accomplice."
Thirty-five die in U.S. plane crashes
A military jet transport and three privately
owned planes crashed within six hours of each
other in four states yesterday, claiming the lives of
35 persons, including 13 Air Force officers and four
executives of a major pharmaceutical firm.
Air Force officials said there were five survivors
of the crash of a KC-135 transport jet, the military
equivalent of a Boeing 707, near Alpena, Mich.
Fifteen other persons aboard the aircraft —13 offic
ers and two sergeants — died when the plane
crashed and exploded in a swamp near the Lower
Michigan community about 8:30 a.m.
There were no survivors in the other crashes,
which occurred near Hot Springs, Va.; Steamboat
Springs, Colo., and Peoria, 111.
In Virginia, four executives of Johnson & Johnson
subsidiaries and their wives were killed when a
company-owned Grumman Gulfstream II jet struck
the side of a mountain and crashed short of the

runway at Ingalls Field. Three crew members were
also killed.
The Colorado crash of an Aztec Piper plane took
six lives, according to a Federal Aviation Administ
ration spokesman in Denver.
The twin-engine plane caught fire after slam
ming into two propane fuel storage tanks shortly
after takeoff about 1:10 p.m. from an airport at
Steamboat Springs, a ski and summer resort com
munity in northwestern Colorado.
In Peoria, 111., three persons died when their
single-engine aircraft crashed into the Illinois River
shortly after takeoff from Mount Hawley Airport
about noon, police said.
Grandchildren interested
Paris — Rose Kennedy, mother of a president and
two U.S. senators, says her grandchildren are in
terested in politics and she hopes to see another
Kennedy in the White House some day.
But in a telephone interview with Radio Luxem
bourg yesterday, Mrs. Kennedy said she advised
her only surviving son, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
to stay out of the presidential race for fear of an
assassination attempt. Two of Kennedy's brothers,
President John F. Kennedy and Sen. Robert F. Ken
nedy, were shot to death by assassins.
Mrs. Kennedy was quoted by Radio Luxembourg
as saying she has no strong feelings about the pres
idential contest this year but that she'll vote for
Jimmy Carter because he is a Democrat.
