## Delt organization, athletes disciplined 
### 
Five varsity athletes who took part
in a spring "trashing" spree by mem
bers of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
were suspended by President Richard
Lyman after the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) had recommended that
the five be disciplined.
Although the SJC recommended
harsher penalties, Lyman imposed
one-quarter suspensions on four cur
rent undergraduates: football letter
men Gary Anderson, Mark Hill and
Rich Waters, and varsity basketball
forward George Schader. None of the
four will miss his sport's season.
The fifth Delt, last season's starting
football center Todd Anderson, was
suspended for the entire 1976-77
school year. Although he is 17 units
short of graduation, Anderson used up
his football eligibility last year.
Another member of the fraternity
and varsity football player, Mike Wil
kinson, received an 80-hour "work
fine" as punishment from Lyman.
As a result of the incident, in which
15 Delts and 12 friends raided four
other fraternity houses and caused
minor damage, the fraternity was sus
pended from its on-campus residence
for three years.
Because the Delts expelled and fined
some members for their roles in the
trashing, however, Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons indicated that the

fraternity may be eligible for
reinstatement as early as autumn of
next year. A previous Delt suspension
ended in the fall of 1974.
"I trust that it will be clear from this
case," Lyman noted, "that behavior of
the kind exhibited by the (suspended
students) will be met with meaningful
penalties at Stanford, whatever may be
the alleged force of 'tradition' in its
favor."
The SJC had recommended that each
of the Delts (except Todd Anderson) be
suspended for two quarters, starting
this fall. That penalty would have
rendered all four ineligiblefor compet
ition this academic year.
