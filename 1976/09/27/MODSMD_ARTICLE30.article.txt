# Pub plan hits snag
## 
### 
The long-awaited on-campus
pub now appears to be as far off as a
change in California's drinking age.
Plans for the pub were suspended
indefinitely because a liquor
license granted by the state to TDS,
the firm which manages Tresidder
concessions, would prohibit per
sons under 21 from entering.
"I have a whole lot of concerns
(about the pub) . . . I'm not sure it's
the right thing to do," said Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Dan Wil

liams, adding that he had decided
to "sit on this for a while."
Williams said he thought that
barring a large number of under
graduate students from the pub
would be objectionable because
"everything we've always done at
Tresidder is for everybody."
Under plans being considered
earlier this year, the pub would
have been constructed in the pre
sent games area of the Tresidder
bowling alley.
