# Stanford Press closes shop
## 
### 
The Stanford Press has closed up shop. Rather than pay
for large-scale replacement of outmoded equipment, the
univsrsity decided in the spring that summer would be
the last season of printing operations.
The press had a slow "hot type" system instead of the
computer-operated photo-typesetting units used by most
modern printers. University estimates indicated that re
modeling the press would cost almost $1 million â€” and

demand for the press' printing had been steadily declin
ing.
The closing meant the end of a career for most of the 10
linotype operators employed by the press. Few printers
now use the bulky linotype machines. "Times change."
said one of the linotypists. "I'll be getting another job, but
it won't be operating one of these machines."
The University will now contract its printing out.
