# Student trustee proposal nixed again
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees has rebuffed a
bid by the ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) to have a student member
placed on the board. In a unanimous
ruling made June 11, the trustees said
students should not serve because they
represent a special-interest group.
In a letter to the COP, then-Board
Chairman Robert Minge Brown wrote.
"The board strongly believes that
maintaining a position of detached

concern is essential. . . and to do so the
members of the board must come to it
as individuals and not as representa
tives of an interest or constituency."
The letter noted that although an in
creasing number of colleges and uni
versities have added student trustees,
"what may be appropriate for those in
stitutions is not necessarily so for Stan
ford,"
The request for a student trustee

came in April from now-departed
members of the COP, which was then
headed by Lee Rosenbaum. But ac
cording to ASSU vice president Deric
lennings, the current COP members
don't consider the student trustee
question a major issue.
"My present feeling is that the COP
is skeptical that a student member
could make that much difference," he
said. "We're probably not going to
pursue it."
