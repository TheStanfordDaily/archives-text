# Researcher murdered
## 
### 
| A postdoctoral researcher in
| chemistry was found dead in his
| Menlo Park apartment July 20, and
| a coroner's investigation indicated
| that he may have been bound with
adhesive tape and strangled.
Fdward McNeill, 25, was the fifth
â€¢ murder victim in the Stanford
| community in the past five years.
Like all four other cases, the
McNeill case remains unsolved,
| with little evidence and few leads
| for police to work on.
