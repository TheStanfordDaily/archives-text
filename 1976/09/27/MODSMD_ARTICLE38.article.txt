Scientists aid NASA
While Viking I, the unmanned space probe, was
circling Mars in July, several Stanford professors were
hard at work in Pasadena, helping in the search for a
safe landing site.
Von Eshelman. a professor in the electrical engineer
ing department, headed a NASA committee that re
viewed radar data on proposed landing sites, and his
colleague C.eorge Tyler led a team of scientists who
examined the surface texture of the sites. Both men
were instrumental in the NASA decision not to land the
probe on July 4. as originally planned, but to select
another, safer landing site.
Four other Stanford scientists have participated in
the project in fields ranging from biology to seismology
and radar astronomy.
Bookstore expands
Because the bookstore was. in the words of one ad
ministrator, "bursting at the seams," construction
crews broke ground for a new bookstore wing in late
August. Thp expansion will eventually include exten

sions of the main floor and mezzanine and a new base
ment for storage.
The expansion project will take 18 months and cost
almost $3 million, of which a university loan ac
counted for $2 million.
New phone system
A new long-distance phone system installed this
summer may save the university $200,000 by limiting
long-distance calls to those callers who have special
authorization numbers.
Persons wanting to make calls outside the Bay Area
now must dial "1" and then the authorization number
before they can place their calls. The new system com
bines Wide Area Telecommunications Service (WATS)
with a mini-computer that selects the least costly avail
able circuits. All long-distance calls will now be free
for the first minute.
Rut, warns one university official, "it's necessary
that those who have got an authorized number are very
careful and don't let it out." Otherwise, she warns,
monumental billins problems could result
