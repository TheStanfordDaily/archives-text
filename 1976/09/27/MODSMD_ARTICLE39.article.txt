# Republicans rally for candidates at convention

(From left to right) Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, a central figure at past
national GOP conventions, chats with delegates as more conservative Re
publicans such as President Gerald Ford steal the limelight â€”in this case,
the stage light. The television cameras were focused on Rocky, however, as
he held a telephone ripped from the floor of the New York delegation after the
former New York governor grabbed a Reagan sign from a North Carolina
delegate. Supporters of former California governor Ronald Reagan tooted
their horns louder and longer but when the votes were tallied Ford stole the
show.
