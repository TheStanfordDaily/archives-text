Negotiations between the university
and the Stanford Police Officers As
sociation (SPOA) for the transfer of
bomb squad and search team duties
from the Stanford Fire Department to
the Stanford University Department of
Public Safety (SUDPS) have broken
down, according to SPOA President
Herman Williams.
The transfer of bomb squad duties
from the fire department to the SUDPS
is one of the actions preliminary to the
pending merger of the Palo Alto and
Stanford Fire Departments.
Williams, an SUDPS deputy sheriff,
said that he has written a letter to
Robert Augsburger, vice president for
business and finance, requesting grie
vance arbitration.
A statement released by the SPOA
charged that the university, rep
resented by SUDPS director Marvin
Herrington, did not respond to SPOA
proposals presented at a negotiation
session last Friday.
"The university did not respond to
our request for hazard pay. disability
and death benefits. The university has
forced the,SPOA to go to grievance and
arbitration." the SPOA statement said.
Neither Herrington nor Augsburger
were available for comment.
