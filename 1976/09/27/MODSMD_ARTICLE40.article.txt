# Presidential race now even: Lipset
## 
### Marc Strassman 
"The machines were so re
volted by then that they couldn't
take it anymore, and so they
broke down."
Thus did Political Science
and Sociology Prof. Seymour
Martin Lipset quote media guru
Marshall McLuhan on the cause
of the 27 minute audio failure
during Thursday night's presi
dential debates between Presi
dent Gerald Ford and former
Georgia Gov. Jimmy Garter.
The candidates themselves
were "like prizefighters who
were afraid of each other. They
were both so primed not to make
a mistake that their main
thought was not 'How do I make
a point?' but 'How do I avoid a
disaster?' " Lipset said.
During a beer-and-pretzel re
ception for new graduate stu
dents in the Sociology Depart
ment Lounge Friday afternoon.
Lipset also said that he now sees
the presidential race as even.
"They're 45 per cent —45 per
cent," he said. "Ford gains day
by day, while Garter's been
doing badly."
Gohen backs Jimmy
Sociology Department Ghair
man Bernard Gohen, who
characterizes himself as "an
early supporter" of the Democra
tic nominee, feels that Garter
will win.
"There are more Democrats
than Republicans," he pointed
out, "and if the campaign goes
along as it has been, with no

serious mistakes on either side,
this fact will win it for Garter."
Gohen also had an explanation
for what he called a "notorious
lack of interest" by students in
the campaign and in politics
generally: "In a tight economic
situation, when people have to
worry about jobs, the career
orientation will dominate
people's lives."
Activism must wait
Any new upsurge in political
activism, he says, will have to
wait until there is more "loose
ness" in the economic situation.
Gohen commented on the
local 12th District Gongressional
contest between Republican
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey, a
graduate of the Law School, and
former student body president
David Harris, a Democrat.
"McCloskey is hard to beat,
but David Harris is a good can
didate. . . . This is going to be a
hard one for all of us old liberals
who've gotten into voting for
McCloskey," Gohen said.
"McCloskey's very intelligent,
but I think a lot of us Democrats
will be going back to the party
and all that that means."
McCloskey opposed Richard
Nixon for the Republican presi
dential nomination in 1972. In
recent elections, Stanford stu
dents have backed him strongly.
Harris spent 20 months in prison
during the Vietnam war for re
sisting the draft.
