# 'Clearing House' aids apartment-seekers
## 
### Steve Schiller 
To assist students seeking
off-campus housing, the Office
of Rental Housing is sponsoring
a "Clearing House" in Tresidder
Union through tomorrow.
Student co-directors Tony
Haney and Kalya Templin and a
staff of 11 volunteers have
helped place more than 1000
students in rental housing since
the "Clearing House" opened on
Sept. 7.
Hired by June Becker of the Of
fice of Rental Housing late last
spring, Templin and Haney
worked through the summer to
assemble a three-pronged effort
to place students in suitable
housing this fall.
First, the co-directors col
lected housing information and
rental listings by means of adver
tising, articles in local newspap
ers, and personal contact to
renters and real estate boards.
A "Clearing House Hotel,"
headed by ASSU Vice President
Al Tomaszczuk, was set up in
Stern Hall and the Eating Clubs
to provide temporary, inexpen
sive room and board to students
looking for housing. The
"Hotel" ran from Sept. 7 through
last Monday and accommodated
362 people, according to

Kemplin.
Tresidder is the location for an
information and listing center
where students will be able to
look up listings, make phone in
quiries and examine advice
about rents and landlord-tenant
relations through tomorrow.
Templin and Haney have re
commended "shopping around"
and will encourage more stu
dents to seek out potential hous
ing in the early spring, although
they acknowledge that a recently
revised on-campus housing sys
tem has eased the panic for off
campus living.
A special success in the fifth
year of "Clearing House" was
the series of social events ar
ranged, according to the co
directors.
