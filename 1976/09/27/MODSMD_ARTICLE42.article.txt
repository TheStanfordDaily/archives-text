# Grand jury calls Hearst to testify in Harris case
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Patricia Hearst, a federal
prisoner under a seven-year sentence, will make
her first appearance as a grand jury witness today
in a secret session aimed at indicting her former
fugitive traveling companions, William and
Emily Harris.
Hearst's attorneys confirmed that she will he
taken from her cell at the Federal Youth Correc
tional Facility at Pleasanton on the short ride to
the Alameda County courthouse.
There, she is expected to repeat the story of her
Feb. 4,1974. kidnaping by the Symbionese Liber
ation Army (SLA) — an ordeal which she de
scribed at her bank robbery trial earlier this year.
Attorneys for the 22-year-old heiress had
warned earlier that her effectiveness as a state
witness would be diminished by a stiff prison
sentence. Attorney Al Johnson called the seven
year sentence imposed Friday "unduly harsh."
However, the Alameda County District Attor
ney's office is expected to back up Hearst's tes
timony with numerous corroborating witnesses
including Hearst's former fiance, Steven Weed.
Weed and Hearst, who have not seen each other
since the kidnaping, are not expected to meet
during their appearances at the courthouse today.
The Harrises, convicted of kidnaping and rob
bery in Los Angeles last month, were arraigned on
a criminal complaint in Hearst's kidnapping last
week. Hut a formal indictment is being sought.
The Harrises' attorney, Leonard Weinglass, ac
cused authoritiesof timing thegrand jury hearing
to follow Hearst's sentencing — thus avoiding
accusations that her testimony might be part of a
deal for a lighter sentence.

Wei nglass has attacked her credibility, as she is
a convicted felon.
Hearst's attorneys said in their notice of appeal
of her bank robbery conviction that "imprison
ment of the defendant would result in a substan
tial loss of effectiveness of the defendant in pro
viding testimony in ancillary criminal proceed
ings."
Nevertheless, she is expected to make further
appearances before other investigating bodies in
connection with crimes she may have witnessed
while underground with the SLA.
Meanwhile, Hearst was visited in prison by her
parents, sisters, attorneys and an Episcopal priest.
Her father, Randolph Hearst, said after visiting
his daughter: "She was the only one who has been
absolutely correct all the time. But she under
stands what she is facing. She is looking toward
the appeal. She has a lot of strength."
Hearst's family and lawyers have said previ
ously that she was never hopeful of getting a light
sentence and expected the worst.
Johnson said, "I'm terribly worried about her
mental and physical health as well as her personal
safety in an institution."
He said he had hoped she would be able to get
psychotherapy outside of a prison atmosphere,
but those hopes were dashed when U.S. District
Court judge William Orrick sentenced her Friday.
Authorities have not yet announced where
Hearst will serve her time, but it was reported
yesterday that she might be allowed to stay at the
Pleasanton facility, an institution designed to
look like a college campus with dormitories, a
gymnasium and classrooms.
