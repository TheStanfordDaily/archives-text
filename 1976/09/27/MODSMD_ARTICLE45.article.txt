## Benjamin only human, and so are Spartans Stanford wins home opener 28-23 
### Chris Baker 
It wasn't the most artistic col
lege football game you ever saw,
with six fumbles, one intercep
tion and enough penalties to
make it seem as though the field
were marked in yellow.
But Stanford's 28-23 region
ally televised win over San Jose
State Saturday was still the
Cards first win of the season and
they'll take it.
Card quarterback Guy Benja
min, making his first start of the
three-game old season and only
the fourth of his career on the
Farm, showed the crowd of
51,000, largest ever to see a
Stanford-San Jose State en
counter, that he's just a regular
guy after all.
After completing a pass on the
Cards' first possession of the
game, an eight yarder to flanker
James Lofton, he fumbled the
snap from center Mark Hill.
The miscue gave the Spartans
excellent field position at the
Stanford 26-yard line.
It took San Jose State just five
plays to punch it in and take a
7-0 early first quarter lead, with
running back Walter Robinson
vaulting over the submarining
Stanford defenders, just like
Sam "Bam" Cunningham used
to do for USC.
Another Benjamin fumble,
this one at the Card 1-yard line,
caused a safety.
But when it counted Benjamin
was hot. With the Cards trailing
23-14 late in the third quarter
and Mike Cordova warming up,
he directed two touchdown
drives to put Stanford ahead for
good, 28-23.
Player-of-Game
The junior quarterback had
one of his best days as a Card,
completing 25 of 41 passes for
277 yards and two touchdowns.
The performance earned him
ABC offensive Player-of-the-
Game honors. And he was play
ing with a broken nose and
sprained ankle.
But as San Jose State coach
Lynn Stiles said, "Benjamin's
biggest asset was his poise under
pressure."
Pressure was certainly what

Benjamin faced on a fourth-and
inches situation at the Spartan
47-yard line late in the third
quarter.
Seeing that the San Jose de
fense had shifted into a goal line
defense, with eight men stacked
on the line, he audibled, cal
ling a play that had worked all
afternoon, a short slant-in to
wide receiver Bill Kellar, who
got five yards and a first down.
You might say it took guts to
call that play.
It just took Benjamin.
Stiles said Benjamin's fourth
and-inches call was a key play.
"Benjamin did a great job. He
had a goal line defense and he
audibled."
Mixing his plays well, Benja
min moved Stanford down to the
San Jose 19-yard line. Then on
second-and-six Kellar was al
most decapitated by Spartan de
fensive back Steve Himes. It was
a play that would have earned
Himes a fine in the NFL.
On the next play Benjamin
threw a 10-yard pass in the flat to
running back Phil Francis, who
took the ball into the end zone on
guts alone.
And when the aroused Stan
ford defense came off the field
after allowing San Jose State just
four plays, it got an honor usu
ally reserved for Benjamin — a
standing ovation.
But how could this be the
Stanford offense? Who were

those guys running the ball
through holes big enough to
drive an ABC television truck
through?
Good blocking
Running backs Donnv Steven
son and Gary Lynn, playing in
place of injured Ron Inge, were
running the ball through holes
opened by tackle Gordy King.
Benjamin threw just one pass,
a 15-yarder to reserve flanker
Vince Mulroy, who had the best
day of his Stanford career with
six catches for 90 yards, as the
Cards drove 55 yards in seven
plays to go ahead for good.
Stiles said those two drives
killed his Spartans, "1 think the
turning point was that our de
fense was unable to hold them
on their two drives," he said.
"Stanford just took the wind out
of our sail and ran right over us."
But some San Jose State fans
think that the men in the stri
ped shirts stole the game from
the Spartans.
In a play that San Jose State
fans will be talking about for a
long time, the officials denied
the Spartans a touchdown on the
last play of the first half.
San )ose quarterback Steve
Deßerg, who looked as if he had
a copy of the Card defensive
playbook, completed eight
straight passes in the last 1:39 of
the first half to move the Spar
tans to the Stanford 1-yard line.

just short of the goal line on the last play of the first half in
Saturday's game. The Cards came from behind to win,
28-23.
On a first-and-goal with one second remaining in the
half, DeBerg handed off to Robinson, who tucked the ball
deep into his arm and was hit by Card linebacker Gordy
Ceresino.
The 5-foot-8, 170-pound running back thought he had
crossed the plane of the goal line and so did his team
mates, who immediately raised their hands to signal
touchdown. But not the officials, who ruled that Robin
son's knee had touched before he skidded into the en
dzone.
Former Michigan State coach Duffy Daugherty, who
was doing color commentary for ABC Saturday, said that

Robinson had scored, after watching the instant replay
four times.
'Good call'
But Pacific-8 Supervisor of Officials Jack Sprenger. who
also saw the replay, said it was a good call. "You must cross
the plane of the goal line before your knee goes down. It
wasn't a touchdown."
"We thought Robinson was in and he thought he was
in," said Stiles. "We'll just have to look at the films."
But the call that angered Stiles the most was a bit ironic
for Stanford.
San Jose State, for all its errors, was still in the contest
with just 1:27 left in the game. The defense had forced the
Cards to punt.
And San Jose was going to get good field position at the
Stanford 46.

But there was a yellow flag lying on the field. It seems
the Spartans had used 12 men to rush Michel. The 15-yard
penalty gave the Cards the ball again and Benjamin ate up
the clock.
"1 was disappointed with the 12-man call," said Stiles,
"because the man that stayed in the game never plays on
our special teams. We tried to get him out of there but it
was too late."
In the Cards' season opening 15-12 loss to Penn State,
the officials failed to detect that the Nittany Lions had
used a 12th man when they scored the winning
touchdown.
Justice.
San Jose State didn't think a holding call on the Spar
tans last drive of the contest was just. Deßerg completed
two 25-yard passes to move the Spartans down to the
Stanford 15-yard marker. But San Jose State center Paul
Kessler was detected holding when Robinson slashed off
left end for two yards.
Good defense
The penalty moved the ball back to the Stanford 30-yard
line and the Card defense, which earlier in the game had
looked like an open sieve, didn't break.
"They outsmarted us." said Stiles, "and we outsmarted
ourselves with a couple of key penalties."
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen took a different view
of the officiating. "I was very elated with the officiating,"
said Chris. "I think when they do a good job, you should
say so."
Hut the boos that hailed quarterback Mike Cordova and
Christiansen when the introductions were made before
the game angered the (lard coach.
"Apparently they thought I was going to start Cordova.
(Chris had the 12 seniors introduced.) But I don't care
what the reason is, it's bullshit."

San Jose State didn't think a holding call on the Spar
tans last drive of the contest was just. Deßerg completed
two 25-yard passes to move the Spartans down to the
Stanford 15-yard marker. But San Jose State center Paul
Kessler was detected holding when Robinson slashed off
left end for two yards.
Good defense
The penalty moved the ball back to the Stanford 30-yard
line and the Card defense, which earlier in the game had
looked like an open sieve, didn't break.
"They outsmarted us." said Stiles, "and we outsmarted
ourselves with a couple of key penalties."
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen took a different view
of the officiating. "I was very elated with the officiating,"
said Chris. "I think when they do a good job, you should
say so."
Hut the boos that hailed quarterback Mike Cordova and
Christiansen when the introductions were made before
the game angered the (lard coach.
"Apparently they thought I was going to start Cordova.
(Chris had the 12 seniors introduced.) But I don't care
what the reason is, it's bullshit."
It wasn't the most artistic col
lege football game you ever saw,
with six fumbles, one intercep
tion and enough penalties to
make it seem as though the field
were marked in yellow.
But Stanford's 28-23 region
ally televised win over San Jose
State Saturday was still the
Cards first win of the season and
they'll take it.
Card quarterback Guy Benja
min, making his first start of the
three-game old season and only
the fourth of his career on the
Farm, showed the crowd of
51,000, largest ever to see a
Stanford-San Jose State en
counter, that he's just a regular
guy after all.
After completing a pass on the
Cards' first possession of the
game, an eight yarder to flanker
James Lofton, he fumbled the
snap from center Mark Hill.
The miscue gave the Spartans
excellent field position at the
Stanford 26-yard line.
It took San Jose State just five
plays to punch it in and take a
7-0 early first quarter lead, with
running back Walter Robinson
vaulting over the submarining
Stanford defenders, just like
Sam "Bam" Cunningham used
to do for USC.
Another Benjamin fumble,
this one at the Card 1-yard line,
caused a safety.
But when it counted Benjamin
was hot. With the Cards trailing
23-14 late in the third quarter
and Mike Cordova warming up,
he directed two touchdown
drives to put Stanford ahead for
good, 28-23.
Player-of-Game
The junior quarterback had
one of his best days as a Card,
completing 25 of 41 passes for
277 yards and two touchdowns.
The performance earned him
ABC offensive Player-of-the-
Game honors. And he was play
ing with a broken nose and
sprained ankle.
But as San Jose State coach
Lynn Stiles said, "Benjamin's
biggest asset was his poise under
pressure."
Pressure was certainly what

Benjamin faced on a fourth-and
inches situation at the Spartan
47-yard line late in the third
quarter.
Seeing that the San Jose de
fense had shifted into a goal line
defense, with eight men stacked
on the line, he audibled, cal
ling a play that had worked all
afternoon, a short slant-in to
wide receiver Bill Kellar, who
got five yards and a first down.
You might say it took guts to
call that play.
It just took Benjamin.
Stiles said Benjamin's fourth
and-inches call was a key play.
"Benjamin did a great job. He
had a goal line defense and he
audibled."
Mixing his plays well, Benja
min moved Stanford down to the
San Jose 19-yard line. Then on
second-and-six Kellar was al
most decapitated by Spartan de
fensive back Steve Himes. It was
a play that would have earned
Himes a fine in the NFL.
On the next play Benjamin
threw a 10-yard pass in the flat to
running back Phil Francis, who
took the ball into the end zone on
guts alone.
And when the aroused Stan
ford defense came off the field
after allowing San Jose State just
four plays, it got an honor usu
ally reserved for Benjamin — a
standing ovation.
But how could this be the
Stanford offense? Who were

those guys running the ball
through holes big enough to
drive an ABC television truck
through?
Good blocking
Running backs Donnv Steven
son and Gary Lynn, playing in
place of injured Ron Inge, were
running the ball through holes
opened by tackle Gordy King.
Benjamin threw just one pass,
a 15-yarder to reserve flanker
Vince Mulroy, who had the best
day of his Stanford career with
six catches for 90 yards, as the
Cards drove 55 yards in seven
plays to go ahead for good.
Stiles said those two drives
killed his Spartans, "1 think the
turning point was that our de
fense was unable to hold them
on their two drives," he said.
"Stanford just took the wind out
of our sail and ran right over us."
But some San Jose State fans
think that the men in the stri
ped shirts stole the game from
the Spartans.
In a play that San Jose State
fans will be talking about for a
long time, the officials denied
the Spartans a touchdown on the
last play of the first half.
San )ose quarterback Steve
Deßerg, who looked as if he had
a copy of the Card defensive
playbook, completed eight
straight passes in the last 1:39 of
the first half to move the Spar
tans to the Stanford 1-yard line.

Saturday's game. The Cards came from behind to win,

On a first-and-goal with one second remaining in the
half, DeBerg handed off to Robinson, who tucked the ball
deep into his arm and was hit by Card linebacker Gordy
Ceresino.
The 5-foot-8, 170-pound running back thought he had
crossed the plane of the goal line and so did his team
mates, who immediately raised their hands to signal
touchdown. But not the officials, who ruled that Robin

Robinson had scored, after watching the instant replay

But Pacific-8 Supervisor of Officials Jack Sprenger. who
also saw the replay, said it was a good call. "You must cross
the plane of the goal line before your knee goes down. It
wasn't a touchdown."
"We thought Robinson was in and he thought he was
in," said Stiles. "We'll just have to look at the films."
But the call that angered Stiles the most was a bit ironic
for Stanford.
San Jose State, for all its errors, was still in the contest
with just 1:27 left in the game. The defense had forced the
Cards to punt.
And San Jose was going to get good field position at the
Stanford 46.

But there was a yellow flag lying on the field. It seems
the Spartans had used 12 men to rush Michel. The 15-yard
penalty gave the Cards the ball again and Benjamin ate up
the clock.
"1 was disappointed with the 12-man call," said Stiles,
"because the man that stayed in the game never plays on
our special teams. We tried to get him out of there but it
was too late."
In the Cards' season opening 15-12 loss to Penn State,
the officials failed to detect that the Nittany Lions had
used a 12th man when they scored the winning
touchdown.
Justice.

But the call that angered Stiles the most was a bit ironic
for Stanford.
San Jose State, for all its errors, was still in the contest
with just 1:27 left in the game. The defense had forced the
Cards to punt.
And San Jose was going to get good field position at the
Stanford 46.

But there was a yellow flag lying on the field. It seems
the Spartans had used 12 men to rush Michel. The 15-yard
penalty gave the Cards the ball again and Benjamin ate up
the clock.
"1 was disappointed with the 12-man call," said Stiles,
"because the man that stayed in the game never plays on
our special teams. We tried to get him out of there but it
was too late."
In the Cards' season opening 15-12 loss to Penn State,
the officials failed to detect that the Nittany Lions had
used a 12th man when they scored the winning
touchdown.
Justice.
San Jose State didn't think a holding call on the Spar
tans last drive of the contest was just. Deßerg completed
two 25-yard passes to move the Spartans down to the
Stanford 15-yard marker. But San Jose State center Paul
Kessler was detected holding when Robinson slashed off
left end for two yards.
Good defense
The penalty moved the ball back to the Stanford 30-yard
line and the Card defense, which earlier in the game had
looked like an open sieve, didn't break.
"They outsmarted us." said Stiles, "and we outsmarted
ourselves with a couple of key penalties."
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen took a different view
of the officiating. "I was very elated with the officiating,"
said Chris. "I think when they do a good job, you should
say so."
Hut the boos that hailed quarterback Mike Cordova and
Christiansen when the introductions were made before
the game angered the (lard coach.
"Apparently they thought I was going to start Cordova.
(Chris had the 12 seniors introduced.) But I don't care
what the reason is, it's bullshit."
It wasn't the most artistic col
lege football game you ever saw,
with six fumbles, one intercep
tion and enough penalties to
make it seem as though the field
were marked in yellow.
But Stanford's 28-23 region
ally televised win over San Jose
State Saturday was still the
Cards first win of the season and
they'll take it.
Card quarterback Guy Benja
min, making his first start of the
three-game old season and only
the fourth of his career on the
Farm, showed the crowd of
51,000, largest ever to see a
Stanford-San Jose State en
counter, that he's just a regular
guy after all.
After completing a pass on the
Cards' first possession of the
game, an eight yarder to flanker
James Lofton, he fumbled the
snap from center Mark Hill.
The miscue gave the Spartans
excellent field position at the
Stanford 26-yard line.
It took San Jose State just five
plays to punch it in and take a
7-0 early first quarter lead, with
running back Walter Robinson
vaulting over the submarining
Stanford defenders, just like
Sam "Bam" Cunningham used
to do for USC.
Another Benjamin fumble,
this one at the Card 1-yard line,
caused a safety.
But when it counted Benjamin
was hot. With the Cards trailing
23-14 late in the third quarter
and Mike Cordova warming up,
he directed two touchdown
drives to put Stanford ahead for
good, 28-23.
Player-of-Game
The junior quarterback had
one of his best days as a Card,
completing 25 of 41 passes for
277 yards and two touchdowns.
The performance earned him
ABC offensive Player-of-the-
Game honors. And he was play
ing with a broken nose and
sprained ankle.
But as San Jose State coach
Lynn Stiles said, "Benjamin's
biggest asset was his poise under
pressure."
Pressure was certainly what

Benjamin faced on a fourth-and
inches situation at the Spartan
47-yard line late in the third
quarter.
Seeing that the San Jose de
fense had shifted into a goal line
defense, with eight men stacked
on the line, he audibled, cal
ling a play that had worked all
afternoon, a short slant-in to
wide receiver Bill Kellar, who
got five yards and a first down.
You might say it took guts to
call that play.
It just took Benjamin.
Stiles said Benjamin's fourth
and-inches call was a key play.
"Benjamin did a great job. He
had a goal line defense and he
audibled."
Mixing his plays well, Benja
min moved Stanford down to the
San Jose 19-yard line. Then on
second-and-six Kellar was al
most decapitated by Spartan de
fensive back Steve Himes. It was
a play that would have earned
Himes a fine in the NFL.
On the next play Benjamin
threw a 10-yard pass in the flat to
running back Phil Francis, who
took the ball into the end zone on
guts alone.
And when the aroused Stan
ford defense came off the field
after allowing San Jose State just
four plays, it got an honor usu
ally reserved for Benjamin — a
standing ovation.
But how could this be the
Stanford offense? Who were

those guys running the ball
through holes big enough to
drive an ABC television truck
through?
Good blocking
Running backs Donnv Steven
son and Gary Lynn, playing in
place of injured Ron Inge, were
running the ball through holes
opened by tackle Gordy King.
Benjamin threw just one pass,
a 15-yarder to reserve flanker
Vince Mulroy, who had the best
day of his Stanford career with
six catches for 90 yards, as the
Cards drove 55 yards in seven
plays to go ahead for good.
Stiles said those two drives
killed his Spartans, "1 think the
turning point was that our de
fense was unable to hold them
on their two drives," he said.
"Stanford just took the wind out
of our sail and ran right over us."
But some San Jose State fans
think that the men in the stri
ped shirts stole the game from
the Spartans.
In a play that San Jose State
fans will be talking about for a
long time, the officials denied
the Spartans a touchdown on the
last play of the first half.
San )ose quarterback Steve
Deßerg, who looked as if he had
a copy of the Card defensive
playbook, completed eight
straight passes in the last 1:39 of
the first half to move the Spar
tans to the Stanford 1-yard line.

Saturday's game. The Cards came from behind to win,
28-23.
On a first-and-goal with one second remaining in the
half, DeBerg handed off to Robinson, who tucked the ball
deep into his arm and was hit by Card linebacker Gordy
Ceresino.
The 5-foot-8, 170-pound running back thought he had
crossed the plane of the goal line and so did his team
mates, who immediately raised their hands to signal
touchdown. But not the officials, who ruled that Robin
son's knee had touched before he skidded into the en

Robinson had scored, after watching the instant replay

But Pacific-8 Supervisor of Officials Jack Sprenger. who
also saw the replay, said it was a good call. "You must cross

On a first-and-goal with one second remaining in the
half, DeBerg handed off to Robinson, who tucked the ball
deep into his arm and was hit by Card linebacker Gordy
Ceresino.
The 5-foot-8, 170-pound running back thought he had
crossed the plane of the goal line and so did his team
mates, who immediately raised their hands to signal
touchdown. But not the officials, who ruled that Robin
son's knee had touched before he skidded into the en
dzone.

Robinson had scored, after watching the instant replay
four times.
'Good call'
But Pacific-8 Supervisor of Officials Jack Sprenger. who
also saw the replay, said it was a good call. "You must cross
the plane of the goal line before your knee goes down. It
wasn't a touchdown."
"We thought Robinson was in and he thought he was
in," said Stiles. "We'll just have to look at the films."
But the call that angered Stiles the most was a bit ironic
for Stanford.
San Jose State, for all its errors, was still in the contest
with just 1:27 left in the game. The defense had forced the
Cards to punt.
And San Jose was going to get good field position at the
Stanford 46.

But there was a yellow flag lying on the field. It seems
the Spartans had used 12 men to rush Michel. The 15-yard
penalty gave the Cards the ball again and Benjamin ate up
the clock.
"1 was disappointed with the 12-man call," said Stiles,
"because the man that stayed in the game never plays on
our special teams. We tried to get him out of there but it
was too late."
In the Cards' season opening 15-12 loss to Penn State,
the officials failed to detect that the Nittany Lions had
used a 12th man when they scored the winning
touchdown.
Justice.
San Jose State didn't think a holding call on the Spar
tans last drive of the contest was just. Deßerg completed
two 25-yard passes to move the Spartans down to the
Stanford 15-yard marker. But San Jose State center Paul
Kessler was detected holding when Robinson slashed off
left end for two yards.
Good defense
The penalty moved the ball back to the Stanford 30-yard
line and the Card defense, which earlier in the game had
looked like an open sieve, didn't break.
"They outsmarted us." said Stiles, "and we outsmarted
ourselves with a couple of key penalties."
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen took a different view
of the officiating. "I was very elated with the officiating,"
said Chris. "I think when they do a good job, you should
say so."
Hut the boos that hailed quarterback Mike Cordova and
Christiansen when the introductions were made before
the game angered the (lard coach.
"Apparently they thought I was going to start Cordova.
(Chris had the 12 seniors introduced.) But I don't care
what the reason is, it's bullshit."
It wasn't the most artistic col
lege football game you ever saw,
with six fumbles, one intercep
tion and enough penalties to
make it seem as though the field
were marked in yellow.
But Stanford's 28-23 region
ally televised win over San Jose
State Saturday was still the
Cards first win of the season and
they'll take it.
Card quarterback Guy Benja
min, making his first start of the
three-game old season and only
the fourth of his career on the
Farm, showed the crowd of
51,000, largest ever to see a
Stanford-San Jose State en
counter, that he's just a regular
guy after all.
After completing a pass on the
Cards' first possession of the
game, an eight yarder to flanker
James Lofton, he fumbled the
snap from center Mark Hill.
The miscue gave the Spartans
excellent field position at the
Stanford 26-yard line.
It took San Jose State just five
plays to punch it in and take a
7-0 early first quarter lead, with
running back Walter Robinson
vaulting over the submarining
Stanford defenders, just like
Sam "Bam" Cunningham used
to do for USC.
Another Benjamin fumble,
this one at the Card 1-yard line,
caused a safety.
But when it counted Benjamin
was hot. With the Cards trailing
23-14 late in the third quarter
and Mike Cordova warming up,
he directed two touchdown
drives to put Stanford ahead for
good, 28-23.
Player-of-Game
The junior quarterback had
one of his best days as a Card,
completing 25 of 41 passes for
277 yards and two touchdowns.
The performance earned him
ABC offensive Player-of-the-
Game honors. And he was play
ing with a broken nose and
sprained ankle.
But as San Jose State coach
Lynn Stiles said, "Benjamin's
biggest asset was his poise under
pressure."
Pressure was certainly what

Benjamin faced on a fourth-and
inches situation at the Spartan
47-yard line late in the third
quarter.
Seeing that the San Jose de
fense had shifted into a goal line
defense, with eight men stacked
on the line, he audibled, cal
ling a play that had worked all
afternoon, a short slant-in to
wide receiver Bill Kellar, who
got five yards and a first down.
You might say it took guts to
call that play.
It just took Benjamin.
Stiles said Benjamin's fourth
and-inches call was a key play.
"Benjamin did a great job. He
had a goal line defense and he
audibled."
Mixing his plays well, Benja
min moved Stanford down to the
San Jose 19-yard line. Then on
second-and-six Kellar was al
most decapitated by Spartan de
fensive back Steve Himes. It was
a play that would have earned
Himes a fine in the NFL.
On the next play Benjamin
threw a 10-yard pass in the flat to
running back Phil Francis, who
took the ball into the end zone on
guts alone.
And when the aroused Stan
ford defense came off the field
after allowing San Jose State just
four plays, it got an honor usu
ally reserved for Benjamin — a
standing ovation.
But how could this be the
Stanford offense? Who were

those guys running the ball
through holes big enough to
drive an ABC television truck
through?
Good blocking
Running backs Donnv Steven
son and Gary Lynn, playing in
place of injured Ron Inge, were
running the ball through holes
opened by tackle Gordy King.
Benjamin threw just one pass,
a 15-yarder to reserve flanker
Vince Mulroy, who had the best
day of his Stanford career with
six catches for 90 yards, as the
Cards drove 55 yards in seven
plays to go ahead for good.
Stiles said those two drives
killed his Spartans, "1 think the
turning point was that our de
fense was unable to hold them
on their two drives," he said.
"Stanford just took the wind out
of our sail and ran right over us."
But some San Jose State fans
think that the men in the stri
ped shirts stole the game from
the Spartans.
In a play that San Jose State
fans will be talking about for a
long time, the officials denied
the Spartans a touchdown on the
last play of the first half.
San )ose quarterback Steve
Deßerg, who looked as if he had
a copy of the Card defensive
playbook, completed eight
straight passes in the last 1:39 of
the first half to move the Spar
tans to the Stanford 1-yard line.
