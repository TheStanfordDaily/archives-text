# Cardinals humiliated, 51-0
## 
### Paul Bauman 
ANN ARBOR, Mich.—
Stanford came to Ann Arbor,
Mich. 10 days ago confident,
loose — maybe too loose — re
spected by the Michigan Wol
verines and downright feared by
the local press.
The Cardinals left town stun
ned, embarrassed, dejected, 0-2
and as quickly as possible.
What happened in between
was a joke, 51-0, with Michigan
the laugher and Stanford the
laughee.
Card fans have to go back quite
a ways to find a more depressing
loss. The last time Stanford was
shut out was in 1967 when USC
beat the Indians 30-0. Stanford's
51-point loss was its worst in 22
years. UCLA killed the Indians
72-0 in 1954.
Deserves credit
Michigan, ranked No. 1 by the
Associated Press, must be given
credit. The Wolverines played
like national champions and
made a pretty good team look
terrible. They did it with great
offensive line blocking, nearly
flawless execution of the option
by quarterback Rick Leach and
the running backs, a good pass
rush and solid tackling.
Stanford's defense impeded
Michigan not in the least, as the
score would imply. The Wol
verines gained 531 yards on the
ground, 42 short of their own
all-time Big Ten record. Michi
gan backs averaged nearly nine
yards per carry.
Individually, sophomore Har
lan Huckleby, a possible future
HeismanTrophy winner, gained
157 yards, backup fullback Rus
sell Davis had 116 yards and tv/o
touchdowns and Rob Lytle ran
for 101 yards and a pair of TD's.
Wingback Jim Smith rushed for
72 yards on just three carries.
• Michigan was literally a threat
to score from anywhere on the
fteld on any play. The Wol
verines had runs of 85, 54, 51
and 48 yards from scrimmage

plus 10 runs of between 10 and 20
yards. The offensive line blew
holes so wide open in the Cards'
defensive line that the backs
often breezed through un
touched.
Even when a Michigan run
ning play failed to develop, the
Wolverines still gained four or
five yards. Whenever Stanford
picked up that much yardage on
a run, it was a big gainer.
15 yards passing
Leach obviously didn't have to
pass much, which was fortunate
for Michigan. He didn't impress
anybody with his arm, complet
ing two of eight passes for 15
yards. The score was 24-0 before
Leach completed his first pass.
There was no way Stanford
could have won on this day, but
the Cards themselves contri
buted to the size of the loss. Sev
eral trends that must have
bothered Stanford coaches car
ried over from the Penn State
game.
Once again, turnovers got the
Cards into early trouble. Stan
ford lost the ball on three of its
first five possessions.
First, Mike Cordova, who
started at quarterback but was
replaced by Guv Benjamin in the
second quarter, and fullback Phil
Francis messed up a handoff at
Stanford's 17-yard line. Michi
gan recovered, waltzed into the
end-zone three plays later and
took a 14-0 lead just eight mi
nutes into the game.
Two possessions later, Cor
dova threw a pass to James Lof
ton, playing for Tony Hill who
was out with a sprained ankle.
Lofton was hit immediately, the
ball popped up and Michigan in
tercepted. It didn't cost theCards

though as they stopped Michi
gan on downs.
The next time Stanford got the
ball, Gary Lynn, starting at
halfback for 1 the injured Ron
Inge, took a big hit and fumbled
after gaining 15 yards. Michigan
took over on the Card 45 and six
plays later the score was 21-0.
Five turnovers
In all, Stanford fumbled twice
and was intercepted three times.
"We've got to stop making
those damn, silly mistakes,"
Card coach Jack Christiansen
said after the game.
For the second straight time,
Stanford got very little (71 yards)
from its running game. Of
course, after getting behind by so
much so early, the Cards had to
rely on the pass the rest of the
game.
Scoring problems
The shutout meant that Stan
ford's offense, supposedly one of
the best in the country, had pro

duced only one touchdown in its
first two games. Not too impres
sive, even against two top teams.
The Cards, with Benjamin in, got
inside Michigan's 20 four times,
yet never scored.
Stanford played well on de
fense against Penn State, but the
Cards missed quite a few tackles
against Michigan.
The game also put Stanford's
quarterback situation up in the
air again, so to speak. Cordova
was yanked after he threw two
passes Christiansen felt he
should have held. Stanford was
already down 24-0 by this time,
and Chris said he felt something
had to be done.
Benjamin threw pretty well,
though not spectacularly. His
first pass of the season was inter
cepted, but he came back to
throw six straight completions.
Better protection
For some reason, Benjamin
