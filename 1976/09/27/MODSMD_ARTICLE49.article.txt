# Christiansen blasts officials
## Cards fumble opener 
### Chris Baker 
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa.—Six
times each fall afternoon,
Raymond Bower, Lawrence R.
Ellis, Richard Farina, Earl J.
Birdy, Jr. Joseph Browijlee and
Paul A. Baetz don striped shirts
and run out onto the Beaver
Stadium turf to officiate football
games.
If they ever decide to vacation
in Palo Alto, they'd better wear
masks when they visit the Farm.
Four times during Penn
State's 15-12 season opening
win over Stanford Sept. 15, they
did what the Nittany Lion de
fense couldn't do — stop Card
drives in Penn State territory.
Big penalties
Stanford, a team which spends
most of its practice time perfect
ing its passing attack, was
penalized for having ineligible
receivers downfield four times
during key drives.
But it was an error of omission
which killed the Cards. A couple
days after the loss, a newspaper
reporter in the Penn State area
informed the Stanford coaching
staff that the Nittany Lions had
12 men on the field when Penn
State fullback Matt Suhey scored
from six yards out for Penn
State's second and final
touchdown to make it 15-0.
The Stanford coaches got out
the projector and discovered that
Penn State did indeed have 12
men on the field when the win
ning touchdown was scored.
It should't have mattered.
With five minutes remaining
in the game, it looked like the
Cards were still very much in the
contest when quarterback Mike
Cordova overthrew split end Bill
Kellar in the endzone on a third
and 10 play from he PSU 15-yard
line.
The worst Stanford, behind
15-12, could do* was knot the
score at 15. Afterall, hadn't Mike
Michel already kicked a 52-
yarder earlier in the game? It
would be a simple 28-yard shot.
Yellow flag
But there was a bright yellow
flag lying on the turf after the
incompletion. A Stanford offen
sive lineman had been detected
downfield. The 15-yard loss and
an ensuing sack of Cordova,
when everyone in Centre Coun
try, Pa., knew Stanford was
about to pass, took the Cards out
of field goal range.
A relieved Penn State coach
Joe Paterno ordered the Nittany
Lions to sit on the ball. Penn
State's slim three point lead held
up.
After the game Stanford foot
ball coach Jack Christiansen
wasn't the happiest man in the
Happy Valley.
"The interpretation of the rule
(ineligible receiver) in the west
and east is different," said Chris
tiansen. "I don't know who is
right. From that standpoint, I'm
glad this was our last game
here."
Questioned further, Chris
said, "You should have a direct

line to the officials and ask them."
The Cards weren't just off.
During a first period which saw
them fumble the first three times
they had possession of the ball,
they were dead.
"It was the same kind of ball
game as the last two or three
years," said Christiansen. "From
the standpoint of breaks we put
ourselves into a deep hole and
couldn't come back."
Fumble
Stanford threw its first shovel
of dirt when safety Rich Waters
fumbled a semi-blocked punt by
Penn State punter John Lally on
the Nittany Lion 34.
The Card defense, which
played superbly throughout the
afternoon, had forced Penn State
to punt the ball away on its first
series. Lally received a bad snap
and managed to get oft an eight
yard punt.
But apparently Waters neg
lected to read the rulebook, which
was passed out to players on the
charter flight east. Waters tried
to pick up the ball instead of let
ting it roll dead.
So instead of having a first
down at the Penn State 34, the
Card offense could only warm
up on the sidelines, as the Lions
drove to their first touchdown of
the afternoon.
KickofT fumble
On the ensuing kickoff, James
Lofton fumbled the ball to give
the Lions a first down on the
Stanford 19-yard line. After two
incomplete passes and a running
play failed to move the ball, Lion
kicker Matt Bahr, the brother of
former Penn State All-American
kicker Chris Bahr, came in to
boot a 33-yard field goal to make
it 9-0.
Cordova and the offense fi
nally got the ball with 4:21 gone
in the first period, but three
plays later the controversial
senior quarterback didn't
exactly endear hi mself to the few
Stanford fans in attendance,
when he fumbled the ball at the
Penn State 50.
In just over six minutes the
Cards had fumbled three times.
Penn State, showing the mark
of a good football team, took ad
vantage of the Card miscue, driv
ing half the field in eight plays

for their second and final
touchdown of the afternoon.
Matt Suhey, who became the
second Penn State freshman to
rush for over 100 yards against
Stanford, slammed off the right
side for the score. And just like
that it was 15-0.
Cordova hot
Cordova, who completed his
first three passes of the afternoon
for 29 yards, finally got his act
together late in the first quarter.
A 15-yard Cordova pass to Kel
larset up the first of Michel's two
field goals. The Cards stalled at
the PSU 36 and the senior hoo
ter's 52-yard field goal with a
strong wind at his back was
good.
Cordova drove Stanford down
to the Penn State 13-yard line on
the Cards' first possession of the
second quarter, but Stanford had
to settle for another Michel field
goal.thisone from 27 yards out.
That closed the gap to 15-6.
It was up to the Stanford de
fense to come up with some big
plays and it did. With defensive
end Duncan McCall living up to
his pre-season publicity, the
Card defense was excellent.
The only real offense Stanford
could generate in the second half
was a 48-yard touchdown grab
by Tony Hill.
