# Harris, McCloskey in fiery debate
## 
### Mark Funk 
Mountain View— David Harris and Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., candidates for the 12th District congres
sional seat, opened a series of formal debates Saturday
night with a sharp exchange on nuclear energy.
At issue was the Nuclear Fuel Assurance Act of 1976,
which was passed by one vote in the House of Representa
tives. McCloskey, a Republican, voted in favor of the bill.
A crowd of about 600 in the Await High School au
ditorium heard Democrat Harris say he holds McCloskey
directly responsible for the bill's passage. The former
Stanford student body president who served a 20-month
prison sentence for resisting the draft added the act was
the embodiment "of corporate socialism."
The bill would provide government assistance for the
construction and maintenance of plants to enrich uranium
for eventual use in nuclear power plants. It would also
provide government guarantees to protect investments by
private industry.
Harris earlier had called the bill an "$8 billion rip-off"
and named the Bechtel Corp., a San Francisco-based pri
vate multi-national firm in the energy field, as one com
pany which would benefit by its passage.
Hot exchange
In the hottest exchange of the evening. McCloskey said
Harris was making an issue out of a part of the bill which
had been amended out before it was passed in the House of
Representatives.
Harris did not reply to McCloskey's charges.

The Democrat argued the federal government should
maintain strict controls over the uranium enrichment in
dustry.
McCloskey said that private industry should take on an
expanded role in nuclear research. He said he found gov
ernment "inherently incompetent" and said the bill
would protect the people from future energy shortages.
Harris counters
Harris countered that it was time to level off on energy
consumption rather than expand America's nuclear
energy capacity.
McCloskey concluded the debate by accusing Harris of
"demagoguery" on the question of nuclear energy and the
involvement of private enterprise in its development.
During the debate, American Independent Party candi
date Joseph Cooney staged a one-man protest at the gather
ing. He was piqued that he had not been included in the
confrontation between the Republican and Democratic
candidates.
Nuclear proliferation
Harris and McCloskey also discussed nuclear prolifera
tion and the role the United States should tak»> in selling it
to other nations.
After the debate, Harris'press secretary BobPak said the
candidates' positions on the Nuclear Fuel Assurance Bill
were at opposite ends of the spectrum.
"David and McCloskey are likn two shi ps passing in thr
night," he said. "They don't collide, they just sail on by
m/or tiiiif liitm out It i.tlmr "

sional seat, opened a series of formal debates Saturday
night with a sharp exchange on nuclear energy.
At issue was the Nuclear Fuel Assurance Act of 1976,
which was passed by one vote in the House of Representa
tives. McCloskey, a Republican, voted in favor of the bill.
A crowd of about 600 in the Await High School au
ditorium heard Democrat Harris say he holds McCloskey
directly responsible for the bill's passage. The former
Stanford student body president who served a 20-month
prison sentence for resisting the draft added the act was
the embodiment "of corporate socialism."
The bill would provide government assistance for the
construction and maintenance of plants to enrich uranium
for eventual use in nuclear power plants. It would also
provide government guarantees to protect investments by
private industry.
Harris earlier had called the bill an "$8 billion rip-off"
and named the Bechtel Corp., a San Francisco-based pri
vate multi-national firm in the energy field, as one com
pany which would benefit by its passage.
Hot exchange
In the hottest exchange of the evening. McCloskey said
Harris was making an issue out of a part of the bill which
had been amended out before it was passed in the House of
Representatives.
Harris did not reply to McCloskey's charges.

The Democrat argued the federal government should
maintain strict controls over the uranium enrichment in
dustry.
McCloskey said that private industry should take on an
expanded role in nuclear research. He said he found gov
ernment "inherently incompetent" and said the bill
would protect the people from future energy shortages.
Harris counters
Harris countered that it was time to level off on energy
consumption rather than expand America's nuclear
energy capacity.
McCloskey concluded the debate by accusing Harris of
"demagoguery" on the question of nuclear energy and the
involvement of private enterprise in its development.
During the debate, American Independent Party candi
date Joseph Cooney staged a one-man protest at the gather
ing. He was piqued that he had not been included in the
confrontation between the Republican and Democratic
candidates.
Nuclear proliferation
Harris and McCloskey also discussed nuclear prolifera
tion and the role the United States should tak»> in selling it
to other nations.
After the debate, Harris'press secretary BobPak said the
candidates' positions on the Nuclear Fuel Assurance Bill
were at opposite ends of the spectrum.
"David and McCloskey are likn two shi ps passing in thr
night," he said. "They don't collide, they just sail on by
m/or tiiiif liitm out It i.tlmr "
