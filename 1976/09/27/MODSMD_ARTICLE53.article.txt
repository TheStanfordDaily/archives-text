Tennis
Stanford sent five players to the United
States Open Tennis Championships at Forest
Hills, N.Y., the second most prestigious tennis
tournament in the world, early this month,
capping a summer in which Cardinal men and
women played independently around the
world.
Three of the five won their first round
matches before losing in the second.
Gene Mayer, who probably had the best
summer of any Stanford player, beat Paolo Ber
tolucci of Italy, a clay court specialist (Forest
Hills is now played on clay), 6-4, 6-1, in the
opening round. Mayer then faced Zaljko
Franulovic of Yugoslavia, ranked No. 50 in the
world, and lost, 6-3, 6-4.
Lele Forood, who has turned pro and there
fore will not be returning to Stanford, upset
Mareen Louie of San Francisco, 5-7, 7-5, 7-5,
before losing to Jackie Fayter of Great Britain.
Marcy O'Keefe, who played fourth singles
for the women's team last spring, upset Peggy
Michel, a member of World Team Tennis'
Pittsburgh Triangles, 6-1, 7-5, in the first
round. O'Keefe then lost to Lea Antonoplis 6-3,
6-4.
Matt Mitchell, No. 3 for the Stanford men last
season, drew the 1976 NCAA champion. Bill
Scanlon, in the first round and lost 6-2, 6-1.
Barbara Jordan played only doubles, with
USC's Barb Hallquist, and the team was elimi
nated in the first round.
The Stanford women began the summer by
finishing second in the National Women's In
tercollegiate Championships at Salt Lake City
in June. The Cards came up just one point short
of Trinity.
All four Stanford singles players in the tour
nament — Forood. Susie Hagey, O'Keefe and
Diane Morrison — plus Jordan, who played
only doubles, were named All-Americans in
the first year such status has been awarded
collegiate women.
Hagey and Morrison won the doubles title.
The Hagey-Morrison team continued to
make a name for itself over the summer, win
ning the Southern California Section sand
reaching the finals of the National Hardcourts
in Burlingameand the National Grass Courts in
Philadelphia.
Stanford women's coach Anne Hill said
Hagey and Forood didn't play much singles
this summer. Morrison, Jordan and O'Keefe
did, and performed pretty well.
Morrison consistently reached the round
of-16 and will be ranked among the top 16
collegians this year.
Jordan won a tournament in North Conway,
N.H.. beating pro LaurieTenney and Hallquist,
among others.
O'Keefe reached the finals of the Buffalo,
N Y. tournament, scoring wins over Hallquist
and Paula Smith, No. 1 for UCLA.
Hagey and Jordan were also selected to play
in foreign tournaments. The Sergio Tacchini
Corporation, which makes tennis wear, chose
Hagey to play in a European 21-and-under
tournament in Italy this month. Jordan gets to
go to Japan. The sophomore from King of Prus
sia, Pa. was one of six amateurs, four men and
two women, selected by the Yonex Company to
play in Japan this week against a Japanese na
tional team.
Speaking of Japan, Bill Maze, No. 2 for the
Stanford men last spring, just returned from
that country. Maze was a member of an NCAA
all-star team which played against the
Japanese.
Maze played with the Junior 21-and-under
Davis Cup Team all summer in the East. He
made the finals of the National Grass Court
Championships in Newport, R.I. and won the
National Amateur Clay Court doubles title
with Eric Friedler.
Mayer kicked off his summer with an ap
pearance at Wimbledon. The senior from New

WVVVVVV\/VVVVVVVVV«^VVVVVW"
Jersey lost in the first round to Russian Alex
Metreveli, retiring because of injury in the sec
ond set. Two weeks ago, Mayer lost to Cliff
Richey, ranked 40th in the world, in the finals
of the Bermuda tournament.
Matt Mitchell played the Northwest Circuit,
along with Card teammate Perry Wright, and
finished second overall to qualify directly for
Forest Hills. The Wright-Mitchell doubles
team was the circuit's best.
Jim Hodges, Stanford's top recruit for next
season, won the National Boys' Interscholastic
Championships in Durham, N.C. in June.
Waterpolo
Stanford's water polo team traveled to Rus
sia, West Germany and Holland during the
summer, compiling a record of four wins, three
losses and one tie against top national teams.
The team left Aug. 19 for its 18-day tour of
Moscow and Minsk, Russia, West Berlin and
Amsterdam, Holland.
The team was comprised of current members
of this year's squad and they were in top shape
for the foreign teams. The Cards placed second
at the AAU National Championships prior to
their journey.
Coach Art Lambert said that Stanford's
polois.ts performed well abroad.
"The Russians were about 30-35 years of age
and had players who were on their '68, '72 and
'76 Olympic teams. The Russians move their
people around — they have about four or five
national teams and their players play on more

than one. Sport is part of their political army."
Lambert said the Russian hospitality was
mediocre. "They showed a minimum which
they felt they could get away with."
In an interview with the Russian media,
Lambert was very open not only about his
thoughts on waterpolo, but also about an em
barrassing subject for the Russians — the
young diver who at that time was thought to
have defected during the Olympics.
Lambert had questions shot at him one after
another and became more or less trapped by the
interviewer. So, when Lambert was promised
that there would be "just one more" question,
he asked if he might first ask one. When the
reporter agreed, Lambert said, "What ever
happened to your diver?" End of interview.
The Cards also played in West Berlin against
the Berlin National Club Champions, who
boasted three Olympians from the 1976 team.
Following the meeting, some of the players
took a side trip to East Berlin.
"I didn't go," Lambert said nonchalantly.
"I've already been there twice. I can tell you
stories that will open a lot of eyes."
The Cards also traveled to Amsterdam,
where they beat the top Dutch club team. The
Dutchmen had three Olympians from their
1976 bronze inedal-winning squad.
Baseball
One would think that Stanford baseball
players would have had their fill of America's
grand old game after a marathon 65-game

schedule last spring. But the intercollegiate
schedule offered the Cardinals proved to be
merely a warmup for the nine Stanford
ballplayers who spent most of the summer
playing semi-pro ball.
Senior John Yandle and sophomore Larry
Reynolds helped the team from Fairbanks,
Alaska win the National Semi-Professional
Baseball championship in August.
Yandle pitched a 3-0 shutout in the semifinal
game at the nationals. The 6-foot-tall lefthan
der is currently playing with the United States
team that is touring Taiwan and South Korea.
Reynolds batted over .300 and stole more
than 30 bases while playing in the outfield for
the Alaskan team. Reynolds, who can be seen
sporting the cardinal and white at right cor
nerback for the football team, last year became
the first Stanford freshman to earn a varsity
letter in two major sports.
Catcher Bruce Walters also played in Alaska
this summer, working behind the plate for
the team from Kenai.
While Reynolds, Yandle and Walters were
up north in the arctic regions, Stanford coach
Mark Marquess and six Cardinals played their
summer ball in Colorado.
Tom Guardino, Gary Pitchford and Rob
Irwin played on a Boulder team which finished
third in the nationals. Marquess, an assistant
coach in Boulder, said that Guardino batted
over .350 and hit 13 home runs.
Mike Cordiroli, Todd Ervin and Mark Ab
bondola played down state in Pueblo. Cor

diroli reportedly hit over .300 and stole more
than 30 bases. Ervin, a transfer from Citrus
Junior College, will compete for the shortstop
spot vacated by the graduation of four-year let
terman Steve Davis.
Basketball
Stanford men's basketball coach Dick Di-
Biaso probably thought his worries about in
juries were over at the end of the Pacific-8
season last winter.
Wrong.
Senior guard Mike Bratz ran a power saw
through his right knee at work this summer
and, according to Dißiaso, "came within an
infinitesimal fraction of an inch of cutting
through the kneecap, ligaments and tendons."
As it was, only the skin was hit and, although
the cut required about two dozen stitches,
Bratz should be ready to play when practice
opens Oct. 15.
Dißiaso also announced in July the ap
pointment of Dottie McCrea, former women's
basketball coach at Rutgers University, to the
same position at Stanford. McCrea succeeds
Gay Coburn, who did not reapply for the posi
tion.
Golf
Stanford's men's golf team finished a disap
pointing 20th in the NCAA Championships at
Albuquerque,N.M. in June, but Mike Peck was
named a second team All-American.
Oklahoma State took the team title, followed
by Brigham Young.
In other summer golf action, Peck played in
the National Amateur Championships in Cin
cinnati, Ohio, losing in the second round.
Stanford's Glenn Goethals was a first alter
nate in that tournament, but did not play.
The women's golf team finished 12th in the
National Women's Collegiate Golf Champion
ships last June. The matches were held at
Michigan State.
Furman University won the team title with
1251 strokes, followed by Tulsa with 1252.
Stanford finished with 1327 strokes.
Sports notes
Debbie Meyer, three-time Olympic gold
medalist, has been appointed assistant swim
ming coach here. Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
made the announcement in June. . . The 23-
year old former Arden Hills Swim Club (Sac
ramento) coach will head coach Jim
Gaughran with both the men's and women's
teams. . . In the 1968 Olympic Games, Meyer
became the first swimmer — male or female —
to win three individual gold medals.
Stuart Corliss, a junior on the Stanford men's
swimming team, placed third behind two
Olympians in the 200-meter breaststroke at the
National AAU Meet in Philadelphia in Au
gust. . . "With John (Hencken) leaving (be
cause of graduation)," Card coach Jim Gaug
hran said, "it sort of leaves a hole in the breast
stroke, so Stu's performance is terrific."
Corliss' effort in the AAU's earned him a
chance to compete in Egypt and Greece earlier
this month. . . Freshman Valerie Lee also per
formed well enough in Philadelphia to travel
to Czechoslovakia. . . Anne Brodell finished
sixth in the 1500-freestyle at the AAU Nation
als.
Head baseball coach Ray Young, who last
season etched his name into the Card baseball
record books as the winningest baseball coach
in school history, has been named assistant
athletic director. . . Replacing Young will be
Mark Marquess, who has served as Young's
i assistant since 1969. . . Marquess was an All-
American first baseman for the Cards in
1968. . .

Tennis
Stanford sent five players to the United
States Open Tennis Championships at Forest
Hills, N.Y., the second most prestigious tennis
tournament in the world, early this month,
capping a summer in which Cardinal men and
women played independently around the
world.
Three of the five won their first round
matches before losing in the second.
Gene Mayer, who probably had the best
summer of any Stanford player, beat Paolo Ber
tolucci of Italy, a clay court specialist (Forest
Hills is now played on clay), 6-4, 6-1, in the
opening round. Mayer then faced Zaljko
Franulovic of Yugoslavia, ranked No. 50 in the
world, and lost, 6-3, 6-4.
Lele Forood, who has turned pro and there
fore will not be returning to Stanford, upset
Mareen Louie of San Francisco, 5-7, 7-5, 7-5,
before losing to Jackie Fayter of Great Britain.
Marcy O'Keefe, who played fourth singles
for the women's team last spring, upset Peggy
Michel, a member of World Team Tennis'
Pittsburgh Triangles, 6-1, 7-5, in the first
round. O'Keefe then lost to Lea Antonoplis 6-3,
6-4.
Matt Mitchell, No. 3 for the Stanford men last
season, drew the 1976 NCAA champion. Bill
Scanlon, in the first round and lost 6-2, 6-1.
Barbara Jordan played only doubles, with
USC's Barb Hallquist, and the team was elimi
nated in the first round.
The Stanford women began the summer by
finishing second in the National Women's In
tercollegiate Championships at Salt Lake City
in June. The Cards came up just one point short
of Trinity.
All four Stanford singles players in the tour
nament — Forood. Susie Hagey, O'Keefe and
Diane Morrison — plus Jordan, who played
only doubles, were named All-Americans in
the first year such status has been awarded
collegiate women.
Hagey and Morrison won the doubles title.
The Hagey-Morrison team continued to
make a name for itself over the summer, win
ning the Southern California Section sand
reaching the finals of the National Hardcourts
in Burlingameand the National Grass Courts in
Philadelphia.
Stanford women's coach Anne Hill said
Hagey and Forood didn't play much singles
this summer. Morrison, Jordan and O'Keefe
did, and performed pretty well.
Morrison consistently reached the round
of-16 and will be ranked among the top 16
collegians this year.
Jordan won a tournament in North Conway,
N.H.. beating pro LaurieTenney and Hallquist,
among others.
O'Keefe reached the finals of the Buffalo,
N Y. tournament, scoring wins over Hallquist
and Paula Smith, No. 1 for UCLA.
Hagey and Jordan were also selected to play
in foreign tournaments. The Sergio Tacchini
Corporation, which makes tennis wear, chose
Hagey to play in a European 21-and-under
tournament in Italy this month. Jordan gets to
go to Japan. The sophomore from King of Prus
sia, Pa. was one of six amateurs, four men and
two women, selected by the Yonex Company to
play in Japan this week against a Japanese na
tional team.
Speaking of Japan, Bill Maze, No. 2 for the
Stanford men last spring, just returned from
that country. Maze was a member of an NCAA
all-star team which played against the
Japanese.
Maze played with the Junior 21-and-under
Davis Cup Team all summer in the East. He
made the finals of the National Grass Court
Championships in Newport, R.I. and won the
National Amateur Clay Court doubles title
with Eric Friedler.
Mayer kicked off his summer with an ap
pearance at Wimbledon. The senior from New

WVVVVVV\/VVVVVVVVV«^VVVVVW"
Jersey lost in the first round to Russian Alex
Metreveli, retiring because of injury in the sec
ond set. Two weeks ago, Mayer lost to Cliff
Richey, ranked 40th in the world, in the finals
of the Bermuda tournament.
Matt Mitchell played the Northwest Circuit,
along with Card teammate Perry Wright, and
finished second overall to qualify directly for
Forest Hills. The Wright-Mitchell doubles
team was the circuit's best.
Jim Hodges, Stanford's top recruit for next
season, won the National Boys' Interscholastic
Championships in Durham, N.C. in June.
Waterpolo
Stanford's water polo team traveled to Rus
sia, West Germany and Holland during the
summer, compiling a record of four wins, three
losses and one tie against top national teams.
The team left Aug. 19 for its 18-day tour of
Moscow and Minsk, Russia, West Berlin and
Amsterdam, Holland.
The team was comprised of current members
of this year's squad and they were in top shape
for the foreign teams. The Cards placed second
at the AAU National Championships prior to
their journey.
Coach Art Lambert said that Stanford's
polois.ts performed well abroad.
"The Russians were about 30-35 years of age
and had players who were on their '68, '72 and
'76 Olympic teams. The Russians move their
people around — they have about four or five
national teams and their players play on more

than one. Sport is part of their political army."
Lambert said the Russian hospitality was
mediocre. "They showed a minimum which
they felt they could get away with."
In an interview with the Russian media,
Lambert was very open not only about his
thoughts on waterpolo, but also about an em
barrassing subject for the Russians — the
young diver who at that time was thought to
have defected during the Olympics.
Lambert had questions shot at him one after
another and became more or less trapped by the
interviewer. So, when Lambert was promised
that there would be "just one more" question,
he asked if he might first ask one. When the
reporter agreed, Lambert said, "What ever
happened to your diver?" End of interview.
The Cards also played in West Berlin against
the Berlin National Club Champions, who
boasted three Olympians from the 1976 team.
Following the meeting, some of the players
took a side trip to East Berlin.
"I didn't go," Lambert said nonchalantly.
"I've already been there twice. I can tell you
stories that will open a lot of eyes."
The Cards also traveled to Amsterdam,
where they beat the top Dutch club team. The
Dutchmen had three Olympians from their
1976 bronze inedal-winning squad.
Baseball
One would think that Stanford baseball
players would have had their fill of America's
grand old game after a marathon 65-game

schedule last spring. But the intercollegiate
schedule offered the Cardinals proved to be
merely a warmup for the nine Stanford
ballplayers who spent most of the summer
playing semi-pro ball.
Senior John Yandle and sophomore Larry
Reynolds helped the team from Fairbanks,
Alaska win the National Semi-Professional
Baseball championship in August.
Yandle pitched a 3-0 shutout in the semifinal
game at the nationals. The 6-foot-tall lefthan
der is currently playing with the United States
team that is touring Taiwan and South Korea.
Reynolds batted over .300 and stole more
than 30 bases while playing in the outfield for
the Alaskan team. Reynolds, who can be seen
sporting the cardinal and white at right cor
nerback for the football team, last year became
the first Stanford freshman to earn a varsity
letter in two major sports.
Catcher Bruce Walters also played in Alaska
this summer, working behind the plate for
the team from Kenai.
While Reynolds, Yandle and Walters were
up north in the arctic regions, Stanford coach
Mark Marquess and six Cardinals played their
summer ball in Colorado.
Tom Guardino, Gary Pitchford and Rob
Irwin played on a Boulder team which finished
third in the nationals. Marquess, an assistant
coach in Boulder, said that Guardino batted
over .350 and hit 13 home runs.
Mike Cordiroli, Todd Ervin and Mark Ab
bondola played down state in Pueblo. Cor

diroli reportedly hit over .300 and stole more
than 30 bases. Ervin, a transfer from Citrus
Junior College, will compete for the shortstop
spot vacated by the graduation of four-year let
terman Steve Davis.
Basketball
Stanford men's basketball coach Dick Di-
Biaso probably thought his worries about in
juries were over at the end of the Pacific-8
season last winter.
Wrong.
Senior guard Mike Bratz ran a power saw
through his right knee at work this summer
and, according to Dißiaso, "came within an
infinitesimal fraction of an inch of cutting
through the kneecap, ligaments and tendons."
As it was, only the skin was hit and, although
the cut required about two dozen stitches,
Bratz should be ready to play when practice

barrassing subject for the Russians — the
young diver who at that time was thought to
have defected during the Olympics.
Lambert had questions shot at him one after
another and became more or less trapped by the
interviewer. So, when Lambert was promised
that there would be "just one more" question,
he asked if he might first ask one. When the
reporter agreed, Lambert said, "What ever
happened to your diver?" End of interview.
The Cards also played in West Berlin against
the Berlin National Club Champions, who
boasted three Olympians from the 1976 team.
Following the meeting, some of the players
took a side trip to East Berlin.
"I didn't go," Lambert said nonchalantly.
"I've already been there twice. I can tell you
stories that will open a lot of eyes."
The Cards also traveled to Amsterdam,
where they beat the top Dutch club team. The
Dutchmen had three Olympians from their
1976 bronze inedal-winning squad.
Baseball
One would think that Stanford baseball
players would have had their fill of America's
grand old game after a marathon 65-game

schedule last spring. But the intercollegiate
schedule offered the Cardinals proved to be
merely a warmup for the nine Stanford
ballplayers who spent most of the summer
playing semi-pro ball.
Senior John Yandle and sophomore Larry
Reynolds helped the team from Fairbanks,
Alaska win the National Semi-Professional
Baseball championship in August.
Yandle pitched a 3-0 shutout in the semifinal
game at the nationals. The 6-foot-tall lefthan
der is currently playing with the United States
team that is touring Taiwan and South Korea.
Reynolds batted over .300 and stole more
than 30 bases while playing in the outfield for
the Alaskan team. Reynolds, who can be seen
sporting the cardinal and white at right cor
nerback for the football team, last year became
the first Stanford freshman to earn a varsity
letter in two major sports.
Catcher Bruce Walters also played in Alaska
this summer, working behind the plate for
the team from Kenai.
While Reynolds, Yandle and Walters were
up north in the arctic regions, Stanford coach
Mark Marquess and six Cardinals played their
summer ball in Colorado.
Tom Guardino, Gary Pitchford and Rob
Irwin played on a Boulder team which finished
third in the nationals. Marquess, an assistant
coach in Boulder, said that Guardino batted
over .350 and hit 13 home runs.
Mike Cordiroli, Todd Ervin and Mark Ab
bondola played down state in Pueblo. Cor

diroli reportedly hit over .300 and stole more
than 30 bases. Ervin, a transfer from Citrus
Junior College, will compete for the shortstop
spot vacated by the graduation of four-year let
terman Steve Davis.
Basketball
Stanford men's basketball coach Dick Di-
Biaso probably thought his worries about in
juries were over at the end of the Pacific-8
season last winter.
Wrong.
Senior guard Mike Bratz ran a power saw
through his right knee at work this summer
and, according to Dißiaso, "came within an
infinitesimal fraction of an inch of cutting
through the kneecap, ligaments and tendons."
As it was, only the skin was hit and, although
the cut required about two dozen stitches,
Bratz should be ready to play when practice
opens Oct. 15.
Dißiaso also announced in July the ap
pointment of Dottie McCrea, former women's
basketball coach at Rutgers University, to the
same position at Stanford. McCrea succeeds
Gay Coburn, who did not reapply for the posi
tion.
Golf
Stanford's men's golf team finished a disap
pointing 20th in the NCAA Championships at
Albuquerque,N.M. in June, but Mike Peck was
named a second team All-American.
Oklahoma State took the team title, followed
by Brigham Young.
In other summer golf action, Peck played in
the National Amateur Championships in Cin
cinnati, Ohio, losing in the second round.
Stanford's Glenn Goethals was a first alter
nate in that tournament, but did not play.
The women's golf team finished 12th in the
National Women's Collegiate Golf Champion
ships last June. The matches were held at
Michigan State.
Furman University won the team title with
1251 strokes, followed by Tulsa with 1252.
Stanford finished with 1327 strokes.
Sports notes
Debbie Meyer, three-time Olympic gold
medalist, has been appointed assistant swim
ming coach here. Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
made the announcement in June. . . The 23-
year old former Arden Hills Swim Club (Sac
ramento) coach will head coach Jim
Gaughran with both the men's and women's
teams. . . In the 1968 Olympic Games, Meyer
became the first swimmer — male or female —
to win three individual gold medals.
Stuart Corliss, a junior on the Stanford men's
swimming team, placed third behind two
Olympians in the 200-meter breaststroke at the
National AAU Meet in Philadelphia in Au
gust. . . "With John (Hencken) leaving (be
cause of graduation)," Card coach Jim Gaug
hran said, "it sort of leaves a hole in the breast
stroke, so Stu's performance is terrific."
Corliss' effort in the AAU's earned him a
chance to compete in Egypt and Greece earlier
this month. . . Freshman Valerie Lee also per
formed well enough in Philadelphia to travel
to Czechoslovakia. . . Anne Brodell finished
sixth in the 1500-freestyle at the AAU Nation
als.
Head baseball coach Ray Young, who last
season etched his name into the Card baseball
record books as the winningest baseball coach
in school history, has been named assistant
athletic director. . . Replacing Young will be
Mark Marquess, who has served as Young's

tournament in the world, early this month,
capping a summer in which Cardinal men and
women played independently around the
world.
Three of the five won their first round
matches before losing in the second.
Gene Mayer, who probably had the best
summer of any Stanford player, beat Paolo Ber
tolucci of Italy, a clay court specialist (Forest

USC's Barb Hallquist, and the team was elimi
nated in the first round.
The Stanford women began the summer by
finishing second in the National Women's In
tercollegiate Championships at Salt Lake City
in June. The Cards came up just one point short
of Trinity.
All four Stanford singles players in the tour
nament — Forood. Susie Hagey, O'Keefe and
Diane Morrison — plus Jordan, who played
only doubles, were named All-Americans in
the first year such status has been awarded
collegiate women.
Hagey and Morrison won the doubles title.
The Hagey-Morrison team continued to
make a name for itself over the summer, win
ning the Southern California Section sand
reaching the finals of the National Hardcourts
in Burlingameand the National Grass Courts in
Philadelphia.
Stanford women's coach Anne Hill said
Hagey and Forood didn't play much singles
this summer. Morrison, Jordan and O'Keefe
did, and performed pretty well.
Morrison consistently reached the round
of-16 and will be ranked among the top 16
collegians this year.
Jordan won a tournament in North Conway,
N.H.. beating pro LaurieTenney and Hallquist,
among others.
O'Keefe reached the finals of the Buffalo,
N Y. tournament, scoring wins over Hallquist
and Paula Smith, No. 1 for UCLA.
Hagey and Jordan were also selected to play
in foreign tournaments. The Sergio Tacchini
Corporation, which makes tennis wear, chose
Hagey to play in a European 21-and-under
tournament in Italy this month. Jordan gets to
go to Japan. The sophomore from King of Prus
sia, Pa. was one of six amateurs, four men and
two women, selected by the Yonex Company to
play in Japan this week against a Japanese na
tional team.
Speaking of Japan, Bill Maze, No. 2 for the
Stanford men last spring, just returned from
that country. Maze was a member of an NCAA
all-star team which played against the
Japanese.
Maze played with the Junior 21-and-under
Davis Cup Team all summer in the East. He
made the finals of the National Grass Court
Championships in Newport, R.I. and won the
National Amateur Clay Court doubles title
with Eric Friedler.
Mayer kicked off his summer with an ap
pearance at Wimbledon. The senior from New

WVVVVVV\/VVVVVVVVV«^VVVVVW"
Jersey lost in the first round to Russian Alex
Metreveli, retiring because of injury in the sec
ond set. Two weeks ago, Mayer lost to Cliff
Richey, ranked 40th in the world, in the finals
of the Bermuda tournament.
Matt Mitchell played the Northwest Circuit,
along with Card teammate Perry Wright, and
finished second overall to qualify directly for
Forest Hills. The Wright-Mitchell doubles
team was the circuit's best.
Jim Hodges, Stanford's top recruit for next
season, won the National Boys' Interscholastic
Championships in Durham, N.C. in June.
Waterpolo
Stanford's water polo team traveled to Rus
sia, West Germany and Holland during the
summer, compiling a record of four wins, three
losses and one tie against top national teams.
The team left Aug. 19 for its 18-day tour of
Moscow and Minsk, Russia, West Berlin and
Amsterdam, Holland.
The team was comprised of current members
of this year's squad and they were in top shape
for the foreign teams. The Cards placed second
at the AAU National Championships prior to
their journey.
Coach Art Lambert said that Stanford's
polois.ts performed well abroad.
"The Russians were about 30-35 years of age
and had players who were on their '68, '72 and
'76 Olympic teams. The Russians move their
people around — they have about four or five
national teams and their players play on more

than one. Sport is part of their political army."
Lambert said the Russian hospitality was
mediocre. "They showed a minimum which
they felt they could get away with."
In an interview with the Russian media,
Lambert was very open not only about his
thoughts on waterpolo, but also about an em
barrassing subject for the Russians — the
young diver who at that time was thought to
have defected during the Olympics.
Lambert had questions shot at him one after

collegians this year.
Jordan won a tournament in North Conway,
N.H.. beating pro LaurieTenney and Hallquist,
among others.
O'Keefe reached the finals of the Buffalo,
N Y. tournament, scoring wins over Hallquist
and Paula Smith, No. 1 for UCLA.
Hagey and Jordan were also selected to play
in foreign tournaments. The Sergio Tacchini
Corporation, which makes tennis wear, chose
Hagey to play in a European 21-and-under
tournament in Italy this month. Jordan gets to
go to Japan. The sophomore from King of Prus
sia, Pa. was one of six amateurs, four men and
two women, selected by the Yonex Company to
play in Japan this week against a Japanese na
tional team.
Speaking of Japan, Bill Maze, No. 2 for the
Stanford men last spring, just returned from
that country. Maze was a member of an NCAA
all-star team which played against the
Japanese.
Maze played with the Junior 21-and-under
Davis Cup Team all summer in the East. He
made the finals of the National Grass Court
Championships in Newport, R.I. and won the
National Amateur Clay Court doubles title
with Eric Friedler.
Mayer kicked off his summer with an ap
pearance at Wimbledon. The senior from New

WVVVVVV\/VVVVVVVVV«^VVVVVW"
Jersey lost in the first round to Russian Alex
Metreveli, retiring because of injury in the sec
ond set. Two weeks ago, Mayer lost to Cliff
Richey, ranked 40th in the world, in the finals
of the Bermuda tournament.
Matt Mitchell played the Northwest Circuit,
along with Card teammate Perry Wright, and
finished second overall to qualify directly for
Forest Hills. The Wright-Mitchell doubles
team was the circuit's best.
Jim Hodges, Stanford's top recruit for next
season, won the National Boys' Interscholastic
Championships in Durham, N.C. in June.
Waterpolo
Stanford's water polo team traveled to Rus
sia, West Germany and Holland during the
summer, compiling a record of four wins, three
losses and one tie against top national teams.
The team left Aug. 19 for its 18-day tour of
Moscow and Minsk, Russia, West Berlin and
Amsterdam, Holland.
The team was comprised of current members
of this year's squad and they were in top shape
for the foreign teams. The Cards placed second
at the AAU National Championships prior to
their journey.
Coach Art Lambert said that Stanford's
polois.ts performed well abroad.
"The Russians were about 30-35 years of age
and had players who were on their '68, '72 and
'76 Olympic teams. The Russians move their
people around — they have about four or five
national teams and their players play on more

than one. Sport is part of their political army."
Lambert said the Russian hospitality was
mediocre. "They showed a minimum which
they felt they could get away with."
In an interview with the Russian media,
Lambert was very open not only about his
thoughts on waterpolo, but also about an em
barrassing subject for the Russians — the
young diver who at that time was thought to
have defected during the Olympics.
Lambert had questions shot at him one after
another and became more or less trapped by the
interviewer. So, when Lambert was promised
that there would be "just one more" question,
he asked if he might first ask one. When the
reporter agreed, Lambert said, "What ever
happened to your diver?" End of interview.
The Cards also played in West Berlin against
the Berlin National Club Champions, who
boasted three Olympians from the 1976 team.
Following the meeting, some of the players
took a side trip to East Berlin.
"I didn't go," Lambert said nonchalantly.
"I've already been there twice. I can tell you
stories that will open a lot of eyes."
The Cards also traveled to Amsterdam,
where they beat the top Dutch club team. The
Dutchmen had three Olympians from their
1976 bronze inedal-winning squad.
Baseball
One would think that Stanford baseball
players would have had their fill of America's
grand old game after a marathon 65-game

schedule last spring. But the intercollegiate
schedule offered the Cardinals proved to be
merely a warmup for the nine Stanford
ballplayers who spent most of the summer
playing semi-pro ball.
Senior John Yandle and sophomore Larry
Reynolds helped the team from Fairbanks,
Alaska win the National Semi-Professional
Baseball championship in August.
Yandle pitched a 3-0 shutout in the semifinal
game at the nationals. The 6-foot-tall lefthan
der is currently playing with the United States
team that is touring Taiwan and South Korea.
Reynolds batted over .300 and stole more
than 30 bases while playing in the outfield for
the Alaskan team. Reynolds, who can be seen
sporting the cardinal and white at right cor
nerback for the football team, last year became
the first Stanford freshman to earn a varsity
letter in two major sports.
Catcher Bruce Walters also played in Alaska
this summer, working behind the plate for
the team from Kenai.
While Reynolds, Yandle and Walters were
up north in the arctic regions, Stanford coach
Mark Marquess and six Cardinals played their
summer ball in Colorado.
Tom Guardino, Gary Pitchford and Rob
Irwin played on a Boulder team which finished
third in the nationals. Marquess, an assistant
coach in Boulder, said that Guardino batted
over .350 and hit 13 home runs.
Mike Cordiroli, Todd Ervin and Mark Ab
bondola played down state in Pueblo. Cor

diroli reportedly hit over .300 and stole more
than 30 bases. Ervin, a transfer from Citrus
Junior College, will compete for the shortstop
spot vacated by the graduation of four-year let
terman Steve Davis.
Basketball
Stanford men's basketball coach Dick Di-
Biaso probably thought his worries about in
juries were over at the end of the Pacific-8
season last winter.
Wrong.
Senior guard Mike Bratz ran a power saw
through his right knee at work this summer
and, according to Dißiaso, "came within an
infinitesimal fraction of an inch of cutting
through the kneecap, ligaments and tendons."
As it was, only the skin was hit and, although
the cut required about two dozen stitches,
Bratz should be ready to play when practice
opens Oct. 15.
Dißiaso also announced in July the ap
pointment of Dottie McCrea, former women's
basketball coach at Rutgers University, to the
same position at Stanford. McCrea succeeds
Gay Coburn, who did not reapply for the posi
tion.
Golf
Stanford's men's golf team finished a disap
pointing 20th in the NCAA Championships at
Albuquerque,N.M. in June, but Mike Peck was
named a second team All-American.
Oklahoma State took the team title, followed
by Brigham Young.
In other summer golf action, Peck played in
the National Amateur Championships in Cin
cinnati, Ohio, losing in the second round.
Stanford's Glenn Goethals was a first alter
nate in that tournament, but did not play.
The women's golf team finished 12th in the
National Women's Collegiate Golf Champion
ships last June. The matches were held at
Michigan State.
Furman University won the team title with
1251 strokes, followed by Tulsa with 1252.
Stanford finished with 1327 strokes.
Sports notes
Debbie Meyer, three-time Olympic gold
medalist, has been appointed assistant swim
ming coach here. Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
made the announcement in June. . . The 23-
year old former Arden Hills Swim Club (Sac
ramento) coach will head coach Jim
Gaughran with both the men's and women's
teams. . . In the 1968 Olympic Games, Meyer
became the first swimmer — male or female —
to win three individual gold medals.
Stuart Corliss, a junior on the Stanford men's
swimming team, placed third behind two
Olympians in the 200-meter breaststroke at the
National AAU Meet in Philadelphia in Au
gust. . . "With John (Hencken) leaving (be
cause of graduation)," Card coach Jim Gaug
hran said, "it sort of leaves a hole in the breast
stroke, so Stu's performance is terrific."
Corliss' effort in the AAU's earned him a
chance to compete in Egypt and Greece earlier
this month. . . Freshman Valerie Lee also per
formed well enough in Philadelphia to travel
to Czechoslovakia. . . Anne Brodell finished
sixth in the 1500-freestyle at the AAU Nation
als.
Head baseball coach Ray Young, who last
season etched his name into the Card baseball
record books as the winningest baseball coach
in school history, has been named assistant
athletic director. . . Replacing Young will be
Mark Marquess, who has served as Young's
i assistant since 1969. . . Marquess was an All-
American first baseman for the Cards in
1968. . .

tournament in the world, early this month,
capping a summer in which Cardinal men and
women played independently around the
world.
Three of the five won their first round
matches before losing in the second.
Gene Mayer, who probably had the best
summer of any Stanford player, beat Paolo Ber
tolucci of Italy, a clay court specialist (Forest
Hills is now played on clay), 6-4, 6-1, in the
opening round. Mayer then faced Zaljko
Franulovic of Yugoslavia, ranked No. 50 in the

USC's Barb Hallquist, and the team was elimi
nated in the first round.
The Stanford women began the summer by
finishing second in the National Women's In
tercollegiate Championships at Salt Lake City
in June. The Cards came up just one point short
of Trinity.
All four Stanford singles players in the tour
nament — Forood. Susie Hagey, O'Keefe and
Diane Morrison — plus Jordan, who played
only doubles, were named All-Americans in
the first year such status has been awarded
collegiate women.
Hagey and Morrison won the doubles title.
The Hagey-Morrison team continued to
make a name for itself over the summer, win
ning the Southern California Section sand
reaching the finals of the National Hardcourts
in Burlingameand the National Grass Courts in
Philadelphia.
Stanford women's coach Anne Hill said
Hagey and Forood didn't play much singles
this summer. Morrison, Jordan and O'Keefe
did, and performed pretty well.
Morrison consistently reached the round
of-16 and will be ranked among the top 16
collegians this year.
Jordan won a tournament in North Conway,
N.H.. beating pro LaurieTenney and Hallquist,
among others.

Tennis
Stanford sent five players to the United
States Open Tennis Championships at Forest
Hills, N.Y., the second most prestigious tennis
tournament in the world, early this month,
capping a summer in which Cardinal men and
women played independently around the
world.
Three of the five won their first round
matches before losing in the second.
Gene Mayer, who probably had the best
summer of any Stanford player, beat Paolo Ber
tolucci of Italy, a clay court specialist (Forest
Hills is now played on clay), 6-4, 6-1, in the
opening round. Mayer then faced Zaljko
Franulovic of Yugoslavia, ranked No. 50 in the
world, and lost, 6-3, 6-4.
Lele Forood, who has turned pro and there
fore will not be returning to Stanford, upset
Mareen Louie of San Francisco, 5-7, 7-5, 7-5,
before losing to Jackie Fayter of Great Britain.
Marcy O'Keefe, who played fourth singles
for the women's team last spring, upset Peggy
Michel, a member of World Team Tennis'
Pittsburgh Triangles, 6-1, 7-5, in the first
round. O'Keefe then lost to Lea Antonoplis 6-3,
6-4.
Matt Mitchell, No. 3 for the Stanford men last
season, drew the 1976 NCAA champion. Bill
Scanlon, in the first round and lost 6-2, 6-1.
Barbara Jordan played only doubles, with
USC's Barb Hallquist, and the team was elimi
nated in the first round.
The Stanford women began the summer by
finishing second in the National Women's In
tercollegiate Championships at Salt Lake City
in June. The Cards came up just one point short
of Trinity.
All four Stanford singles players in the tour
nament — Forood. Susie Hagey, O'Keefe and
Diane Morrison — plus Jordan, who played
only doubles, were named All-Americans in
the first year such status has been awarded
collegiate women.
Hagey and Morrison won the doubles title.
The Hagey-Morrison team continued to
make a name for itself over the summer, win
ning the Southern California Section sand
reaching the finals of the National Hardcourts
in Burlingameand the National Grass Courts in
Philadelphia.
Stanford women's coach Anne Hill said
Hagey and Forood didn't play much singles
this summer. Morrison, Jordan and O'Keefe
did, and performed pretty well.
Morrison consistently reached the round
of-16 and will be ranked among the top 16
collegians this year.
Jordan won a tournament in North Conway,
N.H.. beating pro LaurieTenney and Hallquist,
among others.
O'Keefe reached the finals of the Buffalo,
N Y. tournament, scoring wins over Hallquist
and Paula Smith, No. 1 for UCLA.
Hagey and Jordan were also selected to play
in foreign tournaments. The Sergio Tacchini
Corporation, which makes tennis wear, chose
Hagey to play in a European 21-and-under
tournament in Italy this month. Jordan gets to
go to Japan. The sophomore from King of Prus
sia, Pa. was one of six amateurs, four men and
two women, selected by the Yonex Company to
play in Japan this week against a Japanese na
tional team.
Speaking of Japan, Bill Maze, No. 2 for the
Stanford men last spring, just returned from
that country. Maze was a member of an NCAA
all-star team which played against the
Japanese.
Maze played with the Junior 21-and-under
Davis Cup Team all summer in the East. He
made the finals of the National Grass Court
Championships in Newport, R.I. and won the
National Amateur Clay Court doubles title
with Eric Friedler.
Mayer kicked off his summer with an ap
pearance at Wimbledon. The senior from New

WVVVVVV\/VVVVVVVVV«^VVVVVW"
Jersey lost in the first round to Russian Alex
Metreveli, retiring because of injury in the sec
ond set. Two weeks ago, Mayer lost to Cliff
Richey, ranked 40th in the world, in the finals
of the Bermuda tournament.
Matt Mitchell played the Northwest Circuit,
along with Card teammate Perry Wright, and
finished second overall to qualify directly for
Forest Hills. The Wright-Mitchell doubles
team was the circuit's best.
Jim Hodges, Stanford's top recruit for next
season, won the National Boys' Interscholastic
Championships in Durham, N.C. in June.
Waterpolo
Stanford's water polo team traveled to Rus
sia, West Germany and Holland during the
summer, compiling a record of four wins, three
losses and one tie against top national teams.
The team left Aug. 19 for its 18-day tour of
Moscow and Minsk, Russia, West Berlin and
Amsterdam, Holland.
The team was comprised of current members
of this year's squad and they were in top shape
for the foreign teams. The Cards placed second
at the AAU National Championships prior to
their journey.
Coach Art Lambert said that Stanford's
polois.ts performed well abroad.
"The Russians were about 30-35 years of age
and had players who were on their '68, '72 and
'76 Olympic teams. The Russians move their
people around — they have about four or five
national teams and their players play on more

than one. Sport is part of their political army."
Lambert said the Russian hospitality was
mediocre. "They showed a minimum which
they felt they could get away with."
In an interview with the Russian media,
Lambert was very open not only about his
thoughts on waterpolo, but also about an em
barrassing subject for the Russians — the
young diver who at that time was thought to
have defected during the Olympics.
Lambert had questions shot at him one after
another and became more or less trapped by the
interviewer. So, when Lambert was promised
that there would be "just one more" question,
he asked if he might first ask one. When the
reporter agreed, Lambert said, "What ever
happened to your diver?" End of interview.
The Cards also played in West Berlin against
the Berlin National Club Champions, who
boasted three Olympians from the 1976 team.
Following the meeting, some of the players
took a side trip to East Berlin.
"I didn't go," Lambert said nonchalantly.
"I've already been there twice. I can tell you
stories that will open a lot of eyes."
The Cards also traveled to Amsterdam,
where they beat the top Dutch club team. The
Dutchmen had three Olympians from their
1976 bronze inedal-winning squad.
Baseball
One would think that Stanford baseball
players would have had their fill of America's
grand old game after a marathon 65-game

schedule last spring. But the intercollegiate
schedule offered the Cardinals proved to be
merely a warmup for the nine Stanford
ballplayers who spent most of the summer
playing semi-pro ball.
Senior John Yandle and sophomore Larry
Reynolds helped the team from Fairbanks,
Alaska win the National Semi-Professional
Baseball championship in August.
Yandle pitched a 3-0 shutout in the semifinal
game at the nationals. The 6-foot-tall lefthan
der is currently playing with the United States
team that is touring Taiwan and South Korea.
Reynolds batted over .300 and stole more
than 30 bases while playing in the outfield for
the Alaskan team. Reynolds, who can be seen
sporting the cardinal and white at right cor
nerback for the football team, last year became
the first Stanford freshman to earn a varsity
letter in two major sports.
Catcher Bruce Walters also played in Alaska
this summer, working behind the plate for
the team from Kenai.
While Reynolds, Yandle and Walters were
up north in the arctic regions, Stanford coach
Mark Marquess and six Cardinals played their
summer ball in Colorado.
Tom Guardino, Gary Pitchford and Rob
Irwin played on a Boulder team which finished
third in the nationals. Marquess, an assistant
coach in Boulder, said that Guardino batted
over .350 and hit 13 home runs.
Mike Cordiroli, Todd Ervin and Mark Ab
bondola played down state in Pueblo. Cor

diroli reportedly hit over .300 and stole more
than 30 bases. Ervin, a transfer from Citrus
Junior College, will compete for the shortstop
spot vacated by the graduation of four-year let
terman Steve Davis.
Basketball
Stanford men's basketball coach Dick Di-
Biaso probably thought his worries about in
juries were over at the end of the Pacific-8
season last winter.
Wrong.
Senior guard Mike Bratz ran a power saw
through his right knee at work this summer
and, according to Dißiaso, "came within an
infinitesimal fraction of an inch of cutting
through the kneecap, ligaments and tendons."
As it was, only the skin was hit and, although
the cut required about two dozen stitches,
Bratz should be ready to play when practice
opens Oct. 15.
Dißiaso also announced in July the ap
pointment of Dottie McCrea, former women's
basketball coach at Rutgers University, to the
same position at Stanford. McCrea succeeds
Gay Coburn, who did not reapply for the posi
tion.
Golf
Stanford's men's golf team finished a disap
pointing 20th in the NCAA Championships at
Albuquerque,N.M. in June, but Mike Peck was
named a second team All-American.
Oklahoma State took the team title, followed
by Brigham Young.
In other summer golf action, Peck played in
the National Amateur Championships in Cin
cinnati, Ohio, losing in the second round.
Stanford's Glenn Goethals was a first alter
nate in that tournament, but did not play.
The women's golf team finished 12th in the
National Women's Collegiate Golf Champion
ships last June. The matches were held at
Michigan State.
Furman University won the team title with
1251 strokes, followed by Tulsa with 1252.
Stanford finished with 1327 strokes.
Sports notes
Debbie Meyer, three-time Olympic gold
medalist, has been appointed assistant swim
ming coach here. Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
made the announcement in June. . . The 23-
year old former Arden Hills Swim Club (Sac
ramento) coach will head coach Jim
Gaughran with both the men's and women's
teams. . . In the 1968 Olympic Games, Meyer
became the first swimmer — male or female —
to win three individual gold medals.
Stuart Corliss, a junior on the Stanford men's
swimming team, placed third behind two
Olympians in the 200-meter breaststroke at the
National AAU Meet in Philadelphia in Au
gust. . . "With John (Hencken) leaving (be
cause of graduation)," Card coach Jim Gaug
hran said, "it sort of leaves a hole in the breast
stroke, so Stu's performance is terrific."
Corliss' effort in the AAU's earned him a
chance to compete in Egypt and Greece earlier
this month. . . Freshman Valerie Lee also per
formed well enough in Philadelphia to travel
to Czechoslovakia. . . Anne Brodell finished
sixth in the 1500-freestyle at the AAU Nation
als.
Head baseball coach Ray Young, who last
season etched his name into the Card baseball
record books as the winningest baseball coach
