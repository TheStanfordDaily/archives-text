# Cards Hencken, Bruner, Peyton win gold medals
## 
### Jeff Parietti 
Swimmers John Hencken, Mike Bruner
and Kim Peyton led a contingent of present
and past Stanford athletes who participated
in the 1976 Summer Olympic Games at
Montreal.
The trio garnered a total of five gold med
als and one silver, the second highest total
accumulated by any American university
(see table).
Bruner began the collection by becoming
the first U.S. gold medalist of the Summer
Games, winning the 200-meter butterfly in
world record time and leading an American
sweep of the event.
Bruner, who took a year off from school to
train for the Olympics, said of his victory:
"the satisfaction is indescribable."
The Stockton native later picked up a sec
ond gold by swimming the first leg on the
victorious U.S. 800-meter relay team, which
also set a world record.
Hencken, a senior from Santa Clara, col

lected golds in the 100-meter breaststroke
and in the 400-medley relay, and added a
silver medal in the 200-breast.
Winner of a gold and a silver in the 1972
Games at Munich, Hencken said he plans to
go for an unprecedented achievement for an
American swimmer, winning gold medals
in three different Olympics.
Peyton led off the U.S. women's 400-
freestyle relay squad, which came up with a
gold by edging a foursome from East Ger
many.

For Peyton, an incoming freshman from
Portland, Ore., winning a gold medal fulfil
led a goal she had set in elementary school.
"I always thought I would do it, and it be
came a reality," she said.
Paul Hartloff, another incoming
freshman, finished seventh in the finals of
the 1500-meter freestyle with a clocking of
15:32.08.
Stanford actually had athletes swimming
for three different Olympic teams in
Montreal, including its American contin
gent. Still another incoming freshman, Judy
Hudson, swam for Australia in three events.
Bill Chao was on the Taiwanese team, but
the well-publicized boycott prevented him
from competing.
"I'm absolutely delighted," said Stanford
swimming coach Jim Gaughran, when
asked about his swimmers' performances in
Montreal. "I especially felt great for Mike
(Bruner), because he took a year off and put
a lot on the line to make the Olympics."
In track, graduates Don Kardong and

Duncan Macdonald made the U.S. squad in
the marathon and the 5000 meter run, re
spectively.
Kardong, who holds Stanford track re
cords in the three and six mile runs,
finished fourth in the marathon in
2:11.15.8, only 3.2 seconds from a bronze
medal.
Macdonald, the school record holder in
the mile and now a medical student at the
University of Hawaii, placed seventh in a
qualifying heat and failed to reach the fi
nals. Macdonald later set an American re
cord in the 5000 meters while running a
meet in Europe. He bettered Steve Prefon
taine's former mark by three seconds.
Junior Keith McCormick, a transfer from
Penn State, was a member of the U.S. pen
tathlon team which failed to medal.
In addition, Stanford's head athletic
trainer Dave Blanchard was a member of the
U.S. Olympic training staff for the second
consecutive Summer Games.
