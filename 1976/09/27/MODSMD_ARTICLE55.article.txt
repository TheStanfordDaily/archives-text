# 'Massive rebuilding program'
## Washington hurt by graduation 
### Paul Bauman 
Daily sports editors Chris Baker and
Paul Bauman visited each of the Pacific
Eight schools at the end of the summer
and previewed their football teams for a
series of articles in the Daily. Actually,
the sports editors made it to every univer
sity except Washington State. Tough
break. But in fairness to the Cougars and
to the Pac-8, they did talk to coach Jackie
Sherrill, and Washington State will be
previewed in the Daily Wednesday. To
day: Washington.

SEATTLE, Wn.—It's only fitting that
clouds will be hovering over Husky
Stadium in Seattle most of the fall. The
picture for Head Football Coach Don
James and the 1976 Washington Huskies
is gloomy. Even dismal.
For beginners, 31 lettermen have
graduated off a team that came within six
points of going to the Rose Bowl. That's
almost twice as many players as any other
Pacific-8 team lost.
James is left with what he calls "a mas
sive rebuilding program." The problem is
especially critical on defense, where only
two of eleven starters return. James is
hurting for replacements.
Washington opened the season with
three defensive starters who had never
before played a down of college football, a
comerback who had never played in the
secondary before and a junior college
transfer. Behind these starters is little
more than a bunch of high school letter
men.
Washington led the Pac-8 in pass de
fense last year, but all four starting defen
sive backs have graduated. James de
scribes the new secondary as "short, light

and inexperienced."
Washington's troubles have been mul
tiplied by what it could least afford —
injuries. Every quarterback on the roster
was hurt after the team's first scrimmage
this summer and tackle Joe Sanford dislo
cated an elbow just before the season be
gan. James actually had to use his fifth
string punter to open the season because
the top four were injured.
Further brightening the Husky outlook,
quarterback Warren Moon's passing
"isn't even close to where it was in the
spring," according to James.
Give James a few points for honesty.
Washington does have some proven ta
lent and some newcomers with star po
tential. Offensively, the strength is at
running back and wide receiver. Senior
Robin Earl, that 6-foot-5, 250-pound
moose of a fullback, gained 782 yards last
year and is already the third leading
rusher in Washington history.
Halfback recruit
To complement Earl, James was going
to recruit a speedy halfback this year if it
killed him. He came up with Ronnie Row
land, a junior college All-American from
San Jose City College.
"We spent a lot of time evaluating JC
backs," James said. "We identified the
three best Caliornia JC backs and only
wanted to bring one in. We had Ronnie
Rowland at the top of the list. He has good
size (6-2, 195), speed and he has experi
ence running to where the holes are."
Freshman Joe Steele, a high school
All-American last year from Seattle, will
also play a lot at halfback. James calls him
"a legitimate big time running back."

One place Washington does have ex
perience is at wide receiver. Senior Scott
Phillips is small (only 166 pounds), but
he has caught more passes for more yards
than any receiver in Washington history.
Senior Leon Garrett is a returning star
ter, but he could be challenged by
sophomore Robert "Spider" Gaines
from Richmond. Gaines, the Pac-8 high
hurdles champ, blocked two punts last
year against Stanford, both of which led
to touchdowns.
The question is, can Moon get the ball
to ( his receivers? He completed only 39
percent of his passes last year and was
replaced at mid-season.
James says the problem lies elsewhere.
"Moon's playing well enough to win. If
he'd just get some help."
Converted linemen
Help's not likely to come from the of
fensive line, although Blair Bush is strong
at center. Two of the line starters have
been converted from other positions.
The defensive standout is middle guard
Charles Jackson. The senior from Ber
keley was named to the All-Pac-8 Second
Team last year and is a potential Ail-
American this season.
Defensive end Kevin Richardson (6-3,
248) is worth mentioning because he's the
strongest man in Washington's history.
Richardson, who James describes as "the
biggest, fastest, strongest down lineman
we have," holds the school record in the
bench press at 485 pounds.
Richardson, Jackson, Earl, Phillips and
their not so illustrious colleagues will be
at Stanford Stadium two weeks from
Saturday. The Cards should win, and win
big.

The question is, can Moon get the ball
to ( his receivers? He completed only 39
percent of his passes last year and was
replaced at mid-season.
James says the problem lies elsewhere.
"Moon's playing well enough to win. If
he'd just get some help."
Converted linemen
Help's not likely to come from the of
fensive line, although Blair Bush is strong
at center. Two of the line starters have
been converted from other positions.
The defensive standout is middle guard
Charles Jackson. The senior from Ber
keley was named to the All-Pac-8 Second
Team last year and is a potential Ail-
American this season.
Defensive end Kevin Richardson (6-3,
248) is worth mentioning because he's the
strongest man in Washington's history.
Richardson, who James describes as "the
biggest, fastest, strongest down lineman
we have," holds the school record in the
bench press at 485 pounds.
Richardson, Jackson, Earl, Phillips and
their not so illustrious colleagues will be
at Stanford Stadium two weeks from
Saturday. The Cards should win, and win
big.
Daily sports editors Chris Baker and
Paul Bauman visited each of the Pacific
Eight schools at the end of the summer
and previewed their football teams for a
series of articles in the Daily. Actually,
the sports editors made it to every univer
sity except Washington State. Tough
break. But in fairness to the Cougars and
to the Pac-8, they did talk to coach Jackie
Sherrill, and Washington State will be
previewed in the Daily Wednesday. To
day: Washington.

SEATTLE, Wn.—It's only fitting that
clouds will be hovering over Husky
Stadium in Seattle most of the fall. The
picture for Head Football Coach Don
James and the 1976 Washington Huskies
is gloomy. Even dismal.
For beginners, 31 lettermen have
graduated off a team that came within six
points of going to the Rose Bowl. That's
almost twice as many players as any other
Pacific-8 team lost.
James is left with what he calls "a mas
sive rebuilding program." The problem is
especially critical on defense, where only
two of eleven starters return. James is
hurting for replacements.
Washington opened the season with
three defensive starters who had never
before played a down of college football, a
comerback who had never played in the
secondary before and a junior college
transfer. Behind these starters is little
more than a bunch of high school letter
men.
Washington led the Pac-8 in pass de
fense last year, but all four starting defen
sive backs have graduated. James de
scribes the new secondary as "short, light

and inexperienced."
Washington's troubles have been mul
tiplied by what it could least afford —
injuries. Every quarterback on the roster
was hurt after the team's first scrimmage
this summer and tackle Joe Sanford dislo
cated an elbow just before the season be
gan. James actually had to use his fifth
string punter to open the season because
the top four were injured.
Further brightening the Husky outlook,
quarterback Warren Moon's passing
"isn't even close to where it was in the
spring," according to James.
Give James a few points for honesty.
Washington does have some proven ta
lent and some newcomers with star po
tential. Offensively, the strength is at
running back and wide receiver. Senior
Robin Earl, that 6-foot-5, 250-pound
moose of a fullback, gained 782 yards last
year and is already the third leading
rusher in Washington history.
Halfback recruit
To complement Earl, James was going
to recruit a speedy halfback this year if it
killed him. He came up with Ronnie Row
land, a junior college All-American from
San Jose City College.
"We spent a lot of time evaluating JC
backs," James said. "We identified the
three best Caliornia JC backs and only
wanted to bring one in. We had Ronnie
Rowland at the top of the list. He has good
size (6-2, 195), speed and he has experi
ence running to where the holes are."
Freshman Joe Steele, a high school
All-American last year from Seattle, will
also play a lot at halfback. James calls him
"a legitimate big time running back."

One place Washington does have ex
perience is at wide receiver. Senior Scott
Phillips is small (only 166 pounds), but
he has caught more passes for more yards
than any receiver in Washington history.
Senior Leon Garrett is a returning star
ter, but he could be challenged by
sophomore Robert "Spider" Gaines
from Richmond. Gaines, the Pac-8 high
hurdles champ, blocked two punts last
year against Stanford, both of which led
to touchdowns.
The question is, can Moon get the ball
to ( his receivers? He completed only 39
percent of his passes last year and was
replaced at mid-season.
