If United Stanford Employees (USE)
goes on strike this week, it shouldn't
come as much of a surprise in light of

— News analysis —

the many skirmishes between USE and
the university during the last nine
months.
Highlights of some of this year's
lawsuits, grievances and infighting
included:

—ln early January, USE Asst. Presi
dent Bill Reynolds was laid off from
his machinist position at Hansen
Laboratories. USE contended that
Reynolds was laid off because of his
union affiliation. The university said a
demonstration by USE members was
picketing, which was a violation of the
universitv-USE contract. Union Presi
dent Jim Berk termed the demonstra
tions "educational."
—In Eebruary, an arbitrator found
that the Stanford Linear Accelerator

Center (SLAG) had treated two SLAG
radiation monitors in a racist manner.
Appropriate retroactive pay and job
classification raises were ordered.
—In March, the National Labor Rela
tions Board authorized the issuance of
a complaint against the university and
Stanford Hospital alleging that hospi
tal officials unlawfully assisted two
minority employe groups engaging in
attempts to increase minority hiring
and employe relations programs. The
complaint was the result of charges
filed in April 1975 by USE during a
labor election campaign at the hospi
tal.
—In early March, two police-fire
dispatchers filed a civil suit against the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office for
alleged harassment from Stanford
police officials. The dispatchers also
filed a sex discrimination protest
against a Stanford police captain.
—After a March meeting between
USE and university representatives for
preliminary contract talks, a univer
sity official labeled the talks "produc
tive." A USE officer described the
meeting as "almost totally nonproduc
tive."
— In April, officials of four labor
unions, including USE, criticized the
university for laying off about 40 Stan
ford Press workers when the press
closed its printing operation.
— In April, a police-fire dispatcher
who had filed a civil suit and a sex
discrimination complaint against her
police superiors in February was sus
pended by her Plant Services super
visor for failing to dispatch an officer
to a police call. The dispatcher and
USE responded with a grievance
against both the Public Safety and
Plant Services departments, claiming
that thr suspension was part of a con

tinuing effort to find grounds for firing
the dispatcher.
— In late April, the university filed
an unfair labor practice charge with
the NLRB against USE. alleging that a
USE lawsuit was designed to unlaw
fully force three university employes
to become union members. The USE
suit was later withdrawn.
— A few days later, USE filed a suit
against the university's Board of Trus
tees, alleging that the university was
delaying the arbitration of employe
grievances.
— On May 10, USE submitted to the
university its formal contract de
mands. Those demands included re
troactive cost-of-living payments to
workers from the last three years
amounting to $1858 per worker,
minimum pay of $774 per month or
$4.47 per hour with cost-of-living ad
justments. cost-of-living adjustments
in future pay based on quarterly Con
sumer Price Index changes.
Douglas Barton, chief university
negotiator, labeled the demands
"clearly unreasonable."
— In May, a petition was circulated
among workers in the bargaining unit
which USE represents calling for the
decertification of USE as the bargain
ing agent. The petition failed to get
enough signatures.
— On July 6. the University filed an
unfair labor practice charge with the
NLRB charging that USE had refused
to schedule collective bargaining ses
sions or to negotiate "release time"
(timeoff with pay) for USE negotiators.

—In Eebruary, an arbitrator found
that the Stanford Linear Accelerator

Center (SLAG) had treated two SLAG
radiation monitors in a racist manner.
Appropriate retroactive pay and job
classification raises were ordered.
—In March, the National Labor Rela
tions Board authorized the issuance of
a complaint against the university and
Stanford Hospital alleging that hospi
tal officials unlawfully assisted two
minority employe groups engaging in
attempts to increase minority hiring
and employe relations programs. The
complaint was the result of charges
filed in April 1975 by USE during a
labor election campaign at the hospi
tal.
—In early March, two police-fire
dispatchers filed a civil suit against the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office for
alleged harassment from Stanford
police officials. The dispatchers also
filed a sex discrimination protest
against a Stanford police captain.
—After a March meeting between
USE and university representatives for
preliminary contract talks, a univer
sity official labeled the talks "produc
tive." A USE officer described the
meeting as "almost totally nonproduc
tive."
— In April, officials of four labor
unions, including USE, criticized the
university for laying off about 40 Stan
ford Press workers when the press
closed its printing operation.
— In April, a police-fire dispatcher
who had filed a civil suit and a sex
discrimination complaint against her
police superiors in February was sus
pended by her Plant Services super
visor for failing to dispatch an officer
to a police call. The dispatcher and
USE responded with a grievance
against both the Public Safety and
Plant Services departments, claiming
that thr suspension was part of a con

tinuing effort to find grounds for firing
the dispatcher.
— In late April, the university filed
an unfair labor practice charge with
the NLRB against USE. alleging that a
USE lawsuit was designed to unlaw
fully force three university employes
to become union members. The USE
suit was later withdrawn.
— A few days later, USE filed a suit
against the university's Board of Trus
tees, alleging that the university was
delaying the arbitration of employe
grievances.
— On May 10, USE submitted to the
university its formal contract de
mands. Those demands included re
troactive cost-of-living payments to
workers from the last three years
amounting to $1858 per worker,
minimum pay of $774 per month or
$4.47 per hour with cost-of-living ad
justments. cost-of-living adjustments
in future pay based on quarterly Con
sumer Price Index changes.
Douglas Barton, chief university
negotiator, labeled the demands
"clearly unreasonable."
— In May, a petition was circulated
among workers in the bargaining unit
which USE represents calling for the
decertification of USE as the bargain
ing agent. The petition failed to get
enough signatures.
— On July 6. the University filed an
unfair labor practice charge with the
NLRB charging that USE had refused
to schedule collective bargaining ses
sions or to negotiate "release time"
(timeoff with pay) for USE negotiators.
— On July 22. Berk resigned as pres
ident of USE, citing an inability to
"function effectively" in his respon
sibilities. During the 1074 USE strike.
Berk was arrested for blocking the en-
trance of construction equipment at
Stanford Hospital.
— In late July, Berk nominated him
self to be president. USE members
elected Roger Hardy, former union
public relations officer, as president.
— In August, university stores used
methods considered questionable to
hire students who will cross picket
lines in the event of a USE strike.
— In early August, university stores
began contingency planning in the
event of a strike. Both the university
Food Service and Plant Services said
they would follow the contingency
plans used in the 1974 strike.
Even though it is doubtful that either
the university or USE planned these
actions to test each other's strength,
the score shows the two parties about
even.
USE has had a long, uphill struggle
since its inception in 1973, having had
to first beat out the Teamsters, then
gain acceptance in the university
community. USE would like to expand
its membership and increase its
power.
The university apparently would
like to see USE remain at its present
strength or become weaker. The future
of USE will probably hinge on the final
negotiation of the new contract. If the
USE bargaining team accepts the uni
versity offers, or if union members vote
to strike but then wage a lackluster
strike, it could very well spell the end
of USE.
If United Stanford Employees (USE)
goes on strike this week, it shouldn't
come as much of a surprise in light of

the many skirmishes between USE and
the university during the last nine
months.
Highlights of some of this year's
lawsuits, grievances and infighting
included:

—ln early January, USE Asst. Presi
dent Bill Reynolds was laid off from
his machinist position at Hansen
Laboratories. USE contended that
Reynolds was laid off because of his
union affiliation. The university said a
demonstration by USE members was
picketing, which was a violation of the

police officials. The dispatchers also
filed a sex discrimination protest
against a Stanford police captain.
—After a March meeting between
USE and university representatives for
preliminary contract talks, a univer
sity official labeled the talks "produc
tive." A USE officer described the
meeting as "almost totally nonproduc
tive."
— In April, officials of four labor
unions, including USE, criticized the
university for laying off about 40 Stan
ford Press workers when the press
closed its printing operation.
— In April, a police-fire dispatcher
who had filed a civil suit and a sex
discrimination complaint against her
police superiors in February was sus
pended by her Plant Services super
visor for failing to dispatch an officer
to a police call. The dispatcher and
USE responded with a grievance
against both the Public Safety and
Plant Services departments, claiming
that thr suspension was part of a con

tinuing effort to find grounds for firing
the dispatcher.
— In late April, the university filed
an unfair labor practice charge with
the NLRB against USE. alleging that a
USE lawsuit was designed to unlaw
fully force three university employes
to become union members. The USE
suit was later withdrawn.
— A few days later, USE filed a suit
against the university's Board of Trus
tees, alleging that the university was
delaying the arbitration of employe
grievances.
— On May 10, USE submitted to the
university its formal contract de
mands. Those demands included re
troactive cost-of-living payments to
workers from the last three years
amounting to $1858 per worker,
minimum pay of $774 per month or
$4.47 per hour with cost-of-living ad
justments. cost-of-living adjustments
in future pay based on quarterly Con
sumer Price Index changes.
Douglas Barton, chief university
negotiator, labeled the demands
"clearly unreasonable."
— In May, a petition was circulated
among workers in the bargaining unit
which USE represents calling for the
decertification of USE as the bargain
ing agent. The petition failed to get
enough signatures.
— On July 6. the University filed an
unfair labor practice charge with the
NLRB charging that USE had refused
to schedule collective bargaining ses
sions or to negotiate "release time"
(timeoff with pay) for USE negotiators.
— On July 22. Berk resigned as pres
ident of USE, citing an inability to
"function effectively" in his respon
sibilities. During the 1074 USE strike.
Berk was arrested for blocking the en-
trance of construction equipment at
Stanford Hospital.
— In late July, Berk nominated him
self to be president. USE members
elected Roger Hardy, former union
public relations officer, as president.
— In August, university stores used
methods considered questionable to
hire students who will cross picket
lines in the event of a USE strike.
— In early August, university stores
began contingency planning in the
event of a strike. Both the university
Food Service and Plant Services said
they would follow the contingency
plans used in the 1974 strike.
Even though it is doubtful that either
the university or USE planned these
actions to test each other's strength,
the score shows the two parties about
even.
USE has had a long, uphill struggle
since its inception in 1973, having had
to first beat out the Teamsters, then
gain acceptance in the university
community. USE would like to expand
its membership and increase its
power.
The university apparently would
like to see USE remain at its present
strength or become weaker. The future
of USE will probably hinge on the final
negotiation of the new contract. If the
USE bargaining team accepts the uni
versity offers, or if union members vote
to strike but then wage a lackluster
strike, it could very well spell the end
of USE.
