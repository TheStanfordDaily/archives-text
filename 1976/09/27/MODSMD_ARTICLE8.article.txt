## Looking forward to the new year 
### 
One of the more immediately noticeable changes in the Daily
this year will be the demise of Thursday, a weekly half-sized
edition of the Daily which helped spotlight a campus trend or
event.
A SCIRE course last spring surveyed our readers to find out
their views on Thursday. Though most liked it, almost everyone
expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of substantial coverage ot
local news. They favored the innovative graphics and the in
depth feature concept.
This year, we hope to have the best of both worlds by publish
ing a full-sized Daily every day, with local news coverage
boosted by a corps of "beat" reporters assigned to report on
certain sectors of the university. All too often in the past, the
Daily has been forced to rely on anonymous tips or on the
University News Service for information.
Simultaneously, we have formed a Daily Task Force to report
in-depth on vital local issues. Dan Fiduccia will coordinate
teams of beat reporters and, we hope, improve on Thursday's
erratic record by concentrating on the quality, not quantity, of
investigations.
The "new look" of the paper, as showcased in Thursday, will
continue to change under the guidance of Graphics Coordinator
Mark Funk. Our photographers, when given the chance, have
demonstrated their creativity — Mark will assure them more
opportunities to express their talent.
Our final major internal change involves a new position —
executive editor. Bonny Rodden will fill the role, and her re
sponsibilities include staff recruiting. TheDaiiy needs reporters,
photographers and cartoonists — and we even offer on-the-job
training. The monetary rewards are small, but the satisfactions
(and notoriety) are large.
Last year, the Daily made great strides in regaining its credibil
ity. This year, we will seek the respect of the community by
going out aed actively seeking the news. I invite you to join us.
