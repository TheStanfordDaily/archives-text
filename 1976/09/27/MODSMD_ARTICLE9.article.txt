# Letters: advice
## 
### 
Forget the name
I came here from New York last year
and wasted a lot of time getting ad
justed to Stanford. I have some advice
to those new students who may feel
confused. Or worse, to those who have
not yet let themselves feel confused,
and are still sure of themselves.
My first piece of advice is to watch
your teachers. And if you find one who
you have something to ask or talk to.
then do it. Immediately do it. Re
member that there may be some pro
fessors who will have important things
to say to you.
So don't worry about how you look,
or how you might be judged, or what
you have to ask, because the more your
mind is on these things, the less likely
you are to see and hear a good teacher.
My second feeling is that you should
choose your fantasy trip soon. All
those things that you know in the back
of your mind that you'll be into some
time? Don't hold back. Be explicit with
your friends. Remember that this is
California, and anything goes.
Don't make friends just to know
people. Don't do anvthi ng as a reaction
to loneliness. Choose the people around
you with care; you may fall in love
with some of them.
Now here is the main thrust of this
warning. Watch everyone here doing
the "Stanford Number." There are un
iforms. Ways of walking and talking.
Croups within groups. Rituals of mass
suffering and mass ecstacy. Don't be
lieve any of that stuff. Don't trouble
your mind with the ins and outs of it.
None of that is worth it.
Forget the Stanford name. Re
member that you are responsible for
being here. It is entirely voluntary.

There was no lottery here. Sit down
and do a mental re-grouping of your
intentions and interests. Then, staying
relaxed, go out there and be exactly
who you are.
I give you this warning. If you try to
act the whole thing, you'll break soon.
So start real. Don't be taken in by any
one.

Luncheon surprises
Today I sat down to lunch at a table
behind the Coffee House. As usual, I
had to clear aside soggy paper plates,
coffee cups and glasses before I could
set down my soup bowl and two pac
kages of saltines.
When I went to crumble the crackers
into my soup, I found that they were
stuck to the table. I picked up a napkin
to wipe my fingers. My fingers were
fused to the napkin and the napkin to
the table by a concoction of honey and
bird excrement.
With my free hand, I attempted to
push back my chair. This action served
only to crush some of the flies, who
were holding a conference there.
The survivors buzzed around my
head.
In the meantime, a specimen of that
rare Stanford Blackbird had landed on
the edge of my bowl and was sampling
the soup of the day. Three Coffee
House Curs sniffed at me. The largest
extended its tongue and ingested
soup, bowl, spoon and saltines.
The bird escaped.
