You don't have to be in
Chicago to be part of the
r
Daily machine.
(Tribune
THE W ORL D' S GREATEST* NEWS PA PER
Stanford has its own Daily machine right here in the Storke
Publications Building. And that machine is a bit short of essen
tial parts. In other words, we need some more nuts around here
... and bolts, too. If you're eager to shoot people in action, join
our photography staff. And if it's thriving on surreptitious politi
cal activities you're after, become one of our news staffers. If
you're anxious to wear one of those fancy pin stripe suits, cover
the opera or the symphony for the entertainment department.
And then if you like to twist a few arms during secluded inter
views in isolated spots, our features crew could use you to write
profiles. And if you like to play the cards, the numbers, or the
field, join our sports staff or come to our parties.
Everything that Chicago can offer we can offer, too. If you're
still not convinced, meet John Freed or Dan Fiduccia. They're
our local Chicagoans in residence.

You don't have to be in
Chicago to be part of the
r
Daily machine.
(Tribune
THE W ORL D' S GREATEST* NEWS PA PER
Stanford has its own Daily machine right here in the Storke
Publications Building. And that machine is a bit short of essen
tial parts. In other words, we need some more nuts around here
... and bolts, too. If you're eager to shoot people in action, join
our photography staff. And if it's thriving on surreptitious politi
cal activities you're after, become one of our news staffers. If
you're anxious to wear one of those fancy pin stripe suits, cover
the opera or the symphony for the entertainment department.
And then if you like to twist a few arms during secluded inter
views in isolated spots, our features crew could use you to write
profiles. And if you like to play the cards, the numbers, or the
field, join our sports staff or come to our parties.
Everything that Chicago can offer we can offer, too. If you're
still not convinced, meet John Freed or Dan Fiduccia. They're
our local Chicagoans in residence.
