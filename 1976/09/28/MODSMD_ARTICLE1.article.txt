# 1974 USE strike failed to shut down campus
## Attention focused on high jinks, not substance 
### Dave Smith 
When the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union staged its
first strike in the late spring of 1974,
union officials were hoping to bring
university operations to their most
painful standstill since the 1906
earthquake.
"The university doesn't know
how to go about a strike, - ' warned
Jim Berk, then-president of USE.
"They are going to hurt, and when
they hurt enough, they are going to
pay us the money."
Berk was partly right: at first, the
university did not seem quite sure
how to do without 950 service and

maintenance workers — who in
cluded three of every four food ser
vice employes. But as the three
week strike wore on and students
prepared to leave at the end of
spring quarter, it became apparent
that the University was not hurting
enough to grant the 23 per cent
wage increase that USE demanded.
The strike ended rather antic
limactically as the university
granted an average 10 per cent wage
boost and a weary Berk claimed an
"amazing" victory for his union.
Berk has since resigned, apparently
convinced that he no longer has the
confidence of his members, but the
current USE leadership has cer
tainly studied Berk's tactics as they
prepare for what maybe the union's

second strike.
At first Berk's strategy focused on
construction sites and freight de
livery vehicles. Berk himself was
arrested on the strike's third day for
sitting in front of a mobile crane
entering a site at the Stanford Hos
pital. But while truck drivers (who
did not honor the strike) and union
pickets tried to outmaneuver each
other at the delivery sites, most stu
dents remained unaffected by the
strike.
The food service, faced with a se
vere labor shortage, offered one
week rebates. About half the food
service users accepted the offer,
causing a huge crush at Old Union
rebate tables but easing the load on
the dining halls that remained
open.
Classes went on undisrupted, de
spite the efforts of a few graduate
students to muster support for the
strike from classroom teaching as
sistants. Even though many
maintenance workers honored the
strike, student residences did not
become abnormally dirty. Al
though some very costly technolog
ical and scientific experiments
were endangered by the walkout of
technicians and laboratory assis
tants, the university community
did not seem greatly perturbed by
these problems.

sympathizers got most of the head
lines, obscuring the demands
which Berk and university rep
resentative Doug Barton were
negotiating. Such low intrigue as a
striker's lashing himself to the
boom of a 160-foot crane, saboteurs'
destruction of toilets and slashing
the tires of university vehicles be
came virtually the only evidence
that the strike was still in progress.
Berk even overturned a table in
what he called a "Christ-like" ges
ture to stir up the strikers.

In the end the union had to back
down on many of its demands, but
the strike did provide the university
with a somewhat unwelcome in
troduction to the niceties of hard
line labor negotiations. The union
promised that the first strike was
only a beginning, and that someday
the USE would be powerful enough
to force the university to accept
union terms — or face a shutdown
that would make the last strike
seem like a training maneuver,
which in some ways it was.

sympathizers got most of the head
lines, obscuring the demands
which Berk and university rep
resentative Doug Barton were
negotiating. Such low intrigue as a
striker's lashing himself to the
boom of a 160-foot crane, saboteurs'
destruction of toilets and slashing
the tires of university vehicles be
came virtually the only evidence
that the strike was still in progress.
Berk even overturned a table in
what he called a "Christ-like" ges
ture to stir up the strikers.

In the end the union had to back
down on many of its demands, but
the strike did provide the university
with a somewhat unwelcome in
troduction to the niceties of hard
line labor negotiations. The union
promised that the first strike was
only a beginning, and that someday
the USE would be powerful enough
to force the university to accept
union terms — or face a shutdown
that would make the last strike
seem like a training maneuver,
which in some ways it was.
When the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union staged its
first strike in the late spring of 1974,
union officials were hoping to bring
university operations to their most
painful standstill since the 1906
earthquake.
"The university doesn't know
how to go about a strike, - ' warned
Jim Berk, then-president of USE.
"They are going to hurt, and when
they hurt enough, they are going to
pay us the money."
Berk was partly right: at first, the
university did not seem quite sure
how to do without 950 service and

maintenance workers — who in
cluded three of every four food ser
vice employes. But as the three
week strike wore on and students
prepared to leave at the end of
spring quarter, it became apparent
that the University was not hurting
enough to grant the 23 per cent
wage increase that USE demanded.
The strike ended rather antic
limactically as the university
granted an average 10 per cent wage
boost and a weary Berk claimed an
"amazing" victory for his union.
Berk has since resigned, apparently
convinced that he no longer has the
confidence of his members, but the
current USE leadership has cer
tainly studied Berk's tactics as they
prepare for what maybe the union's

second strike.
At first Berk's strategy focused on
construction sites and freight de
livery vehicles. Berk himself was
arrested on the strike's third day for
sitting in front of a mobile crane
entering a site at the Stanford Hos
pital. But while truck drivers (who
did not honor the strike) and union
pickets tried to outmaneuver each
other at the delivery sites, most stu
dents remained unaffected by the
strike.
The food service, faced with a se
vere labor shortage, offered one
week rebates. About half the food
service users accepted the offer,
causing a huge crush at Old Union
rebate tables but easing the load on
the dining halls that remained
open.
Classes went on undisrupted, de
spite the efforts of a few graduate
students to muster support for the
strike from classroom teaching as
sistants. Even though many
maintenance workers honored the
strike, student residences did not
become abnormally dirty. Al
though some very costly technolog
ical and scientific experiments
were endangered by the walkout of
technicians and laboratory assis
tants, the university community
did not seem greatly perturbed by
these problems.
