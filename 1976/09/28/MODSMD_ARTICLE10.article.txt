'Poor taste'
Your orientation issue was informa
tive and entertaining. The articles on
this year's freshman class (page 1) and
on remedial geography (page 18) were
particularly well written.
However, 1 found the title, "Little
Leland's Lexicon," and some of the en
tries, e.g. "Hoover's last erection," for
the article on page 3 to be in very poor
taste. 1 regard as equally poor taste the
student choice of Robber Barons as a
team name, though I applaud the
movement to restore the name Indians.
(Some objections to traditions and cus
toms on racist or sexist grounds are
just downright silly.)
I am undoubtedly not the only per
son who thinks that such terms are of
fensive. An apology to the benefactors
of this fine university is in order.

Peace department
The United States has $100 billion a
year for the department of fear, force,
human misery, violence and death: the
military.
But the United States does not have a
dime for a department of peace. It
would be the responsibility of such a
department to produce universal
peace, mankind and world govern
ment. In union there is strength.
Man could obtain the good, happy
world — a veritable heaven on earth if
he would put his mind, potential and
money into that effort. Man's will has
moved mountains. His fate is in his
own hands. His choice is for good or
evil — for the good world or self
destruction by his own hands. It can
happen either way.
In these days of world communica
tion, a world government is absolutely
necessary if we are to survive.
Now is the time.

Loneliness
I am a white male, 23 years old, pre
sently incarcerated in a penal institu
tion in Ohio. 1 have been confined for
the past four years. In this time, I have
come to know what loneliness is a
bout.
1 receive very little mail, and in a
place like this, mail is a very important
part of a man's life. It is a means of
escaping the sickness by which 1 am
surrounded and a way of keeping in
touch with reality.
This is my first time to be incarcer
ated, and 1 mean to make it my last.
1 am hoping that your readers might
become interested and include me in
their daily lives.
I am seeking friendship and would
be extremely grateful if you could help
me in this matter.
I remain hopeful.

sently incarcerated in a penal institu
tion in Ohio. 1 have been confined for
the past four years. In this time, I have
come to know what loneliness is a
bout.
1 receive very little mail, and in a
place like this, mail is a very important
part of a man's life. It is a means of
escaping the sickness by which 1 am
surrounded and a way of keeping in
touch with reality.
This is my first time to be incarcer

1 am hoping that your readers might

their daily lives.
I am seeking friendship and would
be extremely grateful if you could help
me in this matter.
I remain hopeful.

'Poor taste'
Your orientation issue was informa
tive and entertaining. The articles on
this year's freshman class (page 1) and
on remedial geography (page 18) were
particularly well written.
However, 1 found the title, "Little
Leland's Lexicon," and some of the en
tries, e.g. "Hoover's last erection," for
the article on page 3 to be in very poor
taste. 1 regard as equally poor taste the
student choice of Robber Barons as a
team name, though I applaud the
movement to restore the name Indians.
(Some objections to traditions and cus
toms on racist or sexist grounds are
just downright silly.)
I am undoubtedly not the only per
son who thinks that such terms are of
fensive. An apology to the benefactors
of this fine university is in order.

Peace department
The United States has $100 billion a
year for the department of fear, force,
human misery, violence and death: the
military.
But the United States does not have a
dime for a department of peace. It
would be the responsibility of such a
department to produce universal
peace, mankind and world govern
ment. In union there is strength.
Man could obtain the good, happy
world — a veritable heaven on earth if
he would put his mind, potential and
money into that effort. Man's will has
moved mountains. His fate is in his
own hands. His choice is for good or
evil — for the good world or self
destruction by his own hands. It can
happen either way.
In these days of world communica
tion, a world government is absolutely
necessary if we are to survive.
Now is the time.
