# Stanford's Zeta Chapter
## Alpha Phi Omega serves 
### Charlie Parker 
If you take a close look at the
cover of your autumn reg packet,
you will notice the name "Alpha
Phi Omega" near the bottom.
Zeta Chapter of Alpha Phi
Omega (A-Phi-O), a national
service fraternity, organized and
led the reg packet stuffing in the
ASSU offices in Tresidder Union
Sunday.
Reg packet stuffing is a quar
terly project for A-Phi-O. Mem
bers of the fraternity arrange for a
room and direct the set-up. This
year the project was directed by
A-Phi-O President Blair Pic
kerell and last year's president.
Russ Ritter.
The work is done mainly by
volunteers. Each group that
wishes something placed in the
packet supplies the leaflets and
two people to gather packets to
gether. Some paid workers are
also used.

When you walk into the room
where reg packet stuffing is
going on, you cannot help but be
impressed by the factory-like
atmosphere. As stacks get low,
workers call out such titles as
"Religion at Stanford!" above
the rustle of paper and the chat
ter. Runners shout back, "Does
anyone need a box?"
A-Phi-O is involved in many
other campus and community
projects as well. Working out of
their office in Old Firehouse on
Santa Theresa street, A-Phi-O
sponsors a quarterly book ex
change.
Book exchange
The book exchange is a non
profit bookstore where students
can sell their used books on con
signment. Students bring in
books the first few days of the
quarter, set a price, fill out a con
tract, and shelve the books them
selves. A-Phi-O members staff

the exchange for two weeks, sel
ling the books and holding the
money for the seller, keeping
only a small service fee. At the
end of two weeks, the books that
are left are returned to their
owners.
One of Zeta Chapter's most
successful projects is Blood
Drive. A-Phi-O members recruit
students in the dorms, row
houses and fraternities to sign
up for the bloodmobile, which
came here over 30 times last
year.
Dody Moffat at the American
Red Cross Stanford University
Blood Center indicated that
"one-fifth of all the blood we get
comes from Stanford students."
She said that last spring, the
amount of blood donated was
"very impressive."
'Big drive'
Last year, A-Phi-O blood drive
chairman Beth Hesselmeyer was
instrumental in challenging the
students at USC to a "Big Drive"
competition. Students here won
that competition this spring and
the blood center has a trophy to
show for it.
Alpha Phi Omega is the largest
national college fraternity hav
ing over 250 chapters on cam
puses across the country. Unlike
most fraternities, there are no
A-Phi-O houses. Residences are
prohibited by the national by
laws.

One major project sponsored by A-Phi-0 is the sponsorship of
a Scout troop in Palo Alto. Here the Scouts and A-Phi-O mem
bers work on repairing a dam in the Santa Cruz mountains.


The Stanford Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega offers a student
book exchange each quarter. Students may sell used text
books and buy new or used books. Here Blair Pickerell, Chap
ter president,looks over some of the books from past quarters.


A-Phi-0 sponsors reg packet stuffing each quarter, serving as
the coordinating group for all campus organizations who wish
- to use the service. This year's stuffing turned out to be quite a
feat.
