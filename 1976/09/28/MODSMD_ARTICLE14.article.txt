# Financial aids: key to enrollment patterns
## 
### Pat Noonan 
Students here can expect to
pay more than $6000 in tuition
and between $8000 and $9000
overall in 1979-80.
Will rising costs affect the
composition of the student
body?
Dean of Admissions Fred Har
gadon says, "You're damn right
I'm worried about tuition." But
he says he is less worried about
the ability of students to attend
than he is about the choices
people will make between
higher education and other con
sumer items.
"Maybe they'll rather spend
the $6000 a year on a Mercedes
Benz," he says.
President Richard Lyman
says, "As the gap in cost between
here and Berkeley increases, it
won't be a rational decision on
anyone's part to come here."
Nevertheless, 80 per cent of
those admitted here in 1975-76
but enrolled elsewhere chose
other equally high-priced pri
vate institutions. And 95 per
cent of the students accepted
both here and at Berkeley enrol
led at Stanford.
Director of Financial Aids
Robert Huff says he expects no
change in the student body as a
result of rising costs. Stanford's
financial budget includes a
"plan to continue to meet the
demonstrated need of all admit
ted students."
Families whose income is in
the $25,000 to $35,000 range are
expected to "give an awful lot,"
says Mary Roberts, assistant di
rectorfor undergraduateawards.
"But I don't think the middle
income group is being squeezed
out," she adds.
How helpful is the financial

aid program?
Some 55 per cent of students
here receive financial aid. Those
who apply for aid are expected to
meet expenses from family re
sources, summer earnings and
self-help, which consists of
loans and term-time employ
ment.
Stanford supplies scholar
ships to meet all of the remain-

ing need. In fact, 75 per cent of
all aid is in the form of grants.
The self-help contribution
varies according to one of four
categories students can be as
signed to: very low income, top
five per cent scholastically, di
versity — which is for students
of unusual talents — and major
ity — which includes all remain
ing students who have financial
need.
In 1976-77, a very low income
student will be expected to bor
row $500 as self-help. A majority
student must borrow $700 and
either work during school or
borrow $850 more. Diversity and
top-five-per-cent students get
packages in between these
ranges.
In addition, minority students

receive slightly better aid within
each category.
Low income and minority
students receive better aid be
cause they often come from poor
quality secondary schools and
need to study more to be com
petitive with other students.
By comparison, Stanford re
quires less self-help than any Ivy
League school.
The Consortium on Financing
Higher Education (CoFHE),
which included Stanford and 22
other high-cost selective private
institutions, studied freshman
admissions at these schools for
1974-75.
It found that 30 per cent of the
students enrolled here were in
the high need category, which
was defined by expected family
contributions under $2000.
Twenty-three per cent of Stan
ford enrollees were between the
category of high need and no
need.
Stanford compared favorably
with other CoFHE members,
which enrolled 22 per cent high
need and 16 per cent lower need
students.
Is it possible that many candi
dates will not even apply be
cause of soaring costs?
The CoFHE report showed no

significant changes in enroll
ment according to financial need
category from 1973 to 1975. Tui
tion rose from $3135 to $3810 in
this period. Also, applications to
Stanford have continued to in
crease over the last five years.
Hargadon says it's "absolutely
ridiculous to think that a Stan
ford degree doesn't pay off." He
says "you're dead wrong to tell a
kid to go to Podunk U. instead of
Stanford" because of costs.
Moreover, Hargadon says he
does not think the university
perpetuates socioeconomic clas
ses. He says a "generational
change" occurs.
As an example, he says, his
own parents didn't go beyond
eighth grade. But his children
are attending better schools than
he did.
Hargadon admits that Stan
ford is "not representative in
anything" including income
groups. "But the only reason it's
worthwhile to go here is that
we're not," he adds.
Furthermore, he says, "It's a
damn good thing 45 per cent of
the students pay their own way.
Tuition income is a big thing. No
university could afford to have
75 per cent of their students on
aid." •

Students here can expect to
pay more than $6000 in tuition
and between $8000 and $9000
overall in 1979-80.
Will rising costs affect the
composition of the student
body?
Dean of Admissions Fred Har
gadon says, "You're damn right
I'm worried about tuition." But
he says he is less worried about
the ability of students to attend
than he is about the choices
people will make between
higher education and other con
sumer items.
"Maybe they'll rather spend
the $6000 a year on a Mercedes
Benz," he says.
President Richard Lyman
says, "As the gap in cost between
here and Berkeley increases, it
won't be a rational decision on
anyone's part to come here."
Nevertheless, 80 per cent of
those admitted here in 1975-76
but enrolled elsewhere chose
other equally high-priced pri
vate institutions. And 95 per
cent of the students accepted
both here and at Berkeley enrol
led at Stanford.
Director of Financial Aids
Robert Huff says he expects no
change in the student body as a
result of rising costs. Stanford's
financial budget includes a
"plan to continue to meet the
demonstrated need of all admit
ted students."
Families whose income is in
the $25,000 to $35,000 range are
expected to "give an awful lot,"
says Mary Roberts, assistant di
rectorfor undergraduateawards.
"But I don't think the middle
income group is being squeezed
out," she adds.
How helpful is the financial

aid program?
Some 55 per cent of students
here receive financial aid. Those
who apply for aid are expected to
meet expenses from family re
sources, summer earnings and
self-help, which consists of
loans and term-time employ
ment.
Stanford supplies scholar
ships to meet all of the remain-

ing need. In fact, 75 per cent of
all aid is in the form of grants.
The self-help contribution
varies according to one of four
categories students can be as
signed to: very low income, top
five per cent scholastically, di
versity — which is for students
of unusual talents — and major
ity — which includes all remain
ing students who have financial
need.
In 1976-77, a very low income
student will be expected to bor
row $500 as self-help. A majority
student must borrow $700 and
either work during school or
borrow $850 more. Diversity and
top-five-per-cent students get
packages in between these
ranges.
In addition, minority students

receive slightly better aid within
each category.
Low income and minority
students receive better aid be
cause they often come from poor
quality secondary schools and
need to study more to be com
petitive with other students.
By comparison, Stanford re
quires less self-help than any Ivy
League school.
The Consortium on Financing
Higher Education (CoFHE),
which included Stanford and 22
other high-cost selective private
institutions, studied freshman
admissions at these schools for
1974-75.
It found that 30 per cent of the
students enrolled here were in
the high need category, which
was defined by expected family
contributions under $2000.
Twenty-three per cent of Stan
ford enrollees were between the
category of high need and no
need.
Stanford compared favorably
with other CoFHE members,
which enrolled 22 per cent high
need and 16 per cent lower need
students.
Is it possible that many candi
dates will not even apply be
cause of soaring costs?
The CoFHE report showed no

significant changes in enroll
ment according to financial need
category from 1973 to 1975. Tui
tion rose from $3135 to $3810 in
this period. Also, applications to
Stanford have continued to in
crease over the last five years.
Hargadon says it's "absolutely
ridiculous to think that a Stan
ford degree doesn't pay off." He
says "you're dead wrong to tell a
kid to go to Podunk U. instead of
Stanford" because of costs.
Moreover, Hargadon says he
does not think the university
perpetuates socioeconomic clas
ses. He says a "generational
change" occurs.
As an example, he says, his
own parents didn't go beyond
eighth grade. But his children
are attending better schools than
he did.
Hargadon admits that Stan
ford is "not representative in
anything" including income
groups. "But the only reason it's
worthwhile to go here is that
we're not," he adds.
Furthermore, he says, "It's a
damn good thing 45 per cent of
the students pay their own way.
Tuition income is a big thing. No
university could afford to have
75 per cent of their students on
aid." •

Students here can expect to
pay more than $6000 in tuition
and between $8000 and $9000
overall in 1979-80.
Will rising costs affect the
composition of the student
body?
Dean of Admissions Fred Har
gadon says, "You're damn right
I'm worried about tuition." But
he says he is less worried about
the ability of students to attend
than he is about the choices
people will make between
higher education and other con
sumer items.
"Maybe they'll rather spend
the $6000 a year on a Mercedes
Benz," he says.
President Richard Lyman
says, "As the gap in cost between
here and Berkeley increases, it
won't be a rational decision on
anyone's part to come here."
Nevertheless, 80 per cent of
those admitted here in 1975-76
but enrolled elsewhere chose
other equally high-priced pri
vate institutions. And 95 per
cent of the students accepted
both here and at Berkeley enrol
led at Stanford.
Director of Financial Aids
Robert Huff says he expects no
change in the student body as a
result of rising costs. Stanford's
financial budget includes a
"plan to continue to meet the
demonstrated need of all admit
ted students."
Families whose income is in
the $25,000 to $35,000 range are
expected to "give an awful lot,"
says Mary Roberts, assistant di
rectorfor undergraduateawards.
"But I don't think the middle
income group is being squeezed
out," she adds.
How helpful is the financial

aid program?
Some 55 per cent of students
here receive financial aid. Those
who apply for aid are expected to
meet expenses from family re
sources, summer earnings and
self-help, which consists of
loans and term-time employ
ment.
Stanford supplies scholar
ships to meet all of the remain-

ing need. In fact, 75 per cent of
all aid is in the form of grants.
The self-help contribution
varies according to one of four
categories students can be as
signed to: very low income, top
five per cent scholastically, di
versity — which is for students
of unusual talents — and major
ity — which includes all remain
ing students who have financial
need.
In 1976-77, a very low income
student will be expected to bor
row $500 as self-help. A majority
student must borrow $700 and
either work during school or
borrow $850 more. Diversity and
top-five-per-cent students get
packages in between these
ranges.
In addition, minority students

receive slightly better aid within
each category.
Low income and minority
students receive better aid be
cause they often come from poor
quality secondary schools and
need to study more to be com
petitive with other students.
By comparison, Stanford re
quires less self-help than any Ivy
League school.
The Consortium on Financing
Higher Education (CoFHE),
which included Stanford and 22
other high-cost selective private
institutions, studied freshman
admissions at these schools for
1974-75.
It found that 30 per cent of the
students enrolled here were in
the high need category, which
was defined by expected family
contributions under $2000.
Twenty-three per cent of Stan
ford enrollees were between the
category of high need and no
need.
Stanford compared favorably
with other CoFHE members,
which enrolled 22 per cent high
need and 16 per cent lower need
students.
Is it possible that many candi
dates will not even apply be
cause of soaring costs?
The CoFHE report showed no

significant changes in enroll
ment according to financial need
category from 1973 to 1975. Tui
tion rose from $3135 to $3810 in
this period. Also, applications to
Stanford have continued to in
crease over the last five years.
Hargadon says it's "absolutely
ridiculous to think that a Stan
ford degree doesn't pay off." He
says "you're dead wrong to tell a
kid to go to Podunk U. instead of
Stanford" because of costs.
Moreover, Hargadon says he
does not think the university
perpetuates socioeconomic clas
ses. He says a "generational
change" occurs.
As an example, he says, his
own parents didn't go beyond
eighth grade. But his children
are attending better schools than
he did.
Hargadon admits that Stan
ford is "not representative in
anything" including income
groups. "But the only reason it's
worthwhile to go here is that
we're not," he adds.
Furthermore, he says, "It's a
damn good thing 45 per cent of
the students pay their own way.
Tuition income is a big thing. No
university could afford to have
75 per cent of their students on
aid." •
