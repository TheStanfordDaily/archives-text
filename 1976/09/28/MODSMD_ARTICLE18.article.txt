# Granddad recalls days as 'executioner'

Walla Walla. Wash. (AP) -
He is slightly stooped now, 74, a
grandfather who bristles at being
called an "executioner." But yes,
he never missed a hanging at the
Washington State Penitentiary.
And yes. he says, its good that
murderers can once again be
hanged.
"So many want to call me an
executioner." he says. "There's
no such thing. There's a lot to an
execution. It takes about 20 men
to execute a prisoner."
Hut he did supervise some of
the hangings at the prison. He
was captain of the guards and
deputy warden, and he witnes
sed all of them — the 58 execu
tions conducted since he helped
build the wooden gallows in the
big yard in 1926.
"There might have been some
men who were executed who
shouldn't have been,"he says
now. "Others should have been
and weren't."
The state's first capital
punishment law was passed in
1909. After a big fire in 1926, the
penitentiary was rebuilt, includ
ing the scaffolding that served
for executions.
"I've never missed an execu
tion since 1926 — put it that

way," he said in describing his
role. He talked about those years
recently with the Seattle Post
intelligencer, which did not use
his name. He said it was the first
interview he has granted.
On the night before an execu
tion "it just seemed like there
was so much tension in the air."
he recalled. "The prison popula
tion was always put under dead
lock on those nights."
It was his task to place the spe
cial noose, made of one-inch
thick rope, around the prisoner's
neck and drop the black hood
over the man's head.
Most prisoners "took it pretty
calmly," he said. "Only two or
three put up a battle. Otherwise
they went out very peacefully."
Some turned to religion, he

said, but "some do a lot of cus
sing before they're executed."
The men he picked to assist in
the executions never showed
physical or emotional weakness,
he said, though none ever volun
teered. Their job was to strap the
doomed man's knees and arms.
Then four of them simultane
ously pushed buttons, one of
which released the trapdoor.
No one ever knew which of the
four buttons activated the death
trap, he said.
Nobody has been hanged in
Washington State in 13 years, al
though it is again possible.
Washington became the 33rd
state to reinstate capital
punishment following a Sup
reme Court decision that re
quired the redrafting of capital

punishment laws to eliminate
what the high court said was ar
bitrary and capricious enforce
ment.
The state's new law, effective
July 1, mandates death by hang
ing for persons convicted of ag
gravated first-degree murder.
However, that law is being chal
lenged.
The elderly hangman ap
proves of the new law. He said
execution by hanging is a deter
rent to crime but is a punishment
that should be reserved for mur
derers.
He retired from the peniten
tiary 20 years ago, but was called
back for the last two hangings, in
19(H) and 1963, "to help them
out because they didn't have
anybody."
