# Five state officials oppose Long Beach oil terminal site
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Five California energy and
environmental officials accused the federal gov
ernment yesterday of trying to blackmail the state
into accepting an Alaskan oil terminal that they
say would cause smog.
State Air Resources Hoard (ARB) Chairman
Tom Quinn told a news conference that a study
prepared by the Federal Energy Administration
(FEA) and the Environmental Protection Agency
shows that air pollution in southern California
would be "seriously aggravated" if the proposed
oil terminal were built in the Port of Long Beach as
planned.
Ouinn called on the two federal agencies to
release the report.
"We cannot understand why FEA would refuse
to make publican important document which was
prepared independently of the oil companies and
was designed to identify national interests and
distinguish them from the narrow concerns of

huge petroleum concerns," Quinn said.
The news conference was called jointly by
(Juinn, ARB member Alvin Gordon, state Energy
Commission Chairman Richard Maullin, and
Public Utilities Commission members Leonard
Ross and Robert Baltinovich.
The California officials said they resented the
"hint of blackmail" by lEA Deputy Administrator
John Hill, whom they said threatened to use fed
eral law to block new construction and ban addi
tional cars in the Los Angeles area unless the oil
terminal is approved.
"We have never ruled out a California site for
Alaskan oil delivery, but current plans for a Long
Beach location would risk a smog disaster for all
southern California," the state officials said in a
joint statement.
They said there were several proposed sites in
the state, but that Long Beach appeared to be the
worst.
