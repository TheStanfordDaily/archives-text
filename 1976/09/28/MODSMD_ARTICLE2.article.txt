# Dispute over vaccine's effectiveness
## Campus swine flu program to start soon 
### Marc Strassman 
Protection from swine flu for members of the
Stanford i ommunity will be available during day
time weekday hours through an inoculation prog
ram on campus starting in mid-October, according
to James McClenahan, director of Co well Student
Ilealth CCenter.
McClenahan thinks the dangers from being in
oculated ire less than the risk associated with the
contracting the disease without protection. "Our
understanding from national field tests show the
vac< ine to he verv sate, with very few side effects.
The results, in fa( t. have been better than for several
past vaccines."
\l< (llenahan added, "The national recommenda
tion is that no one knows how likely it is that there
will he an epidemic . and since the vaccine is safe
,ind effet five, everyone should get it."
No epidemic?
I.inus Pauling, Nobel Laureate and professor
emeritus of chemistry, does not agree.
I don't encourage people to he vaccinated un
less they have a serious medical problem," he says.
Me (ites <is the most important reason for this con
clusion tin 1 ta< t that "I don't see any evidence that
there is going to be an epidemic."
"There was an outbreak of the disease during

January and February at Ft. Dix (New Jersey)," Paul
ing poi nts out, "and only four per cent of the people
at Ft. Dix were affected, which indicates that it isn't
very infectious." Me adds: "If you have vitamin C,
you have extra protection against the flu."
Few side effects
Thomas Merigan, professor of medicine at Stan
ford Medical School and head of the Division of
Infectious Diseases, differs with Pauling. "It's a
complicated issue." he cautioned.
"I'm in favor of it, not because anyone knows
whether or not there will be an epidemic, but since
the disease is one that few students will have
natural immunity against and since it has a low rate
of side effects, as recent < .ireful studies of the vac
cine have shown, the dangers from it are so low that
it seems worthwhile to participate."
Two varieties of vaccine will he generally availa
ble to participants in the community program The
monovalent type will provide immunity against
the viral strain that broke out at Ft. Dix, known as
A-N'ev\ Jersey or swine flu. The bivalent type will
provide protection against swine flu and also
against the A-Victoria strain of influenza.
This bivalent type, as well as a third variety
(monovalent which confers immunity against the
B-Hong Kong strain) will be available to students.

faculty and staff in high-risk categories.
Individuals in the high-risk categories are those
who are more likely to suffer complications from an
actual attack of the flu. Included in this group are
people with chronic pulmonary disease, such as
asthma or emphysema, heart disease, or other
chronic debilitating diseases, such as diabetes.
People in the high-risk group shoidd get the biva
lent variety vaccine against A-Victoria flu as well as
swine flu, and should also make arrangements
through Cowell to receive the monvalent B-Hong
Kong type, according to Dorothy Beaumont, im
munization nurse at Cowell.
Swine flu vaccine is grown in eggs, so individu
als who are allergic either to eggs or to chicken
protein should not receive the vaccine.
Three days a week
McCllenahan said that he envisions a program on
campus that will run two or three days a week for
several weeks. He estimates th.it as many as 20,000
to 25.000 people may receive inoculations, depend
ing on what percentage of the Stanford community
decides to participate.
McClenahan also mentioned that the campus
program will need nurse volunteers as well as vol
unteers without special training to "do screening,
help roll up sleeves, and comfort people who
faint."

Stanford i ommunity will be available during day
time weekday hours through an inoculation prog
ram on campus starting in mid-October, according
to James McClenahan, director of Co well Student
Ilealth CCenter.
McClenahan thinks the dangers from being in
oculated ire less than the risk associated with the
contracting the disease without protection. "Our
understanding from national field tests show the
vac< ine to he verv sate, with very few side effects.
The results, in fa( t. have been better than for several
past vaccines."
\l< (llenahan added, "The national recommenda
tion is that no one knows how likely it is that there
will he an epidemic . and since the vaccine is safe
,ind effet five, everyone should get it."
No epidemic?
I.inus Pauling, Nobel Laureate and professor
emeritus of chemistry, does not agree.

"There was an outbreak of the disease during

January and February at Ft. Dix (New Jersey)," Paul
ing poi nts out, "and only four per cent of the people
at Ft. Dix were affected, which indicates that it isn't
very infectious." Me adds: "If you have vitamin C,
you have extra protection against the flu."
Few side effects
Thomas Merigan, professor of medicine at Stan
ford Medical School and head of the Division of
Infectious Diseases, differs with Pauling. "It's a
complicated issue." he cautioned.
"I'm in favor of it, not because anyone knows
whether or not there will be an epidemic, but since
the disease is one that few students will have
natural immunity against and since it has a low rate
of side effects, as recent < .ireful studies of the vac
cine have shown, the dangers from it are so low that
it seems worthwhile to participate."
Two varieties of vaccine will he generally availa
ble to participants in the community program The
monovalent type will provide immunity against
the viral strain that broke out at Ft. Dix, known as
A-N'ev\ Jersey or swine flu. The bivalent type will
provide protection against swine flu and also
against the A-Victoria strain of influenza.
This bivalent type, as well as a third variety
(monovalent which confers immunity against the
B-Hong Kong strain) will be available to students.

faculty and staff in high-risk categories.
Individuals in the high-risk categories are those
who are more likely to suffer complications from an
actual attack of the flu. Included in this group are
people with chronic pulmonary disease, such as
asthma or emphysema, heart disease, or other
chronic debilitating diseases, such as diabetes.
People in the high-risk group shoidd get the biva
lent variety vaccine against A-Victoria flu as well as
swine flu, and should also make arrangements
through Cowell to receive the monvalent B-Hong
Kong type, according to Dorothy Beaumont, im
munization nurse at Cowell.
Swine flu vaccine is grown in eggs, so individu
als who are allergic either to eggs or to chicken
protein should not receive the vaccine.
Three days a week
McCllenahan said that he envisions a program on
campus that will run two or three days a week for
several weeks. He estimates th.it as many as 20,000
to 25.000 people may receive inoculations, depend
ing on what percentage of the Stanford community
decides to participate.
McClenahan also mentioned that the campus
program will need nurse volunteers as well as vol
unteers without special training to "do screening,
help roll up sleeves, and comfort people who
faint."
