### Bob Svikhart 
Approximately 9b non
student security employes have
been hired for the 1976 football
season hereand they will be paid
an average of $7-9 per hour, ac
cording to Pete kmetovic, direc
tor of athletic operations.
"We used to have students
provide security about 15 years
ago." Kmetovic said, "but they
got too interested in the game.
We would only have one gate
open by the second half because
the students would go in and
watch the game."
In addition, 160 more
employes, predominately non
students, have been hired to aid
with the parking of cars. These

workers, who are generally
high-school students, are paid
the minimum wage of $2.30.
Kmetovic further reported that
the security force is the same size
as last year, but more "in
uniform" officials have been
hired. Cost of game security re
mained the same as last year.
Kmetovic said.
The force consists of 55
ticket-takers who wear red jac
kets and are off-duty members of
the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department. In addition, 12 on
duty sheriff's deputies and 17
members of the Richardson Sec
urity Service, Oakland, are pre
sent at the games. The on-duty
deputies are armed.

Richardson employes re
placed 17 ticket-takers to help al
leviate problems with drunken
ness and fighting encountered at
football games last year,
Kmetovic added.
"Everything seemed to go real
well at the San Jose game,"
Kmetovic said, "as we only had a
few problems with pickpoc
kets."
The security procedure is
complex, but generally, the on
duty deputies and Richardson
agents ring the field, while the
off-duty deputies take tickets
and then filter into the crowd to
help with problems.
