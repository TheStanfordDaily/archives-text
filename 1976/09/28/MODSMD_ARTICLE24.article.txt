# Tales of two rockers

Whatever happened to Bruce
Springsteen? Rock and rollers,
leather-jacketed poets, intellec
tual hoodlums, and readers of
Time and Newsweek, do not de
spair.
Springsteen, the golden boy of
Asbury Park.New Jersey, will be
roaring out of oblivion for two
shows in the Bay Area. A musi
cal legend for nearly a month
and a half, Bruce will be playing
the Paramount Theater in Oak
land this Saturday, October 2
and will play the next evening at
Leavey Center on the University
of Santa Clara campus.
Springsteen has been a favo
rite of rock intelligentsia for sev

eral years but he sprang to na
tional acclaim (and the covers of
Time and Newsweek) through a
combination of public relations,
media "hype," and talent.
His debut album on Columbia,
Greetings from Ash bury Park,
N.J. is evidence that Springs
teen's influences are less in the
singer-composer mold than in
the hot. blues- and pop-based re
cords of the '50s and '60s, speci
fically Elvis; the large,
percussion-crazy productions of
Phil Spector; and urban rhythm
and blues. Comparisons are gen
erally misleading, but if Spring
steen's music can be categorized
as anything at all it might be
termed "Elvis meets Dylan
under the boardwalk."

The combination of raw rock
musicianship, narrative devices
and unparalleled evocation of
atmosphere comes together with
tremendous force on The Wild,
The Innocent and the E Street
Shuffle, Springsteen's second
Columbia album.
The Wild, The Innocent and
the E Street Shuffle, named
one of the best albums ot H)74 by
Holling Stone, contains a series
of vignettes — observations of
characters and street life that add
up to a strong, romantic yet un
sentimental, personal vision.
The album includes
"Rosalita," an inspired variation
on a primal rock and roll theme;
"Incident on 57th Street," on
which Springsteen's dramatic
sense is particularly evident; the
moving "New York City
Serenade" ("Walk tall, man, or
don't walk at all"); and the swirl
ing "Kitty's Back."
Born To Hun is Springsteen's
third Columbia LP and the one
that should establish him in the
public eye as a major artist of our
time. Born To Bun fuses the in
fluences of such diverse artists
as Phil Spector. Sam and Dave,
Roy Orbison, Van Morrison and
Bob Dylan into a form which can
only be truly identified as pure
Springsteen.
Like only the very finest of our
artists, Bruce Springsteen has
built on the past without pander
ing to nostalgia or formula and
without cheapening memories
or painting a picture of the past
that never was. Through it all
there is an amazing innocence
that emerges through images of a
never-ending youth in which
truths art: discovered that are as
real today as they ever were: "It's
a town full of losers/ And I'm
pulling out of here to wi n," is not
an escape, it's the only honest
thing to do.

Whatever happened to Randy
Phillips? Rock and rollers and
other affluent teenagers, do not
despair. Phillips, the golden boy
of Mount Vernon, New York,
and the once omnipotent direc
tor of Stanford's ASSU Special
Events is still loitering around
the Bay Area entertainment
scene.
Phillips has moved on from
Stanford with his B.A. in Tele
phone Arts to the Law School of
the University of Santa Clara. Lo
and behold, Phillips has as
sumed a position at Santa Clara
which is identical to his Stan
ford job and will be putting on
concerts for the Associated Stu
dents of the University of Santa
Clara.
Phillip's first effort at his new
campus will be to present Bruce
Springsteen and the E Street
Band at Leavey Center on the
Santa Clara campus on Sunday,
October 3at 8 p.m. Leavey
Center is a 5500 seat indoor facil
ity which is about a 25 minute
drive from Stanford. "I see
shows at Leavey Center as a real
alternative for those who live on
the Peninsula," said Phillips.
"I hope to see a lot of Stanford
students down here."
Phillips speaks fondly of his
Stanford career. "We put on
some fine events at Stanford," he
said as a tear fell from his eye
onto the hood of his shiny 260 Z,
"but we hope to do just as well
down here."
Back at Stanford, David
Knowles has been chosen as the
new director of ASSU Special
Events. He has already
scheduled the legendary blue
grass musicians, Doc and Merle
Watson for two shows at Memo
rial Auditorium on Saturday,
October 30. Tickets are now on
sale at theTresidder ticket office.
