# Free-spirited Alice romps in X-rated Wonderland
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
The Queen of Hearts is a
painted lesbian. The White
Knight is a jealous homosexual.
The Black Knight is a rampaging
bisexual. The Mad Hatter is an
incurable flasher. Humpty
Dumpty is an impotent klutz.
And that's only a sampling of the
liberated cast of characters from
Bill Osco's X-rated version of
Lewis Carroll'sAJice In Wonder
land. Professor Mellor's Roman
tic and Victorian Literature was
never like this.
B. Anthony Frederick's
screenplay lifted the title,
characters and settings of the

sadistic children's story, but it
resembles the original in content
as much as David Harris politi
cally resembles Ronald Reagan.
It seems inspired more by
Penthouse Forum than by any
thing Lewis Carroll ever im
agined.
And as we all know, Lewis
Carroll had quite a vivid imagi
nation. He also liked to sketch
little girls in the nude (see, Pro
fessor, I was listening to all those
lectures).
In that sense. I suppose, Osco
and director Bud Townsend
have captured Carroll's basic
feelings about the female sex in

general. Lots of naked romping,
but very little touching. 1 think
this may also be a characteristic
of soft-core pornography. 1
wouldn't know, of course, be
cause 1 never, never, never go to
soft-core porno movies. Almost
never.
Bill Osco previously brought
us the X-rated Flesh Gordon, a
take-off on the Flash Gordon se
rials of the 19405. Alice is only
another step along his trail" of
sacreligious irreverence. His
message, blatantly placed bet
ween horny rocks and a continu
ally copulating Tweedledee and
Tweedledum, is that sex isn't

bud, that if it feels good, it is
good.
What this movie is, deep down
under everything else, is am
munition lor oversexed high
school boys to use to get their
less-than-promiscuous girl
friends to come across on
Saturday night.
The audience observes Alice's
progressive emotional and phys
ical deflowering, as she ad
vances from a wallflower libra
rian to a horny, experienced free
spirit. The sexually liberated
people innocent Alice meets in
Wonderland lead her to a smor
gasbord of carnal cavortings, be
ginning with self-exploration by
way of masturbation (tastefully
concealed off-camera) and end
ing with participation in an orgy
(tastelessly appearing on
camera).
Actually, this movie looks like
they filmed The /oy of Sex and
put it to music. Singing and
dancing abound among the
stripteases, and everything is so
offbeat that by the middle of the
film, nothing Osco and
Townsend deliver is surprising.
One accepts it with a perturbed
expression, wondering what
ever happened to the plot.
Alice is played by kristine
Deßell, who graced Playboy's
cover not too long ago — she was
the topless nymphet sitting in an
oversized rocking chair petul
antly clutching a teddy bear. Her
face has a child-like innocence
that fits Alice perfectly. Even
while learning the art of fellatio,
she's convincing.
So take the Black King's ad
vice (it's the same stuff Auntie
Mame gave you twenty years
ago) — live for the moment. But
don't complain to me when you
don't get into graduate school.
(Alice In Wonderland is now
playing at the Palo Alto Square
Theatre at the corner of El
Camino Real and Page Mill
Road.)

The White Rabbit beckons a pensive Alice into Wonderland from her narrow life as a
librarian. Alice, wondering if she grew up the correct way, decides to take a chance and
follows him. Of course, if she hadn't, there wouldn't have been a movie.
