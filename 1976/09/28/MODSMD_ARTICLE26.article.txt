Guerrillas want control of Rhodesia
Salisbury, Rhodesia—The leader of Rhodesian
black, guerrillas based in Mozambique said yester
day his forces should be given military control of
Rhodesia under the proposed transitional govern
ment leading to black majority rule.
Robert Mugabe, who claims to command some
10,000 guerrillas of the Zimbabwe People's Army
(ZIPA), said in an interview in Lusaka, the capital of
Zambia:
"There must be a disintegration of Prime Minis
ter lan Smith's military power. Our forces must
move in to replace the settler forces in Zimbabwe,
or else the proposals would bea sham and hollow."
At a summit meeting Sunday, the leaders of Tan
zania, Zambia, Mozambique, Angola and Botswana
— regarded as the "front line" states in the battle for
black majority rule in Rhodesia — also objected to
letting Smith set up the interim government, and
said they wanted Britain to convene a conference
outside Rhodesia for the purpose. The British im
mediately announced preparations for such a meet
ing.
Lawsuit drains NAACP funds
New York — Failure by the NAACP to raise $1.6
million by the end of the week for damages and
appeal bond in a Mississippi court case would have
"the effect of bankruptcy" for the civil rights or
ganization, an official said yesterday.
A hurry-up effort by the NAACP to raise the bond
money is still $850,000 short of the goal, and
Nathaniel Jones, chief counsel for the organization,
said officials are "hoping for some development"
in the courts that would give them more time.
The NAACP must post the bond to appeal the suit
won by 12 white merchants in Port Gibson. The
award stemmed from a 1966 boycott led by former
NAACP field director Charles Evers which the mer
chants claimed violated restraint of trade laws. The
merchants filed suit against Evers, the NAACP and
131 other individuals.
State law requires 126 percent bond — $1.6 mill
ion in this case — for appeal. The NAACP must post
it by Friday.
As an alternative to raising the money, Jones said,
the NAACP asked Chancery Court Judge George
I laynes in Mississippi to reduce or waive thebond,
order a new trial or reduce the damage award.
"Once he rules, we're prepared to go into state court
oi the U.S. Supreme Court to take whatever action
we can," he said.
An adverse ruling from the court, Jones said,
could mean "some heavy borrowing" from banks
by the NAACP.
Smallpox close to extinction
(ieneva, Switzerland — Seven persons in remote
Ethiopian desert villages are theonly persons in the

world known to have smallpox, and they may be
the last, the World Health Organization (WHO) said
yesterday. Only nine years ago the disease killed
two million.
Officials of the organization said the last cases of
the disease should be over in two months. Then, if
no new breakouts occur in two years' time, WHO
will declare the plague officially eradicated.
The last seven victims are in three villages iso
lated in the desert region of Bale, some 200 miles
south of Addis Ababa, WHO said. Hardly any one
travels there, and the disease has not spread. The
experts are confident it will not do so in its dying
stages.
Experience has shown that once eradicated the
disease does not reappear. But to make sure, WHO
will conduct an extensive surveillance, including a
house-to-house search in the three villages.
U.S. more dependent on oil imports
Washington — The nation's dependence on
foreign fuels continued to increase this year with
oil imports up 16.7 per cent in the first six months,
the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) says.
The findings, in FEA's latest monthly statistics,
coincided with published reports — denied by the
State Department — that Saudi Arabia was
threatening a new oil embargo if the U.S. Congress
adopts legislation unfavorable to the Arab
economic boycott of Israel.
Before the Arab nations interrupted oil ship
ments in 1973, the United States imported about 35
per cent of its petroleum. The import level was
about the same in early 1975.
But oil imports increased to more than 39 per
cent of U.S. petroleum demand in the first half of
this year, the FEA says.
Summing up its findings forthefirst halfof 1976,
the FEA came up with this picture of U.S. energy
supply and demand:
—Energy consumption for the first five months
was up 1.5 per cent, while U.S. energy production
for the first six months was down one per cent.
—Weighed against the U.S. consumption of
energy from all sources, imports of fossil fuels —
mainly oil and natural gas — provided about 20.3
per cent of total energy demand during the first five
months of 1976, compared with 18.3 per cent a year
earlier.
Drug agency chief hits courts
Miami Beach, Fla. — Judicial handling of narco
tics cases "makes a mockery of the serious concern
of the public about hard drug abuse," the head of
the federal Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) said yesterday.
Courts are allowing thousands of narcotics of
fenders to go free on low bond and short jail terms,
DEA Administrator Peter Bensinger told the Inter
national Association of Chiefs of Police.

He said a third of the almost 4000 persons con
victed on federal narcotics charges last year got
probation. And of course those sentenced to prison
on heroin or cocaine charges, "one out of three
received prison terms of three years or less."
"That means that of the 3960 individuals brought
into federal courts and convicted of narcotic
charges last year, over 2000 were back on the streets
immediately or eligible to return within a year," he
said.
Bensinger said the handling of drug cases has
created "a morale problem for the law enforcement
officers who find that the criminals they have
worked so hard to arrest are back out on the streets
before they have a chance to complete their paper
work."
Columnist Anderson sues Nixon
Washington — Newspaper columnist Jack An
derson filed a $22 million damage suit Monday
accusing former President Richard Nixon and 19
subordinates of conducting a concentrated five
year campaign to destroy Anderson's credibility
and take away his First Amendment rights as a
newsman.
Lawyers for Anderson said the suit is the first of
its kind.
The civil damage suit, filed in U.S. District Court,
cites 17 separate allegations of harassment, investi
gation, or surveillance by the White House inves
tigative unit known as the Plumbers or by the CIA.
The suit said the campaign included a tentative
plan by Watergate figures G. Gordon Liddy and E.
Howard Hunt to murder Anderson with an exotic
poison and a comprehensive surveillance by CIA
agents who allegedly followed the columnist, his
wife and children seven days a week for several
months in 1972.
At a news conference, Anderson said any pro
ceeds from the suit would go for the benefit of other
reporters' First Amendment rights.
Of the alleged campaign against him, Anderson
said, "This is probably the first time in the history
of the United States there has been such a concen
trated effort to destroy a single newsman."
Alston calls it quits
Los Angeles — Walter Alston, manager of the Los
Angeles Dodgers the past 23 seasons and dean of
major league baseball pilots, announced yesterday
he will retire at the end of this season.
There was no immediate announcement as to his
successor, although coach Tom LaSorda has been
mentioned prominently.
Today's weather
Cloudy with rain likely today. Chance of showers
tonight and tomorrow. Lows tonight in the mid 50s
to low 60s. Highs in the upper 60s to mid 70s.
Southerly winds increasing to 15 to 25 miles per
hour.

"the effect of bankruptcy" for the civil rights or
ganization, an official said yesterday.
A hurry-up effort by the NAACP to raise the bond
money is still $850,000 short of the goal, and
Nathaniel Jones, chief counsel for the organization,
said officials are "hoping for some development"
in the courts that would give them more time.
The NAACP must post the bond to appeal the suit
won by 12 white merchants in Port Gibson. The
award stemmed from a 1966 boycott led by former
NAACP field director Charles Evers which the mer
chants claimed violated restraint of trade laws. The
merchants filed suit against Evers, the NAACP and
131 other individuals.
State law requires 126 percent bond — $1.6 mill
ion in this case — for appeal. The NAACP must post
it by Friday.
As an alternative to raising the money, Jones said,
the NAACP asked Chancery Court Judge George
I laynes in Mississippi to reduce or waive thebond,
order a new trial or reduce the damage award.
"Once he rules, we're prepared to go into state court
oi the U.S. Supreme Court to take whatever action
we can," he said.
An adverse ruling from the court, Jones said,
could mean "some heavy borrowing" from banks
by the NAACP.
Smallpox close to extinction
(ieneva, Switzerland — Seven persons in remote
Ethiopian desert villages are theonly persons in the

world known to have smallpox, and they may be
the last, the World Health Organization (WHO) said
yesterday. Only nine years ago the disease killed
two million.
Officials of the organization said the last cases of
the disease should be over in two months. Then, if
no new breakouts occur in two years' time, WHO
will declare the plague officially eradicated.
The last seven victims are in three villages iso
lated in the desert region of Bale, some 200 miles
south of Addis Ababa, WHO said. Hardly any one
travels there, and the disease has not spread. The
experts are confident it will not do so in its dying
stages.
Experience has shown that once eradicated the
disease does not reappear. But to make sure, WHO
will conduct an extensive surveillance, including a
house-to-house search in the three villages.
U.S. more dependent on oil imports
Washington — The nation's dependence on
foreign fuels continued to increase this year with
oil imports up 16.7 per cent in the first six months,
the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) says.
The findings, in FEA's latest monthly statistics,
coincided with published reports — denied by the
State Department — that Saudi Arabia was
threatening a new oil embargo if the U.S. Congress
adopts legislation unfavorable to the Arab
economic boycott of Israel.
Before the Arab nations interrupted oil ship
ments in 1973, the United States imported about 35
per cent of its petroleum. The import level was
about the same in early 1975.
But oil imports increased to more than 39 per
cent of U.S. petroleum demand in the first half of
this year, the FEA says.
Summing up its findings forthefirst halfof 1976,
the FEA came up with this picture of U.S. energy
supply and demand:
—Energy consumption for the first five months
was up 1.5 per cent, while U.S. energy production
for the first six months was down one per cent.
—Weighed against the U.S. consumption of
energy from all sources, imports of fossil fuels —
mainly oil and natural gas — provided about 20.3
per cent of total energy demand during the first five
months of 1976, compared with 18.3 per cent a year
earlier.
Drug agency chief hits courts
Miami Beach, Fla. — Judicial handling of narco
tics cases "makes a mockery of the serious concern
of the public about hard drug abuse," the head of
the federal Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) said yesterday.
Courts are allowing thousands of narcotics of
fenders to go free on low bond and short jail terms,
DEA Administrator Peter Bensinger told the Inter
national Association of Chiefs of Police.

He said a third of the almost 4000 persons con
victed on federal narcotics charges last year got
probation. And of course those sentenced to prison
on heroin or cocaine charges, "one out of three
received prison terms of three years or less."
"That means that of the 3960 individuals brought
into federal courts and convicted of narcotic
charges last year, over 2000 were back on the streets
immediately or eligible to return within a year," he
said.
Bensinger said the handling of drug cases has
created "a morale problem for the law enforcement
officers who find that the criminals they have
worked so hard to arrest are back out on the streets
before they have a chance to complete their paper
work."
Columnist Anderson sues Nixon
Washington — Newspaper columnist Jack An
derson filed a $22 million damage suit Monday
accusing former President Richard Nixon and 19
subordinates of conducting a concentrated five
year campaign to destroy Anderson's credibility
and take away his First Amendment rights as a
newsman.
Lawyers for Anderson said the suit is the first of
its kind.
The civil damage suit, filed in U.S. District Court,
cites 17 separate allegations of harassment, investi
gation, or surveillance by the White House inves
tigative unit known as the Plumbers or by the CIA.
The suit said the campaign included a tentative
plan by Watergate figures G. Gordon Liddy and E.
Howard Hunt to murder Anderson with an exotic
poison and a comprehensive surveillance by CIA
agents who allegedly followed the columnist, his
wife and children seven days a week for several
months in 1972.
At a news conference, Anderson said any pro
ceeds from the suit would go for the benefit of other
reporters' First Amendment rights.
Of the alleged campaign against him, Anderson
said, "This is probably the first time in the history
of the United States there has been such a concen
trated effort to destroy a single newsman."

Guerrillas want control of Rhodesia
Salisbury, Rhodesia—The leader of Rhodesian
black, guerrillas based in Mozambique said yester
day his forces should be given military control of
Rhodesia under the proposed transitional govern

Robert Mugabe, who claims to command some
10,000 guerrillas of the Zimbabwe People's Army
(ZIPA), said in an interview in Lusaka, the capital of
Zambia:
"There must be a disintegration of Prime Minis
ter lan Smith's military power. Our forces must
move in to replace the settler forces in Zimbabwe,
or else the proposals would bea sham and hollow."
At a summit meeting Sunday, the leaders of Tan
zania, Zambia, Mozambique, Angola and Botswana
— regarded as the "front line" states in the battle for
black majority rule in Rhodesia — also objected to
letting Smith set up the interim government, and
said they wanted Britain to convene a conference
outside Rhodesia for the purpose. The British im
mediately announced preparations for such a meet

Smallpox close to extinction
(ieneva, Switzerland — Seven persons in remote
Ethiopian desert villages are theonly persons in the

world known to have smallpox, and they may be
the last, the World Health Organization (WHO) said
yesterday. Only nine years ago the disease killed
two million.
Officials of the organization said the last cases of
the disease should be over in two months. Then, if
no new breakouts occur in two years' time, WHO
will declare the plague officially eradicated.
The last seven victims are in three villages iso
lated in the desert region of Bale, some 200 miles
south of Addis Ababa, WHO said. Hardly any one
travels there, and the disease has not spread. The
experts are confident it will not do so in its dying
stages.
Experience has shown that once eradicated the
disease does not reappear. But to make sure, WHO
will conduct an extensive surveillance, including a
house-to-house search in the three villages.
U.S. more dependent on oil imports
Washington — The nation's dependence on
foreign fuels continued to increase this year with
oil imports up 16.7 per cent in the first six months,
the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) says.
The findings, in FEA's latest monthly statistics,
coincided with published reports — denied by the
State Department — that Saudi Arabia was
threatening a new oil embargo if the U.S. Congress
adopts legislation unfavorable to the Arab
economic boycott of Israel.
Before the Arab nations interrupted oil ship
ments in 1973, the United States imported about 35
per cent of its petroleum. The import level was
about the same in early 1975.
But oil imports increased to more than 39 per
cent of U.S. petroleum demand in the first half of
this year, the FEA says.
Summing up its findings forthefirst halfof 1976,
the FEA came up with this picture of U.S. energy
supply and demand:
—Energy consumption for the first five months
was up 1.5 per cent, while U.S. energy production
for the first six months was down one per cent.
—Weighed against the U.S. consumption of
energy from all sources, imports of fossil fuels —
mainly oil and natural gas — provided about 20.3
per cent of total energy demand during the first five
months of 1976, compared with 18.3 per cent a year
earlier.
Drug agency chief hits courts
Miami Beach, Fla. — Judicial handling of narco
tics cases "makes a mockery of the serious concern
of the public about hard drug abuse," the head of
the federal Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) said yesterday.
Courts are allowing thousands of narcotics of
fenders to go free on low bond and short jail terms,
DEA Administrator Peter Bensinger told the Inter
national Association of Chiefs of Police.

He said a third of the almost 4000 persons con
victed on federal narcotics charges last year got
probation. And of course those sentenced to prison
on heroin or cocaine charges, "one out of three
received prison terms of three years or less."
"That means that of the 3960 individuals brought
into federal courts and convicted of narcotic
charges last year, over 2000 were back on the streets
immediately or eligible to return within a year," he
said.
Bensinger said the handling of drug cases has
created "a morale problem for the law enforcement
officers who find that the criminals they have
worked so hard to arrest are back out on the streets
before they have a chance to complete their paper
work."
Columnist Anderson sues Nixon
Washington — Newspaper columnist Jack An
derson filed a $22 million damage suit Monday
accusing former President Richard Nixon and 19
subordinates of conducting a concentrated five
year campaign to destroy Anderson's credibility
and take away his First Amendment rights as a
newsman.
Lawyers for Anderson said the suit is the first of
its kind.
The civil damage suit, filed in U.S. District Court,
cites 17 separate allegations of harassment, investi
gation, or surveillance by the White House inves
tigative unit known as the Plumbers or by the CIA.
The suit said the campaign included a tentative
plan by Watergate figures G. Gordon Liddy and E.
Howard Hunt to murder Anderson with an exotic
poison and a comprehensive surveillance by CIA
agents who allegedly followed the columnist, his
wife and children seven days a week for several
months in 1972.
At a news conference, Anderson said any pro
ceeds from the suit would go for the benefit of other
reporters' First Amendment rights.
Of the alleged campaign against him, Anderson
said, "This is probably the first time in the history
of the United States there has been such a concen
trated effort to destroy a single newsman."

Guerrillas want control of Rhodesia
Salisbury, Rhodesia—The leader of Rhodesian
black, guerrillas based in Mozambique said yester
day his forces should be given military control of
Rhodesia under the proposed transitional govern
ment leading to black majority rule.
Robert Mugabe, who claims to command some
10,000 guerrillas of the Zimbabwe People's Army
(ZIPA), said in an interview in Lusaka, the capital of
Zambia:
"There must be a disintegration of Prime Minis
ter lan Smith's military power. Our forces must
move in to replace the settler forces in Zimbabwe,
or else the proposals would bea sham and hollow."
At a summit meeting Sunday, the leaders of Tan
zania, Zambia, Mozambique, Angola and Botswana
— regarded as the "front line" states in the battle for
black majority rule in Rhodesia — also objected to
letting Smith set up the interim government, and
said they wanted Britain to convene a conference
outside Rhodesia for the purpose. The British im
mediately announced preparations for such a meet
ing.
Lawsuit drains NAACP funds
New York — Failure by the NAACP to raise $1.6
million by the end of the week for damages and
appeal bond in a Mississippi court case would have
"the effect of bankruptcy" for the civil rights or
ganization, an official said yesterday.
A hurry-up effort by the NAACP to raise the bond
money is still $850,000 short of the goal, and
Nathaniel Jones, chief counsel for the organization,
said officials are "hoping for some development"
in the courts that would give them more time.
The NAACP must post the bond to appeal the suit
won by 12 white merchants in Port Gibson. The
award stemmed from a 1966 boycott led by former
NAACP field director Charles Evers which the mer
chants claimed violated restraint of trade laws. The
merchants filed suit against Evers, the NAACP and
131 other individuals.
State law requires 126 percent bond — $1.6 mill
ion in this case — for appeal. The NAACP must post
it by Friday.
As an alternative to raising the money, Jones said,
the NAACP asked Chancery Court Judge George
I laynes in Mississippi to reduce or waive thebond,
order a new trial or reduce the damage award.
"Once he rules, we're prepared to go into state court
oi the U.S. Supreme Court to take whatever action
we can," he said.
An adverse ruling from the court, Jones said,
could mean "some heavy borrowing" from banks
by the NAACP.

oil imports up 16.7 per cent in the first six months,
the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) says.
The findings, in FEA's latest monthly statistics,
coincided with published reports — denied by the
State Department — that Saudi Arabia was
threatening a new oil embargo if the U.S. Congress
adopts legislation unfavorable to the Arab
economic boycott of Israel.
Before the Arab nations interrupted oil ship
ments in 1973, the United States imported about 35
per cent of its petroleum. The import level was
about the same in early 1975.
But oil imports increased to more than 39 per
cent of U.S. petroleum demand in the first half of
this year, the FEA says.
Summing up its findings forthefirst halfof 1976,
the FEA came up with this picture of U.S. energy
supply and demand:
—Energy consumption for the first five months
was up 1.5 per cent, while U.S. energy production
for the first six months was down one per cent.
—Weighed against the U.S. consumption of
energy from all sources, imports of fossil fuels —
mainly oil and natural gas — provided about 20.3
per cent of total energy demand during the first five
months of 1976, compared with 18.3 per cent a year
earlier.
Drug agency chief hits courts
Miami Beach, Fla. — Judicial handling of narco
tics cases "makes a mockery of the serious concern
of the public about hard drug abuse," the head of
the federal Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) said yesterday.
Courts are allowing thousands of narcotics of
fenders to go free on low bond and short jail terms,
DEA Administrator Peter Bensinger told the Inter
national Association of Chiefs of Police.

He said a third of the almost 4000 persons con
victed on federal narcotics charges last year got
probation. And of course those sentenced to prison
on heroin or cocaine charges, "one out of three
received prison terms of three years or less."
"That means that of the 3960 individuals brought
into federal courts and convicted of narcotic
charges last year, over 2000 were back on the streets
immediately or eligible to return within a year," he
said.
Bensinger said the handling of drug cases has
created "a morale problem for the law enforcement
officers who find that the criminals they have
worked so hard to arrest are back out on the streets
before they have a chance to complete their paper
work."
Columnist Anderson sues Nixon
Washington — Newspaper columnist Jack An
derson filed a $22 million damage suit Monday
accusing former President Richard Nixon and 19
subordinates of conducting a concentrated five
year campaign to destroy Anderson's credibility
and take away his First Amendment rights as a
newsman.
Lawyers for Anderson said the suit is the first of
its kind.
The civil damage suit, filed in U.S. District Court,
cites 17 separate allegations of harassment, investi
gation, or surveillance by the White House inves
tigative unit known as the Plumbers or by the CIA.
The suit said the campaign included a tentative
plan by Watergate figures G. Gordon Liddy and E.
Howard Hunt to murder Anderson with an exotic
poison and a comprehensive surveillance by CIA
agents who allegedly followed the columnist, his
wife and children seven days a week for several
months in 1972.
At a news conference, Anderson said any pro
ceeds from the suit would go for the benefit of other
reporters' First Amendment rights.
Of the alleged campaign against him, Anderson
said, "This is probably the first time in the history
of the United States there has been such a concen
trated effort to destroy a single newsman."
