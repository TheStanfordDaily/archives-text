### 
In a meeting that extended into the
early morning hours, the Palo Alto
City Council approved with one
abstention the merger of the Stanford
University and City of Palo Alto Fire
Departments, effective Oct. 1.
The merger, which has been re
searched and negotiated for more than
two years, will save Palo Alto and
Stanford an estimated $3 million over
seven years.

Byron Sher, city council member
and Stanford law professor, excused
himself from participating in the vot
ing.
In other action, the city council ap
proved unanimously stringent licens
ing of adult-oriented establishments
(massage parlors, adult bookstores and
adult movie houses) and the phasing
out of any establishments which do
not conform to the newly enacted or
dinance.
