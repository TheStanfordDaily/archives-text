# ARLO receives government grant
## 
### Sean Murphy 
Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) has received a federal grant
of $47,875 from the U.S. Office of
Education.
ARLO, under the co-direction of
Edith Eddy and Bill Leland, is an
independent organization linking
Stanford academic resources to
community agency needs by pro
viding student volunteer re
searchers.
"We are delighted and consider it
a strong endorsement. These grants
are only given to those programs
that are truly innovative," Leland
said.
The allocation came from the
$11.5 million Fund for the Im
provement of Fostsecondary Edu
cation. ARLO was one of 97 organi
zations granted support out of a
total of 2000 applicants.
Eddy said the grant would allow
ARLO to improve its services. "We
will be able to significantly expand
the quality of our office as a liaison.

It will enable us to increase our out
reach into the community and to
better publicize ourselves on cam
pus.
"Most importantly we will be
able to hire another staff member to
help us coordinate the more than 60
projects we'll have this year," she
said.
ARLO was conceived and or
ganized by students here in 1973 in
cooperation with faculty, staff and
community representatives. It re
ceived the official sponsorship of
the ASSU the following year.
Students, individuals, founda
tions and other sources raised
$39,600 to maintain ARLO from its
inception to this September.
ARLO projects are accommo
dated within established courses
and seminars, conducted as inde
pendent study, or developed as of
ferings within special programs.
They average about two quarters in
duration.
