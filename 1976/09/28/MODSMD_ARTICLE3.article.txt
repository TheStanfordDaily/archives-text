# Carter attacks poverty; Ford urges law, order
## 
### 
Portland, Ore. (AP) â€” Democratic
presidential candidate Jimmy Carter
said yesterday that President Ford's
economic policies placed a record 2.5
million Americans below the official
poverty line last year and have created
a new class of poor to whom the
American dream has been denied.
Campaigning by boat in Portland's
deepwater harbor and with speeches,
rallies and impromptu news confer
ences, the Democratic candidate
pledged that if elected president, he
would never increase taxes on Ameri
cans who work for a living, or whose
major source of income comes from
wages and salaries rather than interest,
dividends and capital gains.
It was an assertion that Carter has
made repeatedly in efforts to clarify
statements he made concerning taxes
in an Associated Press interview more
than a week ago.
In that interview he indicated he
would seek to raise taxes for everyone
above the mean or median income. But
when reminded that the median was
somewhere around $12,000, he said he
could not fix a level at which an in
crease would be sought.
President Cerald Ford meanwhile
shifted the focus of his campaign to
law and order and gun control as he
wound up athree-day tour through the
Deep South.
Ford pledged in Miami yesterday
thata crusadeagainst crime, including
a drive to jail career criminals and
"violent and street-wise" youthful of

fenders, would keynote the first 100
days of .a new term if he wins the elec
tion.
Ford said the voters should and will
check their ballots Nov. 2 "and iden
tify those candidates who ha\ de
monstrated indifference or'permis
siveness toward crime. . .
Ford's Miami appearance closed out
his three-day campaign swing through
Democratic presidential candidate
Jimmy Carter's home territory, the
Deep South, and he was to return to
Washington late yesterday.
In a stern law-and-order speech to
more than 2000 policemen, Ford ac
cused Congress of inaction on his own
crime-fighting proposals and said:
"1 serve notice today that a top prior
ity of the first 100 days,beginning with
Inauguration Day for the Ford ad
ministration next january, will be the
rallying of America behind federal an
ticrime legislation."
Ford's speech to the International
Association of Chiefs of Police was in
tune with the conservative line he has
espoused during the three days of
campaigning in Southern states.
The President skipped one issue he
had pressed in four Sunday appear
ances along the Mississippi Culf
Coast, where he repeatedly declared
his opposition to federal gun registra
tion. He said all law-abiding citizens
should have the right to keep firearms
for their own protection and should
not be required to register guns if they
want to go hunting.
