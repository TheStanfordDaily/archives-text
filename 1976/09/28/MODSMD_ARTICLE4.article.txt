# Committee says TAs need more supervision

### Emily Sachar 
After surveying teaching assistant
(TA) practices within the School of
Humanities and Sciences last year, a
university subcommittee determined
that academic departments should pay
greater attention to the supervision
and training of their TAs.
While practices vary greatly among
departments, tin? subcommittee on the
evaluation of teaching of the Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement indicated several ways
supervision could he improved.
"TAs serve an important teaching
role in the university and adequate
preparation is essential. Regrettably, it
is not unknown for a freshman to have
a discussion section ora lab taught by a
first-year graduate student with little
advance knowledge of his duties or re
sponsibilities." the subcommittee re
ported.
By making one faculty member in
each department responsible for both
administrative matters and educa
tional policies for TAs. TAs could
function more effectively in the clas
sroom. the subcommittee stated
They also suggested that TAs re
ceive prior careful orientation and
guidance throughout a particular

course while continuing to evaluate
and improve teaching skills.
Several departments have intro
duced their own programs to establish
efficient TA practices within courses.
In the history department, for exam
ple. all TAs must take a teaching class.
They also watch video tapes of their
teaching or leading a study section and
criticize each other's performance.
Content of the courses is specifically
worked out between professor and TA.
History Prof. Dorothy Atkinson said,
however, "what is good in one (de
partment) is not necessarily beneficial
in another. In order to solve the prob
lem. there must be good flexibility and
effort within the specific depart
ments."
Students are most likely to acquire
teaching skills in departments that
value good teaching not only by fa
culty but also by TAs, the subcommit
tee reported, adding that they were
impressed by such techniques as
team-teaching by both professor and
TA and regular meetings to discuss
common problems of teaching.
"In some cases, faculty or other TAs
regularly visit the TA's sections or
classes, with subsequent consultations
and suggestions for improvement."
