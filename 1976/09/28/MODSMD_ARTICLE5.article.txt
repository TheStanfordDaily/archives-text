# Prop. 14 insures farmworkers' rights
## 
### 
Sue Anderson

Here's a good reason to go to the
polls this November, if you can't think
of any other: Prop. 14, the Farmworker
Free Election Law, giving farmworkers
their choice of union representation
through secret ballot elections.
Farmworkers are the only workers in
the nation not covered by the National
Labor Relations Act, guaranteeing
workers the right to vote in union elec
tions. Farmworkers have no choice in
deciding which union they want.
In May, 1975, Gov. Edmund G.
Brown, Jr. proposed the California Ag
ricultural Labor Relations Act, with a
board to implement the law. This act
allowed workers on their ranches to
petition for an election to choose their
union, guaranteeing them freedom of
choice. The board certified each elec
tion.
Last fall, as the elections proceeded,
California farmworkers voted by a
three-to-one margin for the United
Farmworkers' Union (UFW). For the
first time in history, agricultural work
ers had secret ballot voting rights that
most of us take for granted.
November initiative
When funding for the board was cut
off in February, 1976, a petition drive
succeeded in putting the ALRA on the
November ballot as an initiative.
Prop. 14 also allows union organiz
ers onto the ranches to talk to the
workers before and after work and dur-

ing lunch breaks but at no other time to
avoid interference in the work
schedule. In this way, workers can
learn about the UFW as well as the
Teamsters Union and decide for them
selves which union they want.
Prop. 14 has been endorsed by
Jimmy Carter, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-
Calif.), Sen. John Tunney (D-Calif.),
Brown, Mayor George Moscone of San
Francisco and David Harris, Democra
tic contender for the 12th Congres
sional District seat, among others.
At the moment, no farmworker elec
tions are being held because there is no
board to certify them. The proposition
will provide for automatic funding of
the board each fiscal year, guarante
eing that farmworkers will not be left
with their civil rights unprotected, as
is the situation today.
Justice
We must get Prop. 14 passed this
November if we believe in justice for
those who harvest the food we eat.
If you want to see the initiative pass,
show your support for farmworkers',
rights by attending a UFW support
rally, featuring Dolores Huerta, in
White Plaza at noon Thursday.
Your help is greatly needed. Si se
puede (it can be done!).

Here's a good reason to go to the
polls this November, if you can't think
of any other: Prop. 14, the Farmworker
Free Election Law, giving farmworkers
their choice of union representation
through secret ballot elections.
Farmworkers are the only workers in
the nation not covered by the National
Labor Relations Act, guaranteeing
workers the right to vote in union elec
tions. Farmworkers have no choice in
deciding which union they want.
In May, 1975, Gov. Edmund G.
Brown, Jr. proposed the California Ag
ricultural Labor Relations Act, with a
board to implement the law. This act
allowed workers on their ranches to
petition for an election to choose their
union, guaranteeing them freedom of
choice. The board certified each elec
tion.
Last fall, as the elections proceeded,
California farmworkers voted by a
three-to-one margin for the United
Farmworkers' Union (UFW). For the
first time in history, agricultural work
ers had secret ballot voting rights that
most of us take for granted.
November initiative
When funding for the board was cut
off in February, 1976, a petition drive
succeeded in putting the ALRA on the
November ballot as an initiative.
Prop. 14 also allows union organiz
ers onto the ranches to talk to the
workers before and after work and dur-

ing lunch breaks but at no other time to
avoid interference in the work
schedule. In this way, workers can
learn about the UFW as well as the
Teamsters Union and decide for them
selves which union they want.
Prop. 14 has been endorsed by
Jimmy Carter, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-
Calif.), Sen. John Tunney (D-Calif.),
Brown, Mayor George Moscone of San
Francisco and David Harris, Democra
tic contender for the 12th Congres
sional District seat, among others.
At the moment, no farmworker elec
tions are being held because there is no
board to certify them. The proposition
will provide for automatic funding of
the board each fiscal year, guarante
eing that farmworkers will not be left
with their civil rights unprotected, as
is the situation today.
Justice
We must get Prop. 14 passed this
November if we believe in justice for
those who harvest the food we eat.
If you want to see the initiative pass,
show your support for farmworkers',
rights by attending a UFW support
rally, featuring Dolores Huerta, in
White Plaza at noon Thursday.
Your help is greatly needed. Si se
puede (it can be done!).
