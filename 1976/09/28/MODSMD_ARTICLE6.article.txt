The official finding of the Warren
Commission that Lee Harvey Oswald
was a homicidal "loner" may soon be
replaced by a new line — that Oswald
was under the "influence" of Fidel
Castro or his intelligence service. But a
close look at the key source of this new
hypothesis raises serious questions
about its accuracy and the motives of
its proponents.
The Castro link, originally
suggested soon after the JFK assassina
tion by a number of anti-Castro sources
close to the CIA. resurfaced last year in
a memo from a CIA consultant to the
Rockefeller Commission investigating
the CIA. The consultant. Ray Rocca,
had earlier served as the CIA liason to
the Warren Commission.
Rocca's memo concludes that the
Warren Commission report should
have left a "wider window" for the
contingency of a foreign conspiracy
and that Oswald had been influenced
by his "handling and stay in the Soviet
Union and his contacts in Mexico
City."
One member of Sen. Church's Se
nate Select Committee on Intelligence,
Robert Morgan (D-N.C.), has already
stated bluntly that he believes that
"John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assas
sinated bv Fidel Castro or someone

under his influence in retaliation for
our efforts to assassinate him."
And the Rocca memo has been
prominent in a spate of newspaper
stories. The Associated Press (AP) has
referred to the memo's "promising
leads" which, according to the memo,
"must be considered of great signifi
cance in an investigating a possible
foreign conspiracy" but were not fol
lowed up.
But in fact these so-called promising
leads were old speculations or uncor
roborated claims that the Warren
Commission had already considered
and rejected.
Many serious students of the Warren
Commission agree that Oswald was an
agent of some private or public intelli
gence agency. But they argue that the
agency was probably not foreign.
The new wave of Oswald stories
may at last establish what critics like
Sylvia Meagher have long claimed —
that Oswald was an intelligence agent.
But the irregularities they point up —
plus the continuing false leads — raise
more questions than answers about
who Oswald was working for.
