# Corporate interests dictate U.S. policy

### 
The arrangement of a "settlement" to the major
ity vs. white rule standoff in Rhodesia (a.k.a. Zim
babwe) may provide a classic example of American
interventionist foreign policy in action.
Hailed in some quarters as a triumph of diplo
macy by Henry Kissinger, the notorious interna
tional schemer, the plan accepted by Rhodesian
Prime Minister lan Smith is actually a bail out of
doomed white colonialists by American taxpayers.
In truth, the four percent European population
which has governed Rhodesia for 50 years is but a
minor factor in the overall foreign policy scenario.
Its receipt of the proposed subsidy serves only to
focus on the audacity of American diplomacy.
Real forces
Instead, one must look beyond the immediate
quid pro quo bringing black rule to Rhodesia to see
the real forces at work in shaping U.S. policy.
The United States has maintained an outward
coldness toward Smith's regime ever since it de
clared its independence from British colonial rule
11 years ago. For many of those years, the United
States participated in a British-UN sponsored
boycott of Rhodesian exports, a move which forced
the United States to acquire chromium ore from the
Soviet Union.
Thus American policy has never been outwardly
designed to aid the independent white rulers of
Rhodesia. (One might argue that neither was it de
signed to further the cause of black rule, but instead
to perpetuate British sovereignty.)
Western interests
Why then did Kissinger on August 2 affiliate the
United States with British Prime Minister James
Callaghan's proposal to guarantee the wealth of
Rhodesian whites in return for their acceptance of
black rule?
A major reason, the Wall Street Journal reported
Friday, is that Kissinger "feared that lengthy wars
in southern Africa would radicalize politics across
the continent and damage Western interests there
(my emphasis)."
One need only look at Kissinger's earlier fiasco in
Angola, in which the United States supported a
collection of rapist-bandits who were supposedly

"our friends" in a battle for control of the former
Portuguese colony.
Indeed, as it turned out, many of the American
sycophants in Angola were ideologically no diffe
rent from the Marxists who triumphed when the
forces of Russian-Cuban imperialism defeated
those of American imperialism.
Corporate aims
From that sorry episode we can infer that the
basis for American actions in Rhodesia is not an
ethical one, but rather a desire to further the aims of
the corporate statists who have governed the Un
ited States during this century.

It is thus in the "Western interest" to see that the
obstinacy of Rhodesian whites does not lead to a
takeover of that country (and later, South Africa) by
foreign-backed guerrillas in Mozambique, Tan
zania and Zambia.
The real concern of the Henry Kissingers and
James Callaghans is not white rule or black rule, but
continued hegemony over the region by the corpo
rate states. This is why the United States, Britain,
South Africa, France and West Germany are pre
pared to pour $2 billion in tax money into Rhodesia
as economic aid to a black-majority government
and as compensation for whites whose wealth is
confiscated.
Apart from all the maneuverings of foreign pow
ers is the question of justice inside of Rhodesia.
Ironically, this is as it should be, though for a reason
far different from the mercantilist aims of the major
powers.
White colonialism
A half-century of white rule has reaped a harvest
not unlike that of colonialism elsewhere, including

that foisted upon the American Indian.
Blacks have been displaced and swindled, rele
gated to poverty amidst an oasis of wealth in Africa.
And yet, as Hoover Institution Fellow L.H. Gann
pointed out in a July Los Angeles Times article,
Rhodesian blacks are better off now than ever (and
indeed live better than blacks in many majority
ruled African nations), while the country is better
managed, more prosperous and freer of despotic
terror than most developing countries around the
world.
So what is the just solution to the internal predi
cament of Rhodesia? Whatever it is, one thing
should be certain: it is no concern of the American
taxpayer.
Secured wealth
Why then are we to be taxed to secure the wealth
of Rhodesian colonialists? Economist Murray
Rothbard, writing in Reason magazine on the An
golan caper, supplies a reason and a substitute for
such interventionism:
"The major poi nt is that there are really no 'coun
tries' in all of Africa, in any genuine sense. The
'countries' were purely administrative creatures of
Western imperialism — British, French, Spanish,
Belgian and Portuguese — and they incorporated,
as well as cut through, the true national entities in
Africa, the particular tribes.
"Western imperialism dictated to these tribes in
newly expanded capital cities, which performed a
state-building and despotic function, and when
leaving, the Western countries simply turned the
state apparatus over to a Western-trained urban
elite, ready to assume rule on their own.
"If outside hands are kept off, all of these 'countries'
would rapidly disintegrate into their natural tribal
units. But to keep hands off, the U.S. would have to
abandon its post-World War II foreign policy of
propping up 'stable' existing centralized states
throughout the globe.
"Certainly, there is no rational excuse whatever for
American intervention in the African continent."

tional schemer, the plan accepted by Rhodesian
Prime Minister lan Smith is actually a bail out of
doomed white colonialists by American taxpayers.
In truth, the four percent European population
which has governed Rhodesia for 50 years is but a
minor factor in the overall foreign policy scenario.
Its receipt of the proposed subsidy serves only to
focus on the audacity of American diplomacy.
Real forces
Instead, one must look beyond the immediate
quid pro quo bringing black rule to Rhodesia to see
the real forces at work in shaping U.S. policy.
The United States has maintained an outward
coldness toward Smith's regime ever since it de
clared its independence from British colonial rule
11 years ago. For many of those years, the United
States participated in a British-UN sponsored
boycott of Rhodesian exports, a move which forced
the United States to acquire chromium ore from the
Soviet Union.
Thus American policy has never been outwardly
designed to aid the independent white rulers of
Rhodesia. (One might argue that neither was it de
signed to further the cause of black rule, but instead
to perpetuate British sovereignty.)
Western interests
Why then did Kissinger on August 2 affiliate the
United States with British Prime Minister James
Callaghan's proposal to guarantee the wealth of
Rhodesian whites in return for their acceptance of
black rule?
A major reason, the Wall Street Journal reported
Friday, is that Kissinger "feared that lengthy wars
in southern Africa would radicalize politics across
the continent and damage Western interests there
(my emphasis)."
One need only look at Kissinger's earlier fiasco in
Angola, in which the United States supported a
collection of rapist-bandits who were supposedly

"our friends" in a battle for control of the former
Portuguese colony.
Indeed, as it turned out, many of the American
sycophants in Angola were ideologically no diffe
rent from the Marxists who triumphed when the
forces of Russian-Cuban imperialism defeated
those of American imperialism.
Corporate aims
From that sorry episode we can infer that the
basis for American actions in Rhodesia is not an
ethical one, but rather a desire to further the aims of
the corporate statists who have governed the Un
ited States during this century.

It is thus in the "Western interest" to see that the
obstinacy of Rhodesian whites does not lead to a
takeover of that country (and later, South Africa) by
foreign-backed guerrillas in Mozambique, Tan
zania and Zambia.
The real concern of the Henry Kissingers and
James Callaghans is not white rule or black rule, but
continued hegemony over the region by the corpo
rate states. This is why the United States, Britain,
South Africa, France and West Germany are pre
pared to pour $2 billion in tax money into Rhodesia
as economic aid to a black-majority government
and as compensation for whites whose wealth is
confiscated.
Apart from all the maneuverings of foreign pow
ers is the question of justice inside of Rhodesia.
Ironically, this is as it should be, though for a reason
far different from the mercantilist aims of the major
powers.
White colonialism
A half-century of white rule has reaped a harvest
not unlike that of colonialism elsewhere, including

that foisted upon the American Indian.
Blacks have been displaced and swindled, rele
gated to poverty amidst an oasis of wealth in Africa.
And yet, as Hoover Institution Fellow L.H. Gann
pointed out in a July Los Angeles Times article,
Rhodesian blacks are better off now than ever (and
indeed live better than blacks in many majority
ruled African nations), while the country is better
managed, more prosperous and freer of despotic
terror than most developing countries around the
world.
So what is the just solution to the internal predi
cament of Rhodesia? Whatever it is, one thing
should be certain: it is no concern of the American
taxpayer.
Secured wealth
Why then are we to be taxed to secure the wealth
of Rhodesian colonialists? Economist Murray
Rothbard, writing in Reason magazine on the An
golan caper, supplies a reason and a substitute for
such interventionism:
"The major poi nt is that there are really no 'coun
tries' in all of Africa, in any genuine sense. The
'countries' were purely administrative creatures of
Western imperialism — British, French, Spanish,
Belgian and Portuguese — and they incorporated,
as well as cut through, the true national entities in
Africa, the particular tribes.
"Western imperialism dictated to these tribes in
newly expanded capital cities, which performed a
state-building and despotic function, and when
leaving, the Western countries simply turned the
state apparatus over to a Western-trained urban
elite, ready to assume rule on their own.
"If outside hands are kept off, all of these 'countries'
would rapidly disintegrate into their natural tribal
units. But to keep hands off, the U.S. would have to
abandon its post-World War II foreign policy of
propping up 'stable' existing centralized states
throughout the globe.
"Certainly, there is no rational excuse whatever for
American intervention in the African continent."

Its receipt of the proposed subsidy serves only to
focus on the audacity of American diplomacy.
Real forces
Instead, one must look beyond the immediate
quid pro quo bringing black rule to Rhodesia to see
the real forces at work in shaping U.S. policy.
The United States has maintained an outward
coldness toward Smith's regime ever since it de
clared its independence from British colonial rule
11 years ago. For many of those years, the United
States participated in a British-UN sponsored
boycott of Rhodesian exports, a move which forced
the United States to acquire chromium ore from the
Soviet Union.
Thus American policy has never been outwardly
designed to aid the independent white rulers of
Rhodesia. (One might argue that neither was it de
signed to further the cause of black rule, but instead
to perpetuate British sovereignty.)
Western interests
Why then did Kissinger on August 2 affiliate the
United States with British Prime Minister James
Callaghan's proposal to guarantee the wealth of
Rhodesian whites in return for their acceptance of
black rule?
A major reason, the Wall Street Journal reported
Friday, is that Kissinger "feared that lengthy wars
in southern Africa would radicalize politics across
the continent and damage Western interests there
(my emphasis)."
One need only look at Kissinger's earlier fiasco in
Angola, in which the United States supported a
collection of rapist-bandits who were supposedly

"our friends" in a battle for control of the former
Portuguese colony.
Indeed, as it turned out, many of the American
sycophants in Angola were ideologically no diffe
rent from the Marxists who triumphed when the
forces of Russian-Cuban imperialism defeated
those of American imperialism.
Corporate aims
From that sorry episode we can infer that the
basis for American actions in Rhodesia is not an
ethical one, but rather a desire to further the aims of
the corporate statists who have governed the Un
ited States during this century.

It is thus in the "Western interest" to see that the
obstinacy of Rhodesian whites does not lead to a
takeover of that country (and later, South Africa) by
foreign-backed guerrillas in Mozambique, Tan
zania and Zambia.
The real concern of the Henry Kissingers and
James Callaghans is not white rule or black rule, but
continued hegemony over the region by the corpo
rate states. This is why the United States, Britain,
South Africa, France and West Germany are pre
pared to pour $2 billion in tax money into Rhodesia
as economic aid to a black-majority government
and as compensation for whites whose wealth is
confiscated.
Apart from all the maneuverings of foreign pow
ers is the question of justice inside of Rhodesia.
Ironically, this is as it should be, though for a reason
far different from the mercantilist aims of the major
powers.
White colonialism
A half-century of white rule has reaped a harvest
not unlike that of colonialism elsewhere, including

that foisted upon the American Indian.
Blacks have been displaced and swindled, rele
gated to poverty amidst an oasis of wealth in Africa.
And yet, as Hoover Institution Fellow L.H. Gann
pointed out in a July Los Angeles Times article,
Rhodesian blacks are better off now than ever (and
indeed live better than blacks in many majority
ruled African nations), while the country is better
managed, more prosperous and freer of despotic
terror than most developing countries around the
world.
So what is the just solution to the internal predi
cament of Rhodesia? Whatever it is, one thing
should be certain: it is no concern of the American
taxpayer.
Secured wealth
Why then are we to be taxed to secure the wealth
of Rhodesian colonialists? Economist Murray
Rothbard, writing in Reason magazine on the An
golan caper, supplies a reason and a substitute for
such interventionism:
"The major poi nt is that there are really no 'coun
tries' in all of Africa, in any genuine sense. The
'countries' were purely administrative creatures of
Western imperialism — British, French, Spanish,
Belgian and Portuguese — and they incorporated,
as well as cut through, the true national entities in
Africa, the particular tribes.
"Western imperialism dictated to these tribes in
newly expanded capital cities, which performed a
state-building and despotic function, and when
leaving, the Western countries simply turned the
state apparatus over to a Western-trained urban
elite, ready to assume rule on their own.
"If outside hands are kept off, all of these 'countries'
would rapidly disintegrate into their natural tribal
units. But to keep hands off, the U.S. would have to
abandon its post-World War II foreign policy of
propping up 'stable' existing centralized states
throughout the globe.
"Certainly, there is no rational excuse whatever for
American intervention in the African continent."
