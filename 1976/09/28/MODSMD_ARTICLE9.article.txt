# California coast law sets example

An environmental battle of nation
wide significance has just been won in
California. The State Legislature has
approved a comprehensive law to pro
tect the 1072-mile coastline against
excessive development.
The measure, which is the most ex
tensive of its kind in the country, es
tablishes a framework for preserving
the state's beautiful beaches and
scenic treasures, such as Big Sur, the
Santa Monica Mountains and the
Mendocino coast. Those irreplaceable

resources are important not only to the
22.5 million Californians but to all
Americans.
Besides its benefits for the Pacific
coast, the law is noteworthy as an
example of citizen initiative, sound
public planning and political persis
tence. The campaign to save the coast
gained force several years ago when it
became apparent that, without some
intervention by the state, much of the
shoreline was likely to be taken over by
highrise apartment buildings, exclu

sive private estates and unsightly
commercial developments.
After the Legislature had failed to
enact controls, environmental groups
put a temporary coastal conservation
proposition on the statewide ballot in
1972 — and won, despite strong op
position from a coalition of industries,
labor unions and land developers.
That victory, in what has been re
garded as a growth-crazy state, was
widely viewed as major evidence of
spreading public concern about de-

structive, unchanneled development.
The temporary structure established
Proposition 20, laying the groundwork
for the permanent program that has
just been approved. A statewide coas
tal zone commission and six regional
commissions spent four years de
veloping a long-range plan, mean
while exercising veto power over all
development proposals along the
coast.
Wisely, the panels did not arbitrarily
reject all proposed changes in the
scenery. Instead, they used their
power to secure unobtrusive designs,
anti-pollution safeguards and public
access to beaches — even across pri
vate property. This experience showed
that resource preservation need not be
unreasoning and is not necessarily a
barrier to all growth.
Despite the pilot project's general
success, the permanent legislation met
resistance in Sacramento this
year. After several setbacks, Governor
Edmund G. Brown, Jr. and other spon
sors of the program finally negotiated
enough changes to gain organized
labor's backing and win approval of a
modified plan late last month.
This is a popular victory in every
sense —launched and sustained by
citizens and promoting the general in
terest. The long, careful campaign that
led to this result, as well as the legisla
tion itself, are worth being studied by
citizens here and elsewhere who may
have less extensive shorelines to save
but share the same concern about the
future of the nation's vulnerable
coasts.
