# Letter: Sequoias

### 
The Stanford Sequoias! At last we
have a mascot to he proud of. Since the
Sequoia and the Tree won over two
thirds of the vote in last spring's elec
tion, doesn't that indicate that the
majority wanted a tree mascot?
Isn't it logical to have the same sym
bol for a mascot as the onealready used
on all of Stanford's seals: the Sequoia
tree? How can you call us the ruhher
babv-buggy-bumpers Robber Barons

unless you've got bubble gum stuck to
the back molars?
The cardinal color can only go so far
and the Robber Barons won't get any
where with the administration or the
students. We voted last year for
Sequoia and the Tree. Put it together
this year and we'll have the winner.
