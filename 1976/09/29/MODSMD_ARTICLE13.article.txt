# Gerald Ford and his cardinal sin
## 
### 
Roger Freedman

It has long been clear that the 1976
presidential campaign is not so much a
contest of ideas as of men. The issues
are ill-defined in the minds of the elec
torate, making the images of the can
didates more important than ever.
At the same time, religion is a bigger
factor in this campaign than it has been

for many election years in the past,
thanks to Jimmy Carter's being "born
again" and Gerald Ford's scrabbling
after Catholic votes over the abortion
question. With these facts in mind, it is
appropriate that we consider not the
minds and ideas, but rather the souls
of the two candidates, and bring up the
question of sin.

There is no doubt that Jimmy Carter
has sinned any number of times in his
52 years on earth. But we can be
reasonably sure that whatever these
sins may have been, they have long
si nee been cleansed from Jimmy's soul
by the process of praying 25 times a
day.
Adam's burden
Gerald Ford, too, bears the burden of
Adam, and can certainly be tabbed
with any number of si ns in his lifetime.
But the difference between the two
men's souls can be spotted easily . . .
for it is only the soul of Gerald Ford
that bears the mark of the Big Sin.
Some might think this Big Sin to be
the fact that Ford largely ignored his
constituents in the fifth district of
Michigan during most of his 25 years
in the House, preferring to spend his
time working his way up in Congress
to the position of House Minority
Leader. But the only people qualified
to judge these acts are these same con
stituents, and they re-elected Ford on
12 different occasions.
Others might deem Ford's Big Sin to
have been his acceptance of Richard
Nixon's offer of the vice presidency.
Yet it is clear that this was the chance
of a half-dozen lifetimes for a career
politician like Gerald Ford.
Cracked veneer
When Nixon extended his offer in
October 1973 following the resigna
tion of Spiro Agnew, the Watergate
hearings had long since cracked the
veneer of respectability surrounding
his administration. It was only a matter
of time until the full force of the law
was brought to bear upon the fragile
body of Richard Nixon himself.
Thus Ford was being handed the
presidency on a platter, with nothing
to do but sit it out in the largely cere
monial post of vice president until
such time as Nixon was retired to San
Clemente forever.
Little matter that the Nixon ad
ministration had become, in the eyes
of an ever-growing segment of the
population, a foul stain on the history
of this nation . . . little matter that
Nixon was a vicious warmonger who
had been elected in 1968 with a "secret
plan" to end the war in Vietnam, a plan
that consisted of waiting until the eve
of the 1972 elections to announce that
peace was at hand . . . and little matter
that Jerry Ford didn't believe any of
that anyway.
Handed ticket
The point is that Ford was being
handed the ticket to power, and he
would have taken that from anyone,
even the devil himself. Ford was not

unique in this: any Republican politi
cian in the country would have done
the same.
So if Gerald Ford sinned in exalting
himself to the office of the vice presi
dent, it was a venial sin at worst, one
that countless others would have
gladly taken onto their bosom.
It was not until the following sum
mer that Gerald Ford pulled his Big
Sin out of the black recesses of his soul.
Even though Nixon had flown off the
White House lawn for the last time,
there was still a chance for the lessons
of Watergate to be made plain.
There was still a chance for a trial
which would say, once and for all and
for all history to hear, that there are
some things in America bigger than
personal power and influence. The
trial of Richard Nixon would have
stood as a beacon, blazing a message
into the minds of those who would
succumb to corruption: that in the end,
their devious efforts would be for
naught, that justice would eventually
triumph, that the good guys really do
win.
The pardon
This trial did not come to pass, and
by presidential edict can never come to
pass . . . for as we all know, Gerald
Ford pardoned Richard Nixon of all
past sins, public and private, forever.
This is a presumptuous thing for any
man to do; as Jimmy Garter could have
told Ford (had he been willing to listen
to a southern governor of whom he'd
hardly heard), the forgiving of sins is
the business of God, not man.
That is why, in absolving Richard
Nixon of sin, Gerald Ford, 38th presi
dent of these United States, did no
thing more than transfer those sins to
his own immortal soul. At the same
time, he committed a Big Sin against
the people of America, both living and
as yet unborn â€” the sin of the denial of
justice.
The late Robert Kennedy said in
1968 that Richard Nixon represents
"the dark side of the American spirit."
Nixon has been banished to San
Glemente to wash his hands in the
waters of the Pacific (the same Pacific
into which empties the Mekong River),
but his dark spirit remains in the White
House.
It possesses its new host less vio
lently than it did Richard Nixon, but
with the finality that comes from
knowing that it did not have to invade
the soul of Gerald Ford.
Instead, it was invited.
