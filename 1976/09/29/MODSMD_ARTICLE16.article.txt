# Tuition hikes: when will it stop?
## 
### 
(CPS) —Money is again flow
ing from student wallets as they
return to their campuses facing
tuition and other fee hikes. Some
schools in fact, have already an
nounced additional hikes plan
ned for next year, while students
this year are still shelling out
more money than ever. But stu
dent opposition is scattered a
cross the nation.
Tuition rose in New Jersey an
average of $ 169 per student over
last year. Undergraduate stu
dents of the State Univesity of
New York (SUNY) are paying
$200 more. Tuition at Cal is ex
pected to rise next fall. Students
at the University of Mas
sachusetts will see a total in
crease of $225 spread over two
and a half years. And so it goes
for students across the country.
Student opposition to various
tuition and fee hikes has fallen
off at the start of the year, in con
trast to last spring, which saw
two capitols stormed, a chancel
lor pelted with eggs and build

ings taken over in protest of
hikes. Many students are now at
tempting to act as legal collec
tive bargaining agents. Other
groups are lobbying legislators
and registering people to vote
against those who would raise
their fees.
The end to spiraling education
costs does not seem in sight.
Students returning to school are
learning of increases planned for
next year, and student leaders
find their hands tied with
apathy.
Student lobbyists in California
say they'll be doing a lot of
screaming, protesting a prop
osed across-the-board increase
due in October of next year.
Increased apathy, feelings that
there isn't much that can be
done, and being ingrained with
the ever-present spectre of infla
tion may be leading students to
continually expect tuition hikes.
An lowa State student leader
said, .. it may be a sign of the
times . . . it's sad and scary."

The tuition situation at
Stanford may be a little worse
than that at many other
schools. Stanford tuition rose
this year to a whopping
$1425, up from $1270 last
year, an increase of over 12
percent.
Opposition to the hike has
not been too great, but accord
ing to Holly Diaz, information
supervisor at the Registrar's
Office, the hike has been "a
great shock for many stu
dents."
Haroldine Albaugh, asst.
manager of student accounts
at the Controller's office,
commented that as far as stu
dent protest is concerned,
"this year is no different from
any other," despite the rise in

tuition.
The Registrar's office has
estimated that some 10.000
persons will register for clas
ses in the various schools of
the university. The Control
ler's office expects that this
will bring in some 14 million
dollars during the quarter,
and that students will pay
another two million for room
and board.
Student opposition to the
tuition hike seems non
existent. Council of Presi
dents (COP) member Vic Pet
roff commented that, "at this
point, we can't point to any
specific program to deal with
it (rising tuition). Student ac
tion in this area tends to be
ineffective."

j Stanford students filled Maples Pavillion yesterday
and Monday in order to register and pay that ever
| increasing tuition fee. Tuition this year is set at $1425,
with no end to the increases either here or across the
nation.
(CPS) —Money is again flow
ing from student wallets as they
return to their campuses facing
tuition and other fee hikes. Some
schools in fact, have already an
nounced additional hikes plan
ned for next year, while students
this year are still shelling out
more money than ever. But stu
dent opposition is scattered a
cross the nation.
Tuition rose in New Jersey an
average of $ 169 per student over
last year. Undergraduate stu
dents of the State Univesity of
New York (SUNY) are paying
$200 more. Tuition at Cal is ex
pected to rise next fall. Students
at the University of Mas
sachusetts will see a total in
crease of $225 spread over two
and a half years. And so it goes
for students across the country.
Student opposition to various
tuition and fee hikes has fallen
off at the start of the year, in con
trast to last spring, which saw
two capitols stormed, a chancel
lor pelted with eggs and build

ings taken over in protest of
hikes. Many students are now at
tempting to act as legal collec
tive bargaining agents. Other
groups are lobbying legislators
and registering people to vote
against those who would raise
their fees.
The end to spiraling education
costs does not seem in sight.
Students returning to school are
learning of increases planned for
next year, and student leaders
find their hands tied with
apathy.
Student lobbyists in California
say they'll be doing a lot of
screaming, protesting a prop
osed across-the-board increase
due in October of next year.
Increased apathy, feelings that
there isn't much that can be
done, and being ingrained with
the ever-present spectre of infla
tion may be leading students to
continually expect tuition hikes.
An lowa State student leader
said, .. it may be a sign of the
times . . . it's sad and scary."

The tuition situation at
Stanford may be a little worse
than that at many other
schools. Stanford tuition rose
this year to a whopping
$1425, up from $1270 last
year, an increase of over 12
percent.
Opposition to the hike has
not been too great, but accord
ing to Holly Diaz, information
supervisor at the Registrar's
Office, the hike has been "a
great shock for many stu
dents."
Haroldine Albaugh, asst.
manager of student accounts
at the Controller's office,
commented that as far as stu
dent protest is concerned,
"this year is no different from
any other," despite the rise in

tuition.
The Registrar's office has
estimated that some 10.000
persons will register for clas
ses in the various schools of
the university. The Control
ler's office expects that this
will bring in some 14 million
dollars during the quarter,
and that students will pay
another two million for room
and board.
Student opposition to the
tuition hike seems non
existent. Council of Presi
dents (COP) member Vic Pet
roff commented that, "at this
point, we can't point to any
specific program to deal with
it (rising tuition). Student ac
tion in this area tends to be
ineffective."
