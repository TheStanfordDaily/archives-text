Out-SMRTed
Pacific Telephone recently changed its rate structure to charge local calls based on how long
they last. Called Single Message Rate Timing (SMRT), the scheme has hit particularly hard at
computer users, like the one shown here. Persons on the university telephone system wishing
to use the campus 370 computer can avoid the charge by calling extension 7-0551, the Stanford
Center for Information Processing has announced.
