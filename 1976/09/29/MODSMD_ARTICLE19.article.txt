# Shuttle bus system resumes Serra service
## 
### Alex Alben 
Three brand new "Marguer
ite" shuttle buses, with a fourth
to back them up, went into ser
vice along the Serra St. shuttle
route early Monday.
Two buses will begin runs be
tween the Medical School, Stan
ford Shopping Center and Es
condido Village at 6:30 a.m.,
making the trip at 10-minute in
tervals. The third bus will be
added between 10:30 a.m. and
2:30 p.m. when the shopping
center run is added. When one of
the three operating buses needs
repair, the fourth bus will be ro
tated into service.
The new buses will hold 31
passengers and are painted ma
roon with white trim. As op
posed to the buses in operation
last year which were old
amusement park vehicles, the
new Marguerites were specially
designed for use here.
According to Dan DeYoung,
director of service operations,
the open-sided buses will allow
for an increased volume of pas
sengers.
Last year's bus service pro
vided transportation for as many

as 1000 persons per day at its
peak period. However, because
that system was composed only
of two shuttles, the breakdown
of one bus often caused delays in
meeting time schedules, which
led to a corresponding decrease
in the number of passengers. But
with two additional buses, more
dependable service is expected,
DeYoung said.
Each bus was purchased by
the university at a cost of
$28,000. Funds required for the
entire system will total $130,000
this year, provided exclusively
from parking fees.
Steve Schmidt, associate
planner of the project, indicates
that aside from an expanded bus
squad, compared to last year's
Marguerite program, the new
system will also offer more
operating time for commuters.
While giving free rides to
Stanford students, employes and
visitors, the Marguerite system
will synchronously alleviate any
inter-campus traffic congestion,
according to planners.
The Marguerite is named after
one of the horses that pulled an
early-day horsedrawn bus.
