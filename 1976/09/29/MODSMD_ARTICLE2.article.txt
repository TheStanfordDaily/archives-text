# Resemble Master Charge trademark
## 'Christ charge' cards seized at Maples 
### Karl Heisler 
A Wells Fargo Bank official yester
day confiscated four copies of a Master
Charge credit card look-alike outside
of Maples Pavilion, claiming them in
violation of the Master Charge card
trademark.
The paper cards, which have no
numbers or other identification, were
being distributed by members of the
Stanford Chinese Christian Fellow
ship (SCCF), a bible study group.
The "Christ charge" card carries the
words "Give Christ charge of your life"
across a background of overlapping
red and yellow circles on a white field
similar to the Master Charge card, and
has quotations from the Bible on its
back.
VVyatt Allen, mid-peninsula reg
ional sales manager for Wells Fargo,
who took the cards, specified three

possible trademark violations: the
overlapping circles, the similar
typeface used in printing the word
"charge" and a symbol at the lower
right corner of the "Christ charge"
card, which closely resembles the "In
terbank" symbol on a Master Charge
card.
Jacob Fok, pastor of the Lord's Crace
Church in Palo Alto, and an adviser to

the SCCF, said he purchased the
"Christ charge" cards from Newton's
Christian bookstore in Palo Alto.
He said that he had distributed over
100 cards to "personal contacts" over
the past six months. About 20 cards
were passed out at registration before
Allen took the remaining four.
Allen did not appear particularly
disturbed by the cards, calling them

"kind ofa neat littlegimmick." Hedid.
however, contact Wells Fargo's credit
ard division in S.an Francisco and
said lie will forward one of the "Christ
charge" cards to them for any further
action. This could include legal action
by the Western States Bankcard As
sociation (WSBA) which represents
Master Charge in the seven western
states.
Wells Fargo is aware of the "Christ
charge" cards, according to Debbi laF
ranchi in the San Francisco credit card
division, but Larry Cook of the WSBA
said his office has not yet been con
tacted. He agreed with Allen that the
WSBA would definitely ask the printer
to voluntarily stop producing the
cards before taking court action.
No further details of any pending
action by either Wells Fargo or the
WSBA were available.
Owners of other Christian
bookstores in this area have heard of or
seen the card, but do not sell it or know
where it is printed.
Connie Baker, manager of Newton's
l'alo Alto store, said the card is a big
seller at three cents each. She said she
doubts the card creates a serious prob
lem, although she said she had once
confused her "Christ charge" with a
real Master Charge card. Baker was
unable to determine who printed the
cards.
Vacationing store owner Bill New
ton was unavailable for comment.

division, but Larry Cook of the WSBA
said his office has not yet been con
tacted. He agreed with Allen that the
WSBA would definitely ask the printer
to voluntarily stop producing the
cards before taking court action.
No further details of any pending
action by either Wells Fargo or the
WSBA were available.
Owners of other Christian
bookstores in this area have heard of or
seen the card, but do not sell it or know
where it is printed.
Connie Baker, manager of Newton's
l'alo Alto store, said the card is a big
seller at three cents each. She said she
doubts the card creates a serious prob
lem, although she said she had once
confused her "Christ charge" with a
real Master Charge card. Baker was
unable to determine who printed the
cards.
Vacationing store owner Bill New
ton was unavailable for comment.

This is what the Christian organization was handing out around Maples,
and while it may get you spiritual commodities, it won't buy your books this
quarter.
A Wells Fargo Bank official yester
day confiscated four copies of a Master
Charge credit card look-alike outside
of Maples Pavilion, claiming them in
violation of the Master Charge card
trademark.
The paper cards, which have no
numbers or other identification, were
being distributed by members of the
Stanford Chinese Christian Fellow
ship (SCCF), a bible study group.
The "Christ charge" card carries the
words "Give Christ charge of your life"
across a background of overlapping
red and yellow circles on a white field
similar to the Master Charge card, and
has quotations from the Bible on its
back.
VVyatt Allen, mid-peninsula reg
ional sales manager for Wells Fargo,
who took the cards, specified three

possible trademark violations: the
overlapping circles, the similar
typeface used in printing the word
"charge" and a symbol at the lower
right corner of the "Christ charge"
card, which closely resembles the "In
terbank" symbol on a Master Charge
card.
Jacob Fok, pastor of the Lord's Crace
Church in Palo Alto, and an adviser to

the SCCF, said he purchased the
"Christ charge" cards from Newton's
Christian bookstore in Palo Alto.
He said that he had distributed over
100 cards to "personal contacts" over
the past six months. About 20 cards
were passed out at registration before
Allen took the remaining four.
Allen did not appear particularly
disturbed by the cards, calling them

"kind ofa neat littlegimmick." Hedid.
however, contact Wells Fargo's credit
ard division in S.an Francisco and
said lie will forward one of the "Christ
charge" cards to them for any further
action. This could include legal action
by the Western States Bankcard As
sociation (WSBA) which represents
Master Charge in the seven western
states.
Wells Fargo is aware of the "Christ
charge" cards, according to Debbi laF
ranchi in the San Francisco credit card
division, but Larry Cook of the WSBA
said his office has not yet been con
tacted. He agreed with Allen that the
WSBA would definitely ask the printer
to voluntarily stop producing the
cards before taking court action.
No further details of any pending
