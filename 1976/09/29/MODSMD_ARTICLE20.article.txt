## New coach brings new look to Card soccer 
### John Murao 
With a new coach this season, and a 19-2-3
record last year, Stanford soccer has taken an
important step toward respectability.
Nelson Lodge, formerly of Hay ward State,
welcomed 30 returning players andsix fresh men
Sept. 11 for pre-season training camp. Not only
does Lodge bring badty needed discipline, en
thusiasm and knowledge of the game to Stan
ford, but he is a strong motivator and has de
monstrated an active sensitivity for his players.
Ironically, the graduation of several players
last June is in Lodge's favor. Personality prob
lems plagued a talented team whose potential
was never realized last year.
Lodge, a self-acknowledged, unrestrained
optimist, notes, "Certainly, we don't have the
talent of a USF. I'm going to find out who are
my best 11 athletes, find positions for them and
ask that they give it their best. We are going to
play hard, attacking, aggressive soccer."
'Dutch Whirl'
The attacking soccer Lodge refers to is
known as the 'Dutch Whirl' and is particularly
suited to this year's team: constant defensive
harassment with one, two and three men al
ways on the ball. Offensively, the tactic will be
a version of the long ball, with a lot of through
passes to space* Lacking any precise pattern in
its offense, Stanford figures to capitalize on its
aggressive defense, forcing the opponent into
mistakes.
As a result of graduation losses (only three
regulars return), this year's team is very young.
In Lodge's search for his first team, there have
been a few surprises.
In the crucial keeper position, Lewis
Butler, a sophomore with limited experience
but unlimited potential, gives Lodge a strong
beginning. The defensive positions of Lodge's
3-3-3-1 alignment will be selected from the
foursome of Mike knowles, Dave Carey, Dave

Cannon and Mark Triska, with Rick Morrow
and co-captain Jim Melamed as sweepers.
The mid-field is fairly set with Paul koc
zenko in the middle and Steve Arnold, Larry
Fischman and freshman Steve Dietz at the
flanks. Dietz has been impressive, displaying
unusual poise for a newcomer.
A second freshman who figures prominently
in Lodge's plans is Ron Johnson. He'll be play
ing out at the right wing and will complement
Skip Pfeiffer and co-captain Bobby Geiger on
the forward line.
Strong forwards
The forward positions should be a Stanford
strength.Pfeiffer and Geiger are both three year
regulars. Bob Bonaparte, a two-year man, is a
capable substitute.
Coach Lodge has been pleased with his
squad. "Everyone's working hard, the spirit is
high, and I'm looking forward to the season. At
this point, the only thing I can say is that 1 want
a back-up for Butler. Otherwise, I'm very
pleased with our progress."
After an impressive 2-0 victory over a good
Humboldt State side last Thursday, Stanford
faced the unenviable task of playing successive
games against two nationally ranked schools,
San Jose State and San Francisco, in the Bi
centennial Tournament at San Jose.
An unfortunate penalty in the fifth minute
against San Jose slowed Stanford momentarily.
Stanford actually dominated play much of the
first half before tiring in the second half.
Saturday night, Stanford featured a five man
defense against the high powered San Fran
cisco Dons (25 goals in their first two matches)
and held them to a single goal in the first half.
Despite the defeats, Lodge was encouraged
by his squad's performance. "Heck, the guys
were outstanding. They showed me something
by staying with two of the best teams in the
nation."

soccer team's front line. Geiger is shown here in action from a game last year.
