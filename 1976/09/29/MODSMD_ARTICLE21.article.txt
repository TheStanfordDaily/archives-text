# 'Films show Robinson scored'
## Lynn Stiles blasts officials 
### Chris Baker 
It just depends how you look
at it.
San Jose State Head Football
Coach Lynn Stiles didn't lash
out at the officials last Saturday
when they denied Spartan run
ning back Walter Robinson a
touchdown on the final play of
the first half.
But yesterday, when asked
about the call at the football
writers' luncheon, he was angry.
"I never prejudge a call until I
see the films," said Stiles. "I
took a look at them on Sunday
and in my opinion it was a
touchdown."
Stanford coach Jack Christian
sen said that the films he viewed
early Sunday morning, con
firmed that Robinson's knee

touched the ground before the
Spartan running back skidded
into the end zone.
'Judgment call'
"The thing i was disturbed
about was the way the officials
explained the play to me," said
Stiles. "Robinson had his back
turned to the official who called
the play. There's no way the offi
cial could have seen the ball. It
was a judgment call."
Stiles added that he thought
the ball crossed the imaginary
plane of the goal line before the
play was blown dead.
"Football officials are like a
fraternity," said Stiles, "They
protect each other. 1 still call
them the way I see them and the
official blew it."
But a reel of film has yet to

throw a pass in a football game. It
will go down in the books as
Stanford 28, San Jose State 23.
The Spartans will have their
hands full in Strawberry Ca
nyon, this Saturday, when they
face California.
And Stanford will have its
hands on Army.
Air show
The Cadets figure to put on an
air show instead of marching
around West Point. Army quar
terback Leamon Hall, who threw
55 times in last week's, 34-32,
loss to North Carolina State, has'
completed 63 of 118 passes for
824 yards and seven
touchdowns. His 21 comple
tions per game and 271.7 yards
per game total offense are the
best in the nation.
Hall's best target is tight end
Clennie Brundidge, who leads
the nation in receptions with 27.
"Army is an unknown qual
ity," said Christiansen. "They
had 34 returning lettermen, but
about 15 or 16 of their kids didn't
come back this year."
The Cards, led by quarterback
Guy Benjamin, who moved to
the top of conference passing
and total offense statistics this
week, might come out running.
But there is a possibility that
Benjamin may not direct the
Stanford attack. Benjamin, still
limping from a twisted ankle
suffered last Saturday, didn't
work out Monday.
Christiansen says that
Benjamin should be healthy by

Saturday.
Stanford resembles the Army
after Vietnam. Flanker Tony
Hill, who missed the last two
games with a severe ankle sp
rain, may see duty Saturday.
Cornerback Larry Reynolds,
who suffered a charley horse
against San Jose State, didn't
participate in Monday's drills,
but should be ready to go full
speed this weekend.
Forward march
The Cadets won't exactly be
going forward march, though.
Four Army football players
were involved in the cheating
scandal. And another 15 decided
to hang up their pads after last
year's disastrous season.
The Cadets beat Holy Cross
and Lafayette (yes, they still
have a football team) before los
ing to North Carolina, 34-32, last
week.
Most coaches talk about ex
perience in terms of years, but
Army coach Homer Smith
speaks in terms of weeks. The
Cadet secondary is comprised of
freshmen and sophomores.
"Stanford is a lot better than
North Carolina," said Smith.
And Army is better than San
Jose State.
Smith, a graduate of the Stan
ford flusiness School. was repor
tedly quite upset after last year's
67-14 Card win. fie thought that
Christiansen tried to pour in on.
Oh. hell the only way the
Cadets can win Saturday's game
is by cheating.
