# Shuffling the Cards
## Fans don't know Chris 
### Chris Baker 
Stanford running back. Don Stevenson ex
pressed it best last week when he said that
performing before 103,000 screaming
Michigan fans on Sept. 18 was like, "playing
in a circus. It was like sleepwalking."
Football weekends in Midwest towns like
University Park, Pa., and Ann Arbor are like
religion. Every Saturday the keepers of the
faith jam every hotel in town. It's like a holy
pilgrimage to Mecca. The entire town re
volves around Saturday.
The stadium is a holy temple. Michigan
Stadium, the hole that the late football coach
Fielding Yost dug; Athletic Director Don
Canham carpeted and Bo Schembechler fills
every Saturday, is typical.
When the Michigan band struck up the
Wolverine fight song, for what turned out to
be the first of many times that long after
noon, I fully expected the ghost of Yost and
Tom Harmon to be carried into the place in
sedan chairs.
Pep rally
Michigan was still buzzing over President
Ford's appearance just two days before. It
was billed as his campaign kickoff, but it was
actually just a big pep rally, minus a bonfire.
After spending two weeks living out of a
suitcase Stanford returned home last Satur
day. The Cards had been the Christians in
football hotbeds Ann Arbor and University
Park, Pa., for the first two games of the sea
son.
As you probably figured out when you
bought your season ticket this week, the
Cards have only one home appearance in
their first five games this fall.
It's too bad all of them aren't on the road.
No, 1 don't think the Athletic Department
should get any richer than it already is. But if
Stanford fans behave the way they did
Saturday, they may as well be IJSC, Michi
gan or Ohio State rooters.
'Legion Fever'
Had the game been played in Philadel
phia, I could understand the boos which
greeted Mike Cordova and Jack Christiansen
when they were introduced on television.
Th(! fans in Philly would probably boo "Leg
ion Fever."
But this is Stanford.
People, as shown by the new television
series "The Cong Show," will do anything
to get on the tube. And the same goes for
football players.
As UCLA quarterback Jeff Dankworth put
it,"I want to show the folks back home that
I'm still alive."
With both the offensive and defensive
units lobbying to get introduced on televi
sion, Christiansen decided to introduce 12
seniors.

Cordova is a senior, Benjamin, at least in
terms of eligibility, is a junior.
'Bullshit'
"Apparently they thought I was going to
start Cordova in the introductions," said
Christiansen after the game, "but 1 don't care
what the reason was, it's bullshit."
Christiansen probably did make a mistake
by not naming his quarterback until late
Thursday. Since the story appeared in only
one paper most of the fans did not know who
was starting.
"Here's a guy (Cordova) who's worked re
ally hard for four years, given his best, and
he's booed by these sons-of-bitches," Christ
iansen added.
The only time Stanford was booed on the
road, was when the Cards elected to go for a
field goal late in the fourth quarter against
Michigan. The Wolverine fans thought their
defense had earned a shutout. But those were
the kind of boos you hear at a baseball
stadium when a player is walked.
Not NFL
Chistiansen's and Cordova's fame proba
bly equals that of John McKay around here.
But unlike USC and some other big-time
football powers, this isn't the NFL.
The booing arguments have grown almost
as old as the quarterback debate.
Perhaps Christiansen is at fault. Com
munication between the second floor of the
Athletic Department and the fans has been
almost as strained as Nixon's relations with
the press.
But if the fans got to know Christiansen
like some members of the press, the boos
might be silenced.
Press breakfasts
He's begun having weekly breakfasts with
about 10 journalists this year. The first one,
held last week, was excellent. Responding to
questions, Chris often talked about his own
playing days in the NFL and offered a lot of
good stories.
If the students could only see that side of
Christiansen things might change. Maybe
he should do what basketball coach Dick Di-
Biaso did last fall and eat dinner with stu
dents in the dorms one night a week.
It probably wouldn't be possible until after
the season is over. Christiansen's time dur
ing the season is filled with strategy sessions
and team dinners. Unlike a lot of other
coaches though, he manages to spend a few
evenings a week with his family.
Christiansen, at the dinner table, would be
a hit. His football stories, filled with rough
language, would offer insight into his life.
As for now, how do you get to West Point?
I see why Cordova would rather play on
the road.

start Cordova in the introductions," said
Christiansen after the game, "but 1 don't care
what the reason was, it's bullshit."
Christiansen probably did make a mistake
by not naming his quarterback until late
Thursday. Since the story appeared in only
one paper most of the fans did not know who
was starting.
"Here's a guy (Cordova) who's worked re
ally hard for four years, given his best, and
he's booed by these sons-of-bitches," Christ
iansen added.
The only time Stanford was booed on the
road, was when the Cards elected to go for a
field goal late in the fourth quarter against
Michigan. The Wolverine fans thought their
defense had earned a shutout. But those were
the kind of boos you hear at a baseball
stadium when a player is walked.
Not NFL
Chistiansen's and Cordova's fame proba
bly equals that of John McKay around here.
But unlike USC and some other big-time
football powers, this isn't the NFL.
The booing arguments have grown almost
as old as the quarterback debate.
Perhaps Christiansen is at fault. Com
munication between the second floor of the
Athletic Department and the fans has been
almost as strained as Nixon's relations with
the press.
But if the fans got to know Christiansen
like some members of the press, the boos
might be silenced.
Press breakfasts
He's begun having weekly breakfasts with
about 10 journalists this year. The first one,
held last week, was excellent. Responding to
questions, Chris often talked about his own
playing days in the NFL and offered a lot of
good stories.
If the students could only see that side of
Christiansen things might change. Maybe
he should do what basketball coach Dick Di-
Biaso did last fall and eat dinner with stu
dents in the dorms one night a week.
It probably wouldn't be possible until after
the season is over. Christiansen's time dur
ing the season is filled with strategy sessions
and team dinners. Unlike a lot of other
coaches though, he manages to spend a few
evenings a week with his family.
Christiansen, at the dinner table, would be
a hit. His football stories, filled with rough
language, would offer insight into his life.
As for now, how do you get to West Point?
I see why Cordova would rather play on
the road.

Stanford running back. Don Stevenson ex
pressed it best last week when he said that
performing before 103,000 screaming
Michigan fans on Sept. 18 was like, "playing
in a circus. It was like sleepwalking."
Football weekends in Midwest towns like
University Park, Pa., and Ann Arbor are like
religion. Every Saturday the keepers of the
faith jam every hotel in town. It's like a holy
pilgrimage to Mecca. The entire town re
volves around Saturday.
The stadium is a holy temple. Michigan
Stadium, the hole that the late football coach
Fielding Yost dug; Athletic Director Don
Canham carpeted and Bo Schembechler fills
every Saturday, is typical.
When the Michigan band struck up the
Wolverine fight song, for what turned out to
be the first of many times that long after
noon, I fully expected the ghost of Yost and
Tom Harmon to be carried into the place in
sedan chairs.
Pep rally
Michigan was still buzzing over President
Ford's appearance just two days before. It
was billed as his campaign kickoff, but it was
actually just a big pep rally, minus a bonfire.
After spending two weeks living out of a
suitcase Stanford returned home last Satur
day. The Cards had been the Christians in
football hotbeds Ann Arbor and University
Park, Pa., for the first two games of the sea
son.
As you probably figured out when you
bought your season ticket this week, the
Cards have only one home appearance in
their first five games this fall.
It's too bad all of them aren't on the road.
No, 1 don't think the Athletic Department
should get any richer than it already is. But if
Stanford fans behave the way they did
Saturday, they may as well be IJSC, Michi
gan or Ohio State rooters.
'Legion Fever'
Had the game been played in Philadel
phia, I could understand the boos which
greeted Mike Cordova and Jack Christiansen
when they were introduced on television.
Th(! fans in Philly would probably boo "Leg
ion Fever."
But this is Stanford.
People, as shown by the new television
series "The Cong Show," will do anything
to get on the tube. And the same goes for
football players.
As UCLA quarterback Jeff Dankworth put
it,"I want to show the folks back home that
I'm still alive."
With both the offensive and defensive
units lobbying to get introduced on televi
sion, Christiansen decided to introduce 12
seniors.

Cordova is a senior, Benjamin, at least in
terms of eligibility, is a junior.
