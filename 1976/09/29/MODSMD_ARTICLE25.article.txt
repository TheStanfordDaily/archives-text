## Fertig brings winning tradition to OSU

Corvallis, Ore. — Oregon State
is an improved football team in
1970. It could hardly beany
worse than it was last year.
The 1975 Beavers, coached by
Dee Andros. finished 1-10 and
were last in the Pacific-8 in total
offense and total defense.
Something had to be done,
and something was done. An
dros generously resigned to be
come the athletic director, and
hired former USC assistant Craig

Fertig, 34, as the new head
coach.
"We looked the entire country
over for the best man available
for our coaching job," Andros
said. "And 1 don't think under
any circumstances could we
have found a better man than
Craig Fertig."
Fertig popular
Fertig came to Oregon State
with some flattering recommen
dations from a couple of famous
USC alumni.

"Craig and I have been friends
for a number of years," said O.J.
Simpson. "He helped me a lot as
a running back at USC and I owe
a lot to him because he had a
definite impact on the type of
person I am today. I am gratified
he would consider me to help
endorse his program."
Lynn Swann, wide receiver for
the Pittsburgh Steelers, said,
"Even though coach Fertig did
not personally coach me at USC,
the impact he had on our total
offense was tremendous.
New regime
Fertig has brought a lot of
changes to Corvallis.
First, he signed 22 junior col
lege players although he had 42
lettermen returning. Why?
"I wouldn't count on anyone
from a 1-10 team," he said. "We
want to turn this program
around right now."
Fertig added, "We'll never
take this many JC transfers
again."
Second, practices have be
come less strict and, according
to some of the players, more en
joyable.
"The new staff is more per
sonal with everybody," says
quarterback Kyle Grossart. "It's
fun to practice. Nobody's up
tight. The overall attitude is bet
ter. Losing magnifies a lot of
things."
Unconventional methods
Some of Fertig's methods are
not exactly conventional. To
break up the monotony of the

Beavers' summer two-a-day
practices, he often played a re
cording of the Stanford band on
the field.
"That band does a helluva
job," Fertig said, "I think they're
great. 'Honkv Tonk Woman' and
'Proud Mary'—nobody can play
those like Stanford."
Beaver fans have responded to
Fertig's new approach. The
crowd of 29,952 at Oregon
State's opener against Kansas
was the largest ever in Corvallis
for a non-conference game.
Cromwell impressed
The most significant change
though, has been in perfor
mance. Although Kansas,
ranked 19th at the beginning of
the season, beat OSU, 28-16,
Jayhawk quarterback Nolan
Cromwell said the Beavers are
"300 percent better than last
year." Oregon State led the game
at halftime, 10-7, and was down
just 14-10 in the fourth quarter
before Kansas pulled away.
Fertig has been starting four JC
transfers on offense and four on
defense. The most talked about
newcomers are tailback lames
Fields and receiver Dwavne
Hall.
Fields came from Arizona
Western Junior College, the
same school Chuck Muncie at
tended for awhile. Fields is the
fastest back on the team and Fer
tig compares him to former (JSC
star Mike Garrett.
Hall is the 100-yard dash
California JC champion and

caught 47 passes for over 800
yards last year at Hartnell JC.
Hall and four-year starter Lee
Overton make receiving possi
bly the Beavers' strongest de
partment.
QB duel
Grossart and sophomore red
shirt Jeff Kynaston have been
competing for the starting quar
terback job and John Norman, a
junior from Sunnyvale, isn't far
behind.
Fertig seems to like Kynaston,
but says "all are capable of run
ning the team."
Kynaston and Norman are
option-type quarterbacks, while
Grossart, a junior, "is as close to
a pure drop-back passer as we
have," according to Fertig.
No JC transfer is going to
budge senior defensive end De
nnis Boyd. A four-year starter,
Boyd (6-foot-6, 245) is an All-
American prospect and a proba
bly high pick in next year's pro
draft, if there is one.
Assessing his team overall,
Fertig said, "I believe we're
strong at the quarterback, run
ning back and wide receiver pos
itions. We aren't deep in the of
fensive and defensive lines. If we
get a lot of injuries, we'll be in for
a whale of a lot of trouble.
