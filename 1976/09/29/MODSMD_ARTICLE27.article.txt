A Spokane, Wash., newspaper
is holding a contest asking read
ers to guess whether
Washington State All-Pacific-8
punter Cavin Hedrick can punt
the ball over the Spokane Col
iseum.
Hedrick's chances are about as
good as the Cougars' prospects
for success in the Pac-8.
First-year WSU coach Jackie
Sherrill, who came to remote
Pullman after spending seven
years assisting Johnny Majors at
the University of Pittsburgh,
said it would take three games to
evaluate WSU.
Kansas 35, Washington State
16.
Minnesota 28, Washington
State 14.

Wisconsin 35, Washington
State 26.
The Cougars, who have been
waiting for next year ever since
Halley's comet, should wait
until 1980. Then WSU should
have one of the most experi
enced squads in the Pac-8. Or the
Big Sky.
Washington State is helping
Pac-8 officials find reasons for
reorganizing the league every
weekend. The Cougars have a
chance to win this Saturday.
They're playing undefeated
Idaho.
WSU is so young that the team
trainers don't have to worry
about shaving a player's leg
when they tape ankles. Sherrill
calls WSU the "Kiddie Corps."
And they've been playing
football like a "Kiddie Show."
Sherrill, who didn't have to
worry about throwing the ball
last year at Pitt, with Heisman
Trophy candidate Tony Dorsett

in the backfield, has ordered
Cougar quarterbacks John Hop
kins and Jack Thompson to
throw the ball.
At least he knows where it is.
But if you think Card coach
Jack Christiansen has a quarter
back problem, then Sherril 1 has a
dilemma.
Quarterback problem
Do you start Thompson, who
has thrown for 219 yards on 21 of
42 passes? Or do you go with
Hopkins, the senior, who has
thrown for 238 yards, complet
ing 14 of 23 for two touchdowns?
Sherrill has been alternating
his quarterbacks and he's having
as much success as California
did when Mike White alternated
Steve Bartkowski and Vince
Feragamo a couple of years back.
When WSU isn't putting the
ball up for grabs (the Cougars
threw five interceptions in their
first two games) fullback Dan
Doornink is getting hit behind
the line of scrimmage.
Doornink, who set a school
sophomore rushing record of
607 yards rushing last year at
tailback, has carried 20 times for
103 yards this season. He scored
the Cougars'only touchdown on
the ground.
Sophomore Harold Gillum,
who broke a 79-yard run against
Idaho last year, has taken over
Doornink's old tailback spot.
Gillum, a 9.8 sprinter, has
gained 62-yards on nine carries
this year.
Poor rushing
But the Cougar rushing game
hasn't exactly baffled opponents
this year. Washington State has
gained just 191 yards on the
ground so far.
It's understandable when you
have an offensive line as inex
perienced as Washington
State's. The Cougars start just
one senior up front. Bob Hill,
who started every game at left
guard last year, is Sherrill's only
experienced offensive lineman.
The new coach put 12
freshmen on the traveling squad
and only two seniors in starting
positions. Only nine seniors dot
the roster.
"We've made some progress
and some of our younger players
are coming to the front," said
Sherrill. "However we still do
not have the consistency we
need, especially on offense."
Consistent performance
The Cougars have gotten a
consistent performance from

junior wide receiver Mike
Levenseller, who ranks first
in conference pass receiving
statistics.
Levenseller has hauled down
18 passes for 329 yards. In
Washington State's 35-16 open
ing loss to Kansas, he hauled
down six passes for 111 yards,
including a long gainer of 41
yards.
But while the Cougars have
heen flying through the air, op
ponents have been speeding
right through a porous WSU de
fense on the ground.
WSU have surrendered 762
yards rushing in their first two
games, to rank last in conference
rushing defense statistics. The
Cougars also occupy the cellar in
team defense statistics, giving
up 944 yards.
Sherrill installed a new de
fense, using a five-man front and
two linebackers. WSU has only
one senior, right tackle Tim
Ochs, starting on defense.
Motivation
But the first-year coach, a mas
ter of motivation, will probably
find a way to put together his
troubled defense. Once, when
Pitt was scheduled to play
Florida State's Seminoles, Sher
rill went to practice wearing an
Indian outfit.
Majors, who was in on the
joke, then whipped out a cap pis
tol and shot him.
Sherrill, who captained the
1966 Alabama team which de
feated Nebraska in the Orange
Bowl, has never been associated
with a losing program.
"Like any new staff, we were
behind when fall practice
started. We had to spend time
finding the players and putting
them into the right positions,"
said Sherrill.
"We're a club of improvement,
a squad that will get better with
each game," he added.
The Cougars can't get much
worse.

who broke a 79-yard run against
Idaho last year, has taken over
Doornink's old tailback spot.
Gillum, a 9.8 sprinter, has
gained 62-yards on nine carries
this year.
Poor rushing
But the Cougar rushing game
hasn't exactly baffled opponents
this year. Washington State has
gained just 191 yards on the
ground so far.
It's understandable when you
have an offensive line as inex
perienced as Washington
State's. The Cougars start just
one senior up front. Bob Hill,
who started every game at left
guard last year, is Sherrill's only
experienced offensive lineman.
The new coach put 12
freshmen on the traveling squad
and only two seniors in starting
positions. Only nine seniors dot
the roster.
"We've made some progress
and some of our younger players
are coming to the front," said
Sherrill. "However we still do
not have the consistency we
need, especially on offense."
Consistent performance
The Cougars have gotten a
consistent performance from

junior wide receiver Mike
Levenseller, who ranks first
in conference pass receiving
statistics.
Levenseller has hauled down
18 passes for 329 yards. In
Washington State's 35-16 open
ing loss to Kansas, he hauled
down six passes for 111 yards,
including a long gainer of 41
yards.
But while the Cougars have
heen flying through the air, op
ponents have been speeding
right through a porous WSU de
fense on the ground.
WSU have surrendered 762
yards rushing in their first two
games, to rank last in conference
rushing defense statistics. The
Cougars also occupy the cellar in
team defense statistics, giving
up 944 yards.
Sherrill installed a new de
fense, using a five-man front and
two linebackers. WSU has only
one senior, right tackle Tim
Ochs, starting on defense.
Motivation
But the first-year coach, a mas
ter of motivation, will probably
find a way to put together his
troubled defense. Once, when
Pitt was scheduled to play
Florida State's Seminoles, Sher
rill went to practice wearing an
Indian outfit.
Majors, who was in on the
joke, then whipped out a cap pis
tol and shot him.
Sherrill, who captained the
1966 Alabama team which de
feated Nebraska in the Orange
Bowl, has never been associated
with a losing program.
"Like any new staff, we were
behind when fall practice
started. We had to spend time
finding the players and putting
them into the right positions,"
said Sherrill.
"We're a club of improvement,
a squad that will get better with
each game," he added.
The Cougars can't get much
worse.

State. _ ~ .

A Spokane, Wash., newspaper
is holding a contest asking read
ers to guess whether
Washington State All-Pacific-8
punter Cavin Hedrick can punt
the ball over the Spokane Col
iseum.
Hedrick's chances are about as
good as the Cougars' prospects
for success in the Pac-8.
First-year WSU coach Jackie
Sherrill, who came to remote
Pullman after spending seven
years assisting Johnny Majors at
the University of Pittsburgh,
said it would take three games to
evaluate WSU.

The Cougars, who have been
waiting for next year ever since
Halley's comet, should wait
until 1980. Then WSU should
have one of the most experi
enced squads in the Pac-8. Or the
Big Sky.
Washington State is helping
Pac-8 officials find reasons for
reorganizing the league every
weekend. The Cougars have a
chance to win this Saturday.
They're playing undefeated
Idaho.
WSU is so young that the team
trainers don't have to worry
about shaving a player's leg
when they tape ankles. Sherrill
calls WSU the "Kiddie Corps."
And they've been playing
football like a "Kiddie Show."
Sherrill, who didn't have to
worry about throwing the ball
last year at Pitt, with Heisman
Trophy candidate Tony Dorsett

in the backfield, has ordered
Cougar quarterbacks John Hop
kins and Jack Thompson to
throw the ball.
At least he knows where it is.
But if you think Card coach
Jack Christiansen has a quarter
back problem, then Sherril 1 has a
dilemma.
Quarterback problem
Do you start Thompson, who
has thrown for 219 yards on 21 of
42 passes? Or do you go with
Hopkins, the senior, who has
thrown for 238 yards, complet
ing 14 of 23 for two touchdowns?
Sherrill has been alternating
his quarterbacks and he's having
as much success as California
did when Mike White alternated
Steve Bartkowski and Vince
Feragamo a couple of years back.
When WSU isn't putting the
ball up for grabs (the Cougars
threw five interceptions in their
first two games) fullback Dan
Doornink is getting hit behind
the line of scrimmage.
Doornink, who set a school
sophomore rushing record of
607 yards rushing last year at
tailback, has carried 20 times for
103 yards this season. He scored
the Cougars'only touchdown on
the ground.
Sophomore Harold Gillum,

teams, the Daily looks at
Washington State and Oregon
State. _ ~ .

A Spokane, Wash., newspaper
is holding a contest asking read
ers to guess whether
Washington State All-Pacific-8
punter Cavin Hedrick can punt
the ball over the Spokane Col
iseum.
Hedrick's chances are about as
good as the Cougars' prospects
for success in the Pac-8.
First-year WSU coach Jackie
Sherrill, who came to remote
Pullman after spending seven
years assisting Johnny Majors at
the University of Pittsburgh,
said it would take three games to
evaluate WSU.
Kansas 35, Washington State
16.
Minnesota 28, Washington
State 14.

Wisconsin 35, Washington
State 26.
The Cougars, who have been
waiting for next year ever since
Halley's comet, should wait
until 1980. Then WSU should
have one of the most experi
enced squads in the Pac-8. Or the
Big Sky.
Washington State is helping
Pac-8 officials find reasons for
reorganizing the league every
weekend. The Cougars have a
chance to win this Saturday.
They're playing undefeated
Idaho.
WSU is so young that the team
trainers don't have to worry
about shaving a player's leg
when they tape ankles. Sherrill
calls WSU the "Kiddie Corps."
And they've been playing
football like a "Kiddie Show."
Sherrill, who didn't have to
worry about throwing the ball
last year at Pitt, with Heisman
Trophy candidate Tony Dorsett

in the backfield, has ordered
Cougar quarterbacks John Hop
kins and Jack Thompson to
throw the ball.
At least he knows where it is.
But if you think Card coach
Jack Christiansen has a quarter
back problem, then Sherril 1 has a
dilemma.
Quarterback problem
Do you start Thompson, who
has thrown for 219 yards on 21 of
42 passes? Or do you go with
Hopkins, the senior, who has
thrown for 238 yards, complet
ing 14 of 23 for two touchdowns?
Sherrill has been alternating
his quarterbacks and he's having
as much success as California
did when Mike White alternated
Steve Bartkowski and Vince
Feragamo a couple of years back.
When WSU isn't putting the
ball up for grabs (the Cougars
threw five interceptions in their
first two games) fullback Dan
Doornink is getting hit behind
the line of scrimmage.
Doornink, who set a school
sophomore rushing record of
607 yards rushing last year at
tailback, has carried 20 times for
103 yards this season. He scored
the Cougars'only touchdown on
the ground.
Sophomore Harold Gillum,
who broke a 79-yard run against
Idaho last year, has taken over
Doornink's old tailback spot.
Gillum, a 9.8 sprinter, has
gained 62-yards on nine carries
this year.
Poor rushing
But the Cougar rushing game
hasn't exactly baffled opponents
this year. Washington State has
gained just 191 yards on the
ground so far.
It's understandable when you
have an offensive line as inex
perienced as Washington
State's. The Cougars start just
one senior up front. Bob Hill,
who started every game at left
guard last year, is Sherrill's only
experienced offensive lineman.
The new coach put 12
freshmen on the traveling squad
and only two seniors in starting
positions. Only nine seniors dot
the roster.
"We've made some progress
and some of our younger players
are coming to the front," said
Sherrill. "However we still do
not have the consistency we
need, especially on offense."
Consistent performance
The Cougars have gotten a
consistent performance from

junior wide receiver Mike
Levenseller, who ranks first
in conference pass receiving
statistics.
Levenseller has hauled down
18 passes for 329 yards. In
Washington State's 35-16 open
ing loss to Kansas, he hauled
down six passes for 111 yards,
including a long gainer of 41
yards.
But while the Cougars have
heen flying through the air, op
ponents have been speeding
right through a porous WSU de
fense on the ground.
WSU have surrendered 762
yards rushing in their first two
games, to rank last in conference
rushing defense statistics. The
Cougars also occupy the cellar in
team defense statistics, giving
up 944 yards.
Sherrill installed a new de
fense, using a five-man front and
two linebackers. WSU has only
one senior, right tackle Tim
Ochs, starting on defense.
Motivation
But the first-year coach, a mas
ter of motivation, will probably
find a way to put together his
troubled defense. Once, when
Pitt was scheduled to play
Florida State's Seminoles, Sher
rill went to practice wearing an
Indian outfit.
Majors, who was in on the
joke, then whipped out a cap pis
tol and shot him.
Sherrill, who captained the
1966 Alabama team which de
feated Nebraska in the Orange
Bowl, has never been associated
with a losing program.
"Like any new staff, we were
behind when fall practice
started. We had to spend time
finding the players and putting
them into the right positions,"
said Sherrill.
"We're a club of improvement,
a squad that will get better with
each game," he added.
The Cougars can't get much
worse.
