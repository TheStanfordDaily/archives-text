Syria begins new drive in Lebanon
Beirut — Syrian forces launched an offensive
against Palestinian guerrilla and leftist Lebanese
positions east of Beirut, and Damascus radio
claimed early today they had cleared all
Palestinian-leftist elements from the country's
Christian enclave.
Details of the action were sketchy. Conflicting
statements were issued about the objectives of the
Syrian offensive.
Damascus said the Syrians acted because the
other side refused to negotiate a settlement and
undertook provocations in the area under attack.
In Cairo, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
charged that the Syrian attack was an attempt to
destroy the Palestinian movement and shatter Arab
efforts to end the war. He warned that Syria "will
never escape the punishment of history."
A Syrian military spokesman in Damascus said
the Syrian forces had gone into action to clean up
Palestinian positions "disrupting order and peace
in Lebanon."
Pound plummets to record low
London — Britain's battered pound, worth $4.80
at the end of World War 11, plunged V/ 2 more certts
against the dollar yesterday and closed at a record
low of $1.63. The slide, bad news for the Labor
government, was a boon for some foreign tourists.
In a tough speech to Laborites meeting at
Blackpool, Prime Minister James Callaghan said
Britain could no longer live on borrowed time and
money and had to start earning its way in the world.
As holders of sterling sold the British currency at
lower and lower prices, Chancellor of the Ex
chequer Denis Healey made a dramatic dash from
London airport back to his office, missing a
scheduled flight to Hong Kong for a British Com
monwealth finance ministers' meeting. News of
Healey's action halted the pound's slide, and it
closed at $1.6360. There was no word of what
Healey would do, however, to halt the slide.
Britain's industrial productivity is now among
t lie lowest of major Western nations, its inflation is
among the highest at 13.8 per cent, and it is suffer
ing record-high unemployment of 6.2 per cent.
All that is likely to get worse if the pound's slide
continues because Britain imports more than half
its food and raw materials, which now cost more,
thereby slowing hopes of recovery from the na
tion's worst recession since the war.
Ford readies for next debate
Washington — President Ford polished his
foreign policy image yesterday and his chief
spokesman refused to answer questions about
Ford's use of campaign funds in his home district

when he was a congressman.
As the President met with the first of a parade of
foreign ministers in advance of his foreign-policy
debate with Jimmy Carter, White House Press Sec
retary Ron Nessen declined to say whether Ford
had illegally converted campaign funds to his per
sonal use.
"You know that I'm not going to answer that
question . . . because it suggests that there is a need
to answer it — that something like that has been
charged," Nessen said.
There have been reports the Watergate special
prosecutor is investigating whether Ford converted
campaign funds to his own use through a local
Republican party organization in Michigan while
he was in the House of Representatives.
At the same time, Nessen was asked about the
President's acceptance of golfing hospitality. He
said Ford played on three courses operated by cor
porations while he was a congressman. Nessen said
he does not know if the companies paid the Presi
dent's expenses.
Irish peace advocates to visit U.S.
Belfast — Two leaders of Northern Ireland's wo
men's peace movement said yesterday they will
take their crusade to the United States next week to
plead anew with Americans to stop sending money
that, the women say, fuels terrorism.
Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan, cofoun
ders of the nonpartisan and nonsectarian six
week-old movement, said they will fly Monday to
Buffalo, N.Y., at the invitation of the Public Broad
casting System (PBS).
Mrs. Williams said that they will appeal in a
nationwide telecast to Irish Americans to cut off the

flow of funds that they claim supports the Roman
Catholic and Protestant gunmen waging terror war
fare in Northern Ireland. She and Miss Corrigan are
Catholic, but their movement includes both Protes
tants and Catholics.
"The people who give the money have no idea
about where it goes," Mrs. Williams said. "They are
third-generation American Irish. They have just no
idea about what is going on over here."
Britain and Ireland have frequently alleged that
Irish-Americans send money to Northern Ireland
thinking it will be used for rehabilitation. In fact,
officials say, the major recipient is the IRA.
Whites frightened in South Africa
Johannesburg — Fear pervades this white-ruled
land as never before. After months of black riots and
strikes, some white South Africans are looking for
new homes abroad. Others are buying guns and
digging in.
There are no government figures on whites leav
ing South Africa to settle elsewhere, but there is
growing talk among some of them of trying to make
new lives in Canada, the United States, Britain or
Australia. In Rhodesia, the white exodus is at a
record level.
For South Africans not thinking of leaving their
homeland, gun training courses and shooting gal
leries are becoming increasingly popular.
Volunteer civil defense organizations are being
mobilized and widely publicized on the state
owned television network. Whites are learning first
aid, how to fight fires and protect their homes.
"Panicky reflex actions are building up," warned
the Johannesburg Star recently in an editorial.
"Among some whites, understanding and
generosity are giving way to baser instincts of re
venge and survival," the editorial said.
UMW president rebuffed by union
Cincinnati — The man who brought democracy
to the United Mine Workers union and now says he
needs more power to bring peace to the nation's
coalfields was rebuffed by delegates to the UMW
convention yesterday in a change of presidential
election dates.
Arnold Miller, the 54-year-old disabled miner
from West Virginia who deposed the dictatorial
W.A. "Tony" Boyle in 1971, urged the 1800 dele
gates to the union's 47th constitutional convention
to approve an early 1977 election date that would
not interfere with contract negotiations.
But delegates rejected that proposal, voting to
approve the Constitution and Grievance Commit
tee's resolution to hold the election in June, 1977.

Syria begins new drive in Lebanon
Beirut — Syrian forces launched an offensive
against Palestinian guerrilla and leftist Lebanese
positions east of Beirut, and Damascus radio
claimed early today they had cleared all
Palestinian-leftist elements from the country's
Christian enclave.
Details of the action were sketchy. Conflicting
statements were issued about the objectives of the
Syrian offensive.
Damascus said the Syrians acted because the
other side refused to negotiate a settlement and
undertook provocations in the area under attack.
In Cairo, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
charged that the Syrian attack was an attempt to
destroy the Palestinian movement and shatter Arab
efforts to end the war. He warned that Syria "will
never escape the punishment of history."
A Syrian military spokesman in Damascus said
the Syrian forces had gone into action to clean up
Palestinian positions "disrupting order and peace
in Lebanon."
Pound plummets to record low
London — Britain's battered pound, worth $4.80
at the end of World War 11, plunged V/ 2 more certts
against the dollar yesterday and closed at a record
low of $1.63. The slide, bad news for the Labor
government, was a boon for some foreign tourists.
In a tough speech to Laborites meeting at
Blackpool, Prime Minister James Callaghan said
Britain could no longer live on borrowed time and
money and had to start earning its way in the world.
As holders of sterling sold the British currency at
lower and lower prices, Chancellor of the Ex
chequer Denis Healey made a dramatic dash from
London airport back to his office, missing a
scheduled flight to Hong Kong for a British Com
monwealth finance ministers' meeting. News of
Healey's action halted the pound's slide, and it
closed at $1.6360. There was no word of what
Healey would do, however, to halt the slide.
Britain's industrial productivity is now among
t lie lowest of major Western nations, its inflation is
among the highest at 13.8 per cent, and it is suffer
ing record-high unemployment of 6.2 per cent.
All that is likely to get worse if the pound's slide
continues because Britain imports more than half
its food and raw materials, which now cost more,
thereby slowing hopes of recovery from the na
tion's worst recession since the war.
Ford readies for next debate
Washington — President Ford polished his
foreign policy image yesterday and his chief
spokesman refused to answer questions about
Ford's use of campaign funds in his home district

when he was a congressman.
As the President met with the first of a parade of
foreign ministers in advance of his foreign-policy
debate with Jimmy Carter, White House Press Sec
retary Ron Nessen declined to say whether Ford
had illegally converted campaign funds to his per
sonal use.
"You know that I'm not going to answer that
question . . . because it suggests that there is a need
to answer it — that something like that has been
charged," Nessen said.
There have been reports the Watergate special
prosecutor is investigating whether Ford converted
campaign funds to his own use through a local
Republican party organization in Michigan while
he was in the House of Representatives.
At the same time, Nessen was asked about the
President's acceptance of golfing hospitality. He
said Ford played on three courses operated by cor
porations while he was a congressman. Nessen said
he does not know if the companies paid the Presi
dent's expenses.
Irish peace advocates to visit U.S.
Belfast — Two leaders of Northern Ireland's wo
men's peace movement said yesterday they will
take their crusade to the United States next week to
plead anew with Americans to stop sending money
that, the women say, fuels terrorism.
Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan, cofoun
ders of the nonpartisan and nonsectarian six
week-old movement, said they will fly Monday to
Buffalo, N.Y., at the invitation of the Public Broad
casting System (PBS).
Mrs. Williams said that they will appeal in a
nationwide telecast to Irish Americans to cut off the

flow of funds that they claim supports the Roman
Catholic and Protestant gunmen waging terror war
fare in Northern Ireland. She and Miss Corrigan are
Catholic, but their movement includes both Protes
tants and Catholics.
"The people who give the money have no idea
about where it goes," Mrs. Williams said. "They are
third-generation American Irish. They have just no
idea about what is going on over here."
Britain and Ireland have frequently alleged that
Irish-Americans send money to Northern Ireland
thinking it will be used for rehabilitation. In fact,
officials say, the major recipient is the IRA.
Whites frightened in South Africa
Johannesburg — Fear pervades this white-ruled
land as never before. After months of black riots and
strikes, some white South Africans are looking for
new homes abroad. Others are buying guns and
digging in.
There are no government figures on whites leav
ing South Africa to settle elsewhere, but there is
growing talk among some of them of trying to make
new lives in Canada, the United States, Britain or
Australia. In Rhodesia, the white exodus is at a
record level.
For South Africans not thinking of leaving their
homeland, gun training courses and shooting gal
leries are becoming increasingly popular.
Volunteer civil defense organizations are being
mobilized and widely publicized on the state
owned television network. Whites are learning first
aid, how to fight fires and protect their homes.
"Panicky reflex actions are building up," warned
the Johannesburg Star recently in an editorial.
"Among some whites, understanding and
generosity are giving way to baser instincts of re
venge and survival," the editorial said.
UMW president rebuffed by union
Cincinnati — The man who brought democracy
to the United Mine Workers union and now says he
needs more power to bring peace to the nation's
coalfields was rebuffed by delegates to the UMW
convention yesterday in a change of presidential
election dates.
Arnold Miller, the 54-year-old disabled miner
from West Virginia who deposed the dictatorial
W.A. "Tony" Boyle in 1971, urged the 1800 dele
gates to the union's 47th constitutional convention
to approve an early 1977 election date that would
not interfere with contract negotiations.
But delegates rejected that proposal, voting to
approve the Constitution and Grievance Commit

approve the Constitution and Grievance Commit
tee's resolution to hold the election in June, 1977.

Syria begins new drive in Lebanon
Beirut — Syrian forces launched an offensive
against Palestinian guerrilla and leftist Lebanese
positions east of Beirut, and Damascus radio
claimed early today they had cleared all
Palestinian-leftist elements from the country's
Christian enclave.
Details of the action were sketchy. Conflicting
statements were issued about the objectives of the
Syrian offensive.
Damascus said the Syrians acted because the
other side refused to negotiate a settlement and
undertook provocations in the area under attack.
In Cairo, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
charged that the Syrian attack was an attempt to
destroy the Palestinian movement and shatter Arab
efforts to end the war. He warned that Syria "will
never escape the punishment of history."
A Syrian military spokesman in Damascus said
the Syrian forces had gone into action to clean up
Palestinian positions "disrupting order and peace
in Lebanon."
Pound plummets to record low
London — Britain's battered pound, worth $4.80
at the end of World War 11, plunged V/ 2 more certts
against the dollar yesterday and closed at a record
low of $1.63. The slide, bad news for the Labor
government, was a boon for some foreign tourists.
In a tough speech to Laborites meeting at
Blackpool, Prime Minister James Callaghan said
Britain could no longer live on borrowed time and
money and had to start earning its way in the world.
As holders of sterling sold the British currency at
lower and lower prices, Chancellor of the Ex
chequer Denis Healey made a dramatic dash from
London airport back to his office, missing a
scheduled flight to Hong Kong for a British Com
monwealth finance ministers' meeting. News of
Healey's action halted the pound's slide, and it
closed at $1.6360. There was no word of what
Healey would do, however, to halt the slide.
Britain's industrial productivity is now among
t lie lowest of major Western nations, its inflation is
among the highest at 13.8 per cent, and it is suffer
ing record-high unemployment of 6.2 per cent.
All that is likely to get worse if the pound's slide
continues because Britain imports more than half
its food and raw materials, which now cost more,
thereby slowing hopes of recovery from the na
tion's worst recession since the war.
Ford readies for next debate
Washington — President Ford polished his
foreign policy image yesterday and his chief
spokesman refused to answer questions about
Ford's use of campaign funds in his home district

when he was a congressman.
As the President met with the first of a parade of
foreign ministers in advance of his foreign-policy
debate with Jimmy Carter, White House Press Sec
retary Ron Nessen declined to say whether Ford
had illegally converted campaign funds to his per
sonal use.
"You know that I'm not going to answer that
question . . . because it suggests that there is a need
to answer it — that something like that has been
charged," Nessen said.
There have been reports the Watergate special
prosecutor is investigating whether Ford converted
campaign funds to his own use through a local
Republican party organization in Michigan while
he was in the House of Representatives.
At the same time, Nessen was asked about the
President's acceptance of golfing hospitality. He
said Ford played on three courses operated by cor
porations while he was a congressman. Nessen said
he does not know if the companies paid the Presi
dent's expenses.
Irish peace advocates to visit U.S.
Belfast — Two leaders of Northern Ireland's wo
men's peace movement said yesterday they will
take their crusade to the United States next week to
plead anew with Americans to stop sending money
that, the women say, fuels terrorism.
Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan, cofoun
ders of the nonpartisan and nonsectarian six
week-old movement, said they will fly Monday to
Buffalo, N.Y., at the invitation of the Public Broad
casting System (PBS).
Mrs. Williams said that they will appeal in a
nationwide telecast to Irish Americans to cut off the

flow of funds that they claim supports the Roman
Catholic and Protestant gunmen waging terror war
fare in Northern Ireland. She and Miss Corrigan are
Catholic, but their movement includes both Protes
tants and Catholics.
"The people who give the money have no idea
about where it goes," Mrs. Williams said. "They are
third-generation American Irish. They have just no
idea about what is going on over here."
Britain and Ireland have frequently alleged that
Irish-Americans send money to Northern Ireland
thinking it will be used for rehabilitation. In fact,
officials say, the major recipient is the IRA.
Whites frightened in South Africa
Johannesburg — Fear pervades this white-ruled
land as never before. After months of black riots and
strikes, some white South Africans are looking for
new homes abroad. Others are buying guns and
digging in.
There are no government figures on whites leav
ing South Africa to settle elsewhere, but there is
growing talk among some of them of trying to make
new lives in Canada, the United States, Britain or
Australia. In Rhodesia, the white exodus is at a
record level.
For South Africans not thinking of leaving their
homeland, gun training courses and shooting gal
leries are becoming increasingly popular.
Volunteer civil defense organizations are being
mobilized and widely publicized on the state
owned television network. Whites are learning first
aid, how to fight fires and protect their homes.
"Panicky reflex actions are building up," warned
the Johannesburg Star recently in an editorial.
"Among some whites, understanding and
generosity are giving way to baser instincts of re
venge and survival," the editorial said.
UMW president rebuffed by union
Cincinnati — The man who brought democracy
to the United Mine Workers union and now says he
needs more power to bring peace to the nation's
coalfields was rebuffed by delegates to the UMW
convention yesterday in a change of presidential
election dates.
Arnold Miller, the 54-year-old disabled miner
from West Virginia who deposed the dictatorial
W.A. "Tony" Boyle in 1971, urged the 1800 dele
gates to the union's 47th constitutional convention
to approve an early 1977 election date that would
not interfere with contract negotiations.
But delegates rejected that proposal, voting to
approve the Constitution and Grievance Commit
