ing about a leak of secret information

network for 23 years.
Under suspension with pay since
last February, Schorr said in a letter to
CBS News President Richard Salant
th.it remaining with the network might
prove "a source of tension within the
organization."
Schorr said in an interview in
Washington that his immediate plans
were to accept a short-term professor
ship at a large university which he
would not name and to begin thinking
about writing a book.
In accepting the resignation, Salant
wished Schorr happiness in the future
and added:
"You will hereafter, of course, be
fully free to pursue whatever line of
endeavor you may choose — including
full time employment on another net
work. **
"I think I'm out of network televi
sion and commercial television for
good in any regular way," Schorr said.
"I'm not interested any more."
He said he's not disenchanted and
"I'm not criticizing television and I'm
certainly not criticizing television
journalism."
Schorr was suspended by CBS News
after he turned over a secret congres
sional report on the CIA to the Village
Voice, a Manhattan weekly news
paper. He went before the House
Ethics Committee last week but re
fused to reveal who gave him the re
port. on grounds that as a newsman he
had a right to keep his source confi
dential.
In reference to Schorr's appearance
before the committee. Salant wrote in
accepting the resignation:
"You did a superb and eloquent ser
vice to all of us in journalism and.
above all, to the principles of tin- First
Amendment and the public's right to
know."
