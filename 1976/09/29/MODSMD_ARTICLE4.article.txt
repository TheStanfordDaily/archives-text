# Government index falls
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The government said yesterday
that the index it uses to predict the future of the
economy has dropped for the first time si nee the start of
the current recovery.
But a government economist said the drop in the
index of leading indicators does not necessarily mean
that there will be a decline in the economy.
John Kendrick, chief economist for the Commerce
Department, said that most analysts consider a three
month trend essential before a drop in the index could
be interpreted as projecting a general economic
downturn.
"Most business cycle expansions have lasted at least
three years, so I don't think this one-month decrease
should be interpreted too negatively." Kendrick said.
"It would be very unusual, for the economy to fall out of
bed at this stage in the expansion."
Primary cause
The primary cause of the decline was the section of
the index which reflects on what President Ford calls
the crucial issue of job security.
TheCommerce Department said theindex fell 1.5 per
cent in August, with about a third of the drop attributa
ble to an increase in the layoff rate in manufacturing.
This rate rose to its highest level in nine months.
The drop in the index is based on preliminary esti
mates and could be substantially changed as more de
tailed figures are obtained. But it compares to a five
tenths of one per cent gain in July.
The August figure is the first drop since February
1975, and constitutes the largest drop since the 3.4 per
cent slide in January 1975.
Hopeful signs
Officials indicate that there are hopeful signs that the
index will turn around and increase again in Sep

They said these include business expectations of in
creased spending on plant and equipment over the
long term, last week's record growth in the money
supply and recent advances in stock prices.
Last night, the Atlanta headquarters of Democrat
Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign, issued this reac
tion to the Commerce Department report:
Recovery
"While Mr. Ford says he is proud of the economic
recovery, current economic indicators continue to
show that the economy is stuttering, faltering and too
weak to put our people back to work.
"Mr. Ford's message to the 7.5 million persons out of
work today is: wait awhile — maybe things will im
prove. I believe our waiting period must come to an
end. The Republicans have had their chance and failed
miserably."
In the statement, Carter called on Ford to sign a
$3.7-billion appropriation for public works jobs.
Ford has said a better way is to stimulate private
business so it will hire more workers.
Trouble
What could be more troublesome for Ford's election
hopes than the overall index, which is composed of a
dozen individual statistics, is the job market statistic.
The Labor Department also reported yesterday that,
after adjustment for seasonal variation, 1.5 per cent of
the people at work in manufacturing were laid off in
August.
The statistic is crucial because the President has dis
counted three consecutive months of rising un
employment by citing tandem increases in total
employment. He and his advisers feel he can win the
election despite rising unemployment as long as
people already at work feel secure that they aren't in
danger of being laid off.

Washington (AP) — The government said yesterday
that the index it uses to predict the future of the
economy has dropped for the first time si nee the start of
the current recovery.
But a government economist said the drop in the
index of leading indicators does not necessarily mean
that there will be a decline in the economy.
John Kendrick, chief economist for the Commerce
Department, said that most analysts consider a three
month trend essential before a drop in the index could
be interpreted as projecting a general economic
downturn.
"Most business cycle expansions have lasted at least
three years, so I don't think this one-month decrease
should be interpreted too negatively." Kendrick said.
"It would be very unusual, for the economy to fall out of
bed at this stage in the expansion."
Primary cause
The primary cause of the decline was the section of
the index which reflects on what President Ford calls
the crucial issue of job security.
TheCommerce Department said theindex fell 1.5 per
cent in August, with about a third of the drop attributa
ble to an increase in the layoff rate in manufacturing.
This rate rose to its highest level in nine months.
The drop in the index is based on preliminary esti
mates and could be substantially changed as more de
tailed figures are obtained. But it compares to a five
tenths of one per cent gain in July.
The August figure is the first drop since February
1975, and constitutes the largest drop since the 3.4 per
cent slide in January 1975.
Hopeful signs
Officials indicate that there are hopeful signs that the
index will turn around and increase again in Sep

They said these include business expectations of in
creased spending on plant and equipment over the
long term, last week's record growth in the money
supply and recent advances in stock prices.
Last night, the Atlanta headquarters of Democrat
Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign, issued this reac
tion to the Commerce Department report:
Recovery
"While Mr. Ford says he is proud of the economic
recovery, current economic indicators continue to
show that the economy is stuttering, faltering and too
weak to put our people back to work.
"Mr. Ford's message to the 7.5 million persons out of
work today is: wait awhile — maybe things will im
prove. I believe our waiting period must come to an
end. The Republicans have had their chance and failed
miserably."
In the statement, Carter called on Ford to sign a
$3.7-billion appropriation for public works jobs.
Ford has said a better way is to stimulate private
business so it will hire more workers.
Trouble
What could be more troublesome for Ford's election
hopes than the overall index, which is composed of a
dozen individual statistics, is the job market statistic.
The Labor Department also reported yesterday that,
after adjustment for seasonal variation, 1.5 per cent of
the people at work in manufacturing were laid off in
August.
The statistic is crucial because the President has dis
counted three consecutive months of rising un
employment by citing tandem increases in total
employment. He and his advisers feel he can win the
election despite rising unemployment as long as
people already at work feel secure that they aren't in
danger of being laid off.
