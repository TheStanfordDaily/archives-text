# USE members veto strike; threat of 'chaos' by Hardy
## 
### Dan Fiduccia Bonny Rodden 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
members came within 37 votes of cal
ling for a strike against the university
yesterday.
When the strike ballots were tabu
lated, 538 members, or 62.2 percent,
had voted for a strike and 327 had
voted against. However, union by
laws mandate that two-thirds of those
voting must vote for a strike before a
strike can be called.
When the vote was announced in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium before about
700 USE members, cries of "manage
ment pigs" and "boo" filled the room.
USE President Roger Hardy said he
could not interpret the vote as mean
ing that union members "were eager
not to go out, were scared or poor" or
"maybe the union's demands were not
high enough."
Hardy told union members that even
though they weren't in a strike situa
tion for the time being, other action
against the university could still be ta
ken.
"We can threaten (university chief
negotiator' Douglas) Barton with
chaos, and that's worse than a strike,"
said Hardy, reminding the members
that "slow downs, stall-outs" and
other tactics could be used. The union
contract expired Aug. 31.
Hardy reiterated he would not sign
the current proposed contract, and if
union members wanted that contract
signed they would "have to get
another candidate for president."
Hardy said the union negotiating
team would go back to negotiating

with the university with "the 62.2 per
cent mandate" they had just received.
The university has offered the union
a three-year contract which would
give employes a 7.5 percent raise the
first year,a 5.5 percent raise the second
year and 5 percent raise the third year.
This would include cost of living al
lowances, if the cost of living in the
Bay Area were to rise sharply.
The union has demanded a 14 per
cent increase the first year and a seven
percent increase during the second
year. The union also wants a cost of
living allowance and some form of a
benefits plan, which would be either a
dental plan for union members, an ex
tension of the health insurance be
nefits to include all dependents of
union members or substantial pension
improvements.
Barton said he was a bit surprised at
the strike vote.

"1 guess I expected they would gain
authorization to strike," said Barton.
Barton said the vote "really doesn't
change the university's position — it's
an internal union matter."
"We'll continue to meet for resolu
tion" of the differences, added Barton.
Barton said the negotiations are
"quite different" than two years ago
when USE went on strike. He said after
negotiating for six months the two par
ties did not agree on a single issue
while after two months this year the
university and the union have resol
ved a number of issues.
He noted that representatives from
both sides have agreed on grievance
procedures, vacation and sick leave
and safety and working conditions. He
added that the major issues still pend
ing include wage and benefits, job
classification and agency versus union
shop.

an internal union matter."
"We'll continue to meet for resolu
tion" of the differences, added Barton.
Barton said the negotiations are
"quite different" than two years ago
when USE went on strike. He said after
negotiating for six months the two par
ties did not agree on a single issue
while after two months this year the
university and the union have resol
ved a number of issues.
He noted that representatives from
both sides have agreed on grievance
procedures, vacation and sick leave
and safety and working conditions. He
added that the major issues still pend
ing include wage and benefits, job
classification and agency versus union
shop.

Roger Hardy looks over the shoulders of these diligent USE union mem
bers as they take on the tedious task of opening ballot envelopes.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
members came within 37 votes of cal
ling for a strike against the university
yesterday.
When the strike ballots were tabu
lated, 538 members, or 62.2 percent,
had voted for a strike and 327 had
voted against. However, union by
laws mandate that two-thirds of those
voting must vote for a strike before a
strike can be called.
When the vote was announced in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium before about
700 USE members, cries of "manage
ment pigs" and "boo" filled the room.
USE President Roger Hardy said he
could not interpret the vote as mean
ing that union members "were eager
not to go out, were scared or poor" or
"maybe the union's demands were not
high enough."
Hardy told union members that even
though they weren't in a strike situa
tion for the time being, other action
against the university could still be ta
ken.
"We can threaten (university chief
negotiator' Douglas) Barton with
chaos, and that's worse than a strike,"
said Hardy, reminding the members
that "slow downs, stall-outs" and
other tactics could be used. The union
contract expired Aug. 31.
Hardy reiterated he would not sign
the current proposed contract, and if
union members wanted that contract
signed they would "have to get
another candidate for president."
Hardy said the union negotiating
team would go back to negotiating

with the university with "the 62.2 per
cent mandate" they had just received.
The university has offered the union
a three-year contract which would
give employes a 7.5 percent raise the
first year,a 5.5 percent raise the second
year and 5 percent raise the third year.
This would include cost of living al
lowances, if the cost of living in the
Bay Area were to rise sharply.
The union has demanded a 14 per
cent increase the first year and a seven
percent increase during the second
year. The union also wants a cost of
living allowance and some form of a
benefits plan, which would be either a
dental plan for union members, an ex
tension of the health insurance be
nefits to include all dependents of
union members or substantial pension
improvements.
Barton said he was a bit surprised at
the strike vote.

"1 guess I expected they would gain
authorization to strike," said Barton.
Barton said the vote "really doesn't
change the university's position — it's
an internal union matter."
"We'll continue to meet for resolu
tion" of the differences, added Barton.
