# AN beats Norton, retains world title

New York (AP) — Muhammad Ali,
calling on every trick he has learned in
his long and controversial career,
pounded out a unanimous 15-round
decision over Ken Norton last night
and retained his world heavyweight
championship.
The 34-year-old Ali, sometimes
floating like the butterfly he has brag
ged about, other times stinging like a
bee with solid jabs and short right
leads, seemed to control the tempo
from the outset although Norton kept
moving forward and landed the harder
punches.
Ali even resorted to the rope-a-dope
defense he used when he wrestled the
title away from George Foreman.
There was only one thing he did not
do. He did not destroy Norton as he
predicted he would do.
Referee Arthur Mercante scored the
fight 8-6-1 for Ali while judges Harold
Lederman and Barney Smith each had
it 8-7 for Ali.
The Associated Press had it 9-6 for
the champion.

Norton now has gone 39 tough
rounds with the man who proclaims
himself the greatest fighter of all time.
The defeat probably wrote an end to
Norton's boxing career. At 31, movies
seem to be more in his future than
fights.
The victory enabled Ali to end this
rough-tough series the same way he
closed out his historic series of three
bouts with Joe Frazier — an opening
loss and then two victories.
And Ali's final victories over Frazier
and Norton came as champion. "I'm at
the end of my career," he said before
the fight. "1 can't lose it now."
The win. Ali's 19th in 20 champion
ship fights, earned him at least $6 mill
ion and set up a possible $10-million
match with George Foreman sometime
next year.
Ali was to get 50 per cent of all re
venue over $9 million, but it was not
known what the final financial figure
would be. Norton was guaranteed $1
million and five per cent of all re
venue.
