# Turkish withdrawal needed on Cyprus

Los Angeles Times

The ancient hatreds that have frus
trated peacemaking on Cyprus have
boiled up again in the U.S. Congress,
and the prospects for peace on that
tormented island are probably worse
for it. Congress has been resisting a
new four-year defense cooperation ag
reement between the United States,
and Turkey.
Nor have the chances for peace been
helped by the results of the Greek Cyp
riot election earlier this month. Arch
bishop Makarios' authority was
reinforced by the vote, which de
monstrated the popularity of his hard
line approach.
The Turkish Cypriots, in the north
ern part of Cyprus held by the Turkish
army since its invasion of July, 1974,
seem to be equally inflexible.
The 650,000 people of Cyprus are
partitioned; the Turkish minority is in
the north.where the Turkish armyholds
something like two-fifths of the land
for something like one-fifth of the
people.
Deeper poverty
More than land distribution is at
stake, however. Partition is a formula
that commits an already poor nation to
deeper poverty by fragmenting the
economy as well as the society.
It seems to us that a solution would
require a new constitution, with
guarantees for the rights of the Turkish
minority. A solution would also re
quire integration of the island and
withdrawal of the occupying Turkish
troops. But each is part of a puzzle,
with little agreement on which piece
should be put in place first.
In the United States, Greek-
Americans and Armenian-Americans
have historical reasons for opposing
Turkey's position, and these con
stituencies have encouraged Congress
to try to intervene in the settlement by
pressuring Turkey on the issue of arms
assistance.

The result so far has been retaliation:
Turkey closed American bases there.
The North Atlantic alliance has been
weakened. But Congress' intervention
has done nothing to advance the solu
tion of the Cyprus problem.
Resentment of Turkey's continued
occupation of northern Cyprus is un
derstandable. Indeed, many Turks
would acknowledge that Ankara's
hard position is the result of the fragil
ity of its goverment, and would
acknowledge that change might come
only if a stronger government emerged
from the next election.
But it cannot be overlooked that the
Creeks, under the colonels, created the
crisis by engineering a takeover of
Cyprus, and that the Creek Cypriots
themselves, in their unwillingness to
enter good-faith negotiations in
Ceneva in August, 1974, helped pro
voke the Turks to enlarge their inva
sion from a beachhead to the conquest
of the entire north.
No more inclined
And the campaign of the Greek Cyp
riot parliamentary elections this
month left the impression that they are
no more inclined now than then to
consider the rights of the Turkish
minority.
A just settlement in Cyprus is most
likely to emerge from the normaliza
tion of American relations both with
Turkey and Greece. That is the course
set by President Ford, but repeatedly
upset by Congress. It is a course essen
tial to the continued vitality of the At
lantic alliance as well.
But it is a course that will be hard for
America to follow as long as members
of Congress seek to impose their judg
ments of what is right on this island in
the eastern Mediterranean.

withdrawal of the occupying Turkish
troops. But each is part of a puzzle,
with little agreement on which piece
should be put in place first.
In the United States, Greek-
Americans and Armenian-Americans
have historical reasons for opposing
Turkey's position, and these con
stituencies have encouraged Congress
to try to intervene in the settlement by
pressuring Turkey on the issue of arms
assistance.

The result so far has been retaliation:
Turkey closed American bases there.
The North Atlantic alliance has been
weakened. But Congress' intervention
has done nothing to advance the solu
tion of the Cyprus problem.
Resentment of Turkey's continued
occupation of northern Cyprus is un
derstandable. Indeed, many Turks
would acknowledge that Ankara's
hard position is the result of the fragil
ity of its goverment, and would
acknowledge that change might come
only if a stronger government emerged
from the next election.
But it cannot be overlooked that the
Creeks, under the colonels, created the
crisis by engineering a takeover of
Cyprus, and that the Creek Cypriots
themselves, in their unwillingness to
enter good-faith negotiations in
Ceneva in August, 1974, helped pro
voke the Turks to enlarge their inva
sion from a beachhead to the conquest
of the entire north.
No more inclined
And the campaign of the Greek Cyp
riot parliamentary elections this
month left the impression that they are
no more inclined now than then to
consider the rights of the Turkish
minority.
A just settlement in Cyprus is most
likely to emerge from the normaliza
tion of American relations both with
Turkey and Greece. That is the course
set by President Ford, but repeatedly
upset by Congress. It is a course essen
tial to the continued vitality of the At
lantic alliance as well.
But it is a course that will be hard for
America to follow as long as members
of Congress seek to impose their judg
ments of what is right on this island in
the eastern Mediterranean.

The ancient hatreds that have frus
trated peacemaking on Cyprus have
boiled up again in the U.S. Congress,
and the prospects for peace on that
tormented island are probably worse
for it. Congress has been resisting a
new four-year defense cooperation ag
reement between the United States,
and Turkey.
Nor have the chances for peace been
helped by the results of the Greek Cyp
riot election earlier this month. Arch
bishop Makarios' authority was
reinforced by the vote, which de
monstrated the popularity of his hard
line approach.
The Turkish Cypriots, in the north
ern part of Cyprus held by the Turkish
army since its invasion of July, 1974,
seem to be equally inflexible.
The 650,000 people of Cyprus are
partitioned; the Turkish minority is in
the north.where the Turkish armyholds
something like two-fifths of the land
for something like one-fifth of the
people.
Deeper poverty
More than land distribution is at
stake, however. Partition is a formula
that commits an already poor nation to
deeper poverty by fragmenting the
economy as well as the society.
It seems to us that a solution would
require a new constitution, with
guarantees for the rights of the Turkish
minority. A solution would also re
quire integration of the island and
withdrawal of the occupying Turkish
troops. But each is part of a puzzle,
