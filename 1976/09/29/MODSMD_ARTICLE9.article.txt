# Carter positions show courage, candor

The enigma that was Jimmy Carter
— and 1 emphasize "was" — took the
United States by storm the past year.
"" A relative unknown as the race for
the presidency began, he rolled
through the Democratic primaries as if
Frank Church, Henry Jackson, Morris
Udall, Jerry Brown and the quasi
candidate Hubert Humphrey weren't
even there. All that time, no one really
knew what he stood for.
Now that he is the final candidate of
t he Democrats, his stands on the issues
.ire becoming clearer. And they don't
sound too bad.
The only problem which seems to
plague Carter whenever he speaks on a
controversial subject is his candid
ness.This observer, however.is drawn
even more to the one-time Ceorgia
governor because of it.
Carter is refreshingly open and hon
est. Whenever a question is asked,
either from a reporter or from a person
in a crowd, Carter takes the time to
answer in plain language that can be
understood by all.
This man does not feed the public
speeches full of catchy cliches or com
posed of eloquent and meaningless
political rhetoric.
Examples
Good examples have been plentiful
during Carter's campaign, but one in
cident which stands out was the con
frontation with a worker concerning

abortion.
It occurred immediately after Carter
had become embroiled in the abortion
issue. He did not support abortion, but
was unwilling to introduce an
amendment to outlaw it. He was walk
ing through a crowd at an industrial
plant, doing the usual amount of
handshaking, when a burly young
man stepped forward and questioned
Carter about his abortion stand.
No one jumped between Carter and
the man. The candidate didn't turn his
back on him and walk away. He stood
there and took the time to talk to the
man and hear him out.
Nowadays, the emphasis during a
political campaign is to see as many
people as is possible in as little time as
possible. A candidate taking a lengthy
period of time to talk with one of his
future constituents is rare. Yet, Carter
has taken this action many times dur
ing his travels.
Openness perils
His "ethnic purity" gaffe, his abor
tion stand and the hassle over the just
released Playboy magazine interview,
where he admits to "lust," are all di
rect results of his openness. He isn't
trying to pawn himself off as a great
judge of humanity.
Other politicans should follow Car
ter's example. Many probably don't
because their secrets would make Car
ter look like a Sunday school teacher,

which he is anyway.
Carter's views on the issues follow
fairly close to the same methods he
used to run Georgia when he was gov
ernor. His basic plan is to tighten up
the government, streamlining it in a
sense.
Probably one of the more successful
ways of keeping government agencies
in check will be his proposal of making
these bureaucracies "temporary."
They would have either a one- or
two-year lease to conduct their respec
tive business. At the end of that period,
the agency would, in effect, have to
reapply for continuation.
These agencies would have to put
together a valid case showing that they
are needed and they are doing the job.
They would have to justify their re
quest for another term of operation.
This method is certain to keep agen
cies looking over their shoulders for
government inspectors and will prob
ably insure they will operate in their
proper capacity.
Better balance
Carter wants a better balance in our
economy, matching supply and de
mand. and desires to see both un
employment and inflation at an equal
four percent rate.
He does want to expand the
economy, but not through unneces
sary spending. A cutback on meaning
less government spending is a high
priority for Carter.
The budget is one area where Carter
has been criticized, not for his ideas,
but because they seem to be impossible
to institute. Many politicians have
laughed at Carter's budget plans as just
idealistic dreams that every President
would like to implement.
But his ideas are good and they are
going to be given a chance to work.
Carter would like to make the budget
zero-based. That is, he would strip
down the old budget and start from
scratch with the new one.
This would allow the aforemen
tioned plan — to make each agency in
government justify its existence —
work. Each agency and item on the
budget would be given a review to de
termine if the alloted funds were
needed.
Admittedly, it will bea tough plan to
make work. But Carter has his sights
set on it and is fighting to make it suc
cessful.

Carter's national food policy plan to
help control food prices is solid. This
plan will assure the consumer a
healthy supply of goods, at reasonable
prices, while avoiding shortages
which can drive prices higher.
Definite reserve
This would give the farmers a
chance to produce at almost maximum
pace with guaranteed buyers at fair
prices. Through his plan, a definite re
serve of agricultural products would
be maintained and will help to keep
prices from wild fluctuations.
The only weak point in Carter's
economic policy is his support of
wage-price controls. He maintains he
will not need them, but he would like
the option, if needed.
Carter is seeking to overhaul the U.S.
income tax system. He will eliminate
many deductions and tax shelters.
While this may increase taxes for
some people, it will lower the taxes for
the majority of the people: the middle
and low-income families.
To make the government accounta
ble for its actions, Carter proposes a
new lobby law, aimed at tightening up
the abuses which occur between lob
byists and politicians. He also wants
an audit of personal finances by all
personnel in the administration; the
implementation of the "Sunshine
Law," which would open all meetings
of federal boards, commissions and
agencies to the public; and total open
ness of the actions within the govern
ment to the public.
Most important to this subject, Car
ter would remove both the FBI and the
Attorney General from active politics.
Both will operate independent of any
government branch so as to eliminate
any conflicts of interest or considera
tions for past favors.
Carter would also like a national
health plan, guaranteeing health in
surance for all Americans and regulat
ing doctors' fees and hospital charges.
Headvocates registering all handguns;
having the federal government pay
more of the costs of welfare while not
taking it over completely; and passage
of the Equal Rights Amendment.
In all, Carter is proposing sweeping
changes in the federal government.
It's about time housecleaning was
done and Carter is the one to do it.
