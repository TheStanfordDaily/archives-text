pastime at Stanford. Last year the university spent a few thousand dollars in removing landscaping and
building a loading /.one for tin: Storke Building, corner of Santa Teresa and Lomita(above).However, the
placement of concrete blocks over the summer turned the loading zone into just another parker's dream.
