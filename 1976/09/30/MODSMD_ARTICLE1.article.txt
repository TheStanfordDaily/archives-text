# Gay rights policy urged
## 
### Steve Sulmeyer 
The Santa Clara County Human Re
lations Commission has endorsed a
proposal concerning nondiscrimina
tion on the basis of sexual preference
which is now being considered by the
university.
The policy, which was proposed
this May, requests a single statement
from the university assuring that it
would not discriminate against stu
dents, faculty or staff members on the
basis of race, sex, sexual orientation,
age, religion, national origin or physi
cal disability, except where the disa
bility was a "bonafide" criterion.
In a letter to Stanford President
Richard Lyman this month, Human
Relations Commission Director James
McEntree said that Stanford should
adopt "a simple, concise, nondis
crimination statement" rather than "a
number of policies scattered through
out university regulations, each cover
ing limited segments of the university
community."
The Gay Liaison Task Force of the
Human Relations Commission has ex
pressed concern about "the universi
ty's reluctance to include students in a
human rights policy."
Though the Dean of Students has as
serted that discrimination by the uni
versity against gay students does not
occur, the Task Force said that this
does not take into account the fact that
gay students constitute "an invisible
minority."
"We are not advocating gay students
to relinquish their anonymity, but we
do feel that gay students ought not to
be burdened by a fear of discrimina
tion by their university should their
sexual orientation become known to
university officials, whether such
knowledge is freely and voluntarily or
inadvertently and unvoluntarily di
vulged," the letter stated.
The Task Force said it feels that the
policy would be beneficial to the uni
versity community "because it would
make clear the equal status of gay and
non-gay members of that community
