# Politicos bargain in 'moral market'

In Nixon Agonistes, conservative
turned-cynic Gary Wills describes
Richard Nixon's conception of Ameri
can society as the view of the "last
liberal" in American politics. 1 le bases
this on Nixon's passion for competi
tion — in business, in ideas and,
perhaps most importantly, in morality.
Society as a collection of forces in
combat is the classic liberal model, ac
cording to Wills, and Nixon's inclu
sion of every facet of life in this strug
gle is the essence of liberalism.
Whether Nixon qualifies as a classi
cal liberal for this reason or not, clearly
there is a "moral market" in American
politics. Both liberals and conserva

tives — in the postwar sence —
are engaged in creating, testing, and
marketing positions on issues which
will makea strong showing among the
electorate.
Almost invariably, these positions
involve the use of the state's coercive
power to please whatever god is
thought to require appeasement. The
only question is: Which god?
The god of down-home conserva
tives — the kind who bombard the
mails daily with appeals for contribu
tions to "Americans for Putting God
Hack in Our Schools" — see govern
ment as the great provider of religious
training not provided at home.
State enforcement
More important, their god requires
the state to enforce his command
ments in every bedroom, at every party
where the "devil weed" is being con
sumed and in every part of the world
where the heathen hordes of godless
Communism may be lurking.
And remember, like Satan in the de
sert, subversion and revolution always
come disguised.
But when challenged to move a
rampantly racist society toward some
guarantee against assaults on the civil
rights of minorities, the conservatives'
god is immobile. The state is no longer
the executor of divine commands but
the passive observer of the status quo.
"You can't legislate morality," they
say. pointing out that pointv-headed
sociologists in Washington are flailing
at windmills when they expect people
to change their attitudes because of
statutes.
A more realistic goal, it seems to
them, is a legal end to oral copulation.
California bill
The debate over Willie Brown's
1975 bill decriminalizing private sex
ual acts between consenting adults in
California illustrates the conservative
position. Many of the same state legis
lators who opposed the banning of
"redlining" in bank loans because the
state has no business interfering for
social purposes in the normal prac
tices of financial institutions decried
the so-called "homosexual bill" be
cause society was abandoning what
one senator said were "the Christian
principles on which our Constitution
is based."
The liberal god is no less selective,
however. With his roots in postwar so
cial theory and the Depression-vintage
Social Gospel, his command is that the
state be a coercive moral force putting
its thumb on a scale long tilted by a
capitalist economy in favor of WASPs
from established lineages.
Fortius reason, liberals propose that
government take "affirmative action"
not to protect the rights of minorities
but to promote their upward mobility
in society. Believers in the ability of
small groups of men to create a new

society in which their moralistic goals
will be attained see no limit to the
police power except their own concep
tion of the public welfare.
So-called "private acts," however,
are not the concern of the liberal god.
Regardless of the disgust with which a
community may view a sexual act, for
example, the state must remain silent.
Personal opposition
Jimmy Carter's position on abortion,
which conveys "personal opposition"
without a call for governmental inter
vention, is a classic example of the dis
criminating taste of the liberal god.
The same candidate who has endorsed
affirmative action — though not
quotas, as though there were a
philosophical distinction — because
of the right of the state to promote its
moral goals, cannot support the end of
a practice which some of its other op
ponents claim is tantamount to mur
der.
Because these two views are the only
ones receiving wide attention, voters
have been asked not whether the
police powers should be used to pro
mote a particular moral ideal, but

which ideal they favor. The contest be
tween the two is being held in the
arena of public policy, with little atten
tion being given to whether this is the
proper arena.
Clearly, the course of action which
will best protect the moral values of
both groups, while limiting the often
counter-productive coercive power of
the state, is the end to governmental
actions other than those protecting the
citizenry from injury.
While protecting the civil rights of
all persons, this would make consis
tent the basically insightful conserva
tive slogan that "you can't legislate
morality."
The moral market should move to
the plane of voluntary persuasion, as
sociation and interaction. In this
sphere, the moral contestants will be
free to promote their views, but with
out the police power either enforcing
or thwarting their aims.
