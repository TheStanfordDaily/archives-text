# One room schools survive

### 
Lincoln, Neb. fAP) â€” In the
days of teacher unions, media
centers and early childhood de
velopment specialists, the one
room school survives here in a
way that teaches teachers as well
as students.
The 21 kids in grades one
through eight at the "Rocky
Road Ranch" school don't gaze
out the window at Nebraska
farmfields if they daydream. The
school is on the Union College
campus, and outside are stu
dents rushing to class and the
sounds of nearby traffic.
The Seventh-day Adventist
college opened the one-room
school on its campus to meet its
own special needs and the needs
of Nebraska.
"Our schools are small be
cause of finances," Charles Fel

ton, Union education depart
ment chairman, said in explain
ing the program. "We simply
weren't training teachers for this
situation.
The college found, too, that
one-room teachers had to deal
with more than slim finances.
Times have changed since only a
slate and reader were needed to
entertain the student who had
trudged miles to school.
"Now with the competition of
television, a teacher has to prac
tically do a headstand to get the
attention of kids," said Vir
ginia Simmons of the college's
education department.
"One of the first things we did
was teach the education majors
to be scavengers," she said.
"We begged from the lumber
yard, shopped at the Salvation

Army and made things ourselves
for the school. The average per
pupil expenditure in our system
after books and necessities is
about $2 per student per
month."
