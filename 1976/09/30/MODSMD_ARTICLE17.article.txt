Dave "Big Daddy" McCul
lum, head chef at the faculty
club here, writes this column
for-the Daily every week.
"Look what Big Daddy's got
cooking" has become some
what of an institution here.
Big Daddy tries to come up
with good menus which stu
dents will enjoy, and yet
which are inexpensive.
The idea for the column
began some years ago, when
Big Daddy was working as a
cook at Ohio State. "There
seemed to be a need for some
kind of thing of this type," he
said. The column ran in the
Ohio State Daily Lantern for
some eight years. All told, Big
Daddy has worked in various
schools and universities for
nearly 40 years.
"The idea is that so many
people can cook, but 1 help
them to find cheaper meals —
show them how to save,"
he said. Big Daddy has even
compiled a cook book, and
plans to release it in January.
