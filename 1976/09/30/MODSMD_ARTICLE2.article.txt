# Campus parking overhauled
## 
### Daniel Pyne 
In an attempt to encourage carpools
and simply "get some vehicles off
campus," the university this year has
reorganized its parking system.
Parking areas have been individu
ally reclassified according to the con
venience of their location, reported
Marvin Herrington. director of police
services.
Parking spaces in the most "desir
able" areas have been labeled "A" and
are available only to faculty and staff
members for $f>o a year.
"B" lots, in less desirable locations,
are available to off-campus students
for $30 a year, and to faculty and staff
for $40 annually.
Not for residents
Lots designated "C" are free and
may be used by off-campus students,
faculty, staff and anyone with any reg
ular Stanford affiliation, but not by
students living on-campus, explained
Polices Services clerk Crystal
Wullschleger.

Parking permits can be obtained at
the Stanford police station.
"One of the things we're trying to
keep down is resident students' use of
cars, because it's a lot of traffic we
don't need," Herrington said.
All the parking restrictions are in
effect 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wullschleger
said that the university is primarily
concerned with that nine-hour period
because that is when campus traffic is
heaviest.
Resident students will be required to
get a $15 parking permit assigned to
them according to their campus hous
ing.
More pay lots
The university has also established
three additional pay areas,
Wullschleger said. The areas adjacent
to Tresidder on Serra St. across from
Sequoia Hall, and along Memorial
Way behind Mem Aud — both for
merly "G" parking areas — will be
closed off by white gates. Parking will
cost 50 cents.

Visitor parking areas remain basi
cally unchanged.
Wullschleger warned that the uni
versity police will be cracking down
on parking violations this year because
there was a lot of misuse last year. No
"stickered" cars will be able to park in
visitors' time zones.
Construction has caused the loss of
some parking areas, but master plan
ner Oscar Nelson said sufficient park
ing space is still available.
Parking displaced at the Terman
construction site can be handled by
parking lot 13 near the Roble Tennis
Courts, Nelson said, noting that the lot
is usually only half-full.
Parking displaced by construction
around Main Library can be accom
modated by parking in lot H. near En
cina Gym and bookstore parking has
been moved to the parking area behind
the front Row houses.
"Numerically," Nelson said, "it
works out fine, even though it proba
bly won't be quite as convenient."

merly "G" parking areas — will be
closed off by white gates. Parking will
cost 50 cents.

Visitor parking areas remain basi
cally unchanged.
Wullschleger warned that the uni
versity police will be cracking down
on parking violations this year because
there was a lot of misuse last year. No
"stickered" cars will be able to park in
visitors' time zones.
Construction has caused the loss of
some parking areas, but master plan
ner Oscar Nelson said sufficient park
ing space is still available.
Parking displaced at the Terman
construction site can be handled by
parking lot 13 near the Roble Tennis
Courts, Nelson said, noting that the lot
is usually only half-full.
Parking displaced by construction
around Main Library can be accom
modated by parking in lot H. near En
cina Gym and bookstore parking has
been moved to the parking area behind
the front Row houses.
"Numerically," Nelson said, "it
works out fine, even though it proba
bly won't be quite as convenient."
In an attempt to encourage carpools
and simply "get some vehicles off
campus," the university this year has
reorganized its parking system.
Parking areas have been individu
ally reclassified according to the con
venience of their location, reported
Marvin Herrington. director of police
services.
Parking spaces in the most "desir
able" areas have been labeled "A" and
are available only to faculty and staff
members for $f>o a year.
"B" lots, in less desirable locations,
are available to off-campus students
for $30 a year, and to faculty and staff
for $40 annually.
Not for residents
Lots designated "C" are free and
may be used by off-campus students,
faculty, staff and anyone with any reg
ular Stanford affiliation, but not by
students living on-campus, explained
Polices Services clerk Crystal
Wullschleger.

Parking permits can be obtained at
the Stanford police station.
"One of the things we're trying to
keep down is resident students' use of
cars, because it's a lot of traffic we
don't need," Herrington said.
All the parking restrictions are in
effect 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wullschleger
said that the university is primarily
concerned with that nine-hour period
because that is when campus traffic is
heaviest.
Resident students will be required to
get a $15 parking permit assigned to
them according to their campus hous
ing.
More pay lots
The university has also established
three additional pay areas,
Wullschleger said. The areas adjacent
to Tresidder on Serra St. across from
Sequoia Hall, and along Memorial
Way behind Mem Aud — both for
merly "G" parking areas — will be
closed off by white gates. Parking will
cost 50 cents.

Visitor parking areas remain basi
cally unchanged.
