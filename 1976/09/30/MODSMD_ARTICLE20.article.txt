# FCC rejects 'media monopoly' claim by Justice Department in Fresno case
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Fed
eral Communications Commis
sion (FCC) said yesterday it has
rejected a Justice Department
petition that it deny renewal ap
plications of McClatchey News
papers for its stations WMJ —
AM—FM—TV in Fresno.
The action does not dispose of
the case; other issues involved in
the renewal application remain
pending.
The Justice Department con
tended that McClatchey posse
ses an undue concentration ot
control of local news and mass
advertising in the Fresno met
ropolitan area that is inconsis

tent with antitrust principles
and constitutes a monopoly. It
said renewal of the state licenses
would amount to substantial les
sening of competition.
The FCC held that the depart
ment had failed to make a show
ing of economic monopolization
that might warrant action under
the Sherman Antitrust Act. It re
jected the argument that renewal
could not be reconciled with the
goals of the Communications
Act.
The department failed to show
that McClatchey engaged in an
ticompetitive conduct or that its
holdings in Fresno will tend to
diminish competition in that
market, the FCC ruled.
It said the Fresno area, with a
population of 413,053, has three
commercial television stations
including KMJ, 10 standard
broadcast stations and six FM
facilities.
While some radio facilities are
commonly owned, the FCC said,
there still are two independent
television outlets and 12 inde
pendent radio voices, in addi
tion to the McClatchey holdings.
The commission said the Jus
tice Department traces
McClatchey's dominance to its

ownership of the Fresno Bee, the
only daily newspaper with sig
nificant circulation in the
county, and ownership of the
market's leading television sta
tion and two strong radio sta
tions.
The FCC said divestiture of
daily newspaper-broadcast
combinations is required only in
communities where the combi
nations are egregious — if the
only daily newspaper and only

commercial television station
serving a community are com
monly owned. It said that is not
the case in Fresno.
The commission said the re
cord oi continued media entry
into the Fresno market and the
absence of any evidence that
Fresno advertisers pay an artifi
cially established price for local
advertising, both operate against
any inference of monopoly
power by McClatchey.
