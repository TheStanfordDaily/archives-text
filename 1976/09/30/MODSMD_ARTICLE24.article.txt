# College campuses lose activists, gain hacks
## 
### 
From the College Press Service
"1 don't think it's dignified to
give the tinger to the vice presi
dent of the United States," snap
ped Nelson Rockefeller after he
flipped the bird to 25 student
hecklers in Binghamton, N.Y.,
recently. "1 just responded in
kind. It's the American way."
While this incident could
have triggered a barb-filled
series of encounters between
students and candidates in past
elections, this year it looks as if
there won't be any fights for
Rocky, Grits-and-Fritz or
Jerry'n'Bob-students just don't
care.
Campus activism hasn't
exactly flourished in *1976. Most
of the politicking is left to stu
dent hacks, the future ward
leaders and state senators, who
are laying roots for their own
careers. The camaraderie and
idealism of 1968 and 1972 is
gone; there's not the unity that
brought 40,()()() youths together
to work for Ceorge McCovern in
the "72 New York primary.
Jimmy Carter enlisted just 400

students for the same effort this
year.
The few youths that are in
volved in the national election
this year keep lonely hours at
student union campaign booths,
occasionally hawking a bumper
sticker or bending some patient
passerby's ear.
Low turnout
According to pollster I'eter
Hart, it's an election year that
will find less than half the coun
try's registered voters traipsing
to the polls, with an even lower
percentage pegged for those
under 30.
"Students are campaigning
for pragmatic reasons,"
explained Doug Miller, a senior
at the University of Chicago.
"They realize it's the only presi
dential election in their four col
lege years, and they want to get
the experience. On the whole,
the University of Chicago is
apolitical. Anyone who gets in
volved in extra-curricular ac
tivities is in the minority here,"
he continued.

Despite the gloomy prospects
of makng inroads on the student
vote, both Carter and Ford youth
directors are at least making an
effort to woo the reluctant voters.
Carter vs. Apathy
"Across the board, people are
for Carter—our enemy is apathy,
not Gerald Ford," asserted Janet
Oliver of the Carter national
headquarters in Atlanta. "Young
people want integrity and lead
ership, and they haven't seen it
in their lifetime. They don't re
member FDR and JFK."
Oliver, who is directing a
campus voter registration blitz
and canvassing operation, says
she feels that young people are
fed up with politics and will be
hard to reach, despite the fact
that "Carter has had a terrific re
sponse at colleges and
everywhere else."
Carolyn Booth, national youth
director for the Ford campaign,
is more encouraged about get
ting the student vote to the polls.
"There is tremendous support
for Ford in the southern schools,
and Wake Forest, Baylor and
Notre Dame are particularly
strong," she said. "The Republi
can college student who is regis

tered is more likely to vote than
other students."
No open support
But if there's support for either
Ford or Carter at the college
campuses, it's certainly not out
in the open. When students do
speak about the election, it's
more likely to be a diatribe
slashed with cynicism rather
than admiration.
The Michigan Daily
editorialized that Ford kicking
off his campaign at a col
lege campus (University of
Michigan at Ann Arbor) "is
something akin to Hitler making
the first donation to the United
Jewish Appeal." The editorial
marked Ford as "an enemy of
education" because of his anti
education record in Congress,
and urged students to de
monstrate at the president's arri
val.
At the University of Texa.-. at
Austin, a school that Booth
counted among those active for
Ford, one student countered that
the campus was politically dor
mant: "There's voter registration
going on all right, but the race
isn't too hot. There's little activ

ity for Carter less for Ford.
People just don't care anymore."
Political addicts
"There's some political organi
zation. but it's not like four years
ago," remarked a graduate stu
dent at the University of Mary
land. reiterating a common
theme on campuses today.
"Some are participating on a
local level, the hard-core politi
cal addicts, but 1 haven't seen
much movement around this
place."
Even the workhorse Young
Americans for Freedom (YAK)
is bypassing the presidential
election this year. Disheartened
that Ronald Reagan was nosed
out in Kansas City. YAK mem
bers are concentrating on key
congressional races, where con
servative candidates are facing
stiff opposition.
What does it all add up to? A
handful of hecklers, a score of
placards and an occasional
cherry bomb scare. And al
though some students turn out
for campaign appearances, tin;
most prevailing attitude towards
the election is pretty well sum
med up bv a University of Ok
lahoma student who said,
"Yeah, I saw Carter. He says
what everyone wants to hear —
just like any politician would."
