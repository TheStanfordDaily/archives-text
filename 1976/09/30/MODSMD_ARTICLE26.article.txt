# 'Fanfare' on way out
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
The "Fanfare" is on its way
out.
In accordance with last year's
decision to replace the controv
ersial "Indian" mascot, the
familiar and stirring music is in
the process of being replaced.
Arthur Barnes, band director,
is currently working on a new
piece of music as a replacement.
The band tried an earl ier effort of
Barnes' at the I'enn State game,
but it proved "a little bit too sub
tle for most of the crowd." ac
cording to Kent Blumberg, band

manager.
Blumberg stated that Barnes'
latest attempt would be "some
thing not quite as sound musi
cally, but emotionally sound."
Despite the fanfare's associa
tion with the ill-fated "Indian"
mascot, its use at the San Jose
State game elicited no negative
response, other than a caller who
declared that the band should be
"shot" for spelling out "REDS"
during their halftime salute to
the late Chairman MaoTse-tung.
Retention of thi? traditional
"Indian" motif of the Dollies'
uniforms has caused problems.
Dollie Carrie Teagle said they
"weren't able to find anything
better." She said fellow students
were questioned about the un
iform but they could not make
any better suggestions. Teagle
added, the uniforms "look good
on the field."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said he does not antici
pate that the fanfare or the Dol
lies' uniforms will become a
major issue.
"I am not aware of any official
concern over the matter," he
said. "The band is ultimately re
sponsible to the student body."
Lyons added he thinks thai no
real problem exists and said,
"them is no chance that the 'In
dian' symbol will comeback."
