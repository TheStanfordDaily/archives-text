# The 						Big Bus' is a big bust
## 
### 
Disaster movies on their own
generated so much laughter (un
intentional, of course) that it was
only a matter oi time before
someone decided to cash in on
all this hilarity and produce a
disaster movie with intentional
humor, It was called The Big
/Jus and it turned out to be a big
bust.
It has all the ingredients for a
iunny disaster movie —
saboteurs, love affairs among the
crew, personal upheaval
among the passengers — every
thing all the other disaster
movies had. Somewhere along
the line, The Big Bus broke
down, because Airport 1975 was
funnier by far. And that was
supposed to be a drama. At least,
I think it was. When the plane
was about to collide with a small
plane and Norman Fell says,"I
was in Salt Lake City once. It was
closed," I began to wonder.
Anyway, The Big Bus has re
turned to the iJay Area, co-billed
with Won Ton Ton, The I)og
Who Saved Hollywood. Its
basic failure is that it tries hard to
satirize disaster films, which are
basically corned it: movies to
begin with.
