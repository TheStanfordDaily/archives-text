# 'Singin' in the Rain'
## 
### 
S infill' hi The Ha in, for those
of you who have been marooned
in Siberia for the past 25
five years, stars dene Kelly in top
form, a very young Debbie
Reynolds and a hilarious
Donald O'Connor. It takes place
in the most turbulent of times in
Hollywood, that roller-coaster
period when sound rapidly re
placed silence and careers wen;
created and destroyed with
startling rapidity.
Although it's a cliche, they
don't make movies like this
anymore. It's as far from
Chinatown and laws as Buenos
Aires is from the North Pole.
When was the last time you saw

a movie with a Prince Charming,
a (]\nderella.and an evil witch
modernized, of course.
Kelly plays matinee idol Don
Lock wood; O'Connor his
sidekick Cosmo; Reynolds his
protege Katliy Seidell. The lyrics
and choreography are stunning
and practically immortal, mak
ing the film synonymous with
the great Metro-Coldwvn-Mayer
musicals whose time has come
and gone but are still remem
bered fondly.
(Singin' in (lie Hum is playing
at the Menlo Theater in Menlo
Park and at Kr.esge Auditorium
Saturday night.)
