# 'Silent Movie'
## 
### 
For a movie consisting al
most totally of old vaudeville
gags exhumed, Silent Movie is a
hilariously original film from
Hollywood ("The Film Capital
of Greater Los Angeles"),
whose inhabitants are not famed
for their extraordinary original
ity.
Mel Brooks, who has given us
Blazing Saddles and Voung
Frankenstein, gathered to
gether his friends, his wife and
our favorite superstars to con
struct a string of gags effusive
enough to crack Mt. Rushmore.

It's a definite advantage that the
film is silent (save one word),
because it means that half the
lines aren't lost under the laugh
ter.
It even resembles real life in
some respects. Mel Funn
(Brooks), a washed-up director
who lost his touch in booze, of
fers to save an ailing studio and
its boss (Sid Caesar) about to be
conglomerated into a corporate
octopus appropriately named
Engulf and Devour (no relation
intended to Gulf and Western,
which owns Paramount, which

did not distribute Silent Movie).
He gathers together at great
slapstick expense five superstars
who jump at the chance to be in
his movie. As in Blazing Sad
dles, the film is within the film,
and is a vital part of the plot.
As for the superstars, Burt
Reynolds, Liza Minelli, Paul
Newman, Marcel Marceau.
James Caan and Anne Bancroft
(Mrs. Brooks) —watching them
make fun of their popular images
is part of the hilarity. For in
stance — normally athletic

James Caan is pathetically un
coordinated;Burt Reynolds can't
pass a mirror without telling
himself how beautiful he is; Paul
Newman leads Funn and his
cohorts (Dom DeLuise and Marty
Feldman) on a merry wheelchair
chase (filmed at the University of
California at Irvine); and Anne
Bancroft parodies her image as a
glamorous star.
Brooks' next target? Rumor
has it that it's Alfred Hitchcock
movies.
(Silent Movie is at the Fine
Arts Theatre in Palo Alto).
