Britain asks for loan to save pound

with a second mortgage, the British government
announced yesterday it would seek $3.9 billion in
credits from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
to halt the collapse of the pound sterling.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey an
nounced the move and said the nation's living
standard would slump and unemployment would
soar if the credit was not made available.

pound up by nearly three cents to close at $ 1.6650.
The once-mighty currency, worth $2.40 only 18
months ago, closed at a record low of $1.6360 on
Tuesday after falling 4'/;> cents.
Britain already has borrowed nearly $2 billion
from the IMF since last December. The country
suffers 13.8 percent annual inflation, record high
unemployment ut r .2 per cent, an industrial pro
ductivity level among the lowest in the West, firmly
fixed wage demands and a serious international
I Hide imbalance.
Syrians intensify drive on guerrillas
Hhamdoun, Lebanon — A fierce Syrian tank and
artillery assault yesterday forced Palestinian guer
rillas tostart withdrawing from mountain positions
above Beirut.
The retreat followed appeals from Palestinian
leader Yasir Arafat to Arab kings and presidents to
intervene immediately "to stop the slaughter of my
people."
In Cairo, the Egyptian government called for a

limited Arab summit within 48 hours to deal with
the situation in Lebanon. Mentioned as particip
ants were new Lebanese President Elias Sarkis,
Arafat, and the heads of state of Syria, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and Egypt.
Kissinger still seeking peace
Washington — With British help, Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger is maintaining the momen
tum of his breakthrough toward peace in Rhodesia
despite bitter black-white attacks on certain settle
ment terms.
The secretary, ever since returning from his
12-day political safari through Africa, has been
demanding lightning action by all parties to get
Rhodesian blacks and whites around a conference
table.
His aim: to have a caretaker government, with a
majority of blacks in it, chosen by the end of
November and certainly no later than Christmas.
Quarrels and arguments have burst loose bet
ween Rhodesian Prime Minister lan Smith's men
and the presidents of the five black states surround
ing Rhodesia over differing interpretations of the
contents of the Kissinger package.
For the white Rhodesians' in Kissinger's view,
there is no option but to yield power to the blacks
under the best possible terms and with good grace
because the whites are beleaguered and friendless.
Smith says black rule can be implemented only
in two years. The American-British plan foresees
that to be a deadline for Rhodesian independence
under a black-dominated government.
Smith has spoken of a two-tier caretaker system
of government to lead Rhodesia through the transi
tion to statehood.

said San Francisco Giants Manager Bill Rigney.
"It's the perfect way to close out a season that has
not been all that perfect."

Britain asks for loan to save pound
London — Like a man trying to cover his debts
with a second mortgage, the British government
announced yesterday it would seek $3.9 billion in
credits from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
to halt the collapse of the pound sterling.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey an
nounced the move and said the nation's living

pound up by nearly three cents to close at $ 1.6650.
The once-mighty currency, worth $2.40 only 18
months ago, closed at a record low of $1.6360 on
Tuesday after falling 4'/;> cents.

unemployment ut r .2 per cent, an industrial pro
ductivity level among the lowest in the West, firmly
fixed wage demands and a serious international
I Hide imbalance.

artillery assault yesterday forced Palestinian guer
rillas tostart withdrawing from mountain positions
above Beirut.

Kissinger still seeking peace
Washington — With British help, Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger is maintaining the momen
tum of his breakthrough toward peace in Rhodesia
despite bitter black-white attacks on certain settle
ment terms.
The secretary, ever since returning from his
12-day political safari through Africa, has been
demanding lightning action by all parties to get
Rhodesian blacks and whites around a conference
table.
His aim: to have a caretaker government, with a
majority of blacks in it, chosen by the end of
November and certainly no later than Christmas.
Quarrels and arguments have burst loose bet
ween Rhodesian Prime Minister lan Smith's men
and the presidents of the five black states surround
ing Rhodesia over differing interpretations of the
contents of the Kissinger package.
For the white Rhodesians' in Kissinger's view,
there is no option but to yield power to the blacks
under the best possible terms and with good grace
because the whites are beleaguered and friendless.
Smith says black rule can be implemented only
in two years. The American-British plan foresees
that to be a deadline for Rhodesian independence
under a black-dominated government.
Smith has spoken of a two-tier caretaker system
of government to lead Rhodesia through the transi
tion to statehood.
