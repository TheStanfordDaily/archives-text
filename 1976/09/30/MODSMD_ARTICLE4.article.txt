# Trouble for Stanford in Berlin?
## 
### Elizabeth Pollock 
Everyone wants to keep Stanford-in-
Berlin, yet the hard facts of financing
and student participation will force
the Overseas Studies Office to recruit
students this quarter for next year's
program.
Marking its third year of operation
this January, Stanford-in-Berlin, under
new director Assoc. History Prof. Paul
Robinson, was lauded by last year's
participants. Yet enrollment was
lower last year due to insufficient pub
licity and uncertainties about the
program's future.
"My experience of living in Berlin
was an extraordinary experience of
expanding my horizons enormously,"
said Robinson, a specialist in 19th and
20th century intellectual history.
Robinson teaches a course about Ber
lin and is Stanford's representative in
that city.
"The primary attraction is some
thing indefinite, the certain feeling
about the place. I love the city," Robin
son said.
Maintenance of the current cur

riculum variety depends on two fac
tors: money and student interest.
According to Mark Mancall, director
of Overseas Studies, the situation is
not "bleak." but rather, a "question."
"Germany is much more expensive
than any other place on the Continent.
We cannot maintain both Berlin and
Vienna without outside help." said
Mancall.
Other considerations cited were the
exchange rate of the dollar and the
need for sources of support outside the
university.
Program excellent
Berlin has "no programmatic prob
lems at all," said Don Price, assoc. di
rector of Overseas Studies.
In fact, Mancall said. "It's a damn
good place for people who want to
learn German quickly and well."
"This arrangement (with students
living with Germans in rooms
throughout the city) was vastly
superior to the Beutelsbach arrange
ment in terms of the language." Robin
son said.
Mancall added that Berlin has the

advantage that a person can "learn
German in an environment where
people generally speak High German."

Both Robinson and Mancall said
they thought that Berlin has had an
image problem.
"The first negative thought they
(students) have is that it's small and
enclosed," Robinson said. "But, the
place is enormous. I went to the beach.
Berlin has a forest in the middle of it."
"It's not this terrible gray prison on
the other side of the Iron Curtain,"
Mancall said.
"It has a political ambiance to it.
Politics is in the air. 1 like that about
it," said Robinson.
"Openness . . . extraordinary trans
portation system. . . wonderful theatre
. . . great places to eat and drink . . .
and the absolutely superb opera which
is incredibly cheap" are just some of
the ways Robinson enlarged his de
scription of the Divided City.
He plans to teach part of the Berlin
campus' opera class. Students there
receive a 50 per cent rebate from Stan
ford on all German cultural event tic
kets purchased.
Over the wall
Robinson also anticipates "taking
people over" to East Berlin. He wants
students to have contact with people
in the East and would want to "de
traumatize the passage (from West to
East)."
"I don't feel ill at ease when I'm
there (in East Berlin)," he said.
Overseas Studies requires that all
participants complete a minimum of
two quarters of German language be
fore going overseas, but the crucial fac
tor in deciding who goes is "making
sure that enough of the right students
go," Mancall said.
The city of Berlin also wants Stan
ford to stay in Berlin.
They are "desperately trying to
maintain a life in the city," said Price.
Presently, two universities attract
about 60,000 students to study in West
Berlin. Stanford was the first Ameri
can university to help establish one of
them, the Free University of Berlin.
Stanford's Berlin program is housed
in a villa designed by Hermann
Muthesius and was completely reno
vated at city expense.

program.
Marking its third year of operation
this January, Stanford-in-Berlin, under
new director Assoc. History Prof. Paul
Robinson, was lauded by last year's
participants. Yet enrollment was
lower last year due to insufficient pub
licity and uncertainties about the
program's future.
"My experience of living in Berlin
was an extraordinary experience of
expanding my horizons enormously,"
said Robinson, a specialist in 19th and
20th century intellectual history.
Robinson teaches a course about Ber
lin and is Stanford's representative in
that city.
"The primary attraction is some
thing indefinite, the certain feeling
about the place. I love the city," Robin
son said.
Maintenance of the current cur

riculum variety depends on two fac
tors: money and student interest.
According to Mark Mancall, director
of Overseas Studies, the situation is
not "bleak." but rather, a "question."
"Germany is much more expensive
than any other place on the Continent.
We cannot maintain both Berlin and
Vienna without outside help." said
Mancall.
Other considerations cited were the
exchange rate of the dollar and the
need for sources of support outside the
university.
Program excellent
Berlin has "no programmatic prob
lems at all," said Don Price, assoc. di
rector of Overseas Studies.
In fact, Mancall said. "It's a damn
good place for people who want to
learn German quickly and well."
"This arrangement (with students
living with Germans in rooms
throughout the city) was vastly
superior to the Beutelsbach arrange
ment in terms of the language." Robin
son said.
Mancall added that Berlin has the

advantage that a person can "learn
German in an environment where
people generally speak High German."

Both Robinson and Mancall said
they thought that Berlin has had an
image problem.
"The first negative thought they
(students) have is that it's small and
enclosed," Robinson said. "But, the
place is enormous. I went to the beach.
Berlin has a forest in the middle of it."
"It's not this terrible gray prison on
the other side of the Iron Curtain,"
Mancall said.
"It has a political ambiance to it.
Politics is in the air. 1 like that about
it," said Robinson.
"Openness . . . extraordinary trans
portation system. . . wonderful theatre
. . . great places to eat and drink . . .
and the absolutely superb opera which
is incredibly cheap" are just some of
the ways Robinson enlarged his de
scription of the Divided City.
He plans to teach part of the Berlin
campus' opera class. Students there
receive a 50 per cent rebate from Stan
ford on all German cultural event tic
kets purchased.
Over the wall
Robinson also anticipates "taking
people over" to East Berlin. He wants
students to have contact with people
in the East and would want to "de
traumatize the passage (from West to
East)."
"I don't feel ill at ease when I'm
there (in East Berlin)," he said.
Overseas Studies requires that all
participants complete a minimum of
two quarters of German language be
fore going overseas, but the crucial fac
tor in deciding who goes is "making
sure that enough of the right students
go," Mancall said.
The city of Berlin also wants Stan
ford to stay in Berlin.
They are "desperately trying to
maintain a life in the city," said Price.
Presently, two universities attract
about 60,000 students to study in West
Berlin. Stanford was the first Ameri
can university to help establish one of
them, the Free University of Berlin.
Stanford's Berlin program is housed
in a villa designed by Hermann
Muthesius and was completely reno
vated at city expense.
Everyone wants to keep Stanford-in-
Berlin, yet the hard facts of financing
and student participation will force
the Overseas Studies Office to recruit
students this quarter for next year's
program.
