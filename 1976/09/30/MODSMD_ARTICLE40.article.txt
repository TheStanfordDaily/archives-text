Union negotiations continue
University and United Stanford Employees
bargaining teams met yesterday afternoon to
continue negotiations for a new contract.
However, both teams agreed to speak to the
public only through a joint statement. The text of
that joint statement is as follows:
"In a bargaining session Wednesday after
noon, union and university (bargaining) teams
surveyed the outstanding issues and agreed to
meet intensively in an effort to resolve the major
issues remaining.
"Bargaining sessions have been scheduled for
Thursday and Friday, Sept. 30 and Oct. 1. In
order that the bargaining representatives of both
sides will be able to devote their undivided at
tention to these and subsequent sessions, public
comment will be made only through joint state
ments until further notice."
SJC appointees
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Jonathan Casper
has been reappointed as faculty co-chairman of
theStanford Judicial Council (SJC) by university
president Richard Lyman.
Reappointed were Education Prof. Alfredo
Castaneda and Electrical Engineering Prof.
James Gibbons. Newly appointed to the council
was Law School Prof. J. Myron Jacobstein.
All were appointed for a one-year term.
Correction
A typographical error in yesterday's USE
strike vote story caused the meaning of a parag
raph to be changed. The paragraph should have
read:
(United Stanford Employees) USE President
Roger Hardy said he could interpret the vote as
meaning that union members "were eager not to
go out, were scared or poor" or "maybe the un
ion's demands were not high enough."
