Enticing students with descriptions
of their various staff needs, the rep
resentatives from major campus publi
cations addressed about 60 persons at
a Publications Board 1976 recruitment
meeting yesterday at Cubberley Au
ditorium.
Anxious to attract new staffers, the
representatives also showed samples
of their work, with the exception of
Winiis. an Asian-American newsletter
in its incipient stage of publication.
Jell Stoler, chairman of the ASSIJ
Publications Board said the turnout
was "good," adding that "many
people who have already picked a pub
lication to work on probably did not
attend."
Bill Sing, Winds representative, said
he hoped that the fledgling newsletter
will "express the needs and desires of
the Asian-American body of students
on campus."-
Tentative projects include an explo
ration of slum conditions in San Fran
cisco's Chinatown, he said.
