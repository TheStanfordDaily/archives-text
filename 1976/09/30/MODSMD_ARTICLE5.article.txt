# Bomb squad talks continue
## 
### Mike Jennings Stephen Crolius 
University officials denied yester
day that bomb squad and search team
negotiations between the Stanford
Police Officers Association (SPOA)
and the university have broken down.
SPOA President Herman Williams
charged Saturday that the university
presented an unacceptable "first and
last proposal" for the transfer of bomb
squad and search team duties from the
Stanford Fire Department to the Stan
ford University Department of Public
Safety (SUDPS).
The Stanford Fire Department will
merge with the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment tomorrow.
Employe Relations Manager Robert
Parker said today that "Williams' letter
(to Vice President for Business and Fi
nance Robert Augsburger) requesting
grievance and arbitration proceedings
was premature because we haven't yet
exhausted all bargaining pos
sibilities."
Excellent relations
Parker explained that he "has not
heard across the table" that the SPOA
is no longer willing to negotiate and
that until he does he "can only charac
terize relations between the university
and the SPOA as excellent."
When asked to explain the proce
dure for SPOA grievances, Parker reit
erated Jiis assertion that such proce
dure "will not be necessary," and that
"there are no irreconcilable differ
ences between the SPOA and the uni
versity."
Parker said that "the main issue in
volves the increased hazards of bomb
squad and search duties for the Com
munity Service Officers (CSOs)."
whose duties are almost exclusively
non-hazardous, such as securing uni
versity buildings at night. They do not
perform the normal police functions of
the Deputized Police Officers (DPOs),
he said.
SUDPS Chief Marvin Herri ngton

justified the clause of the university
proposal which include CSOs in bomb
search teams, saying that "the CSOs
would not be involved in dismantling
bombs.
"The CSOs are really in a better posi
tion than anyone to conduct searches
because they know the buildings bet
ter than anyone else," he said, adding
that, "it would be impossible to pull all
the deputized officers off their other
duties to conduct a bomb search."
No volunteers
Williams also said that although he
"volunteered the services of 90 per
cent of the bargaining members for the
Bomb Squad and Search Teams," Her
rington did not want volunteers.
1 le said that according to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, bomb squad
training he has received, search and
defusing duty should be strictly volun
tary.
Herrington, however, said, "I can't
depend on whoever may or may not
want to go on the searches."
He made a distinction, though, bet
ween searchers and defusers, saying
that "CSOs would only be involved in
searches."
"It is certain that those selected (for
bomb dismantling) would be volun
teers," he said. "I would approve those
actually selected and they would be
given special training."
Herrington said that he "does not
agree" with Williams' charge that "the
university cares more for a building
blown up than it does for a SPOA bar
gaining unit member being blown up,
killed or disabled."
"If we didn't care about the people
involved, we wouldn't conduct the
searches at all. The CSOs are the ones
who have to walk around the build
ings," Herrington said.
He added that "95 per cent of all
bomb threats are hoaxes."

perform the normal police functions of
the Deputized Police Officers (DPOs),
he said.
SUDPS Chief Marvin Herri ngton

justified the clause of the university
proposal which include CSOs in bomb
search teams, saying that "the CSOs
would not be involved in dismantling
bombs.
"The CSOs are really in a better posi
tion than anyone to conduct searches
because they know the buildings bet
ter than anyone else," he said, adding
that, "it would be impossible to pull all
the deputized officers off their other
duties to conduct a bomb search."
No volunteers
Williams also said that although he
"volunteered the services of 90 per
cent of the bargaining members for the
Bomb Squad and Search Teams," Her
rington did not want volunteers.
1 le said that according to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, bomb squad
training he has received, search and
defusing duty should be strictly volun
tary.
Herrington, however, said, "I can't
depend on whoever may or may not
want to go on the searches."
He made a distinction, though, bet
ween searchers and defusers, saying
that "CSOs would only be involved in
searches."
"It is certain that those selected (for
bomb dismantling) would be volun
teers," he said. "I would approve those
actually selected and they would be
given special training."
Herrington said that he "does not
agree" with Williams' charge that "the
university cares more for a building
blown up than it does for a SPOA bar
gaining unit member being blown up,
killed or disabled."
"If we didn't care about the people
involved, we wouldn't conduct the
searches at all. The CSOs are the ones
who have to walk around the build
ings," Herrington said.
He added that "95 per cent of all
bomb threats are hoaxes."
University officials denied yester
day that bomb squad and search team
negotiations between the Stanford
Police Officers Association (SPOA)
and the university have broken down.
SPOA President Herman Williams
charged Saturday that the university
presented an unacceptable "first and
last proposal" for the transfer of bomb
squad and search team duties from the
Stanford Fire Department to the Stan
ford University Department of Public
Safety (SUDPS).
The Stanford Fire Department will
merge with the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment tomorrow.
Employe Relations Manager Robert
Parker said today that "Williams' letter
(to Vice President for Business and Fi
nance Robert Augsburger) requesting
grievance and arbitration proceedings
was premature because we haven't yet
exhausted all bargaining pos
sibilities."
Excellent relations
Parker explained that he "has not
heard across the table" that the SPOA
is no longer willing to negotiate and
that until he does he "can only charac
terize relations between the university
and the SPOA as excellent."
When asked to explain the proce
dure for SPOA grievances, Parker reit
erated Jiis assertion that such proce
dure "will not be necessary," and that
"there are no irreconcilable differ
ences between the SPOA and the uni
versity."
Parker said that "the main issue in
volves the increased hazards of bomb
squad and search duties for the Com
munity Service Officers (CSOs)."
whose duties are almost exclusively
non-hazardous, such as securing uni
versity buildings at night. They do not
perform the normal police functions of
the Deputized Police Officers (DPOs),
he said.
