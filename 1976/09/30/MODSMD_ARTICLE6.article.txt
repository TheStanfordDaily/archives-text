law students were returning, one
Proposition 14 staffer- registered 37
persons. Workers resumed registration
on Sept. 23, and signed up 1065 new
voters on Monday alone.
Miller said the registration drive had
the added benefit of publicizing the
"Yes on 14" campaign. In addition to
publicity, the campaign receives funds
from the Democratic Party in exchange
for voter registration, since most of the
people registering are Democrats.
Even before these registration
drives, a high number of Stanford stu
dents had registered to vote. Despite
the fact that the June primary was dur

in the June primary or have not been
registered in the current voter drives
are registered at their parents' addresses.
Of the 100 students polled by the
Daily, 54 of the 96 registered voters
were registered in their home districts.

"How could you not be registered?"
said freshman Neal Amsden, after he
ran the gauntlet of three groups who
were registering voters during class
registration.
The League of Women Voters main
tained its traditional post at Maples
Pavilion and registered between 200
and 300 new voters, according to

to register." Millar said.

groups were out registering voters as

they campaigned for votes. Workers
