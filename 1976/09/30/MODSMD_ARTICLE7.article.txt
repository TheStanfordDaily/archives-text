# Protest stirs action
## Park entrance fee may go 
### Emily Sachar 
The Palo Alto City Council will consider a proposal
to repeal the controversial $1 entrance fee to Palo Alto's
Foothill Park Monday evening.
The fee, which goes into a general city fund, would
have been used to pay for about 75 percent of the park's
operations and maintenance, according to a city offi
cial.
Approved unanimously this June and put into effect
Sept. 1. the fee has been criticized by Palo Alto citizens,
according to Charlie Walker, assistant city manager.
"We have had more negative response on this issue
than is usual, with around three letters coming in each
week," Walker said.
Three votes needed
' "Hence, two members of the Council are proposing
to drop it. With only three more votes needed, 1
wouldn't he surprised if the Council decided to remove
it,"he said.
Councilman Kirke Comstock requested the proposal
be placed on the Council agenda several weeks ago,
and has since been working to have the fee removed.
If Comstock is successful in his efforts to rescind the
fee, other methods will be necessary to keep the park
running at its current level, according to Larry White,
director of the Park Nature and Science Dept.
"The philosophy behind the fee was to have those
people using the park pay for its use. The park costs
$130,000 to run annually and to some people this (fee)
was a less painful way than a city-wide tax increase (to
pay for maintenance)." Walker said
"I wovdd try to keep maintenance and staff. But we

would certainly have to lower our expenditures,"
Walker said.
The City eliminated 30 park positions in June in an
effort to avoid charging an entrance fee.
In addition, the Council levied a 13 cent tax increase
and increased fees for the junior museum, golf course
and animal service.
More capital improvement
Meanwhile, more capital improvement projects may
get underway should the City receive money from the
Federal Public Works Employment Act of 1976.
About B0 planned projects were reduced to 20 sev
eral weeks ago so that the City could finance the $7.5
million settlement of the Arastra Ltd. foothills lawsuit.
Federal funds could be used on such projects as the
Eleanor Pardee Park expansion, Fabian Way storm
drain improvement. Veterans Building repair, Greer
Park improvement, golf course improvement and con
struction of a new golf course clubhouse.
After approval, the project construction must begin
within 90 days and must be completed within a two
year period.
The Act, a federal effort to reduce unemployment,
authorizes $2 billion be spent by Sept. 30, 1977, for
grants providing 100 per cent government funding.
The park is presently open only to Palo Alto resi
dents or city employes and their guests, who must carry
identification proving that they are residents of Palo
Alto.
The park is located about four miles south of the
university on Page Mill Road. It is an undeveloped area
with hiking trails and a lake for use by patrons.

The fee, which goes into a general city fund, would
have been used to pay for about 75 percent of the park's
operations and maintenance, according to a city offi
cial.
Approved unanimously this June and put into effect
Sept. 1. the fee has been criticized by Palo Alto citizens,
according to Charlie Walker, assistant city manager.
"We have had more negative response on this issue
than is usual, with around three letters coming in each
week," Walker said.
Three votes needed
' "Hence, two members of the Council are proposing
to drop it. With only three more votes needed, 1
wouldn't he surprised if the Council decided to remove
it,"he said.
Councilman Kirke Comstock requested the proposal
be placed on the Council agenda several weeks ago,
and has since been working to have the fee removed.
If Comstock is successful in his efforts to rescind the
fee, other methods will be necessary to keep the park
running at its current level, according to Larry White,
director of the Park Nature and Science Dept.
"The philosophy behind the fee was to have those
people using the park pay for its use. The park costs
$130,000 to run annually and to some people this (fee)
was a less painful way than a city-wide tax increase (to
pay for maintenance)." Walker said
"I wovdd try to keep maintenance and staff. But we

would certainly have to lower our expenditures,"
Walker said.
The City eliminated 30 park positions in June in an
effort to avoid charging an entrance fee.
In addition, the Council levied a 13 cent tax increase
and increased fees for the junior museum, golf course
and animal service.
More capital improvement
Meanwhile, more capital improvement projects may
get underway should the City receive money from the
Federal Public Works Employment Act of 1976.
About B0 planned projects were reduced to 20 sev
eral weeks ago so that the City could finance the $7.5
million settlement of the Arastra Ltd. foothills lawsuit.
Federal funds could be used on such projects as the
Eleanor Pardee Park expansion, Fabian Way storm
drain improvement. Veterans Building repair, Greer
Park improvement, golf course improvement and con
struction of a new golf course clubhouse.
After approval, the project construction must begin
within 90 days and must be completed within a two
year period.
The Act, a federal effort to reduce unemployment,
authorizes $2 billion be spent by Sept. 30, 1977, for
grants providing 100 per cent government funding.
The park is presently open only to Palo Alto resi
dents or city employes and their guests, who must carry
identification proving that they are residents of Palo
Alto.
The park is located about four miles south of the
university on Page Mill Road. It is an undeveloped area
with hiking trails and a lake for use by patrons.
The Palo Alto City Council will consider a proposal
to repeal the controversial $1 entrance fee to Palo Alto's
Foothill Park Monday evening.
The fee, which goes into a general city fund, would
have been used to pay for about 75 percent of the park's
operations and maintenance, according to a city offi
cial.
