## Opinions Forced feminism creates injustice 
### 
Ann Sherman

In the September 1975 issue of
Clamour magazine, Ms. Lynn (using
the dictionary definition of the word
feminism as "the belief that men and
women are mentally and socially
(M)ual, and that women should be
given every social freedom, advantage
and opportunity enjoyed by men")
suggests that justice requires us to ac
cept this set of beliefs. But does justice
require that we accept feminism? I
shall argue that it does not. and that
women often reject the word feminist
precisely because they feel that equal
ity is a requirement of justice only in a
specific sense.
Let us begin by taking the case of Ms.
Sugarsweet (no relation to Sugar Bear).
Now Ms. Sugarsweet has just been of
ferred the position as the first gar
bageperson in VVastecity, Illinois. Does
justice require that she accept the be
lief in job equality here? Would it be
unjust for Ms.' Sugarsweet lo believe
that men and women were not equally
qualified for the garbageperson job
(i.e., that there might be some relevant
differences)?
Even if there were "empirical" find
ings that there were no relevant differ
ences, would it be unjust for Ms.
Sugarsweet to continue to reject the
belief in equality? Irrational or to her
disadvantage, peril -os. but not unjust.
Opportunity to choose
Justice does not require the belief in
any ideology, feminism or otherwise.

Rather, it requires the chance to choose
between ideologies.
Women can fight injustice and re
quire justice in the sense that they have
not been given the opportunity to
choose between feminism and other
alternatives, but not in the sense that
justice requires the belief in feminism.
Would it be just to force Ms.
Sugarsweet to accept the belief in
equality here? Such an outcome is a
possible consequence of the view that
justice requires a certain belief. Equal
ity of opportunity for choice between
feminism and other alternatives is a
requirement of justice. Theacceptance
of feminism is not.
Forced ideals
In the past, women often did not
have the social chance to choose be
tween being a housewife and taking a
garbageperson job. In the present soci
ety. if they do have the social chance,
they are often ill-equipped to make
that choice. To be forced to accept
"malechauvinist" ideals is indeed un
just. However, to be forced to accept
feminist ideals would also be unjust.
In both cases the injustice lies in the
fact that one has not been given the
opportunity to really choose.
Justice will be served only when we
all have the opportunity to make real
choices about our way of life.

In the September 1975 issue of
Clamour magazine, Ms. Lynn (using
the dictionary definition of the word
feminism as "the belief that men and
women are mentally and socially
(M)ual, and that women should be
given every social freedom, advantage
and opportunity enjoyed by men")
suggests that justice requires us to ac
cept this set of beliefs. But does justice
require that we accept feminism? I
shall argue that it does not. and that
women often reject the word feminist
precisely because they feel that equal
ity is a requirement of justice only in a
specific sense.
Let us begin by taking the case of Ms.
Sugarsweet (no relation to Sugar Bear).
Now Ms. Sugarsweet has just been of
ferred the position as the first gar
bageperson in VVastecity, Illinois. Does
justice require that she accept the be
lief in job equality here? Would it be
unjust for Ms.' Sugarsweet lo believe
that men and women were not equally
qualified for the garbageperson job
(i.e., that there might be some relevant
differences)?
Even if there were "empirical" find
ings that there were no relevant differ
ences, would it be unjust for Ms.
Sugarsweet to continue to reject the
belief in equality? Irrational or to her
disadvantage, peril -os. but not unjust.
Opportunity to choose
Justice does not require the belief in
any ideology, feminism or otherwise.

Rather, it requires the chance to choose
between ideologies.
Women can fight injustice and re
quire justice in the sense that they have
not been given the opportunity to
choose between feminism and other
alternatives, but not in the sense that
justice requires the belief in feminism.
Would it be just to force Ms.
Sugarsweet to accept the belief in
equality here? Such an outcome is a
possible consequence of the view that
justice requires a certain belief. Equal
ity of opportunity for choice between
feminism and other alternatives is a
requirement of justice. Theacceptance
of feminism is not.
Forced ideals
In the past, women often did not
have the social chance to choose be
tween being a housewife and taking a
garbageperson job. In the present soci
ety. if they do have the social chance,
they are often ill-equipped to make
that choice. To be forced to accept
"malechauvinist" ideals is indeed un
just. However, to be forced to accept
feminist ideals would also be unjust.
In both cases the injustice lies in the
fact that one has not been given the
opportunity to really choose.
Justice will be served only when we
all have the opportunity to make real
choices about our way of life.
