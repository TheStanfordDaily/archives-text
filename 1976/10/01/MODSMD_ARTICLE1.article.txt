# Lyman blasts med school bill
## 
### Bill Sing 
President Richard Lyman de
nounced proposed legislation that
could require American medical
schools to admit American citizens en
rolled in foreign medical schools as
"an intrusion into college admissions
procedures in an unprecedented man
ner."
Speaking yesterday before the
Academic Senate, Lyman said that
such legislation would force Stanford
and other universities "to discriminate
in favor of a group whose common
characteristics are that they have failed
to get admitted to a medical school in
this country and have managed to find
the financial resources to go to some
other country to study medicine.
"To me, that does not add up to a
compelling case for federal interven
tion of any kind," continued Lyman,
"let alone the extraordinary and
dangerous departure from academic
freedom that is being suggested."
The proposed legislation, which al
ready has the approval of the House,
states that the Secretary of HEW may
equitably apportion positions among
the country's medical schools for stu
dents who are in foreign medical
schools and have:
"(i) successfully completed at least
two years in such school of medicine,
and
"(ii) successfully completed part I of
the National Board of Medical
Examiners' examination (or any suc
cessor to such examination)."
Exceptions
The proposal states that exceptions
to this requirement would be granted if:
"(i) the individual does not meet, as
determined by guidelines established
by the Secretary by regulation, the en
trance requirements of the school
(other than requirements related to
academic qualifications or to place of
residence), or
"(ii) enrollment of such individual
will, as determined by the Secretary
after consultation with theappropriate
accreditation body result in the
school's not meeting the accreditation

standard of such body."
Lyman commented that this pro
posal was formulated in a "cloak and
dagger fashion," and any justification
of it would not stand up.
"To undertake such a radical step
absolutely without consultation with
the higher educational community is
flagrantly irresponsible," continued
Lyman.
"The issue is not whether the num
bers involved will turn out to be large
or small. The issue is one of principle:
a university medical school's right to
establish its own admissions process,
and to treat all applicants evenhan
dedly."
No veto
Lyman indicated that he did not
know whether such legislation, if pas
sed, would affect policies on admis
sions and financial aids of ethnic
minority students to medical and other
professional schools.
Lyman did say that if the proposal
were to get by Congress, "the President
probably would not veto it.
"Faculties across the country need
to become aware of the gradual en
croachment, item by item, of their gov
ernment into matters traditionally and
for good reason thought to be the facul
ty's domain," Lyman concluded.
Increased information
In other Academic Senate affairs,
new Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Herant Katchadourian said bis-prim
ary task will be "to make under
graduate education everybody's busi
ness" through an increased flow of in
formation among academic depart
ments and students.
"I see the Office of Undergraduate
Studies as a hatchery," said Katch
adourian. "Through our office various
programs can reach maturity and then
move on into prospective schools."
Such was the case with the Human
Biology department, said Katchadou
rian.
