# Incumbents outspent challenges 15-1

### 
Sacramento (AP) — Legislative
incumbents outspent their
primary election challengers by
about 15-1, tlie state Fair Politi
cal Practices Commission
(FPPC) said yesterday.
"It may not come as a surprise
to anyone that incumbents easily
eclipse nonincumbents in their
ability to raise campaign con
tributions," said commission

chairman Daniel Lowenstein.
"But these figures may even
startle veteran political obser
vers."
He said the spending gap
raises "serious questions about
the competitiveness of Califor
nia legislative races."
Nonincumbents, he added,
"face an almost impossible task
in attempting to match the cam
paign resources of incumbents."

The FFPC said it checked all
campaign reports filed by legis
lative candidates since January
1975 when Prop. 9, the 1974
political reform act, took effect.
Unsurprisingly, it found that
most campaign funds came from
special interests — business,
labor, and public employe and
professional groups — and that
most of that money went to in
cumbents.
Of the $11 million contributed
to legislative or ballot proposi
tion campaigns during the prim
ary, $B million came from spe
cial interests, Lowenstein sairl.
"1 am not saying that 1 think
the whole government is cor
rupt," he added, "or that a legis
lator votes for an interest group
just because he gets a contribu
tion from them.
"But what we are seeing here
is how special interests get their
foot in the door."

The FPPC study also found
that:
—During the primary cam
paign, the 65 incumbent assemb
lymen outspent their challen
gers 13-1, while the 14 incum
bent senators outspent their
challengers 17-1.
—The 216 legislative candi
dates who won primary races
had a combined total of $2.1
million in contributions left over
after the June 8 election. More
than 92 percent of it — $1.9 mill
ion — was given to incumbents.
—The median expenditure for
the 316 Assembly primary can
didates was $6,574, but the
spending median for Assembly
incumbents was $25,574. All 65
incumbents won their races.
—The same averages in Senate
races were $13,510 overall and
$36,329 for incumbents. None of
the 14 Senate incumbents was
defeated, either.
