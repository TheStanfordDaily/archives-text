# Commit murder for money? Psychologist sees lethal trend
## 
### 
ChicagoiAP)—"What is the
least amount of money you
would take to push a button to
kill a person inside a black box
— no one would ever know what
you did."
A psychologist put that ques
tion to 200 persons around An
drews Air Force Base near
Washington, D.C., in 1975and to
an additional 452 persons inter
viewed this year in St. Mary's
County, Md.
Their answers, said Paul
Cameron, point to a disregard for
the value of human life in
American society.
The people interviewed were
divided into two groups. Those
who acknowledged having de
liberately killed someone —
usually in military service — or
having tried to do so were in one
group. Those who had never kil
led or tried to were in the second
group.

Forty-five per cent of those
who had killed before said they
would murder for money, Came
ron said. The average price for
them was $50,000. he said.
"Lethality feeds upon itself."
said Cameron, who teaches now
at the Graduate School of
Psychology at Fuller Theologi
cal Seminary in Pasadena. He
formerly taught in Maryland and
did the studies at that time.
Cameron reported on his work
recently at the annual meeting of
the National Federation of
Catholic Physicians' Guild in
Oak Hrook, 111. He elaborated in a
telephone interview.
Cameron said an estimated 20
million persons in the United
States have "participated in kil
ling humans in various con
texts."
"Their attitudes toward life
cannot help but influence our
society in a deathward direc
tion," he said."Part of the lethal
trend toward death is the grow

ing power of the military mind
in our society."
Returning military personnel
do not, as Americans tend to
think, just come home and "eat
apples, bake pies, have chil
dren." Cameron said. They re
turn with a different, more lethal
view toward life, he said, and
this is passed on to their chil
dren.
The experience of killing not
only affects the willingness to
kill again but also attitudes to
ward the value of human life, he
said. The surveys indicated that
those who had killed or tried to
kill were only about half as in
clined as nonkillers to continue
life support measures for gravely
ill persons, especially the aged,
he said.
"Those who have killed
human beings are very different
from nonkillers in their attitudes
toward both murder and
euthanasia mercy killing," said
Cameron.

group. Those who had never kil
led or tried to were in the second
group.

Forty-five per cent of those
who had killed before said they
would murder for money, Came
ron said. The average price for
them was $50,000. he said.
"Lethality feeds upon itself."
said Cameron, who teaches now
at the Graduate School of
Psychology at Fuller Theologi
cal Seminary in Pasadena. He
formerly taught in Maryland and
did the studies at that time.
Cameron reported on his work
recently at the annual meeting of
the National Federation of
Catholic Physicians' Guild in
Oak Hrook, 111. He elaborated in a
telephone interview.
Cameron said an estimated 20
million persons in the United
States have "participated in kil
ling humans in various con
texts."
"Their attitudes toward life
cannot help but influence our
society in a deathward direc
tion," he said."Part of the lethal
trend toward death is the grow

ing power of the military mind
in our society."
Returning military personnel
do not, as Americans tend to
think, just come home and "eat
apples, bake pies, have chil
dren." Cameron said. They re
turn with a different, more lethal
view toward life, he said, and
this is passed on to their chil
dren.
The experience of killing not
only affects the willingness to
kill again but also attitudes to
ward the value of human life, he
said. The surveys indicated that
those who had killed or tried to
kill were only about half as in
clined as nonkillers to continue
life support measures for gravely
ill persons, especially the aged,
he said.
"Those who have killed
human beings are very different
from nonkillers in their attitudes
toward both murder and
euthanasia mercy killing," said
Cameron.
ChicagoiAP)—"What is the
least amount of money you
would take to push a button to
kill a person inside a black box
— no one would ever know what
you did."
A psychologist put that ques
tion to 200 persons around An
drews Air Force Base near
Washington, D.C., in 1975and to
an additional 452 persons inter
viewed this year in St. Mary's
County, Md.
Their answers, said Paul
Cameron, point to a disregard for
the value of human life in
American society.
The people interviewed were
divided into two groups. Those
who acknowledged having de
liberately killed someone —
usually in military service — or
having tried to do so were in one
group. Those who had never kil
led or tried to were in the second
group.
