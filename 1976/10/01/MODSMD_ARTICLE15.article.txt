# Candidates offered job-hunting aid
## After November, one will be unemployed' 
### 
Washington (AP) â€”An organi
zation that helps find jobs for
executives over age 40 has in
vited President Ford and Jimmy
Carter to join, figuring one of
them will he unemployed after
Nov. 2.
"Our only requirements are
that the applicant be 40 or more
year of age and that he or she
have worked in a professional or
executive capacity," said the let
ter to the two candidates. "You
appear eminently qualified."
The group, called Forty Plus of
Washington said its members
fall into two categories, those
who are out of work and those
"who are presently employed
but anticipate a job change and
realize that a group effort is bet
ter than an individual effort."
The letter was hand-carried to
Ford's downtown campaign
headquarters and mailed to Car

ter's organization in Atlanta.
Wayne Lewis, vice chairman
of the organization's counseling
committee, said Thursday that
Forty Plus doesn't usually solicit
members.
"1 guess everything boils
down to publicity." he said. "We
want exposure, we want
employers as well as the un
employed professional to hear of
us and to learn about Forty
Plus."
Enclosed with the letters was a
dues schedule: an initiation fee
of $60 and $12 a month for a
member who can work one day a
week in the group's office or $45
for the one who has a job and
can't.
At this stage, Ford has a job
that pays him $200,000 a year.
Carter reported income of
$136,138.92 for 1975. To belong
to Forty Plus, a member must
have had a job paving at least
$15,000 anually.
"As a presidential candidate
you have expressed your con
cern with unemployment, your
concern with the need to reduce
the federal government's role
and your desire to put people to
work," the letters said.
"Your party's platform speaks
out on the critical need to reduce
unemployment in the nation.
You can help highlight the ef
forts of some of the over 150,000

people across the country, the
unemployed professional men
and women over 40 years of
age."
Lewis said "we feel it would
be a tremendous coup for eitiier or
both the President or (Jov. Carter
to become a member of Forty
Plus, considering the high
number of unemployed profes
sionals and exeutives, many of
them Republicans and Democ
rats probably sitting on the fence

wondering which way to vote.
"If Mr. Ford were to join and
get publicity that he is support
ing the movement, 1 think he
could pick up quite a bit of votes.
The same is true of Mr. Carter as
well." Lewis said.
The White House was check
ing to see whether the letter had
been received and had no im
mediate response. The Carter
camp probably hadn't received
the letter by Thursday.
