Tokyo (AP) —Chinese Premier
Hua Kuo-feng "must attempt to
be all things to all people" to
maintain political stability, in
the view of a U.S. China
speicalist just returned from a
visit with Hua. He says the sta
bility may not last.
William Whitson accom
panied former U.S. Defense Sec
retary James Schlesinger on a
23-day visit to China, and the
two Americans spent three
hours with Hua and other
Chinese leaders in Peking Tues
day.
The premier, at least nomi
nally China's tup official, is
bringing together radical and
moderate leaders, but he lacks
the binding "charisma" of
Communist party Chairman Mao
Tse-tung, who died Sept. 9,
Whitson said in an interview.
He called Hua, who became
premier in a surprise turn of
events after Chou En-lai died last
January, a "necessary manifesta
tion for unity" that may last only
several months, a year at most.
Telling strain
"The strain within the Peking
leadership will begin to tell after
the winter and may peak in late
summer," and the state of the
Chinese economy may be a deci
sive factor, said Whitson, for
merly with the Rand Corp.
"think tank" and now chief of
the foreign affairs and national
defense division of the Congres
sional Research Service in
Washington.
He said long-time foreign re
sidents in Peking told him they
expect "great disorder under
heaven," as the Chinese say, but

that the present Chinese politi
cal system would survive.
In the wide-ranging discus
sion with Schlesinger, Hua
spoke with the apparent backing
of other Chinese leaders present,
Whitson said, but the premier
would occasionally look to
Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan
hua for guidance.
Chiao after Mao?
Chiao, generally regarded as a
moderate and often mentioned
as a possible successor to Mao as

party chairman and national
leader, "clearly gave his support
to Hua's remarks," Whitson said.
"Hua gives the sense of being a
very cultured Chinese gentle
man. He takes cues from all
sides, and therefore he's an actor
— like all Chinese," Whitson
said.
"At the moment, he must at
tempt to be all things to all men
— by simply echoing Mao's
perspectives and thoughts," he
said.
Puffy cheeks
"He's not effeminate, but he is
effete, not rough and ready, not
given to farmyard epithets,"
Whitson said of the 57-year-old
premier.
Whitson suggested that Mao's
passing and the subsequent
mourning period have been a
major reason for the appearance
of relative political calm in Pek
ing.
"Hua obviously suffers by
comparison with Mao," he said.
"Mao was an intellect. I think,
however, that Hua is a personal
ity and a figure both sides need
now."
