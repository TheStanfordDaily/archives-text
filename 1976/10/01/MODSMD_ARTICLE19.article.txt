## Other contenders hit by graduation Poloists eye NCAA crown

"We'll be back," said water polo coach
Art Lambert after his Stanford team was de
feated by UCLA and finished fourth in the
NCAA water polo championships at Long
Beach last year.
Well, the Cards are back and better than
ever according to the third year coach.
Stanford did lose four-year varsity letter
man J. P. Roberts, but Lambert has already
replaced the loss.
"Anytime that you lose a player the
caliber of Roberts, it does hurt," said Lam
bert. "But we have replaced him and the
transition has been smooth."
Graduation losses
Graduation depleted the three teams that
finished ahead of the Cards in the NCAA.
California, UCLA and UC-Irvine lost their
big guns.
But the Golden Bears suffered the most
critical setback, losing John Svenson and
Paul Bogan, two All-American seniors who
wore members of the national water polo
team last year.
If this alone isn't enough to make Stan
ford's opponents think twice about chang

ing to another league, the Cards have yet
another thing for coaches to worry about.
Stanford's squad is a vastly more experi
enced one than that of last year.
'We are more together than a year ago,"
said Lambert. "We know each other a lot
more and have a good idea of each guy's
capability."
Moscow trip
The former Olympic water polo coach
attributed the Cards' progress to the team
visit to Moscow this summer. Although the
living conditions were nothing to write
home about, during the 10 day stay the
Cards did become a tighter unit.
With the prospect of winning. a national
championship, what Lambert termed at that
time as a "slightly over-confident" Cardinal
team returned to the states to host a team
which took a 9-8 decision a year ago and
stopped the Cards short of the NCAA finals.
As expected by both coaches, the
Stanford-Irvine contest was more of an of
fensive than defensive display and in the
end the Anteaters continued their domi
nance with an 8-7 win.

The Cards didn't win their first game
until last Saturday when they travelled to
UC-Santa Barbara. Stanford won by three
goals but not before Santa Barbara managed
to score seven goals before the final buzzer.
Last year, the Cards had no problem with
the USCB contingent. However a new rule
change has affected college water polo. The
new rule states that after a team has commit
ted 10 team fouls the opposing team shoots
a penalty shot.
"The new rule brings poorer teams up to
the level of a good team," said Lambert.
"They have a better chance of winning this
year than a year ago."
Lambert explained that UCSB may be a
factor in the NCAA race.
"That win down at Santa Barbaracould
prove to be important at the end of the sea
son as UCSB is a greatly improved team and
is further aided through the new rule," he
said.
"But rule or no rule, we know what we
have to do." The Card water polo team in
deed plans a return trip to the NCAA
championships.

The Cards didn't win their first game
until last Saturday when they travelled to
UC-Santa Barbara. Stanford won by three
goals but not before Santa Barbara managed
to score seven goals before the final buzzer.
Last year, the Cards had no problem with
the USCB contingent. However a new rule
change has affected college water polo. The
new rule states that after a team has commit
ted 10 team fouls the opposing team shoots
a penalty shot.
"The new rule brings poorer teams up to
the level of a good team," said Lambert.
"They have a better chance of winning this
year than a year ago."
Lambert explained that UCSB may be a
factor in the NCAA race.
"That win down at Santa Barbaracould
prove to be important at the end of the sea
son as UCSB is a greatly improved team and
is further aided through the new rule," he
said.
"But rule or no rule, we know what we
have to do." The Card water polo team in
deed plans a return trip to the NCAA
championships.

"We'll be back," said water polo coach
Art Lambert after his Stanford team was de
feated by UCLA and finished fourth in the
NCAA water polo championships at Long
Beach last year.
Well, the Cards are back and better than
ever according to the third year coach.
Stanford did lose four-year varsity letter
man J. P. Roberts, but Lambert has already
replaced the loss.
"Anytime that you lose a player the
caliber of Roberts, it does hurt," said Lam
bert. "But we have replaced him and the
transition has been smooth."
Graduation losses
Graduation depleted the three teams that
finished ahead of the Cards in the NCAA.
California, UCLA and UC-Irvine lost their
big guns.
But the Golden Bears suffered the most
critical setback, losing John Svenson and
Paul Bogan, two All-American seniors who
wore members of the national water polo
team last year.
If this alone isn't enough to make Stan
ford's opponents think twice about chang

ing to another league, the Cards have yet
another thing for coaches to worry about.
Stanford's squad is a vastly more experi
enced one than that of last year.
'We are more together than a year ago,"
said Lambert. "We know each other a lot
more and have a good idea of each guy's
capability."
Moscow trip
The former Olympic water polo coach
attributed the Cards' progress to the team
visit to Moscow this summer. Although the
living conditions were nothing to write
home about, during the 10 day stay the
Cards did become a tighter unit.
With the prospect of winning. a national
championship, what Lambert termed at that
time as a "slightly over-confident" Cardinal
team returned to the states to host a team
which took a 9-8 decision a year ago and
stopped the Cards short of the NCAA finals.
As expected by both coaches, the
Stanford-Irvine contest was more of an of
fensive than defensive display and in the
end the Anteaters continued their domi
nance with an 8-7 win.
