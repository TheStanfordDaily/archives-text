# Grade deflate
## Is it getting harder to get high grades? 
### Ann Amioka 
A smaller percentage of "A"s was given last year
than the year before, according to figures released by
the Registrar's Office this week, but the controversial
reinstatement of the"D" has made little change in most
professors' grading procedures.
Chemistry Prof. Harry Mosher said the reinstatement
of the "D" "didn't make much difference as far as we
(chemistry professors) were concerned." He said his
standards for "A"s, "B"s and "C"s remained un
changed.
Last year, for the first time since 1969, the "D" was
used as the lowest passing grade. The Faculty Senate
brought back the "D" last fall in an attempt to curb
grade inflation and give respectability to the "C".
However, less than one percent of all grades given
last year were "D"s.
For Geology Prof. Robert Compton, having the "D"
again had no effect on his grading standards, although
it "may have made it a little easier to have some 'C's
than formerly."
The proportion of "C"s given last year increased
slightly from the year before, rising from 6.4 per cent to
6.8 per cent in the School of Humanities and Sciences,
from 5 per cent to 6.6 per cent in the School of Earth
Sciences and from 4.7 per cent to 5.9 per cent in the
School of Engineering.
"A"s declined
Counter balancing the rise in "C"s last year, the
proportion of "A"s declined.
In the School of Humanities and Sciences, which has
the largest undergraduate enrollment, 35.3 percent of
approximately 74,000 grades given last year
"A"s, compared to 37.3 per cent "A"s the year before
and 41.3 per cent given in 1973-74.
In the School of Earth Sciences, 30.1 per cent of the
2,700 grades given last year were "A"s, while 40.5 per

cent of the 2,250 grades given in 1974-75 were "A"s.
The School of Engineering showed a smaller decline,
with 34.5 per cent "A"s given last year out of 19,500
grades, compared with 38 per cent the year before.
"D"s affect
Bringing back the "D" seems to have affected some
professors' grading slightly, while leaving others un
touched.
"Mvgraderswere very relieved to get the 'D' back,"
said Assoc. History Prof. Frederick Bowser. Under the
old system, when the "C" was the lowest passing
grade, he noted, the standard for that grade sank con
siderably.
Now that graders have the option of giving "D"s, the
'"C takes on more respectability," said Bowser, and the
'"B's and 'A's have higher price tags."
Unchanged standards
For other professors, standards have not changed.
The one difference under the revised grading system,
said Mosher, was that some of his chemistry students
who would have received "no credit" before received
"D"s instead â€” and there were very few of those in his
classes.
He noted that he offered students a choice between a
"D" or a "no credit" and that students opted for either
choice. The "D" as it now stands, he said, is "very
imprecise."
Noting that his grading standards have been "much
more severe than the university's, generally," Political
Science Prof. Robert Horn said his grading has not
become stricter as a result of the concern about grade
inflation.
"I'm known as a hard grader," he said. "I've always
done it that way."
From Horn's point of view, the "average quality of
the student body has gone up" and he is giving fewer
poor grades than he did 15 years ago.
