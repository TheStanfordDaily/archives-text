# Stanford favored by 15
## Army to put on air show 
### David Georgette 
An aerial display similar to
last week's shoot-out between
San Jose State and Stanford can
be expected tomorrow at 10:30
a.m. PDT when the Cardinals
travel to Army's Michie Stadium
to take on a young and inexperi
enced Cadet squad with only 16
returning lettermen.
Army's junior signal-caller,
Leamon Hall (6-foot-5, 215),
leads the nation in total offense
(271.7 yards per game) having
completed an average of 21 pas
ses per outing.
Stanford's Guy Benjamin,
slated to start despite being
slowed in practice this week by
injuries sustained in the San Jose
State game, tops the Pacific-8 in
passing and total offense (158
yards per game).
Benjamin, Nor-Cal Player-of
the-Week, has an average of 22
completions per game. How
ever, he is not listed in the na
tional statistics because he has
not appeared in 75 percent of his
team's games (two of three).
'Outstanding quarterback'
Card coach Jack Christiansen
called Hall an "outstanding
quarterback with a very strong
arm." Last Saturday Hall's tosses
nearly upset 14th-ranked North
Carolina before the Tar Heels
dealt the Cadets a 34-32 setback.
Army opened the year with
two victories at home. "We were
really disappointed that we lost
last week," said third-year Cadet
coach Homer Smith, a former
Stanford assistant. "We had
many opportunities to win the
game."
Hall's favorite target is the na
tion's leading receiver, sopho
more tight end Clennie Brun
didge (6-4, 220). He has caught
27 passes for 370 yards and three
touchdowns this season, which
is pretty good for a player not
even listed on the depth charts or
roster of Army's fact-filled press
guide.
According to Christiansen,
Hall likes to roll out one way and
then throw back across the field
to Brundidge on a curl pattern.
"He's looking for the tight end
60 or 70 per cent of the time,"
said Christiansen.
New defense
The Cards plan to use "a pass
defense scheme that will stop
the Cadets' passing game, espe
cially to that tight end." Hall and
Brundidge have taken Army to
the top of the country's college
passing charts.
Army's air strike capability

was discounted by Smith,
though. "Stanford can shut off
our passing game any time it
wants to," said the Army men
tor.
Smith plan to launch an "in
tegrated" offensive assault
against the Cards, which means
one of the two senior starters on
offense, running back Tony Pyne
(6-1, 197), and freshman Jon
Dwyer (5-11, 194) could run the
ball against a Stanford defense
which held San Jose State to just
148 yards rushing.
Whether Army attacks by land
or by air, sophomore middle
linebacker Cordon Ceresino will
have to be reckoned with. Cere
sino (6-2, 219) has 60 tackles this
year, which is 30 more than pre
season All-American Duncan
McColl. Ceresino earned Pac-8
Defensive Player-of-the-Week
honors for his efforts against San
Jose State.
'Super player'
"Ceresino is developing into a
super player," said Christiansen.
"We ask a great deal of him in
our defense. Even though he's
only a sophomore, he's been
doing a great job."
Defensively, the Cadets will
try to contain the Cards with a
unit that has only two seniors
(one being co-captain defensive
end Stan Ford) and a secondary
made up of freshmen and
sophomores. Smith says he "is
concerned about Stanford
checking-off" at the line of
scrimmage and calls the Stan
ford offense "professional-like."
An inexperienced Army sec
ondary could be a sitting duck
for Benjamin's passes. With
flanker Tony Hill expected back
from a two-game absence, re
ceiver Bill Kellar, Vince Mulroy
and James Lofton keyed to con
tinue last week's heroics, Ben
jamin figures to enjoy a field day.
Many observers predict an en
core of last year's re-enactment
of the 67-14 Little Big Horn
could be in the offing. Christian
sen dismissed last year's result
as "one of those things," adding
tha Army wasn't prepared for the
hot weather.
Complacency
While Smith admits defeating
Stanford will be very difficult for
his team, Christiansen does not
want complacency to take away
what seems to be a sure win.
Chris said if the Cards take
things easy and look ahead to the
conference opener against
UCLA next week, "our chances
of getting beat are pretty good.
All in all, Army is a good team.

Army is not a team to take
lightly. As coaches we're fight
ing that. We have got to play as
hard this week as we did last
week against San Jose."
Christiansen said no holds
will be barred. "We'll use every
thing we've got."
But unless something really
unexpected happens, or possi
bly if the Stanford syndrome of
losing to inferior teams strikes,
Christiansen should not have to
worry too much.
"We've got to try to continue
an even level of proficiency,"
said Christiansen. Army is a
prime prospect for keeping
jack's ship righted.
Cardinal notes: Sophomore
Jack Moller (6-4, 230) will start at
right tackle on defense . . . kellar
is third in the Pac-8 in receiving
with 12 grabs . . . Mulroy has 11
catches for sixth place . . . Stan
ford does not have a rusher in the
Pac-B's Top Ten, and as a team is
ranked seventh with 97.7 yards
overland a game.
