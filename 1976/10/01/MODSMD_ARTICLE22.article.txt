# Last day for IM sign ups

### Bill Wernecke 
Intramural sports competition
gets underway next week.
League play begins Monday in
football and two-person vol
leyball. Tennis doubles, golf,
free throws, table tennis dou
bles, and pocket billiards
matches are also on tap.
There is still time to sign up at
Encina gym if you haven't done
so â€” the deadline is 5 p.m. to
day.
Football officials,who will be
paid $2.50 per game, are needed.
Each team is required to supply
at least one. All refs must attend
one of the following cl inics. to be
held at Encina gym: today at 4
p.m., tomorrow at 10 a.m., or
Monday at 4 p.m.
There have been several im
portant rule clarifications this
year concerning player eligibil
ity. Any player using an as
sumed name or playing on two
or more teams in a single sport
will be suspended from that
sport for the quarter, as will the
offending teams.
For league contests, it will be
possible to shuffle rosters be
tween teams of a competitive
group only up to the second
league contest, at which time an
official roster must be turned in.
This is especially important for
independents.
A competitive unit may sign
up four teams (two each in A and
B leagues), to compete for points
in a single-elimination sport, but
only two teams (one of each
type), in a league sport. These
teams must be designated before
the season starts.
