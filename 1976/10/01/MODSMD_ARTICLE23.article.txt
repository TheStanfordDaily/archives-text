# Oregon belongs in Pac-8 — Read
## 
### Paul Bauman 
Eugene, Ore.—Oregon could
be the best of the Pacific-8 north
ern teams this year.
True, that's not the greatest of
distinctions—sort of like being
the smartest kid in a remedial
reading class—but it's a start.
And that's what the Ducks need
— a start. Their record since Don
Read took over as head coach
two years ago is 5-17.
Unfortunately for Oregon, its
53-0 loss to USC two weeks ago
would seem to indicate that
there's still a disparity of talent
in the Pac-8. But imply that the
Ducks don't belong in the
league, as some have lately, and
Read nearly gets irate.
'Multitude of personnel'
While admitting that the
southern schools "have a mul
titude of personnel," he insists
the Pac-8 is more balanced this
year .than it has been in the past.
Read cited Washington's wins
over UCLA and USC last year.
"It is changing," Read says.
"Not to recognize it is dumb. If
Oregon doesn't belong in the
conference, I don't know who
does.
"People are supportive in this
community. The Emeralds
(Eugene's minor league baseball
team) lead the world in atten
dance."
Read then pointed to Mac A
rthur Court, home of the Duck
basketball team.
"You can't get a ticket in that
place if you know the mayor of
Eugene," he said. "The potential
to be successful in the Pac-8 at
Oregon is here. It's up to us (the
coaches) to do it."
Hard to figure
Oregon finished 3-8 last year
and was somewhat of an enigma.
The Ducks lost three games by
three points each to good teams
(Minnesota, San Jose State and
Stanford). They also gave up 62
points against Oklahoma, 50
against UCLA and 34 against
California.
So far in 1976, Oregon has
continued a pattern of beating
the crummy teams and losing to
the good ones. The Ducks beat
Colorado State, 17-3, in their
opener, were blown out by USC
and then defeated Utah, 20-13.
Oregon's defense, tradition
ally strong, seems adequate. It's
a little on the small side, espe
cially the line, but there are sev
eral standouts — nose guard Ron
Rickert, tackle Rob Platft,
linebacker Darrell Mehl and
cornerback Reggie Grant. Read's
not too worried about the de
fense.
Scoring problems
"Offense is our problem,"
Read said. "We're not scoring
enough points. For this reason,
our recruiting emphasis has

been on offense." Read said that
last year he concentrated on re
cruiting offensive linemen. This
year he went after speedy run
ning backs.
"We're working on making
bigger gains," Read said. "We
were power-oriented last year.
Our philosophy on offense is to
be consistent — yes — but
somewhere along the way, we
expect a big play ... 10, 12, 15
yards every once in a while, not
just four or six."
Oregon seems to have every
thing it needs for a great offense.
The power back, George Ben
nett, gained 805 yards last year,
fourth best in Oregon history.
Top recruit
Thanks to Read's recruit
ing, the Ducks now have several
outside threats. Greg Gilchrist,
the starting tailback, was named
by Playboy magazine as one of
the top newcomers in the coun
try. The Pac-8 skywriters, a
group of sports writers who
toured the league this summer,
named Gilchrist the "out
standing offensive rookie."
Behind Gilchrist is Jim
Johnson, the California Division
II Player-of-the-Year last year.
In back of Johnson is Gary Nair,
an All-American last season at
Monterey Peninsula Junior Col
lege.
Oregon is set at quarterback
with Jack Henderson. The junior
from Menlo Park was second to
Joe Roth in Pac-8 passing statis
tics last year and his 13.7 com
pletions per game in 1975 make
him the national leader among
returning quarterbacks.
Big day
Henderson's biggest day last
year came against Stanford, as he
completed 25 of 42 passes for
283 yards. The Cards were
leading, 26-3, at halftime in that
game, but Oregon scored 27
points in the second half only to
lose 33-30.
Read, who has written two
books on the art of passing, said
all Henderson needs is experi
ence. "He's a neophyte in terms
of how many times he's thrown
the ball," Read said. "We expect
by mid-season he'll be better
than he is now. Right now he's
very good. He's going to be
great."
Henderson's primary target
last year was little Greg Bauer
(5-foot-9, 179). The senior re
ceiver's 52 catches were the 10th
best in the country and the third
best in the Pac-8.
The offensive line is big, ex
perienced and studly. The only
problem is a lack of depth.
Stanford will play at Oregon
Nov. 13 in what should be
another high-scoring game. The
Cards should win. but Oregon
must be taken seriously.

pletions per game in 1975 make
him the national leader among
returning quarterbacks.
Big day
Henderson's biggest day last
year came against Stanford, as he
completed 25 of 42 passes for
283 yards. The Cards were
leading, 26-3, at halftime in that
game, but Oregon scored 27
points in the second half only to
lose 33-30.
Read, who has written two
books on the art of passing, said
all Henderson needs is experi
ence. "He's a neophyte in terms
of how many times he's thrown
the ball," Read said. "We expect
by mid-season he'll be better
than he is now. Right now he's
very good. He's going to be
great."
Henderson's primary target
last year was little Greg Bauer
(5-foot-9, 179). The senior re
ceiver's 52 catches were the 10th
best in the country and the third
best in the Pac-8.
The offensive line is big, ex
perienced and studly. The only
problem is a lack of depth.
Stanford will play at Oregon
Nov. 13 in what should be
another high-scoring game. The
Cards should win. but Oregon
must be taken seriously.
Eugene, Ore.—Oregon could
be the best of the Pacific-8 north
ern teams this year.
True, that's not the greatest of
distinctions—sort of like being
the smartest kid in a remedial
reading class—but it's a start.
And that's what the Ducks need
— a start. Their record since Don
Read took over as head coach
two years ago is 5-17.
Unfortunately for Oregon, its
53-0 loss to USC two weeks ago
would seem to indicate that
there's still a disparity of talent
in the Pac-8. But imply that the
Ducks don't belong in the
league, as some have lately, and
Read nearly gets irate.
'Multitude of personnel'
While admitting that the
southern schools "have a mul
titude of personnel," he insists
the Pac-8 is more balanced this
year .than it has been in the past.
Read cited Washington's wins
over UCLA and USC last year.
"It is changing," Read says.
"Not to recognize it is dumb. If
Oregon doesn't belong in the
conference, I don't know who
does.
"People are supportive in this
community. The Emeralds
(Eugene's minor league baseball
team) lead the world in atten
dance."
Read then pointed to Mac A
rthur Court, home of the Duck
basketball team.
"You can't get a ticket in that
place if you know the mayor of
Eugene," he said. "The potential
to be successful in the Pac-8 at
Oregon is here. It's up to us (the
coaches) to do it."
Hard to figure
Oregon finished 3-8 last year
and was somewhat of an enigma.
The Ducks lost three games by
three points each to good teams
(Minnesota, San Jose State and
Stanford). They also gave up 62
points against Oklahoma, 50
against UCLA and 34 against
California.
So far in 1976, Oregon has
continued a pattern of beating
the crummy teams and losing to
the good ones. The Ducks beat
Colorado State, 17-3, in their
opener, were blown out by USC
and then defeated Utah, 20-13.
Oregon's defense, tradition
ally strong, seems adequate. It's
a little on the small side, espe
cially the line, but there are sev
eral standouts — nose guard Ron
Rickert, tackle Rob Platft,
linebacker Darrell Mehl and
cornerback Reggie Grant. Read's
not too worried about the de
fense.
Scoring problems
"Offense is our problem,"
Read said. "We're not scoring
enough points. For this reason,
our recruiting emphasis has

been on offense." Read said that
last year he concentrated on re
cruiting offensive linemen. This
year he went after speedy run
ning backs.
"We're working on making
bigger gains," Read said. "We
were power-oriented last year.
Our philosophy on offense is to
be consistent — yes — but
somewhere along the way, we
expect a big play ... 10, 12, 15
yards every once in a while, not
just four or six."
Oregon seems to have every
thing it needs for a great offense.
The power back, George Ben
nett, gained 805 yards last year,
fourth best in Oregon history.
Top recruit
Thanks to Read's recruit
ing, the Ducks now have several
outside threats. Greg Gilchrist,
the starting tailback, was named
by Playboy magazine as one of
the top newcomers in the coun
try. The Pac-8 skywriters, a
group of sports writers who
toured the league this summer,
named Gilchrist the "out
standing offensive rookie."
Behind Gilchrist is Jim
Johnson, the California Division
II Player-of-the-Year last year.
In back of Johnson is Gary Nair,
an All-American last season at
Monterey Peninsula Junior Col
lege.
Oregon is set at quarterback
with Jack Henderson. The junior
from Menlo Park was second to
Joe Roth in Pac-8 passing statis
tics last year and his 13.7 com
pletions per game in 1975 make
him the national leader among
returning quarterbacks.

year he went after speedy run
ning backs.
"We're working on making
bigger gains," Read said. "We
were power-oriented last year.
Our philosophy on offense is to
be consistent — yes — but
somewhere along the way, we
expect a big play ... 10, 12, 15
yards every once in a while, not
just four or six."
Oregon seems to have every
thing it needs for a great offense.
The power back, George Ben
nett, gained 805 yards last year,
fourth best in Oregon history.
Top recruit
Thanks to Read's recruit
ing, the Ducks now have several
outside threats. Greg Gilchrist,
the starting tailback, was named
by Playboy magazine as one of
the top newcomers in the coun
try. The Pac-8 skywriters, a
group of sports writers who
toured the league this summer,
named Gilchrist the "out
standing offensive rookie."
Behind Gilchrist is Jim
Johnson, the California Division
II Player-of-the-Year last year.
In back of Johnson is Gary Nair,
an All-American last season at
Monterey Peninsula Junior Col
lege.
Oregon is set at quarterback
with Jack Henderson. The junior
from Menlo Park was second to
Joe Roth in Pac-8 passing statis
tics last year and his 13.7 com
pletions per game in 1975 make
him the national leader among
returning quarterbacks.
Big day
Henderson's biggest day last
year came against Stanford, as he
completed 25 of 42 passes for
283 yards. The Cards were
leading, 26-3, at halftime in that
game, but Oregon scored 27
points in the second half only to
lose 33-30.
Read, who has written two
books on the art of passing, said
all Henderson needs is experi
ence. "He's a neophyte in terms
of how many times he's thrown
the ball," Read said. "We expect
by mid-season he'll be better
than he is now. Right now he's
very good. He's going to be
great."
Henderson's primary target
last year was little Greg Bauer
(5-foot-9, 179). The senior re
ceiver's 52 catches were the 10th
best in the country and the third
best in the Pac-8.
The offensive line is big, ex
perienced and studly. The only
problem is a lack of depth.
Stanford will play at Oregon
Nov. 13 in what should be
another high-scoring game. The
Cards should win. but Oregon
must be taken seriously.
Eugene, Ore.—Oregon could
be the best of the Pacific-8 north
ern teams this year.
True, that's not the greatest of
distinctions—sort of like being
the smartest kid in a remedial
reading class—but it's a start.
And that's what the Ducks need
— a start. Their record since Don
Read took over as head coach
two years ago is 5-17.
Unfortunately for Oregon, its
53-0 loss to USC two weeks ago
would seem to indicate that
there's still a disparity of talent
in the Pac-8. But imply that the
Ducks don't belong in the
league, as some have lately, and
Read nearly gets irate.
'Multitude of personnel'
While admitting that the
southern schools "have a mul
titude of personnel," he insists
the Pac-8 is more balanced this
year .than it has been in the past.
Read cited Washington's wins
over UCLA and USC last year.
"It is changing," Read says.
"Not to recognize it is dumb. If
Oregon doesn't belong in the
conference, I don't know who
does.
"People are supportive in this
community. The Emeralds
(Eugene's minor league baseball
team) lead the world in atten
dance."
Read then pointed to Mac A
rthur Court, home of the Duck
basketball team.
"You can't get a ticket in that
place if you know the mayor of
Eugene," he said. "The potential
to be successful in the Pac-8 at
Oregon is here. It's up to us (the
coaches) to do it."
Hard to figure
Oregon finished 3-8 last year
and was somewhat of an enigma.
The Ducks lost three games by
three points each to good teams
(Minnesota, San Jose State and
Stanford). They also gave up 62
points against Oklahoma, 50
against UCLA and 34 against
California.
So far in 1976, Oregon has
continued a pattern of beating
the crummy teams and losing to
the good ones. The Ducks beat
Colorado State, 17-3, in their
opener, were blown out by USC
and then defeated Utah, 20-13.
Oregon's defense, tradition
ally strong, seems adequate. It's
a little on the small side, espe
cially the line, but there are sev
eral standouts — nose guard Ron
Rickert, tackle Rob Platft,
linebacker Darrell Mehl and
cornerback Reggie Grant. Read's
not too worried about the de
fense.
Scoring problems
"Offense is our problem,"
Read said. "We're not scoring
enough points. For this reason,
our recruiting emphasis has

been on offense." Read said that
last year he concentrated on re
cruiting offensive linemen. This
year he went after speedy run
ning backs.
"We're working on making
