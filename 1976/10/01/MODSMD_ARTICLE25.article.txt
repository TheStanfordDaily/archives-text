## Former Card netters play in tourney

San Francisco —When the field assembled for the
$125,000 Fireman's Fund International Open Tennis
Championships at the Cow Palace, it could have
been billed as a Stanford tennis reunion.
But the party didn't last long. Of the seven former
Cardinals among the 54 entrants, only two survived
their first-round matches.
Chico Hagey, Rick Fisher, Jim Delaney and two
former NCAA champions, Sandy Mayer and John
Whitlinger, insured an early end to the get-together
by falling in the first round. Roscoe Tanner barely
missed joining the five when he defeated little
known Steve Docherty in a third-set tiebreaker. But
the few fans who stayed past midnight Tuesday saw
Nick Saviano score the biggest upset of his profes
sional career.
Former champ
Saviano, who turned pro last March in the middle
of his junior year, stunned Ross Case, the ninth seed
and 1974 Fireman's Fund singles champion, 4-6,6-3,
6-3. .
Saviano, with a strong serve and an improved vol
ley, seemed to wear down Case, one of the quickest
players on the tour. Afterward, the former two-time
Stanford All-American said he had no regrets about
leaving school for the pros.
"I like the tour much better," he said. "There's a
lot more pressure, and you have to discipline your
self. There's no one telling you 'This one':, a big
match.' "
'Good test'
Saviano said the pro tour is "a good test of a per
son's character. I would have liked to stay in school,
but for me it wasn't the best situation."
When asked if he thought his game had improved
since he left Stanford, Saviano said, "Definitely. You
either improve or you sink. There's nothing tougher
than qualifying."
When Saviano made the jump to the pros, he faced
the same realization as almost all other rookies. He
was no longer a star; now he was just another player.
"It's quite a blow to your ego," Saviano said. "It's
just a matter of being mentally tough and gutsing it
out week to week."
Tanner No. 12
In his fourth year out of Stanford, Tanner has es
tablished himself as the 12th-ranked player in the
world. Still, he wasn't surprised that he had so much
trouble with Docherty, who had to qualify to enter
the Fireman's Fund.
"There are so many good players," Tanner said. "I
expect every guy to be difficult. Every guy has his
own particular strength — that's why you see so
many upsets."
Tartner, seeded third in the tournament, said it
bothered him that the Bay Area crowd was clearly
rooting for Docherty, the underdog. "It would be
nice," he said, "where I played for three years, to at
least have a few people like what was going on. I got
ahead and people always pull for the underdog."
Tanner instrumental
Tanner was the guy who, along with Card tennis
coach Dick Gould, built Stanford into a national ten
nis power. The Cards became NCAA championship

contenders with Tanner, but the Tennessean turned
pro the year before they actually won the title in
1973. He still graduated on time.
"It was only after a lot of discussion with coach
Gould that I turned pro," Tanner said. "We had an
unbelievably strong team that year. My goal when I
came to Stanford was to get Stanford a national
championship. I felt for my tennis the best thing to do
was go ahead and turn pro, but I would not have done
it if I didn't think Stanford could win the national
championship without me. I thought we would win
it, and we did win it."
Tanner said Gould was a big factor in his decision
to attend Stanford.
"The guy you're going to be around most is the
coach," Tanner said. "I had to try to sit down and
decide which coach I wanted to be around most. That
guy was Gould. He's a helluva guy and a terrific
coach."
Gould was not the only reason though that Tanner
came to the Farm. "I wanted to go to one of the best
schools in the country, which Stanford is," he said.
"You kind of fall in love with the campus, and there's
every type of person there. I kind of miss it now."
'Finish school'
Tanner said he was glad he'd obtained his under
graduate degree. "I would advise all players now to
go all the way through school and get an education.
Sooner or later, they're going to need it."
Tanner added that tennis is getting more competi
tive. "It's much tougher now than it was for me when
I turned pro. Whitlinger and Delaney are as good as I
was. There are just more good players."
Delaney was very willing to corroborate Tanner's
testimony after suffering a three-set loss to Mike
Machette, another survivor of the qualifying rounds.

The only four-time All-American in Stanford his
tory. Delaney now carries a world ranking of 83rd in
his second year on the tour — but he's still had a hard
time getting beyond the early rounds.
'Progress slow'
"I'm enjoying the tour, but progress is slow," he
said. "There are at least 150 great tennis players in
the world, and there just aren't any easy matches.
Like today — I expected to win. Machette played
well, but I don't know what the hell happened. That's
what makes the tour so tough."
Delaney discounted the legendary glamour of the
touring pro's life. "There's just so much practice
involved," he said. "When 1 was in Europe the only
town 1 got to see was Rome, and I shouldn't even have
done that. It really cost me when 1 played the next
week."
Still Delaney says he's "glad to be doing what I'm
doing." and he has wins over Vitas Gerulaitas, Onny
Parun and Karl Meilerand what he calls "a summer
of almosts" to give promise that he may someday
break out of the pack.
Sandy Mayer has been anything but a journeyman
since his fabulous 1973 season, one of the best put
together by an amateur since the major tournaments
were opened to the pros. Since quitting the Stanford
team on the eve of the 1974 NCAA championships
(the Cards won anyway). Mayer has been highly erra
tic.
Temper
On Tuesday, though. Mayer showed little besides
his infamous temper in a straight-set loss to Bernie
Mitton of South Africa. A Mayer-inspired dispute
over the quality of the balls led to a 10-ininute delay
in the match, causing Mitton to charge Mayer with
stalling. "1 can't believe he did that," said Mitton.
"He made the match into a circus."
Mayer called the officiating "atrocious. It was the
most unusual match I've ever played. My reality was
not the prevalent reality.
"I felt completely on another level," he said.
"Higher or lower I don't know. I couldn't even begin
to tell you what went on out there."
Circut life
Like his former teammates, Mayer said he thought
turning pro when he did had been the right decision.
"I left at the right time for me," he said. "I've been
having a great time since then. It'd be even better if I
were happier with circuit life.
"I don't particularly dig the traveling and living
out of a suitcase," he added. "It's really tough to stay
eager." Mayer skipped the summer tour and instead
enjoyed an excellent Reason with the World Team
Tennis New York Sets. He was named the outstand
ing male player in the league.
"I prefer team tennis to touring," he said. "1 attack
it more positively; I like having a home town. Some
times the tour is just insane. I think guys are going to
start realizing that playing 30 tournaments a year is
just way too much."
"I've never been able to understand him," Mitton
mused after the match. "He and his brother Gene are
just alike. The least little thing can set them off." In
this case Mitton's overpowering play sent Mayer off
to Hawaii, wherethe next tournament will be played,
a week ahead of time.

"I left at the right time for me," he said. "I've been
having a great time since then. It'd be even better if I
were happier with circuit life.
"I don't particularly dig the traveling and living
out of a suitcase," he added. "It's really tough to stay
eager." Mayer skipped the summer tour and instead
enjoyed an excellent Reason with the World Team
Tennis New York Sets. He was named the outstand
ing male player in the league.
"I prefer team tennis to touring," he said. "1 attack
it more positively; I like having a home town. Some
times the tour is just insane. I think guys are going to
start realizing that playing 30 tournaments a year is
just way too much."
"I've never been able to understand him," Mitton
mused after the match. "He and his brother Gene are
just alike. The least little thing can set them off." In
this case Mitton's overpowering play sent Mayer off
to Hawaii, wherethe next tournament will be played,
a week ahead of time.

San Francisco —When the field assembled for the
$125,000 Fireman's Fund International Open Tennis
Championships at the Cow Palace, it could have
been billed as a Stanford tennis reunion.
But the party didn't last long. Of the seven former
Cardinals among the 54 entrants, only two survived
their first-round matches.
Chico Hagey, Rick Fisher, Jim Delaney and two
former NCAA champions, Sandy Mayer and John
Whitlinger, insured an early end to the get-together
by falling in the first round. Roscoe Tanner barely
missed joining the five when he defeated little
known Steve Docherty in a third-set tiebreaker. But
the few fans who stayed past midnight Tuesday saw
Nick Saviano score the biggest upset of his profes
sional career.
Former champ
Saviano, who turned pro last March in the middle
of his junior year, stunned Ross Case, the ninth seed
and 1974 Fireman's Fund singles champion, 4-6,6-3,
6-3. .
Saviano, with a strong serve and an improved vol
ley, seemed to wear down Case, one of the quickest
players on the tour. Afterward, the former two-time
Stanford All-American said he had no regrets about
leaving school for the pros.
"I like the tour much better," he said. "There's a
lot more pressure, and you have to discipline your
self. There's no one telling you 'This one':, a big
match.' "
'Good test'
Saviano said the pro tour is "a good test of a per
son's character. I would have liked to stay in school,
but for me it wasn't the best situation."
When asked if he thought his game had improved
since he left Stanford, Saviano said, "Definitely. You
either improve or you sink. There's nothing tougher
than qualifying."
When Saviano made the jump to the pros, he faced
the same realization as almost all other rookies. He
was no longer a star; now he was just another player.
"It's quite a blow to your ego," Saviano said. "It's
just a matter of being mentally tough and gutsing it
out week to week."
Tanner No. 12
In his fourth year out of Stanford, Tanner has es
tablished himself as the 12th-ranked player in the
world. Still, he wasn't surprised that he had so much
trouble with Docherty, who had to qualify to enter
the Fireman's Fund.
"There are so many good players," Tanner said. "I
expect every guy to be difficult. Every guy has his
own particular strength — that's why you see so
many upsets."
Tartner, seeded third in the tournament, said it
bothered him that the Bay Area crowd was clearly
rooting for Docherty, the underdog. "It would be
nice," he said, "where I played for three years, to at
least have a few people like what was going on. I got
ahead and people always pull for the underdog."
Tanner instrumental
Tanner was the guy who, along with Card tennis
coach Dick Gould, built Stanford into a national ten
nis power. The Cards became NCAA championship

contenders with Tanner, but the Tennessean turned
pro the year before they actually won the title in
1973. He still graduated on time.
"It was only after a lot of discussion with coach
Gould that I turned pro," Tanner said. "We had an
unbelievably strong team that year. My goal when I
came to Stanford was to get Stanford a national
championship. I felt for my tennis the best thing to do
was go ahead and turn pro, but I would not have done
it if I didn't think Stanford could win the national
championship without me. I thought we would win
it, and we did win it."
Tanner said Gould was a big factor in his decision
to attend Stanford.
"The guy you're going to be around most is the
coach," Tanner said. "I had to try to sit down and
decide which coach I wanted to be around most. That
guy was Gould. He's a helluva guy and a terrific
coach."
Gould was not the only reason though that Tanner
came to the Farm. "I wanted to go to one of the best
schools in the country, which Stanford is," he said.
"You kind of fall in love with the campus, and there's
every type of person there. I kind of miss it now."
'Finish school'
Tanner said he was glad he'd obtained his under
graduate degree. "I would advise all players now to
go all the way through school and get an education.
Sooner or later, they're going to need it."
Tanner added that tennis is getting more competi
tive. "It's much tougher now than it was for me when
I turned pro. Whitlinger and Delaney are as good as I
was. There are just more good players."
Delaney was very willing to corroborate Tanner's
testimony after suffering a three-set loss to Mike
Machette, another survivor of the qualifying rounds.

The only four-time All-American in Stanford his
tory. Delaney now carries a world ranking of 83rd in
his second year on the tour — but he's still had a hard
time getting beyond the early rounds.
'Progress slow'
"I'm enjoying the tour, but progress is slow," he
said. "There are at least 150 great tennis players in
the world, and there just aren't any easy matches.
Like today — I expected to win. Machette played
well, but I don't know what the hell happened. That's
what makes the tour so tough."
Delaney discounted the legendary glamour of the
touring pro's life. "There's just so much practice
involved," he said. "When 1 was in Europe the only
town 1 got to see was Rome, and I shouldn't even have
done that. It really cost me when 1 played the next
week."
Still Delaney says he's "glad to be doing what I'm
doing." and he has wins over Vitas Gerulaitas, Onny
Parun and Karl Meilerand what he calls "a summer
of almosts" to give promise that he may someday
break out of the pack.
Sandy Mayer has been anything but a journeyman
since his fabulous 1973 season, one of the best put
together by an amateur since the major tournaments
were opened to the pros. Since quitting the Stanford
team on the eve of the 1974 NCAA championships
(the Cards won anyway). Mayer has been highly erra
tic.
Temper
On Tuesday, though. Mayer showed little besides
his infamous temper in a straight-set loss to Bernie
Mitton of South Africa. A Mayer-inspired dispute
over the quality of the balls led to a 10-ininute delay
in the match, causing Mitton to charge Mayer with
stalling. "1 can't believe he did that," said Mitton.
"He made the match into a circus."
Mayer called the officiating "atrocious. It was the
most unusual match I've ever played. My reality was
not the prevalent reality.
"I felt completely on another level," he said.
"Higher or lower I don't know. I couldn't even begin
to tell you what went on out there."
Circut life
Like his former teammates, Mayer said he thought
turning pro when he did had been the right decision.
"I left at the right time for me," he said. "I've been
having a great time since then. It'd be even better if I

together by an amateur since the major tournaments
were opened to the pros. Since quitting the Stanford
team on the eve of the 1974 NCAA championships
(the Cards won anyway). Mayer has been highly erra
tic.
Temper
On Tuesday, though. Mayer showed little besides
his infamous temper in a straight-set loss to Bernie
Mitton of South Africa. A Mayer-inspired dispute
over the quality of the balls led to a 10-ininute delay
in the match, causing Mitton to charge Mayer with
stalling. "1 can't believe he did that," said Mitton.
"He made the match into a circus."
Mayer called the officiating "atrocious. It was the
most unusual match I've ever played. My reality was
not the prevalent reality.
"I felt completely on another level," he said.
"Higher or lower I don't know. I couldn't even begin
to tell you what went on out there."
Circut life
Like his former teammates, Mayer said he thought
turning pro when he did had been the right decision.
"I left at the right time for me," he said. "I've been
having a great time since then. It'd be even better if I
were happier with circuit life.
"I don't particularly dig the traveling and living
out of a suitcase," he added. "It's really tough to stay
eager." Mayer skipped the summer tour and instead
enjoyed an excellent Reason with the World Team
Tennis New York Sets. He was named the outstand
ing male player in the league.
"I prefer team tennis to touring," he said. "1 attack
it more positively; I like having a home town. Some
times the tour is just insane. I think guys are going to
start realizing that playing 30 tournaments a year is
just way too much."
"I've never been able to understand him," Mitton
mused after the match. "He and his brother Gene are
just alike. The least little thing can set them off." In
this case Mitton's overpowering play sent Mayer off
to Hawaii, wherethe next tournament will be played,
a week ahead of time.

San Francisco —When the field assembled for the
$125,000 Fireman's Fund International Open Tennis
Championships at the Cow Palace, it could have
been billed as a Stanford tennis reunion.
But the party didn't last long. Of the seven former
Cardinals among the 54 entrants, only two survived
their first-round matches.
Chico Hagey, Rick Fisher, Jim Delaney and two
former NCAA champions, Sandy Mayer and John
Whitlinger, insured an early end to the get-together
by falling in the first round. Roscoe Tanner barely
missed joining the five when he defeated little
known Steve Docherty in a third-set tiebreaker. But
the few fans who stayed past midnight Tuesday saw
Nick Saviano score the biggest upset of his profes
sional career.
Former champ
Saviano, who turned pro last March in the middle
of his junior year, stunned Ross Case, the ninth seed
and 1974 Fireman's Fund singles champion, 4-6,6-3,
6-3. .
Saviano, with a strong serve and an improved vol
ley, seemed to wear down Case, one of the quickest
players on the tour. Afterward, the former two-time
Stanford All-American said he had no regrets about
leaving school for the pros.
"I like the tour much better," he said. "There's a
lot more pressure, and you have to discipline your
self. There's no one telling you 'This one':, a big
match.' "
'Good test'
Saviano said the pro tour is "a good test of a per
son's character. I would have liked to stay in school,
but for me it wasn't the best situation."
When asked if he thought his game had improved
since he left Stanford, Saviano said, "Definitely. You
either improve or you sink. There's nothing tougher
than qualifying."
When Saviano made the jump to the pros, he faced
the same realization as almost all other rookies. He
was no longer a star; now he was just another player.
"It's quite a blow to your ego," Saviano said. "It's
just a matter of being mentally tough and gutsing it
out week to week."
Tanner No. 12
In his fourth year out of Stanford, Tanner has es
tablished himself as the 12th-ranked player in the
world. Still, he wasn't surprised that he had so much
trouble with Docherty, who had to qualify to enter
the Fireman's Fund.
"There are so many good players," Tanner said. "I
expect every guy to be difficult. Every guy has his
own particular strength — that's why you see so
many upsets."
Tartner, seeded third in the tournament, said it
bothered him that the Bay Area crowd was clearly
rooting for Docherty, the underdog. "It would be
nice," he said, "where I played for three years, to at
least have a few people like what was going on. I got
ahead and people always pull for the underdog."
Tanner instrumental
Tanner was the guy who, along with Card tennis
coach Dick Gould, built Stanford into a national ten
nis power. The Cards became NCAA championship

contenders with Tanner, but the Tennessean turned
pro the year before they actually won the title in
1973. He still graduated on time.
"It was only after a lot of discussion with coach
Gould that I turned pro," Tanner said. "We had an
unbelievably strong team that year. My goal when I
came to Stanford was to get Stanford a national
championship. I felt for my tennis the best thing to do
was go ahead and turn pro, but I would not have done
it if I didn't think Stanford could win the national
championship without me. I thought we would win
it, and we did win it."
Tanner said Gould was a big factor in his decision
to attend Stanford.
"The guy you're going to be around most is the
coach," Tanner said. "I had to try to sit down and
decide which coach I wanted to be around most. That
guy was Gould. He's a helluva guy and a terrific
coach."
Gould was not the only reason though that Tanner
came to the Farm. "I wanted to go to one of the best
schools in the country, which Stanford is," he said.
"You kind of fall in love with the campus, and there's
every type of person there. I kind of miss it now."
'Finish school'
Tanner said he was glad he'd obtained his under
graduate degree. "I would advise all players now to
go all the way through school and get an education.
Sooner or later, they're going to need it."
Tanner added that tennis is getting more competi
tive. "It's much tougher now than it was for me when
I turned pro. Whitlinger and Delaney are as good as I
was. There are just more good players."
Delaney was very willing to corroborate Tanner's
testimony after suffering a three-set loss to Mike
Machette, another survivor of the qualifying rounds.

The only four-time All-American in Stanford his
tory. Delaney now carries a world ranking of 83rd in
his second year on the tour — but he's still had a hard
time getting beyond the early rounds.
'Progress slow'
"I'm enjoying the tour, but progress is slow," he
said. "There are at least 150 great tennis players in
the world, and there just aren't any easy matches.
Like today — I expected to win. Machette played
well, but I don't know what the hell happened. That's
what makes the tour so tough."
Delaney discounted the legendary glamour of the
touring pro's life. "There's just so much practice
involved," he said. "When 1 was in Europe the only
town 1 got to see was Rome, and I shouldn't even have
done that. It really cost me when 1 played the next
week."
Still Delaney says he's "glad to be doing what I'm
doing." and he has wins over Vitas Gerulaitas, Onny
Parun and Karl Meilerand what he calls "a summer
of almosts" to give promise that he may someday
break out of the pack.
Sandy Mayer has been anything but a journeyman

"I'm enjoying the tour, but progress is slow," he
said. "There are at least 150 great tennis players in
the world, and there just aren't any easy matches.
Like today — I expected to win. Machette played
well, but I don't know what the hell happened. That's
what makes the tour so tough."
Delaney discounted the legendary glamour of the
touring pro's life. "There's just so much practice
involved," he said. "When 1 was in Europe the only
town 1 got to see was Rome, and I shouldn't even have
done that. It really cost me when 1 played the next
week."
Still Delaney says he's "glad to be doing what I'm
doing." and he has wins over Vitas Gerulaitas, Onny
Parun and Karl Meilerand what he calls "a summer
of almosts" to give promise that he may someday
break out of the pack.
Sandy Mayer has been anything but a journeyman
since his fabulous 1973 season, one of the best put
together by an amateur since the major tournaments
were opened to the pros. Since quitting the Stanford
team on the eve of the 1974 NCAA championships
(the Cards won anyway). Mayer has been highly erra
tic.
Temper
On Tuesday, though. Mayer showed little besides
his infamous temper in a straight-set loss to Bernie
Mitton of South Africa. A Mayer-inspired dispute
over the quality of the balls led to a 10-ininute delay
in the match, causing Mitton to charge Mayer with
stalling. "1 can't believe he did that," said Mitton.
"He made the match into a circus."
Mayer called the officiating "atrocious. It was the
most unusual match I've ever played. My reality was
not the prevalent reality.
"I felt completely on another level," he said.
"Higher or lower I don't know. I couldn't even begin
to tell you what went on out there."
Circut life
Like his former teammates, Mayer said he thought
turning pro when he did had been the right decision.
"I left at the right time for me," he said. "I've been
having a great time since then. It'd be even better if I
were happier with circuit life.
"I don't particularly dig the traveling and living
out of a suitcase," he added. "It's really tough to stay
eager." Mayer skipped the summer tour and instead
enjoyed an excellent Reason with the World Team
Tennis New York Sets. He was named the outstand
ing male player in the league.
"I prefer team tennis to touring," he said. "1 attack
it more positively; I like having a home town. Some
times the tour is just insane. I think guys are going to
start realizing that playing 30 tournaments a year is
just way too much."
"I've never been able to understand him," Mitton
mused after the match. "He and his brother Gene are
just alike. The least little thing can set them off." In
this case Mitton's overpowering play sent Mayer off
to Hawaii, wherethe next tournament will be played,
a week ahead of time.

San Francisco —When the field assembled for the
$125,000 Fireman's Fund International Open Tennis
Championships at the Cow Palace, it could have
been billed as a Stanford tennis reunion.
But the party didn't last long. Of the seven former
Cardinals among the 54 entrants, only two survived
their first-round matches.
Chico Hagey, Rick Fisher, Jim Delaney and two
former NCAA champions, Sandy Mayer and John
Whitlinger, insured an early end to the get-together
by falling in the first round. Roscoe Tanner barely
missed joining the five when he defeated little
known Steve Docherty in a third-set tiebreaker. But
the few fans who stayed past midnight Tuesday saw
Nick Saviano score the biggest upset of his profes
sional career.
Former champ
Saviano, who turned pro last March in the middle
of his junior year, stunned Ross Case, the ninth seed
and 1974 Fireman's Fund singles champion, 4-6,6-3,
6-3. .
Saviano, with a strong serve and an improved vol
ley, seemed to wear down Case, one of the quickest
players on the tour. Afterward, the former two-time
Stanford All-American said he had no regrets about
leaving school for the pros.
"I like the tour much better," he said. "There's a
lot more pressure, and you have to discipline your
self. There's no one telling you 'This one':, a big
match.' "
'Good test'
Saviano said the pro tour is "a good test of a per
son's character. I would have liked to stay in school,
but for me it wasn't the best situation."
When asked if he thought his game had improved
since he left Stanford, Saviano said, "Definitely. You
either improve or you sink. There's nothing tougher
than qualifying."
When Saviano made the jump to the pros, he faced
the same realization as almost all other rookies. He
was no longer a star; now he was just another player.
"It's quite a blow to your ego," Saviano said. "It's
just a matter of being mentally tough and gutsing it
out week to week."
Tanner No. 12
In his fourth year out of Stanford, Tanner has es
tablished himself as the 12th-ranked player in the
world. Still, he wasn't surprised that he had so much
trouble with Docherty, who had to qualify to enter
the Fireman's Fund.
"There are so many good players," Tanner said. "I
expect every guy to be difficult. Every guy has his
own particular strength — that's why you see so
many upsets."
Tartner, seeded third in the tournament, said it
bothered him that the Bay Area crowd was clearly
rooting for Docherty, the underdog. "It would be
nice," he said, "where I played for three years, to at
least have a few people like what was going on. I got
ahead and people always pull for the underdog."
Tanner instrumental
Tanner was the guy who, along with Card tennis
coach Dick Gould, built Stanford into a national ten
nis power. The Cards became NCAA championship

contenders with Tanner, but the Tennessean turned
pro the year before they actually won the title in
1973. He still graduated on time.
"It was only after a lot of discussion with coach
Gould that I turned pro," Tanner said. "We had an
unbelievably strong team that year. My goal when I
came to Stanford was to get Stanford a national
championship. I felt for my tennis the best thing to do
was go ahead and turn pro, but I would not have done
it if I didn't think Stanford could win the national
championship without me. I thought we would win
it, and we did win it."
Tanner said Gould was a big factor in his decision
to attend Stanford.
"The guy you're going to be around most is the
coach," Tanner said. "I had to try to sit down and
decide which coach I wanted to be around most. That
guy was Gould. He's a helluva guy and a terrific
coach."
Gould was not the only reason though that Tanner
came to the Farm. "I wanted to go to one of the best
schools in the country, which Stanford is," he said.
"You kind of fall in love with the campus, and there's
every type of person there. I kind of miss it now."
'Finish school'
Tanner said he was glad he'd obtained his under
graduate degree. "I would advise all players now to
go all the way through school and get an education.
Sooner or later, they're going to need it."
Tanner added that tennis is getting more competi
tive. "It's much tougher now than it was for me when
I turned pro. Whitlinger and Delaney are as good as I
was. There are just more good players."
Delaney was very willing to corroborate Tanner's
testimony after suffering a three-set loss to Mike
Machette, another survivor of the qualifying rounds.

The only four-time All-American in Stanford his
tory. Delaney now carries a world ranking of 83rd in
his second year on the tour — but he's still had a hard
time getting beyond the early rounds.
'Progress slow'

said. "There are at least 150 great tennis players in
the world, and there just aren't any easy matches.
