Kissinger warns USSR on Africa
United Nations, N.Y. — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, in his annual speech to the United Na
tions, declared yesterday that southern Africa is on
a course toward peace and racial justice but outside
powers "fueling the flames of war and racial
hatred" could "doom opportunities that might
never return."
He said the United States is disturbed that rivalry
and interference of non-African powers would
"make a mockery of Africa's hard-won struggle for
independence from foreign domination."
Kissinger's remarks were clearly aimed at the
Soviet Union, which has established footholds in a
number of African countries and is a principal arms
supplier for insurgents in southern Africa. At the
same time, he denied that the United States intends
to stake out its own sphere of influence on the
continent.
In a report on his recent shuttle diplomacy to
southern Africa, Kissinger said Namibia appears
headed toward independence from South Africa
"within a fixed, short time limit" and that black
majority rule in Rhodesia is in the offing within two
years.
The region, he said, is "an acid test of the world's
hope for peace and justice." He said diplomatic
failure in Namibia — the South African-controlled
territory also called South-West Africa — and in
Rhodesia could make southern Africa "a vicious
battleground with consequences for every part of
the world."
Ford denies Carter charges
Prodded by Jimmy Carter to discuss his past
campaign finances and corporation-paid golfing
weekends, President Ford said yesterday that no
campaign funds ever went for his personal use and
he is certain there was no impropriety.
"I am certain that when the investigation is com
pleted, that I wil 1 be free of any allegations such as I
have read about," the president told a news confer
ence. "As long as my conscience is clear. I have no
real problem."
Carter, in turn, told reporters the president's de
claration ends.the matter as far as he is concerned.
Syrians pin PLO forces
Aley, Lebanon — Palestinian guerrillas suffered
a major loss to Syrian forces early yesterday and the
top guerrilla leadership met in this mountain resort
to decide whether to continue fighting or to

negotiate.
Syrian armored units kept up their advance and
clashed with guerrilla forward positions five miles
from the villa where over-all guerrilla chief Yasir
Arafat met with his senior military lieutenants.
A Palestinian source said they were choosing
between "war or talks."
There was no word yesterday on responses to
Egypt's call Wednesday for a limited Arab summit
within 48 hours to deal with the exacerbated crisis
in the 17-month-old Lebanese civil war. Ceasefire
efforts by new Lebanese President Elias Sarkis and
Arab League mediator Hassan Sabri kholi have so
far proved futile.
Gold sale to aid poor nations
Manila — Top figures in international finance
begin meeting here Monday to decide the best way
to sell 25 million ounces of gold to help poor coun
tries falling deeper into debt to the rich.
Gold and debt are the priority items listed for a
joint meeting of the directors of the Washington
based World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
Among the 3000 invited participants in the meet
ings here will be heads of the world's richest pri
vate banks and governors of the most powerful
central banking systems. The sessions are not
strictly for capitalists, since communist nations
will be represented.
The European Common Market countries have
urged the reopening of discussions on IMF auc
tions of 25 million ounces of gold, designed to
provide a special fund to help poor countries with
their deepening balance of payments problems.
Although industrialized countries have shown
surpluses in their payments balances, those of poor
lands have dropped to deficits expected to total
about $32 billion this year. Economic improve
ments also have made small impact among the
ranks of the unemployed, a problem for both the
rich and poor countries.
Prospect for Mars life dims
Pasadena — The Viking mission's chances of
finding life on Mars were dealt a blow yesterday
when latest data from the Viking 2 robot showed no
sign of organic material in the Martian soil.
Life as we know it is not possible without or
ganics — tiny chains of carbon atoms — and neither
of the Viking landers have found organic matter in
their probes of Mars' red soil.
Gentry Lee, director of the mission's science
analysis, said there was still the possibility of life

on Mars, but admitted it was difficult to "explain no
organics."
Scientists said Viking 2 will conduct further
searches for organics — including a dig under a
Martian rock — but there was not much hope here
at Jet Propulsion Laboratory that the elusive "build
ing blocks of life" would be found.
Cleaver requests secret files
Oakland — Former Black Panther party leader
Eldridge Cleaver sought access yesterday to gov
ernment liles that his attorneys said would reveal a
campaign to destroy him and the party.
Cleaver made the request to Alameda County
Superior Court Judge Alan A. Lindsay as the judge
scheduled his long-delayed trial for Jan. 24.
Cleaver is charged with three counts of attempted
murder and three of assault with a deadly weapon
on a police officer in an April 1968 shootout that
claimed the life of Black Panther party member
Bobby Hutton.
Defense attorneys Patrick S. Hallinan and
Samuel R. Cross filed 200 pages of motions aimed
at forcing the district attorney's office to obtain and
turn over documents held by federal investigative
agencies, including the FBI.
"There's every reason to believe that Eldridge
Cleaver has been the object of a systematic attempt
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other
governmental agencies to destroy his effectiveness
as a political leader and to destroy him personally
as part of a larger objective of destroying the Black
Panther party," the defense contended in the mo
tions.
Higher phone rates fought
Los Angeles — A utility watchdog group filed a
complaint yesterday with the Public Utilities
Commission to halt implementations of a new mes
sage rate timing service by the Pacific Telephone
Co.
Representatives of the Campaign Against Utility
Exploitation (CAUSE) said at a news conference
following filing of the complaint that the com
pany's single message rate timing service (SMRTS)
could conceivably cut the number of "free" calls a
customer can make in half or more.
