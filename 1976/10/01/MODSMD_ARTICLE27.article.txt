# Stanford Press shuts its doors
## 
### Bob Svikhart 
After publishing scholarly books
for more than HO years, the printing
division of the Stanford Press will
close down all printing operations ex
cept binding in approximately two
weeks.
"We are in the very last stages of
production," said Stanford Press Act
ing Director J. G. Bell. "The pressroom
will close down within the next week
and the bindery will not shut down
until November because we still have
some work to do in that department."
The Stanford University Board of
Trustees decided last spring that this
summer would be the final printing
season for the press.
The printing operation was discon
tinued because the press operates with
the antiquated linotype system instead
of the computer-operated photo
composition units used by most mod
ern printers. The university decided
that changing to the photo composi
tion and replacing old presses, which
would cost $750,000 to $1,000,000
would be too expensive.
"It made no sense for us to continue
with linotype," Bell added. "We just
couldn't be competitive as far as price
was concerned without the new photo
composition process. We hoped to
persuade the trustees to approve the
purchase of the new equipment, but
we realize that the university has
priorities."
Approximately 40 people will be
laid off when all printing operations
are halted, but Bell reports that "a
gratifyingly large proportion have
found new jobs, and a number of
others who haven't found employment
do not seem to be too distressed,
perhaps due to the generous severance
pay offered by the university."
"I was really down in the dumps
when 1 first contemplated the un
employment due to the closing of the
press. However, the people who
worked for the press were good
people, and good people seem to be
able to find good jobs. At least 25 of the
40 workers who are in the process of
being laid off have found new jobs."
When asked about his views on the
closing of the printing operations, Bell

said: "I have liked having a press
downstairs (below his second-story of
fice on Santa Teresa Street, where the
press is located) because of the con
venience that it offered. I don't think
that it will be as easy to maintain qual
ity control with the printing opera
tions taking place outside of this build
ing.'*
The printing division equipment
will be auctioned off in December, ac
cording to Bell, and auctioneers esti
mate that $150,000 will be raised by
the auction.

do not seem to be too distressed,
perhaps due to the generous severance
pay offered by the university."
"I was really down in the dumps
when 1 first contemplated the un
employment due to the closing of the
press. However, the people who
worked for the press were good
people, and good people seem to be
able to find good jobs. At least 25 of the
40 workers who are in the process of
being laid off have found new jobs."
When asked about his views on the
closing of the printing operations, Bell

said: "I have liked having a press
downstairs (below his second-story of
fice on Santa Teresa Street, where the
press is located) because of the con
venience that it offered. I don't think
that it will be as easy to maintain qual
ity control with the printing opera
tions taking place outside of this build
ing.'*
The printing division equipment
will be auctioned off in December, ac
cording to Bell, and auctioneers esti
mate that $150,000 will be raised by
the auction.
After publishing scholarly books
for more than HO years, the printing
division of the Stanford Press will
close down all printing operations ex
cept binding in approximately two
weeks.
"We are in the very last stages of
production," said Stanford Press Act
ing Director J. G. Bell. "The pressroom
will close down within the next week
and the bindery will not shut down
until November because we still have
some work to do in that department."
The Stanford University Board of
Trustees decided last spring that this
summer would be the final printing
season for the press.
The printing operation was discon
tinued because the press operates with
the antiquated linotype system instead
of the computer-operated photo
composition units used by most mod
ern printers. The university decided
that changing to the photo composi
tion and replacing old presses, which
would cost $750,000 to $1,000,000
would be too expensive.
"It made no sense for us to continue
with linotype," Bell added. "We just
couldn't be competitive as far as price
was concerned without the new photo
composition process. We hoped to
persuade the trustees to approve the
purchase of the new equipment, but
we realize that the university has
priorities."
Approximately 40 people will be
laid off when all printing operations
are halted, but Bell reports that "a
gratifyingly large proportion have
found new jobs, and a number of
others who haven't found employment
do not seem to be too distressed,
perhaps due to the generous severance
pay offered by the university."
