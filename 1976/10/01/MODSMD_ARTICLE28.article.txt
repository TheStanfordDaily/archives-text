Bargaining teams from the United
Stanford Employees and the univer
sity met yesterday in an effort to re
solve the outstanding issues in the
USE contract talks.
The teams surveyed their differ
ences Wednesday and agreed to meet
intensively until an accord is reached.
Bargaining representatives from
both sides were unavailable for com
ment in order to "devote their undi
vided attention" to the talks which are
continuing today.
