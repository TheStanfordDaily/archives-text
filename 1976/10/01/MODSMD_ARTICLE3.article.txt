# Ford veto overriden by House
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The House
voted Tuesday to override President
Gerald P'ord's veto of a $56.6 billion
appropriation but both chambers ap
proved a revenue sharing bill Ford
sought.
Passage of the much-compromised
revenue sharing bill to channel more
federal receipts to states and local gov
ernments apparently met Ford's con
dition for cooperating in plans for ad
journment.
He had held up action on a $3.7 bill

ion public works job bill and another
measure extending 260,000 public
service jobs in state and local govern
ments, but Speaker Carl Albert told the
House on Thursday afternoon that
Ford would sign the two bills.
Assuming Ford's signature of the
bills by Friday, leaders plan to wind up
the business of the session then. They
plan token sessions Saturday and
Monday to comply with a technicality
involving regulations of the Federal
Election Commission.
The 312-93 House vote to override
the veto of the money bill for the De
partments of Labor and of Health, Edu
cation.and Welfare found 65 Republi
cans lining up with 247 Democrats to
override, while 71 Republicans and 22
Democrats voted to sustain.
Senate vote next
The Senate must vote on the veto
next.
Ford had objected to the appropria
tion because it was $4 billion above his
budget recommendation.

After prolonged debate and par
liamentary maneuvering, the House
passed 292 to 111 a bill extending the
revenue-sharing program which
channels a portion of federal tax col
lections to states and local units of
government.
Revenue sharing continued
The Senate voted 77 to 4 to concur
with the House on revenue sharing
and sent the legislation on to the White
House.
The measure would continue the
program for three years and nine
months beyond its present expiration
date of Dec. 31,1976. It earmarks $24.9
billion for the entire period but has a
provision that could provide an addi
tional $600 million. Depending on in
creases in federal personal income
taxes, $200 million would beadded for
each of the years beginning Oct. 1,
1977, 1978 and 1979.
Mayor Ken Gibson of Newark, pres
ident of the U.S. Conference of Mayors,
said Congress had no choice but to ex

tend the revenue sharing program.
"Every local government official in the
country would have been in an uproar
if just four weeks before the election
Congress rejected the bill," Gibson
said in a statement.


Marchers rally
Approximately 25 Bay Area Iranian students marched through the campus
yesterday afternoon protesting recent U.S. arms sales to Iran. The mem-

bers of the Iranian Students Association were participating in a two-day
march from San Jose to San Francisco. The group has planned a noon
rally in front of the Iranian consulate in San Francisco today.

Approximately 25 Bay Area Iranian students marched through the campus
yesterday afternoon protesting recent U.S. arms sales to Iran. The mem-

bers of the Iranian Students Association were participating in a two-day
march from San Jose to San Francisco. The group has planned a noon
rally in front of the Iranian consulate in San Francisco today.
Washington (AP) — The House
voted Tuesday to override President
Gerald P'ord's veto of a $56.6 billion
appropriation but both chambers ap
proved a revenue sharing bill Ford
sought.
Passage of the much-compromised
revenue sharing bill to channel more
federal receipts to states and local gov
ernments apparently met Ford's con
dition for cooperating in plans for ad
journment.
He had held up action on a $3.7 bill

ion public works job bill and another
measure extending 260,000 public
service jobs in state and local govern
ments, but Speaker Carl Albert told the
House on Thursday afternoon that
Ford would sign the two bills.
Assuming Ford's signature of the
bills by Friday, leaders plan to wind up
the business of the session then. They
plan token sessions Saturday and
Monday to comply with a technicality
involving regulations of the Federal
Election Commission.
The 312-93 House vote to override
the veto of the money bill for the De
partments of Labor and of Health, Edu
cation.and Welfare found 65 Republi
cans lining up with 247 Democrats to
override, while 71 Republicans and 22
Democrats voted to sustain.
Senate vote next
The Senate must vote on the veto
next.
Ford had objected to the appropria
tion because it was $4 billion above his
budget recommendation.

After prolonged debate and par
liamentary maneuvering, the House
passed 292 to 111 a bill extending the
revenue-sharing program which
channels a portion of federal tax col
lections to states and local units of
government.
Revenue sharing continued
The Senate voted 77 to 4 to concur
with the House on revenue sharing
and sent the legislation on to the White
House.
The measure would continue the
program for three years and nine
months beyond its present expiration
date of Dec. 31,1976. It earmarks $24.9
billion for the entire period but has a
provision that could provide an addi
tional $600 million. Depending on in
creases in federal personal income
taxes, $200 million would beadded for
each of the years beginning Oct. 1,
1977, 1978 and 1979.
Mayor Ken Gibson of Newark, pres
ident of the U.S. Conference of Mayors,
said Congress had no choice but to ex

tend the revenue sharing program.
"Every local government official in the
country would have been in an uproar
if just four weeks before the election
Congress rejected the bill," Gibson
said in a statement.
