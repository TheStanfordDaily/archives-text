# Road expansion raises controversy

Does a wider road invite more traffic
and new land development, or will it
ease congestion and provide more
housing for those who work and study
on university lands?

Willow-Sand Hill Road has touched
off this familiar debate between the
"no-growth" environmentalists and
"planned growth" business interests
in the Palo Alto-Menlo Park commun
ity-
On September 21 the Menlo Park
City Council held a public hearing
which occasioned vocal protest from
13 opponents who attacked both the
short-range futility and the long-range
threat of the construction plan for
Willow-Sand Hill Road.
At issue is the plan for the expansion
of the road, from two to four lanes,
between El Camino, where it borders
the Stanford Shopping Center, and
Santa Cruz Avenue, which is a major
route to downtown Menlo Park.
Two years ago Palo Alto approved
the plan for the portion of the road
which lies within its own city limits.
Menlo Park's battle
Now Menlo Park residents are battl
ing over the section of road under their
jurisdiction.
"There isn't going to be any long
range 'traffic alleyization.' " Tom
Black, a Menlo Park resident and unof
ficial leader of the opposition, said
yesterday."It will only invite more
traffic to Menlo Park's doorstep."
Opponents are particularly con
cerned about the related issue of the
university's intention to develop a
45-acre tract along Willow Road bet
ween the Oak Creek Apartments and
the Children's Hospital.
'Medium-sized' complex
According to the Willow Road pro
ject's Environmental Impact Report.

"The improved traffic conditions of a
widened Willow Road may remove a
potential block to development of a
medium-sized (800-1200 units)
apartment complex at this site."
This "medium-sized" complex
dwarks the existing 759-unit Oak
Creek complex, point out critics. And

"everybody groans about the traffic
that has been generated by Oak Creek,"
noted Menlo Park resident Lorraine
Downing.
University officials are quick to de
fend their development plans, as well
as their endorsement of the overall
widening proposal.
Stanford response
"Our neighbors have asked for many
years why Stanford has not provided
more housing for those who study and
work on university lands; such a pro
ject on the 45 acres would help al
leviate the local housing shortage and
reduce commuting." wrote Director of
Community Relations Andrew Doty in
a September 23 letter to the Palo Alto
7'imes.
Opponents fear the widening por
tends a resurgence of the "Willow
Road Expressway" plan. That project,
an east-west corridor between U.S.
Highway 101 and Interstate 280. was
defeated in a referendum in 1972.
If the present plan is realized, warns
Black, "it's only a matter of time before
the route is completed to the Bayshore
Freeway."
Doty denies this intention is behind
the university support of the Willow
Road project.
To allay the fears of the anti.-
growth camp. Doty said, "The day of
superhighways going through resi
dential areas is gone. The funds aren't
available. Any city council that ap
proved a resolution through either of
those cities to Bayshore would proba
bly be out of office in the next elec
tion."

route to downtown Menlo Park.

the plan for the portion of the road

Menlo Park's battle
Now Menlo Park residents are battl
ing over the section of road under their
jurisdiction.
"There isn't going to be any long
range 'traffic alleyization.' " Tom
Black, a Menlo Park resident and unof
ficial leader of the opposition, said
yesterday."It will only invite more
traffic to Menlo Park's doorstep."
Opponents are particularly con
cerned about the related issue of the
university's intention to develop a
45-acre tract along Willow Road bet
ween the Oak Creek Apartments and
the Children's Hospital.
'Medium-sized' complex
According to the Willow Road pro
ject's Environmental Impact Report.

"The improved traffic conditions of a
widened Willow Road may remove a
potential block to development of a
medium-sized (800-1200 units)
apartment complex at this site."
This "medium-sized" complex
dwarks the existing 759-unit Oak
Creek complex, point out critics. And

"everybody groans about the traffic
that has been generated by Oak Creek,"
noted Menlo Park resident Lorraine
Downing.
University officials are quick to de
fend their development plans, as well
as their endorsement of the overall
widening proposal.
Stanford response
"Our neighbors have asked for many
years why Stanford has not provided
more housing for those who study and
work on university lands; such a pro
ject on the 45 acres would help al
leviate the local housing shortage and
reduce commuting." wrote Director of
Community Relations Andrew Doty in
a September 23 letter to the Palo Alto
7'imes.
Opponents fear the widening por
tends a resurgence of the "Willow
Road Expressway" plan. That project,
an east-west corridor between U.S.
Highway 101 and Interstate 280. was
defeated in a referendum in 1972.
If the present plan is realized, warns
Black, "it's only a matter of time before
the route is completed to the Bayshore
Freeway."
Doty denies this intention is behind
the university support of the Willow
Road project.
To allay the fears of the anti.-
growth camp. Doty said, "The day of
superhighways going through resi
dential areas is gone. The funds aren't
available. Any city council that ap
proved a resolution through either of
those cities to Bayshore would proba
bly be out of office in the next elec
tion."
Does a wider road invite more traffic
and new land development, or will it
ease congestion and provide more
housing for those who work and study
on university lands?
