# Rain deters Prop. 14 supporters

### Emily Sachar 
As some 150 listeners heard Richard
Chavez speak in favor of Proposition
14 yesterday at Memorial Church, op
ponents of the proposition announced
plans to send 50,?)0() farmers into Los
Angeles and San Francisco next
month.
Proposition 14 provides that farm
workers can hold secret-ballot elec
tions to decide whether the United
Farm Workers (UFW). the Teamsters
or no union will represent them. In
addition, the proposition will reacti
vate the Agriculture Labor Relations
Board in order to validate over 100
elections not yet certified, so farm
workers can begin negotiating for con
tracts.
"Yes on 14" workers have been
highly visible here recently in their
voter registration drive, but atten
dance at the rally was held down by
rain, a change of site from White Plaza
to Memorial Church and the cancella
tion of the main speaker, Delores
Huerta.
Chavez gave a brief history of the
farm workers' movement and of the
initiative campaign to get Proposition
14 on the ballot.
After farm workers stated that they
wanted a union, elections were con
ducted. The farm workers won a
majority of those elections. Yet they
had run out of money, Chavez said.
Proposition 14 says that money must
be brought back and that the law must
function.
'Sweat and blood'
"It's a people action program for a
people's campaign. We have to get
people and we don't have the money.
The farm workers are giving up sweat
and blood and we have an obligation to
help and work with them," said Andy
Coe, assembly coordinator for the 21st
Assembly District.
The group discussed mass leaflet
ting. a bumpersticker campaign, and
other fund-raising tactics. During the
last 10 days of campaigning, there will
be state-wide human billboarding.
where people stand by signs urging
voters to cast a "yes" vote in favor of
the proposition.
"We want to get students and people
in California to know what's happen
ing with farm workers. They are a
group who feed us and yet they're
starving and treated very low." Cindy
Carlson of the Stanford Support Com
mittee said.
While "Yes on 14" speakers
stumped here for student support, in
Sacramento, "No on 14" President
Harry kubo announced plans to
mobilize farmer opposition.
