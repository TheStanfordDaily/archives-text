## Lyman destroys SJC credibility 
### 
Last May, 15 members of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity and 12 friends
vandalized four other fraternity houses on campus in the aftermath of a
bachelor party at the Delt house. During the vandalization less than
$200 of property was damaged and one student was assaulted. As a
result of those actions the university has taken disciplinary actions
against both the Delt fraternity and six of the individuals involved in
the occurrences.
The Delt fraternity was suspended from using its on-campus house
for three years. However, in June, Dean ot Student Affairs James Lyons
agreed that the Delts could apply for reinstatement after one year of
suspension because the house had disciplined those involved.
In July, the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC), the student-faculty judi
cial body, recommended to President Richard Lyman that each ot the
students charged receive suspensions beginning this fall — four for
two quarters, one for one quarter and one tor three quarters. In late July, 1
Lyman agreed that one student should receive a three-quarter suspen
sion but then decided that four should receive only a one-quarter
suspension — and the sixth should receive an 80-hour work/fine pen
alty.
The SJC, and its predecessor (the Campus Judicial Panel — CJP), have
had a stormy history. Lyman's decision in the Delt matter, however, can
only create more controversy over the campus judicial system.
All six students were athletes; five were on the varsity football team
a'nd one was a varsity basketball player. After the SJC recommendation
had been forwarded to Lyman, football coach Jack Christiansen asked
to see Lyman in regard to the SJC decision.
Lyman stated in his decision that "student-athletes must not gain
special privileges or dispensation not available to student non-athletes.
1 believe that student-athletes should be treated exactly like other
students." '
However, whatever Christiansen told Lyman was not giventotheSJC
When it was hearing the case, and the fact that Lyman did reduce five of
the sentences after the meeting can only cast doubt on the university's
methods of administering justice.
. The five reduced sentences seem inconsistent considering that the
reist of the Delts — many of whom were not involved in the activities at
issue — were denied the right to live in their house tor three years, a
very harsh sentence.
The worst aspect of Lyman's decision, however, is that he has made a
mockery and a sham out of the campus judicial system. It's no secret
that we are not great admirers of the SJC, but at least in this case its
duly-appointed student and faculty members made a thorough investi
gation and issued an intelligent decision with reasonable sentences.
Lyman's reduction of sentences could be acceptable ifhe had given a
rationale for.his action, but unfortunately no reasons were given.
Lyman pointed out that in nine instances "a student convicted of a
breach of student disciplinary regulation and sentenced to a quarter's
suspension has been given his/her choice of the quarter in which the
suspension would be applied."
In fact, the nine cases Lyman mentioned were all Honor Code viola
lions which had been heard by Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
and had never come to the SJC. Hence, this should be a precedent
setting case. #
Lyman's rationale is crucial. Releasing it could not harm the defen
dants — their names, actions and punishments are public. Concealing
the reason for overturning the SJC can only harm the credibility of the
judicial system here.
Lyman has said that "honest minds" could clash "as to the severity
and dimensions of the penalties necessary." A comparison of penalties
assessed for similar previous cases and Lyman's public estimation ot
why certain penalties would be appropriate in this case would ease a
lot of minds.
Instead, we are left with an apparently arbitrary and capricious
decision which will set a precedent for no one.
Lyman also stated that the policy of allowing students to choose the
quarter of suspension would not apply when the "offenses are so
threatening to the community that they ought to involve immediate or
protracted separation from the university."
Property damage and assault are, in our opinion, definitely threaten
ing to the community. On the other hand, Lyman has considered
peaceful sit-ins or disrupted placement center interviews as "threaten
ing to the community." He is displaying some rather distorted values.
Regardless of rhe merits of the SJC in regard to violations of the Honor
Code, Lyman has demonstrated that the SJC is not an appropriate body
for dealing with students who violate the criminal code. Thus, the
university should amend the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 to
allow the SJC' to hear cases only involving academic conduct viola
tions.
All other violations — such as the activities in question here —
should be turned over to the district attorney's office to be handled in
the state courts. The university should get out of its 19th-century role of
adjudicating non-academic conduct.
