# Woe to the Wasp and blue eyes

The personnel director straightened
the framed human rights code of his
company that hung on the office wall.
He cleared his throat, raised his right
hand and began reciting.
"Equal Opportunity Engineering
Systems, Inc. solemnly swears never to
discriminate in employment on the
basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex,
age, disability, sexual preference, mar
ital status, eye color, baldness,
polydactylism or ear wax, so help us
God. amen, er, aperson."
With these words, the personnel
director sat down at his desk and
picked up a stack of resumes. "Today."
he thought, "this company has an
equal opportunity code forbidding us
from discriminating while hiring. We
are to be 'color-blind and sex-blind.'
But it hasn't always been that way.
Not that long ago, this company would
say to those looking for work, 'We will
hire you because of your skin color or
sex, and we won't hire you because of
your skin color or sex.' That was dis
crimination. That was bad.
"Today, we are enlightened in our
thinking. We say, 'we will hire you
because of our skin color or sex, and
we won't hire you because of your.skin
color or sex.' That's not discrimina
tion, but good, progressive, affirmative
action.
"It's amazing how far we've come
in such a short time."
Enter the Wasp
The personnel director opened his
office door and called in the first
applicant. He was a tall, blond, sun
tanned male, dressed in a white
three-piece suit. He outstretched a
muscular hand to the personnel direc
tor and beamed a gleaming white
smile. "Hello," he said, "my name is
Wayne Wasp."
YVayne sat down. "As you can see
from my resume, I've studied en
gineering all my life. 1 worked for the
Army Corp of Engineers and before
that, I went to school at MIT and Gal
Tech. I don't know why, but it has been
very difficult for me to get a job even

with my qualifications."
The personnel director looked up in
astonishment at Wayne's remark.
"Qualifications? Well. I'm sorry, but
you're not qualified at all. Look, you're
white, you're male, you're young,
you're 'straight,' you're not handicap
ped, you're right-handed and you have
blue eyes. You are obviously to
tally unfit for employment anywhere."
Famines in India
Wayne stammered back, "But I
ended famine in India by building
cobra rendering plants; I irrigated the
Sahara desert and converted it to a
pomegranate plantation and vacation
paradise. I even built extra parking lots
at Stanford. Aren't those qualifica
tions?"
The personnel director shook his
head. "Those things don't count any
more. Today employers use hiring to
compensate for the evils of discrimina
tion. When the oppressed catch up in
employment, you'll be able to get a
job."
"And who will decide when the
'oppressed' have caught up?"
"The same ones who decided that
skin pigment is a good measure of
bridge-building ability. Good day Mr.
Wasp."
Wasp shuffled out of the office, a de
jected man. He was followed by an
applicant who was black, a woman
and a limper. "Come in, come in," said
the personnel director, his face wide
and smiling. "I'm very glad you
applied.here for a job. 1 think we'll be
able to help you.
"First. I'd like to ask you about your
qualifications."
She deftly whipped a briefcase onto
her lap and snapped it open, pulling
out a copy of her resume.
"As you can see," she said, "before I
taught engineering at UCLA and Pur
due. I received my Ph.D fromâ€”"
"No, no, you don't understand. I want
to know your qualifications. Just from
looking at you, I'd say you area minor
ity. a woman, left-handed, and you
limp. With those qualifications you

could be president of the firm in no
time."
The applicant shifted in her chair, a
bit perplexed. "I don't understand
what all that has to do with engineer
ing. And besides, I'm not exactly
black; I'm half-black. My father was
black and my mother was white."
Part time
"Oh well," he said, "maybe we can
give you a part time job. But let's con
tinue with your qualifications. You're
a woman, half-black, handicapped,
unmarried. . Suddenly the direc
tor's face blanched white, "you have,
(gulpl blue eyes??!?"
"Yes, they're from my mother," she

replied meekly.
He shook his head and sighed. "I
don't know if we have any more open
ings for mulatto unmarried heterosex
ual left-handed handicapped blue
eyed woman engineers. I'm sorry, but 1
don't think we can give you a job."
The young woman closed her brief
case and trudged toward the door.
"Wait, 1 just remembered that there
is an opening for someone with your
qualifications in another department.
The job isn't as glamorous as civil en
gineering, but at least it's a job. Liut
first 1 must ask you, can you type?"
