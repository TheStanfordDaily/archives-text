Bonn, West Germany — Social
Democratic Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt survived sizeable losses to
the conservatives and led his coalition
government to a narrow victory in the
West German parliamentary election
yesterday.
Final returns showed that Schmidt's
coalition of Social Democrats and Free
Democrats squeaked by with its major
ity in the lower house of parliament,
the Bundestag, sharply reduced from
45 seats to eight seats.
Helmut Kohl, Schmidt's conserva
tive challenger, refused to concede de
feat. Kohl contended that because his
Christian Democratic Party had made
the strongest gains it was entitled to
form the new government even though
it fell short of an absolute majority.
A heavy turnout of 91 per cent of
West Germany's 41.9 million eligible
voters participated in the balloting,
which came two weeks after Sweden's
40-year-old Social Democratic gov
ernment was voted out of office. Kohl
had urged voters to "follow the
Swedish example."
The coalition government's paper
thin victory hinged on a renewed
pledge by the small Free Democratic
party to stick with Schmidt's Social
Democrats until 1980. Foreign Minis
ter Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the Free
Democratic party chief, immediately
brushed aside an overture from Kohl to
form a coalition with the conserva
tives.
"Herr Kohl has missed his goal,"
Schmidt declared. "He will not be
come federal chancellor."
In claiming victory, Schmidt dis
closed over nationwide television that
he had received a congratulatory tele
phone call from President Gerald Ford,
even before the final results were an
nounced.
"The President of the United States
has just congratulated us on this and
expressed the opinion that we de
served it,"the smiling Schmidt told
his countrymen.
