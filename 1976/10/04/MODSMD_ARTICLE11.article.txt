# Xerox machines and their friends
## 
### Kathryn Ma 
I walk up the wide staircase in
Meyer to scuttle into the glass photo
copy booth. OUT OF ORDER. 1 read the
sign twice and punch the buttons inef
fectively, grumbling to no one in par
ticular. Can't Xerox make machines
that work?
So I run down the stairs and intothe
basement stacks, hunting down the
rows of bound Glamour and Farmers'
Almanac for the elusive Xerox
machine.Overthere.inthecorner. OUT
OF ORDER. Even in the stacks? Who
ever comes down here?
Across the parking lot in Main Lib
rary, the photocopy room is freezing
cold, air-conditioned on a rainy night.
1 have a sheaf of papers in my
backpack. (I'm going to filch last year's
ASSU copyrighted lecture notes with a
furtive look and 35 nickels).
Flashing lights
One man stands in front of the
machine, fumbling with a thick vol
ume, trying to lay the rubber sheet over
the book's stout spine. He punches,
neglecting to put a nickel in the slot.
Xerox sends its rollers into action,
lights flash, and a copy softly slides
into the tray.
"It seems to be running free of
charge tonight." he says to me with a

smile.
"Oh really?"
"Yes, it's quite amusing. You have
only to hold this button down for as
many copies as you want." He makes
seven copies of the table of contents,
chuckling gleefully.
"I only meant to copy six pages, but
with this bit of luck ..." He waves a
pile of paper at me. He has copied the
entire book.

Revenge
It is my turn to take revenge on big
business, on capitalism, on Xerox
multi-millionaires. I step up to the
humming box. A man is clearing his
throat, loudly, emphatically behind
me. I get the point and step back.
"1 have quite a lot to do. Please, you
go first."
He throws me a thank you. I think.

He pulls out a legal pad, carefully
places it on the window and feroci
ously stabs PRINT.
1 watch him copy page after page,
chuckling gleefully with every punch
of the key. He is having such a good
time, I almost hate to do it.
"A-hem."
He starts guiltily. "Uh, yeah. I
didn't mean to do all this, but hell, who
can resist?" He backs out of the room.
This is too much fun, watching
people go berserk. Is this what free en
terprise does to us? Frustrations build,
angers multiply, until one day —
punch! We avenge our hurt pride, our
trampled egos. Foil the Xerox Corpora
tion! Beat them at their own game!
How else are we to even the score?
Shuffling
I settle back into a metal folding
chair, pretending to shuffle through
my papers. Another student walks to
the machine and slaps a GAPSFAS
down on the window.
"Have you got change?"
"Just push that button there. I think
it's running free tonight."
He gives me a doubtful look, but hits
it nevertheless. The green aura lights
his face. His fingers fly to his briefcase.
"Might as well put this machine to
good use," he claims, too loudly.
"The Xerox company can certainly
afford me. Why, they charge outrage
ous prices anyway," he explains to me.
What a rationale! What justification! I
am duly impressed.
People are suddenly flocking into
the room, pushing to form a line. I had
better make my own copies, before the

paper runs out.
I start feeding Xerox, hitting the but
ton defensively, defiantly. Four people
are waiting, inching forward to sur
round me and the machine. They are
delighted; let's do it all together! Xerox
can't get us all at once. There's safety
in numbers!
Retaliation
My hands slide the last page over the
window. One more poke at PRINT.
Grinding halt. Lights flash, hum stops,
nothing comes out.
"What's wrong? What's the matter
here?"
CALL KEY OPERATOR. Blink blink
blink.
"What have you done? Oh shit. Look
at what you did. Damn machine, now
it's jammed."
Never felt so guilty, really guilty be
fore in my life.
I volunteer my own nickel to try to
fix it. Didn't have to; I was finished.
But they were ready to jump me.
The nickel goes down the slot. Xerox
spits out shreds of my last page and
purrs again.
But it's not the same. Gone are the
free throws: it wants money again. 1
gather up my papers. Should 1
apologize? Hell, no. Xerox Corpora
tion would probably thank me for
righting the wrong.
The others are still pounding on the
window. Cheaters cheated out of
cheating the cheaters. Small time stufl,
but it sure helps.

many copies as you want." He makes
seven copies of the table of contents,
chuckling gleefully.
"I only meant to copy six pages, but
with this bit of luck ..." He waves a
pile of paper at me. He has copied the
entire book.

Revenge
It is my turn to take revenge on big
business, on capitalism, on Xerox
multi-millionaires. I step up to the
humming box. A man is clearing his
throat, loudly, emphatically behind
me. I get the point and step back.
"1 have quite a lot to do. Please, you
go first."
He throws me a thank you. I think.

He pulls out a legal pad, carefully
places it on the window and feroci
ously stabs PRINT.
1 watch him copy page after page,
chuckling gleefully with every punch
of the key. He is having such a good
time, I almost hate to do it.
"A-hem."
He starts guiltily. "Uh, yeah. I
didn't mean to do all this, but hell, who
can resist?" He backs out of the room.
This is too much fun, watching
people go berserk. Is this what free en
terprise does to us? Frustrations build,
angers multiply, until one day —
punch! We avenge our hurt pride, our
trampled egos. Foil the Xerox Corpora
tion! Beat them at their own game!
How else are we to even the score?
Shuffling
I settle back into a metal folding
chair, pretending to shuffle through
my papers. Another student walks to
the machine and slaps a GAPSFAS
down on the window.
"Have you got change?"
"Just push that button there. I think
it's running free tonight."
He gives me a doubtful look, but hits
it nevertheless. The green aura lights
his face. His fingers fly to his briefcase.
"Might as well put this machine to
good use," he claims, too loudly.
"The Xerox company can certainly
afford me. Why, they charge outrage
ous prices anyway," he explains to me.
What a rationale! What justification! I
am duly impressed.
People are suddenly flocking into
the room, pushing to form a line. I had
better make my own copies, before the

paper runs out.
I start feeding Xerox, hitting the but
ton defensively, defiantly. Four people
are waiting, inching forward to sur
round me and the machine. They are
delighted; let's do it all together! Xerox
can't get us all at once. There's safety
in numbers!
Retaliation
My hands slide the last page over the
window. One more poke at PRINT.
Grinding halt. Lights flash, hum stops,
nothing comes out.
"What's wrong? What's the matter
here?"
CALL KEY OPERATOR. Blink blink
blink.
"What have you done? Oh shit. Look
at what you did. Damn machine, now
it's jammed."
Never felt so guilty, really guilty be
fore in my life.
I volunteer my own nickel to try to
fix it. Didn't have to; I was finished.
But they were ready to jump me.
The nickel goes down the slot. Xerox
spits out shreds of my last page and
purrs again.
But it's not the same. Gone are the
free throws: it wants money again. 1
gather up my papers. Should 1
apologize? Hell, no. Xerox Corpora
tion would probably thank me for
righting the wrong.
The others are still pounding on the
window. Cheaters cheated out of
cheating the cheaters. Small time stufl,
but it sure helps.

I walk up the wide staircase in
Meyer to scuttle into the glass photo
copy booth. OUT OF ORDER. 1 read the
sign twice and punch the buttons inef
fectively, grumbling to no one in par
ticular. Can't Xerox make machines
that work?
So I run down the stairs and intothe
basement stacks, hunting down the
rows of bound Glamour and Farmers'
Almanac for the elusive Xerox
machine.Overthere.inthecorner. OUT
OF ORDER. Even in the stacks? Who
ever comes down here?
Across the parking lot in Main Lib
rary, the photocopy room is freezing
cold, air-conditioned on a rainy night.
1 have a sheaf of papers in my
backpack. (I'm going to filch last year's
ASSU copyrighted lecture notes with a
furtive look and 35 nickels).
Flashing lights
One man stands in front of the
machine, fumbling with a thick vol
ume, trying to lay the rubber sheet over
the book's stout spine. He punches,
neglecting to put a nickel in the slot.
Xerox sends its rollers into action,
lights flash, and a copy softly slides
into the tray.
"It seems to be running free of
charge tonight." he says to me with a

smile.
"Oh really?"
"Yes, it's quite amusing. You have
only to hold this button down for as
many copies as you want." He makes

tion! Beat them at their own game!
How else are we to even the score?
Shuffling
I settle back into a metal folding
chair, pretending to shuffle through
my papers. Another student walks to
the machine and slaps a GAPSFAS
down on the window.
"Have you got change?"
"Just push that button there. I think
it's running free tonight."
He gives me a doubtful look, but hits
it nevertheless. The green aura lights
his face. His fingers fly to his briefcase.
"Might as well put this machine to
good use," he claims, too loudly.
"The Xerox company can certainly
afford me. Why, they charge outrage
ous prices anyway," he explains to me.
What a rationale! What justification! I
am duly impressed.
People are suddenly flocking into
the room, pushing to form a line. I had
better make my own copies, before the

paper runs out.
I start feeding Xerox, hitting the but
ton defensively, defiantly. Four people
are waiting, inching forward to sur
round me and the machine. They are
delighted; let's do it all together! Xerox
can't get us all at once. There's safety
in numbers!
Retaliation
My hands slide the last page over the
window. One more poke at PRINT.
Grinding halt. Lights flash, hum stops,
nothing comes out.
"What's wrong? What's the matter
here?"
CALL KEY OPERATOR. Blink blink
blink.
"What have you done? Oh shit. Look
at what you did. Damn machine, now
it's jammed."
Never felt so guilty, really guilty be
fore in my life.
I volunteer my own nickel to try to
fix it. Didn't have to; I was finished.
But they were ready to jump me.
The nickel goes down the slot. Xerox
spits out shreds of my last page and
purrs again.
But it's not the same. Gone are the
free throws: it wants money again. 1
gather up my papers. Should 1
apologize? Hell, no. Xerox Corpora
tion would probably thank me for
righting the wrong.
The others are still pounding on the
window. Cheaters cheated out of
cheating the cheaters. Small time stufl,
but it sure helps.

I walk up the wide staircase in
Meyer to scuttle into the glass photo
copy booth. OUT OF ORDER. 1 read the
sign twice and punch the buttons inef
fectively, grumbling to no one in par
ticular. Can't Xerox make machines
that work?
So I run down the stairs and intothe
basement stacks, hunting down the
rows of bound Glamour and Farmers'
Almanac for the elusive Xerox
machine.Overthere.inthecorner. OUT
OF ORDER. Even in the stacks? Who
ever comes down here?
Across the parking lot in Main Lib
rary, the photocopy room is freezing
cold, air-conditioned on a rainy night.
1 have a sheaf of papers in my
backpack. (I'm going to filch last year's
ASSU copyrighted lecture notes with a
furtive look and 35 nickels).
Flashing lights
One man stands in front of the
machine, fumbling with a thick vol
ume, trying to lay the rubber sheet over
the book's stout spine. He punches,
neglecting to put a nickel in the slot.
Xerox sends its rollers into action,
lights flash, and a copy softly slides
into the tray.
"It seems to be running free of
charge tonight." he says to me with a

smile.
"Oh really?"
"Yes, it's quite amusing. You have
only to hold this button down for as
many copies as you want." He makes
seven copies of the table of contents,
chuckling gleefully.
"I only meant to copy six pages, but
with this bit of luck ..." He waves a
pile of paper at me. He has copied the
entire book.

Revenge
It is my turn to take revenge on big
business, on capitalism, on Xerox
multi-millionaires. I step up to the
humming box. A man is clearing his
throat, loudly, emphatically behind
me. I get the point and step back.
"1 have quite a lot to do. Please, you
go first."
He throws me a thank you. I think.

He pulls out a legal pad, carefully
places it on the window and feroci
ously stabs PRINT.
1 watch him copy page after page,
chuckling gleefully with every punch
of the key. He is having such a good
time, I almost hate to do it.
"A-hem."
He starts guiltily. "Uh, yeah. I
didn't mean to do all this, but hell, who
can resist?" He backs out of the room.
This is too much fun, watching
people go berserk. Is this what free en
terprise does to us? Frustrations build,
angers multiply, until one day —
punch! We avenge our hurt pride, our
trampled egos. Foil the Xerox Corpora
tion! Beat them at their own game!
