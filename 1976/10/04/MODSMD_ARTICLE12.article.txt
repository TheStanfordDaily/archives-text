Liberal education
Its occured to me that the principle
criteria for a good liberal education is
whether a student can use the data that
has allready been gathered to better
form a liason with the world outside
the classroom. Someone that seperates
their academic knowledge and
their true to life experience has been
lead astray, and cannot distinguish
between fact, fancy and falsehood.
None of these people have a true
committment to recieving a decent
education and I can only hope they are
the kind of individuals who Stanford
University will neither accomodate or
have anything to do with.

P.S. I will present a crisp dollar bill
to the first Stanford undergraduate
who correctly identifies all the spel

ling and grammatical errors in the
above statement. These happen to be
the most consistently repeated mis
takes in the student papers it has been
my privilege to grade in recent years.
On the rails
Last weekend, I wanted to go into
"the City" with a couple of my new
California friends. None of us having
cars, I decided that we'd go by train.
Not so simple. My God, you
wouldn't believe all the excuses why
we shouldn't take the train! Appa
rently all of the car-born kids were suf
fering from a fear of the unknown.
Finally, I took the train by myself
and enjoyed the ride on those futuris
tic double-deckers.
Fifty minutes later, I was in San
Francisco â€” in the middle of nowhere!
