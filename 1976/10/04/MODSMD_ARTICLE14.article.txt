# Interdepartmental VTS offers honors program
## 
### Shur Reese 
Values, Technology and Soc
iety (VTS), the little-recognized
interdepartmental program de
signed to give students a general
outlook on the interrelations be
tween humanities, science and
society, has been extended this
year to include an honors prog
ram.
The VTS program is not in it
self a major field, thus the honors
program is intended to run
parallel with any regular major.
Qualifying students will be
awarded a degree in the major
field and honors in Values,
Technology and Society.
"Our program," according to
departmental chairman Nathan
Rosenberg, "is designed to give a
broad perspective in modern
society and institutions of the
close relationship between and
over academic boundary lines.
Many critical problems in soci
ety do not fall conveniently in
academic categories and this is a
common concern to all of us."
Five requirements are listed
for the Honors Program:
—three courses from basic
"foundation courses;
—one Resource and
Methodology Course (compar
ing the various methodologies);
—two advanced VTS courses;
—a critical essay or investiga
tive project on a VTS topic of
general importance. The inves
tigative topic must be approved
by the departments Administra
tive Committee; and
—to receive Honors recogni
tion, all required courses must
he finished with an A or B grade.
A description of the student's in
tended honors project must be
submitted for approval during
the Spring quarter of the junior
year.
Innovative program
The innovative VTS program,
originally created in 1971-72,
now has a total of eight courses
and 200 students per year. Simi
lar programs have appeared in
colleges throughout the nation.
A Cornell study indicated that as
of August 1975,185 schools had
courses concerned with the

"ethical and human value im
plications of science and
technology."
One of the main appeals of the
VTS program lies with the fact
that in an era of specialized edu
cation, it attempts to form a
modern approach to general
education of undergraduates.
Rosenberg and the rest of the fa
culty stress that the program is
not set up to affect a student's
career choice so much as his
view of the important decisions
that will have to be made should
he continue on into a specialized
field.
According to the original
proposal for the program, gen
eral education should be en
hanced "for general education
has been the desirability of di
recting the student's attention
beyond the scope of the field of
his special interest." Only with
this type of study program, the
proposal concluded, can the
student hope "to acquire an
awareness of the nature and
limits of his discipline's subject
matter, concerns and methodol
ogy, as well as a valuable
perspective on the cultural
milieu within which his studies
and prospective profession are
carried out."
It is typical that suspicion has
risen over the level of difficulty
in the new interdepartme.nt
program. According to aeronaut
ical engineering and VTS Prof.
Walter Vincenti, such concerns
were rampant during its initial
couple of years, but have since
dissipated.
'Not a discipline'
"This program is not a discip
line," he pointed out, "not a
well-defined body of know
ledge, so we have deliberately
tried to have our courses at least
as difficult as other courses. We
have tried to lean over back
wards not to be too easy."
"In this field there are no neat
packaged solutions to specific
problems," Rosenberg added,
In many ways the program is a
success — the Honors extension
an obvious example. Already
seven or eight students have

written interdepartmental
majors around the VTS concept
which helped to provide
momentum for advancing the
honors program.
Nancy Stockholm, a graduate
who took several VTS courses as
part of her interdepartmental
major in Environmental Studies
remarked that, "For a person
who is pre-med and who doesn't
have a chance to think about the
problems concerning technol
ogy and his profession, VTS
makes you think of how the
whole picture — moral, cultural,
social, political— fits together."
Both Rosenberg and Vincenti
concurred with her that the new
Honors Program will "provide
professionals (particularly those
in business, government, law or
medicine) technical considera
tions in basic human values."

Innovative program
The innovative VTS program,
originally created in 1971-72,
now has a total of eight courses
and 200 students per year. Simi
lar programs have appeared in
colleges throughout the nation.
A Cornell study indicated that as
of August 1975,185 schools had
courses concerned with the

"ethical and human value im
plications of science and
technology."
One of the main appeals of the
VTS program lies with the fact
that in an era of specialized edu
cation, it attempts to form a
modern approach to general
education of undergraduates.
Rosenberg and the rest of the fa
culty stress that the program is
not set up to affect a student's
career choice so much as his
view of the important decisions
that will have to be made should
he continue on into a specialized
field.
According to the original
proposal for the program, gen
eral education should be en
hanced "for general education
has been the desirability of di
recting the student's attention
beyond the scope of the field of
his special interest." Only with
this type of study program, the
proposal concluded, can the
student hope "to acquire an
awareness of the nature and
limits of his discipline's subject
matter, concerns and methodol
ogy, as well as a valuable
perspective on the cultural
milieu within which his studies
and prospective profession are
carried out."
It is typical that suspicion has
risen over the level of difficulty
in the new interdepartme.nt
program. According to aeronaut
ical engineering and VTS Prof.
Walter Vincenti, such concerns
were rampant during its initial
couple of years, but have since
dissipated.
'Not a discipline'
"This program is not a discip
line," he pointed out, "not a
well-defined body of know
ledge, so we have deliberately
tried to have our courses at least
as difficult as other courses. We
have tried to lean over back
wards not to be too easy."
"In this field there are no neat
packaged solutions to specific
problems," Rosenberg added,
In many ways the program is a
success — the Honors extension
an obvious example. Already
seven or eight students have

written interdepartmental
majors around the VTS concept
which helped to provide
momentum for advancing the
honors program.
Nancy Stockholm, a graduate
who took several VTS courses as
part of her interdepartmental
major in Environmental Studies
remarked that, "For a person
who is pre-med and who doesn't
have a chance to think about the
problems concerning technol
ogy and his profession, VTS
makes you think of how the
whole picture — moral, cultural,
social, political— fits together."
Both Rosenberg and Vincenti
concurred with her that the new
Honors Program will "provide
professionals (particularly those
in business, government, law or
medicine) technical considera
tions in basic human values."
Values, Technology and Soc
iety (VTS), the little-recognized
interdepartmental program de
signed to give students a general
outlook on the interrelations be
tween humanities, science and
society, has been extended this
year to include an honors prog
ram.
The VTS program is not in it
self a major field, thus the honors
program is intended to run
parallel with any regular major.
Qualifying students will be
awarded a degree in the major
field and honors in Values,
Technology and Society.
"Our program," according to
departmental chairman Nathan
Rosenberg, "is designed to give a
broad perspective in modern
society and institutions of the
close relationship between and
over academic boundary lines.
Many critical problems in soci
ety do not fall conveniently in
academic categories and this is a
common concern to all of us."
Five requirements are listed
for the Honors Program:
—three courses from basic
"foundation courses;
—one Resource and
Methodology Course (compar
ing the various methodologies);
—two advanced VTS courses;
—a critical essay or investiga
tive project on a VTS topic of
general importance. The inves

modern approach to general
education of undergraduates.
Rosenberg and the rest of the fa
culty stress that the program is
not set up to affect a student's
career choice so much as his
view of the important decisions
that will have to be made should
he continue on into a specialized
field.
According to the original
proposal for the program, gen
eral education should be en
hanced "for general education
has been the desirability of di
recting the student's attention
beyond the scope of the field of
his special interest." Only with
this type of study program, the
proposal concluded, can the
student hope "to acquire an
awareness of the nature and
limits of his discipline's subject
matter, concerns and methodol
ogy, as well as a valuable
perspective on the cultural
milieu within which his studies
and prospective profession are
carried out."
It is typical that suspicion has
risen over the level of difficulty
in the new interdepartme.nt
program. According to aeronaut
ical engineering and VTS Prof.
Walter Vincenti, such concerns
were rampant during its initial
couple of years, but have since
dissipated.
'Not a discipline'
"This program is not a discip
line," he pointed out, "not a
well-defined body of know
ledge, so we have deliberately
tried to have our courses at least
as difficult as other courses. We
have tried to lean over back
wards not to be too easy."
"In this field there are no neat
packaged solutions to specific
problems," Rosenberg added,
In many ways the program is a
success — the Honors extension
an obvious example. Already
seven or eight students have

written interdepartmental
majors around the VTS concept
which helped to provide
momentum for advancing the
honors program.
Nancy Stockholm, a graduate
who took several VTS courses as
part of her interdepartmental
major in Environmental Studies
remarked that, "For a person
who is pre-med and who doesn't
have a chance to think about the
problems concerning technol
ogy and his profession, VTS
makes you think of how the
whole picture — moral, cultural,
social, political— fits together."
Both Rosenberg and Vincenti
concurred with her that the new
Honors Program will "provide
professionals (particularly those
in business, government, law or
medicine) technical considera
tions in basic human values."
