# 'Women need each other for relief from depression'
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Women have not generally been able to find the
emotional support they need from men and
should therefore seek it where it was once histori
cally available to them — from the community of
women, according to sociologist Jessie Bernard,
emerita professor at Pennsylvania State Univer
sity.
Speaking at noon Friday at Bishop Auditorium
to a capacity crowd of 370 in the first of a series of
lectures on "The Family in Flux," Bernard de
scribed and analyzed the causes of "Female De
pression" and suggested possible ways to al
leviate the condition.
The audience, 85 per cent of whom were wo
men, interrupted her frequently with positive
laughter and applause and made remarks like
"This lady is a trip" and"I haven't had such a
good time in weeks." The Center for Research on
Women (CROW) sponsored the speech.
Bernard stated that a principal source of female
depression is the institution of marriage, which
loads women down with stress from having to
perform according to stereotyped female roles,
such as learned helplessness, compulsory house
keeping, demands of parenthood and economic
subservience.
She quoted as a summary and reiteration of this
thesis a remark made by the television character

Mary Hartman on April 28, 1976, shortly before
her fictional nervous breakdown, that "All hap
pily married women are unhappy."
Bernard said the bulwark against female depre
ssion formerly provided by female solidarity dur
ing the 19th century has vanished, leaving
women to "turn to men for support, and the men
have been a very serious flop."
The sociologist, who is the author of The Future
of Marriage, Academic Women, The Sex Game
and Women and the Public Interest, remarked,
"Men have not been reared or trained to offer
emotional support to others. Women, who have
been, and who do supply emotional support for
men, will have to supply it for themselves."
Bernard pointed out that with "the denigration
of female homosociality and the upgrading of
heterosociality currently, it is widely believed
that women can not be friends with women be
cause they constantly compete against each other
for men and status.
"As sources of emotional support," she said,
"men have proven to be weak reeds to lean on."
Often, said Bernard, men respond to women's
cries for emotional support with "rejection, dis
missal, or passive listening," and tend to become
more hyper-rational the more emotional the
woman becomes.

subservience.
She quoted as a summary and reiteration of this
thesis a remark made by the television character

Mary Hartman on April 28, 1976, shortly before
her fictional nervous breakdown, that "All hap
pily married women are unhappy."
Bernard said the bulwark against female depre
ssion formerly provided by female solidarity dur
ing the 19th century has vanished, leaving
women to "turn to men for support, and the men
have been a very serious flop."
The sociologist, who is the author of The Future
of Marriage, Academic Women, The Sex Game
and Women and the Public Interest, remarked,
"Men have not been reared or trained to offer
emotional support to others. Women, who have
been, and who do supply emotional support for
men, will have to supply it for themselves."
Bernard pointed out that with "the denigration
of female homosociality and the upgrading of
heterosociality currently, it is widely believed
that women can not be friends with women be
cause they constantly compete against each other
for men and status.
"As sources of emotional support," she said,
"men have proven to be weak reeds to lean on."
Often, said Bernard, men respond to women's
cries for emotional support with "rejection, dis
missal, or passive listening," and tend to become
more hyper-rational the more emotional the
woman becomes.
Women have not generally been able to find the
emotional support they need from men and
should therefore seek it where it was once histori
cally available to them — from the community of
women, according to sociologist Jessie Bernard,
emerita professor at Pennsylvania State Univer
sity.
Speaking at noon Friday at Bishop Auditorium
to a capacity crowd of 370 in the first of a series of
lectures on "The Family in Flux," Bernard de
scribed and analyzed the causes of "Female De
pression" and suggested possible ways to al
leviate the condition.
The audience, 85 per cent of whom were wo
men, interrupted her frequently with positive
laughter and applause and made remarks like
"This lady is a trip" and"I haven't had such a
good time in weeks." The Center for Research on
Women (CROW) sponsored the speech.
Bernard stated that a principal source of female
depression is the institution of marriage, which
loads women down with stress from having to
perform according to stereotyped female roles,
such as learned helplessness, compulsory house
keeping, demands of parenthood and economic
subservience.
