# Butz in trouble for remarks

From the Associated Press
The furor raised by Earl Butz's
remarks about blacks isn't the
first time his comments have
gotten the secretary of agricul
ture in trouble.
The 67-year-old Butz became
head of the Agriculture Depart
ment in 1971, and has earned a
certain amount of attention for
his cracks on a variety of topics.
Although he likes to tell

slightly vulgar stories, few have
had the public impact of the one
causing the current flap: "I'll tell
you why you (the Republicans)
can't attract coloreds. Because
colored only want three things.
You know what they want? I'll
tell you what coloreds want. It's
three things: first, a tight pussy;
second, loose shoes, and third, a
warm place to shit. That's all!"
At least once before, Butz has

been ordered by President
Gerald Ford to apologize for his
comments. That came in
November 1974, after he made a
remark mocking Pope Paul Vl's
position on birth control: "He no
playa da game, he no maka da
rules."
Butz had attempted to explain
that, but Ford found the explana
tion inadequate, summoned
Butz to the Oval Office, and or
dered an apology "to any and all
individuals who may have been
offended."
Other sample of Butz's humOr
include:
—The story of the Southern
Baptist preacher who bought a
used car, then discovered he
didn't have the vocabulary to
operate it.
—The story of the merry
widow who was the talk of her
church congregation. After one
Sunday sermon the minister
said, "I'm glad to see you here; I
prayed for you all night." She
replied, "Why didn't you call?
I'd have been there in 10 mi
nutes."
In addition to being a self
styled comic, Butz is a well
schooled agriculture expert.
A native of Lafayette, Ind., he
is a graduate of Purdue Univer
sity where he received a Ph.D.
degree. He served as a research
fellow at the Brookings Institu
tion in Washington in 1944-45,
was a professor of agriculture at
Purdue and was assistant secret
ary of agriculture under Presi
dent Dwight Eisenhower.
After leaving the Agriculture
Department in 1957, Butz be
came dean of agriculture at Pur
due, serving there until chosen
as agriculture secretary by Pres

ident Nixon in 1971.
Butz's tenure has figured in
variety of controversies over the
past few years, centering on op
eration of the food stamp prog
ram, grain sales to the Soviet
Union and rising food prices,
particularly for meat.
Butz was caught in the middle
in the battle over foreign grain
sales, but managed to work out
five-year agreements with Po
land and the Soviet Union to
stabilize the flow of grain to
those countries.
Large sales to Russia had led to
a jump in bread prices, bringing
on the wrath of labor and con
sumers and leading to an em
bargo on such sales.
But the embargo didn't please
farmers, who wanted the over
seas sales to help keep prices up.
When the embargo was lifted
and more sales followed,
longshoremen refused to load
grain on ships bound for the
Soviet Union until the long-term
agreement was finally worked
out.
