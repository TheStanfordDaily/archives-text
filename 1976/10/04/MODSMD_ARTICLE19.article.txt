La Paz, Mexico (AP) —Rescue
supplies poured into Baja
California yesterday, where
workers pulled hundreds of
bodies from the muck and debris
left by Hurricane Liza. Official
figures and estimates of the
number of bodies already found
ranged from about 400 to 750,
but hundreds of others were re
ported missing and most sources
agreed the toll has reached
nearly 1000.
Mexican troops immediately
buried the bodies in mass graves
or burned them to avoid
epidemics.
La Paz, the capital of the state
of Baja California Sur, was worst
hit. The city of 85,000 and about
a dozen towns nearby were
without adequate drinking
water and had no electricity or
telephone service.
An estimated 70,000 persons
were left homeless by the hur

ricane. The Mexican govern
ment said it was rushing in
100,000 meals and 40,000 tem
porary housing shelters by boat
and plane.
Neighborhoods were wiped
out by the storm, which carried
winds of up to 135 miles per
hour.
Many of the victims died
when the storm cracked a 30-foot
earth dam. The flood washed
away a crowded shanty town of
thatched-roof wooden and
cardboard shacks.
The Los Angeles Times re
ported some residents were
angry at the government, claim
ing officials had ignored re
quests to shore up the earthen
dam. But officials said many of
those in the shanty-town either
failed to heed or did not hear
evacuation warnings when the
storm approached on Friday.
