# Lyman: Delt house case
## 
### 
(Editor's note: The Stanford
Judiciul Council (SJC) recom
mended to President Richard
Lyman in June that six students
be suspended from the univer
sity for alleged involvement in a
vandalizing case lust spring.
Lyman modified several of the
SJC recommendations; the
edited text of his letter to SJC
Faculty Co-chairman Jonathan
Casper follows.)
July 26, 1976
Dear Professor Casper:
This is in response to the ap
peal lodged with me in the cases
of Gary Anderson, Todd Ander
son, Mark Hill, George Schader,
Richard Waters, and Michael
Wilkinson, by Joseph W. Mell,
Attorney, on July 10, 1976.
First 1 shall describe briefly
the process by which 1 reviewed
the cases.
At defendants' request 1 met
with each of them individually,
and in one case with a defen
dant's parents. In addition to
studying Mr. Mell's argument
and the opinions submitted by
the Stanford Judicial Council on
June 24th, I read in full the ver
batim transcript of the SJC hear
ing. I also studied the history of
penalties in disciplinary cases
since the founding of the SJC in
1969.
Without enumerating each
and every argument made by de
fendants, their attorneys and
friends in favor of reducing the
penalties recommended by the
SJC, I believe that they can be
summarized as bearing for the
most part on the question of the
seriousness of the offences for
which defendants had admitted
responsibility through formal
stipulations. The property dam
age, even taken in toto, resulting
from the actions of the "patrol"
in the Beta House was not great,
and no one claimed to have suf
fered personal injury. Mr. Mell
has gone so far as to declare that.

"With the exception of the acts
of Todd Anderson, the activities
were relatively innocuous."
I cannot agree with that esti
mation. Rather, I find persuasive
the Council's statement that "the
context in which these events
occurred is crucial." That con
duct was not one of a spontane
ous eruption in a dormitory, in
which what starts out as no more
than friendly and mutual
rough-housing develops into
something more serious; in this
case, it involved a physical inva
sion of another dormitory, un
provoked by any action on the
part of the residents thereof, at
approximately 12:30 a.m. The
SJC has accurately described
(pp. 7-8) the dangerousness, the
potential for far more serious
harm than was done that night,
of this kind of proceeding, re
gardless of the extent of pre
planning or initial malicious in
tent Thus the argument that the
actions at the Beta House were
not "premeditated" is not ex
culpatory.
It was clearly the intention of
the SJC to make clear, by the
penalties invoked, the serious
ness of the offences in question.
"We view the behavior of the de
fendants as extremely serious
and completely beyond the
bounds of tolerable behavior in
our community." I accept that
judgment and the purpose thus
implied for the penalties. Honest
minds can, of course, differ as to
the severity and dimensions of
the penalties necessary to
achieve this end.
A review of penalties imposed
in previous cases upon the re
commendation of the SJC does
not yield any clear and unam
biguous direction for the case
under consideration. Contrary to
widely held belief, cases involv
ing violent behavior in the
period of campus disruption
were not without serious penal
ties; convictions for "trashing"

or throwing rocks at University
buildings brought suspensions
varying from one to three
academic quarters. But no event
or sequence of events previously
tried by the SJC yields a parallel
to this case sufficiently close to
be very useful.
Extrapolation from Honor
Code cases, involving cheating
in academic work, is scarcely
possible, although one can at
least conclude that, since the
Council itself has set a one
quarter suspension as the nor
mal penalty for a first offence
under the Honor Code, such a
punishment is intended to be a
serious one.
Notwithstanding the lack of
apposite analogies, I have con
cluded that, with the exception
of Mr. T. Anderson, the penalties
recommended by the SJC as to
the remaining defendants go
somewhat beyond what is re
quired to emphasize the seri
ousness of the offences in ques
tion. . . .
I have taken into account also
the fact that, except for Mr.
Schader and Mr. Todd Ander
son, all the defendants came
forward with stipulations of
specific acts they had commit
ted, without there having been
witnesses among the Beta House
residents who could testify to
those actions. And Mr. Schader
came forward before he could
have known that there was tes
timony available as to his
specific actions.
There is no further point that
must be discussed, even though
it was not raised in Mr. Mell's
formal appeal, because it has
been raised by individual defen
dants and by others on their be
half. It is their prospective in
volvement in intercollegiate ath
letics during much of the period
for which their suspension from
the University has been recom
mended. Four of the defendants
