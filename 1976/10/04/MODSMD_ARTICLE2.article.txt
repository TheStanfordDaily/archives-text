July 26, 1976
Dear Professor Casper:
This is in response to the ap
peal lodged with me in the cases
of Gary Anderson, Todd Ander
son, Mark Hill, George Schader,
Richard Waters, and Michael
Wilkinson, by Joseph W. Mell,
Attorney, on July 10, 1976.
First 1 shall describe briefly
the process by which 1 reviewed
the cases.
At defendants' request 1 met
with each of them individually,
and in one case with a defen
dant's parents. In addition to
studying Mr. Mell's argument
and the opinions submitted by
the Stanford Judicial Council on
June 24th, I read in full the ver
batim transcript of the SJC hear
ing. I also studied the history of
penalties in disciplinary cases
since the founding of the SJC in
1969.
Without enumerating each
and every argument made by de
fendants, their attorneys and
friends in favor of reducing the
penalties recommended by the
SJC, I believe that they can be
summarized as bearing for the
most part on the question of the
seriousness of the offences for
which defendants had admitted
responsibility through formal
stipulations. The property dam
age, even taken in toto, resulting
from the actions of the "patrol"
in the Beta House was not great,
and no one claimed to have suf
fered personal injury. Mr. Mell
has gone so far as to declare that.

"With the exception of the acts
of Todd Anderson, the activities
were relatively innocuous."
I cannot agree with that esti
mation. Rather, I find persuasive
the Council's statement that "the
context in which these events
occurred is crucial." That con
duct was not one of a spontane
ous eruption in a dormitory, in
which what starts out as no more
than friendly and mutual
rough-housing develops into
something more serious; in this
case, it involved a physical inva
sion of another dormitory, un
provoked by any action on the
part of the residents thereof, at
approximately 12:30 a.m. The
SJC has accurately described
(pp. 7-8) the dangerousness, the
potential for far more serious
harm than was done that night,
of this kind of proceeding, re
gardless of the extent of pre
planning or initial malicious in
tent Thus the argument that the
actions at the Beta House were
not "premeditated" is not ex
culpatory.
It was clearly the intention of
the SJC to make clear, by the
penalties invoked, the serious
ness of the offences in question.
"We view the behavior of the de
fendants as extremely serious
and completely beyond the
bounds of tolerable behavior in
our community." I accept that
judgment and the purpose thus
implied for the penalties. Honest
minds can, of course, differ as to
the severity and dimensions of
the penalties necessary to
achieve this end.
A review of penalties imposed
in previous cases upon the re
commendation of the SJC does
not yield any clear and unam
biguous direction for the case
under consideration. Contrary to
widely held belief, cases involv
ing violent behavior in the
period of campus disruption
were not without serious penal
ties; convictions for "trashing"

or throwing rocks at University
buildings brought suspensions
varying from one to three
academic quarters. But no event
or sequence of events previously
tried by the SJC yields a parallel
to this case sufficiently close to
be very useful.
Extrapolation from Honor
Code cases, involving cheating
in academic work, is scarcely
possible, although one can at
least conclude that, since the
Council itself has set a one
quarter suspension as the nor
mal penalty for a first offence
under the Honor Code, such a
punishment is intended to be a
serious one.
Notwithstanding the lack of
apposite analogies, I have con
cluded that, with the exception
of Mr. T. Anderson, the penalties
recommended by the SJC as to
the remaining defendants go
somewhat beyond what is re
quired to emphasize the seri
ousness of the offences in ques
tion. . . .
I have taken into account also
the fact that, except for Mr.
Schader and Mr. Todd Ander
son, all the defendants came
forward with stipulations of
specific acts they had commit
ted, without there having been
witnesses among the Beta House
residents who could testify to
those actions. And Mr. Schader
came forward before he could
have known that there was tes
timony available as to his
specific actions.
There is no further point that
must be discussed, even though
it was not raised in Mr. Mell's
formal appeal, because it has
been raised by individual defen
dants and by others on their be
half. It is their prospective in
volvement in intercollegiate ath
letics during much of the period
for which their suspension from
the University has been recom
mended. Four of the defendants
would normally expect to be
playing varsity football in the
fall quarter, and one would ex
pect to play varsity basketball in
late fall and winter quarters.
One's first thought, of course,
is that student-athletes must not
gain special privilege or dispen
sation not available to student
non-athletes. I believe that, to
the greatest extent possible
under NCAA and Pacific-8 Con
ference regulations, student
athletes should be treated
exactly like other students.
It is the case, however, that in
nine instances over the past two
years, a student convicted of a
breach of student disciplinary
regulations and sentenced to a
quarter's suspension has been
given his/her choice of the quar
ter in which the suspension
would be applied. In the major
ity of such cases, the reason for
allowing such a choice has been
academic: e.g., a student facing
very serious disruption of his I
her program if a specific course
sequence could not be taken

when it was offered. But in four
cases it appears that other con
siderations entered into the mat
ter.
The practice has troublesome
implications, however, if it is
applied selectively and without
general criteria that can be in
voked. I would like here to
suggest that the most effective
way to assure equity, in the sense
of producing penalties that will
mean the same thing to all who
suffer them, will be to allow a
reasonable choice of the period
of suspension (usually exclud
ing summer quarter) for all con
victed offenders except those
whose offences are so threaten
ing to the community that they
ought to involve immediate or
protracted separation from the
University. By a "reasonable
choice" I mean a choice of one
out of the two or at most three
quarters succeeding the convic
tion.
Such a policy assumes that for
any student there will probably
be a more or a less convenient
time, in terms of legitimate Uni

versity activities foregone, to
serve out a suspension. Rather
than attempting to determine in
each case de novo whether the
particular University activity or
activities in question are more or
less deserving of consideration,
one would, by leaving that
judgment to the student, at least
assure that one suspended stu
dent was suffering a penalty
roughly equal to another's.
It should be noted that such a
criterion is not intended to ex
tend to secondary effects of sus
pension, such as delayed entr
ance into post-university
careers, or possible deportation
for foreign students. Our experi
ence, from the time in which it
was argued by some that suspen
sion was "capital punishment"
because it meant exposure to the
risk of being drafted, down to the
present has been that we cannot
possibly become involved in
such consideration of secondary
effects. They are too endlessly
ramifying, to difficult to judge,
and too often they would, if
taken into account, have the ef
fect of excluding whole classes
of students from meaningful
penalties entirely, as would have
been the case had the University
been willing to exempt from
suspension any student who was
subject to selective service.
To recapitulate this final
point: the rationale for allowing
a choice within limits of a period
for suspension rests on the fact
that, where the accomplishment
of significant individual pur
poses within the framework of
Stanford activities, both curricu
lar and extra-curricular, is in
volved it is extremely difficult to
attain equity of treatment. To the
question, "What will we accept
as constituting a significant
purpose in this context?" we can
respond that we shall, within
reasonable limits, leave that to
the student to determine in the
light of his/her own judgment.
I have decided, then, to main
tain the penalty recommended

for Mr. Todd Anderson, for the
reasons emphasized by the SJC:
"Mr. Anderson not only
caused property damage in the
course of his activities, but he
physically attacked a resident of
the Beta House. In the course of
the hearing, Mr. Anderson indi
cated that the reason for the at
tack upon this particular indi
vidual lay in the fact that the vic
tim had, during the past year,
written a letter highly critical of
the activities of the fraternity of
which Mr. Anderson was a
member. Thus, the attack was
not simply a random event, but
rather the victim was selected
because of particular malice on
Mr. Anderson's part. Fortu
nately, the victim did not suffer
any extensive physical injury.
By the same token, the potential
for such injury lay in the nature
of the fact of an attack itself, and
it must have been a highly in
timidating and frightening ex
perience. . . . We find that Mr.
Anderson's actions indicate that
he is not willing at the current
time to be a law-abiding member
of the University community.
We recommend that he be sus
pended from the University
until autumn quarter 1977."
There is no reason to allow
him a choice of quarters, both
because he has but one more
quarter's requirements at Stan
ford and because 1 believe that he
falls in the category of excep
tions noted above, those for
whom immediate or protracted
separation is indicated.
In the cases of Messrs. Gary
Anderson, Mark Hill, George
Schader and Richard Waters,
each is to serve a one-quarter
suspension during the academic
year 1976-77, with the choice of
quarter left to him to make. Each
must make that selection by the
first day of fall quarter, and the
choice, once made, shall be ir
revocable.
Finally, in the case of Mr.
Michael Wilkinson, the further
consideration has been ad

vanced by counsel for the de
fense and accepted by the SJC
that he would not have been pro
secuted at all had he not come
forward with an admission of
guilt; there were no witnesses
even to the fact of his presence at
the Beta House that night. I agree
with the statement in Mr. Boett
ner's concurring opinion:
. . that although Mr. Wilkin
son is no tess guilty than the
other four defendants charged
with similar offenses, nor is his
particular offense any less seri
ous than theirs, his voluntary
confession of participation in
the disturbance when he could
have escaped any punishment
suggests a considerably light
ened penalty. ... A willingness
to admit one's guilt and cooper
ate with the prosecution and the
SJC should be promoted. If the
majority recommendation (of
one quarter's suspension) is ac
cepted in full in his case, such
admissions and cooperation will
not be encouraged; discreet si
lence will."
Given those considerations,
and a very clear impression de
rived from talking with Mr. Wil
kinson that his behavior on the
night of May 19-20 was indeed
aberrational in the extreme for
him, he is to be suspended for
one academic quarter but that
penalty itself is to be suspended;
in its place he shall be required
to perform an 80 hours work fine
during that quarter in which he
would have chosen to serve his
suspension had the latter pen
alty been levied.
I trust that it will be clear from
this case that behavior of the
kind exhibited by the defendants
herein will be met with mean
ingful penalties at Stanford,
whatever may be the alleged
force of "tradition" in its favor.
1 am asking Dean Lyons by
copy of this letter to see to it that
these penalties are put into ef
fect.
Sincerely yours,
/s/Richard W. Lyman

ity of such cases, the reason for
allowing such a choice has been
academic: e.g., a student facing
very serious disruption of his I
her program if a specific course
sequence could not be taken

when it was offered. But in four
cases it appears that other con
siderations entered into the mat
ter.
The practice has troublesome
implications, however, if it is
applied selectively and without
general criteria that can be in
voked. I would like here to
suggest that the most effective
way to assure equity, in the sense
of producing penalties that will
mean the same thing to all who
suffer them, will be to allow a
reasonable choice of the period
of suspension (usually exclud
ing summer quarter) for all con
victed offenders except those
whose offences are so threaten
ing to the community that they
ought to involve immediate or
protracted separation from the
University. By a "reasonable
choice" I mean a choice of one
out of the two or at most three
quarters succeeding the convic
tion.
Such a policy assumes that for
any student there will probably
be a more or a less convenient
time, in terms of legitimate Uni

versity activities foregone, to
serve out a suspension. Rather
than attempting to determine in
each case de novo whether the
particular University activity or
activities in question are more or
less deserving of consideration,
one would, by leaving that
judgment to the student, at least
assure that one suspended stu
dent was suffering a penalty
roughly equal to another's.
It should be noted that such a
criterion is not intended to ex
tend to secondary effects of sus
pension, such as delayed entr
ance into post-university
careers, or possible deportation
for foreign students. Our experi
ence, from the time in which it
was argued by some that suspen
sion was "capital punishment"
because it meant exposure to the
risk of being drafted, down to the
present has been that we cannot
possibly become involved in
such consideration of secondary
effects. They are too endlessly
ramifying, to difficult to judge,
and too often they would, if
taken into account, have the ef
fect of excluding whole classes
of students from meaningful
penalties entirely, as would have
been the case had the University
been willing to exempt from
suspension any student who was
subject to selective service.
To recapitulate this final
point: the rationale for allowing
a choice within limits of a period
for suspension rests on the fact
that, where the accomplishment
of significant individual pur
poses within the framework of
Stanford activities, both curricu
lar and extra-curricular, is in
volved it is extremely difficult to
attain equity of treatment. To the
question, "What will we accept
as constituting a significant
purpose in this context?" we can
respond that we shall, within
reasonable limits, leave that to
the student to determine in the
light of his/her own judgment.
I have decided, then, to main
tain the penalty recommended

for Mr. Todd Anderson, for the
reasons emphasized by the SJC:
"Mr. Anderson not only
caused property damage in the
course of his activities, but he
physically attacked a resident of
the Beta House. In the course of
the hearing, Mr. Anderson indi
cated that the reason for the at
tack upon this particular indi
vidual lay in the fact that the vic
tim had, during the past year,
written a letter highly critical of
the activities of the fraternity of
which Mr. Anderson was a
member. Thus, the attack was
not simply a random event, but
rather the victim was selected
because of particular malice on
Mr. Anderson's part. Fortu
nately, the victim did not suffer
any extensive physical injury.
By the same token, the potential
for such injury lay in the nature
of the fact of an attack itself, and
it must have been a highly in
timidating and frightening ex
perience. . . . We find that Mr.
Anderson's actions indicate that
he is not willing at the current
time to be a law-abiding member
of the University community.
We recommend that he be sus
pended from the University
until autumn quarter 1977."
There is no reason to allow
him a choice of quarters, both
because he has but one more
quarter's requirements at Stan
ford and because 1 believe that he
falls in the category of excep
tions noted above, those for
whom immediate or protracted
separation is indicated.
In the cases of Messrs. Gary
Anderson, Mark Hill, George
Schader and Richard Waters,
each is to serve a one-quarter
suspension during the academic
year 1976-77, with the choice of
quarter left to him to make. Each
must make that selection by the
first day of fall quarter, and the
choice, once made, shall be ir
revocable.
Finally, in the case of Mr.
Michael Wilkinson, the further
consideration has been ad

vanced by counsel for the de
fense and accepted by the SJC
that he would not have been pro
secuted at all had he not come
forward with an admission of
guilt; there were no witnesses
even to the fact of his presence at
the Beta House that night. I agree
with the statement in Mr. Boett
ner's concurring opinion:
. . that although Mr. Wilkin
son is no tess guilty than the
other four defendants charged
with similar offenses, nor is his
particular offense any less seri
ous than theirs, his voluntary
confession of participation in
the disturbance when he could
have escaped any punishment
suggests a considerably light
ened penalty. ... A willingness
to admit one's guilt and cooper
ate with the prosecution and the
SJC should be promoted. If the
majority recommendation (of
one quarter's suspension) is ac
cepted in full in his case, such
admissions and cooperation will
not be encouraged; discreet si
lence will."
Given those considerations,
and a very clear impression de
rived from talking with Mr. Wil
kinson that his behavior on the
night of May 19-20 was indeed
aberrational in the extreme for
him, he is to be suspended for
one academic quarter but that
penalty itself is to be suspended;
in its place he shall be required
to perform an 80 hours work fine
during that quarter in which he
would have chosen to serve his
suspension had the latter pen
alty been levied.
I trust that it will be clear from
this case that behavior of the
kind exhibited by the defendants
herein will be met with mean
ingful penalties at Stanford,
whatever may be the alleged
force of "tradition" in its favor.
1 am asking Dean Lyons by
copy of this letter to see to it that
these penalties are put into ef
fect.
Sincerely yours,

July 26, 1976
Dear Professor Casper:
This is in response to the ap
peal lodged with me in the cases
of Gary Anderson, Todd Ander
son, Mark Hill, George Schader,
Richard Waters, and Michael
Wilkinson, by Joseph W. Mell,
Attorney, on July 10, 1976.
First 1 shall describe briefly
the process by which 1 reviewed
the cases.
At defendants' request 1 met
with each of them individually,
and in one case with a defen
dant's parents. In addition to
studying Mr. Mell's argument
and the opinions submitted by
the Stanford Judicial Council on
June 24th, I read in full the ver
batim transcript of the SJC hear
ing. I also studied the history of
penalties in disciplinary cases
since the founding of the SJC in
1969.
Without enumerating each
and every argument made by de
fendants, their attorneys and
friends in favor of reducing the
penalties recommended by the
SJC, I believe that they can be
summarized as bearing for the
most part on the question of the
seriousness of the offences for
which defendants had admitted
responsibility through formal
stipulations. The property dam
age, even taken in toto, resulting
from the actions of the "patrol"
in the Beta House was not great,
and no one claimed to have suf
fered personal injury. Mr. Mell
has gone so far as to declare that.

"With the exception of the acts
of Todd Anderson, the activities
were relatively innocuous."
I cannot agree with that esti
mation. Rather, I find persuasive
the Council's statement that "the
context in which these events
occurred is crucial." That con
duct was not one of a spontane
ous eruption in a dormitory, in
which what starts out as no more
than friendly and mutual
rough-housing develops into
something more serious; in this
case, it involved a physical inva
sion of another dormitory, un
provoked by any action on the
part of the residents thereof, at
approximately 12:30 a.m. The
SJC has accurately described
(pp. 7-8) the dangerousness, the
potential for far more serious
harm than was done that night,
of this kind of proceeding, re
gardless of the extent of pre
planning or initial malicious in
tent Thus the argument that the
actions at the Beta House were
not "premeditated" is not ex
culpatory.
It was clearly the intention of
the SJC to make clear, by the
penalties invoked, the serious
ness of the offences in question.
"We view the behavior of the de
fendants as extremely serious
and completely beyond the
bounds of tolerable behavior in
our community." I accept that
judgment and the purpose thus
implied for the penalties. Honest
minds can, of course, differ as to
the severity and dimensions of
the penalties necessary to
achieve this end.
A review of penalties imposed
in previous cases upon the re
commendation of the SJC does
not yield any clear and unam
biguous direction for the case
under consideration. Contrary to
widely held belief, cases involv
ing violent behavior in the
period of campus disruption
were not without serious penal
ties; convictions for "trashing"

or throwing rocks at University
buildings brought suspensions
varying from one to three
academic quarters. But no event
or sequence of events previously
tried by the SJC yields a parallel
to this case sufficiently close to
be very useful.
Extrapolation from Honor
Code cases, involving cheating
in academic work, is scarcely
possible, although one can at
least conclude that, since the
Council itself has set a one
quarter suspension as the nor
mal penalty for a first offence
under the Honor Code, such a
punishment is intended to be a
serious one.
Notwithstanding the lack of
apposite analogies, I have con
cluded that, with the exception
of Mr. T. Anderson, the penalties
recommended by the SJC as to
the remaining defendants go
somewhat beyond what is re
quired to emphasize the seri
ousness of the offences in ques
tion. . . .
I have taken into account also
the fact that, except for Mr.
Schader and Mr. Todd Ander
son, all the defendants came
forward with stipulations of
specific acts they had commit
ted, without there having been
witnesses among the Beta House
residents who could testify to
those actions. And Mr. Schader
came forward before he could
have known that there was tes
timony available as to his
specific actions.
There is no further point that
must be discussed, even though
it was not raised in Mr. Mell's
formal appeal, because it has
been raised by individual defen
dants and by others on their be
half. It is their prospective in
volvement in intercollegiate ath
letics during much of the period
for which their suspension from
the University has been recom
mended. Four of the defendants
would normally expect to be
playing varsity football in the
fall quarter, and one would ex
pect to play varsity basketball in
late fall and winter quarters.
One's first thought, of course,
is that student-athletes must not
gain special privilege or dispen
sation not available to student
non-athletes. I believe that, to
the greatest extent possible
under NCAA and Pacific-8 Con
ference regulations, student
athletes should be treated
exactly like other students.
It is the case, however, that in
nine instances over the past two
years, a student convicted of a
breach of student disciplinary
regulations and sentenced to a
quarter's suspension has been
given his/her choice of the quar
ter in which the suspension
would be applied. In the major
ity of such cases, the reason for
allowing such a choice has been
academic: e.g., a student facing
very serious disruption of his I
her program if a specific course
sequence could not be taken

when it was offered. But in four
cases it appears that other con
siderations entered into the mat
ter.
The practice has troublesome
implications, however, if it is
applied selectively and without
general criteria that can be in
voked. I would like here to
suggest that the most effective
way to assure equity, in the sense
of producing penalties that will
mean the same thing to all who
suffer them, will be to allow a
reasonable choice of the period
of suspension (usually exclud
ing summer quarter) for all con
victed offenders except those
whose offences are so threaten
ing to the community that they
ought to involve immediate or
protracted separation from the
University. By a "reasonable
choice" I mean a choice of one
out of the two or at most three
quarters succeeding the convic
tion.

any student there will probably
be a more or a less convenient

versity activities foregone, to

each case de novo whether the
particular University activity or
activities in question are more or

dent was suffering a penalty
roughly equal to another's.

careers, or possible deportation
for foreign students. Our experi

July 26, 1976
Dear Professor Casper:
This is in response to the ap
peal lodged with me in the cases
of Gary Anderson, Todd Ander
son, Mark Hill, George Schader,
Richard Waters, and Michael
Wilkinson, by Joseph W. Mell,
Attorney, on July 10, 1976.
First 1 shall describe briefly
the process by which 1 reviewed
the cases.
At defendants' request 1 met
with each of them individually,
and in one case with a defen
dant's parents. In addition to
studying Mr. Mell's argument
and the opinions submitted by
the Stanford Judicial Council on
June 24th, I read in full the ver
batim transcript of the SJC hear
ing. I also studied the history of
penalties in disciplinary cases
since the founding of the SJC in
1969.
Without enumerating each
and every argument made by de
fendants, their attorneys and
friends in favor of reducing the
penalties recommended by the
SJC, I believe that they can be
summarized as bearing for the
most part on the question of the
seriousness of the offences for
which defendants had admitted
responsibility through formal
stipulations. The property dam
age, even taken in toto, resulting
from the actions of the "patrol"
in the Beta House was not great,
and no one claimed to have suf
fered personal injury. Mr. Mell
has gone so far as to declare that.

"With the exception of the acts
of Todd Anderson, the activities
were relatively innocuous."
I cannot agree with that esti
mation. Rather, I find persuasive
the Council's statement that "the
context in which these events
occurred is crucial." That con
duct was not one of a spontane
ous eruption in a dormitory, in
which what starts out as no more
than friendly and mutual
rough-housing develops into
something more serious; in this
case, it involved a physical inva
sion of another dormitory, un
provoked by any action on the
part of the residents thereof, at
approximately 12:30 a.m. The
SJC has accurately described
(pp. 7-8) the dangerousness, the
potential for far more serious
harm than was done that night,
of this kind of proceeding, re
gardless of the extent of pre
planning or initial malicious in
tent Thus the argument that the
actions at the Beta House were
not "premeditated" is not ex
culpatory.
It was clearly the intention of
the SJC to make clear, by the
penalties invoked, the serious
ness of the offences in question.
"We view the behavior of the de
fendants as extremely serious
and completely beyond the
bounds of tolerable behavior in
our community." I accept that
judgment and the purpose thus
implied for the penalties. Honest
minds can, of course, differ as to
the severity and dimensions of
the penalties necessary to
achieve this end.
A review of penalties imposed
in previous cases upon the re
commendation of the SJC does
not yield any clear and unam
biguous direction for the case
under consideration. Contrary to
widely held belief, cases involv
ing violent behavior in the
period of campus disruption
were not without serious penal
ties; convictions for "trashing"

or throwing rocks at University
buildings brought suspensions
varying from one to three
academic quarters. But no event
or sequence of events previously
tried by the SJC yields a parallel
to this case sufficiently close to
be very useful.
Extrapolation from Honor
Code cases, involving cheating
in academic work, is scarcely
possible, although one can at
least conclude that, since the
Council itself has set a one
quarter suspension as the nor
mal penalty for a first offence
under the Honor Code, such a
punishment is intended to be a
serious one.
Notwithstanding the lack of
apposite analogies, I have con
cluded that, with the exception
of Mr. T. Anderson, the penalties
recommended by the SJC as to
the remaining defendants go
somewhat beyond what is re
quired to emphasize the seri
ousness of the offences in ques
tion. . . .
I have taken into account also
the fact that, except for Mr.
Schader and Mr. Todd Ander
son, all the defendants came
forward with stipulations of
specific acts they had commit
ted, without there having been
witnesses among the Beta House
residents who could testify to
those actions. And Mr. Schader
came forward before he could
have known that there was tes
timony available as to his
specific actions.
There is no further point that
must be discussed, even though
it was not raised in Mr. Mell's
formal appeal, because it has
been raised by individual defen
dants and by others on their be
half. It is their prospective in
volvement in intercollegiate ath
letics during much of the period
for which their suspension from
the University has been recom
mended. Four of the defendants
would normally expect to be
playing varsity football in the
fall quarter, and one would ex
pect to play varsity basketball in
late fall and winter quarters.
One's first thought, of course,
is that student-athletes must not
gain special privilege or dispen
sation not available to student
non-athletes. I believe that, to
the greatest extent possible
under NCAA and Pacific-8 Con
ference regulations, student
athletes should be treated
exactly like other students.
It is the case, however, that in
nine instances over the past two
years, a student convicted of a
breach of student disciplinary
regulations and sentenced to a
quarter's suspension has been
given his/her choice of the quar
ter in which the suspension
would be applied. In the major
ity of such cases, the reason for
allowing such a choice has been
academic: e.g., a student facing
very serious disruption of his I
her program if a specific course
sequence could not be taken

when it was offered. But in four
cases it appears that other con
siderations entered into the mat
ter.
The practice has troublesome
implications, however, if it is
applied selectively and without
general criteria that can be in
voked. I would like here to
suggest that the most effective
way to assure equity, in the sense
of producing penalties that will
mean the same thing to all who
suffer them, will be to allow a
reasonable choice of the period
of suspension (usually exclud
ing summer quarter) for all con
victed offenders except those
whose offences are so threaten
ing to the community that they
ought to involve immediate or
protracted separation from the
University. By a "reasonable
choice" I mean a choice of one
out of the two or at most three
quarters succeeding the convic
tion.
Such a policy assumes that for
any student there will probably
be a more or a less convenient
time, in terms of legitimate Uni

versity activities foregone, to
serve out a suspension. Rather
than attempting to determine in
each case de novo whether the
particular University activity or
activities in question are more or
less deserving of consideration,
one would, by leaving that
judgment to the student, at least
assure that one suspended stu
dent was suffering a penalty
roughly equal to another's.
It should be noted that such a
criterion is not intended to ex
tend to secondary effects of sus
pension, such as delayed entr
ance into post-university
careers, or possible deportation
for foreign students. Our experi
ence, from the time in which it
was argued by some that suspen
sion was "capital punishment"
because it meant exposure to the
risk of being drafted, down to the
present has been that we cannot
possibly become involved in
such consideration of secondary
effects. They are too endlessly
ramifying, to difficult to judge,
and too often they would, if
taken into account, have the ef
fect of excluding whole classes
of students from meaningful
penalties entirely, as would have
been the case had the University
been willing to exempt from
suspension any student who was
subject to selective service.
To recapitulate this final
point: the rationale for allowing
a choice within limits of a period
for suspension rests on the fact
that, where the accomplishment
of significant individual pur
poses within the framework of
Stanford activities, both curricu
lar and extra-curricular, is in
volved it is extremely difficult to
attain equity of treatment. To the
question, "What will we accept
as constituting a significant
purpose in this context?" we can
respond that we shall, within
reasonable limits, leave that to
the student to determine in the
light of his/her own judgment.
I have decided, then, to main
tain the penalty recommended

for Mr. Todd Anderson, for the
reasons emphasized by the SJC:
"Mr. Anderson not only
caused property damage in the
course of his activities, but he
physically attacked a resident of
the Beta House. In the course of
the hearing, Mr. Anderson indi
cated that the reason for the at
tack upon this particular indi
vidual lay in the fact that the vic
tim had, during the past year,
written a letter highly critical of
the activities of the fraternity of
which Mr. Anderson was a
member. Thus, the attack was
not simply a random event, but
rather the victim was selected
because of particular malice on
Mr. Anderson's part. Fortu
nately, the victim did not suffer
any extensive physical injury.
By the same token, the potential
for such injury lay in the nature
of the fact of an attack itself, and
it must have been a highly in
timidating and frightening ex
perience. . . . We find that Mr.
Anderson's actions indicate that
he is not willing at the current
time to be a law-abiding member
of the University community.
We recommend that he be sus
pended from the University
until autumn quarter 1977."
There is no reason to allow
him a choice of quarters, both
because he has but one more
quarter's requirements at Stan
ford and because 1 believe that he
falls in the category of excep
tions noted above, those for
whom immediate or protracted
separation is indicated.
In the cases of Messrs. Gary
Anderson, Mark Hill, George
Schader and Richard Waters,
each is to serve a one-quarter
suspension during the academic
year 1976-77, with the choice of
quarter left to him to make. Each
must make that selection by the
first day of fall quarter, and the
choice, once made, shall be ir
revocable.
Finally, in the case of Mr.
Michael Wilkinson, the further
consideration has been ad

vanced by counsel for the de
fense and accepted by the SJC
that he would not have been pro
secuted at all had he not come
forward with an admission of
guilt; there were no witnesses
even to the fact of his presence at
the Beta House that night. I agree
with the statement in Mr. Boett
ner's concurring opinion:
. . that although Mr. Wilkin
son is no tess guilty than the
other four defendants charged
with similar offenses, nor is his
particular offense any less seri
ous than theirs, his voluntary
confession of participation in
the disturbance when he could
have escaped any punishment
suggests a considerably light
ened penalty. ... A willingness
to admit one's guilt and cooper
ate with the prosecution and the
SJC should be promoted. If the
majority recommendation (of
one quarter's suspension) is ac
cepted in full in his case, such
admissions and cooperation will
not be encouraged; discreet si
lence will."
Given those considerations,
and a very clear impression de
rived from talking with Mr. Wil
kinson that his behavior on the
night of May 19-20 was indeed
aberrational in the extreme for
him, he is to be suspended for
one academic quarter but that
penalty itself is to be suspended;
in its place he shall be required
to perform an 80 hours work fine
during that quarter in which he
would have chosen to serve his
suspension had the latter pen
alty been levied.
I trust that it will be clear from
this case that behavior of the
kind exhibited by the defendants
herein will be met with mean
ingful penalties at Stanford,
whatever may be the alleged
force of "tradition" in its favor.
1 am asking Dean Lyons by
copy of this letter to see to it that
these penalties are put into ef
fect.

would normally expect to be
playing varsity football in the
fall quarter, and one would ex
pect to play varsity basketball in
late fall and winter quarters.
One's first thought, of course,
is that student-athletes must not
gain special privilege or dispen
sation not available to student
non-athletes. I believe that, to
the greatest extent possible
under NCAA and Pacific-8 Con
ference regulations, student
athletes should be treated
exactly like other students.
It is the case, however, that in
nine instances over the past two
years, a student convicted of a
breach of student disciplinary
regulations and sentenced to a
quarter's suspension has been
given his/her choice of the quar
ter in which the suspension
would be applied. In the major
ity of such cases, the reason for
allowing such a choice has been
academic: e.g., a student facing
very serious disruption of his I
her program if a specific course
sequence could not be taken

when it was offered. But in four
cases it appears that other con
siderations entered into the mat
ter.
The practice has troublesome
implications, however, if it is
applied selectively and without
general criteria that can be in
voked. I would like here to
suggest that the most effective
way to assure equity, in the sense
of producing penalties that will
mean the same thing to all who
suffer them, will be to allow a
reasonable choice of the period
of suspension (usually exclud
ing summer quarter) for all con
victed offenders except those
whose offences are so threaten
ing to the community that they
ought to involve immediate or
protracted separation from the
University. By a "reasonable
choice" I mean a choice of one
out of the two or at most three
quarters succeeding the convic
tion.
Such a policy assumes that for
any student there will probably
be a more or a less convenient
time, in terms of legitimate Uni

versity activities foregone, to
serve out a suspension. Rather
than attempting to determine in
each case de novo whether the
particular University activity or
activities in question are more or
less deserving of consideration,
one would, by leaving that
judgment to the student, at least
assure that one suspended stu
dent was suffering a penalty
roughly equal to another's.
It should be noted that such a
criterion is not intended to ex
tend to secondary effects of sus
pension, such as delayed entr
ance into post-university
careers, or possible deportation
for foreign students. Our experi
ence, from the time in which it
was argued by some that suspen
sion was "capital punishment"
because it meant exposure to the
risk of being drafted, down to the
present has been that we cannot
possibly become involved in
such consideration of secondary
effects. They are too endlessly
ramifying, to difficult to judge,
and too often they would, if
taken into account, have the ef
fect of excluding whole classes
of students from meaningful
penalties entirely, as would have
been the case had the University
been willing to exempt from
suspension any student who was
subject to selective service.
To recapitulate this final
point: the rationale for allowing
a choice within limits of a period
for suspension rests on the fact
that, where the accomplishment
of significant individual pur
poses within the framework of
Stanford activities, both curricu
lar and extra-curricular, is in
volved it is extremely difficult to
attain equity of treatment. To the
question, "What will we accept
as constituting a significant
purpose in this context?" we can
respond that we shall, within
reasonable limits, leave that to
the student to determine in the
light of his/her own judgment.
I have decided, then, to main
tain the penalty recommended

for Mr. Todd Anderson, for the
reasons emphasized by the SJC:
"Mr. Anderson not only
caused property damage in the
course of his activities, but he
physically attacked a resident of
the Beta House. In the course of
the hearing, Mr. Anderson indi
cated that the reason for the at
tack upon this particular indi
vidual lay in the fact that the vic
tim had, during the past year,
written a letter highly critical of
the activities of the fraternity of
which Mr. Anderson was a
member. Thus, the attack was
not simply a random event, but
rather the victim was selected
because of particular malice on
Mr. Anderson's part. Fortu
nately, the victim did not suffer
any extensive physical injury.
By the same token, the potential
for such injury lay in the nature
of the fact of an attack itself, and
it must have been a highly in
timidating and frightening ex
perience. . . . We find that Mr.
Anderson's actions indicate that
he is not willing at the current
time to be a law-abiding member
of the University community.
We recommend that he be sus
pended from the University
until autumn quarter 1977."
There is no reason to allow
him a choice of quarters, both
because he has but one more
quarter's requirements at Stan
ford and because 1 believe that he
falls in the category of excep
tions noted above, those for
whom immediate or protracted
separation is indicated.
In the cases of Messrs. Gary
Anderson, Mark Hill, George
Schader and Richard Waters,
each is to serve a one-quarter
suspension during the academic
year 1976-77, with the choice of
quarter left to him to make. Each
must make that selection by the
first day of fall quarter, and the
choice, once made, shall be ir
revocable.
Finally, in the case of Mr.
Michael Wilkinson, the further
consideration has been ad

vanced by counsel for the de
fense and accepted by the SJC
that he would not have been pro
secuted at all had he not come
forward with an admission of
guilt; there were no witnesses
even to the fact of his presence at
the Beta House that night. I agree
with the statement in Mr. Boett
ner's concurring opinion:
. . that although Mr. Wilkin
son is no tess guilty than the
other four defendants charged
with similar offenses, nor is his
particular offense any less seri
ous than theirs, his voluntary
confession of participation in
the disturbance when he could
have escaped any punishment
suggests a considerably light
ened penalty. ... A willingness
to admit one's guilt and cooper
ate with the prosecution and the
SJC should be promoted. If the
majority recommendation (of
one quarter's suspension) is ac
cepted in full in his case, such
admissions and cooperation will
not be encouraged; discreet si
lence will."
Given those considerations,
and a very clear impression de
rived from talking with Mr. Wil
kinson that his behavior on the
night of May 19-20 was indeed
aberrational in the extreme for
him, he is to be suspended for
one academic quarter but that
penalty itself is to be suspended;
in its place he shall be required
to perform an 80 hours work fine
during that quarter in which he
would have chosen to serve his
suspension had the latter pen
alty been levied.
I trust that it will be clear from
this case that behavior of the
kind exhibited by the defendants
herein will be met with mean
ingful penalties at Stanford,
whatever may be the alleged
force of "tradition" in its favor.
1 am asking Dean Lyons by
copy of this letter to see to it that
these penalties are put into ef
fect.
Sincerely yours,

July 26, 1976
Dear Professor Casper:
This is in response to the ap
peal lodged with me in the cases
of Gary Anderson, Todd Ander
son, Mark Hill, George Schader,
Richard Waters, and Michael
Wilkinson, by Joseph W. Mell,
Attorney, on July 10, 1976.
First 1 shall describe briefly
the process by which 1 reviewed
the cases.
At defendants' request 1 met
with each of them individually,
and in one case with a defen
dant's parents. In addition to
studying Mr. Mell's argument
and the opinions submitted by
the Stanford Judicial Council on
June 24th, I read in full the ver
batim transcript of the SJC hear
ing. I also studied the history of
penalties in disciplinary cases
since the founding of the SJC in
1969.
Without enumerating each
and every argument made by de
fendants, their attorneys and
friends in favor of reducing the
penalties recommended by the
SJC, I believe that they can be
summarized as bearing for the
most part on the question of the
seriousness of the offences for
which defendants had admitted
responsibility through formal
stipulations. The property dam
age, even taken in toto, resulting
from the actions of the "patrol"
in the Beta House was not great,
and no one claimed to have suf
fered personal injury. Mr. Mell
has gone so far as to declare that.

"With the exception of the acts
of Todd Anderson, the activities
were relatively innocuous."
I cannot agree with that esti
mation. Rather, I find persuasive
the Council's statement that "the
context in which these events
occurred is crucial." That con
duct was not one of a spontane
ous eruption in a dormitory, in
which what starts out as no more
than friendly and mutual
rough-housing develops into
something more serious; in this
case, it involved a physical inva
sion of another dormitory, un
provoked by any action on the
part of the residents thereof, at
approximately 12:30 a.m. The
SJC has accurately described
(pp. 7-8) the dangerousness, the
potential for far more serious
harm than was done that night,
of this kind of proceeding, re
gardless of the extent of pre
planning or initial malicious in
tent Thus the argument that the
actions at the Beta House were
not "premeditated" is not ex
culpatory.
It was clearly the intention of
the SJC to make clear, by the
penalties invoked, the serious
ness of the offences in question.
"We view the behavior of the de
fendants as extremely serious
and completely beyond the
bounds of tolerable behavior in
our community." I accept that
judgment and the purpose thus
implied for the penalties. Honest
minds can, of course, differ as to
the severity and dimensions of
the penalties necessary to
achieve this end.
A review of penalties imposed
in previous cases upon the re
commendation of the SJC does
not yield any clear and unam
biguous direction for the case
under consideration. Contrary to
widely held belief, cases involv
ing violent behavior in the
period of campus disruption
were not without serious penal
ties; convictions for "trashing"

or throwing rocks at University
buildings brought suspensions
varying from one to three
academic quarters. But no event
or sequence of events previously
tried by the SJC yields a parallel
to this case sufficiently close to
be very useful.
Extrapolation from Honor
Code cases, involving cheating
in academic work, is scarcely
possible, although one can at
least conclude that, since the
Council itself has set a one
quarter suspension as the nor
mal penalty for a first offence
under the Honor Code, such a
punishment is intended to be a
serious one.
Notwithstanding the lack of
apposite analogies, I have con
cluded that, with the exception
of Mr. T. Anderson, the penalties
recommended by the SJC as to
the remaining defendants go
somewhat beyond what is re
quired to emphasize the seri
ousness of the offences in ques
tion. . . .
I have taken into account also
the fact that, except for Mr.
Schader and Mr. Todd Ander
son, all the defendants came
forward with stipulations of
specific acts they had commit
ted, without there having been
witnesses among the Beta House
residents who could testify to
those actions. And Mr. Schader
came forward before he could
have known that there was tes
timony available as to his
specific actions.
There is no further point that
must be discussed, even though
it was not raised in Mr. Mell's
formal appeal, because it has
been raised by individual defen
dants and by others on their be
half. It is their prospective in
volvement in intercollegiate ath
letics during much of the period
for which their suspension from
the University has been recom
mended. Four of the defendants
would normally expect to be
playing varsity football in the
fall quarter, and one would ex
pect to play varsity basketball in
late fall and winter quarters.
One's first thought, of course,
is that student-athletes must not
gain special privilege or dispen
sation not available to student
non-athletes. I believe that, to
the greatest extent possible
under NCAA and Pacific-8 Con
ference regulations, student
athletes should be treated
exactly like other students.
It is the case, however, that in
nine instances over the past two

breach of student disciplinary
regulations and sentenced to a

given his/her choice of the quar
ter in which the suspension
would be applied. In the major

allowing such a choice has been
academic: e.g., a student facing
very serious disruption of his I
her program if a specific course
sequence could not be taken

when it was offered. But in four
cases it appears that other con
siderations entered into the mat
ter.
The practice has troublesome
implications, however, if it is

general criteria that can be in

of producing penalties that will

son is no tess guilty than the
other four defendants charged
with similar offenses, nor is his
particular offense any less seri
ous than theirs, his voluntary
confession of participation in
the disturbance when he could
have escaped any punishment
suggests a considerably light
ened penalty. ... A willingness
to admit one's guilt and cooper
ate with the prosecution and the
SJC should be promoted. If the
majority recommendation (of
one quarter's suspension) is ac
cepted in full in his case, such
admissions and cooperation will
not be encouraged; discreet si
lence will."
Given those considerations,
and a very clear impression de
rived from talking with Mr. Wil
kinson that his behavior on the
night of May 19-20 was indeed
aberrational in the extreme for
him, he is to be suspended for
one academic quarter but that
penalty itself is to be suspended;
in its place he shall be required
to perform an 80 hours work fine
during that quarter in which he
would have chosen to serve his
suspension had the latter pen
alty been levied.
I trust that it will be clear from
this case that behavior of the
kind exhibited by the defendants
herein will be met with mean
ingful penalties at Stanford,
whatever may be the alleged
force of "tradition" in its favor.
1 am asking Dean Lyons by

these penalties are put into ef

July 26, 1976
Dear Professor Casper:
This is in response to the ap
peal lodged with me in the cases
of Gary Anderson, Todd Ander
son, Mark Hill, George Schader,
Richard Waters, and Michael
Wilkinson, by Joseph W. Mell,
Attorney, on July 10, 1976.
First 1 shall describe briefly
the process by which 1 reviewed
the cases.
At defendants' request 1 met
with each of them individually,
and in one case with a defen
dant's parents. In addition to
studying Mr. Mell's argument
and the opinions submitted by
the Stanford Judicial Council on
June 24th, I read in full the ver
batim transcript of the SJC hear
ing. I also studied the history of
penalties in disciplinary cases
since the founding of the SJC in
1969.
Without enumerating each
and every argument made by de
fendants, their attorneys and
friends in favor of reducing the
penalties recommended by the
SJC, I believe that they can be
summarized as bearing for the
most part on the question of the
seriousness of the offences for
which defendants had admitted
responsibility through formal
stipulations. The property dam
age, even taken in toto, resulting
from the actions of the "patrol"
in the Beta House was not great,
and no one claimed to have suf
fered personal injury. Mr. Mell
has gone so far as to declare that.

"With the exception of the acts
of Todd Anderson, the activities
were relatively innocuous."
I cannot agree with that esti
mation. Rather, I find persuasive
the Council's statement that "the
context in which these events
occurred is crucial." That con
duct was not one of a spontane
ous eruption in a dormitory, in
which what starts out as no more
than friendly and mutual
rough-housing develops into
something more serious; in this
case, it involved a physical inva
sion of another dormitory, un
provoked by any action on the
part of the residents thereof, at
approximately 12:30 a.m. The
SJC has accurately described
(pp. 7-8) the dangerousness, the
potential for far more serious
harm than was done that night,
of this kind of proceeding, re
gardless of the extent of pre
planning or initial malicious in
tent Thus the argument that the
actions at the Beta House were
not "premeditated" is not ex
culpatory.
It was clearly the intention of
the SJC to make clear, by the
penalties invoked, the serious
ness of the offences in question.
"We view the behavior of the de
fendants as extremely serious
and completely beyond the
bounds of tolerable behavior in
our community." I accept that
judgment and the purpose thus
implied for the penalties. Honest
minds can, of course, differ as to
the severity and dimensions of
the penalties necessary to
achieve this end.
A review of penalties imposed
in previous cases upon the re
commendation of the SJC does
not yield any clear and unam
biguous direction for the case
under consideration. Contrary to
widely held belief, cases involv
ing violent behavior in the
period of campus disruption
were not without serious penal
ties; convictions for "trashing"

or throwing rocks at University
buildings brought suspensions
varying from one to three
academic quarters. But no event
or sequence of events previously
tried by the SJC yields a parallel
to this case sufficiently close to
be very useful.
Extrapolation from Honor
Code cases, involving cheating
in academic work, is scarcely
possible, although one can at
least conclude that, since the
Council itself has set a one
quarter suspension as the nor
mal penalty for a first offence
under the Honor Code, such a
punishment is intended to be a
serious one.
Notwithstanding the lack of
apposite analogies, I have con
cluded that, with the exception
of Mr. T. Anderson, the penalties
recommended by the SJC as to
the remaining defendants go
somewhat beyond what is re
quired to emphasize the seri
ousness of the offences in ques
tion. . . .
I have taken into account also
the fact that, except for Mr.
Schader and Mr. Todd Ander
son, all the defendants came
forward with stipulations of
specific acts they had commit
ted, without there having been
witnesses among the Beta House
residents who could testify to
those actions. And Mr. Schader
came forward before he could
have known that there was tes
timony available as to his
specific actions.
There is no further point that
must be discussed, even though
it was not raised in Mr. Mell's
formal appeal, because it has
been raised by individual defen
dants and by others on their be
half. It is their prospective in
volvement in intercollegiate ath
letics during much of the period
for which their suspension from
the University has been recom
mended. Four of the defendants
would normally expect to be
playing varsity football in the
fall quarter, and one would ex
pect to play varsity basketball in
late fall and winter quarters.
One's first thought, of course,
is that student-athletes must not
gain special privilege or dispen
sation not available to student
non-athletes. I believe that, to
the greatest extent possible
under NCAA and Pacific-8 Con
ference regulations, student
athletes should be treated
exactly like other students.
It is the case, however, that in
nine instances over the past two
years, a student convicted of a
breach of student disciplinary
regulations and sentenced to a
quarter's suspension has been
given his/her choice of the quar
ter in which the suspension
would be applied. In the major
ity of such cases, the reason for
allowing such a choice has been
academic: e.g., a student facing
very serious disruption of his I
her program if a specific course
sequence could not be taken

when it was offered. But in four
cases it appears that other con
siderations entered into the mat
ter.
The practice has troublesome
implications, however, if it is
applied selectively and without
general criteria that can be in
voked. I would like here to
suggest that the most effective
way to assure equity, in the sense
of producing penalties that will
mean the same thing to all who
suffer them, will be to allow a
reasonable choice of the period
of suspension (usually exclud
ing summer quarter) for all con
victed offenders except those
whose offences are so threaten
ing to the community that they
ought to involve immediate or
protracted separation from the
University. By a "reasonable
choice" I mean a choice of one
out of the two or at most three
quarters succeeding the convic
tion.
Such a policy assumes that for
any student there will probably
be a more or a less convenient
time, in terms of legitimate Uni

versity activities foregone, to
serve out a suspension. Rather
than attempting to determine in
each case de novo whether the
particular University activity or
activities in question are more or
less deserving of consideration,
one would, by leaving that
judgment to the student, at least
assure that one suspended stu
dent was suffering a penalty
roughly equal to another's.
It should be noted that such a
criterion is not intended to ex
tend to secondary effects of sus
pension, such as delayed entr
ance into post-university
careers, or possible deportation
for foreign students. Our experi
ence, from the time in which it
was argued by some that suspen
sion was "capital punishment"
because it meant exposure to the
risk of being drafted, down to the
present has been that we cannot
possibly become involved in
such consideration of secondary
effects. They are too endlessly
ramifying, to difficult to judge,
and too often they would, if
taken into account, have the ef
fect of excluding whole classes
of students from meaningful
penalties entirely, as would have
been the case had the University
been willing to exempt from
suspension any student who was
subject to selective service.
To recapitulate this final
point: the rationale for allowing
a choice within limits of a period
for suspension rests on the fact
that, where the accomplishment
of significant individual pur
poses within the framework of
Stanford activities, both curricu
lar and extra-curricular, is in
volved it is extremely difficult to
attain equity of treatment. To the
question, "What will we accept
as constituting a significant
purpose in this context?" we can
respond that we shall, within
reasonable limits, leave that to
the student to determine in the
light of his/her own judgment.
I have decided, then, to main
tain the penalty recommended

for Mr. Todd Anderson, for the
reasons emphasized by the SJC:
"Mr. Anderson not only
caused property damage in the
course of his activities, but he
physically attacked a resident of
the Beta House. In the course of
the hearing, Mr. Anderson indi
cated that the reason for the at
tack upon this particular indi
vidual lay in the fact that the vic
tim had, during the past year,
written a letter highly critical of
the activities of the fraternity of
which Mr. Anderson was a
member. Thus, the attack was
not simply a random event, but
rather the victim was selected
because of particular malice on
Mr. Anderson's part. Fortu
nately, the victim did not suffer
any extensive physical injury.
By the same token, the potential
for such injury lay in the nature
of the fact of an attack itself, and
it must have been a highly in
timidating and frightening ex
perience. . . . We find that Mr.
Anderson's actions indicate that
he is not willing at the current
time to be a law-abiding member
of the University community.
We recommend that he be sus
pended from the University
until autumn quarter 1977."
There is no reason to allow
him a choice of quarters, both
because he has but one more
quarter's requirements at Stan
ford and because 1 believe that he
falls in the category of excep
tions noted above, those for
whom immediate or protracted
separation is indicated.
In the cases of Messrs. Gary
Anderson, Mark Hill, George
Schader and Richard Waters,
each is to serve a one-quarter
suspension during the academic
year 1976-77, with the choice of
quarter left to him to make. Each
must make that selection by the
first day of fall quarter, and the
choice, once made, shall be ir
revocable.
Finally, in the case of Mr.
Michael Wilkinson, the further
consideration has been ad

vanced by counsel for the de
fense and accepted by the SJC
that he would not have been pro
secuted at all had he not come
forward with an admission of
guilt; there were no witnesses
even to the fact of his presence at
the Beta House that night. I agree
with the statement in Mr. Boett
ner's concurring opinion:
. . that although Mr. Wilkin
son is no tess guilty than the
other four defendants charged
with similar offenses, nor is his
particular offense any less seri
ous than theirs, his voluntary
confession of participation in
the disturbance when he could
have escaped any punishment
suggests a considerably light
ened penalty. ... A willingness
to admit one's guilt and cooper
ate with the prosecution and the
SJC should be promoted. If the
majority recommendation (of
one quarter's suspension) is ac
cepted in full in his case, such
admissions and cooperation will
not be encouraged; discreet si
lence will."
Given those considerations,
and a very clear impression de
rived from talking with Mr. Wil
kinson that his behavior on the
night of May 19-20 was indeed
aberrational in the extreme for
him, he is to be suspended for
one academic quarter but that
penalty itself is to be suspended;
in its place he shall be required

during that quarter in which he
would have chosen to serve his
suspension had the latter pen
alty been levied.
I trust that it will be clear from
this case that behavior of the
kind exhibited by the defendants
herein will be met with mean
ingful penalties at Stanford,
whatever may be the alleged
force of "tradition" in its favor.

these penalties are put into ef

Schader and Mr. Todd Ander
son, all the defendants came
forward with stipulations of
specific acts they had commit
ted, without there having been
witnesses among the Beta House
residents who could testify to
those actions. And Mr. Schader
came forward before he could
have known that there was tes
timony available as to his
specific actions.
There is no further point that
must be discussed, even though
it was not raised in Mr. Mell's
formal appeal, because it has
been raised by individual defen
dants and by others on their be
half. It is their prospective in
volvement in intercollegiate ath
letics during much of the period
for which their suspension from
the University has been recom
mended. Four of the defendants
would normally expect to be
playing varsity football in the
fall quarter, and one would ex
pect to play varsity basketball in
late fall and winter quarters.
One's first thought, of course,
is that student-athletes must not
gain special privilege or dispen
sation not available to student
non-athletes. I believe that, to
the greatest extent possible
under NCAA and Pacific-8 Con
ference regulations, student
athletes should be treated
exactly like other students.
It is the case, however, that in
nine instances over the past two
years, a student convicted of a
breach of student disciplinary
regulations and sentenced to a
quarter's suspension has been
given his/her choice of the quar
ter in which the suspension
would be applied. In the major
ity of such cases, the reason for
allowing such a choice has been
academic: e.g., a student facing
very serious disruption of his I
her program if a specific course
sequence could not be taken

when it was offered. But in four
cases it appears that other con
siderations entered into the mat
ter.
The practice has troublesome
implications, however, if it is
applied selectively and without
general criteria that can be in
voked. I would like here to
suggest that the most effective
way to assure equity, in the sense
of producing penalties that will
mean the same thing to all who
suffer them, will be to allow a
reasonable choice of the period
of suspension (usually exclud
ing summer quarter) for all con
victed offenders except those
whose offences are so threaten
ing to the community that they
ought to involve immediate or
protracted separation from the
University. By a "reasonable
choice" I mean a choice of one
out of the two or at most three
quarters succeeding the convic
tion.
Such a policy assumes that for
any student there will probably
be a more or a less convenient
time, in terms of legitimate Uni

versity activities foregone, to
serve out a suspension. Rather
than attempting to determine in
each case de novo whether the
particular University activity or
activities in question are more or
less deserving of consideration,
one would, by leaving that
judgment to the student, at least
assure that one suspended stu
dent was suffering a penalty
roughly equal to another's.
It should be noted that such a
criterion is not intended to ex
tend to secondary effects of sus
pension, such as delayed entr
ance into post-university
careers, or possible deportation
for foreign students. Our experi
ence, from the time in which it
was argued by some that suspen
sion was "capital punishment"
because it meant exposure to the
risk of being drafted, down to the
present has been that we cannot
possibly become involved in
such consideration of secondary
effects. They are too endlessly
ramifying, to difficult to judge,
and too often they would, if
taken into account, have the ef
fect of excluding whole classes
of students from meaningful
penalties entirely, as would have
been the case had the University
been willing to exempt from
suspension any student who was
subject to selective service.
To recapitulate this final
point: the rationale for allowing
a choice within limits of a period
for suspension rests on the fact
that, where the accomplishment
of significant individual pur
poses within the framework of
Stanford activities, both curricu
lar and extra-curricular, is in
volved it is extremely difficult to
attain equity of treatment. To the
question, "What will we accept
as constituting a significant
purpose in this context?" we can
respond that we shall, within
reasonable limits, leave that to
the student to determine in the
light of his/her own judgment.
I have decided, then, to main
tain the penalty recommended

for Mr. Todd Anderson, for the
reasons emphasized by the SJC:
"Mr. Anderson not only
caused property damage in the
course of his activities, but he
physically attacked a resident of
the Beta House. In the course of
the hearing, Mr. Anderson indi
cated that the reason for the at
tack upon this particular indi
vidual lay in the fact that the vic
tim had, during the past year,
written a letter highly critical of
the activities of the fraternity of
which Mr. Anderson was a
member. Thus, the attack was
not simply a random event, but
rather the victim was selected
because of particular malice on
Mr. Anderson's part. Fortu
nately, the victim did not suffer
any extensive physical injury.
By the same token, the potential
for such injury lay in the nature
of the fact of an attack itself, and
it must have been a highly in
timidating and frightening ex
perience. . . . We find that Mr.
Anderson's actions indicate that
he is not willing at the current
time to be a law-abiding member
of the University community.
We recommend that he be sus
pended from the University
until autumn quarter 1977."
There is no reason to allow
him a choice of quarters, both
because he has but one more
quarter's requirements at Stan
ford and because 1 believe that he
falls in the category of excep
tions noted above, those for
whom immediate or protracted
separation is indicated.
In the cases of Messrs. Gary
Anderson, Mark Hill, George
Schader and Richard Waters,
each is to serve a one-quarter
suspension during the academic
year 1976-77, with the choice of
quarter left to him to make. Each
must make that selection by the
first day of fall quarter, and the
choice, once made, shall be ir
revocable.
Finally, in the case of Mr.
Michael Wilkinson, the further
consideration has been ad

vanced by counsel for the de
fense and accepted by the SJC
that he would not have been pro
secuted at all had he not come
forward with an admission of
guilt; there were no witnesses
even to the fact of his presence at
the Beta House that night. I agree
with the statement in Mr. Boett
ner's concurring opinion:
. . that although Mr. Wilkin
son is no tess guilty than the
other four defendants charged
with similar offenses, nor is his
particular offense any less seri
ous than theirs, his voluntary
confession of participation in
the disturbance when he could
have escaped any punishment
suggests a considerably light
ened penalty. ... A willingness
to admit one's guilt and cooper
ate with the prosecution and the
SJC should be promoted. If the
majority recommendation (of
one quarter's suspension) is ac
cepted in full in his case, such
admissions and cooperation will
not be encouraged; discreet si
lence will."
Given those considerations,
and a very clear impression de
rived from talking with Mr. Wil
kinson that his behavior on the
night of May 19-20 was indeed
aberrational in the extreme for
him, he is to be suspended for
one academic quarter but that
penalty itself is to be suspended;
in its place he shall be required
to perform an 80 hours work fine
during that quarter in which he
would have chosen to serve his
suspension had the latter pen
alty been levied.
I trust that it will be clear from
this case that behavior of the
kind exhibited by the defendants
herein will be met with mean
ingful penalties at Stanford,
whatever may be the alleged
force of "tradition" in its favor.
1 am asking Dean Lyons by
copy of this letter to see to it that
these penalties are put into ef
fect.
Sincerely yours,

July 26, 1976
Dear Professor Casper:
This is in response to the ap
peal lodged with me in the cases
of Gary Anderson, Todd Ander
son, Mark Hill, George Schader,
Richard Waters, and Michael
Wilkinson, by Joseph W. Mell,
Attorney, on July 10, 1976.
First 1 shall describe briefly
the process by which 1 reviewed
the cases.
At defendants' request 1 met
with each of them individually,
and in one case with a defen
dant's parents. In addition to
studying Mr. Mell's argument
and the opinions submitted by
the Stanford Judicial Council on
June 24th, I read in full the ver
batim transcript of the SJC hear
ing. I also studied the history of
penalties in disciplinary cases
since the founding of the SJC in
1969.
Without enumerating each
and every argument made by de
fendants, their attorneys and
friends in favor of reducing the
penalties recommended by the
SJC, I believe that they can be
summarized as bearing for the
most part on the question of the
seriousness of the offences for
which defendants had admitted
responsibility through formal
stipulations. The property dam
age, even taken in toto, resulting
from the actions of the "patrol"
in the Beta House was not great,
and no one claimed to have suf
fered personal injury. Mr. Mell
has gone so far as to declare that.

"With the exception of the acts
of Todd Anderson, the activities
were relatively innocuous."
I cannot agree with that esti
mation. Rather, I find persuasive
the Council's statement that "the
context in which these events
occurred is crucial." That con
duct was not one of a spontane
ous eruption in a dormitory, in
which what starts out as no more
than friendly and mutual
rough-housing develops into
something more serious; in this
case, it involved a physical inva
sion of another dormitory, un
provoked by any action on the
part of the residents thereof, at
approximately 12:30 a.m. The
SJC has accurately described
(pp. 7-8) the dangerousness, the
potential for far more serious
harm than was done that night,
of this kind of proceeding, re
gardless of the extent of pre
planning or initial malicious in
tent Thus the argument that the
actions at the Beta House were
not "premeditated" is not ex
culpatory.
It was clearly the intention of
the SJC to make clear, by the
penalties invoked, the serious
ness of the offences in question.
"We view the behavior of the de
fendants as extremely serious
and completely beyond the
bounds of tolerable behavior in
our community." I accept that
judgment and the purpose thus
implied for the penalties. Honest
minds can, of course, differ as to
the severity and dimensions of
the penalties necessary to
achieve this end.
A review of penalties imposed
in previous cases upon the re
commendation of the SJC does
not yield any clear and unam
biguous direction for the case
under consideration. Contrary to
widely held belief, cases involv
ing violent behavior in the
period of campus disruption
were not without serious penal
ties; convictions for "trashing"

or throwing rocks at University
buildings brought suspensions
varying from one to three
academic quarters. But no event
or sequence of events previously
tried by the SJC yields a parallel
to this case sufficiently close to
be very useful.
Extrapolation from Honor
Code cases, involving cheating
in academic work, is scarcely
possible, although one can at
least conclude that, since the
Council itself has set a one
quarter suspension as the nor
mal penalty for a first offence
under the Honor Code, such a
punishment is intended to be a
serious one.
Notwithstanding the lack of
apposite analogies, I have con
cluded that, with the exception
of Mr. T. Anderson, the penalties
recommended by the SJC as to
the remaining defendants go
somewhat beyond what is re
quired to emphasize the seri
ousness of the offences in ques
tion. . . .
I have taken into account also
the fact that, except for Mr.
Schader and Mr. Todd Ander
son, all the defendants came
forward with stipulations of
specific acts they had commit
ted, without there having been
witnesses among the Beta House
residents who could testify to
those actions. And Mr. Schader
came forward before he could
have known that there was tes
timony available as to his
specific actions.
There is no further point that
must be discussed, even though
it was not raised in Mr. Mell's
formal appeal, because it has
been raised by individual defen
dants and by others on their be
half. It is their prospective in
volvement in intercollegiate ath
letics during much of the period
for which their suspension from
the University has been recom
mended. Four of the defendants
would normally expect to be
playing varsity football in the
fall quarter, and one would ex

late fall and winter quarters.

sation not available to student
non-athletes. I believe that, to

ference regulations, student
athletes should be treated
exactly like other students.

suspension during the academic
year 1976-77, with the choice of
quarter left to him to make. Each
must make that selection by the
first day of fall quarter, and the
choice, once made, shall be ir
revocable.
Finally, in the case of Mr.
Michael Wilkinson, the further
consideration has been ad

vanced by counsel for the de
fense and accepted by the SJC
that he would not have been pro
secuted at all had he not come
forward with an admission of
guilt; there were no witnesses
even to the fact of his presence at
the Beta House that night. I agree
with the statement in Mr. Boett
ner's concurring opinion:
. . that although Mr. Wilkin
son is no tess guilty than the
other four defendants charged
with similar offenses, nor is his
particular offense any less seri
ous than theirs, his voluntary
confession of participation in
the disturbance when he could
have escaped any punishment
suggests a considerably light
ened penalty. ... A willingness
to admit one's guilt and cooper
ate with the prosecution and the
SJC should be promoted. If the
majority recommendation (of
one quarter's suspension) is ac
cepted in full in his case, such
admissions and cooperation will
not be encouraged; discreet si
lence will."
Given those considerations,
and a very clear impression de
rived from talking with Mr. Wil
kinson that his behavior on the
night of May 19-20 was indeed
aberrational in the extreme for
him, he is to be suspended for
one academic quarter but that
penalty itself is to be suspended;
in its place he shall be required
to perform an 80 hours work fine
during that quarter in which he
would have chosen to serve his
suspension had the latter pen
alty been levied.
I trust that it will be clear from
this case that behavior of the
kind exhibited by the defendants
herein will be met with mean
ingful penalties at Stanford,
whatever may be the alleged
force of "tradition" in its favor.
1 am asking Dean Lyons by
copy of this letter to see to it that
these penalties are put into ef
fect.
Sincerely yours,
/s/Richard W. Lyman
