# Killing of seals tops government quotas

San Francisco (AP) — An in
creasing number of harp seals
have been killed despite Cana
dian government "quotas"
which followed the controversy
over clubbing of baby seals, a re
searcher said here.
David M. Lavigne, assistant
zoology professor at the Univer
sity of Cuelph in Ontario, said
Saturday that harp seal killing
has exceeded "what the public
seemed to believe was a firm
quota."
Lavigne told a conference here
of the Animal Protection Insti
tute of America that the 1976
seal kill was about 41,000 above
what the Canadian government
had expected. The total kill was
supposed to be 127,000, but the
actual kill was 168,000, he said
using preliminary government
figures.
He said it was so high because
there are no enforceable quotas
for what is designated as "an un-

controlled catch by landsmen"
although there are quotas on
larger commercial operation.
Lavigne said that the "uncon
trolled" part of the seal hunt had
been expected to take only
30,000 seals per year, but indi
vidual hunters and those operat
ing in small boats took about
70,000 — more than twice a
many as the government had an
ticipated.
Lavigne said that in 1975 the
"uncontrolled" part of the kill
accounted for 53,000 seal kills,
and in 1974 it accounted for
40,000 kills.
Belton P. Mouras, president of
the Animal Protection Institute,
said, "It's alarming that in spite
of all the attention which the kil
ling of seals has attracted, the ac
tual kill-rate has apparently out
run the estimated quotas which
the Canadian government was
adopting as a compromise."
