News and Publications Service

The final regulations implementing the federal Family Educa
tional Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 require that we publish
annually our institutional policy indicating how we intend to com
ply with that law. This document is intended to meet that require
ment. The regulations are lengthy and complex. What follows is an
attempt to describe them in sufficient detail so that students may be
informed generally of their rights. As noted below, copies of the
regulations themselves are available in the Registrar's Office for
anyone interested in greater detail.
I. SCOPE OF THE ACT
(a) General The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act of 1974 affords to persons who are currently, or who were
formerly, in attendance at the University as registered students a
right of access to their "education records" which contain informa
tion directly related to such persons.
Applicants, persons who unsuccessfully applied for admission,
and successful applicants who never enrolled in the University are
not covered by the Act. For these purposes, a student or former
student applying for admission to another school in the University
shall be considered an "applicant."
The Act also restricts the persons to whom the University may
disclose a student's education records without the student's written
permission.
(b) Records Covered. "Education records" of a student means
records, files, documents, and other materials regularly maintained
by the University which contain information directly related to a
student, and which are maintained in connection with the student's
attendance at the University.
There are a number of types of records which are excluded from
the scope of the Act. Thus, for example, a student is not entitled to
examine the following:
(i) Records maintained personally by faculty members which
are not available to others.
(ii) Records which are created or maintained by a physician,
psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional
which are created, maintained, or used only in connection with the
provision of treatment to a student and arc not available to anyone
other than persons providing such treatment. Thus, for example, a
student does not have the right to inspect records maintained by the
University Health Service or the Counseling and Psychological Servi
ces. However, such records can be personally reviewed by a physi
cian or other appropriate professionals of the student's choice.
(iii) Records (such as those which might be maintained by
University legal counsel), the confidentiality of which are protected
by law.
(iv) Records containing financial information about his or
her parents, such as information submitted in connection with an
application for financial aid, unless the parents have consented to
the student's seeing such information.
11. ACCESS RIGHTS OF STUDENTS
(a) Procedure. A student may obtain access to his or her educa
tion records by a request to the appropriate custodian. The Univer
sity is required by law to grant the request within 45 days. Ordinari
ly, such requests should be honored in much less time than that.
(b) Confidential Letters of Recommendation. In general, letters
and statements of recommendation obtained in the course of the
application process are not maintained as part of the student's
education records. However, in those cases where they are, a student
may have access to them. But this right does not apply to such
letters and statements placed in the student's education records
prior to Jan. 1, 1975, if such letters or statements are not used for
purposes other than those for which they were specifically intended.
A student may, by signing a written waiver, relinquish his or her
right to inspect confidential recommendations respecting (1) admis
sion to any educational institution; (2) application for employ
ment; or (3) the receipt of an honor or honorary recognition.
In no case will any student be required by the University to
waive his or her rights of access to confidential recommendations.
However, a student may find it appropriate to do so for a number of
reasons. For example, the student may feel that his or her professors
will write more candid and helpful letters of recommendation if the
letters are not available to the student.
(c) Copying. A student will ordinarily not be provided with
copies of any part of his or her record, other than a transcript,
unless the inability to obtain copies would effectively prevent the
student from exercising his or her right to inspect and review his or
her education records. For example, a former student living some
distance away would effectively be prevented from exercising rights
of access if copies were refused.
In cases where copies will be provided, the department or office
of the University maintaining the record in question may impose a
charge for making such copies at such uniform and reasonable rates
as it shall determine. Each department or office should establish and
make readily available a schedule of such charges.
(d) Other Rights.
(i) A student also has the right to be made aware of the
types of education records which are maintained by the University
related to students. Generally, education records of a student will be
maintained by the Office of the Registrar, the office of the school
or department in which the student is enrolled, and the office of the
department of the student's major field of study. In addition, the

University Health Service maintains records relating to students who
have utilized its facilities. If a student has utilized a placement office
at the University, such office may also maintain records relating to
the student.
Each office which maintains education records has been directed
to post notices of that fact, indicating the types of records main
tained and designating a custodian. Copies of those notices will, in
due course, be available at the Office of the Registrar.
(ii) A student may request that his records be amended to
eliminate any information contained therein which he or she be
lieves is inaccurate, misleading, or violates his or her privacy or other
rights.
(iii) If the University decides to refuse to amend the records
of a student, the student is entitled to a hearing to challenge the
content of the education records in question in order to ensure that
such records are not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation
of the student's privacy or other rights. Normally, an informal
hearing will suffice with an officer of the University who has
authority to make changes in a student's records. If a student is
dissatisfied with the results of such a hearing, the student should be
referred to the Legal Advisor to the President.
(iv) If after a hearing the University decides that the stu
dent's records are not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in viola
tion of the student's privacy or other rights, the student has the
right to place in his or her records a statement commenting upon
the information and/or setting forth any reasons for disagreement
with the University's decision.
111. ACCESS BY OR RELEASE TO OTHERS
(a) General. The University will not generally permit access to,
or release of, education records or personally identifiable informa
tion contained therein to any party without the written consent of
the student. However, the University may, as provided in the Act,
release such data to certain persons, including:
(i) Officials of the University who have a legitimate educa
tional interest in obtaining access to the records. Such access will be
granted to persons in the University who are determined by the
custodian of the records to require access for a purpose which is
directly related to, and in furtherance of, the educational program
of the University or the student's participation therein.
(ii) Persons who require access in connection with the stu
dents's application for, or receipt of, financial aid.
(iii) The University may release such information in compli
ance with a judicial order pursuant to any lawfully issued subpoena.
Before any information is so released, the University will first notify
the student at the student's most recent address as shown in the
University's records.
(iv) In connection with an emergency, the University may
release information from education records to appropriate persons if
the knowledge of such information is necessary to protect the
health or safety of a student or other persons.
(b) Release with Student's Consent. Upon written request by a
student, the University will release information from the student's
education records to third parties. The student should make a
request for such release to the department or office having custody
of the record involved. The University may impose a charge for
copying of a student's records in connection with such release.
(c) Transfer of Information by Third Parties. It shall be a
condition of the release by the University of any personal informa
tion on a student to a third party that the party to which the
information is released will not permit any other party to have
access to such information without the written consent of the
student. An institution to which such information is released ma>
permit its officers, employees, and agents to use such informatio..
but only for the purposes for which the disclosure was made.
(d) Directory Information. The University may release "direc
tory information" with respect to a student. The University is
required to give notice of the categories of information which it will
treat as "directory information."
Such notice has been given in the registration process, and
students have been given the right to have any or all of that
information withheld.
IV. GENERAL
(a) Copies of these "Guidelines and Statement of Policy" and
the DHEW regulations implementing the federal Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 are available at the Office of the
Registrar.
(b) Each office of the University that maintains education rec
ords should keep with each student's file a permanent record of all
parties who have requested access to the student's records, other
than custodians of such files and University officials normally deal
ing with such files in the performance of their duties. Such records
of access should indicate specifically the legitimate interest that
each such party had in obtaining access to a student's records and
whether or not the request was granted. A student may inspect such
records relating to his or her education recotds.
(c) (Questions about the interpretation of the Guidelines or the
regulations should be referred to the Legal Advisor to the President.
(d) Complaints regarding violations of a student's rights under
the Act may be filed with the Family Education Rights and Privacy
Office (FERPA), Department of Health, Education and Welfare,
330 Independence Avenue, S. W., Washington. D.C. 20201.
