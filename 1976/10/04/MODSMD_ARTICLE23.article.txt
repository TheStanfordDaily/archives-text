## Housewife works for peace under terrorist threat

Belfast, Northern Ireland (AP)
— "I know I might be shot by
terrorists," Betty Williams said.
"1 know I'm placing my own life
in danger. I'm aware of the risks,
terribly frightened, but what I
feel must be done overcomes my
fear."
Williams, 32, a Roman
Catholic housewife with a sea
faring husband and two chil
dren, was talking before leaving
Monday for the United States
about being co-leader of a

Protestant-Catholic women's
peace movement that has at
tracted a large following in
Northern Ireland.
She and Mairead Corrigan ,23
want to tell Irish-Americans to
stop sending money to organiza
tions which, they claim, help the
Irish Republican Army (IRA).
IRA and Protestant extremist
groups carry on hostilities
against each other in this
British-controlled province.
Because of her leadership in

the campaign, Williams has
been branded a traitor by the IRA
and thugs tried to burn her house
down.
WNED-TV, a Public Broad
casting System station in Buf
falo, N.Y., at one point called off
an interview with the two
women because of security
reasons, but later changed its
mind and says it will now broad
cast the interview.
Williams started the nonsecta
rian campaign after the deaths
Aug. 10 of three young children
of a Roman Catholic family —
the nephew and niece of Corri
gan. They were hit by a runaway
terrorist car whose driver had
been shot by British soldiers.
Williams, an attractive
brunette with blue-grey eyes,
was born in Andersonstown, the
Catholic stronghold where the
three children died.
Williams, who has a 12-year
old boy and a 5-year-old girl,
said she was horror-struck by the

deaths of the three children.
Until then there had been little
to distinguish her from
thousands of other Northern
Irish women living amid the
bombings,shootings and clashes
that have taken 1625 lives in
seven years.
She said she often prayed for
peace in her three-bedroom
home and had attended earlier
peace rallies. The deaths of the
children changed her.
"My whole life has been
turned upside down" she said.
"I used to worry about dust on
top of the television set and
cleaning everything until it
shone. Now it all takes second
place.
"Essentially this is a protest by
women. We are behind every
family, even those with terrorists
in them. To the mothers of ter
rorists, 1 can only say this: 1 think
they should look up to Cod and
ask forgiveness for what they
have done," she said.

"My whole life has been
turned upside down" she said.
"I used to worry about dust on
top of the television set and
cleaning everything until it
shone. Now it all takes second
place.
"Essentially this is a protest by
women. We are behind every
family, even those with terrorists
in them. To the mothers of ter

they should look up to Cod and
ask forgiveness for what they
have done," she said.
Belfast, Northern Ireland (AP)
— "I know I might be shot by
terrorists," Betty Williams said.
"1 know I'm placing my own life
in danger. I'm aware of the risks,
terribly frightened, but what I
feel must be done overcomes my
fear."
Williams, 32, a Roman
Catholic housewife with a sea
faring husband and two chil
dren, was talking before leaving
Monday for the United States
about being co-leader of a

Protestant-Catholic women's
peace movement that has at
tracted a large following in
Northern Ireland.
She and Mairead Corrigan ,23
want to tell Irish-Americans to
stop sending money to organiza
tions which, they claim, help the
Irish Republican Army (IRA).
IRA and Protestant extremist
groups carry on hostilities
against each other in this
British-controlled province.
Because of her leadership in

the campaign, Williams has
been branded a traitor by the IRA
and thugs tried to burn her house
down.
WNED-TV, a Public Broad
casting System station in Buf
falo, N.Y., at one point called off
an interview with the two
women because of security
reasons, but later changed its
mind and says it will now broad
cast the interview.
Williams started the nonsecta
rian campaign after the deaths
Aug. 10 of three young children
of a Roman Catholic family —
the nephew and niece of Corri
gan. They were hit by a runaway
terrorist car whose driver had
been shot by British soldiers.
Williams, an attractive
brunette with blue-grey eyes,
was born in Andersonstown, the
Catholic stronghold where the
three children died.
Williams, who has a 12-year
old boy and a 5-year-old girl,
said she was horror-struck by the

deaths of the three children.
Until then there had been little
to distinguish her from
thousands of other Northern
Irish women living amid the
bombings,shootings and clashes
that have taken 1625 lives in
seven years.
She said she often prayed for
peace in her three-bedroom
home and had attended earlier
peace rallies. The deaths of the
children changed her.
