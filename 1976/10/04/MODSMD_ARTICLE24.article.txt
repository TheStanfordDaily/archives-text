Northern Ireland (AP) —
Mairead Corrigan, at age 23 co
leader of a women's peace
movement drawing a large fol
lowing in Northern Ireland, says
Roman Catholic and Protestant
women here should "talk peace"
with their husbands and
neighbors.
"As a child I walked from Bel
fast's Catholic Falls Road to the
Protestant Shankill Road with
my mother," she said. "I thought
there was no difference between
Protestants and Catholics then.
Now I know there is no differ
ence today."
Corrigan, her first name is
pronounced ma-RED, goes to the
United States this week with the
founder of the movement, Betty
Williams, a housewife and
mother, to broaden their mission
to stop the violence that has kil
led 1625 persons in seven years
of sectarian conflict. The two
Catholic women want Irish-
Americans to stop giving finan
cial help to the Protestant and

Catholic-based extremist groups
— the former fighting to keep the
British here and the latter to oust
them.
Corrigan is the sister of Anne
Maguire, mother of three chil
dren killed in Belfast Aug. 10 by
a runaway terrortist car whose
driver had been shot by British
soldiers.
The shock of the deaths of her
nephews and niece led Corrigan
to join Williams in the nonsecta
rian campaign.
Corrigan has been a voluntary
community worker since she
was 14.
Like Williams and other peace
campaigners, Corrigan has been
called a traitor by the Provisional
wing of the Irish Republican
Army, which wants Northern
Ireland united with the southern
republic. "I don't care if I die,"
Corrigan said. "The fight for
peace goes en. I'm amazed at the
response to our movement.
Every day there have been tele
phone calls."
