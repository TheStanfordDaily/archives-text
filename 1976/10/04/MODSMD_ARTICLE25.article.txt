## Blow 20-point lead Cards upset by Army 
### Paul Bauman 
West Point, N.Y. — What
should have been a relatively
easy Stanford victory turned into
a thrilling last-second loss
Saturday as the Cardinals fell to
rallying Army, 21-20, before
30,382 fans at Michie Stadium.
Mike Michel could have won
it for Stanford when he got set for
a 42-yard field goal attempt with
one second left in the game, but
the ball sailed wide to the left,
and the Cards had their third loss
in four games this season.
It shouldn't have come down
to that kick though. It wouldn't
have if Stanford hadn't blown a
20-0 third-quarter lead.
Or if Michel had connected on
more than two of his previous
five field goal tries.
Or if the Cards' offense hadn't
stalled repeatedly after ap
proaching Army's goal line.
This last "if" was probably the
killer. Stanford got inside the
Cadets' 30-yard line three times
without scoring so much as a
field goal. On another occasion,
the Cards advanced to Army's
11-yard line and had to settle for
three points.
"It puts pressure on the de
fense when you don't score
more, which 1 think we should
have," Stanford head coach Jack
Christiansen said.
The reason for Stanford's ina
bility to put the ball over the goal
line was simple — penalties. The

Cards were called for offensive
holding five times, four of them
coming inside Army's 35-yard
line. In all, Stanford was
penalized 11 times for 121 yards,
Army twice for 26 yards.
The Cards still seemed to be in
good shape with a 20-point lead,
especially considering that
Army had done absolutely no
thing offensively in the first two
and one-half quarters. But the
Cadets came back on a series of
incredible big plays.
The first came on a second
and-one situation at Stanford's
45-yard line. Army quarterback
Leamon Hall, who went into the
game as the NCAA passing
leader, faked a handoff and
completed a 39-yard pass to Greg
McGlasker over the Cards'
Savann Thompson. The Cadets
scored their first touchdown two
plays later.
Long pass
Army came up with another
bigee in the fourth quarter when
split end George Dunaway went
52 yards with a Hall pass.
Thompson saved a touchdown,
dragging Dunaway down on the
Card 28. Army went the rest of
the way, aided by a pass interfer
ence call on Stanford cornerback
John Pigott, and the score was
20-13. The Cadets missed the
extra point, which was to add
some suspense later.
The next time Army got the
ball, 5:19 remained in the game.

The Cadets were caught holding,
setting up a third-and-24 situa
tion on their own 20. Hall hit his
favorite target, tight end Clennie
Brundidge, for 25 yards and
Army was on its way.
Another critical play occurred
on the same drive when it ap
peared that Stanford had stop
ped Army. On third-and-five at
the Stanford 8-yard line. Card
safety Ralph Phillips broke up an
Army pass play, but pass inter
ference was called. Christiansen
said he thought Phillips' play
was "as clean as could be."
Hall went over from the one
with 1:18 to go to make it 20-19,
Stanford. Then came the big
question: do you go for the extra
point or for the two-point con
version? As Stanford basketball
coach Dick Dißiaso, who at
tended the game, put it, "When
the military goes for a tie, we're
all in trouble."
Hall threw to Brundidge over
the middle and Army took the
lead, 21-20.
Without any one of these
plays, Army would probably not
have won. But whenever the
Cadets needed a break, or a first
down, they got it.
Game not over
Stanford still had a chance.
Running back Billie Anderson
returned Army's kickoff to Stan
ford's 27 and quarterback Mike
Cordova, who played the entire
game after Guy Benjamin re
sprained his ankle in practice
last week, went to work. Cor
dova, totally in command, com
pleted three straight passes for
35, seven and 11 yards, putting
Stanford in field goal position. It
didn't matter.
Cordova had a good day, com
pleting 15 of 33 passes for 212
yards and two touchdowns. Sev
eral of his passes were dropped.
The two touchdown passes
featured one great run and one
great catch. The first was a short
square-out pattern to James Lof
ton, but Lofton, using some of
his track moves, cut back and
went 51 yards to score. On the
second TD pass, Vince Mulroy
cut across the end-zone and, par
tially shielded by an Army de

fender, caught a Cordova bullet.
A ruthless Stanford pass rush
kept Hall ineffective throughout
the first half. The only thing Ar
my's offensive line was blocking
was Hall's view. The Cadet QB
moved the team in the fourth
quarter when he finally wised up
and scrambled outside, giving
him time to throw.
"We lost containment on him.
and he hurt us," Christiansen
said, explaining Stanford's de
fensive lapse in the closing mi
nutes.
Halves different
The first half of the game bore
little resemblance to the second.
With the exception of one Army
drive, which ended on a missed
lield goal, the Cadet's deepest
penetration was their own 25-
yard line.
Army's first half offense con
sisted of little more than two
consecutive 17-yard passes from
Hall to Brundidge. Stanford held
Army to 64 total yards in the first
half.
Meanwhile, the Cards were
always getting the ball around
mid-field and gaining big yar
dage whether they ran or passed,
which is novel. Army was lucky
that Stanford led only 10-0 at
halftime.
Ironic game
The game was ironic in some
ways. The Cards finally con
quered their turnover problem
(they didn't suffer any fumbles
or interceptions), yet lost.
Stanford presented a balanced
offense for the first time this sea
son, rushing for 192 yards and
passing for 212, yet lost. Don
Stevenson led both teams with
102 yards on 21 carries. The
Cards pushed Army's light de
fensive line around with ease,
which probably had something
to do with their success on the
ground. It won't be as easy
against UCLA next week.
Finally, Stanford out-gained
Army, 404 total yards to 263, yet
lost. The Cadets had only 49
yards rushing.
And if not for those holding
penalties, Stanford might have
outscored Army.

incredible big plays.
The first came on a second
and-one situation at Stanford's
45-yard line. Army quarterback
Leamon Hall, who went into the
game as the NCAA passing
leader, faked a handoff and
completed a 39-yard pass to Greg
McGlasker over the Cards'
Savann Thompson. The Cadets
scored their first touchdown two
plays later.
Long pass
Army came up with another
bigee in the fourth quarter when
split end George Dunaway went
52 yards with a Hall pass.
Thompson saved a touchdown,
dragging Dunaway down on the
Card 28. Army went the rest of
the way, aided by a pass interfer
ence call on Stanford cornerback
John Pigott, and the score was
20-13. The Cadets missed the
extra point, which was to add
some suspense later.
The next time Army got the
ball, 5:19 remained in the game.

The Cadets were caught holding,
setting up a third-and-24 situa
tion on their own 20. Hall hit his
favorite target, tight end Clennie
Brundidge, for 25 yards and
Army was on its way.
Another critical play occurred
on the same drive when it ap
peared that Stanford had stop
ped Army. On third-and-five at
the Stanford 8-yard line. Card
safety Ralph Phillips broke up an
Army pass play, but pass inter
ference was called. Christiansen
said he thought Phillips' play
was "as clean as could be."
Hall went over from the one
with 1:18 to go to make it 20-19,
Stanford. Then came the big
question: do you go for the extra
point or for the two-point con
version? As Stanford basketball
coach Dick Dißiaso, who at
tended the game, put it, "When
the military goes for a tie, we're
all in trouble."
Hall threw to Brundidge over
the middle and Army took the
lead, 21-20.
Without any one of these
plays, Army would probably not
have won. But whenever the
Cadets needed a break, or a first
down, they got it.
Game not over
Stanford still had a chance.
Running back Billie Anderson
returned Army's kickoff to Stan
ford's 27 and quarterback Mike
Cordova, who played the entire
game after Guy Benjamin re
sprained his ankle in practice
last week, went to work. Cor
dova, totally in command, com
pleted three straight passes for
35, seven and 11 yards, putting
Stanford in field goal position. It
didn't matter.
Cordova had a good day, com
pleting 15 of 33 passes for 212
yards and two touchdowns. Sev
eral of his passes were dropped.
The two touchdown passes
featured one great run and one
great catch. The first was a short
square-out pattern to James Lof
ton, but Lofton, using some of
his track moves, cut back and
went 51 yards to score. On the
second TD pass, Vince Mulroy
cut across the end-zone and, par
tially shielded by an Army de

fender, caught a Cordova bullet.
A ruthless Stanford pass rush
kept Hall ineffective throughout
the first half. The only thing Ar
my's offensive line was blocking
was Hall's view. The Cadet QB
moved the team in the fourth
quarter when he finally wised up
and scrambled outside, giving
him time to throw.
"We lost containment on him.
and he hurt us," Christiansen
said, explaining Stanford's de
fensive lapse in the closing mi
nutes.
Halves different
The first half of the game bore
little resemblance to the second.
With the exception of one Army
drive, which ended on a missed
lield goal, the Cadet's deepest
penetration was their own 25-
yard line.
Army's first half offense con
sisted of little more than two
consecutive 17-yard passes from
Hall to Brundidge. Stanford held
Army to 64 total yards in the first
half.
Meanwhile, the Cards were
always getting the ball around
mid-field and gaining big yar
dage whether they ran or passed,
which is novel. Army was lucky
that Stanford led only 10-0 at
halftime.
Ironic game
The game was ironic in some
ways. The Cards finally con
quered their turnover problem
(they didn't suffer any fumbles
or interceptions), yet lost.
Stanford presented a balanced
offense for the first time this sea
son, rushing for 192 yards and
passing for 212, yet lost. Don
Stevenson led both teams with
102 yards on 21 carries. The
Cards pushed Army's light de
fensive line around with ease,
which probably had something
to do with their success on the
ground. It won't be as easy
against UCLA next week.
Finally, Stanford out-gained
Army, 404 total yards to 263, yet
lost. The Cadets had only 49
yards rushing.
And if not for those holding
penalties, Stanford might have
outscored Army.

Another big day
Stanford split end Vince Mulroy had another fine day in Stanford's 21-20 loss to Army. Mulroy
caught four passes for 48 yards and one touchdown. He is seen here against San Jose State
last week.
West Point, N.Y. — What
should have been a relatively
easy Stanford victory turned into
a thrilling last-second loss
Saturday as the Cardinals fell to
rallying Army, 21-20, before
30,382 fans at Michie Stadium.
Mike Michel could have won
it for Stanford when he got set for
a 42-yard field goal attempt with
one second left in the game, but
the ball sailed wide to the left,
and the Cards had their third loss
in four games this season.
It shouldn't have come down
to that kick though. It wouldn't
have if Stanford hadn't blown a
20-0 third-quarter lead.
Or if Michel had connected on
more than two of his previous
five field goal tries.
Or if the Cards' offense hadn't
stalled repeatedly after ap
proaching Army's goal line.
This last "if" was probably the
killer. Stanford got inside the
Cadets' 30-yard line three times
without scoring so much as a
field goal. On another occasion,
the Cards advanced to Army's
11-yard line and had to settle for
three points.
"It puts pressure on the de
fense when you don't score
more, which 1 think we should
have," Stanford head coach Jack
Christiansen said.
The reason for Stanford's ina
bility to put the ball over the goal
line was simple — penalties. The

Cards were called for offensive
holding five times, four of them
coming inside Army's 35-yard
line. In all, Stanford was
penalized 11 times for 121 yards,
Army twice for 26 yards.
The Cards still seemed to be in
good shape with a 20-point lead,
especially considering that
Army had done absolutely no
thing offensively in the first two
and one-half quarters. But the
Cadets came back on a series of
incredible big plays.

Hall threw to Brundidge over
the middle and Army took the
lead, 21-20.
Without any one of these
plays, Army would probably not
have won. But whenever the
Cadets needed a break, or a first
down, they got it.
Game not over
Stanford still had a chance.
Running back Billie Anderson
returned Army's kickoff to Stan
ford's 27 and quarterback Mike
Cordova, who played the entire
game after Guy Benjamin re
sprained his ankle in practice
last week, went to work. Cor
dova, totally in command, com
pleted three straight passes for
35, seven and 11 yards, putting
Stanford in field goal position. It
didn't matter.
Cordova had a good day, com
pleting 15 of 33 passes for 212
yards and two touchdowns. Sev
eral of his passes were dropped.
The two touchdown passes
featured one great run and one
great catch. The first was a short
square-out pattern to James Lof
ton, but Lofton, using some of
his track moves, cut back and
went 51 yards to score. On the
second TD pass, Vince Mulroy
cut across the end-zone and, par
tially shielded by an Army de

fender, caught a Cordova bullet.
A ruthless Stanford pass rush
kept Hall ineffective throughout
the first half. The only thing Ar
my's offensive line was blocking
was Hall's view. The Cadet QB
moved the team in the fourth
quarter when he finally wised up
and scrambled outside, giving
him time to throw.
"We lost containment on him.
and he hurt us," Christiansen
said, explaining Stanford's de
fensive lapse in the closing mi
nutes.
Halves different
The first half of the game bore
little resemblance to the second.
With the exception of one Army
drive, which ended on a missed
lield goal, the Cadet's deepest
penetration was their own 25-
yard line.
Army's first half offense con
sisted of little more than two
consecutive 17-yard passes from
Hall to Brundidge. Stanford held
Army to 64 total yards in the first
half.
Meanwhile, the Cards were
always getting the ball around
mid-field and gaining big yar
dage whether they ran or passed,
which is novel. Army was lucky
that Stanford led only 10-0 at
halftime.
Ironic game
The game was ironic in some
ways. The Cards finally con
quered their turnover problem
(they didn't suffer any fumbles
or interceptions), yet lost.
Stanford presented a balanced
offense for the first time this sea
son, rushing for 192 yards and
passing for 212, yet lost. Don
Stevenson led both teams with
102 yards on 21 carries. The
Cards pushed Army's light de
fensive line around with ease,
which probably had something
to do with their success on the
ground. It won't be as easy
against UCLA next week.
Finally, Stanford out-gained
Army, 404 total yards to 263, yet
lost. The Cadets had only 49
yards rushing.
And if not for those holding
penalties, Stanford might have
outscored Army.

Another big day
Stanford split end Vince Mulroy had another fine day in Stanford's 21-20 loss to Army. Mulroy
caught four passes for 48 yards and one touchdown. He is seen here against San Jose State
last week.
West Point, N.Y. — What
should have been a relatively
easy Stanford victory turned into
a thrilling last-second loss
Saturday as the Cardinals fell to
rallying Army, 21-20, before
30,382 fans at Michie Stadium.
Mike Michel could have won
it for Stanford when he got set for
a 42-yard field goal attempt with
one second left in the game, but
the ball sailed wide to the left,
and the Cards had their third loss
in four games this season.
It shouldn't have come down
to that kick though. It wouldn't
have if Stanford hadn't blown a
20-0 third-quarter lead.
Or if Michel had connected on
more than two of his previous
five field goal tries.
Or if the Cards' offense hadn't
stalled repeatedly after ap
proaching Army's goal line.
This last "if" was probably the
killer. Stanford got inside the
Cadets' 30-yard line three times
without scoring so much as a
field goal. On another occasion,
the Cards advanced to Army's
11-yard line and had to settle for
three points.
"It puts pressure on the de
fense when you don't score
more, which 1 think we should
have," Stanford head coach Jack
Christiansen said.
The reason for Stanford's ina
bility to put the ball over the goal
line was simple — penalties. The

Cards were called for offensive
holding five times, four of them
coming inside Army's 35-yard
line. In all, Stanford was
penalized 11 times for 121 yards,
Army twice for 26 yards.
The Cards still seemed to be in
good shape with a 20-point lead,
especially considering that
Army had done absolutely no
thing offensively in the first two
and one-half quarters. But the
Cadets came back on a series of
incredible big plays.
The first came on a second
and-one situation at Stanford's
45-yard line. Army quarterback
Leamon Hall, who went into the
game as the NCAA passing
leader, faked a handoff and
completed a 39-yard pass to Greg
McGlasker over the Cards'
Savann Thompson. The Cadets
scored their first touchdown two
plays later.
Long pass
Army came up with another
bigee in the fourth quarter when
split end George Dunaway went
52 yards with a Hall pass.
Thompson saved a touchdown,
dragging Dunaway down on the
Card 28. Army went the rest of
the way, aided by a pass interfer
ence call on Stanford cornerback
John Pigott, and the score was
20-13. The Cadets missed the
extra point, which was to add
some suspense later.
The next time Army got the
ball, 5:19 remained in the game.

The Cadets were caught holding,
setting up a third-and-24 situa
tion on their own 20. Hall hit his
favorite target, tight end Clennie
Brundidge, for 25 yards and
Army was on its way.
Another critical play occurred
on the same drive when it ap
peared that Stanford had stop
ped Army. On third-and-five at
the Stanford 8-yard line. Card
safety Ralph Phillips broke up an
Army pass play, but pass inter
ference was called. Christiansen
said he thought Phillips' play
was "as clean as could be."
Hall went over from the one
with 1:18 to go to make it 20-19,
Stanford. Then came the big
question: do you go for the extra
point or for the two-point con
version? As Stanford basketball
coach Dick Dißiaso, who at
tended the game, put it, "When
the military goes for a tie, we're
all in trouble."
Hall threw to Brundidge over
the middle and Army took the
lead, 21-20.

penetration was their own 25-
yard line.
Army's first half offense con
sisted of little more than two
consecutive 17-yard passes from
Hall to Brundidge. Stanford held
Army to 64 total yards in the first
half.
Meanwhile, the Cards were
always getting the ball around
mid-field and gaining big yar
dage whether they ran or passed,
which is novel. Army was lucky
that Stanford led only 10-0 at
halftime.
Ironic game
The game was ironic in some
ways. The Cards finally con
quered their turnover problem
(they didn't suffer any fumbles
or interceptions), yet lost.
Stanford presented a balanced
offense for the first time this sea
son, rushing for 192 yards and
passing for 212, yet lost. Don
Stevenson led both teams with
102 yards on 21 carries. The
Cards pushed Army's light de
fensive line around with ease,
which probably had something
to do with their success on the
ground. It won't be as easy
against UCLA next week.
Finally, Stanford out-gained
Army, 404 total yards to 263, yet
lost. The Cadets had only 49
yards rushing.
And if not for those holding
penalties, Stanford might have
outscored Army.

Another big day
Stanford split end Vince Mulroy had another fine day in Stanford's 21-20 loss to Army. Mulroy
caught four passes for 48 yards and one touchdown. He is seen here against San Jose State
last week.
West Point, N.Y. — What
should have been a relatively
easy Stanford victory turned into
a thrilling last-second loss
Saturday as the Cardinals fell to
rallying Army, 21-20, before
30,382 fans at Michie Stadium.
Mike Michel could have won
it for Stanford when he got set for
a 42-yard field goal attempt with
one second left in the game, but
the ball sailed wide to the left,
and the Cards had their third loss
in four games this season.
It shouldn't have come down
to that kick though. It wouldn't
have if Stanford hadn't blown a
20-0 third-quarter lead.
Or if Michel had connected on
more than two of his previous
five field goal tries.
Or if the Cards' offense hadn't
stalled repeatedly after ap
proaching Army's goal line.
This last "if" was probably the
killer. Stanford got inside the
Cadets' 30-yard line three times
without scoring so much as a
field goal. On another occasion,
the Cards advanced to Army's
11-yard line and had to settle for
three points.
"It puts pressure on the de
fense when you don't score
more, which 1 think we should
have," Stanford head coach Jack
Christiansen said.
The reason for Stanford's ina
bility to put the ball over the goal
line was simple — penalties. The

Cards were called for offensive
holding five times, four of them
coming inside Army's 35-yard
line. In all, Stanford was
penalized 11 times for 121 yards,
Army twice for 26 yards.
The Cards still seemed to be in
good shape with a 20-point lead,
especially considering that
Army had done absolutely no
thing offensively in the first two
and one-half quarters. But the
Cadets came back on a series of
incredible big plays.
The first came on a second
and-one situation at Stanford's
45-yard line. Army quarterback
Leamon Hall, who went into the
game as the NCAA passing
leader, faked a handoff and
completed a 39-yard pass to Greg
McGlasker over the Cards'
Savann Thompson. The Cadets
scored their first touchdown two
plays later.
Long pass
Army came up with another
bigee in the fourth quarter when
split end George Dunaway went
52 yards with a Hall pass.
Thompson saved a touchdown,
dragging Dunaway down on the
Card 28. Army went the rest of
the way, aided by a pass interfer
ence call on Stanford cornerback
John Pigott, and the score was
20-13. The Cadets missed the
extra point, which was to add
some suspense later.
The next time Army got the
ball, 5:19 remained in the game.

The Cadets were caught holding,
setting up a third-and-24 situa
tion on their own 20. Hall hit his
favorite target, tight end Clennie
Brundidge, for 25 yards and
Army was on its way.
Another critical play occurred
on the same drive when it ap
peared that Stanford had stop
ped Army. On third-and-five at
the Stanford 8-yard line. Card
safety Ralph Phillips broke up an
Army pass play, but pass inter
ference was called. Christiansen
said he thought Phillips' play
was "as clean as could be."
Hall went over from the one
with 1:18 to go to make it 20-19,
Stanford. Then came the big
question: do you go for the extra
point or for the two-point con
version? As Stanford basketball
coach Dick Dißiaso, who at
tended the game, put it, "When
the military goes for a tie, we're
all in trouble."
Hall threw to Brundidge over
the middle and Army took the
lead, 21-20.
Without any one of these
plays, Army would probably not
have won. But whenever the
Cadets needed a break, or a first
down, they got it.
Game not over
Stanford still had a chance.
Running back Billie Anderson
returned Army's kickoff to Stan
ford's 27 and quarterback Mike
Cordova, who played the entire
game after Guy Benjamin re
sprained his ankle in practice
last week, went to work. Cor
dova, totally in command, com
pleted three straight passes for
35, seven and 11 yards, putting
Stanford in field goal position. It
didn't matter.
Cordova had a good day, com
pleting 15 of 33 passes for 212
yards and two touchdowns. Sev
eral of his passes were dropped.
The two touchdown passes
featured one great run and one
great catch. The first was a short
square-out pattern to James Lof
ton, but Lofton, using some of
his track moves, cut back and
went 51 yards to score. On the
second TD pass, Vince Mulroy
cut across the end-zone and, par
tially shielded by an Army de

fender, caught a Cordova bullet.
A ruthless Stanford pass rush
kept Hall ineffective throughout
the first half. The only thing Ar
my's offensive line was blocking
was Hall's view. The Cadet QB
moved the team in the fourth
quarter when he finally wised up
and scrambled outside, giving
him time to throw.
"We lost containment on him.
and he hurt us," Christiansen
said, explaining Stanford's de
fensive lapse in the closing mi
nutes.
Halves different
The first half of the game bore
little resemblance to the second.
With the exception of one Army
drive, which ended on a missed
lield goal, the Cadet's deepest
penetration was their own 25-
yard line.
Army's first half offense con
sisted of little more than two
consecutive 17-yard passes from
Hall to Brundidge. Stanford held
Army to 64 total yards in the first
