# Pac-8 roundup
## Cal's Walker sets receiving record 
### Chris Baker 
Berkeley — California wide
receiver Wesley Walker could
hardly breathe.He stood in his
Memorial Stadium dressing
room cubicle surrounded by re
porters.
Walker had just completed the
best pass receiving performance
in Pacific-8 history. The senior
speed burner caught eight pas
ses for 289 yards and three
touchdowns, to lead the Golden
Bears to a 43-16 win over San
Jose State.
And he set up another Cal
touchdown with a 35-yard jaunt
on a reverse. On that run he
made six Spartan defenders

tackle each other. That's what
San Jose did al 1 day because their
defensive backs certainly
couldn't tackle him. The Spartan
defenders seemed as if they were
stuck in the mud which made
the Memorial Stadium field look
like the Bay mud flats.
'Happy day'
"This is a happy day in my
life," said Walker. "But I'm re
ally happier for (Cal reserve
quarterback) Fred Besana." Be
sana came in on Cal's fourth of
fensive possession of the game
and threw a 75-yard scoring
strike to Walker on his second
play.
Besana, who completed the

two passes he threw for 123
yards and two touchdowns,
came into the game after starting
Golden Bear quarterback Joe
Roth had thrown his first of two
interceptions.
"We had told Fred he was
going to play the fourth series of
the game," said Golden Bear
coach Mike White. "It wasn't be
cause we were not pleased with
Roth. We just wanted Fred to get
some game experience."
Walker needed 16 yards late in
the fourth quarter, with the Bears
leading 29-10, to break
Washington split end Dave Wil
liams' 257-yard performance set
in 1965 against UCLA.
Touchdown strike
So Besana came in to throw a
52-yard touchdown strike to
Walker. "Man, we've got two
great quarterbacks. I don't care
who is throwing to me, I'll catch
it," said Walker.
Walkers' performance also
bettered Steve Rivera's 205-yard
game against Stanford in the
1974 Big Game.
"Walker is the best receiver
we've faced this year," said
Spartan coach Lynn Stiles, "and
Gal was the best team we've
faced this year."
But San Jose State hasn't faced
UCLA. The Bruins, undefeated
after four games, are the class of
the conference. Stanford will try
to break that streak next Satur
day night in the Los Angeles Col
iseum.
Bruin blood
Ohio State coach Woody
Hayes was out for blood — the
Bruins' — when UCLA came to
Columbus Saturday for the ABC
Game-of-the-Week.

But with 10 seconds remain
ing in the contest the boos were
for Buckeye coach Woody Hayes
and not the Bruins, who angered
the Ohio State fans by beating
the Buckeyes in the Rose Bowl.
Hayes was jeered in the clos
ing seconds of Saturday's 10-10
tie because he refused to gamble
in the final moments of the
game.
"1 wasn't going to throw the
game away," said the conserva
tive Hayes. So the crusty Ohio
State coach ordered his Buc
keyes to punt on fourth-and-four
at the UCLA 41 -yard line with 30
seconds left in the game.
"UCLA would have been
within one good pass of a field
goal," said Hayes.
High scoring game
In Los Angeles Saturday
night, USC scored over 50 points
for the second game in a row.
Reserve quarterback Rob Hertel
threw four touchdown passes to
lead the Trojans to a 55-0 victory
over lowa.
USC tailback Ricky Bell
scored two touchdowns and
gained 119 yards on 28 carries to
stay in the Heisman Trophy race.
Bell left the game early in the
third period with USC leading
35-0.
The 55 points scored by the
Trojans gave them 154 for the
season, second only to Michigan
with 192.
Up in Seattle, Huskie rushers
had a field day, as Washington
handed Minnesota its first loss
30-7. Fullback Robin Earl rushed
for 112 yards and two
touchdowns. Washington tail
back Ronnie Rowland had a
155-yard day and also scored a

touchdown.
Oregon recovers
Oregon recovered from a 51-0
loss to USC last week by scoring
the first two times it touched the
ball to beat Utah State 27-9.
Washington State won its first
game and the "Battle of the
Palouse," as the Cougars routed
Idaho 45-6. Quarterback Jack
Thompson fired three
touchdowns, two to split end
Mike Levenseller and one to
flanker Brian Kelley.
Oregon State gave Syracuse its
first win of the season. Syracuse
quarterback Earl Vaughn raced
63 yards in the final period to
lead the Orangemen to a 21-3
win over the Beavers.

ally happier for (Cal reserve
quarterback) Fred Besana." Be
sana came in on Cal's fourth of
fensive possession of the game
and threw a 75-yard scoring
strike to Walker on his second
play.
Besana, who completed the

two passes he threw for 123
yards and two touchdowns,
came into the game after starting
Golden Bear quarterback Joe
Roth had thrown his first of two
interceptions.
"We had told Fred he was
going to play the fourth series of
the game," said Golden Bear
coach Mike White. "It wasn't be
cause we were not pleased with
Roth. We just wanted Fred to get
some game experience."
Walker needed 16 yards late in
the fourth quarter, with the Bears
leading 29-10, to break
Washington split end Dave Wil
liams' 257-yard performance set
in 1965 against UCLA.
Touchdown strike
So Besana came in to throw a
52-yard touchdown strike to
Walker. "Man, we've got two
great quarterbacks. I don't care
who is throwing to me, I'll catch
it," said Walker.
Walkers' performance also
bettered Steve Rivera's 205-yard
game against Stanford in the
1974 Big Game.
"Walker is the best receiver
we've faced this year," said
Spartan coach Lynn Stiles, "and
Gal was the best team we've
faced this year."
But San Jose State hasn't faced
UCLA. The Bruins, undefeated
after four games, are the class of
the conference. Stanford will try
to break that streak next Satur
day night in the Los Angeles Col
iseum.
Bruin blood
Ohio State coach Woody
Hayes was out for blood — the
Bruins' — when UCLA came to
Columbus Saturday for the ABC
Game-of-the-Week.

But with 10 seconds remain
ing in the contest the boos were
for Buckeye coach Woody Hayes
and not the Bruins, who angered
the Ohio State fans by beating
the Buckeyes in the Rose Bowl.
Hayes was jeered in the clos
ing seconds of Saturday's 10-10
tie because he refused to gamble
in the final moments of the
game.
"1 wasn't going to throw the
game away," said the conserva
tive Hayes. So the crusty Ohio
State coach ordered his Buc
keyes to punt on fourth-and-four
at the UCLA 41 -yard line with 30
seconds left in the game.
"UCLA would have been
within one good pass of a field
goal," said Hayes.
High scoring game
In Los Angeles Saturday
night, USC scored over 50 points
for the second game in a row.
Reserve quarterback Rob Hertel
threw four touchdown passes to
lead the Trojans to a 55-0 victory
over lowa.
USC tailback Ricky Bell
scored two touchdowns and
gained 119 yards on 28 carries to
stay in the Heisman Trophy race.
Bell left the game early in the
third period with USC leading
35-0.
The 55 points scored by the
Trojans gave them 154 for the
season, second only to Michigan
with 192.
Up in Seattle, Huskie rushers
had a field day, as Washington
handed Minnesota its first loss
30-7. Fullback Robin Earl rushed
for 112 yards and two
touchdowns. Washington tail
back Ronnie Rowland had a
155-yard day and also scored a

touchdown.
Oregon recovers
Oregon recovered from a 51-0
loss to USC last week by scoring
the first two times it touched the
ball to beat Utah State 27-9.
Washington State won its first
game and the "Battle of the
Palouse," as the Cougars routed
Idaho 45-6. Quarterback Jack
Thompson fired three
touchdowns, two to split end
Mike Levenseller and one to
flanker Brian Kelley.
Oregon State gave Syracuse its
first win of the season. Syracuse
quarterback Earl Vaughn raced
63 yards in the final period to
lead the Orangemen to a 21-3
win over the Beavers.
Berkeley — California wide
receiver Wesley Walker could
hardly breathe.He stood in his
Memorial Stadium dressing
room cubicle surrounded by re
porters.
Walker had just completed the
best pass receiving performance
in Pacific-8 history. The senior
speed burner caught eight pas
ses for 289 yards and three
touchdowns, to lead the Golden
Bears to a 43-16 win over San
Jose State.
And he set up another Cal
touchdown with a 35-yard jaunt
on a reverse. On that run he
made six Spartan defenders

tackle each other. That's what
San Jose did al 1 day because their
defensive backs certainly
couldn't tackle him. The Spartan
defenders seemed as if they were
stuck in the mud which made
the Memorial Stadium field look
like the Bay mud flats.

So Besana came in to throw a
52-yard touchdown strike to
Walker. "Man, we've got two
great quarterbacks. I don't care
who is throwing to me, I'll catch
it," said Walker.
Walkers' performance also
bettered Steve Rivera's 205-yard
game against Stanford in the
1974 Big Game.
"Walker is the best receiver
we've faced this year," said
Spartan coach Lynn Stiles, "and
Gal was the best team we've
faced this year."
But San Jose State hasn't faced
UCLA. The Bruins, undefeated
after four games, are the class of
the conference. Stanford will try
to break that streak next Satur
day night in the Los Angeles Col
iseum.
Bruin blood
Ohio State coach Woody
Hayes was out for blood — the
Bruins' — when UCLA came to
Columbus Saturday for the ABC
Game-of-the-Week.

But with 10 seconds remain
ing in the contest the boos were
for Buckeye coach Woody Hayes
and not the Bruins, who angered
the Ohio State fans by beating
the Buckeyes in the Rose Bowl.
Hayes was jeered in the clos
ing seconds of Saturday's 10-10
tie because he refused to gamble
in the final moments of the
game.
"1 wasn't going to throw the
game away," said the conserva
tive Hayes. So the crusty Ohio
State coach ordered his Buc
keyes to punt on fourth-and-four
at the UCLA 41 -yard line with 30
seconds left in the game.
"UCLA would have been
within one good pass of a field
goal," said Hayes.
High scoring game
In Los Angeles Saturday
night, USC scored over 50 points
for the second game in a row.
Reserve quarterback Rob Hertel
threw four touchdown passes to
lead the Trojans to a 55-0 victory
over lowa.
USC tailback Ricky Bell
scored two touchdowns and
gained 119 yards on 28 carries to
stay in the Heisman Trophy race.
Bell left the game early in the
third period with USC leading
35-0.
The 55 points scored by the
Trojans gave them 154 for the
season, second only to Michigan
with 192.
Up in Seattle, Huskie rushers
had a field day, as Washington
handed Minnesota its first loss
30-7. Fullback Robin Earl rushed
for 112 yards and two
touchdowns. Washington tail
back Ronnie Rowland had a
155-yard day and also scored a

touchdown.
Oregon recovers
Oregon recovered from a 51-0
loss to USC last week by scoring
the first two times it touched the
ball to beat Utah State 27-9.
Washington State won its first
game and the "Battle of the
Palouse," as the Cougars routed
Idaho 45-6. Quarterback Jack
Thompson fired three
touchdowns, two to split end
Mike Levenseller and one to
flanker Brian Kelley.
Oregon State gave Syracuse its
first win of the season. Syracuse
quarterback Earl Vaughn raced
63 yards in the final period to
lead the Orangemen to a 21-3
win over the Beavers.
Berkeley — California wide
receiver Wesley Walker could
hardly breathe.He stood in his
Memorial Stadium dressing
room cubicle surrounded by re
porters.
Walker had just completed the
best pass receiving performance
in Pacific-8 history. The senior
speed burner caught eight pas
ses for 289 yards and three
touchdowns, to lead the Golden
Bears to a 43-16 win over San
Jose State.
And he set up another Cal
touchdown with a 35-yard jaunt
on a reverse. On that run he
made six Spartan defenders

tackle each other. That's what
San Jose did al 1 day because their
defensive backs certainly
couldn't tackle him. The Spartan
defenders seemed as if they were
stuck in the mud which made
the Memorial Stadium field look
like the Bay mud flats.
'Happy day'
"This is a happy day in my
life," said Walker. "But I'm re
ally happier for (Cal reserve
quarterback) Fred Besana." Be
sana came in on Cal's fourth of
fensive possession of the game
and threw a 75-yard scoring
strike to Walker on his second
play.
Besana, who completed the

two passes he threw for 123
yards and two touchdowns,
came into the game after starting
Golden Bear quarterback Joe
Roth had thrown his first of two
interceptions.
"We had told Fred he was
going to play the fourth series of
the game," said Golden Bear
coach Mike White. "It wasn't be
cause we were not pleased with
Roth. We just wanted Fred to get
some game experience."
Walker needed 16 yards late in
the fourth quarter, with the Bears
leading 29-10, to break
Washington split end Dave Wil
liams' 257-yard performance set
in 1965 against UCLA.
