# John Robinson diversifies Trojan offense
## USC aims for balanced attack 
### Chris Baker 
Los Angeles— First-year USC
football coach John Robinson
was blowing smoke rings with
his cigar as he discussed his up
coming rookie season with the
touring Pacific-8 skywriters last
month.
Robinson, who served as an
Oakland Raiders' assistant last
year, sounded like his Trojans
were shooting for a Jan. 16 Rose
Bowl date (Super Bowl Sunday),
instead of New Year's Day.
"Do you have any weaknes
ses? " a sportswriter asked.
"Yes," Robinson replied, "I'm a
little overweight."
Last year, as the winningest
coach in USC history, John
McKay didn't have to worry
about getting fat from attending
too many post season football
banquets. When you lose four
consecutive games the invita
tions don't exactly pour in.
Legendary coach
But it's hard to replace a
legendary coach in Los Angeles.
Just ask Gene Bartow, who was
sharply criticized when his
UCLA basketball team didn't
win the NCAA title last season.
Robinson inherited a USC at
tack which relied uponHeisman
Trophy candidate Ricky Bell for
50 per cent of its total offense last
year.
Giving the ball to a tailback
who led the nation in rushing,
with the second highest total in

NCAA history, is good football.
But when defenders put 11-man
coverage on Bell, and you can't
switch to your passing attack to
compensate, then it's bad toot
ball.
"The best offensive teams
we've had at USC have been ba
lanced," said Robinson. "That's
what we're aiming for. But it's a
scary thing. You can be good at
both and be very average."
USC, a school where winning
is as ordinary as smog, was a
very average football team last
year. After winning their first
seven games, the Trojans lost
four Pac-8 games. USC still came
out to best sixth-ranked Texas
A&M in the Liberty Bowl.
Quarterback problems
A lot of Trojan fans blamed
quarterback Vince Evans for
USC's poor season. The senior
quarterback would have had
trouble hitting the Grand Ca
nyon last year. He connected on
35 of 112 passes for 695 yards.
So Robinson lured Paul Hac
kett, who coached All-American
quarterback Steve Bartkowski
and Joe Roth at California, to
help improve Evans' 31 per cent
passing statistic.
In three games this season,
Evans has brought his passing
percentage to .667. He has hit on
32 of 48 passes for 429 yards. Not
exactly Jim Plunkett, but it'll do.
"Most of your successful quar
terbacks are guys that have been

failures," said Robinson. "You
have to know what losing
means."
Bell, who is locked in a battle
for the Heisman Trophy with
Pittsburgh tailback Tony Dor
sett, is the kingpin of the USC
offense. Bell, who rushed for
1875 yards last year, just six
yards short of Cornell running
back Marinaro's all-time NCAA
rushing mark, finished third in
the Heisman race last year.
"Marvin Powell (USC's All-
Coast offensive guard) is just as
much a Heisman Trophy candi
date as me," said Bell. "I really
don't care about winning it,"
said Bell. "My goal is the Rose
Bowl and possibly a national
championship."
Pro talent
Pro football scouts, working
on the assumption that there will
be a pro draft next year, have said
USC will have at least six first
round draft choices.
The Trojan backfield is
loaded. Fullback Dave Farmer,
who enabled Bell to put together
a 200-yard game in the season
opener last year, returns for
another year. Farmer was
granted an extra year of eligibil
ity by the Pac-8 because he
played only two games before
going out with a knee injury.
Mosi Tatupo, the second most
valuable USC offensive player
behind Bell last year, backs up
Farmer. Tatupo was the Trojans'
second leading rusher with 425
yards last year.
'Coke machine'
"Mosi is the best blocking
back at USC since Sam Cunnin
gham," said Robinson. "Tackl
ing Mosi is like trying to tackle a
Coke machine."
The Trojans should have used
a hospital plane to fly to their
away games last year. In 1975 the
Trojans lost 14 starters for at
least one game.
At split end, the Trojans have
Randy Simmrin, who managed
to catch at least one pass in every
game, a remarkable achievement
on a team which completed only
35 per cent of it passes.
USC has always had a big of
fensive line but this year it's
massive. The Trojan line aver
ages over 255 pounds. Robinson
said, "Marvin Powell is the best
offensive tackle in America."
Powell, a second team All-
American last year, said he will

trade any honors that may come
his way for a Rose Bowl.
'Great defense'
"We could have a great de
fense," said Robinson. The Tro
jans have shut out their oppo
nents the last two weeks. "But
it's very important that we have a
great defense early in the sea
son."
The Trojans, who lost to Stan
ford 13-10 on Mike Langford's
37-yard field goal, look like the
only team that can stop UCLA
from its second straight Rose
Bowl appearance.
"We have a great tradition
here at USC," said Robinson.
"We want to continue it."

seven games, the Trojans lost
four Pac-8 games. USC still came
out to best sixth-ranked Texas
A&M in the Liberty Bowl.
Quarterback problems
A lot of Trojan fans blamed
quarterback Vince Evans for
USC's poor season. The senior
quarterback would have had
trouble hitting the Grand Ca
nyon last year. He connected on
35 of 112 passes for 695 yards.
So Robinson lured Paul Hac
kett, who coached All-American
quarterback Steve Bartkowski
and Joe Roth at California, to
help improve Evans' 31 per cent
passing statistic.
In three games this season,
Evans has brought his passing
percentage to .667. He has hit on
32 of 48 passes for 429 yards. Not
exactly Jim Plunkett, but it'll do.
"Most of your successful quar
terbacks are guys that have been

failures," said Robinson. "You
have to know what losing
means."
Bell, who is locked in a battle
for the Heisman Trophy with
Pittsburgh tailback Tony Dor
sett, is the kingpin of the USC
offense. Bell, who rushed for
1875 yards last year, just six
yards short of Cornell running
back Marinaro's all-time NCAA
rushing mark, finished third in
the Heisman race last year.
"Marvin Powell (USC's All-
Coast offensive guard) is just as
much a Heisman Trophy candi
date as me," said Bell. "I really
don't care about winning it,"
said Bell. "My goal is the Rose
Bowl and possibly a national
championship."
Pro talent
Pro football scouts, working
on the assumption that there will
be a pro draft next year, have said
USC will have at least six first
round draft choices.
The Trojan backfield is
loaded. Fullback Dave Farmer,
who enabled Bell to put together
a 200-yard game in the season
opener last year, returns for
another year. Farmer was
granted an extra year of eligibil
ity by the Pac-8 because he
played only two games before
going out with a knee injury.
Mosi Tatupo, the second most
valuable USC offensive player
behind Bell last year, backs up
Farmer. Tatupo was the Trojans'
second leading rusher with 425
yards last year.
'Coke machine'
"Mosi is the best blocking
back at USC since Sam Cunnin
gham," said Robinson. "Tackl
ing Mosi is like trying to tackle a
Coke machine."
The Trojans should have used
a hospital plane to fly to their
away games last year. In 1975 the
Trojans lost 14 starters for at
least one game.
At split end, the Trojans have
Randy Simmrin, who managed
to catch at least one pass in every
game, a remarkable achievement
on a team which completed only
35 per cent of it passes.
USC has always had a big of
fensive line but this year it's
massive. The Trojan line aver
ages over 255 pounds. Robinson
said, "Marvin Powell is the best
offensive tackle in America."
Powell, a second team All-
American last year, said he will

trade any honors that may come
his way for a Rose Bowl.
'Great defense'
"We could have a great de
fense," said Robinson. The Tro
jans have shut out their oppo
nents the last two weeks. "But
it's very important that we have a
great defense early in the sea
son."
The Trojans, who lost to Stan
ford 13-10 on Mike Langford's
37-yard field goal, look like the
only team that can stop UCLA
from its second straight Rose
Bowl appearance.
"We have a great tradition
here at USC," said Robinson.
"We want to continue it."

Los Angeles— First-year USC
football coach John Robinson
was blowing smoke rings with
his cigar as he discussed his up
coming rookie season with the
touring Pacific-8 skywriters last
month.
Robinson, who served as an
Oakland Raiders' assistant last
year, sounded like his Trojans
were shooting for a Jan. 16 Rose
Bowl date (Super Bowl Sunday),
instead of New Year's Day.
"Do you have any weaknes
ses? " a sportswriter asked.
"Yes," Robinson replied, "I'm a
little overweight."
Last year, as the winningest
coach in USC history, John
McKay didn't have to worry
about getting fat from attending
too many post season football
banquets. When you lose four
consecutive games the invita
tions don't exactly pour in.
Legendary coach
But it's hard to replace a
legendary coach in Los Angeles.
Just ask Gene Bartow, who was
sharply criticized when his
UCLA basketball team didn't
win the NCAA title last season.
Robinson inherited a USC at
tack which relied uponHeisman
Trophy candidate Ricky Bell for
50 per cent of its total offense last
year.
Giving the ball to a tailback
who led the nation in rushing,
with the second highest total in

NCAA history, is good football.
But when defenders put 11-man
coverage on Bell, and you can't
switch to your passing attack to
compensate, then it's bad toot
ball.
"The best offensive teams
we've had at USC have been ba
lanced," said Robinson. "That's
what we're aiming for. But it's a
scary thing. You can be good at
both and be very average."
USC, a school where winning
is as ordinary as smog, was a
very average football team last
year. After winning their first
seven games, the Trojans lost
four Pac-8 games. USC still came

who enabled Bell to put together
a 200-yard game in the season
opener last year, returns for
another year. Farmer was
granted an extra year of eligibil
ity by the Pac-8 because he
played only two games before
going out with a knee injury.
Mosi Tatupo, the second most
valuable USC offensive player
behind Bell last year, backs up
Farmer. Tatupo was the Trojans'
second leading rusher with 425
yards last year.
'Coke machine'
"Mosi is the best blocking
back at USC since Sam Cunnin
gham," said Robinson. "Tackl
ing Mosi is like trying to tackle a
Coke machine."
The Trojans should have used
a hospital plane to fly to their
away games last year. In 1975 the
Trojans lost 14 starters for at
least one game.
At split end, the Trojans have
Randy Simmrin, who managed
to catch at least one pass in every
game, a remarkable achievement
on a team which completed only
35 per cent of it passes.
USC has always had a big of
fensive line but this year it's
massive. The Trojan line aver
ages over 255 pounds. Robinson
said, "Marvin Powell is the best
offensive tackle in America."
Powell, a second team All-
American last year, said he will

trade any honors that may come
his way for a Rose Bowl.
'Great defense'
"We could have a great de
fense," said Robinson. The Tro
jans have shut out their oppo
nents the last two weeks. "But
it's very important that we have a
great defense early in the sea
son."
The Trojans, who lost to Stan
ford 13-10 on Mike Langford's
37-yard field goal, look like the
only team that can stop UCLA
from its second straight Rose
Bowl appearance.
"We have a great tradition
here at USC," said Robinson.
"We want to continue it."

Los Angeles— First-year USC
football coach John Robinson
was blowing smoke rings with
his cigar as he discussed his up
coming rookie season with the
touring Pacific-8 skywriters last
month.
Robinson, who served as an
Oakland Raiders' assistant last
year, sounded like his Trojans
were shooting for a Jan. 16 Rose
Bowl date (Super Bowl Sunday),
instead of New Year's Day.
"Do you have any weaknes
ses? " a sportswriter asked.
"Yes," Robinson replied, "I'm a
little overweight."
Last year, as the winningest
coach in USC history, John
McKay didn't have to worry
about getting fat from attending
too many post season football
banquets. When you lose four
consecutive games the invita
tions don't exactly pour in.
Legendary coach
But it's hard to replace a
legendary coach in Los Angeles.
Just ask Gene Bartow, who was
sharply criticized when his
UCLA basketball team didn't
win the NCAA title last season.
Robinson inherited a USC at
tack which relied uponHeisman
Trophy candidate Ricky Bell for
50 per cent of its total offense last
year.
Giving the ball to a tailback
who led the nation in rushing,
with the second highest total in

NCAA history, is good football.
But when defenders put 11-man
coverage on Bell, and you can't
switch to your passing attack to
compensate, then it's bad toot
ball.
"The best offensive teams
we've had at USC have been ba
lanced," said Robinson. "That's
what we're aiming for. But it's a
scary thing. You can be good at
both and be very average."
USC, a school where winning
is as ordinary as smog, was a
very average football team last
year. After winning their first
seven games, the Trojans lost
four Pac-8 games. USC still came
out to best sixth-ranked Texas
A&M in the Liberty Bowl.
Quarterback problems
A lot of Trojan fans blamed
quarterback Vince Evans for
USC's poor season. The senior
quarterback would have had
trouble hitting the Grand Ca
nyon last year. He connected on
35 of 112 passes for 695 yards.
So Robinson lured Paul Hac
kett, who coached All-American
quarterback Steve Bartkowski
and Joe Roth at California, to
help improve Evans' 31 per cent
passing statistic.
In three games this season,
Evans has brought his passing
percentage to .667. He has hit on
32 of 48 passes for 429 yards. Not
exactly Jim Plunkett, but it'll do.
"Most of your successful quar
terbacks are guys that have been

failures," said Robinson. "You
have to know what losing
means."
Bell, who is locked in a battle
for the Heisman Trophy with
Pittsburgh tailback Tony Dor
sett, is the kingpin of the USC
offense. Bell, who rushed for
1875 yards last year, just six
yards short of Cornell running
back Marinaro's all-time NCAA
rushing mark, finished third in
the Heisman race last year.
"Marvin Powell (USC's All-
Coast offensive guard) is just as
much a Heisman Trophy candi
date as me," said Bell. "I really
don't care about winning it,"
said Bell. "My goal is the Rose
Bowl and possibly a national
championship."
Pro talent
Pro football scouts, working
on the assumption that there will
be a pro draft next year, have said
USC will have at least six first
round draft choices.
The Trojan backfield is
loaded. Fullback Dave Farmer,
who enabled Bell to put together
a 200-yard game in the season
opener last year, returns for
