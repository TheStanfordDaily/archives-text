# Group seeks new Phi Psi chapter
## 
### Sean Murphy 
Phi kappa Psi, a fraternity that had
been active here since 1897 but faded
away over the last three years due to a
lack of interest, may be active again
next year.
Two national field consultants for
Phi Kappa Psi, Guy Minardi and Tom
Kramer, are here to drum up interest in
getting the fraternity restarted. They
are contacting students here who have
been suggested by alumni and stu
dents in other chapters. Minardi and
Kramer also mentioned that they
would be running an ad in the Daily,
and that they would be manning a desk
in White Plaza.
Minardi pointed out that Phi Kappa
Psi had a good chance of being reacti
vated because of its alumni and char
ter.
The fraternity's charter of 1897 is
still in effect so that the fraternity still
exists as far as the university is con
cerned. Also, over 900 alumni in the
Bay Area would be able to help reacti
vate the Stanford chapter, Minardi
said.
Kramer said that their primary pur
pose now was to recruit members. He
said that moving back into the house
the fraternity once occupied at 550 San

Juan was a long range goal, hut it was
much more important who was in the
fraternity than where it was.
Minardi expressed concern over
whether the fraternity could find space
here due to the housing shortage.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of
student affairs, said that another
fraternity would not have a major ef
fect on the campus housing situation.
"The house that the fraternity oc
cupied would switch from the draw
system to the fraternity system; if you
wanted to live in that particular house
you would have to be selected by the
fraternity."
Karen Murray at the Row House Of
fice said that Minardi and Kramer had
informed her of their activities here.
She said that she told them that the
university would be looking for a show
of sustained interest by those students
who wanted to reactivate Phi Kappa
Psi.
Robinson noted that in the last 10
years the number of fraternities had
almost been halved. 1 le said that where
there were once 24 all-male fraternities
on campus, there are now lf>. two of
which are coed, and one of which is off
campus this year.
