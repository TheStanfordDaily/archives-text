# NorCal tournament
## Cal beats poloists, 4-3 
### Chris Kamel 
Stanford's water polo team,
still not playing up to NCAA
championship form, lost the
championship game of the Nor-
Cal water polo tournament to de
fending NCAA champion
California Saturday at De Anza,
4-3.
The Cards won the tourna
ment last year with a victory over
the Golden Bears.
The Cards' critical mistakes in
the second half allowed Cal to
jump out to a 4-2 lead and the
Golden Bears managed to hang
on later when Stanford made one
last futile run to repeat as tour
nament champs.
"They just played better than
we did today," said Card water
polo coach Art Lambert, whose
squad had nothing but shooting
practice in reaching the finals.
Stanford eliminated Orange

Coast, San Jose State and He
Anza by the lopsided scores of
17-1, 18-0 and 11-2, respec
tively.
Early lead
The Cards, ahead 1-0 early in the
first period, displayed a haras
sing defense which was most
aptly illustrated when Stanford
stopped the Bear offense with
Cal having a man-advantage.
Cal managed to slip two goals
past Card goalie Chris Dorst,
however, and went ahead for
goodat 3-2 at the 3:42 mark of the
second quarter. The Bears got yet
another goal before the halftime
buzzer when they chalked up
another goal with nine seconds
left.
During halftime, Lambert
urged the Cards not to get

sloppy, but at times Stanford
seemed to forget his advice.
Erratic offense
With five minutes to go in the
fourth quarter, the Cards pulled
to within a goal on a Marty Davis
lob shot from teammate Paul
Clark. The Cards' errant passes
and seemingly erratic offense in
the second half, however, stop
ped them from repeating as
tournament champs.
Three times in the final half,
Stanford failed to get a shot off
before the 45-second shooting
buzzer sounded. Several dull
passes were intercepted by Cal,
culminating with an overthrown
lob pass by the Cards which was
intercepted with 15 seconds re
maining in the game.
Both coaches blasted a new
rule which allows a penalty shot
after 10 fouls are accumulated.
"I think that damn ruleshould
be done away with," said Cal
coach Peter Cutino. "It totally
takes away the offense of a fine
team like Stanford or Cal."
New rule
Lambert was more upset by
the new rule because it cost the
Cards the tying goal in the game.
With 1:45 left in the third quar
ter, Cal committed its tenth team
foul. Stanford was robbed of a
score, however, when the Cal
goalie got a hand on Davis' pen
alty try and deflected the shot
wide of the goal.
The Cal coach had a lot of
praise for Stanford, which will
meet his Bears twice during the
season.
"They are definitely a much
improved team as I anticipated,"
Cutino said. "I am just glad that
we played six and not seven mi
nute quarters," he added, refer
ring to the Cards' superior condi
tioning.
"Unfortunately, this will not
be the last time we will play
Stanford," Cutino said.

foul. Stanford was robbed of a
score, however, when the Cal
goalie got a hand on Davis' pen
alty try and deflected the shot
wide of the goal.
The Cal coach had a lot of
praise for Stanford, which will
meet his Bears twice during the
season.
"They are definitely a much
improved team as I anticipated,"
Cutino said. "I am just glad that
we played six and not seven mi
nute quarters," he added, refer
ring to the Cards' superior condi
tioning.
"Unfortunately, this will not
be the last time we will play
Stanford," Cutino said.
Stanford's water polo team,
still not playing up to NCAA
championship form, lost the
championship game of the Nor-
Cal water polo tournament to de
fending NCAA champion
California Saturday at De Anza,
4-3.
The Cards won the tourna
ment last year with a victory over
the Golden Bears.
The Cards' critical mistakes in
the second half allowed Cal to
jump out to a 4-2 lead and the
Golden Bears managed to hang
on later when Stanford made one
last futile run to repeat as tour
nament champs.
"They just played better than
we did today," said Card water
polo coach Art Lambert, whose
squad had nothing but shooting
practice in reaching the finals.
Stanford eliminated Orange

Coast, San Jose State and He
Anza by the lopsided scores of
17-1, 18-0 and 11-2, respec
tively.
Early lead
The Cards, ahead 1-0 early in the
first period, displayed a haras
sing defense which was most
aptly illustrated when Stanford
stopped the Bear offense with
Cal having a man-advantage.
Cal managed to slip two goals
past Card goalie Chris Dorst,
however, and went ahead for
goodat 3-2 at the 3:42 mark of the
second quarter. The Bears got yet
another goal before the halftime
buzzer when they chalked up
another goal with nine seconds
left.
During halftime, Lambert
urged the Cards not to get

sloppy, but at times Stanford
seemed to forget his advice.
Erratic offense
With five minutes to go in the
fourth quarter, the Cards pulled
to within a goal on a Marty Davis
lob shot from teammate Paul
Clark. The Cards' errant passes
and seemingly erratic offense in
the second half, however, stop
ped them from repeating as
tournament champs.
Three times in the final half,
Stanford failed to get a shot off
before the 45-second shooting
buzzer sounded. Several dull
passes were intercepted by Cal,
culminating with an overthrown
lob pass by the Cards which was
intercepted with 15 seconds re
maining in the game.
Both coaches blasted a new
rule which allows a penalty shot
after 10 fouls are accumulated.
"I think that damn ruleshould
be done away with," said Cal
coach Peter Cutino. "It totally
takes away the offense of a fine
team like Stanford or Cal."
New rule
Lambert was more upset by
the new rule because it cost the
Cards the tying goal in the game.
With 1:45 left in the third quar
ter, Cal committed its tenth team
foul. Stanford was robbed of a
score, however, when the Cal
goalie got a hand on Davis' pen
alty try and deflected the shot
wide of the goal.
