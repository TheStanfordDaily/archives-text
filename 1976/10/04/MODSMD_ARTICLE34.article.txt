# Card booters give away game
## 
### John Murao 
In any rebuilding year you ex
pect to lose a few games. But
first-year Stanford soccer coach
Nelson Lodge doesn't expect to
give away games.
And that's exactly what hap
pened Saturday afternoon at
Harry Maloney field, when the
Cards lost to Pomona College,
2-1.
Stanford is a young team and
Saturday, the Cards made youth
ful errors. Against Pomona,
Stanford learned a valuable les
son: a soccer match lasts more
than 45 minutes.
The Cards went ahead 1-0
when Steve Arnold took a throw
in near the Pomona goal and
fired a pass to Skip Pfeiffer who
scored an uncontested goal.
But in the second half Stan
ford missed several scoring op
portunities and Pomona
capitalized on two scoring op
portunities to go ahead for good
at 2-1. The best Card chance
was when Bobby Geiger missed
a penalty shot.

"Losing to these guys is a lot
different than losing to San Jose
or San Francisco," said Lodge.
"It's worse because we gave it
away."
Geiger, the Card co-captain,
did provide the crowd with
some exciting moments, with a
couple runs through the Pomona
defense. Substitute Larry Fis
chman came in to provide some
solid play at mid-field.
And with each game it be
comes clearer than Jimmy
Melamed is a mainstay of the
Stanford defense.
Stanford will have a heavy
schedule this week. Tomorrow
the Cards take on Sacramento
State on Harry Maloney field at 3
p.m.. Thursday Stanford travels
to Hawyard State for a 3 p.m.
match.
