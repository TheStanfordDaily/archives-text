Carter prepares for debate; Butz blasted
Plains, Ga. — Jimmy Carter conferred for nearly four
hours yesterday with former Defense Secretary James
Schlesinger in advance of Carter's upcoming debate on
foreign policy and defense with President Gerald Ford.
Schlesinger was fired by Ford last year as a result of
differences between them over policies concerning na
tional defense and detente.
Meanwhile, Carter's press secretary, Jody Powell, said
Ford is demonstrating a lack of leadership by letting the
fate of Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz depend on the
political effect of racial slurs he is quoted as having made.
"The president's decision on whether or not to ask for
Mr. Butz' resignation appears not to be based on whether
that resignation would be right but on what the polls show
and on what the political reaction is," Powell said.
Ford has reprimanded Butz, but White House Press
Secretary Ron Nessen said yesterday he had nothing new
to report concerning the But/, affair. He denied reports that
President Ford had imposed a 48-hour waiting period to
gauge public reaction before deciding what to do.
Arabs riot at tomb of Abraham
Tel Aviv — Just hours before Jews began the celebration
of Yom Kippur yesterday, a group of Arabs broke into a
synagogue at the tomb of Abraham in occupied Hebron
and tore apart furnishings and the holy books and scrolls
inside, military officials said.
The sources said a force of more than 100 Arabs over
whelmed guards at the entrance of the cave before dawn
prayers, ripped up several Torahs, or scrolls of Jewish law,
and prayer books and scattered them around the cave.
Furniture was gutted and the intricately woven curtains
and coverings inside were torn to shreds.
The destruction of the synagogue's contents was com
plete, tho sources said.
The government clamped a tight curfew on the West
Bank city of 39,000 Arabs. Angry Jews congregated out
side the Moslem mosque which covers the tomb to de
mand action from the government and to ensure access to
the site for Jews during Yom Kippur.
Ford-UAW negotiations slow down
Detroit — Hopes for a weekend contract settlement in
the 19-day-old P'ord Motor Co. strike faded yesterday as
the pace slowed in negotiations between the company and
the United Auto Workers (IJAW).
"We're getting a little closer together, but we're still
apart and still have a lot of work to do," said Mikeßinaldi,
chairman of the 15-member UAW bargaining team.
One source close to the talks said the two sides did not
hold any formal meetings yesterday but spent the entire
day and evening meeting among themselves. He said he
expected the two sides to recess until Monday morning
rather than meet around the clock.
The UAW and Ford officials are working to create a
pattern-setting agreement that will provide the basis of
new pacts covering 700,000 auto workers at the four major
U.S. car producers.
