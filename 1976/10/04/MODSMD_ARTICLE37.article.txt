Misplaced tape found
A magnetic computer tape containing highly sensitive
university salary and personnel data was apparently mis
placed at the Encina Hall computation center during the
past week, according to Michael Roberts, deputy director
of the Stanford Center for Information Processing.
The tape, which was first noticed as missing last Mon
day. was found yesterday evening in the Encina machine
room. However, the tape was not where it logically should
have been, explained Roberts.
"We don't know if it was there all week," said Roberts,
as a thorough search last week of the Encina center failed
to locate the tape.
The tape, which includes information on all employes
except those at the Stanford Hospital, is a master file used
for analytical projects, including the preparation of stan
dard reports, the monitoring of affirmative action and
hiring patterns, and job classification studies, Roberts
said.
The Stanford Department of Public Safety was called in
to investigate last week.
Correction
Enrollment at Stanford-In-Berlin last year, described as
low in a story in Thursday's Daily should be clarified.
Winter quarter enrollment was 26 and enrollment in
spring quarter was 38 for the program which is intended to
accommodate 25 students, according to Mark Mancall,
director of overseas studies.
Mancall also noted that the program will definitely con
tinue in Berlin and that students who fulfill the language
requirement can still be accommodated winter and/or
spring quarters.
