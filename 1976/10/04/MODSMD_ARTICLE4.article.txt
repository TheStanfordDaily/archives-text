A study group of 1H Stanford trus
tees, faculty and alumni will be arriv
ing in Peking on October 15, Provost
William Miller said yesterday-
Arrangements were made privately
by the Stanford U.S.-China Relations
Program, an organization whose pur
pose is "to facilitate the mutual ex
change of cultural, scientific and tech
nical study groups," according to Mil
ler, head of the group.
"All the people in the group are
either active in support of the program,
or involved in some aspect of Si no-
American relations," explained Mil

ler.
"First contact (with Chinese offi
cials) was made some months ago,"
said Miller, "and the trip was recon
firmed last week when we were
notified of a change in our itinerary."
After visiting Peking, the group will
procede to Nanking, Shanghai,
Kweilin and Kwangchou, returning on
November 2.
While in the People's Republic of
China, the group hopes to tour educa
tional institutions, medical facilities,
museums and industrial and agricul
tural areas. "We also hope to do some
sightseeing," Miller said.
