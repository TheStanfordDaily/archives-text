# Black politicians urge concerned consistuency
## Young urges voter registration 
### Jacob Young Mark Funk 
A small knot of children had gathered on an East Palo
Alto street corner Saturday afternoon, attracted by the
blare of a load speaker urging residents to "raise your
hand if you are registered to vote," the madly honking
horns of a dozen Datsun 280Zs and the spinning lights
of four San Mateo County Sheriff cars.
"Who got married?" a little girl shouted as the pro
cession snaked its way slowly through a side street.
"Nobody," a rider in one of the cars said. "This is a
rally for Congressman Andrew Young and voter regist
ration."
"Well," the little girl persisted. "Is HE married?"
For the record, the Atlanta congressman is married.
Young is also the highest ranking black in Democratic
presidential candidate Jimmy Carter's campaign and a
top domestic adviser to the former Ceorgia governor.
'The name of the game'
And he has been charged with spearheading voter
registration drives in minority communities, an effort
on which Carter operatives place much emphasis.
Young's visit to East Palo Alto was sponsored by a
group called, "Politics is the Name of the Came," a
group organized to ". . . bring together a variety of can
didates and groups to form a solid base," according to
I.arry Creene, the organizer of Saturday's motorcade
and rally at the Ravenswood Community Center.
According to Greene, there are only about 2100 per

sons registered to vote in East Palo Alto, and the pur
pose of the current drive is to "double the number of
registered voters," Greene said.
Old-style politics
Most of this conversation went on in Greene's pickup
truck as it snaked through the streets of East Palo Alto.
He raced ahead of the motorcade, helping to block
intersections and pass out campaign literature. The
scene was definitely old-style politics, with Young and
Democratic congressional hopeful David Harris riding
in a large convertible, waving to the clusters of people
who gathered along the way.
As the motorcade neared the end of the route, Greene
pointed out that the group has had problems in getting
many members of the community to participate in the
"practical politics" which has become the watchword
of recent years. "You have to wake people up to get
their attention," Greene said.
And wake them up is exactly what Young proceeded
to do as he alternately entertained and challenged the
Ravenswood audience of some 100 persons with a mix
ture of gospel-stvle dialogue and hard political reality.
Challenge to participate
Young, a Democrat from Georgia's sth Congressional
district, began the rally with a speech in which he
challenged blacks to register to vote and to actively
participate in the political system.
Using his own Atlanta-area district as an example,
