# Bond charges government neglect
## 
### Karen Caesar Dave Woodard 
Observing Julian Bond in an informal setting, one
probably would not connect the gentle face and re
served manner with the fiery state senator who has
fought tenaciously for human rights.
But when the state senator from Georgia addressed
the Stanford Mid-F'eninsula Urban Coalition, the fire
resurfaced in his eloquent and enthusiastic demand for
the betterment of black people.
Bond assessed and criticized the present attitude of
the federal government toward poor people, saying it
has regressed from one of "benign concern" to one of
"malignant neglect."
Noting a 60 per cent national pullback in social ser
vices. Bond declared that "human problems are now
placed on a balance sheet and forced to add up and
yield profits.
"In the last five years," Bond continued, "the reins
have been seized by the callous, the comfortable and
the smug, who have closed their hearts, their minds
and their ranks ... to the needs of the needy."
Only a beginning
Bond said the "massive political movement" in the
sixties did not even begin to solve the economic and
vocational problems of today's black.
"The sixties movement became a peculiar victim of
its own success... it failed to sustain itself. Being black
became .i rhrtoricnl or sartnrir.al ar.c.nmnlishnient

said Bond.
"The bus front seat loses meaning," said Bond where
the . . mechanized high-rise poverty of tin; North has
replaced the urban poverty of the South."
'Legal apartheid' gone
According to Bond, half of all blacks in the country
today earn less than $5000 annually. They are still the
last hired and the first fired. Their infant mortality rate
is twice as high as it is for whites and the average black
man dies seven years sooner than his white counter
part.
The "legal apartheid" is gone, he maintained, yet "in
a very real way we find our condition unchanged in
1976." Bond observed an improvement in the "general
condition" of today's black Americans as opposed to
blacks of 25 years ago. but he stressed that, when com
pared to today's whites, the "relative condition has
gotten worse."
Speaking before a predominately white audience,
Bond posed the need for "a constituency of the con
cerned (people) to create new majorities."
'Testicular fortitude' lacking
His legislative proposals include a negative income
tax to supplement poor people on the margin and free
adequate health care financed by the treasury rather
than insurance companies. Bond also encourages "a
system of education that will dignify vocational as well
as academic education."
