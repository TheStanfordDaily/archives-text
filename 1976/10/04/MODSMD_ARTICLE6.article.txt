# Bond charges government neglect
## 
### Karen Caesar Dave Woodard 
Observing Julian Bond in an informal setting, one
probably would not connect the gentle face and re
served manner with the fiery state senator who has
fought tenaciously for human rights.
But when the state senator from Georgia addressed
the Stanford Mid-F'eninsula Urban Coalition, the fire
resurfaced in his eloquent and enthusiastic demand for
the betterment of black people.
Bond assessed and criticized the present attitude of
the federal government toward poor people, saying it
has regressed from one of "benign concern" to one of
"malignant neglect."
Noting a 60 per cent national pullback in social ser
vices. Bond declared that "human problems are now
placed on a balance sheet and forced to add up and
yield profits.
"In the last five years," Bond continued, "the reins
have been seized by the callous, the comfortable and
the smug, who have closed their hearts, their minds
and their ranks ... to the needs of the needy."
Only a beginning
Bond said the "massive political movement" in the
sixties did not even begin to solve the economic and
vocational problems of today's black.
"The sixties movement became a peculiar victim of
its own success... it failed to sustain itself. Being black
became .i rhrtoricnl or sartnrir.al ar.c.nmnlishnient

said Bond.
"The bus front seat loses meaning," said Bond where
the . . mechanized high-rise poverty of tin; North has
replaced the urban poverty of the South."
'Legal apartheid' gone
According to Bond, half of all blacks in the country
today earn less than $5000 annually. They are still the
last hired and the first fired. Their infant mortality rate
is twice as high as it is for whites and the average black
man dies seven years sooner than his white counter
part.
The "legal apartheid" is gone, he maintained, yet "in
a very real way we find our condition unchanged in
1976." Bond observed an improvement in the "general
condition" of today's black Americans as opposed to
blacks of 25 years ago. but he stressed that, when com
pared to today's whites, the "relative condition has
gotten worse."
Speaking before a predominately white audience,
Bond posed the need for "a constituency of the con
cerned (people) to create new majorities."
'Testicular fortitude' lacking
His legislative proposals include a negative income
tax to supplement poor people on the margin and free
adequate health care financed by the treasury rather
than insurance companies. Bond also encourages "a
system of education that will dignify vocational as well
as academic education."
He called Congress "impotent" in its inability to
resist presidential vetoes, noted its lack of "testicular
fortitude" in its refusal to grant "a decent raise in social
security," and dismissed most of Washington's politi
cians and bureaucrats as "men with an arrogant con
tempt for people and their problems." The situation,
Bond declared, is one that "cuts cruelly at people at the
bottom, those who traditionally look to the government
for help."
As a politician — what Bond wryly termed the
world's second oldest profession — Bond said he is
proud to work "among the finest men money can buy."
He was not overly enthusiastic about either of the
two politicians vying for the presidency, dismissing
the televised debate as a bout between two "blindfold
boxers." Taking a gibe at Jimmy Carter's highly pub-

licized Playboy interview and encapsuling his glum
outlook for Election Day, Bond said the choice in
November is between "the luster and the lackluster."
A graduate of Morehouse College in Atlanta, Geor
gia, with a B.A. in English, Bond has been granted 14
honorary degrees and serves on the Board of Directors
of the National Urban Coalition, Robert F. Kennedy
Memorial Fund, Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for So
cial Change, Better Education Project, the National Ad
visory Council of the American Civil Liberties Union
and several others. He is the President of the Southern
Poverty Law Center and was recently named to Time's
200 Leaders list.
Senator Bond will be making his screen debut in a
soon-to-be-released motion picture, Greased Lightn
ing, based on the life of Wendell Scott, the first black
sports car racer.

man dies seven years sooner than his white counter
part.
The "legal apartheid" is gone, he maintained, yet "in
a very real way we find our condition unchanged in
1976." Bond observed an improvement in the "general
condition" of today's black Americans as opposed to
blacks of 25 years ago. but he stressed that, when com
pared to today's whites, the "relative condition has
gotten worse."
Speaking before a predominately white audience,
Bond posed the need for "a constituency of the con
cerned (people) to create new majorities."
'Testicular fortitude' lacking
His legislative proposals include a negative income
tax to supplement poor people on the margin and free
adequate health care financed by the treasury rather
than insurance companies. Bond also encourages "a
system of education that will dignify vocational as well
as academic education."
He called Congress "impotent" in its inability to
resist presidential vetoes, noted its lack of "testicular
fortitude" in its refusal to grant "a decent raise in social
security," and dismissed most of Washington's politi
cians and bureaucrats as "men with an arrogant con
tempt for people and their problems." The situation,
Bond declared, is one that "cuts cruelly at people at the
bottom, those who traditionally look to the government
for help."
As a politician — what Bond wryly termed the
world's second oldest profession — Bond said he is
proud to work "among the finest men money can buy."
He was not overly enthusiastic about either of the
two politicians vying for the presidency, dismissing
the televised debate as a bout between two "blindfold
boxers." Taking a gibe at Jimmy Carter's highly pub-

licized Playboy interview and encapsuling his glum
outlook for Election Day, Bond said the choice in
November is between "the luster and the lackluster."
A graduate of Morehouse College in Atlanta, Geor
gia, with a B.A. in English, Bond has been granted 14
honorary degrees and serves on the Board of Directors
of the National Urban Coalition, Robert F. Kennedy
Memorial Fund, Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for So
cial Change, Better Education Project, the National Ad
visory Council of the American Civil Liberties Union
and several others. He is the President of the Southern
Poverty Law Center and was recently named to Time's
200 Leaders list.
Senator Bond will be making his screen debut in a
soon-to-be-released motion picture, Greased Lightn
ing, based on the life of Wendell Scott, the first black
sports car racer.


Julian Bond
Julian Bond made an appearance in Palo Alto Fri
day night, and characterized the attitude of the gov-

—Daily photo by Randy Keith
ernment towards poor people as "malignant neg
lect."
Observing Julian Bond in an informal setting, one
probably would not connect the gentle face and re
served manner with the fiery state senator who has
fought tenaciously for human rights.
But when the state senator from Georgia addressed
the Stanford Mid-F'eninsula Urban Coalition, the fire
resurfaced in his eloquent and enthusiastic demand for
the betterment of black people.
Bond assessed and criticized the present attitude of
the federal government toward poor people, saying it
has regressed from one of "benign concern" to one of
"malignant neglect."
Noting a 60 per cent national pullback in social ser
vices. Bond declared that "human problems are now
placed on a balance sheet and forced to add up and
yield profits.
"In the last five years," Bond continued, "the reins
have been seized by the callous, the comfortable and
the smug, who have closed their hearts, their minds
and their ranks ... to the needs of the needy."
Only a beginning
Bond said the "massive political movement" in the
sixties did not even begin to solve the economic and
vocational problems of today's black.
"The sixties movement became a peculiar victim of
its own success... it failed to sustain itself. Being black
became .i rhrtoricnl or sartnrir.al ar.c.nmnlishnient

said Bond.
"The bus front seat loses meaning," said Bond where
the . . mechanized high-rise poverty of tin; North has
replaced the urban poverty of the South."
'Legal apartheid' gone
According to Bond, half of all blacks in the country
today earn less than $5000 annually. They are still the
last hired and the first fired. Their infant mortality rate
is twice as high as it is for whites and the average black
man dies seven years sooner than his white counter
part.
The "legal apartheid" is gone, he maintained, yet "in
a very real way we find our condition unchanged in
1976." Bond observed an improvement in the "general
