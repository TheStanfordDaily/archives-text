## An apology 
### 
On Friday, the Daily demanded that President Richard Lymar
release the full text of his rationale for reducing sentences
handed out by the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) to six students
involved in a vandalism incident last May.
In the flurry of events — including the release of that rationale
— following publication of the editorial, it came to my attention
that the editorial contained a major factual error.
The editorial stated: "Lyman's rationale is crucial. Releasing it
could not harm the defendants — their names, actions and
punishments are public. Concealing the reason for overturning
the SJC can only harm the credibility of the judicial system
here."
In July, Lyman had given Joe Mell — an attorney representing
the six defendants — the option of releasing the text. Mell had
decided to release all of it except for six lines dealing with a prior
offense by one defendant. That edited text appears in today's
Daily.
However, the summer Daily's editor, Ron Beck, informed me
and two other Daily staffers that the text was not for publication
— that he had received a copy on an "eyes-only" basis. This was
not true.
At a meeting with two Daily staffers last week, Legal Adviser
to the President James Siena still maintained that release of the
document had to be cleared through Mell. Siena explained why
he did not tell the Daily the document was already public.
"I had forgotten," Siena said. "I told him (Mell) to tell Beck
that if the Daily wanted a copy of the decision they could have it.
It might have been a failure of recollection on my part."
Friday's editorial was based on Beck's original comments,
combined with Siena's apparent confirmation last week.
We cannot and will not tolerate deception by members of our
staff. The person involved has graduated. Although he may not
have realized the full implications of his action, if he were still
here, I would have asked him to leave the staff.
Lyman has demanded an apology. I apologize first to him, but,
more importantly, to our readers, who deserve better from
Daily staff members. John Freed, editor
