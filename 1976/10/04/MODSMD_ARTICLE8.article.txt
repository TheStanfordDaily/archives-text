## Butz must go 
### 
In light of Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz' recent remarks of
a highly racist nature, we believe it is reasonable and necessary
to demand Butz' immediate resignation from his cabinet post.
The American public deserves a written apology from Secret
ary Butz for his unjustified, and in fact pejorative ethnic com
ments. This is not the first time he has voiced his racial pre
judices. We feel it should be his last as a government official.
Comments such as those Butz made cannot be tolerated from
persons who initiate or influence the formation of policies that
will affect the general public.
We had hoped President Gerald Ford would take immediate
action to fire the Secretary as soon as the derogatory remarks
were confirmed as Butz'.
If Butz does not hand in his resignation, we urge Ford to
replace him immediately.
