# USE irate on dispatch center deal

### Lonnie Rosenwald 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
has threatened legal action against the
university on behalf of four university
dispatchers who will be laid off Nov. 1
when Palo Alto takes over the univer
sity's emergency dispatch service.
Under the terms of the $300,000 per
year contract, the City of Palo Alto will
assume emergency dispatch service
for the campus, including the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center. The con
solidation of emergency dispatching
services follows the Oct. 1 merger of
campus and city fire departments.
USE President Roger Hardy said
USE is seeking either the re
employment of the four dispatchers by
the university or their hiring by Palo
Alto.
USE cites a union-university con
tract specification, which requires the
university to offer employment at
equal wages to employes laid off
through a substitution of contractual
work done on university premises, as
grounds for university re-employment
of the dispatchers.
In a Sept. 15 letter to the Palo Alto
City Council urging that Palo Alto hire
the dispatchers, Hardy stated that the
union-university contract stipulated
that, in cases where an outside con
tractor's operation on university pre
mises would result in the layoff of uni
versity employes, the university must
contractually provide for an employ
ment offer by the contractor to the laid
off workers.
The union-university contract has
since expired and negotiations are
continuing on a new contract.
Hardy said the university contends
the dispatching service will be located
in Palo Alto, not on its premises. Uni
versity officials also point out that the
dispatchers have been offered posi
tions as utility dispatchers in the tele
communications center, according to
Hardy.
However, the USE letter stated that
"the work, which is the communica
tion with Police, Fire Fighting and
Utilities personnels, will still be exe
cuted on Stanford premises."
Stanford police-fire dispatcher
Terry Longworth said only three of the
dispatchers were offered these utilities
positions, which would be at a 25 per
cent reduction in salary. They received
no formal notification of their dismis
sal and were told by the personnel of
fice to "go fill out an application" if
they wanted another job, Longworth
said.
Plant Services Director Jason Mavis,
who is the dispatchers' superior, was
unavailable for comment.
In the recent merger between the
Mountain View and Palo Alto dis
patching services, seven of nine
Mountain View dispatchers were
given employment by Palo Alto.
Hardy also urged Palo Alto to hire at
least two of the dispatchers at the Sept.
22 meeting of the city council's Fi
nance Committee.

campus and city fire departments.
USE President Roger Hardy said
USE is seeking either the re
employment of the four dispatchers by
the university or their hiring by Palo
Alto.
USE cites a union-university con
tract specification, which requires the
university to offer employment at
equal wages to employes laid off
through a substitution of contractual
work done on university premises, as
grounds for university re-employment
of the dispatchers.
In a Sept. 15 letter to the Palo Alto
City Council urging that Palo Alto hire
the dispatchers, Hardy stated that the
union-university contract stipulated
that, in cases where an outside con
tractor's operation on university pre
mises would result in the layoff of uni
versity employes, the university must
contractually provide for an employ
ment offer by the contractor to the laid
off workers.
The union-university contract has
since expired and negotiations are
continuing on a new contract.
Hardy said the university contends
the dispatching service will be located
in Palo Alto, not on its premises. Uni
versity officials also point out that the
dispatchers have been offered posi
tions as utility dispatchers in the tele
communications center, according to
Hardy.
However, the USE letter stated that
"the work, which is the communica
tion with Police, Fire Fighting and
Utilities personnels, will still be exe
cuted on Stanford premises."
Stanford police-fire dispatcher
Terry Longworth said only three of the
dispatchers were offered these utilities
positions, which would be at a 25 per
cent reduction in salary. They received
no formal notification of their dismis
sal and were told by the personnel of
fice to "go fill out an application" if
they wanted another job, Longworth
said.
Plant Services Director Jason Mavis,
who is the dispatchers' superior, was
unavailable for comment.
In the recent merger between the
Mountain View and Palo Alto dis
patching services, seven of nine
Mountain View dispatchers were
given employment by Palo Alto.
Hardy also urged Palo Alto to hire at
least two of the dispatchers at the Sept.
22 meeting of the city council's Fi
nance Committee.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
has threatened legal action against the
university on behalf of four university
dispatchers who will be laid off Nov. 1
when Palo Alto takes over the univer
sity's emergency dispatch service.
Under the terms of the $300,000 per
year contract, the City of Palo Alto will
assume emergency dispatch service
for the campus, including the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center. The con
solidation of emergency dispatching
services follows the Oct. 1 merger of
campus and city fire departments.
