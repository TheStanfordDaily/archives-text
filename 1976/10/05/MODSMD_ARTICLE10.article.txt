# Biggest stumbling block to feminists
## 
### 
Susan Vorchheimer has asked the U.S. Supreme
Court to invalidate a Philadelphia school system
policy that forbids her admission to the city's high
school for academically superior males.
An Oklahoma State University fraternity member
has joined with the proprietor of a campus drive-in
to petition the court to strike down a state law
permitting females to buy beer at age 18, while
males must wait until age 21.
These two appeals are representative of the
nationwide attack on traditional latvs giving prefe
rential or patronizing treatment to women. The
legal assaults have come with such rapidity that
"sex has become the newfocal point of discrimina
tion cases," Oklahoma Atty. Gen. Larry Derryberry
told the Los Angeles Times.
Legal reform is as vital to the cause of feminism as
earlier court challenges (largely mounted by the
NAACP) were for the rights of black people. The
new targets include restrictive (called "protec
tive") work laws, inheritance statutes and a host of
government and industry "benefits."
Legal progress
Progress in court already has been realized. In
1973, the U.S. Supreme Court came within one
justice of adding sex to the "inherently suspect"
classification which permits easy application of the
equal protection clause.
"From the viewpoint of feminists, the Burger
court has been far superior to other (supreme)
courts," opines Columbia University Law. Prof.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Foresightful observers, however, realize that at
tainment of feminist goals of dignity and opportun
ity for women is going to require much deeper
social change than that needed to remove racial
barriers.
Specifically, economic independence and equal
ity of opportunity for women are linked inexorably
to an end to the unilateral female responsibility for
child rearing and homemaking in a household.
Little change
Wellesley Economics Prof. Carolyn Shaw Bell, in
a Social Policy magazine article last year, notes that

despite the influx of women into the work force,
"any comparative analysis of jobs held over the past
50 years shows that occupational stereotyping has
changed, overall, very little."
But Bell debunks the notion that discrimination
is responsible for the inferior status of women in the
job market. Rather, she writes, such a position re
sults from rational hiring behavior on the part of
enterprises — behavior caused by the decision of
most women to put "family life" first.

Because only a certain number of jobs fit the
temporal, locational and seasonal requirements of
women who feel responsible for handling
homemaking chores in addition to their outside
work, the labor supply is abundant for such jobs
and their wage is thus low.
In addition, Bell notes, the fact that women as a
whole spend less time in the work force than men
causes a loss of the "experience" premium in the
average female salary. And because women in gen
eral have demonstrated a desire to move in and out
of the labor force frequently, corporations have
been less willing to invest in managerial training
programs for woman than for men. The result:
worse jobs and lower pay for the average female.
'Consumer maintenance'
All of these disadvantages are traceable to the
primacy in most women's minds of what Bell calls
"consumer maintenance" work (child rearing and
other aspects of homemaking). Even many full-time
working women succumb to the consumer mainte
nance syndrome.

Indeed, even in the Soviet Union, where
equalized job opportunity has been dictated by
government fiat, women continue to suffer
second-class status caused largely by homemaking
responsibilities, according to an August 9 New
York Times article.
In order for the feminist movement to reach full
fruition, women must shirk this unilateral burden
they have carried for time immemorial. Bell writes
of this second stage of anti-sexist reform:
. . The first revolution has merely expanded
the number of women who have added market
employment to their work at home. The second
revolution must deal with the work at home, so that
it is no longer assigned on the basis of sex, so that
we no longer think of women with role conflicts, or
women having to sort out their work at home for
their work outside."
Raised incentives
Bell realizes that part of the solution must lie in
raising the incentives for males to perform con
sumer maintenance work, and hence in a market
price equated to the considerable economic value
of such services. Her suggestions include govern
ment tax schemes and mandatory child care insur
ance for married couples.
But we needn't resort to such coercion to achieve
the very worthy goal of an emancipated woman
hood. A voluntary alternative would include, first,
a widespread consciousness-raising.
Women who realized that only convention de
mands they perform the homemaking chores of a
family relationship could demand marriage "con
tracts" which obligate both parties to a
previously-determined share of the consumer
maintenance responsibilities.
Those who realize the beauty of the market can
see where this will lead. If either party found the
reconciliation of the contractual responsibility with
a career impossible, he/she could contract out his/
her share of the housework to homemaking profes
sionals — at a market price!
