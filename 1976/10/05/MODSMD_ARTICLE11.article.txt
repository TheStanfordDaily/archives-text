Thanks to Jack Vaughn for his article
pointing out the true lack of choice
offered by the so-called "major" polit
ical parties. As he mentions, these
views are the only ones currently re
ceiving wide media attention, but
there is a candidate who does believe
that it is time to change the arena of
discussion as well as the combatants.
That candidate is Roger Macßride,
presidential candidate of the Liberta
rian Party. I hope that other readers
who agree with Vaughn that it is
time for "the moral market (to) move
to the plane of voluntary persua
sion . . . without the police power
either enforcing or thwarting" such ef
forts will demand to be kept better in
formed of his position and campaign
activities by the local media, in order
that they may make a truly informed
choice on November 2.

In past years,l have enjoyed and ap-
he halftime presentations of
the Stanford Band. Their zany antics,
outlandish attire and clever use of sa
tire have given me many happy mo
ments.
I must, however, protest the presen
tation at the game against San Jose
State on Saturday, Sept. 25.
The band's "Salute to Death." not
only of Mao. but particularly to untold
thousands, perhaps millions of
Chinese as the result of devastating
earthquakes, was not only in bad taste,
but "sick."
1 can only hope that saner minds will
prevail in the planning of future
shows. The celebration of the death of
any person or group of people does not
give me pleasure.
I certainly do not consider it enter
taining.
