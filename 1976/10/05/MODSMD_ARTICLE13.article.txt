# University gets ready for swine flu vaccines
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Members of the Stanford community will be
able to receive inoculations against the A-New
Jersey influenza virus (commonly called swine
tlu) during the first two weeks in November in
Memorial Auditorium, according to Harvey Hall,
program site director.
Hall announced Sunday that the vaccine will be
available on Tuesday through Friday, Nov. 2-5,
and Tuesday through Friday, Nov. 9-12 from noon
to 4 p.m.
In order to avoid lines, an alphabetical break
down basically the same as that used in registra
tion will be employed at the vaccine administra
tion site, said Hall, a former Stanford registrar and
ombudsman.
Individuals desiring inoculation should report
to Mem Aud according to thefollowing schedule:
—Tuesday, November 2 — A D
—Wednesday. November 3 — E-K
—Thursday, November 4 — L-R
—Friday, November 5 — S-Z
During the second week Nov. 9-12, says Hall,
"anybody can come any time." Persons to be in
oculated should enter the auditorium through the
side door off of the brick terrace opposite the
Graduate School of Business.
Quick process
Once inside, they will be given "informed con
sent forms" to read, fill out and sign. This will be
done in the auditorium and the inoculations
themselves will be carried out in the building's
lobby.
Dr. Hall says that if there are no lines, the whole
process will take five minutes. Even during busy
times, he says he expects no one to have to wait
more than a half-hour.
Stressing th.it the inoculation program at
Memorial Auditorium will be open to everyone
who is associated with the university as a student,
employe, or resident, Hall estimated that bet
ween "50 and 75 per cent" of the 20,000 people

here will use the program. He said he expects
between 10,000 and 15,000 people to appear for
inoculation.
No shortage expected
Dr. James McClenahan, director of Cowell Stu
dent Health Services, has said that he does not
expect there to be any problems with shortages.
"We've ordered 15,000 doses from the Santa Clara
County Health Department and I think we'll have
enough."
He also said he expects around 3500 members
of the community to receive their inocculations
from a joint American Red Cross and HEW prog
ram that will run on weekends at the Stanford
Shopping Center, starting a week before the on
campus program.
Meanwhile, controversy over the necessity of
the program and of individuals receiving inocula
tions continues. A study conducted by resear
chers at Harvard Medical School and printed in
the Sept. 30, 1976 issue of the New England Jour
nal of Medicine concluded that there is a 10 per
cent chance of an epidemic occurring this winter
that could infect 56 million people and cause
50,000 excess deaths.
Thomas Merigan, professor of medicine at the
Medical School here and head of the Division of
Infectious Diseases,agreed with Linus Pauling's
conclusion that swine flu "isn't very infectious,"
judging from the low rate of incidence of the dis
ease at Ft. Dix, N.J. where the strain was originally
isolated.
He emphasized that individuals in those
categories with a high risk of complications or
death from an influenza attack (people with
chronic cardiovascular disease, bronchopulmo
nary disease and people over 65) should receive
the vaccine. "If they have any of the factors, they
should do it,"he said, adding, "for other students,
the argument is less compelling, but it is a prog
ram offered by the federal government to prevent
a possible epidemic."

chers at Harvard Medical School and printed in
the Sept. 30, 1976 issue of the New England Jour
nal of Medicine concluded that there is a 10 per
cent chance of an epidemic occurring this winter
that could infect 56 million people and cause
50,000 excess deaths.
Thomas Merigan, professor of medicine at the
Medical School here and head of the Division of
Infectious Diseases,agreed with Linus Pauling's
conclusion that swine flu "isn't very infectious,"
judging from the low rate of incidence of the dis
ease at Ft. Dix, N.J. where the strain was originally
isolated.
He emphasized that individuals in those
categories with a high risk of complications or
death from an influenza attack (people with
chronic cardiovascular disease, bronchopulmo
nary disease and people over 65) should receive
the vaccine. "If they have any of the factors, they
should do it,"he said, adding, "for other students,
the argument is less compelling, but it is a prog
ram offered by the federal government to prevent
a possible epidemic."
Members of the Stanford community will be
able to receive inoculations against the A-New
Jersey influenza virus (commonly called swine
tlu) during the first two weeks in November in
Memorial Auditorium, according to Harvey Hall,
program site director.
Hall announced Sunday that the vaccine will be
available on Tuesday through Friday, Nov. 2-5,
and Tuesday through Friday, Nov. 9-12 from noon
to 4 p.m.
In order to avoid lines, an alphabetical break
down basically the same as that used in registra
tion will be employed at the vaccine administra
tion site, said Hall, a former Stanford registrar and
ombudsman.
Individuals desiring inoculation should report
to Mem Aud according to thefollowing schedule:
—Tuesday, November 2 — A D
—Wednesday. November 3 — E-K
—Thursday, November 4 — L-R
—Friday, November 5 — S-Z
During the second week Nov. 9-12, says Hall,
"anybody can come any time." Persons to be in
oculated should enter the auditorium through the
side door off of the brick terrace opposite the
Graduate School of Business.
Quick process
Once inside, they will be given "informed con
sent forms" to read, fill out and sign. This will be
done in the auditorium and the inoculations
themselves will be carried out in the building's
lobby.
Dr. Hall says that if there are no lines, the whole
process will take five minutes. Even during busy
times, he says he expects no one to have to wait
more than a half-hour.
Stressing th.it the inoculation program at
Memorial Auditorium will be open to everyone
who is associated with the university as a student,
employe, or resident, Hall estimated that bet
ween "50 and 75 per cent" of the 20,000 people

here will use the program. He said he expects
between 10,000 and 15,000 people to appear for
inoculation.
No shortage expected
Dr. James McClenahan, director of Cowell Stu
dent Health Services, has said that he does not
expect there to be any problems with shortages.
"We've ordered 15,000 doses from the Santa Clara
County Health Department and I think we'll have
enough."
He also said he expects around 3500 members
of the community to receive their inocculations
from a joint American Red Cross and HEW prog
ram that will run on weekends at the Stanford
Shopping Center, starting a week before the on
campus program.
Meanwhile, controversy over the necessity of
the program and of individuals receiving inocula
tions continues. A study conducted by resear
chers at Harvard Medical School and printed in
the Sept. 30, 1976 issue of the New England Jour
nal of Medicine concluded that there is a 10 per
