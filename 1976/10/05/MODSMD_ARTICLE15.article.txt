# Polls: major campaign factor
## 
### 
New York (AP) — The quad
rennial dance of the numbers has
begun. Between now and elec
tion day voters will be told what
they're thinking in political poll
after political poll.
The surveys will play a major
role in the campaign, both in the
way that Americans perceive its
course and in the way that can
didates conduct it.
The big scoreboard is report
ing on the early innings. The
polls indicate that Jimmy Car
ter's early lead over President
Gerald Ford has dwindled. And
one unusual poll says a large
proportion of people won't
bother to vote.
A few hours after the first
Ford-Carter debate. The As-,
sociated Press completed a
nationwide poll that showed the
president with a slight edg* in
the encounter. Pollster Burns
Roper was on the air right after
the debate with a poll for ABC
indicating the same thing. By the

end of the week Louis Harris,
sampling for ABC, had Ford the
winner by 40 to 31 per cent,
though the poll still had Carter
ahead in the race 50 to 41. A Gal
lup poll for Newsweek gave Ford
a 28 to 25 per cent margin in the
debate.
All these polls agreed on the
outcome. But there were differ
ences about the margin and vari
ous shadings in the conclusions
presented. That's how it is with
polls: the findings from a sci
entfic cross-section must be
weighed against the statistical
margin for error, which varies
with the size of the sample. Re
sults are also affected by the tim
ing, the methods and the word
ing of questions.
Incorrect forecasts
All this has sometimes stirred
controversies about opinion
surveys. Now and then polls
have missed the mark — the
most celebrated instance being
the polls' forecast of a Truman

defeat in 1948.
Foils affect fund-raising, help
shape campaign tactics and
identify weak states.
Both Ford and Carter have
their own pollsters. Robert Tee
ter of Market Opinion Research
in Detroit labors for the Republi
can. Pat Caddell, of Cambridge
Survey Research in Massachu
setts, who worked for Sen.
George McGovern the last time,
now serves Carter. Caddell also
travels with the candidate and is
one of his chief advisers.
The most widely-known polls
are those of the Gallup and Har
ris organizations, but there are
hundreds of others, taking
soundings in corporations, in
stitutions and politicians.
Continual surveys
Harris and Gallup will survey
voters right up to the weekend
before the election. Harris says
he'll be polling through Sunday
night if the election seems close,
and he may release figures on TV
on election day.
If polling is a complex and
costly operation, drawing con
clusions from polls can have its
pitfalls, too.
"I just don't think people can
read polls," says Peter D. Hart, a
Washington pollster.
Experts like Hart point to sev
eral factors readers should keep
in mind when reading polls: the
margin for error, the wording of
the questions, the order in which
questions are asked, the in
terpretation of results and the

complexity of opinions people
hold.
Margin of error
In the polls of a presidential
campaign the margin of error
can make a big difference in the
meaning of the results. If one
candidate is said to be leading by
46 to 40 per cent, the margin of
error could mean the two candi
dates were actually in a 43 to 43
tie.
In a typical national sample of
1200 to 1500 persons, the laws
of statistics hold that 95 per cent
of the time, the poll will be accu
rate within a margin of about 3
per cent, in either direction.
So, in a 46 to 40 per cent con
test, the candidate with 46 per
cent could have anywhere from
43 to 49 per cent. The other can
didate, at 40 per cent, could ac
tually have 37 to 43 per cent.
In a presidential election, the
margin of error could involve
millions of votes. These samples
reflect nationwide preferences
and strengths, while the election
itself is decided in the electoral
college. One candidate may ap
pear to be ahead overall and ac
tually be trailing in the states
with ihe most electoral votes. In
1960. John F. Kennedy defeated
Richard M. Nixon by a bare 1 per
cent edge. He won 303 electoral
college votes to Nixon's 219.
'Undecided'
Another point to watch is the
number of "undecided" voters
in a sample. If the percentage is
large, around 15 to 20, it is too
early to tell much about the out
come of the election.
A classic example of problems
that can crop up came in 1968
when Nelson Rockefeller made a
late move for the Republican
presidential nomination.
Key factors in the struggle
with Nixon were Harris and Gal
lup polls indicating which man
would run better against Hubert
Humphrey.
Within days of each other, Gal
lup and Harris reported polls
showing completely opposite
results. The two competing pol
ling organizations issued an un
precedented joint statement at
tempting to explain the differ
ences in terms of normal sampl
ing error and timing.

Richard M. Nixon by a bare 1 per
cent edge. He won 303 electoral
college votes to Nixon's 219.
'Undecided'
Another point to watch is the
number of "undecided" voters
in a sample. If the percentage is
large, around 15 to 20, it is too
early to tell much about the out
come of the election.
A classic example of problems
that can crop up came in 1968
when Nelson Rockefeller made a
late move for the Republican
presidential nomination.
Key factors in the struggle
with Nixon were Harris and Gal
lup polls indicating which man
would run better against Hubert
Humphrey.
Within days of each other, Gal
lup and Harris reported polls
showing completely opposite
results. The two competing pol
ling organizations issued an un
precedented joint statement at
tempting to explain the differ
ences in terms of normal sampl
ing error and timing.
New York (AP) — The quad
rennial dance of the numbers has
begun. Between now and elec
tion day voters will be told what
they're thinking in political poll
after political poll.
The surveys will play a major
role in the campaign, both in the
way that Americans perceive its
course and in the way that can
didates conduct it.
The big scoreboard is report
ing on the early innings. The
polls indicate that Jimmy Car
ter's early lead over President
Gerald Ford has dwindled. And
one unusual poll says a large
proportion of people won't
bother to vote.
A few hours after the first
Ford-Carter debate. The As-,
sociated Press completed a
nationwide poll that showed the
president with a slight edg* in
the encounter. Pollster Burns
Roper was on the air right after
the debate with a poll for ABC
indicating the same thing. By the

end of the week Louis Harris,
sampling for ABC, had Ford the
winner by 40 to 31 per cent,
though the poll still had Carter
ahead in the race 50 to 41. A Gal
lup poll for Newsweek gave Ford
a 28 to 25 per cent margin in the
debate.
All these polls agreed on the
outcome. But there were differ
ences about the margin and vari
ous shadings in the conclusions
presented. That's how it is with
polls: the findings from a sci
entfic cross-section must be
weighed against the statistical
margin for error, which varies
with the size of the sample. Re
sults are also affected by the tim
ing, the methods and the word
ing of questions.
Incorrect forecasts
All this has sometimes stirred
controversies about opinion
surveys. Now and then polls
have missed the mark — the
most celebrated instance being
the polls' forecast of a Truman

defeat in 1948.
Foils affect fund-raising, help
shape campaign tactics and
identify weak states.
Both Ford and Carter have
their own pollsters. Robert Tee
ter of Market Opinion Research
in Detroit labors for the Republi
can. Pat Caddell, of Cambridge
Survey Research in Massachu
setts, who worked for Sen.
George McGovern the last time,
now serves Carter. Caddell also
travels with the candidate and is
one of his chief advisers.
The most widely-known polls
are those of the Gallup and Har
ris organizations, but there are
hundreds of others, taking
soundings in corporations, in
stitutions and politicians.
Continual surveys
Harris and Gallup will survey
voters right up to the weekend
before the election. Harris says
he'll be polling through Sunday
night if the election seems close,
and he may release figures on TV
on election day.
If polling is a complex and
costly operation, drawing con
clusions from polls can have its
pitfalls, too.
"I just don't think people can
read polls," says Peter D. Hart, a
Washington pollster.
Experts like Hart point to sev
eral factors readers should keep
in mind when reading polls: the
margin for error, the wording of
the questions, the order in which
questions are asked, the in
terpretation of results and the

complexity of opinions people
hold.
Margin of error
In the polls of a presidential
campaign the margin of error
can make a big difference in the
meaning of the results. If one
candidate is said to be leading by
46 to 40 per cent, the margin of
error could mean the two candi
dates were actually in a 43 to 43
tie.
In a typical national sample of
1200 to 1500 persons, the laws
of statistics hold that 95 per cent
of the time, the poll will be accu
rate within a margin of about 3
per cent, in either direction.
So, in a 46 to 40 per cent con
test, the candidate with 46 per
cent could have anywhere from
43 to 49 per cent. The other can
didate, at 40 per cent, could ac
tually have 37 to 43 per cent.
In a presidential election, the
margin of error could involve
millions of votes. These samples
reflect nationwide preferences
and strengths, while the election
itself is decided in the electoral
college. One candidate may ap
pear to be ahead overall and ac
tually be trailing in the states
with ihe most electoral votes. In
1960. John F. Kennedy defeated
Richard M. Nixon by a bare 1 per
cent edge. He won 303 electoral
college votes to Nixon's 219.

tie.
In a typical national sample of
1200 to 1500 persons, the laws
of statistics hold that 95 per cent
of the time, the poll will be accu
rate within a margin of about 3
per cent, in either direction.
So, in a 46 to 40 per cent con
test, the candidate with 46 per
cent could have anywhere from
43 to 49 per cent. The other can
didate, at 40 per cent, could ac
tually have 37 to 43 per cent.
In a presidential election, the
margin of error could involve
millions of votes. These samples
reflect nationwide preferences
and strengths, while the election
itself is decided in the electoral
college. One candidate may ap
pear to be ahead overall and ac
tually be trailing in the states
with ihe most electoral votes. In
1960. John F. Kennedy defeated
Richard M. Nixon by a bare 1 per
cent edge. He won 303 electoral
college votes to Nixon's 219.
'Undecided'
Another point to watch is the
number of "undecided" voters
in a sample. If the percentage is
large, around 15 to 20, it is too
early to tell much about the out
come of the election.
A classic example of problems
that can crop up came in 1968
when Nelson Rockefeller made a
late move for the Republican
presidential nomination.
Key factors in the struggle
with Nixon were Harris and Gal
lup polls indicating which man
would run better against Hubert
Humphrey.
Within days of each other, Gal
lup and Harris reported polls
showing completely opposite
results. The two competing pol
ling organizations issued an un
precedented joint statement at
tempting to explain the differ
ences in terms of normal sampl
ing error and timing.
New York (AP) — The quad
rennial dance of the numbers has
begun. Between now and elec
tion day voters will be told what
they're thinking in political poll
after political poll.
The surveys will play a major
role in the campaign, both in the
way that Americans perceive its
course and in the way that can
didates conduct it.
The big scoreboard is report
ing on the early innings. The
polls indicate that Jimmy Car
ter's early lead over President
Gerald Ford has dwindled. And
one unusual poll says a large
proportion of people won't
bother to vote.
A few hours after the first
Ford-Carter debate. The As-,
sociated Press completed a
nationwide poll that showed the
president with a slight edg* in
the encounter. Pollster Burns
Roper was on the air right after
the debate with a poll for ABC
indicating the same thing. By the

end of the week Louis Harris,
sampling for ABC, had Ford the
winner by 40 to 31 per cent,
though the poll still had Carter
ahead in the race 50 to 41. A Gal
lup poll for Newsweek gave Ford
a 28 to 25 per cent margin in the
debate.
All these polls agreed on the
outcome. But there were differ
ences about the margin and vari
ous shadings in the conclusions
presented. That's how it is with
polls: the findings from a sci
entfic cross-section must be
weighed against the statistical
margin for error, which varies
with the size of the sample. Re
sults are also affected by the tim
ing, the methods and the word
ing of questions.
Incorrect forecasts
All this has sometimes stirred
controversies about opinion
surveys. Now and then polls
have missed the mark — the
most celebrated instance being
the polls' forecast of a Truman

defeat in 1948.
Foils affect fund-raising, help
shape campaign tactics and
identify weak states.
Both Ford and Carter have
their own pollsters. Robert Tee
ter of Market Opinion Research
in Detroit labors for the Republi
can. Pat Caddell, of Cambridge
Survey Research in Massachu
setts, who worked for Sen.
George McGovern the last time,
now serves Carter. Caddell also
travels with the candidate and is
one of his chief advisers.
The most widely-known polls
are those of the Gallup and Har
ris organizations, but there are
hundreds of others, taking
soundings in corporations, in
stitutions and politicians.
Continual surveys
Harris and Gallup will survey
voters right up to the weekend
before the election. Harris says
he'll be polling through Sunday
night if the election seems close,
and he may release figures on TV
on election day.
If polling is a complex and
costly operation, drawing con
clusions from polls can have its
pitfalls, too.
"I just don't think people can
read polls," says Peter D. Hart, a
Washington pollster.
Experts like Hart point to sev
eral factors readers should keep
in mind when reading polls: the
margin for error, the wording of
the questions, the order in which
questions are asked, the in
terpretation of results and the

complexity of opinions people
hold.
