How come there are so many free-loading "C" stickers in the new
"B" lot next to the Encina Courts that us paid-up "B's" can't find a
decent place to park?
Is it because the sign posting is minimal and the "C" stickers are
pleading ignorance? >h

Captain William Wullshleger of Police Services says it's not the
"C" stickers who are pleading ignorance, but the parking au
thorities. "It's a matter of enforcement," says Wullschleger.
Wullschleger says enforcement will begin soon since students
have five days from registration to put on their parking stickers.
But "free-loading C's," don't expect to go unnoticed forever.
