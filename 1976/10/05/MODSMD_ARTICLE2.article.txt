San Francisco — President Gerald Ford and Jimmy
Carter arrived at San Francisco International Airport
within hours of each other yesterday and immediately
began preparations for tomorrow's debate on foreign
policy.
Ford and Carter are expected to keep a low profile
until the second verbal face-off in the Palace of Fine
Arts. Carter has no scheduled campaign stops while
the president will probably make one or two appear
ances around the Bay Area today.
Neither contender did any campaigning yesterday.
Carter was the first to arrive in San Francisco, touch
ing down just before 5 p.m. He was greeted at the
airport by California Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. and San
Francisco Mayor George Moscone.
Although Carter did not speak at the airport, he
criticized Ford's handling of former Agriculture Sec

retary Earl Butz' resignation. Accusing the president of
"political expedience" at a stopover in Denver, Carter
said Butz' racial joke was "embarrassing and disgust
ing."
Carter also issued a statement upon his arrival in San
Francisco charging Ford with plagiarizing some of his
ideas to halt the spread of nuclear weapons.
Carter and his staff left the airport after about 10
minutes, going to the Sheraton-Palace Hotel where
they will go over final strategies for the debate.
Ford, meanwhile, arrived in San Francisco about
6:30 p.m. Presidential aides said they were confident
that Ford would do well in the debates because of a
knowledge of foreign affairs which he has accrued dur
ing his 23 years on Capitol Hill.
Ford did not speak at the airport, either, but said
aboard Air Force One that he would have to weiah his
