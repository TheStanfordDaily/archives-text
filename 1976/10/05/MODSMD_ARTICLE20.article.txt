# ARC organization lacking on campus

Alliance for Radical Change (ARC) has not yet met this quarter,
was not represented by a table at Registration, and has yet to plan
any activities for the near future. However, its members claim the
lack of organized functions sponsored by ARC does not reveal the
death of radicalism here because many students are involved in
various other political efforts.
Many members of ARC are involved in on-going political groups
such as the "Friends of the Earth," or election-oriented groups such
as the "David Harris for Congress" campaign and the "Yes on 14"
effort, rather than focusing attention on organizing ARC on cam
pus.
A "sometimes" member of ARC, Wayne Sachs, explains that
"ARC's tardy appearance this fall is due in part to the existence of
organizations and campaigns which are dealing with many of the
issues with which ARC is concerned,-and in part to the lack of
returning members."
Sachs said the cohesion of ARC has dissipated, and that many
members have graduated. Members indicated students have cho
sen dilferent political emphases. Sachs indicated that this may be
less reflective of the disintegration of so-called "radicalism," and
more a consequence of energy being channelled into broader issues
that are not Stanford-based.
I he energy of ARC members, although spread among other pro
jects, is being directed toward the principles upon which ARC was
founded, according to members.
