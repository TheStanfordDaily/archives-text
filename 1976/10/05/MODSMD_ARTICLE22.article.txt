# S.F. nightclubs offer top sounds

### Alan Hoffman 
An enthusiastic commentator
summarizes a San Francisco
concert in the '60s: ":JOUO
dope-crazed Dead fans crouched
haunch to haunch in the dark
ness on the immense dance
floor. . .
For better or worse, this is no
longer a proper orientation to
live progressive music in the
City. Not to say that you can't
still enjoy a similar debauch, but
today the performance locale
varies as greatly as the music it
self. Within the jurisdiction of
the prolific Bay Area music
scene, we concert recidivists
must pay heed to one law: where
we listen must compliment
those to whom we listen.
If you find that being lost in a
great amorphous mass of fellow
ticket-holders does not satisfy,
an alternative is available: the
Bay Area nightclubs.
The uniqueness of these clubs
consists in their ability to attract
the finest progressive talents in
the world, plus audiences who
actually come to hear their
music. They provide the exclu
sive opportunity to experience
these performers in an intimate
atmosphere.
Unique concert experience
Of course, each individual
club and performer brings forth a
unique concert experience, a fact
that those who lust after an even
ing of hot licks should bear in
mind.
One very fertile breeding
ground of sounds is San Francis
co's Boarding House (960 Bush
Street). The Boarding House
evokes a kind of informal ele
gance: it is also a pioneer con
cept of an entertainment com
plex. Fine music is augmented
by a bar, a restaurant and the
new arrival — Magnolia Thun
derpussy's Delicatessen.
Thunderpussy's accommo
dates vegetarians and carni
vores, day and night people, and
those who don't have time to
take advantage of the dinner
and-show package (after your
repast, you are guaranteed first
section seating).
"Minor's Lib" activists are
happy to find that they aren't

treated as second-class citizens.
Also, large parties like the long
tables. The club's laid back feel
ing and complete facilities regu
larly lure stars who can play
much larger halls.
For example, the first half of
October alone will bring the pre
stigious likes of Melanie,
Steeleye Span, Kenny Rankin
and Holly Near.
Another premier nightclub
The City's other pretender to
premier nightclub status is the
Great American Music Hall (859
O'Farrell). It features a wider
range of progressive talent: rock,
country, jazz, folk, even Big
Band. Thus a given audience in
this converted ballroom could be
composed of, say, cocktail chat
terers, cosmic cowboys, or Mom
and Dad.
Advance tickets are a must for
a show here, unless one enjoys
the street ambiance of cold, fog,
and/or rain that precedes admis
sion.
The club lacks a restaurant,
but burger-fare is available
throughout the evening. A
street-vendor also sells burritos
before every gig by the Flying
Burrito Brothers.
October will bring Tracy Nel
son, Sonny Rollins, Esther Phil
lips and Sarah Vaughn to the
Great American Music Hall.
Sweaty underside
For those who savor the
sweaty underside of progressive
music, the East Bay is the place
to be. Unpretentious music at
Berkeley's Keystone (2119 Uni
versity Ave.) regularly seems to
liberate patrons of their own
hang-ups. A foot-stomping good
time is often to be had by the
over-21 crowds, whether in
duced by blues, zydeco, Russian
rock or the brew on tap.
On occasional nights women
can take advantage of an old
nightclub tradition maintained
by the Keystone — free admis
sion for the "ladies." Both sexes
should arrive early for any show,
by the way, to avoid the peculiar
perspective of sitting behind a
post. If you should find yourself
in such a predicament, try mov
ing onto the dance floor.
This month's entertainment

horizon for the Keystone in
cludes Ruby (with Tom Fogerty),
Navasota, Road Hog (featuring
Robert Hunger), Sasha and Yuri,
and Jiminy "Fastfingers" Daw
kins.
Those who shun the notes
by-rote sounds of "fusion
music" in favor of the latest re
search in "black classical
music," matriculate at San Fran
cisco's leading jazz clubs — the
Keystone Korner (750 Vallejo)
and El Matador (492 Broadway).
The Korner's performers have
yet to be co-opted into the cur
rent trend among jazz musicians
of trading musical integrity for
commercial appeal. They are the

reason for "black classical
music's " continued growth, for
keeping it alive (as it always has
lived) in nightclub jams. El
Matador, on the other hand, en
riches the City scene with more
established jazz veterans.
These are the clubs whose
fame has been spread by live al
bums recorded there, and by the
people who play there. The re
maining sum total of this incred
ible club scene has never lacked
a following. Hordes of Bay Area
residents have sold their televi
sion sets to become music ad
dicts, and the epidemic is likely
to be with us for a long time to
come.
