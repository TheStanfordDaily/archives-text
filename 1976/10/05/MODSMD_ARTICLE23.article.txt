One of the most intensely moving facets of San
Francisco's renowned cultural life, its interna
tionally known opera, is also perhaps the most
tragically neglected. While most people derive a
great deal of relaxed enjoyment from San Francis
co's theatre, ballet, symphony and other attrac
tions, many feel for some reason that the opera is
beyond their cultural or financial reach. Another
belief is that one has to be well-versed in the
history of opera and completely fluent in Italian
and German before one can begin to appreciate
the art.
However, whatever your background, opera is
probably art's richest expressive form combining
theatre, poetry and music to examine emotional
situations as if through a magnifying glass. While
the straight scripts of conventional theatre requ ire
time to form personalities, the music of an opera
presents and intensifies emotions instantane
ously.
This year the San Francisco Opera, recognized
as one of the leading companies in the world,
presents a wide repertoire ranging from the grand
opera to the (lighter, comic) opera buffo. Tickets
range from $25 for single box seats to $6. and
further to $3.50 for standing room. Dress varies
from full tux and formalsto jeans and workshJrts,
and both seem equally appropriate. There are
buses to the opera. For information call, in San
Jose (408) 354-4268, on the South Peninsula (415)
326-0856, 321-9875, or 323-6305.
If you chose to drive, the fastest way is to take
Hwy. 101 to the second Civic Center turn off, go
one block on Golden Gate, which brings you to
Van Ness, turn right and two blocks down is the
Opera House.

American opera debuts — Claes Ahnsi will sing
Nicias, and Alexander Malta will be Palemon.
Wagner's most popular of the operas in the Ring
cycle, Die Walkure, treats gods,humans, dwarfs,
monsters, and animals. It merges legends and love
stories and magic with fantastic tales. It is incred
ibly complex, enormously expansive and tre

Sotin will make his San Francisco Opera debut as
Wotan.

theme of redemption through love and suffering
mingled with Oriental fantasies and supersti
tions. The setting is in the Southeastern Islands
in legendary times.
Janacek's suspenseful and chilling work, Th»
Mukropulus Case, is based on the Karel Capek
play in which a decadent 342-year-old woman
finds little fulfillment in her eternal life and seeks
to end it. Anja Silja will create the role of the
ehroine Emilia Marty, with Sir Geraint Evans as
Baron Prus and William Lewis as Albert Gregor.

has been assembled. Soprano Nancy Shade will
make her San Francisco Opera debut as Susan
Ward, with William Lewis as Frank Sargent. Dale
Duesing will make his American opera debut as
Oliver Ward, Chester Ludgin will be heard as
Lyman Ward and Susanne Marsee will be Shelley
Rasmussen.

One of the most intensely moving facets of San
Francisco's renowned cultural life, its interna
tionally known opera, is also perhaps the most
tragically neglected. While most people derive a
great deal of relaxed enjoyment from San Francis
co's theatre, ballet, symphony and other attrac
tions, many feel for some reason that the opera is
beyond their cultural or financial reach. Another
belief is that one has to be well-versed in the
history of opera and completely fluent in Italian
and German before one can begin to appreciate
the art.
However, whatever your background, opera is
probably art's richest expressive form combining
theatre, poetry and music to examine emotional
situations as if through a magnifying glass. While
the straight scripts of conventional theatre requ ire
time to form personalities, the music of an opera
presents and intensifies emotions instantane
ously.

One of the most intensely moving facets of San
Francisco's renowned cultural life, its interna
tionally known opera, is also perhaps the most
tragically neglected. While most people derive a
great deal of relaxed enjoyment from San Francis
co's theatre, ballet, symphony and other attrac
tions, many feel for some reason that the opera is
beyond their cultural or financial reach. Another
belief is that one has to be well-versed in the
history of opera and completely fluent in Italian
and German before one can begin to appreciate
the art.
However, whatever your background, opera is
probably art's richest expressive form combining
theatre, poetry and music to examine emotional
situations as if through a magnifying glass. While
the straight scripts of conventional theatre requ ire
time to form personalities, the music of an opera
presents and intensifies emotions instantane
ously.
