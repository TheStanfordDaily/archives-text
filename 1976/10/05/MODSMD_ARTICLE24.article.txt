For many Stanford students
who were raised in the cultural
deserts of the Midwest, Alaska,
or Los Angeles, going to school
in the San Francisco Bay Area is
like spending four sweet years at
an oasis of civilization.
San Francisco is deservedly
famed as a cultural center; how
ever, fulfilling the fears of their
parents most Stanford students
end up imbibing culture at a rock
concert instead of at the Opera
House.
This phenomenon is only
right and natural, since it is rock
'n'roll which is the most native of
all San Francisco art forms. San
Francisco not only spawned the
hippie cultureand revolutionary
life-styles which rock 'n roll
celebrates, but this region also
gave to the world such talents as
Santana, The Jefferson Starship,
the Grateful Dead and Janis Jop
lin.
A fixture on the S.F. rock
scene since its inception was the
rock promoter: the businessman
who brought the music and the
people together. The most fam
ous S.F. rock impresario is Bill
Graham, and through a mixture
of determination, talent and
truck-loads of hard work, he has
managed to survive and prosper
in a profession known for its
high casualty rate.

Graham arrived in New York
from eastern Europe as a young
boy after much of his family
perished at the hands of the
Nazis. He came to San Francisco
in the early '60s just as the
local rock scene was beginning
and Graham produced some of
San Francisco's first rock
dance-concerts.
Graham went on to run the
Fillmore West in San Francisco
and later opened the Fillmore
East in New York. After closing
down both Fillmores around
1970, Graham and his organiza
tion, FM Productions, continued
to produce rock concerts in the
San Francisco area on a show by
show basis, as well as running a
few national tours for such
luminaries as The Rolling
Stones and Bob Dylan.
Throughout his career,
Graham has been known for his
professionalism. His shows can
be counted on to start on time
and run like clock-work. Graham
never scrimps on security — the
fatal flaw of most fly-by-night
rock promoters; hence his shows
are safe for the fans as well as the
musicians.
Although Graham can hardly
mount a stage without some
goon in the audience shouting
insults at him, he has always put
some of his profits back into the
community. He has quietly sub
sidized the Haight-Ashbury Free

Medical Clinic for years, and he
has put on numerous benefits
including the massive SNACK
concert which raised $700,000
for high school athletics and fea
tured Bob Dylan, Santana, The
Jefferson Starship and a guest
appearance by Marlon Brando.
Wielding a broom
AlthoughGrahamstill worksa
back-breaking schedule he now
tries to give himself some lei
sure; for instance, he flew to the
Phillipines for a guest spot in
Francis Ford Coppola's latest
movie. Yet despite his immense
success, with its complement of
money, power in the music in
dustry, and fame among his au
dience, Graham still could be
spotted this summer wielding a
broom and quietly sweeping off
the stage at the Oakland Col
ieseum between acts as his
numerous stage hands scurried
about unawares.
This month Graham will be
presenting the Who and the
Grateful Dead together at the
Oakland Coliseum on October 9
and 10; Daryl Hall and Joan
Oates at the Paramount Theatre
in Oakland on October 12, Lily
Tomlin at the nearby Flint
Center at De Anza College in
Cupertino on October 23, and
the Band at the Paramount
Theatre on November 14.
