Ford signs tax bill revision
Washington — President Gerald Ford signed a wide
ranging tax revision bill yesterday that eases the tax bur
den for individuals and businesses across America.
Ford signed the measure at a White House ceremony,
commenting that the legislation is "sound, positive and
long overdue."
But he added that the law is "far from perfect," particu
larly because he said it failed to include his request for
deeper cuts in individual taxes. He said he will continue
to work for a "better break for low- and middle-income
taxpayers."
Tax cuts included in the law total about $18 billion but
workers should not look for any more money in their
paychecks since these cuts are already in effect and are
simply being extended.
Most of the tax changes will take effect this year or next,
but some will not be phased in until later. Five years from
now the bill will produce a net federal revenue increase of
about $984 million over the present law.
Auto workers strike possibly settled
Detroit — Announcement of a tentative contract settle
ment was expected shortly as bargainers for the striking
United Auto Workers (UAW) and Ford Motor Co. met
yesterday, the 20th day of the nationwide walkout.
Sources close to the talks told reporters that the final
unresolved economic provisions of the pact were put into
place during lengthy weekend bargaining. All that re
mained, the sources said, was tying together loose ends on
non-economic matters.
If a settlement were announced yesterday, as several
sources said appeared almost certain, it would still take at
least another week before 170,000 Ford workers returned
to their jobs in 22 states. The delay would result from the
union's lengthy ratification process.
The walkout, which began at 12:01 a.m. Sept. 15, has
idled 102 plants and brought Ford's North American car
and truck production to a standstill. It was triggered by
disputes involving wages, fringe benefits, pensions and a
key union demand for more paid days off each year to
expand job opportunities.
The WaJJ Street Journal, quoting sources, reported yes
terday that the new agreement includes company conces
sions in most of those areas. The Journal also quoted
sources as saying the new package would boost Ford's
labor costs by about 10 per cent a year — from a current
$11 per hour, including wages and fringe benefits — to
somewhere between $13 and $14 per hour during the life
of the agreement.
l he work stoppage cost Ford production of more than
160,000 cars and trucks with a retail value of about $1
billion. The strikers have lost wages at a rate of about $50
million a week. The average Ford worker, who makes
nearly $350, received $40 to $50 a week in strike benefits.
High court okays executions' start
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday cleared
the way for the resumption of executions for murder and
agreed to decide whether the death penalty is constitu
tional for rape.
The justices refused to reconsider their decision of last
July 2 upholding the death penalty laws of Florida, Geor
gia and Texas, and ruling that in general the death penalty
is not a constitutionally prohibited punishment for mur
derers.
In a separate action, the court agreed to hear an appeal
by a Georgia rapist in an effort to settle a question which it
left undecided in its July 2 opinion: is the death penalty an
unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment for a
rape in which no human life is taken?
There are 79 prisoners on death row in Florida, 48 in
Texas and more than 50 in Georgia.
ITorida Dep. Atty. Gen. James Whisenand said it would
be at least six months before any executions could be held
in that state. 1 exas Atty. Gen. John Hill said it could be as

long as two years before executions are resumed there. In
Georgia, the sentencing courts will either reset execution
dates or stay the sentence, depending on the individual
case.
The last execution in the United States took place in
1967 in Colorado.
Assassins kill Spanish king's adviser
San Sebastian, Spain — Assassins waiting in ambush
along a downtown street opened fire on approaching traf
fic with machine guns yesterday, killing one of King Juan
Carlos' advisers and three bodyguards and wounding 10
persons.
It was the bloodiest attack against the Spanish regime in
the 10 months since the death of longtime dictator Gen.
Francisco Franco. Authorities said Basque separatists ap
parently were responsible.
The official, Juan Maria de Araluce, 59, a member of the
ultra-conservative Council of the Realm, was cut down
virtually on his doorstep as he was being driven home to
lunch in the downtown section of this Basque city.
An anonymous telephone caller told a San Sebastian
newspaper that the Basque separatist organization, ETA,
claimed responsibility for the assassinations of Araluce
"and his guardian dogs."
Araluce, president of the council of the Basque province
of Guipuzcoa, whose capital is San Sebastian, was re
ported to have received death threats from the ETA.
The killings sent shock waves through the government
in Madrid, where the king was reported safe but under
tight security. Premier Adolfo Suarez called his cabinet
into emergency session.
Police launched a massive hunt for the assassination
squad in the San Sabastian area. Patrols virtually sealed
off the nearby border with France, a traditional haven for
ETA members. Coastal guards also were alerted.
Blacks bypass Kissinger plan
Salisbury, Rhodesia — A black nationalist leader made
clear yesterday that black Africans don't like Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger's plan for achieving majority rule in
Rhodesia and are taking over the effort themselves.
"The creation of a constitution now is ours, not the
Americans," Joshua Nkomo, leader of one of the two main
factions of the African National Council, told a news con
ference. He said the United States has "played its role."
Nkomo, a moderate who is mentioned as a possible first
black prime minister of Rhodesia, said black African
heads of state and Rhodesian black leaders had bypassed
Kissinger's plan and drafted a new set of proposals for
moving this country toward black rule. He gave no details
but indicated that Kissinger's timetable of black rule
within two years may be part of the objection.
Simon sees slower economic growth
Manila, Philippines — The rate of U.S. economic ex
pansion will slow down next year, with inflation at a five
to six per cent level and both employment growth and
unemployment declining, U.S. Treasury Secretary Wil
liam Simon told the international financial community
yesterday.
The slower pace will be a "proper pattern," Simon said,
because a continued six to seven per cent growth in
economic output aver an extended period of time "would
invariably overheat the U.S. economy, followed soon af
terward by recession and unemployment."
Simon's remarks came in a speech prepared for delivery
to the joint meeting of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and World Bank, attended by 3000 finance minis
ters, bank executives and other participants.
