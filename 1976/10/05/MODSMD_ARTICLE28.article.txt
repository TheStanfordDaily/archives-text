# Repairs close MemAud; 'Flicks' moved to Cubberley
## 
### Rosario Delatorre 
Memorial Auditorium will be closed
for at least one week and possibly two,
with the ASSU Sunday Flicks moved
to Cubberley Auditorium, while con
tractors repair water damage to its roof
and ceiling, according to Asst. Provost
Amy Blue.
"Contractors will be here (today) to
re-roof the outside above the balcony.
Two contractors will also be here to
make estimates on repairing the ceil
ing inside. We expect to have the work
done in a week or two," Blue said.
She said MemAud will be closed
until all the work is completed.
"(Mem Aud) will be closed until all
the work is done and we get approval
from the health and safety office (to let
persons inside)," Blue said.
Jack Sidlow, safety and health man
ager, ordered the building closed yes
terday because water which leaked
through the roof had loosened plaster
in the ceiling.
Sidlow said the decision to close the
auditorium, except for the stage area,
was based on the possibility of loose
plaster falling on the audience.
Work to begin Tuesday
According to Lynn Bonde, assistant
director of public events, in addition to
moving the Flicks to Cubberley, a
travel film scheduled for showing in
MemAud last night was cancelled.

Bonde said a concert by the Lincoln
Center Chamber Music Society,
scheduled for Oct. 22, has not yet been
rescheduled. "We hope the work will
be completed by then," she said.
Complete re-roofing is expected to
begin by next Tuesday and prelimi
nary cost estimates indicate the ex
terior work may cost about $9000, a
university release said.
Repair work will involve external
re-roofing as well as removing interior
plaster damaged by water, replacing it
and refinishing it, the release said.
ASSU Sunday Flicks Manager Steve
Fugaro said next Sunday night's flick,
Godfather, Part 11, will be shown twice
in Cubberley Auditorium, at 5:30 and 9
p.m.
Limited seating
"We are not planning additional
shows to accommodate more people
because the movie is prohibitively
long," Fugaro said.
Cubberley will seat about 500 per
sons and Fugaro estimated about 800
season pass holders would attend both
shows.
Fugaro said about 1000 season pas
ses have been sold and that season pass
holders will be guaranteed seating.
"The number of 75 cent tickets we
sell will depend on the number of sea
son pass holders who attend the
movie. At most, we may be able to sell

500 tickets for both shows," Fugaro
said.
Fugaro said that many moviegoers
without season passes would probably
have to be turned away.
"If people want to see the movie,
they should come to the first show or
get to Cubberley early for the second
show," he said.
Less audience, less profit
Fugaro added that the Flicks were
being re-scheduled one at a time and
said that it was not yet decided if the
movie Play it Again Sum, slated for
Oct. 17, would be shown in Cubberley.
Fugaro said the limited seating
capacity of Cubberley could cause
films shown there to loose money.
"We can't count on taking in much
more than $800 for Godfather 11, and
we've guaranteed the distributor
(either) $800 or 60 per cent of the gross.
We may not make enough to pay the
guarantee," Fugaro said.
He said, however, that there
wouldn't be a problem with the Flicks
loosing money in the long-run.
"The flicks make big profits, so we
won't go in the red, but we could lose
$100-200 from each movie we show in
Cubberley," Fugaro said.

Center Chamber Music Society,
scheduled for Oct. 22, has not yet been
rescheduled. "We hope the work will
be completed by then," she said.
Complete re-roofing is expected to
begin by next Tuesday and prelimi
nary cost estimates indicate the ex
terior work may cost about $9000, a
university release said.
Repair work will involve external
re-roofing as well as removing interior
plaster damaged by water, replacing it
and refinishing it, the release said.
ASSU Sunday Flicks Manager Steve
Fugaro said next Sunday night's flick,
Godfather, Part 11, will be shown twice
in Cubberley Auditorium, at 5:30 and 9
p.m.
Limited seating
"We are not planning additional
shows to accommodate more people
because the movie is prohibitively
long," Fugaro said.
Cubberley will seat about 500 per
sons and Fugaro estimated about 800
season pass holders would attend both
shows.
Fugaro said about 1000 season pas
ses have been sold and that season pass
holders will be guaranteed seating.
"The number of 75 cent tickets we
sell will depend on the number of sea
son pass holders who attend the
movie. At most, we may be able to sell

500 tickets for both shows," Fugaro
said.
Fugaro said that many moviegoers
without season passes would probably
have to be turned away.
"If people want to see the movie,
they should come to the first show or
get to Cubberley early for the second
show," he said.
Less audience, less profit
Fugaro added that the Flicks were
being re-scheduled one at a time and
said that it was not yet decided if the
movie Play it Again Sum, slated for
Oct. 17, would be shown in Cubberley.
Fugaro said the limited seating
capacity of Cubberley could cause
films shown there to loose money.
"We can't count on taking in much
more than $800 for Godfather 11, and
we've guaranteed the distributor
(either) $800 or 60 per cent of the gross.
We may not make enough to pay the
guarantee," Fugaro said.
He said, however, that there
wouldn't be a problem with the Flicks
loosing money in the long-run.
"The flicks make big profits, so we
won't go in the red, but we could lose
$100-200 from each movie we show in
Cubberley," Fugaro said.
Memorial Auditorium will be closed
for at least one week and possibly two,
with the ASSU Sunday Flicks moved
to Cubberley Auditorium, while con
tractors repair water damage to its roof
and ceiling, according to Asst. Provost
Amy Blue.
"Contractors will be here (today) to
re-roof the outside above the balcony.
Two contractors will also be here to
make estimates on repairing the ceil
ing inside. We expect to have the work
done in a week or two," Blue said.
She said MemAud will be closed
until all the work is completed.
"(Mem Aud) will be closed until all
the work is done and we get approval
from the health and safety office (to let
persons inside)," Blue said.
Jack Sidlow, safety and health man
ager, ordered the building closed yes
terday because water which leaked
through the roof had loosened plaster
in the ceiling.
Sidlow said the decision to close the
auditorium, except for the stage area,
was based on the possibility of loose
plaster falling on the audience.
Work to begin Tuesday
According to Lynn Bonde, assistant
director of public events, in addition to
moving the Flicks to Cubberley, a
travel film scheduled for showing in
MemAud last night was cancelled.

Bonde said a concert by the Lincoln
Center Chamber Music Society,
scheduled for Oct. 22, has not yet been
