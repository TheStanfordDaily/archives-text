# West German chief enters second term facing reduced political support
## 
### 
Bonn, West Germany (AP) — Social
Democrat Chancellor Helmut Schmidt
faced a second term in office with a
drastically reduced majority yesterday
as the outcome of the federal elections
appeared to confirm a steady rise of a
conservative tide in West Germany.
Such a tide has been showing in
state and local elections of the past
four years, and European analysts
were closely watching Sunday's par
liamentary elections for any indication
that Germany would follow Sweden in
turning out the socialists.
Schmidt, a 57-year-old economist
whose coalition government dropped
from a 46-seat margin to eight as a re
sult of the elections, had counted on
being rewarded by the voters for bring
ing the country safely through the
worldwide recession.
But four per cent inflation and un
employment is still too high for people
haunted by the devastating inflation of
the 1920s and the ensuing depression
that hastened Hitler's rise.
Results hailed
Despite the conservative rise, the
Soviet press hailed the results as a vic
tory for East-West detente. Schmidt in
two years as chancel lor has stepped up
efforts to improve relations with the
Soviet bloc. In Washington, neither
satisfaction nor regret was expressed,
although the feeling there is that
Schmidt's view of the world parallels
that of Washington toa degree unusual
for a foreign leader.
The Free Democrats pledged after

the elections to stay with Schmidt's
Social Democrats in the coalition, but
challenger Helmut Kohl refused to
concede defeat and pressed his bid to
woo away the Free Democrats.
Kohn said the coalition's small edge
over his conservative Christian Demo
crats and their Bavarian wing, the
Christian Socialists, is too slender to
survive domestic and foreign policy
problems of the future. His party will
now be the biggest single group in the
Bundestag, or parliament.
'Narrow base'
He said another Schmidt govern
ment will be "a coalition of weak
ness. ... It is the narrowest base a fed
eral government has ever had."
"I am applying for the office of fed
eral chancellor. . . . My friends and I
believe that the voters have given us
this mandate," Kohl said at a news
conference.
He announced he had written
Hans-Dietrich Censcher. leader of the
liberal Free Democrats, to invite him
for talks this coming weekend on form
ing a Christian Democrat-Free Democ
rat ruling alliance. However,
Censcher, Schmidt's foreign minister,
has already reaffirmed a campaign
promise to keep his party with the So
cial Democrats.
Kohl also met with President Walter
Scheel to inform him of his plans. It is
up to Scheel as constitutional head of
state to propose the party leader with
the clearest election majority to he

come chancellor. The formal vote for
chancellor will come on the floor of the
Bundestag on Dec. 14.
Final returns in the elections, with
91 per cent of those registered voting,
gave the Social Democrats and Free

Democrats a combined total of 50.5 per
cent, a drop from the 54.2 per cent they
.won in the 1972 election. The Christ
ian Democrats won 48.6 per cent of the
popular vote, up from 44.9 per cent in
1972.

ian Democrats won 48.6 per cent of the
popular vote, up from 44.9 per cent in
1972.
Bonn, West Germany (AP) — Social
Democrat Chancellor Helmut Schmidt
faced a second term in office with a
drastically reduced majority yesterday
as the outcome of the federal elections
appeared to confirm a steady rise of a
conservative tide in West Germany.
Such a tide has been showing in
state and local elections of the past
four years, and European analysts
were closely watching Sunday's par
liamentary elections for any indication
that Germany would follow Sweden in
turning out the socialists.
Schmidt, a 57-year-old economist
whose coalition government dropped
from a 46-seat margin to eight as a re
sult of the elections, had counted on
being rewarded by the voters for bring
ing the country safely through the
worldwide recession.
But four per cent inflation and un
employment is still too high for people
haunted by the devastating inflation of
the 1920s and the ensuing depression
that hastened Hitler's rise.
Results hailed
Despite the conservative rise, the
Soviet press hailed the results as a vic
tory for East-West detente. Schmidt in
two years as chancel lor has stepped up
efforts to improve relations with the
Soviet bloc. In Washington, neither
satisfaction nor regret was expressed,
although the feeling there is that
Schmidt's view of the world parallels
that of Washington toa degree unusual
for a foreign leader.
The Free Democrats pledged after

the elections to stay with Schmidt's
Social Democrats in the coalition, but
challenger Helmut Kohl refused to
concede defeat and pressed his bid to
woo away the Free Democrats.
Kohn said the coalition's small edge
over his conservative Christian Demo
crats and their Bavarian wing, the
Christian Socialists, is too slender to
survive domestic and foreign policy
problems of the future. His party will
now be the biggest single group in the
Bundestag, or parliament.
'Narrow base'
He said another Schmidt govern
ment will be "a coalition of weak
ness. ... It is the narrowest base a fed
eral government has ever had."
"I am applying for the office of fed
eral chancellor. . . . My friends and I
believe that the voters have given us
this mandate," Kohl said at a news
conference.
He announced he had written
Hans-Dietrich Censcher. leader of the
liberal Free Democrats, to invite him
for talks this coming weekend on form
ing a Christian Democrat-Free Democ
rat ruling alliance. However,
Censcher, Schmidt's foreign minister,
has already reaffirmed a campaign
promise to keep his party with the So
cial Democrats.
Kohl also met with President Walter
Scheel to inform him of his plans. It is
up to Scheel as constitutional head of
state to propose the party leader with
the clearest election majority to he

come chancellor. The formal vote for
chancellor will come on the floor of the
Bundestag on Dec. 14.
Final returns in the elections, with
91 per cent of those registered voting,
gave the Social Democrats and Free

Democrats a combined total of 50.5 per
cent, a drop from the 54.2 per cent they
.won in the 1972 election. The Christ
ian Democrats won 48.6 per cent of the
popular vote, up from 44.9 per cent in
