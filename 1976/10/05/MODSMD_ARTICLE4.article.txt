# Butz resigns over racial slur

### 
Washington (AP) â€” President
Gerald Ford accepted the resignation
of his secretary of agriculture yester
day and said parting with Earl Butz
was "one of the saddest decisions of
my presidency."
The resignation followed a weekend
of rapidly escalating controversy over
an obscene racial slur uttered last Au
gust following the Republican Na
tional Convention and traced to Butz
last week.
The episode had become an issue in
Ford's election campaign and brought
numerous demands from politicians
in both parties that Butz be fired. The
lingering question was whether Ford
had waited too long.
Democratic presidential nominee
Jimmy Carter, campaigning in Denver,
said Butz should have been fired im
mediately and that Ford's handling of
the situation showed a lack of leader
ship.
Both Butz and the president said the
resignation was occasioned solely by
the off-color story about blacks and
did not mean any change of farm pol
icy on the part of the Ford administra
tion.
Gross indiscretion
"This is the price I pay for a gross
indiscretion in a private conversation"
Butz told reporters in the White House
press room following a private meet
ing with Ford.
When Butz had left the White
House, Ford appeared in the press
room and told the reporters that ac
cepting the resignation "has been one
of the saddest decisions of my presi
dency."
Ford said Butz had been "wise
enough and courageous enough to
recognizethat no single individual, no
matter how distinguished his past

public service, should cast a shadow
over the integrity and good will of
American government by his com
ments."
"For that reason," Ford said, "I have
accepted the resignation of this decent
and good man."
The resignation was effective im
mediately. Undersecretary of Agricul
ture John Knebel becomes acting sec
retary. In Mansfield, Ohio,yesterday at
a Republican fund raiser, Knebel was
overheard telling the White House by
telephone, "I will do the best I can."
The president said Butz had asked to
leave the Cabinet some two years ago
because of personal obligations but
had stayed on at Ford's urging.
"1 felt that 1 needed him in the
Cabinet," Ford said, "to implement
policies of full farm production
coupled with fair prices for the con
sumer and good income for farmers
through sales of their products
throughout the world."
Tearful farewell
Butz, his eyes glistening with tears,
said of Ford "I shall continue to work
tirelessly for his election."
In his brief letter of resignation, Butz
told Ford, "I sincerely apologize for
any offense that may have been caused
by the unfortunate choice of language
used in a recent conversation and re
ported publicly."
In the prepared statement read in the
press room, Butz again apologized for
his "indiscretion" and said he was res
igning to save Ford further harm.
"By taking this action I hope to re
move even the appearance of racism as
an issue in the Ford campaign," Butz
said. But there were quick indications
that Democrats would not let the issue
die that easily. Carter said Ford should
