# Profs: Mao's death won't change China
## 
### Kath Scanlon 
Since the death last month of Mao
Tse-tung, political head of the People's
Republic of China since 1949, no
leader has been officially chosen to fill
his office.
Three Stanford professors agree that
his death will have little effect, at least
in the near future, on both China's
domestic policies and on her relations
with the U.S.
"There will be no immediate, obvi
ous power struggle," said Assoc. His
tory Prof. Lyman VanSlyke.
"Nobody will be willing to under
take such a bold struggle for power,"
he said.
According to Political Science Prof.
Robert North, any struggles that may
occur would probably be over policy
rather than leadership.
China "will continue along not
too-different lines than in the past,"
sa : d North.
Mark Mancall, associate history pro
fessor, noted that, "There is little
rumbling of major upheavals (and
there is) less instability (in China) than
one might expect." He said, that while
we may witness a gradual modifica
tion of extremist positions and find the
Chinese placing less emphasis on rad
ical rhetoric, there will not necessarily
be any "profound change for a while."
"New personalities haven't yet
emerged to take the place of Mao Tse
tung," said Mancall.
None of the professors interviewed

said they saw any immediate change
in Sino-U.S. relations.
Future change will have "more to do
with our (presidential) elections (than
with the death of Mao)," said Mancall.
"It depends on the foreign policy of
the next administration. We can pur
sue detente with the Soviet Union or
pursue relations with China to the de
triment of relations with the Soviet
Union," said Mancall.
"We may know after the debate (be
tween President Gerald Ford and
Jimmy Carter) Wednesday night, but
Carter appears to be not quite as en
thusiastic as Kissinger about detente.
"It's hard to say, but (if Carter were
elected) this may better our relations
with China," he said.
According to VanSlyke, "China
pretty much controls what they want
to get out of the U.S. It's an off-and-on
policy. They may signal us with trade
or their reaction toward our relations
with Taiwan that they're not happy
with the situation."
"The Soviet Union and China are
engaged in a struggle for influence
within the non-capitalist world and, to
some extent, the Third World," said
North.
The Chinese attitude toward the
U.S. depends to a certain extent on the
U.S.S.R. and what happens in the
Soviet Union's relations with China,
he added.
"In the future, in general, things will
move along very much as in the past,"
said North.
