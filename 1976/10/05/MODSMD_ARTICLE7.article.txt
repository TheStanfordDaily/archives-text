## Opinions Justice vs. freedom 
### 
Michele Hannoosh

In her column entitled "Forced
feminism creates injustice" (Daily,
Sept. 30), Ann Sherman has failed to
acknowledge the real basis of her ar
gument that justice does not require
the acceptance of feminism. Specifi
cally, she has confused justice and
freedom, concepts which are often in
irreconciliable conflict.
Sherman presents us with the
example of a woman off ered a position
as garbage collector. She maintains
that it would not be unjust to believe
that men and women were not equally
qualified for the job.
I must take issue with this position.
If we take the definition of feminism
given in Sherman's article, i.e. "that
men and women are mentally and so
cially equal, and that women should
be given every social freedom, advan
tage and opportunity enjoyed by
men," we are obliged to conclude that
it would indeed be unjust to believe
otherwise.
Justice is fairness. To refuse equality
of the sexes is to show partiality to
wards one of them over the other. And

this inequity is the very making of in
justice.
Sherman's definition of justice as
merely "requiring the chance to
choose between ideologies" is a mis
representation of the term. What she
has in mind is closer to the notion of
freedom.
We are traditionally a society which
supports liberty.
However, when this committment
prevents others from enjoying their
privileges, the two groups come into
conflict. At that point, a choice has to
be made between freedom and justice.
It is not an injustice to require the
acceptance of feminism as it has been
defined above. We all have a right to
choose our own philosophy, even if it
rejects feminist beliefs. This right,
however, is assured us by our freedom
of choice and not by the concept of
justice.
Refusal of feminist ideals is unjust in
the same way that racial or ethnic dis
crimination is.
