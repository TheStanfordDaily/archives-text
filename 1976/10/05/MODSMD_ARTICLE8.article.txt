# Grant pardons to heal wounds

On March 7,1965 President Lyndon
Johnson ordered the first regular com
bat troops to Da Nang. on South Viet
nam's northern coast. Ostensibly
brought in to defend the huge allied air
base there, the 3500 marines found
themselves deployed in "dynamic de
fense" tactics, moving far out into the
field and engaging the Vietcong for the
first time.
With the American's troop strength
in South Vietnam and their financial
commitment to the war rising rapidly,
war protests and demands for peace
grew stronger at home.
Both sides began offering peace
negotiations, but the efforts got
nowhere.
Misgivings about the effectiveness
of the war began to be heard in official
circles as Secretary of Defense Robert
S. MacNamara conceded in July 1965,
that the military situation had de
teriorated since the coup against Mr.
Diem, the assassinated dictator.
President Johnson, pursuing a pol
icy seeking to "drive the North Viet
namese to the conference table," in
creased his calls for a negotiated set
tlement. offering $1 billion for recon
struction of both parts of Vietnam once
the war ended.
Eleven years later
That was 1965. Eleven years later the
United States has yet to give the now
united parts of Vietnam, which had
always been divided only by a line
drawn on a map, the $1 billion that as
early as 1965 was determined as
needed to rebuild the war-torn nation.
Again, in 1972, talk of reconstruct
ing the devastated country was heard.
As a corollary to the Paris Accords, for
which he shared the Nobel Peace
Prize, Henry Kissinger secretly
pledged $3.25 billion in reconstruc
tion aid that was to be given "without
prior political conditions."
And now it is 1976. It is estimated
that the war in Vietnam cost America
$352 billion. Thank god that at least in
strictly economic terms, that ghastly
expenditure was not wholly converted
into destroying the jungles and deltas
of North Vietnam. For now Hanoi re
quests a "mere" $12 to $15 billion in
funds to rebuild the country. We can
never begin to repay the human loss.
For the present, the forces of the
Provisional Revolutionary Gov
ernment (PRC) and those of the Na
tional Liberation Front (NLF) are busy
putting affairs back in order, without
any aid from their departed former
enemy. Revolutionary soldiers, or bo
doi patrol the street of Saigon,
"reeducation" classes for those previ
ously affiliated with the regime of
Nguyen Van Thieu are conducted, and
a gradual shift of refugees from city to
countryside has been instituted.
A reporter, who remained in Saigon
for three months after the communist
takeover, reports, "In certain respects.
Saigon has become a more pleasant
city than it was before, because, with
most inhabitants in the same boat
economically, a leveling process has

taken place, and those who never used
to speak to each other are now con
versing amiably on the streets and in
the cafes."
Hardship remains
Of course, great hardship remains
for the citizenry. Short of western
technology and with depleted domes
tic resources, it will take years to re
construct the bridges, roads and
buildings felled by American bombs.
The first priority of the communists, if
we can judge from their past acces
sions to power in other areas, will
probably be on restoring agricultural
production.
The rich Mekong delta is now pitted
with craters, and the effects of de
pleted rice growing capability are
being felt in the cities where some food
items are rationed. So that, briefly, is a
capsule picture of what Vietnam has
become in the postwar era.
Obviously, the new totalitarian re
gime may not be to our liking. But
basic human needs still cry out.
Does this nation, many of whose
people protested against the war, and
which now contains very few people
who admit they were ever for the
American intervention, demonstrate
any concern or pity for the people of
Vietnam?
Audacity
On the contrary, as recently as the
spring of 1975, when most of us per
ceived the heinous error that had been
made, President Gerald Ford had the
audacity to ask for $1 billion more dol
lars to aid the corrupt and hopeless
Thieu regime. The American diploma
tic mission was to flee the country only
days later on April 30, 1975.
It is sadly true that we cannot re
deem the lives of 56,717 Americans,
180,000 South Vietnamese, and over
925,000 North Vietnamese, but there
are three things that are still crying out
to be done.
One, we can grant U.N. membership
to Vietnam. (Ambassador Scranton
vetoed their application for member
ship a few weeks ago. After all, Mr.
Ford needs American Legion votes on
November 2.)
Two, for a nation that spends over
$100 billion for "defense," we should
find it in our hearts to allocate $15
billion for the reconstruction of the
new Vietnam.
And finally, we should resolve to
heal our own gaping wounds: A blan
ket pardon should be granted to all
those young men, who out of consci
ence decided not to partake in the car
nage in Southeast Asia. This measure
is necessary because the Ford program
failed to reach many of these people,
due to what one administrator termed
"inevitably inconsistent and dis
criminatory" standards.
After the Tet Attack of February
1968, an American officer remarked,
"We had to destroy it in order to save
it." Now it is time to remember and
rebuild it.
