Paul McCloskey Jr., Republican in
cumbent running for his fifth term in
the U.S. House, said last night the next
Congressional session "will be the first
time in my memory that we will have
an honestly led Congress."
McCloskey, who appeared for in
formal question-and-answer sessions
at Toyon and Delta Kappa Epsilon,
noted that many congressmen had res
igned or retired and said that next ses
sion's officials "will be predominantly
young, idealistic, honorable people."
McCloskey said he is still undecided
as to who he will support in the presi
dential elections.
"One reason I've backed away from
Carter is that at first he was very
idealistic, but then he began to cope
with his own party and their platform.
"1 was ready to support him (Carter),
but then 1 read his acceptance speech,
and you cannot find out what he's
going to do," McCloskey said.
"I've been very, very disappointed
with Jerry Ford. I like him personally
— I'd even say I love the guy. He's not
very bright, but he's one of the most
decent men in.politics.
"But I disagree with him on every
thing — abortion, Vietnam — he just
totally wrecked what (Henry) Kis
singer was trying to do in Vietnam.
"The scariest thing I can think of is if
there's a Middle East war and we go to
the assistance of Israel and the Arabs
slap on that (oil) embargo. We now
have one-half of our oil under em

bargo. There is the very real threat of
going to war," he said. •
"I'll put it bluntly: the Jewish consti
tuency gives so much money to my
colleagues in the House that we are
distorted in our Congressional reac
tion to Middle East problems,"
McCloskey said.
"Kissinger had done a super job. I
may not always agree with him, but
he's done a great job in the Middle
East. But the Israelis must be more wil
ling to*talk to the FLO (if we are to
achieve peace in the Middle East)."
On domestic issues, McCloskey said
he favors more energy conservation
measures, but added, "It will take
another embargo, or the threat of one,
before Congress gets serious on energy
control."
He outlined his plan for the modifi
cation of the income tax structure, say
ing, "There should be a single tax,
with the only deduction being for
charity. Perhaps no tax at all for those
who earn $10,000 a year or less, or a
negative tax for the really poor."
McCloskey was asked whether he
thought he was losing support in the
Stanford community to challenger
David Harris.
"Students ordinarily are in favor of
he who challenges the system. But I
wish the Stanford student body could
hear Harris debate in front of a crowd
in Palo Alto or Mountain View. What
was it he once said? That he was 1/3
anarchist, 1/3 socialist and 1/3 pacifist.
You don't hear a word of those now."
