# Ford 'bland but honest' image false

In the 19th century, P.T. Barnum
took advantage of the media's gullibil
ity by flooding eastern newspapers
with letters from alleged experts attest
ing to the authenticity of a mermaid,
which happened to be part of a Bar
num exhibition on its way up to New
York.
The papers fell for the letters hook,
line, and sinker, so to speak. The Fiji
mermaid, of course, turned out to be a
monkey's torso grafted oato a fish's
tail.
In 1976, the American media is
probably too sophisticated to fall for a
hoax like the mermaid: however, it is
not above being taken. Unfortunately,
this time the hoaxer is not just trying to
make a quick buck; he's running for
president.
The Ford campaign is selling its
candidate like a political graham
cracker: bland but honest. Just as the
newspapers need only to have con
nected Barnum's past exploits with his
relationship to the exhibition, the
media in 1976 needs only to graft the
monkey's head of Ford's attempt to
impeach Justice William O. Douglas in
1970 with the fishy tale of his reaction
to the Nixon impeachment to see
through his integrity sham.
Biggest embarassment
Before Watergate, perhaps the
biggest embarrassment suffered by the
Nixon administration was Congress's
rejection of two of Nixon's Supreme
Court nominees, a pair of conservative
southern judges named Clement
Haynsworth and Harold Carswell.
Relying on the theory that the public
is more interested in accusations than
refutations, Ford initiated impeach
ment proceedings, the most serious ac

tion which can be taken against a high
official, against Justice Douglas, who
not coincidentally was the most liberal
justice on the court. Perhaps the best
measure of the high degree of serious
ness with which Ford treated his grave
accusations against Justice Douglas
was his refusal, after introducing the
motion, to present specific charges
when challenged to do so by Rep. Paul
Jacobs.
Pressing on
Despite this, Ford pressed on with
the impeachment. It was at this point
that Ford, the strict constructionist,
came up with his creative definition of
impeachable offense: "whatever a
majority of the House of Representa
tives considers it to be at a given mo
ment in history."
Apparently Ford forgot to consult
the Constitution on this matter. Article
11, Section 4 defines impeachable of
fenses as "treason, bribery or other
high crimes and misdemeanors."
Eventually, Rep. Phillip VVyman
wrote up a set of charges and a con
gressional sub-committee was as
signed to investigate them. Ford
makes a habit of chiding Congress for
its prodigal ways, but in this case he
was not averse to wasting his fellow
representatives' time and the tax
payers' money.
Shady connections
The main charges against Douglas
focused on his connections with the
Parvin foundation, a philanthropic or
ganization. The VVyman resolution ac
cused Douglas of having a financial
connection with an outside institu
tion.
Douglas was in fact receiving a
$12,000 salary from the foundation;

however, Douglas had earlier refused a
higher salary to serve as president of
the foundation, after which the board
voted him a salary of $12,000 plus ex
penses. Douglas refused to collect ex
penses and said he would treat the sal
ary as an expense account.
Later, in confirmation hearings for
Nixon appointees, Harry Blackmun
and Warren Burger, both admitted to
having received outside income while
on the bench. Oddly, Ford did not pro
test either confirmation.
The second Parvin charge alleged
that Douglas had drafted articles of in
corporation for Parvin, hence practic
ing law while sitting as a federal judge.
The sub-committee turned up conclu
sive evidence that this was not true.
Douglas' book
Other charges centered around
Douglas' book Points of Rebellion.
Ford grudgingly admitted "the first
amendment protects his right to print
this drivel. .. but, I wonder if it can be
deemed 'good behavior' in the con
stitutional sense for such a distorted
diatribe against the Government of the
United States to be published, indeed
publicly autographed and promoted,
by an Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court."
Unlike Ford, the subcommittee read
the book and found that rather than
advocating violence, Douglas had ar
gued that violence was inevitable un
less there was a national reordering of
priorities.
The sub-committee found the quota
tions from the Douglas book contained
in the Wyman resolution to be out of
context and out of order.
Selling rights
Douglas was also accused of selling
reproduction rights to parts of his book
to a pornographic magazine, Everg
reen Review, which was somewhat
less obscene than the Nixon tapes. As
it turned out, Douglas' publishing
house had sold the rights to Evergreen
without Douglas' knowledge.
For someone who praises the
American system. Ford seems to show
little respect for its institutions. Any
man who played political hatchet
man, even if it was for the president,
can hardly be called a man of high
integrity.
Ford's actions with respect to the
Nixon impeachment are curiously in
consistent with his actions during the

Douglas impeachment. While he con
demned Douglas' outspoken political
views which called for such policies as
recognition of China and detente with
the Soviet Union, Ford never once
publicly condemned the Nixon ad
ministration for its campaign slush
funds, breakings and enterings, and
coverups.
Paling in comparison
Douglas's innocent acceptance of
$12,000 from a philanthropic organi
zations pales in comparison with Ni
xon's $150,000 illegal tax write-offs;
yet, until the end Ford professed faith
in Nixon's complete innocence.
As for the Nixon pardon, Ford's in
tegrity is easily exceeded by his oppor
tunism. In his confirmation hearings
Ford was asked by Chairman Cannon,
"Do you believe that a president can
legally prevent or terminate any crimi
nal investigation or prosecution in
volving the president?"
Ford answered under oath, "1 do not
think he should."
Ford defended his later reversal by
saying that when he had answered the
question, he had been dealing in
hypothetical (Ron Ziegler had dibs on
"I misspoke myself"). One has to won
der how difficult Ford's confirmation
might have been had he said that he
was planning to pardon Nixon.
Within power
Ford, who established his creden
tials as a constitutional scholar with
the Douglas impeachment, claimed
that the pardon was entirely within his
power. Curiously, his speech proc
laiming the pardon did not cite the
entire constitutional pardon provi
sions which grant the president the
power to pardon "except in cases of
impeachment."
Although impeachment proceed
ings had been dropped after the Nixon
resignation, the fact remains that
Nixon had been indicted for high
crimes and misdemeanors by Con
gress. The only precedents for Ford's
proclamation pardon of Nixon were in
cases of post-war amnesties.
Now that Ford's version of the Fiji
Mermaid has been exposed, let us re
member and hope. Let us remember
Barnum's maxim, "There's a sucker
born every minute" and let us hope
that too many of them don't go to the
polls in November.
