# Assistant Dean for Women
## Kaplan dedicates her life to helping others 
### Barbara Anscher 
When Stanford University's
Leah Kaplan was appointed as
sistant dean of student affairs for
women students in 1974, she
had to face some skeptical mem
bers of the Committee on Educa
tion and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
According to Asst. Provost
Amy Blue, then the chairperson
of CEEW, several of the members
were young activists who feared
the 55-year old mother of two
would merely be an instrument
of the administration.
It only took one meeting with
the CEEW to erase any traces of
skepticism.
The women were won over

because "she was honest to the
committee," says Blue. "If she
did not know the answer to a
question, she was willing to say
I don't know.' "
That kind of frankness and in
sight in dealing with people led
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons to appoint Kaplan assis
tant dean. "She was chosen not
because she had the answers, but
because of her unusual capacity
to listen well and to help others
listen to each other," says Lyons.
Trained to listen
As a part-time psychiatric so
cial worker for the counseling
and psychological services de
partment of Cowell Student
Health Center, Kaplan has been
trained to listen to people. Yet
when talking to her, one gets the
feeling that she listens to people
because she enjoys it. Helping
people is Leah Kaplan's main in

terest and has been for many
years.
When she decided to become a
psychiatric social worker almost
30 years ago, Kaplan knew she
wanted to focus on people, to be
available to others.
She had been an international
relations major as an under
graduate at the University of
Chicago and the University of
Minnesota. But, she says, "You
can study political systems all
you want — people are what
make them work or not work."
Commute
She was dedicated enough to
her ideals to enroll in an inten
sive training program in
psychiatric social work at Smith

College, forcing her to commute
between her New Haven, Conn,
home and Massachusetts. She
was able to see her husband. Dr.
Henry Kaplan, only on
weekends.
After finishing her training
and working in New Haven and
Washington, D.C., she followed
her husband here. Although she
was working on a part-time basis
in San Francisco, Kaplan consi
dered Stanford life one of her
concerns.
Noticing that the student
health center lacked non
medical counselors and had
only one psychiatrist, she wor
ried student needs could not be
met. She volunteered to check
out the center and eventually
began working part-time with
out pay.
A year and a half later, grants
began to come into Cowell, and

Kaplan became a salaried staff
member.
Privilege
That was 15 years ago, and
Kaplan still considers it a
privilege to help Stanford stu

dents.
"I was really pleased when
one student told me 'You're like

a professional friend,' " she says,
explaining that she tries hard to
avoid the cold, clinical
stereotype of the social worker.
A soft-spoken, cheerful wo
man, she converses in a low-key

manner to patients and peers
alike, a tactic which makes one
feel like her equal. "Leah has

great sincerity, which is unusual
for elegant women, and she is an
elegant woman," says Varda
Ganz, a psychiatrist and clinical
coordinator of psychological
services at Cowell.
Despite her outward cheerful
ness, Kaplan's counseling work
is not always low-key. She ad
mits that "It is very painful to see
a young person decompensate
(become unable to function in
everyday situations)." Even with
professional training, "you are
not a machine, so you care and
are sensitive to the hurts people
go through."

The same quiet caring and un
pretentiousness which enables
her to listen to troubled students
at Cowell can be seen in Leah
Kaplan the assistant dean.
In speaking of the CEEW and
other women's groups, Kaplan
says,"I was more of a fighter
than they thought I'd be, but I
did it in my own way." Her way

is to make people aware that
problems exist, not to openly
demand immediate action.
"Women have to learn how to
relate to men and men have to
learn to accept women," she
says. "You don't achieve that by
attacking men and getting angry
with them. Instead you ask them
how they could feel if they were
in that situation."
"You don't meet anger with
anger," she adds. Instead, she
says wryly that her weapons are
"gentle guilt-instilling tactics
and arm-twisting."
"She's a constant nuisance in
staff meetings." says Lyons, "but
that is why she's there."
He adds that her persistence
makes her effective, but that her
success can be attributed even
more so to the fact that "she is
not self-serving. She's other
serving."
Home life
One would think that after de
aling with other people's prob
lems all day, she might want
some attention herself when she
gets home. But Kaplan says that
her two careers have helped her
be a better wife and mother.
"My husband's time is heavily
committed (he is an eminent
professor of radiology at the
medical school) and if I didn't

have something to do, I'd be
come a terrible nag. It's a help to
him that I have an interest that is
satisfying to me," she says.
She and her husband often
spend their time together col
lecting art, going to the theater,
and traveling. Her children,
Ann, 25 and Paul. 23, no longer
live at home.

She jokes about how her hob
bies do not ways seem logically
suited to her character. "I took an
art class once, but I kept getting
mad when my projects didn't
turn out the way I wanted them
to. My teacher kept saying, 'You
think too much.' Instead of a re
laxation, it became a frustration
to me."
Even when relaxing, Leah
Kaplan cannot separate herself
from her work easily. When her
family took a trip to Africa, she
says that "My kids and my hus
band loved it for the animals. I
loved it for the people. While
they took pictures, I talked to our
driver, asking him about his fam
ily and his village. My family
kidded me about being the social
worker."
Kaplan asks questions to give
people opportunities to open up
to her. "People can always pro
tect themselves if they don't
want to answer. If they're
genuinely interested, they'll re
spond." she says.
She should know, for accord
ing to her colleagues,, there are
few people more genuinely in
terested than Leah Kaplan. As
Amy Blue says, "She's every
body's friend. I have yet to meet
anyone who has a harsh thing to
say about Leah Kaplan."

"She was chosen not because she had the answers, but
because of her unusual capacity to listen well and to help
others listen to each other."

. . . she tries hard to avoid the cold, clinical stereotype of

"I was more of a fighter than they thought I d be, but I did it

Henry Kaplan, only on
weekends.
After finishing her training
and working in New Haven and
Washington, D.C., she followed
her husband here. Although she
was working on a part-time basis
in San Francisco, Kaplan consi
dered Stanford life one of her
concerns.
Noticing that the student
health center lacked non
medical counselors and had
only one psychiatrist, she wor
ried student needs could not be
met. She volunteered to check
out the center and eventually
began working part-time with
out pay.
A year and a half later, grants
began to come into Cowell, and

Kaplan became a salaried staff
member.
Privilege
That was 15 years ago, and
Kaplan still considers it a
privilege to help Stanford stu

dents.
"I was really pleased when
one student told me 'You're like

a professional friend,' " she says,
explaining that she tries hard to
avoid the cold, clinical
stereotype of the social worker.
A soft-spoken, cheerful wo
man, she converses in a low-key

manner to patients and peers
alike, a tactic which makes one
feel like her equal. "Leah has

great sincerity, which is unusual
for elegant women, and she is an
elegant woman," says Varda
Ganz, a psychiatrist and clinical
coordinator of psychological
services at Cowell.
Despite her outward cheerful
ness, Kaplan's counseling work
is not always low-key. She ad
mits that "It is very painful to see
a young person decompensate
(become unable to function in
everyday situations)." Even with
professional training, "you are
not a machine, so you care and
are sensitive to the hurts people
go through."

The same quiet caring and un
pretentiousness which enables
her to listen to troubled students
at Cowell can be seen in Leah
Kaplan the assistant dean.
In speaking of the CEEW and
other women's groups, Kaplan
says,"I was more of a fighter
than they thought I'd be, but I
did it in my own way." Her way

is to make people aware that
problems exist, not to openly
demand immediate action.
"Women have to learn how to
relate to men and men have to
learn to accept women," she
says. "You don't achieve that by
attacking men and getting angry
with them. Instead you ask them
how they could feel if they were
in that situation."
"You don't meet anger with
anger," she adds. Instead, she
says wryly that her weapons are
"gentle guilt-instilling tactics
and arm-twisting."
"She's a constant nuisance in
staff meetings." says Lyons, "but
that is why she's there."
He adds that her persistence
makes her effective, but that her
success can be attributed even
more so to the fact that "she is
not self-serving. She's other
serving."
Home life
One would think that after de
aling with other people's prob
lems all day, she might want
some attention herself when she
gets home. But Kaplan says that
her two careers have helped her
be a better wife and mother.
"My husband's time is heavily
committed (he is an eminent
professor of radiology at the
medical school) and if I didn't

have something to do, I'd be
come a terrible nag. It's a help to
him that I have an interest that is
satisfying to me," she says.
She and her husband often
spend their time together col
lecting art, going to the theater,
and traveling. Her children,
Ann, 25 and Paul. 23, no longer
live at home.

She jokes about how her hob
bies do not ways seem logically
suited to her character. "I took an
art class once, but I kept getting
mad when my projects didn't
turn out the way I wanted them
to. My teacher kept saying, 'You
think too much.' Instead of a re
laxation, it became a frustration
to me."
Even when relaxing, Leah
Kaplan cannot separate herself
from her work easily. When her
family took a trip to Africa, she
says that "My kids and my hus
band loved it for the animals. I
loved it for the people. While
they took pictures, I talked to our
driver, asking him about his fam
ily and his village. My family
kidded me about being the social
worker."
Kaplan asks questions to give
people opportunities to open up
to her. "People can always pro
tect themselves if they don't
want to answer. If they're
genuinely interested, they'll re
spond." she says.
She should know, for accord
ing to her colleagues,, there are
few people more genuinely in
terested than Leah Kaplan. As
Amy Blue says, "She's every
body's friend. I have yet to meet
anyone who has a harsh thing to
say about Leah Kaplan."

"She was chosen not because she had the answers, but
because of her unusual capacity to listen well and to help
others listen to each other."

. . . she tries hard to avoid the cold, clinical stereotype of
the social worker.

"I was more of a fighter than they thought I d be, but I did it

Leah Kaplan
When Stanford University's
Leah Kaplan was appointed as
sistant dean of student affairs for
women students in 1974, she
had to face some skeptical mem
bers of the Committee on Educa
tion and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
According to Asst. Provost
Amy Blue, then the chairperson
of CEEW, several of the members
were young activists who feared
the 55-year old mother of two
would merely be an instrument
of the administration.
It only took one meeting with
the CEEW to erase any traces of
skepticism.
The women were won over

because "she was honest to the
committee," says Blue. "If she
did not know the answer to a
question, she was willing to say
I don't know.' "
That kind of frankness and in
sight in dealing with people led
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons to appoint Kaplan assis
tant dean. "She was chosen not
because she had the answers, but
because of her unusual capacity
to listen well and to help others
listen to each other," says Lyons.

trained to listen to people. Yet
when talking to her, one gets the
feeling that she listens to people
because she enjoys it. Helping
people is Leah Kaplan's main in

terest and has been for many
years.
When she decided to become a
psychiatric social worker almost
30 years ago, Kaplan knew she
wanted to focus on people, to be
available to others.
She had been an international
relations major as an under
graduate at the University of
Chicago and the University of
Minnesota. But, she says, "You
can study political systems all
you want — people are what
make them work or not work."
Commute
She was dedicated enough to
her ideals to enroll in an inten
sive training program in
psychiatric social work at Smith

College, forcing her to commute
between her New Haven, Conn,
home and Massachusetts. She
was able to see her husband. Dr.
Henry Kaplan, only on

relate to men and men have to
learn to accept women," she
says. "You don't achieve that by
attacking men and getting angry
with them. Instead you ask them
how they could feel if they were
in that situation."
"You don't meet anger with
anger," she adds. Instead, she
says wryly that her weapons are
"gentle guilt-instilling tactics
and arm-twisting."
"She's a constant nuisance in
staff meetings." says Lyons, "but
that is why she's there."
He adds that her persistence
makes her effective, but that her
success can be attributed even
more so to the fact that "she is
not self-serving. She's other
serving."
Home life
One would think that after de
aling with other people's prob
lems all day, she might want
some attention herself when she
gets home. But Kaplan says that
her two careers have helped her
be a better wife and mother.
"My husband's time is heavily
committed (he is an eminent
professor of radiology at the
medical school) and if I didn't

have something to do, I'd be
come a terrible nag. It's a help to
him that I have an interest that is
satisfying to me," she says.
She and her husband often
spend their time together col
lecting art, going to the theater,
and traveling. Her children,
Ann, 25 and Paul. 23, no longer
live at home.

She jokes about how her hob
bies do not ways seem logically
suited to her character. "I took an
art class once, but I kept getting
mad when my projects didn't
turn out the way I wanted them
to. My teacher kept saying, 'You
think too much.' Instead of a re
laxation, it became a frustration
to me."
Even when relaxing, Leah
Kaplan cannot separate herself
from her work easily. When her
family took a trip to Africa, she
says that "My kids and my hus
band loved it for the animals. I
loved it for the people. While
they took pictures, I talked to our
driver, asking him about his fam
ily and his village. My family
kidded me about being the social
worker."
Kaplan asks questions to give
people opportunities to open up
to her. "People can always pro
tect themselves if they don't
want to answer. If they're
genuinely interested, they'll re
spond." she says.
She should know, for accord
ing to her colleagues,, there are
few people more genuinely in
terested than Leah Kaplan. As
Amy Blue says, "She's every
body's friend. I have yet to meet
anyone who has a harsh thing to
say about Leah Kaplan."

"She was chosen not because she had the answers, but
because of her unusual capacity to listen well and to help
others listen to each other."

. . . she tries hard to avoid the cold, clinical stereotype of
the social worker.

"I was more of a fighter than they thought I d be, but I did it
my own way."

Leah Kaplan
When Stanford University's
Leah Kaplan was appointed as
sistant dean of student affairs for
women students in 1974, she
had to face some skeptical mem
bers of the Committee on Educa
tion and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
According to Asst. Provost
Amy Blue, then the chairperson
of CEEW, several of the members
were young activists who feared
the 55-year old mother of two
would merely be an instrument
of the administration.
It only took one meeting with
the CEEW to erase any traces of
skepticism.
The women were won over

because "she was honest to the
committee," says Blue. "If she
did not know the answer to a
question, she was willing to say
I don't know.' "
That kind of frankness and in
sight in dealing with people led
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons to appoint Kaplan assis
tant dean. "She was chosen not
because she had the answers, but
because of her unusual capacity
to listen well and to help others
listen to each other," says Lyons.
Trained to listen
As a part-time psychiatric so
cial worker for the counseling
and psychological services de
partment of Cowell Student
Health Center, Kaplan has been
trained to listen to people. Yet
when talking to her, one gets the
feeling that she listens to people
because she enjoys it. Helping
people is Leah Kaplan's main in

terest and has been for many
years.
When she decided to become a
psychiatric social worker almost
30 years ago, Kaplan knew she
wanted to focus on people, to be
available to others.
She had been an international
relations major as an under
graduate at the University of
Chicago and the University of
Minnesota. But, she says, "You
can study political systems all
you want — people are what
make them work or not work."
Commute
She was dedicated enough to
her ideals to enroll in an inten
sive training program in
psychiatric social work at Smith

College, forcing her to commute
between her New Haven, Conn,
home and Massachusetts. She
was able to see her husband. Dr.
Henry Kaplan, only on
weekends.
After finishing her training
and working in New Haven and
Washington, D.C., she followed
her husband here. Although she
was working on a part-time basis
in San Francisco, Kaplan consi
dered Stanford life one of her
concerns.
Noticing that the student
health center lacked non
medical counselors and had
only one psychiatrist, she wor
ried student needs could not be
met. She volunteered to check
out the center and eventually
began working part-time with
out pay.
A year and a half later, grants
began to come into Cowell, and

Kaplan became a salaried staff
member.
Privilege
That was 15 years ago, and
Kaplan still considers it a
privilege to help Stanford stu

dents.
"I was really pleased when
one student told me 'You're like

a professional friend,' " she says,
explaining that she tries hard to
avoid the cold, clinical
stereotype of the social worker.
A soft-spoken, cheerful wo
man, she converses in a low-key

manner to patients and peers
alike, a tactic which makes one
feel like her equal. "Leah has

great sincerity, which is unusual
for elegant women, and she is an
elegant woman," says Varda
Ganz, a psychiatrist and clinical
coordinator of psychological
services at Cowell.
Despite her outward cheerful
ness, Kaplan's counseling work
is not always low-key. She ad
mits that "It is very painful to see
a young person decompensate
(become unable to function in
everyday situations)." Even with
professional training, "you are
not a machine, so you care and
are sensitive to the hurts people
go through."

The same quiet caring and un
pretentiousness which enables
her to listen to troubled students
at Cowell can be seen in Leah
Kaplan the assistant dean.
In speaking of the CEEW and
other women's groups, Kaplan
says,"I was more of a fighter
than they thought I'd be, but I
did it in my own way." Her way

is to make people aware that
problems exist, not to openly
demand immediate action.
"Women have to learn how to
relate to men and men have to
learn to accept women," she
says. "You don't achieve that by
attacking men and getting angry
with them. Instead you ask them
how they could feel if they were

kidded me about being the social
worker."
Kaplan asks questions to give
people opportunities to open up
to her. "People can always pro
tect themselves if they don't
want to answer. If they're
genuinely interested, they'll re
spond." she says.
She should know, for accord
ing to her colleagues,, there are
few people more genuinely in
terested than Leah Kaplan. As
Amy Blue says, "She's every
body's friend. I have yet to meet
anyone who has a harsh thing to
say about Leah Kaplan."

"She was chosen not because she had the answers, but
because of her unusual capacity to listen well and to help
others listen to each other."

. . . she tries hard to avoid the cold, clinical stereotype of
the social worker.

"I was more of a fighter than they thought I d be, but I did it
my own way."

Leah Kaplan
When Stanford University's
Leah Kaplan was appointed as
sistant dean of student affairs for
women students in 1974, she
had to face some skeptical mem
bers of the Committee on Educa
tion and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
According to Asst. Provost
Amy Blue, then the chairperson
of CEEW, several of the members
were young activists who feared
the 55-year old mother of two
would merely be an instrument
of the administration.
It only took one meeting with
the CEEW to erase any traces of
skepticism.
The women were won over

because "she was honest to the
committee," says Blue. "If she
did not know the answer to a
question, she was willing to say
I don't know.' "
That kind of frankness and in
sight in dealing with people led
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons to appoint Kaplan assis
tant dean. "She was chosen not
because she had the answers, but
because of her unusual capacity
to listen well and to help others
listen to each other," says Lyons.
Trained to listen
As a part-time psychiatric so
cial worker for the counseling
and psychological services de
partment of Cowell Student
Health Center, Kaplan has been
trained to listen to people. Yet
when talking to her, one gets the
feeling that she listens to people
because she enjoys it. Helping
people is Leah Kaplan's main in

terest and has been for many
years.
When she decided to become a
psychiatric social worker almost
30 years ago, Kaplan knew she
wanted to focus on people, to be
available to others.
She had been an international
relations major as an under
graduate at the University of
Chicago and the University of
Minnesota. But, she says, "You
can study political systems all
you want — people are what
make them work or not work."
Commute
She was dedicated enough to
her ideals to enroll in an inten
sive training program in
psychiatric social work at Smith

College, forcing her to commute
between her New Haven, Conn,
home and Massachusetts. She
was able to see her husband. Dr.
Henry Kaplan, only on
weekends.
After finishing her training
and working in New Haven and
Washington, D.C., she followed
her husband here. Although she
was working on a part-time basis
in San Francisco, Kaplan consi
dered Stanford life one of her
concerns.
Noticing that the student
health center lacked non
medical counselors and had
only one psychiatrist, she wor
ried student needs could not be
met. She volunteered to check
out the center and eventually
began working part-time with
out pay.
A year and a half later, grants
began to come into Cowell, and

Kaplan became a salaried staff
member.
Privilege
That was 15 years ago, and
Kaplan still considers it a
privilege to help Stanford stu

dents.
"I was really pleased when
one student told me 'You're like

a professional friend,' " she says,
explaining that she tries hard to
avoid the cold, clinical
stereotype of the social worker.
A soft-spoken, cheerful wo
man, she converses in a low-key

manner to patients and peers
alike, a tactic which makes one
feel like her equal. "Leah has

great sincerity, which is unusual
for elegant women, and she is an
elegant woman," says Varda
Ganz, a psychiatrist and clinical
coordinator of psychological
services at Cowell.
Despite her outward cheerful
ness, Kaplan's counseling work
is not always low-key. She ad
mits that "It is very painful to see
a young person decompensate
(become unable to function in
everyday situations)." Even with
professional training, "you are
not a machine, so you care and
are sensitive to the hurts people
go through."

The same quiet caring and un
pretentiousness which enables
her to listen to troubled students
at Cowell can be seen in Leah
Kaplan the assistant dean.
In speaking of the CEEW and
other women's groups, Kaplan
says,"I was more of a fighter
than they thought I'd be, but I
did it in my own way." Her way

is to make people aware that
problems exist, not to openly
demand immediate action.
"Women have to learn how to
relate to men and men have to
learn to accept women," she
says. "You don't achieve that by
attacking men and getting angry
with them. Instead you ask them
how they could feel if they were
in that situation."
"You don't meet anger with
anger," she adds. Instead, she
says wryly that her weapons are
"gentle guilt-instilling tactics
and arm-twisting."
"She's a constant nuisance in
staff meetings." says Lyons, "but
that is why she's there."
He adds that her persistence
makes her effective, but that her
success can be attributed even
more so to the fact that "she is
not self-serving. She's other
serving."
Home life
One would think that after de
aling with other people's prob
lems all day, she might want
some attention herself when she
gets home. But Kaplan says that
her two careers have helped her
be a better wife and mother.
"My husband's time is heavily
committed (he is an eminent
professor of radiology at the
medical school) and if I didn't

have something to do, I'd be
come a terrible nag. It's a help to
him that I have an interest that is
satisfying to me," she says.
She and her husband often
spend their time together col
lecting art, going to the theater,
and traveling. Her children,
Ann, 25 and Paul. 23, no longer
live at home.

She jokes about how her hob
bies do not ways seem logically
suited to her character. "I took an
art class once, but I kept getting
mad when my projects didn't
turn out the way I wanted them
to. My teacher kept saying, 'You
think too much.' Instead of a re
laxation, it became a frustration
to me."
Even when relaxing, Leah
Kaplan cannot separate herself
from her work easily. When her
family took a trip to Africa, she
says that "My kids and my hus
band loved it for the animals. I
loved it for the people. While
they took pictures, I talked to our
driver, asking him about his fam
ily and his village. My family
kidded me about being the social
worker."
Kaplan asks questions to give
people opportunities to open up
to her. "People can always pro
tect themselves if they don't
want to answer. If they're
genuinely interested, they'll re
spond." she says.
