# Jordan's 'drug' image scares off some here
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
Jordan House members are dis
covering that its lingering repu
tation as a "drug house" has ap
parently kept some students
away.
"It came as kind of a shock,"
said Lisa Dwyer, a senior and a
house associate in Jordan House,
when Jordan , a "special prior
ity" Rowhouse, fell 10 spaces
short in the first round of the
draw last spring, although sub
sequently, she said, "there was
no difficulty filling the spaces."
"1 think the poor condition of
the house has a lot to do with
coming up ten spaces short,"
said Dave Seidenwurm, house
manager of the co-op, which is
located at 620 Mayfield Ave.
"The furniture in the living
room last year was abysmal. It
was falling apart—you had to
have two people on each end of
one of the couches we had in
order to stabilize it, because it
only had legs in the middle,"
Seidenwurm said.
Seidenwurm also noted the
lack of a garbage disposal unit
and vacuum cleaner, inadequate
freezer space, not enough dining
room chairs, the warped floor in
the front hall, and cracked plas
ter in many parts of the house as
examples of Jordan's poor condi
tion.
Lingering reputation
Living with.a reputation as a
"drug house" does not help the
situation at all, according to Jor
dan residents.
"Seniors in the house who
graduated last year asked, 'Are
you into coke?' to scare off the
people they didn't like —just for
kicks. 1 don't think Jordan is a
'drug theme house.' Now no
body wants that—everyone's
more conservative—but we're

still stuck with the reputation of
five years ago." said Dwyer.
"In the past, we had more
hard-core craziness than in other
co-ops," said Seidenwurm.
'Dogs, drugs, dirt'
"The Row Office is conscious
of Jordan's reputation and it has
influenced our attitude towards
them in terms of our concern for
the house," said Karen Murray,
acting director of the Row.
"When I was discussing wait
ing list options with students
last spring, two or three specifi
cally excluded Jordan because of
a situation that could be charac
terized as dogs, drugs and dirt,"
Murray said.
A basic problem facing the
special priority houses in gen
eral is the lack of a list of specific
maintenance responsibilities be
tween the houses and the Row
Office, Murray pointed out.
"One of the main reasons for
the creation of the new position
of assistant director of the Row
this year was for the develop
ment of standardized proce
dures that will eliminate the sort
of grey area that exists now as far
as maintenance goes." she said.
"Tom (Hornbeak) is there to
expedite maintenance requests,
and also to serve in an educa
tional role, acting as a consultant
for house managers," said Mur
ray.
"The University isn't living
up to its maintenance respon
sibilities in the sense that people
who move in each year don't get
a house in good condition," said
Seidenwurm.
"It's hard to respect or main
tain a constructive attitude to
wards a place that has in
adequate facilities and is shab
bily maintained," he said.
