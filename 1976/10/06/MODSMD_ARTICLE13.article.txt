# Lack of Mars life may stymie program

Pasadena (AP) — In a single
summer's display of dazzling
space technology, a pair of
robots named Viking have told
man more about Mars than all
the stargazers and mythmakers
from the beginning of time. But
because no life was found on the
red planet, it may be quite a
while before America's next visit
there.
"If you find life, you might be
making a manned mission to
Mars before too long," said
NASA chief James Fletcher, as
sessing what the search for life
meant to the future of space exp
loration.

"But we weren't that lucky,
and I guess we'll just go on at a
normal pace."
Whether a "normal pace"
would take America to Mars
again soon is uncertain. Project
Manager James Martin believes
the U.S. will be going to Mars
again "in reasonably short or
der" — probably by 1985.
And Martin and most people
in the space program think the
next Mars lander should be
equipped with crawler tracks
and revised instruments based
on the findings of the first mis
sion.
"Imagine what we could see if

we could move around," goes
one often-heard pitch for a Vik
ing 3.
But another mission could
cost upward of $1 billion — the
cost of the current mission —
and some people in the space
program admit that without the
compelling sales point of life on
Mars, it might be difficult to get a
tight-fisted Congress to buy a
Viking 3.
"We would like to go back,"
said Viking program manager
Walter Jacobowsky, "but it
would have made it easier to sell
future missions had we found
life."
No one will say Vikings 1 and
2 didn't try.
For weeks, the twin landers
had earthlings on the edges of
their seats with information that
seemed to indicate traces of life
hidden in the grains of the red
Martian dirt.
But in the past few days, a
series of tests that could have
corroborated the earlier findings
drew blanks, all but slamming
the lid on the question of life.
The data that at first seemed to

indicate living processes were
chalked up to some bizarre
chemical process beyond the
immediate comprehension of
man.
The Viking robots didn't find
the alien life they traveled 200
million miles to see, but they
built a mountain of exotic data
that has multiplied man's know
ledge of the planet a thousand
fold.
Before Viking, for example, a
civilization the size of our own
could have been thriving on
Mars and escaped the eyes of our
most sophisticated radar
telescopes and even the various
flyby missions.
Now scientists can say with
certainty Mars has no civiliza
tions as we know them and with
near-certainty that it never has
had.
The convincing factor was the
failure of both landers to find
any organic molecules. Organics
are the basics found in all life on
earth, the "thumbprints of life"
as one scientist put it. If Mars
had been home to any form of
life, organics would have told
the tale.
As it is though, scientists are
content with working out the
puzzles found by the Vikings,
and have another year — the
wound-down, extended mission
lasts until October 1977 — to
explore the planet.
