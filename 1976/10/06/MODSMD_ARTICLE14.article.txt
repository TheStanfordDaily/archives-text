# Guidelines for political activities
## 
### 
In 1970, I promulgated what have come to be known as the University's Guidelines for
Political Activities on Campus. Given that we are into another campaign period, I think it
desirable a#iin to remind members of the University community about the limits on our
involvement in political matters. Any differences from the 1970 Guidelines in what follows
represent efforts at clarification. The basic policies remain unchanged.
-Richard W. Lyman, President
There arc certain limitations on the kinds of political activities which can take place
from Stanford facilities and with Stanford support.
The sourccs ot these limitations are two. First, we must continue to observe with care
the role that the University properly can play in society. Second, we must abide by the laws
ot the United States and the State of California that govern Stanford's activities as an
educational trust and as a tax-exempt institution.
I want first to address what these limitations do not encompass. These limitations in no
way inhibit the expression of political views by any individual in the University community.
Nor do they forbid faculty, students, and staff from joining with others in support of
candidates for office or in furtherance of particular political causes.
There is no limit on discussion of political issues, and there is no bar to teaching about
political techniques. Perhaps of greatest importance, academic endeavors which address
public policy issues are in no way affected.
But the University is absolutely prohibited from intervening in any manner on behalf of
any candidate for public office. What this means, quite simply, is that no group or individual
supporting candidates for office, no matter what their political persuasion, can use (except
in the limited ways described below) University space or facilities or receive University
support.
The University is also prohibited by law from devoting any substantial part of its
activities to the carrying on ol "propaganda" or otherwise attempting to influence legisla
tion.
In this respect, the law reflects sound policy, for it would be inconsistent with the very
nature of a university for it to engage in political activities, or to support such activities, on
behalf ol any cause not directly related to the educational enterprise.
I his could commit the University to a political position-a commitment which would be
inconsistent with the freedom of conscience and inquiry necessary to preservation of the
University, further, so to act would surely lead to bitter competition in the University for
the capture of all its resources for a particular cause, and invite efforts from outside to the
same end.
l or these reasons, then, the University must exercise great care in determining the degree
of support or hospitality it can give to campus activities which are designed to influence
political views in the ouiside community.
What follows arc some general guidelines which should assist in preventing the involve
ment or apparent involvement of the University in political campaigns or activities:
(1) Neither the name nor seal of the University nor of any of its schools or institutions
should be used on letters or other written material intended for political purposes, such as
the solicitations of funds for political purposes or activities, the solicitation of endorsement
of candidates for public office, or support for or opposition to proposed legislation not
directly related to the educational enterprise.
(2) No University office and no student, faculty, or staff member's office should be
used as a return mailing address for the solicitation of funds for political purposes, the
solicitation of endorsement of candidates for political office, or support for or opposition to
proposed legislation, nor may University telephone numbers be used as the source of
information about these matters, (a student's dormitory room and address maybe used for
these purposes, so long as the room continues to be used primarily as the student's
residence)
(3) In political correspondence, the University tide of a faculty or staff member, if used,
should be used only for identification and only when accompanied by a statement that the
individual is speaking for himself and not as a representative of the University.
(4) University services, duplicating machines, computers, telephones, or other equip
ment or supplies may not be used for political purposes, nor may any office employee or
other employees of the University be asked to perform tasks in any way related to political
activities while on duty.
In contrast, there arc permissible uses of Stanford's space and facilities for persons and
groups involved in political matters.
Kxamples of what is permitted, by persons and groups who follow regular University
procedures, are:
(1) Use of public places, such as White Pla/a, for tables, speeches, and similar activities;
(2) Intermittent use of on-campus meeting rooms;
(3) Use of auditoriums and similar space for public events, including speeches by
political candidates.
Such activities in our spacc and facilities arc in keeping with our long-standing obligation
to entourage freedom of expression in the University and arc allowable because they could
not reasonably he construed to imply the involvement of the University or even the
identification of the University with the political activities or views expressed in such
situations.
I recognize the application of these guidelines to particular proposals and activities will,
in some eases, not be readily apparent. I or that reason, I have designated Sally Mahoney,
Associate Provost and Registrar, as the University coordinator for review of such activities
She is familiar with University procedures and with the resources, including legal advice,
available to assist individuals or groups with specific plans. It is essential that she be
informed about plans which could raiae questions in these rcspccts in order that our actions
remain consistent with these principles.
