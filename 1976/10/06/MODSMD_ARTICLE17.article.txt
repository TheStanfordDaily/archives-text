# SWOPSI, SCIRE undergo changes
## 
### Arlene Kishi 
The Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI) and the Student
Center for Innovation in Re
search and Education (SCIRE)
have undergone several changes
this year in hopes of improving
their effectiveness here.
One major difference in the
programs this year is that one
co-director of each program is an
undergraduate: seniors Tom
Graham and Janet Shaver will be
sharing the responsibility for
SWOPSI and SCIRE, respec
tively, with Alice Supton of the
Undergraduate Studies Office.
Graham works on a day-to-day
basis, going out and talking to
students to collect new ideas and
then getting those ideas off the
ground.
"A student co-director will in
sure that students have an active
voice in determining the direc
tion and content of the prog
ram," he said.
SCIRE wants to "promote stu
dent initiated learning, self

directed learning in any way we
can, which may include task
forces on improving departmen
tal advising and encouraging
individual self-designed pro
jects," Shaver said.
This year SWOPSI is sponsor
ing several public events in con
junction with their workshops.
They are holding a free film
series on labor history parallel to
SWOPSI 171, "History of the
American Labor Movement." As
a corollary to SWOPSI 173,
"Carter vs. Ford: The Race to the
White House." SWOPSI is co
sponsoring a debate between
congressional candidates David
Harris and Pete McCloskey on
Oct. 14.
Relevant issues
"We're interested in helping
students who might want to
study issues relevant to Stanford
like tuition politics, tenure,
etc.," said Graham.
SCIRE is in the process of ce
menting its programs for this
year, according to Shaver. It will

continue its internship program
which helps students connect
theory they learn here with prac
tice in the community, although
specific plans have not been set.
A pamphlet on the program, in
cluding placement and courses
to be taken, will be published in
mid-November.
Administrative changes have
also taken place in the Office of
the Dean of Undergraduate
â€¢Studies. Last year's liaison bet
ween SWOPSI and the dean's of
fice, Asst. Dean Michael Clos
son, has been replaced by Asst.
Dean Melanie Reeves and Assoc.
Dean David Abernethy. This
means "closer scrutiny from the
Dean's Office," according to
Graham.
SWOPSI workshops on
sexism, health care, labor,
feminism, law, technology and
conservation are scheduled for
the next two quarters.
Bridging the gap
"I hope that students can
bridge the thought vs. action

gap, and in the process use prog
rams like SWOPSI," Graham
said.
SCIRE is aiming for similar
ends.
"It's very easy at Stanford to be
overwhelmed by all the know
ledge around you. Students need
to feel self-confident; they can
direct their own education by
deciding what's important to
learn and doing it. People and
other resources are available to
help them, and this year my
main goal is to let them know
about these resources," Shaver
said.
