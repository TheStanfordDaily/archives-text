## Chris glad to play in California again 
### Paul Bauman 
After three losses and 14,000
miles of traveling, Stanford
Head Football Coach Jack Christ
iansen has had enough of the
East.
In that sense, he's glad the
Cardinals are playing at UCLA
Saturday night.
"I'm happy we don't have to
travel very far this week," Christ
iansen told a group of Northern
California football writers yes
terday.
"We had hoped to be in a lot
better position at this time, like
2 —2 or maybe 3 —1." he added.
"We've never had much luck
playing out-of-conference op
ponents. We're more settled
now. Concentrating has been
difficult, what with moving out
of the dorm (at the end of the
summer) and registration."
Bruins ranked
The Cards will have to achieve
total concentration to beat
UCLA, ranked sixth by United
Press International. They'll also
have to heal fast. Stanford's in
jury list goes on and on.
Cuy Benjamin sat out the
Army game with a sprained
ankle, sprained thumb and bro
ken nose, all suffered against
San Jose State. Assuming he has
recovered sufficiently, Christ
iansen said he will start the
UCLA game.
Receiver Tony Hill is still
limping somewhat on the ankle
he sprained in the Penn State
game, but he's scheduled to start

against the Bruins.
Bill Kellar, tho other starting
wide receiver, suffered a cracked
vertebrae in the Army loss last
weekend. He'll wear a pad over it
and should also start Saturday.
"I hope his mother doesn't
hear that," Christiansen said.
"She'd probably think we've got
him playing football with a bro
ken back."
Linebackers Rich Merlo and
Ray Cardinalli each bruised a
shoulder against Army, but they
should be ready for UCLA.
Cornerback Larry Reynolds
reinjured a leg against Army,
but he too is expected to go
again.
Even Al I'enßruggencate, who
has been out with a knee injury
that may eventually require
surgery, has a slim chance to
play this weekend.
Blackburn out
One player who definitely
won't play against UCLA, or
probably any other team this
season, is Ramsey Blackburn,
who took over for Tenßruggen
cate at offensive guard.
Blackburn hurt his knee against
San )ose State and was operated
on yesterday.
The injury situation doesn't
figure to improve after the UCLA
game. The Bruins are reputed to
be the hardest hitting team in the
Pac.ific-8.
"San Jose State hits hard,"
Christiansen said, "but you ain't
seem nothin' 'till you've played
UCLA."

Christiansen said, "but you ain't

Stanford defensive end Duncan McColl pressures quarterback Steve Deßerg in the San Jose
State game two weeks ago. After the Army game last weekend, Cadet coach Homer Smith said
McColl "has our All-America vote."
After three losses and 14,000
miles of traveling, Stanford
Head Football Coach Jack Christ
iansen has had enough of the
East.
In that sense, he's glad the
Cardinals are playing at UCLA
Saturday night.
"I'm happy we don't have to
travel very far this week," Christ
iansen told a group of Northern
California football writers yes
terday.
"We had hoped to be in a lot
better position at this time, like
2 —2 or maybe 3 —1." he added.
"We've never had much luck
playing out-of-conference op
ponents. We're more settled
now. Concentrating has been
difficult, what with moving out
of the dorm (at the end of the
summer) and registration."
Bruins ranked
The Cards will have to achieve
total concentration to beat
UCLA, ranked sixth by United
Press International. They'll also
have to heal fast. Stanford's in
jury list goes on and on.
Cuy Benjamin sat out the
Army game with a sprained
ankle, sprained thumb and bro
ken nose, all suffered against
San Jose State. Assuming he has
recovered sufficiently, Christ
iansen said he will start the
UCLA game.
Receiver Tony Hill is still
limping somewhat on the ankle
he sprained in the Penn State
game, but he's scheduled to start

against the Bruins.
Bill Kellar, tho other starting
wide receiver, suffered a cracked
vertebrae in the Army loss last
weekend. He'll wear a pad over it
and should also start Saturday.
"I hope his mother doesn't
hear that," Christiansen said.
"She'd probably think we've got
him playing football with a bro
ken back."
Linebackers Rich Merlo and
Ray Cardinalli each bruised a
shoulder against Army, but they
should be ready for UCLA.
Cornerback Larry Reynolds
reinjured a leg against Army,
but he too is expected to go
again.
Even Al I'enßruggencate, who
has been out with a knee injury
that may eventually require
surgery, has a slim chance to
play this weekend.
Blackburn out
One player who definitely
won't play against UCLA, or
probably any other team this
season, is Ramsey Blackburn,
who took over for Tenßruggen
cate at offensive guard.
Blackburn hurt his knee against
San )ose State and was operated
on yesterday.
