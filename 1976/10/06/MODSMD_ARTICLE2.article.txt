# Report attacks Mayaguez incident

### 
Washington (AP) — U.S. Marines
were ordered to rescue the Mayaguez
crew from a Cambodian island despite
reports indicating the crew was no
longer there and with bad information
about enemy resistance, a congres
sional report says.
White House Press Secretary Ron
Nessen said in San Francisco, "We
disagree with that conclusion."
"The president carried out the ac
tions in the Mayaguez case and be
lieved they were right," he said. "The
interval of time has not affected any
thing."
The report by the General Account
ing Office said U.S. jet pilots had accu
rately reported seeing all or most of the
Mayaguez crew on a fishing boat off
the island. But it said U.S. comman
ders relied instead on an inaccurate
report that the crew was on the island.
It also said key planners of the
Marine assault on the island, Koh
Tang, expected resistance from only
about 20 Cambodian soldiers and did
not know of accurate U.S. intelligence
lhat there were about 150 heavily

armed soldiers there.
The U.S. Marine assault May 15,
1975, on Koh Tang to rescue the ship
and crew seized by Cambodian gun
boats three days earlier left 18 Marines
dead or missing. Twenty-three Air
Force men involved in the mission
also were killed in a helicopter crash
two days earlier.
The report concludes, as had been
evident, that the Marine assault and
U.S. bombing on Cambodia's main
land did not win release of the
Mayaguez crew because it started after
the Cambodians had begun releasing
the crew.
But it said that it "probably could
not have been known at the time" and
said earlier U.S. military strikes and
sinking of gunboats probably did in
fluence Cambodia to release the crew.
Aside from the criticism of poor
communications, the report said the
U.S. military action "was generally ac
complished in an efficient and effec
tive manner.
"The performance of U.S. forces was
inspiring," the report said.
