# Vince Mulroy: second string to top receiver
## Card still not conVINCEd he's good 
### Jill Lieber 
Football players always seem to stick
out in a crowd. When you stand next to a
grid star, you know it. He's the big man
on campus—the brawny brut whose
powerful size is often overwhelming. His
muscles aren't camouflaged by clothing.
They somehow manage to ooze out from
behind any style shirt.
But chances are if Vince Mulroy strol
led past you on campus you wouldn't
realize he plays wide receiver for Stan
ford. After seeing Vinnie, you wonder
how he can play such a tough guy's
game.
His boyish face, with its hint of freck
les, will probably force him to be carded
at bars until he's at least 35. He's gener
ously listed at 6 feet and 180 pounds.
However, after watching Mulroy on
the football field, moving with determi
nation and confidence, snatching the
ball between two defenders, or leaving
his feet to make a graceful reception, you
know that you'd rather have Vinnie Mul
roy playing for the Cards than against
them.

"I think there's some feeling that I'm
frail," he said. "I don't think I'm prone to
injury. Last year I broke two ribs. I broke
ribs in high school too, but those are the
only times I've gotten hurt.
"My coaches in high school always
kidded me because I didn't look like a
football player. They said I looked more
like I was in the band."
As a part of the Stanford offense, Mul
roy seems to be blowing his horn loud
and clear. He's the Cards' leading re

ceiver with 15 catches for 198 yards, an
average of 13.2 yards per catch. Mulroy is
also the fourth leading receiver in the
Pacific-8.
Learned from teammates
"I've learned the most from Bill Sing
ler (former Stanford receiver) and Bill
Kellar. They are both about my size and
about my speed so 1 try and watch them
and see what they do to get open," Mul
roy said. "1 try to do what they do—and 1
emphasize try."
His own humility, along with his re
spect for teammates, makes you wonder
if he's really as far down the Cardinals'
receiver totem pole as he says. When the
season opened, he was considered the
fourth wide receiver on the team, but
Tony Hill's ankle injury in the Penn State
game gave him a chance to play.
"I'm content to sit on the bench. I
would prefer to play, but not if it means
Tony Hill not being in there. When I'm in
there, that means James Lofton or Bill
Kellar or Tony Hill is not in there. And as
of right now, when I'm in I'm hurting the
team because those guys are in a different
class than I am as a receiver.
High school honors
Despite what he says, Mulroy has had a
lot of experience at the wide receiver
position. While at Newport Beach high
school he was twice named to the Los
Angeles Times All-Orange County team.
He was named All-CIF as a junior and
was selected to play in both the Orange
County All-Star Game and the Shrine
Game.
Last year Mulroy was the leading re
ceiver on the junior varsity team with 25

catches for 394 yards (15.8) and twoTDs.
"I didn't go out for football until my
sophomore year in high school," Mulroy
said. "I was on the track team and the
football coach came over and asked me to
go out for football.
"I don't think my dad had ever sat
down and watched a football game on TV
before I played. My oldest brother
wanted to play football really bad in high
school, but my uncle, who is an or
thopedic surgeon, kind of prejudiced my
father against it. My dad didn't let me
play Pop Warner. 1 played soccer and
little league baseball."
Vataha comparison
Mulroy is one of the bright spots on
Stanford's 1976 football team. Now the
(lard sophomore is being likened to
former Stanford great Randy Vataha.
"There is no comparison at all," Mul
roy said. "We're both from Orange
County. That's about as far as you can
draw the comparison. 1 feel that that's
just too much too soon. I don't deserve
that at all."
Mulroy said that when he is first sent
into a game he is nervous, but that after
catching that first pass he becomes con
fident and mentally involved in the
game.
"My mind plays weird games with
me—always doubting. Inside my head
I'm always trying to convince myself that
I'm good and there's always something
back there saying, 'No you're not.' I'd like
to be able to have more assurance that I'm
good because that's what it takes when
you drop that first pass. You have to
know you're good."

Stanford receiver Vince Mulroy (40) makes a reception as Dwayne O'Steen (25) of San Jose
State defends. Mulroy, a sophomore, is the fourth leading receiver in the Pacific-8 with 15
catches for 198 yards.
Football players always seem to stick
out in a crowd. When you stand next to a
grid star, you know it. He's the big man
on campus—the brawny brut whose
powerful size is often overwhelming. His
muscles aren't camouflaged by clothing.
They somehow manage to ooze out from
behind any style shirt.
But chances are if Vince Mulroy strol
led past you on campus you wouldn't
realize he plays wide receiver for Stan
ford. After seeing Vinnie, you wonder
how he can play such a tough guy's
game.
His boyish face, with its hint of freck
les, will probably force him to be carded
at bars until he's at least 35. He's gener
ously listed at 6 feet and 180 pounds.
However, after watching Mulroy on
the football field, moving with determi
nation and confidence, snatching the
ball between two defenders, or leaving
his feet to make a graceful reception, you
know that you'd rather have Vinnie Mul
roy playing for the Cards than against
them.

"I think there's some feeling that I'm
frail," he said. "I don't think I'm prone to
injury. Last year I broke two ribs. I broke
ribs in high school too, but those are the
only times I've gotten hurt.
"My coaches in high school always
kidded me because I didn't look like a
football player. They said I looked more
like I was in the band."
As a part of the Stanford offense, Mul
roy seems to be blowing his horn loud
and clear. He's the Cards' leading re

ceiver with 15 catches for 198 yards, an
average of 13.2 yards per catch. Mulroy is
also the fourth leading receiver in the
Pacific-8.
Learned from teammates
"I've learned the most from Bill Sing
ler (former Stanford receiver) and Bill
Kellar. They are both about my size and
about my speed so 1 try and watch them
and see what they do to get open," Mul
roy said. "1 try to do what they do—and 1
emphasize try."
His own humility, along with his re
spect for teammates, makes you wonder
if he's really as far down the Cardinals'
receiver totem pole as he says. When the
season opened, he was considered the
fourth wide receiver on the team, but
Tony Hill's ankle injury in the Penn State
game gave him a chance to play.
"I'm content to sit on the bench. I
would prefer to play, but not if it means
Tony Hill not being in there. When I'm in
there, that means James Lofton or Bill
Kellar or Tony Hill is not in there. And as
of right now, when I'm in I'm hurting the
team because those guys are in a different
class than I am as a receiver.
High school honors
Despite what he says, Mulroy has had a
lot of experience at the wide receiver
position. While at Newport Beach high
school he was twice named to the Los
Angeles Times All-Orange County team.
He was named All-CIF as a junior and
was selected to play in both the Orange
County All-Star Game and the Shrine
Game.
Last year Mulroy was the leading re
ceiver on the junior varsity team with 25

catches for 394 yards (15.8) and twoTDs.
"I didn't go out for football until my
sophomore year in high school," Mulroy
said. "I was on the track team and the
football coach came over and asked me to
go out for football.
"I don't think my dad had ever sat
down and watched a football game on TV
before I played. My oldest brother
wanted to play football really bad in high
school, but my uncle, who is an or
thopedic surgeon, kind of prejudiced my
father against it. My dad didn't let me
play Pop Warner. 1 played soccer and
little league baseball."
Vataha comparison
Mulroy is one of the bright spots on
Stanford's 1976 football team. Now the
(lard sophomore is being likened to
former Stanford great Randy Vataha.
"There is no comparison at all," Mul
roy said. "We're both from Orange
County. That's about as far as you can
draw the comparison. 1 feel that that's
just too much too soon. I don't deserve
that at all."
Mulroy said that when he is first sent
into a game he is nervous, but that after
catching that first pass he becomes con
fident and mentally involved in the
game.
"My mind plays weird games with
me—always doubting. Inside my head
I'm always trying to convince myself that
I'm good and there's always something
back there saying, 'No you're not.' I'd like
to be able to have more assurance that I'm
good because that's what it takes when
you drop that first pass. You have to
know you're good."

you drop that first pass. You have to
know you're good."

Stanford receiver Vince Mulroy (40) makes a reception as Dwayne O'Steen (25) of San Jose
State defends. Mulroy, a sophomore, is the fourth leading receiver in the Pacific-8 with 15
catches for 198 yards.
Football players always seem to stick
out in a crowd. When you stand next to a
grid star, you know it. He's the big man
on campus—the brawny brut whose
powerful size is often overwhelming. His
muscles aren't camouflaged by clothing.
They somehow manage to ooze out from
behind any style shirt.
But chances are if Vince Mulroy strol
led past you on campus you wouldn't
realize he plays wide receiver for Stan
ford. After seeing Vinnie, you wonder
how he can play such a tough guy's
game.
His boyish face, with its hint of freck
les, will probably force him to be carded
at bars until he's at least 35. He's gener
ously listed at 6 feet and 180 pounds.
However, after watching Mulroy on
the football field, moving with determi
nation and confidence, snatching the
ball between two defenders, or leaving
his feet to make a graceful reception, you
know that you'd rather have Vinnie Mul
roy playing for the Cards than against
them.
Frail image
"I think there's some feeling that I'm
frail," he said. "I don't think I'm prone to
injury. Last year I broke two ribs. I broke
ribs in high school too, but those are the
only times I've gotten hurt.
"My coaches in high school always
kidded me because I didn't look like a
football player. They said I looked more
like I was in the band."
As a part of the Stanford offense, Mul
roy seems to be blowing his horn loud
and clear. He's the Cards' leading re

ceiver with 15 catches for 198 yards, an
average of 13.2 yards per catch. Mulroy is
also the fourth leading receiver in the
Pacific-8.
Learned from teammates
"I've learned the most from Bill Sing
ler (former Stanford receiver) and Bill
Kellar. They are both about my size and
about my speed so 1 try and watch them
and see what they do to get open," Mul
roy said. "1 try to do what they do—and 1
emphasize try."
His own humility, along with his re
spect for teammates, makes you wonder
if he's really as far down the Cardinals'
receiver totem pole as he says. When the
season opened, he was considered the
fourth wide receiver on the team, but
Tony Hill's ankle injury in the Penn State
game gave him a chance to play.
"I'm content to sit on the bench. I
would prefer to play, but not if it means
Tony Hill not being in there. When I'm in
there, that means James Lofton or Bill
Kellar or Tony Hill is not in there. And as
of right now, when I'm in I'm hurting the
team because those guys are in a different
class than I am as a receiver.
High school honors
Despite what he says, Mulroy has had a
lot of experience at the wide receiver
position. While at Newport Beach high
school he was twice named to the Los
Angeles Times All-Orange County team.
He was named All-CIF as a junior and
was selected to play in both the Orange
County All-Star Game and the Shrine
Game.
Last year Mulroy was the leading re
ceiver on the junior varsity team with 25

catches for 394 yards (15.8) and twoTDs.
"I didn't go out for football until my
sophomore year in high school," Mulroy
said. "I was on the track team and the
football coach came over and asked me to
go out for football.
"I don't think my dad had ever sat
down and watched a football game on TV
before I played. My oldest brother
wanted to play football really bad in high
school, but my uncle, who is an or
thopedic surgeon, kind of prejudiced my
father against it. My dad didn't let me
play Pop Warner. 1 played soccer and
little league baseball."
Vataha comparison
Mulroy is one of the bright spots on
Stanford's 1976 football team. Now the
(lard sophomore is being likened to
former Stanford great Randy Vataha.
"There is no comparison at all," Mul
roy said. "We're both from Orange
County. That's about as far as you can
draw the comparison. 1 feel that that's
just too much too soon. I don't deserve
that at all."
Mulroy said that when he is first sent
into a game he is nervous, but that after
catching that first pass he becomes con
fident and mentally involved in the
game.
"My mind plays weird games with
me—always doubting. Inside my head
I'm always trying to convince myself that
I'm good and there's always something
back there saying, 'No you're not.' I'd like
to be able to have more assurance that I'm
good because that's what it takes when
you drop that first pass. You have to
know you're good."
