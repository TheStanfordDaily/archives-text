# UCLA undefeated under new coach
## 
### Chris Baker 
Los Angeles—lt was the final
day of the Pacific-8 football
skywriters' tour. After visiting
seven Pac-8 schools, the writers
knew that every Athletic Direc
tor, coach and player fully ex
pected to spend Christmas vaca
tion in Pasadena.
But there wasn't a giant pic
ture of the Rose Bowl hanging
from the rafters when the writers
walked into UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion.
"This is really freaky," said a
scribe. "The Bruins must know
they're really good or they know
they're going to have a bad sea
son."
Well, third-ranked UCLA
must have known it was good 30
days ago. The Rose Bowl champ
ion Bruins are the class of the
Pac-8, and it isn't even basket

ball season.
"UCLA is basically a basket
ball school," said left halfback
Wendell Tyler. "When you say
'football' you think about SC.
We're trying to change things
around."
With former Bruin coach Dick
Vermeil counting his money in
Philadelphia and UCLA quar
terback John Sciarra holding on
extra points in the Canadian
Football League, most everyone
thought UCLA would have to
wait another 10 years for a return
trip to Pasadena.
"I don't care how low you rank
us in preseason," first-year
UCLA coach Terry Donahue
said. "The Bruins will be up
there when the season is over."
Donahue, 32, is one of the
youngest head football coaches
at a major university. He's the

third football coach UCLA has
hired since 1970.
'Workaholic'
"I think Terry is very similar to
coach Vermeil," said Bruin quar
terback Jeff Dankworth.
"They're both workaholics.
Vermeil was involved in every
thing. And Terry has taken it a
step further."
Nobody in Westwood thought
Sciarra could be replaced to di
rect the Bruin "veer" offense.
Donahue had his own quarter
back controversy this summer
with Dankworth, whose biggest
claim is that he looks like Pat
Boone, and Steve Bukich, whose
father, Rudy was a great quarter
back for USC and the Chicago
Bears.
Bukich, a good passer, started
one game for UCLA in 1974 as a
freshman before redshirting last

year. v
Dankworth, who stepped into
the UCLA offense after Sciarra
was injured in 1974, got the
starting nod this season. "We
wanted a good runner to direct
our offense," said Donahue,
"and Jeff is a better runner than
Steve."
Quarterback controversy
Not many are arguing now.
Dankworth had Arizona State's
defense looking under the
sagebrush in the Bruins' 28-10
season opening win over the Sun
Devils. He's the sixth leading
rusher in the conference.
But one of the reasons that
Dankworth has been having so
much success directing the
UCLA attack is Tyler. Bruin op
ponents have been worrying so
much about stopping the speedy
left halfback that Dankworth has
been able to open up the UCLA
attack over the middle.
Tyler, UCLA's "bonafide
Heisman Trophy candidate,"
according to Sports Information
Director Vic Kelley, is the Pac
e's second leading rusher —
when he isn't fumbling.
Heisman candidate
"I don't know how you could
call me a Heisman Trophy can
didate," said Tyler. "Maybe you
should ask the publicity de
partment." Tyler, who gained
156 yards in UCLA's 40-7 victory
over Air Force two weeks ago is
now UCLA's all-time rushing
leader with 2519 yards.
The big surprise in Westwood
though, has been right halfback
Theotis Brown. The 6-foot-3,
215-pound halfback has rushed
for 280 yards. Brown, a 9.6
sprinter, would be perfect if he

could hold onto touchdown pas
ses in the endzone against Ohio
State.
The "Huge Corporation," the
UCLA offensive line which
pushed the Buckeyes around in
the Rose Bowl, was decimated
by graduation. "Our number one
concern here is depth," said
Donahue.
Worst passing team
UCLA is the second worst pas
sing team inthePac-8. You don't
need to throw the football when
you can gain six yards by falling
down.
But if the Bruins need a 67-
yard bomb, there's always
flanker Wally "Hollywood"
Henry. The 5-9, 170-pound
flanker destroyed Ohio State in
the Rose Bowl this year, with
five catches and two
touchdowns.
The Bruin defense, which
looks like a Samoan reunion,
hasn't been as hospitable as the
citizens of Pago Pago. UCLA has
the best defensive squad in the
Pac-8. The Bruins have allowed
just 36 points this year.
Left tackle Pete Pele who last
week made the Buckeyes wish
he never left Samoa, leads the
defensive line. In the secondary,
UCLA has "Dr. Death" — safety
Oscar Edwards. The Bruins are
third in conference pass defense
stats, but they've only played
one pass oriented offense — Air
Force.
"We've always been at the bot
tom," said Dankworth. "It's al
ways been the 'gutty little
Bruins.' "
Well, UCLA isn't at the bottom
and they certainly aren't little.
How times change.
