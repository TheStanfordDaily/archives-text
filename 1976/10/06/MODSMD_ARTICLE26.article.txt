# Tanner wins Fireman's Fund
## 
### Paul Bauman 
San Franciscoâ€”On the strength of his shot
gun serve and some pretty fair groundstrokes,
former Stanford All-American Roscoe Tanner
beat Brian Gottfried 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 to win the
singles title of the $125,000 Fireman's Fund
International Tennis Tournament Monday
night.
Tanner earned $20,000 for the victory, while
Gottfried took home $10,000.
Tanner made it a sweep by also winning the
doubles crown with Dick Stockton against
Gottfried and Bob Hewitt, 6-3, 6-4.
The singles final was a virtual standoff for
the first two sets, but Tanner drove Gottfried
crazy in the third with a series of jet-propelled
serves. It got to a point late in the last set where
Gottfried jokingly positioned himself 25 feet
behind the baseline to receive his opponent's
notorious serve. The way Tanner was going,
it's doubtful whether even that would have
helped.

Gottfried broke Tanner's serve only once, in
the first set, and that was an accomplishment
in itself.
After the match, Gottfried said he was
"shellshocked."
Tanner even out-played Gottfried on the
ground in the end. Gottfried contributed to his
demise by repeatedly hitting the ball into the
net in the deciding set.
Tanner, on the other hand, got hotter as the
match went on and hit some beautiful back
hand passing shots in critical situations.
The turning point in the match occurred
when Tanner broke Gottfried's serve to win the
second set at 7-5. After that, everything Tanner
hit, whether it was a lob, a serve or a backhand,
was perfect.
Gottfried had been one of the hottest players
on the tour. Last week he won the Pacific
Southwest Open in Los Angeles, defeating Ar
thur Ashe in the finals.
