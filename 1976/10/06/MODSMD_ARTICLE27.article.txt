Candidates, city ready for debates
San Francisco — Like gamblers studying their hole
cards, President Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter spent de
bate eve yesterday weighing how blunt they can be in their
foreign aifairs face-off without inviting international mis
understanding of U.S. policy.
The world will be watching when the two contenders
for the presidency meet in the second round of their Great
Debate, at 6:30 tonight in the Palace of Fine Arts. All
networks will broadcast the confrontation.
Foreign diplomats by the score will cable home their
interpretations of Ford and Carter positions on interna
tional affairs and national defense. As important to the
candidates, American voters will carry their own impres
sions to the polls.
In related debate developments, San Francisco police
are setting up the most intensive security effort in the
city's history to protect the two presidential candidates
during their second televised debate tonight.
"It is, you might say, a headache," Police Chief Charles
Gain said yesterday, describing the need for security with
Ford anu Carter in town at the same time.
Both men arrived Monday evening, and were driven
from the airport to the city along freeways cleared for their
motorcades and guarded by police at every intersection.
The candidates plan to leave San Francisco tomorrow.
UAW, Ford reach agreement
Detroit — The United Auto Workers and strike-bound
Ford Motor Co. reached tentative agreement late yesterday
on a new industry-pattern contract which lays the founda
tion for the union's long-range drive toward a four-day
work week.
Announcement of a settlement on a new three-year ac
cord was made in a statement by UAW President Leonard
Woodcock at 7:40 p.m., PDT, almost three weeks to the
hour after 170,000 Ford workers walked off their jobs in 22
states.
However, sources close to the talks have said key provi
sions include 13 additional paid days off over three years,
wage hikes averaging about three per cent a year, continu
ation of the current cost-of-living wage adjustment for
mula and improved fringe benefits.
The strike is almost certain to last another week to 10
days, however, due to the UAW's ratification process, and
it could be another few days beyond that before the auto
maker's 62 assembly and manufacturing plants resume
normal operations.

Brezhnev alleges detente sabotage
Moscow — Soviet Communist party leader Leonid
Brezhnev accused some Western governments yesterday
of sabotaging East-West detente by raising the bogey of a
Soviet threat.
He denied the Soviet Union was threatening anyone
and repeated Kremlin positions that his country was
"ready to reduce armed forces on a reciprocal basis."
"Spokes are being put in the wheels," Brezhnev said,
using an idiom meaning to obstruct. He did not name the
Western nations he said were undermining detente.
"Some circles in Western countries persistently spread
allegations about a Soviet menace and are speculating on
the fear which they themselves assiduously arouse," he
said.
He said the need to halt the arms buildup has become
urgent and spoke out against those in the West who insist
the United States must be the strongest military power in
the world.
Gov. Brown chooses new advisers
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown Ir. announced yes
terday he has hired a $35,376-a-year energy, environment
and economics adviser and a $2000-a-month consultant
who founded the Whole Earth Catalog.
Wilson Clark, 29, was named assistant to the governor
for issues and planning, leaving his post as president of
Cascadia Institute in Seattle, Wash.

Brezhnev alleges detente sabotage
Moscow — Soviet Communist party leader Leonid
Brezhnev accused some Western governments yesterday
of sabotaging East-West detente by raising the bogey of a
Soviet threat.
He denied the Soviet Union was threatening anyone
and repeated Kremlin positions that his country was
"ready to reduce armed forces on a reciprocal basis."
"Spokes are being put in the wheels," Brezhnev said,
using an idiom meaning to obstruct. He did not name the
Western nations he said were undermining detente.
"Some circles in Western countries persistently spread
allegations about a Soviet menace and are speculating on
the fear which they themselves assiduously arouse," he
said.
He said the need to halt the arms buildup has become
urgent and spoke out against those in the West who insist
the United States must be the strongest military power in
the world.

Candidates, city ready for debates
San Francisco — Like gamblers studying their hole
cards, President Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter spent de
bate eve yesterday weighing how blunt they can be in their
foreign aifairs face-off without inviting international mis
understanding of U.S. policy.
The world will be watching when the two contenders
for the presidency meet in the second round of their Great
Debate, at 6:30 tonight in the Palace of Fine Arts. All
networks will broadcast the confrontation.
Foreign diplomats by the score will cable home their
interpretations of Ford and Carter positions on interna
tional affairs and national defense. As important to the
candidates, American voters will carry their own impres
sions to the polls.
In related debate developments, San Francisco police
are setting up the most intensive security effort in the
city's history to protect the two presidential candidates
during their second televised debate tonight.
"It is, you might say, a headache," Police Chief Charles
Gain said yesterday, describing the need for security with

UAW, Ford reach agreement
Detroit — The United Auto Workers and strike-bound
Ford Motor Co. reached tentative agreement late yesterday
on a new industry-pattern contract which lays the founda

work week.
Announcement of a settlement on a new three-year ac

Woodcock at 7:40 p.m., PDT, almost three weeks to the
hour after 170,000 Ford workers walked off their jobs in 22
states.
However, sources close to the talks have said key provi
sions include 13 additional paid days off over three years,
wage hikes averaging about three per cent a year, continu
ation of the current cost-of-living wage adjustment for
mula and improved fringe benefits.
The strike is almost certain to last another week to 10
