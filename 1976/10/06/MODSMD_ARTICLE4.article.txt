# AIP candidate hits local debates
## 
### Bill Snyder 
A 12th District congressional candi
date from the American Independent
Party has charged a university organi
zation with discrimination by its re
fusal to invite him to participate in a
political debate.
Joss Cooney said his exclusion from
participating in a debate between Re
publican incumbent Paul McCloskey
Jr. and Democratic candidate David
Harris scheduled for next Thursday, is
"an injustice of the first magnitude."
The debate, to be held at Stanford
Law School's Kresge Auditorium is
being sponsored by the Stanford
Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE), in cooperation with SWOPSI

and the Stanford Law Association.
Cooney draws a parallel between
himself and former Minnesota Sen.
Gene McCarthy, independent presi
dential candidate who was excluded
from the nationally televised Ford-
Carter debates.
But in both cases, according to a
spokesman for the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU), exclusion of
candidates from political organiza
tions is not in violation of federal elec
tion laws.
Stanford 'power monopoly'
Cooney, who contends that he has
been the object of discrimination by
the university in all four of the elec
tions in which he has campaigned,

said, "I have never been able to penet
rate the Stanford campus. Of course,
I've always run against Stanford
graduates.
"Stanford has a natural propensity
to get its own support in places of
power. They have a covert power
monopoly deployed that's running out
of the Stanford Law School."
Cooney has lodged a complaint with
the ACLU in an attempt to require Brad
Kevoy and Lisa Foster, SCOPE co
directors, to make a deposition which
would justify sponsoring a dis
criminatory debate.
A deposition is a legally binding
statement of parties taken by a court
reporter. The ACLU is investigating

the matter.
If just cause for legal action is found,
Cooney said that he would seek to
place an injunction on the debate, and
would sue the university for damages.
No grounds
James Siena, legal adviser to Presi
dent Lyman, conceded that the possi
bility of a lawsuit being brought
against the university exists but he
doesn't feel that Cooney has any
grounds either in state or federal court.
Referring to the guidelines for polit
ical activities, published in Campus
Report, April 7, 1976, Siena said, "I
don't think we're doing anything out
side of the boundaries."
According to the Guidelines, "the
university is absolutely prohibited
from intervening in any manner on
behalf of any candidate for public of
fice."
Cooney is not being prevented by
the university from an appearance on
campus. Siena replies to Cooney's
charges in a letter to Cooney dated
September 28 by saying that the uni
versity allows "anyone to come and
speak here so long as they find an ap
propriate sponsor ... within recog
nized university-based groups."
On Tuesday, Krevoy extended
Cooney both an invitation to address a
SWOPSI class on third parties in the
American political system, and an
open invitation to address the univer
sity community at his earliest con
venience.

spokesman for the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU), exclusion of
candidates from political organiza
tions is not in violation of federal elec
tion laws.
Stanford 'power monopoly'
Cooney, who contends that he has
been the object of discrimination by
the university in all four of the elec
tions in which he has campaigned,

said, "I have never been able to penet
rate the Stanford campus. Of course,
I've always run against Stanford
graduates.
"Stanford has a natural propensity
to get its own support in places of
power. They have a covert power
monopoly deployed that's running out
of the Stanford Law School."
Cooney has lodged a complaint with
the ACLU in an attempt to require Brad
Kevoy and Lisa Foster, SCOPE co
directors, to make a deposition which
would justify sponsoring a dis
criminatory debate.
A deposition is a legally binding
statement of parties taken by a court
reporter. The ACLU is investigating

the matter.
If just cause for legal action is found,
Cooney said that he would seek to
place an injunction on the debate, and
would sue the university for damages.
No grounds
James Siena, legal adviser to Presi
dent Lyman, conceded that the possi
bility of a lawsuit being brought
against the university exists but he
doesn't feel that Cooney has any
grounds either in state or federal court.
Referring to the guidelines for polit
ical activities, published in Campus
Report, April 7, 1976, Siena said, "I
don't think we're doing anything out
side of the boundaries."
According to the Guidelines, "the
university is absolutely prohibited
from intervening in any manner on
behalf of any candidate for public of
fice."
Cooney is not being prevented by
the university from an appearance on
campus. Siena replies to Cooney's
charges in a letter to Cooney dated
September 28 by saying that the uni
versity allows "anyone to come and
speak here so long as they find an ap
propriate sponsor ... within recog
nized university-based groups."
On Tuesday, Krevoy extended
Cooney both an invitation to address a
SWOPSI class on third parties in the
American political system, and an
open invitation to address the univer
sity community at his earliest con
venience.
A 12th District congressional candi
date from the American Independent
Party has charged a university organi
zation with discrimination by its re
fusal to invite him to participate in a
political debate.
Joss Cooney said his exclusion from
participating in a debate between Re
publican incumbent Paul McCloskey
Jr. and Democratic candidate David
Harris scheduled for next Thursday, is
"an injustice of the first magnitude."
The debate, to be held at Stanford
Law School's Kresge Auditorium is
being sponsored by the Stanford
Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE), in cooperation with SWOPSI

and the Stanford Law Association.
Cooney draws a parallel between
himself and former Minnesota Sen.
Gene McCarthy, independent presi
dential candidate who was excluded
from the nationally televised Ford-
Carter debates.
But in both cases, according to a
spokesman for the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU), exclusion of
candidates from political organiza
tions is not in violation of federal elec
tion laws.
