# Ford, Carter face-off on defense
## Profs say stands lack 'substantive differences' 
### Laura Kennedy 
Viewers who had trouble differen
tiating between the stands of Gerald
Ford and Jimmy Carter as the candi
dates debated domestic issues last
month can expect similar difficulty
when the debaters tackle forergn pol
icy and defense tonight.
"1 suppose I would be surprised if
there were sharp substantive differ
ences," said Robert Keohane, acting

chairman of the Political Science De
partment.
In contrast to the Vietnam
preoccupied campaigns of the past,
this peacetime election has seen little
controversy over foreign policy. What
President Ford and former Governor
Carter do differ on is defense and. to a

lesser extent, relations with that coun
try so entangled with our defense, the
Soviet Union.
The following is a summary of
Ford's and Carter's stands:
Detente — Jan Triska, a political sci
ence professor here called detente the
"hot potato" issue. Both candidates
have been backing away from this pol
icy that is so closely connected with
the Nixon Administration and Secret
ary of State Henry Kissinger.
Ford has emphasized strength in
dealing with the Soviet Union: "De
tente literally means 'easing' or 're
laxing,' but definitely not —and I em
phasize not —the relaxing of diligence
or easing of effort. . . .To me, detente
means a fervent desire for peace—but
not peace at any price."
Active U.S. presence
Carter also underlines the need for
strength saying "I feel the U.S. policy
of detente has given up too much to the
Russians and gotten too little in re
turn." However, Carter also advocates
more contact with other communist
countries: "Our vision must be of a
more pluralistic world and not of a
communist monolith. We must pay
more attention to China and to Eastern
Europe."
Triska, who is writing position pap
ers for Carter on Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union, has suggested to Car
ter the tactic of negotiating separately
with Eastern European countries as
well as with the Soviet Union in order
to show a more active U.S. presence in
the area.
In addition tobuilding relationships
with communist countries. Carter has
indicated he intends to strengthen
traditional alliances with Western
Europe, Japan and other allies.
SALT negotiations — One of the
chief reasons for easing tensions with
the Soviet Union is to move ahead on
the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks
(SALT).
Both candidates agree on the princi
ple of arms control but differ on the
urgency of reaching definite control
agreements. While Ford has said. "We
are under no time pressure (to
negotiate SALT II)," Carter said, "The

longer effective arms reduction is
postponed, the more likely it is that
other nations will be encouraged to
develop their own nuclear capability."
Carter has criticized the SALT talks
for merely "changing the buildup in
strategic arms from a 'quantitative' to a
'qualitative' arms race."
SALT talks delay explained
According to Political Science Prof.
Lawrence Weiler, a former SALT
negotiator, the "quantitative" aspect
of SALT II — setting ceilings on the
number of ballistic missiles, heavy
bombers and re-entry vehicles — was
basically agreed upon in 1974. What is
delaying SALT 11, Weiler said, is the
"qualitative" aspect — what types of
weapons fall under the categories
being limited.
Despite this delay, Ford has signed a
treaty with the Soviets as part of the
SALT talks which will provide limits
for underground nuclear explosions
and reciprocal inspection by Soviet
and American scientists of each na
tion's testing sites.
Notwithstanding this treaty, Carter
has proposed a five-year U.S.-Soviet
treaty to ban all weapons and non-war
nuclear testing.
Weapons — While advocating arms
control abroad, neither candidate has
dismissed developing new weapons at
home. Ford and Carter both support
development of the Trident sub
marine.
B-l bomber needed?
Carter disagrees with Ford's view
that the more controversial B-l bomber
should be built now, but still supports
continued research on the bomber.
(The Pentagon has already spent over
$2 billion on research.)
Carter has denounced the strategic
bomber with varying degrees of inten
sity, saying at one point, "The B-l
bomber is an example of a proposed
system which should not be funded
and would be wasteful of taxpayers'
dollars." then saying, "We ought to
keep the B-l bomber as a potential
weapon and not authorize its construc
tion until it is obviously needed."
Military spending —Carter wants to
cut out construction of the B-l bomber

as one way of reducing military ex
penditures (although Ford contends
that any delay would simply add to the
bomber's estimated $21.6 bil lion cost).
Ford has reacted sharply to Carter's
intention of trimming $5 to 7 billion
each year from the defense budget.
With such cuts, Ford maintains that "it

would be impossible to have a defense
adequate to maintain our freedom and
the freedom of our friends."
Ford has just submitted a record
high peacetime defense budget of
$112.7 billion for fiscal year 1977.
Carter hopes to cut the defense
budget by trimming the "fat and
frills," being "hard-headed in the de
velopment of new weapons systems"
and by reducing the number of un

necessary upper-level military per
sonnel.
Carter has also hinted at troop reduc
tions or withdrawals from Thailand,
the Philippines and, at one point, the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO). In addition, Carter has consi
dered a phased withdrawal of troops
over a four- or five-year period from
South Korea, although he said he
would keep U.S. Air Force squadrons
there to maintain what he termed
"adequate air cover."
It is this contemplated withdrawal
from South Korea that Ford has par
ticularly attacked, calling it"the voice
of retreat" and declaring himself
against any "unilateral phased with
drawal."
Mideast — Although the president
has proposed an increase for the de
fense budget as a whole, his military
aid to Israel in fiscal year 1977 is $500
million less than this year's amount.
Courting Jewish vote
Michel Nabti, a news analyst for
KQED and a fellow at Hoover Institu
tion, said he thought Carter would at
tack Ford on this reduction because of

what Nabti terms "the political reality
of Jewish voters."
No doubt mindful of this "political
reality," both Ford and Carter concur
in traditional U.S. support of Israel.
However, the Ford administration
recently lobbied for and received a re
versal of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee's threat to veto $30 million
of arms for Saudi Arabia.
Carter and Ford are both anxious to
achieve peace in the Mideast, but Car
ter says he believes Kissinger's shuttle
diplomacy has reached the end of its
usefulness.
Carter has criticized Kissinger's dip
lomatic style in general, calling it a
secretive, one-man, "Lone Ranger"
approach.
Africa — African leaders have just
rejected a proposed Rhodesian settle
ment partially negotiated by Kis
singer. The fate of the settlement is a
very tentative question and for that
reason, Africa is a topic upon which
Carter has not significantly com
mented.
Keohane said, "Carter can hardly do
anything but applaud progress toward
averting a racial war."
Assoc. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, who teaches courses on
tropical and southern Africa, agreed
with his colleague and said of the
Rhodesia situation, "I don't think it's
going to make much difference to
Ford's re-election."
Slurs hurt Ford
Abernethy pointed out that Ford's
hope of winning the favor of America's
black constituency with his new
found interest in Africa has been
crushed by the publicity of the racial
slurs uttered by former Secretary of
Agriculture Earl Butz.
Southeast Asia and China — Re
member Vietnam? No one else seems
to, least of all the candidates. Asst.
Political Science Prof. Franklin Weins
tein reported that only one person — a
lawyer who had dealings in southeast
Asia — is writing about southeast
Asian policy for the Carter task force.
A Ford spokesman yesterday said
the White House disagrees with a con
clusion drawn by the General Ac
counting Office (GAO) that hasty ac
tion and faulty intelligence resulted in

the death of 41 American marines and
Air Force men sent to rescue members
of the merchant ship Mayaguez last
year, according to the Associated
Press.
The GAO reported that U.S. marines
were ordered to invade Koh Tang is
land in the Gulf of Thailand to rescue
the crew of the Mayaguez, which had
been seized by Cambodians, even
though pilots had reported that the
crew was on a fishing boat and not on
the tiny island.
Dump Taiwan?
Ghina, unlike Vietnam, is an ever
growing factor in U.S. foreign policy.
However, China's fate after the death
of Mao Tse-tung remains a mystery to
China analysts as well as Carter and
Ford.
Taiwan remains a worrisome pawn
in relations with the People's Republic
of China. Weinstein, who teaches clas
ses on east Asia, said no matter who is
elected, "The assumption that most
scholars make (is) that after the elec
tion, the Taiwan government will be
dumped."
Carter has indicated he favors this
position, suggesting emulation of Ja
pan's policy of full diplomatic rela
tions with China and strong trade rela
tions with Taiwan.

and reciprocal inspection by Soviet
and American scientists of each na
tion's testing sites.
Notwithstanding this treaty, Carter
has proposed a five-year U.S.-Soviet
treaty to ban all weapons and non-war
nuclear testing.
Weapons — While advocating arms
control abroad, neither candidate has
dismissed developing new weapons at
home. Ford and Carter both support
development of the Trident sub
marine.
B-l bomber needed?
Carter disagrees with Ford's view
that the more controversial B-l bomber
should be built now, but still supports
continued research on the bomber.
(The Pentagon has already spent over
$2 billion on research.)
Carter has denounced the strategic
bomber with varying degrees of inten
sity, saying at one point, "The B-l
bomber is an example of a proposed
system which should not be funded
and would be wasteful of taxpayers'
dollars." then saying, "We ought to
keep the B-l bomber as a potential
weapon and not authorize its construc
tion until it is obviously needed."
Military spending —Carter wants to
cut out construction of the B-l bomber

as one way of reducing military ex
penditures (although Ford contends
that any delay would simply add to the
bomber's estimated $21.6 bil lion cost).
Ford has reacted sharply to Carter's
intention of trimming $5 to 7 billion
each year from the defense budget.
With such cuts, Ford maintains that "it

would be impossible to have a defense
adequate to maintain our freedom and
the freedom of our friends."
Ford has just submitted a record
high peacetime defense budget of
$112.7 billion for fiscal year 1977.
Carter hopes to cut the defense
budget by trimming the "fat and
frills," being "hard-headed in the de
velopment of new weapons systems"
and by reducing the number of un

necessary upper-level military per
sonnel.
Carter has also hinted at troop reduc
tions or withdrawals from Thailand,
the Philippines and, at one point, the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO). In addition, Carter has consi
dered a phased withdrawal of troops
over a four- or five-year period from
South Korea, although he said he
would keep U.S. Air Force squadrons
there to maintain what he termed
"adequate air cover."
It is this contemplated withdrawal
from South Korea that Ford has par
ticularly attacked, calling it"the voice
of retreat" and declaring himself
against any "unilateral phased with
drawal."
Mideast — Although the president
has proposed an increase for the de
fense budget as a whole, his military
aid to Israel in fiscal year 1977 is $500
million less than this year's amount.
Courting Jewish vote
Michel Nabti, a news analyst for
KQED and a fellow at Hoover Institu
tion, said he thought Carter would at
tack Ford on this reduction because of

what Nabti terms "the political reality
of Jewish voters."
No doubt mindful of this "political
reality," both Ford and Carter concur
in traditional U.S. support of Israel.
However, the Ford administration
recently lobbied for and received a re
versal of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee's threat to veto $30 million
of arms for Saudi Arabia.
Carter and Ford are both anxious to
achieve peace in the Mideast, but Car
ter says he believes Kissinger's shuttle
diplomacy has reached the end of its
usefulness.
Carter has criticized Kissinger's dip
lomatic style in general, calling it a
secretive, one-man, "Lone Ranger"
approach.
Africa — African leaders have just
rejected a proposed Rhodesian settle
ment partially negotiated by Kis
singer. The fate of the settlement is a
very tentative question and for that
reason, Africa is a topic upon which
Carter has not significantly com
mented.
Keohane said, "Carter can hardly do
anything but applaud progress toward
averting a racial war."
Assoc. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, who teaches courses on
tropical and southern Africa, agreed
with his colleague and said of the
Rhodesia situation, "I don't think it's
going to make much difference to
Ford's re-election."
Slurs hurt Ford
Abernethy pointed out that Ford's
hope of winning the favor of America's
black constituency with his new
found interest in Africa has been
crushed by the publicity of the racial
slurs uttered by former Secretary of
Agriculture Earl Butz.
Southeast Asia and China — Re
member Vietnam? No one else seems
to, least of all the candidates. Asst.
Political Science Prof. Franklin Weins
tein reported that only one person — a
lawyer who had dealings in southeast
Asia — is writing about southeast
Asian policy for the Carter task force.
A Ford spokesman yesterday said
the White House disagrees with a con
clusion drawn by the General Ac
counting Office (GAO) that hasty ac
tion and faulty intelligence resulted in

the death of 41 American marines and
Air Force men sent to rescue members
of the merchant ship Mayaguez last
year, according to the Associated
Press.
The GAO reported that U.S. marines
were ordered to invade Koh Tang is
land in the Gulf of Thailand to rescue
the crew of the Mayaguez, which had
been seized by Cambodians, even
though pilots had reported that the
crew was on a fishing boat and not on
the tiny island.
Dump Taiwan?
Ghina, unlike Vietnam, is an ever
growing factor in U.S. foreign policy.
However, China's fate after the death
of Mao Tse-tung remains a mystery to
China analysts as well as Carter and
Ford.
Taiwan remains a worrisome pawn
in relations with the People's Republic
of China. Weinstein, who teaches clas
ses on east Asia, said no matter who is
elected, "The assumption that most
scholars make (is) that after the elec
tion, the Taiwan government will be
dumped."
Carter has indicated he favors this
position, suggesting emulation of Ja
pan's policy of full diplomatic rela
tions with China and strong trade rela
tions with Taiwan.
Viewers who had trouble differen
tiating between the stands of Gerald
Ford and Jimmy Carter as the candi
dates debated domestic issues last
month can expect similar difficulty
when the debaters tackle forergn pol
icy and defense tonight.
"1 suppose I would be surprised if
there were sharp substantive differ
ences," said Robert Keohane, acting

chairman of the Political Science De
partment.
In contrast to the Vietnam
preoccupied campaigns of the past,
this peacetime election has seen little
controversy over foreign policy. What
President Ford and former Governor
Carter do differ on is defense and. to a

lesser extent, relations with that coun
try so entangled with our defense, the
Soviet Union.
The following is a summary of
Ford's and Carter's stands:
Detente — Jan Triska, a political sci
ence professor here called detente the
"hot potato" issue. Both candidates
have been backing away from this pol
icy that is so closely connected with
the Nixon Administration and Secret
ary of State Henry Kissinger.
Ford has emphasized strength in
dealing with the Soviet Union: "De
tente literally means 'easing' or 're
laxing,' but definitely not —and I em
phasize not —the relaxing of diligence
or easing of effort. . . .To me, detente
means a fervent desire for peace—but
not peace at any price."
Active U.S. presence
Carter also underlines the need for
strength saying "I feel the U.S. policy
of detente has given up too much to the
Russians and gotten too little in re
turn." However, Carter also advocates
more contact with other communist
countries: "Our vision must be of a
more pluralistic world and not of a
communist monolith. We must pay
more attention to China and to Eastern
Europe."
Triska, who is writing position pap
ers for Carter on Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union, has suggested to Car
ter the tactic of negotiating separately
with Eastern European countries as
well as with the Soviet Union in order
to show a more active U.S. presence in
the area.
In addition tobuilding relationships
with communist countries. Carter has
indicated he intends to strengthen
traditional alliances with Western
Europe, Japan and other allies.
SALT negotiations — One of the
chief reasons for easing tensions with
the Soviet Union is to move ahead on
the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks
(SALT).
Both candidates agree on the princi
ple of arms control but differ on the
urgency of reaching definite control
agreements. While Ford has said. "We
are under no time pressure (to
negotiate SALT II)," Carter said, "The

longer effective arms reduction is
postponed, the more likely it is that
other nations will be encouraged to
develop their own nuclear capability."
Carter has criticized the SALT talks
for merely "changing the buildup in
strategic arms from a 'quantitative' to a
'qualitative' arms race."
SALT talks delay explained
According to Political Science Prof.
Lawrence Weiler, a former SALT
negotiator, the "quantitative" aspect
of SALT II — setting ceilings on the
number of ballistic missiles, heavy
bombers and re-entry vehicles — was
basically agreed upon in 1974. What is
delaying SALT 11, Weiler said, is the
"qualitative" aspect — what types of
weapons fall under the categories
being limited.
Despite this delay, Ford has signed a
treaty with the Soviets as part of the
SALT talks which will provide limits
for underground nuclear explosions
and reciprocal inspection by Soviet
and American scientists of each na
tion's testing sites.
Notwithstanding this treaty, Carter
has proposed a five-year U.S.-Soviet
treaty to ban all weapons and non-war

Carter has criticized Kissinger's dip
lomatic style in general, calling it a
secretive, one-man, "Lone Ranger"
approach.
Africa — African leaders have just
rejected a proposed Rhodesian settle
ment partially negotiated by Kis
singer. The fate of the settlement is a
very tentative question and for that
reason, Africa is a topic upon which
Carter has not significantly com
mented.
Keohane said, "Carter can hardly do
anything but applaud progress toward
averting a racial war."
Assoc. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, who teaches courses on
tropical and southern Africa, agreed
with his colleague and said of the
Rhodesia situation, "I don't think it's
going to make much difference to
Ford's re-election."
Slurs hurt Ford
Abernethy pointed out that Ford's
hope of winning the favor of America's
black constituency with his new
found interest in Africa has been
crushed by the publicity of the racial
slurs uttered by former Secretary of
Agriculture Earl Butz.
Southeast Asia and China — Re
member Vietnam? No one else seems
to, least of all the candidates. Asst.
Political Science Prof. Franklin Weins
tein reported that only one person — a
lawyer who had dealings in southeast
Asia — is writing about southeast
Asian policy for the Carter task force.
A Ford spokesman yesterday said
the White House disagrees with a con
clusion drawn by the General Ac
counting Office (GAO) that hasty ac
tion and faulty intelligence resulted in

the death of 41 American marines and
Air Force men sent to rescue members
of the merchant ship Mayaguez last
year, according to the Associated
Press.
The GAO reported that U.S. marines
were ordered to invade Koh Tang is
land in the Gulf of Thailand to rescue
the crew of the Mayaguez, which had
been seized by Cambodians, even
though pilots had reported that the
crew was on a fishing boat and not on
the tiny island.
Dump Taiwan?
Ghina, unlike Vietnam, is an ever
growing factor in U.S. foreign policy.
However, China's fate after the death
of Mao Tse-tung remains a mystery to
China analysts as well as Carter and
Ford.
Taiwan remains a worrisome pawn
in relations with the People's Republic
of China. Weinstein, who teaches clas
ses on east Asia, said no matter who is
elected, "The assumption that most
scholars make (is) that after the elec
tion, the Taiwan government will be
dumped."
Carter has indicated he favors this
position, suggesting emulation of Ja
pan's policy of full diplomatic rela
tions with China and strong trade rela
tions with Taiwan.
Viewers who had trouble differen
tiating between the stands of Gerald
Ford and Jimmy Carter as the candi
dates debated domestic issues last
month can expect similar difficulty
when the debaters tackle forergn pol
icy and defense tonight.
"1 suppose I would be surprised if
there were sharp substantive differ
ences," said Robert Keohane, acting

chairman of the Political Science De
partment.
In contrast to the Vietnam
preoccupied campaigns of the past,
this peacetime election has seen little
controversy over foreign policy. What
President Ford and former Governor
Carter do differ on is defense and. to a

lesser extent, relations with that coun
try so entangled with our defense, the
Soviet Union.
The following is a summary of
Ford's and Carter's stands:
Detente — Jan Triska, a political sci
ence professor here called detente the
"hot potato" issue. Both candidates
have been backing away from this pol
icy that is so closely connected with
the Nixon Administration and Secret
ary of State Henry Kissinger.
Ford has emphasized strength in
dealing with the Soviet Union: "De
tente literally means 'easing' or 're
laxing,' but definitely not —and I em
phasize not —the relaxing of diligence
or easing of effort. . . .To me, detente
means a fervent desire for peace—but
not peace at any price."
Active U.S. presence
Carter also underlines the need for
strength saying "I feel the U.S. policy
of detente has given up too much to the
Russians and gotten too little in re
turn." However, Carter also advocates
more contact with other communist
countries: "Our vision must be of a
more pluralistic world and not of a
communist monolith. We must pay
more attention to China and to Eastern
Europe."
Triska, who is writing position pap
ers for Carter on Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union, has suggested to Car
ter the tactic of negotiating separately
with Eastern European countries as
well as with the Soviet Union in order
to show a more active U.S. presence in
the area.
In addition tobuilding relationships
with communist countries. Carter has
indicated he intends to strengthen
traditional alliances with Western
Europe, Japan and other allies.
SALT negotiations — One of the
chief reasons for easing tensions with
the Soviet Union is to move ahead on
the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks
(SALT).
Both candidates agree on the princi
ple of arms control but differ on the
urgency of reaching definite control
agreements. While Ford has said. "We
are under no time pressure (to
negotiate SALT II)," Carter said, "The

longer effective arms reduction is
postponed, the more likely it is that
other nations will be encouraged to
develop their own nuclear capability."
Carter has criticized the SALT talks
for merely "changing the buildup in
strategic arms from a 'quantitative' to a
'qualitative' arms race."
SALT talks delay explained
According to Political Science Prof.
Lawrence Weiler, a former SALT
negotiator, the "quantitative" aspect
of SALT II — setting ceilings on the
number of ballistic missiles, heavy
bombers and re-entry vehicles — was
basically agreed upon in 1974. What is
delaying SALT 11, Weiler said, is the
"qualitative" aspect — what types of
weapons fall under the categories
being limited.
Despite this delay, Ford has signed a
treaty with the Soviets as part of the
SALT talks which will provide limits
for underground nuclear explosions
and reciprocal inspection by Soviet
and American scientists of each na
tion's testing sites.
Notwithstanding this treaty, Carter
has proposed a five-year U.S.-Soviet
treaty to ban all weapons and non-war
nuclear testing.
Weapons — While advocating arms
control abroad, neither candidate has
dismissed developing new weapons at
home. Ford and Carter both support
development of the Trident sub
marine.
B-l bomber needed?
Carter disagrees with Ford's view
that the more controversial B-l bomber
should be built now, but still supports
continued research on the bomber.
(The Pentagon has already spent over
$2 billion on research.)
Carter has denounced the strategic
bomber with varying degrees of inten
sity, saying at one point, "The B-l
bomber is an example of a proposed
system which should not be funded
and would be wasteful of taxpayers'
dollars." then saying, "We ought to
keep the B-l bomber as a potential
weapon and not authorize its construc
tion until it is obviously needed."
Military spending —Carter wants to
cut out construction of the B-l bomber

as one way of reducing military ex
penditures (although Ford contends
that any delay would simply add to the
bomber's estimated $21.6 bil lion cost).
Ford has reacted sharply to Carter's
intention of trimming $5 to 7 billion
each year from the defense budget.
With such cuts, Ford maintains that "it

would be impossible to have a defense
adequate to maintain our freedom and
the freedom of our friends."
Ford has just submitted a record
high peacetime defense budget of
$112.7 billion for fiscal year 1977.
Carter hopes to cut the defense
budget by trimming the "fat and
frills," being "hard-headed in the de
velopment of new weapons systems"
and by reducing the number of un

necessary upper-level military per
sonnel.
Carter has also hinted at troop reduc
tions or withdrawals from Thailand,
the Philippines and, at one point, the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO). In addition, Carter has consi
dered a phased withdrawal of troops
over a four- or five-year period from
South Korea, although he said he
would keep U.S. Air Force squadrons
there to maintain what he termed
"adequate air cover."
It is this contemplated withdrawal
from South Korea that Ford has par
ticularly attacked, calling it"the voice
of retreat" and declaring himself
against any "unilateral phased with
drawal."
Mideast — Although the president
has proposed an increase for the de
fense budget as a whole, his military
aid to Israel in fiscal year 1977 is $500
million less than this year's amount.
Courting Jewish vote
Michel Nabti, a news analyst for
KQED and a fellow at Hoover Institu
tion, said he thought Carter would at
tack Ford on this reduction because of

what Nabti terms "the political reality
of Jewish voters."
No doubt mindful of this "political
reality," both Ford and Carter concur
in traditional U.S. support of Israel.
However, the Ford administration
recently lobbied for and received a re
versal of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee's threat to veto $30 million
of arms for Saudi Arabia.
Carter and Ford are both anxious to
achieve peace in the Mideast, but Car
ter says he believes Kissinger's shuttle
diplomacy has reached the end of its
usefulness.
Carter has criticized Kissinger's dip
lomatic style in general, calling it a
secretive, one-man, "Lone Ranger"
approach.

ence professor here called detente the
"hot potato" issue. Both candidates
have been backing away from this pol
icy that is so closely connected with
the Nixon Administration and Secret
ary of State Henry Kissinger.
Ford has emphasized strength in
dealing with the Soviet Union: "De
tente literally means 'easing' or 're
laxing,' but definitely not —and I em
phasize not —the relaxing of diligence
or easing of effort. . . .To me, detente
means a fervent desire for peace—but
not peace at any price."
Active U.S. presence
Carter also underlines the need for
strength saying "I feel the U.S. policy
of detente has given up too much to the
Russians and gotten too little in re
turn." However, Carter also advocates
more contact with other communist
countries: "Our vision must be of a
more pluralistic world and not of a
communist monolith. We must pay
more attention to China and to Eastern
Europe."
Triska, who is writing position pap
ers for Carter on Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union, has suggested to Car
ter the tactic of negotiating separately
with Eastern European countries as
well as with the Soviet Union in order
to show a more active U.S. presence in
the area.
In addition tobuilding relationships
with communist countries. Carter has
indicated he intends to strengthen
traditional alliances with Western
Europe, Japan and other allies.
SALT negotiations — One of the
chief reasons for easing tensions with
the Soviet Union is to move ahead on
the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks
(SALT).
Both candidates agree on the princi
ple of arms control but differ on the
urgency of reaching definite control
agreements. While Ford has said. "We
are under no time pressure (to
negotiate SALT II)," Carter said, "The

longer effective arms reduction is
postponed, the more likely it is that
other nations will be encouraged to
develop their own nuclear capability."
Carter has criticized the SALT talks
for merely "changing the buildup in
strategic arms from a 'quantitative' to a
'qualitative' arms race."
SALT talks delay explained
According to Political Science Prof.
Lawrence Weiler, a former SALT
negotiator, the "quantitative" aspect
of SALT II — setting ceilings on the
number of ballistic missiles, heavy
bombers and re-entry vehicles — was
basically agreed upon in 1974. What is
delaying SALT 11, Weiler said, is the
"qualitative" aspect — what types of
weapons fall under the categories
being limited.
Despite this delay, Ford has signed a
treaty with the Soviets as part of the
SALT talks which will provide limits
for underground nuclear explosions
and reciprocal inspection by Soviet
and American scientists of each na
tion's testing sites.
Notwithstanding this treaty, Carter
has proposed a five-year U.S.-Soviet
treaty to ban all weapons and non-war
nuclear testing.
Weapons — While advocating arms
control abroad, neither candidate has
dismissed developing new weapons at
home. Ford and Carter both support
development of the Trident sub
marine.
B-l bomber needed?
Carter disagrees with Ford's view
that the more controversial B-l bomber
should be built now, but still supports
continued research on the bomber.
(The Pentagon has already spent over
$2 billion on research.)
Carter has denounced the strategic
bomber with varying degrees of inten
sity, saying at one point, "The B-l
bomber is an example of a proposed
system which should not be funded
and would be wasteful of taxpayers'
dollars." then saying, "We ought to
keep the B-l bomber as a potential
weapon and not authorize its construc
tion until it is obviously needed."
Military spending —Carter wants to
cut out construction of the B-l bomber

as one way of reducing military ex
penditures (although Ford contends
that any delay would simply add to the
bomber's estimated $21.6 bil lion cost).
Ford has reacted sharply to Carter's
intention of trimming $5 to 7 billion
each year from the defense budget.
With such cuts, Ford maintains that "it

would be impossible to have a defense
adequate to maintain our freedom and
the freedom of our friends."
Ford has just submitted a record
high peacetime defense budget of
$112.7 billion for fiscal year 1977.
Carter hopes to cut the defense
budget by trimming the "fat and
frills," being "hard-headed in the de
velopment of new weapons systems"
and by reducing the number of un

necessary upper-level military per
sonnel.
Carter has also hinted at troop reduc
tions or withdrawals from Thailand,
the Philippines and, at one point, the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO). In addition, Carter has consi
dered a phased withdrawal of troops
over a four- or five-year period from
South Korea, although he said he
would keep U.S. Air Force squadrons
there to maintain what he termed
"adequate air cover."
It is this contemplated withdrawal
from South Korea that Ford has par
ticularly attacked, calling it"the voice
of retreat" and declaring himself
against any "unilateral phased with
drawal."
Mideast — Although the president
has proposed an increase for the de
fense budget as a whole, his military
aid to Israel in fiscal year 1977 is $500
million less than this year's amount.
Courting Jewish vote
Michel Nabti, a news analyst for
KQED and a fellow at Hoover Institu
tion, said he thought Carter would at
tack Ford on this reduction because of

what Nabti terms "the political reality
of Jewish voters."
No doubt mindful of this "political
reality," both Ford and Carter concur
in traditional U.S. support of Israel.
However, the Ford administration
recently lobbied for and received a re
versal of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee's threat to veto $30 million
of arms for Saudi Arabia.
Carter and Ford are both anxious to
achieve peace in the Mideast, but Car
ter says he believes Kissinger's shuttle
diplomacy has reached the end of its
usefulness.
Carter has criticized Kissinger's dip
lomatic style in general, calling it a
secretive, one-man, "Lone Ranger"
approach.
Africa — African leaders have just
rejected a proposed Rhodesian settle
ment partially negotiated by Kis
singer. The fate of the settlement is a
very tentative question and for that
reason, Africa is a topic upon which
Carter has not significantly com
mented.
Keohane said, "Carter can hardly do
anything but applaud progress toward
averting a racial war."
Assoc. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, who teaches courses on
tropical and southern Africa, agreed
with his colleague and said of the
Rhodesia situation, "I don't think it's
going to make much difference to
Ford's re-election."
Slurs hurt Ford
Abernethy pointed out that Ford's
hope of winning the favor of America's
black constituency with his new
found interest in Africa has been
crushed by the publicity of the racial
slurs uttered by former Secretary of
Agriculture Earl Butz.
Southeast Asia and China — Re
member Vietnam? No one else seems
to, least of all the candidates. Asst.
Political Science Prof. Franklin Weins
tein reported that only one person — a
lawyer who had dealings in southeast
Asia — is writing about southeast
Asian policy for the Carter task force.
A Ford spokesman yesterday said
the White House disagrees with a con
clusion drawn by the General Ac
counting Office (GAO) that hasty ac
tion and faulty intelligence resulted in

the death of 41 American marines and
Air Force men sent to rescue members
of the merchant ship Mayaguez last
year, according to the Associated
Press.
The GAO reported that U.S. marines
were ordered to invade Koh Tang is
land in the Gulf of Thailand to rescue
the crew of the Mayaguez, which had
been seized by Cambodians, even
though pilots had reported that the
crew was on a fishing boat and not on
the tiny island.
Dump Taiwan?
Ghina, unlike Vietnam, is an ever
growing factor in U.S. foreign policy.
However, China's fate after the death
of Mao Tse-tung remains a mystery to
China analysts as well as Carter and
Ford.
Taiwan remains a worrisome pawn
in relations with the People's Republic
of China. Weinstein, who teaches clas
ses on east Asia, said no matter who is
elected, "The assumption that most
scholars make (is) that after the elec
tion, the Taiwan government will be
dumped."
Carter has indicated he favors this
position, suggesting emulation of Ja
pan's policy of full diplomatic rela
tions with China and strong trade rela
tions with Taiwan.
Viewers who had trouble differen
tiating between the stands of Gerald
Ford and Jimmy Carter as the candi
dates debated domestic issues last
month can expect similar difficulty
when the debaters tackle forergn pol
icy and defense tonight.
"1 suppose I would be surprised if
there were sharp substantive differ
ences," said Robert Keohane, acting

chairman of the Political Science De
partment.
In contrast to the Vietnam
preoccupied campaigns of the past,
this peacetime election has seen little
controversy over foreign policy. What
President Ford and former Governor
Carter do differ on is defense and. to a

lesser extent, relations with that coun
try so entangled with our defense, the
Soviet Union.
The following is a summary of
Ford's and Carter's stands:

and would be wasteful of taxpayers'
dollars." then saying, "We ought to
keep the B-l bomber as a potential
weapon and not authorize its construc
tion until it is obviously needed."
Military spending —Carter wants to
cut out construction of the B-l bomber

as one way of reducing military ex
penditures (although Ford contends
that any delay would simply add to the
bomber's estimated $21.6 bil lion cost).
Ford has reacted sharply to Carter's
intention of trimming $5 to 7 billion
each year from the defense budget.
With such cuts, Ford maintains that "it

would be impossible to have a defense
adequate to maintain our freedom and
the freedom of our friends."
Ford has just submitted a record
high peacetime defense budget of
$112.7 billion for fiscal year 1977.
Carter hopes to cut the defense
budget by trimming the "fat and
frills," being "hard-headed in the de
velopment of new weapons systems"
and by reducing the number of un

necessary upper-level military per
sonnel.
Carter has also hinted at troop reduc
tions or withdrawals from Thailand,
the Philippines and, at one point, the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO). In addition, Carter has consi
dered a phased withdrawal of troops
over a four- or five-year period from
South Korea, although he said he
would keep U.S. Air Force squadrons
there to maintain what he termed
"adequate air cover."
It is this contemplated withdrawal
from South Korea that Ford has par
ticularly attacked, calling it"the voice
of retreat" and declaring himself
against any "unilateral phased with
drawal."
Mideast — Although the president
has proposed an increase for the de
fense budget as a whole, his military
aid to Israel in fiscal year 1977 is $500
million less than this year's amount.
Courting Jewish vote
Michel Nabti, a news analyst for
KQED and a fellow at Hoover Institu
tion, said he thought Carter would at
tack Ford on this reduction because of

what Nabti terms "the political reality
of Jewish voters."
No doubt mindful of this "political
reality," both Ford and Carter concur
in traditional U.S. support of Israel.
However, the Ford administration
recently lobbied for and received a re
versal of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee's threat to veto $30 million
of arms for Saudi Arabia.
Carter and Ford are both anxious to
achieve peace in the Mideast, but Car
ter says he believes Kissinger's shuttle
diplomacy has reached the end of its
usefulness.
Carter has criticized Kissinger's dip
lomatic style in general, calling it a
secretive, one-man, "Lone Ranger"
approach.
Africa — African leaders have just
rejected a proposed Rhodesian settle
ment partially negotiated by Kis
singer. The fate of the settlement is a
very tentative question and for that
reason, Africa is a topic upon which
Carter has not significantly com
mented.
Keohane said, "Carter can hardly do
anything but applaud progress toward
averting a racial war."
Assoc. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, who teaches courses on
tropical and southern Africa, agreed
with his colleague and said of the
Rhodesia situation, "I don't think it's
going to make much difference to
Ford's re-election."
Slurs hurt Ford
Abernethy pointed out that Ford's
hope of winning the favor of America's
black constituency with his new
found interest in Africa has been
crushed by the publicity of the racial
slurs uttered by former Secretary of
Agriculture Earl Butz.
Southeast Asia and China — Re
member Vietnam? No one else seems
to, least of all the candidates. Asst.
Political Science Prof. Franklin Weins
tein reported that only one person — a
lawyer who had dealings in southeast
Asia — is writing about southeast
Asian policy for the Carter task force.
A Ford spokesman yesterday said
the White House disagrees with a con
clusion drawn by the General Ac
counting Office (GAO) that hasty ac
tion and faulty intelligence resulted in

the death of 41 American marines and
Air Force men sent to rescue members
of the merchant ship Mayaguez last
year, according to the Associated
Press.
The GAO reported that U.S. marines
were ordered to invade Koh Tang is
land in the Gulf of Thailand to rescue
the crew of the Mayaguez, which had
been seized by Cambodians, even
though pilots had reported that the
crew was on a fishing boat and not on
the tiny island.
Dump Taiwan?
Ghina, unlike Vietnam, is an ever
growing factor in U.S. foreign policy.
However, China's fate after the death
of Mao Tse-tung remains a mystery to
China analysts as well as Carter and
Ford.
Taiwan remains a worrisome pawn
in relations with the People's Republic
of China. Weinstein, who teaches clas
ses on east Asia, said no matter who is
elected, "The assumption that most
scholars make (is) that after the elec
tion, the Taiwan government will be
dumped."
Carter has indicated he favors this
position, suggesting emulation of Ja
pan's policy of full diplomatic rela
tions with China and strong trade rela
tions with Taiwan.
Viewers who had trouble differen
tiating between the stands of Gerald
Ford and Jimmy Carter as the candi
dates debated domestic issues last
month can expect similar difficulty
when the debaters tackle forergn pol
icy and defense tonight.
"1 suppose I would be surprised if
there were sharp substantive differ
ences," said Robert Keohane, acting

chairman of the Political Science De
partment.
In contrast to the Vietnam
preoccupied campaigns of the past,
this peacetime election has seen little
controversy over foreign policy. What
President Ford and former Governor
Carter do differ on is defense and. to a

lesser extent, relations with that coun
try so entangled with our defense, the
Soviet Union.
The following is a summary of
Ford's and Carter's stands:
Detente — Jan Triska, a political sci
ence professor here called detente the
"hot potato" issue. Both candidates
have been backing away from this pol
icy that is so closely connected with
the Nixon Administration and Secret
ary of State Henry Kissinger.
Ford has emphasized strength in
dealing with the Soviet Union: "De
tente literally means 'easing' or 're
laxing,' but definitely not —and I em
phasize not —the relaxing of diligence
or easing of effort. . . .To me, detente
means a fervent desire for peace—but
not peace at any price."
Active U.S. presence
Carter also underlines the need for
strength saying "I feel the U.S. policy
of detente has given up too much to the
Russians and gotten too little in re
turn." However, Carter also advocates
more contact with other communist
countries: "Our vision must be of a
more pluralistic world and not of a
communist monolith. We must pay
more attention to China and to Eastern
Europe."
Triska, who is writing position pap
ers for Carter on Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union, has suggested to Car
ter the tactic of negotiating separately
with Eastern European countries as
well as with the Soviet Union in order
to show a more active U.S. presence in
the area.
In addition tobuilding relationships
with communist countries. Carter has
indicated he intends to strengthen
traditional alliances with Western
Europe, Japan and other allies.
SALT negotiations — One of the
chief reasons for easing tensions with
the Soviet Union is to move ahead on
the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks
(SALT).
Both candidates agree on the princi
ple of arms control but differ on the
urgency of reaching definite control
agreements. While Ford has said. "We
are under no time pressure (to
negotiate SALT II)," Carter said, "The

longer effective arms reduction is
postponed, the more likely it is that
other nations will be encouraged to
develop their own nuclear capability."
Carter has criticized the SALT talks
for merely "changing the buildup in
strategic arms from a 'quantitative' to a
'qualitative' arms race."
SALT talks delay explained
According to Political Science Prof.
Lawrence Weiler, a former SALT
negotiator, the "quantitative" aspect
of SALT II — setting ceilings on the
number of ballistic missiles, heavy
bombers and re-entry vehicles — was
basically agreed upon in 1974. What is
delaying SALT 11, Weiler said, is the
"qualitative" aspect — what types of
weapons fall under the categories
being limited.
Despite this delay, Ford has signed a
treaty with the Soviets as part of the
SALT talks which will provide limits
for underground nuclear explosions
and reciprocal inspection by Soviet
and American scientists of each na
tion's testing sites.
Notwithstanding this treaty, Carter
has proposed a five-year U.S.-Soviet
treaty to ban all weapons and non-war
nuclear testing.
Weapons — While advocating arms
control abroad, neither candidate has
dismissed developing new weapons at
home. Ford and Carter both support
development of the Trident sub
marine.
B-l bomber needed?
Carter disagrees with Ford's view
that the more controversial B-l bomber
should be built now, but still supports
continued research on the bomber.
(The Pentagon has already spent over
$2 billion on research.)
Carter has denounced the strategic
bomber with varying degrees of inten
sity, saying at one point, "The B-l
bomber is an example of a proposed
system which should not be funded
and would be wasteful of taxpayers'
dollars." then saying, "We ought to
keep the B-l bomber as a potential
weapon and not authorize its construc
tion until it is obviously needed."

as one way of reducing military ex
penditures (although Ford contends
