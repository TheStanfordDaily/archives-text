# Ford, Carter face-off on defense
## Profs say stands lack 'substantive differences' 
### Laura Kennedy 
Viewers who had trouble differen
tiating between the stands of Gerald
Ford and Jimmy Carter as the candi
dates debated domestic issues last
month can expect similar difficulty
when the debaters tackle forergn pol
icy and defense tonight.
"1 suppose I would be surprised if
there were sharp substantive differ
ences," said Robert Keohane, acting

chairman of the Political Science De
partment.
In contrast to the Vietnam
preoccupied campaigns of the past,
this peacetime election has seen little
controversy over foreign policy. What
President Ford and former Governor
Carter do differ on is defense and. to a

lesser extent, relations with that coun
try so entangled with our defense, the
Soviet Union.
The following is a summary of
Ford's and Carter's stands:
Detente — Jan Triska, a political sci
ence professor here called detente the
"hot potato" issue. Both candidates
have been backing away from this pol
icy that is so closely connected with
the Nixon Administration and Secret
ary of State Henry Kissinger.
Ford has emphasized strength in
dealing with the Soviet Union: "De
tente literally means 'easing' or 're
laxing,' but definitely not —and I em
phasize not —the relaxing of diligence
or easing of effort. . . .To me, detente
means a fervent desire for peace—but
not peace at any price."
Active U.S. presence
Carter also underlines the need for
strength saying "I feel the U.S. policy
of detente has given up too much to the
Russians and gotten too little in re
turn." However, Carter also advocates
more contact with other communist
countries: "Our vision must be of a
more pluralistic world and not of a
communist monolith. We must pay
more attention to China and to Eastern
Europe."
Triska, who is writing position pap
ers for Carter on Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union, has suggested to Car
ter the tactic of negotiating separately
with Eastern European countries as
well as with the Soviet Union in order
to show a more active U.S. presence in
the area.
In addition tobuilding relationships
with communist countries. Carter has
indicated he intends to strengthen
traditional alliances with Western
Europe, Japan and other allies.
SALT negotiations — One of the
chief reasons for easing tensions with
the Soviet Union is to move ahead on
the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks
(SALT).
Both candidates agree on the princi
ple of arms control but differ on the
urgency of reaching definite control
agreements. While Ford has said. "We
are under no time pressure (to
negotiate SALT II)," Carter said, "The

longer effective arms reduction is
postponed, the more likely it is that
other nations will be encouraged to
develop their own nuclear capability."
Carter has criticized the SALT talks
for merely "changing the buildup in
strategic arms from a 'quantitative' to a
'qualitative' arms race."
SALT talks delay explained
According to Political Science Prof.
Lawrence Weiler, a former SALT
negotiator, the "quantitative" aspect
of SALT II — setting ceilings on the
number of ballistic missiles, heavy
bombers and re-entry vehicles — was
basically agreed upon in 1974. What is
delaying SALT 11, Weiler said, is the
"qualitative" aspect — what types of
weapons fall under the categories
being limited.
Despite this delay, Ford has signed a
treaty with the Soviets as part of the
SALT talks which will provide limits
for underground nuclear explosions
and reciprocal inspection by Soviet
and American scientists of each na
tion's testing sites.
Notwithstanding this treaty, Carter
has proposed a five-year U.S.-Soviet
treaty to ban all weapons and non-war
nuclear testing.
Weapons — While advocating arms
control abroad, neither candidate has
dismissed developing new weapons at
home. Ford and Carter both support
development of the Trident sub
marine.
B-l bomber needed?
Carter disagrees with Ford's view
that the more controversial B-l bomber
should be built now, but still supports
continued research on the bomber.
(The Pentagon has already spent over
$2 billion on research.)
Carter has denounced the strategic
bomber with varying degrees of inten
sity, saying at one point, "The B-l
bomber is an example of a proposed
system which should not be funded
and would be wasteful of taxpayers'
dollars." then saying, "We ought to
keep the B-l bomber as a potential
weapon and not authorize its construc
tion until it is obviously needed."
Military spending —Carter wants to
cut out construction of the B-l bomber

as one way of reducing military ex
penditures (although Ford contends
that any delay would simply add to the
bomber's estimated $21.6 bil lion cost).
Ford has reacted sharply to Carter's
intention of trimming $5 to 7 billion
each year from the defense budget.
With such cuts, Ford maintains that "it

would be impossible to have a defense
adequate to maintain our freedom and
the freedom of our friends."
Ford has just submitted a record
high peacetime defense budget of
$112.7 billion for fiscal year 1977.
Carter hopes to cut the defense
budget by trimming the "fat and
frills," being "hard-headed in the de
velopment of new weapons systems"
and by reducing the number of un
