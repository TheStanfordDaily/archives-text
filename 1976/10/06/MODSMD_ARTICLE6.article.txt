# ASSU performs important function
##

Petroff et at.

On Oct. 13 and 14, students here will
once again be asked to participate in an
ASSU Senate election, and once again,
most of them will choose not to do so.
The high level of skepticism which
surrounds such an election is not sur
prising; in fact, the behavior of many
senators of the immediate past may ac
tually justify it.
Yet, the fact that this skepticism
generates apathy among students is
annoying, for regardless of one's opin
ion of the ASSU, important decisions
are being made within it.
In many cases, decisions made
within (he ASSU are in response to
actions'taken by university adminis
trators. In the absence of such re
sponses, could there exist any assur
ance that student voices would be
heard in situations involving, for in
stance. alleged violations of the Honor
Code or the Fundamental Standard?
Could we rest assured that the ad
ministration would always voluntarily
solicit student input in the areas of
budget priorities, parking policy, or
tenure review procedures? We think
not, and we find it most discouraging
that student apathy will cause interest
in the senate to decline even further at
a time when students are in need of
responsible representation.

We, as members of the Council ot
Presidents (COP), are taking an active
interest in the upcoming senate elec
tion. In the past, lack of a strong bond
between the COP and the senate has
caused the ASSU many unnecessary
internal problems. We hope to al
leviate them.
This year, the COP and the senate
will deal with issues which will affect
the Stanford community for many
years to come. The university's current
tenure review procedures will come
under question. Changes will be con
sidered in the campus judicial system.
Even the question of reforming the
structure of the senate itself will come
before the senate.
Decisions will be made in these and
many other areas this year, and the se
nate will play a significant role in the
process.
If you are interested in participating
in any of the decisions which will be
made this year, consider running for
the senate. Petitions are available in
the ASSU offices, and must be turned
in by Friday.
