In her column on feminism, Ann
Sherman states that we should all be
free to choose our ideologies but she
neglects to mention that some of us,
mostly white men, have been for cen
turies and continue to be in positions
of power where ideologies are trans
lated into action.
1 ler Ms. Sugarsweet is indeed free to
believe, as she should be, that women
are not as qualified to be garbageper
sons as men, though such a belief is
untrue and irrational. But if
Sugarsweet is employed as a person
nel officer in the Dept. of Public Works
and acts on her beliefs by discriminat
ing against women applicants, she is
acting unjustly.
Such is the reality which Sherman
chooses to ignore in her philosophical
harangue. For the sake of sticking to
reality, the discriminatory personnel
officer is more likely to be a man.
Secondly, we do not develop our
ideologies in an individual vacuum,
another salient point which Sherman
ignores. Many people believe that
women tire inferior to men because
such an ideology is so deeply in
grained in our culture on all levels and

has been part of our culture for so long.
We are bom and raised on sexism.
Are we really free to choose? It takes
many feminists several traumatic
years of psychological growth to rid
our minds of vestiges of sexist influ
ence. If we are to have pervading
societal forces on our ideologies, let
them be beliefs in the basic justice of
equality of opportunity and rights
among all subgroups of people; that is,
let them be feminist and therefore
humanist beliefs.
Lastly, would this opinion have
been printed if the writer were stating
that racism as an ideology is not un
just? Would Earl Butz be under fire if
his remarks were about broads or
chicks whose spheres in life should be
limited to kitchen and bedroom?
As a woman, after all these years of
the second wave of feminism, still
striving to be recognized as the whole
person that I am, I am angry at this
continued acceptance of injustice. If
one is anti-feminist, one is sexist;
sexism as a behavior based on an
ideology is unjust.
