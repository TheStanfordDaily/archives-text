San Francisco — President Gerald
Ford and Jimmy Carter, broaching a
series of issues from the Arab oil em
bargo to morality in foreign policy, de
bated to a second straight draw in San
Francisco last night.
The foreign policy and defense de
bate, held in the Palace of Fine Arts,
was marked by a series of sharp ex
changes on the United States' in
volvement in the Middle East, prog
ress of the Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty with the Soviet Union and the
status of Eastern European nations.
Ford, who insisted there can be no
debate about "experience and results"
in his administration, made the most
controversial statement of the evening.
He said that "there will be no Soviet
domination of Eastern Europe under
the Ford administration" when Carter
questioned the effect of the Helsinki
Accord signed last year.
Ford added he did not think Poland,
Yugoslavia and Rumania "are under
the domination of communism" and
the Soviet Union.
The president showed the power of
incumbency by revealing that a list of
U.S. companies which have partici
pated in an Arab nation boycott of
firms with Jewish ownership or
employes would be made public to
day.
Other than Ford's announcement on
companies involved with the Arab
boycott, the president made no new
revelations on foreign policy. Carter,
meanwhile, had to prove that he has a

broad and sufficient background in
foreign affairs.
American people excluded
Carter, for his part, said the Ford
administration was keeping informa
tion on foreign policy from the U.S.
people and Congress, criticizing it for
not standing up to the Soviet Union in
the SALT talks.
"Every time we've madea mistake in
foreign policy," Carter said, "it has
been because the American people
have been excluded."
Ford stressed that during his ad
ministration, "not a single young
American is fighting or dying on a
foreign battle field."
Carter, who spoke first, started the
debate by saying the U.S. has declined
militarily and morally under succes
sive Republican administrations. He
specifically criticized the Ford ad
ministration and labeled Henry Kis
singer "the foreign policy president."
Carteradded the policies pursued by
the Ford administration lacked "mor
ality," a term which was used exten
sively by both candidates last night.
'Broad generalities'
Ford attacked Carter for using
"broad generalities" in his opening
remarks. He said Carter was advocat
ing a reduction of U.S. military
strength by calling for "first 15 per
cent, then nine to seven per cent then
seven to six per cent" cuts in the de
fense budget.
Throughout the debate. Ford at
tempted to portray Carter as either
hazy or flip-flopping on key foreign

policy issues.
Ford and Carter clashed over what
the Georgian described as the Ford
administration's "lack of progress"
toward signing a second SALT agree
ment. He reminded an estimated view
ing audience of 100 million that the
first SALT agreement signed last year
runs out in October of 1977.
Ford responded by noting that in
talks held with Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev, tentative agreement had
been reached on a limitation of rocket
launchers and multiple independently
targeted re-entry vehicles (MIRVs)
"which would reduce Russian
strength" but leave the U.S. unaf
fected .
Ford defended his administration's
pursuit of detente with Russia in gen
eral and the sale of grain to the Soviets
during the debate. He said that the
multi-million dollar wheat sales
helped the U.S. in meeting the in
creased costs of foreign oil.
Energy a priority
Carter said Ford had not placed a
high enough priority on developing
