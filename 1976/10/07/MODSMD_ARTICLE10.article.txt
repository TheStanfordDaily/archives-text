# U.S. needs well-defined energy policy
##

David Olsen

While domestic oil and natural gas dwindle, and
the future of nuclear power is in doubt, three trill
ion tons of coal — enough to satisfy the nation's
energy needs for several centuries — lie dormant
under U.S. soil.
Slightly over half this coal is in the West, stretch
ing in a huge band from Montana and North Dakota
south through Wyoming and Colorado into Utah
and New Mexico. Much of it lies right below the
surface, in seams ranging up to 100 feet thick.
Yet coal mining in the West is virtually stagnant.
And prospects for future coal development are dim.
The major reason for this is not environmental
opposition — as generally charged — but the lack of
a national energy policy, one which would mean
billions of government dollars for some but not
other branches of the industry. The facts are that
any new venture in the energy field is far beyond
the capabilities of private industry to finance. Mas
sive government funding — whether in new
sources of domestic oil and gas, nuclear or solar
power, or coal — is necessary.
Future prospects
This was the judgment of a top-level gathering of
very dejected coal company, railroad and utility
executives meeting recently to discuss how to im
prove the future prospects of America's coal indus-i

try.
At the present attempts to reclaim strip-mined
land are expensive and untested over time. Ran
chers, worried about losing their grazing lands,
have joined environmentalists to help block west
ern strip mining.
Even low-sulfur coal produces a sooty smoke
heavy with particulates and sulfur dioxide, making
it incompatible with most current air quality stan
dards.
Improvements in coal gasification technology,
meanwhile, appear to be at least several years away
— currently the victim of lack of investment. If coal
could be converted into a gas similar to the clean
burning natural gas, it could significantly reduce
the air pollution problem.
Air pollution
Techniques exist now for converting coal to gas
— the German World War II effort, for instance, was
fueled almost entirely by gas made from coal — but
coal must still be burned first, with resultant air
pollution.
However, energy industry spokesmen claim that
without a coherent national energy policy, they are
holding back on the research and development of
new energy sources and technology such as coal
gasification. They are afraid to commit themselves

on technologies that the government may never
support.
Industry resentment against the government also
centers on what they consider overburdening fed
eral restrictions — stacks of forms required to be
filed with each bureaucracy whose jurisdiction
may overlap on energy or environmental issues.
The application process alone for new power
plants, or for the conversion of existing plants to
new sources of fuel, can take years.
Undecided
Utility and coal company executives also com
plain that the government — as a result of not yet
making up its mind either to encourage or discour
age the use of coal — treats each application to mine
or bum coal on an unpredictably ad hoc basis and
tails to provide guidelines for rationalizing energy
use on either a regional or national scale.
Southern California Edison's C. Melvin Swinney
sees a dire future for the country.
"If we (the energy industry) don't get direction —
and it has to be federal," says Swinney, "our stan
dard of living will decline rapidly and we'll be
stampeded into really ruining our environment in
the rush to prevent an energy drought."

— currently the victim of lack of investment. If coal
could be converted into a gas similar to the clean
burning natural gas, it could significantly reduce
the air pollution problem.
Air pollution
Techniques exist now for converting coal to gas
— the German World War II effort, for instance, was
fueled almost entirely by gas made from coal — but
coal must still be burned first, with resultant air
pollution.
However, energy industry spokesmen claim that
without a coherent national energy policy, they are
holding back on the research and development of
new energy sources and technology such as coal
gasification. They are afraid to commit themselves

on technologies that the government may never
support.
Industry resentment against the government also
centers on what they consider overburdening fed
eral restrictions — stacks of forms required to be
filed with each bureaucracy whose jurisdiction
may overlap on energy or environmental issues.
The application process alone for new power
plants, or for the conversion of existing plants to
new sources of fuel, can take years.
Undecided
Utility and coal company executives also com
plain that the government — as a result of not yet
making up its mind either to encourage or discour
age the use of coal — treats each application to mine
or bum coal on an unpredictably ad hoc basis and
tails to provide guidelines for rationalizing energy
use on either a regional or national scale.
Southern California Edison's C. Melvin Swinney
sees a dire future for the country.
"If we (the energy industry) don't get direction —
and it has to be federal," says Swinney, "our stan
dard of living will decline rapidly and we'll be
stampeded into really ruining our environment in
the rush to prevent an energy drought."

While domestic oil and natural gas dwindle, and
the future of nuclear power is in doubt, three trill
ion tons of coal — enough to satisfy the nation's
energy needs for several centuries — lie dormant
under U.S. soil.
Slightly over half this coal is in the West, stretch
ing in a huge band from Montana and North Dakota
south through Wyoming and Colorado into Utah
and New Mexico. Much of it lies right below the
surface, in seams ranging up to 100 feet thick.
Yet coal mining in the West is virtually stagnant.
And prospects for future coal development are dim.
The major reason for this is not environmental
opposition — as generally charged — but the lack of
a national energy policy, one which would mean
billions of government dollars for some but not
other branches of the industry. The facts are that
any new venture in the energy field is far beyond
the capabilities of private industry to finance. Mas
sive government funding — whether in new
sources of domestic oil and gas, nuclear or solar
power, or coal — is necessary.
Future prospects
This was the judgment of a top-level gathering of
very dejected coal company, railroad and utility
executives meeting recently to discuss how to im
prove the future prospects of America's coal indus-i

try.
At the present attempts to reclaim strip-mined
land are expensive and untested over time. Ran
chers, worried about losing their grazing lands,
have joined environmentalists to help block west
ern strip mining.
Even low-sulfur coal produces a sooty smoke
heavy with particulates and sulfur dioxide, making
it incompatible with most current air quality stan
dards.
Improvements in coal gasification technology,
meanwhile, appear to be at least several years away
— currently the victim of lack of investment. If coal
could be converted into a gas similar to the clean
burning natural gas, it could significantly reduce
the air pollution problem.
