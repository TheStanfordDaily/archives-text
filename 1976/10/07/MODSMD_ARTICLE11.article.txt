Guilt by association
v We have read President Lyman's de
fense of his adjudication of the "Dolt
House Case" with great interest. Un
fortunately, the alleged preferential
treatment involved in the six indi
vidual cases is only one small part of
the issue.
The more serious question is the
university's use of a guilt by associa
tion principle to revoke the residence
privileges of the overwhelming major
ity ot the Delt fraternity's members and
pledges who were innocent of any
wrongdoing.
it is important to recall that the Delt
fraternity rightly joined the rest of the
university community in condemning
the senseless violence that occurred
and took action to punish the offen
ders. In spite of this, the entire frater
nity was suspended from the campus
for a staggering three-year term.
President Lyman took great care to
explain his actions as just and equita
ble. We wonder — and indeed all stu
dents should wonder — if he could
offer a similar explanation of the seem
ingly unjust action of the three-year
suspension of the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity as a whole.

I do not claim to know all the intri
cate aspects of the legal profession.
However, 1 do have a familiarity with
the fundamental principles of law, as
well as some knowledge of the basic
rights of individuals.
1 have learned that in the history of
the contemporary court, no one has
ever been punished on the basis that he
knew another individual who had
committed an unlawful action. No
one, that is, until the incident involv
ing the Delt fraternity and subsequent
university actions.
Since when does association consti
tute guilt? It is not right to punish a
whole fraternity because of the actions
of a tew of its members — especially
when a majority of the members had
no knowledge of the incident until
after it had occurred and, after learning
the details, responded to the incident
by initiating disciplinary actions.
The university's action in this case
can be compared to spanking a child
when he has not done anything wrong,

reasoning that since other children
misbehave and deserve punishment,
this child should be punished also, re
gardless of whether he has been
naughty yet or not.
This kind of "preventive medicine"
is not morally or legally just, and
should not be tolerated.

Blind justice
What Ann Sherman is saying, I
gather, is that blind justice isn't very
helpful, i.e. one that doesn't take into
account the very real differences be
tween classes of people.
For example, although there are in
dividual — slightly monstrous —
children who can perform manual
labor better than some adults;
nevertheless, most of us (given the
necessarily imperfect nature of legisla
tion for groups) believe in child labor
laws.
Likewise, there are laws that take
into account the incapacitation of
women during and shortly after
chiJdbirth and the other special con
siderations that Eleanor Roosevelt
fought for.
Tim Ferguson's idea of Utopia,
where the two sexes will be flattened

into sameness, would be less forbid
ding if it weren't for the grim statistics
coming out about what is happening to
the children of "liberated" mothers. Or
just look around, if you are seasoned
enough lo remember a time when
•children had a better chance to become
cultured and dignified human beings.

As a witness of the only fatal bike
accident at Stanford, I would like to
remind this year's Stanford commun
ity of the importance of having a light
on your bicycle or leg at night.
It is important to note that the fatal
accident occurred when two bicyc
lists, neither of whom had lighted
bikes, crashed head-on.
It would also be possible for an un
lighted bicyclist to hit a pedestrian at
night. Accidents with cars are likely
on rainy, foggy nights, and a bicyclist
wearing dark clothes, without lights,
is nearly invisible to a driver.
The money one spends on a bicycle
light is nothing when compared to
being seriously injured.

children who can perform manual
labor better than some adults;
nevertheless, most of us (given the
necessarily imperfect nature of legisla

laws.
Likewise, there are laws that take
into account the incapacitation of
women during and shortly after
chiJdbirth and the other special con
siderations that Eleanor Roosevelt
fought for.
Tim Ferguson's idea of Utopia,
where the two sexes will be flattened

As a witness of the only fatal bike
accident at Stanford, I would like to
remind this year's Stanford commun
ity of the importance of having a light
on your bicycle or leg at night.
It is important to note that the fatal
accident occurred when two bicyc
lists, neither of whom had lighted
bikes, crashed head-on.
It would also be possible for an un
lighted bicyclist to hit a pedestrian at
night. Accidents with cars are likely
on rainy, foggy nights, and a bicyclist
wearing dark clothes, without lights,
is nearly invisible to a driver.
The money one spends on a bicycle
light is nothing when compared to
being seriously injured.

Guilt by association
v We have read President Lyman's de
fense of his adjudication of the "Dolt
House Case" with great interest. Un
fortunately, the alleged preferential
treatment involved in the six indi
vidual cases is only one small part of
the issue.
The more serious question is the
university's use of a guilt by associa
tion principle to revoke the residence
privileges of the overwhelming major
ity ot the Delt fraternity's members and
pledges who were innocent of any
wrongdoing.
it is important to recall that the Delt
fraternity rightly joined the rest of the
university community in condemning
the senseless violence that occurred
and took action to punish the offen
ders. In spite of this, the entire frater
nity was suspended from the campus
for a staggering three-year term.
President Lyman took great care to
explain his actions as just and equita
ble. We wonder — and indeed all stu
dents should wonder — if he could
offer a similar explanation of the seem
ingly unjust action of the three-year
suspension of the Delta Tau Delta

I do not claim to know all the intri
cate aspects of the legal profession.
However, 1 do have a familiarity with
the fundamental principles of law, as
well as some knowledge of the basic
rights of individuals.
1 have learned that in the history of
the contemporary court, no one has
ever been punished on the basis that he
knew another individual who had
committed an unlawful action. No
one, that is, until the incident involv
ing the Delt fraternity and subsequent
university actions.
Since when does association consti
tute guilt? It is not right to punish a
whole fraternity because of the actions
of a tew of its members — especially
when a majority of the members had
no knowledge of the incident until
after it had occurred and, after learning
the details, responded to the incident
by initiating disciplinary actions.
The university's action in this case
can be compared to spanking a child
when he has not done anything wrong,

reasoning that since other children
misbehave and deserve punishment,
this child should be punished also, re
gardless of whether he has been
naughty yet or not.
This kind of "preventive medicine"
is not morally or legally just, and
should not be tolerated.
