What's the correct way to put on and take off a
condom'?
As soon as possible, in both cases. A common
misconception (in both senses of the word) sur
rounding the usage of condoms holds that a con
dom, op "rubber" — a latex or lamb-membrane
sheath made to fit over the penis — fulfills its
designed purpose as long as it is put on prior to
ejaculation.
Not so, says the Boston Women's Collective in
the book, Our Bodies, Ourselves. Indeed, the
Cowper's glands, somewhat less than copious in
attempts tu contribute to the lubrication requisite
for intercourse, produce a few drops of fluid
which inadvertently carry potent numbers of ma
ture spermatozoa from the penis. Since this fluid
first appears during foreplay, it is advisable to put
on the condom as soon as possible to dissuade any
furtive little swimmers from heading towards a
receptive egg.
The proper way to put on a condom involves the
man or woman rolling the condom down over the
former's erect penis, making sure to leave approx
imately one-half inch of air-free space at the tip to
catch the ejaculate (many innovative new designs
feature "reservoir tips" for'this purpose). Lubrica
tion of the condom is frequently necessitated to
minimize irritation to the vagina, and any water
based lubricant (i.e., K-Y Jelly, saliva, or spermi
cidal foams, jellies, or creams) will do. Petroleum
based products (e.g., vaseline, etc.) tend toward

chemical intercourse with the rubber of the con
dom. After ejaculation, the man should hold the
condom onto the base of his penis as he with
draws from the woman, otherwise the now
flaccid penis may slip out of the condom and
defeat its purpose.
Used correctly, the condom boasts an effective
ness of 85-95 per cent; virtually 100 percent if it's
used in conjunction with a spermicidal agent
(e.g., foam). And despite "Summer of '42"jokes to
the contrary, a condom may be safely reused from
one to three times (depending on your faith in
America technology) by simply rinsing it in
lukewarm water — check for leaks — allowing it
to dry, dusting it with cornstarch, and rolling it up
again. That should dispel any notions of a
"condom-minimum"!
"Under Covers" is under new management and
will run every Wednesday. It will serve us the
official organ of the "What's Your Perversion"
Society, and readers with kinky tastes are referred
to the lechers at the local campus "humor"
magazine. Questions for this column regarding
sexuality, fertility control, or sexual physiology
should be submitted to the "Under Covers" en
velope at the Daily, and your anonymity is as
sured. Since "Under Covers" is of a question
and-answer format (and I refuse to concoct ques
tions), the column's existence is contingent on
your questions. So please don't hesitate to ask.
Thanks.
