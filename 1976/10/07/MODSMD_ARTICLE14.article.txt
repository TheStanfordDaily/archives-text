# City council votes
## All adult establishments restricted 
### Roy S. Johnson 
Nude dance studios, glamor salons, mas
sage parlors, encounter studios.
Some of the names were changed after
strict regulations were placed on adult
oriented establishments in Palo Alto some
timeago.but much of the business occurring
inside remains the same.
Last week, the Palo Alto City Council de
cided it was time to tighten up controls
again.
An ordinance giving the City expanded
powers by slapping restrictions on not only
massage parlors, but adult bookstores,
"studios," or any other adult entertainment
business, was adopted unanimously by the
council.
It was voted to go into effect on an
emergency basis — that means, im
mediately. '
So what necessitated the "emergency "
status of the ordinance which seems to be
just another new strategy in the City's on
going war against the porno industry?
The new ordinance closes many

loopholes which have surfaced after previ
ous legislation by the Council, according to
Asst. City Atty. Lou Green.
There are three main restrictions set forth
bv the new measure:
—It extends licensing requirements to all
adult-oriented establishments, not just
massage parlors as was formerly required.
—It sets up minimum-distance require
ments between all establishments. Adult
businesses will be prohibited from being
located within 250 "feet of schools or resi
dential districts.
—Massage outcal Is (which are often pros
titution services, according to City staff)
will be prohibited. Legitimate health
oriented massage businesses, though, will
be exempt.
Also under the new ordinance, estab
lishments must remain closed between 11
p.m. and 9 a.m. and they must supply the
names, addresses and nature of work of all
employed.
These requirements have met with much
opposition from establishment managers

who claim that the requirements have a
great effect on business income.
Since February, no new licenses have
been issued under a moratorium on the ex
tablishment of new massage parlors, and
the city is fighting court battles over parlors
that have opened despite the ban.
The City will start enforcement of the new
regulations when the moratorium expires in
about six weeks.
Establishments operating legally will
have 60 days to obtain a license, which costs
$150.
Minimum-distance requirements,
though, will not have to be met for three
years. The longer time accounts for the
fact that businesses cannot be expected to
relocate overnight.
But if the city's plans work, the number of
such establishments in the city will drop
from 20 to about 12.
Legitimate massage businesses which
provide health-related services will not be
disturbed. The council requested a staff re
port to provide for excemptions for them.

"studios," or any other adult entertainment
business, was adopted unanimously by the
council.
It was voted to go into effect on an
emergency basis — that means, im
mediately. '
So what necessitated the "emergency "
status of the ordinance which seems to be
just another new strategy in the City's on
going war against the porno industry?
The new ordinance closes many

loopholes which have surfaced after previ
ous legislation by the Council, according to
Asst. City Atty. Lou Green.
There are three main restrictions set forth
bv the new measure:
—It extends licensing requirements to all
adult-oriented establishments, not just
massage parlors as was formerly required.
—It sets up minimum-distance require
ments between all establishments. Adult
businesses will be prohibited from being
located within 250 "feet of schools or resi
dential districts.
—Massage outcal Is (which are often pros
titution services, according to City staff)
will be prohibited. Legitimate health
oriented massage businesses, though, will
be exempt.
Also under the new ordinance, estab
lishments must remain closed between 11
p.m. and 9 a.m. and they must supply the
names, addresses and nature of work of all
employed.
These requirements have met with much
opposition from establishment managers

who claim that the requirements have a
great effect on business income.
Since February, no new licenses have
been issued under a moratorium on the ex
tablishment of new massage parlors, and
the city is fighting court battles over parlors
that have opened despite the ban.
The City will start enforcement of the new
regulations when the moratorium expires in
about six weeks.
Establishments operating legally will
have 60 days to obtain a license, which costs
$150.
Minimum-distance requirements,
though, will not have to be met for three
years. The longer time accounts for the
fact that businesses cannot be expected to
relocate overnight.
But if the city's plans work, the number of
such establishments in the city will drop
from 20 to about 12.
Legitimate massage businesses which
provide health-related services will not be
disturbed. The council requested a staff re
port to provide for excemptions for them.

Restrictions tightened
Strict regulations have been placed on all Palo Alto adult
oriented establishments by the city council. In the past, restric
tions were only placed on massage parlors.
Nude dance studios, glamor salons, mas
sage parlors, encounter studios.
Some of the names were changed after
strict regulations were placed on adult
oriented establishments in Palo Alto some
timeago.but much of the business occurring
inside remains the same.
Last week, the Palo Alto City Council de
cided it was time to tighten up controls
again.
An ordinance giving the City expanded
powers by slapping restrictions on not only
massage parlors, but adult bookstores,
"studios," or any other adult entertainment
business, was adopted unanimously by the
council.
