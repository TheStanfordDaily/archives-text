# Speaker circuit big business
## 
### 
(CPS) — "Hubert Humphrey is
the biggest swine ever to be
catapulted out of the gutter into
politics and he wouldn't know
the truth if it crawled up his leg
and bit him on the kneecap."
So says Rolling Stone
Magazine's Hunter Thompson
as he struts across the John
Hopkins University stage,
chain-smoking Dunhills, swig
ging Wild Turkey and muttering
something that most people in
the hash smoke-filled arena can't
hear anyways. He mutters some
more and then exits, whisper
ing to his aides, "Can I turn
around now, is there anything
behind me, are you sure it's all
right?"
Thompson is strutting across
stages in Australia this fall, but
the campus speaker circuit in
America rolls on and on. Speak
ers are sometimes boring, often
amusing, always eccentric and
they're now hitting colleges in
greater numbers than ever be
fore.
"Business has really multi
plied; it's really taking off,"
crows Bob Walker, president of
the American Program

Bureau(AFß) in Massachusetts,
the nation's premier college
speaker agency. The nationwide
business in campus speakers is
"very, very big," said Walker.
"I'd hate to guess how big."
Along with the big demands
for a variety of speakers goes the
large fees being commandeered.
Fees for each engagement range
from $1,000 to $5,000 for clients
of the APB firm.
Walker says his agency has
400 speakers, beginning twelve
years ago by bridging a "major
communications gap in this
country" with Dick Gregory as
their first speaker.
Walker claims to run a "very
efficient" organization, with a
sharp, bright staff of young
people and a computer.
' John Dean is hot as hell.
Ralph Nader, Julian Bond is
completely sold out — we can't
fit anyone else in." Walker
ticked off more well known
names on his list. He explained
how some speakers will only be
home for a few days out of sev
eral months on the circuit, like
Vincent Bugliosi (Charlie Man
son's prosecutor).

With so many engagements,
people do tend to get burned out.
"Sometimes they don't even
know what city they're in."
"Greg (Walker's familiarity for
Dick Gregory) does 225 dates a
year." But the fees are worth the
efforts, and APB claims up to 30
percent of those fees.
The fees appear expensive, but
Walker explains that it's a matter
of "supply and demand." He did
say that some speaker business
has more talent applicants than
they can usually handle. The
Harry Walker agency of New
York said the hiring of speakers
is very selective for their firm.
APB claims to get 30 or 40 calls a
week, rejecting more than they
can take.
The APB agency claims to
have opened the college market
to the controversial, political
people looking for a platform.
"We started Timothy Leary off,
we did all the blacks, Abbie
Hoffman, Jane Fonda, the wo
men's lib movement — we
started them off. But at the same
time we continued to have cul
tural speakers like Pearl Buck."

Lord and Dane, another Mas
sachusetts based agency, said
they too have a variety of talent
ready to meet college needs. Be
sides such names as F. Lee
Bailey, former U.S. Senator Sam
Ervin, Florence Kennedy and
George Plimpton, the firm han
dles programs like Alan Funt
and his Candid Camera show,
theCus Giordano Dance Co., and
comedian Robert Klein. David
LaCamera said the fees for that
agency range from $1500 to
$3500.
While declining to comment
about prices charged for speak
ing engagements, a Harry
Walker representative said, "We
know what the market value
is...being in the business for 30
years." Their top speakers are
William Colby, former CIA di
rector; Daniel Patrick Monyihan,
former U.N. ambassador; El
dridge Cleaver and Shirley
Chisholm D-NY.
One college in New Jersey is
going to pay Cleaver $3000 for a
talk. That same college paid
$2500 to hear from historian Ar
thur Schlesinger last year. The
steep prices for these speakers is
not causing a recession in this
field, but the agencies are in ag
reement that students making
the arrangements are very selec
tive.
With 'supply and demand'
strong, college audiences can
expect the 'market value' to re
main high and the pickings as
diverse as possible.

(CPS) — "Hubert Humphrey is
the biggest swine ever to be
catapulted out of the gutter into
politics and he wouldn't know
the truth if it crawled up his leg
and bit him on the kneecap."
So says Rolling Stone
Magazine's Hunter Thompson
as he struts across the John
Hopkins University stage,
chain-smoking Dunhills, swig
ging Wild Turkey and muttering
something that most people in
the hash smoke-filled arena can't
hear anyways. He mutters some
more and then exits, whisper
ing to his aides, "Can I turn
around now, is there anything
behind me, are you sure it's all
right?"
Thompson is strutting across
stages in Australia this fall, but
the campus speaker circuit in
America rolls on and on. Speak
ers are sometimes boring, often
amusing, always eccentric and
they're now hitting colleges in
greater numbers than ever be
fore.
"Business has really multi
plied; it's really taking off,"
crows Bob Walker, president of
the American Program

Bureau(AFß) in Massachusetts,
the nation's premier college
speaker agency. The nationwide
business in campus speakers is
"very, very big," said Walker.
"I'd hate to guess how big."
Along with the big demands
for a variety of speakers goes the
large fees being commandeered.
Fees for each engagement range
from $1,000 to $5,000 for clients
of the APB firm.
Walker says his agency has
400 speakers, beginning twelve
years ago by bridging a "major
communications gap in this
country" with Dick Gregory as
their first speaker.
Walker claims to run a "very
efficient" organization, with a
sharp, bright staff of young
people and a computer.
' John Dean is hot as hell.
Ralph Nader, Julian Bond is
completely sold out — we can't
fit anyone else in." Walker
ticked off more well known
names on his list. He explained
how some speakers will only be
home for a few days out of sev
eral months on the circuit, like
Vincent Bugliosi (Charlie Man
son's prosecutor).

With so many engagements,
people do tend to get burned out.
"Sometimes they don't even
know what city they're in."
"Greg (Walker's familiarity for
Dick Gregory) does 225 dates a
year." But the fees are worth the
efforts, and APB claims up to 30
percent of those fees.
The fees appear expensive, but
Walker explains that it's a matter
of "supply and demand." He did
say that some speaker business
has more talent applicants than
they can usually handle. The
Harry Walker agency of New
York said the hiring of speakers
is very selective for their firm.
APB claims to get 30 or 40 calls a
week, rejecting more than they
can take.
The APB agency claims to
have opened the college market
to the controversial, political
people looking for a platform.
"We started Timothy Leary off,
we did all the blacks, Abbie
Hoffman, Jane Fonda, the wo
men's lib movement — we
started them off. But at the same
time we continued to have cul
tural speakers like Pearl Buck."

Lord and Dane, another Mas
sachusetts based agency, said
they too have a variety of talent
ready to meet college needs. Be
sides such names as F. Lee
Bailey, former U.S. Senator Sam
Ervin, Florence Kennedy and

percent of those fees.
The fees appear expensive, but
Walker explains that it's a matter
of "supply and demand." He did
say that some speaker business
has more talent applicants than
they can usually handle. The
Harry Walker agency of New
York said the hiring of speakers
is very selective for their firm.
APB claims to get 30 or 40 calls a
week, rejecting more than they
can take.
The APB agency claims to
have opened the college market
to the controversial, political
people looking for a platform.
"We started Timothy Leary off,
we did all the blacks, Abbie
Hoffman, Jane Fonda, the wo
men's lib movement — we
started them off. But at the same
time we continued to have cul
tural speakers like Pearl Buck."

Lord and Dane, another Mas
sachusetts based agency, said
they too have a variety of talent
ready to meet college needs. Be
sides such names as F. Lee
Bailey, former U.S. Senator Sam
Ervin, Florence Kennedy and
George Plimpton, the firm han
dles programs like Alan Funt
and his Candid Camera show,
theCus Giordano Dance Co., and
comedian Robert Klein. David
LaCamera said the fees for that
agency range from $1500 to
$3500.
While declining to comment
about prices charged for speak
ing engagements, a Harry
Walker representative said, "We
know what the market value
is...being in the business for 30
years." Their top speakers are
William Colby, former CIA di
rector; Daniel Patrick Monyihan,
former U.N. ambassador; El
dridge Cleaver and Shirley
Chisholm D-NY.
One college in New Jersey is
going to pay Cleaver $3000 for a
talk. That same college paid
$2500 to hear from historian Ar
thur Schlesinger last year. The
steep prices for these speakers is
not causing a recession in this
field, but the agencies are in ag
reement that students making
the arrangements are very selec
tive.
With 'supply and demand'
strong, college audiences can
expect the 'market value' to re
main high and the pickings as
diverse as possible.
