# Colleges turn to magazines for national campaign
## 
### 
(CPS) — Colleges have a better
idea. Joining the ranks of busi
ness and industry around the
country, colleges are turning to
the advertising agency to pro
mote their services.
For a mere $4H()(J, a college
can take out a full-page ad in
New Yorker magazine. News
week will bill a college slightly
more, about $5105, for a similar
black and white ad which is ex
pected to reach a large regional
audience.
As commercial as this may
seem, colleges are paying these
prices.
Several schools, such as
Goucher College in Baltimore, a
women's college of about 1000
students, have pulled off suc
cessful advertising coups with
the assistance of an ad agency.
And when Indiana University

opened a new campus five years
ago, they launched an advertis
ing campaign which met their
recruitment goals within four
months, steadily eyeing Loyola
University. Indiana's com
petitor, only six miles away.
Goucher College appealed to
"the brave new woman" in an
award-winning campaign in the
spring of 1975. Working with
Van Sant and Dugdale, Inc., an
ad agency in Baltimore, Goucher
achieved national visibility and
has not felt the need to advertise
since.
Gloria 11 Dorsey, Director of
Public Relations at the college,
explained that editorial cover
age by national publications has
been as valuable as formal adver
tising. In the October, 1976 issue
of House & Gardens, there is a
series of four photographs of a

wall mural that was painted by a
Goucher professor and some
students. A reporter from the
magazine happened to see it and
the rest is public relations his
tory.
But not all publicity is free.
Declaring that "only brave new
women need apply", Goucher
ran its rull-page ad in New
Yorker and Newsweek. The
machinery of the campaign was
managed by Van Sant and Dug
dale who received 15 per cent of
the magazine charges which is
the rule with agencies. College
costs depend on the frequency
with which the ad appears in a
publication. But colleges have
hesitated to spend money to ad
vertise while their own costs
steadily rise.
"Not many administrators
have understood the true mean
ing of advertising," said Ruth
Adams, Vice President of the
Van Sant and Dugdale agency.
"Too many academics see adver
tising in terms of a Hollywood
movie," she added. With more
administrators coming from the
business community than from
the academic area, advertising is
becoming "less sinful", accord
ing to Adams. In a decade where
inflation has become an a 11-
purpose excuse for raising prices
and cutting expenditures, man)'

necessity but one which the '
cannot at ord.

And when Indiana University

opened a new campus five years
ago, they launched an advertis
ing campaign which met their
recruitment goals within four
months, steadily eyeing Loyola
University. Indiana's com
petitor, only six miles away.
Goucher College appealed to
"the brave new woman" in an
award-winning campaign in the
spring of 1975. Working with
Van Sant and Dugdale, Inc., an
ad agency in Baltimore, Goucher
achieved national visibility and
has not felt the need to advertise
since.
Gloria 11 Dorsey, Director of
Public Relations at the college,
explained that editorial cover
age by national publications has
been as valuable as formal adver
tising. In the October, 1976 issue
of House & Gardens, there is a
series of four photographs of a

wall mural that was painted by a
Goucher professor and some
students. A reporter from the
magazine happened to see it and
the rest is public relations his
tory.
But not all publicity is free.
Declaring that "only brave new
women need apply", Goucher
ran its rull-page ad in New
Yorker and Newsweek. The
machinery of the campaign was
managed by Van Sant and Dug
dale who received 15 per cent of
the magazine charges which is
the rule with agencies. College
costs depend on the frequency
with which the ad appears in a
publication. But colleges have
hesitated to spend money to ad
vertise while their own costs
steadily rise.
"Not many administrators
have understood the true mean
ing of advertising," said Ruth
Adams, Vice President of the
Van Sant and Dugdale agency.
"Too many academics see adver
tising in terms of a Hollywood
movie," she added. With more
administrators coming from the
business community than from
the academic area, advertising is
becoming "less sinful", accord
ing to Adams. In a decade where
inflation has become an a 11-
purpose excuse for raising prices
and cutting expenditures, man)'
colleges see advertising as
necessity but one which the '
cannot at ord.
(CPS) — Colleges have a better
idea. Joining the ranks of busi
ness and industry around the
country, colleges are turning to
the advertising agency to pro
mote their services.
For a mere $4H()(J, a college
can take out a full-page ad in
New Yorker magazine. News
week will bill a college slightly
more, about $5105, for a similar
black and white ad which is ex
pected to reach a large regional
audience.
As commercial as this may
seem, colleges are paying these
prices.
Several schools, such as
Goucher College in Baltimore, a
women's college of about 1000
students, have pulled off suc
cessful advertising coups with
the assistance of an ad agency.
