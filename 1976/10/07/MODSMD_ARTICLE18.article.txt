Republican Senate candidate S.I. Hayakawa condemned the
Arab boycott yesterday as U.S. Sen. John Tunney criticized him tor
not taking a stand on the issue.
Tunney later accused his GOF rival on the Nov. 2 ballot of
changing his position under political pressure.
"His switch from quivocation to opposition of the boycott has
clearly been made as a result of the storm of controversy surround
ing his position," Tunney said after learning of Hayakavva's com
ments.
"It is clear that Dr. Hayakavva's new-found stand is based not on
principal but on the crassest form of political manipulation."
Jack McDowell. I layakawa's press secretary, said the former San
Francisco State University president had always opposed the
boycott, which is aimed at firms doing business with Israel.
"But he was concerned if it would be proper to enact a law to
prohibit compliance with it." McDowell said.
The controversy stems from remarks Hayakawa made last week
after Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. signed a bill making it illegal for
California firms to participate in the boycott.
