# Truth test proposed for Carter, Ford
## 
### Dave Woodward 
Stanford emeritus professor William
Shockley has proposed that lie detec
tor (polygraph) examinations be ad
ministered to President Gerald Ford
and former Gov. Jimmy Garter on their
positions on debate issues.
In a letter to Peggy Lampl, executive
director of the League of Women Vot
ers (LWV), the retired electrical en
gineering professor suggested a four
step program to be administered by the
LWV.
First, the LWV would solicit ques
tions from the public, the press and
political organizations concerning the
truth of the candidates' stands. Those
issues raising the most doubt about a
candidate's integrity then would be
formulated into questions for use in a
polygraph examination.
Next, Shockley recommended that
the L,WV incorporate the issues in
volved into two sets of questions, one
for each candidate. After polygraph
examination questions were adminis
tered to the candidates, the results
would be released to the press and
public, Shockley said.
Shockley. a Nobel Prize winner in
physics, explained that his "concern is
with realities and truths." Shockley
said the lie detector examination
would end public confusion over the
integrity of the candidates by objec
tively determining the truth.
"This would be a contribution to
public wisdom and the electoral pro
cess because concern with honesty
would be set aside and would not dis
tract from a dispassionate appraisal of
the merits of the issue," said Shockley.
Issue for minor candidates
Shockley suggested the polygraph
examinations would provide a pro
vocative issue for those candidates
who complain of exclusion from prime
time television. Minority candidates,
aware of the proposal, "may stir things
up and it may lead to something
more," suggested Shockley.
"Selection of the issues by the LWV
would eliminate suspicion of a biased
selection of questions," he added.
Shockley paid, for example, that
Ford could be asked: "Did you have a
pardon deal for Richard Nixon?"
A question for Garter might be:
"Does your campaign deliberately
convey contradictory impressions of
vonr convictions to different groups of
voters?" said Shockley.
'Gonflicting statistics'
When asked what he felt the tests
would show. Shockley replied, "They
might reveal that both of them are
completely honest men." However, he
quoted a post-debate remark made in a
letter by mid-Peninsula resident Joe
Donahue who said, "One of the candi
dates must have lied...(There were) too
many conflicting statistics."
Shockley also said that much time in
the "Watergate uncertainty" might
have been saved "by giving a polyg
raph examination to President Nixon."

The professsor expressed doubt that
his proposal would be immediately
acted upon but said he hopes the idea
will be used in the future.
"Rome was neither built in a day nor
torn down in one," he said.

candidate's integrity then would be
formulated into questions for use in a
polygraph examination.
Next, Shockley recommended that
the L,WV incorporate the issues in
volved into two sets of questions, one
for each candidate. After polygraph
examination questions were adminis
tered to the candidates, the results
would be released to the press and
public, Shockley said.
Shockley. a Nobel Prize winner in
physics, explained that his "concern is
with realities and truths." Shockley
said the lie detector examination
would end public confusion over the
integrity of the candidates by objec
tively determining the truth.
"This would be a contribution to
public wisdom and the electoral pro
cess because concern with honesty
would be set aside and would not dis
tract from a dispassionate appraisal of
the merits of the issue," said Shockley.
Issue for minor candidates
Shockley suggested the polygraph
examinations would provide a pro
vocative issue for those candidates
who complain of exclusion from prime
time television. Minority candidates,
aware of the proposal, "may stir things
up and it may lead to something
more," suggested Shockley.
"Selection of the issues by the LWV
would eliminate suspicion of a biased
selection of questions," he added.
Shockley paid, for example, that
Ford could be asked: "Did you have a
pardon deal for Richard Nixon?"
A question for Garter might be:
"Does your campaign deliberately
convey contradictory impressions of
vonr convictions to different groups of
voters?" said Shockley.
'Gonflicting statistics'
When asked what he felt the tests
would show. Shockley replied, "They
might reveal that both of them are
completely honest men." However, he
quoted a post-debate remark made in a
letter by mid-Peninsula resident Joe
Donahue who said, "One of the candi
dates must have lied...(There were) too
many conflicting statistics."
Shockley also said that much time in
the "Watergate uncertainty" might
have been saved "by giving a polyg
raph examination to President Nixon."

The professsor expressed doubt that
his proposal would be immediately
acted upon but said he hopes the idea
will be used in the future.
"Rome was neither built in a day nor
torn down in one," he said.

Stanford emeritus professor William
Shockley has proposed that lie detec
tor (polygraph) examinations be ad
ministered to President Gerald Ford
and former Gov. Jimmy Garter on their
positions on debate issues.
In a letter to Peggy Lampl, executive
director of the League of Women Vot
ers (LWV), the retired electrical en
gineering professor suggested a four
step program to be administered by the
LWV.
First, the LWV would solicit ques
tions from the public, the press and
political organizations concerning the
truth of the candidates' stands. Those
issues raising the most doubt about a
candidate's integrity then would be
formulated into questions for use in a
polygraph examination.
Next, Shockley recommended that
the L,WV incorporate the issues in
volved into two sets of questions, one
for each candidate. After polygraph
