# Meyer library to be quieter
## 
### Kathy Trafton 
Meyer library will be a quieter
place to study this year because
of the Stanford Judicial Coun
cil's decision last spring, library
officials expect.
The SJC announced that "the
penalty for disruptive activities
might range from probation to a
suspension from the univer
sity," and most likely this will
deter any potential disruptors,
librarians indicated.
Meyer Chief Librarian
Elizabeth Salzer said that the lib
rary has not had any disruptions
yet. She explained that distur
bances occur "usually more into
the football season...and later in
the academic quarter. We are
hopeful that we will not have
any."
"Disturbances usually take
place for one of two reasons."
Salzer noted. "First, during mid
terms and finals: academic pres
sure. Second, during football

season and fraternity rush."
In the past, the Meyer Library
staff has relied on the assistance
of the police to quiet rowdy stu
dents, and it will continue to do
so. "The police are not always
called for every disruption,
though we evaluate the situation
and then determine (what action
to take)."
Students have come up with
an astonishing variety of antics
in Meyer Library over the years.
Three years ago, a fully clothed
female mannequin was flung
from the fourth floor balcony as a
girl screamed "I just can't take it
any longer." Later, a loin
clothed Tarzan chased a reluc

tant Jane (in a green bikini}
around bookshelves; he eventu
ally swung down on a rope to the
second floor to capture her.
Last Halloween a man in a
black trench coat "flashed" to
the Meyer crowds, revealing a
Bozo the Clown mask.
Other exhibitions have in
cluded mountain-climbing dis
plays, Christmas caroling, song
and dance routines, Ceneral Pat
ton impersonations and repro
ductions of the Ed Sullivan
Show. Frisbees and waste paper
also were often thrown about.
Last spring the Band and Dol
lies performed in Meyer Library,
and unprecedented action was
taken by the University through

the SJC against Hand Manager
Kent Blumberg and Drum Major
Jim Jett.
Blumberg and Jett are on prob
ation this quarter. Blumberg said
that the Band has "no plans" to
perform in the library in the fu
ture, nor does it intend to play
elsewhere without notifying the
authorities.
Some students found the
study breaks entertaining. "It
made it worth going to the lib
rary when I didn't feel like go
ing" said junior Barbara Barrow.
Furthermore, some students said
they thought it was easier to
study after the disruptions as
students were quiet for t he rest of
the night.

that the Band has "no plans" to
perform in the library in the fu
ture, nor does it intend to play
elsewhere without notifying the
authorities.
Some students found the
study breaks entertaining. "It
made it worth going to the lib
rary when I didn't feel like go
ing" said junior Barbara Barrow.
Furthermore, some students said
they thought it was easier to
study after the disruptions as
students were quiet for t he rest of
the night.
Meyer library will be a quieter
place to study this year because
of the Stanford Judicial Coun
cil's decision last spring, library
officials expect.
The SJC announced that "the
penalty for disruptive activities
might range from probation to a
suspension from the univer
sity," and most likely this will
deter any potential disruptors,
librarians indicated.
Meyer Chief Librarian
Elizabeth Salzer said that the lib
rary has not had any disruptions
yet. She explained that distur
bances occur "usually more into
the football season...and later in
the academic quarter. We are
hopeful that we will not have
any."
"Disturbances usually take
place for one of two reasons."
Salzer noted. "First, during mid
terms and finals: academic pres
sure. Second, during football

season and fraternity rush."
In the past, the Meyer Library
staff has relied on the assistance
of the police to quiet rowdy stu
dents, and it will continue to do
so. "The police are not always
called for every disruption,
though we evaluate the situation
and then determine (what action
to take)."
Students have come up with
an astonishing variety of antics
in Meyer Library over the years.
Three years ago, a fully clothed
female mannequin was flung
from the fourth floor balcony as a
girl screamed "I just can't take it
any longer." Later, a loin
clothed Tarzan chased a reluc

tant Jane (in a green bikini}
around bookshelves; he eventu
ally swung down on a rope to the
second floor to capture her.
Last Halloween a man in a
black trench coat "flashed" to
the Meyer crowds, revealing a
Bozo the Clown mask.
Other exhibitions have in
cluded mountain-climbing dis
plays, Christmas caroling, song
and dance routines, Ceneral Pat
ton impersonations and repro
ductions of the Ed Sullivan
Show. Frisbees and waste paper
also were often thrown about.
Last spring the Band and Dol
lies performed in Meyer Library,
and unprecedented action was
taken by the University through

the SJC against Hand Manager
Kent Blumberg and Drum Major
Jim Jett.
Blumberg and Jett are on prob
ation this quarter. Blumberg said
that the Band has "no plans" to
perform in the library in the fu
ture, nor does it intend to play
elsewhere without notifying the
authorities.
