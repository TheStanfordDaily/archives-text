I'm annoyed. As a bicyclist I know how troublesome it is to stop
at stop signs, but as a driver I'm both angry and alarmed at bicy
clists who peddle blithely through stop signs. I'm surprised that
more thoughtless bicyclists aren't injured by drivers who assume
that bicyclists will stop. Why don't the police enforce stop signs?
When will they start ticketing illegal bikers again?
M.F.
According to Sgt. Debbie Marinaro, public safety department,
the problem is twofold. First, there's the old problem of having too
few officers with too much to do.
With everybody returning to school and moving into the dorms,
Marinaro says the officers are extra busy. She says the beginning of
the year is always a peak period for thefts. "People leave their doors
open or don't lock up their bikes," says Marinaro. "So many of the
officers are tied up with extra paperwork," she adds.
Second, Marinaro says it's really hard to catch someone on a bike.
"You see someone running a stop sign, and then they split on you,"
she explains. "You can't exactly go busting through a crowd in a
car because someone's liable to get hurt."
Where do house/lies go in the winter? 1 mean, do they fly south,
or what?
D.E.
We talked to our local Lord of the Flies, Ward Watt, who specu
lates that houseflies are "short-lived beasts," with a low population
in the winter.
Wyatt says most houseflies probably get through the winter as
eggs. But fly-lovers (!) don't despair because, adds Watt, "you can
always find a few adult flies around in greasy spoons."
Most animals who don't like the cold brave the winter elements
by growing fur. However, "when you're V2 a centimeter long," says
VVatt. "that's a little impractical."
