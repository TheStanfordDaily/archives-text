(CPS) — "The First Amend

ure ominous signs that the val
ues it embraces may be in for
stormy weather."
-Hetired Justice William O.

The 19 campus newspapers in
California which have been told
to stop running editorials en
dorsing off-campus political

candidates and to start running
all advertising offered, know
which way the political wind is
blowing concerning their First
Amendment rights.
A Sept. 22 mandate delivered
to the papers by the California
State University and College
System Board of Trustees gives
the papers six months "to be
brought in line with the stipula
tions" outlined in the brief.

The decision apparently came
about because a member of the
board of trustees was "outraged
that certain campuses were pick
ing and choosing what ads they
would run," Alex Sherriff, vice
chancellor of academic affairs
for California State University,
said.
"They're telling us that an ad
vertisers' constitutional rights
take precedence over our First
Amendment rights to decide the
content and presentation of our
papers," Bob Speer, general
manager of the Wildcat student
paper in Chico, Calif., said.
"It's our editorial freedom to
endorse a political candidate cr
to not run an advertisement," he
said. The Wildcat has an edito
rial policy of not running adver
tisements from groups they dis
agree with politically. Those
groups include Callo, Safeway
stores, ROTC, Coors, Playboy
Magazine and "any other firms
that are racist or sexist in na
ture," he said.
"The reason the trustees don't
want us running editorials en
dorsing political candidates is
because they're afraid we might
offend some politician who has
some say about the system,"
Speer said.
He recalled an incident last
spring at Humboldt State Uni
versity in which the student
paper endorsed a slate of en
vironmentalists over a slate of
developers. Humboldt is located
in a small town with a large stu
dent population that could have
an effect on the elections.

The trustees maintain, how
ever, that since the student pap
ers receive student fees — which
are indirectly state monies —
that the papers are instruments
of the state. Sherriff acknow
ledged that the papers could run
editorials endorsing political
candidates "only if the editorials
are signed by an individual staff
member and it is made apparent
that the editorial reflects only
the opinion of that individual."
"If the paper wants to go inde
pendent, it can endorse
whomever it pleases," he said.
The board of trustees' 25-page
opinion bluntly acknowledges
that the legal right of a private
newspaper to refuse advertising
is "well-established."
Noticeably missing from the
trustees' opinion is a 1969 U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that
states, "It can hardly be argued
that either students or teachers
shed their constitutional rights
to freedom of speech or expres
sion at the schoolhouse gate."
(Tinker vs. Des Moines Indepen
dent Community School Dis
trict).
"We're ready to fight them as
far as we have to go," Speer said.
"This matter should be settled in
court since it demonstrates that
the relationship between the
student paper and the state — at
least how the trustees perceive it
— is basically untenable," he
said.
The American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) in San Francisco,
Calif., is currently investigating
the case.

(CPS) — "The First Amend
ment is a weathervane and there
ure ominous signs that the val
ues it embraces may be in for
stormy weather."

The 19 campus newspapers in
California which have been told
to stop running editorials en
dorsing off-campus political

candidates and to start running
all advertising offered, know
which way the political wind is
blowing concerning their First
Amendment rights.
A Sept. 22 mandate delivered
to the papers by the California
State University and College
System Board of Trustees gives
the papers six months "to be
brought in line with the stipula
tions" outlined in the brief.

The decision apparently came
about because a member of the
board of trustees was "outraged
that certain campuses were pick
ing and choosing what ads they
would run," Alex Sherriff, vice
chancellor of academic affairs
for California State University,
said.
"They're telling us that an ad
vertisers' constitutional rights
take precedence over our First
Amendment rights to decide the
content and presentation of our
papers," Bob Speer, general
manager of the Wildcat student
paper in Chico, Calif., said.
"It's our editorial freedom to
endorse a political candidate cr
to not run an advertisement," he
said. The Wildcat has an edito
rial policy of not running adver
tisements from groups they dis
agree with politically. Those
groups include Callo, Safeway
stores, ROTC, Coors, Playboy
Magazine and "any other firms
that are racist or sexist in na
ture," he said.
"The reason the trustees don't
want us running editorials en
dorsing political candidates is
because they're afraid we might
offend some politician who has
some say about the system,"
Speer said.
He recalled an incident last
spring at Humboldt State Uni
versity in which the student
paper endorsed a slate of en
vironmentalists over a slate of
developers. Humboldt is located
in a small town with a large stu
dent population that could have
an effect on the elections.

The trustees maintain, how
ever, that since the student pap
ers receive student fees — which
are indirectly state monies —
that the papers are instruments
of the state. Sherriff acknow
ledged that the papers could run
editorials endorsing political
candidates "only if the editorials
are signed by an individual staff
member and it is made apparent
that the editorial reflects only
the opinion of that individual."
"If the paper wants to go inde
pendent, it can endorse
whomever it pleases," he said.
The board of trustees' 25-page
opinion bluntly acknowledges
that the legal right of a private
newspaper to refuse advertising
is "well-established."
Noticeably missing from the
trustees' opinion is a 1969 U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that
states, "It can hardly be argued
that either students or teachers
shed their constitutional rights
to freedom of speech or expres
sion at the schoolhouse gate."
(Tinker vs. Des Moines Indepen
dent Community School Dis
trict).
"We're ready to fight them as
far as we have to go," Speer said.
"This matter should be settled in
court since it demonstrates that
the relationship between the
student paper and the state — at
least how the trustees perceive it
— is basically untenable," he
said.
The American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) in San Francisco,
Calif., is currently investigating
the case.
