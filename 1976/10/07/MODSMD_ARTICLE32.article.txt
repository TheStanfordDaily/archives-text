# Rich kids become 'the corporate elite'
## 
### 
(CPS) —Students planning to crawl their way to the top of corpo
rate America a la Horatio Alger would do better looking for another
plan of attack, according to a study by two Boston University
sociologists.
The two, Michael Useem and S.M. Miller, found that children of
the rich, no matter what their academic ability, continue to get
accepted into the nation's most elite schools and continue to re
main there until graduation at a rate far out of porportion to their
numbers. After graduation, the rich kids follow their fathers and
grandfathers and merge into the higher levels of some corporate
structure.
Students from the families in the richest 20 per cent of the nation
take up 64 per cent of the available space at the nations' elite
schools, the pair discovered. Students from the bottom 20 per cent
took up only two per cent of the space.
I wenty to 39 per cent of what the two called "the corporate elite"
went to either Harvard, Princeton or Yale, their study showed, with
the majority of all the elite going to one of 12 top U.S. schools.
Useem and Miller found that once in a school, the grades or awards
a rich kid obtains have little relationship to their future earnings.
Rare executives who make it to the top from modest backgrounds
appear to do so not because of their education but despite their lack
of an appropriate education, they say.
Ihe study's results were published in Human Behavior
magazine.
