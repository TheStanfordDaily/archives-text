# Theater: boonies to big time

When You Comin' Back, Red
Ryder?, a play written by Stan
ford graduate Mark Medoff,
premiered off-Broadway in the
fall of 1973 and went on to win
an Obie Award for Distin
guished Playwriting. Last sum
mer it appeared at the Eureka
Theatre, the basement of an old
church at 16th and Market Sts. in
San Francisco, where it received
critical acclaim and played to
sold-out houses.
Now the local group has shed
its amateur standing and an
tiquated facilities and moved to
a full scale, downtown, Equity
production (which means the
company now gets paid for its

work) at the Little Fox theatre. It
is seen as a very important event
for the San Francisco theatrical
community.
"1 think the move has a great
deal of significance," said the
show's producer, Matthew Loc
ricchio, who also stars as the
main character. "It shows that
things are changing. We (theater
in San Francisco) have been an
offshoot of LA in the past and
that's not true any more; we're
trying to break the tradition that
San Francisco is a lousy theatri
cal town."
The rules governing an actor's
employment when she or he is a
member of the actors' union,
Equity, are complex, but eventu

ally Locricchio and Equity com
promised and the Eureka group
was allowed to turn professional
instead of having to replace the
old cast with actors who were
already in the union.
"We've set a precedent," Loc
ricchio said. "It should inspire
other amateur groups in the
area."
Once the Equity problem was
solved, Locricchio needed
$25,000 to finance the move to
the Little Fox. His brother Joseph
originally intended to supply
the funds, but then roi:k impre
sario Hill Graham saw Hud
Ryder and was so impressed he
wanted to help. Graham and
Joseph could not come to an ag

reement, however, and Matthew
did not want to deal with two
executive producers, so Joseph
ended up as the sole financier.
"Joseph's what you call an
angel," Matthew said. "He puts
up the money and lets me take
care of the details."
Angel's money
Locricchio has found no diffi
culty in being both the show's
producer and lead actor, he said.
"I've come from a pretty strong
background of 10 weeks of doing
the show and three months of
rehearsals. I'm able to divorce
my production responsibilities
from my acting responsibilities
completely."
Director Robert Woodruff said
he has had little problem direct
ing his producer. "We've had es
sentially no conflicts at all be
cause we respect each other's ta
lents," he said. Locricchio ag
reed with Woodruff: "1 have an
incredible rapport with Woody
and I have the utmost confidence
in his ability."
The previews are over, the
show has opened and most of the
difficulties are over, according
to Woodruff. The critics still like
Red Ryder, and Locricchio and
Woodruff see no more major ob
stacles. They agree that it will
take a six- to eight-month run for
Joseph Locricchio to make his
money back, but they foresee a
stay at least that long. "I'll stick
my neck out and say we'll be
here a year," Locricchio said.

take a six- to eight-month run for
Joseph Locricchio to make his

When You Comin' Back, Red
Ryder?, a play written by Stan
ford graduate Mark Medoff,
premiered off-Broadway in the
fall of 1973 and went on to win
an Obie Award for Distin
guished Playwriting. Last sum
mer it appeared at the Eureka
Theatre, the basement of an old
church at 16th and Market Sts. in
San Francisco, where it received
critical acclaim and played to
sold-out houses.
Now the local group has shed
its amateur standing and an
tiquated facilities and moved to
a full scale, downtown, Equity
production (which means the
company now gets paid for its

work) at the Little Fox theatre. It
is seen as a very important event
for the San Francisco theatrical
community.
"1 think the move has a great
deal of significance," said the
show's producer, Matthew Loc
ricchio, who also stars as the
main character. "It shows that
things are changing. We (theater
in San Francisco) have been an
offshoot of LA in the past and
that's not true any more; we're
trying to break the tradition that
San Francisco is a lousy theatri
cal town."
The rules governing an actor's
employment when she or he is a
member of the actors' union,
Equity, are complex, but eventu

ally Locricchio and Equity com
promised and the Eureka group
was allowed to turn professional
instead of having to replace the
old cast with actors who were
already in the union.
"We've set a precedent," Loc
ricchio said. "It should inspire
other amateur groups in the
area."
Once the Equity problem was
solved, Locricchio needed
$25,000 to finance the move to
the Little Fox. His brother Joseph
originally intended to supply
the funds, but then roi:k impre
sario Hill Graham saw Hud
Ryder and was so impressed he
wanted to help. Graham and
