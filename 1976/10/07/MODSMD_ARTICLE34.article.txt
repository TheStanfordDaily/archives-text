# 'Red Ryder': tense comedy
## 
### 
When you see Mark Medoff's
When 7ou Comin' Back, Red
Ryder?, now playing at the Little
Fox theatre, try not to laugh too
much — it won't be real laugh
ter. You'll be laughing because
you're nervous and afraid and
trying to reduce the tension, not
because the characters or the
situation are funny.
Medoff uses the premise of a
psychotic Vietnam veteran ter
rorizing the patrons of a small
diner in the desert of New
Mexico to discuss America's loss
of honorable, pure and esteemed
heroes, the ever-present violence
in our society and the different
sexual and moral inhibitions
and hang-ups we all have.
And when Teddy, the crazed
vet, unleashes one of his caustic
but witty attacks, don't laugh.
His stripping away of the pat

rons' protective layers — re
sembling the work of a precise,
demonic surgeon — frightens;
the anxious laughter is only an
attempt to keep the action on the
stage at a safe distance.
Intriguing
Medoff, while presenting
stimulating ideas, also presents
an intriguing, if sometimes im
plausible story. (1 kept wonder
ing why the victims didn't run
out of the diner and take off for
the relative safety of the desert. I
would have, I told myself.)
The play begins as the diner's
night worker, the town tough
guy, waits for his replacement
early Sunday morning. The
day-shift worker arrives, a
plump, good-natured girl. Soon
two travelers and the friendly
cripple who runs the motel and
gas station next door stop in for
breakfast.
And then Teddy and his
female companion enter, look
ing for the gas station owner so
that they can get a new generator
to fix their broken-down, drug
laden van. The gas station owner
goes to assist them, discovers the
drugs, and the situation esca
lates into a very frightening
ordeal.
Taut and suspenseful
Director Robert Woodruff
gives us an extremely taut, sus
penseful show that also slows
down enough to let Teddy and
his terror do more than just
thrill. Woodruff handles the
changes in rhythm and pace ex
pertly and almost manages to
hide the few holes and weak

spots in the script.
One such hole is Teddy's
motivation, which Medoff never
explains well enough for me. At
the end of the show 1 still didn't
know why Teddy had sadisti
cally played with these people,
even if.the playing was ex
tremely gripping. (I have a few
ideas why, but 1 can't be sure.)
Matthew Locricchio, who is
also producing fled Ryder,plays
Teddy. He beautifully conveyed
the fluctuations of the disturbed,
yet well-educated and articulate
veteran who longs for the simple
days of the comic book hero Red
Ryder and baseball star Duke
Snyder. Locricchio goes far
beyond the script in creating his
Teddy.
Sleazy set
Locricchio portrays the main
character, but he is not the
"star." The entire cast — Kent
Hall as Stephen, the graveyard
shift worker; Diana (Jennie)
Ayers as Angel, the day shift
worker; Jim Haynie as the gas
station owner; Wes Finley as the
owner of the diner; Alma Becker
and Dierk Toporzysek as the
travelers; and Alia Nedoresow as
Teddy's companion — joins
Locricchio in venturing outside
the script to create believable,
solid characters.
In the end, it's the fine ensem
ble acting, combined with
Woodruff's superb direction and
Michael Kroschel's approp
riately sleazy set that make fled
Ryder an outstanding show. See
it.

psychotic Vietnam veteran ter
rorizing the patrons of a small
diner in the desert of New
Mexico to discuss America's loss
of honorable, pure and esteemed
heroes, the ever-present violence
in our society and the different
sexual and moral inhibitions
and hang-ups we all have.
And when Teddy, the crazed
vet, unleashes one of his caustic
but witty attacks, don't laugh.
His stripping away of the pat

rons' protective layers — re
sembling the work of a precise,
demonic surgeon — frightens;
the anxious laughter is only an
attempt to keep the action on the
stage at a safe distance.
Intriguing
Medoff, while presenting
stimulating ideas, also presents
an intriguing, if sometimes im
plausible story. (1 kept wonder
ing why the victims didn't run
out of the diner and take off for
the relative safety of the desert. I
would have, I told myself.)
The play begins as the diner's
night worker, the town tough
guy, waits for his replacement
early Sunday morning. The
day-shift worker arrives, a
plump, good-natured girl. Soon
two travelers and the friendly
cripple who runs the motel and
gas station next door stop in for
breakfast.
And then Teddy and his
female companion enter, look
ing for the gas station owner so
that they can get a new generator
to fix their broken-down, drug
laden van. The gas station owner
goes to assist them, discovers the
drugs, and the situation esca
lates into a very frightening
ordeal.
Taut and suspenseful
Director Robert Woodruff
gives us an extremely taut, sus
penseful show that also slows
down enough to let Teddy and
his terror do more than just
thrill. Woodruff handles the
changes in rhythm and pace ex
pertly and almost manages to
hide the few holes and weak

spots in the script.
One such hole is Teddy's
motivation, which Medoff never
explains well enough for me. At
the end of the show 1 still didn't
know why Teddy had sadisti
cally played with these people,
even if.the playing was ex
tremely gripping. (I have a few
ideas why, but 1 can't be sure.)
Matthew Locricchio, who is
also producing fled Ryder,plays
Teddy. He beautifully conveyed
the fluctuations of the disturbed,
yet well-educated and articulate
veteran who longs for the simple
days of the comic book hero Red
Ryder and baseball star Duke
Snyder. Locricchio goes far
beyond the script in creating his
Teddy.
Sleazy set
Locricchio portrays the main
character, but he is not the
"star." The entire cast — Kent
Hall as Stephen, the graveyard
shift worker; Diana (Jennie)
Ayers as Angel, the day shift
worker; Jim Haynie as the gas
station owner; Wes Finley as the
owner of the diner; Alma Becker
and Dierk Toporzysek as the
travelers; and Alia Nedoresow as
Teddy's companion — joins
Locricchio in venturing outside
the script to create believable,
solid characters.
In the end, it's the fine ensem
ble acting, combined with
Woodruff's superb direction and
Michael Kroschel's approp
riately sleazy set that make fled
Ryder an outstanding show. See
it.
