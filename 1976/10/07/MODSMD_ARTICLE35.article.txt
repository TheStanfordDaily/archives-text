# Shakespeare mania in Ashland
## Superb theatre at Oregon Festival 
### Perry Simon 
This summer, like every
summer, William Shakespeare
nearly incited a mdssriot in Ash
land, Oregon. His battle-cry this
year was Comedy of Errors, and
as usual, the box office stalwarts
had to battle back ticket-craving
lunatics threatening to tear
down the walls of the Angus
Bowmer Theatre.
Hut the blame should not rest
on Shakespeare. The real cul
prits are that tribe of trouble
making Renaissance fanatics
known as the Oregon Shakes
peare Festival Association.
Every year they resurrect the
Master and his works in all their
glory, and we, the audience and
would-be audience, are but
pawns in their macabre machi
nations.
Not only do the productions
treat us to merciless doses of ex
quisite theatre, but the town it
self is so warm and picturesque
that we cannot help but forget all
the cares and worries of the
everyday world we left at home.
With all the seductive cunning
of Lady Macbeth, the OS FA
entices us to beg, borrow or steal
tickets to its productions and
then carouse the town in our free

time, losing ourselves in the an
ticipation of more plays and
more carousing.
Ay, there's the rub! For when
the curtain falls on that sixth
play, the OSFA casts us back
into the cold, cruel 20th century.
We are expelled from Ashland
and forced to wait six months
until we can return for the
STAGE ll Spring Festival. As if
this expulsion is not punish
ment enough, Fate adds her
sadistic touch by making us
leave Oregon and return to
California, where discarded
aluminum can flip-tops shred
our bare feet.
Star attraction
This season's most devious
siren was The Comedy of Errors,
directed by a young festival
actor named Will Huddleston.
This production, staged in the
indoor theatre, sparkled with
creativity, witty humor and
boundless energy.
The play was set in a circus
midway, using characters and
themes drawn from circus
carnivals. The festival players
were given a golden opportunity
to ham and clown. They per
formed with great maturity, mix
ing subtle and slapstick humor

while managing to avoid exces
ses and, above all, maintain the
rapid pace. Much of this is owed
to the ingenious direction of
Huddleston, who orchestrated
this madcap production with
precision and flair.
While Comedy of Errors had
ticket hunters brandishing
knives, the season's other plays
merely prompted adults to beat
up little children and steal their
tickets to gain admission. As a
striking contrast to Comedy of
Errors, the Festival's production
of Lillian Hellman's The Little
Foxes offered the most absorbing
dramatic fare. The cast of princi
pals was superb â€” probably the
most effective ensemble assem
bled this season. Director James
Moll made the most of his cast's
talents and Hellman's powerful
text, bringing the drama to such
tense denouements that the au
dience was thoroughly drained
by the end of the play.
Poignant King
There was little relief from the
dramatic tension that night
when Denis Arndt took to the
stage in the outdoor Elizabethan
theatre to offer a poignant bul
inconsistent portrayal of King
Lear. The supporting cast all but

overshawdowed Arndt in this
production, and it was responsi
ble for the ultimate success of
this play.
Director Pat Patton's staging
did justice to Shakespeare's im
mortal text, reducing the fun
damental conflicts to their most
basic form for clarity and power.
For any of you who may be
wondering, Lear's daughters are
still giving him trouble.
The most entertaining offering
this season, and the greatest
crowd pleaser, was George Ber
nard Shaw's The Devil's Disci
ple. The large cast was the best
balanced of all the Festival pro
ductions, and the direction was
impeccable.
Guest director
Director Michael Liebert, who
is the founder and producing
director of the Berkeley Reper
tory Theatre, managed to play up
the comic elements in the play
while still carefully developing
the more serious social commen
tary intended by Shaw. His
blocking elucidated the play's
thematic progress all the way
through the curtain call. In the
title role, Barry Mulholland was
dashing and debonair, yet he
demonstrated the sincerity and

tenderness also required by this
difficult role.
As for Mulholland's portrayal
of Antipholus of Syracuse in
Comedy of Errors, his perfor
mance was difficult to evaluate
since he was constantly being
confused with his twin brother
Brian Mulholland, who played
Antipholus of Ephesus. In any
case, they made a nice package.
This year's history play, Henry
VI, Port 11, is among the most
stage-worthy of Shakespeare's
texts. Though it is a weak piece
of literature, this emotional,
action-packed play seems to
jump off the stage into the audi
ence, and it was directed with
maximum effectiveness by the
Festival's producing director,
Jerry Turner. In the title role,
John Warren Tyson gave a sym
pathetic and very believable por
trayal of the confused and naive
young King.
Henry VI, Part II serves as a
lesson to all of us not to discount
each season's history play as an
admirable scholarly endeavor by
the festival. These plays are
often among the most moving
and educational productions
the season, even for audience
members unseasoned in

Shakespeare.
Unfortunately, the festival
was weakened by an uninspired
production of Much Ado About
Nothing. This frequently per
formed comedy is among
Shakespeare's finest, but Ash
land's production lacked
energy, the cast did not gel, and
Jim Edmondson's direction was
generally slow and unimagina
tive.
The festival company's new
theatre ensemble, called the
Black Swan Theatre, periodi
cally staged performances of
lesser-known works. These pro
ductions were as much for the
satisfaction of the festival ac
tors as they were designed for
festival visitors.
Black Swan gives Ashland
players an opportunity to take a
break from their rigorous
schedule and work together to
develop their theatrical skills.
This third stage also offers the
Oregon visitor a rare chance to
see "works-in-progress" per
formed with unusual energy and
imagination by some of the ris
ing stars of contemporary
theatre.
A midnight performance of
the Ancient Greek drama Medea,
with Sands Hall in the title role,
exemplified the innovative
character of Black Swan produc
tions. Though it lacked the
polish of the regular season's
plays, the players were clearly
inspired by the potential for ex
perimentation. The majority of
the audience was made up of
other festival actors, thus creat
ing a unique sense of solidarity
between actor and audience.
New dimension
Now in its first year, this dedi
cated ensemble is likely to add
another valuable dimension to
the Ashland Festival as Black
Swan matures and refines itself.
As usual, there were a couple
of players who highlighted this

season's acting company. This
year's leading pair were Denis
Arndt and Christine Healy. De
spite Arndt's weaknesses as
Lear, both were exceptional in
all their performances. The col
lision between Arndt and Healy
as Ben and Regina Hubbard in
Little Foxes was taut dramatic
dynamite, both these individu
als appear destined for great
success as professionals.
Kudos also go to Ron Woods
for an exquisite portrayal of
Edgar in Leiir, and Joseph I)e
Salvio for his exceptional per
formances in the diverse roles of
Anthony Anderson (Devil's Dis
ciple). Dromio of Syracuse
(Comedy of Errors), and the Earl
of Salisbury (Henry V/).
But once again, the success of
Shakespeare '76 was a joint ef
fort, and the cooperative spirit of
the company showed
everywhere from the crowd
scenes of Henry VI to the pool
games at Capp's Tavern. The
lectures in Lithia Park, the Re
naissance music and dancing on
the green preceding each show,
the quaint shops and friendly
townsfolk, all remained full of
vitality even as late into the sea
son as September.
The Festival STAGE II Spring
season will run for eight weeks
from February 11 through April
9, 1977. This season's offerings
are Shakespeare's Measure for
Measure, Angel Street by Patrick
Hamilton, and Sheridan's The
Rivals. While these plays rotate
in the Indoor Theatre, Black
Swan will present Shelagh De
laney's A Taste of Honey every
Sunday night.
And if you think the Rogue
River offers beautiful swimming
in the summer, you should try
the skiing offered on Mt. Ash
land during the winter. Yet
another cunning ploy by those
devilish tricksters at the Oregon
Shakespeare Festival.


Multi-faced thespian
Denis Arndt, a three-year veteran of the OSFA, is
pictured above in the three roles he portrayed last sum
mer. At left, Arndt plays the despondent, half-crazed King
Lear desperately clutching his Fool as he is comforted by
the Earl of Kent. At center, Arndt is General John Bur-

goyne disciplining his British Redcoat subordinate in
The Devil's Disciple. At right, Arndt portrays the cunning
Ben Hubbard interogating his nephew Leo as brother
Oscar looks on in The Little Foxes. Arndt is also the
director of the Festival Company's Black Swan Theatre.

mortal text, reducing the fun
damental conflicts to their most
basic form for clarity and power.
For any of you who may be
wondering, Lear's daughters are
still giving him trouble.
The most entertaining offering
this season, and the greatest
crowd pleaser, was George Ber
nard Shaw's The Devil's Disci
ple. The large cast was the best
balanced of all the Festival pro
ductions, and the direction was
impeccable.
Guest director
Director Michael Liebert, who
is the founder and producing
director of the Berkeley Reper
tory Theatre, managed to play up
the comic elements in the play
while still carefully developing
the more serious social commen
tary intended by Shaw. His
blocking elucidated the play's
thematic progress all the way
through the curtain call. In the
title role, Barry Mulholland was
dashing and debonair, yet he
demonstrated the sincerity and

tenderness also required by this
difficult role.
As for Mulholland's portrayal
of Antipholus of Syracuse in
Comedy of Errors, his perfor
mance was difficult to evaluate
since he was constantly being
confused with his twin brother
Brian Mulholland, who played
Antipholus of Ephesus. In any
case, they made a nice package.
This year's history play, Henry
VI, Port 11, is among the most
stage-worthy of Shakespeare's
texts. Though it is a weak piece
of literature, this emotional,
action-packed play seems to
jump off the stage into the audi
ence, and it was directed with
maximum effectiveness by the
Festival's producing director,
Jerry Turner. In the title role,
John Warren Tyson gave a sym
pathetic and very believable por
trayal of the confused and naive
young King.
Henry VI, Part II serves as a
lesson to all of us not to discount
each season's history play as an
admirable scholarly endeavor by
the festival. These plays are
often among the most moving
and educational productions
the season, even for audience
members unseasoned in

Shakespeare.
Unfortunately, the festival
was weakened by an uninspired
production of Much Ado About
Nothing. This frequently per
formed comedy is among
Shakespeare's finest, but Ash
land's production lacked
energy, the cast did not gel, and
Jim Edmondson's direction was
generally slow and unimagina
tive.
The festival company's new
theatre ensemble, called the
Black Swan Theatre, periodi
cally staged performances of
lesser-known works. These pro
ductions were as much for the
satisfaction of the festival ac
tors as they were designed for
festival visitors.
Black Swan gives Ashland
players an opportunity to take a
break from their rigorous
schedule and work together to
develop their theatrical skills.
This third stage also offers the
Oregon visitor a rare chance to
see "works-in-progress" per
formed with unusual energy and
imagination by some of the ris
ing stars of contemporary
theatre.
A midnight performance of
the Ancient Greek drama Medea,
with Sands Hall in the title role,
exemplified the innovative
character of Black Swan produc
tions. Though it lacked the
polish of the regular season's
plays, the players were clearly
inspired by the potential for ex
perimentation. The majority of
the audience was made up of
other festival actors, thus creat
ing a unique sense of solidarity
between actor and audience.
New dimension
Now in its first year, this dedi
cated ensemble is likely to add
another valuable dimension to
the Ashland Festival as Black
Swan matures and refines itself.
As usual, there were a couple
of players who highlighted this

season's acting company. This
year's leading pair were Denis
Arndt and Christine Healy. De
spite Arndt's weaknesses as
Lear, both were exceptional in
all their performances. The col
lision between Arndt and Healy
as Ben and Regina Hubbard in
Little Foxes was taut dramatic
dynamite, both these individu
als appear destined for great
success as professionals.
Kudos also go to Ron Woods
for an exquisite portrayal of
Edgar in Leiir, and Joseph I)e
Salvio for his exceptional per
formances in the diverse roles of
Anthony Anderson (Devil's Dis
ciple). Dromio of Syracuse
(Comedy of Errors), and the Earl
of Salisbury (Henry V/).
But once again, the success of
Shakespeare '76 was a joint ef
fort, and the cooperative spirit of
the company showed
everywhere from the crowd
scenes of Henry VI to the pool
games at Capp's Tavern. The
lectures in Lithia Park, the Re
naissance music and dancing on
the green preceding each show,
the quaint shops and friendly
townsfolk, all remained full of
vitality even as late into the sea
son as September.
The Festival STAGE II Spring
season will run for eight weeks
from February 11 through April
9, 1977. This season's offerings
are Shakespeare's Measure for
Measure, Angel Street by Patrick
Hamilton, and Sheridan's The
Rivals. While these plays rotate
in the Indoor Theatre, Black
Swan will present Shelagh De
laney's A Taste of Honey every
Sunday night.
And if you think the Rogue
River offers beautiful swimming
in the summer, you should try
the skiing offered on Mt. Ash
land during the winter. Yet
another cunning ploy by those
devilish tricksters at the Oregon
Shakespeare Festival.


Multi-faced thespian
Denis Arndt, a three-year veteran of the OSFA, is
pictured above in the three roles he portrayed last sum
mer. At left, Arndt plays the despondent, half-crazed King
Lear desperately clutching his Fool as he is comforted by
the Earl of Kent. At center, Arndt is General John Bur-

goyne disciplining his British Redcoat subordinate in
The Devil's Disciple. At right, Arndt portrays the cunning
Ben Hubbard interogating his nephew Leo as brother
Oscar looks on in The Little Foxes. Arndt is also the
director of the Festival Company's Black Swan Theatre.
This summer, like every
summer, William Shakespeare
nearly incited a mdssriot in Ash
land, Oregon. His battle-cry this
year was Comedy of Errors, and
as usual, the box office stalwarts
had to battle back ticket-craving
lunatics threatening to tear
down the walls of the Angus
Bowmer Theatre.
Hut the blame should not rest
on Shakespeare. The real cul
prits are that tribe of trouble
making Renaissance fanatics
known as the Oregon Shakes
peare Festival Association.
Every year they resurrect the
Master and his works in all their
glory, and we, the audience and
would-be audience, are but
pawns in their macabre machi
nations.
Not only do the productions
treat us to merciless doses of ex
quisite theatre, but the town it
self is so warm and picturesque
that we cannot help but forget all
the cares and worries of the
everyday world we left at home.
With all the seductive cunning
of Lady Macbeth, the OS FA
entices us to beg, borrow or steal
tickets to its productions and
then carouse the town in our free

time, losing ourselves in the an
ticipation of more plays and
more carousing.
Ay, there's the rub! For when
the curtain falls on that sixth
play, the OSFA casts us back
into the cold, cruel 20th century.
We are expelled from Ashland
and forced to wait six months
until we can return for the
STAGE ll Spring Festival. As if
this expulsion is not punish
ment enough, Fate adds her
sadistic touch by making us
leave Oregon and return to
California, where discarded
aluminum can flip-tops shred
our bare feet.
Star attraction
This season's most devious
siren was The Comedy of Errors,
directed by a young festival
actor named Will Huddleston.
This production, staged in the
indoor theatre, sparkled with
creativity, witty humor and
boundless energy.
The play was set in a circus
midway, using characters and
themes drawn from circus
carnivals. The festival players
were given a golden opportunity
to ham and clown. They per
formed with great maturity, mix
ing subtle and slapstick humor

while managing to avoid exces
ses and, above all, maintain the
rapid pace. Much of this is owed
to the ingenious direction of
Huddleston, who orchestrated
this madcap production with
precision and flair.
While Comedy of Errors had
ticket hunters brandishing
knives, the season's other plays
merely prompted adults to beat
up little children and steal their
tickets to gain admission. As a
striking contrast to Comedy of
Errors, the Festival's production
of Lillian Hellman's The Little
Foxes offered the most absorbing
dramatic fare. The cast of princi
pals was superb â€” probably the
most effective ensemble assem
bled this season. Director James
Moll made the most of his cast's
talents and Hellman's powerful
text, bringing the drama to such
tense denouements that the au
dience was thoroughly drained
by the end of the play.
Poignant King
There was little relief from the
dramatic tension that night
when Denis Arndt took to the
stage in the outdoor Elizabethan
theatre to offer a poignant bul
inconsistent portrayal of King
Lear. The supporting cast all but

overshawdowed Arndt in this
production, and it was responsi
ble for the ultimate success of
this play.
Director Pat Patton's staging

another valuable dimension to
the Ashland Festival as Black
Swan matures and refines itself.
As usual, there were a couple
of players who highlighted this

season's acting company. This
year's leading pair were Denis
Arndt and Christine Healy. De
spite Arndt's weaknesses as
Lear, both were exceptional in
all their performances. The col
lision between Arndt and Healy
as Ben and Regina Hubbard in
Little Foxes was taut dramatic
dynamite, both these individu
als appear destined for great
success as professionals.
Kudos also go to Ron Woods
for an exquisite portrayal of
Edgar in Leiir, and Joseph I)e
Salvio for his exceptional per
formances in the diverse roles of
Anthony Anderson (Devil's Dis
ciple). Dromio of Syracuse
(Comedy of Errors), and the Earl
of Salisbury (Henry V/).
But once again, the success of
Shakespeare '76 was a joint ef
fort, and the cooperative spirit of
the company showed
everywhere from the crowd
scenes of Henry VI to the pool
games at Capp's Tavern. The
lectures in Lithia Park, the Re
naissance music and dancing on
the green preceding each show,
the quaint shops and friendly
townsfolk, all remained full of
vitality even as late into the sea
son as September.
The Festival STAGE II Spring
season will run for eight weeks
from February 11 through April
9, 1977. This season's offerings
are Shakespeare's Measure for
Measure, Angel Street by Patrick
Hamilton, and Sheridan's The
Rivals. While these plays rotate
in the Indoor Theatre, Black
Swan will present Shelagh De
laney's A Taste of Honey every
Sunday night.
And if you think the Rogue
River offers beautiful swimming
in the summer, you should try
the skiing offered on Mt. Ash
land during the winter. Yet
another cunning ploy by those
devilish tricksters at the Oregon
Shakespeare Festival.


Multi-faced thespian
Denis Arndt, a three-year veteran of the OSFA, is
pictured above in the three roles he portrayed last sum
mer. At left, Arndt plays the despondent, half-crazed King
Lear desperately clutching his Fool as he is comforted by
the Earl of Kent. At center, Arndt is General John Bur-

goyne disciplining his British Redcoat subordinate in
The Devil's Disciple. At right, Arndt portrays the cunning
Ben Hubbard interogating his nephew Leo as brother
Oscar looks on in The Little Foxes. Arndt is also the
director of the Festival Company's Black Swan Theatre.
This summer, like every
summer, William Shakespeare
nearly incited a mdssriot in Ash
land, Oregon. His battle-cry this
year was Comedy of Errors, and
as usual, the box office stalwarts
had to battle back ticket-craving
lunatics threatening to tear
down the walls of the Angus
Bowmer Theatre.
Hut the blame should not rest
on Shakespeare. The real cul
prits are that tribe of trouble
making Renaissance fanatics
known as the Oregon Shakes
peare Festival Association.
Every year they resurrect the
Master and his works in all their
glory, and we, the audience and
would-be audience, are but
pawns in their macabre machi
nations.
Not only do the productions
treat us to merciless doses of ex
quisite theatre, but the town it
self is so warm and picturesque
that we cannot help but forget all
the cares and worries of the
everyday world we left at home.
With all the seductive cunning
of Lady Macbeth, the OS FA
entices us to beg, borrow or steal
tickets to its productions and
then carouse the town in our free

time, losing ourselves in the an
ticipation of more plays and
more carousing.
Ay, there's the rub! For when
the curtain falls on that sixth
play, the OSFA casts us back
into the cold, cruel 20th century.
We are expelled from Ashland
and forced to wait six months
until we can return for the
STAGE ll Spring Festival. As if
this expulsion is not punish
ment enough, Fate adds her
sadistic touch by making us
leave Oregon and return to
California, where discarded
aluminum can flip-tops shred
our bare feet.
Star attraction
This season's most devious
siren was The Comedy of Errors,
directed by a young festival
actor named Will Huddleston.
This production, staged in the
indoor theatre, sparkled with
creativity, witty humor and
boundless energy.
The play was set in a circus
midway, using characters and
themes drawn from circus
carnivals. The festival players
were given a golden opportunity
to ham and clown. They per
formed with great maturity, mix
ing subtle and slapstick humor

while managing to avoid exces
ses and, above all, maintain the
rapid pace. Much of this is owed
to the ingenious direction of
Huddleston, who orchestrated
this madcap production with
precision and flair.
While Comedy of Errors had
ticket hunters brandishing
knives, the season's other plays
merely prompted adults to beat
up little children and steal their
tickets to gain admission. As a
striking contrast to Comedy of
Errors, the Festival's production
of Lillian Hellman's The Little
Foxes offered the most absorbing
dramatic fare. The cast of princi
pals was superb â€” probably the
most effective ensemble assem
bled this season. Director James
Moll made the most of his cast's
talents and Hellman's powerful
text, bringing the drama to such
tense denouements that the au
dience was thoroughly drained
by the end of the play.
Poignant King
There was little relief from the
dramatic tension that night
when Denis Arndt took to the
stage in the outdoor Elizabethan
theatre to offer a poignant bul
inconsistent portrayal of King
Lear. The supporting cast all but

overshawdowed Arndt in this
production, and it was responsi
ble for the ultimate success of
this play.
Director Pat Patton's staging
did justice to Shakespeare's im
mortal text, reducing the fun
damental conflicts to their most
basic form for clarity and power.
For any of you who may be
wondering, Lear's daughters are
still giving him trouble.
The most entertaining offering
this season, and the greatest
crowd pleaser, was George Ber
nard Shaw's The Devil's Disci
ple. The large cast was the best
balanced of all the Festival pro
ductions, and the direction was
impeccable.
Guest director
Director Michael Liebert, who
is the founder and producing
director of the Berkeley Reper
tory Theatre, managed to play up
the comic elements in the play
while still carefully developing
the more serious social commen
tary intended by Shaw. His
blocking elucidated the play's
thematic progress all the way
through the curtain call. In the
title role, Barry Mulholland was
dashing and debonair, yet he
demonstrated the sincerity and

tenderness also required by this
difficult role.
As for Mulholland's portrayal
of Antipholus of Syracuse in
Comedy of Errors, his perfor
mance was difficult to evaluate
since he was constantly being
confused with his twin brother
Brian Mulholland, who played
Antipholus of Ephesus. In any
case, they made a nice package.
This year's history play, Henry
VI, Port 11, is among the most
stage-worthy of Shakespeare's
texts. Though it is a weak piece
of literature, this emotional,
action-packed play seems to
jump off the stage into the audi
ence, and it was directed with
maximum effectiveness by the
Festival's producing director,
Jerry Turner. In the title role,
John Warren Tyson gave a sym
pathetic and very believable por
trayal of the confused and naive
young King.
Henry VI, Part II serves as a
lesson to all of us not to discount
each season's history play as an
admirable scholarly endeavor by
the festival. These plays are
often among the most moving
and educational productions
the season, even for audience
members unseasoned in

Shakespeare.
Unfortunately, the festival
was weakened by an uninspired
production of Much Ado About
Nothing. This frequently per
formed comedy is among
Shakespeare's finest, but Ash
land's production lacked
energy, the cast did not gel, and
Jim Edmondson's direction was
generally slow and unimagina
tive.
The festival company's new
theatre ensemble, called the
Black Swan Theatre, periodi
cally staged performances of
lesser-known works. These pro
ductions were as much for the
satisfaction of the festival ac
tors as they were designed for
festival visitors.
Black Swan gives Ashland
players an opportunity to take a
break from their rigorous
schedule and work together to
develop their theatrical skills.
This third stage also offers the
Oregon visitor a rare chance to
see "works-in-progress" per
formed with unusual energy and
imagination by some of the ris
ing stars of contemporary
theatre.
A midnight performance of
the Ancient Greek drama Medea,
with Sands Hall in the title role,
exemplified the innovative
character of Black Swan produc
tions. Though it lacked the
polish of the regular season's
plays, the players were clearly
inspired by the potential for ex
perimentation. The majority of
the audience was made up of
other festival actors, thus creat
ing a unique sense of solidarity
between actor and audience.

With all the seductive cunning
of Lady Macbeth, the OS FA
entices us to beg, borrow or steal
tickets to its productions and
then carouse the town in our free

time, losing ourselves in the an
ticipation of more plays and
more carousing.
Ay, there's the rub! For when
the curtain falls on that sixth
play, the OSFA casts us back
into the cold, cruel 20th century.
We are expelled from Ashland
and forced to wait six months
until we can return for the
STAGE ll Spring Festival. As if
this expulsion is not punish
ment enough, Fate adds her
sadistic touch by making us
leave Oregon and return to
California, where discarded
aluminum can flip-tops shred
our bare feet.
Star attraction
This season's most devious
siren was The Comedy of Errors,
directed by a young festival
actor named Will Huddleston.
This production, staged in the
indoor theatre, sparkled with
creativity, witty humor and
boundless energy.
The play was set in a circus
midway, using characters and
themes drawn from circus
carnivals. The festival players
were given a golden opportunity
to ham and clown. They per
formed with great maturity, mix
ing subtle and slapstick humor

while managing to avoid exces
ses and, above all, maintain the
rapid pace. Much of this is owed
to the ingenious direction of
Huddleston, who orchestrated
this madcap production with
precision and flair.
While Comedy of Errors had
ticket hunters brandishing
knives, the season's other plays
merely prompted adults to beat
up little children and steal their
tickets to gain admission. As a
striking contrast to Comedy of
Errors, the Festival's production
of Lillian Hellman's The Little
Foxes offered the most absorbing
dramatic fare. The cast of princi
pals was superb â€” probably the
most effective ensemble assem
bled this season. Director James
Moll made the most of his cast's
talents and Hellman's powerful
text, bringing the drama to such
tense denouements that the au
dience was thoroughly drained
by the end of the play.
Poignant King
There was little relief from the
dramatic tension that night
when Denis Arndt took to the
stage in the outdoor Elizabethan
theatre to offer a poignant bul
inconsistent portrayal of King
Lear. The supporting cast all but

overshawdowed Arndt in this
production, and it was responsi
ble for the ultimate success of
this play.
Director Pat Patton's staging
did justice to Shakespeare's im
mortal text, reducing the fun
damental conflicts to their most
basic form for clarity and power.
For any of you who may be
wondering, Lear's daughters are
still giving him trouble.
The most entertaining offering
this season, and the greatest
crowd pleaser, was George Ber
nard Shaw's The Devil's Disci
ple. The large cast was the best
balanced of all the Festival pro
ductions, and the direction was
impeccable.
Guest director
Director Michael Liebert, who
is the founder and producing
director of the Berkeley Reper
tory Theatre, managed to play up
the comic elements in the play
while still carefully developing
the more serious social commen
tary intended by Shaw. His
blocking elucidated the play's
thematic progress all the way
through the curtain call. In the
title role, Barry Mulholland was
dashing and debonair, yet he
demonstrated the sincerity and

tenderness also required by this
difficult role.
As for Mulholland's portrayal
of Antipholus of Syracuse in
Comedy of Errors, his perfor
mance was difficult to evaluate
since he was constantly being
confused with his twin brother
Brian Mulholland, who played
Antipholus of Ephesus. In any
case, they made a nice package.
This year's history play, Henry
VI, Port 11, is among the most
stage-worthy of Shakespeare's
texts. Though it is a weak piece
of literature, this emotional,
action-packed play seems to
jump off the stage into the audi
ence, and it was directed with
maximum effectiveness by the
Festival's producing director,
Jerry Turner. In the title role,
John Warren Tyson gave a sym
pathetic and very believable por
trayal of the confused and naive
young King.
Henry VI, Part II serves as a
lesson to all of us not to discount
each season's history play as an
admirable scholarly endeavor by
the festival. These plays are
often among the most moving
and educational productions
the season, even for audience
members unseasoned in

Shakespeare.
Unfortunately, the festival
was weakened by an uninspired
production of Much Ado About
Nothing. This frequently per
formed comedy is among
Shakespeare's finest, but Ash
land's production lacked
energy, the cast did not gel, and
Jim Edmondson's direction was
generally slow and unimagina
tive.
The festival company's new
theatre ensemble, called the
Black Swan Theatre, periodi
cally staged performances of
lesser-known works. These pro
ductions were as much for the
satisfaction of the festival ac
tors as they were designed for
festival visitors.
Black Swan gives Ashland
players an opportunity to take a
break from their rigorous
schedule and work together to
develop their theatrical skills.
This third stage also offers the
Oregon visitor a rare chance to
see "works-in-progress" per
formed with unusual energy and
imagination by some of the ris
ing stars of contemporary
theatre.
A midnight performance of
the Ancient Greek drama Medea,
with Sands Hall in the title role,
exemplified the innovative
character of Black Swan produc
tions. Though it lacked the
polish of the regular season's
plays, the players were clearly
inspired by the potential for ex
perimentation. The majority of
the audience was made up of
other festival actors, thus creat
ing a unique sense of solidarity
between actor and audience.
New dimension
Now in its first year, this dedi
cated ensemble is likely to add
another valuable dimension to
the Ashland Festival as Black
Swan matures and refines itself.
As usual, there were a couple
of players who highlighted this

season's acting company. This
year's leading pair were Denis
Arndt and Christine Healy. De
spite Arndt's weaknesses as
Lear, both were exceptional in
all their performances. The col
lision between Arndt and Healy
as Ben and Regina Hubbard in
Little Foxes was taut dramatic
dynamite, both these individu
als appear destined for great
success as professionals.
Kudos also go to Ron Woods
for an exquisite portrayal of
Edgar in Leiir, and Joseph I)e
Salvio for his exceptional per
formances in the diverse roles of
Anthony Anderson (Devil's Dis
ciple). Dromio of Syracuse
(Comedy of Errors), and the Earl
of Salisbury (Henry V/).
But once again, the success of
Shakespeare '76 was a joint ef
fort, and the cooperative spirit of
the company showed
everywhere from the crowd
scenes of Henry VI to the pool
games at Capp's Tavern. The
lectures in Lithia Park, the Re
naissance music and dancing on
the green preceding each show,
the quaint shops and friendly
townsfolk, all remained full of
vitality even as late into the sea
son as September.
The Festival STAGE II Spring
season will run for eight weeks
from February 11 through April
9, 1977. This season's offerings
are Shakespeare's Measure for
Measure, Angel Street by Patrick
Hamilton, and Sheridan's The
Rivals. While these plays rotate
in the Indoor Theatre, Black
Swan will present Shelagh De
laney's A Taste of Honey every
Sunday night.
And if you think the Rogue
River offers beautiful swimming
in the summer, you should try
the skiing offered on Mt. Ash
land during the winter. Yet
another cunning ploy by those
devilish tricksters at the Oregon
Shakespeare Festival.


Multi-faced thespian
Denis Arndt, a three-year veteran of the OSFA, is
pictured above in the three roles he portrayed last sum
mer. At left, Arndt plays the despondent, half-crazed King
Lear desperately clutching his Fool as he is comforted by
the Earl of Kent. At center, Arndt is General John Bur-

goyne disciplining his British Redcoat subordinate in
The Devil's Disciple. At right, Arndt portrays the cunning
Ben Hubbard interogating his nephew Leo as brother
Oscar looks on in The Little Foxes. Arndt is also the
director of the Festival Company's Black Swan Theatre.
This summer, like every
summer, William Shakespeare
nearly incited a mdssriot in Ash
land, Oregon. His battle-cry this
year was Comedy of Errors, and
as usual, the box office stalwarts
had to battle back ticket-craving
lunatics threatening to tear
down the walls of the Angus
Bowmer Theatre.
Hut the blame should not rest
on Shakespeare. The real cul
prits are that tribe of trouble
making Renaissance fanatics
known as the Oregon Shakes
peare Festival Association.
Every year they resurrect the
Master and his works in all their
glory, and we, the audience and
would-be audience, are but
pawns in their macabre machi
nations.
Not only do the productions
treat us to merciless doses of ex
quisite theatre, but the town it
self is so warm and picturesque
that we cannot help but forget all
the cares and worries of the
everyday world we left at home.
With all the seductive cunning
of Lady Macbeth, the OS FA

difficult role.
As for Mulholland's portrayal
of Antipholus of Syracuse in
Comedy of Errors, his perfor
mance was difficult to evaluate
since he was constantly being
confused with his twin brother
Brian Mulholland, who played
Antipholus of Ephesus. In any
case, they made a nice package.
This year's history play, Henry
VI, Port 11, is among the most
stage-worthy of Shakespeare's
texts. Though it is a weak piece
of literature, this emotional,
action-packed play seems to
jump off the stage into the audi
ence, and it was directed with
maximum effectiveness by the
Festival's producing director,
Jerry Turner. In the title role,
John Warren Tyson gave a sym
pathetic and very believable por
trayal of the confused and naive
young King.
Henry VI, Part II serves as a
lesson to all of us not to discount
each season's history play as an
admirable scholarly endeavor by
the festival. These plays are
often among the most moving
and educational productions
the season, even for audience
members unseasoned in

Shakespeare.
Unfortunately, the festival
was weakened by an uninspired
production of Much Ado About
Nothing. This frequently per
formed comedy is among
Shakespeare's finest, but Ash
land's production lacked
energy, the cast did not gel, and
Jim Edmondson's direction was
generally slow and unimagina
tive.
The festival company's new
theatre ensemble, called the
Black Swan Theatre, periodi
cally staged performances of
lesser-known works. These pro
ductions were as much for the
satisfaction of the festival ac
tors as they were designed for
festival visitors.
Black Swan gives Ashland
players an opportunity to take a
break from their rigorous
schedule and work together to
develop their theatrical skills.
This third stage also offers the
Oregon visitor a rare chance to
see "works-in-progress" per
formed with unusual energy and
imagination by some of the ris
ing stars of contemporary
theatre.
A midnight performance of
the Ancient Greek drama Medea,
with Sands Hall in the title role,
exemplified the innovative
character of Black Swan produc
tions. Though it lacked the
polish of the regular season's
plays, the players were clearly
inspired by the potential for ex
perimentation. The majority of
the audience was made up of
other festival actors, thus creat
ing a unique sense of solidarity
between actor and audience.
New dimension
Now in its first year, this dedi
cated ensemble is likely to add
another valuable dimension to
the Ashland Festival as Black
Swan matures and refines itself.
As usual, there were a couple
of players who highlighted this

season's acting company. This
year's leading pair were Denis
Arndt and Christine Healy. De
spite Arndt's weaknesses as
Lear, both were exceptional in
all their performances. The col
lision between Arndt and Healy
as Ben and Regina Hubbard in
Little Foxes was taut dramatic
dynamite, both these individu
als appear destined for great
success as professionals.
Kudos also go to Ron Woods
for an exquisite portrayal of
Edgar in Leiir, and Joseph I)e
Salvio for his exceptional per
formances in the diverse roles of
Anthony Anderson (Devil's Dis
ciple). Dromio of Syracuse
(Comedy of Errors), and the Earl
of Salisbury (Henry V/).
But once again, the success of
Shakespeare '76 was a joint ef
fort, and the cooperative spirit of
the company showed
everywhere from the crowd
scenes of Henry VI to the pool
games at Capp's Tavern. The
lectures in Lithia Park, the Re
naissance music and dancing on
the green preceding each show,
the quaint shops and friendly
townsfolk, all remained full of
vitality even as late into the sea
son as September.
The Festival STAGE II Spring
season will run for eight weeks
from February 11 through April
9, 1977. This season's offerings
are Shakespeare's Measure for
Measure, Angel Street by Patrick
Hamilton, and Sheridan's The
Rivals. While these plays rotate
in the Indoor Theatre, Black
Swan will present Shelagh De
laney's A Taste of Honey every
Sunday night.
And if you think the Rogue
River offers beautiful swimming
in the summer, you should try
the skiing offered on Mt. Ash
land during the winter. Yet
another cunning ploy by those
devilish tricksters at the Oregon
Shakespeare Festival.


Multi-faced thespian
Denis Arndt, a three-year veteran of the OSFA, is
pictured above in the three roles he portrayed last sum
mer. At left, Arndt plays the despondent, half-crazed King
Lear desperately clutching his Fool as he is comforted by
the Earl of Kent. At center, Arndt is General John Bur-

goyne disciplining his British Redcoat subordinate in
The Devil's Disciple. At right, Arndt portrays the cunning
Ben Hubbard interogating his nephew Leo as brother
Oscar looks on in The Little Foxes. Arndt is also the
director of the Festival Company's Black Swan Theatre.
