Violence erupts in San Sebastian
Madrid, Spain — Angered over the killing of police by
Basque separtists, right-wing demonstrators yesterday
chanted a Franco anthem and shouted for the government
to resign and for the army to seize power.
The demands from a crowd in the Spanish capital fol
lowed a night of right-wing violence in San Sebastian. The
northern Basque city was the scene of the killings of the
police and the injuring of more than a dozen persons.
Government officials discounted the impact of the
right-wing protest as the work of extremists without any
real political base. But they acknowledged further out
bursts were likely as rightist leaders called for a series of
funeral masses across the nation to protest the slaying of
one of King Juan Carlos' advisers and his four police
bodyguards.
Cuban jet plunges into Caribbean
Bridgetown, Barbados — A Cuban passenger jet
plunged into the sea near this Caribbean holiday island
yesterday while trying to return to Barbados after an exp
losion on board. Rescue officials said none of the 78 per
sons .aboard survived.
Barbados Coast Cuard launches and Bridgetown port
tugs that sped to the crash site 11 miles offshore, along

with an armada of volunteer pleasure boats, found only
wreckage and bodies.
"There were badly mangled bodies bobbing in the wa
ter" and pieces of the smashed aircraft, one witness said.
"It (the plane) was 30 miles out of Barbados, about 1400
miles southeast of Miami, when the pilot reported an
explosion in flight," said Carol Lencki, a spokeswoman
for the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta, Ga.
Union executives consider agreement
Detroit — Top executives of the United Auto Workers
(UAW) were being asked yesterday to accept a tentative
three-year agreement between the union and Ford Motor
Co.
The UAW's International Executive Board, made up of
26 officers and regional directors, and the union's Na
tional Ford Council must approve the offer before it goes
to the 99 Ford bargaining units around the country for a
ratification vote. The executive board was to meet last
night.
Details of the accord will not be made public until the
board and the council approve it.
Meanwhile, some of the 170,000 rank-and-file UAW
Ford workers, who also must approve the agreement
reached late Tuesday, predicted easy passage and an end
to a nationwide strike now in its 23rd day.
Sources said a key element in the pact is a provision for
13 more paid days off spread over the three years. Ford
workers now have 33 holiday and vacation days each year.
The sources said the additional time-off provisions are
tied to attendance requirements.
Humphrey prepares for cancer surgery
New York — Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.), was
described as cheerful yesterday on the eve of an operation
to remove his cancerous bladder.
The senator's wife, Muriel, was spending as much time
as possible with him in Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center.
Humphrey was scheduled to be taken to the operating
room at 8:30 this morning, for surgery lasting six to eight
hours.
After the removal of the bladder and any additional
diseased tissue, the physicians will take a small piece of
the bowel to make a drain through the abdomen which
will allow the urine to drain into a bag. The operation also
is expected to leave Humphrey impotent.
Today's weather
Fair through Friday with warm sunny days. Highs today
and tomorrow in the mid 80s to low 90s. Overnight lows in
the 50s to low 60s. Variable winds sto 15 mph afternoons.

yesterday while trying to return to Barbados after an exp
losion on board. Rescue officials said none of the 78 per
sons .aboard survived.
Barbados Coast Cuard launches and Bridgetown port
tugs that sped to the crash site 11 miles offshore, along

with an armada of volunteer pleasure boats, found only
wreckage and bodies.
"There were badly mangled bodies bobbing in the wa
ter" and pieces of the smashed aircraft, one witness said.
"It (the plane) was 30 miles out of Barbados, about 1400
miles southeast of Miami, when the pilot reported an
explosion in flight," said Carol Lencki, a spokeswoman
for the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta, Ga.
Union executives consider agreement
Detroit — Top executives of the United Auto Workers
(UAW) were being asked yesterday to accept a tentative
three-year agreement between the union and Ford Motor
Co.
The UAW's International Executive Board, made up of
26 officers and regional directors, and the union's Na
tional Ford Council must approve the offer before it goes
to the 99 Ford bargaining units around the country for a
ratification vote. The executive board was to meet last
night.
Details of the accord will not be made public until the
board and the council approve it.
Meanwhile, some of the 170,000 rank-and-file UAW
Ford workers, who also must approve the agreement
reached late Tuesday, predicted easy passage and an end
to a nationwide strike now in its 23rd day.
Sources said a key element in the pact is a provision for
13 more paid days off spread over the three years. Ford
workers now have 33 holiday and vacation days each year.
The sources said the additional time-off provisions are
tied to attendance requirements.
Humphrey prepares for cancer surgery
New York — Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.), was
described as cheerful yesterday on the eve of an operation
to remove his cancerous bladder.
The senator's wife, Muriel, was spending as much time
as possible with him in Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center.
Humphrey was scheduled to be taken to the operating
room at 8:30 this morning, for surgery lasting six to eight
hours.
After the removal of the bladder and any additional
diseased tissue, the physicians will take a small piece of
the bowel to make a drain through the abdomen which
will allow the urine to drain into a bag. The operation also
is expected to leave Humphrey impotent.
Today's weather
Fair through Friday with warm sunny days. Highs today
and tomorrow in the mid 80s to low 90s. Overnight lows in
the 50s to low 60s. Variable winds sto 15 mph afternoons.
Violence erupts in San Sebastian
Madrid, Spain — Angered over the killing of police by
Basque separtists, right-wing demonstrators yesterday
chanted a Franco anthem and shouted for the government
to resign and for the army to seize power.
The demands from a crowd in the Spanish capital fol
lowed a night of right-wing violence in San Sebastian. The
northern Basque city was the scene of the killings of the
police and the injuring of more than a dozen persons.
Government officials discounted the impact of the
right-wing protest as the work of extremists without any
real political base. But they acknowledged further out
bursts were likely as rightist leaders called for a series of
funeral masses across the nation to protest the slaying of
one of King Juan Carlos' advisers and his four police
bodyguards.
