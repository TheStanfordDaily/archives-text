Searsville Lake â€” The Board of Trustees' Committee
on Academic Affairs has recommended to the Board that
public: use of Searsville Lake be modified so that the lake
would become an "outdoor education center," according
to the Administrative Director of Jasper Ridge, Alan
Grundmann.
The board will consider the recommendation at its Oct.
12 meeting, Grundman said.
An article in Tuesday's Palo Alto Times which indi
cated that Searsville might close "had the wrong em
phasis," Grundmann said.
"It is not our intent to close the lake to the public," he
added. "We want to have it open under slightly different
terms."
A lease between the university, which owns the lake,
and concessionaire Don Beeson, who runs a snack bar
there, will probably be bought back by the university
under terms included in the lease.
The lake will probably also be closed for swimmers, a
move which has been seen as inevitable for several years,
according to Grudmann.
