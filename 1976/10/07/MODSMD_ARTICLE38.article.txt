# SCOPE disclaims Cooney's charge
## 
### 
Brad Krevoy, co-director of the
Stanford Committee on Political
Education (SCOPE), said that an
upcoming SCOPE-sponsored de
bate is limited to 12th District con
gressional candidates Paul
McCloskey Jr. and David Harris be
cause SCOPE decided "that's what
the candidates wanted."
SCOPE has been criticized by
American Independent Party con
gressional candidate Joss Cooney
for excluding him from participat
ing in the debate.
The debate is one of a series of
four originally set up by McCloskey
and Harris. Cooney has not been

asked to participate in any of them.
Tom Graham, the student co
director of theSWOPSI program, at
tempted to give Cooney a chance to
enter the debate. "When he asked to
be included, we contacted both
candidates, and they did not want
him on the platform," he said.
According to Donna Patterson,
field director for the Harris cam
paign, "We have no argument with
Cooney, and we don't think it's ap
propriate to include him in the de
bates."
The debate is scheduled for 8
p.m. next Thursday in Stanford
Law School's Kresge Auditorium.
