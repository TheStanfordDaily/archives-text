# New campus parking system plagued by mix-ups, confusion
## 
### Mike Charlson 
Problems in implementing the new
parking system here continue to con
fuse irritated drivers.
Confusion over the status of differ
ent parking lots around the campus
seems the main complaint. General
Services Manager John Catania con
firmed that the signs in one lot were
changed up to three times during the
past week.
The parking system,which was
planned for completion before the be
ginning of autumn quarter, is now in
the final stage of sign posting, which is
expected to be completed today, ac
cording to Catania.
Catania said that sign posting was
delayed because Plant Services was
forced to order the signs after the new
parking bumper stickers arrived so
that close color matching could be
achieved.
When the signs were received, Plant
Services discovered that there were
half as many signs as needed.
After a second order was received,
posting was delayed due to electrical
storms, Catania said.
More 'A' spaces
Further problems included posting
the wrong signs in certain lots which
required changing of some signs. Fi
nally, some 200 spaces were reclas
sified into the "A" category to correct a
deficiency in the number of available
spaces after more "A" permits
were sold than had been anticipated,
according to Master Planner Oscar
Nelson.
Total budgeted cost of the program
is estimated at about $200,000. accord
ing to Nelson. The cost is to be made
up entirely by permit fees.
Nelson said he thinks the $200,000
would be paid out of permit revenue

with little difficulty. If the revenue was
deficient, Nelson said that the univer
sity would make up the difference.
Hospital revenue
Director of Police Services Marvin
Harrington reported that as of Oct. 4,
permit income from the main campus
totalled nearly $110,000. Additional
tens of thousands of dollars are due
from permits sold at the Medical
Center. However, totals will not be
available until mid-October.
Many students and employes here
have protested parking fees as unfair.
Nelson claims that the fee assess
ment for parking permits is entirely in
line, however.
"We are just coming out of the dark
ages on parking," he said. He notes
that every major college in the country
charges for parking. Nelson cited the
example of UCLA, where permits cost
some $120 a year, double the cost of
the most expensive Stanford permit.
'Free ride'
"The motorists on this campus have
been getting literally a free ride for 50
years. It's about time they start carry
ing their share of the load," Nelson
said.
Nelson explained that in addition to
paying the day-to-day expenses of the
traffic system, parking fees are also
used for road maintainance and new
parking facility construction. He
claims that the costs are exorbitant. A
landscaped, lighted parking lot with
walkways plus access ways to roads
costs between $500 and $900 per stall
totalling possibly "millions of dol
lars," Nelson said.
The United Stanford Employees
(USE), one of the longtime spearhead
ers of plans to abolish fee parking, has

a quite different view. USE President
Roger Hardy said , "Employes simply
shouldn't have to pay to park where
they work. For that matter students
shouldn't have to pay either, consider
ing the huge tuition costs atStanford."
Pay toilets?
Union reporter Clenda Jones echoed
the president's remarks. She disagreed
emphatically with Nelson that parking
should be paid for by the motorists.
"This is just another facility which
would be provided for employes like
toilets and chairs. Are they going to
put in pay toilets for those who use
toilets?" she asked.
USE had made the issue of free park
ing one of its demands in ongoing
contract negotiations with the univer
sity. In the recently expired contract,
workers were guaranteed free parking.
They seek free parking in "convenient
locations" this year.
The new parking system has three
different permit levels. Only the "C"
permit is free.

Signs of change
University personnel have been busy placing and replacing signs at the
various lots in the new parking system. Confusion reigned when the signs
at one lot were changed at least three times this week.
