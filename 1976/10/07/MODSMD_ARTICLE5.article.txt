# Army chief takes over in Thailand; 35 killed

### 
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — A milit
ary man known for his tough stance
against communism seized power in
Thailand yesterday after savage battles
between leftist and rightist students
that left at least 22 persons dead and
about 180 wounded, by police count.
Unconfirmed reports put the death
toll at 35 or more.
Defense Minister Sangad Chalawyu
who was armed forces chief until six
days ago, took power from Prime
Minister Seni Pramoj and declared
martial law. The 60-year-old Sangad,
who is considered pro-American, said
he did not want Thailand to become a
prey to communists.
Two of the victims were hanged and
their bodies mutilated, and others
were set afire in the fighting at Tham
masat University. The violence grew
out of leftist protests against the return
home last month of former dictator
Thanom Kitikachorn, who was ousted
by student protests three years ago.
Thanom was not believed to have
played an active role in the coup itself.
He and Sangad were on poor terms
when Thanom was in power.
Leftist student opposition also led to
the withdrawal last spring of all re
maining American servicemen in
Thailand, a close ally of the United
States during the Vietnam war. By
night, the city was calm with no overt
opposition to the takeover.
"You can sleep well tonight. You
don't have to live in fear anymore,"
Sangad told the nation in an evening
television broadcast.
Police said most of the confirmed
dead were students. More than 1300
students were arrested.
Fighting first erupted on Tham
masat campus between right-wing and
left-wing students, then waves of
police firing machine guns stormed
the leftists. Right-wing groups moved
in again behind the police.
Then a right-wing mob of about
10,000 broke through the gates of Thai
land's government house but did not
enter the building itself, which was
surrounded by 1500 police.
Rightists hanged two leftists and at
tacked the bodies with sticks, gouging
out the eyes and cutting the throats.
The body of another victim lay head
less on the college grounds.
