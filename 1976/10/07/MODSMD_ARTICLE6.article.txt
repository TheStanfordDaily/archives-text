# Ruling of hearing may set precedent

A suit charging Ravenswood and
surrounding school districts with ra
cial segregation was filed in California
Superior Court this week.
A San Mateo County judge has is
sued an alternative writ directing
Midpeninsula school districts and the
State of California to appear in court to
answer a charge that Midpeninsula
school districts are segregated.
A hearing, at which the defendants
must either submit desegregation
plans or show cause why they have not
done so, has been set for November 4.
The case was filed by seven attor
neys on behalf of parents of 37 chil
dren in several Midpeninsula school
districts. The suit focuses on the
Ravenswood City Elementary School
District of East Palo Alto and Eastern
Menlo Park which is surrounded by
predominantly white districts.
If successful, the suit would break
new ground, marking the first time
that a California court has ruled that a
school district as a whole unit is ra
cially unbalanced. Previous suits
charged segregation at individual
schools within districts.
There are about 3300 students in the
five schools of the Ravenswood dis
trict. Four of those schools have a 98
per cent minority population and one,
Willow Oaks, has a 74 per cent minor
ity enrollment.
Named as defendants in the suit are
the State of California, the committees
on school district organization of San
Mateo and Santa Clara Counties, the
San Mateo school superintendent and
trustees of the districts of Palo Alto,
Sequoia, Ravenswood, Menlo Park,
Las Lomitas, Woodside, Portola Val
ley, Redwood City, San Carlos and
Belmont.
"Reasonable and feasible steps are
available to respondents to eliminate
the segregated schools," the text of the
suit reads. "Because of the great pre
ponderence of minority students in the

Ravenswood district, the only reason
able and feasible steps . . . involve dis
tricts surrounding the Ravenswood
district."
According to Jack Robertson, an at
torney not connected with the case
who has led desegregation efforts in
the Midpeninsula for 10 years, "If the
judge finds that a cross-district remedy
is appropriate, he will order somebody
to come up with a plan. Several pos
sibilities might be submitted to him."
Robertson is a member of the Mid
peninsula Task Force for Integrated
Education, which tried unsuccessfully
last year to get San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties to approve a merger
which would have opened the door for
desegregation. A lawsuit was
threatened when the proposal was re
jected.
James Halley, one of the plaintiff pa
rents, said, "Other districts have better
facilities, better equipment, and even
more field trips than Ravenswood.
They are more mind-expanding. . . .
Our children would like to feel that
they are a part of the world."
"The white districts are inferior
too," said Joel Goldfus, another plain
tiff, "in that they do not provide a cli
mate where children can learn of chil
dren of other backgrounds."
The suit has the support of the East
Palo Alto Municipal Council as well as
of the regional office of the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP).
"The California Supreme Court has
said with unmistakable clarity that
segregated schools must be elimi
nated," said the NAACP's regional di
rector Virna Canson. "The
Ravenswood suit, if successful, will
close the last legal loophole â€” in
stances in which entire districts are
segregated."
The text of the suit includes state test
scores which show Ravenswood stu
dents near the bottom and students of
several surrounding districts near the
top.
