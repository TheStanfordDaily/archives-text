## Networks deny equal coverage 
### 
Victoria Gahart

I'm wondering if many of the Daily's
readers have stopped to think about
one of the implications of the Ford-
Carter debate on Sept. 23. Lester
Maddox of the American Independent
party, Peter Camejo of the Socialist
Workers party and Eugene McCarthy
all attempted to be included in the
widely televised publicity opportun
ity, but were denied by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC)
in the case of the former two presiden
tial candidates, and by the U.S. Court
of Appeals in McCarthy's case.
Although the FCC has required in
the past that candidates be given
"equal time" in the media coverage of
elections, apparently the fine print in
this rule reads, "major candidates
should receive equal time," or "only
t hose candidates who have a chance to
win."
In essence, the FCC has taken it upon
itself to choose who should receive
political coverage rather than leave
this to the discretion of individual
networks or television stations.
McCarthy based his suit on the claim
that he has a mathematical chance to
win the election. Why must a candi
date be likely to win in order to be
given publicity? How will the voters
ever know if a viable alternative to the
Republican and Democratic candi
dates exists if minor parties are not
given an opportunity to make their
platform known?
Freedom of speech
Freedom of speech is one of the
rights that is supposed to make the
American political system democratic
and fair. Hut this liberty has not been
possible in recent history in the United
States because those candidates with

wealthy supporters and nationwide
partisan organizations are much more
"free" to speak to the national consti
tuency than are "third party" candi
dates.
As Lester Maddox has been quoted,
Carter and Ford "have been able to use
the television and radio network
media for their exclusive candidacy
purposes."
Ron Nessen, press secretary to the
incumbent president, justified the
limitation of the debate to Carter and
Ford on the grounds that additional
participants would distract the view
ers' attention from the purpose of the
debate — to expose the two major can
didates to the public.
Status quo
The assumption of the FCC and
other political spokespersons is that
the two present parties will preserve
the status quo of the economic and so
cial situation of the United States.
Elected and appointed representatives
of the populace are willing to let the
inertia of the current election habits
exclude minor candidates because
they realize that if voters were exposed
to new, unusual viewpoints, those
who currently benefit from the politi
cal process may lose their happy cir
cumstances.
When one considers that govern
ment under a Republican president or
Congress does not differ radically from
that of the Democratic party, it begins
to appear that we really have no choice
at all. Either one middle-of-the-road
capitalist or another of the same.
Is this really democratic representa
tion of the people?

the two present parties will preserve
the status quo of the economic and so
cial situation of the United States.
Elected and appointed representatives
of the populace are willing to let the
inertia of the current election habits
exclude minor candidates because
they realize that if voters were exposed
to new, unusual viewpoints, those
who currently benefit from the politi
cal process may lose their happy cir
cumstances.
When one considers that govern
ment under a Republican president or
Congress does not differ radically from
that of the Democratic party, it begins
to appear that we really have no choice
at all. Either one middle-of-the-road
capitalist or another of the same.
Is this really democratic representa
tion of the people?

I'm wondering if many of the Daily's
readers have stopped to think about
one of the implications of the Ford-
Carter debate on Sept. 23. Lester
Maddox of the American Independent
party, Peter Camejo of the Socialist
Workers party and Eugene McCarthy
all attempted to be included in the
widely televised publicity opportun
ity, but were denied by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC)
in the case of the former two presiden
tial candidates, and by the U.S. Court
of Appeals in McCarthy's case.
Although the FCC has required in
the past that candidates be given
"equal time" in the media coverage of
elections, apparently the fine print in
this rule reads, "major candidates
should receive equal time," or "only
t hose candidates who have a chance to
win."
In essence, the FCC has taken it upon
itself to choose who should receive
political coverage rather than leave
this to the discretion of individual
networks or television stations.
McCarthy based his suit on the claim
that he has a mathematical chance to
win the election. Why must a candi
date be likely to win in order to be
given publicity? How will the voters
ever know if a viable alternative to the
Republican and Democratic candi
dates exists if minor parties are not
given an opportunity to make their
platform known?
Freedom of speech
Freedom of speech is one of the
rights that is supposed to make the
American political system democratic
and fair. Hut this liberty has not been
possible in recent history in the United
States because those candidates with

wealthy supporters and nationwide
partisan organizations are much more
"free" to speak to the national consti
tuency than are "third party" candi
dates.
As Lester Maddox has been quoted,
Carter and Ford "have been able to use
the television and radio network
media for their exclusive candidacy
purposes."
Ron Nessen, press secretary to the
incumbent president, justified the
limitation of the debate to Carter and
Ford on the grounds that additional
participants would distract the view
ers' attention from the purpose of the
debate — to expose the two major can
didates to the public.
Status quo
The assumption of the FCC and
other political spokespersons is that
the two present parties will preserve
the status quo of the economic and so
cial situation of the United States.
Elected and appointed representatives
of the populace are willing to let the
inertia of the current election habits
