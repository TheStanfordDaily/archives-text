KING
KONG
Made in 1933, KING KONG remains the classic monster film.
The prototype of the genre, it is the first truly cinematic ap
proach to the fantastic. This is the original, uncut, banned-in-
Boston version, including footage originally deleted as "too
shocking." With Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong.
