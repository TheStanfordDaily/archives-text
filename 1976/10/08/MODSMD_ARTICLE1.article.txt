# Debate debacle: citizens assess the 'show'
## Local views voiced vary 
### Marc Strassman 
Democrats and Republicans differed sharply in their
assessments of their respective presidential candidates'
performances during Wednesday night's debate on
foreign policy and defense.
Supporters of Republican candidate Gerald Ford
thought that he was "presidential" while criticizing
Democratic candidate Jimmy Carter as "elusive." On the
other hand. Democrats praised Carter's independence and
leadership capacity, but scored Ford for what they consi
dered excessive secrecy in the conduct of foreign affairs.
David 11 arris. Democratic candidate for Congress in the
I 2th District, said bethought "the momentum was clearly
with Carter. It it had been a college debate. 1 would have
scored it 65-35 for Carter. Carter clearly dominated the
debate, and he had Ford on the defensive.
"There were times, however, when I didn't feel rep
resented by eit her of them, like when they werediscussing
Panama, or the 20 minutes during which they refought the
Cold War. Hut Carter had good stands on arms sales, nu
clear proliferation and on getting domestic values into our
foreign policy."
Republican Congressman Pete McCloskey, Harris' op
ponent in the race for the 12th district seat, could not be
reached for comment.
I larvey I lukari. regional director of the Republican Na
tional Committee, who is a Stanford graduate (1968) and
former editor of the Stanford Arenu, said that Carter was
"devious, but had good style." I lukari said in support of
Foril that "leadership is demonstrated by results," citing a
stabilized situation in the Middle East, progress in
Rhodesia and no American soldiers dying in combat."

Hukari admitted that the president's assertion that East
ern European countries were not under Soviet domination
was "the one slip that allowed Carter to gain some points."
Hukari's evaluation of the Democratic challenger was t hat
"Carter's performance was an improvement over the first
debate. But he lacked substance and remained elusive."
The Republican candidate, he said, "was presidential in
defense of his policies."
Hukari who was in the audience at the Palace of Fine
Arts during the debate with Mary Louise Smith, the cur
rent Republican National chairman, said she could not
comment on Carter's positions because, according to her.
he "didn't say anything of substance."
These feelings were not shared by Alan Piatt, a post
doctoral fellow in political science who. along with teach
ing a lecture course on American foreign policy and a
seminar on the role of Congress in foreign relations, is a
member of the Northern California Speakers Bureau for
Carter-Mondale.
Piatt said he felt that "Carter made it clear that he has
some definite ideas about the direction that the United
States should take in foreign policy and demonstrated his
capacity to lead us in these directions."
Improved relations with Congress
Piatt, who worked as a legislative assistant for foreign
affairs for Senator Edmund Muskiefrom 1972-75. said that
Carter would work to improve the executive branch's rela
tions with Congress and would align himself with "the
concerns the Congress has expressed on human rights."
Carter would bring more openness to the conduct of
foreign policy. Piatt said, as opposed to the methods cur-
