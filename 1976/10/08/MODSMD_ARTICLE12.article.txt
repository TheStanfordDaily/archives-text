# U.S. swine flu program questionable
## 
### 
This past summer brought its usual
share of absurdities.
Take the bizarre case of the tennis
transsexual, Renee Richards.
Jesus Christ. It wasn't long ago that
any grade school kid could have set
tled the question of whether one was a
man or woman. But considering the
Women's Professional Tennis Associ
ation conclusion that Richards doesn't
qualify as a woman, we may now have
to formulate an entirely new classifica
tion for such people. So it goes.
Along with this type of folderol was
the government's decision to institute
a $126 million swine flu irnmuniza
< i

tion program. Buckling under to the
pressures of an election year (the par
ticipants deny this, but one can hardly
consider them impartial sources),
Congress and the president improvi
dently rushed through a bill to provide
for a program of free injections and
after problems arose over malpractice
insurance coverage, incorporated pro
visions making the government the in
itial defendant in malpractice cases.

A careful look at the rationale for
such a program reveals the tenuous
support it has mustered. But before
expatiating on this, one must investi
gate whether the government should
have a role in public health questions
Of this sort.
Ideally, private industry should deal
with the public demand for immuniza
tion from swine flu. However, the
economic concentration of the phar
maceutical industry makes it unlikely
that private firms would produce suf
ficient vaccine to meet the public de
mand; due to the oligopolistic nature
of the industry, it does not conform to
the usual rigors of competition.
The pharmaceutical industry has
also had very little chance to decide
how much demand there will be for
the vaccine because the disease was
isolated in July of this year. Con
sequently, even if the pharmaceutical
industry were competitive, in the pro
cess of adjusting the production of
vaccine to demand, insufficient vac
cine might be produced and a great
many people might die.
As a consequence, the government
has a right to legislate in this domain;
it hasa valid rationalefora vaccination
program such as it has instituted.
However, this justification for an
immunization program rests on the
premise that an epidemic will occur.

The validity of that premise is suspect,
to say the least.
The present swine influenza scare
dates to February 4, when Private
David Lewis died of swine flu at Fort
Dix, New Jersey. The Army estimates
that 500 men out of the 1200 on the
base contracted the disease before the
disease mysteriously seemed to extin
guish itself.
During the same period and extend
ing beyond the swine flu's reign.
A/Victoria influenza was raging
through Fort Dix, infecting far more
soldiers than did swine flu (now label
led as A/New Jersey). Usually in
fluenza variants that cause epidemics
spread rapidly and are more virulent
than their known brethren; A/New Jer
sey failed to do either.
The A/New Jersey virus has been
tentatively identified as the same flu
virus as the one responsible for the
pandemic of 1918-1919 (researchers
can't be positive they are the same
since flu viruses weren't first isolated
until the late 19:H)s). Some 20 million
people worldwide, including nearly
500,000 Americans, died in that
epidemic.
The origination of the 1918-1919
virus is not known (the prevailing
view is that the virus came from
Spain), but somewhere along the line
pigs contracted it, and the disease still
flourishes in hog populations.
What is particularly novel about the
A/New Jersey strain is its ability to pass
from humans to humans, or from pigs
to humans. Most animal influenzas are
rarely contracted by humans.
Advocates of the immunization
program point out that flu epidemics
traditionally have occurred in nine to
11 year cyclesâ€” and the last epidemic
was the Hong Kong flu outbreak of
19H8-()9.
As the peroration of their spiel, im
munization advocates note that flu
can only be treated symptomatically,
i.e., the disease cannot be directly
combated.
The fault in these arguments is that
the facts don't bear out the arguments'
dire predictions of travail.
Few recent cases of swine flu are on
record. Furthermore, the disease has
failed to take hold like past strains that

became epidemic.
And fears of another epidemic of the
1918-1919 magnitude are unwar
ranted. Edwin Kilbourne notes in his
book Influenza Virus and Influenza
that most of the deaths in 1918-1919
were caused because antibiotics to
treat pneumonia and other complica
tions of the virus had yet to be de
veloped. unsanitary conditions
existed among fighting troops, and
troops were constantly being moved
about.
Indeed, the World Health Organiza
tion originally pronounced our im
munization program unwarranted
until "we beat the hell out of them," as
an official of the American Advisory
Commission on Immunization Prac
tices reportedly said.
And although the cause of the
legionnaire deaths remains undisco
vered, it has conclusively been deter
mined that they did not die of swine
flu; the spate of legionnaire deaths was
the immediate instigation of the bill.
Kep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) notes
that the measure was pushed through
so rapidly he hadn't "seen anything
like it since theGulf ofTonkin" resolu
tion. Not enough investigation wars
conducted on the necessity of im
munizations, Waxman said.
What is more frightening, Martin
Goldfield of the New Jersey Health De
partment, one of the first persons in
volved with the virus, has estimated
that possibly 15 per cent of people vac
cinated will experience "disabling"
effects (including death, in some
cases).
In any event, a new pandemic in
fluenza usually appears early or before
the flu season starts (which typically is
denoted as November through March);
the 1957 Asian flu appeared late in
September. Much of the present prog
ram could bo too late to have much
effect.
With all these doubts about the effi
cacy of and need for the immunization
program, one has to question whether
the government should have stuck its
nose into the affair in the first place.
The overwhelming answer is "no."
