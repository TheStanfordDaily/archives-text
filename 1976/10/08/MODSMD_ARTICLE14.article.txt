# End waste of surplus crops
##

Earlier this year we were told that
the producers of fruit and vegetables in
California would destroy as much as
1H million tons of their crop if they
secured a bumper harvest.
Many Californians are also aware
that a few years ago dairy producers
turned sewers white with excess milk.
Awareness seems to he lacking,
however, that in the same year India
was suffering a milk shortage. Peoples
of other nations, as well as some per
sons in our own, are in desperate need
of food our farmers and wholesalers
see fit to throw away.
It is no longer a question of taking
the substance from our own mouths
and giving it to others.
America produces about 25 per cent
of the world's food. Wecnn't eat it all!
So why hasn't the food even gotten
to the Americans who need it most?
Money. The people in the food busi
ness have been in the habit of destroy
ing excess food in order to drive the
prices up.
Squeezing sales
In addition to this, irate American
citizens have forced presidents to put
the squeeze on overseas grain sales so
that the prices here at home don't get
too high.
Even if this kind of restriction didn't
slow down or prevent grain sale to
needy countries, the fact would re
main that the Russians, unable to uet

wheat from the United States, would
have to go elsewhere, decreasing the
world supply.
Further, though we have many
surplus crops, from the U.S. point of
view it's more economical to let the
hungry starve. The farmers and food
sellers want no part of those who can't
pay, and our illustrious government,
as you will remember, already gives
millions in foreign aid and is in the
process of "tightening its belt."
To the rampant capitalist, whose
only regard is money, t here seems to be
no solution. To the human being there
are many solutions, some of which
maybe soot hi ng to his money-oriented
alter ego.
As much as is possible, our farmers
must be allowed to sell their produce
overseas. Our government might even
help the food get to the world's hungry
by easing any duties, fees, embargoes
and restrictions specifically keeping
food sellers from peoples in need.
But, due to the fact that money is
scarce among the hungry, our gov
ernment should also take it upon itself
to buy up surplus crops. To countries
who can't afford the food, it should be
freely given as foreign aid.
One real advantage of giving food
rather than money is that food is less
likely to simply line government poc
kets and is not as tempting to trade for
atomic bombs and other weapons.

Besides, people can't eat money.
For t host? nations who can afford to
pay in some degree, even a token one.
we should take that token. We might,
for example, trade food for credit on
the world market or give the food as a
loan. We might even trade the food for
necessary raw materials. Arab nations
with much oil and little arable land
might find themselves interested in
the last proposition.
One obvious thing which our gov
ernment must do with at least some of
this surplus is store non-perishable
and processed food.
The reason for this is two-fold. For
one. we must avoid another food shor
tage. This surplus food is an easy way
to bank against the devastation and
hardship much of the world faced ear
lier in the 1970 s when the whole
world drew a bad harvest.
The other reason for storing surplus
food is monetary. The storage of food
in United Nations and U.S. food banks
can control any wild fluctuations in
the world food market. This can pre
vent poor nations from being priced
out and insure that farmers get a "de
cent" profit.
We can also mitigate any flagrantly
untoward effects of the market on the
prices the American consumer must
pay.
