### Mark Schleiss 
Closing Searsville Lake tc
public swimming and adding
it to the Jasper Kidge Biologi
cal Preserve to maintain the
ecological balance of the area
will be considered next week
by the board of trustees.
According to Alan
Grundmann of the university
biology department, the
proposal to combine the lake
with Jasper Ridge would nol
only enhance its educational
value but also would upholc
the standards of the natural
environment in the entire
preserve.
r.rundmann also stated tha
Don Beeson. the conces
sionaire who presently leases
the lake as a public boating
swimming, fishing and pic
nicking retrejaU would havetc
add chemicals to the lake in
order to keep thearea open foi
swimming in compliance
with the public health laws,
This would kill wildlife not
only in the lake but also in the
streams th.it run out of the
lake, he said.
Andy Doty of the!* Stanford
public relations department
thought that closure of the
swimming facility could

cause some public discontent
but that ultimately it would
be the best course to follow.
He stated. "There are two
sides to the issue. On one
hand Woodside residents
have complained for years
about the noise level and sec
urity problem of having the
lake open, so closing the
swimming area would In
good relations with them. On
the other hand, new problems
will arise with the commun
ity groups that use the lake
presently, so in many ways
it's a no end situation. The
important thing to remember
is land belonging to the uni
versity is of educational
value, not just recreational."
Doty did emphasize, how
ever. that the hike would re
main open in what he called a
"more acceptable public for
mat." Plans for public use in
clude leaving the park open
for picnicking and hiking. In
addition, the lake area would
be open for elementary and
high school students for use
as a nature study area.
Presently the lake attracts
about 90.000 to 1 ()().()()()
swimmers yearly, of which
about 25 percent are from the
local area.
