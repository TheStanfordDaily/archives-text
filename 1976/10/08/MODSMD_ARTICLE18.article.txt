## Solar study favors state 
### Associated Press 
Sacramento — Plentiful sun
shine and scientists should be
enough to make California the
home of the national Solar
Energy Research Institute, l,t.
Cov. Mervyn Dymally says.
Dymally, who discussed the
project last weekend with Presi
dent Cerald Ford in Washington,
s.jit! competition is fierce for the
institute, to be awarded in De
cember by the U.S. Energy Ke
search and Development Ad
ministration (ERDA).
"If ERDA goes on the basis of
objectivity, and not politics, we
should get it. We have the best
proposal," Dymally said in an
interview.
Warm-weather states are
not the only ones trying to get
the institute. Dymally said a
serious bid for the institute is
being made by what he called a
consortium of Northeastern
states.
Banded together, he said, they
have substantial political clout.
An ERDA spokesman in San
Francisco said 20 proposals for
I he institute have been made, in
cluding California's. "It's a great
political plum. There's a lot of
money in it."he said.
The institute will have an es
timated budget of $4 million to
$0 million in the iirst year for
solar energy research. That
would be expected to rise to $10
million to $20 million in three
years.
Much of the economic boost
created by the institute will be
experienced in related indus
tries. blue-collar jobs in sheet
metal workers, pipe-fitters,
plumbers. Dymally said.
Dymally said he met with Ford
to discuss the solar institute "on

the expressed request" of Cov.
Edmund Brown Jr.
"Ford said he was aware ol the
competition involved and that a
number of states were beginning
to realize they have sunshine
now.
"I said, 'Yes, Mr. President,
including Michigan?' and he
said. 'Yes.' "
Dymally said the California
proposal also was put together
by a consortium — not of states
but of universities. It is financed

by a $200.000 grant awarded by
the California Energy Research
and Development Commission.
The University of California.
Stanford University. California
Institute of Technology and
University of Southern Califor
nia submitted California's pro
posal in mid-July.
A former Bethlehem steel
plant at Point Pinole, about nine
miles northwest of Berkeley, is
the proposed institute site.
Dymally said. For the first 18
months, the proposal calls for
use of a two-story. 29,3 50-
square-foot building in
Richmond.
Tests could be conducted in
Imperial County — which "has
more sunshine than any other
place in the country," he said.
The proposed director ot the
institute is Ronald Smelt,
chief scientist for Lockheed
Corp.
"Other states have offered
more in land and in-kind con
tributions, but we have more to
offer," Dymally said.
"California has the techni
cians, the aerospace technology,
the great universities, and more
significantly, the area." Dymally
said.
