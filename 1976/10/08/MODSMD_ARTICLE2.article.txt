# Nation tipping to Carter
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” Democrat Jimmy Carter picked up
more new voter support than President Ford as a result of
their second debate. But his victory in the contest was so
narrow that any significant ballot box payoff must await
their third encounter.
An Associated Press scientific national poll Wednesday
night showed Carter the paper-thin choice of voters both
as the winner of the second debate and as the beneficiary
of more new voter commitment.
His showing reversed the results of the first meeting two
weeks ago. Ford won that contest and gained more sup
port from it than did Carter. But in both debates, the
margins were so close that they could have resulted from
normal statistical variance.
Although more than half the viewers of each debate said
the encounters would have either a great deal or some
influence bn their choice Nov. 2, the net result insofar as a
difference between the candidates is concerned has been
almost nil.
Here is what the AP national telephone poll of 1071
persons Wednesday night and 1065 respondents two
weeks ago found about candidate preference in percen
tage terms: Carter/Ford before first debate: 45.3/41.0. After
first debate: 46.9/44.9. Before second debate: 45.8/43.0.
After second debate: 48.5/44.8.
Carter narrow winner
Carter was a narrow winner of the second debate by
virtue of outpolling Ford among viewers who were not
firmly committed to one candidate or the other.
Carter won the support of 33.5 per cent among uncom
mittedvoterscompared t024.6 percent whopicked Ford.
With each candidate suffering only minor and matching

defections from his own supporters, the 1071 respondents
picked Carter as the winner 38.2 per cent to 34.6 per cent.
Ford's initial edge
Ford had a 34.4 to 31.8 edge in the first debate according
to the previous panel of respondents.
Those who thought Carter won the foreign and defense
policy debate most often cited such style-related reasons
as "more confidence," "more sincere," "better appear
ance."
Those who thought Ford won most often cited reasons
associated with his incumbency, such as "his experience"
and "more knowledgeable."
Carter attacks Ford
Meanwhile, in Salt Lake City. Carter pounded away
yesterday at what he called President Ford's blunder in
saying that Eastern Europe was not under Soviet domina
tion. "He disgraced our country." the Democratic candi
date said.
Escalating his attack at every stop. Carter said in
speeches in San Francisco and again here that he was
"shocked by the insensitivity and lack of knowledge
which Mr. Ford displayed" during their debate Wednes
day night.
In an interview in San Francisco, he declared: "1
thought he (Ford) disgraced our country by claiming that
the Eastern Europeans were free of domination by the
Soviet Union."
Ford's actual remarks were: "There is no Soviet domina
tion of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a
Ford administration."
Said Carter, "That's obviously not true. It was a very
serious blunder for him to say it."
