### Emily Sachar 
The first university-wide
teaching assistant (TA) orienta
tion program will be held today
from 1-6 p.m. at the Center for
Research and Development in
Teaching.
Arranged by the Committee
for Stanford TA Orientation, the
program hopes not only to better
acquaint TAs with the teaching
environment, but also to
familiarize TAs with services
available in the university com

munity, in order that they may
refer students to these facilities.
All TAs on campus were in
vited to the event, and 150 have
registered.
After several public presenta
tions by deans of both graduate
and undergraduate studies, TAs
will attend two selected work
shops out of the seven being of
fered. Among the choices are a
workshop on special needs for
women and minorities, a group
discussing the relationship be

tween TA and students, and
workshops on getting started in
the classroom and on teaching
labs.
TAs conducting the work
shops were either chosen by the
committee or by recommenda
tions from fellow TAs.
"Some of the TAs had been in
volved in other parts of the prog
ram. Also, several faculty mem
bers are leading workshops and
have been interested in educa
tion," said Robert (iriswold.
graduate student in history ahd
member of the committee.
The main thrust for the prog
ram came from the committee in
July. Formal planning and or
ganization have since been in
progress, with a large variety of
people working on the prog
ram's format.
In addition, as a follow-up to
today's program, the committee
plans to conduct a series of one
hour seminars on aspects of
teaching such as the lecture, or
anxietv in the classroom.
