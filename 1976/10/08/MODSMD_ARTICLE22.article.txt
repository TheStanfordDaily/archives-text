There are moments in life
when one longs to hear u voiceof
experience, of age adorned with
wisdom. Being young, one
exults in the drama ol highs and
lows —the stormy seas —but,
paradoxically . one is also drawn
to calmer perspective, often as
sociated with age.
The poetry of this century has
not I«i( ked aged voices. ). Alfred
Prufrock muttered, "I grow old, I
grow old. ..." and worried about
eating peaches (a dental prob
lem?). Yet it's worth keeping in
mind that his creator was then a
graduate student. This is less
funny when one t hi nks about the
signs of premature aging that
can be read in many earnest faces
around the university. It seems
to me that young as well as old
people worry deeply about the
loss of innocence, of childhood.
What is gained from such loss?
The voice that speaks in Janet
Lewis' poetry is serene, wise; the
voice of an old woman whose
age represents a fulfillment, not
.1 betrayal, of the unbounded
dreams of youth. Of course, the
poems she reads on the record in
the series "Stanford Program for
Recordings in Sound" span her
whole life; yet I was particularly
struck by this noble note of age
complimenting youth. She reads
unhurriedly, thoughtfully, and
not without moments of quiet
humor.
As a poet her works are
marked by marvellous simplic
ity and sure musicality, both rare
and difficult qualities. Her
themes are often modest, re
stricted to life's less grandiose
moments. In a fine poem about

the fate of Helen of Troy she ob
serves "No one brings/A tale of
quiet love." This she herself has
done. In "Morning Devotion,"
she sweeps the floor and prays
for:
Ufa lo maintain and to increase
to surround ivilli peace
tike an orchard in sun
Whert> all's activity
Leaf, earth, anil weighted tree.
Yet all resolved in one, one
Airy tmnquility
And ti> maintain my soul

Content in this employ.
To hind despair and joy
Into a stable whole.
The record itself is a good
thing to contemplate. It is one of
a series of readings at Stanford
released as discs through the
energy and imagination of Mike
Stillman, with the support of en
lightened agencies within the
university like the News and
Publication Service. The series
now includes recordings of John

Hawkes. Adrienne Rich. J.V.
Cunningham, and Donald Davie
Ken Fields includes in his
notes a wonderful quote from
Baudelaire: "Modernity is the
transient, the fleeting, the con
tingent: it is one half ot art. the
other being the eternal and the
immovable." That eternal part il
luminates Janet Lewis' art; it
shows us experience consumed
by the varying constant tire ot
imagination.

There are moments in life
when one longs to hear u voiceof
experience, of age adorned with
wisdom. Being young, one
exults in the drama ol highs and
lows —the stormy seas —but,
paradoxically . one is also drawn
to calmer perspective, often as
sociated with age.
The poetry of this century has
not I«i( ked aged voices. ). Alfred
Prufrock muttered, "I grow old, I
grow old. ..." and worried about
eating peaches (a dental prob
lem?). Yet it's worth keeping in
mind that his creator was then a
graduate student. This is less
funny when one t hi nks about the
signs of premature aging that
can be read in many earnest faces
around the university. It seems
to me that young as well as old
people worry deeply about the
loss of innocence, of childhood.
What is gained from such loss?
The voice that speaks in Janet
Lewis' poetry is serene, wise; the
voice of an old woman whose
age represents a fulfillment, not
.1 betrayal, of the unbounded
dreams of youth. Of course, the
poems she reads on the record in
the series "Stanford Program for
Recordings in Sound" span her
whole life; yet I was particularly
struck by this noble note of age
complimenting youth. She reads
unhurriedly, thoughtfully, and
not without moments of quiet
humor.
As a poet her works are
marked by marvellous simplic
ity and sure musicality, both rare
and difficult qualities. Her
themes are often modest, re
stricted to life's less grandiose
moments. In a fine poem about

the fate of Helen of Troy she ob
serves "No one brings/A tale of
quiet love." This she herself has
done. In "Morning Devotion,"
she sweeps the floor and prays
for:
Ufa lo maintain and to increase
