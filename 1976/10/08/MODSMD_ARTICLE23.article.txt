There are a few bad apples in every bushel,
say the nation's farmers and the laws of proba
bility — or you can't judge a bushel by its
cover, as literature's corollary goes.
Stanford literati have recently reaffirmed
these tired truisms with the publication of the
Summer/Autumn edition of their literary
magazine Sequoia — an attractively organized
and admirably diverse collection of some pain
fully low-level products.
An anthology of works by such titled con
tributors as an associate professor of English at
Stanford, three Stegner fellows, two doctoral
candidates in English literature and several
published poets ought to shine in more spots
than diil this one. But the inspiration was, in
fact, "spotty," and the trite use of literary tricks
and poetic devices too forced and frequent.
In a medium as typically compact as poetry
or short story, mustn't every writer demand of
his words a conciseness, a clarity, a power or a
purpose? A tightly knit story or well-woven
poem has no loose threads because its writer
acknowledges and erases all idle detail. An
extraneous sentence in the exposition of a story
such as "Louis was sixty-nine years old, and he
didn't get around as much as he used to, but he

still liked to get out as often as he could," is like
a road block at the end of an access lane. All
direction and momentum are lost, and the
reader is left wondering, "Where am 1 going
now?"
Vet there are redeeming entries in this edi
tion of Sequoia, notably poems by Barbara
Glenn, Dave Barton and Alan Shapiro. The
images they use are compelling, the metaphors
developed, and the word choices pungent; the
resultant works are simultaneously intimate
and immense.
In addition, Dana Gioia contributes a
humorous satire in pointed imitation of "the
early style of Robert Lowell" — inflated verse
characteristic of the young Lowell and his
weakness for obscure mythological references.
But the highlight article in the Sequoia col
lection is an interview with noted fiction wri
ter John Cheever. Long a contributer to New
Yorker and winner of the National Book
Award in 1958 for The Wapshot Chronicle,
Cheever answers questions about his teaching,
his contemporaries — Bellow, Doctorow, Von
negut — and his craft.
There are some "plums," then, in this an
thology of Stanford works, including the il
lustrations of Jill Bullitt and Veronica Sim, but
the balance of the bushel is sadly uninspired
and green.
