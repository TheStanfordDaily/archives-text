### Janet Gendler 
"In publishing, small is not
only beautiful but crucial," said
Winthrop knowlton, president
of Harper & Row. at the recent
Stanford Conference on Publish
ing.
"Publishing uniquely requires
the personal touch, intimacy and
loving attention to detail." Yet
Knowlton continued, "For pub
lishers to survive, we must grow.
The market is no longer grow
ing. ..The larger firms are absorb
ing the smaller ones and moving
aggressively abroad."
Knowlton was one of 31
speakers who addressed the 250
participants during the five day
conference Sept. 1">-19 spon
sored by the Stanford Alumni
Association. Among the other
speakers were writers Jessa
myn West, Allen Drury, Scott
Momaday and lames Clavell;
editors (ack Nessel of New West,
William Abrahams of Atlantic
Monthly and John Allen of
Header's Digest; and publishing
executives Knowlton and Gil
bert Grosvenor, vice-president of
National Geographic.
Case studies on publications
such as National Geographic's
new children's magazine World
alternated with lectures like
Doubleday vice-president Alex
Hoffman's discussion of the new
copyright bill.
Richard Huttner, editor-in
chief of Fawcett Gold Medal
Books, encouraged writers with
the news that one out of 10.000
manuscripts submitted to pub
lishers and agents will become a
bestseller.
In spite of the competitive
market and a variety of economic
problems, Julian Muller, vice
president of Harcourt Brace
Jovonavich Inc., reminded
ences "Books exist on an
economic base that owes no
thing so far to advertising or
other outside forces that influ
ence virtually every other area of
communication."
Muller listed other advantages
that books have over other
media. "They can be read at the
reader's own choice of time and
at the reader's own pace. They
can be interrupted and taken up

again. They can be transported
easily. They do not blow fuses,
wear out or require maintenance
or adjustment "
According to Joni Miller, as
sistant to the general merchan
dise manager for Walden Books,
people are buying more books
than ever before. The Bay Area
and Los Angeles combined rep
resent the largest book buying
market in the nation.
I'eople who are buying books
in the supermarkets never went
into bookstores. The majority of
customers in the chain
bookstores are not people who
spend much time reading book
reviews. Miller said.
Media coverage
Although Miller said she was
"a chronic critic of the overall
tool for booksellers," she em
phasized the importance of good
media coverage. To illustrate her
point she described how TM.
Discovering Inner Energy and
Overcoming Stress became an
overnight bestseller after author
Bloomfield and the Maharishi
appeared on Merv Griffin.
Throughout the conference it
was evident that The New York
Times Book Review reviews ap
proximately one out often books
it receives.
"I have gotten so 1 pretty well
skim book reviews." said author
Allen Drury. He went on to say.
"Of course, if the guy likes it and
raves about it, that's marvelous,
and if he doesn't, he is a bleep."
Reviews today
More seriously Drury com
mented. "There are very few re
viewers nowadays who write in
the sense of being constructive.
They are either destructive or ex
tremely laudatory. Many of the

reviewers do not write about
books as books."
lames ('lavel 1 agreed that au
thors should not take reviewers
too seriously. "A reviewer can
really attack you. What we do is
sort of creative, so you're naked
in public, because you are writ
ing your version of everything,
your version of making love or
killing or family life."
"Talent is helpful to a writer
but guts and brass are absolutely
indispensat)le."said Jessamyn
West. "There are no shy. retiring
writers. Anyone who believes
his thoughts, his imaginings, his
dubious fabrications are of suffi
cient interest to readers to cause
them to put cash on the bar
relhead for the privilege of read
ing them, that man or woman is
obv iou s1 y brass-1 i ned."
West said she always knew
she wanted to be a writer. How
ever. as a good Quaker girl grow
ing up in Southern California
she had never encountered any
of that wild species. "I believed
all writers were long dead and
that they all looked like Alfred
Lord Tennyson, George Gordon
or Lord Byron."
West started keeping a writer's
notebook when she was 14 but
she did not begin to write seri
ously until she was recovering
from tuberculosis several years
later. More time elapsed before
she dared to publish her work.
West's husband, Max McPher
son, offered to pay a publisher to
print her stories in a little book
which she could give to her
friends. West retorted, "You are
a teacher. What if you could not
find a job and 1 was a millionaire
and 1 could hire kids for you to
teach. Would you like that?"
