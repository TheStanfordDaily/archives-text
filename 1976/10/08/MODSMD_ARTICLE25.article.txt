# Lyman makes impressive showing

"The President and Mrs.
Lyman did their usual fine sel
ling job of one of the greatest in
stitutions in the world," accord
ing to Ralph Davidson, pub
lisher of Time, commenting on
President Richard Lyman's per
formanceat theTime Leadership
Conference 1976, at the
Washington Hilton Hotel in the
District of Columbia.
Lyman was keynote speaker at
the luncheon conference on
Monday, Sept. 27. He was pre
ceded by Sunday keynoters
Walter Mondale, Minnesota
senator and Democratic vice
presidential candidate, and Sen.
Robert Griffin of Michigan, se
nate minority whip. His talk was
followed by one delivered Mon
day night by William Coleman,
secretary of transportation
"He was by far the outstanding
of the four." said Davidson, who
was president of the Stanford
Alumni Association during the
1972 to 1973 term. "The reaction
to his speech couldn't have been

better; it was an excellent reac
tion."
The main theme of Lyman's
presentation was that many of
today's problems are not being
solved because they are being
submitted to the inappropriate
institutions for solutions.
Pervasive unwillingness
"What is at issue, it seems to
me," said Lyman, "is a pervasive
unwillingness to take the time
and trouble to understand the
institutions we have developed
and must work with and'
through, and their inherent limi
tations. with which leaders must
come to terms."
He added, "Not only is more
expected, but responses to al
most any problem are sought
from almost any institution. No
longer do people look to busi
ness to solve business problems*
educational institutions to solve
educational problems and so
forth. Any organization, pro
vided it's large enough to be vis
ible and to be suspected of hav
ing disposable assets under its
control, is asked to solve any
problem, however irrelevant to
its mission, experience or capac
ity."
As a result, said Lyman, "the
cycle is plain: an institution,
asked to perform a service it is
not equipped to perform, re
sponds ineptly; the ineptitude is
not seen as the predictable result
of a misdirected request, but of
the incompetence, or worse, of

the institution and its leader
ship."
Scapegoating leadership
Regarding the inability of in
stitutions to solve problems they
are not equipped to handle,
Lyman said. "Scapegoating
leadership becomes a much
easier way of explaining any in
stitutional failures or shortcom
ings than serious attention to
what the institution is being
asked to do, and how well
adapted it is to doing it,"
Lyman remarked further on
the vicissitudes of leadership,
saying, "We are in danger of
coming to believe that no one
can be trusted to speak of moral
issues or enlist moral energies
unless he or she owns nothing,
carries no organizational re
sponsibilities, possesses no au
thority of office or status — in
short, is untrained and inexperi
enced at coping with moral
problems in public life."
He continued, "If the only
leadership we as a people will
dignify with our trust is a leader
ship of saints and saviours, it re
quires no gifts of prophecy to
suggest that we are in for some
tough times indeed."
Coro Foundation
Lyman also included in his
remarks a call for the expansion
of leadership programs such as
the Coro Foundation's Public Af
fairs Internship Program, which
has provided "a year-long op

portunity to have a diversity of
working experience, among a
wide variety of institutions" for
selected young people and
which "has now introduced a
series of similar but shorter in
ternships for women over 30,
many of whom have been tradi
tional housewives and volun
teers, to stimulate their self
confidence for taking leadership
roles in public service."
Said Lyman,"A hundred .Coro'
Foundations around the country
would not be too many."
On the role of non-politicians
in politics, the president noted.
"All of us must be willing to take
some risks by stepping outside
familiar territory and playing
our part in the political life ol the
country, not necessarily by run
ning for office, but by helping to
restore the standing of those who
do."
As for the role of academics
specifically, he said, "Surely
some of the responsibility
should fall on us educators; we
must put some content into all
our endless mouthings about the
glories of a liberal education and

the dangers of premature
specialization and profes
sionalism."
Bicentennial
Lyman's speech had a strong
Bicentennial flavor, including
references to Thomas Jefferson,
Michel Crevecoeur (who is fam
ous for asking, "What then is the
American, this New Man?")and
Sam Adams. And, as befits a
speaker who is also a professor of
English history, the presentation
included references to and
quotes from William Gladstone,
Walter Bagehot and Thomas
Macaulay.
The Time Leadership Confer
ence 1976 grew out of a special
issue of Time (July 15. 1974)
featuring 200 young American
leaders, including Lyman, ac
cording to Melinda 1 luwe, assis
tant director for University Rela
tions.
Davidson said that (he confer
ence will be reported on in Time
"in a couple of weeks." He said
he thought the conference was
"a hell of a good mental exer
cise" and "a superb symposium
on an illusive subject."

series of similar but shorter in
ternships for women over 30,
many of whom have been tradi
tional housewives and volun
teers, to stimulate their self
confidence for taking leadership
roles in public service."
Said Lyman,"A hundred .Coro'
Foundations around the country
would not be too many."
On the role of non-politicians
in politics, the president noted.
"All of us must be willing to take
some risks by stepping outside
familiar territory and playing
our part in the political life ol the
country, not necessarily by run
ning for office, but by helping to
restore the standing of those who
do."
As for the role of academics
specifically, he said, "Surely
some of the responsibility
should fall on us educators; we
must put some content into all
our endless mouthings about the
glories of a liberal education and

the dangers of premature
specialization and profes
sionalism."
Bicentennial
Lyman's speech had a strong
Bicentennial flavor, including
references to Thomas Jefferson,
Michel Crevecoeur (who is fam
ous for asking, "What then is the
American, this New Man?")and
Sam Adams. And, as befits a
speaker who is also a professor of
English history, the presentation
included references to and
quotes from William Gladstone,
Walter Bagehot and Thomas
Macaulay.
The Time Leadership Confer
ence 1976 grew out of a special
issue of Time (July 15. 1974)
featuring 200 young American
leaders, including Lyman, ac
cording to Melinda 1 luwe, assis
tant director for University Rela
tions.
Davidson said that (he confer
ence will be reported on in Time
"in a couple of weeks." He said
he thought the conference was
"a hell of a good mental exer
cise" and "a superb symposium
on an illusive subject."

"The President and Mrs.
Lyman did their usual fine sel
ling job of one of the greatest in
stitutions in the world," accord
ing to Ralph Davidson, pub
lisher of Time, commenting on
President Richard Lyman's per
formanceat theTime Leadership
Conference 1976, at the
Washington Hilton Hotel in the
District of Columbia.
Lyman was keynote speaker at
the luncheon conference on
Monday, Sept. 27. He was pre
ceded by Sunday keynoters
Walter Mondale, Minnesota
senator and Democratic vice
presidential candidate, and Sen.
Robert Griffin of Michigan, se
nate minority whip. His talk was
followed by one delivered Mon
day night by William Coleman,
secretary of transportation
"He was by far the outstanding
of the four." said Davidson, who
was president of the Stanford
Alumni Association during the
1972 to 1973 term. "The reaction
to his speech couldn't have been

better; it was an excellent reac
tion."
The main theme of Lyman's
presentation was that many of
today's problems are not being
solved because they are being
submitted to the inappropriate
institutions for solutions.
Pervasive unwillingness
"What is at issue, it seems to
me," said Lyman, "is a pervasive
unwillingness to take the time
and trouble to understand the
institutions we have developed
and must work with and'
through, and their inherent limi
tations. with which leaders must
come to terms."
He added, "Not only is more
expected, but responses to al
most any problem are sought
from almost any institution. No
longer do people look to busi
ness to solve business problems*
educational institutions to solve
educational problems and so
forth. Any organization, pro
vided it's large enough to be vis
ible and to be suspected of hav
ing disposable assets under its
control, is asked to solve any
problem, however irrelevant to
its mission, experience or capac
ity."
As a result, said Lyman, "the
cycle is plain: an institution,
asked to perform a service it is
not equipped to perform, re
sponds ineptly; the ineptitude is
not seen as the predictable result
of a misdirected request, but of
the incompetence, or worse, of

the institution and its leader
ship."
Scapegoating leadership
Regarding the inability of in
stitutions to solve problems they
are not equipped to handle,
Lyman said. "Scapegoating
leadership becomes a much
easier way of explaining any in
stitutional failures or shortcom
ings than serious attention to
what the institution is being
asked to do, and how well
adapted it is to doing it,"
Lyman remarked further on
the vicissitudes of leadership,
saying, "We are in danger of
coming to believe that no one
can be trusted to speak of moral
issues or enlist moral energies
unless he or she owns nothing,
carries no organizational re
sponsibilities, possesses no au
thority of office or status — in
short, is untrained and inexperi
enced at coping with moral
problems in public life."
He continued, "If the only
leadership we as a people will
dignify with our trust is a leader
ship of saints and saviours, it re
quires no gifts of prophecy to
suggest that we are in for some
tough times indeed."
Coro Foundation
Lyman also included in his
remarks a call for the expansion
of leadership programs such as
the Coro Foundation's Public Af
fairs Internship Program, which
has provided "a year-long op

portunity to have a diversity of
working experience, among a
wide variety of institutions" for
selected young people and
which "has now introduced a
series of similar but shorter in
ternships for women over 30,
many of whom have been tradi
tional housewives and volun
teers, to stimulate their self
confidence for taking leadership
roles in public service."

vided it's large enough to be vis
ible and to be suspected of hav
ing disposable assets under its
control, is asked to solve any
problem, however irrelevant to
its mission, experience or capac
ity."
As a result, said Lyman, "the
cycle is plain: an institution,
asked to perform a service it is
not equipped to perform, re
sponds ineptly; the ineptitude is
not seen as the predictable result
of a misdirected request, but of
the incompetence, or worse, of

the institution and its leader
ship."
Scapegoating leadership
Regarding the inability of in
stitutions to solve problems they
are not equipped to handle,
Lyman said. "Scapegoating
leadership becomes a much
easier way of explaining any in
stitutional failures or shortcom
ings than serious attention to
what the institution is being
asked to do, and how well
adapted it is to doing it,"
Lyman remarked further on
the vicissitudes of leadership,
saying, "We are in danger of
coming to believe that no one
can be trusted to speak of moral
issues or enlist moral energies
unless he or she owns nothing,
carries no organizational re
sponsibilities, possesses no au
thority of office or status — in
short, is untrained and inexperi
enced at coping with moral
problems in public life."
He continued, "If the only
leadership we as a people will
dignify with our trust is a leader
ship of saints and saviours, it re
quires no gifts of prophecy to
suggest that we are in for some
tough times indeed."
Coro Foundation
Lyman also included in his
remarks a call for the expansion
of leadership programs such as
the Coro Foundation's Public Af
fairs Internship Program, which
has provided "a year-long op

portunity to have a diversity of
working experience, among a
wide variety of institutions" for
selected young people and
which "has now introduced a
series of similar but shorter in
ternships for women over 30,
many of whom have been tradi
tional housewives and volun
teers, to stimulate their self
confidence for taking leadership
roles in public service."
Said Lyman,"A hundred .Coro'
Foundations around the country
would not be too many."
On the role of non-politicians
in politics, the president noted.
"All of us must be willing to take
some risks by stepping outside
familiar territory and playing
our part in the political life ol the
country, not necessarily by run
ning for office, but by helping to
restore the standing of those who
do."
As for the role of academics
specifically, he said, "Surely
some of the responsibility
should fall on us educators; we
must put some content into all
our endless mouthings about the
glories of a liberal education and

the dangers of premature
specialization and profes
sionalism."
Bicentennial
Lyman's speech had a strong
Bicentennial flavor, including
references to Thomas Jefferson,
Michel Crevecoeur (who is fam
ous for asking, "What then is the
American, this New Man?")and
Sam Adams. And, as befits a
speaker who is also a professor of
English history, the presentation
included references to and
quotes from William Gladstone,
Walter Bagehot and Thomas
Macaulay.
The Time Leadership Confer
ence 1976 grew out of a special
issue of Time (July 15. 1974)
featuring 200 young American
leaders, including Lyman, ac
cording to Melinda 1 luwe, assis
tant director for University Rela
tions.
Davidson said that (he confer
ence will be reported on in Time
"in a couple of weeks." He said
he thought the conference was
"a hell of a good mental exer
cise" and "a superb symposium
on an illusive subject."

"The President and Mrs.
Lyman did their usual fine sel
ling job of one of the greatest in
stitutions in the world," accord
ing to Ralph Davidson, pub
lisher of Time, commenting on
President Richard Lyman's per
formanceat theTime Leadership
Conference 1976, at the
Washington Hilton Hotel in the
District of Columbia.
Lyman was keynote speaker at
the luncheon conference on
Monday, Sept. 27. He was pre
ceded by Sunday keynoters
Walter Mondale, Minnesota
senator and Democratic vice
presidential candidate, and Sen.
Robert Griffin of Michigan, se
nate minority whip. His talk was
followed by one delivered Mon
day night by William Coleman,
secretary of transportation
"He was by far the outstanding
of the four." said Davidson, who
was president of the Stanford
Alumni Association during the
1972 to 1973 term. "The reaction
to his speech couldn't have been

better; it was an excellent reac
tion."
The main theme of Lyman's
presentation was that many of
today's problems are not being
solved because they are being
submitted to the inappropriate
institutions for solutions.
Pervasive unwillingness
"What is at issue, it seems to
me," said Lyman, "is a pervasive
unwillingness to take the time
and trouble to understand the
institutions we have developed
and must work with and'
through, and their inherent limi
tations. with which leaders must
come to terms."
He added, "Not only is more
expected, but responses to al
most any problem are sought
from almost any institution. No
longer do people look to busi
ness to solve business problems*
educational institutions to solve
educational problems and so
forth. Any organization, pro
vided it's large enough to be vis
ible and to be suspected of hav
ing disposable assets under its
control, is asked to solve any
problem, however irrelevant to
its mission, experience or capac
ity."
