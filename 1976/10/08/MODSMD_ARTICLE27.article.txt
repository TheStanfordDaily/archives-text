# Adventure to Morocco -in five courses
## 
### Nancy Wilson 
Cafe Moroc is a Moroccan adventure.
The white, bare walls on the exterior give
no hint of what is to come. As you walk
in, you notice about 10 tables, all very
close to the ground. Along the walls runs
a pillow-covered bench which is higher
than the tables. As you're taken to your
table, you are encouraged to grab ser
eral pillows and sit on the floor.
The decor is very simple: reddish
material hanging tent-like across the
ceiling with chandelier lighting (the
french influence); the walls in blue, the
pillows covered in velvet. Inthecenterof
the room stands a table with Moroccan
pots and dishes, all very simply done.
Then notice the music, and throughout
dinner, notice the beautiful china on
which the meals are served.
The menu offers a five-course dinner,
with a choice, only, of entrees. Though
when 1 thought of how little 1 knew of
Moroccan food, I realized that any
further choice would onlv have led to

indecision. Once you've decided on your
entree, the feast begins.
First the waiter brings a pot of water
<ind a towel (which doubles as a napkin)
to wash your hands. The first course is
harira (soup) and when it comes in a
bowl you immediately realize you have
neither spoon, nor fork, nor knife; only
pita bread for soaking up some of the
soup. So you drink from the side of the
bowl. The harira is spicy, warm and
hearty, with some pieces of vegetables
and a few garbanzo beans.
The soup finished, a Moroccan salad is
served. It comes on one plate for two
people, with cold eggplant in the center
and cold, marinated tomatoes along the
outside. It is also eaten with your hands,
as is the rest of the meal. Both eggplant
and tomatoes are mild, but flavorful.
Possibly the best part of the whole
dinner was course number three, the pas
tilla. This is a mixture of chicken, egg and
crushed almonds wrapped in light, flaky
filo dough and topped with powdered

sugar. It comes fresh from the oven, so is
extremely hot.
Here comes the advantage of eating
with your hands — if you remember not
to pop into your mouth anything too hot
to touch with your fingers, you won't
burn your tongue. Eat the pastil la slowly
to allow it to cool, to really enjoy the
flavor and to avoid getting too full too
fast.
Out of about a dozen choices, we or
dered entrees of lamb with honey and the
cous-cous. Each portion covered a whole
dinner plate and so afforded plenty of
time for enjoyment. The lamb dish had at
least four large chunks of lamb, steaming
hot, covered with a honey sauce and
plenty of whole almonds. It was a sweet
dish, but very good and pleasing to al
most anyone.
The cous-cous was a pile of many good
things. At the bottom is a rice-like bed
ding, then a large portion of beef.
Around the beef are pieces of cooked
vegetables and on top aregarbanzo beans

and plumped raisins. The combination
of flavors is divine.
Thinking ourselves reasonably stuf
fed, we were then treated to samples of
two other entrees, as well as a very dry
white wine, Muscadet. suitable for these
dishes. One dish was chicken with
lemon sauce and the other was rabbit
with paprika. I tried the chicken first and
found it a remarkable contrast to the
lamb and cous-cous. It had a much drier,
subtler flavor, but elegant. Finally, I got
up the courage to try the rabbit and was
pleasantly surprised. The paprika sauce
lent it a milk flavor, somewhat like fowl,
but not greasy nor too rich.
Once we'd done justice to our four en
trees. we were served a sweet, warm mint
tea and allowed to wash our hands again.
The five course dinner costs $8.50 per
person. So two dinners, with wine and
tax will come to about $23. It is certainly
a different evening. Extravagant, maybe,
but well worth repeating.

found it a remarkable contrast to the
lamb and cous-cous. It had a much drier,
subtler flavor, but elegant. Finally, I got
up the courage to try the rabbit and was
pleasantly surprised. The paprika sauce
lent it a milk flavor, somewhat like fowl,
but not greasy nor too rich.
Once we'd done justice to our four en
trees. we were served a sweet, warm mint
tea and allowed to wash our hands again.
The five course dinner costs $8.50 per
person. So two dinners, with wine and
tax will come to about $23. It is certainly
a different evening. Extravagant, maybe,
but well worth repeating.

Cafe Maroc's interior
Cafe Moroc is a Moroccan adventure.
The white, bare walls on the exterior give
no hint of what is to come. As you walk
in, you notice about 10 tables, all very
close to the ground. Along the walls runs
a pillow-covered bench which is higher
than the tables. As you're taken to your
table, you are encouraged to grab ser
eral pillows and sit on the floor.
The decor is very simple: reddish
material hanging tent-like across the
ceiling with chandelier lighting (the
french influence); the walls in blue, the
pillows covered in velvet. Inthecenterof
the room stands a table with Moroccan
pots and dishes, all very simply done.
Then notice the music, and throughout
dinner, notice the beautiful china on
which the meals are served.
The menu offers a five-course dinner,
with a choice, only, of entrees. Though
when 1 thought of how little 1 knew of
Moroccan food, I realized that any
further choice would onlv have led to

indecision. Once you've decided on your
entree, the feast begins.
First the waiter brings a pot of water
<ind a towel (which doubles as a napkin)
to wash your hands. The first course is
harira (soup) and when it comes in a
bowl you immediately realize you have
neither spoon, nor fork, nor knife; only
pita bread for soaking up some of the
soup. So you drink from the side of the
bowl. The harira is spicy, warm and
hearty, with some pieces of vegetables
and a few garbanzo beans.
The soup finished, a Moroccan salad is
served. It comes on one plate for two
people, with cold eggplant in the center
and cold, marinated tomatoes along the
outside. It is also eaten with your hands,
as is the rest of the meal. Both eggplant
and tomatoes are mild, but flavorful.
Possibly the best part of the whole
dinner was course number three, the pas
tilla. This is a mixture of chicken, egg and
crushed almonds wrapped in light, flaky
filo dough and topped with powdered

sugar. It comes fresh from the oven, so is
extremely hot.
Here comes the advantage of eating
with your hands — if you remember not
to pop into your mouth anything too hot
to touch with your fingers, you won't
burn your tongue. Eat the pastil la slowly
to allow it to cool, to really enjoy the
flavor and to avoid getting too full too
fast.
Out of about a dozen choices, we or
dered entrees of lamb with honey and the
cous-cous. Each portion covered a whole
dinner plate and so afforded plenty of
time for enjoyment. The lamb dish had at
least four large chunks of lamb, steaming
hot, covered with a honey sauce and
plenty of whole almonds. It was a sweet
dish, but very good and pleasing to al
most anyone.
The cous-cous was a pile of many good
things. At the bottom is a rice-like bed
ding, then a large portion of beef.
Around the beef are pieces of cooked
vegetables and on top aregarbanzo beans

and plumped raisins. The combination
of flavors is divine.
Thinking ourselves reasonably stuf
fed, we were then treated to samples of
two other entrees, as well as a very dry
white wine, Muscadet. suitable for these
dishes. One dish was chicken with
lemon sauce and the other was rabbit
with paprika. I tried the chicken first and
found it a remarkable contrast to the
lamb and cous-cous. It had a much drier,
subtler flavor, but elegant. Finally, I got
up the courage to try the rabbit and was
pleasantly surprised. The paprika sauce
