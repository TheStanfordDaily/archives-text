## Cards face injured Bruins in Pac-8 opener Oddsmakers install UCLA as 16-point favorite 
### David Georgette 
Saratoga (1777), Gettysburg
(1863) and Midway (1942) —
these are all names from Ameri
ca's military past, all confronta
tions in which the side with the
upper hand was halted, and, as
sage Don Meredith might say.
"Mo Mentum has changed
sides."
Tomorrow night in the Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the
Stanford Cardinals have a
chance to pull off their own ver
sion of Saratoga, ala 1976,
against the unbeaten and third
ranked UCLA Bruins in both
teams' Pacific-8 conference
opener.
The Bruins (3-0-1) have been
nothing less than awesome in
their first four games, destroying
the top powers of the Western
Athletic Conference, shooting
down Air Force and tying Ohio
State in Woody Hayes' Colum
bus playground.
UCLA tough
So it looks as if UCLA, a team
the pre-season polls picked
fourth,has everything going its
way.
And what reasons are there to
think that a team which has won
only one game this year, while
the rest of the time showing its
ability to give away points,to get
blown out of a game before half,
and to lose a twenty-point lead,
could stop a runaway veer ex
press?
UCLA coach Terry Donahue
has a few reasons. "The hardest
thing to evaluate about Stanford
is their 1-3 won-loss record,"
said Donahue. "We think Stan
ford is much better than this in
dicates." Donahue said the
Cards "can throw the ball any
time they like, and move the
football against any team they
want."

If he's healthy. Guy Benjamin
will be the man tossing the
pigskin into the Bruin secon
dary. However, he better be care
ful. because according to Card
coach Jack Christiansen, the
Bruins "double-cover the out
side receivers."
Chris said the Cards hope to
"get the ball to one of the backs
or the tight end." And they
should be open, because
Donahue said UCLA will, "give
up the short completions, make
them work the length of the
field, and hopefully not give up
the big bomb."
A key to whether theCards can
move the ball against the Bruins
should be the play of the offen
sive line. Injuries to guards Ram
sey Blackburn, lost for the sea
son with knee surgery, and A 1
Tenßruggencate, hampered by
an injured knee, have forced a
reshuffling of the line.
Injuries
Center Mark Hill has moved
over to guard and Dan McCann
has taken over at center. The
Bruins' aggressiveness on de
fense should not be a problem for
the Cards, said tackle Gordon
King, because "we have an ag
gressive line ourselves."
On offense, then, it seems that
Stanford will be able to hold its
own. But how can a team which
has allowed 27.5 points a contest
possibly stop halfbacks Wendell
Tyler, Theotis Brown, and quar
terback Jeff Dankworth? The
Bruin backfield has led the
squad to almost 29 points a
game. Certainly, the Stanford
coaches must have something
up their sleeves!
No, said Christiansen, "we
don't plan anything special." To
stop the veer, he said, the defen
ders must "defeat the blocker
and make the tackle." Chris said

the Cards will try to shut off the
dive play and make the Bruins
pitch wide where they tend to
fumble.
'New experience'
Donahue said Stanford's 4-3
defense scares him. And he said
it will be a "brand new experi
ence" for his offense against
what he termed a "starting de
fensive unit with excellent abil
ity."
"An injury situation quite a bit
different than anticipated."
could.plaguethe Bruins. Flanker
Wallv "Hollywood" Henry is a
"very doubtful starter" because
of headaches from a concussion
suffered last week. Brown has a
hip pointer and Donahue said it
is not known whether he will be
able to play.
There is another factor to be
considered before playing "All
Right Now." In its last seven
trips to the Coliseum. Stanford
has always performed at its peak.
"Flaying in the Coliseum al
ways makes for a good game."
said defensive end Duncan
McColl. "Traditionally we play
well as a team down there." In
1974, UCLA tied Stanford 13-13
on a last-play field goal and last
year Mike Langford kicked the
Cards to victory over USC in the
Coliseum.
Despite all these reasons for
optimism, though, let's be realis
tic. UCLA is first in Pac-8 team
defense and first in rushing.
What chance do the Cards have
against the Bruins?
What chance did 13 colonies
have against the British Empire?
Cardinal notes: Wide receiv
ers Tony Hill and Bill kellar,
both slowed by injuries, are
listed as starters. . .Christiansen
is 0-3-1 against UCLA. . .Stan

was 20-9 in 1971.

State in Woody Hayes' Colum
bus playground.
UCLA tough
So it looks as if UCLA, a team
the pre-season polls picked
fourth,has everything going its
way.
And what reasons are there to
think that a team which has won
only one game this year, while
the rest of the time showing its
ability to give away points,to get
blown out of a game before half,
and to lose a twenty-point lead,
could stop a runaway veer ex
press?
UCLA coach Terry Donahue
has a few reasons. "The hardest
thing to evaluate about Stanford
is their 1-3 won-loss record,"
said Donahue. "We think Stan
ford is much better than this in
dicates." Donahue said the
Cards "can throw the ball any
time they like, and move the
football against any team they
want."

If he's healthy. Guy Benjamin
will be the man tossing the
pigskin into the Bruin secon
dary. However, he better be care
ful. because according to Card
coach Jack Christiansen, the
Bruins "double-cover the out
side receivers."
Chris said the Cards hope to
"get the ball to one of the backs
or the tight end." And they
should be open, because
Donahue said UCLA will, "give
up the short completions, make
them work the length of the
field, and hopefully not give up
the big bomb."
A key to whether theCards can
move the ball against the Bruins
should be the play of the offen
sive line. Injuries to guards Ram
sey Blackburn, lost for the sea
son with knee surgery, and A 1
Tenßruggencate, hampered by
an injured knee, have forced a
reshuffling of the line.
Injuries
Center Mark Hill has moved
over to guard and Dan McCann
has taken over at center. The
Bruins' aggressiveness on de
fense should not be a problem for
the Cards, said tackle Gordon
King, because "we have an ag
gressive line ourselves."
On offense, then, it seems that
Stanford will be able to hold its
own. But how can a team which
has allowed 27.5 points a contest
possibly stop halfbacks Wendell
Tyler, Theotis Brown, and quar
terback Jeff Dankworth? The
Bruin backfield has led the
squad to almost 29 points a
game. Certainly, the Stanford
coaches must have something
up their sleeves!
No, said Christiansen, "we
don't plan anything special." To
stop the veer, he said, the defen
ders must "defeat the blocker
and make the tackle." Chris said

the Cards will try to shut off the
dive play and make the Bruins
pitch wide where they tend to
fumble.
'New experience'
Donahue said Stanford's 4-3
defense scares him. And he said
it will be a "brand new experi
ence" for his offense against
what he termed a "starting de
fensive unit with excellent abil
ity."
"An injury situation quite a bit
different than anticipated."
could.plaguethe Bruins. Flanker
Wallv "Hollywood" Henry is a
"very doubtful starter" because
of headaches from a concussion
suffered last week. Brown has a
hip pointer and Donahue said it
is not known whether he will be
able to play.
There is another factor to be
considered before playing "All
Right Now." In its last seven
trips to the Coliseum. Stanford
has always performed at its peak.
"Flaying in the Coliseum al
ways makes for a good game."
said defensive end Duncan
McColl. "Traditionally we play
well as a team down there." In
1974, UCLA tied Stanford 13-13
on a last-play field goal and last
year Mike Langford kicked the
Cards to victory over USC in the
Coliseum.
Despite all these reasons for
optimism, though, let's be realis
tic. UCLA is first in Pac-8 team
defense and first in rushing.
What chance do the Cards have
against the Bruins?
What chance did 13 colonies
have against the British Empire?

If he's healthy. Guy Benjamin
will be the man tossing the
pigskin into the Bruin secon
dary. However, he better be care
ful. because according to Card
coach Jack Christiansen, the
Bruins "double-cover the out
side receivers."
Chris said the Cards hope to
"get the ball to one of the backs
or the tight end." And they
should be open, because
Donahue said UCLA will, "give
up the short completions, make
them work the length of the
field, and hopefully not give up
the big bomb."
A key to whether theCards can
move the ball against the Bruins
should be the play of the offen
sive line. Injuries to guards Ram
sey Blackburn, lost for the sea
son with knee surgery, and A 1
Tenßruggencate, hampered by
an injured knee, have forced a
reshuffling of the line.
Injuries
Center Mark Hill has moved
over to guard and Dan McCann
has taken over at center. The
Bruins' aggressiveness on de
fense should not be a problem for
the Cards, said tackle Gordon
King, because "we have an ag
gressive line ourselves."
On offense, then, it seems that
Stanford will be able to hold its
own. But how can a team which
has allowed 27.5 points a contest
possibly stop halfbacks Wendell
Tyler, Theotis Brown, and quar
terback Jeff Dankworth? The
Bruin backfield has led the
squad to almost 29 points a
game. Certainly, the Stanford
coaches must have something
up their sleeves!
No, said Christiansen, "we
don't plan anything special." To
stop the veer, he said, the defen
ders must "defeat the blocker
and make the tackle." Chris said

the Cards will try to shut off the
dive play and make the Bruins
pitch wide where they tend to
fumble.
'New experience'
Donahue said Stanford's 4-3
defense scares him. And he said
it will be a "brand new experi
ence" for his offense against
what he termed a "starting de
fensive unit with excellent abil
ity."
"An injury situation quite a bit
different than anticipated."

Wallv "Hollywood" Henry is a
"very doubtful starter" because
of headaches from a concussion

There is another factor to be

Right Now." In its last seven

McColl. "Traditionally we play

on a last-play field goal and last
year Mike Langford kicked the
Cards to victory over USC in the
Coliseum.
Despite all these reasons for
optimism, though, let's be realis
tic. UCLA is first in Pac-8 team
defense and first in rushing.
What chance do the Cards have
against the Bruins?

Saratoga (1777), Gettysburg
(1863) and Midway (1942) —
these are all names from Ameri
ca's military past, all confronta
tions in which the side with the
upper hand was halted, and, as
sage Don Meredith might say.
"Mo Mentum has changed
sides."
Tomorrow night in the Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the
Stanford Cardinals have a
chance to pull off their own ver
sion of Saratoga, ala 1976,
against the unbeaten and third
ranked UCLA Bruins in both
teams' Pacific-8 conference
opener.
The Bruins (3-0-1) have been
nothing less than awesome in
their first four games, destroying
the top powers of the Western
Athletic Conference, shooting
down Air Force and tying Ohio
State in Woody Hayes' Colum
bus playground.
UCLA tough
So it looks as if UCLA, a team
the pre-season polls picked
fourth,has everything going its
way.
And what reasons are there to
think that a team which has won
only one game this year, while
the rest of the time showing its
ability to give away points,to get
blown out of a game before half,
and to lose a twenty-point lead,
could stop a runaway veer ex
press?
UCLA coach Terry Donahue
has a few reasons. "The hardest
thing to evaluate about Stanford
is their 1-3 won-loss record,"
said Donahue. "We think Stan
ford is much better than this in
dicates." Donahue said the
Cards "can throw the ball any
time they like, and move the
football against any team they
want."
