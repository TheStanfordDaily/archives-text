# UCLA quarterback an offensive threat
## Dankworth silences critics 
### Chris Baker 
When first-year IJCLA coach
Terry Donahue said that his
Bruins would pass more this
year, many UCLA fans assumed
that it was just Donahue's tactful
way of telling quarterback Jeff
Dankworth that he would spend
his final year in Westwood re
turning punts.
After all, everyone knew that
quarterback Steve Bukich had
the best arm on the team.
Everyone, that is, except
Da nk worth.
"The press played up our
quarterback thing this summer,"
said Dankworth. "I knew coach
Donahue wasn't going to alter
nate his quarterbacks.
Pressure
"1 knew how good I was. I
worked just behind (former
Bruin quarterback) John Sciarra
last year. Having someone push

ing me this year just kept the
pressure on."
Dankworth, who has com
pleted 19 of 31 passes for 241
yards this year, said, "People
don't know how well I can pass. I
think I'm a better passer than
people give me credit for."
But it is Dankworth's ability
on the ground that has the Stan
ford defense worried. The
6-foot-l. 209-pound quarterback
has taught opponents' defenses
that they can't key on halfbacks
Wendell Tyler and Theotis
Brown. Dankworth is the sixth
leading rusher in the I'ac-8 with
315 yards.
Veer
"Coach Donahue told me early
in the season that he thought de
fenses would key on Wendell.
The veer is the type of offense
which lets any back have a good
game."

And he's making Bruin fans
forget Sciarra. A lot of people
thought Sciarra was the only
quarterback able to direct UC
LA's veer offense. "The key to
running the veer is experience,"
said Dankworth. "I started three
games when John was injured
two years ago, but I'm still learn
ing every day.
"I've got to do something
about fumbles," said
Dankworth "I'm the leading
fumbler on the team. But the veer
is the kind of offense that im
proves as the season goes
along."
The Los Angeles press has
been hard on the Bruins for settl
ing for a 10-10 tie with Ohio
State last weekend. Many
thought UCLA shouldn't have
punted the ball in the last three
minutes of the contest.
"Ohio State tied us. They had

to come back to do it," said
Dankvvorth. "We were playing
sound football. The Buckeyes
didn't have the confidence to go
for it."
Last year UCLA totally ig
nored Ohio State to prepare for
the conference opener with
Stanford. "We went into last
week's game, from a team
standpoint, thinking more about
Stanford." said Dankworth.
"We've been thinking about
Stanford for the last two weeks.
"Hut we didn't do what we did
last year, and start practicing for
Stanford the week of the Ohio
State game," said Dankworth.
"The coaches last year thought
we didn't have a chance against
the Buckeyes. And that bugged
the players."
Stanford important
Dankworth said that even
though UCLA is playing Stan
ford, a team which has won only
one game, it is a more important
contest than the Bruins'two na
tionally televised games.
"Everyone knows that to lose
to Stanford, or any other confer
ence team, will take away from
our season. Ohio State was just
another test for us."
Dankworth. who was twice
named an All-State high school
quarterback, said he considered
coming to Stanford. "Stanford
was still picking its coach and
UCLA had Pepper Rodgers. I
didn't want to go to a school that
had a new coach."
Ironically, Dankworth has
played under three coaches
since he's been in Westwood. "I
couldn't have imagined playing
for three head coaches in five
years. It seemed that just as we
were starting to get our program
off the ground we would have a
coaching change.

way of telling quarterback Jeff
Dankworth that he would spend
his final year in Westwood re
turning punts.
After all, everyone knew that
quarterback Steve Bukich had
the best arm on the team.
Everyone, that is, except
Da nk worth.
"The press played up our
quarterback thing this summer,"
said Dankworth. "I knew coach
Donahue wasn't going to alter
nate his quarterbacks.
Pressure
"1 knew how good I was. I
worked just behind (former
Bruin quarterback) John Sciarra
last year. Having someone push

ing me this year just kept the
pressure on."
Dankworth, who has com
pleted 19 of 31 passes for 241
yards this year, said, "People
don't know how well I can pass. I
think I'm a better passer than
people give me credit for."
But it is Dankworth's ability
on the ground that has the Stan
ford defense worried. The
6-foot-l. 209-pound quarterback
has taught opponents' defenses
that they can't key on halfbacks
Wendell Tyler and Theotis
Brown. Dankworth is the sixth
leading rusher in the I'ac-8 with
315 yards.
Veer
"Coach Donahue told me early
in the season that he thought de
fenses would key on Wendell.
The veer is the type of offense
which lets any back have a good
game."

And he's making Bruin fans
forget Sciarra. A lot of people
thought Sciarra was the only
quarterback able to direct UC
LA's veer offense. "The key to
running the veer is experience,"
said Dankworth. "I started three
games when John was injured
two years ago, but I'm still learn
ing every day.
"I've got to do something
about fumbles," said
Dankworth "I'm the leading
fumbler on the team. But the veer
is the kind of offense that im
proves as the season goes
along."
The Los Angeles press has
been hard on the Bruins for settl
ing for a 10-10 tie with Ohio
State last weekend. Many
thought UCLA shouldn't have
punted the ball in the last three
minutes of the contest.
"Ohio State tied us. They had

to come back to do it," said
Dankvvorth. "We were playing
sound football. The Buckeyes
didn't have the confidence to go
for it."
Last year UCLA totally ig
nored Ohio State to prepare for
the conference opener with
Stanford. "We went into last
week's game, from a team
standpoint, thinking more about
Stanford." said Dankworth.
"We've been thinking about
Stanford for the last two weeks.
"Hut we didn't do what we did
last year, and start practicing for
Stanford the week of the Ohio
State game," said Dankworth.
"The coaches last year thought
we didn't have a chance against
the Buckeyes. And that bugged
the players."
Stanford important
Dankworth said that even
though UCLA is playing Stan
ford, a team which has won only
one game, it is a more important
contest than the Bruins'two na
tionally televised games.
"Everyone knows that to lose
to Stanford, or any other confer
ence team, will take away from
our season. Ohio State was just
another test for us."
Dankworth. who was twice
named an All-State high school
quarterback, said he considered
coming to Stanford. "Stanford
was still picking its coach and
UCLA had Pepper Rodgers. I
didn't want to go to a school that
had a new coach."
Ironically, Dankworth has
played under three coaches
since he's been in Westwood. "I
couldn't have imagined playing
for three head coaches in five
years. It seemed that just as we
were starting to get our program
off the ground we would have a
coaching change.
