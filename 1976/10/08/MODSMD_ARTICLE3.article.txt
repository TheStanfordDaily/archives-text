# Martial law sets order in Thailand
## 
### 
Bangkok, Thailand — Thailand's
day-old military regime, enforcing
martial law after Wednesday's bloody
riots, clamped down on government
machinery and the press yesterday and
arrested about 3000 persons in and
around the capital.
Police spokesmen said those ar
rested, most of them university stu
dents and about a quarter of them wo
men, were being held on various
charges of subversion. Some could
face a life-time jail sentence.
Police fired carbines in the air to
disperse a crowd near Thammasat
University, where savage fighting
Wednesday between university lef
tists, right-wing groups and police left
at least 26 dead and about 180
wounded, by police count.
Lost freedom
"We have lost our freedom but have
law and order," a Thammasat graduate
told reporters near the university.
Bangkok streets returned to normal
yesterday. Stores and businesses were
open, although patronage was light. A
midnight-to-dawn curfew, imposed
when the military took power, was
lifted. All schools remained closed for
the second day.
A half-dozen tanks were posted near
key government buildings as a show of
force, but were later ordered back.
Sangad Chalawyu, a former navy
admiral and defense minister who
heads the new regime, met with all
ministry undersecretaries to explain
new government policy but refused to
speak to reporters.
Well-organized
Little was made public about the
men behind the seemingly well
organized takeover, but reliable
sources said they believed Sangad was
backed bv stronger military and politi
cal figures. The 60-year-old Sangad
heads an all-military body officially
calling itself the National Executive
Committee.
Sangad's group pushed aside the
tottering, civilian government of
former Prime Minister Seni Prarnoj.
Authorities announced some form
of censorship would be imposed on all
publications, radio and television, and
a spokesman said there would be some
censorship on international news or
ganizations. He did not give details.
Bangkok's newspapers were shut
down, but the regime said they could
submit applications to resume publi
cation.
Complaints of lawlessness
The military takeover followed
months of complaints by rightists ob
jecting to growing lawlessness, cor
ruption, student violence and the
weakness of the ousted government.
Associated Press writer and photo
grapher Neal Ulevich came across
crowds gathered around the bodies of
two lynched students hanging from
trees.
Most arrested students were appa
rently being picked up in the streets,
where political meetings by more than
five persons are forbidden. A senior
police officer said his men were look
ing for student subversives and Viet
namese Communists.

five persons are forbidden. A senior

Bangkok, Thailand — Thailand's
day-old military regime, enforcing
martial law after Wednesday's bloody
riots, clamped down on government
machinery and the press yesterday and
arrested about 3000 persons in and
around the capital.
Police spokesmen said those ar
rested, most of them university stu
dents and about a quarter of them wo
men, were being held on various
charges of subversion. Some could
face a life-time jail sentence.
Police fired carbines in the air to
disperse a crowd near Thammasat
University, where savage fighting
Wednesday between university lef
tists, right-wing groups and police left
at least 26 dead and about 180
wounded, by police count.
Lost freedom
"We have lost our freedom but have
law and order," a Thammasat graduate
told reporters near the university.
Bangkok streets returned to normal
yesterday. Stores and businesses were
open, although patronage was light. A
midnight-to-dawn curfew, imposed
when the military took power, was
lifted. All schools remained closed for
the second day.
A half-dozen tanks were posted near
key government buildings as a show of
force, but were later ordered back.
Sangad Chalawyu, a former navy
admiral and defense minister who
heads the new regime, met with all
ministry undersecretaries to explain
new government policy but refused to
speak to reporters.
Well-organized
Little was made public about the
men behind the seemingly well
organized takeover, but reliable
sources said they believed Sangad was
backed bv stronger military and politi
cal figures. The 60-year-old Sangad
heads an all-military body officially
calling itself the National Executive
Committee.
Sangad's group pushed aside the
tottering, civilian government of
former Prime Minister Seni Prarnoj.
Authorities announced some form
of censorship would be imposed on all
publications, radio and television, and
a spokesman said there would be some
censorship on international news or
ganizations. He did not give details.
Bangkok's newspapers were shut
down, but the regime said they could
submit applications to resume publi
cation.
Complaints of lawlessness
The military takeover followed
months of complaints by rightists ob
jecting to growing lawlessness, cor
ruption, student violence and the
weakness of the ousted government.
Associated Press writer and photo
grapher Neal Ulevich came across
crowds gathered around the bodies of
two lynched students hanging from
trees.
