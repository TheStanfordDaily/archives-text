### 
After spending the summer holed up in a
small Alaskan village with reams of Pacific-8
statistics, anecdotes and inside info, the Dai
ly's football wizard is ready to hazard some
guesses as the league season opens this
weekend. Justin case things go badly, he has
a return ticket.
The most important game involves none
other than the Stanford Cardinals, who play at
UCLA Saturday night.
On UCLA's side is its national ranking of
third, Pac-8 leading running game, league
leading defense and 3-0-1 record.
On Stanford's side is the Los Angeles Col
iseum and Guy Benjamin.
The Bruins would seem to have the edge.
Stanford will rally against UCLA, but come up
a little short. The Cards are really not as bad as
they've looked.

Oregon plays at California Saturday, and
the Ducks will have a helluva time trying to
stop Cal's offense. Look for the Bears to win
in a romp.
USC travels to Washington State in what will
surely be a massacre. The Trojans beat Ore
gon 53-0, and Washington State isn't as good
as the Ducks.
Washington will be at Oregon State. The
Beavers have a minor problem in that they're
worst in the league against the run and
Washington is averaging 268 yards on the
ground this season. Oregon State should re
main winless.
