# Ceresino: a natural middle 'backer
## 
### Chris Kamel 
"To be effective against UCLA, we're going
to have to plug up the holes that their offen
sive line opens up." said Stanford football
coach )ack Christiansen.
At 6-foot-2, 225-pounds, starting middle
linebacker Cordy Ceresino is one of the most
effective plugs Christiansen has this season.
Ceresino has registered an astounding 73
tackles in his first four games, twice as many
as any of his teammates on the defensive unit.
But he explained that all those tackles were
not as satisfying as the one which stopped San
Jose State's Walt Robinson short of the goal
line, on the last play of the first half, in Stan
ford's 28-23 win over the Spartans two weeks
ago.
'Deciding touchdown'
"The best thing about it was that it turned
out to be the deciding touchdown," Ceresino
said. "It was hard to tell where he was in the
pileup. but he was so close that I thought he
was in." The official disagreed with Ceresino,
ruling that Robinson's knee had touched the
ground before he had crossed the goal line
The Pacific-8 added a little icing to the cake
later when it named him defensive player-of
t he-week for his performance against San Jose.
There is little question that he is the Cards'
defensive Player-of-the-Season so far this
year. Along with being the leading Stanford
tackier, he has stopped opponents in the
backfield five times for 28 yards. Ceresino has
registered two sacks and deflected a pass.
Natural linebacker?
What makes Ceresino so effective? Well, ac
cording to Card defensive coordinator Norb
Meeker, Cordy is a natural middle linebacker.
Playing middle linebacker, however, is no
thing new to Ceresino. He was a two-time
All-American at the position at southern
California's Notre Dame High School.
"Last season I played inside linebacker in
our "Fin-defense" he explained. "Now, having
changed back to a three linebacker defense. I
am comfortable at my old position."
Hut just because Ceresino is comfortable it
doesn't mean that his job is any easier. In fact,
he has to keep his eye on more people than

before.
"I have to watch both the noseguard and
naturally everyone in between," he said.
Contact
Ceresino, however, doesn't just watch after
the ball is snapped. According to Christian
sen, the sophomore just "goes to the ball."
"Gordy likes contact." Christiansen said.
"I've noticed that he really doesn't like prac
tice drills as much as just working on his hit
ting."
Even Ceresino admits that much of his work
and improvement has been in the tackling de
partment.
"Last season 1 had no technique," he re
membered. "It was actually more of an all
brutal style." Most of Ceresino's progress
came in the off-season of last year. According
to Christiansen, he has steadily improved and
has gained experience in the meantime.
Pro football
All this self-improvement isn't tedious to
Ceresino. He's shooting for professional foot
ball. Chris agrees that the second year letter
man has a shot in the NFL, because he's highly
motivated.
"I usually gradually start building up my
motivation for a game on the Monday before,"
he said. "1 don't get up for a game by talking to
myself or anything like that. It just builds up
inside of me."
For Ceresino, tomorrow night's game
against UCLA has been building up in him for
some time. He explained that he is from the
Los Angeles area and has something to prove.
Too small
"The Bruins thought I was too small to be a
middle linebacker." he said, "and I want to
show them that I have used my frame to an
advantage."
Ceresino has not patterned himself after
anyone. He just tries to improve himself until
he feels he has reached his peak.
Ceresino still has quite a long way to go
before he is satisfied with himself, he
explained. The sophomore plans to build up a
stronger upper body as well as improve on his
quickness and agility.

Pro football
All this self-improvement isn't tedious to
Ceresino. He's shooting for professional foot
ball. Chris agrees that the second year letter
man has a shot in the NFL, because he's highly
motivated.
"I usually gradually start building up my
motivation for a game on the Monday before,"
he said. "1 don't get up for a game by talking to
myself or anything like that. It just builds up
inside of me."
For Ceresino, tomorrow night's game
against UCLA has been building up in him for
some time. He explained that he is from the
Los Angeles area and has something to prove.
Too small
"The Bruins thought I was too small to be a
middle linebacker." he said, "and I want to
show them that I have used my frame to an
advantage."
Ceresino has not patterned himself after
anyone. He just tries to improve himself until
he feels he has reached his peak.
Ceresino still has quite a long way to go
before he is satisfied with himself, he
explained. The sophomore plans to build up a
stronger upper body as well as improve on his
quickness and agility.

Gordy Ceresino
"To be effective against UCLA, we're going
to have to plug up the holes that their offen
sive line opens up." said Stanford football
coach )ack Christiansen.
At 6-foot-2, 225-pounds, starting middle
linebacker Cordy Ceresino is one of the most
effective plugs Christiansen has this season.
Ceresino has registered an astounding 73
tackles in his first four games, twice as many
as any of his teammates on the defensive unit.
But he explained that all those tackles were
not as satisfying as the one which stopped San
Jose State's Walt Robinson short of the goal
line, on the last play of the first half, in Stan
ford's 28-23 win over the Spartans two weeks
ago.
'Deciding touchdown'
"The best thing about it was that it turned
out to be the deciding touchdown," Ceresino
said. "It was hard to tell where he was in the
pileup. but he was so close that I thought he
was in." The official disagreed with Ceresino,
ruling that Robinson's knee had touched the
ground before he had crossed the goal line
The Pacific-8 added a little icing to the cake
later when it named him defensive player-of
t he-week for his performance against San Jose.
There is little question that he is the Cards'
defensive Player-of-the-Season so far this
year. Along with being the leading Stanford
tackier, he has stopped opponents in the
backfield five times for 28 yards. Ceresino has
registered two sacks and deflected a pass.
Natural linebacker?
What makes Ceresino so effective? Well, ac
cording to Card defensive coordinator Norb
Meeker, Cordy is a natural middle linebacker.
Playing middle linebacker, however, is no
thing new to Ceresino. He was a two-time
All-American at the position at southern
California's Notre Dame High School.
"Last season I played inside linebacker in
our "Fin-defense" he explained. "Now, having
changed back to a three linebacker defense. I
am comfortable at my old position."
Hut just because Ceresino is comfortable it
doesn't mean that his job is any easier. In fact,
he has to keep his eye on more people than

before.
"I have to watch both the noseguard and
naturally everyone in between," he said.
Contact
Ceresino, however, doesn't just watch after
the ball is snapped. According to Christian
sen, the sophomore just "goes to the ball."
"Gordy likes contact." Christiansen said.
"I've noticed that he really doesn't like prac
tice drills as much as just working on his hit
ting."
Even Ceresino admits that much of his work
and improvement has been in the tackling de
partment.
"Last season 1 had no technique," he re
membered. "It was actually more of an all
brutal style." Most of Ceresino's progress
came in the off-season of last year. According
to Christiansen, he has steadily improved and
has gained experience in the meantime.
