# Intramural roundup
## Independents pick weird names 
### Bill Wernecke 
Has your house intramural
team ever been obliterated by
Seek and Destroy, pecked apart
by the Wasted Parrots, or
scolded by the Fmerson Muthas?
If so. it became just another vic
tim of that group of unknown IM
juggernauts known as indepen
dent teams.
There are two advantages to
forming an independent team.
First, team members can be
drawn from friends all over
campus. Secondly, each inde
pendent may select a clever,
original and sometimes approp
riate nickname.
The growth of independent
teams, which now make up
about half of all competing IM
units, dates back to the early '70s
when a group of Junipero resi
dents and friends decided to
form an independent organiza
tion.

Last year Junipero Rangers'
Association (JRA), drawing
people from everywhere except
Berkeley, won the IM crown
with a record-setting 736 points.
Independent teams seem to
spring from three different
sources. Like JRA, they may
begin as a theme house or in
terest group. An independent
may also consist of former mem
bers of a living group — Arroyo
1974-75 has produced the Mira
cles, Aberrations and Space
Cowboys. Finally, teams such as
I Piccoli Culi and Cockney Rebel
are formed from people who met
at an overseas campus.
With the proliferation of inde
pendents over the last several
years, the "name game" has be
come hotly contested. Old favo
rites like the Nads, Wildmen,
and Culos have come to be re
placed by such current powers
as Swanks and the All-Comers.

Dutch Fehring, IM director,
sees a favorable aspect in the
growth of independents and
their crazy nicknames. The i u
nique names, he notes, "are indi
cative of the type of intramural
program that we have here at
Stanford — it belongs to the stu
dents."
Where do the names come
from':' Often, they are attempts to
describe the team's alleged skil Is
or lack thereof. Seek and Destroy
has won the men's 'A' basketball
championship for two straight
years. No Finer Niner also made
the softball playoffs.
Among others, however, the
Walking Wounded. Zeroes,
Bozos, Sleepers and Quadrap
legics seemed to have little suc
cess.
Often the team names describe
affiliation with another group,
but that can be misleading. Last
year's Off Campus Center, Fire
men and Material Science teams
were all legitimate.

Many IM fans were disap
pointed during last year's 'B*
basketball playoffs, however,
when they found out that the two
forwards on Derek and the
Dorninos were not Clapton and
Allman.
Foreign names have become
very popular in the last several
seasons, including Les Vaches,
Nosotros, Bla Sejre (Blue
Champs in Swedish), Vatos
Locos and Los Chingones.
Whatever the source, the in
dependent team names help
make IM competition more in
teresting.
