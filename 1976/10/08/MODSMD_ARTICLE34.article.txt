# Spectacular passing attack
## Cal to battle for roses 
### Paul Bauman 
The Daily's series of Pacific-8
previews concludes today with a
look at the California Golden
Bears.

It was only five years ago that
California considered dropping
intercollegiate football from its
athletic program. Cal had a
mediocre-to-poor team and most
of the students couldn't have
cared less about football.
Then Mike White became the
head coach.
Now, Cal would no sooner
phase out football than it would
coed dorms.
Since leaving his assistant
coaching position at Stanford to
take over at Cal, White has built
the Hears into one of the most
explosive teams in the country.
They are also defending
Pacific-8 co-champions, which a
lot of people forget.
This year's team is fully capa
ble of becoming the sole champ
ion.
Great passing team
Any talk about Cal must begin
with the offense. The feats that
the Bears keep coming up with
week after week, particularly in
the passing department, literally
boggle the mind. No team in the
country has thrown as effec
tively as Cal has the past three
years. The question is if there has
ever been a better passing team.
Cal had another record-setting
performance against San Jose
State last Saturday, but that's
almost typical for the Bears.

In that game, receiver Wesley
Walker caught eight passes for
289 yards and three
touchdowns. The 289 yards was
a Pac-8 record and the three TDs
tied a league mark.
Broken down. Walker's aver
age catch went for over 36 yards.
Now that just doesn't happen in
football today. This is the age of
running offenses such as the
wishbone. The only time Cal
uses the wishbone is on its salad
at training table.
Another good day
Quarterback Joe Roth hit on 16
of 30 passes for 229 yards and
one touchdown against the Spar
tans, an average game for him.
White also decided to let Roth's
backup, Fred Besana, get some
experience. The result was two
completions in two attempts for
two touchdowns, covering a
total of 123 yards.
Roth said after the game that if
he ever got hurt, Besana could
come in and "nobody would
know the difference."
That's quite a compliment be
cause since taking the starting
job away from Besana in Cal's
fourth game last year. Roth led
the Bears to six wins in seven
games and passed for over 200
yards in each of the last five.
Roth was named the AP and
LIPI "Offensive Player of the
Week" after Cal beat
Washington, 27-24, last year. He
set an all-time Cal record for pas
sing yardage, completing 24 of

36 passes for 380 yards and four
TDs. And he did it against the
Pac-B's best pass defense.
Still going strong
Roth hasn't slumped any this
season. He's the leading passer
in the Pac-8 with an average of
249 passing yards a game.
Walker is second in the league
with 19 catches, but leads the
Pac-8 in yardage (545) and
touchdowns (five).
Injuries have confused the
rushing situation, but the Bears
can still move the ball on the
ground. Fullback Paul Jones is
out for the season with a knee
injury. Tom Newton has moved
over from tailback and Mar key
Crane, who broke all of O.J.
Simpson's rushing records at
Galileo High School in San
Francisco, has broken into the
starting lineup.
Crane and Newton are cur
rently eighth and ninth, respec
tively, in Pac-8 rushing statis
tics.
Cal's offensive line must be
good to allow Roth to pass so
well and thebacks to run so well,
and it is. The line averages over
250 pounds and four of the five
linemen are seniors. The stand
out is tackle Ted Albrecht, an
All-Pac-8 selection last year.
Cal also has the smallest and
best place kicker in the league â€”
Jim Breech. The 5-foot-7, 150-
pound junior, who kicks
soccer-style, hit 11 of 19 field
goals last year and 39 of 41 extra
points. Breech is exceptional be
cause he combines range and
consistency.
White has not been able to
bring Cal's defense anywhere
near up to the level of its offense.
If Cal is going to have to the Rose
Bowl New Year's Day, the de
fense is going to have to shape
up a little bit. The Bears cur
rently rank last in the Pac-8 in
team defense, although they're
coming off a pretty good effort
against San Jose State.
Linebacker Pete Sitta and
safety Anthony Green are the top
players on a defense that lists
only one starter over 215
pounds. Linebacker Phil Heck
has seen a great career practi
cally ruined by knee injuries.
Cal played a brutal preseason
schedule (Georgia, Oklahoma,
Arizona State and San Jose State)
and managed to get out of it 2-2.
As the Pac-8 season opens this
weekend, the Bears will almost
surely prevent the race from
coming down to a battle between
rivals USC and UCLA.
