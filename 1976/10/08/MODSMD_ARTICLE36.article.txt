# NCIAC Pre-Season tourney
## Scotchers open season 
### John Roos Debbie Carlton 
The Stanford field hockey
team debuts this weekend at
UC-Davis, in the two-day NCIAC
field hockey tournament. The
pre-season tourney is a nine
team affair.
Last year's NCIAC champion,
San jose State, along with con
ference powers UC-Davis and
Sacramento State, should pro
vide the Cards with an indica
tion of their strength.
Coach Shirley Schoof wel
comes back seven players from
last year's second-place NCIAC
team. Three-year veteran kathy
Levinson, a senior forward,
should provide the Scotchers
with leadership. Juniors Sukie
Jackson, Mandy Read and
Onnie killefer, the Cards' lead
ing scorer last year, should give
the Scotchers a strong front line.
Other returnees include
Martha Andersen, Jane Soyster
and Jessie Cerrard.
Premier goalie
Stanford lost last year's pre
miere goalie, Betsy Morris, to
graduation. But the Scotchers
have two fine goalies in senior
Cathleen Chase and sophomore
Buffie Berger, who are in head
to-head competition for the job.
Both players were on last year's
junior varsity squad.
"On the whole, there's no
doubt this year's squad is
stronger than last year's champ
ionship team," said Schoof.
"The talent, ability and en
thusiasm necessary for a win
ning team are all present this
year. We have a strong veteran
squad, which gained valuable
experience by playing eastern
teams in the Nationals last year,"
Schoof added.
Last year's Scotcher squad was
noted for its enthusiasm, but this
year's team seems even more ac
tive. Schoof said, unlike 1972
presidential candidate Ceorge
McGovern. her squad will actu
ally put out "1000 per cent."
Schoof said, "The conference
this year is much harder than last
year's and it will take a lot of
hard work to come out on top.
But the team has proven to be up
to it."
Tough schedule
In addition to a tougher
schedule, the Cards face a gruel
ing eight-game schedule, as
compared to six contests last
year.
But there is little doubt that
the Scotchers will again capture
the attention of the Stanford
community. Last season, only
about 20 people showed up at
the Cards' first game. But over
300 people gathered to watch the
Scotchers shoot for a berth in the
Nationals, in their final game of
the season.

With budget cutbacks in the
Athletic Department, the Cards
have had to fight for funds. The
Scotchers cut short their sum
mer vacations to host a high
school field hockey clinic. It
raised over $400, which will
help finance road trips outside
the Bay Area.
The Cards hope the year will
culminate in a trip to the Nation
als over Thanksgiving weekend.
They'd like the opportunity to
make up for last year's poor per
formance in the Nationals.
But first, the team will have its
hands full with a tough NCIAC
schedule.
