# Menlo Park 'hesitant'
## Willow Road plan stalled 
### Lonnie Rosenwald 
The City of Menlo Park has indi
cated that one of its foremost hesita
tions in approving the proposed plan
for improvement of Sand Hill-Willow
Road is the uncertainty of Stanford's
commitment to build a "Campus Drive
extension."
The university both in written ag
reement and comment, has shown that
it is prepared to construct the exten
sion. but offers no concrete plan for
initiation of such a project, nor for its
financing.
The proposed extension would con
nect the present terminal point of
Campus Drive, at Panama Street, to
(unipero Serra Blvd. west of Lake
Lagunita.
Part of the Sand Hill-Willow Road
agreement between the university and
Palo Alto stipulates that the extension
must be built at such a time when Sand
Hill-Willow generates a surplus of traf
fic at the intersection of Pasteur Drive,
but "shall in no event be required prior
to the expiration of five years from the
date of completion of the Willow Road
Improvement Project."
Menlo Park representatives want the
extension to be built immediately.
"The extension is needed now." said
Menlo P.irk Mayor Jim Calloway at an
informal meeting between representa
tives of Menlo Park, Palo Alto and the
university in Palo Alto yesterday."It
should have been done a long time
ago."
Who will pay?
Andrew Doty, director of commun
ity relations for the university, told the
Doiiv before the meeting that Stanford
would build the extension "if Menlo
Park will help pay for it." No estimate
of the cost of the project has been cal
culated
Menlo Park city councilman Ira

Bonde claimed that "Menlo Park
doesn't have the money to pay for it."
"Palo Alto paid the lion's share
here," said Palo Alto councilman Scott
Carey, referring to the Willow Road
project. "We would not expect to pay
there."
Other objections
Other issues which generated grea
ter consensus among the three parties

were a proposal to change the name of
the road to Sand Mill Road, rejection of
a bid to ban trucks from the new route
and elimination of right hand turns
from Willow on to Oak Road.
The problem of increased noise pol
lution was also discussed, though no
solutions were agreed upon. The meet
ing adjourned with plans to meet again
next Thursday in Menlo Park.

"Palo Alto paid the lion's share
here," said Palo Alto councilman Scott
Carey, referring to the Willow Road
project. "We would not expect to pay
there."
Other objections
Other issues which generated grea

were a proposal to change the name of
the road to Sand Mill Road, rejection of
a bid to ban trucks from the new route
and elimination of right hand turns
from Willow on to Oak Road.
The problem of increased noise pol

solutions were agreed upon. The meet

Residents of Stanford, Menlo Park, Palo Alto and Por

for a long time. Now they're trying to do something
about it.
The City of Menlo Park has indi
cated that one of its foremost hesita
tions in approving the proposed plan
for improvement of Sand Hill-Willow
Road is the uncertainty of Stanford's
commitment to build a "Campus Drive
extension."
The university both in written ag
reement and comment, has shown that
it is prepared to construct the exten
sion. but offers no concrete plan for
initiation of such a project, nor for its
financing.
The proposed extension would con
nect the present terminal point of
Campus Drive, at Panama Street, to
(unipero Serra Blvd. west of Lake
Lagunita.
Part of the Sand Hill-Willow Road
agreement between the university and
Palo Alto stipulates that the extension
must be built at such a time when Sand
Hill-Willow generates a surplus of traf
fic at the intersection of Pasteur Drive,
but "shall in no event be required prior
to the expiration of five years from the
date of completion of the Willow Road
Improvement Project."
Menlo Park representatives want the
extension to be built immediately.
"The extension is needed now." said
Menlo P.irk Mayor Jim Calloway at an
informal meeting between representa
tives of Menlo Park, Palo Alto and the
university in Palo Alto yesterday."It
should have been done a long time
ago."
Who will pay?
Andrew Doty, director of commun
ity relations for the university, told the
Doiiv before the meeting that Stanford
would build the extension "if Menlo
Park will help pay for it." No estimate
of the cost of the project has been cal
culated
Menlo Park city councilman Ira

Bonde claimed that "Menlo Park
doesn't have the money to pay for it."
"Palo Alto paid the lion's share
here," said Palo Alto councilman Scott
Carey, referring to the Willow Road
project. "We would not expect to pay
there."
