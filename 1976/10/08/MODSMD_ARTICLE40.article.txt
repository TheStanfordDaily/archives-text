## 
### Paul Bauman Chris Baker 
Stanford quarterback Cuv
Benjamin yesterday denied
published reports that he is con
sidering skipping his senior sea
son and putting his name up for
grabs in the NFL draft.
"I have been planning on hav
ing a 13th quarter and I have
been taking less units," said Ben
jamin. "I'm not going to
graduate in June. I'll have 12
units left over."
The Pacific-8 granted Benja
min an extra year of eligibility
because he missed his entire
freshman season with a knee in
jury. "I'm not in any hurry to go
and doanything (turn pro),"said
Benjamin. "I'm not a superstar
who's going to be making a lot of
money."
Son Fmnrisco Examiner writer
Frank Cooney said yesterday
that Benjamin was "so fed up
with the treatment he has re
ceived sharing center stage, that
even when the spotlight will be
all his (Cordova graduates), he'd

rather play for pay than
Christiansen."
"The reason if I did (turn pro)
would be purely financial and
not personal," said Benjamin.
"The only thing would he if 1 got
a lot of money, which I couldn't
refuse, but 1 can't foresee that
happening."
Benjamin could not figure out
howCooneygot his information.
"Strictly guessing — 100 per
cent — I don't think I've ever met
the man (Cooney) and he hasn't
talked to anybody who knows
me, because they wouldn't say
things like that.
"Only my friends would know
if I was going to do something
like that and they wouldn't be
popping off."
If Benjamin suddenly found a
giant bag of money on his
doorstep from the NIT- he woidd
have until Jan. 15 to notify the
league of his intention to turn
pro.
