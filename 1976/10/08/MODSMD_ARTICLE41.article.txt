Washington — President Cerald Lord, reversing
administration policy, ordered the Commerce De
partment yesterday to begin disclosing which U.S.
companies are being asked by Arab countries to
participate in a boycott against Israel.
I lowever, Commerce Secretary Elliot Richardson
said the order only applies to requests from Arab
countries made yesterday or later. It a company has
already 112 iled reports with the government saying it
was participating or was asked to t.ike part in the
boycott, this information will not be made public.
In his debate Wednesday. lord had led many
viewers to think that past reports would be made
public.
Richardson told reporters. "We don't believe that
it would be appropriate to make the order retroac
tive, since the reports that have been filed with us
up to now were filed with the understanding that
they would be confidential." He said Ford will set
the dates beyond which the report will be made
public.
September wholesale prices rise
Washington — Wholesale prices rose; in Sep
tember at the fastest rate in 11 months, climbing
nine-tenths of one per cent, and provoking new
Democratic attacks on President Ford's economic
policies.

The Labor Department said price increases were
spread across the board, affecting both agricultural
and industrial commodities.
The September price surge, which translates to a
10.8 percent annual rate, followed a period of rela
tively moderate increases. While it could signal a
resurgence of inflation, economists caution that a
single month's figures do not necessarily indicate
trends.
New British borrowing reductions
London — Britain's Labour government clamped
a record-breaking squeeze on borrowing yesterday
to curb inflation and bolster overseas confidence in
the pound sterling.
However, the measure — a hike in the Hank of
England's minimum lending rate from 13 per cent
to the record 15 per cent — is also expected to
depress industry, increase unemployment and
make mortgage prices higher for Britain's 4.5 mill
ion home owners carrying mortgages.
Humphrey's operation successful
New York — Sen. Hubert Humphrey underwent
a six-hour operation yesterday for removal of his
cancerous bladder, and the chief surgeon said af
terwards. "The operation was eminently success
ful."
"As tar as we're concerned, the senator is cured,"
said Willet Whitmore Jr.. head of the team

which performed the surgery at Sloan-kettering
(lancer Center. In cancer terminology, the word
cure is used in terms of a five-year survival rate.
An hour after the operation. Humphrey was re
ported to be awake and talking coherently.
The Minnesota Democrat, seeking re-election
this year, has been hospitalized here since Monday
for the operation, which involved complete re
moval of the bladder.
Lockheed dodged 1975 taxes
Washington — Lockheed Aircraft Corp. paid no
federal income tax in 1975 and Pacific Gas & Elec
tric: Co. paid only 2.9 per cent, according to a con
gressional study.
Congressman Charles Vanik. an Ohio Democrat
who released the study this week, said it illustrates
the way the supposed 4H per cent corporate tax rati
is shot with loopholes.
Lockheed, with net income of $84.1 million, was
the only California based company of 11 major cor
porations that escaped federal income taxes, the
study said. Income of the 11 topped $1.1 billion.

September wholesale prices rise
Washington — Wholesale prices rose; in Sep
tember at the fastest rate in 11 months, climbing
nine-tenths of one per cent, and provoking new
Democratic attacks on President Ford's economic
policies.

The Labor Department said price increases were
spread across the board, affecting both agricultural
and industrial commodities.
The September price surge, which translates to a
10.8 percent annual rate, followed a period of rela
tively moderate increases. While it could signal a
resurgence of inflation, economists caution that a
single month's figures do not necessarily indicate
trends.
