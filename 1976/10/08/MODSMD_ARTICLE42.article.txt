SLAC cables cut
Thirty different cables in "a half
dozen different places" at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator ("enter (S LAC]) have
been cut, according to SLAC Director
of Personnel Douglas Dupen.
What Dupen called the "serious
vandalism" was discovered Wednes
day at 7:.'K) p.m. after the automatic
safety system shut down the ac
celerator at 2:05 p.m.
After further searches of the SLAC
facility yesterday, the other damaged
cables were discovered.
Dupen called the damage "very
malicious." but said that the facility is
"still operating."
The cost of the damage could con

ceivable he in the hundreds of
thousands of dollars, according to Du
pen, although since there are a great
number of cables which need to be
checked, "it will take several weeks to
find out the extent of the vandalism."
Roger Hardy, president of United
Stanford Employees (USE), de
nounced the vandalism, saying, "Cer
tainly no responsible union member
could consider this as a legitimate
form of grievance or bargaining tactic.
"The vast majority of our members
and the unanimous USE union leader
ship feels that sabotage is not a useful
negotiation method and do not sup
port or condone that type of activity."

SLAC cables cut
Thirty different cables in "a half
dozen different places" at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator ("enter (S LAC]) have
been cut, according to SLAC Director
of Personnel Douglas Dupen.
What Dupen called the "serious
vandalism" was discovered Wednes
day at 7:.'K) p.m. after the automatic
safety system shut down the ac
celerator at 2:05 p.m.
After further searches of the SLAC
facility yesterday, the other damaged
cables were discovered.
Dupen called the damage "very
malicious." but said that the facility is
"still operating."
The cost of the damage could con

ceivable he in the hundreds of
thousands of dollars, according to Du
pen, although since there are a great
number of cables which need to be
checked, "it will take several weeks to
find out the extent of the vandalism."
Roger Hardy, president of United
Stanford Employees (USE), de
nounced the vandalism, saying, "Cer
tainly no responsible union member
could consider this as a legitimate
form of grievance or bargaining tactic.
"The vast majority of our members
and the unanimous USE union leader
ship feels that sabotage is not a useful
negotiation method and do not sup
port or condone that type of activity."
