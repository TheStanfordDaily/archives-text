# Panel discussion probes labor ills

Officials of the United Stanford
Employees (USE) and Stanford Uni
versity held a panel discussion yester
day afternoon on current university
labor problems.
Outlining the difficulties that USE
has faced in dealing with Stanford in
the collective bargaining process, USE
President Roger Hardy claimed that
the "distribution of power in the uni
versity is diffuse to a point where you
can't negotiate with anybody because
you can't find out who you're negotiat
ing with."
Hardy claimed that there is a "huge
build-up of grievances not yet
scheduled for arbitration" and that "30
of these are EOC (Equal Opportunity
Commission) charges of racial dis
crimination on the part of university
officials. There is a four-year backlog
on these."
Hardy called the university an "inef
ficient bureaucracy . . . (that is). . . soft
in the middle" because of the Peter
Principle. This principle suggests that
the exceptional worker is promoted
until he does an inefficient job.

Doug Barton, staff counsel here for
employe relations, felt that the filing of
307 grievances in the past two years
has created a "unique" situation, and
he found the "inability of the union to
resolve matters short of arbitration . . .
unusual."
'Trench warfare'
Hardy claimed that "for three years
we (USE) have been waging trench
warfare in the courts. There's been a
conscious decision on the part of
union leaders to fight Stanford on its
own ground, in the courts."
Hardy charged that Stanford is
"status conscious" and that it "likes to
build buildings a lot. They like to
create tastefully gaudy tributes to
higher education." He said he felt that
the university "should have consulted
the workers before they decided to
build (such edifices as) the new Law
School. The workers were not asked
and they are affected by it."
Hardy claims that the university in
tended to pay construction workers
the same "rate they'd been paying
them all along." which he contends
are "unequitable (sic) by Bay Area
standards." He said that not just the
salaries of the IHOO USE employes are
at stake. "They can't give USE extra
benefits because they'll have to in
crease the salaries of faculty, stall, ad
ministrators and secretaries. The in
verted pyramid will tip over and Stan
ford won't have enough money to pay
the mortgage."
Barton said that he thought the ini
tial round of negotiations in 197:1-74
was a failure. USE proposed a 100 per
cent increase in salaries in 197 1 which
would includea4opercent increase in
wages alone, with benefits taking up
the other 60 per cent. Barton said.
"However." Barton continued, "the
current round of negotiations has not
yet tailed. This time we've met for a
couple of months and are; getting to the
point of real decision-making. It is not
clear whether or not we're there. . .but
we're at the end of the road in terms ol
impasse negotiation."
Because Barton views Stanford as a
non-profit institution, he said, "There
is no question of allocation of profits
(here). We are at the point to ask 'is
there a common ground or not?' "
