# Food poisonings rumored at Larkin
## 
### Arlene Kishi 
An affliction that seems to be food
poisoning has hit the residents of Lar
kin House in the Stern complex.
Shortly after lunch on Wednesday,
several of them became ill.
"1 had stomach cramps pretty bad
and also diarrhea. It started about 3:30
and lasted about 18 hours," said one
resident.
"That night 1 just didn't feel well at
all. 1 had cramps and I felt really sick,"
said another.
The two Larkin residents who are
investigating the matter, Edwin Dere
cho and Clarissa Eastham, refused to
comment except to say there are 18
cases so far.
"At this point I really have no com
ment. There has been an incident and
we are collecting data at this stage,"
stated Resident Fellow Paul Griffin.
It is a "rumor that got started and
built up" said Annabelle Owen,
head of Stern Food Service. "What
happens with the freshmen group is
always blamed on food service which
is onlv normal when they come into

the institutionalized food system. I
think it's disgusting that they could
start something like this," she added.
According to a nurse at Cowell
Health Center, the major symptoms are
"nausea, diarrhea and abdominal
pain" which could appear from one
hour to 12 hours after the meal.
"1 had gas and a lot of indigestion an
hour after 1 ate. I'm still sick, it's just
starting to go away. I took some
Lomotil and it helped a lot." explained
one victim.
"I just got really sick, felt nauseous
and tired," another student com
plained. "It started last night and con
tinued today."
Last year at this time, the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity was also plagued by
what appeared to be food poisoning.
Some 35 students reported much the
same symptoms as in the Larkin case.
Safety and health specialist Hal Wil
son, and Doug Warsett, the physician
on call, had both suspected food
poisoning.
Investigation of the incident, how
ever, produced no official verdict.
