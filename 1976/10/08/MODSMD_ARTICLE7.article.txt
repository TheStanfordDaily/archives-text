# State court upholds non-minority rights
## 
### Elizabeth Pollock 
The California Supreme Court
recently ruled that a special
minority admissions program at
LJC-Davis medical school is un
constitutional because the court
said it "violates the constitu
tional rights of non-minority
applicants."
The case involved Allan
Bakke, a white student, who
claimed that he was qualified for
admission at Davis and had been
rejected solely because he was
white. He maintained, and the
court found, that less qualified
students than he had been ad
mitted through the special prog
ram. Sixteen of the 100 spaces
per class are reserved for minor
ity students.
The decision "is controlling as
to state institutions." said James
Siena, a university legal adviser.
Siena indicated that if the U.S.
Supreme Court upholds the de
cision. Stanford's admission
policies might be affected.
Minority students' applica
tions to the medical school here

are screened separately by a
Minority Admission Committee
headed by Dr. Roy Maffly. The
term "minority" refers to blacks,
chicanos, native Americans and
Puerto Ricans.
Although only about 10 per
cent of the applications to the
medical school come from
minority students, minorities
comprise close to 20 per cent of
the enrollment. Unqualified
students are not admitted, how
ever, and according to Maffly, of
94 minority students admitted
prior to 1976, HI have either
graduated or are proceeding
with their studies on schedule.
Faculty Senate's role
Maffly said, "The Faculty Se
nate is the one that has the pre
rogative over admissions proce
dure at the school." He pointed
out that it was the senate which,
in 1968, decided to start a prog
ram "for educationally and so
ciallv disadvantaged groups."
The court's ruling raises the
question of just what criteria
may be emphasized in granting

admission. Special admissions
for disadvantaged persons that
are based on considerations
other than race were not found
unconstitutional by the court.
The court encouraged in
creased recruitment efforts as an
alternative to having special
admissions committees.
At the School of Engineering
Assoc. Dean Lauress L. Wise said
they are "attempting to be more
active in recruiting."
The School of Engineering be
longs to a national consortium (if
20 schools who are working to
gether to recruit minority stu
dents. "UC was unable to join
because of the alleged reverse
discrimination," Wise said.
'I.ess qualified'
Stanford's engineering de
partments do give minority stu
dents special consideration in
fellowship matters.
"Some of those minority stu
dents who were given fellow
ship offers were less qualified
than some white students who
were offered fellowships." said

Wise. Only four or five out of
about 90 fellowships were in
volved,but "It's there, and 1 can't
deny it," Wise said.
He also explained that minor
ity students may receive some
consideration in admissions as
well as in fellowship grants. Un
like some other departments, in
engineering, admissions and fi
nancial aid decisions are made
separately. Therefore, a student
not considered qualified enough
for a Ph.D. fellowship could still
gain admission to the school as a
master's degree candidate.
At the business school. "We
make a great deal of recruitment
efforts on behalf of minority
groups," said Director of Admis
sions Richard Lazarus.
"We're trying to do a better job
than we've done in the past."
The business school has been
faced with a downward trend in
the numbers of minority stu
dents applying to the business
school relative to the si/.e of the
applicant pool. Lazarus indi
cated. This was largely attributed
to tin; overall increase in popu
larity among all students of the
business administration prog
ram.
Emily Canales. who was hired
to help with the recruitment ef
fort. used to work for under
graduate admissions. At the un
dergraduate level, she said, "All
things being equal we don't
admit any other student with
lower standards than any white
student we'd admit." She added,
"We looked at a wide variety of

variables ... (people) who
would be interesting to have."
On the graduate level, "We
give an additional bit of fellow
ship money if the department is
going to give the student finan
cial aid," said Karlene Dickey,
an associate dean in
the graduate division, for
example, if a fellowship reci
pient is a minority student, the
graduate department will re
ceive money equal to half of the
fellowship grant.
"It's the department's choice
who they want," Dickey said,
but if an applicant indicates
minority status, "the graduate
dean's office will be glad to look
over the file." The office has
three recruiters who help locate
and encourage qualified minor
ity students to apply.
Associate Law School Dean
William Keogh said that all ap
plications at the Law School are
screened by the same committee,
but that, "the educational course
they (minority students) have
followed may not have been as

good." As a result, the ultimate
admission decision may be
based on more subjective factors.
There have been two com
plaints of reverse discrimination
at Stanford lodged with HEW;
one against the medical school
and one against the law school.
The law complaint was drop

ped last spring. HEW came out
and investigated the medical
school complaint and ruled that
Stanford was in order, said
James Siena, legal adviser to the
president.
The ultimate resolution of the
question of reverse discrimina

tion as it affects Stanford, is "a
long way down the road." ac
cording to Siena. But until either
the U.S. Supreme Court refuses
to hear the case or rules on the
appeal, "the only thing it will do
is, it will make people nervous."
said Elizabeth Meyer, assistant
director of AIC.
