## Affirmative action verdict deplorable 
### 
William P. Creger

On Sept. 17,197f> the Sun Francisco
Chronicle published an account of the
California State Supreme Court's opin
ion in the Bakke case in which Justice
Mosk, speaking for the majority, indi
cated that medical school minority
admissions programs, such as that
employed by IJC-Davis, were uncon
stitutional since they resulted in un
equal treatment of candidates.
Justice Tobriner, the lone dissenter,
stated that, "as a practical matter, ra
cial classificatins frequently must be
employed if the effects of past dis
crimination and exclusion are to be
overcome."
As a 20-year member of a medical
school admissions committee, I
should like to agree strongly with Jus
ticeTobriner, and deplore the majority
decision.
I believe the majority decision in
this case is very superficially and de
ceptively just, but only to those cur
rently seeking admission to a school of
medicine, and not all just to the future
needs of our society as it will develop
over the next generation or two.
Plain observations
I feel that certain plain observations
are in order. First many, if not most
students of minority origin have
achieved neither the scholastic skills
nor the personal scholastic confidence
achieved by students of majority ori
gin. Anyone who has been a teacher
should have been able to observe this,
and most such observers will realize
the root causes of such a condition:
less social and economic opportunity
and less cause for personal and family
pride.
Many observers of our society also
believe that much of the violence and
self-injury evident in our society can
be traced to these same causes. It has
seemed fairly clear to me that multi
plying laws which attempt to control
society's behavior through penalties,
<incl multiplying the number of public
officials whose duties are to see that
such laws are obeyed, represent an
unpromising approach, or at least an
incomplete approach, to long-term
solutions of these problems.
'Going wrong'
I also believe that while small num
bers of minority and majority youths
will probably always "go wrong,"
most individuals in both groups will
add instead of subtract from the ac
complishments of their society if they
feel that hope, rewards and self
respect are possible for them to gain.
If 1 am right, then even in the most
optimistic view this is a 25- or 50-year
battle we must wage, and we cannot,
however apparently justifiably, get
discouraged with each year's or de
cade's disappointments. When
minority students have substantial
reason to hope that they can attain to
major position of trust and reward in
the community and in the nation, then
social behavior will improve.
I have expressed here a socially

pragmatic view which my own self
ishness and fears may have prompted
but I also believe equally strongly in
the motif of equal justice and oppor
tunity.
Majority prefertyice
Justice Mosk seems satisfied with
equal opportunity for medical school
admissions for all applicants, none to
be given advantage or preference.
What have we had for a hundred years
if not preference for the majority?
Medical school applicants of both
minority and majority origins have not
started the race from a base of equal
training or equal ease of entry. It is
frustrating to me, and I am sure to po
tential minority applicants for medical
school or a similar opportunity in life,
to be told that everyone has an equal
access to medical school when it has
not been, and is not now, true.
I am glad to see that Justice Tobriner
has recognized that social reconstruc
tion is a legitimate and necessary aim
of this society if it wants to be a just one
and if it wishes to survive.
It should also be noted that the jus
tices have dealt merely with an early
act in the medical school admission
play. A later act is now occuring in the
the form of objections from some med
ical school teachers of the basic medi
cal sciences that admitted students of
minority origins are not scoring as
high as majority students on medical
school tests.
Bad doctors
From this observation, it has been
concluded that we may be turning out
bad doctors for the people in order to
satisfy our zeal for social justice.
Two comments are pertinent here.
First, there is little evidence that in
formational tests in medical school
predict which physician will use his
medical information with energy and
compassion. What evidence we have
on this point suggests that the majority
of bad physician performances are at
titudinal not informational in nature.
Second, one does not suddenly en
noble a minority student by admitting
him to a medical school, for it takes
years to gain confidence in this kind of
arena.
I think we will have to admit minor
ity students to medical schools and
expect their informational test scores
to be substantially below their major
ity brethren so long as family and liv
ing conditions, and school conditions
prior to medical school, continue to be
substantially different for minority
and majority students.
We are talking about a job of social
reconstruction and we should expect it
to take several generations if we start
now. I fear that Justice Mosk and the
majority of his colleagues have de
layed resolution on one of the most
serious problems facing the people of
this contry.

William P. Creger

On Sept. 17,197f> the Sun Francisco
Chronicle published an account of the
California State Supreme Court's opin
ion in the Bakke case in which Justice
Mosk, speaking for the majority, indi
cated that medical school minority
admissions programs, such as that
employed by IJC-Davis, were uncon
stitutional since they resulted in un
equal treatment of candidates.
Justice Tobriner, the lone dissenter,
stated that, "as a practical matter, ra
cial classificatins frequently must be
employed if the effects of past dis
crimination and exclusion are to be
overcome."
As a 20-year member of a medical
school admissions committee, I
should like to agree strongly with Jus
ticeTobriner, and deplore the majority
decision.
I believe the majority decision in
this case is very superficially and de
ceptively just, but only to those cur
rently seeking admission to a school of
medicine, and not all just to the future
needs of our society as it will develop
over the next generation or two.
Plain observations
I feel that certain plain observations
are in order. First many, if not most
students of minority origin have
achieved neither the scholastic skills
nor the personal scholastic confidence
achieved by students of majority ori
gin. Anyone who has been a teacher
should have been able to observe this,
and most such observers will realize
the root causes of such a condition:
less social and economic opportunity
and less cause for personal and family
pride.
Many observers of our society also
believe that much of the violence and
self-injury evident in our society can
be traced to these same causes. It has
seemed fairly clear to me that multi
plying laws which attempt to control
society's behavior through penalties,
<incl multiplying the number of public
officials whose duties are to see that
such laws are obeyed, represent an
unpromising approach, or at least an
incomplete approach, to long-term
solutions of these problems.
'Going wrong'
I also believe that while small num
bers of minority and majority youths
will probably always "go wrong,"
most individuals in both groups will
add instead of subtract from the ac
complishments of their society if they
feel that hope, rewards and self
respect are possible for them to gain.
If 1 am right, then even in the most
optimistic view this is a 25- or 50-year
battle we must wage, and we cannot,
however apparently justifiably, get
discouraged with each year's or de
cade's disappointments. When
minority students have substantial
reason to hope that they can attain to
major position of trust and reward in
the community and in the nation, then
social behavior will improve.
I have expressed here a socially

pragmatic view which my own self
ishness and fears may have prompted
but I also believe equally strongly in
the motif of equal justice and oppor
tunity.
Majority prefertyice
Justice Mosk seems satisfied with
equal opportunity for medical school
admissions for all applicants, none to
be given advantage or preference.
What have we had for a hundred years
if not preference for the majority?
Medical school applicants of both
minority and majority origins have not
started the race from a base of equal
training or equal ease of entry. It is
frustrating to me, and I am sure to po
tential minority applicants for medical
school or a similar opportunity in life,
to be told that everyone has an equal
access to medical school when it has
not been, and is not now, true.
I am glad to see that Justice Tobriner
has recognized that social reconstruc
tion is a legitimate and necessary aim
of this society if it wants to be a just one
and if it wishes to survive.
It should also be noted that the jus
tices have dealt merely with an early
act in the medical school admission
play. A later act is now occuring in the
the form of objections from some med
ical school teachers of the basic medi
cal sciences that admitted students of
minority origins are not scoring as
high as majority students on medical
school tests.
Bad doctors
From this observation, it has been
concluded that we may be turning out
bad doctors for the people in order to
satisfy our zeal for social justice.
Two comments are pertinent here.
First, there is little evidence that in
formational tests in medical school
predict which physician will use his
medical information with energy and
compassion. What evidence we have
on this point suggests that the majority
of bad physician performances are at
titudinal not informational in nature.
Second, one does not suddenly en
noble a minority student by admitting
him to a medical school, for it takes
years to gain confidence in this kind of
arena.
I think we will have to admit minor
ity students to medical schools and
expect their informational test scores
to be substantially below their major
ity brethren so long as family and liv
ing conditions, and school conditions
prior to medical school, continue to be
substantially different for minority
and majority students.
We are talking about a job of social
reconstruction and we should expect it
to take several generations if we start
now. I fear that Justice Mosk and the
majority of his colleagues have de
layed resolution on one of the most
serious problems facing the people of
this contry.

and majority students.
We are talking about a job of social
reconstruction and we should expect it
to take several generations if we start
now. I fear that Justice Mosk and the
majority of his colleagues have de
layed resolution on one of the most
serious problems facing the people of
this contry.

On Sept. 17,197f> the Sun Francisco
Chronicle published an account of the
California State Supreme Court's opin
ion in the Bakke case in which Justice
Mosk, speaking for the majority, indi
cated that medical school minority
admissions programs, such as that
employed by IJC-Davis, were uncon
stitutional since they resulted in un
equal treatment of candidates.
Justice Tobriner, the lone dissenter,
stated that, "as a practical matter, ra
cial classificatins frequently must be
employed if the effects of past dis
crimination and exclusion are to be
overcome."
As a 20-year member of a medical
school admissions committee, I
should like to agree strongly with Jus
ticeTobriner, and deplore the majority
decision.
I believe the majority decision in
this case is very superficially and de
ceptively just, but only to those cur
rently seeking admission to a school of
medicine, and not all just to the future
needs of our society as it will develop
over the next generation or two.
Plain observations
I feel that certain plain observations
are in order. First many, if not most
students of minority origin have
achieved neither the scholastic skills
nor the personal scholastic confidence
achieved by students of majority ori
gin. Anyone who has been a teacher
should have been able to observe this,
and most such observers will realize
the root causes of such a condition:
less social and economic opportunity
and less cause for personal and family
pride.
Many observers of our society also
believe that much of the violence and
self-injury evident in our society can
be traced to these same causes. It has
seemed fairly clear to me that multi
plying laws which attempt to control
society's behavior through penalties,
<incl multiplying the number of public
officials whose duties are to see that
such laws are obeyed, represent an
unpromising approach, or at least an
incomplete approach, to long-term
solutions of these problems.
'Going wrong'
I also believe that while small num
bers of minority and majority youths
will probably always "go wrong,"
most individuals in both groups will
add instead of subtract from the ac
complishments of their society if they
feel that hope, rewards and self
respect are possible for them to gain.
If 1 am right, then even in the most
optimistic view this is a 25- or 50-year
battle we must wage, and we cannot,
however apparently justifiably, get
discouraged with each year's or de
cade's disappointments. When
minority students have substantial
reason to hope that they can attain to
major position of trust and reward in
the community and in the nation, then
social behavior will improve.
I have expressed here a socially

pragmatic view which my own self
ishness and fears may have prompted
but I also believe equally strongly in
the motif of equal justice and oppor
tunity.
Majority prefertyice
Justice Mosk seems satisfied with
equal opportunity for medical school
admissions for all applicants, none to
be given advantage or preference.
What have we had for a hundred years
if not preference for the majority?
Medical school applicants of both
minority and majority origins have not
started the race from a base of equal
training or equal ease of entry. It is
frustrating to me, and I am sure to po
tential minority applicants for medical
school or a similar opportunity in life,
to be told that everyone has an equal
access to medical school when it has
not been, and is not now, true.
I am glad to see that Justice Tobriner
has recognized that social reconstruc
tion is a legitimate and necessary aim
of this society if it wants to be a just one
and if it wishes to survive.
It should also be noted that the jus
tices have dealt merely with an early
act in the medical school admission
play. A later act is now occuring in the
the form of objections from some med
ical school teachers of the basic medi
cal sciences that admitted students of
minority origins are not scoring as
high as majority students on medical
school tests.
Bad doctors
From this observation, it has been
concluded that we may be turning out
bad doctors for the people in order to
satisfy our zeal for social justice.
Two comments are pertinent here.
First, there is little evidence that in
formational tests in medical school
predict which physician will use his
medical information with energy and
compassion. What evidence we have
on this point suggests that the majority
of bad physician performances are at
titudinal not informational in nature.
Second, one does not suddenly en
noble a minority student by admitting
him to a medical school, for it takes
years to gain confidence in this kind of
arena.
I think we will have to admit minor
ity students to medical schools and
expect their informational test scores
to be substantially below their major
ity brethren so long as family and liv
ing conditions, and school conditions
prior to medical school, continue to be
substantially different for minority
and majority students.
We are talking about a job of social
reconstruction and we should expect it
to take several generations if we start
now. I fear that Justice Mosk and the
majority of his colleagues have de
layed resolution on one of the most
serious problems facing the people of
