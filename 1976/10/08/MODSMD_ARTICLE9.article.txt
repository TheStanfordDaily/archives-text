# Letters: lectures, debate unity

Getting serious
When I defer qiy tuition at registra
tion and glance at the amount, I get
very serious about school. There's
some secret treasure buried here,
somewhere, through someone, which
is very important that I find.
The first problem is that I don't
know what anybody is talking about. 1
don't understand the lectures and I
can't read the text. It also occurs to me
that I don't have a clear idea about
what I want to study here anyway.
New options develop and I have no
criteria for priorities. Ideas become
confused in methodological jungles,
only to be pursued at high risk.
The next thing that happens is that I

realize that everyone else sitting in
that class knows what's going on. They
are commenting and questioning, and
although there are a few stupids,
mostly they are tuned in. And I don't
even know what channel they're
broadcasting on.
Maybe a few heart-to-heart chats
with some good friends would ease up
the pressure. I'll honestly tell them
where I am with this whole thing, and
the places I get into. And what trip I'd
rather be doing. And after maybe
another week of regrets, I'll get to
work. And start reading.
Then I'll take the real risk, the high
risk, when I really get into it all. If
there's anything really there. And if it

applies to me. II I take an interest or
dislike. And if 1 can do anything with
it, something really good with it,
maybe a few good papers this quarter,
maybe some thinking.
Maybe something good.

Send that message
I watched the Ford-Carter debate
Wednesday night. Both candidates
were united in their support of a Wil
sonian interventionist foreign policy,
in saber-rattling anti-communism, on
continued entanglement in the Middle
East, and in refusal to normalize rela
tions with Vietnam.
Liberals who recognize that the les
son of the Vietnam era is the moral
necessity of an American foreign pol
icy of non-intervention will have to
send that message to Washington by
voting for a committed non
interventionist, like Libertarian party
candidate Roger Mac√üride.

U.S. hypocrisy
It is understood that strong support
for the Zionist state is the cornerstone
of American foreign policy and that in
every American election yoUr com
mitment to that country becomes a
major issue.
What one fails to understand is that
it took you Americans 25 years to wel
come the Emperor of Japan on your
soil. It took another 25 years to recon
cile yourselves to the fact that HOO mill
ion humans in the People's Republic of
China do exist.
Yet your honorable Congress wants
to lecture sovereign Arab states on the
Arab boycott who up to this day are in
a state of war against aliens who have
occupied their sacred lands by force or
fraud.
