A large field of candidates are run
ning for the ASSU Senate and the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) this year.
ASSIJ Election Commissioner
Kandy Berg said last night that
precisely 69 students are running
for the 10 undergraduate senate seats
and 17 graduate students are running
for their respective 10 seats. Ten alter
nates will also be chosen.
Berg said the number of students
running was an increase over last year,
when there were "maybe 50 under
graduates running." He added that
"either last year or the year before,
there were 11 graduate students run
ning."
Berg noted that there was a low ratio
this year of female to male candidates,
"maybe 20 per cent."
Berg denied rumors that ballots from
the overseas campuses will not be,
counted.
"That is absolutely incorrect. Those
ballots are due back Oct. 20, and the
first senate meeting will be scheduled
after that."
More active senate
ASSU President Vic Petroff pre
dicted that the senate "is going to be a
lot more active this year. I'm not going
to let it get too lax in what it does. We
can make it serious. This year there
will be problems that are more of a
challenge than the bonfire and the
mascot." Those problems might in
clude such issues as tenure, he indi
cated.
Students will also be voting for
members of the SCLC. Eight persons
are running for the three council seats,
Berg said.
Petroff said that the SCLC has been
active in the past year comparing raw
data on students' and faculty mem
bers' attitudes towards theHonor Code
in 1961 and in 1975.
Little difference from 1961
The 1975 questionnaire results
showed very little difference com
pared to the 1961 questionnaire, Pet
roff said. The results were the "same to
better. Still it wasn't good," he said.
Petroff expects that the Honor Code
will come under question, and that
suggestions of abolishing the system
and replacing it with proctoring
methods mav occur this year. How
ever, Petroff said, he felt an abolish
ment of the Honor Code would be "un
fortunate."
Petroff expected this year's SCLC
would be busy with compiling and
analyzing the raw data from the com
parison.
Berg predicted that with the large
number of people running for office,
there would probably be a good turn
out at the polls. "It depends on the
weather," he admitted.
Students may vote from 10 a.m. to 2
p.m. Wednesday and Thursday at Es
condido Village on the corner of Cam
pus and Escondido, the history corner,
the business school and the physics
tank. The Escondido polling place will
be closed in case of rain since it has no
shelter.
The polls at the Post Office and en
gineering corner will be open from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. both days.
