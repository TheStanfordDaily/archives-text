No vandalism
On September 28, 1976, the
members of United Stanford
Employees (USE) Local 680
voted by a slim margin not to
authorize a strike. As 62 per cent
voted to authorize the strike it is
obvious that the 50 per cent ac
ceptance vote necessary to ac
cept the University's offer is
lacking.
During the period this condi
tion is in effect there exists un
rest and dissatisfaction among
the Union rank and file.
However, USE does not au
thorize or condone any act of an
illegal nature. Anyone commit
ting acts of vandalism, sabotage,
or theft against the university is
liable for criminal prosecution
and thus beyond the protection
of USE and Union contract pro
visions.
USE would further point out
that such acts do nothing to
strengthen our position and
could cause adverse feeling
within the Stanford community,
which could damage our con
tract struggle.
In order that no disrepute be
attached to USE and its mem
bers, USE asks that all members
use utmost discretion in the
methods employed to express
their dissatisfaction with Uni
versity management.
