# ASSU Senate candidates announce platforms
## 
### 
R. B. Campbell
The interests of graduate stu
dents are allegedly served by
several organizations including
the ASSU Senate, the Craduate
Student Council, the Escondido
Village Council for those who, as
myself, live in Escondido Vil
lage, and occasionally organiza
tions such as STREU when frust
ration with the extant associa
tions reaches a high level.
I intend to discover and pub
licize what the senate can and
should do for graduate students.
Naturally, one of my major con
cerns will be graduate students
living on campus, single as well
as married.

student majoring in mathema
tics.)
Ben Karlin
If elected to the ASSU Se
nate, I will work for several
specific proposals, which in
clude: 1. Putting recycling con
tainers in dorms and fraternities
to save the thousands of Duilys
and other papers thrown away
every day. The money gained
from such a recycling effort

could be poured into the ASSU
treasury. 2. Senators should be
required to visit house meetings
to find out student opinions and
tell the students what the senate
is doing.
Even if the senate only ac
complished these projects, it
would be more than they have
done in the past, and would be
better than spending its time ar
guing over resolutions about ir
relevant issues.
So a vote for Ben Karlin is a
vote for an active senate.
(Ben Karlin is a sophomore
majoring in political science.)
Tom Long
Two issues are central in my
campaign:
1) I favor a voting student
member on the Board of Trus
tees. Although the board's claim
that students constitute a vested
interest is true, a quick glance at
the board members' professions
confirms their own vested in
terest.
Students should be included
on the board and all major uni
versity committees.

2) The denial of Duncan I
Foley's tenure demonstrates the
need for more emphasis on <
teaching ability in tenure deci- I
sions. Professor Foley's out- I
standing record at the Mas- !
sachusetts Institute of Technol- i
ogy confirms that denial of his i
tenure was not based on teach
ing ability. I favor student boards
to help assess professor's teach
ing abilities.
I also favor:
—A student Stanford Judicial
Council majority.
—The retention of SWOPSI,
SCIRE, and Overseas Programs.
—A student decision on the
mascot issue.

Jeff Merrick
Freshmen unite!
If we freshmen unite behind
me. we will get at least some rep
resentation, at least one member
looking out for our interests.
(Jeff Merrick is u freshman.)
Stephen Valelly,
Robert Docters,
John Struthers
This slate intends, through
manning a monthly table in the
Quad and encouraging phone
calls, to actively seek out alterna
tive viewpoints on ASSU Senate
matters. Concerning current
problems facing this university,
Stephen Valelly, Robert Docters
and John Struthers hold the fol

lowing positions:
1. Student advocacy. The stu
dent body and individuals have
the right to make their opinions a
factor in every university deci
sion. Through the student rep
resentation on university com
mittees, and using the senate as a
pressure group, this slate will
determinedly fight for all stu
dent interests (e.g. better hous
ing) with every means at its dis
posal.
2. Academic quality. Valelly,
Docters and Struthers will do
everything possible to remedy
the problems of the advisory sys
tem here. This system at present
works poorly in matching ad
visers with students, and gener
ally fails to be an effective source
of course and career advisory in
formation.
3. Student There are
several services only the ASSU
can effectively provide the col
lege community. We propose
such measures as the acquisition
of a WATS flat-rate long distance
phone center (which would
drastically cut the cost of
cross-country or other long dis
tance phone calls), a non-profit
record co-op such as at Berkeley,
and some inexpensive
strengthening of existing ser
vices (e.g. ASSU note-taking for
more classes).
4. Money. This university is
run inefficiently. As a result
there is an increasing financial

burden on the students, we are
paying more and getting less.
Above all, Valelly, Docters and
Struthers pledge to apply pres
sure to the administration to set
itself in better order. Our pro
posals (on our posters) will
begin to see that the massive
waste is stopped.
(Stephen Valelly is a senior
majoring in history. Robert Doc
ters and John Struthers are
sophomores.)
Dave Dick
Now is the time for the ASSU
Senate to take charge of the
major issues in the university
community. The senate itself
desperately needs reform. Stu
dents must be given input into
the tenure process. We must
have access to the Board of Trus
tees and the Stanford Judicial
Council is a disgrace.
Hut the senate requires active
leadership to see that these areas
are effectively addressed. A
major reason for the senate's past
ineffectiveness has been the lack
of such leadership.
This poses a serious dilemma.
The administration will not re
spect a student representative
organization that the students
themselves don't respect. The
students won't respect a senate
that replaces leadership with
special interest politics.
Thus, a potentially effective
-.senate is obstructed by its own
inept members. The senate
needs a leader. Now is the
time...vote Dave Dick.
(Dave Dick is a junior.)
Caroline "C.8." Barron
It is time now to end the indo
lence and childish partisanship
which have afflicted the ASSU
Senate and rendered it almost
completely ineffective.
Many of the issues which will

face the new senate, including
reform of the senate itself, have
been broached within the cur
rent campaigns.
While such apparent com
munity concern is indeed ad
mirable, in order to be meaning
ful, the desire for progressive
change must go beyond October
13 and 14.
The senate must resume its
role as both a source of represen
tative student input and a
decision-maker on issues affect
ing the daily lives and educa
tions of aII Stanford students.
For my part, when elected, 1
will make every effort to exer
cise fair judgment, to pursue re
sponsibility actively and to

work, for an effective senate that
will serve the interests of the en
tire Stanford community.

Dan Livingston, Rick Morrow,
Dave Sharp
Last year, students elected a
ASSU Senate majority who ran
on fuzzy, unclear issues and
consequently were loyal to no
one but themselves.
This year, Dan Livingston,
Rick Morrow and Dave Sharp are
offering the students a clear
choice. They have specifically ex
pressed their opposition to the
I)e|t 1 louse expulsion from cam
ipus. the use of student funds to
hire guest professors of only one
narrow viewpoint and to the
threatened suspension of Band
leaders for performing in Meyer
Library.
They have promised not to
oppose the Big Game Bonfire,
supported reform of senate pro
cedures and advocated more ex
tensive use of referendums to let
the students themselves decide
major issues instead of the se
nate "elite."
These are not vague terms.
They are specific issues which
all students should be concerned
about. Livingston, Morrow and
Sharp have shown you where
they stand and ask you to join
them. Wednesday, your voice
gets heard.
I Dan Livingston is a sopho
more. Hick Morrow and Dave
Sharp are seniors majoring in
economics.)
Terry Ross
I freely admit that because I am
a freshman 1 have little experi
ence. However, I contend that it
is the "experienced" campus
politicos who have brought tri
viality into the senate, have
brought stagnation to student
government, and have made our
seuate a laughing stock.
Freshman is the best adjective
to describe my candidacy. I will
bring to the senate a fresh out
look possible only from a

freshman. When elected, 1 will
work in our senate for the issues
directly affecting the students —
urgently needed bike traffic reg
ulation, greater equal rights for
women on campus, justice for al 1
students (remember our Band?),
the holding down of tuition,
major parking reform (ever get a
ticket?).
1 will deliver the common
sense representation we need so
badly.
(Terry Ross is a freshman.)
Pete Moscatelli
Hi!
My name is Fete Moscatelli.
I'm a new, first year graduate
sti/dent in the mechanical en
gineering department. I would
like to represent the graduate
students in the ASSU Senate.
So far, for the most part, I am
pleased with what I've seen here.
But no system is perfect, and
there are situations in this cam
pus community that need im
proving: parking — the changes
that are being made are at the
cost of the students, in money
and convenience. The students
should have more input here; the
big hike ripoff — the possibility
of fenced-in areas at frequent
night time parking spots should
be investigated; bookstore
textbook prices — this is a
monopolistic situation, again at
the cost of the students.
I would very much appreciate
your support this week.

Beth Kerttula
Margaret Sampson
Many important issues are fac
ing Stanford students. The
honor code is under critical at
tack and needs to be updated, the
students' role in judicial proce
dures is precarious, womens'
sports are lagging, and our over
seas programs are in dire need of
student support. Last year the
ASSU was ineffective. Indi
vidual opinions stifled meaning
ful work, and ridiculous banter
proliferated. Beth Kerttula and
Margaret Sampson aren't in
terested in the ASSU as a soap
box for their own special in
terests. Their goal is to get stu
dent input on important issues,
and to act upon it. They have
planned on holding office hours
at least one day a week in the
ASSU lounge. They realize tha4
if elected they are your contact
with decision-making. We hope
you'll vote for Beth Kerttula and
Margaret Sampson. They'll be
accessible, and they'll work.
(Beth Kerttula is a junior
majoring in history and English.
Margaret Sampson is a junior
majoring in international rela
tions.)
