## UCLA steals game from Cards, 38-20 Interceptions cost Cards a win 
### Chris Baker 
Los Angeles — Stanford, a
team which lives by the pass,
died by the pass Saturday night
as the Coliseum Cobra struck
again.
Only this time, there weren't
any last-second UCLA kicking
heroics. Instead, it was a final
quarter which saw the Bruin de
fense pick off four Guy Benjamin
passes and recover an airborne
fumble, turning a 20-10 Card
lead into a 38-20 Bruin shocker.
Benjamin, who completed 35
of 54 passes for 378 yards and
two touchdowns, picked apart
the UCLA defense for three quar
ters as Stanford rolled to a 10-
point lead.
"When Stanford got a lead on
us in the third quarter," said
Bruin coach Terry Donahue, "I
was preparing my speech for you
guys (the press)."
UCLA linebackers Raymond
Murks and Jerry Robinson helped

make Donahue's planned post
game remarks as useless as the
first two presidential debates.
Burks scores
Burks, a converted tight-end,
intercepted a perfect Benjamin
spiral and raced 25 yards into the
end-zone in the opening mi
nutes of the fourth quarter. The
ball bounced out of reserve
tight-end Dave Strong's not-so
strong hands.
The theft, which cut Stan
ford's lead to three points at
20-17, inspired the Bruin de
fense and a partisan Colisum
crowd of 50,894.
"The UCLA fans tonight were
the best that I've ever heard in
my five years here at UCLA as a
coach," said Donahue. "We had
a definite home field advan
tage."
Long run
After that nothing seemed to
go right for Stanford. Robinson
capped off the game with a 78-

yard touchdown after he had in
tercepted the ball on a deflection
off flanker Tony Hill. It only
helped the Bruins beat the 16-
point spread.
Safety Mike Coulter helped
the Bruins beat Stanford though.
Coulter picked off another Ben
jamin pass after linebacker Frank
Stephens had tipped it to set up
the go-ahead touchdown by
quarterback Jeff Dankworth.
After two running plays by
Theotis Brown moved the ball
down to the Stanford 22,
Dankworth called a quarterback
sneak and raced into the end
zone to put the Bruins ahead for
good at 24-20.
But the horrors were really just
beginning for the star-struck
Cards. Benjamin, with two pas
ses to split end Bill Kellar,
moved the ball down to the
UCLA 42.
The Stanford offensive line
did an excellent job of protecting
Benjamin most of the game. But
Stephens managed to slip into
the backfield and blind-side
Benjamin. The ball popped loose
and defensive tackle Fete Fele
recovered it in mid-air.
The strange play set up
Brown's second touchdown of
the night and killed any hopes
for a Stanford comeback.
Robinson's interception and
touchdown return simply
finished off Stanford. Approp
riately enough, Benjamin's final
pass of the game was tipped by
running back Dave Tenn and in
tercepted by linebacker Lou
Mascola as the gun sounded.
'Emotionally prepared'
"1 don't think there was any
question our boys were well

prepared emotionally," said
Stanford coach Jack Christian
sen in the visitors' dungeon after
the game.
"We played a passing game
and it's true that a lot of bad
things can happen when you put
the ball in the air," said a de
jected Christiansen. "All 1 can
say is that it's most unfortunate
when passes bounce off your re
ceivers' shoulder pads and are
picked off by the other team."
The disastrous final period
wrecked the three best quarters
Stanford has played all year and
excellent individual perfor

mances by Hill and Benjamin.
Hill, who caught nine passes
for 166 yards and two
touchdowns, moved past Gene
Washington into first place on
the Stanford career receiving
chart with 1806 yards.
Moves up
He also moved ahead of former
Stanford Ail-American Chris
Burford in career receptions with
112 catches. Hill needs just 11
grabs to break Washington's 122
mark. The senior from Long
Beach is just one touchdown be
hind Bill McColl's career mark of
14.
Coming into the contest,
UCLA had given up just 36
points in getting off to its best
start since 1969. Stanford was
the first team to score more than
10 points on the Bruins this year.
The Cards also rolled up more
yardage in the air (382) than the
Bruins had allowed all season
(328). And Benjamin completed
more passes than UCLA had
given up in rolling to its third
place ranking.
Benjamin engineered two

beautiful touchdown drives and
another drive which would have
given the Cards a 23-10 lead if
the Stanford offensive line
hadn't been detected holding.
In the first quarter, the Stan
ford offense was so good that
Mike Michel didn't have to punt
once.
Benjamin completed his first
two passes of the game, but the
Cards had to settle for a 47-yard
Michel field goal after the drive
stalled.
UCLA equalized things on
Frank Corral's 43-yard field goal,
and then took a 10-3 lead after
Benjamin threw his first inter
ception of the night.
The third-year quarterback
was superb on the Cards' next
series as they marched 92 yards
to tie the contest. Benjamin was
five-for-five on that drive.
Hill romps
His best play was a 23-yard
pass to Hill, who grabbed the
ball in front of a Bruin defender
and danced 34 more yards into
the end-zone. That knotted the
score at 10-10 as the lights were

turned out for the Bruin halftime
flashlight stunts.
Maybe Stanford should pre
tend that every series is the first
of a half. Benjamin marched the
Cards 80 yards for a touchdown
to open the second half. The six
points came on Hill's second
touchdown, a simple 20-yard
slant-in.
Stanford, which went the en
tire first period without a pen
alty, wasn't as lucky in the third
quarter. An eight-yard
touchdown pass to tight-end
Mark Hoaglin was nullified by a
holding penalty and Stanford
was forced to settle for a 20-yard
field goal.
And then the Bruins headed
Stanford off at the pass.
The Cards led UCLA in almost
every statistical category except
rushing. But stats are only for
losers.

team which lives by the pass,
died by the pass Saturday night
as the Coliseum Cobra struck
again.
Only this time, there weren't
any last-second UCLA kicking
heroics. Instead, it was a final
quarter which saw the Bruin de
fense pick off four Guy Benjamin
passes and recover an airborne
fumble, turning a 20-10 Card
lead into a 38-20 Bruin shocker.
Benjamin, who completed 35
of 54 passes for 378 yards and
two touchdowns, picked apart
the UCLA defense for three quar
ters as Stanford rolled to a 10-
point lead.
"When Stanford got a lead on
us in the third quarter," said
Bruin coach Terry Donahue, "I
was preparing my speech for you
guys (the press)."
UCLA linebackers Raymond
Murks and Jerry Robinson helped

make Donahue's planned post
game remarks as useless as the
first two presidential debates.
Burks scores
Burks, a converted tight-end,
intercepted a perfect Benjamin
spiral and raced 25 yards into the
end-zone in the opening mi
nutes of the fourth quarter. The
ball bounced out of reserve
tight-end Dave Strong's not-so
strong hands.
The theft, which cut Stan
ford's lead to three points at
20-17, inspired the Bruin de
fense and a partisan Colisum
crowd of 50,894.
"The UCLA fans tonight were
the best that I've ever heard in
my five years here at UCLA as a
coach," said Donahue. "We had
a definite home field advan
tage."
Long run
After that nothing seemed to
go right for Stanford. Robinson
capped off the game with a 78-

yard touchdown after he had in
tercepted the ball on a deflection
off flanker Tony Hill. It only
helped the Bruins beat the 16-
point spread.
Safety Mike Coulter helped
the Bruins beat Stanford though.
Coulter picked off another Ben
jamin pass after linebacker Frank
Stephens had tipped it to set up
the go-ahead touchdown by
quarterback Jeff Dankworth.
After two running plays by
Theotis Brown moved the ball
down to the Stanford 22,
Dankworth called a quarterback
sneak and raced into the end
zone to put the Bruins ahead for
good at 24-20.
But the horrors were really just
beginning for the star-struck
Cards. Benjamin, with two pas
ses to split end Bill Kellar,
moved the ball down to the
UCLA 42.
The Stanford offensive line
did an excellent job of protecting
Benjamin most of the game. But
Stephens managed to slip into
the backfield and blind-side
Benjamin. The ball popped loose
and defensive tackle Fete Fele
recovered it in mid-air.
The strange play set up
Brown's second touchdown of
the night and killed any hopes
for a Stanford comeback.
Robinson's interception and
touchdown return simply
finished off Stanford. Approp
riately enough, Benjamin's final
pass of the game was tipped by
running back Dave Tenn and in
tercepted by linebacker Lou
Mascola as the gun sounded.
'Emotionally prepared'
"1 don't think there was any
question our boys were well

prepared emotionally," said
Stanford coach Jack Christian
sen in the visitors' dungeon after
the game.
"We played a passing game
and it's true that a lot of bad
things can happen when you put
the ball in the air," said a de
jected Christiansen. "All 1 can
say is that it's most unfortunate
when passes bounce off your re
ceivers' shoulder pads and are
picked off by the other team."
The disastrous final period
wrecked the three best quarters
Stanford has played all year and
excellent individual perfor

mances by Hill and Benjamin.
Hill, who caught nine passes
for 166 yards and two
touchdowns, moved past Gene
Washington into first place on
the Stanford career receiving
chart with 1806 yards.
Moves up
He also moved ahead of former
Stanford Ail-American Chris
Burford in career receptions with
112 catches. Hill needs just 11
grabs to break Washington's 122
mark. The senior from Long
Beach is just one touchdown be
hind Bill McColl's career mark of
14.
Coming into the contest,
UCLA had given up just 36
points in getting off to its best
start since 1969. Stanford was
the first team to score more than
10 points on the Bruins this year.
The Cards also rolled up more
yardage in the air (382) than the
Bruins had allowed all season
(328). And Benjamin completed
more passes than UCLA had
given up in rolling to its third
place ranking.
Benjamin engineered two

beautiful touchdown drives and
another drive which would have
given the Cards a 23-10 lead if
the Stanford offensive line
hadn't been detected holding.
In the first quarter, the Stan
ford offense was so good that
Mike Michel didn't have to punt
once.
Benjamin completed his first
two passes of the game, but the
Cards had to settle for a 47-yard
Michel field goal after the drive
stalled.
UCLA equalized things on
Frank Corral's 43-yard field goal,
and then took a 10-3 lead after
Benjamin threw his first inter
ception of the night.
The third-year quarterback
was superb on the Cards' next
series as they marched 92 yards
to tie the contest. Benjamin was
five-for-five on that drive.
Hill romps
His best play was a 23-yard
pass to Hill, who grabbed the
ball in front of a Bruin defender
and danced 34 more yards into
the end-zone. That knotted the
score at 10-10 as the lights were

turned out for the Bruin halftime
flashlight stunts.
Maybe Stanford should pre
tend that every series is the first
of a half. Benjamin marched the
Cards 80 yards for a touchdown
to open the second half. The six
points came on Hill's second
touchdown, a simple 20-yard
slant-in.
Stanford, which went the en
tire first period without a pen
alty, wasn't as lucky in the third
quarter. An eight-yard
touchdown pass to tight-end
Mark Hoaglin was nullified by a
holding penalty and Stanford
was forced to settle for a 20-yard
field goal.
And then the Bruins headed
Stanford off at the pass.
The Cards led UCLA in almost
every statistical category except
rushing. But stats are only for
losers.

as the Coliseum Cobra struck
again.
Only this time, there weren't
any last-second UCLA kicking
heroics. Instead, it was a final
quarter which saw the Bruin de
fense pick off four Guy Benjamin
passes and recover an airborne
fumble, turning a 20-10 Card
lead into a 38-20 Bruin shocker.
Benjamin, who completed 35
of 54 passes for 378 yards and
two touchdowns, picked apart
the UCLA defense for three quar
ters as Stanford rolled to a 10-
point lead.
"When Stanford got a lead on
us in the third quarter," said
Bruin coach Terry Donahue, "I
was preparing my speech for you
guys (the press)."
UCLA linebackers Raymond
Murks and Jerry Robinson helped

make Donahue's planned post
game remarks as useless as the
first two presidential debates.
Burks scores
Burks, a converted tight-end,
intercepted a perfect Benjamin
spiral and raced 25 yards into the
end-zone in the opening mi
nutes of the fourth quarter. The
ball bounced out of reserve
tight-end Dave Strong's not-so
strong hands.
The theft, which cut Stan
ford's lead to three points at
20-17, inspired the Bruin de
fense and a partisan Colisum
crowd of 50,894.
"The UCLA fans tonight were
the best that I've ever heard in
my five years here at UCLA as a
coach," said Donahue. "We had
a definite home field advan
tage."
Long run
After that nothing seemed to
go right for Stanford. Robinson
capped off the game with a 78-

yard touchdown after he had in
tercepted the ball on a deflection
off flanker Tony Hill. It only
helped the Bruins beat the 16-
point spread.
Safety Mike Coulter helped
the Bruins beat Stanford though.
Coulter picked off another Ben
jamin pass after linebacker Frank
Stephens had tipped it to set up
the go-ahead touchdown by
quarterback Jeff Dankworth.
After two running plays by
Theotis Brown moved the ball
down to the Stanford 22,
Dankworth called a quarterback
sneak and raced into the end
zone to put the Bruins ahead for
good at 24-20.
But the horrors were really just
beginning for the star-struck
Cards. Benjamin, with two pas
ses to split end Bill Kellar,
moved the ball down to the
UCLA 42.
The Stanford offensive line
did an excellent job of protecting
Benjamin most of the game. But
Stephens managed to slip into
the backfield and blind-side
Benjamin. The ball popped loose
and defensive tackle Fete Fele
recovered it in mid-air.
The strange play set up
Brown's second touchdown of
the night and killed any hopes
for a Stanford comeback.
Robinson's interception and
touchdown return simply
finished off Stanford. Approp
riately enough, Benjamin's final
pass of the game was tipped by
running back Dave Tenn and in
tercepted by linebacker Lou
Mascola as the gun sounded.
'Emotionally prepared'
"1 don't think there was any
question our boys were well

prepared emotionally," said
Stanford coach Jack Christian
sen in the visitors' dungeon after
the game.
"We played a passing game
and it's true that a lot of bad
things can happen when you put
the ball in the air," said a de
jected Christiansen. "All 1 can
say is that it's most unfortunate
when passes bounce off your re
ceivers' shoulder pads and are
picked off by the other team."
The disastrous final period
wrecked the three best quarters
Stanford has played all year and
excellent individual perfor

mances by Hill and Benjamin.
Hill, who caught nine passes
for 166 yards and two
touchdowns, moved past Gene
Washington into first place on
the Stanford career receiving
chart with 1806 yards.
Moves up
He also moved ahead of former
Stanford Ail-American Chris
Burford in career receptions with
112 catches. Hill needs just 11
grabs to break Washington's 122
mark. The senior from Long
Beach is just one touchdown be
hind Bill McColl's career mark of
14.
Coming into the contest,
UCLA had given up just 36
points in getting off to its best
start since 1969. Stanford was
the first team to score more than
10 points on the Bruins this year.
The Cards also rolled up more
yardage in the air (382) than the
Bruins had allowed all season
(328). And Benjamin completed
more passes than UCLA had
given up in rolling to its third
place ranking.
Benjamin engineered two

beautiful touchdown drives and
another drive which would have
given the Cards a 23-10 lead if
the Stanford offensive line
hadn't been detected holding.
In the first quarter, the Stan
ford offense was so good that
Mike Michel didn't have to punt
once.
Benjamin completed his first
two passes of the game, but the
Cards had to settle for a 47-yard
Michel field goal after the drive
stalled.
UCLA equalized things on
Frank Corral's 43-yard field goal,
and then took a 10-3 lead after
Benjamin threw his first inter
ception of the night.
The third-year quarterback
was superb on the Cards' next
series as they marched 92 yards
to tie the contest. Benjamin was
five-for-five on that drive.
Hill romps
His best play was a 23-yard
pass to Hill, who grabbed the
ball in front of a Bruin defender
and danced 34 more yards into
the end-zone. That knotted the
score at 10-10 as the lights were

turned out for the Bruin halftime
flashlight stunts.
Maybe Stanford should pre
tend that every series is the first
of a half. Benjamin marched the
Cards 80 yards for a touchdown
to open the second half. The six
points came on Hill's second
touchdown, a simple 20-yard
slant-in.
Stanford, which went the en
tire first period without a pen
alty, wasn't as lucky in the third
quarter. An eight-yard
touchdown pass to tight-end
Mark Hoaglin was nullified by a
holding penalty and Stanford
was forced to settle for a 20-yard
field goal.
And then the Bruins headed
Stanford off at the pass.
The Cards led UCLA in almost
every statistical category except
rushing. But stats are only for
losers.

any last-second UCLA kicking
heroics. Instead, it was a final
quarter which saw the Bruin de
fense pick off four Guy Benjamin
passes and recover an airborne
fumble, turning a 20-10 Card
lead into a 38-20 Bruin shocker.
Benjamin, who completed 35
of 54 passes for 378 yards and
two touchdowns, picked apart
the UCLA defense for three quar
ters as Stanford rolled to a 10-
point lead.
"When Stanford got a lead on
us in the third quarter," said
Bruin coach Terry Donahue, "I
was preparing my speech for you
guys (the press)."
UCLA linebackers Raymond
Murks and Jerry Robinson helped

make Donahue's planned post
game remarks as useless as the
first two presidential debates.
Burks scores
Burks, a converted tight-end,
intercepted a perfect Benjamin
spiral and raced 25 yards into the
end-zone in the opening mi
nutes of the fourth quarter. The
ball bounced out of reserve
tight-end Dave Strong's not-so
strong hands.
The theft, which cut Stan
ford's lead to three points at
20-17, inspired the Bruin de
fense and a partisan Colisum
crowd of 50,894.
"The UCLA fans tonight were
the best that I've ever heard in
my five years here at UCLA as a
coach," said Donahue. "We had
a definite home field advan
tage."
Long run
After that nothing seemed to
go right for Stanford. Robinson
capped off the game with a 78-

yard touchdown after he had in
tercepted the ball on a deflection
off flanker Tony Hill. It only
helped the Bruins beat the 16-
point spread.
Safety Mike Coulter helped
the Bruins beat Stanford though.
Coulter picked off another Ben
jamin pass after linebacker Frank
Stephens had tipped it to set up
the go-ahead touchdown by
quarterback Jeff Dankworth.
After two running plays by
Theotis Brown moved the ball
down to the Stanford 22,
Dankworth called a quarterback
sneak and raced into the end
zone to put the Bruins ahead for
good at 24-20.
But the horrors were really just
beginning for the star-struck
Cards. Benjamin, with two pas
ses to split end Bill Kellar,
moved the ball down to the
UCLA 42.
The Stanford offensive line
did an excellent job of protecting
Benjamin most of the game. But
Stephens managed to slip into
the backfield and blind-side
Benjamin. The ball popped loose
and defensive tackle Fete Fele
recovered it in mid-air.
The strange play set up
Brown's second touchdown of
the night and killed any hopes
for a Stanford comeback.
Robinson's interception and
touchdown return simply
finished off Stanford. Approp
riately enough, Benjamin's final
pass of the game was tipped by
running back Dave Tenn and in
tercepted by linebacker Lou
Mascola as the gun sounded.
'Emotionally prepared'
"1 don't think there was any
question our boys were well

prepared emotionally," said
Stanford coach Jack Christian
sen in the visitors' dungeon after
the game.
"We played a passing game
and it's true that a lot of bad
things can happen when you put
the ball in the air," said a de
jected Christiansen. "All 1 can
say is that it's most unfortunate
when passes bounce off your re
ceivers' shoulder pads and are
picked off by the other team."
The disastrous final period
wrecked the three best quarters
Stanford has played all year and
excellent individual perfor

mances by Hill and Benjamin.
Hill, who caught nine passes
for 166 yards and two
touchdowns, moved past Gene
Washington into first place on
the Stanford career receiving
chart with 1806 yards.
Moves up
He also moved ahead of former
Stanford Ail-American Chris
Burford in career receptions with
112 catches. Hill needs just 11
grabs to break Washington's 122
mark. The senior from Long
Beach is just one touchdown be
hind Bill McColl's career mark of
14.
Coming into the contest,
UCLA had given up just 36
points in getting off to its best
start since 1969. Stanford was
the first team to score more than
10 points on the Bruins this year.
The Cards also rolled up more
yardage in the air (382) than the
Bruins had allowed all season
(328). And Benjamin completed
more passes than UCLA had
given up in rolling to its third
place ranking.
Benjamin engineered two

beautiful touchdown drives and
another drive which would have
given the Cards a 23-10 lead if
the Stanford offensive line
hadn't been detected holding.
In the first quarter, the Stan
ford offense was so good that
Mike Michel didn't have to punt
once.
Benjamin completed his first
two passes of the game, but the
Cards had to settle for a 47-yard
Michel field goal after the drive
stalled.
UCLA equalized things on
Frank Corral's 43-yard field goal,
and then took a 10-3 lead after
Benjamin threw his first inter
ception of the night.
The third-year quarterback
was superb on the Cards' next
series as they marched 92 yards
to tie the contest. Benjamin was
five-for-five on that drive.
Hill romps
His best play was a 23-yard
pass to Hill, who grabbed the
ball in front of a Bruin defender
and danced 34 more yards into
the end-zone. That knotted the
score at 10-10 as the lights were

turned out for the Bruin halftime
flashlight stunts.
Maybe Stanford should pre
tend that every series is the first
of a half. Benjamin marched the
Cards 80 yards for a touchdown
to open the second half. The six
points came on Hill's second
touchdown, a simple 20-yard
slant-in.
Stanford, which went the en
tire first period without a pen
alty, wasn't as lucky in the third
quarter. An eight-yard
touchdown pass to tight-end
Mark Hoaglin was nullified by a
holding penalty and Stanford
was forced to settle for a 20-yard
field goal.
And then the Bruins headed
Stanford off at the pass.
The Cards led UCLA in almost
every statistical category except
rushing. But stats are only for
losers.
