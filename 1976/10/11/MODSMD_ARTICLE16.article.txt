# Pac-8 roundup
## Bell sets rush record 
### Marko Fong 
The Pacific-8 Conference tried
an experiment Saturday. At
tempting to make its football
games safe for viewing by car
diac cases, the league played
three games with a minimum of
excitement. Thus, there were no
last second thrillers, no stunning
upsets, not even a merciless
slaughter. The only interesting
aspects of Saturday's games
were some impressive indi
vidual performances.
In Pullman, Wash., 11th
ranked USC scored nine points
in the fourth quarter to beat
Washington State 23-14. Tail
back Kicky Bell, USC's answer to
Frank Shorter, did some

Marathon running of his own as
he carried 51 times for 346 yards,
both Pac-8 records. The NCAA
single game rushing record is
held by Michigan State's Eric
Allen at 350 yards.
The Cougars might find some
solace in Bell's statistics. They
did, after all, tackle him 49
times, which must also be a
Pac-8 record.
Trojan quarterback Vince
Evans, who can toss a chest-high
pass 60 yards downfield, but has
the aggravating habit of doing it
every time he throws, managed
to take five yards off one toss and
connect with Shelton Diggs for a
55-yard touchdown.
In Berkeley, the California

Bears hibernated through a game
with Oregon, but won anyway,
27-10. Cal's All-American can
didates, quarterback Joe Koth
and flanker Wesley Walker,
woke up in the second half to
pad their credentials. Roth went
18-28 for 208 yards with two
TDs, and Walker caught his
22nd career touchdown pass for
his third Cal receiving record.
In the Pac-B's nebbish game of
the week, Washington helped
Oregon State keep its winless
streak at five games for the year
behind freshman tailback )oe
Steele's two touchdowns.
Beaver coach Craig Fertig prob
ably wishes he could go back to
USC.
