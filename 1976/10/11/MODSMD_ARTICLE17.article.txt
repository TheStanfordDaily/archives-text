Field hockey
The Stanford field hockey
team was hot in more ways than
one this weekend during a pre
season tournament at UC-Davis.
Temperatures in the 90 s failed
to stifle the scotchers, as they out
fielded UC-Davis l-o,Hayward
State 1-0, and De Anza 3-2.
A battle with Chico State

ended in a tie, 1-1. Stanford will
meet all teams but De Anza again
in the regular conference play.
The Card women's only loss
was to non-conference Simon
Eraser, 1-0, a Canadian team
with a year-round hockey prog
ram.
The Card junior varsity lost to
the Chico State and Sacramento

varsity teams, 2-0 and 3-0, re
spectively.
Cross country
In their best showing of the
season, Stanford's harriers
finished third Saturday in an
11-team field at the Aggie Invita
tional at the University of Davis.
The Cardinals also placed
third a week ago in the Fresno
State Invitational, but this
weekend the Cardinals trailed
second-place California by just
one point. Fresno State, with five
runners in the top ten, won the
race with a low score of 39. The
Colden Bears had a score of 95
and the Cardinals, 86.
Senior Jeff Norton paced Stan
ford's runners with a fast-closing
fourth-place finish of 24:40.
Sophmore Jerry Emory also
finished in under 25 minutes
with a 14th place 24:58.
For the third consecutive
weekend, Stanford's Ann
Thrupp won the women's race
easily as she breezed to a 16:17
victory on the women's sub
three-mile course.
