# Guy Benjamin: 'two bad breaks'
## 
### Paul Bauman 
Los Angeles — "Personally, it
would be nice to win when you
play your ass off," said a solemn
Guy Benjamin after UCLA came
from behind to beat Stanford
Saturday night.
Benjamin had what was, in
some ways, his greatest day at
Stanford! and in other ways, his
most unfortunate.
The Card quarterback's 35
completions broke an all-time
Stanford record and his 378 pas
sing yards approached another.
But five weird fourth-quarter in
terceptions gave UCLA the win
and erased from Benjamin's
mind his earlier success.
When asked about his
record -brea king perfor ma nee,
Benjamin said, "I'm still think
ing about certain things. 1 ha
ven't evaluated myself yet."

Those "things" Benjamin was
contemplating were more than
likely the turnovers.
"We had a couple of bad
breaks," he said, "and the
momentum changed."
Three of the interceptions may
have been "bad breaks," but
Stanford receivers Dave Strong
and Tony Hill can take credit for
the other two. Strong let a well
thrown pass slide through his
arms into those of UCLA's Ray

Burks, and another Benjamin
pass bounced off Hill's shoulder
pads to an alert Jerry Robinson of
the Bruins.
"We gave the game to them,"
Hill said. "What else can you
say. We dropped passes and they
intercepted them, and that's just
not like our receivers. We put a
real strain on our defense."
Bruins complimentary
The consensus in the bubbly
UCLA locker room was that
Stanford is a great passing team
which relied on that phase of the
game a little too much Saturday
evening.
"Stanford played us off our
feet and they easily could have
won," said UCLA coach Terry
Donahue.
"We tried every trick in our
arsenal and they kept complet
ing passes. But when you throw
a lot, you tend to throw intercep
tions."
Bruin quarterback Jeff
Dankworth, who watched films
of last week's Stanford-Army
game, said he wasn't surprised
the Cards turned the ball over so
much.
"When you play a team like
Michigan," he said, "you expect
to earn everything you get.
Maybe we were expecting to get
some free things tonight."

"Stanford played us off our
feet and they easily could have
won," said UCLA coach Terry
Donahue.
"We tried every trick in our
arsenal and they kept complet
ing passes. But when you throw
a lot, you tend to throw intercep
tions."
Bruin quarterback Jeff
Dankworth, who watched films
of last week's Stanford-Army
game, said he wasn't surprised
the Cards turned the ball over so
much.
"When you play a team like
Michigan," he said, "you expect
to earn everything you get.
Maybe we were expecting to get
some free things tonight."
Los Angeles — "Personally, it
would be nice to win when you
play your ass off," said a solemn
Guy Benjamin after UCLA came
from behind to beat Stanford
Saturday night.
Benjamin had what was, in
some ways, his greatest day at
Stanford! and in other ways, his
most unfortunate.
The Card quarterback's 35
completions broke an all-time
Stanford record and his 378 pas
sing yards approached another.
But five weird fourth-quarter in
terceptions gave UCLA the win
and erased from Benjamin's
mind his earlier success.
When asked about his
record -brea king perfor ma nee,
Benjamin said, "I'm still think
ing about certain things. 1 ha
ven't evaluated myself yet."
Guy preoccupied
Those "things" Benjamin was
contemplating were more than
likely the turnovers.
"We had a couple of bad
breaks," he said, "and the
momentum changed."
Three of the interceptions may
have been "bad breaks," but
Stanford receivers Dave Strong
and Tony Hill can take credit for
the other two. Strong let a well
thrown pass slide through his
arms into those of UCLA's Ray

Burks, and another Benjamin
pass bounced off Hill's shoulder
pads to an alert Jerry Robinson of
the Bruins.
"We gave the game to them,"
Hill said. "What else can you
say. We dropped passes and they
intercepted them, and that's just
not like our receivers. We put a
real strain on our defense."
Bruins complimentary
The consensus in the bubbly
UCLA locker room was that
Stanford is a great passing team
which relied on that phase of the
game a little too much Saturday
evening.
"Stanford played us off our
feet and they easily could have
won," said UCLA coach Terry
Donahue.
"We tried every trick in our
arsenal and they kept complet
ing passes. But when you throw
a lot, you tend to throw intercep
