Hua gaining power in China
Tokyo — A Peking broadcast yesterday said the
Chinese army has pledged obedience to the party
Central Committee "headed by Hua Kuo-feng." a
further sign that Hua was solidifying his position as
successor to Mao Tse-tung.
There still was no formal announcement of Hua's
promotion to the party chairmanship, the post held
by Mao until his death Sept. 9.
But the official Hsinhua news agency continually
used the phrase "headed by Hua" for the Central
Committee, indicating that he is China's No. 1
leader in fact, if not yet in title.
It appeared likely the 195-member Central Com
mittee would have to endorse Hua's selection, and
there has been no report of a committee meeting
si nee Mao's death.
Foreign press reports from the Chinese capital
Saturday said wall posters disclosed Hua's eleva
tion to the posts of party chairman and chairman of
the Central Committee's military affairs commis
sion, a position also formerly held by Mao.
Irish peace leaders attacked
Belfast, Northern Ireland — The two top leaders
of the women's peace movement narrowly escaped
injury late yesterday from a club-swinging mob that
wrecked the cars they had been riding in.
Betty Williams, 32-year-old founder of the
movement, and Mairead Corrigan, 23-year-old co
leader, were rushed by the mob when they arrived
lor a meeting at a community center in a Roman
Catholic district of western Belfast.
Several hundred persons, some brandishing
clubs and sticks, were waiting outside the hall
when the women drove up in two cars.
Leaders of the peace movement in Londonderry
called a downtown rally for this afternoon to pro
test a recent surge of violence in Northern Ireland's
second-largest city.
Thai rightists rebuff Communists
Bangkok, Thailand — The right-wing military

coup here will probably mean a "freeze" in Thai
land's move toward detente with its Communist
neighbors in Indochina, but analysts do not foresee
a direct, hot confrontation.
"It is necessary to make an effort to establish good
relations with Indochinese nations," Thanat Kho
man, likely to become the new Thai foreign minis
ter. said in an interview. "But we have to keep
watching the tactics of Communist leaders. We
should not be lured or trapped diplomatically or
militarily."
Regarded by many Western diplomats as a "test
case" of a nation under Communist pressure, Thai
land is expected to strengthen its ties with members
of the non-Communist Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The new military regime took control last week
after bloody street fighting between leftist students
and police backed up by right-wingers.
Lebanese awaiting peace talks
Beirut, Lebanon — Only sporadic exchanges of
mortar and artillery fire were reported in Lebanon's
civil war yesterday as all sides awaited the resump
tion of a new round of peace talks.
Random shelling caused numerous casualties in
Beirut and its suburbs.
The peace talks resume today in the Syrian
occupied town of Chtoura in eastern Lebanon. Rep
resentatives of Lebanese President Elias Sarkis,
Syria and the Palestinian guerrilla movement are
participating.
Timber theft rises in Oregon
Portland — Timber theft has become a multi
million dollar crime wave and log lifting from fed
eral land in Oregon alone will exceed $1 million
this year, according to Sean McWeeney, acting spe
cial agent in charge of the Portland FBI office.
"It's a real racket, fast approaching the level of
organized crime," said McWeeney.
The prime target of log nabbers is old growth
Western red cedar, which the thieves can sell for

Si 51) to $500 per cord.
Timber theft investigations now represent 20 per
cent of the work load of the 75 FBI agents assigned
to Oregon, McWeenev said.
Royals and Reds win
Kansas City — Left-hander Paul Splittorff, win
less since July, came out of the bullpen and pitched
the Kansas City Royals to a 7-3 victory over the New
York Yankees last night, tying the American
League playoff series at one victory apiece.
The best-of-five series moves to New York for
Came Three tomorrow night.
Splittorff hurled shutout ball for 5% innings,
permitting just four hits as the Royals came from
behind for the victory.
Meanwhile in Philadelphia, the Phillies were try
ing to execute a pickoff play.
Instead, it was the Cincinnati Reds who picked
off the Phils 6-2 yesterday to take a commanding
2-0 lead in their National League playoff series.

Hua gaining power in China
Tokyo — A Peking broadcast yesterday said the
Chinese army has pledged obedience to the party
Central Committee "headed by Hua Kuo-feng." a
further sign that Hua was solidifying his position as
successor to Mao Tse-tung.
There still was no formal announcement of Hua's
promotion to the party chairmanship, the post held
by Mao until his death Sept. 9.
But the official Hsinhua news agency continually
used the phrase "headed by Hua" for the Central
Committee, indicating that he is China's No. 1
leader in fact, if not yet in title.
It appeared likely the 195-member Central Com
mittee would have to endorse Hua's selection, and
there has been no report of a committee meeting
si nee Mao's death.
Foreign press reports from the Chinese capital
Saturday said wall posters disclosed Hua's eleva
tion to the posts of party chairman and chairman of
the Central Committee's military affairs commis
sion, a position also formerly held by Mao.
Irish peace leaders attacked
Belfast, Northern Ireland — The two top leaders
of the women's peace movement narrowly escaped
injury late yesterday from a club-swinging mob that
wrecked the cars they had been riding in.
Betty Williams, 32-year-old founder of the
movement, and Mairead Corrigan, 23-year-old co
leader, were rushed by the mob when they arrived
lor a meeting at a community center in a Roman
Catholic district of western Belfast.
Several hundred persons, some brandishing
clubs and sticks, were waiting outside the hall
when the women drove up in two cars.
Leaders of the peace movement in Londonderry
called a downtown rally for this afternoon to pro
test a recent surge of violence in Northern Ireland's
second-largest city.
Thai rightists rebuff Communists
Bangkok, Thailand — The right-wing military

coup here will probably mean a "freeze" in Thai
land's move toward detente with its Communist
neighbors in Indochina, but analysts do not foresee
a direct, hot confrontation.
"It is necessary to make an effort to establish good
relations with Indochinese nations," Thanat Kho
man, likely to become the new Thai foreign minis
ter. said in an interview. "But we have to keep
watching the tactics of Communist leaders. We
should not be lured or trapped diplomatically or
militarily."
Regarded by many Western diplomats as a "test
case" of a nation under Communist pressure, Thai
land is expected to strengthen its ties with members
of the non-Communist Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The new military regime took control last week
after bloody street fighting between leftist students
and police backed up by right-wingers.
Lebanese awaiting peace talks
Beirut, Lebanon — Only sporadic exchanges of
mortar and artillery fire were reported in Lebanon's
civil war yesterday as all sides awaited the resump

Random shelling caused numerous casualties in
Beirut and its suburbs.
The peace talks resume today in the Syrian
occupied town of Chtoura in eastern Lebanon. Rep
resentatives of Lebanese President Elias Sarkis,
Syria and the Palestinian guerrilla movement are
participating.
Timber theft rises in Oregon
Portland — Timber theft has become a multi
million dollar crime wave and log lifting from fed
eral land in Oregon alone will exceed $1 million
this year, according to Sean McWeeney, acting spe
cial agent in charge of the Portland FBI office.
"It's a real racket, fast approaching the level of
organized crime," said McWeeney.
The prime target of log nabbers is old growth
Western red cedar, which the thieves can sell for

Si 51) to $500 per cord.
Timber theft investigations now represent 20 per
cent of the work load of the 75 FBI agents assigned
to Oregon, McWeenev said.

Hua gaining power in China
Tokyo — A Peking broadcast yesterday said the
Chinese army has pledged obedience to the party
Central Committee "headed by Hua Kuo-feng." a
further sign that Hua was solidifying his position as
successor to Mao Tse-tung.
There still was no formal announcement of Hua's
promotion to the party chairmanship, the post held
by Mao until his death Sept. 9.
But the official Hsinhua news agency continually
used the phrase "headed by Hua" for the Central
Committee, indicating that he is China's No. 1
leader in fact, if not yet in title.
It appeared likely the 195-member Central Com
mittee would have to endorse Hua's selection, and
there has been no report of a committee meeting
si nee Mao's death.
Foreign press reports from the Chinese capital
Saturday said wall posters disclosed Hua's eleva
tion to the posts of party chairman and chairman of
the Central Committee's military affairs commis
sion, a position also formerly held by Mao.
Irish peace leaders attacked
Belfast, Northern Ireland — The two top leaders
of the women's peace movement narrowly escaped
injury late yesterday from a club-swinging mob that
wrecked the cars they had been riding in.
Betty Williams, 32-year-old founder of the
movement, and Mairead Corrigan, 23-year-old co
leader, were rushed by the mob when they arrived
lor a meeting at a community center in a Roman
Catholic district of western Belfast.
Several hundred persons, some brandishing
clubs and sticks, were waiting outside the hall
when the women drove up in two cars.
Leaders of the peace movement in Londonderry
called a downtown rally for this afternoon to pro
test a recent surge of violence in Northern Ireland's
second-largest city.
Thai rightists rebuff Communists
Bangkok, Thailand — The right-wing military

coup here will probably mean a "freeze" in Thai
land's move toward detente with its Communist
neighbors in Indochina, but analysts do not foresee
a direct, hot confrontation.
"It is necessary to make an effort to establish good
relations with Indochinese nations," Thanat Kho
man, likely to become the new Thai foreign minis
ter. said in an interview. "But we have to keep
watching the tactics of Communist leaders. We
should not be lured or trapped diplomatically or
militarily."
Regarded by many Western diplomats as a "test
case" of a nation under Communist pressure, Thai
land is expected to strengthen its ties with members
of the non-Communist Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The new military regime took control last week
after bloody street fighting between leftist students
and police backed up by right-wingers.
Lebanese awaiting peace talks
Beirut, Lebanon — Only sporadic exchanges of
mortar and artillery fire were reported in Lebanon's
civil war yesterday as all sides awaited the resump
tion of a new round of peace talks.
Random shelling caused numerous casualties in
Beirut and its suburbs.
The peace talks resume today in the Syrian
occupied town of Chtoura in eastern Lebanon. Rep
resentatives of Lebanese President Elias Sarkis,
Syria and the Palestinian guerrilla movement are
participating.
Timber theft rises in Oregon
Portland — Timber theft has become a multi
million dollar crime wave and log lifting from fed
eral land in Oregon alone will exceed $1 million
this year, according to Sean McWeeney, acting spe
cial agent in charge of the Portland FBI office.
"It's a real racket, fast approaching the level of
organized crime," said McWeeney.
The prime target of log nabbers is old growth
Western red cedar, which the thieves can sell for

Si 51) to $500 per cord.
Timber theft investigations now represent 20 per
cent of the work load of the 75 FBI agents assigned
to Oregon, McWeenev said.
Royals and Reds win
Kansas City — Left-hander Paul Splittorff, win

the Kansas City Royals to a 7-3 victory over the New
York Yankees last night, tying the American
League playoff series at one victory apiece.
The best-of-five series moves to New York for
Came Three tomorrow night.
Splittorff hurled shutout ball for 5% innings,
permitting just four hits as the Royals came from
behind for the victory.
Meanwhile in Philadelphia, the Phillies were try
ing to execute a pickoff play.

2-0 lead in their National League playoff series.
