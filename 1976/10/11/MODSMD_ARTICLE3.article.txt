# Ford concentrates on Southern vote

AP Analysis
Hopes of whipping Democrat Jimmy
Carter in his native South may be lur
ing President Gerald Ford to devote
more time, money and energy to some
states than they possibly are worth,
even if he can win them.
"Sometimes 1 think I spend more
time on Florida, which has 17 electoral
votes, than California with 45," said
one strategist at the President Ford
Committee.
"I would like to see them do what
they would have to do to win some of
these states," said a Carter aide, "be
cause if they did, it would mean we
would beat them in other places that
they need a lot more."
The siren song of the South seems an
irresistible attraction for the Ford
campaign despite polls which show
him trailing by 17 to 20 percentage
points in the region.
The president's most elaborate cam
paign foray so far was a southern
swing which included a steamboat
ride down the Mississippi, a motor
cade along the Gulf coast and a major
speech in Miami.
More southern trips
Ford told Florida party officials he
would be back at least two times before
election day. Campaign officials con
firmed plans for at least one more
Florida trip and perhaps another to
southern points.
With three weeks left before Nov. 2,
any time spent wooing southern voters
means that much less time spent in the
populous industrial states which
Ford's own campaign managers have
designated as crucial to a Republican
victory.
"But if we could just bust up some of
the Carter strength in the south, even if
its only one state, and add another like
Wisconsin, that would end the neces
sity of taking one of the others." said
Ford deputy political director Norman
Watts.
Inducements for Ford
The principal inducement for Ford
in the south is the conservative pre
dilection of area voters, who have not
supported the national Democratic
ticket since 1960, and polls showing

him within striking distance of Carter
in a few target states.
An Associated Press survey of deep
Dixie states, including polling data
and interviews with campaign and
party officials and knowledgeable
political observers, confirms that the
race may be close in some areas, but
Carter remains the favorite.
Carter is solid in his home state of
Georgia and almost as strong in
Alabama. Arkansas and the border
state of Kentucky. He also is consi
dered comfortably ahead in Tennessee
and North Carolina.
