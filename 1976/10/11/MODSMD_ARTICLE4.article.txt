# Ethnic admissions
## Med school to discuss policies By Elizabeth Pollock 
### 
The Medical School's Minority Ad
missions Committee (MAC) will meet
this week to discuss whether admis
sions policies here should be changed.
Presently, applications from black,
chicano and native American applic
ants go to the special committee for
consideration. However, the Califor
nia Supreme Court ruled in Allan
Bakke v. The Regents of the University
of California that a special minority
admissions procedure at UC-Davis
Medical School was unconstitutional
on grounds of reverse racial discrimi
nation.
Admissions procedures here will be
re-examined "(if) there's enough am
biguity about whether we would for
mally be considered to be responsible
for having our admissions be compati

ble with the decision in the Bakke
case," said John Steward, associate
dean of student affairs and chairman of
the regular admissions committee at
the Medical School.
If the university were to be legally
pressured because of the Bakke deci
sion, "we would probably argue very
hard that we were not a state institu
tion," Steward said.
However, "we get lots of state funds
so it's not clear" if the decision would
affect the university, Steward said.
Senate action
Although the MAC will be examin
ing its minority admissions policies,
Steward said that "where something
gets done is in the (Medical School)
Faculty Senate."
A proposal to have the MAC handle
applications from all disadvantaged
students rather than just minority stu
dents lost by one vote when it was
submitted to the Faculty Senate last
February, Steward explained.
If the MAC decides to resubmit last
year's proposal, it could get onto the
Faculty Senate's November agenda,
said Steward.
"If we were to change our policy;
that sort of a change could take place
any time in the next six weeks and
work out for this year," Steward said.
He indicated that the topic of chang
ing minority admissions policies has
been extensively discussed in the Fa
culty Senate, so the senate might be
willing to decide the matter at one
meeting.
"1 personally was supportive of this
proposal when it went through the Fa
culty Senate last year," Steward said.
"I would like to see this sort of a
change instituted during this coming

year," he said.
Occasionally, minority students
with "advantaged" backgrounds are
referred to the regular admissions
committee, Steward said, but gave a
conservative guess that 80-90 per cent
of the minority applicants could be
ronsidered disadvantaged.
Disadvantaged considerations
"If we had a disadvantaged commit
tee (instead of the MAC), the majority
of applicants considered by that com
mittee would be minority applicants,"
Steward said.
Considerations in determining de
gree of disadvantage are:
—hours worked in the school year
—education of parents
—language spoken in the home
—parental occupation

—geographical location of home
—physical handicaps
—family responsibilities
When asked if the school could dis
regard indications of a candidate's
race on the application, Steward
answered, "We don't make up the ap
plication. We could ignore it."
However, "if I had my choice, 1
guess I would like to leave it up to the
applicant. If his or her ethnicity is an
important factor, and (he or she) would
like the committee to appreciate that
aspect of the application, I would like
the applicant to have the opportunity
to indicate it."
"It behooves us to try and learn as
much as we can about an applicant,"
Steward said.

for having our admissions be compati

ble with the decision in the Bakke
case," said John Steward, associate
dean of student affairs and chairman of
the regular admissions committee at
the Medical School.
If the university were to be legally
pressured because of the Bakke deci
sion, "we would probably argue very
hard that we were not a state institu
tion," Steward said.
However, "we get lots of state funds
so it's not clear" if the decision would
affect the university, Steward said.
Senate action
Although the MAC will be examin
ing its minority admissions policies,
Steward said that "where something
gets done is in the (Medical School)
Faculty Senate."
A proposal to have the MAC handle
applications from all disadvantaged
students rather than just minority stu
dents lost by one vote when it was
submitted to the Faculty Senate last
February, Steward explained.
If the MAC decides to resubmit last
year's proposal, it could get onto the
Faculty Senate's November agenda,
said Steward.
"If we were to change our policy;
that sort of a change could take place
any time in the next six weeks and
work out for this year," Steward said.
He indicated that the topic of chang
ing minority admissions policies has
been extensively discussed in the Fa
culty Senate, so the senate might be
willing to decide the matter at one
meeting.
"1 personally was supportive of this
proposal when it went through the Fa
culty Senate last year," Steward said.
"I would like to see this sort of a
change instituted during this coming

year," he said.
Occasionally, minority students
with "advantaged" backgrounds are
referred to the regular admissions
committee, Steward said, but gave a
conservative guess that 80-90 per cent
of the minority applicants could be
ronsidered disadvantaged.
Disadvantaged considerations
"If we had a disadvantaged commit
tee (instead of the MAC), the majority
of applicants considered by that com
mittee would be minority applicants,"
Steward said.
Considerations in determining de
gree of disadvantage are:
—hours worked in the school year
—education of parents
—language spoken in the home
—parental occupation

—geographical location of home
—physical handicaps
—family responsibilities
When asked if the school could dis
regard indications of a candidate's
race on the application, Steward
answered, "We don't make up the ap
plication. We could ignore it."
However, "if I had my choice, 1
guess I would like to leave it up to the
applicant. If his or her ethnicity is an
important factor, and (he or she) would
like the committee to appreciate that
aspect of the application, I would like
the applicant to have the opportunity
to indicate it."
"It behooves us to try and learn as
much as we can about an applicant,"
Steward said.
The Medical School's Minority Ad
missions Committee (MAC) will meet
this week to discuss whether admis
sions policies here should be changed.
Presently, applications from black,
chicano and native American applic
ants go to the special committee for
consideration. However, the Califor
nia Supreme Court ruled in Allan
Bakke v. The Regents of the University
of California that a special minority
admissions procedure at UC-Davis
Medical School was unconstitutional
on grounds of reverse racial discrimi
nation.
Admissions procedures here will be
re-examined "(if) there's enough am
biguity about whether we would for
mally be considered to be responsible
for having our admissions be compati

ble with the decision in the Bakke
case," said John Steward, associate
dean of student affairs and chairman of
