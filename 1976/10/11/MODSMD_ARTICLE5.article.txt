# Combined fire units running smoothly

The merger of the Stanford and Palo
Alto fire departments has had few
transitional problems since the city
took over Stanford's fire fighting units
Oct. 1, reported Palo Alto Fire Chief
William Korff.
"The changeover is going very
smoothly," said Korff. "Because of the
experience of the people involved, the
number of delays has been minimal.
Out of about 50 or 60 calls coming in
from Stanford, only one resulted in a
slight delay."
However, some confusion and delay
was experienced from Sept. 15, when
Palo Alto began dispatching the uni
versity's fire department, until Oct. 1,
when fire consolidation became opera
tive. Three delays of between six and
eight minutes were reported.
"These are due to mechanical
breakdowns, equipment failures and
in some cases human error." said
Korff. "But in the long run the merger
will reduce costs and improve ser
vices. And that is rare these days."
One Stanford dispatcher said she
felt Palo Alto was not sensitive to the
university's special needs.
She said that once the fire depart
ment was called when a babv gorilla

needed oxygen.
"Giving medical aid to a gorilla is
not in the contract we signed with
Stanford," said Korff. "But we did
send out our paramedic unit. There
was a short delay while we consulted
with the battalion chief and tried to
determine which size bottle of oxygen
to send."
According to the dispatcher, the fire
department here would have sent the
paramedic unit to the gorilla right
away.
The personnel transition is also
going fairly smoothly Of the 65 fire
fighters formerly employed by the
Stanford Fire Department, 37 were
hired by the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment.
Of the 14 students formerly
employed by the Stanford Fire De
partment, seven will be given
employment elsewhere if they desire
it. according to Financial Aids Direc
tor Lynn Mason. Three of the fire fight
ers are retiring and two of them did not
meet the Palo Alto standards. How
ever, four dispatchers are currently
unemployed.
Former Stanford Fire Chief Frank fu
rian will also be given another post.
