# Verbal 'fallout' hits candidates
## 
### Associated Press 
As Republican and Democratic
spokesmen each claimed yesterday
that their side holds the momentum in
the presidential campaign, President
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter con
tinued efforts to capitalize politically
on the fallout from each other's public
utterances.
Ford, winding up a vote-seeking
sidetrip to Texas after his debate with
Carter last Wednesday, won the en
dorsement of a politically-outspoken
Baptist preacher, W.A. Criswell, who
reportedly had been leaning toward
Carter before the now-famous Playboy
magazine interview in which Carter
talked about lust and adultery.
Carter continued hammering away
at Ford's remarks concerning Eastern
Europe, telling audiences in South
Bend, Ind., and other areas rich in
ethnic votes, that the communist bos
ses of Poland obviously had great in
fluence on Ford's "terribly mis
informed" concept of freedom in East
ern Europe.
The Democratic presidential
nominee said that if he wins the White
House, the United States will "do ev
erything it can to encourage freedom
in the presently dominated Eastern
European countries."
It was the refrain Carter had sounded

since Ford reaped a whirlwind of pro
test by saying in last Wednesday's de
bate that there is no Soviet domination
of Eastern Europe.
Carter's intentions
Carter said that as president he
would take steps to insure that:
— The Soviet Union complies fully
with the human rights guarantees in
the Helsinki agreement.
— The Soviet Union ceases the
jamming of Radio Free Europe and
Radio Liberty.
— There be an expanded network of
human and commercial ties because
"the legitimate hope to access from
behind the Iron Curtain must always
be open to them."
— As president he would do nothing
to accept Communist domination of
countries that want to be free.
Ford endorsement
Meanwhile, Ford was in Dallas
where the pastor of the largest congre
gation of the Southern Baptist Conven
tion endorsed his candidacy and as
sailed fellow Baptist Jimmy Carter as
Ford listened at worship services Sun
day.
"I'm for him (Ford)," Criswell told
reporters after the services, as he stood
at the president's side on the steps of
the First Baptist Church of Dallas. Ford
responded by saying he was
"gratified" by Criswell's endorsement.
The president's attendance was bil
led as non-political by presidential
aides although Ford extended his cur
rent campaign trip an extra day to be
present at Criswell's invitation.
'Playboy' interview criticized
Criswell had previously criticized
Carter for the Playboy interview in
which the Democratic presidential
candidate said he had lusted after
many women and committed adultery
in his heart, but believes God forgives
him for it.
Prior to the Playboy interview,
Criswell reportedly had been prepar
ing to endorse Carter's candidacy.
Criswell said yesterday that he and
30 other radio evangelists had met
with Ford at the White House last
month and said he was impressed with
Ford as "a president who seeks Godly
wisdom in making worldly deci
sions."
At that same meeting, he said, Ford
was asked whether he would submit to
an interview by Playboy, and his ans
wer was that he had been asked and
