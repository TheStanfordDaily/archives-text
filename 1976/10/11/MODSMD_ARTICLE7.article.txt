### Kath Scanlon 
Joss Cooney, American Independent candidate in the
12th Congressional District, said last night that he has
been prevented from talking to President Richard Lyman
in his efforts to participate in Thursday's debate here
between Paul McCloskey and David Harris.
"I've been getting the run-around at Stanford so much it
just ain't funny any more," said Cooney. "I've been climb
ing Stanford's back from Lyman's office, SWOPSI, SCOPE
(Stanford Committee on Political Education), the deans,
the lawyers..."
Cooney said that he has been forbidden to see Lyman
about the debate. "Lyman must have sicked Siena (James
Siena, legal adviser to the president) into action. He
(Siena) said there was no point in seeing Lyman, and
besides, he was very busy."
"Siena called Friday and told me I was not to go near or

approach the president's office" Cooney also said.
Lyman, asked last night if he plans to discuss the matter
with Cooney, replied, "No, I do not. I have nothing to say
to him."
Cooney said, "Lyman wants me off his back. Lyman
says, 'We subscribe to academic freedom, but we have no
control over our sponsoring groups.' "
According to Lyman, it is true that he has no control
over the sponsors of the debate (SWOPSI, SCOPE and the
Law Association).
"It's none of my business," said Lyman. I didn't issue
the invitations to the debate. It's between him and the
sponsors (if he wants to participate)."
"He has claimed, quite erroneously, that his freedom of
speech is being infringed upon. This is in no way true,"
Lyman said.
