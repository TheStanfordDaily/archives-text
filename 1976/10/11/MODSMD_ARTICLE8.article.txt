Just where does Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) stand
on the issues? Take the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA).
McCloskey is quick to denounce
repressive governments in Korea
and Chile. But does he vote to
prohibit CIA assassinations and
interference in other countries'
internal affairs? No. Why? He
says,"the amendment prohibit
ing involvement in assassina
tions was not limited to such ac
tivity; it would also have pre
vented the CIA from any activity
that might directly or indirectly
affect an election in time of
peace. I think that went too far. I
would not be opposed to the
CIA, for instance, funding op
position newspapers in a coun
try that had abolished them,
such as India."
Does the CIA usually plan
their projects in order to extend
freedom of the press to the
world? Hardly. Rabid anti
radicalism and their own dis
torted sense of America's in
terests is what determines CIA
operations.
Actually, the CIA is in the bus
iness of setting up dictatorships,
not subverting them. Iran,
Cuatemala, Brazil, Uruguay and
Chile are just some of the best
examples. McCloskey's com
ment (and vote) don't deal with
this reality.

It is ironic that McCloskey
chooses newspapers as his
example of the wonderful CIA
freedom serving operations. El
Mercurio, the largest Chilean
daily,was just such a project, and
the CIA's manipulations of its
editorial and news content is as
well-documented as it was ex
pensive. The paper played a
major role in destabilizing the
elected government of Salvador
Allende.
McCloskey may publicly
abhor the results but he does no
thing about the cause. It is the
worst form of hypocrisy.
Such a stance is not held by
David Harris, McCloskey's chal
lenger in the upcoming elec
tions. Harris will push hard to
establish effective oversight over
theCIA and get the United States
out of the dictator business.
