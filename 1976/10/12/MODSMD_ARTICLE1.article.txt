Different people release tension in different ways. Saturday, after com
pleting their Law School Admissions Test (LSATs), Marko Fong, Chris
Larkin, Derek Daley, Mike Kositch, Serry Soderberg and Annette Par-

ness burned the test in the middle of White Plaza. "Look at the test go up
in smoke," one of them commented as the fire burned down. "Just like
my hopes for law school." .
