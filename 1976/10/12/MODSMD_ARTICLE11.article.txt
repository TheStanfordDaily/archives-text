# In defense of libertarian doctrine
## 
### 
In Don Oakley's opinion col
umn in the Sept. 29 Palo Alto
Times, he discussed the plat
form and policy proposals of the
Libertarian party and its presi
dential candidate, Roger Mac-
Bride.
Oakley correctly described
Libertarians as making human
liberty the overriding value in
the political realm. In contrast,
Oakley himself would have
Americans achieve a "balance
between public need and private
freedom."
To try to decide who is correct,
interested persons would have
to learn more about what each
means and then see who makes
better sense.
Libertarians begin with the
fact that human beings possess
free will and the faculty of
reason. This and the fact that the
words "moral" and "immoral"
are really applicable only to the
uncoerced choices and actions
of individuals leads Libertarians
to defend liberty above all else in
the political realm.
Thus for Libertarians the all
important human need to be free
to make moral choices and free
to lead a morally responsible life

makes political liberty neces
sary.
Consistent program
This is where Libertarians get
a consistent program of a drastic

rollback in taxes, repealing vic
timless crime laws, strict respect
for civil liberties, a free market
economy and a non
interventionist foreign policy.
Oakley, in contrast, does not
give us a definition of public
need. One clue to Oakley's view
is the examples he gives of pos
sible opponents of the public
welfare. Oakley says that Ameri
cans quite properly fear that big
corporations, big unions and or
ganized professions will defraud
them.
To a large extent, there is no

disagreement here between Oak
ley and Libertarians. Both favor
vigorous law enforcement to
punish fraud. But Libertarians
would diverge from Oakley to
make a point about justice and
a point about historical experi
ence.
Gravity of offense
As a matter of justice, persons
should only be punished for
what they have done and in
proportion to the gravity of the
offense. Governmental regula
tions, rules, red tape and
guidelines are often punishment
of the innocent. They are bur
dens imposed in anticipation of
the possibility of future fraud.
Such preventive penalizing of
the innocent violates the sound
legal principles of punishment
only for overt acts, making the
punishment fit the crime and
treating persons as innocent
until proven guilty.
Libertarians also point to his
tory and say that special in
terests, like big corporations,
have defrauded the public
mainly by using big government
as a vehicle for their schemes.
For example, in the Progres
sive era, as historian Gabriel

Kolko has shown, lawyers for big
corporations drafted the legisla
tion that set up regulatory com
missions. These regulatory
agencies protected the percen
tage of the market held by the
big, long-established companies
and prevented the entry of new
competitors into the field.
To help interested persons de
cide who is right — Oakley or
Libertarians — Oakley should
write another column in which
he spells out clearly his idea of
public need and in which he ad
dresses Libertarians' conten
tions about justice and history.

treating persons as innocent
until proven guilty.
Libertarians also point to his
tory and say that special in
terests, like big corporations,
have defrauded the public
mainly by using big government
as a vehicle for their schemes.
For example, in the Progres
sive era, as historian Gabriel

Kolko has shown, lawyers for big
corporations drafted the legisla
tion that set up regulatory com
missions. These regulatory
agencies protected the percen
tage of the market held by the
big, long-established companies
and prevented the entry of new
competitors into the field.
To help interested persons de
cide who is right — Oakley or
Libertarians — Oakley should
write another column in which
he spells out clearly his idea of
public need and in which he ad
dresses Libertarians' conten
tions about justice and history.

In Don Oakley's opinion col
umn in the Sept. 29 Palo Alto
Times, he discussed the plat
form and policy proposals of the
Libertarian party and its presi
dential candidate, Roger Mac-
Bride.
Oakley correctly described
Libertarians as making human
liberty the overriding value in
the political realm. In contrast,
Oakley himself would have
Americans achieve a "balance
between public need and private
freedom."
To try to decide who is correct,
interested persons would have
to learn more about what each
means and then see who makes
better sense.
Libertarians begin with the
fact that human beings possess
free will and the faculty of
reason. This and the fact that the
words "moral" and "immoral"
are really applicable only to the
uncoerced choices and actions
of individuals leads Libertarians
to defend liberty above all else in
the political realm.
Thus for Libertarians the all
important human need to be free
to make moral choices and free
to lead a morally responsible life

makes political liberty neces
sary.
Consistent program
This is where Libertarians get
a consistent program of a drastic

rollback in taxes, repealing vic
timless crime laws, strict respect
for civil liberties, a free market
economy and a non
interventionist foreign policy.
Oakley, in contrast, does not
give us a definition of public
need. One clue to Oakley's view
is the examples he gives of pos
sible opponents of the public
welfare. Oakley says that Ameri
cans quite properly fear that big
corporations, big unions and or
ganized professions will defraud
them.
To a large extent, there is no

disagreement here between Oak
ley and Libertarians. Both favor
vigorous law enforcement to
punish fraud. But Libertarians
would diverge from Oakley to
make a point about justice and
a point about historical experi
ence.
Gravity of offense
As a matter of justice, persons
should only be punished for
what they have done and in
proportion to the gravity of the
offense. Governmental regula
tions, rules, red tape and
guidelines are often punishment
of the innocent. They are bur
dens imposed in anticipation of
the possibility of future fraud.
Such preventive penalizing of
the innocent violates the sound
legal principles of punishment
only for overt acts, making the
punishment fit the crime and
treating persons as innocent
until proven guilty.
Libertarians also point to his
tory and say that special in
terests, like big corporations,
have defrauded the public
mainly by using big government
