Tomorrow's permits
Conversation overheard near a
Stanford staff water vending
machine in 1984:
"Hi Dave. What did you do
about bathroom permits?"
"Well, Bob, I splurged for the
full $75.00 a year and got an 'A'
bathroom permit. I can use any
bathroom on campus and 1 have
a key to unlock the soap as well."
"That sounds pretty good,
Dave, but 1 couldn't afford that. 1
got a 'B' permit for $50.00 a
year. I can use public johns at
Tresidder and Encina, but I have
to pay extra to wash my hands."
"You know, Bob, 1 wonder
what those poor slobs in the
stock room are doing."
"Well, Dave, they all got 'C'
permits, which are free but all
they get is a trench in back of
Lagunita."
"I'm certainly glad I don't
have to put up with that!"
"You know, Dave, I've always
wondered how you can afford to
get all of those various types of
'A' permits you have."
"Well, Bob, it was easy. 1 just
went down to the Credit Union
and swung an $8,500 loan. Now,
for a mere $450 a month, 1 can
take care of my parking sticker,
my bathroom permit, my
sidewalk use shoulder patch, my
office space assessment, and my
mandatory season tickets for the
football games. By the way, do
you think Coach Cordova is
going to start Jablonski or Chong
at quarterback against San
Jose?"
"1 have one more question,
Dave."
"Yeah, Bob?"
"My respiration rate is a bit on
the high side and I wonder if you
think I ought to get an 'A' or a
'B' breathing permit?"
" 'A' all the way, Bob."
"Thanks, Dave."
