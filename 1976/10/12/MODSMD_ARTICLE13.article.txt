Ignacio Lazo
As a student here I believe that
what we need most from the
ASSU Senate is responsible rep
resentation.
I make only two promises. If
elected, I will be present at every
regularly scheduled meeting. I
think that this is the least that
you should ask of any person
who wants your support
tomorrow and Thursday.
Secondly, 1 will always make
the time to be readily available to
any fellow student who has a
question about the actions of the
senate or any body responsible
to it.
My phone number appears on
all of my campaign material. It is
also listed in the directory. It is
your guarantee that you will
have at least one voice speaking
without bias on your behalf.
If you have a question on
which issues I particularly sup
port. read some of my material or
call me personally.

Shur Reese
Three similarities between the
ASSU Senate and a hero
sandwich:
1. (of course) each has its fair
share of balogna;
2. Each, if laid at rest will re
main at rest;
3. Both have that stigma
"Hero" attached.
It doesn't have to be that way.
But given the amount of cam
paign balogna distributed, the
lack of inertia once elected, and
the slightly overgrown egos of a
few senators, it is that way.
The senate needs restructur
ing. We need a senate not just
elected from a broad majority out
of 6000 students, but a senate
responsible to a specific consti
tuency.
This is what I (Shur Reese) ac
tually believe and this is what I
will work for (if it takes me four
years to do it).
Otherwise, the senate will
continue to be ineffectual.

ing in political science.)

Whereas; the administration
of Stanford University has been
unresponsive to the needs and
demands of the students, and
Whereas; student participa
tion in decisions directly affect
ing the future of their education
has been discouraged, and
Whereas; attempts at student
participation in decisions con
cerning the tenuring of profes
sors have been stifled repeatedly
by the administration, and
Whereas; the university re
fuses to allow a student to par
ticipate in the decisions of the
Board of Trustees as a voting
member, and
Whereas; students are ex
pected to pay continually in
creasing tuition costs and then
are not allowed to park outside
their own campus residences
without a university-issued
parking permit, and
Whereas; university business
dealings with repressive dic
tatorships such as Iran is an
tithetical to the principal of free
dom of expression and a dis
grace to the students of this uni
versity, and
Whereas; the ASSU Senate of
1975-76, with the poorest atten
dance record of any senate in
many years, has demonstrated
its impotence and lack of re
sponsiveness to the above-stated
needs,
Therefore be it resolved: that
the senate of the 1976-77 should
be a more conscientious,
dynamic and responsive organi
zation in all of the above-stated
areas.
It can happen. We can provide
the effort required. We are rep
resentation personified.

Bob Greqory
We need student input into
tenure decisions, well-managed
Special Events, a Human Rights
Policy and ASSU Senate reform.
These &re the problems of our

university. However, everyone
states the problems.
I admit my platform-poster is
rather verbose, but please take
time to read it. Besides listing
the problems, I have also out
lined solutions. Solutions which
I feel are realistic and imple
mentable. If you feel that my
thoughts and ideas have merit,
then help me with your vote.
Vote for Bob Gregory.

Jon Barth, Pat Hall, Barry
Parr, Roy Skogstrom,
Tom Devine, Jim King,
Jeff Stoler
The Hammer and Coffin slate
would like to address the major
issues of the campaign. We do
not avoid controversy. We sim
ply are wary of alienating poten
tial voters. Whatever you want,
we will support. Succinctly, we
will advocate the installation of
a tenured student trustee who is
guaranteed on-campus housing
and is not an "Indian" mascot.
We endorse the Stoler report
recommending benign malig
nancy. We think it would really
be nice. Damn nice. We are only
asking for tumor years, only this
time with honor and majority
support. We will set up a sub
committee to implement the
Carson Eugenics plan. That is a
real good pun, get it?
We were there at registration.
We trudged through the rain the
first week of the quarter. We
turned in our study lists late. We
are just like you. Our opponents
are not Otherwise, they would
be just like us.
If you do not vote for us, you
can ask Carole Houck to tell you
jokes come reg pack time; you
can ask the ARC to do a humor
ous radio show; you can ask the
Daily to produce the Saturday
Night Films. We do a lot for you.
We'd like to do more. Why not
let us extend post-office hours,
gain a student majority on the
Board of Trustees, base tenure
decisions on arbitrary student
whim, and build enough row
houses for all off-campus stu
dents.
Let's talk about food poison
ing. You never know if last
night's lamb curry vvill lead to a
week of dispeptic agony or even

impotence. We will force all
food service employes involved
in poisonings to lick clean the
Jordan House bathrooms.
Our other proposals include
improving communications,
more freedom and justice, and
declining to make further state
ments.
The time is right. The place is
now.

Rick Hoft
Graduate students have many
good reasons to ignore student
government. There just isn't
much time to think about stu
dent politics, especially if you
consider it is a game that has
changed very little in structure
or function since junior high
school.
I would like an effective forum
for discussion and action on
specific ways to improve our life
here. 1 am willing to put in
enough time to bring about some
changes, and I hope there are
other candidates who feel the
same way.
My name is Rick Hoft. I re
ceived a B.S. degree herein 1975
and then spent the past year
working with community action
groups in St. Louis, Mo. Now
I've returned as a first year medi
cal student with developing in
terests in politics and administ
ration.
Thanks for your considera
tion.

David Haxton
The ASSU Senate this year has
the opporunity to improve the
undergraduate education. It
should especially concern itself
with:
1. Tuition. I believe that the
student body has the right to
have its views incorporated into
every important university deci
sion. This includes the setting of
tuition.
I understand the pressures to
increase tuition, but $4275 is a
lot of money. Let's be sure on
education here is still worth if.
2. Tenure. The senate is
responsible for advocating stu

dent sentiment before the ad
ministration. 1 would like to see
more student input into tenure
decisions.
I believe that I have the neces
sary experience and enthusiasm
to be an effective senator.
Support a dependable candi
date, concerned with being an
equitable voice and responsive
to you.
Vote on Wednesday and
Thursday for David Haxton,
ASSU Senate.

ing in mechanical engineering.)
Joe Sweeney
The ASSU Senate faced two
great problems last year. First of
all, many senators, while run
ning for office, isolated them
selves into extreme positions by
declaring themselves as "con
servatives" or "Students Taking
a New Direction" (extreme liber
als). I am independent in my
thinking and I will vote inde
pendently in all matters brought
before the senate. I will be an
activist in student affairs, always
seeking to further the students'
interests.
Secondly, the students here
were not represented as well as
possible, simply because many
senators missed a large number of
meetings. I believe that it is the
senator's obligation to attend all
meetings when elected. I pledge
that I will be at every meeting
this year. Vote for Joe Sweeney
on Oct. 13-14 and ensure the best
possible representation for our
students.
(Joe Sweeney is an undeclared
sophomore.)
Warner Session
Vote Warner Session for ASSU
Senate. 1 am a senior pre-law
student majoring in political
science. My activities here have
run the gamut of lobbying in
Washington. D.C. for Stanford
in-Government participants to
being vice president of the Black
Student Union.
Because of my wide and var
ied dealings within the univer
sity I know I can be an effective
spokesmen for all students. I
know how and where to get
things done. Furthermore. 1 am
analytical and constructively
critical of all university policy
decisions.

My concern for the senate is
that it be truly representative.
Last year's senate was practi
cally homogeneous in member
ship. If the senate is to speak for a
diversified student body, then it
must be itself diversified.
A representative senate is one
that reflects all constituencies in
its membership. Vote Warner
Session on Oct. 13 and 14.

John Graves
Personals: Free, available 19
year old male, of undetermined
ethnic origin, is desirous of
meeting a sufficient number of
open-minded college students.
Those not interested in innova
tive thinking or peoples' rights
need not respond.
Object: Landslide victory in
the ASSU Senate elections.
Please contact John Graves by
Oct. 14.

Mark L. Manoil
Above all, the most compel
ling rationale for a vote for me is
that I am a nice guy.
As a freshman living in a
four-class dorm, Lagunita Court,
1 am aware of the concerns and
viewpoints of all four classes.
My campaign has included no
posters. 1 consider the poster
merely a hypocritical attempt at
"communication"; I prefer per
sonalization in dealing with the
citizenry here. A striking advan
tage of this position is the salva
tion of endless reams of paper
and thus a sincere attempt at
economic and ecological con
servation.
Besides, students here in gen
eral already haveenough to read,
especially in the johns.
The failures of last year's
ASSU Senate were due to a lack
of reasonable negotiation with
resolution. This year's election
should bring in fresh thinking
individuals, tenants of open
minds, in order to restore re
sponsiveness in student gov
ernment. I will attend.
(Murk Manoil is a freshman.)
