Ignacio Lazo
As a student here I believe that
what we need most from the
ASSU Senate is responsible rep
resentation.
I make only two promises. If
elected, I will be present at every
regularly scheduled meeting. I
think that this is the least that
you should ask of any person
who wants your support
tomorrow and Thursday.
Secondly, 1 will always make
the time to be readily available to
any fellow student who has a
question about the actions of the
senate or any body responsible
to it.
My phone number appears on
all of my campaign material. It is
also listed in the directory. It is
your guarantee that you will
have at least one voice speaking
without bias on your behalf.
If you have a question on
which issues I particularly sup
port. read some of my material or
call me personally.

ing in political science.)

Shur Reese
Three similarities between the
ASSU Senate and a hero
sandwich:
1. (of course) each has its fair
share of balogna;
2. Each, if laid at rest will re
main at rest;
3. Both have that stigma
"Hero" attached.
It doesn't have to be that way.
But given the amount of cam
paign balogna distributed, the
lack of inertia once elected, and
the slightly overgrown egos of a
few senators, it is that way.
The senate needs restructur
ing. We need a senate not just
elected from a broad majority out
of 6000 students, but a senate
responsible to a specific consti
tuency.
This is what I (Shur Reese) ac
tually believe and this is what I
will work for (if it takes me four
years to do it).
Otherwise, the senate will
continue to be ineffectual.

ing in political science.)

Whereas; the administration
of Stanford University has been
unresponsive to the needs and
demands of the students, and
Whereas; student participa
tion in decisions directly affect
ing the future of their education
has been discouraged, and
Whereas; attempts at student
participation in decisions con
cerning the tenuring of profes
sors have been stifled repeatedly
by the administration, and
Whereas; the university re
fuses to allow a student to par
ticipate in the decisions of the
Board of Trustees as a voting
member, and
Whereas; students are ex
pected to pay continually in
creasing tuition costs and then
are not allowed to park outside
their own campus residences
without a university-issued
parking permit, and
Whereas; university business
dealings with repressive dic
tatorships such as Iran is an
tithetical to the principal of free
dom of expression and a dis
grace to the students of this uni
versity, and
Whereas; the ASSU Senate of
1975-76, with the poorest atten
dance record of any senate in
many years, has demonstrated
its impotence and lack of re
sponsiveness to the above-stated
needs,
Therefore be it resolved: that
the senate of the 1976-77 should
be a more conscientious,
dynamic and responsive organi
zation in all of the above-stated
areas.
It can happen. We can provide
the effort required. We are rep
resentation personified.

Bob Greqory
We need student input into
tenure decisions, well-managed
Special Events, a Human Rights
Policy and ASSU Senate reform.
These &re the problems of our

university. However, everyone
states the problems.
I admit my platform-poster is
rather verbose, but please take
time to read it. Besides listing
the problems, I have also out
lined solutions. Solutions which
I feel are realistic and imple
mentable. If you feel that my
thoughts and ideas have merit,
then help me with your vote.
Vote for Bob Gregory.

Jon Barth, Pat Hall, Barry
Parr, Roy Skogstrom,
Tom Devine, Jim King,
Jeff Stoler
The Hammer and Coffin slate
would like to address the major
issues of the campaign. We do
not avoid controversy. We sim
ply are wary of alienating poten
tial voters. Whatever you want,
we will support. Succinctly, we
will advocate the installation of
a tenured student trustee who is
guaranteed on-campus housing
and is not an "Indian" mascot.
We endorse the Stoler report
recommending benign malig
nancy. We think it would really
be nice. Damn nice. We are only
asking for tumor years, only this
time with honor and majority
support. We will set up a sub
committee to implement the
Carson Eugenics plan. That is a
real good pun, get it?
We were there at registration.
We trudged through the rain the
first week of the quarter. We
turned in our study lists late. We
are just like you. Our opponents
are not Otherwise, they would
be just like us.
If you do not vote for us, you
can ask Carole Houck to tell you
jokes come reg pack time; you
can ask the ARC to do a humor
ous radio show; you can ask the
Daily to produce the Saturday
Night Films. We do a lot for you.
We'd like to do more. Why not
let us extend post-office hours,
gain a student majority on the
Board of Trustees, base tenure
decisions on arbitrary student
whim, and build enough row
houses for all off-campus stu
dents.
Let's talk about food poison
ing. You never know if last
night's lamb curry vvill lead to a
week of dispeptic agony or even

impotence. We will force all
food service employes involved
in poisonings to lick clean the
Jordan House bathrooms.
Our other proposals include
improving communications,
more freedom and justice, and
declining to make further state
ments.
The time is right. The place is
now.

Skogstrom are seniors. Tom De

Rick Hoft
Graduate students have many
good reasons to ignore student
government. There just isn't
much time to think about stu
dent politics, especially if you
consider it is a game that has
changed very little in structure
or function since junior high
school.
I would like an effective forum
for discussion and action on
specific ways to improve our life
here. 1 am willing to put in
enough time to bring about some
changes, and I hope there are
other candidates who feel the
same way.
My name is Rick Hoft. I re
ceived a B.S. degree herein 1975
and then spent the past year
working with community action
groups in St. Louis, Mo. Now
I've returned as a first year medi
cal student with developing in
terests in politics and administ
ration.
Thanks for your considera
tion.

David Haxton
The ASSU Senate this year has
the opporunity to improve the
undergraduate education. It
should especially concern itself
with:
1. Tuition. I believe that the
student body has the right to
have its views incorporated into
every important university deci
sion. This includes the setting of
tuition.
I understand the pressures to
increase tuition, but $4275 is a
lot of money. Let's be sure on
education here is still worth if.
2. Tenure. The senate is
responsible for advocating stu

dent sentiment before the ad
ministration. 1 would like to see
more student input into tenure
decisions.
I believe that I have the neces
sary experience and enthusiasm
to be an effective senator.
Support a dependable candi
date, concerned with being an
equitable voice and responsive
to you.
Vote on Wednesday and
Thursday for David Haxton,
ASSU Senate.
(David Haxton is a junior major
ing in mechanical engineering.)
Joe Sweeney
The ASSU Senate faced two
great problems last year. First of
all, many senators, while run
ning for office, isolated them
selves into extreme positions by
declaring themselves as "con
servatives" or "Students Taking
a New Direction" (extreme liber
als). I am independent in my
thinking and I will vote inde
pendently in all matters brought
before the senate. I will be an
activist in student affairs, always
seeking to further the students'
interests.
Secondly, the students here
were not represented as well as
possible, simply because many
senators missed a large number of
meetings. I believe that it is the
senator's obligation to attend all
meetings when elected. I pledge
that I will be at every meeting
this year. Vote for Joe Sweeney
on Oct. 13-14 and ensure the best
possible representation for our
students.
(Joe Sweeney is an undeclared
sophomore.)
Warner Session
Vote Warner Session for ASSU
Senate. 1 am a senior pre-law
student majoring in political
science. My activities here have
run the gamut of lobbying in
Washington. D.C. for Stanford
in-Government participants to
being vice president of the Black
Student Union.
Because of my wide and var
ied dealings within the univer
sity I know I can be an effective
spokesmen for all students. I
know how and where to get
things done. Furthermore. 1 am
analytical and constructively
critical of all university policy
decisions.

My concern for the senate is
that it be truly representative.
Last year's senate was practi
cally homogeneous in member
ship. If the senate is to speak for a
diversified student body, then it
must be itself diversified.
A representative senate is one
that reflects all constituencies in
its membership. Vote Warner
Session on Oct. 13 and 14.

Personals: Free, available 19
year old male, of undetermined
ethnic origin, is desirous of
meeting a sufficient number of
open-minded college students.
Those not interested in innova
tive thinking or peoples' rights
need not respond.
Object: Landslide victory in
the ASSU Senate elections.
Please contact John Graves by
Oct. 14.
(John Graves is an undeclared
sophomore.)
Mark L. Manoil
Above all, the most compel
ling rationale for a vote for me is
that I am a nice guy.
As a freshman living in a
four-class dorm, Lagunita Court,
1 am aware of the concerns and
viewpoints of all four classes.
My campaign has included no
posters. 1 consider the poster
merely a hypocritical attempt at
"communication"; I prefer per
sonalization in dealing with the
citizenry here. A striking advan
tage of this position is the salva
tion of endless reams of paper
and thus a sincere attempt at
economic and ecological con
servation.
Besides, students here in gen
eral already haveenough to read,
especially in the johns.
The failures of last year's
ASSU Senate were due to a lack
of reasonable negotiation with
resolution. This year's election
should bring in fresh thinking
individuals, tenants of open
minds, in order to restore re
sponsiveness in student gov
ernment. I will attend.
(Murk Manoil is a freshman.)
Steve Wurzburg
(Graduate students expect
three things from the university:
a quality education, a comforta
ble and supportive environment
(the weather helps some) and a
good social life. Obtaining a
quality education is a matter
primarily up to the individual;
yet this has been the principal
locus of the ASSU to the detri
ment of the other two equally
important and more readily
dealt with graduate desires.
One major problem, for exam
ple. is the social isolation that so
many graduates experience.
Craduates come here with few, if
any, friends. Furthermore, most
live alone or in small groups and
take specialized curricula which
limit the people with whom they
come in contact. The ASSU
should organize more activities
to bring graduate students to
gether.
A vote /or Steve Wurzburg is a
vote for someone who wants to
see the ASSI! Senate try to make
the university a more pleasant
place to receive a graduate edu
cation.
(Steve Wurzburg is a graduate
student in engineering
economic systems.)
Jordan Schwartz
You've been reading a lot of
campaign posters lately. By now
you know what the "issues" are.
Every candidate reiterates them:
senate reform, the Stanford Judi
cial Council, student trustee, te
nure, Honor Code, etc. If this isn't
your first year here, you know
that these issues have been
around a long time.
Rightfully so; they're impor
tant. But, we shouldn't lose
sight of the fact that new issues
arise daily and, while it's neces
sary to have someone to work for
the old issues, it is necessary as
well to have someone who can
anticipate and successfully ad
vocate the student position on
the new ones.
I believe my extensive service
record at Stanford (SWOPSI Pol
icy Board, ASSU Nominations
Committee and the Inter-
Iraternity Council) has proven
that 1 have the experience and
the ability to meet new issues
head on and to effectively and
energetically be your advocate.
(Jordan Schwartz is a junior
majoring in English.)
Tim Ferguson
Enough delays—let's open the
campus pub.
Administrators have indi
cated that because of a state regu
lation which would forbid
minors from entering the pub,
the university must forego it.
The administration believes that
no campus facility should be re
stricted on the basis of age.
But a vast majority of the cam
pus community would be able to
use the pub. It would be self
supporting; no minors would be
paying for a facility they could
not use. And virtually all stu
dents would eventually reach
age 21.
Thus the pub is a pure-gain
proposition. Most of us would be
better off, and no one worse off,
because of it.
On a related matter, the senate
must replace the departed Tim
Conway to retain its beer
drinking renown. I will push
myself to the limits of sobriety to
uphold this senate honor.
(Tim Ferguson is a senior major
ing in economics and communi
cation.)

Brad Krevoy
I'm running for re-election be
cause continuity is the most im
portant ingredient in student
government. Instead of invent
ing the wheel every year, the
ASSU Senate should strive to
complete the projects begun by
the previous year's senate.
I attended every meeting »ast
year and believe that removal of
20 unit restrictions, funding
club sports through a fee as
sessment and revitalizing the
Budget Committee are projects
that should be continued.
More importantly, the reforms
outlined last spring in a com
prehensive study on the struc
ture of the senate now need to be
enacted.
With rising tuition and no cor
responding rise in quality edu
cation, undergraduates are being
shortchanged. As a SWOPSI
course leader in the American
Studies House and member of
the Committee on Under
graduate Studies, I feel that resi
dential education can help re
vitalize undergraduate life on
the "Farm."
(Brad Krevoy is a junior major
ing in American studies and
communication.)

Just as we haven't cluttered
your halls and stalls with paper,
so we won't fill the ASSU Senate
with human waste. We are a
group of diverse people who
promise to bring some common
sense into the senate. While not
promising unanimity on all is
sues, we guarantee to work dili
gently as a unit.
Furthermore, we promise to
give you a full Lake Lagunita by
next spring. Last year's senate
betrayed a typical lack of leader
ship in this area.
(All of the above candidates are
undergaduates.)
Morris 'Mo' Kremen
The ASSU Senate must not
only discuss and examine stu
dent concerns but also actively
pursue the implementation of
bills and resolutions resulting
from this forum. I feel this step is
essential to an effective rep
resentation process. This is
where we need more emphasis
and energy.
It is not enough to pass a se
nate resolution stating, for
example, "there must be student
input from future tenure deci
sions." Without a follow-up
drive to force the administration
and other concerned groups to
take serious note, the resolution
is hollow. Without the push to
wards implementation, the se
nate becomes nothing more than
symbolic representation.
In running for senate, I am
committed to vigorously pursu
ing the goals embodied in all
senate actions.
[Morris "Mo" Kremen is an un
dergraduate.J
Reginald 'Pepe' Brown
It seems that year after year the
same issues prevail. The reason
is obvious. Previous ASSU Se
nates have failed to handle the
issues effectively. One such
issue is tenure and its relation
ship to the quality of teaching.
. This year's senate must let the
administration know that they
can no longer ignore students.
We must make sure that our tui
tion pays for more than the name
of a prestigious institution on a
piece of paper.

Before the senate can do the
job it is elected to do, it must
adopt a serious attitude. It is no
secret that last year's senate
lacked the necessary seriousness
to do more than pass meaning
less resolutions and carry on tri
vial debate.
Last year's senate has become
infamous for its absenteeism.
One promise I can make to un
dergraduates is a willingness to
be present at meetings and prove
that the senate is more than a
political kindergarten for career
politicians.
(Reginald Brown is a junior.)
David Parker
Most of the things that ASSU
Senate candidates promise or
pledge to do will never get done.
This deceit is not intentional,
usually; rather it is a simple lack
of a realistic understanding of
the senate and its place within
the university hierarchy. Despite
this there is one major area of
student interest where I feel the
senate can produce real results.
The area is that of teacher qual
ity.
I have been and am presently
the survey coordinator for the
ASSU Course Guide. If you elect
me ASSU senator I will work to
increase student input into the
tenure process. I will work to in
crease the number of classes re
ceiving student evaluation as
well as the quality of those
evaluations.
Tuition is too high and rising
too fast for students to be sub
jected to anything but the best
possible teaching quality. Thank
you,
(David Parker is a junior major
ing in human biology.)
Travis Dungan
The ASSU has seldom served
the interests of graduate stu
dents because only under
graduates have maintained seri
ous and sustained involvement
in the organization. This need
not and should not be the case.
In the past the ASSU Senate
has often served as a platform
from which budding politicos
pontificate on issues over which
they have no conceivable influ
ence. Senators should address
themselves to university
policies which are of direct con
cern to them.
The administration and the fa
culty, which are the source of all
power in the university, can be
influenced by students only if
they conduct themselves in a
mature, constructive manner
and avoid grandstanding and
overblown rhetoric.
If aggressive graduate rep
resentatives focus the ASSU's at
tention and some of its budget on
our problems, we can ac
complish a number of useful
goals. I play to provide constant
graduate student input on senate
decisions and to work on three
immediate issues: graduate fee
assessments, interaction among
the professional and graduate
schools and parking policies.
(Travis Dungan is a graduate
student in the Business School.)
Rodney Johnson
It is again time to sift through a
barrage of banners, posters and
words to acquire what we hope
will be a representative and ac
countable ASSU Senate.
My name is Rodney Johnson, a
junior in economics. I am run
ning for the senate for what
might be dubbed tired, idealistic
notions. But realism is a result of
idealism.
It is by the importunity for
what is basically right and fair
that we see progressive changes

in university policy.
My past experience includes:
president, Black Students Union
(BSU); evening supervisor, Palo
Alto Cultural Center; editor,
Third World Report; Stanford
representative at the Caribbean
Arts Festival in Jamaica this
summer; Stanford representa
tive at the National Student
Conference Against Racism at
Boston University in February
1975.
My main concerns as senator
will be on policies affecting a)
tenure; b) human rights; c) the
admissions process and "Tuition
1980"; d) senate efficaciousness;
e) fraternity morals and 112) qual
ity undergraduate education. In
130 words or so, I am to have
convinced you to vote for Rod
ney Johnson, ASSU Senate.
(Rodney Johnson is a junior
majoring in economics.)
John Paval
A graduate student in classics
(formerly in English), 1 have had
one year to become familiar with
the university. There is room for
a range of improvements in the
life and studies situation of
grads and undergrads alike.
But changes in policy must
not injure the interests of current
students. In general, the ASSU
can and should encourage social
interaction between the various
schools for the sake of personal
and practical understandings.
In keeping with this, coopera
tion between ASSU student rep
resentatives in Humanities and
Sciences, Law, Medicine and
Business may reveal common
goals. ASSU ought to promote
the concerns of all its con
stituents; its activities should re
flect its financial basis.
Within this understanding,
my aim is to represent graduate
students in an articulate and ef
fective way.
(John Poval is a graduate student
in classics.)
Steven Thurin
I was sitting out by the old
pool last Saturday, trying to fi
gure out the easiest way to get
elected to the ASSU Senate
when I was suddenly struck with
a moderately brilliant idea. Now
I don't know about you, but it
really bugs me looking at all
kinds of stupid posters all over
campus every year: so I'm not
gonna put any up.
But I've got $50 to spend with
out breaking any electioneering
rules (which don't say anything
about bribery), so here's what
I'm gonna do. I'll guarantee to
pay $1 to the first 50 graduate
students who send me a stamped
envelope and a signed note say
ing they voted for me.
You get a buck, I get elected
(hopefully), and how can you
beat it? Steven Thurin, Box
10247, Stanford.
(Steven Thurin is a graduate
student ma/oring in environ
mental engineering.)
Steve Westly
Some candidates spend their
campaign time promising things
they can't deliver. Others wan
der around complaining about
how bad the ASSU Senate used
to be. I served on the senate last
year. I know when it works, and
when it doesn't. It doesn't work
when few senators come to the
meetings and when still fewer
take the time to write bills and
resolutions.
As a senator last year I had one
of the best attendance records in
the senate. More importantly, I
cared enough to write effective
legislation that passed. Two
examples include a bill that ena

bled the Course Guide to be dis
tributed free this year, and a re
solution supporting club sports.
This year everyone's telling
you what's wrong with the se
nate. Unfortunately, only a frac
tion of them have even been to a
senate meeting.
I feel 1 have a good record, and
I'll stand by it.
(Steve Westly is a junior major
ing in history.)
Jeff Wachtel
Before any of these issues
being discussed can hold any
meaning for us, the ASSU Senate
must be reorganized so it has
decision-making power instead
of just operating in a recom
mending capacity as it is right
now. Apathy here is perhaps the
most valid student voice, con
sidering that all bills passed in
the senate become meaningless
upon alteration by the administ
ration.
The thing most people re
member best about last year's
senate is the mess they left be
hind in the halls and the streets
after the elections and cam
paigning were all over. Hence,
I'm running a word-of-mouth
campaign, side-stepping the
"mass media" methods of my
opponents, trying to make the
ASSU a more personal organiza
tion, rather than the stepping
stone for aspiring politicians it is
today.
(Jeff Wachtel is a sophomore
majoring in urban studies.)
Duncan Moore
While I share the other candi
dates' interest in the "current is
sues," those weren't what really
motivated me to run.
I want to form an adjunct to the
ASSU Senate with the specific
purpose of making it easy for
people to know what's happen
ing here.
This organization would have
a "hot-line" you can call to find
out anything from where the par
ties are that weekend to what
exhibits are on display. It will
run advertising for the clubs to
make them more attractive than
"Once Around the Quad" can. It
will publish a master list of clubs
and organizations that will be
distributed at the beginning of
each quarter.
A person can spend all of his
extra time searching out ac
tivities and then not have time to
get involved. I want to put all
this campus has to offer at your
fingertips.
(Duncan Moore is a sophomore
majoring in urban studies.)
Terry Barton
I, Terry Barton, advocate ac
tion, simplicity and organiza
tion in the ASSU Senate.
The senate is the means to or
ganize your ideas and put them
into action. The senate can be
whatever you want depending
on whom you vote for. It can be a
bureaucratic mess or a quick
moving, hard-working organiza
tion representing the students in
all university matters.
My chief goal would be to
promote greater student in
volvement so that students
would have a greater say in what
a "Stanford education" is. My
eventual aim would be to enable
students to reduce their tuition
and increase the benefits of their
time at Stanford through their
own actions.
Thank you for your considera
tion.
(Terry Barton is a freshman.)

Marc Ventresca
As a candidate for the ASSU
Senate, I feel that I offer a variety
of qualities which enable me to
participate in the senate effec
tively. Working in many types of
youth, civic and school organi
zations has given me a thorough
background to work on this
council.
Being a sophomore transfer, I
will approach each question we
face with an open mind, and
with an attitude of looking for a
solution without being pre
judiced by previous actions.
Also, I have a different perspec
tive on issues here, seeing how
another university met and dealt
with them.
In the time 1 have been here, 1
have become acquainted with
some of the questions arising on
this campus. As a member of the
senate, 1 hope to learn more
about each, and then to create a
workable resolution of it.
(Mure Ventrescu is u sophomore
mci/oring in political science.)
Brian Brown
Before the election, I think it's
only fair to warn the students
that voting for me will not put a
student on the Board of Trustees;
voting for me won't insure stu
dent input on tenure decisions
nor a student majority on the
judicial council.
Although I can be a respecta
ble senator, 1 can't single
handedly make the senate re
spectable. In short, although I'm
in favor of all these issues, I
realize that the only way the se
nate can effectively act is to act
together.
There are 20 senators; thus, it
takes 11 to constitute a majority.
Senators have to work together
to accomplish anything; a few
senators can create factions in
the senate that will render it im
potent. I refuse to make any
promises I know I can't keep.
Voting for me won't change
the senate — but it could be a
good start.
IBrian Brown is an undeclared
sophomore.)
Doug Bandow
The ASSU Senate has tor too
long been something of a joke.
Rather than representing stu
dent wishes, it has frequently
acted on the narrow desires of a
few.
This should be changed. All
students should be represented
fairly and responsibly, not
merely those from narrow spe
cial interest groups.
I would like to help move the
senate into a more responsive
role. The whole spectrum of
philosophies here should be rep
resented in allotting visiting pro
fessorships. distributing student
monies, and getting involved
with student problems and con
cerns.
I'm genuinely interested, and
if elected, I will do my best to
represent you fairly and respon
sibly. Please take the time to
vote.
Thank you.
(Doug Bandow is a first-year
law student.)
Steve Buckley
My candidacy for the ASSU
Senate stems from a commit
ment to change in two major
problem areas:
Student justice — At present,
students confront two options
when facing the university judi
cial system: judgment by a si ngle
administrator or judgment by a
faculty-dominated panel. Stu
dents deserve the option of
judgment by a student-majority

panel.
Student education — Students
should be actively involved in
tenure decisions. The universi
ty's stress on research must be
balanced by student concern for
teaching quality. The senate
should lobby for a student posi
tion on the Appointments and
Promotions Committee.
The senate you elect on Wed
nesday and Thursday will only
be as good as the people com
prising it. Please vote thought
fully.
(Steve Buckley is a junior
majoring in American Studies.)
Cathy Wittrock
"The ASSU has been, is now
and always will bean ineffectual
aody," is a prevalent misconcep
tion among students as well as
administrators in estimating the
strength of the ASSU Senate.
While it is true that the ASSU
works under real limitations,
passive acceptance on the part of
the student body only aggravates
the problem. Strong student
voice is essential to maximize
the utilization of the power we
do have.
Some of the issues on which
we need to focus are: the current
three-out-of-four years of
guaranteed housing, which
forces all of us to spend some
time living off-campus; the
stress on research and publica
tion in the awarding of faculty
tenure; and the ongoing Student
Conduct Legislative Council's
reassessment of the Honor Code.
The senate should exist as a
forum for the exchange of ideas,
debate, resolution and conclu
sive action.

Arthur Coleman
For all intents and purposes,
the ASSU Senate is a body with
no power and no respect among
the faculty. Thus the students
have no governing body that can
represent their viewpoint or act
to make positive changes in the
way the university operates.
If elected, I will work to make
the senate a respectable legisla
tive body and restore some of the
power it has lost. This can only
be accomplished through time
and conscientious effort and 1
promise to give both to my job.
(Arthur Coleman is a
freshman.)
Duane Seppi
Half the candidates for ASSU
Senate campaign on issues like
"having a student trustee." The
other half promise student ser
vices that no one will ever use or
even know about and will end
up paying for with "refundable
fees."
The senate has never affected
an administration decision. But
what I'd like to do is at least be
able to rap their knuckles when
they get too far out of line. For
instance:
1. Willow Road. The idea is
that there's traffic congestion.
The road will fix that. Of two
alternative routes for it, one was
through a grove of trees and the
other through a parking lot.
They chose the former. The
shopping center needed the
parking.
2. Professors, popular for good
teaching, are denied tenure
while tuition keeps rising
every year to pay for . . . good
teaching?
The senate can affect none of
this. But remember my cam
paign slogan: "Seppi will
wield the Willow switch."

Dragon has its year
This dragon is a detail on a panel of one of the many court robes
from China now on display at the Stanford Museum. This is the
year of the dragon on the Chinese calendar.
