# SCIRE lets students direct curricula
## 
### Louise Anderson 
First of a tivo-part series
In the seven years since its in
ception in 1969, the Stanford
Center for Innovation and Re
search in Education (SCIRE), has
sought to offer students alterna
tives to traditional instruction as
well as the chance to direct, and
to a certain extent create, their
own education.
One of the principle ways in
which SCIRE hopes to achieve
this goal is through a newly re
vised and extended internship
program scheduled to begin
winter quarter. SCIRE co
director Maria Chacon said,
"The way it's set up now, it
seems that a typical internship
will consist of placement with
an organization plus two related
university courses.
"Typically, students will get
between three and five units of
credit for each of the two
courses and seven units for the
internship. Accreditation goes
lor the academic work, the intel
lectual work that's actually done
in tying in the course content
and the field methods that
you've experienced. You're not
really getting accredited for the
working experience itself, hut
the reflection on and analysis of
it and for integrating that experi
ence and the course work."
The proposed internships
cover a wide range of fields and
interests, including positions
with the Urban Coalition that
deal with fair housing. The
poselike aspect of this particular
program is to audit and monitor
landlords suspected of dis
criminatory housing practices.

Another involves organizing a
food co-op for a low-income
community.
The Peninsula Conservation
Center is offering a third project
in which several students would
develop conservation tactics for
the home that could be pre
sented to the media and used to
educate the public.
The World Affairs Council is
looking for someone to help de
velop material for high school
curricula and teacher work
shops.
No clerical work
David Weckler, who re
searched many of the internship
placements, said: "We avoided
anyone we talked to who wanted
someone to do clerical work. We
explained to them that that was
not at all the objective of the
program."
He also emphasized that stu
dents can set up their own in
ternships through SCIRE and
that SCIRE will provide lists of
classes with which to supple

merit students' field work.
"In all its programs SCIRE
tries not to duplicate regular de
partmental offerings," said Janet
Shaver, student co-director.
SCIRE also has an innovation
fund of $4000 to explore ideas
that could have a long-term im
pact on undergraduate educa
tion. "What we would do with
the money that we had would be
to fund students to the extent
that we could and then help
them get help elsewhere."
'Not well known'
"SCIRE is not really well
known," continued Chacon. "A
lot of people seem to be unsure
about who we are and what we
do. I think one reason for this is
that once SCIRE achieves a suc
cess, it gets spun off into some
other autonomous situation and
then we start all over again try
ing to develop new programs.
That's why we're called the
Center for Innovation and Re
search in Education. We don't
normally hang on to projects; we

try to get them funded by some
other department or try to give
them their own autonomy.
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues), for
example, was originally a SCIRE
project . . . pretty much in the
way the internship program is
now."
"One of our functions is that
often people who are giving a
course or a workshop in SWOPSI
prepare it through SCIRE and get
credit for it. Then they offer it
through SWOPSI or as an Un
dergraduate Special.
"Theindividual projects, the
group projects, the task forces
stay here. But these specialized
types of things we don't hang on
to. We try to develop them and
perfect them. We started with in
ternships last spring and this
summer, fall and winter we're
trying to perfect them. We'll
then propose that the program

go somewhere else after it has
achieved success and we can
point to it with pride."
'Opportunities'
"Generally, l don't think that
students at Stanford realize the
large number of opportunities,"
said Tom Graham, student co
director of SWOPSI. "Many
times they're already doing a lot
of extra work and they're not
necessarily receiving credit for
it."
"They don't have a chance to
share their learning," he con
tinued. "For myself, 1 think that I
can learn a great deal from fellow
students, who have devoted time
and energy to studying a prob
lem. 1 think that more and more
juniors and seniors could use the
workshops, particularly if
they're studying the social sci
ence, to focus a lot of their educa
tion before that time and try to
put it in a practical format."

someone to do clerical work. We
explained to them that that was
not at all the objective of the
program."
He also emphasized that stu
dents can set up their own in
ternships through SCIRE and
that SCIRE will provide lists of
classes with which to supple

merit students' field work.
"In all its programs SCIRE
tries not to duplicate regular de
partmental offerings," said Janet
Shaver, student co-director.
SCIRE also has an innovation
fund of $4000 to explore ideas
that could have a long-term im
pact on undergraduate educa
tion. "What we would do with
the money that we had would be
to fund students to the extent
that we could and then help
them get help elsewhere."
'Not well known'
"SCIRE is not really well
known," continued Chacon. "A
lot of people seem to be unsure
about who we are and what we
do. I think one reason for this is
that once SCIRE achieves a suc
cess, it gets spun off into some
other autonomous situation and
then we start all over again try
ing to develop new programs.
That's why we're called the
Center for Innovation and Re
search in Education. We don't
normally hang on to projects; we

try to get them funded by some
other department or try to give
them their own autonomy.
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues), for
example, was originally a SCIRE
project . . . pretty much in the
way the internship program is
now."
"One of our functions is that
often people who are giving a
course or a workshop in SWOPSI
prepare it through SCIRE and get
credit for it. Then they offer it
through SWOPSI or as an Un
dergraduate Special.
"Theindividual projects, the
group projects, the task forces
stay here. But these specialized
types of things we don't hang on
to. We try to develop them and
perfect them. We started with in
ternships last spring and this
summer, fall and winter we're
trying to perfect them. We'll
then propose that the program

go somewhere else after it has
achieved success and we can
point to it with pride."
'Opportunities'
"Generally, l don't think that
students at Stanford realize the
large number of opportunities,"
said Tom Graham, student co
director of SWOPSI. "Many
times they're already doing a lot
of extra work and they're not
necessarily receiving credit for
it."
"They don't have a chance to
share their learning," he con
tinued. "For myself, 1 think that I
can learn a great deal from fellow
students, who have devoted time
and energy to studying a prob
lem. 1 think that more and more
juniors and seniors could use the
workshops, particularly if
they're studying the social sci
ence, to focus a lot of their educa
tion before that time and try to
put it in a practical format."
First of a tivo-part series
In the seven years since its in
ception in 1969, the Stanford
Center for Innovation and Re
search in Education (SCIRE), has
sought to offer students alterna
tives to traditional instruction as
well as the chance to direct, and
to a certain extent create, their
own education.
One of the principle ways in
which SCIRE hopes to achieve
this goal is through a newly re
vised and extended internship
program scheduled to begin
winter quarter. SCIRE co
director Maria Chacon said,
"The way it's set up now, it
seems that a typical internship
will consist of placement with
an organization plus two related
university courses.
"Typically, students will get
between three and five units of
credit for each of the two
courses and seven units for the
internship. Accreditation goes
lor the academic work, the intel
lectual work that's actually done
in tying in the course content
and the field methods that
you've experienced. You're not
really getting accredited for the
working experience itself, hut
the reflection on and analysis of
it and for integrating that experi
ence and the course work."
The proposed internships
cover a wide range of fields and
interests, including positions
with the Urban Coalition that
deal with fair housing. The
poselike aspect of this particular
program is to audit and monitor
landlords suspected of dis
criminatory housing practices.

Another involves organizing a
food co-op for a low-income
community.
The Peninsula Conservation
Center is offering a third project
in which several students would
develop conservation tactics for
the home that could be pre
sented to the media and used to
educate the public.
The World Affairs Council is
looking for someone to help de
velop material for high school
curricula and teacher work
shops.

David Weckler, who re
searched many of the internship
placements, said: "We avoided

perfect them. We started with in
ternships last spring and this
summer, fall and winter we're
trying to perfect them. We'll
then propose that the program

go somewhere else after it has
achieved success and we can
point to it with pride."
'Opportunities'
"Generally, l don't think that
students at Stanford realize the
large number of opportunities,"
said Tom Graham, student co
director of SWOPSI. "Many
times they're already doing a lot
of extra work and they're not
necessarily receiving credit for
it."
"They don't have a chance to
share their learning," he con
tinued. "For myself, 1 think that I
can learn a great deal from fellow
students, who have devoted time
and energy to studying a prob
lem. 1 think that more and more
juniors and seniors could use the
workshops, particularly if
they're studying the social sci
ence, to focus a lot of their educa
tion before that time and try to
put it in a practical format."
First of a tivo-part series
In the seven years since its in
ception in 1969, the Stanford
Center for Innovation and Re
search in Education (SCIRE), has
sought to offer students alterna
tives to traditional instruction as
well as the chance to direct, and
to a certain extent create, their
own education.
One of the principle ways in
which SCIRE hopes to achieve
this goal is through a newly re
vised and extended internship
program scheduled to begin
winter quarter. SCIRE co
director Maria Chacon said,
"The way it's set up now, it
seems that a typical internship
will consist of placement with
an organization plus two related
university courses.
"Typically, students will get
between three and five units of
credit for each of the two
courses and seven units for the
internship. Accreditation goes
lor the academic work, the intel
lectual work that's actually done
in tying in the course content
and the field methods that
you've experienced. You're not
really getting accredited for the
working experience itself, hut
the reflection on and analysis of
it and for integrating that experi
ence and the course work."
The proposed internships
cover a wide range of fields and
interests, including positions
with the Urban Coalition that
deal with fair housing. The
poselike aspect of this particular
program is to audit and monitor
landlords suspected of dis
criminatory housing practices.

Another involves organizing a
food co-op for a low-income
community.
The Peninsula Conservation
Center is offering a third project
in which several students would
develop conservation tactics for
the home that could be pre
sented to the media and used to
educate the public.
The World Affairs Council is
looking for someone to help de
velop material for high school
curricula and teacher work
shops.
No clerical work
David Weckler, who re
searched many of the internship
placements, said: "We avoided
anyone we talked to who wanted
someone to do clerical work. We
explained to them that that was
not at all the objective of the
program."
He also emphasized that stu
dents can set up their own in
ternships through SCIRE and
that SCIRE will provide lists of
classes with which to supple

merit students' field work.
"In all its programs SCIRE
tries not to duplicate regular de
partmental offerings," said Janet
Shaver, student co-director.
SCIRE also has an innovation
fund of $4000 to explore ideas
that could have a long-term im
pact on undergraduate educa
tion. "What we would do with
the money that we had would be
to fund students to the extent
that we could and then help
them get help elsewhere."
'Not well known'
"SCIRE is not really well
known," continued Chacon. "A
lot of people seem to be unsure
about who we are and what we
do. I think one reason for this is
that once SCIRE achieves a suc
cess, it gets spun off into some
other autonomous situation and
then we start all over again try
ing to develop new programs.
That's why we're called the
Center for Innovation and Re
search in Education. We don't
normally hang on to projects; we

try to get them funded by some
other department or try to give
them their own autonomy.
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues), for
example, was originally a SCIRE
project . . . pretty much in the
way the internship program is
now."
"One of our functions is that
often people who are giving a
course or a workshop in SWOPSI
prepare it through SCIRE and get
credit for it. Then they offer it
through SWOPSI or as an Un
dergraduate Special.
"Theindividual projects, the
group projects, the task forces
stay here. But these specialized
types of things we don't hang on
to. We try to develop them and
perfect them. We started with in
ternships last spring and this
summer, fall and winter we're
trying to perfect them. We'll
then propose that the program
