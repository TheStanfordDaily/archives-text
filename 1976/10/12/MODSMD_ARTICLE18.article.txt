# Chinese robes highlight show

Rumor has it that the Rodin
statues at the Stanford Museum
are wearing Chinese robes. Un
canny? Yes, but read on.
The Stanford museum is the
recent recipient of a private col
lection of court robes of imperial
China. The robes are on display
in the Miedal Room, on the sec
ond floor of the Museum, now
through Jan. 2.
Before entering the display
room, one is dazzled by an ex
quisite cherry silk woman's
hood embroidered with gold,
blue and green designs, bor
dered by white silk with a green
silk netting, fringed with multi
colored silk tassles.
The robes of the imperial
Chinese court were developed
by the Manchus, who ruled from
1644 to 1912. They integrated
Chinese artistry and symbolism
with a robe designed specifically
for the horseriding Manchus.
The early rules dictated not only
the dress of the court but also
forced the Chinese to wear their
hair in pigtails. However,
women who were not related to
Manchu officials were allowed
to retain their style of dress.
The display is well
documented and well hung.
Along with the robes, there are a
number of panelled Chinese
skirts, which were worn over the
traditional trouser and jacket
outfit of the Chinese women for
formal occasions. Among these
skirts is a rare red velvet bride's

skirt with designs actually cut
into the nape of the material.
Another technique used, be
sides embroidery, is k'o-ssu or
"cut silk," demonstrated by a
large blue tapestry of silk. The
thread is woven with tiny shut
tles, leaving openings in outline
for embroidery, so that the
background and design appears
as one piece. A mandarin coat of
k'o-ssu took one year to make,
which explains the exclusivity
of the pieces. The Ch'ing em
perors kept an imperial
monopoly on k'o-ssu. However,
by the 19th century, robes were
available to anyone who could
afford them.
The collection, donated by
Col. and Mrs. John Young, is
further unique in that tradition
called for the deceased to be
buried in their robes, so that few
have survived. The museum has
provided notes to translate the
iconograpy of the Chinese im
ages, explaining the meaning of
the dragon, the flowers, the
swastika and other traditional
designs. The impact of the robes
is not however on the narrative
level but the visual. There is
pure delight in the colors, the
intricacy of designs and the
meticulous craftsmanship.
The Stanford Museum, off of
Palm Drive on Museum Drive, is
openfrom 10a.m. t04:45 p.m. on
Tuesdays through Fridays, and 1
p.m. to 4:45 p.m. on weekends.

The Stanford museum is the
recent recipient of a private col
lection of court robes of imperial
China. The robes are on display
in the Miedal Room, on the sec
ond floor of the Museum, now
through Jan. 2.
Before entering the display
room, one is dazzled by an ex
quisite cherry silk woman's
hood embroidered with gold,
blue and green designs, bor
dered by white silk with a green
silk netting, fringed with multi
colored silk tassles.
The robes of the imperial
Chinese court were developed
by the Manchus, who ruled from
1644 to 1912. They integrated
Chinese artistry and symbolism
with a robe designed specifically
for the horseriding Manchus.
The early rules dictated not only
the dress of the court but also
forced the Chinese to wear their
hair in pigtails. However,
women who were not related to
Manchu officials were allowed
to retain their style of dress.
The display is well
documented and well hung.
Along with the robes, there are a
number of panelled Chinese
skirts, which were worn over the
traditional trouser and jacket
outfit of the Chinese women for
formal occasions. Among these
skirts is a rare red velvet bride's

skirt with designs actually cut
into the nape of the material.
Another technique used, be
sides embroidery, is k'o-ssu or
"cut silk," demonstrated by a
large blue tapestry of silk. The
thread is woven with tiny shut
tles, leaving openings in outline
for embroidery, so that the
background and design appears
as one piece. A mandarin coat of
k'o-ssu took one year to make,
which explains the exclusivity
of the pieces. The Ch'ing em
perors kept an imperial
monopoly on k'o-ssu. However,
by the 19th century, robes were
available to anyone who could
afford them.
The collection, donated by
Col. and Mrs. John Young, is
further unique in that tradition
called for the deceased to be
buried in their robes, so that few
have survived. The museum has
provided notes to translate the
iconograpy of the Chinese im
ages, explaining the meaning of
the dragon, the flowers, the
swastika and other traditional
designs. The impact of the robes
is not however on the narrative
level but the visual. There is
pure delight in the colors, the
intricacy of designs and the
meticulous craftsmanship.
The Stanford Museum, off of
Palm Drive on Museum Drive, is
openfrom 10a.m. t04:45 p.m. on
Tuesdays through Fridays, and 1
p.m. to 4:45 p.m. on weekends.
Admission is free.
Rumor has it that the Rodin
statues at the Stanford Museum
are wearing Chinese robes. Un
canny? Yes, but read on.
