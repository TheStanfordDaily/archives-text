# Tunney works to beat Hayakawa challenge
## 
### 
Los Angeles(AP)—U.S. Sen. John
Tunney is on the attack in his
re-election campaign and run
ning hard to stay even with the
quiet and slow-paced challenge
by Republican S.I. Hayakawa.
The GOP challenger is a sur
prisingly strong 70-year-old
newcomer to politics whose
campaign is based on the na
tional fame he won eight years
ago when, as newly appointed
college president, he quelled a
violent student strike at San
Francisco State College.
In recent weeks, Tunney has
gained some ground, and no
longer trails in polls. But the
Democratic incumbent's five
percentage point lead in the
latest California poll is not
enough to be comfortable.
Republicans rate Tunney as
one of the most vulnerable
Democrats up for re-election to
the Senate this year, and the 42-
year old son of former world

heavyweight boxing champion
Gene Tunney readily agrees that
he has a very tough race.
Although each candidate is
viewed as a moderate in his own
party, antagonizing respectively
the far left and far right, the
Tunney-Hayakawa campaign
revolves around traditional
philosophical divisions between
Democrats and Republicans.
Insensitive
Tunney says Hayakawa is in
sensitive to the needs of the
people and that Hayakawa
favors business and special in
terests. Hayakawa says Tunney
is a big spender, and he blames
Tunney and Democrats in gen
eral for a bloated federal
bureaucracy.
Aside from that predictable
campaign posturing, there are a
few unique issues coloring the
Tunney-Hayakawa race.
Hayakawa daily lists 10 issues
on which Tunney switched post
ions such as national health care
and offshore oil drilling, and has
labeled Tur.ney "Sen. Flip-
Flop." He also attacks Tunney's
absenteeism from the Senate, cit
ing in particular two well
publicized vacation trips during
sessions.
Relax laws
Tunney has seized on
Hayakawa's proposal that
juvenile crime could be reduced
if child labor and minimum
wage laws are relaxed to create
more jobs for youths. And Tun
ney recites a Hayakawa quote,
"There's no reason to fear
exploitation if you destroy the
minimum wage. The moment
you feel exploited, you can
quit."
Tunney cites that as evidence
Hayakawa is "an elitist" with
"antique ideas," a reminder of

his opponent's age.
But the traditional roles of in
cumbent and challenge have
been reversed in the Tunney-
Hayakawa race.
It is the incumbent who is put
ting in the 14-to-16 hour cam
paign days and is making a cam
paign issue of his opponent's re
luctance to debate. Tunney has

taken to debating a tam-o'-
shanter, Hayakawa's symbol, to
dramatize the point that
Hayakawa has turned down 30
of 31 offers of joint appearances.
Confident Hayakawa
And Hayakawa, the challenger,
is parceling out campaign ap
pearances, acting confident the
voters know him and will vote

for him on the basis of his record.
The reason for the reversal of
roles, in Tunney's words, is that
"I'm running against a folk
hero."
"He (Hayakawa) couldn't have
any more personal popularity
than when he came out of San
Francisco State — absolutely
couldn't have any more popular

ity," Tunney said in an inter
view.
"The only place he can go after
that is down, so he obviously
doesn't want to make news. And
so our strategy is to keep the
pressure on, confront him. It's
almost as if I'm the challenger,"
Tunney said.
Frustration
Tunney reveals frustration on
that point as he tells voters, "One
incident, five minutes in front of
television cameras eight years
ago, does not qualify a man for
the U.S. Senate."
He is referring to the morning
of Dec. 2,1968, when Hayakawa,
the newest in a series of interim
presidents of San Francisco
State, climbed to the roof of a
sound truck operated illegally
by leaders of a student strike and
yanked the wires from the
speakers before a battery of tele
vision and newspaper cameras.
Among Hayakawa supporters,
nine out of 10 cite that incident
first when asked why they sup
port him. And Hayakawa takes
every opportunity to remind
voters of "the battle of San Fran
cisco State."
Tam-o'-shanter
He campaigns in a brightly
colored tam-o'-shanter similar to
the one he wore as he pulled the
wires from the sound truck.
When Hayakawa visited San
Francisco State for a campaign
appearance, noisy student de
monstrators interrupted his
speech. Taunting the hecklers,
Hayakawa thanked them for re
minding voters of 1968 and pre
dicted they would "win hun
dreds of thousands of votes for
me."
On the stump, Hayakawa cuts
an unlikely figure for a candi
date. A Canadian-born semanti

cist of Japanese ancestry, he
tends to give speeches which
sound like classroom lectures in a
thin, almost whispering voice.
After rushing through the
"Sen. Flip-Flop" attack on Tun
ney written by his campaign
consultants, Hayakawa often
turns to subjects such as the his
toric perspectives of the two par
ties, which he says differ in
psychology more than in objec
tives, or to analysis of the Ameri
can "national experience."
But on most issues, Hayakawa
sticks to the generally conserva
tive Republican party platform
"To make the poor less poor
and give them a chance for gain
ful employment, it is necessary
to let business prosper, thereby
permitting the rich to get
richer," Hayakawa says.
"But that's what the politics of
compassion cannot endure, even
if the poor also get richer in the
process."

he has a very tough race.
Although each candidate is
viewed as a moderate in his own
party, antagonizing respectively
the far left and far right, the
Tunney-Hayakawa campaign
revolves around traditional
philosophical divisions between
Democrats and Republicans.
Insensitive
Tunney says Hayakawa is in
sensitive to the needs of the
people and that Hayakawa
favors business and special in
terests. Hayakawa says Tunney
is a big spender, and he blames
Tunney and Democrats in gen
eral for a bloated federal
bureaucracy.
Aside from that predictable
campaign posturing, there are a
few unique issues coloring the
Tunney-Hayakawa race.
Hayakawa daily lists 10 issues
on which Tunney switched post
ions such as national health care
and offshore oil drilling, and has
labeled Tur.ney "Sen. Flip-
Flop." He also attacks Tunney's
absenteeism from the Senate, cit
ing in particular two well
publicized vacation trips during
sessions.
Relax laws
Tunney has seized on
Hayakawa's proposal that
juvenile crime could be reduced
if child labor and minimum
wage laws are relaxed to create
more jobs for youths. And Tun
ney recites a Hayakawa quote,
"There's no reason to fear
exploitation if you destroy the
minimum wage. The moment
you feel exploited, you can
quit."
Tunney cites that as evidence
Hayakawa is "an elitist" with
"antique ideas," a reminder of

his opponent's age.
But the traditional roles of in
cumbent and challenge have
been reversed in the Tunney-
Hayakawa race.
It is the incumbent who is put
ting in the 14-to-16 hour cam
paign days and is making a cam
paign issue of his opponent's re
luctance to debate. Tunney has

taken to debating a tam-o'-
shanter, Hayakawa's symbol, to
dramatize the point that
Hayakawa has turned down 30
of 31 offers of joint appearances.
Confident Hayakawa
And Hayakawa, the challenger,
is parceling out campaign ap
pearances, acting confident the
voters know him and will vote

for him on the basis of his record.
The reason for the reversal of
roles, in Tunney's words, is that
"I'm running against a folk
hero."
"He (Hayakawa) couldn't have
any more personal popularity
than when he came out of San
Francisco State — absolutely
couldn't have any more popular

ity," Tunney said in an inter
view.
"The only place he can go after
that is down, so he obviously
doesn't want to make news. And
so our strategy is to keep the
pressure on, confront him. It's
almost as if I'm the challenger,"
Tunney said.
Frustration
Tunney reveals frustration on
that point as he tells voters, "One
incident, five minutes in front of
television cameras eight years
ago, does not qualify a man for
the U.S. Senate."
He is referring to the morning
of Dec. 2,1968, when Hayakawa,
the newest in a series of interim
presidents of San Francisco
State, climbed to the roof of a
sound truck operated illegally
by leaders of a student strike and
yanked the wires from the
speakers before a battery of tele
vision and newspaper cameras.
Among Hayakawa supporters,
nine out of 10 cite that incident
first when asked why they sup
port him. And Hayakawa takes
every opportunity to remind
voters of "the battle of San Fran
cisco State."
Tam-o'-shanter
He campaigns in a brightly
colored tam-o'-shanter similar to
the one he wore as he pulled the
wires from the sound truck.
When Hayakawa visited San
Francisco State for a campaign
appearance, noisy student de
monstrators interrupted his
speech. Taunting the hecklers,
Hayakawa thanked them for re
minding voters of 1968 and pre
dicted they would "win hun
dreds of thousands of votes for
me."
On the stump, Hayakawa cuts
an unlikely figure for a candi
date. A Canadian-born semanti

cist of Japanese ancestry, he
tends to give speeches which
sound like classroom lectures in a
thin, almost whispering voice.
After rushing through the
"Sen. Flip-Flop" attack on Tun
ney written by his campaign
consultants, Hayakawa often
turns to subjects such as the his
toric perspectives of the two par
ties, which he says differ in
psychology more than in objec
tives, or to analysis of the Ameri
can "national experience."
But on most issues, Hayakawa
sticks to the generally conserva
tive Republican party platform
"To make the poor less poor
and give them a chance for gain
ful employment, it is necessary
to let business prosper, thereby
permitting the rich to get
richer," Hayakawa says.
"But that's what the politics of
compassion cannot endure, even
if the poor also get richer in the
process."

Tunney cites that as evidence
Hayakawa is "an elitist" with
"antique ideas," a reminder of

his opponent's age.
But the traditional roles of in
cumbent and challenge have
been reversed in the Tunney-
Hayakawa race.
It is the incumbent who is put
ting in the 14-to-16 hour cam
paign days and is making a cam
paign issue of his opponent's re
luctance to debate. Tunney has

taken to debating a tam-o'-
shanter, Hayakawa's symbol, to
dramatize the point that
Hayakawa has turned down 30
of 31 offers of joint appearances.
Confident Hayakawa
And Hayakawa, the challenger,
is parceling out campaign ap
pearances, acting confident the
voters know him and will vote

for him on the basis of his record.
The reason for the reversal of
roles, in Tunney's words, is that
"I'm running against a folk
hero."
"He (Hayakawa) couldn't have
any more personal popularity
than when he came out of San
Francisco State — absolutely
couldn't have any more popular

ity," Tunney said in an inter
view.
"The only place he can go after
that is down, so he obviously
doesn't want to make news. And
so our strategy is to keep the
pressure on, confront him. It's
almost as if I'm the challenger,"
Tunney said.
Frustration
Tunney reveals frustration on
that point as he tells voters, "One
incident, five minutes in front of
television cameras eight years
ago, does not qualify a man for
the U.S. Senate."
He is referring to the morning
of Dec. 2,1968, when Hayakawa,
the newest in a series of interim
presidents of San Francisco
State, climbed to the roof of a
sound truck operated illegally
by leaders of a student strike and
yanked the wires from the
speakers before a battery of tele
vision and newspaper cameras.
Among Hayakawa supporters,
nine out of 10 cite that incident
first when asked why they sup
port him. And Hayakawa takes
every opportunity to remind
voters of "the battle of San Fran
cisco State."
Tam-o'-shanter
He campaigns in a brightly
colored tam-o'-shanter similar to
the one he wore as he pulled the
wires from the sound truck.
When Hayakawa visited San
Francisco State for a campaign
appearance, noisy student de
monstrators interrupted his
speech. Taunting the hecklers,
Hayakawa thanked them for re
minding voters of 1968 and pre
dicted they would "win hun
dreds of thousands of votes for
me."
On the stump, Hayakawa cuts
an unlikely figure for a candi
date. A Canadian-born semanti

cist of Japanese ancestry, he
tends to give speeches which
sound like classroom lectures in a
thin, almost whispering voice.
After rushing through the
"Sen. Flip-Flop" attack on Tun
ney written by his campaign
consultants, Hayakawa often
turns to subjects such as the his
toric perspectives of the two par
ties, which he says differ in
psychology more than in objec
tives, or to analysis of the Ameri
can "national experience."
But on most issues, Hayakawa
sticks to the generally conserva
tive Republican party platform
"To make the poor less poor
and give them a chance for gain
ful employment, it is necessary
to let business prosper, thereby
permitting the rich to get
richer," Hayakawa says.
"But that's what the politics of
compassion cannot endure, even
if the poor also get richer in the
process."


John Tunney


S.I. Hayakawa
Los Angeles(AP)—U.S. Sen. John
Tunney is on the attack in his
re-election campaign and run
ning hard to stay even with the
quiet and slow-paced challenge
by Republican S.I. Hayakawa.
The GOP challenger is a sur
prisingly strong 70-year-old
newcomer to politics whose
campaign is based on the na
tional fame he won eight years
ago when, as newly appointed
college president, he quelled a
violent student strike at San
Francisco State College.
In recent weeks, Tunney has
gained some ground, and no
longer trails in polls. But the
Democratic incumbent's five
percentage point lead in the
latest California poll is not
enough to be comfortable.
Republicans rate Tunney as
one of the most vulnerable
Democrats up for re-election to
the Senate this year, and the 42-
year old son of former world

heavyweight boxing champion
Gene Tunney readily agrees that
he has a very tough race.
Although each candidate is
viewed as a moderate in his own
party, antagonizing respectively
the far left and far right, the
Tunney-Hayakawa campaign
revolves around traditional
philosophical divisions between
Democrats and Republicans.
Insensitive
Tunney says Hayakawa is in
sensitive to the needs of the
people and that Hayakawa
favors business and special in
terests. Hayakawa says Tunney
is a big spender, and he blames
Tunney and Democrats in gen
eral for a bloated federal
bureaucracy.
Aside from that predictable
campaign posturing, there are a
few unique issues coloring the
Tunney-Hayakawa race.
Hayakawa daily lists 10 issues
on which Tunney switched post
ions such as national health care
and offshore oil drilling, and has
labeled Tur.ney "Sen. Flip-
Flop." He also attacks Tunney's
absenteeism from the Senate, cit
ing in particular two well
publicized vacation trips during
sessions.
