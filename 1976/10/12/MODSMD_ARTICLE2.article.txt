# Crisis in China
## Mao's widow imprisoned 
### 
London (AP) —Chairman Mao Tse-
Tung's widow, Chiang Ching, and
three other ultraleftist Chinese Com
munist party Politburo members have
been arrested by authorities in Peking
on charges of plotting a coup, the Daily
Telegraph reported today from the
Chinese capital.
The conservative daily's Peking cor
respondent, Nigel Wade, quoted reli
able sources in the capital as saying the
arrests were announced to political or
ganizers at special weekend briefings.
The 62-year-old Chiang Ching — a
onetime movie actress who became
Mao's fourth wife — and her three al
leged co-plotters were apparently ar
rested some time after Sept. 30, their
last known public appearance when
they attended a meeting on the eve of
China's national day, the report said.
Wade named the other Politiburo
members as WangHung-wenn,second
vice chairman of the Chinese party,
who is about 40 years old and has been
called "the Shanghai whiz kid;"
Chang Chun-chiao, aged about 63 and
first vice-premier, and Yao Wen-yuan,
aged about 46 and described as a lead
ing ideologue and polemicist.
The Telegraph said few details of the

alleged coup bid were known, but
Wade said the alleged plotters appa
rently had little backing from the
army.
Treasonable actions
He speculated the charges made
against Chiang and the others may
refer to other treasonable actions, such
as forging statements and sayings pur
portedly made by Mao in the last
months of his life. Mao died last
month.
The report of the arrests concided
with the appearance of wall posters
announcing that Prime Minister Hua
Kuo-feng was succeeding Mao as party
chairman and commander-in-chief of
China's armed forces, the Tele graph
said.
Hua appears to be aligned with party
moderates, Wade reported. He quoted
observers in the capital as saying the

formal announcement of Han's promo
tion had been delayed while his fac
tion purged radicals from the upper
echelons of power in Peking.
Political upheaval
The arrest of what Wade described
as "the Shanghai clique" would be the
biggest political upheavel in China
since the alleged coup attempt by
former Defense Minister Lin Piao in
1971.
Wade said Hua appears bent on
keeping radicals out of the Politburo in
a bid to end a long period of political
and economic uncertainty heightened
by Mao's failing health before his
death.
His reported action was viewed by
Western observers as an indication he
seeks to put China back on the pragma
tic course charted by the late Prime
Minister Chou En-lai.

The four figures reported arrested
have built up a power base in Shanghai
since the chaotic days of Mao's Cul
tural Revolution in the mid-60s.
Wade said all four have considerable
support among young leftists, but have
been strongly opposed by veteran
Communists in both China's party and
army.
Enormous influence
Chiang Ching, Mao's widow, has
wielded enormous influence in China,
both as the wife of the chairman and in
her own political career.
She was a leader of the radical wing
of the party and rose to prominence in
the cultural revolution. Some obser
vers said she provided much of the
impetus for the revolution.
Furious because the Peking opera
troupe in the capital spurned her
suggestion to follow the Maoist line of
"Revolutionary Romanticism." she
may well have planted in Mao's ear the
idea of the cultural purge.
As vice chairman of the cultural
purge group, Chiang Ching dominated
the Cultural Revolution. Dressed in
men's clothes and cap, wearing glas
ses, she tongue-lashed Mao's oppo
nents and settled old scores. At her
instigation, the Red Cuards ran wild,
attacking foreigners, burning down
the British Embassy, assaulting the
Soviet Embassy and destroying the
many cultural relics from the Chinese
past.
When the revolution ended in 1969,
Chiang Ching was one of the leading
figures of China. But her influence was
curbed by the late moderate premier,
Chou En-lai, whose job it was to restore
stability.
