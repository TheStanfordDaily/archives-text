# Present Art Gallery display features old Italian etchings
## 
### Katherine Draznin 
An enlightening show of 18th
century etchings by the prolific
Italian artist Giovanni Battista
Piranesi is now on display at the
Stanford Art Gallery. Piranesi's
prints are showing concurrently
with the Roman Portfolio of
photographer Margo Davis as
well as prints of Piranesi's con
temporaries, which delineate his
specific style.
The majority of Piranesi's
works are of architectural views
of Rome and of its ruins. Frus
trated in his attempts to become
an architect, Piranesi expressed
his ideas through his prints of
Rome, where he lived from 1740
untilhis death in 1778, atage 58.
The large prints (mostly 16 in.
x 20 in.) from his earliest works
are engravings rather than etch
ings, with an almost photo
graphic attention to the minutest
details. From a distance, the illu
sion of his exacting rendering is
highly effective.
Piranesi's Roman ruins, gaudy
Baroque and more classical Re
naissance settings are populated
by active Romans. There is an
excellent use of the figure as a

means of contrasting the solid,
stately, almost frozen but always
imposing architecture with the
fluid and greatly diminished
everyday world. The size of the
prints, the incredible mastery of
the etching needle, as well as the
knowledge that Piranesi pro
duced nearly 1000 etchings in
his lifetime, conveys a sense of
monumentality to his work. One
wishes there were more room in
the gallery for such a large en
deavor.
In contrast to Piranesi's works,
a number of prints of contem
porary artists, including some of
the earliest aquatints, as well as a

number of volumes of Piranesi's
publications of other artists'
works,are shown.
In later years, Piranesi's style
changed markedly. There is a
more vigorous use of blacks, a
great range in line and a shift
from the documentary to the fan
tasy. His subject becomes the tor
turous world of the "Imaginary
Prisons," and the change in ap
proach is well-suited. Having
used the clean exacting line for
the classical orderliness of
Roman monuments, he turns to a
dark, terrifying, almost violent
tone in the nightmarish visions
of the prisons.
Piranesi was considered ec
centric and almost fanatic in his
pace of work. His dying words
sum up best the energy dis
played in this finely
documented show: "Rest is un
worthy of a citizen of Rome."
The Piranesi/Davis show will
continue through Nov. 21. The
Gallery, next to the Cummings
Art Building, is open from 10
a.m. to 4:45 p.m. on Tuesdays
through Fridays, and 1 p.m. to
4:45 p.m. on weekends. Admis

century etchings by the prolific
Italian artist Giovanni Battista
Piranesi is now on display at the
Stanford Art Gallery. Piranesi's
prints are showing concurrently
with the Roman Portfolio of
photographer Margo Davis as
well as prints of Piranesi's con
temporaries, which delineate his
specific style.
The majority of Piranesi's
works are of architectural views
of Rome and of its ruins. Frus
trated in his attempts to become
an architect, Piranesi expressed
his ideas through his prints of
Rome, where he lived from 1740
untilhis death in 1778, atage 58.
The large prints (mostly 16 in.
x 20 in.) from his earliest works
are engravings rather than etch
ings, with an almost photo
graphic attention to the minutest
details. From a distance, the illu
sion of his exacting rendering is
highly effective.
Piranesi's Roman ruins, gaudy
Baroque and more classical Re
naissance settings are populated
by active Romans. There is an
excellent use of the figure as a

means of contrasting the solid,
stately, almost frozen but always
imposing architecture with the
fluid and greatly diminished
everyday world. The size of the
prints, the incredible mastery of
the etching needle, as well as the
knowledge that Piranesi pro
duced nearly 1000 etchings in
his lifetime, conveys a sense of
monumentality to his work. One
wishes there were more room in
the gallery for such a large en
deavor.
In contrast to Piranesi's works,
a number of prints of contem
porary artists, including some of
the earliest aquatints, as well as a

number of volumes of Piranesi's
publications of other artists'
works,are shown.
In later years, Piranesi's style
changed markedly. There is a
more vigorous use of blacks, a
great range in line and a shift
from the documentary to the fan
tasy. His subject becomes the tor
turous world of the "Imaginary
Prisons," and the change in ap
proach is well-suited. Having
used the clean exacting line for
the classical orderliness of
Roman monuments, he turns to a
dark, terrifying, almost violent
tone in the nightmarish visions
of the prisons.
Piranesi was considered ec
centric and almost fanatic in his
pace of work. His dying words
sum up best the energy dis
played in this finely
documented show: "Rest is un
worthy of a citizen of Rome."
The Piranesi/Davis show will
continue through Nov. 21. The
Gallery, next to the Cummings
Art Building, is open from 10
a.m. to 4:45 p.m. on Tuesdays
through Fridays, and 1 p.m. to
4:45 p.m. on weekends. Admis
