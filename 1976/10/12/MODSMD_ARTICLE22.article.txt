## Ombudsman's Report for 1975-76: Complaints over teaching, grading increase, Goheen and Stephenson note 
### 
From the Charge to the Ombudsman:
"Purpose. The Ombudsman's task is to protect the
interests and rights of members of the Stanford community
from injustices or abuses of discretion, from gross ineffi
ciency, from unnecessary delay and complication in adminis
tration of university rules and regulations, and from inconsis
tency, unfairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the
individual's experience with university activities.
"The Ombudsman exists to receive, examine, and channel
the complaints and grievances of members of the Stanford
community, and to secure expeditious and impartial red
ress. .. .
"Power. The Ombudsman's power rests on his reputation
for fairness, objectivity, tact, and respectful concern for the
welfare of all members of the university community and for
the well-being of the university.
"The Ombudsman receives complaints, pursues inquiries
into the issues involved, and makes recommendations for
suitable action. His investigative powers include access, on a
confidential basis, to all official university records. He may
request an audience with any member of the Stanford
community, and that person is obliged to meet with him
promptly. His remedial weapons are persuasion and private or
public criticism. ..."
Frequent questions about the function and power of the
Ombudsman suggest the importance of publishing once again
the charge on which the office was established.
Two additional principles are embodied in the full charge
which need to be more widely known than they are: 1) the
independence of the office of Ombudsman from the adminis
tration offices and officials of the university, and 2) the
guarantee of confidentiality (when requested) with respect to
complaints and problems brought to the attention of the
Ombudsman. The integrity of the office depends on adher
ence to these principles and confidence within the university
community that they will be carefully maintained.
Student Assistants to the Ombudsman
Following a practice not uncommon in other institutions,
two students were appointed as assistants to the Ombudsman
for the academic year 1975-76. The principal purpose behind
this step was to increase awareness of student problems on
the assumption that students might more easily express their
concerns to fellow students than to the Ombudsman directly.
This seems to have been a valid assumption.
The two assistants, Margie Weisz and Marsha Wilkes,
received and investigated numerous complaints and referred
them to this office, where the final responsibility lies. Both
student assistants have been particularly concerned with the
evaluation of teaching. They have also given considerable
attention to related academic matters such as examination
schedules and "dead week" and have been largely instru
mental in making the office better known among students, a
need which persists despite information available in numer
ous publications. Accordingly, association of student assis
tants with this office will be continued throughout the
ooming year.
Two Principal Sources of Complaints
Although there is much excellent teaching at Stanford,
the number of complaints about courses and instruction has
greatly increased over the previous year. These complaints
have come from both graduate and undergraduate students,
the larger number from the latter group. They range from
confusion concerning course requirements to charges of
inequality in grading and poor instruction.
These problems are especially difficult to resolve both for
this office and the students involved. The formal procedure
of appeal to a department head is not one that a student
normally feels he can easily pursue. The further appeal to the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies or the Dean of Graduate
Studies, who have the authority to resolve these problems,
has been invoked, to the knowledge of this office, only twice
in the past two years.
Beyond the deans, the student has the right to appeal to
the vice-president and provost and ultimately to the presi
dent. It seems a long road from a classroom to the ultimate
authority. With regard to student complaints about instruc
tion and related problems, this office discusses the problem
in detail, appraising its seriousness and the appropriate
action.
In the course of the discussion the student is informed of
the formal procedure with which he is usually unfamiliar and
which he generally rejects. If it appears that the complaint is
of a serious order, this office may inform the appropriate
administrator or discuss the problem directly with the in
structor involved. These informal procedures have proved
generally effective.
The academic problems of students are not served effec
tively by the present formal procedure. That such a proce
dure exists is desirable, but it would seem that some more
direct, easy method should be devised as an alternative. This
office can. of course, act as described above, but it can only
offer advice, not adjudicate and definitively resolve problems.

The second source of complaints coming to this
office this year is from nonfaculty personnel. Some of these
complaints are clearly matters for the Office of Personnel,
and are brought to the attention of that office as a matter of
course. Others more difficult to resolve are expressions of
resentment concerning an administrator's attitude toward
persons under his or her direction; resentment because of
lack of appreciation of an employee's work, or failure to
acknowledge him or her as an individual, resentment because
of expressed or more subtly conveyed attitudes of super
iority-all indications of a serious failure on the part of
certain administrators to respect ordinary humane standards
of employer-employee relations.
Such conditions may exist even when formal relations are.fe,
in accord with standards set by the Office of Personnel
concerning job description, appropriate salaries and the like.
Cases of this kind have sometimes been drawn to the
attention of the Office of Personnel, but for various reasons
the complainant may not wish this to be done; he or she
desires rather that some person or persons in the university
be made aware of the problem. By bringing this type of
complaint to the attention of the university at large it is
hoped that such problems may be reduced.
Some Other Matters:
Library Problems
There are many complaints from students concerning
library fines as now administered, due in part, at least, to the
institution of a more stringent system after a period of less
rigorous enforcement. The libraiy personnel are fully consci
ous of the problem that has been created and plan a publicity
campaign to make students aware of this more exacting
policy. This clearly needs to be done.
Students, however, will continue to have trouble due to
the complexity and diversity of the library organization, and
there will continue to be legitimate cases of complaint. The
library does make mistakes, as instances coming to this office
have shown. A far more serious cause of complaints is the
problem of missing books.
Stolen books and journals, as well as important articles
cut from journals and other publications became a major
source of difficulty and frustration for both students and
faculty. To recommend tighter control over access to the
libraries is not a step which one would want to propose, but
the degree of loss of books and the resulting frustration
suggests that this may be necessary.
Confusion concerning "Dead Week"
Many University publications carry a description of "dead
week," and it is surprising that any problems should arise. In
some instances faculty either disregard this ancient tradition
or are unfamiliar with it. Students, however, attach consider
able importance to its observance and complain about prac
tices which clearly violate its intent. The description provides
that ". . .no quizzes or examinations should be given, and no
musical, dramatic, and athletic events involving compulsory
student participation should be scheduled." (Faculty Hand
hook, p. 50). Although this seems to be clear and straight
forward, even problems of interpretation have arisen. It is
urged that the Dean of Student Affairs and the registrar
remind the faculty and other appropriate offices of the

existence of "dead week" and the importance of adhering to
its provisions.
The status of teaching assistants
Teaching assistants carry a heavy burden, and some of the
most effective instruction is done by this group. Students are
very aware of the contribution that some teaching assistants
make to their education. They are equally aware of the
failure of others. One suggestion to this office has been to the
effect that greater attention and recognition be given them as
a group by university departmental administrators. The in
tent of this suggestion is not that this is not done by some
faculty and administrators, but rather that the importance of
their role in the instructional program receive wider public
recognition.
Perhaps one of the best ways to do this has already been
initiated on the campus with a group of teaching assistants,
called "Graduate Teaching Workshop," promoted by Prof.
David Halliburton under the Danforth Program. This is an
important innovation which should have strong administra
tive support. However, in view of the heavy duties teaching
assistants often have, there should be consideration given to
some form of reduction in teaching load for those participat
ing in the program.
Problems concerning the graduate student
Last year this office recommended a reexamination of the
interdepartmental Ph.D. programs as a consequence of sug
gestions that entrance to the program was unnecessarily
complicated; in other words, that direct entrance should be
made possible. The subcommittee on Ph.D. interdepart
mental programs examined and rejected this proposal, insist
ing that the present procedures protected the quality of these
programs.
It has been suggested that the matter be raised again on
the grounds that direct entrance would encourage graduate
students to conceive and to undertake cross-disciplinary work
at the very beginning of their graduate careers. It seems
particularly important to encourage those who desire to enter
interdisciplinary studies, in view of the tendency of the Ph.D.
to become too narrowly departmental.
The problem of finding employment for the graduate
student's spouse has become increasingly serious. With rising
living costs and fellowship stipends which have not been
increased in some cases for several years, employment in
appropriate positions is a critical mattter for many couples.
Some agencies in the university arc concerned with this, for
example, the Career Planning and Placement Center and the
Office of Personnel, but a much more concerted effort is
needed to offset the shortage of jobs in this general area and
within the university itself.
The situation is especially serious for couples who assume
before coming to Stanford that jobs are easily available for
one or the other of the two. Graduate admissions should
warn students in advance that this is not the case. It would
seem desirable also that the Graduate Dean's Office imple
ment a program which would coordinate and strengthen the
efforts to find appropriate positions.
The long-standing problem of continuing education for
the graduate student's spouse is presently under study by the
ASSU Council of Presidents. This is a commendable under
taking and should receive support from the Graduate Dean
and other University officials. The problem is difficult,
involving changes in present regulations concerning part-time
registration for credit. There may be other alternatives to be
explored which would meet the special intellectual interests
of some members of this group. The extension of the
privileges of the attendance permit is one possibility.
Projects Initiated or Sponsored by this Office:
The Honor Code
Last year this office recommended a study of the effect
iveness of the Honor Code. It will be recalled this arose from
a number of complaints by students and faculty of Honor
Code violations or strongly suspected violations. Also, stu
dents reported that faculty occasionally violated the provi
sions of the Honor Code by supervising examinations and by
other practices which implied distrust of student adherence
to the Code. It was quite clear that there existed considerable
ignorance of and disregard for the Honor Code.
The intent of the recommendation, therefore, was to
bring the matter to the attention of the general University
public by requesting a thorough investigation of its effective
ness. In response to the recommendation. President Lyman
charged the SCLC with a study of this problem, and during
the past year a very detailed study has been in process. It is
expected that the results will be published early in the
coming academic year.
Kmeriti Professors
There are occasions when this office should, under its
charge, initiate investigations of problems which are not the
immediate concern of the existing offices and regulations of
the University. Over the past two years, for example, this
office has been asked to inquire into the status of emeriti
professors.

There are many persons who retire to productive, active r
careers and find retirement (even early retirement) desirable.
This is far from true of ail, however. To be cut off from the
University at a healthy 65 can be very destructive. A number
of faculty, who are not themselves retired or near retirement,
have expressed the view that this is indeed the case and that
the University should seriously address the problem.
Although various organizations, among them the AAUP,
have interest in the matter, little systematic information
seems to exist concerning its extent or seriousness. Quite
apart from the presumed destructive effects of retirement on
some individuals, there is the attendant opinion that much
available talent is being lost to the University, especially in
the area of the humanities.
During the past year this office has urged that the
problems of retirement be investigated. The Committee on
Faculty and Staff Affairs was approached, and ARLO was
asked to consider making the investigation a project under its
direction. ARLO has already gathered some information, and
it is to be hoped that an investigatory project can be
undertaken next year.
Grading
Problems which students bring to this office frequently
concern the grading system. As mentioned last year, students
are currently highly sensitive to what they perceive as
inequalities in grading, distinctions between aß+ and an A- /
(which instructors often find difficult to justify) and varia
tions from section to section in large courses.
Students in an enterprising freshman seminar in the
philosophy of education, taught by Dr. George Cattermole, i
expressed the desire to survey the opinions of the entire '
Academic Council through a questionnaire on grading. In
view of the questions that come to this office, some precisely
the questions included in the questionnaire, it seemed |
priate that this office should sponsor its circulation.
Despite a general aversion to questionnaires, 42% of the
Academic Council replied. Twenty-five percent of those
responding graded on a "curve," a practice discouraged in the
official statement on grading. A majority of those using the
curve considered that it afforded a means for evaluating
students "relative to one another." On the other hand, a
majority not using the "curve" believed that students should
be evaluated according to "independent performance."
It is interesting to note that student complaints coming to
this office reflect dissatisfaction and confusion as a result of
evaluation under these two very different criteria. It can, of
course, be argued that these are not necessarily inconsistent
criteria, but if it is the intent, as it seems to be, of University
policy on grading to stress individual performance, every
effort should be made to carry this out by eliminating any
arbitrary "curve" system.
It is also of some interest that a majority of the faculty
responding to the questionnaire thought that the restoration
of the "D" grade was "beneficial," but there is no explana
tion in the report for this reversal of opinion. A fuller
account of the questionnaire and responses is to be found in
the Campus Report, June 23, 1976.
Conclusion
The general calm which has characterized the life of the
University over the past two or three years would suggest a
decline in the need and use of the Office of Ombudsman.
Quite the contrary; the number of "cases" has increased from
approximately 250 in 1974-75 to 350 this past year Ry
"case" is meant any appeal or complaint and can represent an
individual or many.
It is not at all clear why the increase has occurred. It is
probable, however, that the activity of the two student
assistants has made the office more accessible and better (
known among students and student organizations. A sharp
rise in tuition and general living costs may be a partial factor,
for this may intensify demands and expectations, both
reasonable and unreasonable, which the University may find (
difficult if not impossible to satisfy. It is clear that Stanford's
reputation does create high expectations in all sections of the
University, and under present social pressures, expressions of
dissatisfaction might very well be expected to rise. \
Many individuals and offices have responded generously
to inquiries from the Ombudsman's Office during the past
year. The officc is very dependent on cooperation from all
sectors of the University, and it is with satisfaction we report ,
that this has, in fact, been the case. i
The accompanying statistical summary of "cases" during
the past year gives some idea of the range of problems to
which this office has responded. It must, however, be borne in
mind that a "case" may be minor or very complex requiring 1
protracted attention. Short of a much more complicated
report, distinctions of this kind are not reflected in the ( i
summary. i 1
