## Steeleye Span mystifies 
### Alan Hoffman 
As I waited for Steeleye Span to appear on
stage at San Francisco's Boarding House
last week, I remembered that I had once
asked a young Londoner who was hitching
across our country, what he thought of that
particular band. His reply: "Oh, 1 don't go
for this sort of 'country rock,' know wot I
mean?"
It's inevitable, I guess, that a Londoner
can't allow himself to dig Steeleye Span.
Their music expresses an ancient mystical
"head," so steeped in Britishness that it can
probably be "smelled in the blood of an
Englishman." A Londoner has to repress
that magic in order to be in tune with the
modern city's drudge.
Not that that many Americans seem to
know the space created by Steeleye Span.
When first confronted with the name, most
rock fans have trouble distinguishing it
from "Steely Dan." Perhaps subtle distinc
tions become difficult after too many years
of exposure to rhymes used in rock lyrics.
Listening to Steeleye Span is the musical
equivalent of reading, say, Shakespeare's
best bawdy verse, or the images of elvish
power in A Midsummer Night's Dream. As
we have found the Bard more than relevant
to our own age, so Steeleye Span has found
that ancient British folk ballads canbe a part
of rock tradition.

Set to electric instruments, the tunes cook
today as well as they did centuries ago. And
the energy is in both the notes and the
lyrics: the songs tell of hip young people
fucking out in the meadows or having weird
visions; the ancient modal chord progres
sions complete the hypnotic effect.
It's not surprising that Steeleye Span's
opening-night audience was hip to the
Span's rural rock. Like the early Grateful
Dead, their fame has spread mostly by word
of mouth, insuring devoted audiences and
thus that all-important concert rapport.
Performing material from their new al
bum, Rocket Cottage, Span maintained the
momentum throughout the first set with an
irresistible backbeat and a roguish stage
presence. The selections, as usual, dealt
with the adventures of British commoners,
characterized by sex, blood, strong drink
and witchcraft. In fact, on stage Steeleye
Span impresses the observer as a microcosm
of a medieval English village, somehow
temporarily transported to our sterile era.
The personnel, their instrumentation and
their corresponding medieval identities:
Tim Hart, rhythm guitar, electric dulcimer,
lord of the manor; Rick Kemp, bass, knight
of the realm; Robert Johnson, lead guitar,
village dandy; Peter Knight, fiddle, mando
lin, village demon; Nigel Pegrum, drums,
village idiot; Maddy Prior, vocals, jigs,
Keeper of the Flame, country lass.

In the second show, the band seemed in
tent on repeating the previous set. The au
dience, however, soon egged them on to
some older hits — the hard rock of "Cam Ye
O'er Frae France," the six-part a cappella
harmonies of "Gaudete," the ribald balladry
of "Royal Forester." The light show em
phasized the mystical texture of the music,
particularly on "Gaudete," putting Maddy
Prior alone in center stage in red, then high
lighting the rest of the band in silver-white
for the chorus.
Something was set loose in the Span after
they abandoned their original plans for that
last show. Peter Knight, having gotten into a
mood he called "So Fucking What?",
proved (on fiddle) that he is the hot soloist
of the group. The set ended in a medley of
jigs that turned into an electric jam: Maddy
took the opportunity to jig up and down the
aisles of the club. Even the audience danced
in the aisles, and if you go to the Boarding
House regularly you know what a rare sight
that is.
At some point we discovered that the last
encore had been played, so we quit dancing
and headed for the door. A few club patrons
stumbled out through a sangria hangover,
the bartender had fallen asleep on the bar,
but we jigged down Bush Street into the
night, singing out one more chorus of "All
the good times of Old England. . .

they abandoned their original plans for that
last show. Peter Knight, having gotten into a
mood he called "So Fucking What?",
proved (on fiddle) that he is the hot soloist
of the group. The set ended in a medley of
jigs that turned into an electric jam: Maddy
took the opportunity to jig up and down the
aisles of the club. Even the audience danced
in the aisles, and if you go to the Boarding
House regularly you know what a rare sight
that is.
At some point we discovered that the last
encore had been played, so we quit dancing
and headed for the door. A few club patrons
stumbled out through a sangria hangover,
the bartender had fallen asleep on the bar,

night, singing out one more chorus of "All

As I waited for Steeleye Span to appear on
stage at San Francisco's Boarding House
last week, I remembered that I had once
asked a young Londoner who was hitching
across our country, what he thought of that
particular band. His reply: "Oh, 1 don't go
for this sort of 'country rock,' know wot I
mean?"
It's inevitable, I guess, that a Londoner
can't allow himself to dig Steeleye Span.
Their music expresses an ancient mystical
"head," so steeped in Britishness that it can
probably be "smelled in the blood of an
Englishman." A Londoner has to repress
that magic in order to be in tune with the
modern city's drudge.
Not that that many Americans seem to
know the space created by Steeleye Span.
When first confronted with the name, most
rock fans have trouble distinguishing it
from "Steely Dan." Perhaps subtle distinc
tions become difficult after too many years
of exposure to rhymes used in rock lyrics.
Listening to Steeleye Span is the musical
equivalent of reading, say, Shakespeare's
best bawdy verse, or the images of elvish
power in A Midsummer Night's Dream. As
we have found the Bard more than relevant
to our own age, so Steeleye Span has found
that ancient British folk ballads canbe a part
of rock tradition.

Set to electric instruments, the tunes cook
today as well as they did centuries ago. And
the energy is in both the notes and the
lyrics: the songs tell of hip young people
fucking out in the meadows or having weird
visions; the ancient modal chord progres
sions complete the hypnotic effect.
It's not surprising that Steeleye Span's
opening-night audience was hip to the
Span's rural rock. Like the early Grateful
Dead, their fame has spread mostly by word
of mouth, insuring devoted audiences and
thus that all-important concert rapport.
Performing material from their new al
bum, Rocket Cottage, Span maintained the
momentum throughout the first set with an
irresistible backbeat and a roguish stage
presence. The selections, as usual, dealt
with the adventures of British commoners,
characterized by sex, blood, strong drink
and witchcraft. In fact, on stage Steeleye
Span impresses the observer as a microcosm
of a medieval English village, somehow
temporarily transported to our sterile era.
The personnel, their instrumentation and
their corresponding medieval identities:
Tim Hart, rhythm guitar, electric dulcimer,
lord of the manor; Rick Kemp, bass, knight
of the realm; Robert Johnson, lead guitar,
village dandy; Peter Knight, fiddle, mando
lin, village demon; Nigel Pegrum, drums,
village idiot; Maddy Prior, vocals, jigs,
Keeper of the Flame, country lass.

In the second show, the band seemed in
tent on repeating the previous set. The au
dience, however, soon egged them on to
some older hits — the hard rock of "Cam Ye
O'er Frae France," the six-part a cappella
harmonies of "Gaudete," the ribald balladry
of "Royal Forester." The light show em
phasized the mystical texture of the music,
particularly on "Gaudete," putting Maddy
Prior alone in center stage in red, then high
lighting the rest of the band in silver-white
for the chorus.
