# Tresidder plans full season of autumn programs
## 
### Dean Eyre 
The presentation of the fine
arts exhibits, concerts films,
workshops, panels and lectures
centered around Tresidder Union
is the responsibility of Tresidder
Programs. Under the manage
ment of Programs Manager Jean
Martin, the popular series of
events offers the Stanford com
munity an introduction to a
broad spectrum of entertain
ment.
One of the important features
of the activities is that the prog
ram is geared to serve the stu
dents, who would normally not
have the opportunity to experi
ence such events if they were
held off campus.
A highlight of the year's ac
tivities is the Christmas Faire, an
exciting craft gallery guaranteed
to provide hard-to-find gifts for
the holiday season. The Faire is
held annually during the first
week in December, with this
year's edition occurring De
cember 3-5.

The musical portion of the
Tresidder Programs features per
formances by students and fa
culty of the Music Department,
alumni and professionals. The
chamber music events are pre
sented in the second-floor
lounge of the Tresidder Union
each Wednesday noon. Other
musical specials including jazz,
country and folk are held on
either the front or back patios on
Fridays and Saturdays.
In addition to the faculty and
professional musicians, a large
portion of the concerts include
Stanford students or alumni. Lis
tening to a fellow student per
form adds a special dimension to
the programs. Some of the stu
dent artist performing at Tres
sider are Harriet Jacoff, Nick
Harris and the Stanford Jazz
band.
Although many of the artists
in the concerts have a reputation
from previous performances, the
union allows new or little
known musicians to gain expo

sure. The college community is
generally a very receptive audi
ence to perform for, and
being such a diverse assortment
of students, a group that
specializes in out-of-the
ordinary entertainment is likely
to draw well.
Film and Lectures
Besides the musical side of the
Tresidder Programs, art exhibits,
lectures, films and theatre are of
fered. Sales and exhibits of art
can be seen in the second-floor
display cases, second-floor
lobby, or front patio, depending
on the needs of the specific dis
play.
The lectures series operates on
a certain theme for each quarter,
and occurs in the lounge of the
second floor each Thursday
evening. This quarter's topic is
Psychic Phenomena: Widening
the Doors of Perception.
Two films, in correspondence
with the topic of the lecture
series are scheduled for Tues
day, October 26 in the second
floor lounge, beginning at 7:30.
The first film features Captain
Edgar D. Mitchell of the Apollo

14 mission in Inner Spaces. This
film studies the use of ESP and
telepathy to prove the impor
tance of intuition in daily life.
The second film, The Ultimate
Mystery, also presented by Capt.
Mitchell, illustrates the scien
tific data behind the beliefs of
mystics in the "oneness to all liv
ing things."
Variety of Artist
The theatre portion of the Tre
sidder Programs includes a per
formance by the Bureau of West
ern Mythology, specializing in
experimental theatre. The prog
ram is entitled Leaves of Living,
and features Stanford alumni
Jim Bladwin '71, William Ac
kerman '72, Richard Carp '72
and Sam Ambler '73. Their per
formances will be on November
6, 7, 11, 12, 13, and 14 in the
union's second-floor lounge.
Show time is 7:30 and tickets are
$2.50.
In regard to the procedures for
booking an artist for the Tresid
der Programs, many of the artists
come to the Program Office to
volunteer. Many of the perfor
mers realize the value of such

public appearances for a career,
if they are professional, or for
experience, if they are amateur
artists. In other cases, if a group
has a good reputation, espe
cially by means of student re
commendation, the members of
the program staff will contact the.
individual or group in consider
ation.
One of the most popular per
formances given at Tresidder
was given by the Robin William
son Band. Williamson, a former
member of The Incredible String
Band has organized a unique
group consisting of Celtic har
pist Sylvia Snyder, penny whis
tler Chris Caswell, and fiddler
Jerry McMillan.
The music presented by the
band includes English, Scottish,
and Irish numbers with such di
verse instrumentation as harp,
hammered dulcimer, penny
whistle, bagpipes, wooden flute,
accordian, fiddle, mandolin,
piano, and voice.
The Robin Williamson Band
will perform Saturday,
November 20th at 8 p.m. in the
lounge at Tresidder. Admission
will be $3.00. The band has been
reviewed in Rolling Stone and
the New Musical Express with
much praise â€” don't miss 'em!
The Tresidder Student Prog
ram Board is the group which
determines the programs at the

union, with Jean Martin serving
as an advisor to this group.
Members were recruited last
year to serve for this year. The 10
students help in planning and
carrying out activities, with a
goal of making the union serve
as a true community center.
By offering the wide variety of
talents to the Stanford audience,
the board hopes to create an
"open forum" where students
can become involved in the ex
pression of "social, cultural, re
creational and academic" in
terest. Board members take part
in all aspects of program direc
tion to determine the desires of
the students and work towards
fulfilling these requests.
Students are encouraged to
participate in the planning of fu
ture events at Tresidder by con
tacting the student members of
the board, leaving suggestions
for the Program Board at the Tre
sidder information desk or cal
ling Jean Martin at 497-4311.
Program Board members El
liot Klein (324-1740) or Paul
Jones (941-6821) can also be
reached for suggestions or vol
unteer participation in schedul
ing, organizing or publicizing
Tresidder Program events. In
