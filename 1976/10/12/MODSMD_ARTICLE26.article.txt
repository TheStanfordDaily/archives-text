# Opera shines

### Martha McGettigan 
Few people realize that the
opening production of the San
Francisco Opera season was in
spired by a California girl. A
beautiful young woman, Sybil
Sanderson, born in Sacramento
and trained in San Francisco,
amazed and incited the French
composer Jules Massenet in
creating Thais — which deals
with a "woman so beautiful, so
alluring that for her sake men
were willing to lose their hearts,
their fortunes and even their
souls and think them well lost."
The setting of this opera is
along the banks of the Nile.
Athanael, a Cenobite monk, re
turns to his peaceful community
on the banks of the Nile, full of
bitterness and distressed that the
city of Alexandria is overriden
with sin, personified in the
courtesan Thais whom he had
known earlier in pre-religious
days. He resolves to return to
Alexandria and convert her from
a life of dishonor to one of piety.
At Alexandria it is arranged
for Athanael to attend a banquet
given by a boyhood friend of his,
Nicias, that Thais will attend. On
her arrival, Thais playfully
mocks Athanael's severity but
later invites him to her home to
hear him further. On the verge of
acquiescing to his wish, she
tempts him, then sends him
away, turning to her mirror for
reassurance that her beauty will
never fade.
Undiscouraged, Athanael
waits at her threshold. Through
hours of meditation, Thais con
verts and together with
Athanael, she destroys all her
worldly possessions and follows
him to a convent.
After driving Thais re
lentlessly through the desert,
Athanael realizes that he loves
her desperately but will never
see her again after the nuns have
led her away. In a dream he sees
her dying. He rushes into the
night to the convent where Thais
is indeed dying. The frustrated
monk confesses his earthly love
passionately, but as Thais en
ters on to Eternal Life, she sees
only the Heavens and the ful
fillment of Athanael's promises.
Especially gratifying in this
somewhat pedestrian piece are
the two lead singers Beverly
Sills and Sherril Milnes whose
talent and quality fortunately
could instill in this rather dull
vehicle a radiance and vitality.
Unfortunately, a shakey Ceno
bite chorus in both the first and
the third acts did not enhance
these two marvelous singers.
The fabulous sets of designer
team Carl Toms and Tito
Capobianco, especially that of
the opulent bedroom of Thais,
and the great mirrored house of
Nicias were breathtaking.

days. He resolves to return to
Alexandria and convert her from
a life of dishonor to one of piety.
At Alexandria it is arranged
for Athanael to attend a banquet
given by a boyhood friend of his,
Nicias, that Thais will attend. On
her arrival, Thais playfully
mocks Athanael's severity but
later invites him to her home to
hear him further. On the verge of
acquiescing to his wish, she
tempts him, then sends him
away, turning to her mirror for
reassurance that her beauty will
never fade.
Undiscouraged, Athanael
waits at her threshold. Through
hours of meditation, Thais con
verts and together with
Athanael, she destroys all her
worldly possessions and follows
him to a convent.
After driving Thais re
lentlessly through the desert,
Athanael realizes that he loves
her desperately but will never
see her again after the nuns have
led her away. In a dream he sees
her dying. He rushes into the
night to the convent where Thais
is indeed dying. The frustrated
monk confesses his earthly love
passionately, but as Thais en
ters on to Eternal Life, she sees
only the Heavens and the ful
fillment of Athanael's promises.
Especially gratifying in this
somewhat pedestrian piece are
the two lead singers Beverly
Sills and Sherril Milnes whose
talent and quality fortunately
could instill in this rather dull
vehicle a radiance and vitality.
Unfortunately, a shakey Ceno
bite chorus in both the first and
the third acts did not enhance
these two marvelous singers.
The fabulous sets of designer
team Carl Toms and Tito
Capobianco, especially that of
the opulent bedroom of Thais,
and the great mirrored house of
Nicias were breathtaking.
Few people realize that the
opening production of the San
Francisco Opera season was in
spired by a California girl. A
beautiful young woman, Sybil
Sanderson, born in Sacramento
and trained in San Francisco,
amazed and incited the French
composer Jules Massenet in
creating Thais — which deals
with a "woman so beautiful, so
alluring that for her sake men
were willing to lose their hearts,
their fortunes and even their
souls and think them well lost."
The setting of this opera is
along the banks of the Nile.
Athanael, a Cenobite monk, re
turns to his peaceful community
on the banks of the Nile, full of
bitterness and distressed that the
city of Alexandria is overriden
with sin, personified in the
courtesan Thais whom he had
known earlier in pre-religious
days. He resolves to return to
Alexandria and convert her from
a life of dishonor to one of piety.
