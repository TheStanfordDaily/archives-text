The only thing more painful
than being a character in John
Schlesinger's new film
Marathon Man is being a spec
tator to it. At various times dur
ing the movie, characters fall
prey to torture, dishonesty, be
trayal, bombing, whipping,
throat slashing, incarceration,
incineration, shooting, stabbing,
strangling, suicide and seduc
tion, all in glorious living
technicolor.
To describe so much violence
as gratuitous and excessive
would be an understatement. It
is as unwarranted as it is plenti
ful. If it had a purpose, a mean
ing, it could be justified. It has no
purpose, though. No meaning.
And no justification.
It is as the film is. Marathon
Man has no purpose, nor any
meaning. Its point is indiscerni
ble among the puddles of blood
and the throbbing of pain. It is
about greed and pacifism, but
makes no logical point about
either of them.
Marathon Man's gallery of
sadists and victims span thirty
years of political ideologies from
the Nazism of the 1940s to the
apathy of the 19705. Its main
characters are a German dentist
named Szell who wants every
thing (Lord Laurence Olivier)
and a Jewish graduate student
named Babe who wants nothing
(Dustin Hoffman).
Unfortunately for Babe, Szell
comes to believe that Babe's
older brother Doc (Roy Scheider)
told him something about the
diamonds Szell extorted from
Jews before he murdered him.
Revolving around Szell's in
sidious attempts to recover the
diamonds he covets, Marathon
Man most closely resembles a
nightmare in its headlong rush
at breakneck speed. Schlesinger
not only refuses to slow the pace,
but his camera creates concen
trated images of terror with its
emphasis and detail. One exam
ple is a crowbar, powered by un
seen hands, ripping through a
doorjamb behind which Babe
cowers.
The aura of that scene and
many others is one of unreality,
just as in a nightmare, in which
coherence is just one step away,
but is still painfully inacces
sible.
Each character, as well as un
dergoing intense physical pain,
inevitably finds himself caught
up in circumstances over which

he has no control. Babe is drawn
into the web of terror because his
brother is killed; Babe's father
committed suicide because of
the witchhunts.
As in a nightmare, the charac
ters are mercilessly buffetted a
bout, unsure of their footing and
bewildered as to how to escape.
Gaping holes in the incredibly
muddled script destroy the
film's credibility. The film
hinges on contrived coinci
dences for its narrative thrust
and continuation. It begins with
a pointless and sadistic (as well
as poorly filmed and edited) traf
fic accident, in which Szell's
brother and a fellow New Yorker
venting his frustrations on the
German's car are incinerated
after colliding with an oil truck.
And when the whole bloody
mess grinds to a halt, one won
ders who is Janeway (William
Devane) and who does he really
work for? Who is Doc and who
does he really work for?
Why did Elsa (Marthe Keller)
betray Babe? Why did Karl and
Erhard mug Babe and Elsa in
Gentral Park? Whatever hap
pened to the diamonds Szell's
brother passed to Doc before he
died? How did Szell know
where Babe and Doc grew up?
How did Szell know Babe and
Doc's father?
If these sound confusing be
cause you haven't seen the
movie, don't expect to be any
more enlightened should you
see the movie, because you
won't. And as if that weren't
enough, the violence is enough
to make one gag. Compared to
Szell, Travis Bickle in Taxi
Driver was a humanitarian.
So much could have been
done with the rich characters in
the story. Important points could
have been developed about Nazi
Germany and its perpetrators,
instead of Szell being a
stereotypical sadist whose
methods, thanks to the New
Morality Of The Screen, can now
be graphically presented, leav
ing little to the imagination.
Instead of receiving a com
ment, all we have is Laurence
OlivierfLaurence Olivier!) stalk
ing the streets and warehouses of
New York City wearing a
bracelet equipped with a
switchblade dagger for easily
slashing the throat of anyone
within arm's reach. This is enter
tainment?
Since we already know that

Szell is a bloodthirsty Nazi (by
cinematic definition, the term is
redundant), his character is not
developed in the scenes of tor
ture when he probes Babe's ex
posed dental nerves without
novacaine. Is it really necessary
for him to drill Babe's teeth to
expose new nerves when he has
deadened the first? Is anything
gained?
Sadly, yes. A new low in
cinematic sadism and violence
is gained. As if Race With The
Devil and The Texas Chains aw
Massacre weren't enough, we

have to tolerate Marathon Man.
And yet these are the same
people responsible for Bulh Cas
sidy and the Sundance Kid,
Midnight Cowboy, All The Pres
ident's Men, The Day Of The Lo
cust, Jaws, Sunday Bloody Sun
day, The French Connection,
Lenny, The Graduate. Who can
we trust? What is the world com
ing to?
Because it is Dustin Hoffman,
because it is Laurence Olivier,
becase it is Roy Scheider, you'll
probably go see Marathon Man.
And you'll be sorry. Never say
you weren't warned.

Dustin Hoffman plays a Jewish graduate student named Babe
in Paramount's latest release, Marathon Man. Hopefully, Stan
ford students will not suffer from the same frustration.
