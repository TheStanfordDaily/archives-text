# Home building may put stop to trespassing

The University Dept. of Land Re
sources is investigating the feasibility
of leasing ten 3-acre sites on land be
tween Searsville Lake and Portola Road
to prospective homebuilders to help
discourage trespassing into the Jasper
Ridge area, according to Community
Relations Director Andy Doty.
"Large numbers of people make
their way onto the Ridge through
Searsville Lake, and a row of houses
along Portola Road would prevent
people from sneaking onto the
grounds for picnics," Doty said.
Doty said that the housebuilding
proposal was initiated by the Jasper
Ridge program director. Alan
Crundmann, who said he believes that
the homes would serve as a buffer
against trespassers swimming in
Searsville Lake. The university Board
of Trustees will consider closing the
lake to the general public, and the
ridge as a whole for instructional pur
poses at its meeting today.
George Burtness, assistant manager
of Land Resources, emphasized that
prospective homebuilding in the area
is merely being considered and is not
yet in the planning stage.
"Naturally, there are multitudes of
city and county regidations to be con
sidered. tests to be run, and questions
of sewage, water and road access. All
these problems must be resolved be
fore any actual plans begin." said
Burtness.
Burtness said he felt that private
homes would have "greater aesthetic
value" as a buffer than fencing.
