Fighting in Rhodesia
Salisbury, Rhodesia — An upsurge in fighting
even as blacks and whites prepare for talks on
Rhodesia's future has killed 10 black guerrillas and
10 civilians, the government reported yesterday.
Government security chiefs also said guerrillas
had shot three black civilians whose bodies were
found roped together. The initial report gave no
further detail and it was unclear immediately
whether the victims were three black nationalists
missing since last week.
Those men were members of a nationalist faction
led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa and may have fallen
victim to an outbreak of violence between
nationalist groups.
In Dares Salaam, Tanzania, a key black
nationalist leader, Robert Mugabe, said yesterday
he was pessimistic about the chances of success for
the British-sponsored Geneva conference, which is
scheduled to begin Oct. 21 and is designed to pro
duce a biracial interim government for Rhodesia.
Mugabe, a factional leader with close ties to black
Rhodesian guerrillas operating from nearby
Mozambique, said Rhodesian Prime Minister lan
Smith's insistence on white control of the army and
police in an interim government means there is
"obviously no starting point for talks."
There were reports in London yesterday that
Foreign Minister Anthony Crosland was consider
ing postponing the conference.
UAW tradesmen threaten settlement
Detroit — Chances for a quick end to the 28-day
old l ord Motor Co. strike were clouded yesterday
as a tentative contract settlement faced rejection by
rebellious United Auto Workers' (UAVV) skilled
tradesmen.
Union leaders have given the 25,000 tradesmen
veto rights on the new three-year accord even if a
majority of the 145.000UAW production workers at
the nation's second largest auto maker ratify the
agreement.
"There's no question it'll be a close vote," one
union official conceded after early returns showed
tradesmen turning down the proposed pact by a
narrow margin. "We remain hopeful it will be ap
proved, but the outcome is uncertain," the official
added.
With results in from eight of 99 skilled trades
units, the tally was 2500 for rejection and 2060 for
ratification, a UAW spokesman said.
The vote included tradesmen at the largest local
in the country. Local 600 at the Rouge complex near

Ford's world headquarters in suburban Dearborn.
The skilled workers there rejected the accord,
2269-1703. The local represents more than a quar
ter of the UAW tradesmen at 102 Ford plants across
the country.
Highlights of the new agreement include seven
additional paid days off by 1979, a three per cent
annual wage hike plus another 20 cents in the first
year, and improved fringe benefits.
Guerrillas raid two Syrian embassies
Rome — Palestinian gunmen raided the Syrian
embassies in Italy and Pakistan yesterday in an
apparently concerted campaign of revenge for
Syria's intervention against Palestinian guerrillas
in the Lebanese civil war.
In Rome, three men with submachine guns and
grenades strode into the embassy in the fashionable
Parioli district, shot and seriously wounded a dip
lomat and held five hostages for two hours before
surrendering to police.
In Islamabad, Pakistan, three Palestinians at
tacked the Syrian embassy and ambassador's resi
dence but were intercepted by police, informed
sources said.
Unconfirmed reports said one of the raiders was
killed and the other two were wounded in the ensu
ing gun battle.
The Palestinians also lobbed a grenade into a
room of Syrian Ambassador Mohammed Shahir
Dreii's house but no one was injured in the blast,
the sources said.
In Beirut, a spokesman for the Palestine Libera
tion Organization denied the guerrilla group had
any connection with either the attack in Rome or
the one in Islamabad.
Columbus Day campaigning
Washington, D.C. — A major ethnic holiday
dominated the campaign movements of President
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter yesterday as they
continued a quest for votes among immigrant
families and their descendants. Ford, in a pub
lished interview, accused his Democratic opponent
of "pure demagoguery" in recent campaign attacks.
Each candidate used a special Columbus Day
event to attempt to gain favor among predomin
antly Catholic ethnic blocs of voters, viewed by
some observers as a key to winning some populous

industrial states from the Northeast to the Midwest.
At a wreath-laying ceremony at a statue ot Chris
topher Columbus outside Washington's Union Sta
tion, Ford declared that "the people of the Old
World still look to the New World as the champion
of human rights. America has been their hope and
their help and we will never let them down."
Carter went to a Columbus Day Mass in Chicago
with Mayor Richard Daley and various Italian-
American political leaders, and was a feature at
traction of the city's Columbus Day parade.
U.S. Steel agrees to clean up air
Pittsburgh — U.S. Steel Corp. agreed yesterday to
clean up the air around the world's largest coke
producing plant by 1983 but said that such a move
could cost local jobs.
The proposed settlement to bring the nearby
Clairton Coke Works into compliance with local,
state and federal clean air standards could cost the
steel producer up to $600 million, but a spokesman
said no promise had been made to actually spend
that much.
But Allegheny County President Judge Henry El
lenbogen said that by his interpretation, "the ag
reement means that the U.S. Steel Corp. is commit
ted to spend $600 million to modernize its Clairton
Coke Works and to reduce emissions and eventu
ally meet the air quality standards."
Ruling on Gurney dismissal delayed
Orlando, Fla. — A federal judge delayed a ruling
yesterday on a defense motion to dismiss a charge
that former Sen. Edward Curney lied to a grand jury
about an alleged influence-peddling scheme.
U.S. District Court Judge Ceorge Young said he
hoped to rule this morning on the last-minute at
tempt by Gurney to avoid a perjury retrial
scheduled to begin today.
Curney's lawyer, Harris Dittmar, petitioned for
dismissal over the weekend, saying that one of the
government's chief witnesses lied during a 5V2-
month trial in Tampa last year.
