# Undergrad program evaluation planned
## 
### Lisa Lowe 
Plans for department-by-department
review and evaluation of under
graduate courses and programs this
year may be one part of the broader
project to review the current state of
undergraduate education here, ac
cording to the dean of undergraduate
studies.
Herant Katchadourian stressed that
the purpose behind the review was in
formational and not punitive.
"We simply want to go out and un
derstand the health of undergraduate
students, not because we have smelled
bad smells, but because we want to
make undergraduate education the
best it can be," he said.
"We would like to identify trends in
educational patterns, especially to lo
cate gaps and imbalance between the
pursuit of pre-professional and

broader, more liberal educational
programs." said Katchadourian.
Survey faculty, students
While Katchadourian explained that
his office is still in the process of for
mulating the method of evaluation, he
said that it would most likely be sur
veying faculty, department heads and
students to acquaint itself with dif
ferent perceptions of the under
graduate programs.
"We need to know what the faculty
thinks the present strengths and weak
nesses are and how the students
evaluate their own education," he
said.
Katchadourian indicated that all
departments involved in under
graduate education would be re
viewed.
Other program ideas developed by
Katchadourian and reported by Presi
dent Richard Lyman at the fall quarter
meeting of the Academic Council Oct.
1 include monitoring undergraduate
records to ascertain the curriculum
choices of students; initiating a study
of the pre-medical program; inves
tigating particular sources of stress for
ethnic minority undergraduates relat
ing to their education and career
choices; and reviewing and restructur
ing established programs, such as the
seminars for entering students, which
have lost some of their initial vigor.
Balanced attention
Lyman expressed "enthusiasm for
the vigor and direction" implied in
Katchadourian's program.
Lyman commented on the need for
such a review to balance attention
given to undergraduate education as
opposed to graduate education.
"However, I.am concerned that we
do not fall into the all-too-familiar
American custom of riding the pen
dulum to excess," Lyman said.
"If undergraduates are toprosperat
Stanford, as they must, it cannot be at
the expense of those intellectual ac
tivities which make us a university in
the full meaning of the word. There is
no reason why such a sacrifice should
be required." he added.
