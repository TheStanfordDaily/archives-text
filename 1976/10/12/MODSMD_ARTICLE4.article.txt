"China after Mao" was the subject
discussed by three professors last
night at Annenberg Auditorium.
Assoc. History Prof. Lyman Van
Slyke. speaking to a capacity audience
of 350, compared the panelists' dis
cussion of China and its late Chairman
Mao Tse-tung to "flies trying to knock
down a wall" â€” an old Chinese saying.
Another panelist, Assoc. Political
Science Prof. Harry Harding, refused
to comment on what he called "fifth
hand" reports that Mao's widow,
Chiang Ching, was under house arrest.
Chiang Ching has been a member of
the Chinese Politburo. Harding noted
news of "half the Politburo having
been arrested, presumably by the other
half," and gave no comment.
Van Slyke spoke during his presen
tation about "myths, contradictions
and the consciousness of risks" as they
related to Mao during his career as a
revolutionary leader.
He argued that modern China had
been created "through the myth of
Maoism," which was of central impor
tance in reuniting China, reestablish
ing its international equality and
facilitating its internal social changes.
Speaking about contradictions, Van
Slyke said that Mao was "not an
anarchist," but someone who saw the
need for organization, yet also under
stood the need for spontaneity.
Assoc. History Prof. Mark Mancall
spoke of Mao's contributions to Mar
xist theory, saying that "there are very
many Marxisms." and that if Marxism
is defined as "a rigid economic deter
minism," Mao cannot be called a Mar
xist, "and neither can Marx."
Harding spoke on possible future
developments in China with Mao
gone. There are in China, he said, very
serious disagreements about what the
country's future course should be.
The fundamental question. Harding

said, is whether the reforms of the Cul
tural Revolution should be continued
and extended or whether they should
be modified with greater attention to
production as opposed to equality of
condition.
Harding concluded by saying that
"Mao will fight the battle more than
ever posthumously. The future won't
be as revolutionary as he had hoped,
but neither will it be as revisionist as
he feared."
