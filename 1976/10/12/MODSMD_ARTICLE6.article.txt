### Randy Keith Bill Wien 
About 75 Plant Services members of
United Stanford Employees (USE)
were unsuccessful in their attempt
yesterday morning to present a list of
"demands, problems and complaints"
to Jason Mavis, director of Plant Ser
vices.
Mavis refused to discuss the issues
with the group, saying later in the
morning, "1 wasn't prepared for a mass
meeting this morning." He added that
there would probably be "two or three
dominant individuals in the meeting"
and that "I'd have to be less responsive
than I'd like."
Mavis briefly appeared before the
group and said that he would set up a
meeting "for sometime next week"
and that it would be helpful if he could
see the list before the meeting.
During the hour meeting, a USE
Plant Services shop steward, John
Leung, compiled a list of 28 issues
which the members want Mavis to re
spond to.
Three main issues
Leung said that three of the main
issues the workers wanted to discuss
with Mavis were the university's
proposal for the elimination of the
Maintenance I (Special) classification,
the increase in outside contract work
and the lack of an apprenticeship
program.
According to Leung, the elimination
of the Maintenance I (Special) classifi
cation would result in "at least four
men" being faced with no pay increase
if the union were to accept the univer
sity's present contract offer.
The university is currently propos
ing a first year pay increase of 7Va per
cent and, according to Leung, if the
men's classification was reduced to

Maintenance Class 1 they would take a
7V2 per cent pay decrease.
When asked about the alleged in
crease of outside contract work, Mavis
said that there is "no question that we
are doing somewhat more contracting
in the trades than before," and that it is
the "most economical thing to do."
'Preventive maintenance'
He said. "Plant Services is a mainte
nance organization" and that its main
job should be "preventive mainte
nance."
Roger Hardy, USE president, claims
that the reason Plant Services man
agement has chosen to increase the use
of outside contractors is that "they've
reduced themselves to the size where
they can't handle certain jobs, so they
contract them out."
Hardy also claimed that "the high
overhead" is a factor in the increase in
work contracted out and that "high
overhead is directly attributable to bad
management."
Hardy further claimed that other
"charge-out rates are two or three
times the salary of the men doing the
work."
According to Leung, Mavis "prom
ised to support an apprenticeship
program and he hasn't done anything
about it." Leung added that there is
"no plan to replace the journeymen
that are leaving through attrition."
Hardy said that by "taking away
from the number of effective produc
tive workers . . . less work will get
done and there will be fewer workers
for the supervisors to supervise. Pro
ductivity is decreased, costs increase,
we're priced right out of the market,
and then come the layoffs."
Mavis claimed that by concentrating
on preventive maintenance there will
be "increased job security."

About 75 Plant Services members of
United Stanford Employees (USE)
were unsuccessful in their attempt
yesterday morning to present a list of
"demands, problems and complaints"
to Jason Mavis, director of Plant Ser
vices.
Mavis refused to discuss the issues
with the group, saying later in the
morning, "1 wasn't prepared for a mass
meeting this morning." He added that
there would probably be "two or three
dominant individuals in the meeting"
and that "I'd have to be less responsive
than I'd like."
Mavis briefly appeared before the
group and said that he would set up a
meeting "for sometime next week"
and that it would be helpful if he could
see the list before the meeting.
During the hour meeting, a USE
Plant Services shop steward, John
Leung, compiled a list of 28 issues
which the members want Mavis to re
spond to.
Three main issues
Leung said that three of the main
issues the workers wanted to discuss
with Mavis were the university's
proposal for the elimination of the
Maintenance I (Special) classification,
the increase in outside contract work
and the lack of an apprenticeship
program.
According to Leung, the elimination
of the Maintenance I (Special) classifi
cation would result in "at least four
men" being faced with no pay increase
if the union were to accept the univer
sity's present contract offer.
The university is currently propos
ing a first year pay increase of 7Va per
cent and, according to Leung, if the
men's classification was reduced to

Maintenance Class 1 they would take a
7V2 per cent pay decrease.
When asked about the alleged in
crease of outside contract work, Mavis
said that there is "no question that we
are doing somewhat more contracting
in the trades than before," and that it is
the "most economical thing to do."
'Preventive maintenance'
He said. "Plant Services is a mainte
nance organization" and that its main
job should be "preventive mainte
nance."
Roger Hardy, USE president, claims
that the reason Plant Services man
agement has chosen to increase the use
of outside contractors is that "they've
reduced themselves to the size where
they can't handle certain jobs, so they
contract them out."
Hardy also claimed that "the high
overhead" is a factor in the increase in
work contracted out and that "high
overhead is directly attributable to bad
management."
Hardy further claimed that other
"charge-out rates are two or three
times the salary of the men doing the
work."
According to Leung, Mavis "prom
ised to support an apprenticeship
program and he hasn't done anything
about it." Leung added that there is
"no plan to replace the journeymen
that are leaving through attrition."
Hardy said that by "taking away
from the number of effective produc
tive workers . . . less work will get
done and there will be fewer workers
for the supervisors to supervise. Pro
ductivity is decreased, costs increase,
we're priced right out of the market,
and then come the layoffs."
Mavis claimed that by concentrating
on preventive maintenance there will
be "increased job security."
