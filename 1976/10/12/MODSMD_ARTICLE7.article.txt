# McCloskey says he's for Ford
## 
### Kath Scanlon 
U.S. Rep. Paul McCloskey, Republi
can candidate for the 12th congres
sional district, made it clear last night
that he is supporting President Gerald
Ford in the presidential election.
"On balance, I think we are better off
with Ford than with (Jimmy) Carter. 1
know Ford to be decent, honest and
willing to listen," said McCloskey.
McCloskey appeared at Roble House
last night, along with Rep. Bill Cohen
(R-Maine), who flew here from Maine
to campaign for McCloskey. Cohen,
who was selected by Time magazine as
one of the top young politicians in the
country, had talked earlier at Paloma
House in Florence Moore.
"The most important thing (in Con
gress) is to gain the respect of your
colleagues. McCloskey is well-known,
well-respected, and does his
homework," said Cohen.
McCloskey said that in his appear
ances here last Tuesday, he "never
said" he hadn't decided who he was
supporting for president.
"1 made four appearances, and at the
Deke (Delta Kappa Epsilon) house, the
reporter was sitting there scribbling
away. She took down what I said, and
then made an inference from it. I did
not say 1 didn't know who 1 was sup
porting," he said.
"It was a very close question as to
whom I supported for president,"
McCloskey said. "Ford will listen to
advice. From what I hear, Carter does
not like to hear advice. He makes a
decision like he has the force of God on
his side," he said.
"1 don't know where Carter is (on the
issues). He's content to ride the per
centage lead he's got and not come up
with programs," McCloskey con
tinued.
Cohen praised Ford, saying, "I don't
think there has been a more honorable
or decent man in the White House. He
never 'lusted' for the office itself. He is
comfortable in the office and doesn't
have airs about himself. Even if you do
disagree with him he wants you to
come in and talk about it."
"1 think Ford has gone his measure

to co-operate with congress," Cohen
added.
On the national economy, McClos
key said the "toughest question is
whether the work force can absorb all
the people. There are more jobs every
year but more people seeking jobs. I
don't think it (the economy) can con
tinue a 3- or 4-per cent growth rate.
"We'd have to increase the use of
energy, and the greatest concern right
now is the conservation of energy,"
said McCloskey, echoing one of his
main campaign themes.
"I have kind of a personal hope that
Henry (Kissinger) will retire this time
and leave us with a balanced foreign
policy," McCloskey said.
Concerning the John Tunney-S.I.
Hayakawa senate race, McCloskey
said, "I'm going to make up my mind
in the voting booth on that one. I do
think John Tunney has grown as a
senator, although he is not one of the
smartest people in the country."

Concerning the John Tunney-S.I.
Hayakawa senate race, McCloskey
said, "I'm going to make up my mind
in the voting booth on that one. I do
think John Tunney has grown as a
senator, although he is not one of the
smartest people in the country."
U.S. Rep. Paul McCloskey, Republi
can candidate for the 12th congres
sional district, made it clear last night
that he is supporting President Gerald
Ford in the presidential election.
"On balance, I think we are better off
with Ford than with (Jimmy) Carter. 1
know Ford to be decent, honest and
willing to listen," said McCloskey.
McCloskey appeared at Roble House
last night, along with Rep. Bill Cohen
(R-Maine), who flew here from Maine
to campaign for McCloskey. Cohen,
who was selected by Time magazine as
one of the top young politicians in the
country, had talked earlier at Paloma
House in Florence Moore.
"The most important thing (in Con
gress) is to gain the respect of your
colleagues. McCloskey is well-known,
well-respected, and does his
homework," said Cohen.
McCloskey said that in his appear
ances here last Tuesday, he "never
said" he hadn't decided who he was
supporting for president.
"1 made four appearances, and at the
Deke (Delta Kappa Epsilon) house, the
reporter was sitting there scribbling
away. She took down what I said, and
then made an inference from it. I did
not say 1 didn't know who 1 was sup
porting," he said.
"It was a very close question as to
whom I supported for president,"
McCloskey said. "Ford will listen to
advice. From what I hear, Carter does
not like to hear advice. He makes a
decision like he has the force of God on
his side," he said.
"1 don't know where Carter is (on the
issues). He's content to ride the per
centage lead he's got and not come up
with programs," McCloskey con
tinued.
Cohen praised Ford, saying, "I don't
think there has been a more honorable
or decent man in the White House. He
never 'lusted' for the office itself. He is
comfortable in the office and doesn't
have airs about himself. Even if you do
disagree with him he wants you to
come in and talk about it."
"1 think Ford has gone his measure

to co-operate with congress," Cohen
added.
On the national economy, McClos
key said the "toughest question is
whether the work force can absorb all
the people. There are more jobs every
year but more people seeking jobs. I
don't think it (the economy) can con
tinue a 3- or 4-per cent growth rate.
"We'd have to increase the use of
energy, and the greatest concern right
now is the conservation of energy,"
said McCloskey, echoing one of his
main campaign themes.
"I have kind of a personal hope that
Henry (Kissinger) will retire this time
and leave us with a balanced foreign
policy," McCloskey said.
