# Row house complaints top priority
## 
### Sean Murphy 
Investigation of complaints from
some row houses and fraternities here
that they are "not getting their
money's worth" from university-held
leases was named a top priority project
for the Residence Subcommittee of the
Committee on Services to Students
(COSS-R) at its first meeting yesterday.
Tim Ferguson, COSS-R chairman,
said the committee was one that had
been listened to by the university in
the past and said he hoped that this
relationship would continue this year.
Ferguson said COSS-R would take
an active role in addressing the follow
ing issues:
— re-examining residence priority;
— determining the cost-benefits of
the Residential Advising (RA) prog
ram;
— examining the quality and suc
cess of all theme and special program
houses;
— reviewing the possibility of ex
panding the number of residences
with subjective selection criteria (i.e.
fraternities);
— comparing the residential educa
tion program here with those at Har
vard and Yale and
— reviewing the social and educa
tional programs of the various resi
dences.
By looking at the cost-benefits of the
RA program, Ferguson suggested that
it may be discovered that students
would be better served by abolishing
the program and lowering rents in
stead.
In its review of residences with sub
jective selection criteria, the commit
tee may look into the possibility of lift
ing the 32-year-old rule banning
sororities as well as expanding the
fraternity system.
He said the items would essentially
be dealt with in order of importance
although the committee would deal
with some projects before others in
order to meet university deadlines.
For example, decisions on residence
priority should be made prior to the
printing of the spring quarter housing
draw book.
