The other day I was passing
the Career Planning and Place
ment Center, when I couldn't
help but overhear the following
conversation.
"Now remember, Bob. treat
these prospective recruits with
understanding and respect."
"But what makes them any
different from other college
seniors?"
"They're in a very fragile state
of mind. They've had a very
tough time here for three years.
Social life has gone 'under
ground.' Only here do we have
true closet socializers. Have you
ever read the grafitti on the walls
in the Biology Library?"
"There was a good one about
New York City being the black
hole of the corporate universe."
"No, no, the dirty stuff. You'd
think it was their only social out
let. It makes the Marquis deSade
look like a prude. Can't say that I
blame them. After years of living
with the 10th California girl, I'd
probably be the same way."
Secretarial pool
"I'll bet that they can't wait for
a chance to go for a swim in the
secretarial pool. But I still can't
understand why these Stanford
students are so special."
"Sshhh! Somebody might be
listening. We don't want them to
know that's what the business
world thinks of them. These are
students who attend classes with
100 people in a room designed
for 50, and 30 students in a room
built for 300. The closest most
of them get to the crazy profes
sors is the time schedule.
"They attain superior grades
while barely subsisting on food
that would qualify any third
world country for foreign-aid
vitamin supplements. And they
continue to pay more money
each year to come back and do it
again. That, my man, is blind
devotion!"
"I can think of a better
term. . .

"Now, now."
"No, I'm serious. They are ir
reverent without exception.
Now does that fit the corporate
mold?"
"Look at it this way. How long
can you fight something? A year,
two? Even if it's three, after
awhile, everyone conforms.
People need something to rally
behind."
"I don't know if I can agree
with that. Look at their football
team."
Proof
"Proves my point. The stu
dents haven't ever had anything
to root for. Why, I'll bet they
can't wait to get into the Con
glomerated, Inc. womb. Granted
there are a few incorrigibles, but
they're probably liberal arts
majors."
"Yeah, who cares about them?
Any other tips?"
"Be sure to tell them who we
are."
"Why? We've been getting
lots of news coverage since we
took over General Motors last
week."
"I take it you've never read a
Bay Area newspaper."
"No. . ."
"No news, just sen
sationalism. The finest examples
of yellow journalism in the na
tion."
"Why would anyone want to
stay here?"
"Because the unique combina
tion of money, status and in
ferior study conditions have
anesthetized all but a handful
here."
"What happened to the hand
ful?"
"They're at San Jose State. But
that's not our concern. Our goal
here is to guide these mis
directed lambs from the pas
ture."
Baa.

"Why? We've been getting
lots of news coverage since we
took over General Motors last
week."
"I take it you've never read a
Bay Area newspaper."
"No. . ."
"No news, just sen
sationalism. The finest examples
of yellow journalism in the na
tion."
"Why would anyone want to
stay here?"
"Because the unique combina
tion of money, status and in
ferior study conditions have
anesthetized all but a handful
here."
"What happened to the hand
ful?"
"They're at San Jose State. But
that's not our concern. Our goal
here is to guide these mis
directed lambs from the pas
ture."

The other day I was passing
the Career Planning and Place
ment Center, when I couldn't
help but overhear the following
conversation.
"Now remember, Bob. treat
these prospective recruits with
understanding and respect."
"But what makes them any
different from other college
seniors?"
"They're in a very fragile state
of mind. They've had a very
tough time here for three years.
Social life has gone 'under
ground.' Only here do we have
true closet socializers. Have you
ever read the grafitti on the walls
in the Biology Library?"
"There was a good one about
New York City being the black
hole of the corporate universe."
"No, no, the dirty stuff. You'd
think it was their only social out
let. It makes the Marquis deSade
look like a prude. Can't say that I
blame them. After years of living
with the 10th California girl, I'd
probably be the same way."
Secretarial pool
"I'll bet that they can't wait for
a chance to go for a swim in the
secretarial pool. But I still can't
understand why these Stanford
students are so special."
"Sshhh! Somebody might be
listening. We don't want them to
know that's what the business
world thinks of them. These are
students who attend classes with
100 people in a room designed
for 50, and 30 students in a room
built for 300. The closest most
of them get to the crazy profes
sors is the time schedule.
"They attain superior grades
while barely subsisting on food
that would qualify any third
world country for foreign-aid
vitamin supplements. And they
continue to pay more money
each year to come back and do it
again. That, my man, is blind
devotion!"
"I can think of a better
term. . .

"Now, now."
"No, I'm serious. They are ir
reverent without exception.
Now does that fit the corporate
mold?"
"Look at it this way. How long
can you fight something? A year,
two? Even if it's three, after
awhile, everyone conforms.
People need something to rally
behind."
"I don't know if I can agree
with that. Look at their football
team."
Proof
"Proves my point. The stu
dents haven't ever had anything
to root for. Why, I'll bet they
can't wait to get into the Con
glomerated, Inc. womb. Granted
there are a few incorrigibles, but
they're probably liberal arts
majors."
"Yeah, who cares about them?
Any other tips?"
"Be sure to tell them who we
are."
"Why? We've been getting
lots of news coverage since we
took over General Motors last
week."
