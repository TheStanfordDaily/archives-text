# ASSU to regain $13,500?
## 
### Emily Sachar 
The ASSU Speakers' Bureau is at
tempting to recover $13,500 which
was inadvertently paid to the Ameri
can Program Bureau.
The check, intended to be for the
amount of $1500, was to be used to pay
former Prime Minister of England
Harold Wilson for his proposed trip
here as a guest speaker this May.
Although the check was cashed,
ASSU Financial Manager Christopher
Mathe claimed that in order to fulfill
the contract made with the bureau, the
excess money will be sent back in full
within the next week and a half.
"It was a mistake, but we are going to
get the money back," Mathe said.
According to Mathe, checks in ex
cess of $750 must be stamped and co
signed by the financial manager and
the office supervisor. The bookkeeper
fills out the check after reading the
check request form. The office super
visor then reviews the check.
"1 technically could have picked out
the error. Checks made in this amount
are common and the check went
through two people. It was a fluke,"
Mathe said.
According to Mathe, the bookkeeper
thought the amount read $15,000 from
the request form and filled the check
out as such. It was not that she read one
figure and typed another, he said.
"The request form wasn't the neatest
thing in the world," Mathe said.
"We just handed Chris the check
and he signed it. He knew nothing
about it. It's already taken care of,"
said the bookkeeper in charge of ac
counts receivable, Mary Taxiera.
"The Speakers' Bureau is indepen
dent and Chris doesn't work closely
enough with them to know who
checks should be made out to and for
what amount," Taxiera said.
Mathe foresees no long-range
change of procedure after this event.
"This is certainly a fluke. All I can
say is that 1 will definitely be more
leery when she sticks checks in front of
me. She'll have to be more careful with
her zeroes when filling out the
amounts."
