# 'Wizard of Oz' denies freedom

There is a growing inclination today to call upon
the government to take the initiative in solving our
economic "crisis" through the regulation and con
trol of private enterprise. With each new crisis, gov
ernment seems to gain more control of the private
sector, growing bigger and bigger.
The principles of our free enterprise system have
been forgotten as we embark down the yellow brick
road of regulation to the Emerald City of central
economic planning.
' Our free enterprise system is not and was never
perfect. We are all aware of its problems and
shortcomings. At the same time, however, let us not
overlook its blessings. Americans enjoy the highest
standard of living in the world. Yet the unparal
leled advances of the American free enterprise sys
tem and its corresponding philosophy are
carelessly being forgotten.
Individual groups increasingly go to a govern
ment that has assumed a kind, fatherly role and
continues to grant economic favors to those who
grumble loudly enough. Many Americans have be
come so preoccupied with the system and its bugs
that they have gradually assumed an economic
philosophy contrary to free enterprise principles.
Such philosophy will ultimately lead tf> a scrap
ping of our system and a surrendering of our lives to
the wonderful Wizard of Oz â€” big government.
Golden eggs
Michael C. Jensen of the University of Rochester
believes today's economic climate is "killing the
goose that laid the golden egg." We are inthe midst
of a snowballing effect: increasing government
regulation of business will lead to central planning
and the extinction of our democratic society.
Perhaps, if we look at some of the government's
attempts to cure the capitalist goose, the inability of
governmental solutions will be made clear.
In 1973 we experienced an energy crisis. The
public was convinced that the oil industry was in
capable of supplying the American people's energy
needs.
The Wizard of Oz was then called in to solve the
energy problem. Yet today we are still dependent
upon foreign sources for the majority of our energy
needs.

If our goal is to establish a self-sufficient energy
supply, it seems reasonable to allow those men
trained and experienced in the oil industry to make
the decisions for the oil industry.
How can we expect a Washington bureaucrat to
understand the complexity of the problem and
make the right decision? Only the market
mechanism provides the adequate incentive to find
new energy sources, and to conserve old ones.
Clean environment
"But," the environmentalists scream, "the oil
companies and big business are ruining our ecol
ogy"
The question here is one of degrees. Business can
function alongside a clean environment. Stanford
Smith of the International Paper Co. writes, "to go
from 98 per cent removal of particulate matter in
smokestacks to 99.8 per cent takes four times as
much purchased energy as to go from 0 to 98 per
cent." Is that extra 1.8 per cent really worth it?
Many Washington do-gooders, oblivious to the
complexity, seem to think so. As a result, they pass
across-the-board legislation demanding clean air
regardless of the cost. Such legislation is economi
cally disastrous. We simply can't afford 100 per
cent pure air. The government must set realistic
goals for the free enterprise system.
One might ask how we are to insure business will
achieve these realistic goals without adding
employes to the government's already immense
payroll.
We must put a price on the social evil of pollu
tion. We can charge a special tax to the firm whose
performance has been substandard, and leave the
details of execution to the firm.
Regulation will continue, the public sector will
continue to grow and central economic planning
does not seem too far away. Yet proponents of cen
tral planning seem unaware of the vast complexities
of such a proposal.
Board of bureaucrats
For instance, can a board of government bureauc
rats make the decisions that millions of
businessmen and farmers across the country make
today? Can a handful of men predict and forecast
demands, account for transactions, allocate capital

and react rapidly to unanticipated events?
This is an overwhelming task. Adam Smith's in
visible hand may not perform it perfectly, hut it's
the best we've got. The market system is a rapi d and
efficient respond-er, in sharp contrast to govern
ment and its resistance to invention.
Examples of central economic planning can be
found in eastern Europe. Last year Romania experi
enced an 18 percent inflation. In 1975 prices soared
in the Soviet Union by 18.5 per cent. Inflation is not
solely a capitalist phenomenon. Central planning
has not provided the Soviets with their Emerald
City.
There is more to fear from big government than
just diminished economic welfare. As the govern
ment assumes more control of our economic lives
and freedoms, we will begin to lose our political
freedom as well.
Abuse of power
The public sector has already used its new-found
powers to take away individual property rights. For
example, bond-holders of the New York Port Au
thority, New York City and the Penn Central Rail
road have had their contractual agreements abro
gated by the respective authorities. In effect, these
creditors were denied their legal rights to the assets
of the bankrupt institutions.
These cases represent clear-cut examples of how
government can, and will, abuse power.
The constitution guarantees us certain inaliena
ble rights. Simply because individual programs
could potentially yield net societal benefits is no
justification for abrogating the rights of individu
als. These are the principles upon which our sys
tem was founded. I believe in them.
If we permit our government to continue taking
steps down the yellow brick road of regulation, we
may soon find ourselves slaves to the all-powerful
Oz. Economic and personal freedoms are insepera
ble. Let's allow the system that got us to our present
position of abundance work to solve the problems
we do have. It can if we give it a chance.
The government's role is to protect our freedoms,
not to take them away.
