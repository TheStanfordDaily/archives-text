Trim the fat
Do you know there are 1.2 admirals
for every ship in the U.S. Navy? Do you
know that between 19H4 and 1974 the
military budget was $700 billion while
only $790 billion was collected in fed
eral income taxes?
Do you know this year the federal
government will spend 16 times more
on the military than on education. 40
times more than on health research
and over 100 times more than on pollu
tion control?
No one denies the need for defense,
but by now everyone should know that
the military wastes money. It's not just
their officers' golf courses and junkets
to the Army-Navy game. Most of the
money is wasted in cost overruns and
weapons programs that are both de
stabilizing and unnecessary.
Some of the weapon systems that
should be cut include the B-l bomber,
the Trident submarine and the already
obsolete SAM-D missile.
At least $12 billion can be saved by
bri ngi ng some of the troops home from

Europe and the Far East. Our com
mitment is just as real with 50,000
soldiers in Europe as five times that
many, and the NATO nations should
carry their fair share of the cost.
Only one of the two candidates for
our local congressional seat sees a lot
of fat in the Pentagon budget. That
candidate is David Harris, the Demo
crat and challenger .The incumbent, a
retired Marine Corps reserve colonel,
doesn't even bother to mention the
military spending problem in his liter
ature.
For "Pete" it's not such a problem
anyway . . . he'll get his pension. But
for the taxpayers, who see educational
and health programs cut in order to
buy more missiles, it is not so easy.
Republicans are always in favor of
cutting back federal programs except
those for the Pentagon.
Vote to cut the military budget. Vote
for David Harris.

Unchanged attitudes
Former Secretary of Agriculture Earl
Butz' answer to John Dean's question
about why Afro-Americans don't vote
Republican showed insensitivity and
callous indifference, as did his resig
nation speech. He apologizes for. and
Ford deplores, an "unfortunate choice
of language."
That isn't the issue at all. What the
words implied is. Most blacks, as well
as most whites, can swallow (and some
may even relish) thefourand fiveletter
words Butz used in describing the al
leged preoccupations of Afro#
Americans. But Butz has not
apologized for stating that all blacks
are shiftless lumpen hedonists, unin
terested in the unspecified higher
things of life — that Republicans prize
fe.g., the farm policy?).
This stereotype which neither he
nor Ford repudiated blinds both of
them to the fact that Republicans do
not have a program that speaks to the
needs of the majority of the blacks,
chicanos, native Americans, Puerto

Ricans and Chinese in this country.
Despite emergence of a small "new
middle class" during the past two de
cades, most blacks — like most of these
other minority people — are poor and
have atrocious housing. Blacks suffer
from an unemployment rate that is
over twice that of whites, and ghetto
teenagers have an unemployment rate
that hovers around 50 percent.
To talk as Republicans do about
needing a high unemployment rate to
keep down inflation turns oft minor
ity voters. And Butz lumped the stable
black working class and the Imufe
bourgeoisie in his stereotype along
with all the rest of "the niggers." The
Butz-Ford contempt is now pitted
against Carter's "compassion."
For Butz and Ford to clean up their
language without cleaning up their at-
I itude and party behavior is the biggest
joke of all. f.et Stanford campus con
servatives ponder this a bit.
