# Number California employes declines during Brown's term
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) —During Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr.'s first year and a half in office, the
number of fulltime state employes declined by
1766 in California.
In the same period of time, part-time employes,
who work less than a 40-hour week, rose by 3996
to 21.705, State Personnel Board records show.
These figures are in sharp contrast to the ad
ministration of Brown's father, Edmund G. "Pat"
Brown, whose two terms ended in 1966.
In Brown Sr.'s terms, the fulltime employe
ranks swelled from 70,945 to 102,461. Eight years
later when Brown Jr. entered office after Republi
can Ronald Reagan, the board counter 108,393
fulltime workers. That figure is now 106,627.
Brown Jr., as everyone notes, is a man very
different from his father. His attitude toward
growth for the sake of growth is negative, and he
talks often about why government is forced to
grow.
"People have flocked into the urban centers.
That requires an expansion of government, be
cause there are more people living closer together
with less family ties, resulting in government
providing those services without which civiliza

tions don't endure," Brown said in an interview
earlier this year.
These State Personnel Board figures do not in
clude one of the biggest additions to state
employe ranks since Brown took office — an addi
tion he endorsed and fought for.
That is the Agricultural Labor Relations Board,
which started hiring employes again July 1 after a
legislative funding fight that shut the board down
last spring.
The board, which oversees secret ballot elec
tions for farm workers, now has a staff of 198,
including attorneys, field investigators and board
and administration staff.
In his first 18 months, Brown also backed some
big staff cuts. The most notable was a 2653-
person cut in the Department of Transportation.
Many of those people were placed in other state
jobs.
"Gov. Brown has made it very clear to his de
partment directors that any new programs that
involve hiring of new personnel or expenditure of
new monies must be funded out of savings result
ing from the termination of old programs," said
Gary Davis, Brown's top aide.

new monies must be funded out of savings result

Sacramento (AP) —During Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr.'s first year and a half in office, the
number of fulltime state employes declined by
1766 in California.
In the same period of time, part-time employes,
who work less than a 40-hour week, rose by 3996
to 21.705, State Personnel Board records show.
These figures are in sharp contrast to the ad
ministration of Brown's father, Edmund G. "Pat"
Brown, whose two terms ended in 1966.
In Brown Sr.'s terms, the fulltime employe
ranks swelled from 70,945 to 102,461. Eight years
later when Brown Jr. entered office after Republi
can Ronald Reagan, the board counter 108,393
fulltime workers. That figure is now 106,627.
Brown Jr., as everyone notes, is a man very
different from his father. His attitude toward
growth for the sake of growth is negative, and he
talks often about why government is forced to
grow.
"People have flocked into the urban centers.
That requires an expansion of government, be
cause there are more people living closer together
with less family ties, resulting in government
providing those services without which civiliza

tions don't endure," Brown said in an interview
earlier this year.
These State Personnel Board figures do not in
clude one of the biggest additions to state
employe ranks since Brown took office — an addi
tion he endorsed and fought for.
That is the Agricultural Labor Relations Board,
which started hiring employes again July 1 after a
legislative funding fight that shut the board down
last spring.
The board, which oversees secret ballot elec
tions for farm workers, now has a staff of 198,
including attorneys, field investigators and board
and administration staff.
In his first 18 months, Brown also backed some
big staff cuts. The most notable was a 2653-
person cut in the Department of Transportation.
Many of those people were placed in other state
jobs.
"Gov. Brown has made it very clear to his de
partment directors that any new programs that
involve hiring of new personnel or expenditure of
new monies must be funded out of savings result
ing from the termination of old programs," said
Gary Davis, Brown's top aide.
