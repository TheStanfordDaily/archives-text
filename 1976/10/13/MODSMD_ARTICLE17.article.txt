# SWOPSI studies problems
## 
### Louise Anderson 
Second in a two-part series
Stanford's Workshop on Polit
ical and Social Issues (SWOPSI)
is a student-initiated program of
fering direct involvement in
contemporary social and politi
cal problems. Students par
ticipating in the extra
departmental program analyze a
social or political problem and
design an appropriate action
project.
"All SWOPSI workshops have
an action component and an
academic component," said
Graham. "The action component
can include publishing a report,
sponsoring some sort of public
education project, and going out
and doing field research in some
area; it could also include com
ing up with a recommendation.
For example, a workshop on re
cycling may come up with some
guidelines for Stanford and pre
sent them to an appropriate
body."
This year SWOPSI is sponsor
ing public events that are as
sociated with its workshops.
"The first public event is a film
series on labor that is being done
in conjunction with our labor
class," Graham said. "We're
hoping that that class will
branch out into other classes for
winter and spring. Then we
could deal with subjects like the
Left in the Labor Movement.
"The second public event is a
debate between David Harris
and Pete McGloskey which will
take place this week. That's in
association with a class called
'Carter vs. Ford.' Part of the
academic content of that class is
going to be a speakers' series.
"We're also having Barry
Commoner,who is a professor at
the University of Washington.
He'll be speaking on Oct. 21 and
22.
All SWOPSI classes are ap
proved by a policy board made
up of faculty members, students,
and a member of the local com
munity, and a representative
from the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies. This en
sures the soundness of their
academic content. All work
shops have to have a faculty
sponsor.

Workshops are always an
couraged to work closely with
their sponsors; this is especially
true of workshops taught by un
dergraduates.
This week, Graham will visit

various student residences to
discuss SWOPSI programs and
to get student input on them.
When asked if he thought his in
terest in student-initiated prog
rams had declined, Graham said,

"I would say it hasn't declined.
It's changed form: Comparing
Stanford now with Stanford in
the late 60s, the visual part of
students taking a direct role in
their education is much less."
