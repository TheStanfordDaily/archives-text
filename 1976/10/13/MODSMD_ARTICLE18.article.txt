# Under Covers

### Dave Treinis 
Campus punsters have beseeched me to reprint
my response to a question in my first (p.e., intro
ductory) "Under Covers", written last spring.
Well, okay, ear goes:
My lover and I have discovered a rather un
usual erogenous zone-the ear! When caressed by
the fingers or (more appropriately) the lips or
tongue, the results are titillating. We are delighted
with our discovery (naturally!) hut are somewhat
baffled as to the reason why this rather unassum
ing appendage contains such hidden pleasure.
Can you offer any explanation for this phenome
non?
I'm afraid I don't know the etiology of "aural
sex", but Desmond Morris, zoologist and author
of The Naked Ape hypothesizes that the "ear
lobes . . . appear to have evolved exclusively" to
"become highly sensitized to erotic tactile stimu
lation." Thus, Morris asserts that the ear lobe is
not an evolutionary remnant, but in fact is an
active erogenous zone which "under the influ
ence of sexual arousal... becomes engorged with
blood ... and hypersensitive." Furthermore, Mor
ris asserts that there are instances where "both
males and females have reached orgasm as a result
of ear lobe stimulation."

As an interesting aside, Morris mentions that
"the side walls of the nose contain a spongy erec
tile tissue that leads to nasal enlargement . . .
during sexual arousal." Orgasm from tactile
stimulation of the olfactory appendage? Who
nose?
How do Daily editors always bastardize fairly
innocuous statements to most effectively malign
their author? Can you give an example? D.T.
Good question. Apparently, Daily editors, out
of sexual frustrations built up from working with
impotent articles, rearrange word order and/or
content until they obtain the most damaging pet
mutation possible. A pertinent example, since
you asked, was in last week's Under Covers, in
which my emphatic denial of association with the
author of last year's Under Covers was viciously
castrated.
Editor's Note: In last week's "Under Covers", a
crucial "not" was omitted from the copy, which
may have led members of the community to be
lieve that Mr. Treinis will allow smut to be pub
lished in his column. This is not the case. Our
apologies are extended.

I'm afraid I don't know the etiology of "aural
sex", but Desmond Morris, zoologist and author
of The Naked Ape hypothesizes that the "ear
lobes . . . appear to have evolved exclusively" to
"become highly sensitized to erotic tactile stimu
lation." Thus, Morris asserts that the ear lobe is
not an evolutionary remnant, but in fact is an
active erogenous zone which "under the influ
ence of sexual arousal... becomes engorged with
blood ... and hypersensitive." Furthermore, Mor
ris asserts that there are instances where "both
males and females have reached orgasm as a result
of ear lobe stimulation."

As an interesting aside, Morris mentions that
"the side walls of the nose contain a spongy erec
tile tissue that leads to nasal enlargement . . .
during sexual arousal." Orgasm from tactile
stimulation of the olfactory appendage? Who
nose?
How do Daily editors always bastardize fairly
innocuous statements to most effectively malign
their author? Can you give an example? D.T.
Good question. Apparently, Daily editors, out
of sexual frustrations built up from working with
impotent articles, rearrange word order and/or
content until they obtain the most damaging pet
mutation possible. A pertinent example, since
you asked, was in last week's Under Covers, in
which my emphatic denial of association with the
author of last year's Under Covers was viciously
castrated.
Editor's Note: In last week's "Under Covers", a
crucial "not" was omitted from the copy, which
may have led members of the community to be
lieve that Mr. Treinis will allow smut to be pub
lished in his column. This is not the case. Our
apologies are extended.
