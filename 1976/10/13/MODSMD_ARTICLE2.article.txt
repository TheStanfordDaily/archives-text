# Supreme Court declines to consider 'equal time'
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Supreme
Court yesterday declined to consider
tin "equal time" challenge to this
year's televised presidential debates
and to news conferences held by can
didates.
The court refused to review a Fed
eral Communications Commission
(FCC) ruling that political debates and
news conferences by candidates are
exempt from the equal time principle.
The equal time doctrine, shaped by
Congress in 1934, says that if one can
didate is given use of broadcast
facilities, other qualified candidates
for the same office must be given the
same opportunity.
The court, with only Justice Byron
White recording his disagreement
with the decision, said it will not con
sider an appeal to it by the Democratic
National Committee, Rep. Shirley
Chisholm (D-N.Y.), the National Or
ganization of Women and the Office of
Communication of the United Church
of Christ.
Upholds FCC ruling
The television networks, the FCC
and the League of Women Voters,
sponsor of the debates between the
presidential and vice presidential
candidates, had urged the court to let
the FCC ruling stand.
An FCC attorney, Stephen Sharp,
said the only remaining suit over the
presidential debates was filed by

Eugene McCarthy last week.
"Although the court's action today
is not holding on that case, for all in
tents and purposes it clearly makes Mr.
McCarthy's chances for success more
difficult," Sharp said.
McCarthy, a former Democratic
senator from Minnesota and now an
independent candidate for president
seeking to be included in the debates
between President Gerald Ford and
Democratic candidate Jimmy Carter,
filed his challenge in the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals here last Tuesday.
McCarthy challenge undecided
That court, which has already up
held the FCC ruling, has reached no
decision on the McCarthy case.
The FCC, in its five-two decision last
September, ruled that debates and
news conferences "may be news
events in their own right and not . . .
devoid of news value."
The Democratic National Commit
tee argued that presidential news con
ferences give unfair advantage to the
incumbent. Chisholm and the Na
tional Organization for Women called
the FCC decision "a setback for minor
ity and female candidates who , . .
traditionally have had the most dif
ficult time obtaining media exposure."
In other action yesterday, the high
court refused to reconsider its decision
striking down Louisiana's death pen
alty law.

The court ruled on July 2 that while
executions in general are constitu
tional, laws like that in Louisiana
which make capital punishment man
datory for c?rtain crimes are not.
In seeking a rehearing, Louisiana of
ficials said that a two-year-old state
constitution empowers the State Sup
reme Court to guard against uncon
stitutional application of the death
penalty.
The court also agreed to decide on
appeals in four New York cases
whether foster piarents are entitled to a
hearing before city and state officials
take away a child that has been living
with them.
A federal court has ruled that New
York's procedures for removing foster
children are unconstitutional.
The judges also agreed to review
how much power a federal judge has in
acting on habeas corpus petitions by
state prisoners who claim their rights
were violated.
Finally, the court refused to con
sider a case in which the justices were
asked to decide if an airline should be
held liable for damages suffered in a
terrorist attack.
A lower court ruled that Trans
World Airlines was liable for $75,000
per passenger in a 1973 terrorist attack
at the Athens Airport in which three
passengers were killed and 40
wounded.

how much power a federal judge has in
acting on habeas corpus petitions by
state prisoners who claim their rights
were violated.
Finally, the court refused to con
sider a case in which the justices were
asked to decide if an airline should be
held liable for damages suffered in a
terrorist attack.
A lower court ruled that Trans
World Airlines was liable for $75,000
per passenger in a 1973 terrorist attack
at the Athens Airport in which three
passengers were killed and 40

Washington (AP) — The Supreme
Court yesterday declined to consider
tin "equal time" challenge to this
year's televised presidential debates
and to news conferences held by can
didates.
The court refused to review a Fed
eral Communications Commission
(FCC) ruling that political debates and
news conferences by candidates are
exempt from the equal time principle.
The equal time doctrine, shaped by
Congress in 1934, says that if one can
didate is given use of broadcast
facilities, other qualified candidates
for the same office must be given the
same opportunity.
The court, with only Justice Byron
White recording his disagreement
with the decision, said it will not con
sider an appeal to it by the Democratic
National Committee, Rep. Shirley
Chisholm (D-N.Y.), the National Or
ganization of Women and the Office of
Communication of the United Church
of Christ.
Upholds FCC ruling
The television networks, the FCC
and the League of Women Voters,
sponsor of the debates between the
presidential and vice presidential
candidates, had urged the court to let
the FCC ruling stand.
An FCC attorney, Stephen Sharp,
said the only remaining suit over the
presidential debates was filed by

Eugene McCarthy last week.
"Although the court's action today
is not holding on that case, for all in
tents and purposes it clearly makes Mr.
McCarthy's chances for success more
difficult," Sharp said.
McCarthy, a former Democratic
senator from Minnesota and now an
independent candidate for president
seeking to be included in the debates
between President Gerald Ford and
Democratic candidate Jimmy Carter,
filed his challenge in the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals here last Tuesday.
McCarthy challenge undecided
That court, which has already up
held the FCC ruling, has reached no
decision on the McCarthy case.
The FCC, in its five-two decision last
September, ruled that debates and
news conferences "may be news
events in their own right and not . . .
devoid of news value."
The Democratic National Commit
tee argued that presidential news con
ferences give unfair advantage to the
incumbent. Chisholm and the Na
tional Organization for Women called
the FCC decision "a setback for minor
ity and female candidates who , . .
traditionally have had the most dif
ficult time obtaining media exposure."
In other action yesterday, the high
court refused to reconsider its decision
striking down Louisiana's death pen
alty law.

The court ruled on July 2 that while
executions in general are constitu
tional, laws like that in Louisiana
which make capital punishment man
datory for c?rtain crimes are not.
In seeking a rehearing, Louisiana of
ficials said that a two-year-old state
constitution empowers the State Sup
reme Court to guard against uncon
stitutional application of the death
penalty.
The court also agreed to decide on
appeals in four New York cases
whether foster piarents are entitled to a
hearing before city and state officials
take away a child that has been living
with them.
A federal court has ruled that New
York's procedures for removing foster
children are unconstitutional.
The judges also agreed to review
how much power a federal judge has in
acting on habeas corpus petitions by
state prisoners who claim their rights
were violated.
