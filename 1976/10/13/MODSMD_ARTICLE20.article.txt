# Controversial bill passes in state legislature
## Campus reaction to 'right to die' legislation 
### Bill Snyder 
The controversial Natural
Death Act, passed by the
California state assembly last
spring, has excited mixed feel
ingsamcing membersof the medi
cal community here; but the
general consensus seems to be in
support of the measure. Assem
bly Bill No. gives Califor
nia adults the right "to make a
written directive instructing
(their) physician to withhold or
withdraw life-sustaining proce

"It's a very brave law in an area
that requires input from society,
and ... which has really been
ignored and left to the physi
cians without much guidance."

dures in the event of a terminal
condition."
The bill, authored by Assemb
lyman Harry keene, (D-Eureka),
provides that no physician or
health care institution which
honors a directive will be liable
for civil or criminal action, even
if thepatient is nolongerable
to communicate.
The directive is effective for
five years and can be renewed or

revoked at any time. According
to the bill, life-sustaining proce
dures can be withdrawn or
withheld only when the patient
is "qualified," that is, "a patient
diagnosed and certified in writ
ing to be afflicted with a terminal
condition by two physi
cians ..." A terminal condition
is one in which "the application
of life-sustaining procedures
serve only to postpone the mo
ment of death ..."
Thus the act does not give pa-

tierits the right to die but does
broaden their control over the
amount of treatment they will
receive. According to California
Gov. Edmund Brown, who
signed the bill into law on Sep
tember 30, "The law in Califor
nia is very clear that people al
ready have the right to refuse
medical treatment."
Clayton Rich, dean of the Med
ical School and vice president

for Medical Affairs, said, "It's a
very brave law in an area that
requires input from society,
and . . . which has really been
ignored and left to physicians
without much guidance."
Since the law does not take ef
fect until Jan. 1, 1977, "Nobody
is really sure what the impact
will be," said Cale Mondry, staff
member of the Medical Center
legal department.
According to Rich, "(The law)
will affect the hospital exactly as
it will affect any other in the
state . . . Perhaps the situations
in which this law might be
applicable may be more, but I'm
not sure it will be."
The Medical Center hospital is
a tertiary care hospital, which
means that it is equipped with
highly specialized personel,
making treatment of persons
with serious medical problems.
Cases are referred to the hospital
for tertiary care from all over the
country and the world.
'More acutely ill'
"By and large, we are dealing
with a population of patients
who are more acutely ill than the
typical hospital," said Paul B.
Hofmann, director of the Uni
versity hospital and clinics.
"The percentage of patients
with malignancies, and cardiac
and vascular diseases is 84 per
cent higher than the California
average. Studies have shown
that the ratio of heart operations
is 6.5 per cent greater than all of
the other California hospitals,
while (the ratio) for tonsillec
tomies and appendectomies is

50 per cent less," Hofmann said.
"One indication of the in
creasing intensity of care in the
hospital," he added, is the fact
that, "25 beds are being added,
all of which are designated as
intensive care beds." At present,
there are 618 licensed beds.
The law is designed to resolve
some of the ethical dilemmas

which physicians are facing
more and more as medical
technology becomes increas
ingly sophisticated. Today, it is
possible to maintain respiration
and cardiovascular functions
indefinitely. When there is no
hope of recovery, as in a terminal
condition, it is no longer clear
whether life, or death, is being
prolonged.
Patient rights
"We deal with people who are
in the last stages of life . . . who

are being maintained by the
technology we have developed,"
said Rich. "Technical advances
are useful, but when they are
used to extend an agonizing
existence, it is something that
shatters physicians."
Currently, physicians, family
members, and clergy must de
cide whether to withdraw life
sustaining procedures. And
when there is disagreement
among them, the final judge
ment may be left up to the courts.
Hofmann believes that the pa
tient should have the right to de
termine the course of his or her
medical treatment in advance.
"The patient is the only indi
vidual truly qualified to makean
informed decision about the
quality of life he or she wishes to
maintain," he said.
In addition, the physician
needs guidelines which would
clarify the desires of his patient,
and release him from civil and
criminal liability should he act
in accordance with those de
sires.
The patient's directive would
provide these guidelines.
Vagueness criticized
The law has been criticized for
its vagueness on several points.
By limiting a life-sustaining
procedure to "any medical pro
cedure or intervention which
utilizes mechanical or other arti
ficial means," the act seems to
indicate that patients are not free
to refuse other forms of treat
ment, which in special cases
may be considered essential for
the prolongation of life.

Because the law releases the
physicians from liability if they
withhold life-sustaining proce
dures from a qualified patient,
some physicians may interpret it
to mean that from only those pa
tients who have made out a di
rective.
In response to the criticism.
Rich said, "It's better for society

... the law states that nothing
within it "shall be construed to
condone, authorize, or approve
mercy killing .. .

to take the first step than to con
tinue to bury the problem. "Rich
dpes not feel over interpretation
of. the law will occur, but if it
does, it will probably be handled
"in the courts," he said.
Perhaps the strongest criti
cism of the bill has come from
the California Pro-Life Council.
Mary Sullivan, former president
of the council and member of the
board of the National Right to
Life Committee, said that the law
was "written for the doctors."
Unless patients are clear about
the crucial implications of their
decision to mke a directive, the
law in practice "will give other
people the right to decide

whether a patient lives or dies.
Sullivan predicts that it will
lead to euthanasia.
Rich disagrees. "The initiative
of such an act (to make a direc
tive) obviously comes from the
patient, so l suspect that it will
be a very positive position. 1
can't imagine a passive act."
In fact, the law states that no-

thing within it "shall be con
strued to condone, authorize, or
approve mercy killing ..."
Sullivan's criticism points out
the need to educate patients
concerning the law. As of yet, no
one is sure how that education is
to occur.
Ernie Young, Medical Center
chaplain, worries that the direc
tive made out by a patient in
California may not be recog
nized if he is moved out of state
for treatment. "Legislation in
one state does not apply within
the general jurisdiction in
another state," he said. National
legislation would be required to
prevent this from occurring.
