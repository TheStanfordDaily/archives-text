# Bob Dylan. The story so far.
## 
### 
Boti Dylan was twenty yean old when his
first Columbia album,"Bob Dylan"was re
leased. It caused its biggest stir in New
York's Greenwich Village where Bob was
a local favorite.The liner notes included a
reprint of Robert Shelton's 1961 piece in
The New York l imes entitled."Bob Dylan:
A Distinctive Folk-Song Stylist."lt included

this memora
ble description
of Bob Dylan:
'Resembling a
cross between
a choirboy and
a beat nick, Mr.
Dylan has a
cherubic look
and a mop of
tousled hair he

partly covers with a Huck Finn black cor
duroy cap. His clothes may need a bit of
tailoring but when he works his guitar,
harmonica or piano and composes new
stings faster than he can remember them,
there is no doubt that he is bursting at the
seams with talent!' The first album con
tained a few originals like "Talkin" New
York" and "Song to Woody" and a lot of
traditional and composed folk tunes
adapted to the emerging Bob Dylan style,
including "House of the Risin'Sun,""Man
of Constant Sorrow,""Fixin'to Die;'"Pretty
Peggy-O," "Gospel Plow" and "Freight
Train Blues."

It took Peter, Paul and Mary's recording
of'Blowin'in the Wind," a tune from Bob
Dylan's second album, to direct some na
tional attention to this new songwriter.
Peter. Paul and Mary followed up their
biggest hit with another tune from"The
Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" album, "Don't
Think Twice.lt's All Right"And the move-

ment was un
der way. As
soon as people
got Bob
Dylan's album
and heard
songs like "A
Hard Rain's A-
Gonna Fall."
Masters of
War." "Oxford

Town," "Talkin'World War 111 Bluesi'and
even the lovely "Girl From the North
Country.'the word spread.Here w;is some
body who could put it into words. Someone
that had to be listened to.And since there
wasn't much of a chance to hear Bob
Dylan's most powerful songs on the radio.
an underground was bom.

rhe latest words from Bob Dylan disap
pointed no one. His"The Times They Are
A-Changin'" album took the concept of
protest music" still another step farther.
And by now the stark Bob Dylan style of
guitar, harmonica.half-singing.half-talking,
was known and accepted land was being

copied) by
people every
where. The
new songs
were exciting:
With God on
Our Side,"
One Too Many
Mornings,"
Only a Pawn in
Their Game,"

The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll."
When the Ship Comes In.""North Country
Blues," "Ballad of Hollis Brown" and "Rest
less Farewell."

In Che song "My Back Pages" Bob Dvlan
questions his role as the guru of young
America. He seems intent on changing his
image with the explanation,"! was so much
older then. I'm younger than that now.'
Most of the new songs on "Another Side of
BobDylan'are less political.more personal
It Ain't Me Babe"drives home the point

"All I Really
Want to Do!
"Motorpsycho
Nitemare," "I
Shall Be Free
No. IO.""BaIlad
in Plain D,"
"Chimes of
Freedom
"Black Crow
Blues" and"I

Don't Believe You'' all seem declarations
of freedom from his past. Clues to his
future. Bob Dylan fans wonder what's next.
Little do they suspect...

Boh Dylan's first commercial single,
Subterranean Homesick Blues."and a half
electric, half-acoustic album of enigmatic,
rocking, funny, great new tunes.That was
next. And with "Bringing It All Back
Home." the legend of the ever changing,
always pioneering musical force was born,
the songs confused a lot of people who

thought they
knew Bob
Dylan. Which
is probably the
precise effect
Bob Dylan
wanted. In
cluded are
".She Belongs to
Me,""Maggie's
Farm," "Love

Minus Zero/No Limit,"""Outlaw Blues.""Mr.
Tambourine Man." "Gates of Eden." "It's

Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),"and for
anybody who still didn't get the hint. "It's
All Over Now, Baby Blue."

"Highway 61 Revisited" was Bob Dylan's
first all-electric, no-doubt-about-the-kind
of-music-I-choose-to-make album. It con
tains his first big hit,"Like a Rolling Stone."
And it declared for all the world to hear
that Bob Dylan wasn't simply a brilliant

songwriter
but a magnifi
cent rock
vocalist as well.
The songs are
extensions of
the new cryptic
Bob Dylan
style:"II Takes
a Lot to Laugh,
It Takes a Train

toCry.""Balladof a Thin Man,""Queen Jane
Approximately." "Desolation Row." "Just
Like Tom Thumb's Blues.""From a Buick
6.""Tombstone Blues."With Michael Bloom
field on guitar, A 1 Kooper on organ and
piano, Charlie McCoy on guitar and Russ
Savakus on bass.

In a 1976 issue of C'rawdaddy, Peter Knobler
said. "No question about it, 'Blonde on
Blonde'is the best rock'n'roll record ever
made." He's not the first to feel that way.

Reviewers at
the time of its
release called
"Blonde on
Blonde" the de
finitive Bob
Dylan album,
the ultimate
rock album,
and even the
ultimatealbum.

period. It's a two-record set. recorded in
Nashville with one of the greatest backup
bands in recording history: Charlie McCoy.
Kenneth Buttrey. Joe South. Al Kooper,
Jaime Robertson, Wayne Moss and Jerry
Kennedy. And the songs: "Rainy Day
Women #12&35.""I Want You.""Memphis
Blues Again,""Just Like a Woman,""Visions
of Johanna," "Leopard-skin Pill-box Hat,"
Pledging My Time." "Most Likely You Go
Your Way and I'll Go Mine." "Temporary
Like Achilles," "Absolutely Sweet Marie,"
4th l ime Around" and "Obviously 5 Be
lievers."And the longest.and at times most
cryptic, of the Bob Dylan classics. "Sad
Eyed Lady of the Lowlands." There are
probably more worn-out copies of' Blonde
on Blonde" in existence than any other
album in American music history.

The first album of "Bob Dylan's Greatest
Hits" wits released during the long interim
between "Blonde on Blonde" and "John
Wesley Harding." It summed up all that had

gone before, ip;
eluding all of
Bob Dylan's
own hit singles
and some of
his songs that
other people
had turned in
to giant hits.
Also, it's the
onlyßobDylan

album containing his underground classic
single."Positively 4th Street."And it comes
complete with another classic: The Milton
Glaser/Bob Dylan poster.

"John Wesley Harding" was a return to sim
pler things for Bob Dylan. And soon after,
for the entire music scene. It's a mellow al
bum with some of the best Bob Dylan vocals

ever. And
some of his
most durable
songs, includ
ing "All Along
the Watch
tower." "Dear
L a n d I or d."
The Ballad of
Frankie Lee
and Judas

Priest." "I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine."
As I Went Out One Morning." "The Wicked
Messenger.""l Pity the Poor Immigrant."
'Down Along (he Cove,'"i ll Be Your Baby
Tonight." "Drifter's Escape" and "1 Am a
Lonesome Hobo."

The cover of "Nashville Skyline" tells its
story. It's Bob Dylan relaxed, unwound, lay
ing down his latest country-flavored ditties.
Once again, the musicscenequicklypicked
up on Bob Dylan's lead and country-

influenced mu
sic became the
right direction
to be headed in.
On "Nashville
Skyline."a new
Bo b Dylan
sings, "Girl
From the
North Coun
try," with

Johnny Cash. "Lay. Lady. Lay" "I Threw It
All Away," "Tonight I'll Be Staying Here
With You "and"Country Pie." All very laid
back and enjoyable.

Sell Portrait tells the story of the conflict
between the old Bob Dylan, the new Bob
Dylan, and the Bob Dylans in between.
I hey're all here, including new Bob Dylan
originals, some Bob Dylan oldies revisited
at the Isle of Wight, and. for the first time
in years, some non-original material (like
Paul Simon's "The Boxer." Gordon Light-

foot's "Early
Mornin' Rain
Copper Ket
tie," "Alberta"
Gotta Travel
On," "Blue
Moon" and
lake a Mes
sage to Mary").
Songs that fit
the story Bob

Dylan seems to he telling here. Also on
Self Portrait"(it's a two-record set): "Days
of 49.""A1l the Tired Horses.""Living the
Blues." "Wigwam." "I Forgot More Than
You'll Ever Know," "Little Sadie," "The
Mighty Quinn (Quinn the Eskimo),""Let It
BeMe!"'Belle Islell Hurts Me Too""Min
strel Boy,""Take Me as I Am (Or Let Me
Go),"among others.

Every Bob Dylan hit that wasn't included
on the first "Greatest Hits"albumandevery
hit that came since is included here, in this
two-record set'.'Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits/
Volume II." There are even a bunch of
songs never before on any Bob Dylan al

bum: "Watch
ing the River
Flow." the
single re
corded with
Leon Russell
"When I Paint
My Master
piece" and "1
Shall Be Re
leased." songs

recorded by The Band. "You Ain't Goin'
Nowhere"and "Tomorrow Is a Long Time,"
recorded by countless people, but never
Bob Dylan. And "Down in the Flood," an
old favorite from Bob Dylan's concert days
Twenty-one great hits in all. If you have all
the other albums it's a beautiful luxury. If
you don't, it's a necessity.

In "New Morning" it seems as if the old
Bob Dylan has won out. Bob Dylan never
sounded more like Bob Dylan. And every
song is a jewel:"lf Not for You,""Sign on

the Window."
"Day of the Lo
custs." "Time
Passes Slowly."
"Went to See
the Gypsy,"
"Winterlude."
"If Dogs Run
Free." "One
More Week
end." "The

Man in Me." "Three Angels" and "Father
of Night." The songs run the Bob Dylan
gamut from bitter to romantic...something
to make everyone realize that despite a
decade of changes. Bob Dylan, and nobody
else, is Bob Dylan.

"Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid" heralds a new
loosening-up periixi for Bob Dylan. With

this album, »he
man who shied
away from the
snooping eye
of the public
for so long pre
sents his first
soundtrack.
And it's a sound
track for a
movie that lists

amortg its cast one Bob Dylan, in the role of
Alias. Unlike any other soundtrack in his
tory. this one is.completely compiled and
performed by Bob Dylan, so it's not like any
soundtrack you've ever heard. Most of it
sounds like Bob Dylan, sitting around with
a few friends, making real nice music. And
as it turned out. one of the real nice songs
turned into one of Bob Dylan's biggest
singles. "Knockin" on Heaven's Door."

No individual in rock has ever heard more
different interpretations of his songs than
Bob Dylan. On"Dylan"Bob reversed roles
with people like Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez,
Jerry Jeff Walker and even Elvis, singing

songs associ
ated with them
...songs no
body would
have expected
him to sing...
and having a
good time,
making it aU
sound like...
wonder of

wonders...a Bob Dylan album! Here's the
line-up of tunes: "A Fool Such as I,""Can't
Help Falling in Love!'"Mr. Bojangles;'"Big
Yellow Taxi,""Mary Ann!'"Spanish Is the
Loving Tongue!' "Lily of the West," "The
Ballad of Ira Hayes" and "Sarah Jane."

Boh Dylan is hack.""Boh Dylan has comc
home.' "Album of the century." I he critics
couldn't say enough about "Blood on the
Tracks"the start of a new period of brutally
personal music making for Bob Dylan. All

that talk about Bob Dylan coming home
was literally (in addition to spiritually) true

Idiot Wind!'
Tangled Up in
Blue!'and"Lily,
Rosemary and
the Jack of
Hearts, "among
others, were
recorded in
M innesota
using local
musicians.

The owner of a local guitar store dropped
by to sell Bob Dylan a guitar and wound up
playing on the session. And the bass player
had to leave mid-session to play a bar date,
so "You're a Big Girl Now" was recorded
sans bass. Other classics on the "album of
thecentury"include:"Simple Twist of Fate,"
\ou're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When
YouGo,""Meet Me in the Morning,""lf You
See Her. Say Hello'' "Shelter From the
Storm" and "Buckets of Rain."

Rolling Stone declared seven albums as
"Albums of the Year" in 1975. Two of them
are on this page..."BUx)d on the Tracks"
and"The Basement Tapes!' Though it was,
indeed, released in '75, the legendary "Base

"Blonde on Blonde" and "John Wesley

Bob Dylan and
The Band were

covered by
other artists.

written about...yet until the release of this
album, few people realized the magnitude
and the quality of these recordings.Twenty
foursongs...that's toomuch to list here, but
some of the highlights include: "Odds and
Ends!' "Million Dollar Bash," "Goin' 'to
Acapulco" (among the songs never even
bootlegged), "Lo and Behold!," "Please,
Mrs. Henryr'Too Much of Nothingr"Crash
on the Levee (Down in the Flood)," "You
Ain't Goin' Nowhere,""Don't Ya Tell Henry,"
"Nothing Was Delivered," "Open the Door,
Homer" and "This Wheel's on Fire." You
get the idea.

Who could have predicted that the biggest
thing to happen to music in 1976 would be
Bob Dylan? The Rolling Thunder Revue
was headline news as it barnstormed across
the country."Desire"with its haunting new
sound, was the #1 album in the nation for a
full month. And each of the songs was
treated like a separate, special event by

reviewers and
radio folk.
Hurricane," a
hit single and
the theme of
some benefit
concerts that
later evolved
into the Roll
ing Thunder
Revue. "Joey"

about underworld figure Joey Gallo."Sara"
about a girl with the same name as Bob
Dylan's wife. "Isis," an enigmatic epic.
Mozambique," the single that was stopped
cold in its airplay tracks when a war broke
out in the real Mozambique. "Oh. Sister'
with the violin of Scarlet Rivera singing
co-lead. "One More Cup of Coffee." "Ro
mance In Durango." "Black Diamond Bay."
How much more real than this can Bob
Dylan be?

"Hard Rain"

is the definitive sound of Bob Dylan in live
performance. All the excitement of the
headline-making Rolling Thunder Revue
is captured for all time. The perform-

ances are the
best of many,
many... includ
ing songs from
nearly every
phase of Boh
Dylans career.
Completely re
visited are:
Shelter From
the Storm,"

Lay. Lady. Lay'.' "Maggie's Farm'.' "Stuck
Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues
Again'.' "1 Threw It All Away'.' "One Too
Many Mornings'.' "Oh, Sister'.' "Idiot Wind"
and "You're A Big Girl Now." Let's face it,
there have been only a handful of "live"
albums in recorded history that have had a
real reason for being. "Hard Rain" is not
onlyone of them, it could be the best of them.

If you're missing
anything on these
pages,you're really
missing something.

Bob Dylan
on Columbia Records
and Tapes*



















Boti Dylan was twenty yean old when his
first Columbia album,"Bob Dylan"was re
leased. It caused its biggest stir in New
York's Greenwich Village where Bob was
a local favorite.The liner notes included a
reprint of Robert Shelton's 1961 piece in
The New York l imes entitled."Bob Dylan:
A Distinctive Folk-Song Stylist."lt included

of Bob Dylan:

tailoring but when he works his guitar,
harmonica or piano and composes new
stings faster than he can remember them,
there is no doubt that he is bursting at the
seams with talent!' The first album con
tained a few originals like "Talkin" New

traditional and composed folk tunes
adapted to the emerging Bob Dylan style,
including "House of the Risin'Sun,""Man
of Constant Sorrow,""Fixin'to Die;'"Pretty
Peggy-O," "Gospel Plow" and "Freight

It took Peter, Paul and Mary's recording
of'Blowin'in the Wind," a tune from Bob
Dylan's second album, to direct some na

Peter. Paul and Mary followed up their
biggest hit with another tune from"The

In Che song "My Back Pages" Bob Dvlan
questions his role as the guru of young

Most of the new songs on "Another Side of

Don't Believe You'' all seem declarations
of freedom from his past. Clues to his
future. Bob Dylan fans wonder what's next.
Little do they suspect...

Boh Dylan's first commercial single,
Subterranean Homesick Blues."and a half
electric, half-acoustic album of enigmatic,
rocking, funny, great new tunes.That was
next. And with "Bringing It All Back
Home." the legend of the ever changing,
always pioneering musical force was born,
the songs confused a lot of people who

thought they
knew Bob
Dylan. Which
is probably the
precise effect
Bob Dylan
wanted. In
cluded are
".She Belongs to
Me,""Maggie's
Farm," "Love

Minus Zero/No Limit,"""Outlaw Blues.""Mr.
Tambourine Man." "Gates of Eden." "It's

Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),"and for
anybody who still didn't get the hint. "It's
All Over Now, Baby Blue."

"Highway 61 Revisited" was Bob Dylan's
first all-electric, no-doubt-about-the-kind
of-music-I-choose-to-make album. It con
tains his first big hit,"Like a Rolling Stone."
And it declared for all the world to hear
that Bob Dylan wasn't simply a brilliant

songwriter
but a magnifi
cent rock
vocalist as well.
The songs are
extensions of
the new cryptic
Bob Dylan
style:"II Takes
a Lot to Laugh,
It Takes a Train

toCry.""Balladof a Thin Man,""Queen Jane

Like Tom Thumb's Blues.""From a Buick

field on guitar, A 1 Kooper on organ and
piano, Charlie McCoy on guitar and Russ
Savakus on bass.

In a 1976 issue of C'rawdaddy, Peter Knobler
said. "No question about it, 'Blonde on
Blonde'is the best rock'n'roll record ever
made." He's not the first to feel that way.

Reviewers at
the time of its
release called
"Blonde on
Blonde" the de
finitive Bob
Dylan album,
the ultimate
rock album,
and even the
ultimatealbum.

period. It's a two-record set. recorded in
Nashville with one of the greatest backup
bands in recording history: Charlie McCoy.
Kenneth Buttrey. Joe South. Al Kooper,
Jaime Robertson, Wayne Moss and Jerry
Kennedy. And the songs: "Rainy Day
Women #12&35.""I Want You.""Memphis
Blues Again,""Just Like a Woman,""Visions

Pledging My Time." "Most Likely You Go
Your Way and I'll Go Mine." "Temporary

4th l ime Around" and "Obviously 5 Be
lievers."And the longest.and at times most
cryptic, of the Bob Dylan classics. "Sad
Eyed Lady of the Lowlands." There are
probably more worn-out copies of' Blonde
on Blonde" in existence than any other
album in American music history.

The first album of "Bob Dylan's Greatest
Hits" wits released during the long interim
between "Blonde on Blonde" and "John
Wesley Harding." It summed up all that had

gone before, ip;
eluding all of
Bob Dylan's
own hit singles
and some of
his songs that
other people
had turned in
to giant hits.
Also, it's the
onlyßobDylan

album containing his underground classic
single."Positively 4th Street."And it comes
complete with another classic: The Milton
Glaser/Bob Dylan poster.

"John Wesley Harding" was a return to sim
pler things for Bob Dylan. And soon after,
for the entire music scene. It's a mellow al
bum with some of the best Bob Dylan vocals

ever. And
some of his
most durable
songs, includ
ing "All Along
the Watch
tower." "Dear
L a n d I or d."
The Ballad of
Frankie Lee
and Judas

Priest." "I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine."
As I Went Out One Morning." "The Wicked
Messenger.""l Pity the Poor Immigrant."
'Down Along (he Cove,'"i ll Be Your Baby
Tonight." "Drifter's Escape" and "1 Am a
Lonesome Hobo."

The cover of "Nashville Skyline" tells its
story. It's Bob Dylan relaxed, unwound, lay
ing down his latest country-flavored ditties.
Once again, the musicscenequicklypicked
up on Bob Dylan's lead and country-

influenced mu
sic became the
right direction
to be headed in.
On "Nashville
Skyline."a new
Bo b Dylan
sings, "Girl
From the
North Coun
try," with

Johnny Cash. "Lay. Lady. Lay" "I Threw It
All Away," "Tonight I'll Be Staying Here
With You "and"Country Pie." All very laid
back and enjoyable.

Sell Portrait tells the story of the conflict
between the old Bob Dylan, the new Bob
Dylan, and the Bob Dylans in between.
I hey're all here, including new Bob Dylan
originals, some Bob Dylan oldies revisited
at the Isle of Wight, and. for the first time
in years, some non-original material (like
Paul Simon's "The Boxer." Gordon Light-

foot's "Early
Mornin' Rain
Copper Ket

Gotta Travel

lake a Mes

Songs that fit

Every Bob Dylan hit that wasn't included
on the first "Greatest Hits"albumandevery
hit that came since is included here, in this
two-record set'.'Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits/
Volume II." There are even a bunch of
songs never before on any Bob Dylan al

bum: "Watch

single re
corded with
Leon Russell
"When I Paint
My Master
piece" and "1
Shall Be Re
leased." songs

recorded by The Band. "You Ain't Goin'
Nowhere"and "Tomorrow Is a Long Time,"
recorded by countless people, but never
Bob Dylan. And "Down in the Flood," an
old favorite from Bob Dylan's concert days
Twenty-one great hits in all. If you have all
the other albums it's a beautiful luxury. If
you don't, it's a necessity.

In "New Morning" it seems as if the old
Bob Dylan has won out. Bob Dylan never
sounded more like Bob Dylan. And every
song is a jewel:"lf Not for You,""Sign on

the Window."
"Day of the Lo
custs." "Time
Passes Slowly."
"Went to See
the Gypsy,"
"Winterlude."
"If Dogs Run
Free." "One
More Week
end." "The

Man in Me." "Three Angels" and "Father
of Night." The songs run the Bob Dylan
gamut from bitter to romantic...something
to make everyone realize that despite a
decade of changes. Bob Dylan, and nobody
else, is Bob Dylan.

"Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid" heralds a new
loosening-up periixi for Bob Dylan. With

this album, »he
man who shied
away from the
snooping eye
of the public
for so long pre
sents his first

And it's a sound
track for a
movie that lists

amortg its cast one Bob Dylan, in the role of
Alias. Unlike any other soundtrack in his
tory. this one is.completely compiled and
performed by Bob Dylan, so it's not like any
soundtrack you've ever heard. Most of it
sounds like Bob Dylan, sitting around with
a few friends, making real nice music. And
as it turned out. one of the real nice songs
turned into one of Bob Dylan's biggest
singles. "Knockin" on Heaven's Door."

No individual in rock has ever heard more
different interpretations of his songs than
Bob Dylan. On"Dylan"Bob reversed roles
with people like Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez,
Jerry Jeff Walker and even Elvis, singing

songs associ
ated with them
...songs no
body would
have expected
him to sing...
and having a
good time,
making it aU

line-up of tunes: "A Fool Such as I,""Can't

Ballad of Ira Hayes" and "Sarah Jane."

The owner of a local guitar store dropped
by to sell Bob Dylan a guitar and wound up
playing on the session. And the bass player
had to leave mid-session to play a bar date,
so "You're a Big Girl Now" was recorded
sans bass. Other classics on the "album of

\ou're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When

Bob Dylan
on Columbia Records
and Tapes*



















Boti Dylan was twenty yean old when his
first Columbia album,"Bob Dylan"was re
leased. It caused its biggest stir in New
York's Greenwich Village where Bob was
a local favorite.The liner notes included a
reprint of Robert Shelton's 1961 piece in
The New York l imes entitled."Bob Dylan:

harmonica or piano and composes new
stings faster than he can remember them,
there is no doubt that he is bursting at the

traditional and composed folk tunes
adapted to the emerging Bob Dylan style,
including "House of the Risin'Sun,""Man
of Constant Sorrow,""Fixin'to Die;'"Pretty

It took Peter, Paul and Mary's recording
of'Blowin'in the Wind," a tune from Bob

Peter. Paul and Mary followed up their

of freedom from his past. Clues to his
future. Bob Dylan fans wonder what's next.
Little do they suspect...

Boh Dylan's first commercial single,
Subterranean Homesick Blues."and a half
electric, half-acoustic album of enigmatic,
rocking, funny, great new tunes.That was
next. And with "Bringing It All Back
Home." the legend of the ever changing,
always pioneering musical force was born,
the songs confused a lot of people who

thought they
knew Bob
Dylan. Which
is probably the
precise effect
Bob Dylan
wanted. In
cluded are
".She Belongs to
Me,""Maggie's
Farm," "Love

Minus Zero/No Limit,"""Outlaw Blues.""Mr.
Tambourine Man." "Gates of Eden." "It's

Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),"and for
anybody who still didn't get the hint. "It's
All Over Now, Baby Blue."

"Highway 61 Revisited" was Bob Dylan's
first all-electric, no-doubt-about-the-kind
of-music-I-choose-to-make album. It con
tains his first big hit,"Like a Rolling Stone."
And it declared for all the world to hear
that Bob Dylan wasn't simply a brilliant

songwriter
but a magnifi
cent rock
vocalist as well.
The songs are
extensions of
the new cryptic
Bob Dylan
style:"II Takes
a Lot to Laugh,
It Takes a Train

toCry.""Balladof a Thin Man,""Queen Jane

Like Tom Thumb's Blues.""From a Buick

piano, Charlie McCoy on guitar and Russ
Savakus on bass.

In a 1976 issue of C'rawdaddy, Peter Knobler
said. "No question about it, 'Blonde on
Blonde'is the best rock'n'roll record ever
made." He's not the first to feel that way.

Reviewers at
the time of its
release called
"Blonde on

finitive Bob
Dylan album,
the ultimate
rock album,
and even the
ultimatealbum.

period. It's a two-record set. recorded in
Nashville with one of the greatest backup
bands in recording history: Charlie McCoy.
Kenneth Buttrey. Joe South. Al Kooper,
Jaime Robertson, Wayne Moss and Jerry
Kennedy. And the songs: "Rainy Day
Women #12&35.""I Want You.""Memphis

Pledging My Time." "Most Likely You Go
Your Way and I'll Go Mine." "Temporary

cryptic, of the Bob Dylan classics. "Sad
Eyed Lady of the Lowlands." There are
probably more worn-out copies of' Blonde
on Blonde" in existence than any other
album in American music history.

The first album of "Bob Dylan's Greatest
Hits" wits released during the long interim
between "Blonde on Blonde" and "John
Wesley Harding." It summed up all that had

gone before, ip;
eluding all of
Bob Dylan's
own hit singles
and some of
his songs that
other people
had turned in
to giant hits.
Also, it's the
onlyßobDylan

album containing his underground classic
single."Positively 4th Street."And it comes
complete with another classic: The Milton
Glaser/Bob Dylan poster.

"John Wesley Harding" was a return to sim
pler things for Bob Dylan. And soon after,
for the entire music scene. It's a mellow al
bum with some of the best Bob Dylan vocals

ever. And
some of his
most durable
songs, includ
ing "All Along
the Watch
tower." "Dear
L a n d I or d."
The Ballad of
Frankie Lee
and Judas

Priest." "I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine."
As I Went Out One Morning." "The Wicked
Messenger.""l Pity the Poor Immigrant."
'Down Along (he Cove,'"i ll Be Your Baby
Tonight." "Drifter's Escape" and "1 Am a
Lonesome Hobo."

The cover of "Nashville Skyline" tells its
story. It's Bob Dylan relaxed, unwound, lay
ing down his latest country-flavored ditties.
Once again, the musicscenequicklypicked
up on Bob Dylan's lead and country-

influenced mu
sic became the
right direction
to be headed in.
On "Nashville
Skyline."a new
Bo b Dylan
sings, "Girl
From the
North Coun
try," with

Johnny Cash. "Lay. Lady. Lay" "I Threw It
All Away," "Tonight I'll Be Staying Here
With You "and"Country Pie." All very laid
back and enjoyable.

Sell Portrait tells the story of the conflict
between the old Bob Dylan, the new Bob
Dylan, and the Bob Dylans in between.
I hey're all here, including new Bob Dylan
originals, some Bob Dylan oldies revisited
at the Isle of Wight, and. for the first time
in years, some non-original material (like
Paul Simon's "The Boxer." Gordon Light-

foot's "Early
Mornin' Rain
Copper Ket
tie," "Alberta"
Gotta Travel
On," "Blue
Moon" and
lake a Mes
sage to Mary").
Songs that fit
the story Bob

Dylan seems to he telling here. Also on
Self Portrait"(it's a two-record set): "Days
of 49.""A1l the Tired Horses.""Living the
Blues." "Wigwam." "I Forgot More Than
You'll Ever Know," "Little Sadie," "The
Mighty Quinn (Quinn the Eskimo),""Let It
BeMe!"'Belle Islell Hurts Me Too""Min
strel Boy,""Take Me as I Am (Or Let Me
Go),"among others.

Every Bob Dylan hit that wasn't included
on the first "Greatest Hits"albumandevery
hit that came since is included here, in this
two-record set'.'Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits/
Volume II." There are even a bunch of
songs never before on any Bob Dylan al

bum: "Watch
ing the River
Flow." the
single re
corded with
Leon Russell
"When I Paint
My Master
piece" and "1
Shall Be Re
leased." songs

recorded by The Band. "You Ain't Goin'
Nowhere"and "Tomorrow Is a Long Time,"
recorded by countless people, but never
Bob Dylan. And "Down in the Flood," an
old favorite from Bob Dylan's concert days
Twenty-one great hits in all. If you have all
the other albums it's a beautiful luxury. If
you don't, it's a necessity.

In "New Morning" it seems as if the old
Bob Dylan has won out. Bob Dylan never
sounded more like Bob Dylan. And every
song is a jewel:"lf Not for You,""Sign on

the Window."
"Day of the Lo
custs." "Time
Passes Slowly."
"Went to See
the Gypsy,"
"Winterlude."
"If Dogs Run
Free." "One
More Week
end." "The

Man in Me." "Three Angels" and "Father
of Night." The songs run the Bob Dylan
gamut from bitter to romantic...something
to make everyone realize that despite a
decade of changes. Bob Dylan, and nobody
else, is Bob Dylan.

"Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid" heralds a new
loosening-up periixi for Bob Dylan. With

old favorite from Bob Dylan's concert days
Twenty-one great hits in all. If you have all
the other albums it's a beautiful luxury. If
you don't, it's a necessity.

In "New Morning" it seems as if the old
Bob Dylan has won out. Bob Dylan never
sounded more like Bob Dylan. And every

soundtrack you've ever heard. Most of it
sounds like Bob Dylan, sitting around with
a few friends, making real nice music. And
as it turned out. one of the real nice songs
turned into one of Bob Dylan's biggest
singles. "Knockin" on Heaven's Door."

No individual in rock has ever heard more

Boti Dylan was twenty yean old when his

Little do they suspect...

Boh Dylan's first commercial single,
Subterranean Homesick Blues."and a half
electric, half-acoustic album of enigmatic,
rocking, funny, great new tunes.That was
next. And with "Bringing It All Back
Home." the legend of the ever changing,
always pioneering musical force was born,
the songs confused a lot of people who

thought they
knew Bob
Dylan. Which
is probably the
precise effect
Bob Dylan
wanted. In

".She Belongs to
Me,""Maggie's
Farm," "Love

Minus Zero/No Limit,"""Outlaw Blues.""Mr.
Tambourine Man." "Gates of Eden." "It's

Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),"and for
anybody who still didn't get the hint. "It's
All Over Now, Baby Blue."

"Highway 61 Revisited" was Bob Dylan's
first all-electric, no-doubt-about-the-kind
of-music-I-choose-to-make album. It con
tains his first big hit,"Like a Rolling Stone."
And it declared for all the world to hear
that Bob Dylan wasn't simply a brilliant

songwriter
but a magnifi
cent rock
vocalist as well.
The songs are
extensions of
the new cryptic
Bob Dylan
style:"II Takes

piano, Charlie McCoy on guitar and Russ
Savakus on bass.

In a 1976 issue of C'rawdaddy, Peter Knobler
said. "No question about it, 'Blonde on
Blonde'is the best rock'n'roll record ever
made." He's not the first to feel that way.

Reviewers at
the time of its

"Blonde on

the ultimate

and even the

Nashville with one of the greatest backup
bands in recording history: Charlie McCoy.
Kenneth Buttrey. Joe South. Al Kooper,
Jaime Robertson, Wayne Moss and Jerry
Kennedy. And the songs: "Rainy Day
Women #12&35.""I Want You.""Memphis

Pledging My Time." "Most Likely You Go
Your Way and I'll Go Mine." "Temporary

4th l ime Around" and "Obviously 5 Be
lievers."And the longest.and at times most
cryptic, of the Bob Dylan classics. "Sad
Eyed Lady of the Lowlands." There are
probably more worn-out copies of' Blonde
on Blonde" in existence than any other
album in American music history.

The first album of "Bob Dylan's Greatest
Hits" wits released during the long interim
between "Blonde on Blonde" and "John
Wesley Harding." It summed up all that had

gone before, ip;
eluding all of
Bob Dylan's
own hit singles
and some of
his songs that
other people
had turned in
to giant hits.
Also, it's the
onlyßobDylan

album containing his underground classic
single."Positively 4th Street."And it comes
complete with another classic: The Milton
Glaser/Bob Dylan poster.

"John Wesley Harding" was a return to sim
pler things for Bob Dylan. And soon after,
for the entire music scene. It's a mellow al
bum with some of the best Bob Dylan vocals

ever. And
some of his
most durable
songs, includ
ing "All Along
the Watch
tower." "Dear
L a n d I or d."
The Ballad of
Frankie Lee
and Judas

Priest." "I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine."
As I Went Out One Morning." "The Wicked
Messenger.""l Pity the Poor Immigrant."
'Down Along (he Cove,'"i ll Be Your Baby
Tonight." "Drifter's Escape" and "1 Am a
Lonesome Hobo."

The cover of "Nashville Skyline" tells its
story. It's Bob Dylan relaxed, unwound, lay
ing down his latest country-flavored ditties.
Once again, the musicscenequicklypicked
up on Bob Dylan's lead and country-

influenced mu
sic became the
right direction
to be headed in.
On "Nashville
Skyline."a new
Bo b Dylan
sings, "Girl
From the
North Coun
try," with

Johnny Cash. "Lay. Lady. Lay" "I Threw It
All Away," "Tonight I'll Be Staying Here
With You "and"Country Pie." All very laid
back and enjoyable.

Dylan, and the Bob Dylans in between.

on Blonde" in existence than any other
album in American music history.

The first album of "Bob Dylan's Greatest
Hits" wits released during the long interim
between "Blonde on Blonde" and "John
Wesley Harding." It summed up all that had

gone before, ip;
eluding all of
Bob Dylan's
own hit singles
and some of
his songs that
other people
had turned in
to giant hits.
Also, it's the
onlyßobDylan

album containing his underground classic
single."Positively 4th Street."And it comes
complete with another classic: The Milton
Glaser/Bob Dylan poster.

"John Wesley Harding" was a return to sim
pler things for Bob Dylan. And soon after,
for the entire music scene. It's a mellow al
bum with some of the best Bob Dylan vocals

ever. And
some of his
most durable
songs, includ
ing "All Along
the Watch
tower." "Dear
L a n d I or d."
The Ballad of
Frankie Lee
and Judas

Priest." "I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine."
As I Went Out One Morning." "The Wicked
Messenger.""l Pity the Poor Immigrant."
'Down Along (he Cove,'"i ll Be Your Baby
Tonight." "Drifter's Escape" and "1 Am a
Lonesome Hobo."

The cover of "Nashville Skyline" tells its
story. It's Bob Dylan relaxed, unwound, lay
ing down his latest country-flavored ditties.
Once again, the musicscenequicklypicked
up on Bob Dylan's lead and country-

influenced mu
sic became the
right direction
to be headed in.
On "Nashville
Skyline."a new
Bo b Dylan
sings, "Girl
From the
North Coun
try," with

Johnny Cash. "Lay. Lady. Lay" "I Threw It
All Away," "Tonight I'll Be Staying Here
With You "and"Country Pie." All very laid
back and enjoyable.

Sell Portrait tells the story of the conflict
between the old Bob Dylan, the new Bob
Dylan, and the Bob Dylans in between.
I hey're all here, including new Bob Dylan
originals, some Bob Dylan oldies revisited
at the Isle of Wight, and. for the first time
in years, some non-original material (like
Paul Simon's "The Boxer." Gordon Light-

foot's "Early
Mornin' Rain
Copper Ket
tie," "Alberta"
Gotta Travel
On," "Blue

lake a Mes

Songs that fit
the story Bob

Self Portrait"(it's a two-record set): "Days
of 49.""A1l the Tired Horses.""Living the
Blues." "Wigwam." "I Forgot More Than
You'll Ever Know," "Little Sadie," "The
Mighty Quinn (Quinn the Eskimo),""Let It

Go),"among others.

Every Bob Dylan hit that wasn't included
on the first "Greatest Hits"albumandevery
hit that came since is included here, in this
two-record set'.'Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits/
Volume II." There are even a bunch of
songs never before on any Bob Dylan al

bum: "Watch

Flow." the
single re
corded with
Leon Russell
"When I Paint
My Master
piece" and "1
Shall Be Re
leased." songs

recorded by The Band. "You Ain't Goin'
Nowhere"and "Tomorrow Is a Long Time,"
recorded by countless people, but never
Bob Dylan. And "Down in the Flood," an
old favorite from Bob Dylan's concert days
Twenty-one great hits in all. If you have all
the other albums it's a beautiful luxury. If
you don't, it's a necessity.

In "New Morning" it seems as if the old
Bob Dylan has won out. Bob Dylan never
sounded more like Bob Dylan. And every
song is a jewel:"lf Not for You,""Sign on

the Window."
"Day of the Lo
custs." "Time
Passes Slowly."
"Went to See
the Gypsy,"
"Winterlude."
"If Dogs Run
Free." "One
More Week
end." "The

Man in Me." "Three Angels" and "Father
of Night." The songs run the Bob Dylan
gamut from bitter to romantic...something
to make everyone realize that despite a
decade of changes. Bob Dylan, and nobody
else, is Bob Dylan.

"Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid" heralds a new
loosening-up periixi for Bob Dylan. With

this album, »he

for so long pre

movie that lists

performed by Bob Dylan, so it's not like any
soundtrack you've ever heard. Most of it
sounds like Bob Dylan, sitting around with
a few friends, making real nice music. And
as it turned out. one of the real nice songs
turned into one of Bob Dylan's biggest
singles. "Knockin" on Heaven's Door."

No individual in rock has ever heard more
different interpretations of his songs than
Bob Dylan. On"Dylan"Bob reversed roles
with people like Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez,
Jerry Jeff Walker and even Elvis, singing

songs associ

Little do they suspect...

Boh Dylan's first commercial single,
Subterranean Homesick Blues."and a half
electric, half-acoustic album of enigmatic,
rocking, funny, great new tunes.That was
next. And with "Bringing It All Back
Home." the legend of the ever changing,
always pioneering musical force was born,
the songs confused a lot of people who

thought they
knew Bob
Dylan. Which
is probably the
precise effect
Bob Dylan
wanted. In
cluded are
".She Belongs to
Me,""Maggie's
Farm," "Love

Minus Zero/No Limit,"""Outlaw Blues.""Mr.
Tambourine Man." "Gates of Eden." "It's

Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),"and for
anybody who still didn't get the hint. "It's
All Over Now, Baby Blue."

"Highway 61 Revisited" was Bob Dylan's
first all-electric, no-doubt-about-the-kind
of-music-I-choose-to-make album. It con
tains his first big hit,"Like a Rolling Stone."
And it declared for all the world to hear
that Bob Dylan wasn't simply a brilliant

songwriter
but a magnifi

vocalist as well.
The songs are
extensions of
the new cryptic
Bob Dylan
style:"II Takes

In a 1976 issue of C'rawdaddy, Peter Knobler

made." He's not the first to feel that way.

"Highway 61 Revisited" was Bob Dylan's
first all-electric, no-doubt-about-the-kind
of-music-I-choose-to-make album. It con
tains his first big hit,"Like a Rolling Stone."
And it declared for all the world to hear
that Bob Dylan wasn't simply a brilliant

songwriter
but a magnifi

vocalist as well.
The songs are

In a 1976 issue of C'rawdaddy, Peter Knobler
said. "No question about it, 'Blonde on

Reviewers at
the time of its
release called
"Blonde on
Blonde" the de
finitive Bob
Dylan album,
the ultimate
rock album,
and even the
ultimatealbum.

period. It's a two-record set. recorded in
Nashville with one of the greatest backup
bands in recording history: Charlie McCoy.
Kenneth Buttrey. Joe South. Al Kooper,
Jaime Robertson, Wayne Moss and Jerry
Kennedy. And the songs: "Rainy Day
Women #12&35.""I Want You.""Memphis
Blues Again,""Just Like a Woman,""Visions
of Johanna," "Leopard-skin Pill-box Hat,"
Pledging My Time." "Most Likely You Go
Your Way and I'll Go Mine." "Temporary
Like Achilles," "Absolutely Sweet Marie,"
4th l ime Around" and "Obviously 5 Be
lievers."And the longest.and at times most
cryptic, of the Bob Dylan classics. "Sad
Eyed Lady of the Lowlands." There are
probably more worn-out copies of' Blonde
on Blonde" in existence than any other
album in American music history.

The first album of "Bob Dylan's Greatest
Hits" wits released during the long interim
between "Blonde on Blonde" and "John
Wesley Harding." It summed up all that had

gone before, ip;
eluding all of
Bob Dylan's
own hit singles
and some of
his songs that
other people
had turned in
to giant hits.
Also, it's the
onlyßobDylan

album containing his underground classic
single."Positively 4th Street."And it comes
complete with another classic: The Milton
Glaser/Bob Dylan poster.

"John Wesley Harding" was a return to sim
pler things for Bob Dylan. And soon after,
for the entire music scene. It's a mellow al
bum with some of the best Bob Dylan vocals

ever. And
some of his
most durable
songs, includ
ing "All Along
the Watch
tower." "Dear
L a n d I or d."
The Ballad of
Frankie Lee
and Judas

Priest." "I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine."
As I Went Out One Morning." "The Wicked
Messenger.""l Pity the Poor Immigrant."
'Down Along (he Cove,'"i ll Be Your Baby
Tonight." "Drifter's Escape" and "1 Am a
Lonesome Hobo."

The cover of "Nashville Skyline" tells its
story. It's Bob Dylan relaxed, unwound, lay
ing down his latest country-flavored ditties.
Once again, the musicscenequicklypicked
up on Bob Dylan's lead and country-

influenced mu
sic became the
right direction
to be headed in.
On "Nashville
Skyline."a new
Bo b Dylan
sings, "Girl
From the
North Coun
try," with

Johnny Cash. "Lay. Lady. Lay" "I Threw It
All Away," "Tonight I'll Be Staying Here
With You "and"Country Pie." All very laid
back and enjoyable.

Sell Portrait tells the story of the conflict
between the old Bob Dylan, the new Bob
Dylan, and the Bob Dylans in between.
I hey're all here, including new Bob Dylan
originals, some Bob Dylan oldies revisited
at the Isle of Wight, and. for the first time
in years, some non-original material (like
Paul Simon's "The Boxer." Gordon Light-

Copper Ket

Songs that fit

Every Bob Dylan hit that wasn't included
on the first "Greatest Hits"albumandevery
hit that came since is included here, in this
two-record set'.'Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits/
Volume II." There are even a bunch of
songs never before on any Bob Dylan al

single re

recorded by The Band. "You Ain't Goin'
Nowhere"and "Tomorrow Is a Long Time,"
recorded by countless people, but never
Bob Dylan. And "Down in the Flood," an
old favorite from Bob Dylan's concert days
Twenty-one great hits in all. If you have all
the other albums it's a beautiful luxury. If
you don't, it's a necessity.

In "New Morning" it seems as if the old
Bob Dylan has won out. Bob Dylan never
sounded more like Bob Dylan. And every
song is a jewel:"lf Not for You,""Sign on

the Window."
"Day of the Lo
custs." "Time
Passes Slowly."
"Went to See
the Gypsy,"
"Winterlude."
"If Dogs Run
Free." "One
More Week

Man in Me." "Three Angels" and "Father
of Night." The songs run the Bob Dylan
gamut from bitter to romantic...something
to make everyone realize that despite a
decade of changes. Bob Dylan, and nobody
else, is Bob Dylan.

"Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid" heralds a new
loosening-up periixi for Bob Dylan. With

soundtrack you've ever heard. Most of it
sounds like Bob Dylan, sitting around with
a few friends, making real nice music. And
as it turned out. one of the real nice songs
turned into one of Bob Dylan's biggest
singles. "Knockin" on Heaven's Door."

No individual in rock has ever heard more
different interpretations of his songs than
Bob Dylan. On"Dylan"Bob reversed roles
with people like Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez,
Jerry Jeff Walker and even Elvis, singing

songs associ

Little do they suspect...

Boh Dylan's first commercial single,
Subterranean Homesick Blues."and a half
electric, half-acoustic album of enigmatic,
rocking, funny, great new tunes.That was
next. And with "Bringing It All Back
Home." the legend of the ever changing,
always pioneering musical force was born,
the songs confused a lot of people who

thought they
knew Bob
Dylan. Which
is probably the
precise effect
Bob Dylan
wanted. In
cluded are
".She Belongs to
Me,""Maggie's
Farm," "Love

Minus Zero/No Limit,"""Outlaw Blues.""Mr.
Tambourine Man." "Gates of Eden." "It's

Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),"and for
anybody who still didn't get the hint. "It's
All Over Now, Baby Blue."

"Highway 61 Revisited" was Bob Dylan's
first all-electric, no-doubt-about-the-kind
of-music-I-choose-to-make album. It con
tains his first big hit,"Like a Rolling Stone."
And it declared for all the world to hear
that Bob Dylan wasn't simply a brilliant

songwriter
but a magnifi
cent rock
vocalist as well.
The songs are
extensions of
the new cryptic
Bob Dylan
style:"II Takes

piano, Charlie McCoy on guitar and Russ
Savakus on bass.

In a 1976 issue of C'rawdaddy, Peter Knobler
said. "No question about it, 'Blonde on
Blonde'is the best rock'n'roll record ever
made." He's not the first to feel that way.

Reviewers at
the time of its
release called
"Blonde on
Blonde" the de
finitive Bob
Dylan album,
the ultimate
rock album,
and even the
ultimatealbum.

period. It's a two-record set. recorded in
Nashville with one of the greatest backup
bands in recording history: Charlie McCoy.
Kenneth Buttrey. Joe South. Al Kooper,
Jaime Robertson, Wayne Moss and Jerry
Kennedy. And the songs: "Rainy Day
Women #12&35.""I Want You.""Memphis
Blues Again,""Just Like a Woman,""Visions
of Johanna," "Leopard-skin Pill-box Hat,"
Pledging My Time." "Most Likely You Go
Your Way and I'll Go Mine." "Temporary
Like Achilles," "Absolutely Sweet Marie,"
4th l ime Around" and "Obviously 5 Be
lievers."And the longest.and at times most
cryptic, of the Bob Dylan classics. "Sad
Eyed Lady of the Lowlands." There are
probably more worn-out copies of' Blonde
on Blonde" in existence than any other
album in American music history.

The first album of "Bob Dylan's Greatest
Hits" wits released during the long interim
between "Blonde on Blonde" and "John
Wesley Harding." It summed up all that had

gone before, ip;
eluding all of
Bob Dylan's
own hit singles
and some of
his songs that
other people
had turned in
to giant hits.
Also, it's the
onlyßobDylan

album containing his underground classic
single."Positively 4th Street."And it comes
complete with another classic: The Milton
Glaser/Bob Dylan poster.

"John Wesley Harding" was a return to sim
pler things for Bob Dylan. And soon after,
for the entire music scene. It's a mellow al
bum with some of the best Bob Dylan vocals

ever. And
some of his
most durable
songs, includ
ing "All Along
the Watch
tower." "Dear
L a n d I or d."
The Ballad of
Frankie Lee
and Judas

Priest." "I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine."
As I Went Out One Morning." "The Wicked
Messenger.""l Pity the Poor Immigrant."
'Down Along (he Cove,'"i ll Be Your Baby
Tonight." "Drifter's Escape" and "1 Am a
Lonesome Hobo."

The cover of "Nashville Skyline" tells its
story. It's Bob Dylan relaxed, unwound, lay
ing down his latest country-flavored ditties.
Once again, the musicscenequicklypicked
up on Bob Dylan's lead and country-

influenced mu
sic became the
right direction
to be headed in.
On "Nashville
Skyline."a new
Bo b Dylan
sings, "Girl
From the
North Coun
try," with

Johnny Cash. "Lay. Lady. Lay" "I Threw It
All Away," "Tonight I'll Be Staying Here
With You "and"Country Pie." All very laid
back and enjoyable.

Sell Portrait tells the story of the conflict
between the old Bob Dylan, the new Bob
Dylan, and the Bob Dylans in between.
I hey're all here, including new Bob Dylan
originals, some Bob Dylan oldies revisited
at the Isle of Wight, and. for the first time
in years, some non-original material (like
Paul Simon's "The Boxer." Gordon Light-

Every Bob Dylan hit that wasn't included

Bob Dylan. And "Down in the Flood," an
old favorite from Bob Dylan's concert days
Twenty-one great hits in all. If you have all
the other albums it's a beautiful luxury. If
you don't, it's a necessity.

In "New Morning" it seems as if the old
Bob Dylan has won out. Bob Dylan never
sounded more like Bob Dylan. And every
song is a jewel:"lf Not for You,""Sign on

the Window."
"Day of the Lo

Passes Slowly."
"Went to See

"Winterlude."
"If Dogs Run

Man in Me." "Three Angels" and "Father
of Night." The songs run the Bob Dylan
gamut from bitter to romantic...something
to make everyone realize that despite a
decade of changes. Bob Dylan, and nobody
else, is Bob Dylan.

"Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid" heralds a new
loosening-up periixi for Bob Dylan. With

sounds like Bob Dylan, sitting around with
a few friends, making real nice music. And
as it turned out. one of the real nice songs
turned into one of Bob Dylan's biggest
singles. "Knockin" on Heaven's Door."

No individual in rock has ever heard more

Bob Dylan. On"Dylan"Bob reversed roles
with people like Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez,

Bob Dylan
on Columbia Records
and Tapes*



















Boti Dylan was twenty yean old when his
first Columbia album,"Bob Dylan"was re
leased. It caused its biggest stir in New
York's Greenwich Village where Bob was
a local favorite.The liner notes included a
reprint of Robert Shelton's 1961 piece in
The New York l imes entitled."Bob Dylan:
A Distinctive Folk-Song Stylist."lt included

this memora
ble description
of Bob Dylan:
'Resembling a
cross between
a choirboy and
a beat nick, Mr.
Dylan has a
cherubic look
and a mop of
tousled hair he

partly covers with a Huck Finn black cor
duroy cap. His clothes may need a bit of
tailoring but when he works his guitar,
harmonica or piano and composes new
stings faster than he can remember them,
there is no doubt that he is bursting at the
seams with talent!' The first album con
tained a few originals like "Talkin" New
York" and "Song to Woody" and a lot of
traditional and composed folk tunes
adapted to the emerging Bob Dylan style,
including "House of the Risin'Sun,""Man
of Constant Sorrow,""Fixin'to Die;'"Pretty
Peggy-O," "Gospel Plow" and "Freight
Train Blues."

Bob Dylan
on Columbia Records
and Tapes*



















Boti Dylan was twenty yean old when his
first Columbia album,"Bob Dylan"was re
leased. It caused its biggest stir in New
York's Greenwich Village where Bob was
a local favorite.The liner notes included a
reprint of Robert Shelton's 1961 piece in
The New York l imes entitled."Bob Dylan:
A Distinctive Folk-Song Stylist."lt included

of Bob Dylan:
'Resembling a

a choirboy and

and a mop of

partly covers with a Huck Finn black cor
duroy cap. His clothes may need a bit of
tailoring but when he works his guitar,
harmonica or piano and composes new
stings faster than he can remember them,
there is no doubt that he is bursting at the
seams with talent!' The first album con
tained a few originals like "Talkin" New
York" and "Song to Woody" and a lot of
traditional and composed folk tunes
adapted to the emerging Bob Dylan style,
including "House of the Risin'Sun,""Man
of Constant Sorrow,""Fixin'to Die;'"Pretty
Peggy-O," "Gospel Plow" and "Freight
Train Blues."

It took Peter, Paul and Mary's recording
of'Blowin'in the Wind," a tune from Bob
Dylan's second album, to direct some na
tional attention to this new songwriter.
Peter. Paul and Mary followed up their
biggest hit with another tune from"The
Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" album, "Don't

And by now the stark Bob Dylan style of

In Che song "My Back Pages" Bob Dvlan
questions his role as the guru of young
America. He seems intent on changing his
image with the explanation,"! was so much

Most of the new songs on "Another Side of

"Chimes of

"Black Crow

Don't Believe You'' all seem declarations
of freedom from his past. Clues to his
future. Bob Dylan fans wonder what's next.
Little do they suspect...

Boh Dylan's first commercial single,
Subterranean Homesick Blues."and a half
electric, half-acoustic album of enigmatic,
rocking, funny, great new tunes.That was
next. And with "Bringing It All Back
Home." the legend of the ever changing,
always pioneering musical force was born,
the songs confused a lot of people who

thought they
knew Bob
Dylan. Which
is probably the
precise effect
Bob Dylan
wanted. In
cluded are
".She Belongs to
Me,""Maggie's
Farm," "Love

Minus Zero/No Limit,"""Outlaw Blues.""Mr.
Tambourine Man." "Gates of Eden." "It's

Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),"and for
anybody who still didn't get the hint. "It's
All Over Now, Baby Blue."

"Highway 61 Revisited" was Bob Dylan's
first all-electric, no-doubt-about-the-kind
of-music-I-choose-to-make album. It con
tains his first big hit,"Like a Rolling Stone."
And it declared for all the world to hear
that Bob Dylan wasn't simply a brilliant

songwriter
but a magnifi
cent rock
vocalist as well.
The songs are
extensions of
the new cryptic
Bob Dylan
style:"II Takes
a Lot to Laugh,
It Takes a Train

toCry.""Balladof a Thin Man,""Queen Jane
Approximately." "Desolation Row." "Just
Like Tom Thumb's Blues.""From a Buick
6.""Tombstone Blues."With Michael Bloom
field on guitar, A 1 Kooper on organ and
piano, Charlie McCoy on guitar and Russ
Savakus on bass.

In a 1976 issue of C'rawdaddy, Peter Knobler
said. "No question about it, 'Blonde on
Blonde'is the best rock'n'roll record ever
made." He's not the first to feel that way.

Reviewers at
the time of its
release called
"Blonde on
Blonde" the de
finitive Bob
Dylan album,
the ultimate
rock album,
and even the
ultimatealbum.

period. It's a two-record set. recorded in
Nashville with one of the greatest backup
bands in recording history: Charlie McCoy.
Kenneth Buttrey. Joe South. Al Kooper,
Jaime Robertson, Wayne Moss and Jerry
Kennedy. And the songs: "Rainy Day
Women #12&35.""I Want You.""Memphis
Blues Again,""Just Like a Woman,""Visions
of Johanna," "Leopard-skin Pill-box Hat,"
Pledging My Time." "Most Likely You Go
Your Way and I'll Go Mine." "Temporary
Like Achilles," "Absolutely Sweet Marie,"
4th l ime Around" and "Obviously 5 Be
lievers."And the longest.and at times most
cryptic, of the Bob Dylan classics. "Sad
Eyed Lady of the Lowlands." There are
probably more worn-out copies of' Blonde
on Blonde" in existence than any other
album in American music history.

The first album of "Bob Dylan's Greatest
Hits" wits released during the long interim
between "Blonde on Blonde" and "John
Wesley Harding." It summed up all that had

gone before, ip;
eluding all of
Bob Dylan's
own hit singles
and some of
his songs that
other people
had turned in
to giant hits.
Also, it's the
onlyßobDylan

album containing his underground classic
single."Positively 4th Street."And it comes
complete with another classic: The Milton
Glaser/Bob Dylan poster.

"John Wesley Harding" was a return to sim
pler things for Bob Dylan. And soon after,
for the entire music scene. It's a mellow al
bum with some of the best Bob Dylan vocals

ever. And
some of his
most durable
songs, includ
ing "All Along
the Watch
tower." "Dear
L a n d I or d."
The Ballad of
Frankie Lee
and Judas

Priest." "I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine."
As I Went Out One Morning." "The Wicked
Messenger.""l Pity the Poor Immigrant."
'Down Along (he Cove,'"i ll Be Your Baby
Tonight." "Drifter's Escape" and "1 Am a
Lonesome Hobo."

The cover of "Nashville Skyline" tells its
story. It's Bob Dylan relaxed, unwound, lay
ing down his latest country-flavored ditties.
Once again, the musicscenequicklypicked
up on Bob Dylan's lead and country-

influenced mu
sic became the
right direction
to be headed in.
On "Nashville
Skyline."a new
Bo b Dylan
sings, "Girl
From the
North Coun
try," with

Johnny Cash. "Lay. Lady. Lay" "I Threw It
All Away," "Tonight I'll Be Staying Here
With You "and"Country Pie." All very laid
back and enjoyable.

Sell Portrait tells the story of the conflict
between the old Bob Dylan, the new Bob
Dylan, and the Bob Dylans in between.
I hey're all here, including new Bob Dylan
originals, some Bob Dylan oldies revisited
at the Isle of Wight, and. for the first time
in years, some non-original material (like
Paul Simon's "The Boxer." Gordon Light-

Mornin' Rain
Copper Ket

Every Bob Dylan hit that wasn't included
on the first "Greatest Hits"albumandevery

songs never before on any Bob Dylan al

recorded by The Band. "You Ain't Goin'
Nowhere"and "Tomorrow Is a Long Time,"
recorded by countless people, but never
Bob Dylan. And "Down in the Flood," an
old favorite from Bob Dylan's concert days
Twenty-one great hits in all. If you have all
the other albums it's a beautiful luxury. If
you don't, it's a necessity.

In "New Morning" it seems as if the old
Bob Dylan has won out. Bob Dylan never
sounded more like Bob Dylan. And every
song is a jewel:"lf Not for You,""Sign on

the Window."
"Day of the Lo
custs." "Time
Passes Slowly."
"Went to See
the Gypsy,"
"Winterlude."
"If Dogs Run
Free." "One
More Week
end." "The

Man in Me." "Three Angels" and "Father
of Night." The songs run the Bob Dylan
gamut from bitter to romantic...something
to make everyone realize that despite a
decade of changes. Bob Dylan, and nobody
else, is Bob Dylan.

"Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid" heralds a new
loosening-up periixi for Bob Dylan. With

this album, »he

performed by Bob Dylan, so it's not like any
soundtrack you've ever heard. Most of it
sounds like Bob Dylan, sitting around with
a few friends, making real nice music. And
as it turned out. one of the real nice songs
turned into one of Bob Dylan's biggest
singles. "Knockin" on Heaven's Door."

No individual in rock has ever heard more
different interpretations of his songs than
Bob Dylan. On"Dylan"Bob reversed roles
with people like Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez,
Jerry Jeff Walker and even Elvis, singing

songs associ

The owner of a local guitar store dropped
by to sell Bob Dylan a guitar and wound up
playing on the session. And the bass player
had to leave mid-session to play a bar date,
so "You're a Big Girl Now" was recorded
sans bass. Other classics on the "album of

\ou're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When

Who could have predicted that the biggest
thing to happen to music in 1976 would be
Bob Dylan? The Rolling Thunder Revue
was headline news as it barnstormed across
the country."Desire"with its haunting new
sound, was the #1 album in the nation for a
