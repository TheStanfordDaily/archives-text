## Lodge rebuilds Card soccer 
### Dean Eyre 
Perhaps the most deceptive feature of
first-year soccer coach Nelson Lodge is
that he is still young enough to be mista
ken for one of his players.
Whether or not it is his youthful identity
which allows Lodge to communicate with
his team so effectively, one fact is clear
from talking to him and his players — they
respect and understand each other.
Rated as the top coach in the Western
Soccer Conference last year at Hay ward
State, Lodge replaced Fred Priddle, who
stepped down after 22 years on the Farm.
Soccer education
"We've been trying to offer the team a
new point of view in soccer education,"
said Lodge. Stressing fundamentals,
Lodge has revamped the Card defense.
When a coach tries to build a flew prog
ram, tension may result with holdovers.
Hut his players say this hasn't happened.
"There is hardly any element of dissen
sion on the team this year," said wing Hob
Honaparte. "The coach has shaped this
team through intelligent utilization of av
ailable resources."
One of Lodge's most pleasant surprises
is "the Stanford athlete." Said Lodge,
"Athletes here are readily able to grasp
new concepts and develop them. Stanford
athletes are motivated, intelligent and are

used to success. They won't settle for any
thing less than the best."
No super star
The Cards are 2-6 on the year. "We don't
have a standout performer, but there is an
adequate base to build from," said Lodge.
"We only have eight seniors playing, but
this team is eager to learn and perform."
"I think, that 80 per cent of this game is
mental, especially the players' attitudes
toward the coach, school and them
selves," said Lodge. "Even a mediocre
team can be turned into a capable one by
utilizing proper psychologcal prepara
tion."
Lodge stresses an individual approach
to soccer. The new coach and assistant
Phil Wright work closely with their
players, trying to give them as much per
sonal attention as possible.
Current trends
Soccer is just beginning to catch on in
this country. Lodge tries to keep current
on soccer trends by traveling to Europe.
Sportsmanship seems to be as unfash
ionable as athletes playing for the love of
the game. "An action such as shaking your
opponent's hand after the game allows
you to see him on personal terms." said
Lodge.
The first-year coach would also like to
see his players become more emotional

after scoring a goal. "Shooting the ball into
the net is the realization of many hours of
practice,'' said Lodge. "There should be a
feeling of joy in victory in fan and athlete
alike."
Under Lodge, perhaps that feeling will
be experienced more often.
