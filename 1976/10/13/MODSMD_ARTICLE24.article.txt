# 'Cards still have shot at title'
## Chris defends strategy 
### Chris Baker 
Stanford hasn't won its
Pacific-8 opener since the Cards
went to the Rose Bowl in 1972.
But despite the fact that Stanford
is in the slow lane of the
Pasadena Freeway, after losing a
10-point lead and 38-20 contest
to UCLA last Saturday, coach
Jack Christiansen still thinks his
squad has a shot at the confer
ence crown.
"We'll just have to come out
and win the next six games,"
said Christiansen at his weekly
press breakfast yesterday.
"I still think you can .win the
conference with one loss. This
conference is balanced. And
you'd have to put Washington in
that group."
But the Cards will have to back
into the title, relying on other

teams to beat UCLA. If Stanford
had not thrown four fourth quar
ter interceptions the Cards
would be in the driver's seat.
Christiansen defended his de
cision to keep the ball in the air
after the Cards had built up a
10-point lead against UCLA.
"Two years ago we ran when we
got the lead and they came back
Interceptions
"We threw the ball on some
thing like 17 of 21 plays in the
fourth quarter and that's when
we got behind. On two of the in
terceptions the ball bounced off
the receiver," said Christiansen
in his weekly press breakfast
Monday, saying, "In football,
you are what you are. A passing
team that changes that style
loses its timing and momentum.
"Remember this: Cuv Benja
min controlled the ball with his
passes in the first three quar
ters," said Donahue."lt's the first
time I've ever seen a passing
team play ball control and Ben
jamin was brilliant. He picked us
apart."
Christiansen also praised his
quarterback, who broke the Stan
ford single-game completion re
cord with 35 of 53 passes for 378
yards and two touchdowns.
"Guy played a good game,"

said Christiansen. "He should
start if he's healthy and he prac
ticed Monday." Benjamin was
replaced by Mike Cordova for
two plays last Saturday after he
re-sprained his ankle. But Chris
tiansen said that the ankle was
probably just sore.
The Cards, off to their worst
start since 1963, played their
best game of the season Saturday
and still came up short.
"The kids might have felt a lit
tle depressed, but Christmas is
over," said Christiansen.
The coach then joked with
Benjamin asking, "You don't
feel like Santa Glaus, do you?"
Stanford will be at full
strength for the first time since
the season began. "If Al Ten-
Bruggencate gets back we
shoidd have the same lineup that
we were going to start the season
with. We've got the same players
that I was so quietly enthused
about when the season started,"
said Christiansen.
Huskies, 1-0
The Cards hope to get well
quickly against Washington this
week in a rare home game. The
Huskies are 1-0 in the Pac-8, after
beating Oregon State 24-12.
Washington is 3-2 on the year.
"Washington is a good foot
ball team," said Chris. "They
play the same style as last year.
But I don't think they've been up
against a passing team."
The Cards are working on

their punting game this week.
Last year Husky wide receiver
Robert Gaines blocked two Stan
ford punts that were recovered
for touchdowns. Stanford still
came away with a 24-21 win.
"Washington rushes 10 men
and Gaines comes in from the
outside," said Chris. "We're just
going to try to slow him down a
little." Gaines, a finalist in the
U.S. Olympic trials, blocked two
James Lofton punts after punter
Mike Michel had been injured.
First test
Husky Sports Information Di
rector Chuck Neimi said, "Our
secondary has been playing well
but this game will be their real
test. We-might as well have not
taken our offense to Oregon State
last week."
Washington's offense relied
upon the defense to beat OStJ
last weekend. The Husky de
fense forced six turnovers in that
game.
Stanford has been more than
generous this year with turnov
ers. "I hope we've gotten it all
out of our system," said Chris.
Cardinal notes . . . UCLA's
Sports Information Director Vic
Kelley discovered an error in the
game statistics. Tony Hill has
now been credited with in
catches for 172 yards, instead of
nine for 166. He now has 1812
career yards . . . Benjamin threw
for 35 of 53 passes and not 35 of
54.

ter interceptions the Cards
would be in the driver's seat.
Christiansen defended his de
cision to keep the ball in the air
after the Cards had built up a
10-point lead against UCLA.
"Two years ago we ran when we
got the lead and they came back
Interceptions
"We threw the ball on some
thing like 17 of 21 plays in the
fourth quarter and that's when
we got behind. On two of the in
terceptions the ball bounced off
the receiver," said Christiansen
in his weekly press breakfast
Monday, saying, "In football,
you are what you are. A passing
team that changes that style
loses its timing and momentum.
"Remember this: Cuv Benja
min controlled the ball with his
passes in the first three quar
ters," said Donahue."lt's the first
time I've ever seen a passing
team play ball control and Ben
jamin was brilliant. He picked us
apart."
Christiansen also praised his
quarterback, who broke the Stan
ford single-game completion re
cord with 35 of 53 passes for 378
yards and two touchdowns.
"Guy played a good game,"

said Christiansen. "He should
start if he's healthy and he prac
ticed Monday." Benjamin was
replaced by Mike Cordova for
two plays last Saturday after he
re-sprained his ankle. But Chris
tiansen said that the ankle was
probably just sore.
The Cards, off to their worst
start since 1963, played their
best game of the season Saturday
and still came up short.
"The kids might have felt a lit
tle depressed, but Christmas is
over," said Christiansen.
The coach then joked with
Benjamin asking, "You don't
feel like Santa Glaus, do you?"
Stanford will be at full
strength for the first time since
the season began. "If Al Ten-
Bruggencate gets back we
shoidd have the same lineup that
we were going to start the season
with. We've got the same players
that I was so quietly enthused
about when the season started,"
said Christiansen.
Huskies, 1-0
The Cards hope to get well
quickly against Washington this
week in a rare home game. The
Huskies are 1-0 in the Pac-8, after
beating Oregon State 24-12.
Washington is 3-2 on the year.
"Washington is a good foot
ball team," said Chris. "They
play the same style as last year.
But I don't think they've been up
against a passing team."
The Cards are working on

their punting game this week.
Last year Husky wide receiver
Robert Gaines blocked two Stan
ford punts that were recovered
for touchdowns. Stanford still
came away with a 24-21 win.
"Washington rushes 10 men
and Gaines comes in from the
outside," said Chris. "We're just
going to try to slow him down a
little." Gaines, a finalist in the
U.S. Olympic trials, blocked two
James Lofton punts after punter
Mike Michel had been injured.
First test
Husky Sports Information Di
rector Chuck Neimi said, "Our
secondary has been playing well
but this game will be their real
test. We-might as well have not
taken our offense to Oregon State
last week."
Washington's offense relied
upon the defense to beat OStJ
last weekend. The Husky de
fense forced six turnovers in that
game.
Stanford has been more than
generous this year with turnov
ers. "I hope we've gotten it all
out of our system," said Chris.

Washington fullback Robin Earl, 6-foot-5, 250-pounds, is the Huskies' second leading rusher
with 440 yards. Stanford held Earl to just 33 yards in the Cards' 24-21 win over the Huskies last
year.
Stanford hasn't won its
Pacific-8 opener since the Cards
went to the Rose Bowl in 1972.
But despite the fact that Stanford
is in the slow lane of the
Pasadena Freeway, after losing a
10-point lead and 38-20 contest
to UCLA last Saturday, coach
Jack Christiansen still thinks his
squad has a shot at the confer
ence crown.
"We'll just have to come out
and win the next six games,"
said Christiansen at his weekly
press breakfast yesterday.
"I still think you can .win the
conference with one loss. This
conference is balanced. And
you'd have to put Washington in
that group."
But the Cards will have to back
into the title, relying on other

teams to beat UCLA. If Stanford

time I've ever seen a passing
team play ball control and Ben
jamin was brilliant. He picked us
apart."
Christiansen also praised his
quarterback, who broke the Stan
ford single-game completion re
cord with 35 of 53 passes for 378
yards and two touchdowns.
"Guy played a good game,"

said Christiansen. "He should
start if he's healthy and he prac
ticed Monday." Benjamin was
replaced by Mike Cordova for
two plays last Saturday after he
re-sprained his ankle. But Chris
tiansen said that the ankle was
probably just sore.
The Cards, off to their worst
start since 1963, played their
best game of the season Saturday
and still came up short.
"The kids might have felt a lit
tle depressed, but Christmas is
over," said Christiansen.
The coach then joked with
Benjamin asking, "You don't
feel like Santa Glaus, do you?"
Stanford will be at full
strength for the first time since
the season began. "If Al Ten-
Bruggencate gets back we
shoidd have the same lineup that
we were going to start the season
with. We've got the same players
that I was so quietly enthused
about when the season started,"
said Christiansen.
Huskies, 1-0
The Cards hope to get well
quickly against Washington this
week in a rare home game. The
Huskies are 1-0 in the Pac-8, after
beating Oregon State 24-12.
Washington is 3-2 on the year.
"Washington is a good foot
ball team," said Chris. "They
play the same style as last year.
But I don't think they've been up
against a passing team."
The Cards are working on

their punting game this week.
Last year Husky wide receiver
Robert Gaines blocked two Stan
ford punts that were recovered
for touchdowns. Stanford still
came away with a 24-21 win.
"Washington rushes 10 men
and Gaines comes in from the
outside," said Chris. "We're just
going to try to slow him down a
little." Gaines, a finalist in the
U.S. Olympic trials, blocked two
James Lofton punts after punter
Mike Michel had been injured.
First test
Husky Sports Information Di
rector Chuck Neimi said, "Our
secondary has been playing well
but this game will be their real
test. We-might as well have not
taken our offense to Oregon State
last week."
Washington's offense relied
upon the defense to beat OStJ
last weekend. The Husky de
fense forced six turnovers in that
game.
Stanford has been more than
generous this year with turnov
ers. "I hope we've gotten it all
out of our system," said Chris.
Cardinal notes . . . UCLA's
Sports Information Director Vic
Kelley discovered an error in the
game statistics. Tony Hill has
now been credited with in
catches for 172 yards, instead of
nine for 166. He now has 1812
career yards . . . Benjamin threw
for 35 of 53 passes and not 35 of
54.

Husky fullback
Washington fullback Robin Earl, 6-foot-5, 250-pounds, is the Huskies' second leading rusher
with 440 yards. Stanford held Earl to just 33 yards in the Cards' 24-21 win over the Huskies last
year.
Stanford hasn't won its
Pacific-8 opener since the Cards
went to the Rose Bowl in 1972.
But despite the fact that Stanford
is in the slow lane of the
Pasadena Freeway, after losing a
10-point lead and 38-20 contest
to UCLA last Saturday, coach
Jack Christiansen still thinks his
squad has a shot at the confer
ence crown.
"We'll just have to come out
and win the next six games,"
said Christiansen at his weekly
press breakfast yesterday.
"I still think you can .win the
conference with one loss. This
conference is balanced. And
you'd have to put Washington in
that group."
But the Cards will have to back
into the title, relying on other

teams to beat UCLA. If Stanford
had not thrown four fourth quar
ter interceptions the Cards
would be in the driver's seat.
Christiansen defended his de
cision to keep the ball in the air
after the Cards had built up a
10-point lead against UCLA.
"Two years ago we ran when we
got the lead and they came back
Interceptions
"We threw the ball on some
thing like 17 of 21 plays in the
fourth quarter and that's when
we got behind. On two of the in
terceptions the ball bounced off
the receiver," said Christiansen
in his weekly press breakfast
Monday, saying, "In football,
you are what you are. A passing
team that changes that style
loses its timing and momentum.
"Remember this: Cuv Benja
min controlled the ball with his
passes in the first three quar
ters," said Donahue."lt's the first
time I've ever seen a passing
team play ball control and Ben
jamin was brilliant. He picked us
apart."
