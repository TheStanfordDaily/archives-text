# Between the lines
## Grid changes needed 
### Mike Tollin 
It is late Saturday night in the cool, dark
recesses of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum:
Terry Donahue, a pleasant, mild-mannered
Californian, of 32 years.clutches a lukewarm
beer in his not-so-steady left hand. With his
right, Donahue works on the unending stream
of perspiration forming on his forehead and
quietly fends off an overzealous reporter who
is threatening his tonsils with a microphone.
"They were fantastic," Donahue offers gal
lantly. "They were better prepared for this
game than any Stanford team I've seen in five
years. They played us off our feet."
At the other end of the Coliseum, Jack Chris
tiansen, a rather large, rudely man of 48,
slumps disconsolately in his chair, hands
folded neatly in his lap, a wry, impatient ex
pression crossing his face.
An observer gets the feeling that Christian
sen lias been through this before. "What went
wrong?" . . . ."Is this the best team you've
faced?" . . . "How about those turnovers?"
. . .The drone of forced questions and
mechanical answers goes on and on. "Is this
the best game you've played?"
Finally, Christiansen looks up sharply.
"They're always better when you win," he
says. "Tonight, we lost."
After a four-year Rose Bowl drought, Christ
iansen was confident that this would be "The
Year" for Stanford. All of those lcttermen were
back,.Duncan McColl was making his dad Bill
a celebrity again, PA announcer Ed McCauley
was practicing the sure-to-be familiar refrain,
"Benjamin, complete to Hill."
But now, after five games, Stanford's foot
ball Cardinals are 1-4, their worst start in 13
years, and people are wondering if there will
even be a next year for Christiansen.
What has gone wrong this year? Well, you
name it. In Penn State it was a costly penalty
and a slew of penalties. Tack on an injury to
Tony Hill. In Ann Arbor, Michigan.. .well, try
ing to analyze that one wouldbelike dissecting
a hurricane.
Back home with San Jose State, Guy started,
Cordova was booed, and Christiansen winced.
But the refs were on Stanford's side, and the
Cards maintained their undefeated home re
cord!!
But now Benjamin was hurt. Somehow,
Cordova to Mulroy doesn't have the ring. A
20-point lead dried up in West Point faster

than the Cadets could say, "Hut, two, three,"
and Mike Michel flunked a course entitled
"Introduction to the Drama of Last-Second
Field Goal Kicking."
Guy Benjamin and Tony Hill finally got
back together in L.A. and seemed determined
to make people forget a couple of guys named
Plunkett and Vataha. The offensive line set up
like the Wall of China. The defense was heard
snorting, "Veer, Schmeer," and in the fourth
quarter, is was Stanford 20, IJCLA 10.
At this point, Johnny Carson might say,
"End of joke." But this one was for real, and
the punch line was still to come. When it
came, that 28-point turnaround, a couple of
Stanford youths who had risked a month's
rent on the Cards and 16 points were seen
jumping off the upper deck of the Coliseum.
The less dramatic among us were left to sort
out the rubble. Was it Benjamin's fault, this
latest loss? Well, blaming him would be like
drinking too many beers and blaming Adolph
Coors for your hangover. Terry Donahue said,
"I can't imagine a quarterback playing any
better than Benjamin did." Enough said.
Plain and simple, Stanford lost a game it
could and should have won Saturday night. It
was the third such affair this season. Mis
takes? Not enough confidence? Lack of lead
ership? Too much of that old Stanford favo
rite, "perspective"? Or just bad luck?
Whatever the causes, Stanford has no more
business being 1-4 with its talent than, say, the
Pittsburgh Steelers.
When the season's over though, people
won't remember how much ability this squad
had, only that they recorded Stanford's first
losing season since 1963. And from this dis
tant view, it appears some changes will have
to be made, because even at Stanford, not
exactly a hotbed for sportsmania, there are
enough people who take their football seri
ously.
For Jack Christiansen, the past couple of
years have been trying ones. Now, with the
Great Quarterback Controversy apparently
settled, he's got even bigger problems.
In the A.W. (After Warner), Era, Stanford
football coaches have had an average tenure of
six years. This is coach Chris' fifth.
will be last. Maybe not. Regardless, it's a
shame that this will not be "The Year" it was
supposed to be.

At this point, Johnny Carson might say,
"End of joke." But this one was for real, and
the punch line was still to come. When it
came, that 28-point turnaround, a couple of
Stanford youths who had risked a month's
rent on the Cards and 16 points were seen
jumping off the upper deck of the Coliseum.
The less dramatic among us were left to sort
out the rubble. Was it Benjamin's fault, this
latest loss? Well, blaming him would be like
drinking too many beers and blaming Adolph
Coors for your hangover. Terry Donahue said,
"I can't imagine a quarterback playing any
better than Benjamin did." Enough said.
Plain and simple, Stanford lost a game it
could and should have won Saturday night. It
was the third such affair this season. Mis
takes? Not enough confidence? Lack of lead
ership? Too much of that old Stanford favo
rite, "perspective"? Or just bad luck?
Whatever the causes, Stanford has no more
business being 1-4 with its talent than, say, the
Pittsburgh Steelers.
When the season's over though, people
won't remember how much ability this squad
had, only that they recorded Stanford's first
losing season since 1963. And from this dis
tant view, it appears some changes will have
to be made, because even at Stanford, not
exactly a hotbed for sportsmania, there are
enough people who take their football seri
ously.
For Jack Christiansen, the past couple of
years have been trying ones. Now, with the
Great Quarterback Controversy apparently
settled, he's got even bigger problems.
In the A.W. (After Warner), Era, Stanford
football coaches have had an average tenure of
six years. This is coach Chris' fifth.
will be last. Maybe not. Regardless, it's a
shame that this will not be "The Year" it was
supposed to be.

It is late Saturday night in the cool, dark
recesses of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum:
Terry Donahue, a pleasant, mild-mannered
Californian, of 32 years.clutches a lukewarm
beer in his not-so-steady left hand. With his
right, Donahue works on the unending stream
of perspiration forming on his forehead and
quietly fends off an overzealous reporter who
is threatening his tonsils with a microphone.
"They were fantastic," Donahue offers gal
lantly. "They were better prepared for this
game than any Stanford team I've seen in five
years. They played us off our feet."
At the other end of the Coliseum, Jack Chris
tiansen, a rather large, rudely man of 48,
slumps disconsolately in his chair, hands
folded neatly in his lap, a wry, impatient ex
pression crossing his face.
An observer gets the feeling that Christian
sen lias been through this before. "What went
wrong?" . . . ."Is this the best team you've
faced?" . . . "How about those turnovers?"
. . .The drone of forced questions and
mechanical answers goes on and on. "Is this
the best game you've played?"
Finally, Christiansen looks up sharply.
"They're always better when you win," he
says. "Tonight, we lost."
After a four-year Rose Bowl drought, Christ
iansen was confident that this would be "The
Year" for Stanford. All of those lcttermen were
back,.Duncan McColl was making his dad Bill
a celebrity again, PA announcer Ed McCauley
was practicing the sure-to-be familiar refrain,
"Benjamin, complete to Hill."
But now, after five games, Stanford's foot
ball Cardinals are 1-4, their worst start in 13
years, and people are wondering if there will
even be a next year for Christiansen.
What has gone wrong this year? Well, you
name it. In Penn State it was a costly penalty
and a slew of penalties. Tack on an injury to
Tony Hill. In Ann Arbor, Michigan.. .well, try
ing to analyze that one wouldbelike dissecting
a hurricane.
Back home with San Jose State, Guy started,
Cordova was booed, and Christiansen winced.
But the refs were on Stanford's side, and the
Cards maintained their undefeated home re
cord!!
But now Benjamin was hurt. Somehow,
Cordova to Mulroy doesn't have the ring. A
20-point lead dried up in West Point faster

than the Cadets could say, "Hut, two, three,"
and Mike Michel flunked a course entitled
"Introduction to the Drama of Last-Second
Field Goal Kicking."
Guy Benjamin and Tony Hill finally got
back together in L.A. and seemed determined
to make people forget a couple of guys named
Plunkett and Vataha. The offensive line set up
like the Wall of China. The defense was heard
snorting, "Veer, Schmeer," and in the fourth
quarter, is was Stanford 20, IJCLA 10.

. . .The drone of forced questions and
mechanical answers goes on and on. "Is this
the best game you've played?"
Finally, Christiansen looks up sharply.
"They're always better when you win," he
says. "Tonight, we lost."
After a four-year Rose Bowl drought, Christ
iansen was confident that this would be "The
Year" for Stanford. All of those lcttermen were
back,.Duncan McColl was making his dad Bill
a celebrity again, PA announcer Ed McCauley
was practicing the sure-to-be familiar refrain,
"Benjamin, complete to Hill."
But now, after five games, Stanford's foot
ball Cardinals are 1-4, their worst start in 13
years, and people are wondering if there will
even be a next year for Christiansen.
What has gone wrong this year? Well, you
name it. In Penn State it was a costly penalty
and a slew of penalties. Tack on an injury to
Tony Hill. In Ann Arbor, Michigan.. .well, try
ing to analyze that one wouldbelike dissecting
a hurricane.
Back home with San Jose State, Guy started,
Cordova was booed, and Christiansen winced.
But the refs were on Stanford's side, and the
Cards maintained their undefeated home re
cord!!
But now Benjamin was hurt. Somehow,
Cordova to Mulroy doesn't have the ring. A
20-point lead dried up in West Point faster

than the Cadets could say, "Hut, two, three,"
and Mike Michel flunked a course entitled
"Introduction to the Drama of Last-Second
Field Goal Kicking."
Guy Benjamin and Tony Hill finally got
back together in L.A. and seemed determined
to make people forget a couple of guys named
Plunkett and Vataha. The offensive line set up
like the Wall of China. The defense was heard
snorting, "Veer, Schmeer," and in the fourth
quarter, is was Stanford 20, IJCLA 10.
At this point, Johnny Carson might say,
"End of joke." But this one was for real, and
the punch line was still to come. When it
came, that 28-point turnaround, a couple of
Stanford youths who had risked a month's
rent on the Cards and 16 points were seen
jumping off the upper deck of the Coliseum.
The less dramatic among us were left to sort
out the rubble. Was it Benjamin's fault, this
latest loss? Well, blaming him would be like
drinking too many beers and blaming Adolph
Coors for your hangover. Terry Donahue said,
"I can't imagine a quarterback playing any
better than Benjamin did." Enough said.
Plain and simple, Stanford lost a game it
could and should have won Saturday night. It
was the third such affair this season. Mis
takes? Not enough confidence? Lack of lead
ership? Too much of that old Stanford favo
rite, "perspective"? Or just bad luck?
Whatever the causes, Stanford has no more
business being 1-4 with its talent than, say, the
Pittsburgh Steelers.
When the season's over though, people
won't remember how much ability this squad
had, only that they recorded Stanford's first
losing season since 1963. And from this dis
tant view, it appears some changes will have
to be made, because even at Stanford, not
exactly a hotbed for sportsmania, there are
enough people who take their football seri
ously.
For Jack Christiansen, the past couple of
years have been trying ones. Now, with the
Great Quarterback Controversy apparently
settled, he's got even bigger problems.
In the A.W. (After Warner), Era, Stanford
football coaches have had an average tenure of
six years. This is coach Chris' fifth.
will be last. Maybe not. Regardless, it's a
shame that this will not be "The Year" it was
supposed to be.

It is late Saturday night in the cool, dark
recesses of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum:
Terry Donahue, a pleasant, mild-mannered
Californian, of 32 years.clutches a lukewarm
beer in his not-so-steady left hand. With his
right, Donahue works on the unending stream
of perspiration forming on his forehead and
quietly fends off an overzealous reporter who
is threatening his tonsils with a microphone.
"They were fantastic," Donahue offers gal
lantly. "They were better prepared for this
game than any Stanford team I've seen in five
years. They played us off our feet."
At the other end of the Coliseum, Jack Chris
tiansen, a rather large, rudely man of 48,
slumps disconsolately in his chair, hands
folded neatly in his lap, a wry, impatient ex
pression crossing his face.
An observer gets the feeling that Christian
sen lias been through this before. "What went
wrong?" . . . ."Is this the best team you've
faced?" . . . "How about those turnovers?"
. . .The drone of forced questions and
mechanical answers goes on and on. "Is this
the best game you've played?"
