Booters lose
The Stanford soccer team re
turned home late Monday night,
a tired ball club, after two
weekend losses to Fullerton
State and UCLA.
The Card record fell to 2-6, as
Coach Nelson Lodge's squad
was edged by Fullerton State,
1-0, and stunned by UCLA. 3-0.
Both squads are ranked among
the West Coast's top teams.
Fullerton's lone goal came in
the 80th minute of a hard-fought
contest. The loss was a bitter de
feat for the Cards, who protested
the Titans' goal.
The Bruins, fresh off an upset
victory over nationally-ranked
St. Louis, just outclassed the
Cards. Stanford, still suffering
from its loss to Fullerton, was
stunned by three goals in the
first 20 minutes.
The Cards, tired after playing
two contests in the excessive
southern California heat, will be
in action tomorrow afternoon
when they take on Menlo Col
lege at 3:30.

of-the-Year last year, had a good
recruiting year, signing two top
players.
