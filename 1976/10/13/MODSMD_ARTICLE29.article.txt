Player of week
USC tailback Ricky Bell missed the national single game
rushing mark by three yards in the Trojans' 23-14 win over
Washington State last Saturday. The Heisman Trophy candi
date gained 347 yards on 51 carries. He has become the
earliest player in Pac-8 history to break the 1000-yard barrier.
Bell now has 1008 yards after five games.
