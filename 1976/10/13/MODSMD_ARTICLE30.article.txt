Mao's widow, other radicals jailed
Tokyo — Mao Tse-tung's widow and some 30
other top radicals in the Chinese leadership have
been arrested or detained in a purge of those who
opposed Premier Hua Kuo-feng's elevation to
Communist party chairman, Japanese news reports
from Peking said yesterday.
The newspaper Asahi said the radicals had been
plotting to name 62-year-old Chiang Ching, Mao's
widow, to the party leadership post held by her
husband until his death on Sept. 9.
Kyoto news service, in a Peking dispatch, said a
government spokesman announced last night that
Hua had been named party leader. Wall posters had
appeared in Peking last week indicating his succes
sion, but there had been no official announcement,
apparently because of the then unresolved power
struggle between radicals and moderates.
China's official Hsinhua news agency continued
to refer to Hua only as premier.
Asahi quoted a reliable source in Peking as say
ing the radical group was accused of forging Mao's
will and directives issued in his name during the
last six months of his life. They tried to use the
forged will to get Chiang Ching elected party
chairman, the source was quoted as saying.
UAW approves Ford Motor offer
Detroit — United Auto Workers (UAW), includ
ing sometime dissident skilled tradesmen, have
approved a proposed settlement in the four-week
old Ford Motor Co. strike, the union announced last
night.
The strike by 1 70,000 hourly workers in 22 states
will continue because of unresolved local disputes
at a number of key manufacturing and assembly
plants.
UAW president Leonard Woodcock, who an
nounced ratification nearly one week to the hour
after the agreement was reached with company
said the pact squeaked by skilled trades
workers by a margin of just under 500 votes. It was
ratified handily by production workers.
He said the vote among production workers was
35,192 to 22,020, while tradesmen ratified 8957 to
8468.
"Workers at bargaining units that have reached
agreement with Ford on local bargaining issues
will be returning to work as soon as they are called
back by the company," Woodcock said.
"Negotiations will continue on the local level at
plants where bargaining units have not yet reached
agreement on local issues," he said.

Ventura case tests death penalty law
Sacramento — Attorneys will battle over the
constitutionality of California's death penalty law
when a Ventura murder case is heard before the
state Supreme Court tomorrow.
State law specifies 11 crimes, including murder
of an on-duty policeman and multiple murder,
which require the death penalty if a jury or judge
finds the crime fits one of the categories.
The court, which is meeting away from its San
Francisco home base for this session, will include
two retiring justices, Chief Justice Donald Wright
and Justice Raymond Sullivan.
But they will take part in any decision on the case
after hearing the argument, even if the decision is
not issued until after they leave the bench early in
1977, Supreme Court officials said yesterday.
Wright wrote the court's 1972 decision striking
down the state's earlier death penalty law. Since
then the voters gave the legislature the power to
write a new death penalty law which is on the
books.
Watergate convictions upheld
Washington — The U.S. Court of Appeals yester
day upheld the Watergate cover-up convictions of
three of former President Richard Nixon's closest
aides but granted a new trial for onetime Nixon
campaign assistant, Robert Mardian.
In a 300-page opinion, the six judges said defen
dants in the four-month-long conspiracy trial had
been properly tried and found guilty of "wide
ranging conspiracy" at the highest levels of gov
ernment.
A separate opinion said Mardian, a former assis
tant attorney general, should have been tried sepa
rately from co-defendants John Mitchell, H. R.
Haldeman and John Ehrlichman.
A fifth defendant, lawyer Kenneth Parkinson,
was acquitted when the jury returned its verdict on
New Year's Day 1975.
Mitchell, a former attorney general, Haldeman,
the former White House chief of staff, Ehrlichman,
Nixon's principal domestic affairs adviser, and
Mardian were all found guilty of plotting to illeg
ally block investigations into the original break-in
at Democratic National Committee headquarters
during another presidential election campaign
June 17, 1972.
Reds in, Yankees near win
Cincinnati — Ken Criffey chopped a little
bouncer toward first base for a bases-loaded single

to drive in Cincinnati's third run in the bottom of
the ninth inning, giving the Reds a sensational 7-6
comeback triumph over the Philadelphia Phillies
yesterday for their second straight National League
championship.
Meanwhile in New York, clutch doubles by
Thurman Munson and Elliott Maddox keyed a
comeback rally and Chris Chambliss drove in three
runs — two of them with a booming homer — as the
New York Yankees bounced from behind for a 5-3
victory over the Kansas City Royals in last night's
third game of the American League championship
series.
The pivotal victory gave the Yankees a 2-1 edge
in the best-of-five baseball series and left them one
triumph away from their first World Series appear
ance in 12 years.
They can wrap up the pennant in the fourth game
today.
Ford and Carter deny rumors
Washington — President Gerald Ford met at
length Monday with a group of Republican politi
cal figures who urged him to retaliate against what
they called distortions of truth and derogatory at
tacks on Ford by Jimmy Carter. Earlier, the presi
dent directly accused his Democratic foe of "pure
demagoguery."
Gov. Dan Evans of Washington said Carter was
conducting a "mean, nasty, little campaign" with
too many distortions and misleading claims to
count. Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.), said he had told
Ford it was his duty to warn the American people if
he saw something in Carter's position or character
that might be "harmful to our country" if Carter was
elected.
Carter, meanwhile, said rumors allegedly spread
by Republicans that he had had an extramarital
affair are "seamy . . . distasteful" and "there is no
truth to the allegations."
Carter said he had learned of the rumors during
the weekend and that several newspapers had been
given the information by "Republicans," but did
not publish it.
Neither Carter nor his aides named any Republi
cans as being responsible. Press secretary Jody
Powell said newsmen had indicated to him that the
rumor came from "highly-placed Republican offi
cials," but gave him no names.

Lows tonight in the upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs

Ford and Carter deny rumors
Washington — President Gerald Ford met at
length Monday with a group of Republican politi
cal figures who urged him to retaliate against what
they called distortions of truth and derogatory at
tacks on Ford by Jimmy Carter. Earlier, the presi
dent directly accused his Democratic foe of "pure
demagoguery."
Gov. Dan Evans of Washington said Carter was
conducting a "mean, nasty, little campaign" with
too many distortions and misleading claims to
count. Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.), said he had told
Ford it was his duty to warn the American people if
he saw something in Carter's position or character
that might be "harmful to our country" if Carter was
elected.
Carter, meanwhile, said rumors allegedly spread
by Republicans that he had had an extramarital
affair are "seamy . . . distasteful" and "there is no
truth to the allegations."
Carter said he had learned of the rumors during
the weekend and that several newspapers had been
given the information by "Republicans," but did
not publish it.
Neither Carter nor his aides named any Republi
cans as being responsible. Press secretary Jody
Powell said newsmen had indicated to him that the
rumor came from "highly-placed Republican offi
cials," but gave him no names.

Mao's widow, other radicals jailed
Tokyo — Mao Tse-tung's widow and some 30
other top radicals in the Chinese leadership have
been arrested or detained in a purge of those who
opposed Premier Hua Kuo-feng's elevation to
Communist party chairman, Japanese news reports
from Peking said yesterday.
The newspaper Asahi said the radicals had been
plotting to name 62-year-old Chiang Ching, Mao's
widow, to the party leadership post held by her
husband until his death on Sept. 9.
Kyoto news service, in a Peking dispatch, said a
government spokesman announced last night that
Hua had been named party leader. Wall posters had
appeared in Peking last week indicating his succes
sion, but there had been no official announcement,
apparently because of the then unresolved power
struggle between radicals and moderates.
China's official Hsinhua news agency continued
to refer to Hua only as premier.
Asahi quoted a reliable source in Peking as say
ing the radical group was accused of forging Mao's
will and directives issued in his name during the
last six months of his life. They tried to use the
forged will to get Chiang Ching elected party
chairman, the source was quoted as saying.
UAW approves Ford Motor offer
Detroit — United Auto Workers (UAW), includ
ing sometime dissident skilled tradesmen, have
approved a proposed settlement in the four-week
old Ford Motor Co. strike, the union announced last
night.
The strike by 1 70,000 hourly workers in 22 states
will continue because of unresolved local disputes
at a number of key manufacturing and assembly
plants.
UAW president Leonard Woodcock, who an
nounced ratification nearly one week to the hour
after the agreement was reached with company
said the pact squeaked by skilled trades
workers by a margin of just under 500 votes. It was
ratified handily by production workers.
He said the vote among production workers was
35,192 to 22,020, while tradesmen ratified 8957 to
8468.
"Workers at bargaining units that have reached
agreement with Ford on local bargaining issues
will be returning to work as soon as they are called
back by the company," Woodcock said.
"Negotiations will continue on the local level at
plants where bargaining units have not yet reached
agreement on local issues," he said.

Ventura case tests death penalty law
Sacramento — Attorneys will battle over the
constitutionality of California's death penalty law
when a Ventura murder case is heard before the
state Supreme Court tomorrow.
State law specifies 11 crimes, including murder
of an on-duty policeman and multiple murder,
which require the death penalty if a jury or judge
finds the crime fits one of the categories.
The court, which is meeting away from its San
Francisco home base for this session, will include
two retiring justices, Chief Justice Donald Wright
and Justice Raymond Sullivan.
But they will take part in any decision on the case
after hearing the argument, even if the decision is
not issued until after they leave the bench early in
1977, Supreme Court officials said yesterday.
Wright wrote the court's 1972 decision striking
down the state's earlier death penalty law. Since
then the voters gave the legislature the power to
write a new death penalty law which is on the
books.
Watergate convictions upheld
Washington — The U.S. Court of Appeals yester
day upheld the Watergate cover-up convictions of
three of former President Richard Nixon's closest
aides but granted a new trial for onetime Nixon
campaign assistant, Robert Mardian.
In a 300-page opinion, the six judges said defen
dants in the four-month-long conspiracy trial had
been properly tried and found guilty of "wide
ranging conspiracy" at the highest levels of gov
ernment.
A separate opinion said Mardian, a former assis
tant attorney general, should have been tried sepa
rately from co-defendants John Mitchell, H. R.
Haldeman and John Ehrlichman.
A fifth defendant, lawyer Kenneth Parkinson,
was acquitted when the jury returned its verdict on
New Year's Day 1975.
Mitchell, a former attorney general, Haldeman,
the former White House chief of staff, Ehrlichman,
Nixon's principal domestic affairs adviser, and
Mardian were all found guilty of plotting to illeg
ally block investigations into the original break-in
at Democratic National Committee headquarters
during another presidential election campaign
June 17, 1972.

Watergate convictions upheld
Washington — The U.S. Court of Appeals yester
day upheld the Watergate cover-up convictions of
three of former President Richard Nixon's closest
aides but granted a new trial for onetime Nixon
campaign assistant, Robert Mardian.
In a 300-page opinion, the six judges said defen
dants in the four-month-long conspiracy trial had
been properly tried and found guilty of "wide
ranging conspiracy" at the highest levels of gov
ernment.
A separate opinion said Mardian, a former assis
tant attorney general, should have been tried sepa
rately from co-defendants John Mitchell, H. R.
Haldeman and John Ehrlichman.
A fifth defendant, lawyer Kenneth Parkinson,
was acquitted when the jury returned its verdict on
New Year's Day 1975.
Mitchell, a former attorney general, Haldeman,
the former White House chief of staff, Ehrlichman,
Nixon's principal domestic affairs adviser, and
Mardian were all found guilty of plotting to illeg
ally block investigations into the original break-in
at Democratic National Committee headquarters
during another presidential election campaign
June 17, 1972.
Reds in, Yankees near win
Cincinnati — Ken Criffey chopped a little
bouncer toward first base for a bases-loaded single

to drive in Cincinnati's third run in the bottom of
the ninth inning, giving the Reds a sensational 7-6
comeback triumph over the Philadelphia Phillies
yesterday for their second straight National League
championship.
Meanwhile in New York, clutch doubles by
Thurman Munson and Elliott Maddox keyed a
comeback rally and Chris Chambliss drove in three
runs — two of them with a booming homer — as the
New York Yankees bounced from behind for a 5-3
victory over the Kansas City Royals in last night's
third game of the American League championship
series.
The pivotal victory gave the Yankees a 2-1 edge
in the best-of-five baseball series and left them one
triumph away from their first World Series appear
ance in 12 years.
They can wrap up the pennant in the fourth game
today.
Ford and Carter deny rumors
Washington — President Gerald Ford met at
length Monday with a group of Republican politi
cal figures who urged him to retaliate against what
they called distortions of truth and derogatory at
tacks on Ford by Jimmy Carter. Earlier, the presi
dent directly accused his Democratic foe of "pure
demagoguery."
Gov. Dan Evans of Washington said Carter was
conducting a "mean, nasty, little campaign" with
too many distortions and misleading claims to
count. Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.), said he had told
Ford it was his duty to warn the American people if
he saw something in Carter's position or character
that might be "harmful to our country" if Carter was
elected.
Carter, meanwhile, said rumors allegedly spread
by Republicans that he had had an extramarital
affair are "seamy . . . distasteful" and "there is no
truth to the allegations."
Carter said he had learned of the rumors during
the weekend and that several newspapers had been
given the information by "Republicans," but did
not publish it.
Neither Carter nor his aides named any Republi
cans as being responsible. Press secretary Jody
Powell said newsmen had indicated to him that the
rumor came from "highly-placed Republican offi
cials," but gave him no names.

Mao's widow, other radicals jailed
Tokyo — Mao Tse-tung's widow and some 30
other top radicals in the Chinese leadership have
been arrested or detained in a purge of those who
opposed Premier Hua Kuo-feng's elevation to
Communist party chairman, Japanese news reports
from Peking said yesterday.
The newspaper Asahi said the radicals had been
plotting to name 62-year-old Chiang Ching, Mao's
widow, to the party leadership post held by her
husband until his death on Sept. 9.
Kyoto news service, in a Peking dispatch, said a
government spokesman announced last night that
Hua had been named party leader. Wall posters had
appeared in Peking last week indicating his succes
sion, but there had been no official announcement,
apparently because of the then unresolved power
struggle between radicals and moderates.
China's official Hsinhua news agency continued
to refer to Hua only as premier.
Asahi quoted a reliable source in Peking as say
ing the radical group was accused of forging Mao's
will and directives issued in his name during the
last six months of his life. They tried to use the
forged will to get Chiang Ching elected party
chairman, the source was quoted as saying.
UAW approves Ford Motor offer
Detroit — United Auto Workers (UAW), includ
ing sometime dissident skilled tradesmen, have
approved a proposed settlement in the four-week
old Ford Motor Co. strike, the union announced last
night.
The strike by 1 70,000 hourly workers in 22 states
will continue because of unresolved local disputes
at a number of key manufacturing and assembly
plants.
UAW president Leonard Woodcock, who an
nounced ratification nearly one week to the hour
after the agreement was reached with company
said the pact squeaked by skilled trades
workers by a margin of just under 500 votes. It was
ratified handily by production workers.
He said the vote among production workers was
35,192 to 22,020, while tradesmen ratified 8957 to
8468.
"Workers at bargaining units that have reached
agreement with Ford on local bargaining issues
will be returning to work as soon as they are called
back by the company," Woodcock said.
"Negotiations will continue on the local level at
plants where bargaining units have not yet reached
agreement on local issues," he said.

Ventura case tests death penalty law
Sacramento — Attorneys will battle over the

UAW approves Ford Motor offer
Detroit — United Auto Workers (UAW), includ
ing sometime dissident skilled tradesmen, have
approved a proposed settlement in the four-week
old Ford Motor Co. strike, the union announced last
night.
The strike by 1 70,000 hourly workers in 22 states
will continue because of unresolved local disputes
at a number of key manufacturing and assembly
plants.
UAW president Leonard Woodcock, who an
nounced ratification nearly one week to the hour
after the agreement was reached with company
said the pact squeaked by skilled trades
workers by a margin of just under 500 votes. It was
ratified handily by production workers.
He said the vote among production workers was
35,192 to 22,020, while tradesmen ratified 8957 to
8468.
"Workers at bargaining units that have reached
agreement with Ford on local bargaining issues
will be returning to work as soon as they are called
back by the company," Woodcock said.
"Negotiations will continue on the local level at
plants where bargaining units have not yet reached
agreement on local issues," he said.

Ventura case tests death penalty law
Sacramento — Attorneys will battle over the
constitutionality of California's death penalty law
when a Ventura murder case is heard before the
state Supreme Court tomorrow.
State law specifies 11 crimes, including murder
of an on-duty policeman and multiple murder,
which require the death penalty if a jury or judge
finds the crime fits one of the categories.
The court, which is meeting away from its San
Francisco home base for this session, will include
two retiring justices, Chief Justice Donald Wright
and Justice Raymond Sullivan.
But they will take part in any decision on the case
after hearing the argument, even if the decision is
not issued until after they leave the bench early in
1977, Supreme Court officials said yesterday.
Wright wrote the court's 1972 decision striking
down the state's earlier death penalty law. Since
then the voters gave the legislature the power to
write a new death penalty law which is on the
books.
Watergate convictions upheld
Washington — The U.S. Court of Appeals yester
day upheld the Watergate cover-up convictions of
three of former President Richard Nixon's closest
aides but granted a new trial for onetime Nixon
campaign assistant, Robert Mardian.
In a 300-page opinion, the six judges said defen
dants in the four-month-long conspiracy trial had
been properly tried and found guilty of "wide
ranging conspiracy" at the highest levels of gov
ernment.
A separate opinion said Mardian, a former assis
tant attorney general, should have been tried sepa
rately from co-defendants John Mitchell, H. R.
Haldeman and John Ehrlichman.
A fifth defendant, lawyer Kenneth Parkinson,
was acquitted when the jury returned its verdict on
New Year's Day 1975.
Mitchell, a former attorney general, Haldeman,
the former White House chief of staff, Ehrlichman,
Nixon's principal domestic affairs adviser, and
Mardian were all found guilty of plotting to illeg
ally block investigations into the original break-in
at Democratic National Committee headquarters
during another presidential election campaign
June 17, 1972.
Reds in, Yankees near win
Cincinnati — Ken Criffey chopped a little
bouncer toward first base for a bases-loaded single

to drive in Cincinnati's third run in the bottom of
the ninth inning, giving the Reds a sensational 7-6
comeback triumph over the Philadelphia Phillies
yesterday for their second straight National League
championship.
Meanwhile in New York, clutch doubles by
Thurman Munson and Elliott Maddox keyed a
comeback rally and Chris Chambliss drove in three
runs — two of them with a booming homer — as the
New York Yankees bounced from behind for a 5-3
victory over the Kansas City Royals in last night's
third game of the American League championship
series.
The pivotal victory gave the Yankees a 2-1 edge
in the best-of-five baseball series and left them one
triumph away from their first World Series appear
ance in 12 years.
They can wrap up the pennant in the fourth game
today.
Ford and Carter deny rumors
Washington — President Gerald Ford met at
length Monday with a group of Republican politi
cal figures who urged him to retaliate against what
they called distortions of truth and derogatory at
tacks on Ford by Jimmy Carter. Earlier, the presi
dent directly accused his Democratic foe of "pure
demagoguery."
Gov. Dan Evans of Washington said Carter was
conducting a "mean, nasty, little campaign" with
too many distortions and misleading claims to
count. Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.), said he had told
Ford it was his duty to warn the American people if
he saw something in Carter's position or character
that might be "harmful to our country" if Carter was
elected.
Carter, meanwhile, said rumors allegedly spread
by Republicans that he had had an extramarital
affair are "seamy . . . distasteful" and "there is no
truth to the allegations."
Carter said he had learned of the rumors during
the weekend and that several newspapers had been
given the information by "Republicans," but did
not publish it.
Neither Carter nor his aides named any Republi
cans as being responsible. Press secretary Jody
Powell said newsmen had indicated to him that the
rumor came from "highly-placed Republican offi
cials," but gave him no names.
