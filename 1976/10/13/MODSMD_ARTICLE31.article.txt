Stanford Police suit cleared

The civil suit filed by Dan Power, a
Palo Alto resident, over incidents
around last year's Big Game named
William Starbuck, Sgt. Stephen Law
son, Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, and Stan
ford University as defendants.
According to Power, the case maybe
appealed but no action is being taken
at this time. Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said, "I feel we were in the
right all along. I don't know why he
struck the officer, but he did."
The district attorney had refused to
prosecute Power on charges of resist
ing arrest and assault on a police of
ficer.

Remark put in context
In yesterday's Daily article on the
Residence Subcommittee of the Com
mittee on Services to Students, a re
mark by subcommittee chairman Tim
Ferguson was taken out of context.
Ferguson was discussing the costs
and benefits of the residential advising
(RA) system, saying that perhaps it
would be found that the system should
remain unchanged or that the number
of RAs could be reduced without re
ducing services, thus effecting a sav
ings. He then added that it may even be
discovered that students would be bet
ter served by abolishing the program
and lowering rents instead.

In yesterday's Daily article on the
Residence Subcommittee of the Com
mittee on Services to Students, a re
mark by subcommittee chairman Tim
Ferguson was taken out of context.

ter served by abolishing the program
and lowering rents instead.
