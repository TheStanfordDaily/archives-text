## 
### Dan Fiduccia 
The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Ap
peals will hear oral arguments today in
San Francisco from attorneys repre
senting The Stanford Daily, the City of
Palo Alto and Santa Clara County con
cerning a 1972 federal district court
ruling which declared a Palo Alto

police search of the Daily's offices il
legal and unconstitutional.
Four Palo Alto police officers
searched the Daily's offices April 12,
1971 looking for evidence which
could be used against demonstrators
who had staged a sit-in at Stanford
Hospital four days before the search.

That sit-in ended in a near riot 30
hours after it began when 65 Palo Alto
police officers and 110 Santa Clara
County deputy sheriffs cleared the
demonstrators from the corridor they
were in and arrested 23 persons. Sev
eral demonstrators and police officers
were injured.
Following the end of the demonstra
tion, the Daily published a special isue
which included photographs of the
police ending the sit-in.
Warrant obtained
The Palo Alto police officers, using a
search warrant procured from then-
Municipal Court Judge J. Barton
Phelps for the pictures, spent nearly an
hour making a thorough search of the
Daily's offices as they looked through
photo files, desks, personal corres
pondence and even garbage cans.
No evidence was found.
The Daily filed suit on May 13,1971,
against Palo Alto Police Chief James
Zurcher, the four Palo Alto police of
ficers, Santa Clara County District
Atty. Louis Bergna, Deputy District
Atty. Craig Brown, and Phelps.
In its suit the Daily asked that the
search, which was unprecedented in
American history, be declared illegal
and unconstitutional and that a per
manent injunction against future
searches be issued.
On Oct. 5, 1972, U.S. District Court
Judge Robert Peckham ruled that the
search violated the Daily's First and
Fourth Amendment rights. Peckman
also awarded $47,500 in fees to the
Daily's attorneys.
Peckham ruled the search violated
the Fourth Amendment's provisions
against illegal searches and seizures.
"It was a third-party search; defen
dants...have submitted no affidavits
showing that any member of the Daily
organization was suspected of unlaw
ful participation in the April 9 fracas at
the Stanford University Hospital...
