# Profs find potential hepatitis cure

Hepatitis B, a disease that infects 300 million
people worldwide each year, may now be curable
through the use of the anti-viral protein interferon,
according to researchers in the Medical School's
Division of Infectious Diseases.
In the Sept. 2 issue of The New England Journal
of Medicine, Frof. Thomas Merigan and Assoc.
Prof. William Robinson, both of the division of In
fectious Diseases, and four post-doctoral fellows
published a report of their hepatitis research.
Interferon is produced by tissues in the body as a
natural defense against infection, according to the
researchers.
Hepatitis B has until now been "absolutely in
curable," according to Robinson. However, in ex
periments conducted late in 1975, two afflicted
subjects who injected themselves subcutaneously
with one or two million units of interferon daily for
approximately six months, experienced significant
improvement in their condition.
As a result of the interferon injections, said
Robinson, "the virus particles disappeared from
their blood completely, their level of viral antigen

was reduced ten thousand-fold, and their livers
(were) completely cleared of any pathology."
Two other subjects were treated "transiently" for
two weeks each because sufficient amounts of in
terferon were unavailable to the researchers.
'Virus particles in their blood disappeared im
mediately. Robinson said.
Interferon is derived from white blood cells and
obtained from the National Blood Bank of Finland.
Funding for research and purchasing interferon
was provided by the National Institute of Health
through the National Institute of Allergy and Infec
tious Diseases, Robinson said.
Merigan said the treatments cost $10 to $100 per
day per patient. Robinson said the research so far
has cost "around a couple of hundred thousand
dollars. A heart transplant is cheaper." he added.
According to Robinson, hepatitis infects 300
million people worldwide, which includes 10 to 15
per cent of the population of Taiwan, and about one
to three people per 1000 population in the United
States

The disease is extremely infectious and can be
transmitted through sexual contact, or from a pre
gnant woman to her child. It is also transmitted by
intravenous drug use and the sharing of contami
nated hypodermic needles.
"The peninsula community is relatively clean of
hepatitis," said Robinson.
Besides Robinson and Merigan, the four post
doctoral fellows working on the project are Harry
Greenberg, Richard Pollard, Larry Lutwick and
Peter Gregory.
Individuals with active hepatitis B or who are
chronic carriers of the disease without symptoms
should call the Infectious Disease division for
further information if they are interested in par
ticipating in the program.
"We're looking for 20 or 25 patients, and to find
the right ones, we may have to talk to 100 or 200
people," said Robinson.
He stressed his preference for sufferers with the
chronic active form of the disease since the treat
ment is designed to have an effect on the symptoms
of the illness, as well as on its viral carriers.

should call the Infectious Disease division for
further information if they are interested in par
ticipating in the program.
"We're looking for 20 or 25 patients, and to find
the right ones, we may have to talk to 100 or 200
people," said Robinson.
He stressed his preference for sufferers with the
chronic active form of the disease since the treat
ment is designed to have an effect on the symptoms
of the illness, as well as on its viral carriers.
Hepatitis B, a disease that infects 300 million
people worldwide each year, may now be curable
through the use of the anti-viral protein interferon,
according to researchers in the Medical School's
Division of Infectious Diseases.
In the Sept. 2 issue of The New England Journal
of Medicine, Frof. Thomas Merigan and Assoc.
Prof. William Robinson, both of the division of In
fectious Diseases, and four post-doctoral fellows
published a report of their hepatitis research.
Interferon is produced by tissues in the body as a
natural defense against infection, according to the
researchers.
Hepatitis B has until now been "absolutely in
curable," according to Robinson. However, in ex
periments conducted late in 1975, two afflicted
subjects who injected themselves subcutaneously
with one or two million units of interferon daily for
approximately six months, experienced significant
improvement in their condition.
As a result of the interferon injections, said
Robinson, "the virus particles disappeared from
their blood completely, their level of viral antigen

was reduced ten thousand-fold, and their livers
(were) completely cleared of any pathology."
Two other subjects were treated "transiently" for
two weeks each because sufficient amounts of in
terferon were unavailable to the researchers.
'Virus particles in their blood disappeared im
mediately. Robinson said.
Interferon is derived from white blood cells and
obtained from the National Blood Bank of Finland.
Funding for research and purchasing interferon
was provided by the National Institute of Health
through the National Institute of Allergy and Infec
tious Diseases, Robinson said.
Merigan said the treatments cost $10 to $100 per
day per patient. Robinson said the research so far
has cost "around a couple of hundred thousand
dollars. A heart transplant is cheaper." he added.
According to Robinson, hepatitis infects 300
million people worldwide, which includes 10 to 15
per cent of the population of Taiwan, and about one
to three people per 1000 population in the United
States

The disease is extremely infectious and can be
transmitted through sexual contact, or from a pre
gnant woman to her child. It is also transmitted by
intravenous drug use and the sharing of contami
nated hypodermic needles.
"The peninsula community is relatively clean of
hepatitis," said Robinson.
Besides Robinson and Merigan, the four post
doctoral fellows working on the project are Harry
Greenberg, Richard Pollard, Larry Lutwick and
Peter Gregory.
Individuals with active hepatitis B or who are
chronic carriers of the disease without symptoms
should call the Infectious Disease division for
further information if they are interested in par
ticipating in the program.
