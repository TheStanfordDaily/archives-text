# Three die after swine flu shots
## 
### Associated Press 
Less than two weeks after it began,
the nationwide swine flu vaccination
program was suspended in eight states
yesterday after three elderly persons
died within hours of taking the flu
shots in Pennsylvania.
Florida officials also reported that a
63-year-old man suffered a fatal heart
attack yesterday about 90 minutes
after receiving a swine flu inoculation.
However, state health officials said
they doubted the attack was caused by
the vaccine.
Florida health officials said the vac
cine injected into Saul Gelman came
from the same batch used in
Pittsburgh, where three elderly per
sons died after getting swine flu inocu
lations.
Paul Hughes, director of the Bro
ward County Health Department, said
he doubted there was any connection
between Gelman's death and the in
oculation.
Robert Bowers, director of the Ok
lahoma City-County Health Depart
ment said he had received two reports
of elderly persons in Oklahoma dying
about one hour after receiving swine
flu shots. He said that physicians
handling the cases said both died of
chronic pulmonary disease and not
from the inoculations.
Officials in New York, Michigan and
Utah ordered the withholding of more
than 200,000 doses of vaccine that
came from the same lot of vaccine used
in Pennsylvania. Florida officials said
they would withhold another 40,000
doses, but would not stop the program
in that state.
Inoculations were halted entirely in
Illinois, Texas, Wisconsin, Louisiana,
Vermont, Maine, New Mexico and
Alaska.
But the swine flu shots continued in
at least 15 other states, with officials in
Massachusetts, Florida, California and
elsewhere saying they had no inten
tion of stopping their programs.
In New York City, the largest munic
ipal swine flu program in the natior
began on schedule yesterday.
And officials of the federal Cente
for Disease Control said there were nc
plans for a nationwide halt in th<
swine flu program because of th<
Pennsylvania deaths.
"We have no evidence to sugges
that these deaths were caused by vac
cine or the vaccination programs,'
said David Sencer, director of tht
center. "Nevertheless, this is a highly
unusual cluster of deaths and requires
a full investigation."
All three of the Pennsylvania deaths
were attributed to heart attacks which
occurred Monday within hours of time
the people received swine flu shots
said Allegheny County Coroner Cyril
Wecht.
The cause of the heart attacks waÂ«
not known, however, and that was the

concern of state, federal and local
health investigators.
The two women and a man who died
were all in their seventies and had his
tories of heart or lung problems, said
Wecht. Their deaths could have been
caused simply by the stress of getting
the inoculations, he added.
Yesterday New York and Michigan
suspended use of vaccine from the lot
used in Pittsburgh, where the people
who died were inoculated Monday.
Health officials in Allegheny
County said the vaccine in question
was produced by Parke Davis & Co. of
Detroit and was part of Parke Davis
vaccine lot A913339A.
