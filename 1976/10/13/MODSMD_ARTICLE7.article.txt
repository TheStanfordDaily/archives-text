# Vitamin C stops death?

### Marc Strassman 
Stanford Nobel Laureate and
Emeritus Chemistry Prof. Linus Paul
ing commenting yesterday on the
deaths of three elderly Pennsylvanians
who died within hours after they re
ceived swine flu inoculations said, "If
they had received extra vitamin C
(prior to taking the inoculations), they
might have survived the shot."
According to the Associated Press,
officials in Pennsylvania said there is
no evidence that the heart attack
deaths of the two women and a man
Monday were caused by the bivalent
A/New Jersey (swine) and A/Victoria
influenza inoculations.
"Old people are often low i n vitamin
C which makes their bodily resistance
(to inoculations) less," said Pauling.
Thomas Merigan, professor of
Medicine and head of the Medical
School's division of Infectious Dis
eases said that "further investigation is
needed" before anything definite can
be said about the deaths.
"It's good that the federal Center for
Disease Control and the Pennsylvania
Public Health Service are both looking
into it," said Merigan.
Pauling said he thought it would be
advisable for those receiving inocula
tions to ingest extra amounts of vita
min C in order to increase their resis
tance to the shot.
Reiterating the position he took ear
lier this year, Pauling said, "I'm op
posed to the swine flu vaccination
program unless there is an epidemic
and it doesn't look like there is going to
be one."
"A vaccination is an insult to the
body," added Pauling, who has re
commended that persons take a gram
of vitamin C daily to prevent colds and
flu.
He said there is no difference bet
ween synthetic vitamin C (ascorbic
acid) and rose hips vitamin C "except
that (rose hips are) more expensive."
