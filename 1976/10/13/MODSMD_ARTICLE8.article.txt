# Office of Admissions uses 'search service'

### Bob Svikhart 
Changes in the Stanford admission
process and the use of a search service
to locate minority candidates, were re
vealed by Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon last night on KZSU's Cam
pus Conference.
"We have begun to use the search
service of the college boards to get the
names of minority candidates who we
can send our mailings to," Hargadon
said.
Hargadon also reported that the ad
missions office has tried to personalize
the admission process and also im
prove the application form.
Discussing the relative importance
of different parts of the application
(grades, test scores, etc.), Hargadon
said, "There is no way to rank the rela
tive importance of each. We try to set

out nine or 10 'hooks' (past activity
categories) for students. Usually, the
applicant will hang his hat on four or
five, and then we have to make a deci
sion.
"Admission is based on evidence
presented by various readers (mem
bers of the admission staff) who are
recommending action on a candi
date," said Hargadon.
According to Hargadon, the applica
tion goes through numerous hands be
fore a decision is reached.
"We have an eight-man staff, and
when we get applications, one of the
staff begins to read them. After the first
reading, a write-up is made and an ini
tial recommendation is formulated.
After the second reading, an academic
rating is given the applicant.
"At this point, approximately 1000
applicants are placed in the 'for sure'
category. Another 4000 are rejected,
while the remaining 5000 are put in
the 'swim' category, so named because
the applications 'swim' around the of
fice," he said.
"The 5000 'swims' are read by three
to six people, before 1500 are singled
out and read by another three readers.
After this process, decisions are
made." Hargadon said.
Hargadon, who is in his eighth year
as Dean of Admissions here, also spoke
about the composition of the student
body.
"We aren't looking for conservative
or liberal students. In fact, students
look pretty much the same when ap
plications come in.
"The media suggest that students
are more conservative nowadays, but I
find them to be more politically active
at an earlier age than in the past," Har
gadon observed.
"It is hard to suggest that Stanford
students are more conservative than
others, in fact, I don't think that they
have changed more than the national
norm.'' he said.
