# Tenure action
## 
### 
Petroff, et.al.

As this academic year begins, uni
versity faculty promotions policies
promise once again to be a subject of
intense concern and controversy. Sev
eral tenure decisions of recent years
have generated a feeling of skepticism
among students about how the review
process operates, and many have be
come concerned over its impact on the
quality of education here.
In addition to those students who
have expressed concern over recent
tenure decisions in the face of escalat
ing tuition costs, it has been noted that
many junior faculty members seeking
tenure perceive that their time is better
spent in the laboratory than in the
classroom.
If nothing else, however, the well
intentioned efforts of students in past
years have yielded a realization that
the various questions regarding tenure
extend far beyond the relative impor
tance of teaching vs. research in such
decisions.
Last spring, we advocated two steps
to insure greater student involvement
in the tenure process: (1) determine
which professors are coming up for re
view in advance of any departmental
level decisions and convey that infor
mation to undergraduate departmen
tal associations; and (2) establish a
task-force comprised of students, fa
culty, and administrators to study and
evaluate current university policies on
tenure and teaching quality in a com
prehensive manner. Although sig
nificant progress has been made to
ward these ends, we have encountered
some obstacles in our efforts to imple
ment these programs.
Department response
On July 14, we sent a letter request
ing. that the 27 department chairper
sons in the School of Humanities and
Sciences (H&S) inform us of those
junior faculty members coming up for
review in their respective departments
during the academic year 1976-77. We
have since received responses from 17
of those department heads, providing
us with the names of 15 junior faculty
members who are candidates for te
nure in H&S departments this year.
Our subsequent attempts to procure
further information from the depart
ments were diverted by an administra
tion memo issued July 22 directing
department chairpersons not to com
ply with our request as formulated.
That memo suggested that names only
be released with the prior consent of
those tenure candidates.
m While recognizing the administra
tion's expressed concern over confi
<3s{iiiality in the review process, we
maintain that effective input by stu
dents hi nges upon their ability to iden
tify those faculty members who are
coming up for review early in the pro
cess. We feel that it would best serve
the interests of the Stanford commun
ity were this information a matter of
open public record.
We make no challenge to the confi
dentiality of the review process per se
— we are not recommending that the
files of each candidate be opened for
student inspection — we only suggest
that if students are made aware of who
is coming up for review they might
then be in a favorable position to
comment intelligently on the teaching
performance of those individuals to

the lasting benefit of the evaluation
process itself.
Effective student participation
Currently, we are communicating to
the leaders of undergraduate associa
tions throughout the university the
names of those junior faculty members
coming up for review in their respec
tive departments, and efforts are under
way to establish channels through
which students mav more effectively
participate within these organizations
in the review process. In departments
where undergraduate associations do
not presently exist, measures are being
taken to facilitate their development.
In addition to these efforts, a Council
of Presidents Task Force was estab
lished in June 1976 which has been
conducting a thorough examination of
current tenure and promotion proce
dures in order to evaluate them for
their impact on the quality of educa
tion here.
This task force is composed of five
faculty members (Allan Cox, John Co
heen, Donald Kennedy, Hubert Mar
shall and William Rivers), four stu
dents (chairperson Larry Diamond,
Kathryn Ma, John Richard and Wil
liam Tyndall) and Lee Ziegler, direc
tor of Bechtel International Center.
The final report of this Task Force on
Tenure and Teaching Quality is ex
pected to be ready early in winter quar
ter.
Student concerns
Finally, Students Interested in Te
nure (SIT), an informal group which
was organized last May in an attempt
to provide some continuity to student
concerns about tenure, is presently re
forming to meet during the coming
year. Any student interested in par
ticipating in SIT should contact one of
us at the ASSU office.
It is our belief that a well-informed
student body can significantly affect
Stanford's tenure policies. The prog
rams enumerated above are designed
to provide students with a broad and
accurate base of information concern
ing tenure review procedures here.
Such a base is prerequisite to posi
tive student-initiated change in a sys
tem which so often appears to deny us
many of the educational advantages
for which Stanford is so widely repu
ted.

during the academic year 1976-77. We
have since received responses from 17
of those department heads, providing
us with the names of 15 junior faculty
members who are candidates for te
nure in H&S departments this year.
Our subsequent attempts to procure
further information from the depart
ments were diverted by an administra
tion memo issued July 22 directing
department chairpersons not to com
ply with our request as formulated.
That memo suggested that names only
be released with the prior consent of
those tenure candidates.
m While recognizing the administra
tion's expressed concern over confi
<3s{iiiality in the review process, we
maintain that effective input by stu
dents hi nges upon their ability to iden
tify those faculty members who are
coming up for review early in the pro
cess. We feel that it would best serve
the interests of the Stanford commun
ity were this information a matter of
open public record.
We make no challenge to the confi
dentiality of the review process per se
— we are not recommending that the
files of each candidate be opened for
student inspection — we only suggest
that if students are made aware of who
is coming up for review they might
then be in a favorable position to
comment intelligently on the teaching
performance of those individuals to

the lasting benefit of the evaluation
process itself.
Effective student participation
Currently, we are communicating to
the leaders of undergraduate associa
tions throughout the university the
names of those junior faculty members
coming up for review in their respec
tive departments, and efforts are under
way to establish channels through
which students mav more effectively
participate within these organizations
in the review process. In departments
where undergraduate associations do
not presently exist, measures are being
taken to facilitate their development.
In addition to these efforts, a Council
of Presidents Task Force was estab
lished in June 1976 which has been
conducting a thorough examination of
current tenure and promotion proce
dures in order to evaluate them for
their impact on the quality of educa
tion here.
This task force is composed of five
faculty members (Allan Cox, John Co
heen, Donald Kennedy, Hubert Mar
shall and William Rivers), four stu
dents (chairperson Larry Diamond,
Kathryn Ma, John Richard and Wil
liam Tyndall) and Lee Ziegler, direc
tor of Bechtel International Center.
The final report of this Task Force on
Tenure and Teaching Quality is ex
pected to be ready early in winter quar
ter.
Student concerns
Finally, Students Interested in Te
nure (SIT), an informal group which
was organized last May in an attempt
to provide some continuity to student
concerns about tenure, is presently re
forming to meet during the coming
year. Any student interested in par
ticipating in SIT should contact one of
us at the ASSU office.
It is our belief that a well-informed
student body can significantly affect
Stanford's tenure policies. The prog
rams enumerated above are designed
to provide students with a broad and
accurate base of information concern
ing tenure review procedures here.
Such a base is prerequisite to posi
tive student-initiated change in a sys
tem which so often appears to deny us
many of the educational advantages
for which Stanford is so widely repu
ted.

As this academic year begins, uni
versity faculty promotions policies
promise once again to be a subject of
intense concern and controversy. Sev
eral tenure decisions of recent years
have generated a feeling of skepticism
among students about how the review
process operates, and many have be
come concerned over its impact on the
quality of education here.
In addition to those students who
have expressed concern over recent
tenure decisions in the face of escalat
ing tuition costs, it has been noted that
many junior faculty members seeking
tenure perceive that their time is better
spent in the laboratory than in the
classroom.
If nothing else, however, the well
intentioned efforts of students in past
years have yielded a realization that
the various questions regarding tenure
extend far beyond the relative impor
tance of teaching vs. research in such
decisions.
Last spring, we advocated two steps
to insure greater student involvement
in the tenure process: (1) determine
which professors are coming up for re
view in advance of any departmental
level decisions and convey that infor
mation to undergraduate departmen
tal associations; and (2) establish a
task-force comprised of students, fa
culty, and administrators to study and
evaluate current university policies on
tenure and teaching quality in a com
prehensive manner. Although sig
nificant progress has been made to
ward these ends, we have encountered
some obstacles in our efforts to imple
ment these programs.

where undergraduate associations do
not presently exist, measures are being
taken to facilitate their development.
In addition to these efforts, a Council
of Presidents Task Force was estab
lished in June 1976 which has been
conducting a thorough examination of
current tenure and promotion proce
dures in order to evaluate them for
their impact on the quality of educa
tion here.
This task force is composed of five
faculty members (Allan Cox, John Co
heen, Donald Kennedy, Hubert Mar
shall and William Rivers), four stu
dents (chairperson Larry Diamond,
Kathryn Ma, John Richard and Wil
liam Tyndall) and Lee Ziegler, direc
tor of Bechtel International Center.
The final report of this Task Force on
Tenure and Teaching Quality is ex
pected to be ready early in winter quar
ter.
Student concerns
Finally, Students Interested in Te
nure (SIT), an informal group which
was organized last May in an attempt
to provide some continuity to student
concerns about tenure, is presently re
forming to meet during the coming
year. Any student interested in par
ticipating in SIT should contact one of
us at the ASSU office.
It is our belief that a well-informed
student body can significantly affect
Stanford's tenure policies. The prog
rams enumerated above are designed
to provide students with a broad and
accurate base of information concern
ing tenure review procedures here.
Such a base is prerequisite to posi
tive student-initiated change in a sys
tem which so often appears to deny us
many of the educational advantages
for which Stanford is so widely repu
ted.

As this academic year begins, uni
versity faculty promotions policies
promise once again to be a subject of
intense concern and controversy. Sev
eral tenure decisions of recent years
have generated a feeling of skepticism
among students about how the review
process operates, and many have be
come concerned over its impact on the
quality of education here.
In addition to those students who
have expressed concern over recent
tenure decisions in the face of escalat
ing tuition costs, it has been noted that
many junior faculty members seeking
tenure perceive that their time is better
spent in the laboratory than in the
classroom.
If nothing else, however, the well
intentioned efforts of students in past
years have yielded a realization that
the various questions regarding tenure
extend far beyond the relative impor
tance of teaching vs. research in such
decisions.
Last spring, we advocated two steps
to insure greater student involvement
in the tenure process: (1) determine
which professors are coming up for re
view in advance of any departmental
level decisions and convey that infor
mation to undergraduate departmen
tal associations; and (2) establish a
task-force comprised of students, fa
culty, and administrators to study and
evaluate current university policies on
tenure and teaching quality in a com
prehensive manner. Although sig
nificant progress has been made to
ward these ends, we have encountered
some obstacles in our efforts to imple
ment these programs.
Department response
On July 14, we sent a letter request
ing. that the 27 department chairper
sons in the School of Humanities and
Sciences (H&S) inform us of those
junior faculty members coming up for
review in their respective departments
during the academic year 1976-77. We
have since received responses from 17
of those department heads, providing
us with the names of 15 junior faculty
members who are candidates for te
nure in H&S departments this year.
Our subsequent attempts to procure
further information from the depart
ments were diverted by an administra
tion memo issued July 22 directing
department chairpersons not to com
ply with our request as formulated.
That memo suggested that names only
be released with the prior consent of
those tenure candidates.
m While recognizing the administra
tion's expressed concern over confi
<3s{iiiality in the review process, we
maintain that effective input by stu
dents hi nges upon their ability to iden
tify those faculty members who are
coming up for review early in the pro
cess. We feel that it would best serve
the interests of the Stanford commun
ity were this information a matter of
open public record.
We make no challenge to the confi
dentiality of the review process per se
— we are not recommending that the
files of each candidate be opened for
student inspection — we only suggest
that if students are made aware of who
is coming up for review they might
then be in a favorable position to
comment intelligently on the teaching
performance of those individuals to

the lasting benefit of the evaluation
process itself.
Effective student participation
Currently, we are communicating to
the leaders of undergraduate associa
tions throughout the university the
names of those junior faculty members
coming up for review in their respec
tive departments, and efforts are under
way to establish channels through
which students mav more effectively
participate within these organizations
in the review process. In departments
where undergraduate associations do
not presently exist, measures are being
taken to facilitate their development.
