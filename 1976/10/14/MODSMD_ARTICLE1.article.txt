San Francisco — An appeal from a
federal district court ruling that de
clared illegal a 1971 Palo Alto Police
Department search of the Stanford
Daily's offices was argued here yester
day before the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals.
Attorneys representing the Daily,
the City of Palo Alto and the State of
California argued for more than 70 mi
nutes before a three-judge appeals
court panel on the First and Fourth
Amendment issues involved in the
search.
The arguments were marked by fre
quent interruptions and questions by

two of the justices during the state
ments made by attorneys for Palo Alto
and the state.
Marilyn NorekTaketa,-assistant Palo
Alto City attorney, had just begun her
statement and said the case involved
"a search warrant issuance" when Jus
tice Shirley Hufstedler interjected "is
suance and execution."
From then on. Taketa was peppered
with questions from Hufstedler and
Justice Alfred Goodwin.
As Taketa began to recite the case's
facts, Hufstedler said, "we're well
aware of them" and urged Taketa to get
to her arguments.
At one point Taketa said the Palo

Alto police "were only peripherally
involved" in the search.
Hufstedler retorted. "I don't under
stand how the police were only
peripherally involved. The officers
asked for the warrant and they exe
cuted it."
A few minutes later, Goodwin began
to question Taketa on why a subpoena,
instead of a warrant, was not issued.
Goodwin said banks give informa
tion daily to police because of a sub
poena but banks don't like doing this.
Banks do it because "they don't want
police to burgle their offices," added
Goodwin.
Hufstedler queried. "We shouldn't
trust the American people not to de
stroy evidence when they are not sus
pects?"
Taketa responded, saying "it's dif
ficult to distinguish between suspects
and non-suspects. A non-suspect
might become a suspect."
Deputy California Attorney General
Sanford Svetcov. appearing as a friend
of the court, argued next. As he talked
he, too, was immediately and fre
quently subjected to the justice's ques
tions.
Goodwin interjected "I find it as
tonishing to search a house by warrant
instead of knocking on the door and
asking for the material."
Svetcov responded "we trust
homeowners and businesses if we
know we can trust them, but we may
not know and that's the problem. The
police don't know."
Hufstedler attempted to summarize
Svetcov's arguments at one point, "We
can't assume less drastic means would
work, and if we could, we shouldn't,
because the detection of crime takes
precedence over a homeowner's in
terests?"
Jerome Falk Jr., representing the
Daily, explained the throughness of
the search and its damage to the Dai
ly's newsgathering ability.
"In order to find out what they were
looking for was not there, the police
went through the entire premises, in
cluding desks, files and even was
tebaskets," said Falk.
Even though the police didn't in
tend to see confidential information,
"they did see everything, including

sensitive material," argued Falk.
"In this case, the loss of privacy was
final," Falk said.
Taketa in her argument said the
police were not proper defendants be
cause it would be "very onerous" on
police and the deputy district attorney
to make the determination if probable
cause existed to get a warrant, since
the magistrate is responsible for issu
ing warrants.
Falk later responded to this, point
ing out that the defendants "said they
did it, asserted the propriety of doing
it, and asserted the right to do it again.
We thought they were proper defen
dants."
Taketa claimed the warrant was
necessary because of the Daily's pub

lished policy of destroying photo
graphs which might incriminate
persons.
Taketa said photographs, not confi
dential information, were the object of
the search. She also said future sus
pects, in some cases, could well be
linked to the premises which were
searched.
Hufstedler said that "through 200
years we've managed without this
kind of technique" and asked why was
there a need "at this late date for this
kind of procedure?"
During rebuttal, Taketa referred to a
search of psychiatric records at Stan
ford Hospital after the Daily search.
She claimed the search was not con
ducted by Palo Alto police and the
hospital was not within Palo Alto city
limits.
The hospital was annexed by the
city when it was built in the late '50s.
Edward Kohn, former Daily manag
ing editor and one of the seven plain
tiffs in the case, said after the hearing
"the seven of us are still very much
interested in the case and intend to see

it through to the conclusion of the jud
icial process."
Kohn explained the Daily's photo
policy which Taketa cited.
"The Daily wanted to have editorial
freedom to print any pictures it
thought newsworthy, but it didn't
want to maintain files that would be
come a happy hunting ground for the
university, the police, the district at
torney or the Santa Clara County grand
jury."

Taketa said photographs, not confi

the search. She also said future sus

linked to the premises which were
searched.
Hufstedler said that "through 200
years we've managed without this
kind of technique" and asked why was
there a need "at this late date for this
kind of procedure?"
During rebuttal, Taketa referred to a
search of psychiatric records at Stan
ford Hospital after the Daily search.
She claimed the search was not con
ducted by Palo Alto police and the
hospital was not within Palo Alto city
limits.
The hospital was annexed by the
city when it was built in the late '50s.
Edward Kohn, former Daily manag
ing editor and one of the seven plain
tiffs in the case, said after the hearing
"the seven of us are still very much
interested in the case and intend to see

it through to the conclusion of the jud

Kohn explained the Daily's photo
policy which Taketa cited.
"The Daily wanted to have editorial
freedom to print any pictures it
thought newsworthy, but it didn't
want to maintain files that would be
come a happy hunting ground for the
university, the police, the district at

San Francisco — An appeal from a
federal district court ruling that de
clared illegal a 1971 Palo Alto Police
Department search of the Stanford
Daily's offices was argued here yester
day before the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals.
Attorneys representing the Daily,
the City of Palo Alto and the State of
California argued for more than 70 mi
nutes before a three-judge appeals
court panel on the First and Fourth
Amendment issues involved in the
search.
The arguments were marked by fre
quent interruptions and questions by

two of the justices during the state
ments made by attorneys for Palo Alto
and the state.
Marilyn NorekTaketa,-assistant Palo
Alto City attorney, had just begun her
statement and said the case involved
"a search warrant issuance" when Jus
tice Shirley Hufstedler interjected "is
suance and execution."
From then on. Taketa was peppered
with questions from Hufstedler and
Justice Alfred Goodwin.
As Taketa began to recite the case's
facts, Hufstedler said, "we're well
aware of them" and urged Taketa to get
to her arguments.
At one point Taketa said the Palo

Alto police "were only peripherally
involved" in the search.
Hufstedler retorted. "I don't under
stand how the police were only
peripherally involved. The officers
asked for the warrant and they exe
cuted it."
A few minutes later, Goodwin began
to question Taketa on why a subpoena,
instead of a warrant, was not issued.
Goodwin said banks give informa
tion daily to police because of a sub
poena but banks don't like doing this.
Banks do it because "they don't want
police to burgle their offices," added
Goodwin.
Hufstedler queried. "We shouldn't
trust the American people not to de
stroy evidence when they are not sus
pects?"
Taketa responded, saying "it's dif
ficult to distinguish between suspects
and non-suspects. A non-suspect
might become a suspect."
Deputy California Attorney General
Sanford Svetcov. appearing as a friend
of the court, argued next. As he talked
he, too, was immediately and fre
quently subjected to the justice's ques
tions.
Goodwin interjected "I find it as
tonishing to search a house by warrant
instead of knocking on the door and
asking for the material."
Svetcov responded "we trust
homeowners and businesses if we
know we can trust them, but we may
not know and that's the problem. The
police don't know."
Hufstedler attempted to summarize
Svetcov's arguments at one point, "We
can't assume less drastic means would
work, and if we could, we shouldn't,
because the detection of crime takes
precedence over a homeowner's in
terests?"
Jerome Falk Jr., representing the
Daily, explained the throughness of
the search and its damage to the Dai
ly's newsgathering ability.
"In order to find out what they were
looking for was not there, the police
went through the entire premises, in
cluding desks, files and even was
tebaskets," said Falk.
Even though the police didn't in
tend to see confidential information,
"they did see everything, including

sensitive material," argued Falk.
"In this case, the loss of privacy was
final," Falk said.
Taketa in her argument said the
police were not proper defendants be
cause it would be "very onerous" on
police and the deputy district attorney
to make the determination if probable
cause existed to get a warrant, since
the magistrate is responsible for issu

poena but banks don't like doing this.
Banks do it because "they don't want
police to burgle their offices," added
Goodwin.
Hufstedler queried. "We shouldn't
trust the American people not to de
stroy evidence when they are not sus
pects?"
Taketa responded, saying "it's dif
ficult to distinguish between suspects
and non-suspects. A non-suspect
might become a suspect."
Deputy California Attorney General
Sanford Svetcov. appearing as a friend
of the court, argued next. As he talked
he, too, was immediately and fre
quently subjected to the justice's ques
tions.
Goodwin interjected "I find it as
tonishing to search a house by warrant
instead of knocking on the door and
asking for the material."
Svetcov responded "we trust
homeowners and businesses if we
know we can trust them, but we may
not know and that's the problem. The
police don't know."
Hufstedler attempted to summarize
Svetcov's arguments at one point, "We
can't assume less drastic means would
work, and if we could, we shouldn't,
because the detection of crime takes
precedence over a homeowner's in
terests?"
Jerome Falk Jr., representing the
Daily, explained the throughness of
the search and its damage to the Dai
ly's newsgathering ability.
"In order to find out what they were
looking for was not there, the police
went through the entire premises, in
cluding desks, files and even was
tebaskets," said Falk.
Even though the police didn't in
tend to see confidential information,
"they did see everything, including

sensitive material," argued Falk.
"In this case, the loss of privacy was
final," Falk said.
Taketa in her argument said the
police were not proper defendants be
cause it would be "very onerous" on
police and the deputy district attorney
to make the determination if probable
cause existed to get a warrant, since
the magistrate is responsible for issu
ing warrants.
Falk later responded to this, point
ing out that the defendants "said they
did it, asserted the propriety of doing
it, and asserted the right to do it again.
We thought they were proper defen
dants."
Taketa claimed the warrant was
necessary because of the Daily's pub

graphs which might incriminate
persons.
Taketa said photographs, not confi
dential information, were the object of
the search. She also said future sus
pects, in some cases, could well be
linked to the premises which were
searched.
Hufstedler said that "through 200
years we've managed without this
kind of technique" and asked why was
there a need "at this late date for this
kind of procedure?"
During rebuttal, Taketa referred to a
search of psychiatric records at Stan
ford Hospital after the Daily search.
She claimed the search was not con
ducted by Palo Alto police and the
hospital was not within Palo Alto city
limits.
The hospital was annexed by the
city when it was built in the late '50s.
Edward Kohn, former Daily manag
ing editor and one of the seven plain
tiffs in the case, said after the hearing
"the seven of us are still very much
interested in the case and intend to see

it through to the conclusion of the jud
icial process."
Kohn explained the Daily's photo
policy which Taketa cited.
"The Daily wanted to have editorial
freedom to print any pictures it
thought newsworthy, but it didn't
want to maintain files that would be
come a happy hunting ground for the
university, the police, the district at
torney or the Santa Clara County grand
jury."
San Francisco — An appeal from a
federal district court ruling that de
clared illegal a 1971 Palo Alto Police
Department search of the Stanford
Daily's offices was argued here yester
day before the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals.
Attorneys representing the Daily,
the City of Palo Alto and the State of
California argued for more than 70 mi
nutes before a three-judge appeals
court panel on the First and Fourth
Amendment issues involved in the
search.
The arguments were marked by fre
quent interruptions and questions by

two of the justices during the state
ments made by attorneys for Palo Alto
and the state.
Marilyn NorekTaketa,-assistant Palo
Alto City attorney, had just begun her
statement and said the case involved
"a search warrant issuance" when Jus
tice Shirley Hufstedler interjected "is
suance and execution."
From then on. Taketa was peppered
with questions from Hufstedler and
Justice Alfred Goodwin.
As Taketa began to recite the case's
facts, Hufstedler said, "we're well
aware of them" and urged Taketa to get
to her arguments.
At one point Taketa said the Palo

Alto police "were only peripherally
involved" in the search.
Hufstedler retorted. "I don't under
stand how the police were only
peripherally involved. The officers
asked for the warrant and they exe
cuted it."
A few minutes later, Goodwin began
to question Taketa on why a subpoena,
instead of a warrant, was not issued.
Goodwin said banks give informa
tion daily to police because of a sub
poena but banks don't like doing this.
Banks do it because "they don't want
police to burgle their offices," added
