Recently I had the opportunity to remove a leaf
let from the building to which it was attached. The
leaflet included the words "innovative" and
"Jimmy Carter" in large letters. I removed it be
cause it was an anonymous leaflet and, therefore,
seemed to violate university regulations that re
quire posted leaflets to include the name, ad
dress, und phone number of the individual or
organization that prepared the leaflet.
What are the current University regulations for
posting leaflets? What individual or group has
been given the responsibility for enacting these
regulations?
R.W.
Well, you're right about one thing — all leaflets
are supposed to include the "name of the sponsor
ing organization," but they don't have to include
an address or phone number.
I talked to Lynn Bonde, who's the assistant head
honcho at the Office of Public Events. All leaflets
are supposed to go through that office, which is a
standing committee of the Academic Council, as
Bonde explained, "The campus is big, and (they)
can't keep track of everything." Oh, well.
Bonde says violators of leaflet regulations face
"losing (their) privileges of using university
facilities." However, says Bonde, this rarely hap
pens.
Off-limit posting spots include trees, doors,
windows, trash cans, sides of buildings — in
short, "anything not obviously a posting place."
I know a SWOPS/ course is being offered this
quarter which hopes to create a recycling plan for
the Stanford community. Presently, where is the
nearest place for Stanford students to recycle
newspapers? Are there any centers on the cam
pus?
C.B.

For those of you who don't know about the
SWOPSI course, it's called "A Recycling Plan for
the Stanford Community" and is taught by How
ard Selznick and Jeff Norment.
Selznick says currently there is no recycling
plan on campus. But by winter quarter, Selznick
and his class hope to organize something in the
line of newspaper, metals, and glass pick-up
spots, and maybe even a compost pile with the
combustible portions to be used as fuel. "Right
now," says Selznick, "the class is in its organiza
tional throes."
The closest recycling spots I could find out
about are the Palo Alto Recycling Center — lo
cated at the dump at the end of Embarcadero —
and a large bin for newspapers on Charleston,
near Middlefield Road. The latter is operated by
the Community Association for the Retarded, a
volunteer association that sells the newspapers to
a recycling company.
Do any of the service stations near campus
clean und test spark plugs? It seems a waste to
throw out good plugs at every tune-up since they
should be good for 10,000 miles of so, but it is
difficult to clean them well without the use of a
spark plug cleaner.
After checking with virtually every gas sta
tion near campus that 1 know of; basically the
answer I got was NO. Most places will test spark
plugs, but cleaning them seems to have become an
out-dated process.
An attendant at the Palo Also Shell Station says
that most cars get tuned up between 10-12,000
miles. By that time, the spark plugs are usually
shot anyways. "And the cost of labor for cleaning
them," he said, "amounts to what it would cost to
replace them." He said spark plugs cost between
$1.60 to $1.75 each.

For those of you who don't know about the
SWOPSI course, it's called "A Recycling Plan for
the Stanford Community" and is taught by How
ard Selznick and Jeff Norment.
Selznick says currently there is no recycling
plan on campus. But by winter quarter, Selznick
and his class hope to organize something in the
line of newspaper, metals, and glass pick-up
spots, and maybe even a compost pile with the
combustible portions to be used as fuel. "Right
now," says Selznick, "the class is in its organiza
tional throes."
The closest recycling spots I could find out
about are the Palo Alto Recycling Center — lo
cated at the dump at the end of Embarcadero —
and a large bin for newspapers on Charleston,
near Middlefield Road. The latter is operated by
the Community Association for the Retarded, a
volunteer association that sells the newspapers to
a recycling company.
Do any of the service stations near campus
clean und test spark plugs? It seems a waste to
throw out good plugs at every tune-up since they
should be good for 10,000 miles of so, but it is
difficult to clean them well without the use of a
spark plug cleaner.
After checking with virtually every gas sta
tion near campus that 1 know of; basically the
answer I got was NO. Most places will test spark
plugs, but cleaning them seems to have become an
out-dated process.
An attendant at the Palo Also Shell Station says
that most cars get tuned up between 10-12,000
miles. By that time, the spark plugs are usually
shot anyways. "And the cost of labor for cleaning
them," he said, "amounts to what it would cost to
replace them." He said spark plugs cost between
$1.60 to $1.75 each.

Recently I had the opportunity to remove a leaf
let from the building to which it was attached. The
leaflet included the words "innovative" and
"Jimmy Carter" in large letters. I removed it be
cause it was an anonymous leaflet and, therefore,
seemed to violate university regulations that re
quire posted leaflets to include the name, ad
dress, und phone number of the individual or
organization that prepared the leaflet.
What are the current University regulations for
posting leaflets? What individual or group has
been given the responsibility for enacting these
regulations?
R.W.
Well, you're right about one thing — all leaflets
are supposed to include the "name of the sponsor
ing organization," but they don't have to include
an address or phone number.
I talked to Lynn Bonde, who's the assistant head
honcho at the Office of Public Events. All leaflets
are supposed to go through that office, which is a
standing committee of the Academic Council, as
Bonde explained, "The campus is big, and (they)
can't keep track of everything." Oh, well.
Bonde says violators of leaflet regulations face
"losing (their) privileges of using university
facilities." However, says Bonde, this rarely hap
pens.
Off-limit posting spots include trees, doors,
windows, trash cans, sides of buildings — in
short, "anything not obviously a posting place."
I know a SWOPS/ course is being offered this
quarter which hopes to create a recycling plan for
the Stanford community. Presently, where is the
nearest place for Stanford students to recycle
newspapers? Are there any centers on the cam
pus?
