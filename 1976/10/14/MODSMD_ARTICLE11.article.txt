# Undergrad economics program offers liaison to profs, students
## 
### 
Last spring's economics de
partment controversy surround
ing the denial of tenure for Dun
can Foley has caused students to
look more critically at the qual
ity of teaching in that depart
ment, according to the officers of
the Undergraduate Economics
Association (UEA).
"from what happened in the
econ department last May, it's
obvious that we're not lacking
student interest. So our role is
hardly one of instigation," said
senior Greg Sidak, LJEA presi
dent.
"We're just trying to shorten
the distance between the
economics faculty and under
grads," he said.
junior Bob Gregory, UEA vice
president, reiterated Sidak's
message: "We're basically
apolitical. We see our purpose as

coordinating student interests
rather than preaching any par
ticular ideology, whether con
servative, moderate or radical."
"The militancy of the spring
was productive inasmuch as it
demonstrated broad student
concern over tenure and teach
ing," said Sidak.
"I'm optimistic that that con
cern can turn to some purposeful
dialogue this year," he said.
A major objective of the group
is to establish an undergraduate
committee to confer with the
economics faculty on matters of
tenure, teaching and department
requirements.
Sidak also anticipated a
speakers' series this fall includ
ing a discussion of employment
and graduate admissions pros
pects for economics majors.
But Gregory was quick to add

that the organization is social as
well as academic, bucking what
he termed its prior "econ-freak"
image.
"There's something missing
in your education if you feel
you're imposing when you go to
a professor's office to ask a ques
tion, or if you feel you don't
know any prof well enough to
ask for a recommendation," he
said.
Gonsequently, the UEA will be
sponsoring informal gatherings
for economics students and fa
culty this year as it has in the
past.
