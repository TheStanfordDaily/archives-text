Harold Wilson, former prime
minister of England, and sports
announcer Howard Cosell will
be speaking on campus under
the auspices of the ASSU Speak
ers' Bureau, according to bureau
director Ted Mitchell.
Named director in May of this
year, Mitchell plans to gear the
efforts of the bureau toward
guest-in-residence programs
where speakers will stay at the
university for several days, mov
ing around to various resi
dences, interacting with stu
dents.
"We hope to broaden the ex
perience, rather than draw
speakers who are only recog
nized by a core of 100 students.
We want to go after more widely
known people to educate the
students — someone who's at
tractive," Mitchell said.
This year's bureau has had to
cut back on the number of prog
rams sponsored alone. Mitchell
noted that because of the rising
number of people on the
speaker's circuit, speakers
employ agents, thus dramati
cally increasing the costs of ob
taining these speakers. ASSU
tries to work around the agents,

using Stanford's name as a sel
ling point, he said.
$5000 for event
Using funds from the $1 fee
assessed from each student each
quarter, the bureau plans to use
about $5000 to sponsor one
major event each quarter, ac
cording to Mitchell.
Cosell will be on campus Dec.
7 and Wilson on May 2-3. A fall
speaker has not been contacted
as of yet.
The remaining $5000 will be
used for small group activities.
Any group can ask for money

and publicity, according to
Mitchell.
Resources
"We have the resources, as our
prime function is to assist other
groups on campus, setting up
events. Without this type of
input the program would be
much weaker," Mitchell said.
Arranging speakers is a
lengthy subjective process,
Mitchell noted. The first meet
ing involves throwing around
various names and choosing to
pics in the news that are going to
be key issues. Questionnaires are
distributed around campus ask

ing which prospective speakers
are widely known and of in
terest.
Suggestions are also encour
aged, according to Mitchell. Let
ters are sent to prospects. The
response rate is around three per
cent.
"After the summer, we try to
build confidence up on the
bureau after the members have
been unable to locate speakers.
But, eventually things come up.
People such as (Jimmy) Carter or
■(Morris) Udall called last year,
for instance, to say that they
wanted to speak," Mitchell said.
