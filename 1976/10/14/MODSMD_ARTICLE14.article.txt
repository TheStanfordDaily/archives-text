# TV-powerful campaign tactic
## 
### Mary Leblanc 
"The use of T.V. in political
campaigns is the most power
ful single means of com
munication in our country,"
Bud Arnold, president of
Maxwell Arnold Advertising
Agency, said Tuesday.
Lecturing to more than 50
students in the American
Studies House lounge, Ar
nold discussed the technique
of paid political advertising.

In 1960, Arnold success
fully handled the presidential
television campaign for the
late John F. Kennedy. He is
currently the advertising
agent for incumbent U.S. Rep.
Paul McCloskey, Republican
candidate for the 12th con
gressional district.
"Don't think that the adver
tising agent dreams up a
campaign; it's all fairly plan
ned ahead with the cam

paigner," he said.
"If he can't communicate
through the unpaid media,
the press, then the candidate
must buy the time (on T.V.)
and say it," Arnold com
mented.
To illustrate his discussion,
Arnold used original televi
sion campaign commercials
which focused on various
past candidates and ballot is
sues.
