# Brass rubbings display
## 
### 
There's a new option in the
Palo Alto area for the frustrated
artist who dwells in nearly every
would-be master. The option —
brass rubbings.
The brasses, located at the
Hamilton Ave. shop of Walter
Tunick. are reproductions of the
famous British brasses which are
in turn molds from designs
which grace medieval tombs ac
ross Europe.
The technique for making a
rubbing is simple. A heavy paper
is placed across the brass and
then a lithographic crayon is
used to bring out the image on
the paper. The finished product
ran be hung, framed or mounted
and, because they are quite intri
cate designs, they are things of
great beauty.
The technique first interested
Tunick when he was a teacher in
Germany. After returning to the
states, he imported a number of
the brasses and began showing
them and demonstrating the
technique at various schools and
meetings, among them the an
nual Oregon Shakespeare Festi
val.
Tunick has copies of many of
the most famous European bras
ses, some of which date from the
early 14th century. Because of
the age and beauty of the brasses,
Tunick is often called upon to
show his works at classes in
local schools.
"It's a great way to learn his
tory," Tunick said, "because it
traces so many details about life
and art during the medieval
period." Tunick also noted that
the brasses trace the entire
period history and development
of armor.
At present, Tunick is teaching
classes at De Anza and Canada
Colleges and also at Foothill
Junior College. He hopes to ex
pand the popularity of brass
rubbing as an art even further
into the area.
Tunick will be presenting a
demonstration and display of
brass rubbing techniques at Tre
sidder tomorrow.
