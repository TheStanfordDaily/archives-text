# Fine music in Palo Alto
## 
### David Parker 
I'ino music and absurd comedy combined in an
excellent show this past Saturday night at
Sophie's, a Palo Alto club that regularly packs in
some of the best in the May Area. The evening's
entertainment was more than amply provided by
sounds from the Little Roger & The Goosebumps
band as well as a sophisticated parody of the To
night Show by Dick Bright & His Sounds Of De
light Orchestra. They are predominately Bay
Area (California groups and share common origins
dating back three years.
The first song of the Goosebumps' first set sur
prised me with the quality instrumentals and
vocal. Most of the first set was original music by
the group and some of the numbers were stand
outs. Two of the Little Roger's favorites were "No
thing Too Good For My Baby" which he described
.is "bastardized Ricky Ricardo" and "Local
Legend," a slow sensitive vocal number featuring
Little Roger (Roger Glark) himself.
The most exciting song of the set was "A Look
And A Promise." It was a screaming instrumental
that featured some exceptional solos with Richard
Van Dorn on saxophone, Rick Bright (twin brother
of Dick) on violin and John Shields on lead guitar.
The pace of the set heightened and got the crowd
rowdy and hot. The first set also showcased the
Kinks' hit, "Victoria." The Goosebumps' rendi
tion was slick.
The band members changed clothes between
sets. My prize went to the base player, David Sea
bury, who returned decked in tight black leather
pants with matching jacket, and engaged in a
sunglass-solo throughout the set — intermittently
wearing one of five pairs of shades. The set began
delicately with Little Rogers' vocal entrance into

the Goosebumps' version of a second Kinks tune,
"So Tired." The third song of the set "Those Dirty
Birds" was another group original and h;id impre
ssive fiddle and lead guitar solos.
The best received number was a medly oj tunes
from the Supremes with "Stop In The Name Of
Love" among other favorites. The set closed out
with the Beatles' "Back In The USSR." When it
was finished I was exhausted.
Dick Bright, star of The Tonight Show parody,
played the part of oik; of Johnny Carson's guest
hosts. The sketch featured several inane guests.
John Shield's satirized version of Glen Campbell's
"Like A Rhinestone Cowboy" was well received.
The queerest guest spot was a latent S&M version
of "You Don't Own Me," complete with leather
choke collar and a lingerie-clad femme fatale.
The Tonight Show's big band sound was pro
vided by the Sounds of Delight Orchestra. The
orchestra was composed of about 30 Berkeley
musicians and produced some excellent sounds.
Not to be outdone, Dick Bright generated some
bizarre audience participation, including a pie in
his face and a Stump the Band contest. Though
not as electrifying as the music before, The To
night Show was a real crowd pleaserand a fitting
end to a very fine night.
In the future, Little Roger and the Goosebumps
plan to take off a month to break in a new drum
mer and add some material to their repertoire.
Their upcoming engagements together with Dick
Bright And The Sounds Of Delight include con
vention, club and concert dates. If they play in the
future as tightly and as enjoyably as they did at
Sophies then perhaps within a year you'll find
them performing to enthusiastic sell-out crowds
in Frost.

I'ino music and absurd comedy combined in an
excellent show this past Saturday night at
Sophie's, a Palo Alto club that regularly packs in
some of the best in the May Area. The evening's
entertainment was more than amply provided by
sounds from the Little Roger & The Goosebumps
band as well as a sophisticated parody of the To
night Show by Dick Bright & His Sounds Of De
light Orchestra. They are predominately Bay
Area (California groups and share common origins
dating back three years.
The first song of the Goosebumps' first set sur
prised me with the quality instrumentals and
vocal. Most of the first set was original music by
the group and some of the numbers were stand
outs. Two of the Little Roger's favorites were "No
thing Too Good For My Baby" which he described
.is "bastardized Ricky Ricardo" and "Local
Legend," a slow sensitive vocal number featuring
Little Roger (Roger Glark) himself.
The most exciting song of the set was "A Look
And A Promise." It was a screaming instrumental
that featured some exceptional solos with Richard
Van Dorn on saxophone, Rick Bright (twin brother
of Dick) on violin and John Shields on lead guitar.
The pace of the set heightened and got the crowd
rowdy and hot. The first set also showcased the
Kinks' hit, "Victoria." The Goosebumps' rendi
tion was slick.
The band members changed clothes between
sets. My prize went to the base player, David Sea
bury, who returned decked in tight black leather
pants with matching jacket, and engaged in a
sunglass-solo throughout the set — intermittently
wearing one of five pairs of shades. The set began
delicately with Little Rogers' vocal entrance into

the Goosebumps' version of a second Kinks tune,
"So Tired." The third song of the set "Those Dirty
Birds" was another group original and h;id impre
ssive fiddle and lead guitar solos.
The best received number was a medly oj tunes
from the Supremes with "Stop In The Name Of
Love" among other favorites. The set closed out
with the Beatles' "Back In The USSR." When it
was finished I was exhausted.
Dick Bright, star of The Tonight Show parody,
played the part of oik; of Johnny Carson's guest
hosts. The sketch featured several inane guests.
John Shield's satirized version of Glen Campbell's
"Like A Rhinestone Cowboy" was well received.
The queerest guest spot was a latent S&M version
of "You Don't Own Me," complete with leather
choke collar and a lingerie-clad femme fatale.
The Tonight Show's big band sound was pro
vided by the Sounds of Delight Orchestra. The
orchestra was composed of about 30 Berkeley
musicians and produced some excellent sounds.
Not to be outdone, Dick Bright generated some
bizarre audience participation, including a pie in
his face and a Stump the Band contest. Though
not as electrifying as the music before, The To
night Show was a real crowd pleaserand a fitting
end to a very fine night.
In the future, Little Roger and the Goosebumps
plan to take off a month to break in a new drum
mer and add some material to their repertoire.
Their upcoming engagements together with Dick
Bright And The Sounds Of Delight include con
vention, club and concert dates. If they play in the
future as tightly and as enjoyably as they did at
Sophies then perhaps within a year you'll find
them performing to enthusiastic sell-out crowds
in Frost.
