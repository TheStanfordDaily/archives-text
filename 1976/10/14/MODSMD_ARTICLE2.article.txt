# Energy price hikes hit campus (again)

Higher energy costs and increased
consumption could push the universi
ty's energy bill to $5 million this year
compared to $2.9 million in 1975-76,
according to Robert McKnight, uni
versity utilities manager.
The university has had to increase
its peak load from Pacific Gas and Elec
tric to 13,000 kilowatts from 12,350
kilowatts, which may cause electricity
costs to reach $2 million from $1.4
million, he said.
Natural gas and fuel oil costs may
doublefromsl.s million tos3 million,
McKnight noted. Depending on
weather and projected gas shortages,
the university may be forced to use fuel
oil for as many as 75 days this winter,
he said.
"We're squeezing like hell to hold
energy usage even with (the amount
used) last year." McKnight added,
however, "A whale of a lot of lights
and other equipment are being left on,
needlessly in some instances."
In an effort to keep energy costs
down, the university has implemented
a new IBM system computer.
This preprogrammed system con
trols peak demand by shutting off and

turning on environmental systems in
university buildings throughout the
day.
The new system will save the uni
versity a "phenomenal amount of
money," McKnight said.
Acording to McKnight, the IBM sys
tem 7 is not yet operating at its full
potential. The university will be able
to conserve more energy tied into the
system.
The new Fairchild neurosciences,
Terman engineering and Mudd
chemistry buildings will put added
strain on energy conservation efforts,
said McKnight. He said the buildings
projected electrical loads were in
cluded in the $5 million energy bill
estimate.
Plant Services is presently studying
alternative energy sources and in
creased utility control, according to
McKnight. He said that solar energy
does not yet appear financially viable
here, but added, "We're not sitting on
it." The Energy Management Office,
located in the Service Operations
building, is addressing itself to the
energy problem."
Dan DeYoung, director of service
operations, said that the Energy Man
