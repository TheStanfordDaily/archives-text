# Cowboy shines in hit film
## From rodeo to movies 
### Howard Baldwin 
Larry Mahan used to be a
rodeo superstar. Now he's an
actor and a singer. Since rodeo is
partially flamboyant entertain
ment for those who enjoy seeing
men pitted against animals and
stopwatches, some might say
there's not much of a difference.
Nevertheless, Mahan. after win
ning six national rodeo champ
ionships, has come to prefer
cameras and music to broncos
and busting.
As the co-star of the Academy
Award-winning documentary.
The Great American Cowboy,
Mahan became interested in the
movies, and has since made Six
Pack Annie and Mackintosh and
T.J. with Roy Rogers. His upcom
ing appearances include a Movie
of the Week and a Streets of San
Francisco episode.
And as for the future, he says,
"There's a lot of things happen
ing that I'm really excited about
— or at least," he adds with a
characteristic touch of humor,
"that my agent tells me 1 should
be excited about." One of which
being a film called /.IV. and Bil
lie Bob, which he describes as a
modern-day Hutch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid.
How does a rodeo star stir up
the emotions an actor needs?
Mahan explains, "Although my
background has not been in the
field of acting . . . for what 1
want to do 1 really feel my life
will definitely be very advan
tageous to my career as an ac
tor . . . There's a lot of things 1
can identify with that a lot of
people cannot — different kinds
of fear that people don't know
about; pain. too. 1 don't know
how to explain pain, but 1 think 1
can identify with it."
He continues. "1 really feel
comfortable now with my act
ing. I'm reaching the point now
that 1 want to reach. The thing 1
like about acting is that you can
always keep improving and keep
growing, and there are so many
areas to go into. That'sthething
that turns me on about that
whole world."
Mahan has come a long way
since Salem, Oregon, where he
entered his first rodeo at age
twelve and won six dollars and a

belt buckle. From then on he was
hooked. "When 1 got into the
rodeo thing, at like fourteen, fif
teen, hell, 1 was a straight
running little redneck kid and
all I wanted to be was a cowboy."
Although he headed for
Arizona State College in
Phoenix to major in rodeo sports,
one rodeo event changed his de
stiny forever. So momentous
was the occasion that Mahan
still recounts it excitedly. "1 won
$852 on a black bull, number
nine in El Paso in 1963 . . . Feb
ruary. 1 said, 'That's it, man!' I'd
never seen that much money be
fore in my life. That was an easy
eight seconds. 1 swear I cannot
remember bulls that 1 got on last
month, but 1 can remember rides
that 1 took eight, ten. twelve
years ago. Suddenly 1 decided,
'Who needs an education? The
College of Hard Knocks, that's
what 1 want'."
He can recite his chronology
by cataloguing his body's scars,
just as a boxer can tally the years'
toll on his face. Brimming with
stories of injuries and their repa
rations, he makes them sound as
natural to him as breathing. But
for all its pain and violence,
Mahan still loves the rodeo
world, for it has had the most
prevalent effect on his past.
In describing his feelings
about it, he says, "It's been a
good life," and refers to a
friend's words—"l wouldn't
take a million dollars for the ex
periences I've had, and I'd give
two dollars for some more ol
them."
