# Wild West show wins
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
One of the most grueling
sports ever created, it pits men
against time, against animals,
against other men. against them
selves. The competition is fierce,
the physical pain intense, the
rewards often meager. Keith
Merrill's film, The (ireat Ameri
can Cowboy, shows in all its
brutal glory rodeo, perhaps the
oldest sport of all. born of the
Wild West out of boredom and
the need for accomplishment.
The film won the Academy
Award for best documentary in
1974, but has not been distri
buted until now, under the
supervision of Doty-Dayton Pro
ductions. It traces a year in the
careers of rodeo superstars Larry
Mahan and Phil Lyne as they
compete for the top prize in
rodeo. Providing a composite
view of rodeo interesting to both
the seasoned rodeo fan and the
naive initiate, the film covers
every aspect of the sport, from
bronco-busting and calf-roping
to barrel-racing and bull-riding,
with the story of Lyne and
Mahan tying the threads to
gether.
As a whole beautifully photo
graphed, a plethora of intermit
tent slow-motion scenes of rodeo
events lend a lyrical aura to the
film, striking a note of grace
among the bone-crushing vio
lence of the sport. Indeed, some
times it appears as if rollerball
has actually arrived with all its
aggressive action.
But as Mahan savs in the film,

(here is a great sense of satisfac
tion when a rodeo participant
realizes he has succeeded in an
event on his own. without the
help of a team. The credit be
longs to him — but then so does
the blame should he fail. Mahan
prefers it that way.
The life of the rodeo cowboy is
a difficult one. in which compet
ition stalks the cowboys and top
mental and physical acumen is
needed every step of the way.
In a recent interview in San
Francisco, Mahan commented
about the importance of desire in
the sport. "90 percent of it for me
is the mental attitude. The phys
ical and mental approach to the
game — that's the key right
there. If you have those two
things going for you, you can be
a winner. If you don't, you can't.
If you have the timing, the <it hle
tic ability, the coordination, the
balance, then you have to have
the desire. 1 have rodeo schools
.. . you can line the guys up —
five to ten guys physically the
same — but after the first day you
know which guys are gonna
make it because of their mental
attitude and their desire and just
how badly they really want
something."
In its way, rodeo resembles all
other sports, with its debilitating
effects and its danger. But more
than any other sport, rodeo also
encompasses a flamboyance
found in entertainment. It has its
superstars and personalities too,
even more than any other sport
because of the lack of a team.
Conversely, there is nothing on
which to fall back but oneself in
times of strife.
Mahan, in the same interview,
admitted an affinity for players
of that other great American pas
time. "I can identify now more
with the football player and
what it takes for him to be a win
ner as it does me, than I can with
a rancher, who makes his living
on a ranch."

is the story of those who are
perhaps the last of the most rug

life, its advantages and draw
backs, and the men who are
permanently attached to it.

found in entertainment. It has its
superstars and personalities too,
even more than any other sport
because of the lack of a team.
Conversely, there is nothing on
which to fall back but oneself in
times of strife.
Mahan, in the same interview,
admitted an affinity for players
of that other great American pas
time. "I can identify now more
with the football player and
what it takes for him to be a win
ner as it does me, than I can with
a rancher, who makes his living
on a ranch."
The Greot American Cowboy
is the story of those who are
perhaps the last of the most rug
ged individualists in America, a
documentary about the sporting
life, its advantages and draw
backs, and the men who are
permanently attached to it.
One of the most grueling
sports ever created, it pits men
against time, against animals,
against other men. against them
selves. The competition is fierce,
the physical pain intense, the
rewards often meager. Keith
Merrill's film, The (ireat Ameri
can Cowboy, shows in all its
brutal glory rodeo, perhaps the
oldest sport of all. born of the
Wild West out of boredom and
the need for accomplishment.
The film won the Academy
Award for best documentary in
1974, but has not been distri
buted until now, under the
supervision of Doty-Dayton Pro
ductions. It traces a year in the
careers of rodeo superstars Larry
Mahan and Phil Lyne as they
compete for the top prize in
rodeo. Providing a composite
view of rodeo interesting to both
the seasoned rodeo fan and the
naive initiate, the film covers
every aspect of the sport, from
bronco-busting and calf-roping
to barrel-racing and bull-riding,
with the story of Lyne and
Mahan tying the threads to
gether.
As a whole beautifully photo
graphed, a plethora of intermit
tent slow-motion scenes of rodeo
events lend a lyrical aura to the
film, striking a note of grace
among the bone-crushing vio
lence of the sport. Indeed, some
times it appears as if rollerball
has actually arrived with all its
aggressive action.
But as Mahan savs in the film,

(here is a great sense of satisfac
tion when a rodeo participant
realizes he has succeeded in an
event on his own. without the
help of a team. The credit be
longs to him — but then so does
the blame should he fail. Mahan
prefers it that way.
The life of the rodeo cowboy is
a difficult one. in which compet
ition stalks the cowboys and top
mental and physical acumen is
needed every step of the way.
In a recent interview in San
Francisco, Mahan commented
about the importance of desire in
the sport. "90 percent of it for me
is the mental attitude. The phys
ical and mental approach to the
game — that's the key right
there. If you have those two
things going for you, you can be
a winner. If you don't, you can't.
If you have the timing, the <it hle
tic ability, the coordination, the
balance, then you have to have
the desire. 1 have rodeo schools
.. . you can line the guys up —
five to ten guys physically the
same — but after the first day you
know which guys are gonna
make it because of their mental
attitude and their desire and just
how badly they really want
something."
In its way, rodeo resembles all
other sports, with its debilitating
effects and its danger. But more

encompasses a flamboyance
