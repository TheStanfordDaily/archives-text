# Fall fair: graduates' delight
## 
### Scott Parker 
Dear Graduate Students: Are you lonely, under
fed. or cloistered? Does Stanford seem to be solely
designed for those freshmen wombats you see
frolicking about? Well, brighten up, because have
we got news for you!
The first inaugural installment of Graduate
Weekend is coming your way. Between Saturday
the 16th of October and late that Sunday evening
lies a curriculum that will entice even the most
withdrawn graduate.
At approximately 5 p.m. or after the football
game, which ever comes first, the Graduate Even
ing segment "kicks off" with a barbeque at the
patio behind Tresidder Union. For a small fee of
$1. graduate students, spouses, and their children
can enjoy hamburgers, hot dogs, baked beans, and
condiments. Free beer is provided during the
evening. Also adding to the atmosphere will bean
amazing prestidigitator, or magician if you prefer,
performing to entertain the diners.
Folk concert
After the meal, the next item on the agenda is a
square dance on the Tresidder deck from 6-9 p.m.
Or if dosie-doe-ing is not your cup of tea. there is a
"candlelight and pillow" folk concert with Herb
Moore and Company in the large lounge from 7-10
p.m. Did you miss the magic show?The magician

will be upstairs in the lobby performing during
the square dance. And, if you've still got some
boogie left, let it loose to the sounds of Sunnyb
rook at the rock dance from 9:30-12:30 downstairs
on the main floor.
Then on Sunday at 1 p.m., (leaving plenty of
time to recover from those hangovers) is the sec
ond annual Escondido Village Fall l air, on the
Escondido grounds. There will be arts and crafts
booths, a rummage sale (for the bargain hunters),
wandering minstrels, tree refreshments, a balloon
clown, food booths, plus an information booth to
tell you what's happening when. As an extra
added attraction, the Stanford Band will make a
cameo appearance, rallying people to the fair. I he
festivities go on all afternoon, and can't studying
for those courses wait?
Monetary endowment for the weekend is cour
tesy of Tresidder Union (and Dan Williams), the
Escondido Council, the ASSU, and the Craduate
Studies Office. Coordinating the entire effort is
none other than Deric Jennings, a graduate stu
dent himself from the ASSII Council of Presi
dents.
So, for all you academic "oldies but goodies,"
here is your chance to meet a few of the "invisible
6,000" graduate students on the Stanford campus
and have a great time in the process.

Dear Graduate Students: Are you lonely, under
fed. or cloistered? Does Stanford seem to be solely
designed for those freshmen wombats you see
frolicking about? Well, brighten up, because have
we got news for you!
The first inaugural installment of Graduate
Weekend is coming your way. Between Saturday
the 16th of October and late that Sunday evening
lies a curriculum that will entice even the most
withdrawn graduate.
At approximately 5 p.m. or after the football
game, which ever comes first, the Graduate Even
ing segment "kicks off" with a barbeque at the
patio behind Tresidder Union. For a small fee of
$1. graduate students, spouses, and their children
can enjoy hamburgers, hot dogs, baked beans, and
condiments. Free beer is provided during the
evening. Also adding to the atmosphere will bean
amazing prestidigitator, or magician if you prefer,
performing to entertain the diners.
Folk concert
After the meal, the next item on the agenda is a
square dance on the Tresidder deck from 6-9 p.m.
Or if dosie-doe-ing is not your cup of tea. there is a
"candlelight and pillow" folk concert with Herb
Moore and Company in the large lounge from 7-10
p.m. Did you miss the magic show?The magician

will be upstairs in the lobby performing during
the square dance. And, if you've still got some
boogie left, let it loose to the sounds of Sunnyb
rook at the rock dance from 9:30-12:30 downstairs
on the main floor.
Then on Sunday at 1 p.m., (leaving plenty of
time to recover from those hangovers) is the sec
ond annual Escondido Village Fall l air, on the
Escondido grounds. There will be arts and crafts
booths, a rummage sale (for the bargain hunters),
wandering minstrels, tree refreshments, a balloon
clown, food booths, plus an information booth to
tell you what's happening when. As an extra
added attraction, the Stanford Band will make a
cameo appearance, rallying people to the fair. I he
festivities go on all afternoon, and can't studying
for those courses wait?
Monetary endowment for the weekend is cour
tesy of Tresidder Union (and Dan Williams), the
Escondido Council, the ASSU, and the Craduate
Studies Office. Coordinating the entire effort is
none other than Deric Jennings, a graduate stu
dent himself from the ASSII Council of Presi
dents.
So, for all you academic "oldies but goodies,"
here is your chance to meet a few of the "invisible
6,000" graduate students on the Stanford campus
and have a great time in the process.
