# Woody Stars in 'The Front'
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
The Front opens with Frank
Sinatra singing Young At Heart
overan ironic stream of filmclips
from the 1950'5. The juxtaposi
tion of the optomistic song with
the downbeat film characterizes
the McCarthy era perfectly, for it
was an era when lies were consi
dered truth and truth considered
lies.
For those of us too young to
remember the blacklistings and
the witchhunts, The Front may
seem an incredibly bizarre adap
tion of 1984, about a period
when people were forced out of
work and hounded because their
names appeared on a list that
everyone refused to admit even
existed.
For producer-director Martin
Ritt, screenwriter Walter Berns
tein, and co-stars Herschel Ber
nardi and Zero Mostel, though,
The Front must have been a
catharthis, for they were all
black-listed in those dark days of
the House Un-American Ac
tivities Committee.
Blacklisted writers
Along with Woody Allen, in
his first dramatic role, they have
fashioned the story of a
spendthrift bookie named How
ard Prince (Allen) who agrees to
become a front for blacklisted
writers for a piece of the action.
Sacrificing his own identity,
his fame grows until he has
progressed from a nobody who
does exist to a somebody who
doesn't exist. People compli
ment him constantly, his brother
looks upon him with new re
spect, the script editor falls for
him. Suddenly he's a somebody,
and his ego has kept pace with

his stature. But just as suddenly,
the balloon bursts, and Prince is
forced to make a choice.
The happy-though-bitter
sweet ending provides Ritt
and Bernstein with their revenge
and Prince with his desire in life
— to be a somebody who does
exist.
Along the way, though, he has
discovered all that made the
witchhunts the horror that they
were — the desperation of the
performers, ending in one's
suicide; the power of the spon
sors; the self-riteousness of those
who believed they did the coun
try a great service by their
haphazard accusations.
National nightmare
The Front is about involve
ment, about sticking one's neck
out, and the limits to which
people will go to survive.
Coupled with the need for survi
val is a determined search for
justice by both the performers
and their adversaries, the irony
being how different their con
ceptions were.
Although The Front isn't
deep, it holds a fascination
mixed with horror like All The
President's Men that something
that dastardly could have hap
pened in the United States so re
cently.
Also like President's Men, it is
our history, something we can't
deny or obscure, but rather
something we must remember to
avoid its repetition. The Front's
personal view of a national
nightmare provides a worth
while vision of the way it was
and the way one can only hope it
won't ever be again.
