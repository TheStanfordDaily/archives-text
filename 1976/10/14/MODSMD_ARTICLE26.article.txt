Ford plants start up after strike ends
Detroit — For the first time in 29 days, a few Ford Motor
Co. assembly lines cranked up yesterday following nar
row ratification of a new industry-pattern contract cover
ing 170,000 United Auto Workers.
The automaker's Wixom, Mich., plant was set to roll out
the first finished car yesterday since the coast-to-coast
walkout idled 102 facilities in 22 states at midnight Sept.
14.
However, it remained uncertain when the nation's
number-two car producer would be back to normal with
all its workers back on the job. There were still unresolved
local labor disputes at dozens of plants.
A Ford spokesman said yesterday that 27 of 99 bargain
ing units still were without new three-year local agree
ments concerning general working conditions. The union
has ordered workers to remain on strike at facilities that
have not settled locally.
Six of Ford's 18 assembly plants and 11 vital manufac
turing plants — which provide assembly plants with en
gines, glass, transmissions and other parts — were among
those without local pacts.
The strike already has lost Ford 350,000 vehicles with a
factory value of $1.8 billion from its North American pro
duction schedules. Much of it can be made up through
overtime later this fall.
President signs revenue-sharing bill
Washington — President Cerald Ford had the campaign
stump all to himself yesterday as he signed the renewal of
federal revenue sharing. He toured middle-class areas
around New York City while the other candidates stayed
home.
Carrying familiar themes to new platforms in half a
dozen New York and New Jersey cities. Ford treated his
audiences to a catalogue of what he called Carter's con
tradictions on tax and economic issues.
He picked a financially distressed city with a Republi
can mayor — Yonkeis, N.Y. — in which to sign the 45-
month revenue sharing extension that will provide states
and cities with $25.5 billion.
Unlike most other federal aid programs, revenue shar
ing provides money that states and cities can spend on
virtually whatever they choose. "That means you in Yon
kers, you in Westchester County will be making the deci

sions rather than some bureaucrat on the banks of the
Potomac," Ford said.
Jimmy Carter has said the program ought to be extended
but revised to omit states and go to cities only, because he
thinks local governments cannot generate tax revenues as
easily as states can.
Photos of Mao's widow not sold
Tokyo — Photographs of Mao Tse-tung's widow and
three other leaders of the Chinese radical left have been
withdrawn from public sale.
The unavailability of photographs lent credence to un
official reports that Mao's widow, Chiang Ching, and the
other three leftists have been purged since photographs of
disgraced leaders usually are quickly withdrawn in
China.
The Peking correspondent of the Japanese newspaper
Vomiuri said diplomatic sources tried to buy pictures of
the four purged radicals, but the Chinese refused with the
explanation they were too busy making photographs of
Mao, who died a month ago.
Today's weather

Mao, who died a month ago.

Ford plants start up after strike ends
Detroit — For the first time in 29 days, a few Ford Motor
Co. assembly lines cranked up yesterday following nar
row ratification of a new industry-pattern contract cover
ing 170,000 United Auto Workers.
The automaker's Wixom, Mich., plant was set to roll out
the first finished car yesterday since the coast-to-coast
walkout idled 102 facilities in 22 states at midnight Sept.
14.
However, it remained uncertain when the nation's
number-two car producer would be back to normal with
all its workers back on the job. There were still unresolved
local labor disputes at dozens of plants.
A Ford spokesman said yesterday that 27 of 99 bargain
ing units still were without new three-year local agree
ments concerning general working conditions. The union
has ordered workers to remain on strike at facilities that
have not settled locally.
Six of Ford's 18 assembly plants and 11 vital manufac
turing plants — which provide assembly plants with en
gines, glass, transmissions and other parts — were among
those without local pacts.
The strike already has lost Ford 350,000 vehicles with a
factory value of $1.8 billion from its North American pro
duction schedules. Much of it can be made up through
overtime later this fall.
President signs revenue-sharing bill
Washington — President Cerald Ford had the campaign
stump all to himself yesterday as he signed the renewal of
federal revenue sharing. He toured middle-class areas
around New York City while the other candidates stayed
home.
Carrying familiar themes to new platforms in half a
dozen New York and New Jersey cities. Ford treated his
audiences to a catalogue of what he called Carter's con
tradictions on tax and economic issues.
He picked a financially distressed city with a Republi
can mayor — Yonkeis, N.Y. — in which to sign the 45-
month revenue sharing extension that will provide states
and cities with $25.5 billion.
Unlike most other federal aid programs, revenue shar
ing provides money that states and cities can spend on
virtually whatever they choose. "That means you in Yon
kers, you in Westchester County will be making the deci

sions rather than some bureaucrat on the banks of the
Potomac," Ford said.
Jimmy Carter has said the program ought to be extended
but revised to omit states and go to cities only, because he
thinks local governments cannot generate tax revenues as
easily as states can.
Photos of Mao's widow not sold
Tokyo — Photographs of Mao Tse-tung's widow and
three other leaders of the Chinese radical left have been
withdrawn from public sale.
The unavailability of photographs lent credence to un
official reports that Mao's widow, Chiang Ching, and the
other three leftists have been purged since photographs of
disgraced leaders usually are quickly withdrawn in
China.
The Peking correspondent of the Japanese newspaper
Vomiuri said diplomatic sources tried to buy pictures of
the four purged radicals, but the Chinese refused with the
explanation they were too busy making photographs of
Mao, who died a month ago.
