# Palo Alto City Council
## Bike storage plan passes 
### Lonnie Rosenwald 
An innovative plan to provide stor
age and locking facilities for bicycles
at a variety of public and business loca
tions narrowly escaped deletion from
the Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan at a
City Council meeting Tuesday night.
The close 5-2 vote seemed to signal a
shift in the sentiments of the council
which has traditionally taken a tough
environmentalist stand on local trans
portation issues.
The small margin also prepared the
way for a reversal of the decision
should either of two absent council
members ask for a second vote at a later
date.
The proposal, listed as Program 37
in the Comprehensive Plan, calls on
the city to "provide and require
facilities for storing and locking bicy
cles at business and employment cen
ters, transfer points and recreational
facilities."
What makes the plan unique is its
further suggestion that "private de
velopers could be required to provide
bicycle parking in the same way that
vehicle parking is required."
Environment-conscious community
Palo Alto is considered a progres
sive community in its efforts to make
bicycling a viable mode of transporta
tion and has installed an extensive
network of bicycle paths throughout
the city.
Future bicycle provisions, also in
cluded in the Comprehensive Plan,
call for more bike paths as well as the
removal of hazardous impediments
along the routes and the development
of "bicycle boulevards" — streets from
which cars would be banned and on
which bicycles would be given right
of-way at all intersections.
However, the present City Council
has watered down the language of

these programs, by inserting terms like
"encourage" and "pursue feasibility."
Critics have accused the council of
withdrawing its traditional support for
alternatives to the automobile.
"The attitude of the City Council is
now that the car is here to stay,"
charged Civic League member Ellen
Fletcher.
To "reduce the growth of auto traf
fic" became a major goal in the original
version of the Comprehensive Flan.

However, the current City Council,
which has been in office since June
1975, recommended that instead of re
ducing the growth of auto traffic as
stated in the Plan that efforts be made
to "increase efficient use of au
tomobile transportation."
The council also stated that it would
"particularly encourage car and van
pooling, use of walking and less pol
luting, more efficient modes of trans
portation."

alternatives to the automobile.
"The attitude of the City Council is
now that the car is here to stay,"
charged Civic League member Ellen
Fletcher.
To "reduce the growth of auto traf
fic" became a major goal in the original
version of the Comprehensive Flan.

However, the current City Council,
which has been in office since June
1975, recommended that instead of re
ducing the growth of auto traffic as
stated in the Plan that efforts be made
to "increase efficient use of au
tomobile transportation."
The council also stated that it would
"particularly encourage car and van
pooling, use of walking and less pol
luting, more efficient modes of trans
portation."
An innovative plan to provide stor
age and locking facilities for bicycles
at a variety of public and business loca
tions narrowly escaped deletion from
the Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan at a
City Council meeting Tuesday night.
The close 5-2 vote seemed to signal a
shift in the sentiments of the council
which has traditionally taken a tough
environmentalist stand on local trans
portation issues.
The small margin also prepared the
way for a reversal of the decision
should either of two absent council
members ask for a second vote at a later
date.
The proposal, listed as Program 37
in the Comprehensive Plan, calls on
the city to "provide and require
facilities for storing and locking bicy
cles at business and employment cen
ters, transfer points and recreational
facilities."
What makes the plan unique is its
further suggestion that "private de
velopers could be required to provide
bicycle parking in the same way that
vehicle parking is required."
Environment-conscious community
Palo Alto is considered a progres
sive community in its efforts to make
bicycling a viable mode of transporta
tion and has installed an extensive
network of bicycle paths throughout
the city.
Future bicycle provisions, also in
cluded in the Comprehensive Plan,
call for more bike paths as well as the
removal of hazardous impediments
along the routes and the development
of "bicycle boulevards" — streets from
which cars would be banned and on
which bicycles would be given right
of-way at all intersections.
However, the present City Council
has watered down the language of

these programs, by inserting terms like
"encourage" and "pursue feasibility."
Critics have accused the council of
withdrawing its traditional support for
alternatives to the automobile.
