# Harris, McCloskey debate here tonight
## 
### Mark Funk 
Rep. Paul McCloskey Jr., and Demo
cratic challenger David Harris square
off in a debate on governmental reform
at 8:30 tonight in Kresge Auditorium.
It will mark the second formal de
hate for the candidates, who will meet
two more times before the Nov. 2 gen
eral election.
It is expected that Harris, who has
taken up Jimmy Carter's anti-
Washington D.C. refrain with a few
twists of his own. will attempt to paint
McCloskey as a congressional "in
sider."
McCloskey, who won a tough prim
ary fight in 1974 because of a last ditch
effort to get Stanford students and fa
culty to register Republican will prob
ably raise the question of Harris' "radi
cal" past.
Harris spent 20 months in a federal
prison for draft resistance and has re

cently released a book on his experi
ences behind bars.
Harris will likely stress the fact that
he believes congressmen should only
be allowed to stay in office eight years.
McCloskey, if he wins re-election, will
be serving his fifth term.
The debate, sponsored by SWOPSI,
SCOPE and the Law Association, will
have four panelists who will question
the candidates. Prof. Allan Piatt, of the
political science department, Tom
Graham of SWOPSI, Bob Freelan of the
government relations department,
Herb Borock of The Grapevine and
Kirk Comstock. former mayor of Palo
Alto, will make up the panel.
Harris' staff said yesterday that he
will spend today preparing for the de
bate. McCloskey. on the other hand, is
maintaining a full schedule of cam
paign appearances before coming to
Stanford.
