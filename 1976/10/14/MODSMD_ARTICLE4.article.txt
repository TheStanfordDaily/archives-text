# ASSU mix-up stalls election
## 
### Mark Funk 
Part of yesterday's senate election
results have been declared invalid be
cause of an error which resulted in the
ommision of three names from the of
ficial ASSU ballot.
Foiling stations had been open for
about two hours before action to cor
rect the mistake was taken. Only
ninety-four people had voted before
the polls were closed at 11 a.m., so
ASSU elections officials could correct
the ballot.
The senate election — with cor
rected ballots — continues today.
Randy Bird, ASSU elections commis
sioner, said those who cast votes be
fore the polls were shut down will be
allowed to vote again.
Bird accepted full responsibility for
the error which resulted in candidates
Robert Valdez, Steve Valelly and
David Varqus' names being left off the
ballot.
Ballot not proofread
He described the foul up as a "cleri
cal error." Apparently, a secretary who
typed up the ballot Tuesday inadver
tantly failed to include the names.
There were supposed to be 69 candi
dates on the list. The ballots, which
were run off that afternoon, were not
checked for errors.
"Basically, it (the oversight) was my
fault for not proofreading," Bird said.
He said he only found out about the
mistake just before 11 a.m.
"All the polls were open again just
after noon," he said.
Senate candidate Steve Valelly said
he was upset with the omission of
his name.
"The fact I was not on the ballot
could affect our (his slate's) chances
(of winning the election)," he said.
"People who have voted once will
probably vote for the same people."
"It seems to me that they could have
proofread their ballots," said Robert
Valdez, another candidate whose
name was left off the slate. "This is
typically ASSU. Hopefully it will not
hurt the people who were left off (the
ballot) too badly."
Longer voting
To compensate for the error, Bird
said the polls will be open an extra two
hours today from 8 a.m., to 5 p.m. Bird
decided to keep them open longer after
he had talked with "about 50 per
cent" of the senate candidates.

Citing an "exhaustion factor," Bird
said some of the candidates rejected
the idea of opening for two hours on
Friday because of the strains of extra
campaigning.
Bird said that if any of the candi
dates wanted to contest the decision
that "it is their right. But I don't think
they will."
"It's about all that can be done with
out postponing the election one day,"
said Valdez.
Valelly said he felt Bird's decision to
extend today's voting two hours was a
correct one. "His (Bird's) handling of
the election beyond the point of the
error has been reasonable."
"Everybody who intends to re-vote,
will," said Bird. He added that any
person who has already voted and had
their student body card marked could
make arrangements with him to vote if
they cannot do it today.
If a person voted before 11 a.m., and
had the 'D' marked out on their ASStI
card, they are eligible to cast another
ballot. Voters who cast ballots after the
mistake was corrected have the 'E'
marked out on their cards.
Problems not uncommon
Vic Petroff, ASSU president, said he
was not taking any action on Bird's
oversight.
"There's still an election in prog
ress," he said. "The elections commis
sioner is in charge of running it — effi
ciently."
Petroff pointed out that foul-ups are
not unknown in ASSU elections.
"We've had controversy before," he
said. "COP, senate elections and re
ferendums have had problems in the
past."
On paper, Petroff added, an election
"looks like a fairly easy thing to run,
but it is more complex than it appears
to be. You must also remember that the
people involved in this mistake are
new to the jobs.
"Randy has only been involved on
the elections commission since last
spring," Petroff said. "This is his first
senate election."
Bird said that the part of the ASSU
constitution dealing with elections
was amended in June of 1975, but does
not specifically address ballot errors.
"It says: refer to a special charge to
elections," Bird said. "But that special
charge has never been written."

Bird accepted full responsibility for
the error which resulted in candidates
Robert Valdez, Steve Valelly and
David Varqus' names being left off the
ballot.
Ballot not proofread
He described the foul up as a "cleri
cal error." Apparently, a secretary who
typed up the ballot Tuesday inadver
tantly failed to include the names.
There were supposed to be 69 candi
dates on the list. The ballots, which
were run off that afternoon, were not
checked for errors.
"Basically, it (the oversight) was my
fault for not proofreading," Bird said.
He said he only found out about the
mistake just before 11 a.m.
"All the polls were open again just
after noon," he said.
Senate candidate Steve Valelly said
he was upset with the omission of
his name.
"The fact I was not on the ballot
could affect our (his slate's) chances
(of winning the election)," he said.
"People who have voted once will
probably vote for the same people."
"It seems to me that they could have
proofread their ballots," said Robert
Valdez, another candidate whose
name was left off the slate. "This is
typically ASSU. Hopefully it will not
hurt the people who were left off (the
ballot) too badly."
Longer voting
To compensate for the error, Bird
said the polls will be open an extra two
hours today from 8 a.m., to 5 p.m. Bird
decided to keep them open longer after
he had talked with "about 50 per
cent" of the senate candidates.

Citing an "exhaustion factor," Bird
said some of the candidates rejected
the idea of opening for two hours on
Friday because of the strains of extra
campaigning.
Bird said that if any of the candi
dates wanted to contest the decision
that "it is their right. But I don't think
they will."
"It's about all that can be done with
out postponing the election one day,"
said Valdez.
Valelly said he felt Bird's decision to
extend today's voting two hours was a
correct one. "His (Bird's) handling of
the election beyond the point of the
error has been reasonable."
"Everybody who intends to re-vote,
will," said Bird. He added that any
person who has already voted and had
their student body card marked could
make arrangements with him to vote if
they cannot do it today.
If a person voted before 11 a.m., and
had the 'D' marked out on their ASStI
card, they are eligible to cast another
ballot. Voters who cast ballots after the
mistake was corrected have the 'E'
marked out on their cards.
Problems not uncommon
Vic Petroff, ASSU president, said he
was not taking any action on Bird's
oversight.
"There's still an election in prog
ress," he said. "The elections commis
sioner is in charge of running it — effi
ciently."
Petroff pointed out that foul-ups are
not unknown in ASSU elections.
"We've had controversy before," he
said. "COP, senate elections and re
ferendums have had problems in the
past."
On paper, Petroff added, an election
"looks like a fairly easy thing to run,
but it is more complex than it appears
to be. You must also remember that the
people involved in this mistake are
new to the jobs.
"Randy has only been involved on
the elections commission since last
spring," Petroff said. "This is his first
senate election."
Bird said that the part of the ASSU
constitution dealing with elections
was amended in June of 1975, but does
not specifically address ballot errors.
"It says: refer to a special charge to
elections," Bird said. "But that special
charge has never been written."
Part of yesterday's senate election
results have been declared invalid be
cause of an error which resulted in the
ommision of three names from the of
ficial ASSU ballot.
Foiling stations had been open for
about two hours before action to cor
rect the mistake was taken. Only
ninety-four people had voted before
the polls were closed at 11 a.m., so
ASSU elections officials could correct
the ballot.
The senate election — with cor
rected ballots — continues today.
Randy Bird, ASSU elections commis
sioner, said those who cast votes be

"All the polls were open again just
after noon," he said.
Senate candidate Steve Valelly said
he was upset with the omission of
his name.
"The fact I was not on the ballot
could affect our (his slate's) chances
(of winning the election)," he said.
"People who have voted once will
probably vote for the same people."
"It seems to me that they could have
proofread their ballots," said Robert
Valdez, another candidate whose
name was left off the slate. "This is
typically ASSU. Hopefully it will not
hurt the people who were left off (the
ballot) too badly."
Longer voting
To compensate for the error, Bird
said the polls will be open an extra two
hours today from 8 a.m., to 5 p.m. Bird
decided to keep them open longer after
he had talked with "about 50 per
cent" of the senate candidates.

Citing an "exhaustion factor," Bird
said some of the candidates rejected
the idea of opening for two hours on
Friday because of the strains of extra
campaigning.
Bird said that if any of the candi
dates wanted to contest the decision
that "it is their right. But I don't think
they will."
"It's about all that can be done with
out postponing the election one day,"
said Valdez.
Valelly said he felt Bird's decision to
extend today's voting two hours was a
correct one. "His (Bird's) handling of
the election beyond the point of the
error has been reasonable."
"Everybody who intends to re-vote,
will," said Bird. He added that any
person who has already voted and had
their student body card marked could
make arrangements with him to vote if
they cannot do it today.
If a person voted before 11 a.m., and
had the 'D' marked out on their ASStI
card, they are eligible to cast another
ballot. Voters who cast ballots after the
mistake was corrected have the 'E'
marked out on their cards.
Problems not uncommon
Vic Petroff, ASSU president, said he
was not taking any action on Bird's
oversight.
"There's still an election in prog
ress," he said. "The elections commis
sioner is in charge of running it — effi
ciently."
Petroff pointed out that foul-ups are
not unknown in ASSU elections.
"We've had controversy before," he
said. "COP, senate elections and re
ferendums have had problems in the
past."
On paper, Petroff added, an election
"looks like a fairly easy thing to run,
but it is more complex than it appears
to be. You must also remember that the
people involved in this mistake are
new to the jobs.
"Randy has only been involved on
the elections commission since last
spring," Petroff said. "This is his first
senate election."
Bird said that the part of the ASSU
constitution dealing with elections
was amended in June of 1975, but does
not specifically address ballot errors.
"It says: refer to a special charge to
elections," Bird said. "But that special
charge has never been written."
