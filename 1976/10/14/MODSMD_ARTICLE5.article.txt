## New laws irk campaigners 
### Marc Strassman 
Republican and Democratic organi
zations in the mid-Peninsula area are
directing their efforts toward electing
their entire slate of candidates because
of new federal laws limiting the
amount of money they may spend on
behalf of their presidential and vice
presidential nominees.
"It's stifling us, at least for the mo
ment," said Win Foster, chairman of
the Carter-Mondale Steering Commit
tee for Palo Alto.
"We have so far done nothing that is
exclusively Carter-Mondale oriented
apart from the entire Democratic tic
ket," he said. "My feeling is that the
safest thing is to be very conservative
in our spending."
A volunteer worker at the Republi
can office on El Camino who declined
to be identified said, "People are very
dubious about what they're doing.
"They're afraid of doing something
that will be wrong for the party or
wrong for the candidates."
She said the amount of money spent
by the local Republican organization
so far for Ford and Dole has been
"miniscule."

Both Democrats and Republicans
said they felt that the new law, which
prohibits local political organizations
from spending more than $1000 to di
rectly support their respective presi
dential and vice-presidential candi
dates, will significantly diminish their
ability to present the nominees and
their programs to the electorate.
"It's true you're no longer going to
see newspaper ads and billboards for
the candidates, or anything like that,"
said Foster.
Walker said that no more than 1000
President Ford buttons will be availa
ble in the county.
He said the new requirements, part
of the Federal Election Campaign Act
Amendments of 1974, may reduce
the amount of political exposure the
public receives. This may result in "a
more ignorant electorate," he said.
He also commented that it was
ironic that in a bicentennial year when
the actions of individuals who
"wanted more liberty" are lauded,
'"no one is really sure if they can print
a brochure" without violating the law.
Winnie Therien, treasurer for the
Santa Clara County Republican Cent

ral Committee, said that the reporting
procedures required by the state Fair
Campaign Practices Commission are
"very complicated to the point of
being ridiculous."
She said for every contribution over
$50, the committees have to submit the
name, address, and place of business
of the donor and indicate if the donor
is self-employed.
Walker called the reporting re
quirements "a mass of bureaucracy
that becomes idiotic after a point."
In order to comply with the $1000
limit, Democratic party campaign
committees are supporting the party
slate as a whole rather than just the
Carter-Mondale national ticket, said
Foster.
He said he did not know the commit
tee's local campaign spending limit al
lowed for the entire slate of candi
dates.
Party togetherness
At the precinct level, volunteers
passing out Carter-Mondale literature
are also distributing materials urging
votes for Democratic senatorial in
cumbant John Tunney, congressional
hopeful David Harris and assembly
candidate Victor Calvo.
Foster praised the Harris campaign
for the support it has given the na
tional ticket of Carter-Mondale, say
ing, "I shudder to think of what «ve
would have done" if the resources of
the well-organized campaign for the
former Stanford student body presi
dent had not been available to the Car
ter campaign hc.e.
According to Walker, Democrats,
Republicans and county registrars ear
lier this year appealed to a state legisla
tive committee for relief from the re
porting requirements.
He said all three groups Were
"unanimous" in their complaint that
"no one knows what the law is." They
requested clear guidelines explaining
exactly what information is required
and how to coordinate local filing
dates with federal filing dates.
"Implicit in all this was our request
to make (the law) simpler so that vol
unteers could perform the necessary
reporting procedures," said Walker.
"While the purpose of the reforms
was to diminish the significance of
massive fund raising, its result has
been to stifle local freedom to do
things for the national campaign,"
concluded Foster.
