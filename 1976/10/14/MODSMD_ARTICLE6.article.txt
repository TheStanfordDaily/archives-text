# Law test blues
## 
### 
Paul Bauman

The only feeling I've ever had simi
lar to the one I experienced before and
during the Law School Admission
Test (LSAT) Saturday was that of
going to the dentist as a child to have
teeth pulled. In both cases, you know
the next few hours are going to be pure
agony. The only difference is that you
know you'll live through the LSAT. Of
course, while taking the test, you may
not care whether you do or not.
I was in Los Angeles for the
Stanford-UCLA football game last
weekend, so I took the LSAT at UCLA.
In the 24 hours prior to the test, I didn't
know whether to mentally prepare
myself by blocking everything else out
of my mind or by just relaxing and
letting my mind wander. I think I went
the latter route, which is my natural
tendency anyway.
Weird games
As 1 drove to the test center Saturday
morning, my mind was playing weird
games with me. My mental state went
from one of total confidence (images of
the figure '650' flashed before my eyes)
to total insecurity ("I can't go through
with it.") to one of reserved confidence
("I'm no dumber than the next guy.").
Foremost in my mind was to avoid
getting so nervous that my perfor
mance would be affected. Hut I fully
realized this was the most important
test of my life.
As I took a place in line in front of the
lecture huil which would hold me cap
tive for the next four hours (going on
40), I knew I was in Los Angeles. I saw
plenty of examples of the stereotypical
LA. male — wavy hair combed back,
sunglasses atop the head and shirt
half-way unbuttoned.
To boost my confidence, I tried de
sperately to convince myself that all
the people around me were bumbling
idiots. 1 ended up taking the rational
approach instead: some of them were
smarter than me and some weren't.
Already in trouble
When 1 finally got inside the build
ing, I realized I was already in trouble.
Each of the persons sitting around me
had about a dozen shiny, new, im
maculate Ticonderoga pencils. I had
an assortment of stubby ones that I
scraped together at the last minute. I
did have one good pencil, but it was in
my back pocket when I took my seat,
and the damn thing nearly shattered.
1 had hoped that whoever adminis-

tered the test would be a compassion
ate soul who would try to make us feel
at ease. Maybe tell a joke or some com
forting lie like "It's not all that bad."
No such luck.
This guy was Mr. Serious, very stern
and business-like. He spoke asser
tively and said only what had to be
said, as if he were rationing words. He
also looked like George Kennedy —
white hair, tinted glasses, the works.
Once during the test 1 asked him to
write on the blackboard a little darker
than he had been. In not so many
words, he advised me to shut up and
sit down.
All things considered, I'd have
rather seen General Patton up there on
the stage.
Process begins
The pre-test administrative process
began and we put our names, addres
ses, etc. on the computerized answer
sheet. For security purposes, we were
asked to give a handwriting sample
and a fingerprint. 1 was waiting tor a
blood test and urinalysis.
Finally, the test began. 1 was a little
nervous at first, but a strong time pres
sure increased my concentration. In
that sense, the time factor was benefi
cial. In the sense that 1 didn't finish
several sections without guessing on a
few questions, it wasn't.
1 concentrated pretty well until
about a half an hour remained in the
three and one-half hour test. At that
point I mentally congratulated myself
for getting that far. 1 continued to func
tion for the last 30 minutes, but at
somewhat less than peak efficiency.
There were no howls of joy when the
test concluded. Some of the students'
comments were interesting, though.
"There's always business school."
"I'd say 460."
"Everybody was trying to act cool,
but you'd look around and see the ter
ror in their eyes."
One person was muttering some
thing about being "spaced out."
Personally, I don't have any idea
how I did. I went too fast to be sure of
anything, except that it was a tough
test.
Oh well. 1 didn't want to go to law
school anyway.

nervous at first, but a strong time pres
sure increased my concentration. In
that sense, the time factor was benefi
cial. In the sense that 1 didn't finish
several sections without guessing on a
few questions, it wasn't.
1 concentrated pretty well until
about a half an hour remained in the
three and one-half hour test. At that
point I mentally congratulated myself
for getting that far. 1 continued to func
tion for the last 30 minutes, but at
somewhat less than peak efficiency.
There were no howls of joy when the
test concluded. Some of the students'
comments were interesting, though.
"There's always business school."
"I'd say 460."
"Everybody was trying to act cool,
but you'd look around and see the ter
ror in their eyes."
One person was muttering some
thing about being "spaced out."
Personally, I don't have any idea
how I did. I went too fast to be sure of
anything, except that it was a tough
test.
Oh well. 1 didn't want to go to law
school anyway.

The only feeling I've ever had simi
lar to the one I experienced before and
during the Law School Admission
Test (LSAT) Saturday was that of
going to the dentist as a child to have
teeth pulled. In both cases, you know
the next few hours are going to be pure
agony. The only difference is that you
know you'll live through the LSAT. Of
course, while taking the test, you may
not care whether you do or not.
I was in Los Angeles for the
Stanford-UCLA football game last
weekend, so I took the LSAT at UCLA.
In the 24 hours prior to the test, I didn't
know whether to mentally prepare
myself by blocking everything else out
of my mind or by just relaxing and
letting my mind wander. I think I went
the latter route, which is my natural
tendency anyway.
Weird games
As 1 drove to the test center Saturday
morning, my mind was playing weird
games with me. My mental state went
from one of total confidence (images of
the figure '650' flashed before my eyes)
to total insecurity ("I can't go through
with it.") to one of reserved confidence
("I'm no dumber than the next guy.").
Foremost in my mind was to avoid
getting so nervous that my perfor
mance would be affected. Hut I fully
realized this was the most important
test of my life.
As I took a place in line in front of the
lecture huil which would hold me cap
tive for the next four hours (going on
40), I knew I was in Los Angeles. I saw
plenty of examples of the stereotypical
LA. male — wavy hair combed back,
sunglasses atop the head and shirt
half-way unbuttoned.
To boost my confidence, I tried de
sperately to convince myself that all
the people around me were bumbling
idiots. 1 ended up taking the rational
approach instead: some of them were
smarter than me and some weren't.
Already in trouble
When 1 finally got inside the build
ing, I realized I was already in trouble.
Each of the persons sitting around me
had about a dozen shiny, new, im
maculate Ticonderoga pencils. I had
an assortment of stubby ones that I
scraped together at the last minute. I
did have one good pencil, but it was in
my back pocket when I took my seat,
and the damn thing nearly shattered.
1 had hoped that whoever adminis-

tered the test would be a compassion
ate soul who would try to make us feel
at ease. Maybe tell a joke or some com
forting lie like "It's not all that bad."
No such luck.
This guy was Mr. Serious, very stern
and business-like. He spoke asser
tively and said only what had to be
said, as if he were rationing words. He
also looked like George Kennedy —
white hair, tinted glasses, the works.
Once during the test 1 asked him to
write on the blackboard a little darker
than he had been. In not so many
words, he advised me to shut up and
sit down.
All things considered, I'd have
rather seen General Patton up there on
the stage.
Process begins
The pre-test administrative process
began and we put our names, addres
ses, etc. on the computerized answer
sheet. For security purposes, we were
asked to give a handwriting sample
and a fingerprint. 1 was waiting tor a
blood test and urinalysis.
Finally, the test began. 1 was a little
nervous at first, but a strong time pres
sure increased my concentration. In
that sense, the time factor was benefi
cial. In the sense that 1 didn't finish

did have one good pencil, but it was in
my back pocket when I took my seat,
and the damn thing nearly shattered.

tered the test would be a compassion

at ease. Maybe tell a joke or some com

No such luck.
This guy was Mr. Serious, very stern
and business-like. He spoke asser
tively and said only what had to be
said, as if he were rationing words. He
also looked like George Kennedy —
white hair, tinted glasses, the works.
Once during the test 1 asked him to
write on the blackboard a little darker
than he had been. In not so many
words, he advised me to shut up and
sit down.
All things considered, I'd have
rather seen General Patton up there on
the stage.
Process begins
The pre-test administrative process
began and we put our names, addres
ses, etc. on the computerized answer
sheet. For security purposes, we were
asked to give a handwriting sample
and a fingerprint. 1 was waiting tor a
blood test and urinalysis.
Finally, the test began. 1 was a little
nervous at first, but a strong time pres
sure increased my concentration. In
that sense, the time factor was benefi
cial. In the sense that 1 didn't finish
several sections without guessing on a
few questions, it wasn't.
1 concentrated pretty well until
about a half an hour remained in the
three and one-half hour test. At that
point I mentally congratulated myself
for getting that far. 1 continued to func
tion for the last 30 minutes, but at
somewhat less than peak efficiency.
There were no howls of joy when the
test concluded. Some of the students'
comments were interesting, though.
"There's always business school."
"I'd say 460."
"Everybody was trying to act cool,
but you'd look around and see the ter
ror in their eyes."
One person was muttering some
thing about being "spaced out."
Personally, I don't have any idea
how I did. I went too fast to be sure of
anything, except that it was a tough
test.
Oh well. 1 didn't want to go to law
school anyway.

The only feeling I've ever had simi
lar to the one I experienced before and
during the Law School Admission
Test (LSAT) Saturday was that of
going to the dentist as a child to have
teeth pulled. In both cases, you know
the next few hours are going to be pure
agony. The only difference is that you
know you'll live through the LSAT. Of
course, while taking the test, you may
not care whether you do or not.
I was in Los Angeles for the
Stanford-UCLA football game last
weekend, so I took the LSAT at UCLA.
In the 24 hours prior to the test, I didn't
know whether to mentally prepare
myself by blocking everything else out
of my mind or by just relaxing and
letting my mind wander. I think I went
the latter route, which is my natural
tendency anyway.
Weird games
As 1 drove to the test center Saturday
morning, my mind was playing weird
games with me. My mental state went
from one of total confidence (images of
the figure '650' flashed before my eyes)
to total insecurity ("I can't go through
with it.") to one of reserved confidence
("I'm no dumber than the next guy.").
Foremost in my mind was to avoid
getting so nervous that my perfor
mance would be affected. Hut I fully
realized this was the most important
test of my life.
As I took a place in line in front of the
lecture huil which would hold me cap
tive for the next four hours (going on
40), I knew I was in Los Angeles. I saw
plenty of examples of the stereotypical
LA. male — wavy hair combed back,
sunglasses atop the head and shirt
half-way unbuttoned.
To boost my confidence, I tried de
sperately to convince myself that all
the people around me were bumbling
idiots. 1 ended up taking the rational
approach instead: some of them were
smarter than me and some weren't.
Already in trouble
When 1 finally got inside the build
ing, I realized I was already in trouble.
Each of the persons sitting around me
had about a dozen shiny, new, im
maculate Ticonderoga pencils. I had
an assortment of stubby ones that I
scraped together at the last minute. I
did have one good pencil, but it was in
my back pocket when I took my seat,
and the damn thing nearly shattered.
1 had hoped that whoever adminis-

tered the test would be a compassion
ate soul who would try to make us feel
at ease. Maybe tell a joke or some com
forting lie like "It's not all that bad."
