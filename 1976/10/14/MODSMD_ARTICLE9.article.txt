# Two bright moments in the campaign
## 
### 
In the past few days, both President
Cerald Ford and Jimmy Carter have
been reaping the benefit of their oppo
nent's mistakes. While refusing to dis
cuss the matter specifically, Ford has
gained by Carter's interview in
Playboy, while Carter has been con
centrating in speeches on Ford's
statement that eastern Europe is not
under Soviet domination.
Both Carter's interview and Ford's
debate assertion were politically
foolish. But the fact that they have
dealt such blows to the candidates says
more about the unwillingness of the
American people to face reality than
about the bumbling political style of
both major party nominees. In fact, the
acts which have been so troubling to
the candidates represent almost the
only bright spots in the presidential
campaign to date.
Carter's so-called "mistake" was
two-pronged. First, he has been chas
tised for consenting to an interview
with a magazine sporting photos of
nude and semi-nude women in vari
ous titillating positions. This is be
cause, as one congressman has said,
"he shouldn't be trying to appeal to the
kind of people who read girlie
magazines."
The theory that presidential candi
dates, and presumably incumbent
presidents as well, should exclude
from the political forum all publica
tions which reflect literary tastes diffe
rent from those of the candidates, is
preposterous. This is especially true in
light of Playboy interviews of William
Buckley, Gov. Edmund Brown, Jr.,
Eugene McCarthy and most of the
brightest stars in the artistic, intellec
tual and literary community.
Indeed, it is not too difficult to im
agine that the great majority of Carter's
critics, including the geriatric solon

quoted above, are occasional if not
avid readers of Playboy or its kinkier
rivals.
But for the sake of preserving a mid
dle class value system, politicians in
both parties and clergymen of various
faiths have found it necessary to ruffle
their feathers at Carter's choice of
media.
The other aspect of Carter's indiscre
tion was his admission that he has
committed adultery in his mind many
times and his use of the words "screw-

ing" and "shacking up." Those among
the super-moral community who did
not object to the admission found fault
in the language, and vice versa.
Again the popular response is an
unbelievably clear example of hypoc
risy. Not one of the leaders or "men on
the street" interviewed on the subject
said that he had never seen a woman for
whom he had desire irrespective of his
present ties.
As far as the language is concerned.
Carter as president would be given a
lily for cleanliness if "screwing" were
the most offensive word he could think
of. In comparison with the verbal
habits of a majority of chief executives
in this century, Carter sounds like a
Catholic grammar school boy taking
the Lord's name in vain lor the first
time. Lyndon Johnson would be
ashamed at his fellow Democrat's mel
low tongue.
Carter's crime, as he will attest, was
honesty. He was asked to talk to one of
the nation's leading magazines and he
consented. He was asked about his
feelings and he told the truth. But no
one wanted to hear. He was too much
like everyone else.
Ford's debate gaffe is harder to jus
tify. The common view is that the pres
ident. forced into defending the Hel

sinki agreement, let go with the asser
tion about eastern Europe and then -
found he couldn't take it back without i
looking like a fool. So he stuck by it
and looked like a fool.
There is undoubtedly some truth to
this. Regardless of whether Ford's
statement was true, he is enough of an
astute politician to realize that it
would not be received well by an audi
ence raised on appeals for Radio Free
Europe and guilt for the lack of Ameri
can response in the Hungary and
Czechoslovakian crises.
One wonders, however, how this no
tion got into Ford's head in the first
place. The answer lends some credibil
ity to Ford's statement and, in light of
the controversial nature of the state
ment, gives Ford points for realism
and courage.
First, one of the few intelligent
strategies of Ford's predecessor in the
White House was that of wooing
Polish, Romanian, Yugoslavian and
Bulgarian leaders by trade conces
sions, presidential visits, cultural ex
changes, etc.
This policy reflected the uncanny
insight that there really aren't Russian
soldiers stationed in the home of every
member of eastern Europe's com
munist parties, that the political and
military leaders of these nations are
nationalist communists, and that those
leaders are capable of straying from the
Moscow line in at least subtle ways.
Undoubtedly this strategy was in the
back of Ford's mind when he was
asked about the portion of the Helsinki
accord which, according to some
analysts, guarantees a Soviet sphere of
influence in eastern Europe. As Ford
pointed out. there have been indica
tions since the beginning of the Nixon
administration that Poland and
Romania are showing greater inde
pendence from the Soviet Union.
Yugoslavia, of course, has been a
maverick in communist Europe for 30
years.
In light of the 1968 Soviet invasion
of Czechoslovakia, Ford's general
statement on domination seems
ludicrous. But the specific examples
he used are considerably more justifi
able.

More importantly, Ford's response
was enlightening because he indi
rectly questioned tlie notion of domi
nance of one country over another. If
Poland is dominated by the Soviet Un
ion, is the United Kingdom under the
sway of the United States? Or, more
obviously, is West Germany or Iran?
All three of these nations have close
economic military and political ties to
the United States. All have American
troops stationed within their borders.
All either receive or have received
military and economic aid from the
United States. None has a foreign pol
icy significantly divergent from our
own. What are the characteristics of
servility which make eastern Europe
so different?
An even better example is Japan. Not
only does it have close ties with the
United States: its Mac Arthur-authored
constitution prohibits it from main
taining military forces beyond a token
self-defense force. Combined with the
"nuclear umbrella" treaties with the
United States, Japan is completely de
pendent on U.S. will in the case of
attack. At least Poland has its own
army.
The only significant diversion from
American foreign policy by these na
tions has been their recognition of the
People's Republic of China. Even this,
however, came only after Nixon an
nounced his visit there.
So Ford's gaffe was, again, too hon
est. Eastern Europe is not under the
domination of the Soviet Union by any
definition which excludes western
Europe and Japan from U.S. domina
tion. But Americans believe what they
want to believe, and Carter is capitaliz
ing on this, especially among ethnic
white voters who cannot comprehend
the idea that their ancestors' countries
could produce communists.
Yes, there have been a few bright
spots in this year's campaign, but they
have been dulled by the response of a
populace which shrinks from the real
ity of their own lives and world poli
tics.

present ties.
As far as the language is concerned.
Carter as president would be given a
lily for cleanliness if "screwing" were
the most offensive word he could think
of. In comparison with the verbal
habits of a majority of chief executives
in this century, Carter sounds like a
Catholic grammar school boy taking
the Lord's name in vain lor the first
time. Lyndon Johnson would be
ashamed at his fellow Democrat's mel
low tongue.
Carter's crime, as he will attest, was
honesty. He was asked to talk to one of
the nation's leading magazines and he
consented. He was asked about his
feelings and he told the truth. But no
one wanted to hear. He was too much
like everyone else.
Ford's debate gaffe is harder to jus
tify. The common view is that the pres
ident. forced into defending the Hel

sinki agreement, let go with the asser
tion about eastern Europe and then -
found he couldn't take it back without i
looking like a fool. So he stuck by it
and looked like a fool.
There is undoubtedly some truth to
this. Regardless of whether Ford's
statement was true, he is enough of an
astute politician to realize that it
would not be received well by an audi
ence raised on appeals for Radio Free
Europe and guilt for the lack of Ameri
can response in the Hungary and
Czechoslovakian crises.
One wonders, however, how this no
tion got into Ford's head in the first
place. The answer lends some credibil
ity to Ford's statement and, in light of
the controversial nature of the state
ment, gives Ford points for realism
and courage.
First, one of the few intelligent
strategies of Ford's predecessor in the
White House was that of wooing
Polish, Romanian, Yugoslavian and
Bulgarian leaders by trade conces
sions, presidential visits, cultural ex
changes, etc.
This policy reflected the uncanny
insight that there really aren't Russian
soldiers stationed in the home of every
member of eastern Europe's com
munist parties, that the political and
military leaders of these nations are
nationalist communists, and that those
leaders are capable of straying from the
Moscow line in at least subtle ways.
Undoubtedly this strategy was in the
back of Ford's mind when he was
asked about the portion of the Helsinki
accord which, according to some
analysts, guarantees a Soviet sphere of
influence in eastern Europe. As Ford
pointed out. there have been indica
tions since the beginning of the Nixon
administration that Poland and
Romania are showing greater inde
pendence from the Soviet Union.
Yugoslavia, of course, has been a
maverick in communist Europe for 30
years.
In light of the 1968 Soviet invasion
of Czechoslovakia, Ford's general
statement on domination seems
ludicrous. But the specific examples
he used are considerably more justifi
able.

More importantly, Ford's response
was enlightening because he indi
rectly questioned tlie notion of domi
nance of one country over another. If
Poland is dominated by the Soviet Un
ion, is the United Kingdom under the
sway of the United States? Or, more
obviously, is West Germany or Iran?
All three of these nations have close
economic military and political ties to
the United States. All have American
troops stationed within their borders.
All either receive or have received
military and economic aid from the
United States. None has a foreign pol
icy significantly divergent from our
own. What are the characteristics of
servility which make eastern Europe
so different?
An even better example is Japan. Not
only does it have close ties with the
United States: its Mac Arthur-authored
constitution prohibits it from main
taining military forces beyond a token
self-defense force. Combined with the
"nuclear umbrella" treaties with the
United States, Japan is completely de
pendent on U.S. will in the case of
attack. At least Poland has its own
army.
The only significant diversion from
American foreign policy by these na
tions has been their recognition of the
People's Republic of China. Even this,
however, came only after Nixon an
nounced his visit there.
So Ford's gaffe was, again, too hon
est. Eastern Europe is not under the
domination of the Soviet Union by any
definition which excludes western
Europe and Japan from U.S. domina
tion. But Americans believe what they
want to believe, and Carter is capitaliz
ing on this, especially among ethnic
white voters who cannot comprehend
the idea that their ancestors' countries
could produce communists.
Yes, there have been a few bright
spots in this year's campaign, but they
have been dulled by the response of a
populace which shrinks from the real
ity of their own lives and world poli
tics.

In the past few days, both President
Cerald Ford and Jimmy Carter have
been reaping the benefit of their oppo
nent's mistakes. While refusing to dis
cuss the matter specifically, Ford has
gained by Carter's interview in
Playboy, while Carter has been con
centrating in speeches on Ford's
statement that eastern Europe is not
under Soviet domination.
Both Carter's interview and Ford's
debate assertion were politically
foolish. But the fact that they have
dealt such blows to the candidates says
more about the unwillingness of the
American people to face reality than
about the bumbling political style of
both major party nominees. In fact, the
acts which have been so troubling to
the candidates represent almost the
only bright spots in the presidential
campaign to date.
Carter's so-called "mistake" was
two-pronged. First, he has been chas
tised for consenting to an interview
with a magazine sporting photos of
nude and semi-nude women in vari
ous titillating positions. This is be
cause, as one congressman has said,
"he shouldn't be trying to appeal to the
kind of people who read girlie
magazines."
The theory that presidential candi
dates, and presumably incumbent
presidents as well, should exclude
from the political forum all publica
tions which reflect literary tastes diffe
rent from those of the candidates, is
preposterous. This is especially true in
light of Playboy interviews of William
Buckley, Gov. Edmund Brown, Jr.,
Eugene McCarthy and most of the
brightest stars in the artistic, intellec
tual and literary community.
Indeed, it is not too difficult to im
agine that the great majority of Carter's
critics, including the geriatric solon

quoted above, are occasional if not
avid readers of Playboy or its kinkier
rivals.
But for the sake of preserving a mid
dle class value system, politicians in
both parties and clergymen of various
faiths have found it necessary to ruffle
their feathers at Carter's choice of
media.
The other aspect of Carter's indiscre
tion was his admission that he has
committed adultery in his mind many
times and his use of the words "screw-

ing" and "shacking up." Those among
the super-moral community who did
not object to the admission found fault
in the language, and vice versa.
Again the popular response is an
unbelievably clear example of hypoc
risy. Not one of the leaders or "men on
the street" interviewed on the subject
said that he had never seen a woman for
whom he had desire irrespective of his
present ties.
As far as the language is concerned.

Romania are showing greater inde
pendence from the Soviet Union.
Yugoslavia, of course, has been a
maverick in communist Europe for 30
years.
In light of the 1968 Soviet invasion
of Czechoslovakia, Ford's general
statement on domination seems
ludicrous. But the specific examples
he used are considerably more justifi
able.

More importantly, Ford's response
was enlightening because he indi
rectly questioned tlie notion of domi
nance of one country over another. If
Poland is dominated by the Soviet Un
ion, is the United Kingdom under the
sway of the United States? Or, more
obviously, is West Germany or Iran?
All three of these nations have close
economic military and political ties to
the United States. All have American
troops stationed within their borders.
All either receive or have received
military and economic aid from the
United States. None has a foreign pol
icy significantly divergent from our
own. What are the characteristics of
servility which make eastern Europe
so different?
An even better example is Japan. Not
only does it have close ties with the
United States: its Mac Arthur-authored
constitution prohibits it from main
taining military forces beyond a token
self-defense force. Combined with the
"nuclear umbrella" treaties with the
United States, Japan is completely de
pendent on U.S. will in the case of
attack. At least Poland has its own
army.
The only significant diversion from
American foreign policy by these na
tions has been their recognition of the
People's Republic of China. Even this,
however, came only after Nixon an
nounced his visit there.
So Ford's gaffe was, again, too hon
est. Eastern Europe is not under the
domination of the Soviet Union by any
definition which excludes western
Europe and Japan from U.S. domina
tion. But Americans believe what they
want to believe, and Carter is capitaliz
ing on this, especially among ethnic
white voters who cannot comprehend
the idea that their ancestors' countries
could produce communists.
Yes, there have been a few bright
spots in this year's campaign, but they
have been dulled by the response of a
populace which shrinks from the real
ity of their own lives and world poli
tics.

In the past few days, both President
Cerald Ford and Jimmy Carter have
been reaping the benefit of their oppo
nent's mistakes. While refusing to dis
cuss the matter specifically, Ford has
gained by Carter's interview in
Playboy, while Carter has been con
centrating in speeches on Ford's
statement that eastern Europe is not
under Soviet domination.
Both Carter's interview and Ford's
debate assertion were politically
foolish. But the fact that they have
dealt such blows to the candidates says
more about the unwillingness of the
American people to face reality than
about the bumbling political style of
both major party nominees. In fact, the
acts which have been so troubling to
the candidates represent almost the
only bright spots in the presidential
campaign to date.
Carter's so-called "mistake" was
two-pronged. First, he has been chas
tised for consenting to an interview
with a magazine sporting photos of
nude and semi-nude women in vari
ous titillating positions. This is be
cause, as one congressman has said,
"he shouldn't be trying to appeal to the
kind of people who read girlie
magazines."
The theory that presidential candi
dates, and presumably incumbent
presidents as well, should exclude
from the political forum all publica
tions which reflect literary tastes diffe
rent from those of the candidates, is
preposterous. This is especially true in
light of Playboy interviews of William
Buckley, Gov. Edmund Brown, Jr.,
Eugene McCarthy and most of the
brightest stars in the artistic, intellec
tual and literary community.
Indeed, it is not too difficult to im
agine that the great majority of Carter's
critics, including the geriatric solon

quoted above, are occasional if not
avid readers of Playboy or its kinkier
rivals.
But for the sake of preserving a mid
dle class value system, politicians in
both parties and clergymen of various
faiths have found it necessary to ruffle
their feathers at Carter's choice of
media.
The other aspect of Carter's indiscre
tion was his admission that he has
committed adultery in his mind many
times and his use of the words "screw-

ing" and "shacking up." Those among
the super-moral community who did
not object to the admission found fault
in the language, and vice versa.
Again the popular response is an
unbelievably clear example of hypoc
risy. Not one of the leaders or "men on
the street" interviewed on the subject
said that he had never seen a woman for
whom he had desire irrespective of his
present ties.
As far as the language is concerned.
Carter as president would be given a
lily for cleanliness if "screwing" were
the most offensive word he could think
of. In comparison with the verbal
habits of a majority of chief executives
in this century, Carter sounds like a
Catholic grammar school boy taking
the Lord's name in vain lor the first
time. Lyndon Johnson would be
ashamed at his fellow Democrat's mel
low tongue.
Carter's crime, as he will attest, was
honesty. He was asked to talk to one of
the nation's leading magazines and he
consented. He was asked about his
feelings and he told the truth. But no
one wanted to hear. He was too much
like everyone else.
Ford's debate gaffe is harder to jus
tify. The common view is that the pres
ident. forced into defending the Hel

sinki agreement, let go with the asser
tion about eastern Europe and then -
found he couldn't take it back without i
looking like a fool. So he stuck by it
and looked like a fool.
There is undoubtedly some truth to
this. Regardless of whether Ford's
statement was true, he is enough of an
astute politician to realize that it
would not be received well by an audi
ence raised on appeals for Radio Free
Europe and guilt for the lack of Ameri
can response in the Hungary and
Czechoslovakian crises.
One wonders, however, how this no
tion got into Ford's head in the first
place. The answer lends some credibil
ity to Ford's statement and, in light of
the controversial nature of the state
ment, gives Ford points for realism
and courage.
First, one of the few intelligent
strategies of Ford's predecessor in the
White House was that of wooing
Polish, Romanian, Yugoslavian and
Bulgarian leaders by trade conces
sions, presidential visits, cultural ex
changes, etc.
This policy reflected the uncanny
insight that there really aren't Russian
soldiers stationed in the home of every
member of eastern Europe's com
munist parties, that the political and
military leaders of these nations are
nationalist communists, and that those
leaders are capable of straying from the
Moscow line in at least subtle ways.
Undoubtedly this strategy was in the
back of Ford's mind when he was
asked about the portion of the Helsinki
accord which, according to some
analysts, guarantees a Soviet sphere of
influence in eastern Europe. As Ford
pointed out. there have been indica
tions since the beginning of the Nixon
administration that Poland and
Romania are showing greater inde
pendence from the Soviet Union.
Yugoslavia, of course, has been a
maverick in communist Europe for 30
years.

cuss the matter specifically, Ford has
gained by Carter's interview in
Playboy, while Carter has been con
centrating in speeches on Ford's
statement that eastern Europe is not
under Soviet domination.
Both Carter's interview and Ford's
debate assertion were politically
foolish. But the fact that they have
dealt such blows to the candidates says
more about the unwillingness of the
American people to face reality than
about the bumbling political style of
both major party nominees. In fact, the
acts which have been so troubling to
the candidates represent almost the
only bright spots in the presidential
campaign to date.
Carter's so-called "mistake" was
two-pronged. First, he has been chas
tised for consenting to an interview
with a magazine sporting photos of
nude and semi-nude women in vari
ous titillating positions. This is be
cause, as one congressman has said,
"he shouldn't be trying to appeal to the
kind of people who read girlie
magazines."
The theory that presidential candi
dates, and presumably incumbent
presidents as well, should exclude
from the political forum all publica
tions which reflect literary tastes diffe
rent from those of the candidates, is
preposterous. This is especially true in
light of Playboy interviews of William
Buckley, Gov. Edmund Brown, Jr.,
Eugene McCarthy and most of the
brightest stars in the artistic, intellec
tual and literary community.
Indeed, it is not too difficult to im
agine that the great majority of Carter's
critics, including the geriatric solon

quoted above, are occasional if not
avid readers of Playboy or its kinkier
rivals.
But for the sake of preserving a mid
dle class value system, politicians in
both parties and clergymen of various
faiths have found it necessary to ruffle
their feathers at Carter's choice of
media.
The other aspect of Carter's indiscre
tion was his admission that he has
committed adultery in his mind many
times and his use of the words "screw-

ing" and "shacking up." Those among
the super-moral community who did
not object to the admission found fault
in the language, and vice versa.
Again the popular response is an
unbelievably clear example of hypoc
risy. Not one of the leaders or "men on
the street" interviewed on the subject
said that he had never seen a woman for
whom he had desire irrespective of his
present ties.
As far as the language is concerned.
Carter as president would be given a
lily for cleanliness if "screwing" were
the most offensive word he could think
of. In comparison with the verbal
habits of a majority of chief executives
in this century, Carter sounds like a
Catholic grammar school boy taking
the Lord's name in vain lor the first
time. Lyndon Johnson would be
ashamed at his fellow Democrat's mel
low tongue.
Carter's crime, as he will attest, was
honesty. He was asked to talk to one of
the nation's leading magazines and he
consented. He was asked about his
feelings and he told the truth. But no
one wanted to hear. He was too much
like everyone else.
Ford's debate gaffe is harder to jus
tify. The common view is that the pres
ident. forced into defending the Hel

sinki agreement, let go with the asser
tion about eastern Europe and then -
found he couldn't take it back without i
looking like a fool. So he stuck by it
and looked like a fool.
There is undoubtedly some truth to
this. Regardless of whether Ford's
statement was true, he is enough of an
astute politician to realize that it
would not be received well by an audi
ence raised on appeals for Radio Free
Europe and guilt for the lack of Ameri
can response in the Hungary and
Czechoslovakian crises.
One wonders, however, how this no
tion got into Ford's head in the first
place. The answer lends some credibil
ity to Ford's statement and, in light of
the controversial nature of the state
ment, gives Ford points for realism
and courage.
First, one of the few intelligent
strategies of Ford's predecessor in the
White House was that of wooing
Polish, Romanian, Yugoslavian and
Bulgarian leaders by trade conces
sions, presidential visits, cultural ex
changes, etc.
This policy reflected the uncanny
insight that there really aren't Russian
soldiers stationed in the home of every
member of eastern Europe's com
munist parties, that the political and
military leaders of these nations are
nationalist communists, and that those
leaders are capable of straying from the
Moscow line in at least subtle ways.
Undoubtedly this strategy was in the
back of Ford's mind when he was
asked about the portion of the Helsinki
accord which, according to some
analysts, guarantees a Soviet sphere of
influence in eastern Europe. As Ford
pointed out. there have been indica
tions since the beginning of the Nixon
administration that Poland and
Romania are showing greater inde
pendence from the Soviet Union.
Yugoslavia, of course, has been a
maverick in communist Europe for 30
years.
In light of the 1968 Soviet invasion
of Czechoslovakia, Ford's general
statement on domination seems
ludicrous. But the specific examples
he used are considerably more justifi
able.

More importantly, Ford's response
was enlightening because he indi
rectly questioned tlie notion of domi
nance of one country over another. If
Poland is dominated by the Soviet Un
ion, is the United Kingdom under the
sway of the United States? Or, more
obviously, is West Germany or Iran?
All three of these nations have close
economic military and political ties to
the United States. All have American
troops stationed within their borders.
All either receive or have received
military and economic aid from the
United States. None has a foreign pol
icy significantly divergent from our
own. What are the characteristics of
servility which make eastern Europe
so different?
An even better example is Japan. Not
only does it have close ties with the
United States: its Mac Arthur-authored
constitution prohibits it from main
taining military forces beyond a token
self-defense force. Combined with the
"nuclear umbrella" treaties with the
United States, Japan is completely de
pendent on U.S. will in the case of
attack. At least Poland has its own
army.
The only significant diversion from
American foreign policy by these na
tions has been their recognition of the
People's Republic of China. Even this,
however, came only after Nixon an
nounced his visit there.
So Ford's gaffe was, again, too hon
est. Eastern Europe is not under the
domination of the Soviet Union by any
definition which excludes western
Europe and Japan from U.S. domina
tion. But Americans believe what they
want to believe, and Carter is capitaliz
ing on this, especially among ethnic
white voters who cannot comprehend
the idea that their ancestors' countries
could produce communists.
Yes, there have been a few bright
spots in this year's campaign, but they
have been dulled by the response of a
populace which shrinks from the real
ity of their own lives and world poli
tics.
