# Pamphlet issue heats up McCloskey-Harris debate
## 
### Mark Funk 
A sharp exchange on the contents of a campaign pam
phiet overshadowed the chosen topic for last night's
debate between Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr. and Democ
ratic challenger David Harris.
An overflow crowd in Kresge Auditorium heard the
candidates for the 12th congressional seat veer from a
discussion on governmental reform toward McCloskey's
voting record.
After opening remarks by Harris and McCloskey, the
Republican incumbent launched into an attack on a
pamphlet put out by the Harris campaign. McCloskey
said the pamphlet, entitled "You be the Judge," pre
sented an inaccurate picture of his congressional voting
record.
Objecting to a passage in the brochure which said he
voted with President Cerald Ford more times than con
servative California Rep. Barry Coldwater Jr., McCloskey
listed some items he said were in error.
McCloskey disputed one point which criticized his
environmental record and which said he lost the en
dorsement of the League of Conservation Voters (LCV).
McCloskey said the environmental group has now en
dorsed him.
Harris responded by pointing out the LCV endorse
ment did not come until early this week, after the pam
phlet had been published. The former Stanford student
body president admitted, however, that there was one
error in the brochure.
The error was in an attack on McCloskey's voting
record on legislation concerning the elderly.
McCloskey defended his votes and said the pamphlet

used a figure from the National Alliance of Senior Citi
zens (NASC) which said he voted "wrong BO per cent of
the time on key votes effecting the elderly."
Linking the organization to the John Birch Society,
McCloskey said the NASC was "out to discredit liberal
congressmen." He pointed to a rating of 69 per cent
given him by the moderate National Council of Senior
Citizens.
Harris opened the debate by proposing a negative in
come tax and generally striking out at expanding gov
ernment.
He criticized government over-regulation and
suggested that Congress limit terms to eight years while
rotating committee chairrnenships.
Harris urged the repeal of the National Security Act ot
1947 which created the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) and recommended its replacement with legisla
tion which would prohibit the United States from inter
fering in the affairs of foreign countries.
McCloskey invoked the names of former congressmen
Wilbur Mills, Wayne Hays and former Speaker of the
House Carl Albert in calling for an end to the seniority
system in Congress.
He attacked Harris for supporting the right of public
workers to strike. McCloskey said public workers were
not striking against corporations but "against the tax
payers."
McCloskey also pointed to bills he introduced in the
House limiting the powers of the CIA and condemning
the bombing of Cambodia in 1970.
