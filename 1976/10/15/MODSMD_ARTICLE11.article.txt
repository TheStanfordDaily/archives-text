# Letters: Senate race

### 
Senate election
1 was appalled and disappointed by
the lack of taste exhibited by your
handling of the ASSII Senatorial cam
paign statements.
To think that the; Daily would make
45 modifications of a single policy
statement and attach to them the
names of the creative, diverse and
public-spirited slates sickens me to the
very core of my noble being.
Please cancel my subscription to
your inane rag at once.

There must be a better way!
ASSU Senate election time is here
and 1 still do not feel that 1 knov
enough about the eighty-odd candi
dates to make an informed, intelligen
choice at the polls. The many poster;
and handouts are just too brief to be o
any value.
Perhaps one or two evenings prior t<
each election could feature short pub
lie appearances by each candidate whe
was willing to address the studen
body. Maybe then people would hi
truly informed.
