# Frosh, upperclass: the Great Divide
## 
### 
Any astute observer of university
life will notice that college students
invariably come in two types:
freshmen and upperclassmen. At the
beginning of a school year, the differ
ences are even more pronounced bet
ween the two groups.
Freshmen come with well-scrubbed
complexions, their wide little eyes
awed by everything. They gaze out on
a sunlit horizon, with myriads of op
portunities and adventures beckoning
at their august university. The world is
theirs to conquer.
Upperclassmen, with their sadder
but-wiser air. know that image of Stan
ford exists only on postcards at the
Bookstore. The upperclassmen see the
naive freshmen as innocent lambs and,

as we all know, lambs are made to be
led to slaughter, or at least to have the
wool shorn from their eyes.
An amazing irony can be seen in
how students react to their first and
last experiences with college. As high
school seniors, many would excitedly
rip open their letter from our admis
sions department and then leap for joy
that they had been accepted.
A mere four years later, these same
students will rip their diplomas out of
the hands of the school president and
the leap for joy that they are now
finished with the place. An amazing
irony, indeed.
Other differences
But there are other differences bet
ween the lowly freshman and the

exalted upperclassman. The young
"freshies" are almost always away
from home, friends and familiarity for
the first time in their lives. By neces
sity, they are more open to meeting
new people. But this gregariousness is
not tempered with wisdom.
Note how differently the two groups
handle the situation of meeting new
people.

First, the upperclassman: "Hi. What
year are you here?"
Stranger: "I'm a junior."
Now the freshman: "Hi. Are you a
freshman?"
Stranger (who happens to be a
senior): "Want a slug in the mouth,
kid?"
Let us not make the conclusion that
upperclassmen are inherently dour
and unfriendly. True, they do have
their friends already made, but this
does not prevent them from meeting
new people. For example, male up
perclassmen invariably go out of their
ways to meet freshman girls, espe
cially the ones with nice personalities.
Freshmen are also noticeable by
their lack of familiarity with the Stan
ford "lingo." Few can understand the
meaning of, "I'm taking a Poli Sci mick
sponsored by SWOPSI at Mem Aud,
but I havea class right before in Dink,"
without consulting a dictionary. Only
freshmen would think that Mem Chu
is a spittin' tobacco: or that Hoo Tow is

some sort of Chinese cuisine, or that
the Golden Spike is a pint of Southern
Comfort in a quart of lemonade.
Different views
But the basic difference between the
two groups ultimately comes down to
how each group views the university.
The freshmen envision students
lounging beneath ivy-covered walls,
sipping dry California sherry and lis
tening to professors expound on great
eternal truths. The freshmen see the
place as a venerable institute of higher
learning; the Harvard ot the West.
The jaded upperclassmen, realizing
that professors rarely expound be>-
neath the nonexistent ivy-covered
walls, view Stanford as a prestigious
name on a diploma that will help get
them into grad school or land a good
job, if it doesn't bankrupt them first.
Instead of dry California sherry, they
get warm Coors beer. Instead of profes
sors' informal dissertations, they get
ASSU lecture notes. And instead of the
Harvard ofthe West, they see it more as
the San Jose State of the North.
Hut this is not the end ofthe story.
Something amazing happens to each
graduate sooner or later in his trek
through life. Maybe one evening, a few
years after graduation, the grad (for
merly freshman and formerly an up
perclassman) starts to recall his days in
school.
Gone are the bitter memories and
sour experiences. The grad cogitates
on every good time ever had at school,
each one being prefaced by a "re
member when?" This exercise soon
whips the grad into ecstatic zeal so that
he shouts out, "Oh, if only 1 could be
back at Stanford!" The cycle is com
plete.

students will rip their diplomas out of
the hands of the school president and
the leap for joy that they are now
finished with the place. An amazing
irony, indeed.
Other differences
But there are other differences bet
ween the lowly freshman and the

exalted upperclassman. The young
"freshies" are almost always away
from home, friends and familiarity for
the first time in their lives. By neces
sity, they are more open to meeting
new people. But this gregariousness is
not tempered with wisdom.
Note how differently the two groups
handle the situation of meeting new
people.

First, the upperclassman: "Hi. What
year are you here?"
Stranger: "I'm a junior."
Now the freshman: "Hi. Are you a
freshman?"
Stranger (who happens to be a
senior): "Want a slug in the mouth,
kid?"
Let us not make the conclusion that
upperclassmen are inherently dour
and unfriendly. True, they do have
their friends already made, but this
does not prevent them from meeting
new people. For example, male up
perclassmen invariably go out of their
ways to meet freshman girls, espe
cially the ones with nice personalities.
Freshmen are also noticeable by
their lack of familiarity with the Stan
ford "lingo." Few can understand the
meaning of, "I'm taking a Poli Sci mick
sponsored by SWOPSI at Mem Aud,
but I havea class right before in Dink,"
without consulting a dictionary. Only
freshmen would think that Mem Chu
is a spittin' tobacco: or that Hoo Tow is

some sort of Chinese cuisine, or that
the Golden Spike is a pint of Southern
Comfort in a quart of lemonade.
Different views
But the basic difference between the
two groups ultimately comes down to
how each group views the university.
The freshmen envision students
lounging beneath ivy-covered walls,
sipping dry California sherry and lis
tening to professors expound on great
eternal truths. The freshmen see the
place as a venerable institute of higher
learning; the Harvard ot the West.
The jaded upperclassmen, realizing
that professors rarely expound be>-
neath the nonexistent ivy-covered
walls, view Stanford as a prestigious
name on a diploma that will help get
them into grad school or land a good
job, if it doesn't bankrupt them first.
Instead of dry California sherry, they
get warm Coors beer. Instead of profes
sors' informal dissertations, they get
ASSU lecture notes. And instead of the
Harvard ofthe West, they see it more as
the San Jose State of the North.
Hut this is not the end ofthe story.
Something amazing happens to each
graduate sooner or later in his trek
through life. Maybe one evening, a few
years after graduation, the grad (for
merly freshman and formerly an up
perclassman) starts to recall his days in
school.
Gone are the bitter memories and
sour experiences. The grad cogitates
on every good time ever had at school,
each one being prefaced by a "re
member when?" This exercise soon
whips the grad into ecstatic zeal so that
he shouts out, "Oh, if only 1 could be
back at Stanford!" The cycle is com
plete.

Any astute observer of university
life will notice that college students
invariably come in two types:
freshmen and upperclassmen. At the
beginning of a school year, the differ
ences are even more pronounced bet
ween the two groups.
Freshmen come with well-scrubbed
complexions, their wide little eyes
awed by everything. They gaze out on
a sunlit horizon, with myriads of op
portunities and adventures beckoning
at their august university. The world is
theirs to conquer.
Upperclassmen, with their sadder
but-wiser air. know that image of Stan
ford exists only on postcards at the
Bookstore. The upperclassmen see the
naive freshmen as innocent lambs and,

as we all know, lambs are made to be
led to slaughter, or at least to have the
wool shorn from their eyes.
An amazing irony can be seen in
how students react to their first and
last experiences with college. As high
school seniors, many would excitedly
rip open their letter from our admis
sions department and then leap for joy
that they had been accepted.
A mere four years later, these same
students will rip their diplomas out of
the hands of the school president and

ways to meet freshman girls, espe
cially the ones with nice personalities.
Freshmen are also noticeable by
their lack of familiarity with the Stan
ford "lingo." Few can understand the
meaning of, "I'm taking a Poli Sci mick
sponsored by SWOPSI at Mem Aud,
but I havea class right before in Dink,"
without consulting a dictionary. Only
freshmen would think that Mem Chu
is a spittin' tobacco: or that Hoo Tow is

some sort of Chinese cuisine, or that
the Golden Spike is a pint of Southern
Comfort in a quart of lemonade.
Different views
But the basic difference between the
two groups ultimately comes down to
how each group views the university.
The freshmen envision students
lounging beneath ivy-covered walls,
sipping dry California sherry and lis
tening to professors expound on great
eternal truths. The freshmen see the
place as a venerable institute of higher
learning; the Harvard ot the West.
The jaded upperclassmen, realizing
that professors rarely expound be>-
neath the nonexistent ivy-covered
walls, view Stanford as a prestigious
name on a diploma that will help get
them into grad school or land a good
job, if it doesn't bankrupt them first.
Instead of dry California sherry, they
get warm Coors beer. Instead of profes
sors' informal dissertations, they get
ASSU lecture notes. And instead of the
Harvard ofthe West, they see it more as
the San Jose State of the North.
Hut this is not the end ofthe story.
Something amazing happens to each
graduate sooner or later in his trek
through life. Maybe one evening, a few
years after graduation, the grad (for
merly freshman and formerly an up
perclassman) starts to recall his days in
school.
Gone are the bitter memories and
sour experiences. The grad cogitates
on every good time ever had at school,
each one being prefaced by a "re
member when?" This exercise soon
whips the grad into ecstatic zeal so that
he shouts out, "Oh, if only 1 could be
back at Stanford!" The cycle is com
plete.
The freshman reborn.
