This fall quarter might go clown in
the annals of Stanford University as
the renaissance of undergraduate edu
cation.
There is little doubt among those
close to the university that the quality
of undergraduate education has
eroded these past few years. Faced
with budget cuts in key programs, in
creased emphasis on professorial re
search. the exit of our finest professors,
and the failure of administrators to
award tenure honors to under
graduates' most qualified and exciting
instructors, the university's preemi
nence as an institution of higher learn
ing is now questionable.
All is not gloomy, however, for this
fall quarter affords us with the unique
opportunity of reversing this trend.
The savior is residential education, a
concept that brings learning out of the
classroom and into campus living
rooms.
Begining this quarter, residential
education will get its first real test in
the American Studies house. The
specific intellectual focus is politics,
a theme that will be reinforced with a
SWOPSI course on the presidential

race, sherry hours, receptions,
Lincoln/Douglass Debates, seminars
and a lecture series.
This program is designed to encour
age interaction between students and
faculty, and students themselves. It
will include professors respected for
their quality of undergraduate teach
ing. as well as numerous elected offi
cials and political experts from the Bay
Area.
The success of the American Studies
program will not only enhance the
learning opportunities of this univer
sity. but will also provide greater con
tinuity between housing policy and
in-house learning.
Your support is needed to convince
administration officials that under
graduates are tired of being
shortchanged. We must join together
in the further improvement of our
program for the benefit of the entire
Stanford community.
