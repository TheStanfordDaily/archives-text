# P.A. lab analyzes street drugs for quality
## 
### Robert Lempert 
Drugs bought on the streets,
from marijuana to LSD. do not
always contain what the local
pusher says they do. In fact, "ab
out fifty per cent of the time
people aren't taking what they
think they are taking," says Bob
Fogerson, one of the small team
of drug experts at Analysis
Anonymous.
The organization, a non-profit
foundation connected with
Pharchem Research Foundation,
runs a chemical laboratory in
Fast Palo Alto. The lab analyzes
samples of drugs mailed to them
by drug users who want to know
what they're taking.
To have a sample analyzed, a
person mails one dose of the
drug to the lab with a $5 fee and a
five digit code number which he
makes up. The drug is usually
analyzed the day it reaches the
lab. The sender calls in a few

days later, identifies his sample
with the code number and re
ceives a report of the substances
found in the drug.
The sender is never identified
and, therefore, remains free from
legal recrimination. Some cus
tomers cautiously call from a pay
phone, while others are carefree
enough to deliver their samples
in person, Fogerson said.
The lab prefers, but does not
demand, information regarding
where and when the drug was
purchased. Once a week,
Analysis Anonymous compiles
a list of all samples received that
week, which drug the senders
thought they were and what
chemicals they actually con
tained.
List publicized
The list is mailed to Bay Area
radio stations and newspapers,
which notify the public so users
can discover if there are any bad
drugs in the area. If the lab de
tects something toxic in a sam
r pie, the alarm goes out im
mediately and is broadcast
hroughout the area from which
(he drug came.
The drug samples are sent
from around the country. While
the majority of them are from in
dividuals, a large number come
from clinics and other medical
establishments. A state-run or
ganization in Oregon, the Drug
Information Center, collects
drugs in Oregon in a process
similar to the one followed by
Analysis Anonymous.
It mails the samples to Palo
Alto and pays for the analysis.
Several Oregon radio stations
are equipped to notify the public
if toxins are detected in the
drugs.
Foreign drugs
The lab also receives samples
from exotic areas. People who

visit foreign doctors to receive
strong arthritic medicine unav
ailable in the United States
often send a sample to Analysis
Anonymous for detection of
steroid.
A large percentage of the
medicine frequently contains
steroid, a drug which has harm
ful side effects if it is used over a
long period of time, Fogerson
said.
He said the lab has received
samples which are not drugs,
such as dog food, toothbrushes,
and tap water, all allegedly
poisoned.
The purpose of the lab. accord
ing to Forgenson, is to serve as a
research organization as well as
to help users directly. Police
analyze drugs found in large
shipments which they have in
tercepted. However, few labs
analyze drugs which have been
broken down to street level im
purity. The government also
does analytical work, but does
not release the results, as they

are used as evidence in court
trials.
Beside Analysis Anonymous,
the labs which do keep track of
the quality of illegal drugs being
sold on the street are located at
the University of the Pacific in
Stockton, in Los Angeles, in
Cleveland and in Miami.
The labs are analyzed for the
level of quality. The test only re
veals which substances are pre
sent in the sample. The federal
government has prohibited labs
from quantitative testing which
would determine how much of a
substance is present in the sam
ple.
Fogerson said the law was in
tended to prevent the lab from
becoming a quality control
board for pushers.
When the law went into effect
several years ago, it cut the vol
ume of drugs received at
Analysis Anonymous by about
50 per cent, Forgerson said. But
the number has steadily in
creased since then, he added, to

the present level of 200 to 250
samples per month.
Procedure
The drugs themselves are
analyzed by a procedure known
as thin layer chromatography.
When the sample reaches the lab,
it is dissolved in methanol, an
organic solvent. When it is com
pletely dissolved, drops of the
solution are placed at the bottom
of a glass plate coated with sili
con, which is then placed in
tanks with anothei solvent at the
bottom. This solvent travels up
the plates and, as it does, it car
ries the sample along with it.
Chemicals travel at different
speeds, causing the sample to
separate into its various compo
nents.
The components are spread
out in a column of little
splotches going up the plate. By
comparing the position of each
splotch in relation to sample
splotches from known drugs,
the lab technicians can tell
which drugs are present and
hence, what was in the sample.
Sometimes they cannot iden
tify all the component parts and
can only warn the user that his
drug contains an unknown
chemical.
The foundation is supported
by the $5 fee and subscriptions
for its monthly newsletter.
While the distribution of sam
ples is likely to be affected by the
fee, the lab probably receives a
higher proportion of bad drugs
than actually exists on the street,
Forgerson speculated.
He said it is estimated that a
majority of users do not really
know what they are taking. The
lab keeps in contact with medi
cal schools, hospitals and other
research organizations in
terested in the flow of drugs in
the United States.

from exotic areas. People who

visit foreign doctors to receive
strong arthritic medicine unav
ailable in the United States
often send a sample to Analysis
Anonymous for detection of
steroid.
A large percentage of the
medicine frequently contains
steroid, a drug which has harm
ful side effects if it is used over a
long period of time, Fogerson
said.
He said the lab has received
samples which are not drugs,
such as dog food, toothbrushes,
and tap water, all allegedly
poisoned.
The purpose of the lab. accord
ing to Forgenson, is to serve as a
research organization as well as
to help users directly. Police
analyze drugs found in large
shipments which they have in
tercepted. However, few labs
analyze drugs which have been
broken down to street level im
purity. The government also
does analytical work, but does
not release the results, as they

are used as evidence in court
trials.
Beside Analysis Anonymous,
the labs which do keep track of
the quality of illegal drugs being
sold on the street are located at
the University of the Pacific in
Stockton, in Los Angeles, in
Cleveland and in Miami.
The labs are analyzed for the
level of quality. The test only re
veals which substances are pre
sent in the sample. The federal
government has prohibited labs
from quantitative testing which
would determine how much of a
substance is present in the sam
ple.
Fogerson said the law was in
tended to prevent the lab from
becoming a quality control
board for pushers.
When the law went into effect
several years ago, it cut the vol
ume of drugs received at
Analysis Anonymous by about
50 per cent, Forgerson said. But
the number has steadily in
creased since then, he added, to

the present level of 200 to 250
samples per month.
Procedure
The drugs themselves are
analyzed by a procedure known
as thin layer chromatography.
When the sample reaches the lab,
it is dissolved in methanol, an
organic solvent. When it is com
pletely dissolved, drops of the
solution are placed at the bottom
of a glass plate coated with sili
con, which is then placed in
tanks with anothei solvent at the
bottom. This solvent travels up
the plates and, as it does, it car
ries the sample along with it.
Chemicals travel at different
speeds, causing the sample to
separate into its various compo
nents.
The components are spread
out in a column of little
splotches going up the plate. By
comparing the position of each
splotch in relation to sample
splotches from known drugs,
the lab technicians can tell
which drugs are present and
hence, what was in the sample.
Sometimes they cannot iden
tify all the component parts and
can only warn the user that his
drug contains an unknown
chemical.
The foundation is supported
by the $5 fee and subscriptions
for its monthly newsletter.
While the distribution of sam
ples is likely to be affected by the
fee, the lab probably receives a
higher proportion of bad drugs
than actually exists on the street,
Forgerson speculated.
He said it is estimated that a
majority of users do not really
know what they are taking. The
lab keeps in contact with medi
cal schools, hospitals and other
research organizations in
terested in the flow of drugs in
the United States.

Bob Fogerson, chemical expert at Analysis Anonymous,
examines drug sample to determine its actual contents.
Drugs bought on the streets,
from marijuana to LSD. do not
always contain what the local
pusher says they do. In fact, "ab
out fifty per cent of the time
people aren't taking what they
think they are taking," says Bob
Fogerson, one of the small team
of drug experts at Analysis
Anonymous.
The organization, a non-profit
foundation connected with
Pharchem Research Foundation,
runs a chemical laboratory in
Fast Palo Alto. The lab analyzes
samples of drugs mailed to them
by drug users who want to know
what they're taking.
To have a sample analyzed, a
person mails one dose of the
drug to the lab with a $5 fee and a
five digit code number which he
makes up. The drug is usually
analyzed the day it reaches the
lab. The sender calls in a few

days later, identifies his sample
with the code number and re
ceives a report of the substances
found in the drug.
The sender is never identified
and, therefore, remains free from
legal recrimination. Some cus
tomers cautiously call from a pay
phone, while others are carefree
enough to deliver their samples
in person, Fogerson said.
The lab prefers, but does not
demand, information regarding
where and when the drug was
purchased. Once a week,
Analysis Anonymous compiles
a list of all samples received that
week, which drug the senders
thought they were and what
chemicals they actually con
tained.
List publicized
The list is mailed to Bay Area
radio stations and newspapers,
which notify the public so users
can discover if there are any bad
drugs in the area. If the lab de
tects something toxic in a sam
r pie, the alarm goes out im
mediately and is broadcast
hroughout the area from which
(he drug came.
The drug samples are sent
from around the country. While
the majority of them are from in
dividuals, a large number come
from clinics and other medical
establishments. A state-run or
ganization in Oregon, the Drug
Information Center, collects
drugs in Oregon in a process
similar to the one followed by
Analysis Anonymous.
It mails the samples to Palo
Alto and pays for the analysis.

Bob Fogerson, chemical expert at Analysis Anonymous,
examines drug sample to determine its actual contents.
Drugs bought on the streets,
from marijuana to LSD. do not
always contain what the local
pusher says they do. In fact, "ab
out fifty per cent of the time
people aren't taking what they
think they are taking," says Bob
Fogerson, one of the small team
of drug experts at Analysis
Anonymous.
The organization, a non-profit
foundation connected with
Pharchem Research Foundation,
runs a chemical laboratory in
Fast Palo Alto. The lab analyzes
samples of drugs mailed to them
by drug users who want to know
what they're taking.
To have a sample analyzed, a
person mails one dose of the
drug to the lab with a $5 fee and a
five digit code number which he
makes up. The drug is usually
analyzed the day it reaches the
lab. The sender calls in a few

days later, identifies his sample
with the code number and re
ceives a report of the substances
found in the drug.
The sender is never identified
and, therefore, remains free from
legal recrimination. Some cus
tomers cautiously call from a pay
phone, while others are carefree
enough to deliver their samples
in person, Fogerson said.
The lab prefers, but does not
demand, information regarding
where and when the drug was
purchased. Once a week,
Analysis Anonymous compiles
a list of all samples received that
week, which drug the senders
thought they were and what
chemicals they actually con
tained.
List publicized
The list is mailed to Bay Area
radio stations and newspapers,
which notify the public so users
can discover if there are any bad
drugs in the area. If the lab de
tects something toxic in a sam
r pie, the alarm goes out im
mediately and is broadcast
hroughout the area from which
(he drug came.
The drug samples are sent
from around the country. While
the majority of them are from in
dividuals, a large number come
from clinics and other medical
establishments. A state-run or
ganization in Oregon, the Drug
Information Center, collects
drugs in Oregon in a process
similar to the one followed by
Analysis Anonymous.
It mails the samples to Palo
Alto and pays for the analysis.
Several Oregon radio stations
are equipped to notify the public
if toxins are detected in the
drugs.
Foreign drugs
The lab also receives samples
from exotic areas. People who

visit foreign doctors to receive
strong arthritic medicine unav
ailable in the United States
often send a sample to Analysis
Anonymous for detection of
steroid.
A large percentage of the
medicine frequently contains
steroid, a drug which has harm
ful side effects if it is used over a
long period of time, Fogerson
said.
He said the lab has received
samples which are not drugs,
such as dog food, toothbrushes,
and tap water, all allegedly
poisoned.
The purpose of the lab. accord
ing to Forgenson, is to serve as a
research organization as well as
to help users directly. Police
analyze drugs found in large
shipments which they have in
tercepted. However, few labs
analyze drugs which have been
broken down to street level im
purity. The government also
does analytical work, but does
not release the results, as they

are used as evidence in court
trials.
Beside Analysis Anonymous,
the labs which do keep track of
the quality of illegal drugs being
sold on the street are located at
the University of the Pacific in
Stockton, in Los Angeles, in
Cleveland and in Miami.
The labs are analyzed for the
level of quality. The test only re
veals which substances are pre
sent in the sample. The federal
government has prohibited labs
from quantitative testing which
would determine how much of a
substance is present in the sam
ple.
Fogerson said the law was in
tended to prevent the lab from
becoming a quality control
board for pushers.
When the law went into effect
several years ago, it cut the vol
ume of drugs received at
Analysis Anonymous by about
50 per cent, Forgerson said. But
the number has steadily in
creased since then, he added, to

the present level of 200 to 250
samples per month.
Procedure
The drugs themselves are
analyzed by a procedure known
as thin layer chromatography.
When the sample reaches the lab,
it is dissolved in methanol, an
organic solvent. When it is com
pletely dissolved, drops of the
solution are placed at the bottom
of a glass plate coated with sili
con, which is then placed in
tanks with anothei solvent at the
bottom. This solvent travels up
the plates and, as it does, it car
ries the sample along with it.
Chemicals travel at different
speeds, causing the sample to
separate into its various compo
nents.
The components are spread
out in a column of little
splotches going up the plate. By
