# Roadwork underway on Palm

Corrective road work will be
underway until early spring at
the intersection of Palm Drive
and El Camino Real, according
to Ted Noguchi, director of the
J'alo Alto services commission.
"The work will revise the
channels to correct poor geomet
ries and will also add traffic sig
nals to the intersection,"
Noguchi said.
The plan, being paid for by the
City of Palo Alto, is "predicated
on the traffic accident history at
the intersection."
Noguchi felt that the addition
of signals to the intersection
would prevent the same kinds of
accidents from occuring in the
future.
Noguchi stated that one lane
would be left open at all times
while construction is going on
so that traffic would not be
blocked. He said the changes
would substantially improve the
present traffic situation, includ
ing problems in bicycle travel.
"While the work won't resolve
all conflicts, it will remove some
uncertainties that presently exist
there and should make bicycle
riding as well as automobile traf
fic much safer," Noguchi said.
