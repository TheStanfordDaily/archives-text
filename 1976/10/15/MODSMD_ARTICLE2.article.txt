# Edwards sees civil liberties advancement
## 
### Cynthia Neil 
Representative Don Edwards (D
-10th) said in a speech last night at
Cubberley Auditorium that "although
there is a long road ahead." supporters
of civil liberties have made considera
ble strides in the past three years.
"These advances are a result of
Watergate and of efforts by groups
such as the ACLU," said Edwards, ad
dressing the annual meeting of the
Mid peninsula chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
Since 1940, there has been a massive
increase in FBI and CIA activity, ac
cording to Edwards.
"When I went to work, for the FBI in
1 ( )40. they had a total budget of $7
million. Today their budget is $500
million. There has been a correspond
ing increase in illegal and often crimi
nal assaults on our rights. This is oc
curing not only at the federal level, but
at the state and local levels of govern
ment as well," said Edwards. "It abso
lutely boggles my mind."
Edwards feels that intelligence ac
tivity should be governed by legisla
tive mandate, rather than by the whim
of the president, the attorney general,
or the director of a governmental
agency.
"The problem now," said Edwards,
"is that the Department of Justice is
attempting to investigate hard-to
define activities: subversion, terrorism
and extremist activities They are
using national security to license il
legal conduct which is subverting the
liberties of all Americans.
"But we have made tremendous
strides in this area. Whereas in 1974
there were 150,000 open cases of in
vestigation on individuals alleged en
gaged in such activities, today there
are 3000. I'm not at all sure there
should be any. but this is progress."
