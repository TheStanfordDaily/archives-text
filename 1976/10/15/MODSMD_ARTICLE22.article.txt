## Biography: Eliot, Pound and Williams

Three On The Tower by Louise
Simpson I Morrow, $5.95)
Three On The Tower is a triple
biography of the three American
writers who brought English
poetry into the twentieth cen
tury: T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and
William Carlos Williams. The
author. Louis Simpson, explores
the lives of these poets not only
to illuminate their poetry and
their age but also to examine
how America almost destroys its
native authors.
Simpson is one of the best
American poets writing today.
His work has displayed a range
and power that makes the poetry
of many of his contemporaries
seem narrow in comparison. The
publication of Three On The
Tower promised to be a major
literary event. An important
American poet was evaluating
the lives and work of the three
most important poets of the pre
ceding generation. Whether this
promise was completely
realized however, is the subject
of some question.
Simpson's book succeeds both
as a trilogy of medium-sized
biographies for the general
reader and as a thought
provoking book for specialists in
American literature. Although
the book is beautifully written
and often penetrating in its
analyses, it sometimes seems
unevenly organized and occa
sionally bigoted.
Academic vs. non-academic
Academic criticism of litera
ture is not nearly as bad as most
creative writers claim it to be. At
its worst it is certainly dull, ver
bose and unnecessarily pedan
tic. But the worst of any type of
writing is bad. The best criticism
coming out of universities today
rivals, if not surpasses, the best
non-academic writing.
There is one area of nearly
general failure in academic criti
cism — literary biography. Too
often scholars record literally
everything an author ever did
without selection. The book (or
usually books) grow without a
shaping direction. The end pro
duct is too often a huge mess of
little interest to anyone except
relatives and future biographers.
Three On The Tower has some
conspicuous faults as an evalua
tion of the careers of these three
poets. Simpson is very opinion
ated about his subjects and their
work. As a creative artist him
self, he often cannot resist the
temptation to evaluate these
poets' lives and work in the light
of his own interests and pre

judices. This subjectivism
makes the book misleading at
times. It also makes it lively.
Nowhere do Simpson's faults
as a biographer appear more
clearly than in his chapters on
Eliot. As one reads this section, it
becomes clear that Simpson dis
likes his subject, both personally
and philosophically. As he ex
plains Eliot's ideas, Simpson un
dercuts them. Discussing Eliot's
difficult personal life, Simpson
sometimes seems to gloat on its
problems. Describing how Eliot
gradually attained some per
sonal happiness and financial
security late in life, Simpson al
most ridicules him as a fogey
and a hypocrite.
Hero-worship has ruined
many good biographies. Hut de
bunking a hero without
adequate reason is certainly an
equally ruinous method of de
scribing a great man's career.
Eliot's life is difficult to write
about. Eliot asked that no biog
raphy of him be written. His
widow, family and most of his
friends have been able to pre
serve an almost monastic silence
about his life. His letters and
personal papers have been kept
from public scrutiny. Even a
pornographic epic poem he
wrote is locked up at Harvard,
safe from the eyes of scholars.
Some facts have leaked out.
Two of Eliot's acquaintances
have written personal memoirs
ot him. Although they contained
some crucial revelations, both
books were frankly terrible. A
good unofficial biography has
been long overdue, and Simpson
might well have written it. Yet
his lack of sympathy with his
subject has vitiated his attempt.
In the thirties Eliot shocked
many of his admirers by convert
ing to Anglo-Catholicism.
Simpson seems to be suffering
from this shock. He cannot be
lieve that this step was anything
but a backward step for the au
thor of The Wasteland. It was a
mistake. Simpson claims, both
intellectually and poetically. His
section on the Four Quartets, for

example, spends more time pro
ving how inferior they are to
Eliot's early poetry than it does
explaining their importance in
Eliot's career.
The sections on Pound suffer
from the same problem.
Simpson handles Pound's early
career in London brilliantly. He
captures the excitement both of
the poet and the period. But as
Pound develops into a thinker
whom Simpson finds personally
unattractive, the biography be
comes spotty and erratic. A biog
rapher should not sacrifice his
personal views in his work, but
he must harmonize them with
the overall structure of the work.
Simpson finds this discipline
difficult.
Personal tone
How well Simpson can deal
with a subject he likes is clearly
demonstrated by his chapters on
William Carlos Williams. It
would be hard to imagine a bet
ter short biography than
Simpson's. Not only does he
deal with Williams' life and
work, he also presents a series of
engaging portraits of Williams,
the man, throughout his career.
This personal tone, so effective
in Simpson's book, is missing
from too many contemporary
biographies.
Likewise Simpson's biog
raphies draw important general
conclusions. It is both instruc
tive and depressing to realize
how much of the best modern
American writing was done in
London or Paris. Pound, Eliot
and, to a lesser degree. Williams
all had to leave America to de
velop as major writers. Like
Henry James before him, Eliot
eventually became a British citi
zen.
Pound, embittered by the neg
lect America had heaped on him
so lavishly, remained an exile for
decades. Ironically. his
homecoming became a national
event. He was flown"back to the
States in handcuffs after having
been accused of treason. De
clared insane, he spent his

15-year repatriation in an in
sane asylum. Symbolically, this
spot, the ward for the criminally
insane at San Elizabeth's Hospi
tal, was one of the most impor
tant literary meeting places
America ever had.
The sensible choice
Meanwhile in Rutherford,
New Jersey, another great mod
ern poet was working as an
obstetrician. William Carlos
Williams chose what Simpson
calls the only "sensible choice"
America offers its poets: another
profession. Like two famous
New England insurance execu
tives, Wallace Stevens and
Charles Ives, Williams chose
hard work and obscurity. Rec
ognition would come but so late
in life that that one wonders if it
really mattered by then.
The doctors who declared

Pound insane might justifiably
have extended this diagnosis to
any American who wants to be a
poet. Poverty, neglect, expatria
tion, madness are hardly the re
wards a bright young person
would willingly pursue. Even
the seemingly peaceful careers
of Robert Frost and Wallace Ste
vens were dominated by long
neglect, loneliness and despair.
Yet each great poet of Pound's
generation faced and overcame
these difficulties. Simpson's
book captures both the human
element of their struggles and
the spiritual importance of their
successes. Whatever its
shortcomings Three On The
Toiver is a book that should be
read.

Academic criticism of litera
ture is not nearly as bad as most
creative writers claim it to be. At
its worst it is certainly dull, ver
bose and unnecessarily pedan
tic. But the worst of any type of
writing is bad. The best criticism
coming out of universities today
rivals, if not surpasses, the best
non-academic writing.
There is one area of nearly
general failure in academic criti
cism — literary biography. Too
often scholars record literally
everything an author ever did
without selection. The book (or
usually books) grow without a
shaping direction. The end pro
duct is too often a huge mess of
little interest to anyone except
relatives and future biographers.
Three On The Tower has some
conspicuous faults as an evalua
tion of the careers of these three
poets. Simpson is very opinion
ated about his subjects and their
work. As a creative artist him
self, he often cannot resist the
temptation to evaluate these
poets' lives and work in the light
of his own interests and pre

judices. This subjectivism
makes the book misleading at
times. It also makes it lively.
Nowhere do Simpson's faults
as a biographer appear more
clearly than in his chapters on
Eliot. As one reads this section, it
becomes clear that Simpson dis
likes his subject, both personally
and philosophically. As he ex
plains Eliot's ideas, Simpson un
dercuts them. Discussing Eliot's
difficult personal life, Simpson
sometimes seems to gloat on its
problems. Describing how Eliot
gradually attained some per
sonal happiness and financial
security late in life, Simpson al
most ridicules him as a fogey
and a hypocrite.
Hero-worship has ruined
many good biographies. Hut de
bunking a hero without
adequate reason is certainly an
equally ruinous method of de
scribing a great man's career.
Eliot's life is difficult to write
about. Eliot asked that no biog
raphy of him be written. His
widow, family and most of his
friends have been able to pre
serve an almost monastic silence
about his life. His letters and
personal papers have been kept
from public scrutiny. Even a
pornographic epic poem he
wrote is locked up at Harvard,
safe from the eyes of scholars.
Some facts have leaked out.
Two of Eliot's acquaintances
have written personal memoirs
ot him. Although they contained
some crucial revelations, both
books were frankly terrible. A
good unofficial biography has
been long overdue, and Simpson
might well have written it. Yet
his lack of sympathy with his
subject has vitiated his attempt.
In the thirties Eliot shocked
many of his admirers by convert
ing to Anglo-Catholicism.
Simpson seems to be suffering
from this shock. He cannot be
lieve that this step was anything
but a backward step for the au
thor of The Wasteland. It was a
mistake. Simpson claims, both
intellectually and poetically. His
section on the Four Quartets, for

example, spends more time pro
ving how inferior they are to
Eliot's early poetry than it does
explaining their importance in
Eliot's career.
The sections on Pound suffer
from the same problem.
Simpson handles Pound's early
career in London brilliantly. He
captures the excitement both of
the poet and the period. But as
Pound develops into a thinker
whom Simpson finds personally
unattractive, the biography be
comes spotty and erratic. A biog
rapher should not sacrifice his
personal views in his work, but
he must harmonize them with
the overall structure of the work.
Simpson finds this discipline
difficult.
Personal tone
How well Simpson can deal
with a subject he likes is clearly
demonstrated by his chapters on
William Carlos Williams. It
would be hard to imagine a bet
ter short biography than
Simpson's. Not only does he
deal with Williams' life and
work, he also presents a series of
engaging portraits of Williams,
the man, throughout his career.
This personal tone, so effective
in Simpson's book, is missing
from too many contemporary
biographies.
Likewise Simpson's biog
raphies draw important general
conclusions. It is both instruc
tive and depressing to realize
how much of the best modern
American writing was done in
London or Paris. Pound, Eliot
and, to a lesser degree. Williams
all had to leave America to de
velop as major writers. Like
Henry James before him, Eliot
eventually became a British citi
zen.
Pound, embittered by the neg
lect America had heaped on him
so lavishly, remained an exile for
decades. Ironically. his
homecoming became a national
event. He was flown"back to the
States in handcuffs after having
been accused of treason. De
clared insane, he spent his

15-year repatriation in an in
sane asylum. Symbolically, this
spot, the ward for the criminally
insane at San Elizabeth's Hospi
tal, was one of the most impor
tant literary meeting places
America ever had.
The sensible choice
Meanwhile in Rutherford,
New Jersey, another great mod
ern poet was working as an
obstetrician. William Carlos
Williams chose what Simpson
calls the only "sensible choice"
America offers its poets: another
profession. Like two famous
New England insurance execu
tives, Wallace Stevens and
Charles Ives, Williams chose
hard work and obscurity. Rec
ognition would come but so late
in life that that one wonders if it
really mattered by then.
The doctors who declared

Pound insane might justifiably
have extended this diagnosis to

poet. Poverty, neglect, expatria
tion, madness are hardly the re
wards a bright young person
would willingly pursue. Even

of Robert Frost and Wallace Ste

neglect, loneliness and despair.
Yet each great poet of Pound's

these difficulties. Simpson's

Three On The Tower is a triple
biography of the three American
writers who brought English
poetry into the twentieth cen

William Carlos Williams. The
author. Louis Simpson, explores
the lives of these poets not only
to illuminate their poetry and

Simpson is one of the best

His work has displayed a range

American poet was evaluating
the lives and work of the three

Simpson's book succeeds both
as a trilogy of medium-sized

from public scrutiny. Even a
pornographic epic poem he
wrote is locked up at Harvard,
safe from the eyes of scholars.
Some facts have leaked out.
Two of Eliot's acquaintances
have written personal memoirs
ot him. Although they contained
some crucial revelations, both
books were frankly terrible. A
good unofficial biography has
been long overdue, and Simpson
might well have written it. Yet
his lack of sympathy with his
subject has vitiated his attempt.
In the thirties Eliot shocked
many of his admirers by convert
ing to Anglo-Catholicism.
Simpson seems to be suffering
from this shock. He cannot be
lieve that this step was anything
but a backward step for the au
thor of The Wasteland. It was a
mistake. Simpson claims, both
intellectually and poetically. His
section on the Four Quartets, for

example, spends more time pro
ving how inferior they are to
Eliot's early poetry than it does
explaining their importance in
Eliot's career.
The sections on Pound suffer
from the same problem.
Simpson handles Pound's early
career in London brilliantly. He
captures the excitement both of
the poet and the period. But as
Pound develops into a thinker
whom Simpson finds personally
unattractive, the biography be
comes spotty and erratic. A biog
rapher should not sacrifice his
personal views in his work, but
he must harmonize them with
the overall structure of the work.
Simpson finds this discipline
difficult.

How well Simpson can deal
with a subject he likes is clearly
demonstrated by his chapters on
William Carlos Williams. It
would be hard to imagine a bet
ter short biography than
Simpson's. Not only does he
deal with Williams' life and
work, he also presents a series of
engaging portraits of Williams,
the man, throughout his career.
This personal tone, so effective
in Simpson's book, is missing
from too many contemporary
biographies.
Likewise Simpson's biog
raphies draw important general
conclusions. It is both instruc
tive and depressing to realize
how much of the best modern
American writing was done in
London or Paris. Pound, Eliot
and, to a lesser degree. Williams
all had to leave America to de
velop as major writers. Like
Henry James before him, Eliot
eventually became a British citi
zen.
Pound, embittered by the neg
lect America had heaped on him
so lavishly, remained an exile for
decades. Ironically. his
homecoming became a national
event. He was flown"back to the

been accused of treason. De
clared insane, he spent his

15-year repatriation in an in
sane asylum. Symbolically, this
spot, the ward for the criminally
insane at San Elizabeth's Hospi

tant literary meeting places
America ever had.
The sensible choice
Meanwhile in Rutherford,
New Jersey, another great mod
ern poet was working as an
obstetrician. William Carlos
Williams chose what Simpson
calls the only "sensible choice"
America offers its poets: another
profession. Like two famous
New England insurance execu
tives, Wallace Stevens and
Charles Ives, Williams chose
hard work and obscurity. Rec
ognition would come but so late
in life that that one wonders if it
really mattered by then.

Three On The Tower by Louise
Simpson I Morrow, $5.95)
Three On The Tower is a triple
biography of the three American
writers who brought English
poetry into the twentieth cen
tury: T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and
William Carlos Williams. The
author. Louis Simpson, explores
the lives of these poets not only
to illuminate their poetry and
their age but also to examine
how America almost destroys its
native authors.
Simpson is one of the best
American poets writing today.
His work has displayed a range
and power that makes the poetry
of many of his contemporaries
seem narrow in comparison. The
publication of Three On The
Tower promised to be a major
literary event. An important
American poet was evaluating
the lives and work of the three
most important poets of the pre
ceding generation. Whether this
promise was completely
realized however, is the subject
of some question.
Simpson's book succeeds both
as a trilogy of medium-sized
biographies for the general
reader and as a thought
provoking book for specialists in
American literature. Although
the book is beautifully written
and often penetrating in its
analyses, it sometimes seems
unevenly organized and occa
sionally bigoted.
Academic vs. non-academic
Academic criticism of litera
ture is not nearly as bad as most
creative writers claim it to be. At
its worst it is certainly dull, ver
bose and unnecessarily pedan
tic. But the worst of any type of
writing is bad. The best criticism
coming out of universities today
rivals, if not surpasses, the best
non-academic writing.
There is one area of nearly
general failure in academic criti
cism — literary biography. Too
often scholars record literally
everything an author ever did
without selection. The book (or
usually books) grow without a
shaping direction. The end pro
duct is too often a huge mess of
little interest to anyone except
relatives and future biographers.
Three On The Tower has some
conspicuous faults as an evalua
tion of the careers of these three
poets. Simpson is very opinion
ated about his subjects and their
work. As a creative artist him
self, he often cannot resist the
temptation to evaluate these
poets' lives and work in the light
of his own interests and pre

judices. This subjectivism
makes the book misleading at

subject has vitiated his attempt.
In the thirties Eliot shocked
many of his admirers by convert
ing to Anglo-Catholicism.
Simpson seems to be suffering
from this shock. He cannot be
lieve that this step was anything
but a backward step for the au
thor of The Wasteland. It was a
mistake. Simpson claims, both
intellectually and poetically. His
section on the Four Quartets, for

example, spends more time pro
ving how inferior they are to
Eliot's early poetry than it does
explaining their importance in
Eliot's career.
The sections on Pound suffer
from the same problem.
Simpson handles Pound's early
career in London brilliantly. He
captures the excitement both of
the poet and the period. But as
Pound develops into a thinker
whom Simpson finds personally
unattractive, the biography be
comes spotty and erratic. A biog
rapher should not sacrifice his
personal views in his work, but
he must harmonize them with
the overall structure of the work.
Simpson finds this discipline
difficult.
Personal tone
How well Simpson can deal
with a subject he likes is clearly
demonstrated by his chapters on
William Carlos Williams. It
would be hard to imagine a bet
ter short biography than
Simpson's. Not only does he
deal with Williams' life and
work, he also presents a series of
engaging portraits of Williams,
the man, throughout his career.
This personal tone, so effective
in Simpson's book, is missing
from too many contemporary
biographies.
Likewise Simpson's biog
raphies draw important general
conclusions. It is both instruc
tive and depressing to realize
how much of the best modern
American writing was done in
London or Paris. Pound, Eliot
and, to a lesser degree. Williams
all had to leave America to de
velop as major writers. Like
Henry James before him, Eliot
eventually became a British citi
zen.
Pound, embittered by the neg
lect America had heaped on him
so lavishly, remained an exile for
decades. Ironically. his
homecoming became a national
event. He was flown"back to the
States in handcuffs after having
been accused of treason. De
clared insane, he spent his

15-year repatriation in an in
sane asylum. Symbolically, this
spot, the ward for the criminally
insane at San Elizabeth's Hospi
tal, was one of the most impor
tant literary meeting places
America ever had.
The sensible choice
Meanwhile in Rutherford,
New Jersey, another great mod
ern poet was working as an
obstetrician. William Carlos
Williams chose what Simpson
calls the only "sensible choice"
America offers its poets: another
profession. Like two famous
New England insurance execu
tives, Wallace Stevens and
Charles Ives, Williams chose
hard work and obscurity. Rec
ognition would come but so late
in life that that one wonders if it
really mattered by then.
The doctors who declared

Pound insane might justifiably
have extended this diagnosis to
any American who wants to be a
poet. Poverty, neglect, expatria
tion, madness are hardly the re
wards a bright young person
would willingly pursue. Even
the seemingly peaceful careers
of Robert Frost and Wallace Ste
vens were dominated by long
neglect, loneliness and despair.
Yet each great poet of Pound's
generation faced and overcame
these difficulties. Simpson's
book captures both the human
element of their struggles and
the spiritual importance of their
successes. Whatever its
shortcomings Three On The
Toiver is a book that should be
read.

Three On The Tower by Louise
Simpson I Morrow, $5.95)
Three On The Tower is a triple
biography of the three American
writers who brought English
poetry into the twentieth cen
tury: T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and
William Carlos Williams. The
author. Louis Simpson, explores
the lives of these poets not only
to illuminate their poetry and
their age but also to examine
how America almost destroys its
native authors.
Simpson is one of the best
American poets writing today.
His work has displayed a range
and power that makes the poetry
of many of his contemporaries
seem narrow in comparison. The
publication of Three On The
Tower promised to be a major
literary event. An important
American poet was evaluating
the lives and work of the three
most important poets of the pre
ceding generation. Whether this
promise was completely
realized however, is the subject
of some question.
Simpson's book succeeds both
as a trilogy of medium-sized
biographies for the general
reader and as a thought
provoking book for specialists in
American literature. Although
the book is beautifully written
and often penetrating in its
analyses, it sometimes seems
unevenly organized and occa
sionally bigoted.
Academic vs. non-academic
Academic criticism of litera
ture is not nearly as bad as most
creative writers claim it to be. At
its worst it is certainly dull, ver
bose and unnecessarily pedan
tic. But the worst of any type of
writing is bad. The best criticism
coming out of universities today
rivals, if not surpasses, the best
non-academic writing.
There is one area of nearly
general failure in academic criti
cism — literary biography. Too
often scholars record literally
everything an author ever did
without selection. The book (or
usually books) grow without a
shaping direction. The end pro
duct is too often a huge mess of
little interest to anyone except
relatives and future biographers.
Three On The Tower has some
conspicuous faults as an evalua
tion of the careers of these three
poets. Simpson is very opinion
ated about his subjects and their
work. As a creative artist him
self, he often cannot resist the
temptation to evaluate these
poets' lives and work in the light
of his own interests and pre

judices. This subjectivism
makes the book misleading at
times. It also makes it lively.
Nowhere do Simpson's faults
as a biographer appear more
clearly than in his chapters on
Eliot. As one reads this section, it
becomes clear that Simpson dis
likes his subject, both personally
and philosophically. As he ex
plains Eliot's ideas, Simpson un
dercuts them. Discussing Eliot's
difficult personal life, Simpson
sometimes seems to gloat on its
problems. Describing how Eliot
gradually attained some per
sonal happiness and financial
security late in life, Simpson al
most ridicules him as a fogey
and a hypocrite.
Hero-worship has ruined
many good biographies. Hut de
bunking a hero without
adequate reason is certainly an
equally ruinous method of de
scribing a great man's career.
Eliot's life is difficult to write
about. Eliot asked that no biog
raphy of him be written. His
widow, family and most of his
friends have been able to pre
serve an almost monastic silence
about his life. His letters and
personal papers have been kept
from public scrutiny. Even a
pornographic epic poem he
wrote is locked up at Harvard,
safe from the eyes of scholars.
Some facts have leaked out.
Two of Eliot's acquaintances
have written personal memoirs
ot him. Although they contained
some crucial revelations, both
books were frankly terrible. A
good unofficial biography has
been long overdue, and Simpson
might well have written it. Yet
his lack of sympathy with his
subject has vitiated his attempt.
