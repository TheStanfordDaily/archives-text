## Pressure on Cards to beat Washington 
### Dave Georgette 
Stanford coach Jack Christian
sen must be a firm believer in the
philosophy of John Foster Dul
les. Eisenhower's Secretary of
State advocated a policy of
brinkmanship with the com
munist world, of going to the
edge but stopping short of war.
For the last few seasons, Chris
tiansen's teams have gone to the
brim of elimination from Rose
Howl competition halfway
through the year. Then theCards
have rallied during the remain
der of the Pacific-8 season to
make a strong challenge for that
trip to Pasadena.
Such an approach has vet to
provide a visit to the Arroyo
Seco, but it has accounted for
expressions of hope among red
rooters during the balance of the
season. However, should the
Cardinals fail to defeat the
Washington Huskies tomorrow
at Stanford Stadium (1:30 pin),
the rest of the schedule may just
as well be scrapped.
Second-year Husky head
coach Don James described the
significance of the contest. "The

most important gillie is always
tin; next game. We look at Stan
ford >is definitely being in the
conference race." said James.
Offensive lapse
Washington (.1-2). at least for
the time being. has .1 slightly bet
ter "equal chance" than Stan
ford. Last week Washington sur
vived its own offensive in
eptitude to win its conference
opener at Oregon State, 24-12.
"The fans that came down
from Seattle," said James, "liked
the defense, but not the offense.
We played terribly on offense.
We couldn't run three plays in a
row without making a mistake. It
was the worst blocking since
we've been here."
Oregon State limited
Washington's starting backfield
of fullback Robin Earl and Ron
Rowland to just 87 yards. De
spite this poor offensive show
ing, the Huskies are still averag
ing over 250 yards per game (in
the ground.
Rowland, a junior from San
Jose City College, is second in
thePac-8 in rushing. Big number
99, Earl (6-foot-5, 250 pounds)

who made the switch from tight
end to fullback two years ago
against tin 1 Cards, has rambled
for 439 yards this season.
Rowland questionable
It is not known whether Row
land will play tomorrow because
of a knee injury from last week's
game. Christiansen called his
replacement, freshman Joe
Steele, "a good running back."
Steele gained 78 yards last week
and scored two touchdowns
against the Heavers.
Though Christiansen said that
the Huskies seem to be "operat
ing more efficiently 011 offense
this year," it should take more
than a ground attack for
Washington to move the ball on
the Cards. "We had a very dif
ficult time running the ball
against Stanford last year," said
James. Stanford held the I luskies
to 7H yards rushing.
When Washington goes up
stairs, senior wide receiver Scott
Phillips should be the target. He
has 97 career catches for 1701
yards, both tops in Husky his
tory. The man throwing
the passes will be Warren
Moon, who Christiansen said
"seems to be playing better than
last year." The junior from
Hamilton High in Los Angeles
has completed 38 of 80 passes
this season. "He's done what
we've asked him," said James,
fames wary
Asked if he expects Stanford
to throw as many times as it did
against UCLA (53). Jiimes said. "I
hope they don't, but I'm sure
they will. They do it so well."
One of the defenders who will
be asked to stop (iuy Benjamin's
passes is sophomore Kyle Hein
rich. He is the son of Don Hein
rich, Washington's All -
American quarterback in 1950
and 1952.
Kyle is one of the many young
players called upon to replace
the 31 lettermen who graduated
last year. However, the new
players have not hurt the Hus
kies as much as might be ex
pected. "Some of the young guys
seem to be playing pretty good,"
said Christiansen.
As for the Cards, Chris said. "I
still have as much confidence as
1 did at the beginning of the year.
The fellows are trying as hard as
they can. but some of them aren't
playing as well as we expected."
