# Inge: an up and down career
## 
### Gary Sprague 
When Stanford halfback Ron Inge's
statistics for the UCLA game last
weekend were compiled, they looked
like this: four carries for 16 yards, seven
receptions for 41 yards.
What the statistics didn't show was a
grueling night of blocking blitzing
UCLA linebackers and leading fullback
IJonnie Stevenson into the huge UCLA
line. As could be expected, reactions to
Inge's performance varied considerably.
Backfield coach Dave Currey, who
calls Inge "one of Stanford's all time
greatest backs." congratulated Inge after
the game.
"Ron. you did a super job blocking
that no. 41 (UCLA linebacker)."
"Well," Inge replied, with charac
teristic self-criticism, "1 missed him
once."
Some Stanford fans, though, could
not see past the four carries and 16
yards. They remember the highly touted
sophomore of two years ago, the back
who was to give Stanford a running
game and they complain about what
they see as the "disappointment" of
Ron Inge. A Los Angeles paper put the
blame for the Stanford loss squarely on
Inge's apparent inability to grind out the
yardage.
"1 feel people expected a lot of me and
I've let them down," Inge said. "The
pressure of the expectations of others
really causes you to second guess your
self. That really bothers me."
Record book
Statistically, Inge's Stanford career
can't be termed a disappointment. He
holds several all-time Stanford records:
kickoff return average for a career, game
and season; and singlegamerushing av
erage. His 153 yards against
Washington State last year was one of
the 10 best rushing performances in
Stanford history. Inge has an excellent
chance to become at least number six on
the all-time Stanford career rushing list,
and he has a good shot at number seven
on the all-time receptions ladder, pas
sing receivers such as Randy Vatahaand
Hill Singler.
The intangibles, tactors which cannot
be represented in statistics, are equally
important elements of Inge's game. Cur
rey calls Inge "the best blocking
halfback of the conference" and"the
smartest football player I've ever
coached here." Wher. Stanford's lavo
rite running play, a fullback slant off left
tackle, works, Currey says,"it works be
cause Ron Inge is the lead blocker."
But fans don't cheer for blockers. The
reasons for Inge's failure to develop into
the glamorous running back many had
predicted are simple. Inge is a running
hack on a team which relies on the pass;
the opportunities to run 20 times a game

Ron Inge
just have not been there. And when the
opportunity to run has arisen, a series of
minor injuries has kept Inge at less than
full strength. "Things haven't gone that
right for me while I've been here," Inge
said.
Highly recruited
Yet three years ago it looked as if
things were going to he very right for a
long time. Inge came to Stanford as a
highly recruited running back out of St.
Mary's High School in Stockton. The
coaches had great hopes that he would
become one of Stanford's all-time great
runners. Inge showed his promise by
leading the nation in kickoff returns for
a while as a freshman.
Then came sophomore year and the
build-up. The Athletic Department and
the fans alike ballyhooed Inge as Stan
ford's most promising runner in years, a
great breakaway threat and the runner
who would finally give Stanford a
ground attack. Inge himself spoke of a
1.000 yard season. The Halo Alto Times
asked, "Will Stanford Season Hinge on
Inge?" Stanford put in an I-formation
expressly to exploit Inge's running ta
lents.
The expectations came across loud
and clear to Inge. "It started to bother me
psychologically," he said. "I didn't live
up to that. It still puzzles me at times."
Plagued by injuries
A major factor in Inge's failure to live
up to outside expectations was the dis
couraging string of injuries. As a
sophomore, he suffered a sprained
shoulder and cracked ribs. Card coaches
decided to scrap the 1 and Stanford re
turned to a fullback-oriented ground
game. The next year Inge was slowed by

a deep contusion in the thigh. And al
ready this season, he has added to his
collection of purple hearts with a
sprained foot and bruised ribs.
The injuries were as damaging
psychologically as they were physically
debilitating.
"I came to points." Inge said, "where I
racked my brain trying to figure out
what's wrong. 1 knew I was trying bard,
but things weren't happening, I couldn't
blame others; the only person 1 could
condemn was myself."
The beginning of his junior year was
Inge's psychological nadir.
"The publicity was that I was to be the
back to watch," he said. "Stanford had
great hopes for me and it didn't pan
out."
Mounting pressures
Pressures from self-criticism, his en
vironment and his home mounted. And
there were the injuries.
"I saw him eating his guts out," said
Currey. "One of the toughest things for
me to do was to see him on the bench
eating his guts out when I knew how
determined he was to play. It's tough to
walk up to Ron when he's hurt and say
'how are you feeling,' because you know
he's feeling bad. You just have to bleed
inside with him."
Inge coped with the frustration by
leaving it on the football field.
"I can go back to the dorm and my
friends," he said, "and they understand
that my whole life isn't football. I don't
live it 24 hours a day."
Biggest day
The Washi ngton State game provided
a big mental boost. Inge had his best
game ever, carrying nine times for 153
yards. Up in the press box, Currey was
moved to tears of happiness at seeing his
halfback finally break the long runs after
so much frustration.
"I feel it's something he deserves,"
said Currey, "but it has never
materialized for him."
Inge came into this season feeling
good physically and mentally, with
eight weeks of a steady training program
already behind him. Until the old
nemesis hit. A foot so swollen he
couldn't stuff it into his shoe kept him
oft the Michigan trip, and a hard shot in
the ribs put him on the sidelines for
some of the San Jose State game. Two
good games against Army and UCLA,
though, indicate that if Inge can stay out
of the hospital, he could have his best
season this year. .
If he had it all to do over again, would
he come back to Stanford? For Ron Inge,
the answer is a definite yes. The attrac
tion of the environment and academics
are overriding considerations.
"But," he said, smiling, "I might pla\
wide receiver."
