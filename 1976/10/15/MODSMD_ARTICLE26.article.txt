## JV gridders open season 
### Ben Webster 
With Stanford's varsity football team having its
problems, it might be a good time to check out the
junior varsity squad, especially since its season
opens today. The (lards host Taft College at 2::i()
p.m. in Stanford Stadium.
"We've got a lot of explosive speed and talent in
tpeoffensivebackfield.and l'vegot high hopes for
our secondary," said head coach Don Frease.
"Although our team has a majority of freshmen,
we're gaining experience quickly because a lot of
tflhe boys are working out with the varsity and
flaying on our scout teams."
j The Little Cardinals did not officially begin
conditioning until Sept. 30, but many of the
14 JV recruits began practicing with varsity coach
Jack Christiansen's men long before school
started. A few of'the freshmen have even seen
varsity gameaction this year,and some might suit
iip lor the Big Came, since NCAA regulations
permit a JV player to participate in a total of 1 1
games at the rate of one per week.
Strong defense
Barring injury problems, Stanford should field
a formidable defense.
Lending a rock-solid defensive line will be prep
All-American Dan Floyd, from Creat Falls, Mont.,
who weighs 240 pounds and stands a towering
6-foot-7 and 6-2,251-pound Paul Hibler, a Moun
tain View product. Any runner lucky enough to
elude the likes of Hibler and Floyd, and nose
guard Ken Nunn, will still have to reckon with a
quick and hard-hitting backfield.
An excellent trio of linebackers includes Joe
Spector, Redman Burke and Chuck Renner.
The defensive backfield features two men who
play varsity-caliber ball, sophomore safety Con
nie Wooldridge, who missed his entire frosh sea
son with a broken leg. and cornerback DeWayne
Purs ley, a junior who led the JVs in interceptions

last season.
l*rease had nothing but praise for cornerback
Creg Kelly, who is "very aggressive and a hard
hitter â€” sometimes too hard. He's great against
the pass and he has a good set of hands."
Potent offense
But the Cardinal defense would have its hands
full if confronted by its offensive counterparts.
Such a match-up might be difficult to arrange,
though, because some of the linemen may end up
going both ways.
More than filling the offensive tackle positions
will be scholarship recipients Bo Mattson, a prep
All-American from Hollister, and Brent Savior,
from Albany. Ore.,one of Stanford's top two re
cruits.
The quarterback is junior Joe Rominger. who
surfaced as the starter from a field of four likely
candidates. "He's a smart passer with a good
arm," said Frease. "1 le'll be; putting the ball in the
air a great deal." After all. we are talking about
Stanford football.
New wrinkle
A new twist this year will be the split back
option, which Frease hopes to employ frequently.
1 le's counting on using Joe's quickness, the blind
ing speed of 9.6 hundred man Cordie Banks, the
hard-to-pull-down style of returning fullback
Jimmy Dodd. and the swiftness of LaVois Hooks.
"We're perfectly suited to run the option,"
Frease said. "We've got all the varied abilities it
takes and we should be able to make it a potent
part of our offense."
The Cards' roster of receivers rivals the length
of the list of ASSU Senate aspirants. Three re
cruited pass-catchers are All-American Honora
ble Mention wide receivers RickParkerand David
Baum, and tight-end Pat Bowe. Some observers
regard Parker, 5-10 and 170, as the next Randy
Vataha.
