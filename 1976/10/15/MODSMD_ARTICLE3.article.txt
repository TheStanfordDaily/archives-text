The ( urreni levels 01 suiuent hon
esty here may be little different than
they were in 1961, according to Dean
of Student Affairs lames Lyons.
After examining preliminary data
from a survey conducted by the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) last spring. Lyons predicts that
the level of honesty here will compare
favorably with a national survey in
1961 and with other universities.
The 197(> survey will be compared
with <i national study completed in
1'((»1 by William Bowers of the Bureau
of Applied Social Research at Colum
bia University.
Lyons said that many schools which
have studied their honor codes over
the p.ist three years have reported that
the level of honesty had fallen, or was
at least very low, and that they aban
doned or weakened significantly the
element of trust in their honor codes.
However. Lyons said he thought
SCLC's survey would show that just
th»* opposite has happened here.
"We are likelv to find that the level*

of honesty here have risen or remained
the same since we studied ourselves
last. And we will reaffirm our Honor
Code, and say it is better to do scholar
ship in a climate of trust than in a cli
mate of distrust," Lyons said.
In the summer of 1975, Ombudsman
John Goheen expressed concern over
the health of the Honor Code. As a con
sequence, President Richard Lyman
and the Council of Presidents wrote a
letter to SCLC, requesting that a study
be conducted to test whether the
Honor Code, in its present form, ex
presses values that predominate here.
"The spring study is virtually com
plete and will be used to make com
parisons between behavior now as op
posed to 15 years ago. However, until
the student members of the SCLC are
elected, the data can't be considered or
released," Lyons said.
The 1961 national study, which in
corporated data from Stanford, found
that at least half the students surveyed
had engaged in some form of academic
dishonesty since coming to college.
