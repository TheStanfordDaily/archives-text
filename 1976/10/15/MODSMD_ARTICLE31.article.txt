Prosecutor clears Ford
Washington — Special Watergate Prosecutor
Charles Ruff cleared President Gerald Ford yester
day of an allegation that Ford converted campaign
funds to his personal use for nearly a decade before
he became president.
The president, who previously had expressed
confidence that the investigation would not turn up
any evidence of wrongdoing, later expressed his
pleasure at being cleared.
Ruff, in a two-page statement read to reporters by
a spokesman, said: "The matter has now been
closed, and counsel for the president has been so
advised."
Neither Ruff nor his spokesman would answer
questions about the investigation, but the statement
said in legal terminology that an informant's tip
about Ford misusing congressional campaign
funds in his home state of Michigan simply didn't
pan out.
Ford, Carter clash
Washington — President Gerald Ford said last
night that Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter's
criticism of foreign policy has slandered the United
States, but Carter said his dim view of the Republi
can administration "can't be translated into criti
cism of the whole country."
Ford held a nationally televised news confer
ence, where in response to questions, Ford accused
Carter of "slandering" the nation by criticizing
Ford's foreign policy. But Carter replied later that
"My criticism of this administration can't be trans
lated into criticism of the whole country."
The Democratic nominee said he did not know
whether he would ask for equal time on national
television to rebut Ford's comments. He smiled and
said, "1 came out pretty good tonight. . . . Appa
rently he thought he'd have a debate without my
being there. I don't know how well 1 did in the first
two debates, but 1 thought I did pretty well in the
press conference tonight."
Carter said Ford dodged questions about allega
tions that he helped block an early Watergate inves

tigation and, noting his past criticism of Ford for
failing to hold news conferences, he added: "I'll
have to be critical of him for holding a press confer
ence and not answering any questions."
Carter letter controversy
Presidential candidate Jimmy Carter, in a 1972
letter to a Lockheed Aircraft Corp. executive thank
ing him for a company-paid flight to Latin America,
offered to promote one of its planes "in an active
way."
Carter has confirmed taking the trip and said the
purpose of the trip was to promote foreign trade for
Georgia firms. Jody Powell, Carter's press secretary,
has said that during the trip and during another
taken at the expense of Coca Cola, also a Georgia
firm, the governor "never did a favor for either
company. I'm sure that he felt no obligation to these
companies."
The letter was addressed to Bob Roche, a vice
president at Lockheed's Marietta, Ga., plant.
Hua consolidates position
Tokyo — Hua Kuo-feng was believed to be con
solidating his position as China's top leader at a
high-level meeting in Peking yesterday, but the
government maintained its official silence on the
reported turmoil in the Chinese hierarchy.
it was not known whether the reported meeting
would be faced merely with the task of rubber
stamping Hua's selection to succeed the late Mao
Tse-tung as party chairman, or would have to deal
with factional strife surrounding the question of
succession.
