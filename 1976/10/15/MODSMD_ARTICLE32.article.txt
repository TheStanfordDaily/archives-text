Food poisoning ruled out
No evidence has been found to confirm that the
affliction suffered by several Larkin residents one
week ago was indeed food poisoning, according to
university Safety and Health Specialist Hal Wilson.
"I made a thorough investigation of this incident
and could find no epidemiological evidence which
would indicate food poisoning as the cause of the
illness reported by the Larkin residents," Wilson
said.
There were large variations in the symptoms and
the amount of time which elapsed before they ap
peared in each individual, Wilson said. Based in
part on variations, he concluded that although it is
not possible to absolutely rule out food poisoning
as the cause of the distress, it is very unlikely.
