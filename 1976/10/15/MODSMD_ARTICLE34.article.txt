# THE
						ARTS ON CAMPUS
## The
						Lively Arts At Stanford 
### 
.When Tom Bacchetti, Director of Public
Events, first heard a live orchestra his fresh
man year of college, he felt like he had been
lifted out of his seat. As Bacchetti puts
together The Lively Arts at Stanford, a
seven-year-old program of music, dance and
theater, he continually tries to create a similar
impact for audiences.
The Lively Arts at Stanford gives audiences
a chance to see and hear the greatest people in
the performing arts in the world at a fraction of
the ticket price of concerts in big cities. The
Guarneri String Quartet's Six Concert Cycle
of Beethoven Quartets, Jose Ferrer's "The Art
of the Monologue," The Eliot Feld Ballet and
The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln
Center are a few of the highlights in this
year's varied program.
It is hard to say why or how the arts are
important. Lynn Bonde, Associate Director of
Public Events, says that the arts are not just
transmitters of our culture but a great
unrecognized part of living.
It is also hard to explain the power of a live
audience and define the interaction between

performers and their audience. Although you
cannot measure the quality of a live audience
the difference between attending a concert
and listening to a record is considerable.
Performers are sensitive to their audiences,
and audiences respond to performers.
"Being part of a live audience is a risk,"
says Bacchetti. "You cannot just leave a
performance like you shut off the radio or TV
set."
"Most people view modern dance concerts
as particularly risky because they do not
know what to expect," says Bonde. "Once
they have overcome their hesitancy and are at
the concert, they enjoy the combination of
movement and music, color and sound and
light. Dance appeals to the senses."
The Lively Arts will present three different
dance experiences this year.
The Utah Repertory Dance Theater has a
special interest in presenting modern dance to
people who are unfamiliar with it. The
company spends 15 weeks touring across the
country and devotes the rest of its time to

work in residence at the University of Utah.
Its repertoire of 52 dances represents the
work of 25 choreographer-dancers.
New York Times dance critic Clive Barnes
considers 31-year-old Eliot Feld the most
talented classic choreographer in the world
today. His chamber company is specifically
selected and trained to perform Feld's works.
His program at Stanford will include
"Harbinger" with music by Prokoviev,
"Mazurka" with music by Chopin and
"Tzaddik" with music by Copland.
Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo is a
ballet company serious about being funny.
Although they parody the classic ballet, their
humor reflects a familiarity with the classic
tradition. After prima ballerina Natalia
Makarova, who dances Odette in the
American Ballet Theater "Swan Lake," saw
Peter Anastis's interpretation of the delicate
role, she rushed backstage to compare swan
stories.
In the area of music The Lively Arts
presents both the names of the future and the
well-established excellence of musical groups
such as Music from Marlboro which has
appeared at Stanford seven times.
The three greats-Bach, Beethoven and
Mozartâ€”are honored by special performances.
The Guarneri String Quartet will play all of
Beethoven's quartet compositions. The Fine

Arts Quartet will perform Mozart's viola
quintets and The Bach Aria Group will fill
Memorial Church with the glorious sounds of
Bach's arias.
Along with these classic concerts The
Lively Arts offers such unusual musical
performances as Narciso Yepes playing ten
string guitar, medieval musical drama
performed by the Ensemble for Early Music
and The American Brass Quintet.
For the past five years The Lively Arts has
presented concerts by members of The Young
Concert Artists Series, a professional
organization which sponsors talented young
musicians from all over the world.
This year The Young Concert Artists Series
consists of performances by three soloists:
Jeffrey Swann, a 24-year-old pianist whose
first symphony was performed by the Dallas
Symphony Orchestra when he was 14, violist
Marcus Thompson and violinist Daniel
Phillips. Music by Three, a group consisting of
French hornist Robert Routch, violinist Lucy
Stoltzman and pianist Lydia Arymiw makes
up the fourth concert in this program.
It is remarkable to watch performers
college age or a few years older who already
have achieved such great musical skill. Almost
all these musicians began their instruments
between the age of four and seven. Many are
