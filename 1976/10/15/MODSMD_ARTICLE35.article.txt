# Tresidder Union Ticket Office Information
## 
### 
Now that you've read about all the exciting
events at Stanford this year and have chosen
some you'd like to see, the next step is
simple: stop by Tresidder Ticket Office on
the second floor of Tresidder Union to buy
your tickets and to insure yourself a place in
the audience.
At Tresidder you can purchase tickets for
Public Events performances, Music and Drama
Department productions, the Savoyards, or
ASSU concerts (indeed, for just about
anything at Stanford except athletic events,
the weekly film series, and certain
at-the-door-only-sales productions). And if
you're a student, be sure and ask about
special discounts.
But remember that tickets for Stanford
events aren't-all that the Ticket Office can
provide for you. Our goal is to function as a
small but comprehensive Bay Area
entertainment service center for the entire
Stanford community. We carry tickets for

events from San Jose to San Francisco and
Berkeley, and they include theatre,
symphony, opera, ballet, professional sports,
and miscellany (Circus, Pleasure Faire, and
the like).
Do you need Hearst Castle tickets or a
campsite reservation for a California state
park? We also handle these and all Ticketron
events. Do you live out of town? You can buy
tickets for Stanford events at major Bay Area
agencies such as Macys, and at agencies as far
away as the U.C. Davis and Santa Cruz box
offices.
The Ticket Office publishes a monthly
event guide listing all upcoming events for
which we sell tickets. Stop by Tresidder and
pick up a copy. If you like to order your
tickets well in advance, ask us for a mail flyer;
we stock them for most major events.
Call 497-4317 with your questions and
we'll do our best to answer them. If the
correct answers are more easily and accurately
