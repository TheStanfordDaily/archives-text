# Increase of women in faculty
## 
### Bill Sing 
Growth in the numbers of women
faculty members at Stanford over the
past year reached its highest rate since
1972-73, while the growth of black and
chicano faculty has leveled off. Vice
Provost Arthur Bienenstock reported
to the Faculty Senate yesterday.
"I have every reason to be satisfied
with our progress," said Bienenstock,
the university's faculty affirmative ac
tion officer."The results are signific
antly above what one could have an
ticipated.

"It looks like we've achieved what
we had hoped to achieve — equal op
portunity through affirmative action."
Stanford began affirmative action ef
forts in 1971, and since then has ap
proximately doubled its women and
minority faculty members. Initial in
creases in black and chicano faculty
were sharp, but since have tailed off.
"There are now over 100 women in
the Academic Council," said
Bienenstock, an increase from stt five
years ago. (Approximately 1000 per
sons make up the Academic Council,
which consists of most of the universi
ty's teaching faculty.) Over the past
year the university appointed 1H new
women, consisting of 19.4 per cent of
total new appointments. The percen
tage is up from 12.9 per cent the previ
ous year.
More women in technical fields
The majority of the new women ap
pointees were in humanities and sci
ences, but Bienenstock noted that he is
seeing more women in technical
fields.
The number of tenured women fa
culty "has remained relatively con
stant," Bienenstock said, increasing by
one from the previous year to 25.
Over the past year the university
added one new black faculty member,
but total black faculty dropped to 22
due to two departures. Tenured black
faculty remained constant at eight.
Slight chicano increase
Chicano faculty increased from 10 tn
11, with two new appointments and
one departure. Tenured chicano fa
culty doubled from two to four.
Bienenstock deemed the number ol
chicano faculty "low by my perception
of student needs, and the needs of the
institution." He said that the univer
sity is working to establish a file ol
bright young chicano scholars, and
encourages efforts to "seek potential
chicano candidates out."
The university appointed three new

Asian and Asian American faculty to
bring the total to 34, including 21 te
nured. Bienenstock said.
Minority tenure
The numbers of tenured women and
minority faculty should begin to in
crease as more of the earlier appoint
ments come up for review,
Bienenstock said. However, because a
high percentage of women and minor
ity faculty do not as yet have tenure,
their total numbers could decline
through terminations and retirements.
Such was the case in the decrease of
black faculty over the last year.
The rate of women and minority
members promoted to tenure as com
pared with their colleagues is "virtu
ally identical," said Bienenstock, but
the rate of tenure is "hard to tell" be
cause of yearly fluctuations in grant
ings of tenure,
"Our women, black and chicano fa
culty are spread throughout various
university departments," said
Bienenstock. Minority faculty do not
tend to be centered in particular areas
like ethnic studies, but have exercised
professional abilities in all academic
disciplines, he said.
No backlash
"Our job was to go after the best
people, and we did just that," con
tinued Bienenstock. "The faculty has
been completely behind us. There
have been no complaints or backlash
over the calibre of our affirmative ac
» tion appointments. Everyone has been
quite pleased.
"Stanford has just about the
strongest collection of black and
: chicano faculty I've seen," said
Bienenstock. "Their numbers aren't
large.but substantially largeenough to
possess some real coherent strengths."
The university has an affirmative ac
tion fund totalling $50,000 annually,
designed to provide departments with
positive incentives to increase their
' women and minority faculty.

one departure. Tenured chicano fa
culty doubled from two to four.
Bienenstock deemed the number ol
chicano faculty "low by my perception
of student needs, and the needs of the
institution." He said that the univer
sity is working to establish a file ol
bright young chicano scholars, and
encourages efforts to "seek potential
chicano candidates out."
The university appointed three new

Asian and Asian American faculty to
bring the total to 34, including 21 te
nured. Bienenstock said.
Minority tenure
The numbers of tenured women and
minority faculty should begin to in
crease as more of the earlier appoint
ments come up for review,
Bienenstock said. However, because a
high percentage of women and minor
ity faculty do not as yet have tenure,
their total numbers could decline
through terminations and retirements.
Such was the case in the decrease of
black faculty over the last year.
The rate of women and minority
members promoted to tenure as com
pared with their colleagues is "virtu
ally identical," said Bienenstock, but
the rate of tenure is "hard to tell" be
cause of yearly fluctuations in grant
ings of tenure,
"Our women, black and chicano fa
culty are spread throughout various
university departments," said
Bienenstock. Minority faculty do not
tend to be centered in particular areas
like ethnic studies, but have exercised
professional abilities in all academic
disciplines, he said.
No backlash
"Our job was to go after the best
people, and we did just that," con
tinued Bienenstock. "The faculty has
been completely behind us. There
have been no complaints or backlash
over the calibre of our affirmative ac
» tion appointments. Everyone has been
quite pleased.
"Stanford has just about the
strongest collection of black and
: chicano faculty I've seen," said
Bienenstock. "Their numbers aren't
large.but substantially largeenough to
possess some real coherent strengths."
The university has an affirmative ac
tion fund totalling $50,000 annually,
designed to provide departments with
positive incentives to increase their
' women and minority faculty.

Growth in the numbers of women
faculty members at Stanford over the
past year reached its highest rate since
1972-73, while the growth of black and
chicano faculty has leveled off. Vice
Provost Arthur Bienenstock reported
to the Faculty Senate yesterday.
"I have every reason to be satisfied
with our progress," said Bienenstock,
the university's faculty affirmative ac
tion officer."The results are signific
antly above what one could have an
ticipated.

"It looks like we've achieved what
we had hoped to achieve — equal op
portunity through affirmative action."
Stanford began affirmative action ef
forts in 1971, and since then has ap
proximately doubled its women and
minority faculty members. Initial in
creases in black and chicano faculty
were sharp, but since have tailed off.
"There are now over 100 women in
the Academic Council," said
Bienenstock, an increase from stt five
years ago. (Approximately 1000 per
sons make up the Academic Council,
which consists of most of the universi
ty's teaching faculty.) Over the past
year the university appointed 1H new
women, consisting of 19.4 per cent of
total new appointments. The percen
tage is up from 12.9 per cent the previ
ous year.
More women in technical fields
The majority of the new women ap
pointees were in humanities and sci
ences, but Bienenstock noted that he is
seeing more women in technical
fields.
The number of tenured women fa
culty "has remained relatively con
stant," Bienenstock said, increasing by
one from the previous year to 25.
Over the past year the university
added one new black faculty member,
but total black faculty dropped to 22
due to two departures. Tenured black
faculty remained constant at eight.
Slight chicano increase
Chicano faculty increased from 10 tn
11, with two new appointments and
one departure. Tenured chicano fa
culty doubled from two to four.
Bienenstock deemed the number ol
chicano faculty "low by my perception
of student needs, and the needs of the
