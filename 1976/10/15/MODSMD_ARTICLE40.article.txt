# The 						Bureau of Western Mythology

### 
The Bureau of Western Mythology is a performing
ensemble of actors, dancers, musicians, and technical
artists organized for experimental theater. They will
perform in the second-floor lounge at Tresidder
Union at 7:30 p.m. on November 6, 7, 11, 12, 13,
and 14. Admission charge is $2.50, and tickets will be
available at the door or in advance at the Plowshare
bookstore on University Avenue in Palo Alto.
Their program theme is Leaves of Living, a
collection of poems by Sam Ambler. Co-directors
Ambler and Richard Carp treat the poetry as
theatrical material, open to interpretation with
movement and song as well as voice. An
environmental sculpture designed by Steve Voltz will

be constructed in the lounge for the performance.
Audience participation is integral to its design, so
guests will be free to sit where they choose (bring a
pillow for comfort) within the space, and at times
perform with the actors if they like. Original music
will be provided by Jim Baldwin and William
Ackerman, slides by Chrissy Freeman.
