Tresidder Programs presents Fine arts exhibits and
concerts and popular events throughout the year.
These include concerts by students, members of the
faculty, and professionals; exhibits in various media;
films; lectures; panels; workshops; and a wide variety
of entertainments. The annual Christmas Faire held
the first week in December each year (December 3-5
this year) fills the building with colorful crafts and
their creators, and offers the ideal opportunity to do
some Christmas shopping.
Music Department students and faculty perform in
chamber music concerts each Wednesday noon in the
second-floor lounge, and each Friday noon there is
outdoor entertainment including jazz, country, and
folk music as well as occasional performances by
belly dancers, pipers, the Stanford Band, and others.
Each quarter, the Tresidder Program Board presents a
Thursday evening lecture series in the second-floor

lounge. The topic of the Fall series is Psychic
Phenomena: Widening the Doors of Perception. Fall
plans also call for weekend entertainment and special
films.
If you have an idea for a program or event that
you would like to see happen at Tresidder, students
and staff from the program office are happy to help
you in scheduling space, obtaining funding,
organizing and planning the event, and publicizing it.
