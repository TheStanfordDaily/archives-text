# Inner Spaces & The Ultimate Mystery- Films with Astronaut Edgar D. Mitchell
## 
### 
Two films featuring Captain Edgar D. Mitchell,
Apollo 14 astronaut, will be screened at 7:30 p.m.
Tuesday, October 26, in the second-floor lounge at
Tresidder Union. Inner Spaces explores recent
scientific findings—the daily use of ESP by

executives, the effects of telepathy on the body, the
"out of body" experience—combined with ancient
religious and meditational practices to illustrate Capt.
Mitchell's contention that intuitive and religious ways
of knowing are just as important as objective or
scientific approaches.
In Vic Ultimate Mystery', Capt. Mitchell presents
remarkable scientific data supporting the claims of
mystics through the ages that there is a oneness to all
living things. Sequences include: lie-detector expert
Clive Backster's discovery of consciousness in plants
and in simple bacteria cells, acupuncturists and
psychic healers at work, leading biochemist S. Justa
Smith's demonstration of enzymic changes caused by
healers' hands, and new visions of the power of
consciousness.
Admission to the films will be $1, and the
community is invited to attend.
