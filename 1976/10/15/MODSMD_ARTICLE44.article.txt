# DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC

### 
The Department of Music at Stanford offers, throughout
the year, a rich and varied program of music from medieval
to modern times. Our students and faculty take an active
part in presenting the music they study, and sharing the
spectrum of musical experience with the Stanford
community.
A few highlights of the year:
The Francesco Trio, our ensemble-in-residence, will
present a six-concert series this year entitled Brahms and
Others, which will include two new trios written for the
group and which will feature guest soloists throughout the
year.
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra will present
Mahler's Das klagende Lied in the spring, with the
University Chorus and Choir and guest soloists, as well as a
selection during the year of music by Brahms, Downey,
Beethoven, and Shostakovich.
The University Chorus will sing Howard Hanson's New
Land. New Covenant in an area premiere during the fall
quarter, under the direction of the composer. Marie
Gibson and William Ramsey, both of our faculty, will be
soloists.
The Chamber Orchestra will perform each quarter,
presenting in the fall an opera in one act, II Maestro di
Capella, by Domenico Cimarosa, with William Ramsey as
baritone soloist, in a new English edition by Mark Starr. In
the winter they will present Haydn's Concerto for Piano
and Orchestra in D Major, with Margaret Fabrizio of our
faculty performing on the newly purchased 1811
Broadwood pianoforte. The spring Chamber Orchestra
concert will feature student conductors.
The Stanford Wind Ensemble performs each quarter,
presenting music by Gunther Schuller, Darius Milhaud,
Gustav Hoist, Francis Poulenc, Igor Stravinsky, Roy
Harris, and Will Gay Bottje. Arthur P. Barnes, director,
shares the podium with Patrick Spurling, a graduate
student in brass and TA in Studio Band. Guest soloists will
also be featured.
The Early Music Singers and the Renaissance Wind
Band perform each quarter, providing vocal and
instrumental music from before the baroque period.
The Memorial Church Choir presents its annual
Christmas concert in Early December—a well loved
Stanford tradition.
Alea 11, the Ensemble for New Music, performs
contemporary music including many premieres and
student or faculty compositions.
Faculty recitals offer chamber music and solo

performances of the highest calibre throughout the
academic year.
This quarter Henri Farge, countertenor, who was last
spring a visiting lecturer from the Conservatoire Nationale,
Paris, will present a recital of Italian music, with Margaret
Fabrizio playing the 1811 Broadwood.
Student recitals are offered year round and testify to
the excellence of the Stanford musical tradition.

The Department of Music at Stanford offers, throughout
the year, a rich and varied program of music from medieval
to modern times. Our students and faculty take an active
part in presenting the music they study, and sharing the
spectrum of musical experience with the Stanford
community.
A few highlights of the year:
The Francesco Trio, our ensemble-in-residence, will
present a six-concert series this year entitled Brahms and
Others, which will include two new trios written for the
group and which will feature guest soloists throughout the
year.
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra will present
Mahler's Das klagende Lied in the spring, with the
University Chorus and Choir and guest soloists, as well as a
selection during the year of music by Brahms, Downey,
Beethoven, and Shostakovich.

Land. New Covenant in an area premiere during the fall
quarter, under the direction of the composer. Marie
