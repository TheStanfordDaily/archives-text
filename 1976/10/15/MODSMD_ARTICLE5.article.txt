### Kathy Trafton 
The Hammer and Coffin slate swept
the ASSU Senate elections, according
to unofficial results released last night
by Elections Commissioner Kandv
Bird. Six out of seven Hammer and
Coffin candidates were elected as
senators, and the seventh placed as the
first alternate.
Ballots from students at the overseas
campuses are due next Wednesday,
and Bird says he expects to receive
about 40 additional votes.
Hammer and Coffin victor Barry
Parr, who came in ninth in the under
graduate elections, made the follow
ing official Hammer and Coffin state
ment: "In view of the dismal results,
Hammer and Coffin is demanding a
recount."
Hammer and Coffin claims that any
person bringing one of their campaign
posters to the Saturday night flicks
(The Toll Blond Man With One Hlack
Shoe) at Cubberley Auditorium will
get in at half price.
ASSU President Vic Petroff said that
he "wasn't worried. They'll (Hammer
and Coffin people) have to be serious."
10 new senators
The 10 highest vote-getters will be
senators for the ASSU, and the next 10
will be senatorial alternates. The Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) has three new members as a
result of the elections; three alternates
were chosen as well.
Another slate that won was the
Livingston-Morrow-Sharp (under
graduate) slate. They took fourth, fifth
and seventh places.
Voter turnout in Wednesday's and

Thursday's election totaled 2889, ac
cording to Bird. He claimed it was "by
far the largest (ASSU) turnout in the
recent history of the school. There
were 350 more ballots cast than last
year. Voter turnout has increased
somewhat over the last two years. In
1974 there were 2411 votes, and in
1975 there were 2548 votes, Bird said.
Results available by 9
Election results were not available
until 9 p.m. last night. Bird said that
this is about one hour later than in
previous years, but "three to four
hours earlier than it would be with
paper ballots."
The ballots were counted by compu
ter, but complications slowed the pro
cess considerably. "One-fourth to
one-fifth of the cards were kicked out
(rejected by the computer) for errors
made by the voters." These technical
errors were corrected by ASSU offi
cials.
"Every ballot that is kicked out of
there has to be gone over by hand.
People can't count from one to 10. and
they fill in the wrong number." said
Bird.
Errors
The high number of rejections were
due to several types of errors. The
primary error was improper erasures
â€” the computer is "sensitive and in
consistent." according to Bird. Stu
dents also filled in non-existent boxes.
Most of the rejections could be cor
rected except for situations where the
voter marked boxes for graduates and
undergraduates alike. Approximately
10 such ballots were voided, according
to officials.
