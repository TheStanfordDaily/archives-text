# Farm bill facts unclear

### Mary LeBlanc 
Advocates and opponents of Propos
ition 14, the farm labor initiative, are
disputing the honesty of each others'
media campaigns.
Advocates claim that the growers'
ads which state that Proposition 14
will deny individuals their property
rights are "false and misleading,"
while opponents charge that cer
tain"Yes on 14" statements are
"fraudulent."
Radio spots by bos Angeles City At
torney Hurt Pines and San Francisco
District Attorney loseph Freitas,
which began airing Oct. 12, denounce
"No on 14" media campaign as "false
political advertising."
United Farmworkers President
Cesar Chavez pointed out Tuesday that
"the Pines and Freitas commercials
grow out of a feeling of many elected
officials that the $2.5 million cam
paign by the giant corporations, which
are using small farmers for their ads. is
a gross political trick being played on
the public."
Will Kirkland, spokesman for the
San Francisco "Yes on 14 effort
states, "Certain television and radio
ads imply that if people vote no on
Proposition 14 their private property
will be protected."
Kirkland went on to say th.it because
both the U.S. Supreme Court and the

California SupremeCourt have upheld
the right of workers to congregate with
union organizers dir.ing non-working
hours "they (workers) will still have
that access regardless of whether
Proposition 14 wins or not."
"Rut 'No effort' ads continue to
claim that Proposition 14 invades pri
vate property rights," Kirkland said.
Mill Roberts, state campaign director
for the "No on 14." said in defense of its
advertising campaign, "Since the dis
trict attorney of San Francisco has pub
licly criticized some of the 'No on 14'
advertising, I trust that Mr. Freitas. . .
will look into the fraudulent state
ments of the 'Yes on 14' which claim
that Proposition 14 will give them the
right of secret union elections."
Secret elections
According to Roberts, farm workers
now enjoy such secret elections under
state Agriculture Relation Hoard
(ALRB) regulations.
He added that Freitas "obviously
doesn't know that passage of Proposi
tion 14 would make it possible for
labor organizations to continue to
trespass on private farm property after
a union election is certified."
"I suggest Mr. Freitas takes a good
look at what the proponents of 14 are
doing and saving And I think he'll
find cause to talk about their mislead
ing statements." Roberts said.
