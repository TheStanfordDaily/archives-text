## Opinions Harris favors concrete environmental action 
### 
June Cooperman

David Harris, the Democratic candi
date for Congress in the 12th District,
is a strong environmentalist. More
than just seeking increased legal pro
tection for a few endangered species
(which he supports), he is interested in
restructuring American consumption
patterns in order to make a saner and
safer world.
This can be seen wi th his energy pol
icy. Harris points out that the first
priority is conservation. West Ger
mans share our standard of living but
only use half the energy. Obviously
something is very wrong. American
energy consumption can be drastically
cut with no ill effects either economi
cally or in the standard of living. But it
will not happen by itself. There must
be popular support and public leader
ship.
First step
The conservation program is only
the first step. It can buy us time until
efficient alternative energy sources are
developed. Harris feels that the main
emphasis should be put on the de
velopment of solar, wind, tidal and
ocean thermal power. This should in
clude federal aid in the form of tax
incentives.
After all, the government provided
billions of dollars in subsidies for the
oil industry and the nuclear industry is
still getting millions every year.
Second priority should go to such
costly (and currently unsound en
vironmentally) sources of oil as oil
shale and tar sands.
Lowest priority should be given to
nuclear energy. As Harris points out,
"two decades of experience with nuc
lear reactors have shown that they are

neither safe nor economical. When the
problems of waste disposal, reactor
safety, and nuclear proliferation have
been solved we may be able to use nuc
lear power to supplement solar
energy."
Not inevitable
The present energy crisis was not
inevitable. For years America's energy
decisions have been made by the
utilities, the giant corporations (espe
cially the oil companies) and the gov
ernment. The failure of the present
administration's half-hearted energy
program can be traced to the fact that
no national energy policy is possible
without grappling with the
monopolistic controls exercised by the
giant energy companies,
Exxon is not only the world's largest
oil producer but it is also the largest
coal producer in the world. The oil and
coal companies also dominate the nuc
lear field.
As long as our energy decisions are
in the hands of the oil companies and a
few remote federal departments we
will continue to waste energy, use
dirty and inefficient energy, grow in
dependence of foreign oil and fail to
develop alternative energy sources.
Such a course can mean only one thing
â€” disaster.
So it is important to support candi
dates like Harris who are willing to go
to the roots of our energy crisis and
take concrete measures to end it. Lead
ership like his has obviously been
lacking in the present Congress. Vote
for David Harris on Nov. 2.
