						few bugs in the 'stop-out' system

Since 1971. universities around the
country have begun to recognize the
difference between the student who
"drops out" of school and doesn't re
turn. and one who "stops out" but re
turns later to complete his education.
Since administrators started to care
about such students as "stop-outs,"
Stanford has discovered that 50 per
cent of its own student body falls into
that category.
Unfortunately, this university has
been slow to develop a strong counsel
ing program for its "stop-out" stu
dents. and if my experience is any in
dication, we have a long way to go in
meeting the needs of its "stop-outs."
Late this summer. 1 decided not to
enroll in the upcoming quarter. In
stead. I decided to work for a few more
months, in hopes that I could earn
enough money to help defray the ex-

pense of another two years at "the
Farm."
Stop-out appointment
During registration week, I tried to
make an appointment at the Career
Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) to see a stop-out counselor. 1
had a number of questions concerning
how my leave of absence would affect
my financial aid package and what it
would do to my chances of later going
to an overseas campus.
1 was told by one of the workers at
the student employment branch of the
CPPC that there were no counselors
available. She suggested that I leave
my name and phone number and, oh
yes, check back next week just in case
somebody lost it.
I was amazed. It seems to me that
registration week would be one of the
most important times for stop-out

counselors to be available to offer ad
vice, particularly for those students
having a tough time trying to decide
whether to enroll or not.
Back to CPPC
Four days later, I became un
employed and found myself back at
the GPPC, this time in search of a job.
However, when I went to student
employment, I was told that because I
didn't havea current student ID I could
not look at the job listings for part-time
work. -
In order to gain access to these jobs, I
would have to see one of the elusive
stop-out counselors first.
I was given an appointment to see
one later that afternoon. As it turned
out. my counselor was unable to keep
the appointment and I was re
scheduled for the next morning. After
wasting a full day of job hunting while
waiting for a meeting that never took

place. I finally convinced student
employment .that I needed to get a job
very soon, and they reluctantly re
leased the listings to me.
My meeting the following morning
with one of the counselors was help
ful, but 1 was surprised to learn that my
"counselor" had never once stopped
out herself.
It is clear that the university needs
time to set up an organized and useful
counseling program for its stop-out
students. My own experience in the
past two weeks has given me the desire
to become a counselor myself. As soon
as I return to school, I intend to devote
some of my time to making sure that no
student will ever have to go through
what I have in stopping out here.
