# Warnke: Ford and Nixon foreign policy will change under Carter administration
## 
### Lisa Lowe 
Paul Warnke, a foreign policy ad
viser to Democratic presidential can
didate Jimmy Carter, contended Fri
day that a Carter administration's ap
proach to foreign relations would be
very different from that of the Nixon or
Ford administration.
Warnke, speaking at Kresge Au
ditorium. addressed himself to three
major areas of foreign policy: East-
West relations, arms control and arms
transfers.
Warnke, assistant secretary of
state under Lyndon Johnson, was
named in a recent New York Times
article as one of the three or four men
most likely to become secretary of
state or of defense should Carter be
elected.
"The world has changed, but we
have not quite adjusted to it. There still
exists anachronistic vestiges of the old
bi-polar foreign policy," he said.
Warnke explained that previously
all countries had been viewed by the
United States as either pro- or anti
communist. but the antagonism bet
ween mainland China and the Soviet
Union, and the emergence of many
smaller third world nations has made
this type of categorization simplistic.
Multi-polar world
"We must recognize that this is a
multi-polar world," he added.
Warnke said the practice of supply
ing arms to pro-American countries
and withholding arms from pro
communist countries is an "amoral

and unproductive approach.
"Detente is not the be-all or end-all
of foreign relations. I believe a Carter
administration could understand this
and have a more realistic vision of the
limits of detente," he said.
Arms control
On the subject of arms control,
Warnke stated that the past treatises
limiting arms have done nothing. A
Carter administration would make
coming to an arms control agreement
and then reducing strategic arms a far
higher priority, Warnke said.
"Arms control is not sufficiently a
priority item in the Republican prog
ram," he continued.
"An early item would be to beef up
the negotiating team in Geneva. It
would be better to have a high
powered delegation than to rely on one
man," he added.
Kissinger as Metternich
Earlier, Warnke had noted that Sec
retary of State Henry Kissinger has
been called both a "latter-day Metter
nich" and a "Machiavelli."
He said the offensive capabilities of
both the United States and the Soviet
Union should be cut back.
On the question of arms transfers,
Warnke pointed out that the U.S. has
become a leading arms merchant.
Cut down arms sales
"It would be a high priority of a Car
ter administration to cut down as
much as possible on arms sales.
"Agreements ought to be reached
with thq other major suppliers of arms:

the U.S.S.R., France, the United King
dom and West Germany, to cut down
on arms sales," he said.
He indicated that restraint must be
exercised in both the quantity and the
types of arms supplied.
Lebanon
Referring to the civil war in Leba
non, he stated, "All arms merchants of
the world must look at the Lebanon
incident with a great djeal of guilt."
Warnke said after the speech that he
was against foreign intervention by the
U.S. Instead, he said, all countries

should control their own destinies, un
like the example of Rhodesia, where
the U.S. is a prime negotiator, accord
ing to Warnke.
He said he could not comment when
asked in which areas of foreign policy
he advised Governor Carter before the
debates, but said he felt Carter did very
well in the last debate.
Warnke said he viewed the possibil
ity of being chosen for secretary of
state or of defense as remote. However
he added, "If asked, 1 would accept. If
confirmed, I would serve."

been called both a "latter-day Metter
nich" and a "Machiavelli."
He said the offensive capabilities of
both the United States and the Soviet
Union should be cut back.
On the question of arms transfers,
Warnke pointed out that the U.S. has
become a leading arms merchant.
Cut down arms sales
"It would be a high priority of a Car
ter administration to cut down as
much as possible on arms sales.
"Agreements ought to be reached
with thq other major suppliers of arms:

the U.S.S.R., France, the United King
dom and West Germany, to cut down
on arms sales," he said.
He indicated that restraint must be
exercised in both the quantity and the
types of arms supplied.
Lebanon
Referring to the civil war in Leba
non, he stated, "All arms merchants of
the world must look at the Lebanon
incident with a great djeal of guilt."
Warnke said after the speech that he
was against foreign intervention by the
U.S. Instead, he said, all countries

should control their own destinies, un
like the example of Rhodesia, where
the U.S. is a prime negotiator, accord
ing to Warnke.
He said he could not comment when
asked in which areas of foreign policy
he advised Governor Carter before the
debates, but said he felt Carter did very
well in the last debate.
Warnke said he viewed the possibil
ity of being chosen for secretary of
state or of defense as remote. However
he added, "If asked, 1 would accept. If
confirmed, I would serve."
Paul Warnke, a foreign policy ad
viser to Democratic presidential can
didate Jimmy Carter, contended Fri
day that a Carter administration's ap
proach to foreign relations would be
very different from that of the Nixon or
Ford administration.
Warnke, speaking at Kresge Au
ditorium. addressed himself to three
major areas of foreign policy: East-
West relations, arms control and arms
transfers.
Warnke, assistant secretary of
state under Lyndon Johnson, was
named in a recent New York Times
article as one of the three or four men
most likely to become secretary of
state or of defense should Carter be
elected.
"The world has changed, but we
have not quite adjusted to it. There still
exists anachronistic vestiges of the old
bi-polar foreign policy," he said.
Warnke explained that previously
all countries had been viewed by the
United States as either pro- or anti
communist. but the antagonism bet
ween mainland China and the Soviet
Union, and the emergence of many
smaller third world nations has made
this type of categorization simplistic.
Multi-polar world
"We must recognize that this is a
multi-polar world," he added.
Warnke said the practice of supply
ing arms to pro-American countries
and withholding arms from pro
communist countries is an "amoral

and unproductive approach.
"Detente is not the be-all or end-all
of foreign relations. I believe a Carter
administration could understand this
and have a more realistic vision of the
limits of detente," he said.
Arms control
On the subject of arms control,
Warnke stated that the past treatises
limiting arms have done nothing. A
Carter administration would make
coming to an arms control agreement
and then reducing strategic arms a far
higher priority, Warnke said.
"Arms control is not sufficiently a
priority item in the Republican prog
ram," he continued.
"An early item would be to beef up
the negotiating team in Geneva. It
would be better to have a high
powered delegation than to rely on one
man," he added.
Kissinger as Metternich
Earlier, Warnke had noted that Sec
retary of State Henry Kissinger has
been called both a "latter-day Metter
nich" and a "Machiavelli."
He said the offensive capabilities of
both the United States and the Soviet
Union should be cut back.
