# Letters: 'New Realism,' recycling

### 
Congressional choices
Our incumbent congressman, Rep.
Paul "Pete" McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), once had a reputation for being a
liberal Republican. Well, times have
changed, and McCloskey has changed
with them.
It's not just that the National Al
liance of Senior Citizens gives him an
eight per cent on key votes rating. And
that the Consumer Federation of
America says he voted against con
sumers 62 per cent of the time. Or that
his votes with the Congressional Con
servative Coalition have gone from 18
per cent to 44 per cent in the last four
years.

It would be idle to speculate on what
has brought about this change in
McCloskey. Nevertheless it is clear
that he's running on his old liberal
maverick imageand not on his increas
ingly conservative Republican beliefs.
David Harris, the young Democratic
challenger, can't be described as a
classic liberal either. He is more like
Governor Jerry Brown in his committ
ment to progressive and cost-effective
government.
It's no wonder that Brown has en
dorsed David Harris in the strongest
terms with the description, "new
blood, new ideas, strong convictions."
Harris calls it the "New Realism"

and says it means "not kidding our
selves about the limits of government
and asking tough questions like "who
profits and who pays? Will it help us
adjust to a world characterized by
scarcity?"
Voters in this district are fortunate.
They are faced with a real choice be
tween a Jerry Ford Republican and the
young challenger Harris.

Recycled platforms
I propose that the winners of the
ASSU elections, in order to de
monstrate their zeal and enthusiasm

for helping the students, personally
walk around the campus picking up all
the posters with which they have made
their claims and take them to the
nearest recycling bin.

Are there no witty heterosexual stu
dents left at Stanford? One could as
sume otherwise by virtue (?) of the
sophomoric graffiti that emblazon the
toilet walls here.
One sees better at the local junior
colleges!
