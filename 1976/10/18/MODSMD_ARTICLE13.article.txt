# Lin talks of China after Mao
## 
### Marc Strassman 
The real struggle in China is
not between radicals and mod
erates but between those who
have accepted and wish to carry
out former Chairman Mao Tse
tung's strategies, principles and
tactics and those who have not
accepted them, according to
Paul Lin, a close friend of the late
Chinese Premier Chou En-lai.
Speaking to a capacity crowd
of 700 in Kresge Auditorium
Friday, Lin, director of the
Center for East Asian Studies at
McCill University in Montreal, ob
served that "if China were with
out struggle at this moment, it
would be strange indeed."
Lin stressed the importance of
the moment, saying: "We stand
today at a rare juncture in human
history. Mao Tse-tung has pas
sed into history. This is a griev
ous loss of enormous propor
tions for China and the world."

He indicated, however, that
Mao's influence will continue
after his death. "The life of Mao
has ended, the heritage of Mao
has only begun to bear fruit," he
said.
"Mao was no super-human
godlike genius above the mas
sas," Lin declared.
"His ideas came from the ideas
of the masses and from observa
tions of the precise social reality,
analyzed with the tools of
thought developed by Marx and
Lenin from tbe struggles of
working people in England,
Fance, and Russia," he said.
Ideas and individuals played a
role in inciting revolution, how
ever. "A single spark," said Lin,
quoting Mao, "can start a prairie
fire."
Lin criticized recent media
coverage of developments in the
People's Republic, saying
"Much of the Western press has

been over-impressed by the (pre
sent) power struggle â€” but the
nature of that power struggle is
not simply between two factions
seeking to take over positions of
authority and privilege; it is bas
ically a struggle between two
opposing strategies for future
development of China."
Lin explained why, according
to the Chinese view, the Soviet
Union is a greater threat to world
peace than the United States.
Lin presented the Chinese
position that, after the disaster in
Vietnam, the United States is
pulling back around the world,
because there is no longer
adequate social and political
support for more adventures
since the Vietnamese War "tore
apart the social fabric of the Un
ited States." This is not true,
however, for the Soviet Union,
which exercises colonial control

of Eastern Europe, as well as
maintaining a profit-oriented
economy which needs to ex
pand, and is now trying to ex
tend its influence into the Indian
Ocean, Southern Africa, Eastern
Asia and the Eastern Mediterra
nean, said Lin.
Therefore, Lin reported, the
Chinese see that the Soviet
Union is the more aggressive
and therefore the more danger
ous of the two superpowers, and
have therefore further con
cluded that it is better to prepare
for war coming from the.Soviet
Union rather than from the U.S.
Mao's abiding contribution,
Lin concluded, has been to quic
ken the metabolism of social
change for centuries to come and
to "hasten the day when the
exploitation of man by man will
end. And for this, the future will
honor him."
