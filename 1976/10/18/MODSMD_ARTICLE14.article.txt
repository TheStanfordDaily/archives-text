# Harris fields questions

### Lonnie Rosenwald 
A post-debate reception for
Congressional candidate David
Harris Thursday night drew a
crowd of about 90 persons to the
American Studies House.
The gathering, which was
sponsored by the Program on
American Studies and the Stan
ford Committee on Political
Education (SCOPE) gave mem
bers of the University an oppor
tunity to meet the candidate and
to pursue some of the issues
raised in the debate.
The first questions asked of
Harris as he edged his way
through thecider-and-doughnut
line concerned the already in
famous pamphlet. During the
debate, Rep. Paul N. McCloskey
had charged and Harris had con
ceded that several distortions of
McCloskey's voting record were
included in a Harris pamphlet.
Asked to comment on the
pamphlet at the reception, Har
ris said, "We don't plan to with

draw the pamphlet," but intend
to review points made in the
pamphlet "one by one" and
weed out any false allegations.
Conversation in the sunken
lounge of the new theme house
then turned to campaign poli
tics. Harris said his private polls
showed him to be trailing
McCloskey by 12 percentage
points, and said his staff was
concentrating on efforts to get
out the vote, "the problem
Democrats always have."
For the benefit of a scribbling
herd of journalists who begged
for quotable statements of pol
icy, Harris renewed his en
dorsement of Proposition 14.
granting farmworkers the right
to elect union representation by
secret ballot.
The quiet discourse which
then flowed among the
cushioned recesses of the room
probed into the candidate's per
sonal ethics in matters of policy.
Harris was asked to justify his

position, expressed in the de
bate, that leverage was not a suf
ficient justification for arms
sales to governments suspected
of practicing torture. "At least
you're not going to supply the
arms that let them be in the posi
tion to torture." he responded.
The CIA and the topic of na
tional security was raised. "The
ultimate check and balance on
the CIA is the citizens them
selves," said Harris. But in a
somewhat more realistic vein he
urged the creation of "an over
sight committee that's not just an
adjunct of the CIA."
"The ultimate safeguard is to
free the people from the claims
of secrecy," Harris continued,
but conceded that Congress
must have the ultimate power to
decide what constitues national
security.
A journalist himself, Harris
mused over the ideal situation
where "journalist's sources are
their own sources."
