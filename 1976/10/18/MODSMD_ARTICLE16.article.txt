## Stanford survives 21-point Husky rally Cards hold off Washington 
### Paul Bauman 
Stanford is establishing itself
as a great team — for three quar
ters.
For the third straight week, the
Cardinals suffered a fourth
period breakdown, but this time
hung on to beat a fair
Washington team, 34-28. The
Huskies scored 21 points in the
final quarter.
Stanford has given up 87
points in its last three games,
and 83 (72 per cent) have come
in the final period.
Eliminate the first quarter in
the Penn State game, and the
fourth in the Army and UCLA
games, and the Cards would be
5-1 instead of 2-4. Michigan?
The less said about that the bet
ter.
Hockey
If the Cards are going to con
tinue this pattern of just three
good periods, they'd better
switch to playing hockey.
"It was really scary in the
fourth quarter," Stanford coach
Jack Christiansen said. "Those
things start happening and then
it all starts coming back to you. 1
looked up at the scoreboard and
started wondering."

Christiansen attributed the
lapse to fatigue. Washington did
run 80 offensive plays in the
game, compared to the Cards' 59.
Despite Washington's rally,
this was, in all honesty, a rather
boring game. It was the typical
game between Stanford and a
Pacific-8 northern team: the
Cards take the lead, show them
selves to be clearly superior,
relax a little, watch the game get
close and then wait out the
clock.
No noise
The 36,000 customers made
about as much noise as three or
four boisterous Michigan fans.
There just wasn't much to cheer
about. At times, the fans were so
quiet that Stanford quarterback
Guy Benjamin's signals could be
heard in the press box, which is
located in the upper strato
sphere.
The highlights of the after
noon were the band, the reports
of the California-Oregon State
game, a few long passes from
Benjamin to Tony Hill and Bill
Kellar, a short fight between
Benjamin and a Washington
lineman, and the final gun
which mercifully ended the

game.
But the Cards got a win and the
spectators got tans, so everybody
was happy.
Air attack
Washington head coach Hon
James expected to see a barrage
of passes from Benjamin, but it
never materialized. Benjamin
threw only 22 times, but com
pleted 14 for 270 yards and one
touchdown.
Benjamin was rushed hard in
the first quarter and completed
just two of his first eight passes.
Christiansen said Husky defen
sive tackle Dave Browning was
creating a problem by coming
inside rather than outside as ex
pected.
After Stanford adjusted by
moving a guard to block Brown
ing, the Huskies were virtually
helpless when Benjamin drop
ped back to pass. The Card QB
missed only two passes the rest
of the day and completed six of
six passes in the second half for
130 yards.
Inexperienced
Washington's inexperienced
defensive backs (three sopho
mores and one junior) were play
ing Stanford's receivers tight
and Benjamin was able to burn
them long. Kellar caught passes
covering 34 and 37 yards and
James Lofton scored in the third
quarter on a 35-yard pass from
Benjamin.
"They were off us only seven
or eight yards and they were

playing us inside," Kellar said.
"I saw it right off. All we had to
do was come off the ball, give an
inside fake and basically just run
right by them."
When asked why he threw
comparatively few times, Ben
main said that Washington "was
really aware of the pass.
"There was more running this
week," he said. "Last week
UCLA gave us the pass.
Washington gave us the run, so
we took it."
Touchdown drives
Although Stanford's total of
115 yards rushing wasn't exactly
overwhelming, the Cards' run
ning game did help sustain some
long touchdown drives.
Sophomore Phil Francis led
Stanford with 54 yards on only
eight carries. He also caught pas
ses of 13 and 20 yards, both lead
ing to Stanford touchdowns.
Don Stevenson had another
solid game, gaining 52 yards on
12 carries.
If the Cards ran a little better
than expected, Washington pas
sed better than expected.
After the Huskies got behind
27-7 with two minutes left in the
third quarter, they had to scrap
their impressive running game
in favor of the pass. At that point,
it looked as if Stanford had it
made because Warren Moon is not
regarded highly as a passer.
Moon surprised his critics by
drilling some passes and leading

drives of 80, 71 and 55 yards.
The Husky quarterback finished
the day with 15 completions in
28 attempts for 209 yards and
two touchdowns. He had one
pass intercepted by Stanford
linebacker Ray Cardinalli in the
second quarter.
Washington also ran well,
which wasn't surprising. The
Huskies gained 204 yards on the
ground, which is actually a little
below their average. Halfback
Ron Rowland led all rushers
with 66 yards on 16 rushes.
Robin Earl, who weighs a husky
250 pounds, rumbled for 64
yards on 15 carries.
Freshman Joe Steele, who
started for Rowland, was killing
the Cards on the ground in the
first quarter, but had to leave the
game after taking a shot in the
head.
One of the Huskies' problems

was that they stopped their own
drives with fumbles and penal
ties. On one series in the second
quarter, Rowland ran for 17
yards. Earl for 11, and
Washington was penalized both
times. The Huskies were run
ning all over Stanford on their
first drive after halftime, but a
clipping call put an end to that
threat.
Maybe Washington had
watched Stanford game films a
bit too intently.
Cardinal notes: Hill re
sprained the ankle he hurt in the
fymn State game late in the third
quarter...He did not return to ac
tion, but the injury is not thought
to be serious...Hill still caught
five passes for 91 yards.

Washington to touchdown
drives of 80, 71 and 55 yards.
The Husky quarterback finished
the day with 15 completions in
28 attempts for 209 yards and
two touchdowns. He had one
pass intercepted by Stanford
linebacker Ray Cardinalli in the
second quarter.
Washington also ran well,
which wasn't surprising. The
Huskies gained 204 yards on the
ground, which is actually a little
below their average. Halfback
Ron Rowland led all rushers
with 66 yards on 16 rushes.
Robin Earl, who weighs a husky
250 pounds, rumbled for 64
yards on 15 carries.
Freshman Joe Steele, who
started for Rowland, was killing
the Cards on the ground in the
first quarter, but had to leave the
game after taking a shot in the
head.
One of the Huskies' problems

was that they stopped their own
drives with fumbles and penal
ties. On one series in the second
quarter, Rowland ran for 17
yards. Earl for 11, and
Washington was penalized both
times. The Huskies were run
ning all over Stanford on their
first drive after halftime, but a
clipping call put an end to that
threat.
Maybe Washington had
watched Stanford game films a
bit too intently.
Cardinal notes: Hill re
sprained the ankle he hurt in the
fymn State game late in the third
quarter...He did not return to ac
tion, but the injury is not thought
to be serious...Hill still caught
five passes for 91 yards.
Stanford middle linebacker
Gordy Ceresino was in on more
than twice as many tackles an
anyone on either team...Ceresino
was credited with 17 tackles and
four assists.
Stanford is establishing itself
as a great team — for three quar
ters.
For the third straight week, the
Cardinals suffered a fourth
period breakdown, but this time
hung on to beat a fair
Washington team, 34-28. The
Huskies scored 21 points in the
final quarter.
Stanford has given up 87
points in its last three games,
and 83 (72 per cent) have come
in the final period.
Eliminate the first quarter in
the Penn State game, and the
fourth in the Army and UCLA
games, and the Cards would be
5-1 instead of 2-4. Michigan?
The less said about that the bet
ter.
Hockey
If the Cards are going to con
tinue this pattern of just three
good periods, they'd better
switch to playing hockey.
"It was really scary in the
fourth quarter," Stanford coach
Jack Christiansen said. "Those
things start happening and then
it all starts coming back to you. 1
looked up at the scoreboard and
started wondering."

Christiansen attributed the
lapse to fatigue. Washington did
run 80 offensive plays in the
game, compared to the Cards' 59.
Despite Washington's rally,
this was, in all honesty, a rather
boring game. It was the typical
game between Stanford and a
Pacific-8 northern team: the
Cards take the lead, show them
selves to be clearly superior,
relax a little, watch the game get
close and then wait out the
clock.
No noise
The 36,000 customers made
about as much noise as three or
four boisterous Michigan fans.
There just wasn't much to cheer
about. At times, the fans were so
quiet that Stanford quarterback
Guy Benjamin's signals could be
heard in the press box, which is
located in the upper strato
sphere.
The highlights of the after
noon were the band, the reports
of the California-Oregon State
game, a few long passes from
Benjamin to Tony Hill and Bill
Kellar, a short fight between
Benjamin and a Washington
lineman, and the final gun
which mercifully ended the

game.
But the Cards got a win and the
spectators got tans, so everybody
was happy.
Air attack
Washington head coach Hon
James expected to see a barrage
of passes from Benjamin, but it
never materialized. Benjamin
threw only 22 times, but com
pleted 14 for 270 yards and one
touchdown.
Benjamin was rushed hard in
the first quarter and completed
just two of his first eight passes.
Christiansen said Husky defen
sive tackle Dave Browning was
creating a problem by coming
inside rather than outside as ex
pected.
After Stanford adjusted by
moving a guard to block Brown
ing, the Huskies were virtually
helpless when Benjamin drop
ped back to pass. The Card QB
missed only two passes the rest
of the day and completed six of
six passes in the second half for
130 yards.
Inexperienced
Washington's inexperienced
defensive backs (three sopho
mores and one junior) were play
ing Stanford's receivers tight
and Benjamin was able to burn
them long. Kellar caught passes
covering 34 and 37 yards and
James Lofton scored in the third
quarter on a 35-yard pass from
Benjamin.
"They were off us only seven
or eight yards and they were

playing us inside," Kellar said.
"I saw it right off. All we had to
do was come off the ball, give an
inside fake and basically just run
right by them."
When asked why he threw
comparatively few times, Ben
main said that Washington "was
really aware of the pass.
"There was more running this
week," he said. "Last week
UCLA gave us the pass.
Washington gave us the run, so
we took it."
Touchdown drives
Although Stanford's total of
115 yards rushing wasn't exactly
overwhelming, the Cards' run
ning game did help sustain some
long touchdown drives.
Sophomore Phil Francis led
Stanford with 54 yards on only
eight carries. He also caught pas
ses of 13 and 20 yards, both lead
ing to Stanford touchdowns.
Don Stevenson had another
solid game, gaining 52 yards on
12 carries.
If the Cards ran a little better
than expected, Washington pas
sed better than expected.
After the Huskies got behind
27-7 with two minutes left in the
third quarter, they had to scrap
their impressive running game
in favor of the pass. At that point,
it looked as if Stanford had it
made because Warren Moon is not
regarded highly as a passer.
Moon surprised his critics by
drilling some passes and leading

Inexperienced
Washington's inexperienced
defensive backs (three sopho
mores and one junior) were play
ing Stanford's receivers tight
and Benjamin was able to burn
them long. Kellar caught passes
covering 34 and 37 yards and
James Lofton scored in the third
quarter on a 35-yard pass from
Benjamin.
"They were off us only seven
or eight yards and they were

playing us inside," Kellar said.
"I saw it right off. All we had to
do was come off the ball, give an
inside fake and basically just run
right by them."
When asked why he threw
comparatively few times, Ben
main said that Washington "was
really aware of the pass.
"There was more running this
week," he said. "Last week
UCLA gave us the pass.
Washington gave us the run, so
we took it."
Touchdown drives
Although Stanford's total of
115 yards rushing wasn't exactly
overwhelming, the Cards' run
ning game did help sustain some
long touchdown drives.
Sophomore Phil Francis led
Stanford with 54 yards on only
eight carries. He also caught pas
ses of 13 and 20 yards, both lead
ing to Stanford touchdowns.
Don Stevenson had another
solid game, gaining 52 yards on
12 carries.
If the Cards ran a little better
than expected, Washington pas
sed better than expected.
After the Huskies got behind
27-7 with two minutes left in the
third quarter, they had to scrap
their impressive running game
in favor of the pass. At that point,
it looked as if Stanford had it
made because Warren Moon is not
regarded highly as a passer.

drilling some passes and leading

The Husky quarterback finished
the day with 15 completions in
28 attempts for 209 yards and
two touchdowns. He had one
pass intercepted by Stanford
linebacker Ray Cardinalli in the
second quarter.
Washington also ran well,
which wasn't surprising. The
Huskies gained 204 yards on the
ground, which is actually a little
below their average. Halfback
Ron Rowland led all rushers
with 66 yards on 16 rushes.
Robin Earl, who weighs a husky
250 pounds, rumbled for 64
yards on 15 carries.
Freshman Joe Steele, who
started for Rowland, was killing
the Cards on the ground in the
first quarter, but had to leave the
game after taking a shot in the
head.
One of the Huskies' problems

was that they stopped their own
drives with fumbles and penal
ties. On one series in the second
quarter, Rowland ran for 17
yards. Earl for 11, and
Washington was penalized both
times. The Huskies were run
ning all over Stanford on their
first drive after halftime, but a
clipping call put an end to that
threat.

watched Stanford game films a
bit too intently.

For the third straight week, the

points in its last three games,
and 83 (72 per cent) have come
in the final period.
Eliminate the first quarter in
the Penn State game, and the
fourth in the Army and UCLA
games, and the Cards would be
5-1 instead of 2-4. Michigan?
The less said about that the bet
ter.
Hockey
If the Cards are going to con
tinue this pattern of just three
good periods, they'd better
switch to playing hockey.
"It was really scary in the
fourth quarter," Stanford coach
Jack Christiansen said. "Those
things start happening and then
it all starts coming back to you. 1
looked up at the scoreboard and
started wondering."

Christiansen attributed the
lapse to fatigue. Washington did
run 80 offensive plays in the
game, compared to the Cards' 59.
Despite Washington's rally,
this was, in all honesty, a rather
boring game. It was the typical
game between Stanford and a
Pacific-8 northern team: the
Cards take the lead, show them
selves to be clearly superior,
relax a little, watch the game get
close and then wait out the
clock.
No noise
The 36,000 customers made
about as much noise as three or
four boisterous Michigan fans.
There just wasn't much to cheer
about. At times, the fans were so
quiet that Stanford quarterback
Guy Benjamin's signals could be
heard in the press box, which is
located in the upper strato
sphere.
The highlights of the after
noon were the band, the reports
of the California-Oregon State
game, a few long passes from
Benjamin to Tony Hill and Bill
Kellar, a short fight between
Benjamin and a Washington
lineman, and the final gun
which mercifully ended the

game.
But the Cards got a win and the
spectators got tans, so everybody
was happy.
Air attack
Washington head coach Hon
James expected to see a barrage
of passes from Benjamin, but it
never materialized. Benjamin
threw only 22 times, but com
pleted 14 for 270 yards and one
touchdown.
Benjamin was rushed hard in
the first quarter and completed
just two of his first eight passes.
Christiansen said Husky defen
sive tackle Dave Browning was
creating a problem by coming
inside rather than outside as ex
pected.
After Stanford adjusted by
moving a guard to block Brown
ing, the Huskies were virtually
helpless when Benjamin drop
ped back to pass. The Card QB
missed only two passes the rest
of the day and completed six of
six passes in the second half for
130 yards.

game, compared to the Cards' 59.
Despite Washington's rally,
this was, in all honesty, a rather
boring game. It was the typical
game between Stanford and a
Pacific-8 northern team: the
Cards take the lead, show them
selves to be clearly superior,
relax a little, watch the game get
close and then wait out the
clock.
No noise
The 36,000 customers made
about as much noise as three or
four boisterous Michigan fans.
There just wasn't much to cheer
about. At times, the fans were so
quiet that Stanford quarterback
Guy Benjamin's signals could be
heard in the press box, which is
located in the upper strato
sphere.
The highlights of the after
noon were the band, the reports
of the California-Oregon State
game, a few long passes from
Benjamin to Tony Hill and Bill
Kellar, a short fight between
Benjamin and a Washington
lineman, and the final gun
which mercifully ended the

game.
But the Cards got a win and the
spectators got tans, so everybody
was happy.
Air attack
Washington head coach Hon
James expected to see a barrage
of passes from Benjamin, but it
never materialized. Benjamin
threw only 22 times, but com
pleted 14 for 270 yards and one
touchdown.
Benjamin was rushed hard in
the first quarter and completed
just two of his first eight passes.
Christiansen said Husky defen
sive tackle Dave Browning was
creating a problem by coming
inside rather than outside as ex
pected.
After Stanford adjusted by
moving a guard to block Brown
ing, the Huskies were virtually
helpless when Benjamin drop
ped back to pass. The Card QB
missed only two passes the rest
of the day and completed six of
six passes in the second half for
130 yards.
Inexperienced
Washington's inexperienced
defensive backs (three sopho
mores and one junior) were play
ing Stanford's receivers tight
and Benjamin was able to burn
them long. Kellar caught passes
covering 34 and 37 yards and
James Lofton scored in the third
quarter on a 35-yard pass from
Benjamin.
"They were off us only seven
or eight yards and they were

playing us inside," Kellar said.
"I saw it right off. All we had to
do was come off the ball, give an
inside fake and basically just run
right by them."
When asked why he threw
comparatively few times, Ben
main said that Washington "was
really aware of the pass.
"There was more running this
week," he said. "Last week
UCLA gave us the pass.
Washington gave us the run, so
we took it."
Touchdown drives
Although Stanford's total of
115 yards rushing wasn't exactly
overwhelming, the Cards' run
ning game did help sustain some
long touchdown drives.
Sophomore Phil Francis led
Stanford with 54 yards on only
eight carries. He also caught pas
ses of 13 and 20 yards, both lead
ing to Stanford touchdowns.
Don Stevenson had another
solid game, gaining 52 yards on
12 carries.
If the Cards ran a little better
than expected, Washington pas
sed better than expected.
After the Huskies got behind
27-7 with two minutes left in the
third quarter, they had to scrap
their impressive running game
in favor of the pass. At that point,
it looked as if Stanford had it
made because Warren Moon is not
regarded highly as a passer.
Moon surprised his critics by
drilling some passes and leading

Leading rusher
Stanford running back Phil Francis outruns Washington defender Rudy Moraga . Francis
came off the bench to gain 54 yards on eight carries.
Washington to touchdown
drives of 80, 71 and 55 yards.
The Husky quarterback finished
the day with 15 completions in
28 attempts for 209 yards and
two touchdowns. He had one
pass intercepted by Stanford
linebacker Ray Cardinalli in the
second quarter.
Washington also ran well,
which wasn't surprising. The
Huskies gained 204 yards on the
ground, which is actually a little
below their average. Halfback
Ron Rowland led all rushers
with 66 yards on 16 rushes.
Robin Earl, who weighs a husky
250 pounds, rumbled for 64
yards on 15 carries.
Freshman Joe Steele, who
started for Rowland, was killing
the Cards on the ground in the
first quarter, but had to leave the
game after taking a shot in the
head.
One of the Huskies' problems

was that they stopped their own
drives with fumbles and penal
ties. On one series in the second
quarter, Rowland ran for 17
yards. Earl for 11, and
Washington was penalized both
times. The Huskies were run
ning all over Stanford on their
first drive after halftime, but a
clipping call put an end to that
threat.
Maybe Washington had
watched Stanford game films a
bit too intently.
Cardinal notes: Hill re
sprained the ankle he hurt in the
fymn State game late in the third
quarter...He did not return to ac
tion, but the injury is not thought
to be serious...Hill still caught
five passes for 91 yards.
Stanford middle linebacker
Gordy Ceresino was in on more
than twice as many tackles an
anyone on either team...Ceresino
was credited with 17 tackles and
four assists.
