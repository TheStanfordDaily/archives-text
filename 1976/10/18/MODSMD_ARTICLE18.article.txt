# Benjamin: Husky defense took cheap shots at him
## 
### Chris Baker 
When Washington visited Stanford Stadium
two years ago, the most oft heard comment in the
Card dressing room was that the Huskies were the
dirtiest team Stanford had ever faced.
After Saturday, quarterback Guy Benjamin is a
believer.
Benjamin watched from the sidelines as Mike
Cordova ran out the clock to secure a 34-28 victory
over Washigton. But the "great quarterback de
bate" hasn't started again.
The junior quarterback was ejected, with 1:20
remaining in the game, for slugging Husky defen
sive tackle Stan Walderhaug. "We play San Jose,
Washington and UCLA and people are always
hitting you late," said Benjamin.
'Violence'
"Violence is big this year — knocking quarter
backs out of the game in the NFL and college
football. You have a lot of holding calls, but that's
just my offensive line trying to protect me."
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen doesn't like to
see his quarterback trying to imitate Muhammad
Ali. Especially when he uses his passing hand.
"Every time a guy made a tackle he was giving
Benjamin a little extra,"said Christiansen. "Guy
finally got a little tired of it.
"On the play where it happened, Guy was try
ing to get out of bounds. He had one foot out and
then the guy (Walderhaug) drove him out of
bounds. It's okay to push him out, but not all the
other stuff that went along with it," said Chris.
Benjamin didn't blame the officials for not cal
ling roughing the passer. "It's a tough call — a

judgment call. But you've got to get violence out
of football," said Benjamin.
"On the play where it happened, I was trying to
get out of bounds and he (Walderhaug) drove me
into the ground. My punching him isn't going to
stop anything. It's a Catch-22 situation."
Before he was kicked out of the contest Benja
min managed to complete 14 of 22 passes for 270
yards and a touchdown. He also ran in two more
touchdowns.
'Super game'
"Overall, I thought Guy played a super game,"
said Christiansen. "He threw the ball well and
called some super audibles. We gave him some
help once in a while."
Christiansen was having flashbacks of Stan
ford's last two games, when Washington closed to
six points in the closing minutes of the game.
"It was really scary in the fourth quarter. Those
things start happening and then it all starts com
ing back to you. You look up at the scoreboard and
start thinking..," said Christiansen.
Washington quarterback Warren Moon, who
directed the Huskies to 21 points in the fourth
quarter, was thinking about an upset. "This was a
key game for us. Last year we would have been in
the Rose Bowl if we had beaten Stanford," said
Moon. "I just hope it doesn't come down to that
again.
"We practice playing catch up every
don't think Stanford was in good shape. We jest
ran out of time."
Hmm...Sounds just like what Washington
players said two years ago.

Benjamin didn't blame the officials for not cal
ling roughing the passer. "It's a tough call — a

judgment call. But you've got to get violence out
of football," said Benjamin.
"On the play where it happened, I was trying to
get out of bounds and he (Walderhaug) drove me
into the ground. My punching him isn't going to
stop anything. It's a Catch-22 situation."
Before he was kicked out of the contest Benja
min managed to complete 14 of 22 passes for 270
yards and a touchdown. He also ran in two more
touchdowns.
'Super game'
"Overall, I thought Guy played a super game,"
said Christiansen. "He threw the ball well and
called some super audibles. We gave him some
help once in a while."
Christiansen was having flashbacks of Stan
ford's last two games, when Washington closed to
six points in the closing minutes of the game.
"It was really scary in the fourth quarter. Those
things start happening and then it all starts com
ing back to you. You look up at the scoreboard and
start thinking..," said Christiansen.
Washington quarterback Warren Moon, who
directed the Huskies to 21 points in the fourth
quarter, was thinking about an upset. "This was a
key game for us. Last year we would have been in
the Rose Bowl if we had beaten Stanford," said
Moon. "I just hope it doesn't come down to that
again.
"We practice playing catch up every
don't think Stanford was in good shape. We jest
ran out of time."
Hmm...Sounds just like what Washington
players said two years ago.
When Washington visited Stanford Stadium
two years ago, the most oft heard comment in the
Card dressing room was that the Huskies were the
dirtiest team Stanford had ever faced.
After Saturday, quarterback Guy Benjamin is a
believer.
Benjamin watched from the sidelines as Mike
Cordova ran out the clock to secure a 34-28 victory
over Washigton. But the "great quarterback de
bate" hasn't started again.
The junior quarterback was ejected, with 1:20
remaining in the game, for slugging Husky defen
sive tackle Stan Walderhaug. "We play San Jose,
Washington and UCLA and people are always
hitting you late," said Benjamin.
'Violence'
"Violence is big this year — knocking quarter
backs out of the game in the NFL and college
football. You have a lot of holding calls, but that's
just my offensive line trying to protect me."
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen doesn't like to
see his quarterback trying to imitate Muhammad
Ali. Especially when he uses his passing hand.
"Every time a guy made a tackle he was giving
Benjamin a little extra,"said Christiansen. "Guy
finally got a little tired of it.
"On the play where it happened, Guy was try
ing to get out of bounds. He had one foot out and
then the guy (Walderhaug) drove him out of
bounds. It's okay to push him out, but not all the
other stuff that went along with it," said Chris.
