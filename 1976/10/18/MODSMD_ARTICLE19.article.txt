# Sandoval finishes second
## Irvine wins 'invitational' 
### Bruce Anderson 
UC-Irvine's Ralph Serna outkicked Stanford
graduate Tony Sandoval, over the last 600 met
ers, to capture the individual title and lead his
Anteater teammates to victory Saturday, in the
Stanford Invitational cross country meet.
Serna, the defending NCAA Division II cross
country champion, finished the new, 10,000-
meter course at the Stanford Golf Course with a
time of 32:32.2.
Serna and Sandoval ran together for most of
the last three miles with Long Beach State's
Rich McCanless hard on their heels.
But Sandoval, who said he has only trained
seriously for two weeks and is still out of
shape, could not match strides with Serna
when the Irvine sophomore went into his kick
at the end of the race.
Second place
Sandoval, who journeyed from New Mexico
to run with the West Valley Track Club,
nudged McCanless for second place.
"I didn't want him (McCanless) to catch me
and I didn't want to kick," Sandoval said. Last
year's Pacific-8 10,000-meter champion
finished less than a second ahead of McCan
less.
Displaying the depth that enabled Irvine to
take the Division II team crown in 1975, Ser
na's teammates Eric Hulst and Steve Scott
finished fourth and fifth, respectively, to help
the Anteaters lay claim to the team trophy.
Mike Boit, former world record holder at 800
meters and now a graduate student at Stanford,
finished ninth, running unattached.

Serna's winning time was also a course re
cord on the course, which cross country coach
Marshall Clark didn't finish laying out until
Friday night.
The new course is slightly longer than the
old, six-mile course and the consensus was
that the new route is more difficult than its
predecessor.
"I liked the course," Serna said. "I was hurt
ing a little after the long hill at about 3Vz
miles." But aches aside, Serna finished the
course with a sprint.
"I like the course longer," Sandoval said.
"The hills are longer on this course and I do
well on the hills."
Sandoval also commented on the Stanford
team saying, the Cardinals looked "young and
not too experienced in big races," but appeared
to be "rounding out pretty well."
Stanford finished fifth in the nine-team field
Saturday, behind Irvine (40 points), West Val
ley (63), Fresno State (114) and Long Beach
State (122) with a score of 126.
'Close'
"We'd have loved to done better when we
were that close to Fresno and Long Beach,"
Clark said.
The Stanford mentor said Frank Boutin ran
particularly well, finishing 19th after having
been last after the first mile.
Stanford's women's team finished second in
the women's Stanford Invitational race behind
UC-Davis, as Judy Graham of San Jose State
won the three-mile race in 18:51.2. Stanford's
Ann Thrupp finished second in the field of 40
with a time of 18:56.4.


Sandy returns
Wea'ring a West Valley Track Club jersey, instead of the
familiar Stanford cardinal and white, Tony Sandoval de
monstrated Saturday that he still knows how to burn his way
around the Stanford Golf Course.
