## 
### Jim Tranquada 
Six campus organizations and
Pacific Life Community are sponsor
ing Trident Concern Week beginning
tonight in an attempt to call attention
to the dangers posed by the Trident
submarine nuclear weapons system.
The Trident program represents an
effort by the United States to achieve
an effective nuclear first-strike capa
bility, according to Wayne Sachs, a
member of the campus affiliate of
Pacific Life Community (PLC).
Arrangements are currently in prog
ress towards preparing a site in
Washington on Puget Sound for the
construction of Trident submarine
pens, he said.
As the first event of Trident Concern
Week, Frederick Douglass Kirkpatrick,
a folksinger and National Black As
sembly candidate for president will
speak tonight at 7:30 in Tresidder large
lounge. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in Tre
sidder large lounge, an international
panel of PLC members will discuss al
ternatives to Trident and military
spending. A film on Hiroshima will be
shown Wednesday, at 8:30 p.m., at
Bechtel International Center, followed
by comments and discussion by a
panel which includes several bomb
survivors.
The final event of Trident Concern
Week will be a speech Friday at 3:30
p.m. in Kresge Auditorium by Mary
Kaufman, former Antioch College law
professor, U.S. prosecutor at the
Nuremberg trials and an expert on in

ternational law, who will discuss the
alleged illegality of Trident under in
ternational law.
A focus on militarism
Sachs, who helped organize Trident
Concern Week here, said, "On one
level, opposing Trident is a way to
focus on militarism and on military
spending, and the way it positively
harms all of us.
"On a greater level, Trident Concern
Week is focusing on presenting values
that affirm life instead of death, human
needs and non-violent activism," he
said.
PLC, an organization created to
promote peace and a human commun
ity on a local as well as a national and
an international level, is a group of
experienced Canadian, Japanese and
American peace activists who came
together under the impetus of the an
nouncement of Trident, according to
Sachs.
"Our concern is that the Trident
program both politically and militarily
destabilizes international relations,
that it is strategically unnecessary, and
the fact that it is an act of implicit ag
gression against all people of the
world, including citizens of the U. 5.,"
said Sachs.
The program is being sponsored by
the Tresidder Memorial Union Prog
ram Board, Memorial Church. Colum
bae house, the ASSU Council of Presi
dents, the Office of Student Activities
and the Wednesday program of
Bechtel International Center.

tonight in an attempt to call attention
to the dangers posed by the Trident
submarine nuclear weapons system.
The Trident program represents an
effort by the United States to achieve
an effective nuclear first-strike capa
bility, according to Wayne Sachs, a
member of the campus affiliate of
Pacific Life Community (PLC).
Arrangements are currently in prog
ress towards preparing a site in
Washington on Puget Sound for the
construction of Trident submarine
pens, he said.
As the first event of Trident Concern

sidder large lounge, an international

ternational law, who will discuss the
alleged illegality of Trident under in
ternational law.
A focus on militarism
Sachs, who helped organize Trident
Concern Week here, said, "On one
level, opposing Trident is a way to
focus on militarism and on military
spending, and the way it positively
harms all of us.
"On a greater level, Trident Concern
Week is focusing on presenting values
that affirm life instead of death, human
needs and non-violent activism," he
said.
PLC, an organization created to
promote peace and a human commun
ity on a local as well as a national and
an international level, is a group of
experienced Canadian, Japanese and
American peace activists who came
together under the impetus of the an
nouncement of Trident, according to
Sachs.
"Our concern is that the Trident
program both politically and militarily
destabilizes international relations,
that it is strategically unnecessary, and
the fact that it is an act of implicit ag
gression against all people of the
world, including citizens of the U. 5.,"
said Sachs.
The program is being sponsored by
the Tresidder Memorial Union Prog
ram Board, Memorial Church. Colum
bae house, the ASSU Council of Presi
dents, the Office of Student Activities
and the Wednesday program of
Bechtel International Center.
