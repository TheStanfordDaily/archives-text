# UCLA routs hapless Washington State
## 
### Marko Fong 
The Pacific-8 Rose Bowl race
started to take shape this
weekend and that shape is look
ing more and more like a UCLA
Bruin.
Playing in Los Angeles, the
Bruins won coach Terry
Donahue a lifetime membership
in Bo Schembechler's National
Society of Merciless Slaughter
ers, killing Washington State
62-3.
Quarterback Jeff Dankworth
threw for two touchdowns and
ran for another, to stake UCLA to
a 28-0 first-quarter lead.
The best measure of the game,
is the fact that UCLA had three
times as many rushing attempts
(72) as the Cougars had rushing
yards (23).
The Bruin defense picked off
six WSU passes to give UCLA 11

interceptions in its last two
games. Halfback Wendell Tyler,
possibly college football's most
efficient running back the last
two years, had 106 yards and two
touchdowns on 11 carries.
Up in Corvallis, Oregon State
ruined its chances for an all
defeated season, by hurting
Cal's chances for a Rose Bowl
trip, 10-9.
The Beaver defense bottled up
the Bears, who entered the game
as the third-ranked offense in the
nation. OSU came up with three
interceptions, while Cal was
penalized 172 yards.
Oregon State's offense was
less than awesome, as it man
aged to gnaw for less than 168
total yards and two pass recep
tions — one less than its defen
sive backfield.
The Beaver offense accounted

for the only touchdown of the
game — a one-yard run by James
Fields, which capped a 65-yard
fourth-quarter touchdown drive.
Even though second-string
quarterback Fred Besana padded
his impressive stats with a six
for eight passing performance,
Mike White's biggest worry isn't
the loss.
White will probably lose some
sleep over a knee injury suf
fered by quarterback Joe Roth in
the final quarter. The Bears
didn't start winning until Roth
took over last year. The senior
signal-caller has been their
spiritual, as well as passing
leader.
Since Ricky Bell carried the
ball enough for two games last
week, USC had the weekend off.
The Trojans are locked in a first
place tie with the Bruins.

In the only other contest in
volving a Pac-8 team, Oregon
became Notre Dame's third
shutout victim of the season,
41-0.
The Ducks didn't get a first
down until late in the first half.
Al Hunter had three touchdowns
for the Irish.
The only thing Duck coach
Don Read was pleased about,
was that this was the first and
last time the Ducks will take on
Notre Dame.
