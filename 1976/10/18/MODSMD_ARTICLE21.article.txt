Poloists win two
With a schedule where every
game counts toward a possible
NCAA playoff berth, the Stan
ford waterpolo team swept last
weekend's crucial two-game set
with wins over Long Beach
State, 7-6, and UC-Irvine, 8-5.
"Every game counts for us,"
said waterpolo coach Art
Lambert, whose Cards are now
3-2.
Against Irvine, the Cards had
what Lambert termed "the most
outstanding performance that
I've ever had by one of my
goalies."
Chris Dorst, who had been
burned by the Aggies for eight
goals in the Cards' opening loss
to UCI, came back to block four
penalty shots and preserve the
three goal victory.
The night before, the Cards,
looking much like the Stanford
football team, jumped out to a
4-1 lead before the half, but had
to score three goals in the final
period for a 7-6 win over Long
Beach State.

Taft College handed the Stan
ford JV's a 31-21 season-opening
loss Friday afternoon in Stanford

Stadium.
Taft, one of the state's top
small colleges, had an edge over
the Cards before the contest even
started. Taft entered the game
with a perfect (4-0) record.
Card coach Don Frease didn't
use Taft's experience as an ex
cuse for the loss. "We missed
some key tackles. Taft's offense
was really hard to defend, espe
cially Maxie O'Kelley," said
Frease.
The running back scored on a
5-yard run to cap Taft's opening
drive of the first quarter. O'Kel
ley finished with 49 yards on 14
carries.

"Taft kept the ball on the
ground until late in the fourth
quarter," said Frease. "Then,
when they put the ball in the air
it was obvious they didn't have
anyone who could pass the ball
worth a darn."
Stanford had trouble in the air
too. Quarterback Joe
Rominger, who led the Cards
throughout the game, completed
just 4 of 17 passes for 60 yards
and one touchdown.
"We showed a lot of en
thusiasm," said Frease. "The
guys were frustrated after the
game. We knew we could have
beaten them."
