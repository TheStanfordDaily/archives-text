# Women booters down Cal, 6-1

### Mark Funk 
Scoring three goals in the
first half, the Stanford wo
men's soccer team coasted to
an easy 6-1 win over
California at Harry
Maloney Field.
The Cards were rarely pres
sured by the Golden Bears as
they ran their season record to
2-1.
The game served as a
showcase for the talents of
Cindy Shorney, Ellen Griep
and Maria Duryea.
Displaying a balanced of
fensive attack accentuated
by quick movement of the
ball, Shorney and Griep split
the California defense time
and again in the first half.
The Bears adjusted early in
the game for Griep, who was
Stanford's leading scorer
last year. When she carried
the ball into the California
goal area, she attracted a host
of yellow-shirted defenders.
It opened up the middle for
Shorney, who made numer
ous runs for the goal from her
center halfback position.
She put Stanford on the
board early in the first half
after Griep sent a centering
pass into the California goal
mouth. The freshman from
Wheaton, 111., tucked theball
into the net from five yards.
"I told my players before
the game started that Cindy
should score all our goals if
the offense was working,"
said Card coach Phil Wright.
And work it did. Shorney and

Griep accounted for all six
goals on the day.
Stanford's superiority in
its forward line was matched
by an airtight defense.
Duryea spent most of the af
ternoon thwarting an aggres
sive California offense. From
her sweeper position, she
controlled the tempo of the
Card defense and forced the
Bears out of the middle of the
field.
With Duryea patrolling the
center, California had no
choice but to attack from its
wings. The tactic was unsuc
cessful until late in the game.

The Bears mounted their
most serious threat after Stan
ford's first goal. With some
crisp passing and sloppy
midfield play by the Cards,
Cal dominated the contest for
one five-minute stretch.
They got two shots on goal
during that period.
It ended when Griep beat
the California goalie from 10
yards out, after Stanford
broke out quickly from the
midfield.
The Cards spent the rest of
the first half applying pres
sure around the California
goalmouth. A beautiful save

by the Bear goalie one-on-one
against Griep, robbed the Bel
levue, Wash., sophomore of a
second goal.
Shorney broke the game
open three-fourths of the way
through the first half when
she hit on her second goal of
the afternoon. She scored a
hat trick early in the second
half and added a fourth goal
late in the contest.
The Cards will play six
more games during the fall
season before breaking for
winter. They will resume
competition again this spring
with a full schedule.
