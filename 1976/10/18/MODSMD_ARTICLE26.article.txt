Tremor shakes Los Angeles
Los Angeles — A moderate earthquake has jolted
this area just days after the dedication of a huge new
Veterans Administration hospital which replaced
one destroyed in the killer 1971 earthquake.
A spokesman for the Caltech Seismological
Laboratory in Pasadena said Saturday night's quake
registered 4.0 on the Richter scale and was centered
about eight miles northeast of Newhall, in the same
San Fernando area devastated by the 6.5 magnitude
quake Feb. 9,1971. That tremor claimed more than
60 lives and destroyed three hospitals, including
the one officially replaced last Monday.
Last April, a Caltech professor predicted on the
basis of still unproven theories that an earthquake
of magnitude 5.5 to 6.5 would hit the San Fernando
area within a year.

China conducts nuclear test
Tokyo — The Chinese news agency Hsinhua said
China exploded an underground nuclear device
yesterday, its 19th test blast since 1964. Theagency
did not give any details of the blast.
China's last nuclear test on Sept. 26 was con
ducted above ground and produced radioactive
fallout that went halfway around the world.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in
Washington said air monitoring stations in
Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut and Mas
sachusetts detected radioactive fallout from that
atmospheric test. Hut the amounts of fallout were
too small to pose a threat to public health, the EPA
said.
As in announcements of past tests, Hsinhua said
Sunday's explosion was conducted for defensive
purposes and China would not be the first to use
nuclear weapons.
Polls give Carter electoral lead
Chicago — Two national surveys released yes
terday showed Democratic presidential candidate
Jimmy Carter ahead in electoral votes, although by
differing margins.

Time magazine's latest survey, not radically
changed from the last one a week ago, showed
Carter ahead in 23 states with 280 electoral votes,
10 more than needed to win the election. President
Gerald Ford was ahead in 17 states with 129 elec
toral votes.
Time's survey said Carter was ahead in the criti
cal states of New York, Florida and Massachusetts,
with Ford leading comfortably in his home state of
Michigan and narrowly ahead in Ohio. California
and Illinois were among 10 states too close to call,
Time said.
Newhouse newspapers and the Chicago Duily
News showed Carter had halted some earlier slip
page in potential electoral votes. The report said
Carter now could expect 218 electoral votes and
Ford 87, with 233 in the undecided category.
Recovery lag confuses economists
New York — The economy is giving off confus
ing signals as it takes a pause in the midst of recov
ery.
Growth hasn't stopped, but the pace of growth
has slowed in recent months, businessmen and
economists say.
A high level economist involved in government
forecasting privately conceded, "We're all sur
prised it has gone on this long, but I don't expect the
recovery to pick up again for at least another quar
ter. Some say two."
Many economists agree that the stubborn pause
in economic growth which developed late this
summer could last for months. They say the dura
tion will depend largely on the 1977 capital spend
ing plans that corporations will announce in
November and December, and the shape of the con
struction industry next spring.
Syria accused of sabotage
Beirut. Lebanon — The Palestinian guerrilla
command accused Syrian forces yesterday of shel
ling an embattled resort town east of Beirut to
sabotage the Arab summit seeking to end fighting
in Lebanon.

In turn, right-wing Lebanese Christians, backed
by Syrians in their battle with Moslem Lebanese
leftists and Palestinians, charged in a radio broad
cast that radical guerrillas were firing at both sides
to upset the summit.
Other sources speculated the night shelling may
have been the work of Christian gunners because
some extremist Christians want no agreement until
Syrian troops have crushed the guerrillas in Leba
non.
Reds win again
Cincinnati — Tony Perez delivered a two-out
single in the bottom of the ninth inning last night,
driving home Ken Griffey with Cincinnati's win
ning run as the Reds nipped the New York Yankees
4-3 to take the second game of the 1976 World
Series.
The victory gave the Reds a 2-0 edge in the best
of-seven series which continues tomorrow night in
New York.

China exploded an underground nuclear device
yesterday, its 19th test blast since 1964. Theagency
did not give any details of the blast.
China's last nuclear test on Sept. 26 was con
ducted above ground and produced radioactive
fallout that went halfway around the world.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in
Washington said air monitoring stations in
Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut and Mas
sachusetts detected radioactive fallout from that
atmospheric test. Hut the amounts of fallout were
too small to pose a threat to public health, the EPA
said.
As in announcements of past tests, Hsinhua said
Sunday's explosion was conducted for defensive
purposes and China would not be the first to use
nuclear weapons.
Polls give Carter electoral lead
Chicago — Two national surveys released yes
terday showed Democratic presidential candidate
Jimmy Carter ahead in electoral votes, although by
differing margins.

Time magazine's latest survey, not radically
changed from the last one a week ago, showed
Carter ahead in 23 states with 280 electoral votes,
10 more than needed to win the election. President
Gerald Ford was ahead in 17 states with 129 elec
toral votes.
Time's survey said Carter was ahead in the criti
cal states of New York, Florida and Massachusetts,
with Ford leading comfortably in his home state of
Michigan and narrowly ahead in Ohio. California
and Illinois were among 10 states too close to call,
Time said.
Newhouse newspapers and the Chicago Duily
News showed Carter had halted some earlier slip
page in potential electoral votes. The report said
Carter now could expect 218 electoral votes and
Ford 87, with 233 in the undecided category.
Recovery lag confuses economists
New York — The economy is giving off confus
ing signals as it takes a pause in the midst of recov
ery.
Growth hasn't stopped, but the pace of growth
has slowed in recent months, businessmen and
economists say.
A high level economist involved in government
forecasting privately conceded, "We're all sur
prised it has gone on this long, but I don't expect the
recovery to pick up again for at least another quar
ter. Some say two."
Many economists agree that the stubborn pause
in economic growth which developed late this
summer could last for months. They say the dura
tion will depend largely on the 1977 capital spend
ing plans that corporations will announce in
November and December, and the shape of the con
struction industry next spring.
Syria accused of sabotage
Beirut. Lebanon — The Palestinian guerrilla
command accused Syrian forces yesterday of shel
ling an embattled resort town east of Beirut to
sabotage the Arab summit seeking to end fighting
in Lebanon.

In turn, right-wing Lebanese Christians, backed
by Syrians in their battle with Moslem Lebanese
leftists and Palestinians, charged in a radio broad
cast that radical guerrillas were firing at both sides
to upset the summit.
Other sources speculated the night shelling may
have been the work of Christian gunners because
some extremist Christians want no agreement until
Syrian troops have crushed the guerrillas in Leba
non.
Reds win again
Cincinnati — Tony Perez delivered a two-out
single in the bottom of the ninth inning last night,
driving home Ken Griffey with Cincinnati's win

4-3 to take the second game of the 1976 World
Series.
The victory gave the Reds a 2-0 edge in the best
of-seven series which continues tomorrow night in
New York.

Tremor shakes Los Angeles
Los Angeles — A moderate earthquake has jolted
this area just days after the dedication of a huge new
Veterans Administration hospital which replaced
one destroyed in the killer 1971 earthquake.
A spokesman for the Caltech Seismological
Laboratory in Pasadena said Saturday night's quake
registered 4.0 on the Richter scale and was centered
about eight miles northeast of Newhall, in the same
San Fernando area devastated by the 6.5 magnitude
quake Feb. 9,1971. That tremor claimed more than
60 lives and destroyed three hospitals, including
the one officially replaced last Monday.
Last April, a Caltech professor predicted on the
basis of still unproven theories that an earthquake
of magnitude 5.5 to 6.5 would hit the San Fernando
area within a year.

Time magazine's latest survey, not radically
changed from the last one a week ago, showed
Carter ahead in 23 states with 280 electoral votes,
10 more than needed to win the election. President
Gerald Ford was ahead in 17 states with 129 elec
toral votes.
Time's survey said Carter was ahead in the criti
cal states of New York, Florida and Massachusetts,
with Ford leading comfortably in his home state of
Michigan and narrowly ahead in Ohio. California
and Illinois were among 10 states too close to call,
Time said.
Newhouse newspapers and the Chicago Duily
News showed Carter had halted some earlier slip
page in potential electoral votes. The report said
Carter now could expect 218 electoral votes and
Ford 87, with 233 in the undecided category.
Recovery lag confuses economists
New York — The economy is giving off confus
ing signals as it takes a pause in the midst of recov
ery.
Growth hasn't stopped, but the pace of growth
has slowed in recent months, businessmen and
economists say.
A high level economist involved in government
forecasting privately conceded, "We're all sur
prised it has gone on this long, but I don't expect the
recovery to pick up again for at least another quar
ter. Some say two."
Many economists agree that the stubborn pause
in economic growth which developed late this
summer could last for months. They say the dura
tion will depend largely on the 1977 capital spend
ing plans that corporations will announce in
November and December, and the shape of the con
struction industry next spring.
Syria accused of sabotage
Beirut. Lebanon — The Palestinian guerrilla
command accused Syrian forces yesterday of shel
ling an embattled resort town east of Beirut to
sabotage the Arab summit seeking to end fighting
in Lebanon.

In turn, right-wing Lebanese Christians, backed
by Syrians in their battle with Moslem Lebanese
leftists and Palestinians, charged in a radio broad
cast that radical guerrillas were firing at both sides
to upset the summit.
Other sources speculated the night shelling may
have been the work of Christian gunners because
some extremist Christians want no agreement until
Syrian troops have crushed the guerrillas in Leba
non.
Reds win again
Cincinnati — Tony Perez delivered a two-out

Series.
The victory gave the Reds a 2-0 edge in the best
of-seven series which continues tomorrow night in

Tremor shakes Los Angeles
Los Angeles — A moderate earthquake has jolted
this area just days after the dedication of a huge new
Veterans Administration hospital which replaced
one destroyed in the killer 1971 earthquake.
A spokesman for the Caltech Seismological
Laboratory in Pasadena said Saturday night's quake
registered 4.0 on the Richter scale and was centered
about eight miles northeast of Newhall, in the same
San Fernando area devastated by the 6.5 magnitude
quake Feb. 9,1971. That tremor claimed more than
60 lives and destroyed three hospitals, including
the one officially replaced last Monday.
Last April, a Caltech professor predicted on the
basis of still unproven theories that an earthquake
of magnitude 5.5 to 6.5 would hit the San Fernando
area within a year.

China conducts nuclear test
Tokyo — The Chinese news agency Hsinhua said
China exploded an underground nuclear device
yesterday, its 19th test blast since 1964. Theagency
did not give any details of the blast.
China's last nuclear test on Sept. 26 was con
ducted above ground and produced radioactive
fallout that went halfway around the world.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in
Washington said air monitoring stations in
Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut and Mas
sachusetts detected radioactive fallout from that
atmospheric test. Hut the amounts of fallout were
too small to pose a threat to public health, the EPA
said.
As in announcements of past tests, Hsinhua said
Sunday's explosion was conducted for defensive
purposes and China would not be the first to use
nuclear weapons.
