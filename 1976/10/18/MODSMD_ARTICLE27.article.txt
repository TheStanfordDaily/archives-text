"We try to please all of the students,
some of the time." maintains Lois
Ohms, test kitchen dietician for the
Food Service. Student taste panels are
one method employed by Ohms for as
certaining student preferences on new
products and maintaining a quality
check on new and old menu items.
During the Thursday panel meet
ings at the Food Service offices, 20
students taste new products on the
market and sample new recipes pre
pared by Ohms in the test kitchen. The
products and recipes are rated inde
pendently by the students during the
hour meeting. An item that is well
liked is prepared in larger quantities
for one residence hall. If reaction is
good in this trial dorm. Ohms integ
rates the item into the Food Service

menu.
"Feeding 3400 students per meal
with tastes as varied as their
backgrounds takes considerable plan
ning." Ohms said. The Food Service
office welcomes student opinions,
said Ohms.
Student taste panels, coupled with
various residence hall food committes,
provide the necessary student feed
back to keep the Food Service current
with the needs and desires of the stu
dent consumers.
The taste panels were organized by
Ohms six years ago in order to estab
lish a direct link with student
preferences.
"We like to have 20 different stu
dents for every panel to assure the
widest spectrum of student opinion,"
said Ohms.
An example of change motivated by
the taste panel concerned the "All-
American" staple, peanut butter. Stu
dents on the panel were asked to rate
six brands of peanut butter, including
the presently used brand. Skippy
brand was the favorite, and chunky
style was preferred to smooth. Now,
7000 pounds of Skippy peanut butter
are consumed each year by students
here.
Peanut butter is not a subject of
burning concern to most students, but
it is an example of the brand compari
sons and checks Ohms is continually
trying at the Thursday panel meetings.
Communication is frequent and
open between the Food Service and
student consumers. Verbal feedback
generated by hall representatives at
the residence hall food committee
meetings is listened to by the Food
Service managers in every residence,
according to Ohms.
Students interested in participating
in a taste panel are invited to sign up at
the Food Service office or call Ohms at
497-4751.
