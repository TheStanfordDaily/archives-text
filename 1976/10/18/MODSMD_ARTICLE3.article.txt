# Negotiators agree on union contract

### Pan Demetrakakes 
Negotiators from the university and
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union have agreed on a contract pac
kage to be presented to union members
for ratification, they announced yes
terday.
USE's membership will vote on the
package tomorrow, at a location yet to
be announced.
USE officials declined to comment
on provisions of the package.
About 400 workers had staged two
spontaneous walkouts Friday after
noon, complaining of a lack of respon
siveness on the part of management.
University chief negotiator Douglas
Barton denied that the walkouts had
affected the university's negotiating
position.
Two walkouts
On Friday, over 300 workers at the
Stanford Linear Accelearator Center
(SLAC) walked out in protest of al
legedly racist and sexist treatment of
nine SLAC technicians, while about 80
Plant Services workers left their jobs
because, they said, Plant Services Di
rector Jason Mavis had declined to
meet with them all at the same time.
The two walkouts were apparently
unrelated.
John Leung, union steward for Plant
Services, said that the Plant Services
workers would return to their jobs to
day. "We're not interested in shutting
down the university," he said.
'Individual decision*
Roger Hardy, president of USE, said
the same of the SLAC workers. "It's an
individual decision, but I imagine
they'll be back," he said.
Hardy said that the trouble at SLAC
started when nine technicians .com
plained to Acting Director Richard
Neal that their job classification was a
lower one than they deserved.
"They've been misclassified on ra
cist or sexist grounds for a number of
years," Hardy alleged.
Hardy said Neal's response was un
satisfactory, prompting SLAC's elec
tricians to walk out, according to
Hardy.
After that, "the whole thing sort of
blossomed," Hardy commented. By

Friday afternoon, about two-thirds of
SLAC's day shift had left their jobs.
"Lack of responsiveness"
Leung said that the Plant Services
workers staged their walkout because
"we just got fed up with Mavis's lack of
responsiveness."
The Plant Services workers were re
cently divided into four "depart
ments" of about 25 workers each, and
Mavis has declined to meet with more
than one department at a time.
"We specifically asked that we all
meet together, and we promised to be
orderly. Mavis refused," Leung said.
In a conversation with Director of
Personnel Robert Parker in front of Old
Pavilion, Plant Services workers
claimed that the "department" ar
rangements was unsatisfactory.
"At four different meetings Mavis
comes up with four different answers
and it strains his credibility," one
worker told Parker.
Another worker added, "VVe just
want one group so that we can get the
same answers to the same questions."
Complaints to Mavis
Parker replied, "To say that the only
way he can meet with you is in one
large group, is unfair." However, he
said he would pass their complaints
along to Mavis.
A week ago, the Plant Services
workers issued a list of 28 grievances,
including layoffs and demotions of
Plant Services workers, the practice of
bringing in outside firms to do certain
kinds of maintenance work and the
lack of an apprenticeship program.
Union members have been working
without a contract since Sept. 16. The
previous two-year contract was
scheduled to expire Sept. 1, but was
extended by mutual agreement.
The union sent out a strike ballot late
in September, but fell short of the re
quired 2/3 majority required by union
bylaws for a strike. The tally was 538
members in favor of striking, 327 op
posed.
Talks continued until the impasse
was broken yesterday.


Walkout
About 80 Plant Services workers settled down
on the steps of Encina Hall Friday after walking
out to protest what one worker termed "lack of

responsiveness" by Plant Services Director
Jason Mavis. Workers said Mavis denied their
request that all Plant Services departments be

workers said they would return to their jobs to
day.
