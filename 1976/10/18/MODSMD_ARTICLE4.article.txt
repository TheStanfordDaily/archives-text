# Hua Kuo-feng says he is new chairman
## Mao's widow hung in effigy 
### 
Hong Kong (AP) —Foreign officials coming out of
China said yesterday they saw wall posters in
Shanghai depicting the hanging in effigy of Mao
Tse-tung's widow and others showing one of the
demonstrations that have been reported in several
Chinese cities since Mao's death.
Prime Minister Michael Somare of Papua, New
Guinea, the first foreign government chief to visit
China since Mao died Sept. 9, also said at a news
conference that Premier Hua Kuo-feng told him he
had been chosen to succeed Mao as chairman of the
Chinese Communist party.
Members of Somare's delegation said that along
with the posters of Chiang Ching, Mao's 62 year-old
widow, were pictures of three other top Chinese
radical leaders with cross-marks painted over
them.

The posters were understood to be signs of dis
approval rather than an indication of the fate of the
four in the power struggle sweeping China.
Reports of arrests
Somare and his party arrived in Hong Kong on
their way home in the wake of unofficial reports
that the four radicals had been arrested. Crowds
reportedly demonstrated against the arrested radi
cal leaders in Shanghai, regarded as the center of
the radical support, and other Chinese cities.
Hua's election to the top post of party chairman
was first reported in wall posters in Peking on Oct.
9 and later confirmed to foreign reporters by a
Chinese government spokesman. However, the
government has never made an official announce
ment of the choice of Hua to head the party.
Peking has given no explanation for delaying the
announcement of the appointment. However, there

has been speculation the announcement was being
held up to permit Hua to consolidate his position
following a reported coup attempt and assassina
tion plot by party radicals led by Chiang Ching.
'I am embarrassed'
Somare said he heard nothing about the arrests of
Chiang Ching and her fellow radicals in Peking but
that he saw a demonstration and hundreds of wall
posters in Shanghai on Friday. A member of So
mare's delegation said he asked his interpreter for
an explanation of the posters and was told only, "I
am embarrassed."
The three crossed out figures shown with Chiang
Ching reportedly represented party Vice Chairman
Wang Hung-wen, 38, Vice Premier Chang Chun
chiao, 55, and Politburo member Yao Wen-yuan,
51. They were reported to have been the chief co
plotters with the widow.

plotters with the widow.
Hong Kong (AP) —Foreign officials coming out of
China said yesterday they saw wall posters in
Shanghai depicting the hanging in effigy of Mao
Tse-tung's widow and others showing one of the
demonstrations that have been reported in several
Chinese cities since Mao's death.
Prime Minister Michael Somare of Papua, New
Guinea, the first foreign government chief to visit
China since Mao died Sept. 9, also said at a news
conference that Premier Hua Kuo-feng told him he
had been chosen to succeed Mao as chairman of the
Chinese Communist party.
Members of Somare's delegation said that along
with the posters of Chiang Ching, Mao's 62 year-old
widow, were pictures of three other top Chinese
radical leaders with cross-marks painted over
them.

The posters were understood to be signs of dis
approval rather than an indication of the fate of the
four in the power struggle sweeping China.
Reports of arrests
Somare and his party arrived in Hong Kong on
their way home in the wake of unofficial reports
that the four radicals had been arrested. Crowds
reportedly demonstrated against the arrested radi
cal leaders in Shanghai, regarded as the center of
the radical support, and other Chinese cities.
Hua's election to the top post of party chairman
was first reported in wall posters in Peking on Oct.
9 and later confirmed to foreign reporters by a
Chinese government spokesman. However, the
government has never made an official announce
ment of the choice of Hua to head the party.
Peking has given no explanation for delaying the
announcement of the appointment. However, there

has been speculation the announcement was being
held up to permit Hua to consolidate his position
following a reported coup attempt and assassina
tion plot by party radicals led by Chiang Ching.
'I am embarrassed'
Somare said he heard nothing about the arrests of
Chiang Ching and her fellow radicals in Peking but
that he saw a demonstration and hundreds of wall
posters in Shanghai on Friday. A member of So
mare's delegation said he asked his interpreter for
an explanation of the posters and was told only, "I
am embarrassed."
The three crossed out figures shown with Chiang
Ching reportedly represented party Vice Chairman
Wang Hung-wen, 38, Vice Premier Chang Chun
chiao, 55, and Politburo member Yao Wen-yuan,
51. They were reported to have been the chief co
plotters with the widow.
