## No preference 
### 
In the big presidential race between
the Smiling Peanut and the Stumbling
Football, do you find yourself fer
vently for — neither of the above?
1, too, am having trouble deciding
whether to accept Jerry Ford's trans
cript from a two-year course in the
presidency, or whether to elect Jimmy
Carter to four years as poster child for
the American Dental Society.
My indecision has caused a family
crisis since I always tell my father how
to vote. Now, he is advising me on how
not to vote for either candidate. He has
just sent me the latest views on how to
join the ranks of "no preference."
Dear Daughter:
You remember me kicking about the
fact that we kickers had no place to
show our discontent except to stay
away from the polls and that there was
a great outcry about the apathy syn
drome, etc., and I had advanced the
theory like a voice crying in the wil
derness that if they wanted us to come
and use the ballot that "they" should
provide some place on the ballot for us
to express our discontent.
No preference
Well, according to your Uncle Dil,
putting a "no preference" on the ballot
has already been accomplished in
either a county in Nevada or in the
state of Nevada. He warns that this
news is unconfirmed. However, I
heard it from him and that is one reli
able source, and you are hearing it
from me, that makes two reliable
sources and you are hearing it — you
are certainly a reliable source — so that
adds up to the required three reliable
sources. (If you need any more, Fll ask
our two cats.)
Dil further amplifies the story to say
that there were six candidates on the
ballot and "no preference" got 40 per
cent of the votes cast. Naturally,
"they" do not know what to do with
the information.
At this juncture, the imaginative
forward thinker comes in. If the trend

to put "No Preference" on ballots con
tinues, 1 know what I would advise
some politically minded young
couple to do about it immediately; go
at once and have their names legally
changed from plain old "Smith" or
"Jones" or whatever to "Preference"
and then get busy on the marriage bed.
Their first born, if he be a boy, would
be christened "Nathan Oscar" and if
she be a girl, "Nancy Olive."
Yes, there would be tedious years of
diaper changing, feeding, graham
crackers, going through the rituals of
girls scouts, boy scouts, the traumas of
adolescence, the ups and downs of
high school and college, and finally,
entry into the political world.
Victory assured
From (hen on. things would begin to
happen with lightning rapidity as our
hero/heroine would get on the ballot as
"N O Preference." Election would be
assured every time his/her name ap
peared on the ballot.
And for every office, the candidate
would have a ready-made platform:
"N O Preference." You could see our
hero in today's situation speaking with
thundering evasive clarity: "They ac
cuse me of fuzziness, but I have spoken
for the last five months clearly and dis
tinctly on every issue — abortion, bus
ing, inflation, Kissinger, Butz, the
Pope, dirty stories, peanuts, lust, you
name it. You ask and I have but to point
to my platform and give you a clear
answer. I do not have to hide in the
White House nor in any oval office. My
answers are not oval. They are four
square. There is the platform as solid
as the Rock of Gibraltar: N O Prefer
ence."
Think it over. In fact, there may be
short cuts. I suppose you might adopt a
child and name it anything you want. I
don't care. I have no preference.
Love,
Dad
