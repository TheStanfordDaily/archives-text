Libertarianism. Sounds good, doesn't it? Former
Justice Douglas was a civil libertarian on the Sup
remeCourt. A libertarian must be in favor of liberty,
just as a Democrat must be in favor of democracy,
right?
To hear Bill Evers tell it in the Daily (Oct. 12), the
Libertarian party stands for "a drastic rollback in
taxes, repeal of victimless crime laws, strict respect
for civil liberties," and "a non-interventionist
foreign policy."
What enlightened person could be opposed to
these counterparts of yesteryear's motherhood and
applie pie? Who opposes lower taxes? Marijuana
busts are no longer popular, and Justice Douglas'
broad and courageous interpretations of the Bill of
Rights are held in wide esteem. American interven
tion in Vietnam-type civil wars is no longer popular
either. The Libertarian party platform seems solid
as a rock, and when you turn the rock over, you are
almost as pleased to see the words "a free market
economy."
In this wonderful Utopia of Adam Smith, Milton
Friedman, and Stanford's own George Schultz, all
business practices short of outright fraud would be
permitted without government interference. The
law of supply and demand would be the guiding
force of the economy, providing checks and ba
lances that would wipe out all economic injustices.
Businesses would be forced to keep their deal
ings honest, fair and just, or they would be driven
out of the marketplace by their competitors, all
honest of course. Regulation would be unnecessary
— the ugly ostrich of government could bury its
head forever in the sand of laissez-faire. This side of
the rock also appears very appealing.
Meddling
Former Republican Roger Macßride, the Liberta
rian Party presidential candidate, says the govern
ment has no right to meddle in any way in energy,
labor relations, medical care, Social Security, or
consumer protection (not even protection from
price-fixing). According to the standard Libertarian
or right wing lines (it is possible to tell them apart
with a magnifying glass), the "free market" will
solve all problems in these areas, without govern
ment interference, in the following ways:
1) Energy — increased energy costs will encour
aged private enterprise to develop more and newer
sources, and the competition will bring prices back
down. (Sounds like Gerald Ford, doesn't it? I told
you you needed a magnifying glass.) And after
power companies hike rates 200 percent, com
petitors will spring up overnight, after building
complex generation and transmission systems, and
offer lower prices. Competition will be so cutthroat
that it will never occur to industry giants to con
spire to fix prices.
2) Labor relations — repealed minimum wage

and child labor laws would allow employers to hire
more people after cutting wages (S.I. Hayakawa
must be a Libertarian too!) Don't worry though,
because this would drastically increase produc
tion, and hence the collective wealth, in which all
productive individuals would of course equitably
share. Wages wouldn't really be so bad (despite the
increased work force), because all this production
would create more jobs, and hence more competi
tion among employers for labor, resulting in higher
wages.
No negotiation
Also, there would be no need for federal or state
laws (like Proposition 14) requiring employers to
negotiate with unions. They could just "fire the
bastards" and hire armed guards to keep their angry
ex-employes out, just like in the bloody days of
Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover, prior to the
federal labor laws. (To this, a Libertarian might
counter that sometimes state police were used to
break up these strikes, and so it was interference in
the state that made things worse. But the police
were supposedly protecting employers' property
rights, and so were acting within powders which
would have been sanctioned even by Libertarians
of that period.)
In any event, all this would be unnecessary, be
cause the law of supply and demand would
stabilize the economy so well that all economic
injustices would be corrected.
3) Medical care — the high cost of health care
would suddenly decline in a free market, according
to Libertarians, because there would be no more
restrictions on who could practice medicine (re
sulting in sudden price competition). You wouldn't
have to go to med school or even college to become
a doctor.
Of course intelligent consumers of medical ser
vices would still go to the truly qualified prac
titioners, if they could tell who they were. Less
intelligent (or wealthy) individuals would have to
go to the snake oil salesmen, the radium beverage
cure-all promoters and the coat-hanger abor
tionists. Caveat Emptor!
Invisible hand .
In the event all medical practitioners were hon
est, competent and qualified, those who couldn't
afford the prices would have to do without. There
would be no Medicare, no government-funded
clinics, no government-sponsored health insur
ance for those who can't afford Blue Cross. But
Adam Smith's invisible hand would somehow pro
vide.
The FDA would be abolished. Roger Macßride
foresees non-profit panels of citizens who would
"report their findings to all of us." These panels
would also spring up overnight (like the competing
power companies) after putting together million

dollar laboratories. What would really happen
would be that the drug industry would use the
population as guinea pigs. Had things been
this way in the early sixties, such citizen panels
probably would have discovered the dangers of
Thalidomide — after interviewing the mothers of
thousands of deformed babies.
4) Welfare and social security — the Libertarian
fantasy world sees no need for these. In this Utopia
of no unemployment, all those who could work
would have a chance to do so, and everyone would
be encouraged to save money (if they had any left
over) for their old age. The blind and disabled,
unable to work, would be cared for by all the private
charities that would spring up to protect the power
less if the government weren't there.
5) Consumer protection — the government of the
Libertarians has no business protecting the con
sumer; that's the consumer's job. Consumers are
fair game to hucksters who deceive the buying pub
lic by any means short of bare-faced fraud. Fraud
involves lying (not necessarily omitting an essen
tial truth) about a product sold.
Shoddy merchandise
Consumer's would have to know in advance
about unsafe automobiles ("We didn't promise you
a safe car. You forgot to ask."), deceptive packag
ing, misleading advertising, shoddy merchandise,
highly flammable clothing, carcinogenic or
mutagenic drugs and food additives, rat-infested
apartments, one-sided leases, etc.
The "free" market, in which business and indus
try are free to do as they please without regard for
the individual lives irreversibly ruined or de
stroyed,is not the Utopian paradise in the minds of
irrational dreamers. But who said dreams have to
deal with reality? Libertarian proponents of the
so-called free market economy must fall into one of
three categories.
They either are irrational dreamers, or possibly
unthinking idealists wooed by the more palatable
ideas on civil liberties, foreign policy and victim
less crime laws. Or perhaps they are those who are
motivated by a callous disregard, or even hatred, of
those who are less fortunate, less sophisticated or
less able, for whatever reason, to help themselves.
One of these individuals has this to say about
racial discrimination: "We oppose any gov
ernmental attempts to regulate private discrimina
tion, including discrimination in employment,
housing, and privately owned so-called 'public' ac
comodations." Roger Macßride, the presidential
candidate who made this statement, is one of the
many ugly insects hiding under the Libertarian
rock.
