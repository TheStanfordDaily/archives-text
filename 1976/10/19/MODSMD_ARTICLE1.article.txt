# Burton Richter wins Nobel physics prize

Burton Richter, professor and
physicist at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC), yesterday
was named the co-winner of the 1976
Nohel Prize in physics for his discov
ery of Psi particles.
Richter shares the $160,00(1 award
with Samuel C.G. Ting, professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy. The two physicists first disco
vered the particle in their separate
laboratories in 1974. Richter labeled
the particle "Psi" and Ting called it
„r
At a press conference yesterday at
SLAC, Richter said his first reaction to
the news was, "You're kidding me."
He said United Press International
telephoned him at 3:50 a.m. and in
formed him of the news.
The Psi particle confirms theories
recently proposed about the nature of
subatomic particles and refutes
theories proposed in the 1960s. Rich
ter said he assumes the reason he won
the award was for the unusual proper
ties of the Psi particle.
Longer lifespan
The Psi is heavy, weighing more
than three times as much as a proton.
Under the earlier theories, the particle
would have a lifespan 10,000 times
shorter than Richter's experimental
evidence showed. The Psi survives for
a hundred billionth of a billionth sec
ond before decaying.
Richter said the discovery reveals
that "there must have been some new
stability principle."
He explained that three quarks, cal
led up, down and strange, were previ
ously considered the three basic bidd
ing blocks of large particles such as
protons and neutrons.
He said the Psi particle did not fit

into the traditional scheme and there
fore, it was suspected that the particle
might contain a fourth quark, dubbed
"charmed."
Charm-ing discoveries
"Since the first Psi particles were dis
covered in 1974.9 or 10 more members
of the same family have been found. At
first, there was much speculation
about what they were, the most popu
lar theory being the charmed quark
explanation first proposed by Prof,
lames Bjorken of SLAC and Sheldon
Clashow of Harvard when both were
prefessors of physics at Stanford. It
looks now as if that is really the ans
wer, since actual charm particles were
found just a few months ago at SPEAR
(Stanford Positron Electron Asymmet
rical Ring)," Richter said.
As to the broader implications of the
discovery, Richter said, "Today, there
are no practical applications."
However, he said the discovery
would help scientists learn more about
the universe.
Richter explained how the 35-man
team from SLAC and Lawrence-
Berkeley Laboratory produced the par
ticle here.
High-energy electrons and positrons
(matter and antimatter) are stored in
the SPEAR ring. The two particle
beams rotate in opposite directions,
and when they are forced to collide,
they annihilate each other and produce
a fireball.
Richter said fireball is merely a de
scriptive term, as the product is too
small to see.
"You never see the particle. You see
the decay products," he said.
The tracks of the products are traced
to determine the mass of the Psi parti
cle, Richter said.
Quark question
Richter said scientists have two
views regarding the role of quarks as
fundamental parts of physics. He said
some scientists feel that there is an
even lower-level substance which
serves as the basis of matter. However,
some scientists, such as he, believe
that quarks form the basic unit.
He said he plans to continue exper
imenting to discover more particles in
order to learn about quarks.
The university's new $55 million
Proton-Electron-Positron (PEP) ring
will generate more 15 billion electron
volts providing the experimenters
with a higher voltage than was used in

the SHEAR projects. Energy of more
than three billion electron volts pro
duced the Fsi particle.
Kichter said he would ultimately
like to see a ring 1(> kilometers (about
10 miles) in diameter which could
generate 100 billion electron volts.
PEP has a diameter of 300 meters (ab
out 1/4 mile).
A higher voltage would allow
physicists to test the properties of
smaller particles such as electrons.
Quarks are only known as the basic
elements for protons and larger parti
cles.
The composition of electrons has
not yet been discovered.
Kichter said he plans to use the
award money to help pay for his chil
dren's education.
According to SLAC Acting Director
Sidney Drell, Richter is not required to
share his prize with the university.
"The Nobel physics prize is
awarded to an individual for his per
sonal achievements," Drell said.
