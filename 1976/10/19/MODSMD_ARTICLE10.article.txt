# Campus drivers get the phase-out
## 
### 
We've driven full circle in two years of searching
for an equitable parking-transportation plan lor the
campus.
Old-timers can remember back to the halcyon
days of the driver here, times of virtual non
regulation and "free" parking which ended in fall,
1974.
Then, stung by losses of parking spaces to build
ing construction, the university initiated a search
for a way to allot the precious remaining stalls.
Simultaneously, the notion that drivers should not
be given a free ride first gained popular appeal.
At the time, hardly anyone paid to park. Students
were asked to pay $7.50 annually for stickers, but
police looked the other way and very few shelled
out the dough. Faculty and staff got free stickers.
An uproar greeted the institution of the current
$5-per-quarter student fee together with stricter en
forcement in January 1975. There was talk of a fee
assessment-financed lawsuit against the univer
sity, but efforts to halt ticketing of violators eventu
ally died out.
Phase II
Last September, the university began Phase II of
its search for the perfect way to park. Faculty and
staff were hit with fees for the first time, and off
campus students paid double the resident-student
rate for proximate parking.
This fall Phase 111 arrived. The university decided
that distinctions between "As" and "Bs" were less

ignominious than those between faculty and staff.
Besides, by graduating the price scale ("As" being
the premium in both cost and benefit), the normally
feudal kingdom of Stanford was at least making a
gesture to the marketplace.
Most economists would cheer that move. But the
enthusiasm must diminish when one sees where
the money is going. We've come 360 degrees from
drivers cruising on everyone's largesse to their paying
for everyone else's rides around the inner campus.

Indeed, as most parking fees rise each year, so do
the barriers to easy auto transport. The noxious
white poles are but a precursor to a master-planned,
sealed-off inner campus area.
These actions come despite the fact that roughly
half of the student body and a greater percentage of
the remaining campus community drive here.
University officials now admit that the aim of the
parking program is not so much efficiency, but to
"get some vehicles off campus." In short, the de

mise of the driver — at the driver's expense.
Each dollar poured into the parking fund goes to
finance the game of musical signs, the burgeoning
enforcement crew, the securing of roads on which
only bicycles ride or pedestrians walk, and the
$1300-a-week (plus purchase of buses) shuttle bus
service.
We all are pedestrians occasionally, most of us
are bicyclists and some of us even ride the shuttle
bus. The quarrel is not with those modes of trans
portation — only with the unilateral assessments
which make them possible. Now, the non-driver
rides for free.
A tax
In this way, the university parking fee is not a
user charge, the least objectionable way a govern
ment or institution can pay its bills, but instead a
tux, a transfer payment from a politically scorned
group to another of more model behavior.
"We're just coming out of the dark ages on park
ing," university planner Oscar Nelson tells us,
pointing to more modern systems such as UCLA's
($l2O permits).
But are we really advancing? In our zeal to cor
rect the wrongs of years past, have we forgotten the
ideal which we originally sought to further: of each
carrying his/her own weight? Are drivers the new
indentured class?

We've driven full circle in two years of searching
for an equitable parking-transportation plan lor the
campus.
Old-timers can remember back to the halcyon
days of the driver here, times of virtual non
regulation and "free" parking which ended in fall,
1974.
Then, stung by losses of parking spaces to build
ing construction, the university initiated a search
for a way to allot the precious remaining stalls.
Simultaneously, the notion that drivers should not
be given a free ride first gained popular appeal.
At the time, hardly anyone paid to park. Students
were asked to pay $7.50 annually for stickers, but
police looked the other way and very few shelled
out the dough. Faculty and staff got free stickers.
An uproar greeted the institution of the current
$5-per-quarter student fee together with stricter en
forcement in January 1975. There was talk of a fee
assessment-financed lawsuit against the univer
sity, but efforts to halt ticketing of violators eventu
ally died out.
Phase II
Last September, the university began Phase II of
its search for the perfect way to park. Faculty and
staff were hit with fees for the first time, and off
campus students paid double the resident-student
rate for proximate parking.
This fall Phase 111 arrived. The university decided
that distinctions between "As" and "Bs" were less

ignominious than those between faculty and staff.
Besides, by graduating the price scale ("As" being
the premium in both cost and benefit), the normally
feudal kingdom of Stanford was at least making a
gesture to the marketplace.
Most economists would cheer that move. But the
enthusiasm must diminish when one sees where
the money is going. We've come 360 degrees from
drivers cruising on everyone's largesse to their paying
for everyone else's rides around the inner campus.

Indeed, as most parking fees rise each year, so do
the barriers to easy auto transport. The noxious
white poles are but a precursor to a master-planned,
sealed-off inner campus area.
These actions come despite the fact that roughly
half of the student body and a greater percentage of
the remaining campus community drive here.
University officials now admit that the aim of the
parking program is not so much efficiency, but to
"get some vehicles off campus." In short, the de

mise of the driver — at the driver's expense.
Each dollar poured into the parking fund goes to
finance the game of musical signs, the burgeoning
enforcement crew, the securing of roads on which
only bicycles ride or pedestrians walk, and the
$1300-a-week (plus purchase of buses) shuttle bus
service.
We all are pedestrians occasionally, most of us
are bicyclists and some of us even ride the shuttle
bus. The quarrel is not with those modes of trans
portation — only with the unilateral assessments
which make them possible. Now, the non-driver
rides for free.
A tax
In this way, the university parking fee is not a
user charge, the least objectionable way a govern
ment or institution can pay its bills, but instead a
tux, a transfer payment from a politically scorned
group to another of more model behavior.
