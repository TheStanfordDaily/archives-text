# Warnke-Carter foreign policy persuasive
## 
### 
Lyon, Stamos

The complex goals of American affairs
have historically been held in mutual
accord by both the Republican and
Democratic parties. Both groups tend
to agree on the same basic objectives of
national security, world stability and
promotion of "democratic ideology."
However, in the recent debate on
foreign policy between President
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, Carter
offered a change to this approach,
stressing a foreign policy based on
morality.
Paul Warnke, former assistant sec
retary of defense and currently chief
foreign affairs advisor to Carter as well
as a potential choice for Secretary of
state under Carter, expounded in a lec
ture last week on this new morality in
foreign affairs.
The new morality encompasses the
idea that the United States should no
longer serve as the "busybody" and
world police force in international af
fairs, but rather must promote national
self-determination and global stability
through international pluralism.
No longer bi-polar
An example of what Warnke says a
Carter administration should strive for
can be found in his outook towards

East-West relationships. No longer can
we look at the world in merely bi-polar
terms as past administrations have.
Warnke points out that the once sound
theory of two competing coalitions,
one pro-West and one pro-communist,
which existed in the 1950s and 19605,
is no longer valid due to changes in the
world order.
This change is demonstrated clearly
by two examples of shifts in power and
influence. First, the development and
growth of third world nations has
added complexity to the status quo, as
can be seen by their growing authority
in United Nations.
Second, a split has occured in the
"communist bloc" as the People's Re
public of China and the Soviet Union
have become bitter enemies. There
fore, a Carter administration would
hold that detente cannot exist as a "be
all and end all," but rather as one as
pect of our foreign policy.
Secrecy
Continuing on the theme of morality
Warnke gives several examples of how
he feels American foreign policy
should be conducted.
A major problem in American
foreign policy has been secrecy. A

vivid example of this can be seen from
our involvement in Vietnam, where
the public never knew exactly what
our goals were.
Carter, realizing this, feels that
Americans have the right to know
what our major objectives truly are.
However, Warnke adds that openness
in diplomacy should not go to the ex
treme of explaining day-to-day negoti
ations.
Regarding the Panama Canal,
Warnke feels it is essential that the tre
aty be re-negotiated, with the Panama
nians eventually gaining sovereignty
and management of the canal.
The importance of national self
determination cannot be undermined.
The role of the United States in the
overthrow of the Allende government
in Chile was highly amoral and should
serve as an example of the type of pol
icy which must be avoided. Similarly,
we must permit Italy to choose its own
form of government.
No arms merchant
The United States should no longer
be the arms merchant of the world.
Although it may be economically via
ble, it is morally improper and serves
only to bring about more conflict.

General Moshe Dayan of Israel has
stated that if the present arms race in
the Mideast continues, it can only
"guarantee Israel's destruction." Car
ter advocates exercising unilateral
arms restraints and also proposes an
international arms sellers' conference.
The morality of the campaign was
again brought to focus in a candid
statement by Warnke on the Taiwan-
China issue. Realistically viewing the
issue. Warnke stated that there is only
one China and that is the People's Re
public.
In addition, he feels that Taiwan will
eventually fall under the control of
Peking, and that it is not an issue
which calls for U.S. intervention.
In dealing with these complex is
sues, Warnke expressed the openness,
candor and straightforward potential
of a Carter administration. His
thoughts and style were a refreshing
change to the usual campaign rhetoric.
It revealed an honest trend in govern
ment, which will hopefully lead the
United States into a new era in world
affairs.

Regarding the Panama Canal,
Warnke feels it is essential that the tre

nians eventually gaining sovereignty
and management of the canal.
The importance of national self
determination cannot be undermined.
The role of the United States in the
overthrow of the Allende government
in Chile was highly amoral and should
serve as an example of the type of pol
icy which must be avoided. Similarly,
we must permit Italy to choose its own
form of government.
No arms merchant
The United States should no longer
be the arms merchant of the world.
Although it may be economically via
ble, it is morally improper and serves
only to bring about more conflict.

General Moshe Dayan of Israel has
stated that if the present arms race in
the Mideast continues, it can only
"guarantee Israel's destruction." Car
ter advocates exercising unilateral
arms restraints and also proposes an
international arms sellers' conference.
The morality of the campaign was
again brought to focus in a candid
statement by Warnke on the Taiwan-
China issue. Realistically viewing the
issue. Warnke stated that there is only
one China and that is the People's Re
public.
In addition, he feels that Taiwan will
eventually fall under the control of
Peking, and that it is not an issue
which calls for U.S. intervention.
In dealing with these complex is
sues, Warnke expressed the openness,
candor and straightforward potential
of a Carter administration. His
thoughts and style were a refreshing
change to the usual campaign rhetoric.

The complex goals of American affairs
have historically been held in mutual
accord by both the Republican and
Democratic parties. Both groups tend
to agree on the same basic objectives of
national security, world stability and
promotion of "democratic ideology."
However, in the recent debate on
foreign policy between President
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, Carter
offered a change to this approach,
stressing a foreign policy based on
morality.
Paul Warnke, former assistant sec
retary of defense and currently chief
foreign affairs advisor to Carter as well
as a potential choice for Secretary of
state under Carter, expounded in a lec
ture last week on this new morality in
foreign affairs.
The new morality encompasses the
idea that the United States should no
longer serve as the "busybody" and
world police force in international af
fairs, but rather must promote national
self-determination and global stability
through international pluralism.
No longer bi-polar
An example of what Warnke says a
Carter administration should strive for
can be found in his outook towards

East-West relationships. No longer can
we look at the world in merely bi-polar
terms as past administrations have.
Warnke points out that the once sound
theory of two competing coalitions,
one pro-West and one pro-communist,
which existed in the 1950s and 19605,
is no longer valid due to changes in the
world order.
This change is demonstrated clearly
by two examples of shifts in power and
influence. First, the development and
growth of third world nations has
added complexity to the status quo, as
can be seen by their growing authority
in United Nations.
Second, a split has occured in the
"communist bloc" as the People's Re
public of China and the Soviet Union
have become bitter enemies. There
fore, a Carter administration would
hold that detente cannot exist as a "be
all and end all," but rather as one as
pect of our foreign policy.
Secrecy
Continuing on the theme of morality
Warnke gives several examples of how
he feels American foreign policy
should be conducted.
A major problem in American
foreign policy has been secrecy. A

vivid example of this can be seen from
our involvement in Vietnam, where
the public never knew exactly what
our goals were.
Carter, realizing this, feels that
Americans have the right to know
what our major objectives truly are.
However, Warnke adds that openness
in diplomacy should not go to the ex
