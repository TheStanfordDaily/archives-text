Basic union rights
During the 19605, Stanford sent
more students than any other univer
sity to the southern civil rights
marches. Today the fight for civil
rights seems history to many students
here, a victorious battle of the past.
Actually it is not. The farmworkers
of California have been refused the
same basic rights other workers have
enjoyed for 40 years. Prop. 14 at last
promises a guarantee of these rights.
Fourteen years ago, when "civil
rights" often meant the right of a black
man to eat where he chose, Cesar
Chavez was fighting for the right of
farmworkers to eat decent meals.
Chavez organized the United Farm
Workers and fought tirelessly for de
cent living conditions and control over
the workers' own lives. Now he is lead
ing the drive for basic union rights rep
resented by Prop. 14.

Discourage trespassers
Once again, the university managed
to solve one of the tough problems that
has been bothering the environmen
talists for a long time: "How do you
preserve the wildlife and the natural
resources of the Jasper Ridgearea?"
You simply build condominiums
around it to discourage the occasional
trespassers with their devastating ef
fects on nature.
It seems that this solution is even
more suitable for the state and national
parks and forests, where people have
been "trespassing" in thousands every
year.
In this case, not only does it help
guarantee some revenue, but it elimi
nates the need for the rangers and an
entire bureaucracy in addition to im
proving the "aesthetic" values of the
wildlife.
The positive side effect of the above
solution, which somehow escaped the
university planners, is that when the
kids of the future tenants of those

houses start riding up and down the
hills their mini-bikes would scare the
hell out of the gophers that have been
shamelessly trespassing the area
for quite some time now.

After reading the Oct. 7 edition of
"Bug Me" in the Daily concerning the
careless behavior of certain bicyclists,
I felt I should voice my own view about
the injustices done by motorists.
Many times while riding my bicycle
I have been refused my right of way
when trying to cross a street, and a few
times I have come close to an accident
because of the self-interest and into
lerance of some motorists. Bicyclists
are being put in a situation where their

rights are the decision of the driver,
since standing up to a car about ready
to flatten you would be foolish.
Apparently these people are either
deliberately denying bicyclists their
rights, or they just don't know that
when bicycles are on a street they have
the same rights, and (should) follow
the same rules, as motorists.
Obviously the only solution to this
problem is cooperation. Thinking that
the police should be able to control
every bicycle (or car) on the street is
unrealistic. Hikers who run stop signs
and break other laws must take their
own responsibilities, and motorists
must treat bicyclists as equals.
It's time these motorists start con
sidering bicycles both a legitimate and
better form of travel in comparison to
the wastefulness (body: no exercise;
spirit: no exercise; resources: you
should know) of automobiles.

shamelessly trespassing the area
for quite some time now.

Cooperation needed
After reading the Oct. 7 edition of
"Bug Me" in the Daily concerning the
careless behavior of certain bicyclists,
I felt I should voice my own view about
the injustices done by motorists.
Many times while riding my bicycle
I have been refused my right of way
when trying to cross a street, and a few
times I have come close to an accident
because of the self-interest and into
lerance of some motorists. Bicyclists
are being put in a situation where their

rights are the decision of the driver,
since standing up to a car about ready
to flatten you would be foolish.
Apparently these people are either
deliberately denying bicyclists their
rights, or they just don't know that
when bicycles are on a street they have
the same rights, and (should) follow
the same rules, as motorists.
Obviously the only solution to this
problem is cooperation. Thinking that
the police should be able to control
every bicycle (or car) on the street is
unrealistic. Hikers who run stop signs
and break other laws must take their
own responsibilities, and motorists
must treat bicyclists as equals.
It's time these motorists start con
sidering bicycles both a legitimate and
better form of travel in comparison to
the wastefulness (body: no exercise;
spirit: no exercise; resources: you
should know) of automobiles.

Basic union rights
During the 19605, Stanford sent
more students than any other univer
sity to the southern civil rights
marches. Today the fight for civil
rights seems history to many students
here, a victorious battle of the past.
Actually it is not. The farmworkers
of California have been refused the
same basic rights other workers have
enjoyed for 40 years. Prop. 14 at last
promises a guarantee of these rights.
Fourteen years ago, when "civil
rights" often meant the right of a black
man to eat where he chose, Cesar
Chavez was fighting for the right of
farmworkers to eat decent meals.
Chavez organized the United Farm
Workers and fought tirelessly for de
cent living conditions and control over
the workers' own lives. Now he is lead
ing the drive for basic union rights rep
resented by Prop. 14.

Discourage trespassers
Once again, the university managed
to solve one of the tough problems that
has been bothering the environmen
talists for a long time: "How do you
preserve the wildlife and the natural
resources of the Jasper Ridgearea?"
You simply build condominiums
around it to discourage the occasional
trespassers with their devastating ef
fects on nature.
