# Reverse discrimination
## High courts face conflict 
### 
(CPS) —During its '76-77 term, the U.S. Sup
reme Court may be finally forced to rule on the
controversial issue of reverse discrimination — a
move that could halt many affirmative action hir
ing and admissions practices.
Reverse discrimination — bias against white
males as a result of programs geared for minorities
or women — has been charged in over a dozen
suits in the past few years. With stiffer competi
tion for jobs and school admissions, some white
males have argued that their constitutional rights
areviolated when policies in hiring or education
give preference to minorities.
It's no secret that the Supreme Court hasn't been
eager to take a stand on the dispute. In fact, the
court has declined to hear several such cases, or
ruled on technicalities that avoided the key
points. But appeals to the high court appear
likely on several cases this year.
As the issue has grown more heated, the legal
status of reverse discrimination has become even
more confusing. State supreme courts have lined
up on opposite sides of the question.
Some justices have maintained that the Four
teenth Amendment, which bars racial discrimina
tion, applies to white males as well as minority
groups. Others contend that because of past dis
crimination, resulting in a shortage of blacks and
women in some jobs and colleges, affirmative ac
tion is a just tool for promoting equality.
Although no one can be certain about how the
U.S. Supreme Court will act, the recent conserva
tive trend on the bench indicates that reverse dis
crimination may be banned.
Med school case
The case most likely to settle the issue of reverse
discrimination involves a student who was de
nied admission to the University of California at
Davis Medical School. The university's quota for
minority admissions was recently ruled uncon
stitutional by the California Supreme Court.

The court concluded that the program "af
forded preference on the basis of race to persons
who, by the university's own standards, are not as
qualified for the study of medicine as non
minority applicants denied admission . . . the
equal protection clause applies to any person, and
its lofty purpose is incompatible with the premise
that some races be afforded a higher degree of
protection against unequal treatment than others."
The University of California, which would be
forced to restructure its admissions program be
cause of the decision, plans to appeal the case to
the U.S. Supreme Court, according to University
General Counsel Donald Reidhaar. Reidhaar also
said that the circumstances will "very likely force
the (Supreme) Court to take this case and resolve
the issue once and for all."
Courts disagree
Nevertheless, other state courts have sharply
disagreed with the California verdict. In DeFunis
vs. Odeguard, the Washington Supreme Court
ruled it was constitutional for a law school "to
remedy racial imbalance through its minority
admissions policy." It held that a university could
accept some qualified minority candidates with
lower grades and test scores and reject other
applicants who would have been admitted had
they been minorities.
As decisions for both sides of the dispute con
tinue to pile up, the fate of many of the innovative
affirmative action programs hang in the balance.
At the same time, statistics show that, since the
economic recession, blacks and women have been
making little progress towards more jobs and
higher income.
While justices may debate the constitutionality
of reverse bias, no one can debate the fact that a
ruling against affirmative action policies would at
least slow down the movement towards economic
and social equality.

its lofty purpose is incompatible with the premise
that some races be afforded a higher degree of
protection against unequal treatment than others."
The University of California, which would be
forced to restructure its admissions program be
cause of the decision, plans to appeal the case to
the U.S. Supreme Court, according to University
General Counsel Donald Reidhaar. Reidhaar also
said that the circumstances will "very likely force
the (Supreme) Court to take this case and resolve
the issue once and for all."
Courts disagree
Nevertheless, other state courts have sharply
disagreed with the California verdict. In DeFunis
vs. Odeguard, the Washington Supreme Court
ruled it was constitutional for a law school "to
remedy racial imbalance through its minority
admissions policy." It held that a university could
accept some qualified minority candidates with
lower grades and test scores and reject other
applicants who would have been admitted had
they been minorities.
As decisions for both sides of the dispute con
tinue to pile up, the fate of many of the innovative
affirmative action programs hang in the balance.
At the same time, statistics show that, since the
economic recession, blacks and women have been
making little progress towards more jobs and
higher income.
While justices may debate the constitutionality
of reverse bias, no one can debate the fact that a
ruling against affirmative action policies would at
least slow down the movement towards economic
and social equality.
(CPS) —During its '76-77 term, the U.S. Sup
reme Court may be finally forced to rule on the
controversial issue of reverse discrimination — a
move that could halt many affirmative action hir
ing and admissions practices.
Reverse discrimination — bias against white
males as a result of programs geared for minorities
or women — has been charged in over a dozen
suits in the past few years. With stiffer competi
tion for jobs and school admissions, some white
males have argued that their constitutional rights
areviolated when policies in hiring or education
give preference to minorities.
It's no secret that the Supreme Court hasn't been
eager to take a stand on the dispute. In fact, the
court has declined to hear several such cases, or
ruled on technicalities that avoided the key
points. But appeals to the high court appear
likely on several cases this year.
As the issue has grown more heated, the legal
status of reverse discrimination has become even
more confusing. State supreme courts have lined
up on opposite sides of the question.
Some justices have maintained that the Four
teenth Amendment, which bars racial discrimina
tion, applies to white males as well as minority
groups. Others contend that because of past dis
crimination, resulting in a shortage of blacks and
women in some jobs and colleges, affirmative ac
tion is a just tool for promoting equality.
Although no one can be certain about how the
U.S. Supreme Court will act, the recent conserva
tive trend on the bench indicates that reverse dis
crimination may be banned.
Med school case
The case most likely to settle the issue of reverse
discrimination involves a student who was de
nied admission to the University of California at
Davis Medical School. The university's quota for
minority admissions was recently ruled uncon
stitutional by the California Supreme Court.

The court concluded that the program "af
forded preference on the basis of race to persons
who, by the university's own standards, are not as
qualified for the study of medicine as non
minority applicants denied admission . . . the
equal protection clause applies to any person, and
its lofty purpose is incompatible with the premise
that some races be afforded a higher degree of
protection against unequal treatment than others."
