# V.P. debates 'entertaining'
## 
### Marc Strassman News analysis 
The partisan exchanges that
characterized Democratic
Senator Walter Mondale and
Republican Senator Robert
Dole's vice-presidential debate
Friday night were echoed yes
terday in the comments offered
by political observers of various
hues and stripes.
Ed Crane, National Chairman
of the Libertarian Party, com
menting from Washington, D.C.,
said that "Dole was an embar
rassment. Mondale came on as a
warmed-over, lukewarm New
Deal liberal, rattling off a litany
of what the government was
going to provide for people. The
outstanding feature of the debate
was that there was no substance
to it at all."
Crane compared the two
men's implicit opinion of the
electorate by saying that "Mon
dale seemed to assume that the
average American is not too
smart, while Dole seemed to as
sume that the average American
had no intelligence at all. That
he should have been so flip is a
bad reflection on Ford." he said.
Democratic candidate for

Congress in the 12th District,
David Harris, shared the liberta
rian's evaluation ot Republican
Dole, but had a different opinion
about the Minnesota senator.
"I think that Mondale was the
clear winner," said the former
Stanford student body presi
dent, "and 1 was embarrassed
that Dole was running for vice
president of the United States."
Paul N. McCloskey, republi
can incumbent opposing Harris,
was on a campaign jogging tour
and could not be reached for
comment.
Wallace Stegner, emeritus
professor of English, lamented
t hat "the tone of the whole cam
paign has been screwed down to
the 'you did this-no I didn't'
level, which exasperates me."
Still, said Stegner, "1 thought
that Mondale did better. He
wasn't quite so waspish. I think
Mondale came closer to eloqu
ence and I believe him; he is a
man of probity."
Debate entertaining
I larvey Hukari, regional direc
tor of the Republican National
Committee said that he found
this debate "a little more enter
taining than the others.

"Dole and Mondale showed a
willingness to challenge each
other," he said. "I enjoyed Dole's
pugnacity.
"The trouble with the debate,"
he added "was that it could have
been held in 1966 or 1956."
Asked to comment on Dole's
charge that World Wars 1 and II
and the Korean War were
"Democrat wars," Hukari said
"It is true that those were wars
that began under Democratic
administrations. And, despite
what Mondale said, before Pearl
Harbor there were partisan dif
ferences concerning entry into
the war, from American Firsters
and midwestern republican
isolationists."
Win Foster, chairman of the
Palo Alto Carter-Mondale Steer
ing Committee, said he was "pre
dictably, much more impressed
by Mondale's performance.
Dole was counter-punching like
in a boxing match. He didn't lay
out anything of his own. He was
throwing darts at what Mondale
was saying, without dealing
with the larger issues. Mondale
was more impressive."
Hukari said that he expects the
final debate between Democratic

nominee Jimmy Carter and Re
publican President Jerry Ford
this Friday to he"the most in
teresting. It will be on general
topics, and the atmosphere has
gotten pretty acrimonious. Each
of them have won one so far, so
this will be the rubber match of
the series."
He cited an NBC poll released
yesterday giving Carter a 42 to4o
per cent lead nationwide over
Ford as evidence of the closeness
of the campaign and predicted,
"We're going to win in Califor
nia."

Wallace Stegner, emeritus
professor of English, lamented
t hat "the tone of the whole cam
paign has been screwed down to
the 'you did this-no I didn't'
level, which exasperates me."
Still, said Stegner, "1 thought
that Mondale did better. He
wasn't quite so waspish. I think
Mondale came closer to eloqu

man of probity."
Debate entertaining
I larvey Hukari, regional direc
tor of the Republican National
Committee said that he found
this debate "a little more enter
taining than the others.

"Dole and Mondale showed a
willingness to challenge each
other," he said. "I enjoyed Dole's
pugnacity.
"The trouble with the debate,"
he added "was that it could have
been held in 1966 or 1956."
Asked to comment on Dole's
charge that World Wars 1 and II
and the Korean War were
"Democrat wars," Hukari said
"It is true that those were wars
that began under Democratic
administrations. And, despite
what Mondale said, before Pearl
Harbor there were partisan dif
ferences concerning entry into
the war, from American Firsters
and midwestern republican
isolationists."
Win Foster, chairman of the
Palo Alto Carter-Mondale Steer
ing Committee, said he was "pre
dictably, much more impressed
by Mondale's performance.
Dole was counter-punching like
in a boxing match. He didn't lay
out anything of his own. He was
throwing darts at what Mondale
was saying, without dealing
with the larger issues. Mondale
was more impressive."
Hukari said that he expects the
final debate between Democratic

nominee Jimmy Carter and Re
publican President Jerry Ford
this Friday to he"the most in
teresting. It will be on general
topics, and the atmosphere has
gotten pretty acrimonious. Each
of them have won one so far, so
this will be the rubber match of
the series."
He cited an NBC poll released
yesterday giving Carter a 42 to4o
per cent lead nationwide over
Ford as evidence of the closeness
of the campaign and predicted,
"We're going to win in Califor
nia."
The partisan exchanges that
characterized Democratic
Senator Walter Mondale and
Republican Senator Robert
Dole's vice-presidential debate
Friday night were echoed yes
terday in the comments offered
by political observers of various
hues and stripes.
Ed Crane, National Chairman
of the Libertarian Party, com
menting from Washington, D.C.,
said that "Dole was an embar
rassment. Mondale came on as a
warmed-over, lukewarm New
Deal liberal, rattling off a litany
of what the government was
going to provide for people. The
outstanding feature of the debate
was that there was no substance
to it at all."
Crane compared the two
men's implicit opinion of the
electorate by saying that "Mon
dale seemed to assume that the
average American is not too
smart, while Dole seemed to as
sume that the average American
had no intelligence at all. That
he should have been so flip is a
bad reflection on Ford." he said.
Democratic candidate for

Congress in the 12th District,
David Harris, shared the liberta
rian's evaluation ot Republican
Dole, but had a different opinion
about the Minnesota senator.
"I think that Mondale was the
clear winner," said the former
Stanford student body presi
dent, "and 1 was embarrassed
that Dole was running for vice
president of the United States."
Paul N. McCloskey, republi
