# The
						Boarding House showcases top rock
## Rankin plays mellow jazz 
### Kaki Bertelsen 
The room was warm. There
was warmth coming from many
bodies close together and there
was warmth emanating from the
person on stage. Kenny Rankin
was the person, performing at
the Boarding House in San Fran
cisco Oct. 8, 9 and 10.
He set the mood with his open
ing sone — "In the Name of
Love" from the album Silver
Morning. The audience was
quickly caught up in the vibra
tions he sent throughout the the
ater. He continued with "People
Get Ready" and "Haven't We
Met," both from the same Silver
Morning album.
The lighting was pleasantly
muted on Rankin's now well
known features. I was affected by
the particularly smooth quality
of his voice, which sounded as if
it required little effort. He ap
peared to really enjoy perform
ing before an audience. Between
songs he chatted with the audi
ence, creating a special rapport.
Mellow concert
Being more accustomed to at
tending rock concerts, 1 was

struck by the difference between
hard line rockers seen at a Grate
ful Dead concert and the audi
ence at the Friday night show.
People were very mellow, to use
an over-worked, but in this case,
appropriate phrase. Certainly
the performer, the theatre, and
the nature of the music played
were important factors in the
creation of the atmosphere. The
attitude of the audience was not
"let's get loaded" but more one
of simple appreciation of good
music.
The opening performer for
Kenny Rankin was a good
audience-warmer. He was Hol
leye Levin, whose forte is writing
songs about people. Most were
funny — a few were a little sad,
and all were well supported
musically.
For those of you who are avid
Kenny Rankin fans, his perfor
mance was a delight. No one
who expected to hear the excel
lent music they are familiar.with
from his albums would be dis
appointed.
And for the rest of you who are

unacquainted with Kenny fym
kin, these three performances
were an excellent opportunity.to
expand your musical taste jjij a
positive direction.
Lots of munchies
Besides just being a comforta
ble setting, the Boarding House
as several conveniences. If the
munchies should strike you for
one reason or another, there fs bn
informal restaurant downstairs,
which has good food at reasona
ble prices. Various sumptuotis
sounding wines and hearty beers
are also available for the asking.
Unfortunately, no tasting was
done on my part due to minor
status.
For those of you who massed
the Kenny Rankin performance
and-or are interested in future
shows at the Boarding House,
you can check the Sunday Enter
tainment section of the fj.an
Francisco Chronicle.
The show was a pleasure ,for
both the Kenny Rankin fans,and
the uninitiated. My only com
plaint was that it just wasn't long
enough.
