# U.S. grabs four Nobels for science
## 
### 
Stockholm (AP) — A Harvard pro
fessor won the? 1976 Nobel Prize in
chemistry and two American nuclear
physicists shared the physics prize
yesterday to complete an unpre
cedented sweep for the United States
of all four Nobel science awards.
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sci
ences named William Nunn
Lipscomb, 56, winner of the chemistry
prize "for his studies of boranes, il
luminating problems of chemical
bonding."
The physics prize went jointly to
Stanford Prof. Burton Ric.hterand Prof.
Samuel C.C. Ting of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology for pioneering
work in the discovery of a heavy
elementary particle now called the
"Psi Particle."
President Gerald Ford lauded the
winners during a White House cere
mony for American scientists. He
noted that yesterday's awards along
with the medicine and economics
prizes given last week mark "the first
time in history that a single country
has been the home of all these win
ners."
Champagne
At Harvard, in Cambridge, Mass., stu
dents and professors broke out the
champagne for Lipscomb after three
students carried the news to his office.
"I looked very closely to see whether
they were kidding," he said later, "and
they looked very serious."
Ting, 40, was in Geneva, Switzer
land. where he has been working at the
European Nuclear Research Center. "I
am obviously very, very happy," he
said. "And that, yes, that is all." he
added after some hesitation, then
broke into laughter.
Even though Ting was away, his col
leagues at MIT were preparing a party
in his honor,
Splitting the prize
The prizes, totaling $160,000 each,
will be formally presented by Swedish
King Carl Gustav XVI at a ceremony in
Stockholm on Dec. 10. Ting and Rich
ter, who worked independently, will
divide that amount.
Two American virologists — Baruch
Blumberg of the University of
Pennsylvania Medical School and
Carleton Gajdusek of the National In
stitute for Neurological Diseases, won
the medicine prize last Thursday for
studies of infectious diseases. Univer
sity of Chicago economist Milton
Friedman won the prize in economics.
The academy said Lipscomb, born in
Cleveland and educated at the Univer
sity of Kentucky and California Insti
tute of Technology, was honored
primarily for his studies in the chemis
try of "boranes," the now generally ac
cepted name for boron hydrides, the
compounds of the element boron with
hvdrooen.

The prizes, totaling $160,000 each,
will be formally presented by Swedish
King Carl Gustav XVI at a ceremony in
Stockholm on Dec. 10. Ting and Rich
ter, who worked independently, will
divide that amount.
Two American virologists — Baruch
Blumberg of the University of
Pennsylvania Medical School and
Carleton Gajdusek of the National In
stitute for Neurological Diseases, won
the medicine prize last Thursday for
studies of infectious diseases. Univer
sity of Chicago economist Milton
Friedman won the prize in economics.
The academy said Lipscomb, born in
Cleveland and educated at the Univer
sity of Kentucky and California Insti
tute of Technology, was honored
primarily for his studies in the chemis
try of "boranes," the now generally ac
cepted name for boron hydrides, the
compounds of the element boron with
hvdrooen.
Stockholm (AP) — A Harvard pro
fessor won the? 1976 Nobel Prize in
chemistry and two American nuclear
physicists shared the physics prize
yesterday to complete an unpre
cedented sweep for the United States
of all four Nobel science awards.
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sci
ences named William Nunn
Lipscomb, 56, winner of the chemistry
prize "for his studies of boranes, il
luminating problems of chemical
bonding."
The physics prize went jointly to
Stanford Prof. Burton Ric.hterand Prof.
Samuel C.C. Ting of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology for pioneering
work in the discovery of a heavy
elementary particle now called the
"Psi Particle."
President Gerald Ford lauded the
winners during a White House cere
mony for American scientists. He
noted that yesterday's awards along
with the medicine and economics
prizes given last week mark "the first
time in history that a single country
has been the home of all these win
ners."
Champagne
At Harvard, in Cambridge, Mass., stu
dents and professors broke out the
champagne for Lipscomb after three
students carried the news to his office.
"I looked very closely to see whether
they were kidding," he said later, "and
they looked very serious."
Ting, 40, was in Geneva, Switzer
land. where he has been working at the
European Nuclear Research Center. "I
am obviously very, very happy," he
said. "And that, yes, that is all." he
added after some hesitation, then
broke into laughter.
Even though Ting was away, his col
leagues at MIT were preparing a party
in his honor,
