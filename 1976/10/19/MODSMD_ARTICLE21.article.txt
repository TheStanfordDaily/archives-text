# Near-politics and music mix

### David L. Miller 
The words to the blues that have
been written for women are
real hard to get behind.
For those of you who have never
heard a woman's blues it goes
something like this - beat me
kick me I'll go anywhere you
want me to and I won't mind.
So I decided to write one.
Those are the words of Holly
Near and the blues to which she
is referring is entitled "Get Oft
Me Baby."
Holly Near appeared with
Jeff Langley Monday Oct. 11
through Thursday Oct. 14 at The
Boarding House in San Fran
cisco. Near and Langley, two ex
cellent performers who have
been playing together for 11
years, present a sensitive and
provocative evening of music.
Unpretentious combination
An unpretentious combina
tion of folk, blues, gospel, and
jazz, their music consists simply
of Langley's fluid piano, Near's
smooth wide-ranged voice, and
the audience's hoots, screams,
and singing.
As an event, however, it is
much much more than just a
concert.
An evening with Holly Near ij

a cultural event with politics.
Her concerts teach and inspire.
Her message is a movement, a
concern for people.
Near, who appeared last
spring in a free concert at Memo
rial Auditorium, came out Mon
day night with her red hair cut
short, wearing brown cords, and
a smile. She talked freely with
the audience, taking requests,
occasionally forgetting words to
older numbers, and inducing
audience participation with her
familiarity and personality.
She sang a medley of three
songs, each about "a woman tak
ing control of her life again.
Women's rights
Her songs, with titles like
"Feeling Better," "Started Out
Fine," "Old Time Woman," and
"It Could Have Been Me," spoke
out for women's rights and in
creased consciousness, courage,
fighting for freedom, equality,
and love.
She explored issues that in
cluded mental institutions, con
ceptions of success, Senate Bill 1
("Have they robbed you of your
; anger?") and prisons.
, "There are all kinds of pris
ons," said Near. "The prison of a
3 racial person of color in a white

world ... of poor people in a rich
society ... of a lesbian living in a
patriarchy."
Music cooked
Near and Langley's messages
and music were honest and
solid. While the music often
cooked, there were quiet mo
ments in the concert when Near,
Langley, and the audience
chanted together.
It was Near's first performance
at The Boarding House and she
made many requests of the club,
all of which were accepted. As
you walked in, there were paid
child care workers and a Propos
ition 14 table. No boycott liquor
was served and tickets were
priced low ($3) with no drink
minimum.
