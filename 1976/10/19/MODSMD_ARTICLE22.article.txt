# Steeleye Span tells musical tales
## 
### Richard Waldow Lyndon Stambler 
It's hard to imagine William Shakespeare
dancing a jig to an electric guitar in San
Francisco. Yet, if he'd been around the
Boarding House for the Steeleye Span con
cert last Thursday night, that's probably just
what he'd have been doing, along with the
rest of the enthusiastic crowd.
Concluding a four-night stand, the En
glish group demonstrated that old music
need not be stale music. And this is old
music — perhaps even predating Shakes
peare.
Steeleye Span is one of the most popular
groups in England. The group take's the
centuries-old melodies and lyrics of such
traditional English songs as "John Bar
leycorn," "Blackjack Davey*' and "Little
Beggerman" and adds modern effects.
Using electric guitar, fiddle and Keith
Moon-like rhythm, the group tells timeless

stories of romance, intrigue and adventure.
Gaining attention as the opening act for
Jethro Tull's 1974 tour, Steeleye Span in
troduced many Americans to English tradi
tional music. Now it is clear that this type of
music is on the rise. Performing songs from
their new album Rocket Cottage (Chrysalis
1123), the group showed Thursday night
just why their music is catching on.
As a soloist, lead vocalist Maddy Prior
displays great fluidity and expression. She
also has the ability to blend in with the other
five members of the group to produce the
beautiful harmonies characteristic of
Steeleye Span.
On fiddle, Peter Knight performs two
functions: he dramatically underscores the
music with classical and folk riffs, as well as
frequently taking the spotlight for a rousing
job. To many, Knight is the live Steeleye
Span. His humor, energy and musical vir

tuosity really stood out Thursday nigh*
Though Tim Hart seems to stay dQlie
background on stage, his
provide the distinct Steeleye sound: intri
cate harmonies, shifting rhythms aa3S a
driving beat. His resonant, heajJJ'V"
accented voice compliments Maddy Wur,
with whom he has sung since high scfceol.
Lead guitarist Robert Johnson and foxier

Steeleye's sound a rock edge withouWis
rupting the group's finely-crafted soiin'd.
But let's face it. You might be haggled as
to how a group could combine songs
witches, goblins, milk maidens, knights in
armor, ana capella version of "I'm Forever
Blowing Bubbles" (complete wit|i bubbles),
Walsh dialect songs and rowdy jigs. You
might try asking any one of the many people
dancing jibs in the aisles Thursday night.
Or, better yet, you could try listening to
Steeleye Span. i

Blowing Bubbles" (complete wit|i bubbles),
Walsh dialect songs and rowdy jigs. You
might try asking any one of the many people
dancing jibs in the aisles Thursday night.
Or, better yet, you could try listening to
Steeleye Span. i
It's hard to imagine William Shakespeare
dancing a jig to an electric guitar in San
Francisco. Yet, if he'd been around the
Boarding House for the Steeleye Span con
cert last Thursday night, that's probably just
what he'd have been doing, along with the
rest of the enthusiastic crowd.
Concluding a four-night stand, the En
glish group demonstrated that old music
need not be stale music. And this is old
music — perhaps even predating Shakes
peare.
Steeleye Span is one of the most popular
groups in England. The group take's the
centuries-old melodies and lyrics of such
traditional English songs as "John Bar
leycorn," "Blackjack Davey*' and "Little
Beggerman" and adds modern effects.
Using electric guitar, fiddle and Keith
Moon-like rhythm, the group tells timeless

stories of romance, intrigue and adventure.
Gaining attention as the opening act for
Jethro Tull's 1974 tour, Steeleye Span in
troduced many Americans to English tradi
tional music. Now it is clear that this type of
music is on the rise. Performing songs from
their new album Rocket Cottage (Chrysalis
1123), the group showed Thursday night
just why their music is catching on.
As a soloist, lead vocalist Maddy Prior
displays great fluidity and expression. She
also has the ability to blend in with the other
five members of the group to produce the
beautiful harmonies characteristic of
Steeleye Span.
On fiddle, Peter Knight performs two
functions: he dramatically underscores the
music with classical and folk riffs, as well as
frequently taking the spotlight for a rousing
job. To many, Knight is the live Steeleye
Span. His humor, energy and musical vir

tuosity really stood out Thursday nigh*
Though Tim Hart seems to stay dQlie
background on stage, his
provide the distinct Steeleye sound: intri
cate harmonies, shifting rhythms aa3S a
driving beat. His resonant, heajJJ'V"
accented voice compliments Maddy Wur,
with whom he has sung since high scfceol.

rupting the group's finely-crafted soiin'd.
But let's face it. You might be haggled as
to how a group could combine songs
