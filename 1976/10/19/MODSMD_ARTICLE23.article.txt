# Fine classical music trio at Stanford
## 
### Caitlin Hurt 
Ten years ago, the familiar
catalyst known as happenstance
brought together Bonnie
Hampton, Nathan Schwarz, and
David Abel as a classical music
trio. Familiar to the Stanford
community for about the last five
years, they are now the Fran
cesco Trio, our ensemble-in
residence, each year giving us a
concert series that explores the
dimensions of classical music.
Friday night opened their
1976-77 series entitled "Brahms
and Others" with a balanced
selection of pieces, early and
contemporary. Unfortunately,
due to illness, only two thirds of
the trio could be present. This
circumstance, however, gave us

the chance to hear the magical
blend of cello and piano.
The unusual opener of the
program was Johann Sebastian
Bach's "Sonata in G Minor for
'Cello and Piano," unusual be
cause of the demands placed on
the performer by Bach. The
beauty of his music is unques
tionable, but Bach is not noted
for passionate phrases that
sweep an audience into emo
tional absorbtion. Therefore, the
performers must inject a Bach
piece with enormous amounts of
musical expression, otherwise
the music never gets off the
ground, and there is no hope for
audience empathy.
Consequently, Bach is a tough
program opener on both the per

formers and the audience, but
the Francesco Trio easily met
this challenge. Though the tem
pos taken by the piano and the
cello did not at first completely
match, and the cello's tone was
at times a tifle thin, they played
with a vigor and sensitivity that
more than compensated for this.
Skillfully, they supported the
long phrases, sustaining them
through from end to end, gently
leading into each successive
phrase without letting the last
one completely drop.
"The Katcina Dances" com
posed by Louis Ballard are a
compelling blend of American
Indian themes with Western
musical techniques. Katcinas are
gods of the Hopi Indians, ten of
which are portrayed in these
dances. Played with a combina
tion of strength and subtlety,
these dances are most stirring.
Particularly worthy of note, was
Bonnie Hampton's outstanding
control of decrescendo. It was

with a magical touch that she al
lowed notes to fade until they
blended with silence.
The last piece before intermis
sion was Ludwig van Beeth
oven's "Sonata in C Major." One
facet of Beethoven's brilliance
was his ability to compose using
very simple musical patterns.
Particularly evident in the
Adagio movement, the perfor
mers wove together these simple
patterns with a perfect degree of
lightness and looseness. This ef
fect gave to the music the tran
quil translucence of a reverie.
"Drei Kleine Stucke" by
Anton Webern was approp
riately placed immediately fol
lowing intermission, at a time
when the audience is newly set
tled and alert. The epitome of a
contemporary piece, this was fil
led with dissonances, odd tem
pos, and wild leaps from note to
note that sounded more impro
vised than written. But accord
ing to Nathan Schwarz, this ef

feet of apparent improvisation
was sought by the composer.
The players displayed in this
piece a thorough competence
with the strenuous technical
demands. The dissonances were
kept very clean by excellent tjon
trol over pitch, as were the Over
tones.
The program was concluded
with Johannes Brahms' "Soiiata
in F Major," a piece vrtrich
dramatically demonstrated the
empathy the performers Jiad
with the music, their insru
ments, and each other. Each in
strument shone in solo passages;
each was sensitive in sustaining
the accompaniment. The fingers
of Nathan Schwar/. moved
thoughtfully over the piano
keys, lifting out the music with
out extraneous motions in'the
hands and arms. Bonnie
Hampton exercised a full f.vnge
of cello voices, from crisp to Sen
suous, never lapsing into thin
ness.
The 1976-77 Francesco Trio
concert series, "Brahms and
Others," began last Friday night
with beauty and success. David
Abel will re-join the groujj for
their next concert on November
5, 8 p.m. at Dinkelspiel iAu
ditorium.
