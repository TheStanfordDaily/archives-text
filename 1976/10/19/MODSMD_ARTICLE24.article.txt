The American Conservatory
Theatre in San Francisco opened
for its eleventh straight season
this month. The A.C.T. has some
exciting new offerings this sea
son as well as two revivals from
last year's repertoire. The fare
ranges from Shakespeare to
Stoppard and promises to pro
vide another interesting year for
theatergoers.
The season officially began on
the 16th of this month with
Othello. Shakespeare's famous
tragedy is being presented in a
19th century setting to enhance
the heavy military motif that
runs throughout the play. John
Hancock, who has received
much of his theatrical training at
the A.C.T., plays Othello.
Bernard Shaw is not without
representation this season as the
A.C.T. presents Man and
Superman. It is concerned with
the classic confrontation bet
ween man and woman and is
thoroughly spiced, of course,
with the typical Shavian wit.
The third act, "Don Juan in
Hell," which is often done alone,
provides a poignantly humorous
climax. It is currently playing
along with Othello.
Opening on Nov. 2 will be
Equus, the Tony Award
winning drama by English
playwright Peter Shaffer. This
psychological thriller, one of the
revivals from last season, once
again stars Peter Donat as
psychiatrist Martin Dysart who
is trying to save a boy from the
horrors of a strange obsession
and perhaps, save himself.
Donat will be sharing the role
with Ray Birk and Daniel Davis
who also appears as Peer in Peer
Gynt and lago in Othello.
Coming to Geary Theatre on
Dec. 7 is an original stage adap

tation of Dickens' A Christmas
Carol. Director Laird William
son along with Dennis Powers
are providing the new script
which is said to be truer to the
story than previous film ver
sions.
Knock Knock by Jules Feiffer
of cartoon fame appears on Jan.
18 of next year. The bizarre Feif
fer conjures up two old hermits
who entertain such guests as
Joan of Arc in an hysterically
funny comedy.
On Feb. 8 The Bourgeois Gent
lemen by Moliere will play on
the A.C.T. stage. This comedy,
written in the typically outlan
dish fashion of Moliere, portrays
the complications that arise
when a common tradesman
turns aristocrat.
Valentin and Valentino will
be making its English-speaking
premiere on Mar. 8. This Russian
love story was written by Mihail
Roschin, one of Russia's most
popular playwrights. Currently, it
is playing in over 90 theaters in
the Soviet Union. The story of
the two young lovers is set in
present-day Russia and will give
the audience a more personal
look at modern Soviet life.
Brilliant and witty
Tom Stoppard's Travesties,
winner of the New York Drama
Critics' Award and numerous
other awards, will open on Mar.
29. This is somewhat of a tribute
to Oscar Wilde, replete with
word play at which Stoppard is a
master, much like his predeces
sor Wilde. Most of the action
takes place in the rather disor
ganized memory of an obscure
English consulate, Henry Carr.
James Joyce, Lenin, and others
meet and discuss art, but occa
sionally lapse into excerpts from
The Importance of Being Ear
nest. It is one of the most brilliant
and witty new plays and should

be a definite highlight in this
season's schedule.
PeerGynt by Henrik Ibsen, the
other revival from last season,
joins this season on Apr. 26. This
fantasy-drama is about a young
boy who travels the world in an
effort to find himself.
The A.C.T. also has an
nounced that the highly success
ful Taming of the Shrew which
has been in repertory for the last
three seasons has been filmed for
television and will be aired on
Nov. 10.
The excellent offerings for this

season have brought brisk sales
at the box office. Therefore, bet
ter seats are only available for
certain dates. Regular ticket
prices range from $5 to $9.50,
though student rush tickets for
only $3.50 are often available
shortly before performance. Tic
kets and information may be ob
tained on the Stanford Campus
through the Tresidder Ticket Of
fice. The Geary Theatre is lo
cated at 450 Geary St. in San
Francisco at the corner of Geary
and Mason Sts. and is easily
reached via U.S. 101 and
Franklin St.


Silly Lily returns
The wacky wit of Lily Tomlin will be center stage this Sunday,
Oct. 24 at De Anza College in Cupertino. Tomlin began her
career oil Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In.
