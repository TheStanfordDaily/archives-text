# 'Dead,' 'Who' rock out
## 
### Christopher Escher 
The theme of Bill Graham's Day on the Green on
October 8 and 9 which featured the Grateful Dead
and the Who at the Oakland Coliseum was the
combination of British and American rock. The
newspaper and magazine ads displayed the merg
ing of the two national flags as their background,
and even the stage set depicted a foggy San Fran
cisco on the right and a foggy London on the left,
with a misty overhang connecting the two.
Graham certainly chose musical representatives
that would make any nation proud, because for
the total of six hours that the groups played. The
Who and the Dead kept the weekend afternoon
crowd alive with some classic rock 'n roll.
The gates opened at 9 a.m. and about two hours
later the Dead appeared. With Bob Weir and a
sun-glassed Jerry Garcia sharing center stage and
lead vocals/guitar, they had slight difficulty (on
Sunday) with the sound on their first number. As
Garcia put it,"the next one's to test the equip

ment;" yet they were soon oft into some amazing
electrical guitar work on such favorites as "Friend
of the Devil," "Sugar Magnolia," "Ramble on
Rose," and a slew of others.
All the songs had long jam sessions in them,
and at one point during "Friend of the Devil,"
Garcia took off on an impressive 30-minute long
musical stream of consciousness.
The sun was just beginning to shine brightly
through the low hanging Bay Area clouds on
Sunday when, after an hour-long intermission.
The Who opened with one of their old songs, "1
Can't Explain." As they continued, their two hour
act "Teen-Aged Wasteland," "My Wife," "Won't
Get Fooled Again," "Pinball Wizard." a 20 minute
"Tommy" Anthology, and "Squeeze Box." were a
few of the tunes blasted out. The encore, which
came after 15 minutes and with some of the audi
ence already gone, was yet another version of
Johnny B. G.oode, and a collection of other short
oldies.

It's a bird, it's a plane—no it's "Man and Superman," Bernard Shaw's brilliant comedy about the
eternal battle of the sexes, opening Oct. 19 at the Geary Theater. Peter Donat and Barbara
Dirickson (front), along with James R. Winker and Francine Tacker (rear) cause sparks to fly in
the American Conservatory production.

The sun was just beginning to shine brightly
through the low hanging Bay Area clouds on
Sunday when, after an hour-long intermission.
The Who opened with one of their old songs, "1
Can't Explain." As they continued, their two hour
act "Teen-Aged Wasteland," "My Wife," "Won't
Get Fooled Again," "Pinball Wizard." a 20 minute
"Tommy" Anthology, and "Squeeze Box." were a
few of the tunes blasted out. The encore, which
came after 15 minutes and with some of the audi
ence already gone, was yet another version of
Johnny B. G.oode, and a collection of other short
oldies.

It's a bird, it's a plane—no it's "Man and Superman," Bernard Shaw's brilliant comedy about the
eternal battle of the sexes, opening Oct. 19 at the Geary Theater. Peter Donat and Barbara
Dirickson (front), along with James R. Winker and Francine Tacker (rear) cause sparks to fly in
the American Conservatory production.
The theme of Bill Graham's Day on the Green on
October 8 and 9 which featured the Grateful Dead
and the Who at the Oakland Coliseum was the
combination of British and American rock. The
newspaper and magazine ads displayed the merg
ing of the two national flags as their background,
and even the stage set depicted a foggy San Fran
cisco on the right and a foggy London on the left,
with a misty overhang connecting the two.
Graham certainly chose musical representatives
that would make any nation proud, because for
the total of six hours that the groups played. The
Who and the Dead kept the weekend afternoon
crowd alive with some classic rock 'n roll.
The gates opened at 9 a.m. and about two hours
later the Dead appeared. With Bob Weir and a
sun-glassed Jerry Garcia sharing center stage and
lead vocals/guitar, they had slight difficulty (on
Sunday) with the sound on their first number. As
Garcia put it,"the next one's to test the equip

ment;" yet they were soon oft into some amazing
electrical guitar work on such favorites as "Friend
of the Devil," "Sugar Magnolia," "Ramble on
Rose," and a slew of others.
All the songs had long jam sessions in them,
and at one point during "Friend of the Devil,"
Garcia took off on an impressive 30-minute long
musical stream of consciousness.
