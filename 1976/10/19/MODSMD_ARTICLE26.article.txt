Ford spending policies criticized
Washington — The Ford administration proba
bly contributed to the current slow-down in
economic activity by failing to spend all of its
budget in 1976, a growing number of economists is
beginning to believe.
Even within the administration, one highly
placed economist said the lower-than-anticipated
government spending undoubtedly had a "dam
pening influence" on the economy in the past six
months.
Economists are not unanimous on whether there
is a direct link between the slowdown in economic
activity and the spending shortfall, but there is no
question that both have occurred simultaneously.
In addition, many economists are unable to fully
explain the slowdown in any other way.
After spurting to an annual growth rate of 9.2 per
cent in the first three months of the year, as re
flected in the nation's Gross National Product, the
economy slowed to a 4.5 per cent rate in the second
quarter.
The Commerce Department is scheduled to pub
lish the third quarter growth figures today and
economists are looking for growth of only about
four per cent, a level insufficient to reduce the na
tion's high unemployment rate.
General calls Israel U.S. burden
Washington — Gen. George Brown, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said yesterday that he was

quoted accurately in a story in which he described
Israel as a military burden to the United States.
However, Brown said he did not mean to imply
that he disagreed with U.S. policy of providing
weapons to Israel.
Brown made his comments to reporters during a
news conference with Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld, who said there are no plans to either
reprimand or fire Brown for his remarks.
"The absence of a reprimand should not mean an
endorsement of Gen. Brown's obviously inelegant
phraseology," Rumsfeld said. And the White
House said "the president considers the matter
closed."
Flu vaccine scare may stall program
Atlanta — The Center for Disease Control here
said yesterday that following the shutdowns of
swine flu vaccination clinics last week, it may not
be able to meet its goal of completing vaccinations
by Christmas.
Meanwhile, most of the nine states where clinics
shut down reported turnout was light yesterday. At
the South Side clinic in Pittsburgh, where the re
ports of deaths among elderly persons first sparked
the clinic closings, only a handful of persons
showed up as the facility reopened.
Authorities continued to say that the deaths of
dozens of elderly persons who had taken the vac
cine were not related to the shots. The three victims
in Pittsburgh died of heart attacks, and authorities
said their deaths — like those of other elderly vic
tims — were not connected to the flu shots.
Forty interviewed for Yoshimura jury
Oakland — Wendy Yoshimura's trial on
weapons and explosives charges began yesterday
with efforts to suppress the anticipated testimony
of Patricia Hearst, the defendant's former under
ground companion.
A panel of 40 prospective jurors was summoned
for the afternoon session after the entire morning
was spent arguing three defense motions which
Alameda County Superior Court Judge Martin
Pulich took under submission.
Potential jurors were questioned individually by
Pulich who told them the trial was expected to last
six to eight weeks. He said there would be no ses
sions on Fridays. He had predicted earlier it would
take "a few days" to seat a jury.
Yoshimura is charged with possessing explo
sives, a machine gun, bomb components and a de
structive device with intent to injure persons and
destroy property. If convicted, she could be impris
oned for five years to life.

Candidates to avoid 'bitter* politics
Apparently recognizing that an "up for grabs"
presidential campaign could become more bitter in
its waning days, Democratic contender Jimmy Car
ter expressed confidence yesterday that both he and
President Gerald Ford would try to keep it from
descending to the "gutter level."
Carter made the observation in an early-morning
interview with network reporters at his peanut
warehouse in Plains, Ga., hours before departing on
another vote-seeking foray, this time to Florida,
North Carolina and New York. Lasting only two
days, the trip marks an easing of the pace set by
Carter most of the past week.
Arabs say Israelis in Lebanon war
Beirut —Troops riding in Israeli helicopters cap
tured a Palestinian stronghold in southern Lebanon
yesterday, witnesses said.
In Saudi Arabia, an Arab mini-summit agreed to
bring Lebanon's 18-month civil war to a "decisive
end" with a ceasefire to take effect at midnight
tomorrow.
A Lebanese Moslem officer claimed the attacking
forces at the town of Marjayoun were Lebanese
Christians backed by Israeli transport and artillery.
He said Israeli forces also entered the town after it
was captured.
Other Moslem leftists, allied with the Palesti
nians against the right-wing Lebanese Christians
and Syrians, claimed to have engaged Israelis in
hand-to-hand combat.
Israel denied that its forces were involved in the
assault.
Grogan's one-man show routs Jets
Foxboro, Mass. — Quarterback Steve Grogan
combined his fantastic running talents with pin
point passing last night and directed the New Eng
land Patriots to a 41-7 romp over the hapless New
York Jets.
Today's weather
Fog and low clouds near the coast extending
inland night and morning but sunny most of the
area today and tomorrow afternoon. Little tempera
ture change. Lows tonight in the upper 40s to mid
50s. Highs both days in the 60s to low 70s. Light
