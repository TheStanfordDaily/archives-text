# Gift speeds plans for library annex
## 
### Emily Sachar 
Construction of the main library ad
dition may begin as early as January
because the university has received a
$6 million pledge from a donor who
wished to remain anonymous, accord
ing to Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice pres
ident of development here.
The pledge was announced at last
Tuesday's Board of Trustees meeting.
The donor had asked universiy offi
cials for anonymity.
"This pledge is indeed very good
news as we needed it to begin con
struction. It is an extraordinarly timely
commitment," Cuthbertson said.
"This magnificent commitment
brings to over $15 million the amount
donors have given or pledged to this
project. It is our top priority in the
Campaign for Stanford," President
Richard Lyman said.
Gradual payment
According to David Fulton, director
of communications, the money
pledged will be paid over a period of
time as yet undetermined. "They made
a commitment to give the money even
tually, although the period of time is
unknown," he said.

"We're hoping that there will be a
decision to proceed on building, as the
architectural plans are just being com
pleted," Cuthbertson said.
The $20 million project will involve
erecting a major extension behind
main library and renovating the exist
ing structure.
'Go' sign awaited
An initial construction date is yet to
be set by the Board of Trustees.
Cuthbertson said he expects that the
Board will recommend a time plan for
the project at their November meeting.
He said he expects that additional
funds and donations will eventually
provide the additional $5 million
needed for completing the project.
The donation is to be used specifi
cally for the library addition only, Ful
ton said. Since the Campaign for Stan
ford project has been the school's most
emphasized project and it's most im
portant fund drawer, said
Cuthbertson.
"Over the years, we've attracted
funds, but we've lacked the principal
gift that would have allowed the lib
rary project to proceed," Cuthbertson
said.
