# Ford discloses boycotting firms
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Acting at the
order of President Gerald Ford, the
Commerce Department yesterday re
leased the names of American com
panies involved in 59 transactions
with Arab nations.
The companies had been required
by Arab nations to participate in the
economic boycott against Israel in
order to keep their Arab business.
The list included such major U.S.
businesses as the Bank of America of
San Francisco, McGraw-Edison Inter
national of Elgin, 111., Deere & Co. of
Dubuque, lowa, and the First Wiscon
sin National Bank of Milwaukee.
In nearly all cases, the U.S. com
pany indicated it had complied with
the boycott requests. In a few. the
companies said other parties to the
transaction would have to make the
decision on the boycott. In no case did
a company say it refused to comply.
The names of several companies ap
peared on more than one transaction.
One company that appeared several
times was the Universal Transconti
nental Corp. of New York in trade with
Kuwait.
In one transaction with Kuwait, the
company was required to submit an
invoice showing that the goods did not

come from a company with which
Arab nations have refused to do busi
ness because of previous connections
with Israel.
Another company, the Air Express
International Corp. of Des Plaines, 111.,
was required to attest as part of a trans
action with Syria that "the merchan
dise is not oflsraeli origin, nor does it
contain any Israeli materials."
Ford had said in his second debate
with Jimmy Carter on Oct. 6 that the
Commerce Department would dis
close the names of American com
panies that particiated in the economic
boycott of Israel.
Meanwhile, Cox Newspapers re
ported that the Agency for Interna
tional Development (AID) in the State
Department produced a questionnaire
for Kuwait which asked companies
bidding on a $(iB5-million housing
project in Kuwait if they did business
with Israel.
AID official David McVoy said AID
agreed to leave the questions about
Israel on the form because, "there was
no way from a practical standpoint to
keep this out. We argued, but we
realized that this was their form and
their operation and nothing we could
say would stop them."

decision on the boycott. In no case did
a company say it refused to comply.
The names of several companies ap
peared on more than one transaction.
One company that appeared several
times was the Universal Transconti
nental Corp. of New York in trade with
Kuwait.
In one transaction with Kuwait, the
company was required to submit an
invoice showing that the goods did not

come from a company with which
Arab nations have refused to do busi
ness because of previous connections
with Israel.
Another company, the Air Express
International Corp. of Des Plaines, 111.,
was required to attest as part of a trans
action with Syria that "the merchan
dise is not oflsraeli origin, nor does it
contain any Israeli materials."
Ford had said in his second debate
with Jimmy Carter on Oct. 6 that the
Commerce Department would dis
close the names of American com
panies that particiated in the economic
boycott of Israel.
Meanwhile, Cox Newspapers re
ported that the Agency for Interna
tional Development (AID) in the State
Department produced a questionnaire
for Kuwait which asked companies
bidding on a $(iB5-million housing
project in Kuwait if they did business
with Israel.
AID official David McVoy said AID
agreed to leave the questions about
Israel on the form because, "there was
no way from a practical standpoint to
keep this out. We argued, but we
realized that this was their form and
their operation and nothing we could
say would stop them."
