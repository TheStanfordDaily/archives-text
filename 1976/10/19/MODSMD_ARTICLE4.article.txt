# Candidates discuss energy conservation

### Mark Funk 
Clashing over tin; impact of a prop
osed deregulation of gasoline prices,
Rep. Paid McCloskey )r., and chal
lenger David Harris squared off over
energy conservation last night in Palo
Alto.
The debate, held before 400 spec
tators at Palo Alto High School and
centering on environmental and
energy issues, was more low-key than
two previous Harris-McCloskey en
< ounters at Mountain View and Stan
ford.
McCloskey was the first to raise the
issue of gasoline prices. Noting U.S.
dependence on foreign petroleum and
invoking the specter of another Arab
oil boycott, he urged deregulation of
prices.
The Republican incumbent
suggested that oil prices be allowed
"to go up gradually" and that Congress
should consider rationing gasoline if
necessary.
Hardship for poor
Harris said all deregulation of fuel
would prove is that "Kast Palo Alto no
longer would be able to move itself."
He said its effect would be less on

higher income groups.
Decrying the effect of deregulation
on the poor, Harris said each citizen
and corporation should be given a
government controlled "lifeline" allo
cation of gasoline. Anything above the
allowance would be deregulated and
the price allowed to float.
Harris criticized McCloskey for his
support of nuclear energy. Claiming
that the cost of nuclear generators for
future energy needs "would cost trill
ions" and tie up most of the U.S.'s cap
ital, he said Americans should limit
energy consumption.
Listing a number of alternative
energy sources including solar and
tidal power, Harris said that America
"is not talking about an immediate
shortage (of fuel and resources), but
how to deal with an assumed demand
based on continued growth."
Coal
McCloskey responded by saying tin
alternative to development of nuclear
power was an increase in the burning
of fossil fuels, including coal.
Citing environmental problems
which he said would accompany tin
