# Franklin contemplates legal action

Former Stanford English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin
said he will probably sue the FBI and CIA in order
to gain full access to the files they kept on him for
the last decade.
Franklin, formerly a tenured professor here, was
dismissed early in 1071 its a result of his involve
ment in the disruption of a speech given here by
I lenry Cabot Lodge.
University President Richard Lyman and the Ad
visory Hoard, an elected group of faculty members,
said franklin's activities had violated Paragraph 15
of the Statement of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure.
According to the statement, "personal conduct
substantially impairing the individual's perfor
mance of his appropriate functions within the Uni
versity community" are grounds for dismissal.
Franklin already has two suits pending, one
against Stanford's Board of Trustees and another
against the University of Colorado Board of Re
gents.
The Mil and CIA suits would compel the agencies
to comply fully with the Freedom of Information

Act, Franklin said. So far, the FBI has handed over
about 800 pages of documentation to Franklin, but
"the CIA is just refusing to answer anything,"
Franklin said.
I le said there are "whole periods for which there
are no documents," and "we have a lot of other
evidence, (of agency actions against me)...that they
don't mention."
Administrative appeals have proved inadequate,
thus, Franklin said he will probably sue.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU),
which has provided counsel in his other two cases,
has advised Franklin that he may have to go to court
to attain the material and the A CXI' would probably
pursue the case.
"Eventually, I plan to sue both agencies for the
damage they have done to me." Franklin said. The
immediate suits, however, would ask only access to
the files, some of which detail harrassment tactics
used against him. he said.
"He (Franklin) has a strong case against the FBI,"
both on invasion of privacy and First Amendment
grounds." said Franklin's attorney, Tony Henzo.
Franklin traces the FBl's interest in him back to

1966, when he began to actively oppose the Viet
nam war.
'Unacceptable' politics
According to Franklin, the FBI decided that his
politics were unacceptable to them and for the sub
sequent decade, have tried to "neutralize" him.
"Neutralization means getting them (political
undesirables) out of action any way you can,"
Franklin said. In Franklin's case, the FBI has been
trying "to indict me under any criminal charges
they can. trying to entrap me," he said.
Failing to pin criminal charges on him. the FBI
started sending falsified letters and documents to
people in an effort to have him fired from Stanford,
Franklin said.
Franklin alleges that not only his extracurricular
activities were at issue. I le teaches literature from a
Marxian perspective, which is "understanding lit
erature as a product of social classes in struggle
with each other throughout human history." he
explained. Franklin said he became a Marxist in
mid-1967.

Franklin said he was "intentionally urging and inciting"
