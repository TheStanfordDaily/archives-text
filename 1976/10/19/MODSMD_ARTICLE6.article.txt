# McCloskey evasive on Ford endorsement

On Oct. 5, Rep. Paul "Pete" McClos
key came to campus. At the Deke
House a Daily reporter asked him what
he thought of the two presidential
candidates. He replied with a strong
attack on them both — worrying about
Jimmy Carter's religious "fanaticism"
and President Cerald Ford's lack of in
telligence.
Not unreasonably the Daily reporter
figured McCloskey hadn't decided
who he was supporting. After all, it
seems reasonable to assume that an
endorsement decision fits into an
answer on McCloskey's measure of the
candidates.
As it turns out McCloskey has en
dorsed Ford and he is outraged at the
Daily for not knowing it. The blame
must be placed with McCloskey.
He is the one who only mentions the
endorsement when cornered. He is the
one who so enthusiastically attacks
both candidates at the drop of a ques
tion.
Can't imagine
He is the one whose attacks on
Ford's intelligence, programs and val
ues are so convincing that observers
can't imagine that this is the man
McCloskey had endorsed for president
of the United States.
That McCloskey doesn't like people
to know he has endorsed Ford is not
surprising. But it's not particularly
honest, either.
In addition, McCloskey's attacks on
Carter are not at all convincing. Car
ter's religion — as difficult as it is for
urbane Californians to relate to — isn't
a legitimate issue any more then Ford's
"born again" status is. What should be
in question are their records and prog
rams.
McCloskey says he disagrees with
Ford on everything and that Carter
has no programs. Neither of these alle
gations is true. McCloskey votes with
Ford more often than Barry Cold water
Jr. As for Carter's programs, McClos
key may not like them but they're cer
tainly there.

Obviously McCloskey doesn't want
to come to grips with all this. He'd
rather the whole problem went away.
Why?
Could it be that his endorsement of
Ford is in recognition of Ford's ap
pointment of Gordon Knapp to the
Pentagon? Knapp, a right-wing Re
publican, almost beat McCloskey in
1974. Only the re-registration of 2000
Stanford students as Republicans gave
McCloskey his narrow, 800-vote vic
tory.
Because of his rightward shifts (like
aid to Cambodia), such an on-campus
re-registration drive would have cer
tainly failed in 1976 and McCloskey
would have lost the primary.
Enter Ford. His appointment of
Knapp to the defense post left McClos
key without an opponent in the Repub
lican primary. But now all these deal
ings have come back to haunt McClos
key in the form of his Ford endorse
ment.
Ideologically closer
It's not that McCloskey isn't closer
ideologically to Ford than he is to Car
ter. He certainly is. It's just not smart
politics to admit it. This is a strong
democratic district and while few
people are fanatical Carter lovers, even
fewer are inclined to look favorably on
Ford — our Richard Nixon-made pres
ident.
So McCloskey avoids the issue, at
tacks Ford, attacks Carter, and pre
tends to be progressive.
• Not just anyone can call a personal
friend "not very bright," turn around
and endorse him for president, then
say he disagrees with him on every
issue, then top it all off by doing every
thing possible to hide the whole mess,
and yet maintain his honest Abe im
age.
But "SNEAKY Pete" McCloskey has
managed it up to now. How much
longer can he keep it up?

Can't imagine
He is the one whose attacks on
Ford's intelligence, programs and val
ues are so convincing that observers
can't imagine that this is the man
McCloskey had endorsed for president
of the United States.
That McCloskey doesn't like people
to know he has endorsed Ford is not
surprising. But it's not particularly
honest, either.
In addition, McCloskey's attacks on
Carter are not at all convincing. Car
ter's religion — as difficult as it is for
urbane Californians to relate to — isn't
a legitimate issue any more then Ford's
"born again" status is. What should be
in question are their records and prog
rams.
McCloskey says he disagrees with
Ford on everything and that Carter
has no programs. Neither of these alle
gations is true. McCloskey votes with
Ford more often than Barry Cold water
Jr. As for Carter's programs, McClos
key may not like them but they're cer
tainly there.

Obviously McCloskey doesn't want
to come to grips with all this. He'd
rather the whole problem went away.
Why?
Could it be that his endorsement of
Ford is in recognition of Ford's ap
pointment of Gordon Knapp to the
Pentagon? Knapp, a right-wing Re
publican, almost beat McCloskey in
1974. Only the re-registration of 2000
Stanford students as Republicans gave
McCloskey his narrow, 800-vote vic
tory.
Because of his rightward shifts (like
aid to Cambodia), such an on-campus
re-registration drive would have cer
tainly failed in 1976 and McCloskey
would have lost the primary.
Enter Ford. His appointment of
Knapp to the defense post left McClos
key without an opponent in the Repub
lican primary. But now all these deal
ings have come back to haunt McClos
key in the form of his Ford endorse
ment.
Ideologically closer
It's not that McCloskey isn't closer
ideologically to Ford than he is to Car
ter. He certainly is. It's just not smart
politics to admit it. This is a strong
democratic district and while few
people are fanatical Carter lovers, even
fewer are inclined to look favorably on
Ford — our Richard Nixon-made pres
ident.
So McCloskey avoids the issue, at
tacks Ford, attacks Carter, and pre
tends to be progressive.
• Not just anyone can call a personal
friend "not very bright," turn around
and endorse him for president, then
say he disagrees with him on every
issue, then top it all off by doing every
thing possible to hide the whole mess,
and yet maintain his honest Abe im
age.
But "SNEAKY Pete" McCloskey has
managed it up to now. How much
longer can he keep it up?

On Oct. 5, Rep. Paul "Pete" McClos
key came to campus. At the Deke
House a Daily reporter asked him what
he thought of the two presidential
candidates. He replied with a strong
attack on them both — worrying about
Jimmy Carter's religious "fanaticism"
and President Cerald Ford's lack of in
telligence.
Not unreasonably the Daily reporter
figured McCloskey hadn't decided
who he was supporting. After all, it
seems reasonable to assume that an
endorsement decision fits into an
answer on McCloskey's measure of the
candidates.
As it turns out McCloskey has en
dorsed Ford and he is outraged at the
Daily for not knowing it. The blame
must be placed with McCloskey.
He is the one who only mentions the
endorsement when cornered. He is the
one who so enthusiastically attacks
both candidates at the drop of a ques
tion.
