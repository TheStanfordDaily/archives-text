# New Thai regime threatens freedom

Thailand, which clung to indepen
dence all through the colonial era, but
which has great trouble maintaining
internal freedom, has onceagain fallen
under military rule.
And once again, we are confronted
with disquieting evidence that the al
ternative to Communist dictatorship
often turns out to be military dictator
ship.
Bangkok has been walking a pre
carious tightrope since the United
States pulled most of its forces out of
Thailand. The government has felt it
necessary to court the People's Repub
lic of China in the hope of reducing
insurgent pressure in the eastern area
adjoining Cambodia (a hope that has
been to some extent realized).
But Soviet influence has increased;
so has tension in other areas. There is
new evidence of communist subver
sion in Southeast Asia.
The latest coup appears to have been
prompted by the neutralist role — or at
least the weakness — of the civi
lian government in the face
of these threats. But the restora
tion of dictatorial rule can easily bring
new unrest and new opportunities for
the communists to exploit.
The bloody student rioting which
brought on the coup shows how vio
lent the Thais can be, and it was just
such rioting that led to the overthrow
three years ago of the last military
ruler, Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn.

Can the new government survive such
rioting better than he?
If not, what further evils might en
sue? It is worth noting that Thanom's
return from exile on Sept. 19 to dwell
in a Buddhist monastery set off the
protests that led to the latest coup.
The new right-wing regime may
prove strong and wily enough to keep
order and to rally support from nearby
non-communist nations, thus helping
to contain expansionist communism.
But time and again, history has
shown that a prolonged military dic
tatorship ultimately brings on its own
collapse. In the long run, there is no
real substitute for democracy, even in a
country like Thailand, which has
known the blessings of internal free
dom only sporadically.
The best thing for Thailand and the
free world will be for Adm. Sangad
Calawvu, chief of the new military rul
ers, to keep his promise to restore con
stitutional government "as soon as the
country is ready."
The king has named a supreme court
justice as prime minister, but it is not
yet clear that he and other civilians to
be appointed to cabinet positions will
be more than a front for the military
junta. Unlike their predecessors, they
will not have been democratically
elected.
