# State legislators here
## Local politics, bills discussed 
### Kath Scanlon Marc Strassman 
A bill that would protect the public
from cancer-causing substances, and
the motives behind running for politi
cal office were discussed here by two
local politicians in separate lectures
yesterday.
In the Meyer Forum Room, State
Sen. ArlenGregorio discussed a bill he
introduced which will appropriate $1
million to the State Department of
Health to perform inspections, initiate
information programs and provide
consultation for employers who use

cancer-causing substances (carcino
gens).
The California Occupational and
Safety Act (CAL-OSHA) now requires
the state to monitor the uses of 16 car
cinogens, including such substances
as asbestos and vinyl chloride.
At interim hearings held by the se
i nate Health and Welfare Committee
! last year in Los Angeles County, Gre
gorio, who chaired the committee,
F said, "There were several rather
dramatic incidents of people who were
poisoned in the workplace."
The audience, members of the local

chapter of the American Chemical
Society (ACS), expressed concern that
the new law, which will go into effect
Jan. 1, will limit the use of carcinogens
in laboratories, or would require re
searchers to meet standards designed
not for them, but rather for the protec
tion of industrial employes.
Gregorio replied that although the
bill does cover laboratories, requests
for variances would be heard by the
Standards Board and that "research
people should go (to the Standards
Board) as a group."
Audience members asked why the

ACS had not been informed of the bill,
since it relates to chemistry.
Track own interests
Gregorio replied, "Why isn't the
Chemical Society tracking legislation
in Sacramento?" He said that there are
ways for interested persons to find out
what bills are pending concerning a
certain subject.
Victor Calvo, assemblyman from the
21st District, told an audience at the
American Studies House that being a
politician makes one "become a
pseudo-expert in almost everything
and an expert in nothing."
He said the role of a state assembly
man is to "be seen and be responsive to
the needs of one's constituents" and to
"be a go-between and humanize gov
ernment is every bit or more important
than having a legislative program."
Campaigns
In campaigns, Calvo said it is impor
tant for candidates to walk precincts,
mail out literature and use the media.
He said he thought no one should
hold any particular office longer than
eight or 10 years.
Noting that he has served six years
in city and six years in county offices,
Calvo said, "I'll probably leave state
government before six years."
Calvo, a graduate in the 1940s of
Stanford in political science, held a
variety of local offices in Mountain
View and was a Santa Clara County
Supervisor before being elected in
1974 to the State Assembly.
