# Senate campaign worth the trouble
## 
### 
It's fair to state that most of the
senators and would-be senators who
ran in last week's ASSU Senate elec
tion have concluded that to fully savor
the Stanford experience, one must run
a campaign. But as they would also be
last to encourage further expansion of
the already massive field of candidates
we saw in this year's race, perhaps
anyone entertaining the idea of mak
ing such a race will find his curiosity
satisfied by the following perspective
of Stanford from the eyes of a cam
paigner.
Going door-to-door every night for
ten nights, you have the opportunity to
meet all kinds. Some are pleasant;
some are rude; most fall between these
two descriptions and are generally in
different.
As any candidate will tell you, the
freshmen are the best. They are invari
bly the most interested and the most
friendly — a candidate can tell them
pretty much whatever he wants about
an issue or about himself and they will

have little to check him on. Moreover,
they almost always vote and thus are a
top priority in any serious campaign.
But mainly they are the best because
they have not yet acquired the
pseudo-sophisticated Stanford snob
bery which infects numerous upper
classmen. There lies the worst part of

campaigning in particular and Stan
ford life in general.
'Don't bother me'
It's the "don't bother me" attitude.
They don't care that you've spent hun
dreds of dollars and dozens of hours
trying to make student government
better. They don't care if you've
worked hours trying to make your
flyers say the right thing, your posters
the most attractive or your message the
most cogent. Basically, they don't care
about anyone except themselves. At
best they'll completely ignore you — at
worst they'll crumple your flyer in
your face. It takes a thick skin to meet
these people night after night and not
get upset.
Ironically, they're not only the ones'
who complain the most — they're also
the ones who probably never vote.
One finds the same set of cir
cumstances in White Plaza on election
day. As the candidates dodge bicycles
while attempting to hand literature to
the masses passing by at ten minutes
before each hour, they are met by the
same people they saw in the dorms.
Some cheerily take their offerings,
even thanking them; others sneer then
mutter something about wasting
paper; still others exhibit the above
mentioned snobbery by attempting to
totally ignore the pleas of the candi
dates to "please vote."
Positive factors
Despite all of this, the positive fac
tors of running a campaign far out
weigh the negative. There's a feeling of
satisfaction when you come home after
four or five hours of knocking on
doors, knowing you've gotten through
to at least a few interested people. And,
of course, the thrill of winning it when
it's all over is great, too. You forget
how lowly and unimportant the race is
in terms of world history — indeed,
how unimportant it is to most Stanford

students. You've proved something to
yourself. You're a winner.
But while a victory does wonders for
your ego, a quiet inward reflection on
the campaign is a humbling experi
ence. You think of those people you
don't even know whoasked you if they
could help. You think of your friends,
who have nothing really to gain by
your election, unselfishly out in the
dorms like you, taking the same kind
of abuse and spending their precious
study hours, for what? For you. The
warm feeling one gets from this ex
perience is a far greater thrill than the
victory itself.
Satisfaction
The satisfaction manifests itself in
other ways: the girl who rides by on
election day and cheerily says"I voted

for you;" the guy you had in some class
way back who says "Good luck, I hope
you win;" and the name-you've
forgotten-but-face-you-remember who
comes up to you on the proverbial
Morning After and says "Congratula
tions . . . Senator."
To all of these people you say "thank
you," and although you use the word
dozens of times a day, on those occas
sions you sincerely mean it.
Long after your term in the humble
senate is up, these memories will
linger on. Thus, when the candidates
—winners and losers—are asked "was
it all worth it?," these are the reasons
we answer "yes."
