# British complain about 'art' forms

London (AP) â€” After three
years of diapering her baby,
Mary Kelly, a British artist, hung
28 of the soiled diapers in The
Institute of Contemporary Arts, a
new London gallery supported
by public funds.
Ray Richards, 22, of Nottin
gham, has received about $850
from the Arts Council of Great
Britain for sweeping dust in the
street into variously shaped
piles.
The Tate Gallery, a world
renowned, trendy, publicly fi
nanced art center, recently spent
about $8,200 to purchase 120
cream-colored bricks arranged
as a sculpture from American ar
tist Carl Andre. They were
mailed to the gallery with in
structions on how to lay them
out.
A three-man "living
sculpture" team was given about
$670 by the Arts Council to walk
around with a 10-foot pole ba
lanced on their heads.
These are just some of the ex
penditures of public funds in re
cent months for artistic en
deavors that have been debated
in London newspapers and on
the floor of the House of Com
mons.
The Tate Gallery, which re
ceived about $1 million this year
in government grants, has been
under attack recently for a
number of its purchases which
included about $900 for .13
wooden letters covered in fish
ing netting, an unknown sum for
five burlap blankets dyed vari
ous colors and then folded and
stacked, and a video tape of two
London artists drinking gin.
London's conservative Even
ing News said the purchases

were "a typical example of the
collective lunacy that has over
taken this nation."
The Arts Council, the gov
ernment body responsible for
developing and improving the
knowledge, understanding, and
practice of the arts, has a budget
this year of about $61.2 million.
It has been funding many of the
artists and galleries under at
tack.
"If you like the bricks and
dirty nappies you'll love the Art
Council's newest masterpiece,"
read a headline in the Daily Ex
press, also conservative, talking
about the piles of dust.
The Arts Council was first es
tablished in 1946. The bulk of its
money is spent on national com
panies such as the Royal Opera
House and the Royal Shakes
peare Theatre. In its 1973-74
budget, it granted money to bet
ween 700 and 800 theaters,
opera houses, ballet companies,
orchestras and art associations.
Additionally the council made
640 awards to artists that year.
But the hard times that have
hit Britain have made even the
relatively small sums the Coun
cil expends for unusual art forms
fair game for critics.
"It is bad enough spending
public money like this at any
time," said Labor legislator Gwi
lyn Roberts, "but it is wicked to
do so in our present economic
plight." He is urging a full inves
tigation.
