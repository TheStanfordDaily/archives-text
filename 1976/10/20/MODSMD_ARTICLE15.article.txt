# Employs no new technology
## Minicar offers pollution solution 
### 
Goleta, Calif. (AP) — You
can't buy it, but a car exists today
that meets the tough 1980 fed
eral smoke standards, gets 30
miles to the gallon and affords its
occupants greater safety in
high-speed accidents.
This "supercar" isn't being
made in Detroit but in an old
farmhouse outside this rural
town 90 miles north of Los
Angeles. However, its develop
ers, Minicars, Inc., hope the
ideas used in its design will

eventually be adopted by the
auto industry.
The car, which was presented
to Transportation Secretary Wil
liam Coleman in Washington
Tuesday, was developed under a
$3.3 million contract from the
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. Minicars is one
of two firms selected to develop
a "research safety vehicle," by
RSV. The other company,
Calspan Corp. of Buffalo, ap
proached the problem by mod
ifying existing cars, but Minicars
built their RSV from the oil pan
up.
Although it's new the RSV de
veloped here, "is not an inven
tion," says Minicars president
Donald Friedman, who resigned
as head of General Motors com
mercial projects division to
found Minicars in 1968.
"There's no new technology,"
says Friedman, 49. "It's just ap
plying existing technology to
cars. Detroit could make it
within the next few years."

Minicars' RSV has a 104-inch
wheelbase, about the same as a
Ford Maverick, but the re
semblance stops right there. The
RSV, which carries four passen
gers, has airbags that inflate au
tomatically in a crash for the
front passengers and lap and
shoulder belts for those in back.
It also has a sophisticated elec
tronics system that includes a
microcomputer and radar that
senses "threats" and puts on the
brakes if the computer decides
the driver isn't paying attention.
If he is, the system has built-in
safeguards against "false
alarms."
"If the wheels are turned, the
radar can assess whether or not i t
will hit an object," says Fried
man. "And it will be clear to the
computer that the object is being
avoided by the action of the
driver."
Minicars found that the most
lethal crashes are frontal colli
sions, so the RSV has a com
pletely crushable front end to

cushion the impact. The win
dows are made of a special
shock-absorbing plastic and the
body is covered with a flexible
plastic layer that all but elimi
nates nicks. The car weighs less
than 2,000 pounds and is pow
ered by a specially charged
Honda engine mounted near the
middle of the vehicle.
Friedman says a "no-frills"
version of the RSV could be mass
produced and sold for roughly
the same price as a Ford Pinto —
about $3,500. Adding each of the
safety and consumer electronic
options would push that figure
up about 30 per cent, he esti
mates.
Friedman says the RSV refutes
the auto industry's contention
that safe cars wouldn't sell well.
"In the last RSV program, the
government turned out some
thing that looked like a tank," he
says."It can be the safest thing in
the world, but if no one wants to
buy it, it's not going to save one
life."
