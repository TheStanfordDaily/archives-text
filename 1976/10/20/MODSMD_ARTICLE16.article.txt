# Flo Mo to get computer use

### Sean Murphy 
Two computer terminals are expected to be in
stalled in the Florence Moore housing complex by
late November, according to Gary Natriello, a re
sident associate in Loro, one of the Florence
Moore houses.
A survey of all Flo Mo residents showed that
roughly one in two residents would be interested
in using the terminals, said Dennis Viner, a resi
dent associate inCardenal, another Flo Mo house.
Viner added that the Office of the Dean of Resi
dential Education was approached for funding
after the survey results came out.
Funding has been assured for what was felt to
be a worthwhile project, said Norman Robinson,
acting associate dean of residential education.

The cost involved is a $90 installation charge
per terminal. One would be a teletype, the
other linking to a television screen attached to a
keyboard, said Viner.
He added that the terminals would be located in
the Alondra piano room, with free access for 12
hours a day and limited access for the other 12.
Keys would be given to a Flo Mo resident in
terested in using the computer terminals.
Viner noted that the only objection so far was
that Flo Mo residents would be liable for any
vandalism done to the terminals. He added that
Roble Hall has had a terminal for over a year under
comparable security arrangements without any
damage to the terminal.
