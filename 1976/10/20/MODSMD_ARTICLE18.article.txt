# Program expanding services
## Legal aid for elderly 
### Leana Giannini 
"Despite popular conceptions
about Palo Alto, the downtown
area has the highest concentra
tion of persons over 65 in Santa
Clara County. Most of them are
poor by any decent standard.
They live in cheap hotels and in
tiny apartments," Mike Gilfix
says.
Gilfix, a young, ambitious,
1973 Stanford Law graduate has
become aware of the legal prob
lems of the elderly and has done
something about the situation.
He set up the Senior Adult Legal
Assistance (SALA) program now
located at 624 University Ave.,
Palo Alto in the fall of 1973 in
order to provide certain free
legal services to anyone age 60 or
older, regardless of income.
"We started with literally no
thing," he recounts. "The city of
Palo Alto gave us some office
space at 270 Forest, in the new
little downtown library. The
staff was all volunteer. Now
we've got branches almost
everywhere in North County.
These are intake offices, where
we do preliminary interviews,
but Palo Alto is still the head
quarters."
The program handles cases in
such fields as social security,
and veterans' benefits, Medi
care, Medicaid and related
health-care problems, consumer
difficulties, housing disputes
and landlord-tenant relation
ships.
Gilfix also teaches a law
course here entitled "Legal Prob
lems of the Older Person." He
will use videotaped interviews
with actual clients, as well as
videotapes of legal hearings. As
a basis for some of his lectures,
he will involve professionals in
many fields: historians,
philosophers, gerontologists,
sociologists and psychologists,
pointing out the broad area the
situation of elderly Americans
actually encompasses. This in
novative and non-traditional

approach to teaching has made
law students increasingly recep
tive to the subject.
Gilfix became interested in the
legal problems of the aging by
accident or fate. Strolling
around the Law School one
noon, he noticed a sign inviting
students to a meeting to plan a
legal aid project for Palo Alto el
ders. He wandered into the room
and found he was the only one
there. The apparent lack of in
terest surprised and bothered
Gilfix. "This was in the back of
my mind from that time on." He
continues, "and 1 decided it
needed full time attention."
Now Gilfix heads a staff of full
time and part-time attorneys, in
cluding Stephen Ravel, James

Rumbleand Elisabeth Wadleigh.
Marcia Greenwald completed
her law studies here last year and
is now a volunteer worker con
centrating on SALA's Law and
the Handicapped project. Jan
Brown, a paralegal worker,
handles much of the caseload
under the supervision of SALA
attorneys. David Holzworth and
Barbara Wellbery, two second
year Stanford law students are
also volunteers, while Murray
Halwer, semi-retired attorney
and former Lockheed legal staf
fer, serves as field director.
Gilfix concludes, "The Palo
Alto situation illustrates the in
visibility of elders. SALA and I
attempt to educate all about this
situation and deliver legal ser
vices to it."
