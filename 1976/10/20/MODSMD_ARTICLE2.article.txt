# Fuller says future depends on understanding nature

### Marc Strassman First of two parts 
"Whether mankind survives on the planet will de
pend on whether people will come to know feelingly
how nature works."
So said R. Buckminster Fuller to 250 people attend
ing a "Being With Bucky" symposium Sunday at the
San Francisco Hyatt Regency.
Sponsored by the New Dimensions Foundation, a
San Francisco-based educational organization dedi
cated to facilitating communcation about individual
and social transformation, the 81-year-old poet, ar
chitect, inventor of thegeodesic domeand comprehen
sive anticipatory design science, and inspiration of the
Whole Earth Catalog, discussed some of the principles
and projects that have occupied him during an extraor
dinarily full and productive lifetime.
He used a slide show of some of his projects to illus
tratethethree principles he said haveguided him in his
work.
The first principle is not to try to reform human
beings, but to create more effective artifacts within
which and around which they can live.
The second is that theoretical discoveries are not
sufficient; concepts must be reduced to practicality.
Finally, he said that if he took the responsibility for
developing a concept, it would eventually be taken up
by the general society when an "emergency" arose.
Realistic maps
He began the slide show with the projection of a
standard Mercator map, which distorted the sizes of
continents and badly misrepresented their relationship
to one another. Then he replaced this map with his own
Water-Ocean World map, which accurately depicts the
relative size of land masses, as well as illustrating the
reality of a single world ocean.
He followed this with his Sky-Ocean World map,
which similarly showed the reality of one world island,
centered around the North Pole. Fuller mentioned how
the inhabitants of North America and Asia now assume
their mutual enmity, but added confidently that
"they'll get over that soon."
Fuller referred toa chart showing the historical prog
ression of science as demonstrated by the isolation of
the "92 regenerative chemical elements" and the ac
celerating rate with which technology has been able to
send people around the earthâ€”from the two years re
quired by sailing ship, through the two months needed

by steamships, the two days necessary by airplane, and
the one hour transit time by "exotic metals" space
capsules.
Disliked 'cult'
It was around this time that he began receiving a lot
of favorable publicity and became the object of a grow
ing "cult" of admirers, he said. He was in New York
City then along with Krishnamurti, the Indian religious
teacher, who "looked like and enjoyed being treated
like a messiah," Fuller said.
Fuller said this role was not to his taste. "I began
drinking a lot and misbehaving, and that got rid of
them."
Fuller also showed slides of geodesic domes, which
are mainly open-space and have very effective cooling
qualities, in various locations around the world. These
included a geodesic globe on top of an engineering
bulding at Cornell University, one at Princeton Univer
sity near the Institute for Advance Study (Fuller said he
was told that it was viewed with interest by physicist
Albert Einstein), a dome at the Kabul Trade Fair in
Afghanistan, and a restaurant in Woods Hole, Mas
sachusetts.
He also showed pictures of domes in Greenland, and
another built by students and called "The Chilly
Machine" because of its extremely effective cooling
properties.
Dream cities
Fuller also presented models of two major dream
projects.
One is "Triton City," a floating city with a set-back
design that would be built for 45,000 people in inshore
protected waters. It would be economically feasible for
persons with incomes just above the poverty line to live
here. Fuller said.
The second is called "Old Man River" and is de
signed in a moon crater shape to serve the needs of the
black community of East St. Louis.
With private dwelling units on the outside and
community spaces on the inside of the artificial crater,
individual needs for privacy and communal needs for
socializing can be met simultaneously. The proposed
structure will be one-half mile in inside diameter and
one mile across in outside diameter, and would be
covered with a dome of its own. A smaller version of
the proposed community. 150 feet across, is now being
built there, he said.
