Would you please comment
on the diaphragm as a method of
contraception? What is its popu
larity among sexually active
Stanford women, in comparison
with the other methods?
The diaphragm is a dome
shaped cup of thin rubber, avail
able in sizes ranging from 50-
105 mm. in diameter, with a sup
portive metal-coil spring along
the periphery. Its purpose is to
hold a spermicidal agent against
the os, or opening, of the cervix
— not to mechanically block
sperm from entering the uterus
— and thus should always be
used in conjunction with cream
or jelly. When properly placed,
the pre-fitted diaphragm is
snugly wedged between the
back of the vaginal canal and the
pubic bone and is theoretically

97 per cent effective in prevent
ing pregnancy.
A woman wishing to be fitted
for a diaphragm should have al
ready had intercourse a few
times (using some other method
of birth control), since the vagi
nal size changes with first
coitus. The fitting is usually
done by a physician or nurse
practitioner.
Proper use of the diaphragm
involves placing approximately
one-half teaspoon of cream or
jelly (foam shouldn't be used)
into the c.up of the diaphragm.
Cream or jelly may also be
spread around the inside of the
rim if desired, but cream on the
outside edge of the rim invites
slippage during intercourse. In
sertion, which may be done by
either the woman or the man, in
volves pinching the cup together

at the rim, pushing the diap
hragm into place, and then
checking to feel the tip of the
cervix through the rubber. More
detailed insertion information
can and should be obtained from
diaphragm workshops held each
Thursday afternoon at Cowell, or
from a private physician.
The diaphragm may be in
serted up to two hours before in
tercourse — the spermicide be
gins to lose potency after that
length of time — and should be
left in the vagina for at least eight
hours (count 'em, 8) after inter
course. If the couple desires sec
ond, third, ad infinitum, inter
course during these eight hours,
an applicator-full of additional
cream or jelly should be inserted
into the vagina for each sub
sequent intercourse.
Although, according to Starr,
the "Pill" is still the most popu
lar method of birth control
among Stanford women, the
diaphragm, by virtue of its effec
tiveness and safeness, is the pre
ferred method for women choos
ing an alternative birth control
method. And, in true-to-
Stanford form, the effectiveness
rate here of 97 per cent equals the
diaphragm's theoretical value, a
feat which the "Pill" (99 percent
theoretical, 98 per cent Stanford
effectiveness) cannot match.

What are the current statistics
on venerea] disease cases that
Cowell treats?
Apparently, some aspects of
the real world really do manage
to diffuse through the Eucal
pytus Curtain.
According to Connie Starr,
nurse-practitioner at Cowell, the
health center here sees one or
two cases of Herpes genitalis per
week, for example. Herpes
genitalis is a chronic infection in
which a virus, remaining dor
mant most of the time, causes
open, painful sores in the genital
area whenever it presents itself.
Of the more celebrated ven
ereal diseases, gonorrhea is far
more frequently diagnosed at
Cowell than syphilis, number
ing one or two cases per month
as compared with six cases per
year of syphilis. Transmission of
both of these bacterial diseases
may be prevented by using a
condom.
All in all, the incidence of
veneral disease at Stanford ap
pears to be comparatively low.
Starr qualified these statistics,
however, noting that, "there is
no way to obtain data on the
number of students who are
treated off-campus."
So hold the applause.
