## Scotchers impressive in shutout 
### Debbie Carlton 
The Stanford women's field
hockey team took the sting out of
the Sacramento State Hornets in
a 3-0 victory yesterday in Sac
ramento.
"Our team played more beaut
ifully than I've ever seen them
play," said an enthused coach
Shirley Schoof. "Everybody was
just outstanding."
With the game scoreless at the
half, the scotchers resorted to
second-half brilliance to over
comea Hornet threat. Leading an
inspired offense was junior
Onnie Killefer, who scored two
goals for the Cards. Both points
were made on corner handstops
from teammate Sukie Jackson.
Sophomore wing Alison King
shot and rushed the ball in for
the scotchers third goal. King
had assistance from fellow
sophomore wing Helen Hunt,
who didn't miss a shot. "Both
Helen and Alison played excep
tionally well," stated Schoof.
Sophomore goalie Buffie
Berger saved the day about 15
times, including a critical save
on a penalty stroke during the
first half.
Schoof also cited junior
Mandy Read and senior Kathi
Levinson for their performances.
"Mandy played a beautiful game
and Kathi sparked the team all
the way through," she said.
The Cards will meet a tough
Cal Poly-Pomona team Friday at
2 p.m. on Roble Field.
