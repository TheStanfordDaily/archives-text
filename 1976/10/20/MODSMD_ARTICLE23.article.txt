# Player of Week
## Pac-8 tabs Guy 
### Paul Bauman 
The announcement that Stan
ford quarterback Guy Benjamin
has been named the Pacific-8 Of
fensive Player of the Week
comes as little surprise.
After all, Benjamin completed
14 of 22 passes for 270 yards
against Washington Saturday
and USC's Ricky Bell had the
week off. The Trojans had a bye
last weekend.
It took a record performance
by Bel 1 to prevent Benjamin from
winning the award last week.
For those who have been out of
circulation lately, Bell set Pac-8
records against Washington
State by rushing 51 times for 347
yards. Benjamin, meanwhile,
was peppering UCLA with 35
completions in 53 attempts for
372 yards.
Benjamin's totals against
Washington moved him into the
lead in Pac-8 passing statistics.
He has completed 61.6 per cent
of his passes for an average
290.2 yards a game. It's not pos
sible to do much better than that.
Not counted
Benjamin's statistics have been
outstanding all year, but the
Pac-8 did not previously count
him among the leaders because
he had not played in two-thirds
of Stanford's games.
The Cards can't afford to gloat
over their passing feats though.
They're not the best passing
team in the country. But the team
they're playing Saturday,
Washington State, is. The
Cougars average over 284 yards

in the air per game.
The Cougars are only 1-5 this
year, but Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen isn't looking past
them.
"Washington State is a team
that can upset anybody at any
time," he told the Northern
California football writers yes
terday. "They're the only team
that we know exists in the con
ference at the present time."
New team
Christiansen said that the
Cougars are "completely
changed from last year" under
their new head coach, Jackie
Sherrill. "They have 85 different
offensive formations, I think â€”if
there are that many. 1 was talking
to Jackie last week and he told
me, 'If you can draw it on the
blackboard, we use it.' From
what I've seem on films, it's true.
"They try to get you set in one
base defense or get you confused
so they can score an easy
touchdown."
Stanford should have all its
starters ready for the game, al
though a few are sore after the
Washington contest. Tony Hill
re-sprained an ankle. John Olen
chalk bruised a shoulder and
Larry Reynolds aggravated a
thigh bruise.
Honorary captains for this
week are Bill Kellar on offense,
Gordy Ceresino on defense and
Olenchalk on special teams.
Cardinal notes: Hill needs
only five catches to break Gene
Washington's career receiving
record of 122 receptions...Two
more touchdown catches by Hill
will break the all-time Stanford
mark of 14, held by Bill McColl.
James Lofton has caught eight
passes this season and three
have gone for touchdowns.
Kicker Mike Michel had his
best game against Washington,
hitting field goals from 41 and 38
yards without a miss.
