# One-goal losses hurt Card booters
## 
### John Murao 
After enjoying its first weekend off this fall, the Stanford soccer
team opened a three-week, six-game homestand with a 2-1 win
over UC-Davis yesterday. The few days off gave Stanford a wel
come rest after having traveled to no less than four consecutive
matches away from home.
The break in the schedule comes conveniently at the halfway
point of the season. Coach Nelson Lodge has used this time to
evaluate his squad's progress, assess his personnel and make ap
propriate adjustments.
"We needed the rest," Lodge said. "The boys have done well and
played hard. It's a shame our record stands as it is (4-6). Three
one-goal decisions against us have hurt. That aside, a few players,
perhaps, and a year's experience and we're going to start winning
the close ones."

The three one-goal losses
Lodge speaks of came against
Pomona, Hayward and Fuller
ton, all less than formidable op
ponents. Indeed, Stanford has
been a bit unlucky. Yet, there are
a few observations which should
be made to place things in
perspective.
Stanford's version of the
"Dutch whirl" is more a nervous
type of play than a constructive
style of soccer. Stanford rarely
puts more than two passes to
gether. This limits creativity and
gives rise to a game of wild kick
ing. As a result, Stanford's scores
have come from opponent's mis
takes rather than well
conceived, creative chances.
Need coaching
"It's not that the boys are
doing things wrong," Lodge
said. "No, rather they have never
been properly taught or coached
in this particular part of the
game: the concept of overlap
ping and supportive movement
without the ball.
"It's terribly hard to teach

such a skill. It is instinctive and
is acquired over a period of time
and experience. You don't teach
'soccer sense,' especially at the
college level where supposedly
the level of sophistication of
play is very high. You either
have it, or you don't."
When the Cardinals came out
against Davis, there were a few
changes. The addition of Bobby
Bonaparte to the forward line
gives Stanford another oppor
tunist. Both he and Bobby "The
Count" Geiger are speedsters
and together should help Stan
ford capitalize more often
around the opposing goal.
Strong defense
The Stanford defense, thus far
the Cardinal strength, has kept
the team in every game. The
three close losses were a matter
of pressure and hard luck.
The play of Mark Triska and
Billy Allstetter, a newcomer to
the first team, at outside backs
has been most impressive. Rick
Morrow continues to be a force at
sweeper. Rick mis-kicks more
often perhaps than Lodge's
blood pressure can stand, but his
speed and lightning quick re

covery more than makes up for
this.
Another new face to show up
on the first team is Bruce Del
Gado, a freshman. He will man
the center back. With Del Gado
in the lineup, Jimmy Melamed
has been allowed to move up to
his "natural" position at mid
field.
Goalie improved
Stanford's keeper, Lewis Bu
tler, has been the one to watch.
He has improved vastly with
each game and is quickly learn
ing "soccer sense" in the goal.
The Cardinal homestand got
off to a good start against UC-
Davis, as Stanford ran its modest
win streak to two games. Down
1-0 much of the game, Stanford
put home two late goals to gain a
come-from-behind win over a
highly regarded Davis ballclub.
Geiger and Skip Pfeiffer tal
lied for Stanford with Pfeiffer's
goal coming in the 88th minute.

The break in the schedule comes conveniently at the halfway
point of the season. Coach Nelson Lodge has used this time to
evaluate his squad's progress, assess his personnel and make ap
propriate adjustments.
"We needed the rest," Lodge said. "The boys have done well and
played hard. It's a shame our record stands as it is (4-6). Three
one-goal decisions against us have hurt. That aside, a few players,
perhaps, and a year's experience and we're going to start winning
the close ones."

The three one-goal losses
Lodge speaks of came against
Pomona, Hayward and Fuller
ton, all less than formidable op
ponents. Indeed, Stanford has
been a bit unlucky. Yet, there are
a few observations which should
be made to place things in
perspective.
Stanford's version of the
"Dutch whirl" is more a nervous
type of play than a constructive
style of soccer. Stanford rarely
puts more than two passes to
gether. This limits creativity and
gives rise to a game of wild kick
ing. As a result, Stanford's scores
have come from opponent's mis
takes rather than well
conceived, creative chances.
Need coaching
"It's not that the boys are
doing things wrong," Lodge
said. "No, rather they have never
been properly taught or coached
in this particular part of the
game: the concept of overlap
ping and supportive movement
without the ball.
"It's terribly hard to teach

such a skill. It is instinctive and
is acquired over a period of time
and experience. You don't teach
'soccer sense,' especially at the
college level where supposedly
the level of sophistication of
play is very high. You either
have it, or you don't."
When the Cardinals came out
against Davis, there were a few
changes. The addition of Bobby
Bonaparte to the forward line
gives Stanford another oppor
tunist. Both he and Bobby "The
Count" Geiger are speedsters
and together should help Stan
ford capitalize more often
around the opposing goal.
Strong defense
The Stanford defense, thus far
the Cardinal strength, has kept
the team in every game. The
three close losses were a matter
of pressure and hard luck.
The play of Mark Triska and
Billy Allstetter, a newcomer to
the first team, at outside backs
has been most impressive. Rick
Morrow continues to be a force at
sweeper. Rick mis-kicks more
often perhaps than Lodge's
blood pressure can stand, but his
speed and lightning quick re

covery more than makes up for
this.
Another new face to show up
on the first team is Bruce Del
Gado, a freshman. He will man
the center back. With Del Gado
in the lineup, Jimmy Melamed
has been allowed to move up to
his "natural" position at mid
field.
Goalie improved
Stanford's keeper, Lewis Bu
tler, has been the one to watch.
He has improved vastly with
each game and is quickly learn
ing "soccer sense" in the goal.
The Cardinal homestand got
off to a good start against UC-
Davis, as Stanford ran its modest
win streak to two games. Down
1-0 much of the game, Stanford
put home two late goals to gain a
come-from-behind win over a
highly regarded Davis ballclub.
Geiger and Skip Pfeiffer tal
lied for Stanford with Pfeiffer's
goal coming in the 88th minute.
