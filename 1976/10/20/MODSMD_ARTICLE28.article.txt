# Dils waits and waits
## Third QB not complaining 
### Paul Spaeth 
How does it feel to be a third-string Stan
ford quarterback? Just ask former Card Jesse
Freitas. To him, sitting on the bench was
intolerable. Totally frustrated, he transfer
red to San Diego State. This year's third
stringer has no intentions of leaving the
Farm prematurely.
Steve Dils, Stanford's back-up quarter
back behind Guy Benjamin and Mike Cor
dova, is not going to let himself get down.
"It is easy to get frustrated when you don't
play," says Dils. "I have myself mentally
and physically prepared to play, and when I
don't get in, it is very disheartening."
But Dils, a second-team All-State high
school quarterback from Vancouver, Wash.,
does not protest his lack of playing time.
"When I chose to go to Stanford," he said
"the coaches were very straight forward
with me. They didn't promise me a starting
job, but said I could have it if I earned it. So I
worked hard my freshman year and won the
starting job on the junior varsity team. I was
redshirted my sophomore year, so I didn't
play at all. But this year I hope to get in as
the season progresses. Besides, how can I
complain when I sit behind two outstand
ing quarterbacks?"
It is puzzling to think that anyone sought
after by seven Pacific-8 football teams
would choose to sit and watch his team
mates when he could be playing elsewhere.
No regrets
"Transferring to another school has cros
sed my mind occasionally," Dils admits,
"but that's all. I have no doubt in my mind
that I made the right decision in coming to
Stanford, because they base their offensive
attack on passing. I love to throw the foot

ball, and passing makes for a much more
exciting game than running. But when I
look at teams such as Oregon, Oregon State,
Washington and Washington State, where 1
could probably be starting, I wonder what it
would be like to play every game."
Dils has a while to wait before he experi
ences that feeling. With Cordova graduating
this year and Benjamin graduating next
year, Dils will only have one year to prove
himself.
Despite the competition for the starting
job, Dils says his relationship with his two
quarterbacking teammates is good.
"I get along real well with Guy and
Mike," Dils says. "They are helpful to me on
the field and are nice guys off the field. In
fact, everyone on the team is pretty easy to
get along with. There are no big feuds."

Regarding the coaches, however, Dils
does express a few laments. "The coaches
do a pretty good job. They spend long hours
in getting the team primed for each oppo
nent and 1 do not begrudge their work. But it
kind of bothers me that I don't play more or
even get more time in practice."
For one who hasn't seen a minute of ac
tion this season, one can hardly blame him
for voicing some mixed emotions. "Against
Michigan 1 thought 1 might have gotten in
because we were being beat so bad," Dils
said. "But against Army, I was certain I
would play. Guy has hurt that game so 1 was
moved up to the No. 2 spot. At second-string
and with a 20-0 lead in the third quarter, I
couldn't think of a reason why I shouldn't
go in."
But as the game waned and Army came
back and upset the Cardinals, Dils' hopes
vanished.
No grad school
Following college, Dils hopes for further
involvement in football, either in a playing
or in a non-playing role. "I don't plan on
going to graduate school," Dils says. "With
a Stanford degree I have a lot of alternatives.
1 may go home and get into business, or get
involved in some sort of athletics as an
agent. I'm not counting on professional
football as a prospect. Although it would be
nice to receive a firm offer from a pro team, I
don't want to get frustrated chasing any
wild promises."
Anticipating no real shake-up in Stanford
starting lineup, Dils can only look ahead to
next season. But he confronts his problem
without rancor. "Being third-string, I can't
really complain. Not playing is a reality I'm
going to have to cope with."

play," says Dils. "I have myself mentally
and physically prepared to play, and when I
don't get in, it is very disheartening."
But Dils, a second-team All-State high
school quarterback from Vancouver, Wash.,
does not protest his lack of playing time.
"When I chose to go to Stanford," he said
"the coaches were very straight forward
with me. They didn't promise me a starting
job, but said I could have it if I earned it. So I
worked hard my freshman year and won the
starting job on the junior varsity team. I was
redshirted my sophomore year, so I didn't
play at all. But this year I hope to get in as
the season progresses. Besides, how can I
complain when I sit behind two outstand
ing quarterbacks?"
It is puzzling to think that anyone sought
after by seven Pacific-8 football teams
would choose to sit and watch his team
mates when he could be playing elsewhere.
No regrets
"Transferring to another school has cros
sed my mind occasionally," Dils admits,
"but that's all. I have no doubt in my mind
that I made the right decision in coming to
Stanford, because they base their offensive
attack on passing. I love to throw the foot

ball, and passing makes for a much more
exciting game than running. But when I
look at teams such as Oregon, Oregon State,
Washington and Washington State, where 1
could probably be starting, I wonder what it
would be like to play every game."
Dils has a while to wait before he experi
ences that feeling. With Cordova graduating
this year and Benjamin graduating next
year, Dils will only have one year to prove
himself.
Despite the competition for the starting
job, Dils says his relationship with his two
quarterbacking teammates is good.
"I get along real well with Guy and
Mike," Dils says. "They are helpful to me on
the field and are nice guys off the field. In
fact, everyone on the team is pretty easy to
get along with. There are no big feuds."

Regarding the coaches, however, Dils
does express a few laments. "The coaches
do a pretty good job. They spend long hours
in getting the team primed for each oppo
nent and 1 do not begrudge their work. But it
kind of bothers me that I don't play more or
even get more time in practice."
For one who hasn't seen a minute of ac
tion this season, one can hardly blame him
for voicing some mixed emotions. "Against
Michigan 1 thought 1 might have gotten in
because we were being beat so bad," Dils
said. "But against Army, I was certain I
would play. Guy has hurt that game so 1 was
moved up to the No. 2 spot. At second-string
and with a 20-0 lead in the third quarter, I
couldn't think of a reason why I shouldn't
go in."
But as the game waned and Army came
back and upset the Cardinals, Dils' hopes
vanished.
No grad school
Following college, Dils hopes for further
involvement in football, either in a playing
or in a non-playing role. "I don't plan on
going to graduate school," Dils says. "With
a Stanford degree I have a lot of alternatives.
1 may go home and get into business, or get
involved in some sort of athletics as an
agent. I'm not counting on professional
football as a prospect. Although it would be
nice to receive a firm offer from a pro team, I
don't want to get frustrated chasing any
wild promises."
Anticipating no real shake-up in Stanford
starting lineup, Dils can only look ahead to
next season. But he confronts his problem
without rancor. "Being third-string, I can't
really complain. Not playing is a reality I'm
going to have to cope with."

worked hard my freshman year and won the
starting job on the junior varsity team. I was
redshirted my sophomore year, so I didn't
play at all. But this year I hope to get in as
the season progresses. Besides, how can I
complain when I sit behind two outstand
ing quarterbacks?"
It is puzzling to think that anyone sought
after by seven Pacific-8 football teams
would choose to sit and watch his team
mates when he could be playing elsewhere.
No regrets
"Transferring to another school has cros
sed my mind occasionally," Dils admits,
"but that's all. I have no doubt in my mind
that I made the right decision in coming to
Stanford, because they base their offensive
attack on passing. I love to throw the foot

ball, and passing makes for a much more
exciting game than running. But when I
look at teams such as Oregon, Oregon State,
Washington and Washington State, where 1
could probably be starting, I wonder what it
would be like to play every game."
Dils has a while to wait before he experi
ences that feeling. With Cordova graduating
this year and Benjamin graduating next
year, Dils will only have one year to prove
himself.
Despite the competition for the starting
job, Dils says his relationship with his two
quarterbacking teammates is good.
"I get along real well with Guy and
Mike," Dils says. "They are helpful to me on
the field and are nice guys off the field. In
fact, everyone on the team is pretty easy to
get along with. There are no big feuds."

Regarding the coaches, however, Dils
does express a few laments. "The coaches
do a pretty good job. They spend long hours
in getting the team primed for each oppo
nent and 1 do not begrudge their work. But it
kind of bothers me that I don't play more or
even get more time in practice."
For one who hasn't seen a minute of ac
tion this season, one can hardly blame him
for voicing some mixed emotions. "Against
Michigan 1 thought 1 might have gotten in
because we were being beat so bad," Dils
said. "But against Army, I was certain I
would play. Guy has hurt that game so 1 was
moved up to the No. 2 spot. At second-string
and with a 20-0 lead in the third quarter, I
couldn't think of a reason why I shouldn't
go in."
But as the game waned and Army came
back and upset the Cardinals, Dils' hopes
vanished.
No grad school
Following college, Dils hopes for further
involvement in football, either in a playing
or in a non-playing role. "I don't plan on
going to graduate school," Dils says. "With
a Stanford degree I have a lot of alternatives.
1 may go home and get into business, or get
involved in some sort of athletics as an
agent. I'm not counting on professional
football as a prospect. Although it would be
nice to receive a firm offer from a pro team, I
don't want to get frustrated chasing any
wild promises."
Anticipating no real shake-up in Stanford
starting lineup, Dils can only look ahead to
next season. But he confronts his problem
without rancor. "Being third-string, I can't
really complain. Not playing is a reality I'm
going to have to cope with."
