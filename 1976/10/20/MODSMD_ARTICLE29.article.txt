# Marvin: the man behind the scenes
## Equipment manager versatile performer 
### Dean Eyre 
"Doc" Marvin's official title is "head
equipment manager" for Stanford athletic
teams. But in the course of his duties, he be
comes a combination manager-dry cleaner
repairman-supervisor-guard-counselor.
Marvin's job entails the coordination of
every aspect of management from requisitions
and purchases to disposal of athletic supplies.
A "morning person" by nature, Marvin begins
his job at 7 a.m. and works until 5:30 p.m.
Laundry, the most time-consuming part of
the job, means cleaning and preparing all
team uniforms. Since fall sports, other than
football, require little equipment, team mana
gers and coaches handle its distribution. Mar
vin credits a "good bunch of managers" for
lightening his work load.
Weekends aren't days off for Marvin and his
assistants. Preparations for home games begin
at 7 a.m. with the distribution of equipment
and the readying of the locker rooms. A 1:30
kickoff may mean working until 6 p.m. col
lecting uniforms and cleaning up. Including
the junior varsity team, Marvin must outfit a
total of 124 football players each week.
Behind the scenes
Marvin emphasizes that most people who
watch a game see only the end result of a lot of
work. Behind the scenes, eight or nine hours
go into preparation. Work goes on even during
the game. For example, in a game against
Duke in 1972, linebacker jim Merlo broke the
cage on his helmet. Marvin put on an entirely
new cage within four plays.
Sports equipment has changed with the
times. Not long ago, there were no face guards

on football helmets. Today, the protective gear
is formed from high-impact plastic in most
cases. Marvin specializes in handling the
"hard" equipment, leaving the padding work
to the trainers.
As the quality of equipment has risen over
the years, so has its cost. A helmet which used
to cost $15 now sells for $30, and a chin strap
once available for 70 cents goes for two or
three dollars. Jerseys, at $20 apiece, aren't
cheap either, while pants run $15-$lB.
Big bucks
Marvin supervises the use of a quarter of a
million dollars worth of equipment, of which
$50,000-$75,000 worth must be replaced an
nually.
Having attended almost every Stanford
football game since he came to the Farm in
1954, Marvin runs an equipment room which
resembles a sports hall of fame. Sports
memorabilia, including news clippings, team
and player photos, sideline passes and a Bike
1972 Rose Bowl jock, adorn the walls and
doors.
Despite the repititious nature of his job,
Marvin says it does offer the chance to meet
fascinating people. Explaining that he likes
"working with young guys," Marvin has had
many close friends on the teams, especially
the Rose Bowl teams of '71 and '72. A particu
lar favorite was Hillary Shockley, who looked
to Marvin as a counselor in whom he could
confide.
Marvin's personality can best be condensed
into his self-description as "61 years old going
on 18." For the sake of Stanford's athletic
program, he'd better remain young at heart.
