# Union accepts contract by 17-vote margin
## 
### Pam Demetrakakes 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
voted yesterday to accept a three-year
contract with the university by a
razor-thin margin of 367 votes to 350 at
Memorial Auditorium.
Although the contract met USE's
demands on several issues, USE presi
dent Roger Hardy said there was dis
satisfation with the provisions on pay
increases and on free parking.
The contract will go into effect re
troactive to last Sept. 1. The date of its
signing "will depend on language
changes" still to be negotiated, accord
ing to Hardy.
The contract provides for a 7.5 per
cent raise in workers' pay this year, a
six per cent increase next year, and a
five per cent plus cost of living in
crease in 1978. USE had asked for
raises of 14 per cent this year and seven
per cent next year.
"Stanford workers will continue to
be the most underpaid workers in the
Bay Area," Hardy said.
Parking issue delayed
The contract, in effect, delays for one
year consideration of free parking for
USE members. The previous contract,
which expired last month, had granted
free parking.
In a separate vote, the union mem
bers rejected the dental plan offered by
the university in favor of the medical
plan they already have, which does not
include dental coverage.
USE negotiator Florie Berger said
the university's plan would have dis
criminated against workers without
dependents because it stipulated that
the $20 per year provided for depen
dents could not be used in any other
way.
Reclassification
USE was successful in keeping out
the "quick claim" clause, which
would have restricted requests for a

change in job classification only to
those workers whose jobs had changed
prior to the signing of the contract. A
worker's job classification helps de
termine his salary.
Other provisions of the contract in
clude:
—A "range adjustment" for next
year. One per cent of USE's total
payroll will go to workers who have
suffered loss of income through mis
classification in the past.
—Benefits for workers on seasonal

layoff, most of whom are gardeners.
—A 50 per cent increase in sever
ance pay.
—Addition of nine more shop
stewards.
—A joint affirmative action commit
tee.
—Apprenticeship committees.
University employment will remain
under a "modified union shop" sys
tem, which means that new workers
will either have to join USE or pay an
amount equivalent to the union's dues.
