Prop. 14 endorsements denounced
Sacramento — Both Jimmy Carter and Gov. Ed
mund Brown Jr. were denounced by a Democratic
state assemblyman yesterday for their endorsement
of Prop. 14, the farm labor initiative.
Assemblyman John Thurman (D-Modesto) told a
"No on 14" rally on the capitol lawn that farm
workers average $2.04 an hour in Georgia, and
$3.08 an hour in California.
"What does a farmer from Georgia have to say
about what a California farmer needs?" Thurman
asked.
Thurman, chairman of the Assembly Agriculture
Committee, called Brown's endorsement of Prop.
14 "a sorry reflection on the integrity and dignity of
the office of governor."
Verbal attacks continue in campaign
With only two weeks left in the presidential
campaign, President Gerald Ford and Democratic
challenger Jimmy Carter stuck with familiar tactics
yesterday, each accusing the other of neglecting
essential national needs.
Campaigning in Miami, Carter told the American
Public Health Association that the Nixon and Ford
administrations were responsible for "slashing one
essential health care program after another."
Ford used a White House Rose Garden ceremony
to say, "There still remains an insistent cry that we
slash billions and billions of dollars from our de
fense budget in order to pay for a galaxy of new
social programs."
Ford repeatedly has accused Carter of advocating
cuts of up to $15 billion in the defense budget.
Carter has said he can't remember using that figure

and declared that $5 to $7 billion could be cut from
the Pentagon budget through better management.
GNP growth rate slows
Washington — The economy's growth rate drop
ped in the summer quarter below the level neces
sary to whittle down the jobless rolls, the govern
ment reported yesterday.
The Commerce Department said the volume of
Gross National Product grew by four per cent on an
annual rate from July through September, mainly
because of a slower pace of investment in produc
tive facilities and housing.
The growth was down from 4.5 per cent the pre
vious quarter and 9.2 per cent in the first three
months of the year. It was the slowest growth since
the 3.3 per cent in the last three months of 1975.
Only U.S. stresses flu vaccinations
Geneva, Switzerland — America's swine flu
vaccination program.is not exactly a shot being felt
around the world.
World Health Organization (WHO) officials say
at least 10 countries are presently producing swine
flu vaccine and others are prepared to import it but
that only the United States is mounting a campaign
to inoculate most of its citizens.
The WHO spokesman said there have been no
new swine flu cases si nee those at FortDix. N.J., last
January and that there are no indications now that a
worldwide epidemic is likely to break out. How
ever, he praised those countries preparing for a
possible outbreak.
"It certainly will giveadded safety to vaccinate as
many people as possible, particularly as this would

make it much easier to contain the disease should it
break out," the spokesman said.
Today's weather

locally inland over the area tonight. Otherwise
sunny through tomorrow but with variable high
cloudiness at times. Little temperature change.
Lows in the 50s. Highs in the 60s to low 70s. Light

new swine flu cases si nee those at FortDix. N.J., last
January and that there are no indications now that a
worldwide epidemic is likely to break out. How
ever, he praised those countries preparing for a
possible outbreak.
"It certainly will giveadded safety to vaccinate as
many people as possible, particularly as this would

make it much easier to contain the disease should it
break out," the spokesman said.

Prop. 14 endorsements denounced
Sacramento — Both Jimmy Carter and Gov. Ed
mund Brown Jr. were denounced by a Democratic
state assemblyman yesterday for their endorsement
of Prop. 14, the farm labor initiative.
Assemblyman John Thurman (D-Modesto) told a
"No on 14" rally on the capitol lawn that farm
workers average $2.04 an hour in Georgia, and
$3.08 an hour in California.
"What does a farmer from Georgia have to say
about what a California farmer needs?" Thurman
asked.
Thurman, chairman of the Assembly Agriculture
Committee, called Brown's endorsement of Prop.
14 "a sorry reflection on the integrity and dignity of
the office of governor."
Verbal attacks continue in campaign
With only two weeks left in the presidential
campaign, President Gerald Ford and Democratic
challenger Jimmy Carter stuck with familiar tactics
yesterday, each accusing the other of neglecting
essential national needs.
Campaigning in Miami, Carter told the American
Public Health Association that the Nixon and Ford
administrations were responsible for "slashing one
essential health care program after another."
Ford used a White House Rose Garden ceremony
to say, "There still remains an insistent cry that we
slash billions and billions of dollars from our de
fense budget in order to pay for a galaxy of new
social programs."
Ford repeatedly has accused Carter of advocating
cuts of up to $15 billion in the defense budget.
Carter has said he can't remember using that figure

and declared that $5 to $7 billion could be cut from
the Pentagon budget through better management.
GNP growth rate slows
Washington — The economy's growth rate drop
ped in the summer quarter below the level neces
sary to whittle down the jobless rolls, the govern
ment reported yesterday.
The Commerce Department said the volume of
Gross National Product grew by four per cent on an
annual rate from July through September, mainly
because of a slower pace of investment in produc
tive facilities and housing.
The growth was down from 4.5 per cent the pre
vious quarter and 9.2 per cent in the first three
months of the year. It was the slowest growth since
the 3.3 per cent in the last three months of 1975.
