Correction
In yesterday's Daily, it was incorrectly reported
that the faculty Advisory Board which recom
mended dismissal of former Assoc. English Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin sustained the charge against
Franklin for his involvement in the disruption of a
speech given here by Henry Cabot Lodge.
In fact, the board unanimously found that
Franklin had not "significantly contributed" to the
disruption of that speech. However, the board
unanimously agreed that Franklin should be
punished for a Feb. 10,1971 speech in White Plaza.
A majority of the board also said Franklin should
be disciplined for encouraging resistance to a
police dispersal order at the Computation Center
the same day and for inciting confrontation during
an Old Union rally that night.
