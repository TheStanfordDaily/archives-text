# South African arms embargo blocked

United Nations, N.Y. (AP) — The
three permanent Western members of
the Security Council vetoed a Third
World resolution yesterday that would
have had the council declare a binding
arms embargo against South Africa to
force it out of South-West Africa.
The decision climaxed a debate that
continued intermittently over IV2
months on how to get South Africa out
of the disputed territory, also known as
Namibia.
The vote in the 15-nation council
was 10-3 with Italy and Japan abstain
ing.
Some of those abstaining or voting
against the proposal suggested its
adoption might hinder current U.S. ef
forts to bring black majority rule to
South-West Africa and neighboring
Rhodesia.
China, the Soviet Union and Swe
den voted for the resolution along with
the sponsors — Benin, Libya, Tan
zania, Guyana, Panama, Romania and
Pakistan.
The proposal died by the negative
votes of the United States. Britain and
France, which as permanent members
of the council along with the Soviet
Union and China, hold veto power.
It was the third triple veto in U.N.
history. The same three countries vet
oed a similar resolution June 9, 1975,
and a proposal to expel South Africa
from the United Nations on Sept. 30,
1974.
The proposed resolution sought to
have the council say that, "acting
under Chapter 7 of the United Nations
charter," it "determines that the illegal
occupation of Namibia and the anti

guerilla war being waged there by
South Africa constitute a threat to in
ternational peace and security."
Under that chapter, such a finding is
a prerequisite to a binding order from
the council to the nations of the world
to take diplomatic, economic or milit
ary action against the country deemed
to be creating the threat.
The resolution aimed to have the
council decide "that all states shall"
end any military cooperation and arms
licensing arrangements with South
Africa, stop any recruitment of mer
cenaries for it and prevent the supply
to it of arms, ammunition, planes and
spare parts.
A comprehensive economic boycott
against Rhodesia dating back to 1966
is the only similar enforcement action,
or so-called sanctions, now in effect.
Some Western diplomats held that
the outcome of the Namibia debate
would not hurt Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger's efforts to get South
Africa to withdraw from the territory
voluntarily. Others contended that it
might stiffen the backs of hardline
whites against concessions by the
white minority officials of both South
Africa and Rhodesia.
Kissinger's diplomacy in Africa and
elsewhere has aimed at a shift from
white minority to black majority rule
both in Rhodesia, which declard un
ilateral independence from Britain 11
years ago, and Namibia, which South
Africa still controls 10 years after the
General Assembly declared its League
of Nations mandate over the territory
terminated.
