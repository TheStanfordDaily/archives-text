The make-up of the new ASSU Sen
ate, tenure and the workings of last
year's ASSU Senate were among the
topics discussed by the ASSU Council
of Presidents (COP) on KZSU's Cam
pus Conference last night.
In response to a question about the
seriousness of new senate members
from the Hammer and Coffin slate, vice
president Carole Houck said, "I really
don't know that many of them person
ally, but we have all taken the attitude
that these are people interested in run
ning (for the senate). If they worked
hard enough to get themselves elected,
we have to hope that they are con
cerned about the job they are going to
take."
Vic Petroff, COP president, added
that the "Hand C" slate helped to gen
erate a high voter turnout, but that is
sues, such as tenure, the honor code
and the judicial system, also helped
draw nearly 3000 students to the polls.
Vice president Al Tomasczuk said

that the interest at the polls has carried
over to other areas, as he said the de
mand for ASSU committee applica
tions has been "incredible."
The highest priority of the senate,
said Petroff, was tenure.
"We believe there is no issue which
threatens the university as much as ten
ure," he said. Petroff went on to out
line the ASSU's attempts to become
involved in the tenure process through
an informal group, Students Interested
in Tenure (SIT).
"Out of SIT, a task force consisting
of faculty and students was formed to
evaluate tenure," Petroff said. "They
have been meeting since June and will
come out with a report sometime dur
ing winter quarter.
"We requested from each depart
ment the names of all those instructors
with tenure hearings coming up. This
letter was mailed on July 14," Petroff
said.
"On July 22, a memo was sent by the
administration to all department
heads in the School of Hand S
(Humanities and Sciences) instructing
the department not to comply with the
request. Since that time, we have re
ceived the names of some of those who
are up for hearings, and we assume
that this has been cleared with the uni
versity."
"We're not interested in discovering
what particular information is in his or
her (the instructor's) file. We just want
students to be aware that a person is
coming up for review so students can
make some comment generally on
teaching quality or service to the uni
versity, or in some cases, research abil
ity," said Tomasczuk.
In reference to last year's senate, Pet
roff said, "I tend to regard last year's
senate as a fluke year. 1 have seen sen
ates operate much more effectively
than last year's in the past."

tions has been "incredible."
The highest priority of the senate,
said Petroff, was tenure.
"We believe there is no issue which
threatens the university as much as ten
ure," he said. Petroff went on to out
line the ASSU's attempts to become
involved in the tenure process through
an informal group, Students Interested
in Tenure (SIT).
"Out of SIT, a task force consisting
of faculty and students was formed to
evaluate tenure," Petroff said. "They
have been meeting since June and will
come out with a report sometime dur
ing winter quarter.
"We requested from each depart
ment the names of all those instructors
with tenure hearings coming up. This
letter was mailed on July 14," Petroff
said.
"On July 22, a memo was sent by the
administration to all department
heads in the School of Hand S
(Humanities and Sciences) instructing
the department not to comply with the
request. Since that time, we have re
ceived the names of some of those who
are up for hearings, and we assume
that this has been cleared with the uni
versity."
"We're not interested in discovering
what particular information is in his or
her (the instructor's) file. We just want
students to be aware that a person is
coming up for review so students can
make some comment generally on
teaching quality or service to the uni
versity, or in some cases, research abil
ity," said Tomasczuk.
In reference to last year's senate, Pet
roff said, "I tend to regard last year's
senate as a fluke year. 1 have seen sen
ates operate much more effectively
than last year's in the past."
The make-up of the new ASSU Sen
ate, tenure and the workings of last
year's ASSU Senate were among the
topics discussed by the ASSU Council
of Presidents (COP) on KZSU's Cam
pus Conference last night.
In response to a question about the
seriousness of new senate members
from the Hammer and Coffin slate, vice
president Carole Houck said, "I really
don't know that many of them person
ally, but we have all taken the attitude
that these are people interested in run
ning (for the senate). If they worked
hard enough to get themselves elected,
we have to hope that they are con
cerned about the job they are going to
take."
Vic Petroff, COP president, added
that the "Hand C" slate helped to gen
erate a high voter turnout, but that is
sues, such as tenure, the honor code
and the judicial system, also helped
draw nearly 3000 students to the polls.
Vice president Al Tomasczuk said

that the interest at the polls has carried
over to other areas, as he said the de
mand for ASSU committee applica
tions has been "incredible."
