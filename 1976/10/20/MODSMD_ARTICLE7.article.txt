## Opinions Volunteers run stop-out program

Skimming the Daily on Oct. 15, I
saw a column about the stop-out prog
ram. Naturally, I was interested, as I
had just come from a meeting with the
other stop-out counselors, the Director
of Student Employment, and her assis
tant. I would like to reply to the com
ments which Mark Albertson made.
The reason that there were no stu
dent counselors available for him to
talk to during registration week is that
the counselors, too, had to move into
their residences, buy books, figure out
schedules, and find jobs. However, if
he had asked to see one of the staff
counselors, he could have.
At the meeting, we had been discus
sing the very problems which were
pointed out in the column. As a matter
of fact, we had just agreed upon a sys
tem for making sure that the appoint
ments made by students would be kept
by counselors. We also talked about
the problem of helping unemployed,
stopped-out students.
First crack
The main aspects are: how do we
know that the people who come in say
ing that they're stopped-out are Stan
ford students? When jobs are few, who
gets first crack, registered or unregis
tered students? We decided that the
appointment with a stop-out coun
selor would be a good device for
monitoring the use of the services of
the Student Employment Office.
At this point I would like to com
ment on some of the other issues
which Mark Albertson raised. In order
to do so, I need to explain a little bit
about the stop-out program's goals and
resources.
The main goal of the program is to
meet the needs of students who want
to stop going to school for a while.

These needs fall into three basic
categories: getting out of and back into
the system (credit evaluation, finan
cial aid, etc.) with a minimum of pain;
figuring out what to do while they're
out of school; and deciding whether to
stop out. We meet these needs by pas
sing out information such as what the
Housing Office is likely to do if you
move out of your dorm room in mid
quarter.
Passing on facts
As prospective counselors we spent
a quarter learning how to listen, the
mechanics of stopping out, and the re
sources available to someone not in
school. How does not having stopped
out ourselves affect our abilities to
pass on facts and to listen?
Finally, I would agree with Mark
Albertson's statement, "It is clear that
the university needs time to set up an
organized and useful counseling prog
ram for its stop-out students." But
there is a problem here. Albertson as
sumes the present program is directly
under the wing of "the university."
(Who is "the university"?)
Last year the stop-out program was
kept alive, largely, by the efforts of
volunteer students. This year we have
the support of Alean Clark, the director
of student employment. She helps in
whatever ways she can, but it's not her
job to expand and improve the stop
out program.
The point is this; it's difficult for
volunteer students to run an efficient,
continuous program. I think we're
doing a good job, given our limited
time. 1 will welcome Albertson, and
anyone else, who wants to help with
the program.
(Liz Buckland, a senior in sociology, is
a stop-out counselor.)
