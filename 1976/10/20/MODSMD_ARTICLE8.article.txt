# Letters: Stopping out, Carter

Volunteer stop-out assistance
In fairness to the peer counselors in
the Student Employment Office at the
Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC), I would like to respond to the
comments in the Daily on Oct. 15, re
garding "stop-out" counseling.
These counselors are students who
volunteer assistance when their
schedules permit. It would not seem
unreasonable then that at a given mo
ment they might be elusive; especially
on Registration Day.
They work without compenstion
because they want to be helpful and
because they realize that the hours of
counseling to be done exceeds the time
available to the regular staff.
It is more than apparent that the au
thor of the column has a few bugs in
his own system when it comes to seek
ing counsel. There are several profes
sional counselors at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center, all of
whom usually are present there every
day. This fact is widely publicized.
Consequently, most students use the
counseling services of the Center effec
tively.
This is not to defend CPPC's short
comings. We have our share. Some
times we try and fail. Often we make
mistakes.
The staff appreciates and wants to

learn from all legitimate suggestions
and complaints. At the same time, the
"cheap shots" should be identified.

Need of sanctuary
Those who plan to vote for a minor
party candidate as a protest against
Ford and Carter should consider that
for some human beings the outcome
of the next election is literally a matter
of life or death. Under the Nixon and
Ford administrations the United States
has refused entry to thousands of re
fugees from Chile.
There are hundreds of Chileans
and Uruguayans now in Argentina
who are in danger either of being sent
back to torture and prison in their own
countries or harrassment and death at
the hands of right wing terrorists in
Argentina.
Carter has spoken out strongly
against U.S. support for these regimes.
The election of Ford this November
could virtually seal the fate of those in
desperate need of sanctuary. This is
something to remember when we go to
the polls.

Intelligent candidates
I am tired of political writers who
persistently reduce campaigns to the
level of T.V. westerns. In the Daily this
week Pete McCloskey is the man wear
ing the black hat, bandana,shirt, pants
and boots. He was "SNEAKY" Pete on
Tuesday. On Monday he was the man
out to get your grandmother because
the National Alliance for Senior Citi
zens gave him a bad rating.
But you would not have to bike far to
find David Harris dressed in an equally
unsuitable black costume.
We have two intelligent candidates
who have each made an effort to define
their areas of disagreement, who have
stated their congressional goals speci
fically, who do not shy away from is
sues bound to be unpopular with a
good share of the voters.
Enviable. Especially when we look
at the insulting travesty of planned
mediocrity in the presidential cam
paign.
We should vote for Harris or
McCloskey because we feel one of
them has better ideas or a better
perspective on problems and not be
cause we have convinced ourselves
that the other candidate must be
placed on our personal "enemies list."
