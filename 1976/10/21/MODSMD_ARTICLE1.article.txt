# Overseas votes stump ASSU
## Tenth-place tie in senate race 
### Kathy Trafton 
An unprecedented tie for 10th place
in the undergraduate ASSU senate
race between Barry Parr and Tim Fer
guson has been caused by overseas
campus votes. ASSU officials say that
they do not know how to deal with the
situation.
Elections Commissioner Randy Bird
claimed that there has "never been a
tie for 10th place in the senate in the
past. This is a really bizarre happen
ing. I don't know if there's any way out
of it. There may not even be a senate, at
least, there probably won't be one
without breaking the rules."
ASSU President Vic Petroff said, "I
think that (Bird's statement that there
may not be a senate) is silly. Parr, Fer
guson and Bird are competent enough
to realize that it's more important to
havea senatethan to fight all yearover
who gets 10th place."
Catch-22'
ASSU By-laws state that all ASSU
elections shall be certified by the se
nate, and this includes the senate elec
tion itself, Bird explained. The
"catch-22" is that, according to the
by-laws, the senate cannot meet to de
cide how to deal with the situation un
less it has exactly 21 voting members
— 10 undergraduate senators, 10
graduate senators and one chairman.
As there would now be 22 members,
the election results cannot be certified,

said Bird.
Bird said that he has received ballots
from all of the overseas campuses ex
cept for Salamanca, Spain and Bonn,
Germany.
Bird said that he "stated specifically
in letters to the overseas campuses that
a deadline of Oct. 20,1976 had been set
(for ballots to be in). Is it enforceable?"
Petroff claimed that "traditionally,
ballots that came in from overseas up
to the point when the senate first met
were counted. Is that appropriate in a
situation where the people in 10th
i place know the results?"
Floating elections
Petroff said he was concerned that
the two contenders could call up the
campuses and try to rustle up more
votes.
i "Votes could keep coming in, the
election could float for weeks, and we
still wouldn't have a senate,"
lamented Petroff.
112 Petroff said that Bird cannot end the
• elections. "The Election Commis
• sioner's technical duties are over. The
! election's been held."
! Only the senate is given power to
- end the elections according to the by
■ laws.
> In such a situation, the Committee of
) the Senate would normally be called
. upon to decide which candidate
, should be the 10th seat.
The Summer Senate, as the Commit

tee is called, was supposed to be
created before or duing the last senate
meeting of the spring quarter. Senators
appoint either themselves or desig
nees who will be in the area during the
summer to be on call should the Coun
cil of Presidents (COP) desire a meet
ing.
Petroff said that the senators were
, "lax last year. Less than 11 senators
i even bothered to appoint someone (to
: serve on the Summer Senate), and 11
l are needed for a quorum. Now we ha
i ven't a Summer Senate."
"We're going to have to reject these
documents (the constitution and the
t by-laws) and have them re-done," con
; tinued Petroff.
} Petroff explained that he feels there
are several courses of action to follow.
3 There could be an orientation meeting
; of the 21 senators, who would then
' direct Bird, or possibly Bird should
take the two candidates in question
3 aside and "devise some equitable sys
tem — maybe flip a coin."
i Run-off not possible
The constitution says that there can
) be a run-off election only for offices
- with one winner, said Petroff.
The most "credible and democratic"
112 solution, according to Petroff, would
1 be to have the new senate certify the
3 top ten vote totals.
Petroff continued that the senate
- "should take up the matter of which of

the people in 10th place should be the
senator. Neither (Parr nor Ferguson)
should be in the proceedings."
Petroff said he felt it would be
legitimate to have 21 senators until
such a time as a chairperson is ap
pointed.
He said there is a precedent for this
solution. In 1974-75 there were cam
paign violations reported for two of the
top 10 vote-getters. The senate cer
tified the vote totals, and then dealt
with the violators.
