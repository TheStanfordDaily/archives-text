# Heroin legalization case compelling
## 
### 
Bobhi walks into her neighborhood
McDonald's and peruses the menu.
"I'd like a Big Smack and Fries," she
tells the attendant. "To go."
He hands her a hag of heroin and her
fries. "Would you like a needle with
that?" he asks.
"No, thanks," she says. "1 brought
my own."
We might see such a scenario if
America's antiquated, ineffective drug
laws were repealed and heroin (as well
as other drugs) becomes available on
the free market. The argument for
legalization of the sale and production
of heroin is a compelling one.
Government should have no author
ity to restrict an individual's actions
unless those actions produce
economic externalities (and even then,
the extent government should exert its
influence is subject to debate). In the
case of heroin, advocates of its
criminalization claim that exter
nalities exist because addicts must
steal or rob to procure sufficient
money to buy heroin.
However, this argument confuses
cause and effect.
Increasing difficulty
The present effort to suppress heroin
trafficking in the United States raises
immensely the difficulty heroin
suppliers have procuring and dis
tributing the drug. Thus, the price
charged for a bag of heroin is kept arti
ficially high.
Indeed, Law Prof. John Kaplan, in
his article "Primer on Heroin," reports
that addicts are estimated to steal
about $2.5 billion per year to buy he
roin.
Were heroin opened to the rigors of
the competitive market, all evidence
indicates that its price would drop
markedly.
The British National Health Service
has pills produced for two-and-a-half
cents apiece, reports Richard Ashley
in Heroin. And Kaplan notes that the
morphine equivalent of $30 worth of
heroin is available through legal
channels for about 20 cents.
Consequently, addicts would not
have to raise exorbitant sums to sup
port their habits. In fact, an addict's
weekly expenditure for heroin would
likely be much less than the amount
the average cigarette smoker spends.
One must inquire, though, where
the addict would obtain even this
small amount of money. Is it possible
for him to do productive work and still
be addicted to heroin?
Affirmative answer
A careful analysis of existing medi
cal and social data compels an affirma
tive answer to this question.

Medical authorities are almost in
unanimous agreement that heroin
produces no lasting physiological or
psychological effects. Kaplan cites the
case of an 84-year-old doctor who had
been a morphine addict for 64 years,
yet did not show any evidence of men
tal or physical deterioration.
And a sizable number of medical
experts rate the deleterious effects of

heroin far below those of alcohol or
tobacco.
it is interesting to note that most he
roin addicts do not experience serious
physical withdrawal upon ceasing he
roin use, Kaplan reports. Recent evi
dence indicates that the addiction pro
cess is one of psychological
conditioning rather than a physical
phenomena, he says.
Three doctors, authors of The Road
to Heroin, state "The number of suc
cessful persons who were or are ad
dicted to opiates is an indication that
there is no necessary relationship be
tween opiate use and an unproductive
life."
Prior to the criminalization of he
roin, opium users regularly engaged in
productive work; indeed, the first
criminal statute against heroin(intro
duced in San Francisco) was adopted
partly because it was felt that the
Chinese coolies who used opium
could work harder than American
laborers.
Reasons
Why, then, are present heroin users
usually considered as "unproductive"
members of society, viz. without gain
ful employment? There are many
reasons for the prevalence of this at
titude.
Addicts in today's society have a
hard time finding and holding a job.
for they must spend considerable
amounts of time obtaining drugs and
avoiding legal authorities.
The addict also has no control over
the purity of the heroin he injects.
As a consequence, he never has a
chance to stabilize his dosage — a re
quisite if theaddict is to function fairly
normally again, Kaplan writes. With
stabilization not effected, theaddict is
incapacitated either by the onset of
euphoria or by the onset of with

drawal.
Lastly, an addict has difficulty ob
taining medical treatment. A physi
cian is required by law, states Kaplan,
to withdraw an addict from narcotics
— and this is the least of the addict's
worries, as the addict could be turned
over to the police.
Jeopardize health
The high price of heroin also may
force the addict to jeopardize his
health through poor nutrition or un
sanitary living conditions.
Thus, merely because today's addict
is unable to function as a productive
member of society does not imply that
an addict living in a society where he
roin is obtainable on the free market
would be unproductive.
Another advantage of a free market
distribution of heroin would be the
savings realized through elimination
of drug abuse law enforcement. Also,
no longer would court time be wasted
on drug cases, nor would heroin
suppliers or users have to be impris
oned, as many are now.
F'inally, legalization of the produc
tion and distribution of heroin would
eliminate the control of heroin by or
ganized crime. Heroin has been a very
profitable commodity for organized

crime and removing it from organized
crime's aegis could go a long way to
ward eliminating such crime.
Limitations
One should add here that two limita
tions need to be placed upon the free
use of heroin.
First, the decision to use heroin
should be reserved to adults.
Psychological data indicate that chil
dren lack the maturity to make a
rational decision in these matters.
Secondly, a heroin user would be
held responsible for all infringements
of others' rights the user commits
while on drugs. Just as one drinking
alcohol is held responsible for drunk
driving, a heroin user should have to
obey similar constrictions on his free
dom.
The benefits to be derived from a
free-market in heroin are plentiful; the
costs almost non-existent.
Freedom to use heroin should be an
individual's right — only when soci
ety refrains from legislating in the in
dividual citizen's domain will be the
individual truly be free.
