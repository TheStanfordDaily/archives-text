# McCloskey 'honest'

It really disturbs me to read day after
day in the Daily the same sort of col
umns and letters spewing forth from
David Harris supporters. Can these
students here really he so naive?
Every single one of them has
criticized Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park) on the basis of the malici
ous and deceitful campaign literature
of the Harris campaign. One pamphlet
in particular is filled with half truths
and misrepresentations of McClos
key's position.
Believing this pamphlet is much
akin to buying a Chevrolet because the
salesman told you it was a good car. Is
this how we learn to think here?
McCloskey is described bv one Har
ris supporter as being "sneaky." I
think the word is "honest." What other
politician has the guts to deride the
leader of his own party? Although
McCloskey is a supporter of President
Gerald Ford, he is not vehement about
it, since he like many others is picking
between the lesser of two evils.
This same Harris supporter goes on
to recite from his gospel, "Let You be
the Judge" by Harris. She mentions

that McCloskey votes with Ford more
often than Barry Goldwater, Jr. This is
true, but only half true.
McCloskey also voted against Ford
more often than Barry Goldwater, lr.
The point is that McCloskey votes on
almost every issue and Goldwater,
during the past year, was often absent
because he was running for the Senate
in California.
There are quite a few other half
truths in this pamphlet, and I hope the
less naive student will be able to see
through them. And if you are truly
angered by some of McCloskey's
stands, then 1 suggest you challenge
him openly during one of his appear
ances on campus.
McCloskey will answer you directly
and honestly, and perhaps after talk
ing with him you'll understand more
clearly why he is asking Harris to
withdraw his misleading literature.
My only hope is that your vote will
not be decided on the basis of idealistic
and deceitful propaganda.
