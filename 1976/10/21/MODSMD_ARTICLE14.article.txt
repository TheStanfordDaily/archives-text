In the October 14 issue of the Daily it was
noted that the nearest recycling center was
the Palo Alto center at the end of Embar
cadero.
There is a center just opposite the Stan
ford Credit Union office on Pampas Lane,
which has large facilities for collecting
glass of all kinds, newspapers, slick paper
magazines, and all kinds of cans. It is run by
volunteers but I can assure you from several
deposits there that it gathers immense
quantities of salvage.
E.M.G.
1 got about ten letters telling me about this
place . . . Well, live and learn!
Apparently, the facilities are run by a vol
unteer organization called ALPHA. My
"correspondents" tell me ALPHA is a prog
ram to raise money for training handicap
ped people.
In the past couple of days, I've noticed a
few new bins around campus — specifically
in front of Memorial Church and herein the
good 'ole Daily office. So instead of making
paper airplanes out of your old Dailies, how
'bout dropping them in one of these cans?
And speaking of . . .
What is the level of environmental con
science of the Daily staff? In particular, can

you deny the rumor which holds that un
used Dailies aren't recycled?
C.H.
According to our Business Manager,
Newell LaVoy, there are very few unused
Dailies. But the ones that ARE leftover are
picked up weekly by the ALPHA gang (see
above question).
Once they are delivered, the Dailies are at
the mercy of our readers and the custodians,
who pick up all the leftovers. Nancy
Kirstine at Plant Services also confirmed
that there aren't many unused Dailies, but
she said the few that are left around campus
are usually just thrown away.
On June 7or 8,1 took some negatives up to
the Bookstore so that I could have a few
prints made. I went with the cheaper of the
two photo services. The photos wouldn't
have come back until after I'd gone home to
Tennessee so I asked the man at the
Bookstore the proper procedure, after first
offering him postage money.
He said that I could either have somebody
pick them up for me this summer or I could
get them in the fall when I came back to
school. I mailed my receipt number to a
friend in Palo Alto in July, but the Bookstore
couldn't find my prints. So she chucked the

receipt number.
I came back to school and tried to find out
where the hell my prints were, and they said
they couldn't find them without a receipt
number. I was brushed off by a "By the way,
we're not responsible, you know." Now I
know. Is there any way I can get my photos
or should I just avoid the Bookstore "ser
vice" altogether?
S.C.
I really sympathize with you, because the
same thing happened to me once (at a diffe
rent store), and even after filing a complaint
with the Department of Consumer Affairs I
have yet to see my prints.
I called Bob Sischka at the Bookstore, who
put a "trace" on your film. He says their
records show that it was received from the
processors, and "theoretically, it should be
somewhere in the store."
But after a couple of hours, the film had
yet to turn up. Sishka says either it got lost
in the shuffle of the Bookstore remodeling,
or someone picked it up.
In any case, I'd say don't give up. Who
knows, it may turn up under some dusty
filing cabinet. In the meantime, Sischka
says you should come in and talk to Man
ager James Virgin about some kind of com
pensation, like a new roll of film.

I really sympathize with you, because the
same thing happened to me once (at a diffe
rent store), and even after filing a complaint
with the Department of Consumer Affairs I
have yet to see my prints.
I called Bob Sischka at the Bookstore, who
put a "trace" on your film. He says their
records show that it was received from the
processors, and "theoretically, it should be
somewhere in the store."
But after a couple of hours, the film had
yet to turn up. Sishka says either it got lost
in the shuffle of the Bookstore remodeling,
or someone picked it up.
In any case, I'd say don't give up. Who
knows, it may turn up under some dusty
filing cabinet. In the meantime, Sischka
says you should come in and talk to Man
ager James Virgin about some kind of com
pensation, like a new roll of film.

In the October 14 issue of the Daily it was
noted that the nearest recycling center was
the Palo Alto center at the end of Embar
cadero.
There is a center just opposite the Stan
ford Credit Union office on Pampas Lane,
which has large facilities for collecting
glass of all kinds, newspapers, slick paper
magazines, and all kinds of cans. It is run by
volunteers but I can assure you from several
deposits there that it gathers immense
quantities of salvage.
E.M.G.
1 got about ten letters telling me about this
place . . . Well, live and learn!
Apparently, the facilities are run by a vol
unteer organization called ALPHA. My
"correspondents" tell me ALPHA is a prog
ram to raise money for training handicap
ped people.
In the past couple of days, I've noticed a
few new bins around campus — specifically
in front of Memorial Church and herein the
good 'ole Daily office. So instead of making
paper airplanes out of your old Dailies, how
'bout dropping them in one of these cans?
And speaking of . . .
What is the level of environmental con
science of the Daily staff? In particular, can

you deny the rumor which holds that un
used Dailies aren't recycled?
C.H.
According to our Business Manager,
Newell LaVoy, there are very few unused
Dailies. But the ones that ARE leftover are
picked up weekly by the ALPHA gang (see
above question).
Once they are delivered, the Dailies are at
the mercy of our readers and the custodians,
who pick up all the leftovers. Nancy
Kirstine at Plant Services also confirmed
that there aren't many unused Dailies, but
she said the few that are left around campus
are usually just thrown away.
On June 7or 8,1 took some negatives up to
the Bookstore so that I could have a few
prints made. I went with the cheaper of the
two photo services. The photos wouldn't
have come back until after I'd gone home to
Tennessee so I asked the man at the
Bookstore the proper procedure, after first
offering him postage money.
He said that I could either have somebody
pick them up for me this summer or I could
get them in the fall when I came back to
school. I mailed my receipt number to a
friend in Palo Alto in July, but the Bookstore
couldn't find my prints. So she chucked the

receipt number.
I came back to school and tried to find out
where the hell my prints were, and they said
they couldn't find them without a receipt
number. I was brushed off by a "By the way,
we're not responsible, you know." Now I
know. Is there any way I can get my photos
or should I just avoid the Bookstore "ser
vice" altogether?
