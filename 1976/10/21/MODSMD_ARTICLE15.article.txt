# Harrison's 'My Sweet Lord'
## Plagiarism case examined 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) â€” The
music world has been rocking
over the recent decision by a fed
eral judge in New York that ex-
Beatle George Harrison was
guilty of plagiarism with his hit
song "My Sweet Lord."
Will the case bring a flood of
song-stealing suits? A survey of
Hollywood song writers indi
cates doubt, but at least one
tunesmith predicts plagiarism
cases will increase.
U.S. District Judge Richard
Owen decided last month that
"My Sweet Lord" was "virtually
identical except for one phrase"
to the 1962 hit by the Chiffons,
"He's So Fine." Owen said that
he did not believe Harrison
copied the earlier song deliber
ately, but his subconscious al
ready knew that the melody had
been successful in a song his
conscious mind did not re
member.
Roger Nichols, composer of
"We've Only Just Begun" and
"Let Me Be the One," comments:
"Personally, I'm not concerned.
It's possible there will be a flood
of plagiarism suits like the mal
practice suits against doctors,
but I don't think so.

"It was not a landmark deci
sion; no laws were changed. And
the lifting was so obvious. When
I heard 'My Sweet Lord,' I said,
'That's a ripoff.' I knew I had
heard it before."
fay Livingston
Jay Livingston, who wrote "To
Each His Own," "Mona Lisa,"
"Oue Sera Sera," etc., with part
ner Ray Evans, agreed: "I've
never heard of an important
plagiarism case being won in
court before. Either they are set
tled out of court or the complain
ing party can't prove the song
was stolen.
"Ray and I were sued once on
'Buttons and Bows.' The comp
lainant based his suit on three
notes. We demonstrated in court
48 examples of those three notes
from other songs, including Irish
reels. Needless to say, we won
the case."
"Plagiarism is always an iffy
subject," observes John Green,
who was a songwriter "Body and
Soul," "Coquette," "Out of
Nowhere" before writing and
conducting movie scores. He has
testified as expert witness in
plagiarism suits.
"I explain to the court that
there are only 11 tones in the
musical scale and all songs are
based on combinations of those
11 notes," said Green. "To be to
tally original is a monumental
achievement, especially in the
realm of tonal music and with
such a simplistic form as the
popular song.
"Why did someone like
George Gershwin write hits? It
was because of the way he put
the notes together. I myself built
a career out of eight bars of' Body
and Soul.' The middle strain
meanders through several keys
so unconventially that I was of
fered $5,000 by publishers if I
would change the middle. Hap
pily, I didn't."
Al Kasha
Al Kasha, winner of Oscars for
"The Morning After" (The

Poseidon Adventure) and "We
May Never Love Like This
Again" (The Towering inferno)
dissents with his fellow
songwriters.
"I think the Harrison decision
will bring many more such
suits," Kasha remarked. "And I
think a lot of them will be won. 1
don't want to sound like sour
grapes, but a lot of rock and roll
sounds like other rock and roll:
the writers don't make such ef
fort to be original."
Henry Mancini, prolific com
poser of hits "Days of Wine and
Roses," "Charade" and film
scores, predicts no great increase
in suits.
"They're going on all the
time," he said. "I've had 15 or 20

threats of suits on 'Moon River'
alone, but they don't get very far.
If you can find a similiar tune in
public domain, there's no basis
for a suit.
"Everyone knows that the first
notes of 'What Kind of Fool Am
l?'arethe sameas 'How High the
Moon,' It's what happens after
ward that makes the difference.
"1 suppose it's possible to
plagiarize unconsciously, but if
you're in the pop field your song
won't go too far before someone
notices it. My wife Ginny, who
has been around music all her
life, sometimes will tell me that a
new song of mine sounds like
something else she has heard. So
1 change it. I'm conscious of the
originality of that I write."
