# High court to rule on single-sex school

Philadelphia (AP) — A suit before the U.S. Supreme Court that
would admit girls to an all-male Philadelphia high school can't
help the girl who started it all.
But Susan Vorchheimer, now a college freshman, still believes
the issue ought to be settled.
"1 believe women are mentally equal to men and shouldn't have
to be separated from men for intellectual reasons." the 16-year-old
freshman at the University of Pennsylvania said Tuesday.
"Other girls should be given a chance. I'm sorry 1 didn't have the
opportunity myself," she added.
Susan was 13 when she filed suit to U.S. District Court to open
Central High School to girls. The school had been for males only
since it opened in 1836.
A straight-A student in junior high, she could have attended
Girls' High, the city's school for academically gifted females. She
chose, instead, to enter George Washington High School while the
courts considered her case.
She was admitted to the university at the end of her junior year.
"I didn't want to go to asingle-sex school,"she said. "I think it's a
healthier atmosphere to have co-education.
"I very much wanted to go to Central, which is why I started the
case. If girls went there, it would be one co-ed academic high
school in the city. There is no co-ed academic school in the city
now," she said.
"I'm very happy the case finally reached the Supreme Court and
that we'll be able to get a final decision about it," Susan said. "I
wish the decision would have come when I could have gained by it,
but 1 will be very happy if we win the case."
