# Title IX creating financial problems for many schools
## 
### 
(CPS) —At the same time as women athletes at
colleges across the country are scoring a record
number of dollars due to Title IX, some schools
are having problems keeping up with the budget
game.
Casting a shadow on Title IX's success, the Uni
versity of Minnesota recently said it cannot bring
its women's and men's athletic programs into line
until 1984.
Title IX—the federal law that bans sex dis
crimination in education — mandates that public
and private colleges receiving federal money
must fully comply with guidelines for the law by
July, 1978 or risk loss of funds.
Released by the Department of Health. Educa
tion and Welfare (HEW) more than a year ago, the
guidelines require that schools provide equal ath
letic opportunities tor men and women.
"The assumption that there are vast sums of
money to be shifted from men's athletics is
ludicrous," said University of Minnesota vice
president Walter Bruning. HEW has not yet re
plied to the university's claim.
But at the University of Denver, a private school
of 7500 students, Diane Wendt, director of wo
men's athletics said the school is "making every
effort," to improve its program for women, echo
ing the sentiments of many schools. But she ad
ded, it is unlikely they will achieve equality by
1978 even though the University of Denver's wo
men's budget has skyrocketed from $1000 to
$105,000 in the last six years.
"Breaking down the men's program to build up
the women's is counter-productive," Wendt
explained.

But if necessary. Wendt said she will push for
such belt-tightening.
Title IX critics, such as the National Collegiate
Athletic Association, say they fear the law will
financially undermine men's sports.
Most schools are reluctant to transfer money
from men's to women's sports. Instead, they are
concentrating on gaining more state aid and al
'ouiti ng other school funds to women's programs.
Although the guidelines require equal oppor
tunities for men and women, they do not require
equal funding. But schools must be responsive to
the interests of all students.
For example, what if a college provides an in
tercollegiate basketball team for men, but not for
women? According to Title IX guidelines, if
women are capable of competing with men, the
school can establish a co-ed team. If not and there
are enough women interested in forming a sepa
rate team, the school must provide the women
with equipment, facilities, a coach and travel ex
penses.
Many athletic directors said they are pleased
with the movement towards equality for men and
women athletes. But like the officials at the uni
versities of Minnesota and Denver, some of them
expressed doubt tht they will be ready when HEW
presides over the final judgment in 1978. Because
the guidelines are vague, the athletic directors
said they are uncertain how HEW will judge
whether a school is in compliance.
University of Denver director Wendt said she is
more elated about Title IX's success in improving
women's sports, than she is worried about her
school meeting HEW's deadline.
