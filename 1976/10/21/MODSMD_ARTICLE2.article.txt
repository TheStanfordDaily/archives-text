# Fuller reveals philosophy; advocates individual truth
## 
### Marc Strassman Second of two parts 
R. Buckminster Fuller sat in a comfortable chair on a
low stage at the San Francisco Hyatt Regency, his grand
son Jaime Snyder by his side, to share his life and
philosophy Sunday with an audience of 250 members of
the New Dimensions Foundation.
He criticized as inadequate the analyses of Thomas
Malthus and Karl Marx which claimed there was not
enough on the planet to go around and that the working
class, as the more fit, was superior and more deserving of
survival.
Fuller said that history has entered the era of "world
man. where color has no meaning, as in Mexico, where
there is no (color) line and it all washes together." Man
kind ought to begin operating under "completely new
principles," said Fuller, that realistically take into ac
count the "real wealth" available to people.
Intuition
Fuller discussed in some detail the research of F.S.C.
Northrup at Yale after World War II in which the letters
written by famous scientists immediately before and after
their major discoveries were studied in an effort to detect
similarities.
"The number one factor in their success was their intui
tion," reported Fuller. But, he added, the second most
important factor in their achievements was "their second
intuition, which told them 'what you've got to do with
what you've discovered.'"
Fuller then emphasized the importance of this second
intuition — of the need to reduce theoretical insights to
common practice.
Speaking in general
He also discovered the |oy of "breaking through lan
guage barriers to generalizations" to facilitate communi
cation between persons, he said.
"It is possible to deal with specialists by being a

generalist," he said, reminiscing over the days in 1940
when he was the science and technology consultant for
Fortune Magazine.
He spent much of his time talking with engineering
vice-presidents of companies, and found that he could
converse with them because he was "familiar with
generalizations."
To live
And what of the proper conduct of one's life?
"The moment you begin to start doing what you want to
do, it's all new," he commented.
"Pride does not want me to go on with a mistake," he
said. "Who are you kidding when you're wrong?" It is
only oneself.
"As soon as you let go of what's wrong," he observed, "a
curtain goes up and you can see what is."
He said that the project he had set for himself in 1927 of
reducing ideas to artifacts was "a 50 year task."
As that 50 year period now concludes, there has finally
been, he observed, "a very mysterious payoff."
Fuller stressed the need for personal responsibility.
"We can't delegate things to politicians," he stressed. And
yet he mused, "I know how little I know."
He ended his presentation by discussing an exhibit he
recently prepared for the Hewitt-Cooper Smithsonian
Museum of Design in New York City. These artifacts will
be housed in a mansion in the City that was once the home
of Andrew Carnegie.
Fuller told the gathering of the high emotions he ex
perienced as he stood within Carnegie's own library. He
recited one of the inscriptions placed around the library
walls, "These are mine own books, and this is mine own
library, more precious to me than any dukedom."
Fuller concluded. "The highest truth that humans per
ceive. they must fearlessly proclaim." R. Buckminster Ful
ler has done so.

"Pride does not want me to go on with a mistake," he
said. "Who are you kidding when you're wrong?" It is
only oneself.
"As soon as you let go of what's wrong," he observed, "a
curtain goes up and you can see what is."
He said that the project he had set for himself in 1927 of
reducing ideas to artifacts was "a 50 year task."
As that 50 year period now concludes, there has finally
been, he observed, "a very mysterious payoff."
Fuller stressed the need for personal responsibility.
"We can't delegate things to politicians," he stressed. And
yet he mused, "I know how little I know."
He ended his presentation by discussing an exhibit he
recently prepared for the Hewitt-Cooper Smithsonian
Museum of Design in New York City. These artifacts will
be housed in a mansion in the City that was once the home
of Andrew Carnegie.
Fuller told the gathering of the high emotions he ex
perienced as he stood within Carnegie's own library. He
recited one of the inscriptions placed around the library
walls, "These are mine own books, and this is mine own
library, more precious to me than any dukedom."
Fuller concluded. "The highest truth that humans per
ceive. they must fearlessly proclaim." R. Buckminster Ful
ler has done so.
R. Buckminster Fuller sat in a comfortable chair on a
low stage at the San Francisco Hyatt Regency, his grand
son Jaime Snyder by his side, to share his life and
philosophy Sunday with an audience of 250 members of
the New Dimensions Foundation.
He criticized as inadequate the analyses of Thomas
Malthus and Karl Marx which claimed there was not
enough on the planet to go around and that the working
class, as the more fit, was superior and more deserving of
survival.
Fuller said that history has entered the era of "world
man. where color has no meaning, as in Mexico, where
there is no (color) line and it all washes together." Man
kind ought to begin operating under "completely new
principles," said Fuller, that realistically take into ac
count the "real wealth" available to people.
Intuition
Fuller discussed in some detail the research of F.S.C.
Northrup at Yale after World War II in which the letters
written by famous scientists immediately before and after
their major discoveries were studied in an effort to detect
similarities.
"The number one factor in their success was their intui
tion," reported Fuller. But, he added, the second most
important factor in their achievements was "their second
intuition, which told them 'what you've got to do with
what you've discovered.'"
Fuller then emphasized the importance of this second
intuition — of the need to reduce theoretical insights to
common practice.
Speaking in general
He also discovered the |oy of "breaking through lan
guage barriers to generalizations" to facilitate communi
cation between persons, he said.
"It is possible to deal with specialists by being a

generalist," he said, reminiscing over the days in 1940
when he was the science and technology consultant for
Fortune Magazine.
He spent much of his time talking with engineering
vice-presidents of companies, and found that he could
converse with them because he was "familiar with
generalizations."
To live
And what of the proper conduct of one's life?

do, it's all new," he commented.
