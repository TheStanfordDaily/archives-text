# Watson team returns

### Kurt Cobb 
The cleanest fastest fiat
picking guitar playing anv
where. l ine "old-timey" banjo.
Ballads and folk songs from
America's rick folk heritage. It
all adds up to Doc Watson who
will be appearing with his son
Merle at Memorial Auditorium
on Saturday, Oct. :i0 for two
shows at 7 and 9 p.m.
Although this man's name
may not be a household word, he
is one of the finest performers in
tin; folk tradition around today.
Me has single-handedly brought
the flat-top guitar from its back
up role in bluegrass bands to the
stature of a lead instrument.
Doc's virtuosity on the guitar is
almost without a challenger.
And he seems to have invented a
style all his own dominated by
fiddle riffs translated to guitar,
.in instrument with almost twice
the string length! His dexterity
on the fingerboard is com
plemented by a warm, resonant
voice.
blind since his birth in
,md educated at the State School
for the Blind in Raleigh, North
(larolina. Doc Watson now
makes his home near Deep (lap.
N.C'. Although he comes from a
long line of singers and in
strumentalists, he did not begin
his professional career until he
was 2[). when he joined an elec
trified band that played rock 'n'
roll, country and western, and
old pop tunes. In the early 60s
Doc finally became recognized
.is .in authentic performer of "old

time music" and went on to play
in many important festivals in
cluding the Newport News Folk
Festival in 10(>4. He has also cut
13 albums including his newest
release Memories. Two albums,
Then and Now and Two Days in
November, won Grammies.
Traditional banjo method
Doc Watson's music has been
heavily influenced by such
people as Clarence Ashley and
Mississippi John Hurt. Doc, in
turn, has been given credit for
"influence and inspiration" by
Buffalo Springfield, a long since
disbanded group that included
Steve Stills, Neil Young, and
Richie Furay. Doc's repertoire is
something like a dictionary of
American folk music for it in
cludes traditional folk, blueg
rass, gospel, and some country.
In addition to his fine flat
picking, he also plays banjo
using the "trailing" or "claw
hammer" technique, the tradi
tional method for playing the
melodies of the mountains. Add
a harmonica and the collection
seems complete. But still one
thing has been left out â€” the
man himself. Doc Watson is not
just a fine technician. His expla
nations about his songs and his
subtle wit make him a first-rate
performer as well.

Merle Watson must not be
overlooked, though. He is fast
approaching his father in his in
strumental skill. He plays fine
slide and finger-picking styles
on guitarand isalsoanexcellent
banjoist.
Joys and sorrows
It may seem strange, but Doc
and Merle have a healthy follow
ing among the younger ranks
and interest in their music seems
to be increasing. This doesn't
surprise the Watsons however,
for according to Doc, traditional
American music sets "an intense
mood, depicts the land and
mountains, and expresses the
joys and sorrows of plain folks."
Guitarist John Fahey will also
be appearing. He has already
produced several albums of
finger-picking guitarand should
add some more top-notch guitar
work to the show.

ford students only) are available
for $4 at theTresidder Ticket Of

for Stanford students will be
$4.50. Regular advance tickets
