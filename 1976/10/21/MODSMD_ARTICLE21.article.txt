# San Francisco:
## Symphony season highlights 
### Michele Hannoosh 
8:20 p.m. The bus pulls up
with a lurch, and you scramble
to get off betore anyone
else . . . You can't be late, or
you'll have to wait out the first
movement . . . Suddenly you're
in the midst ot a crowd where
minks and T-shirts, Givenchys
and Levis are side by side . . .
Then it hits: that creaking,
grating noise, faint at first, then
sharper . . . And as you reach
your seat, you wince, wondering
how that cacophony can ever
possibly be resolved into music.
Hut somehow it always is â€” after
all. it's not called symphony for
nothing.
The schedule tor the San
Francisco Symphony Orchest
ra's 1976-1977 season has been
released, and all true symphony
fans are anticipating the ope ni ng
of their favorite mode of enter
tainment. This year's program
shows definite potential: a var
ied repertoire and masters such
as Entrvmont and Watts are
promising indications of an en
joyable series of fine perfor
mances. And. of course, there is
always Ozawa.
Ozawa conducts
Anyone who has ever seen this
man conduct cannot help but be
caught up in the enthusiasm he
radiates. The city of Boston wor
ships him and has been so smit
ten ever since he assumed the
post of chief conductor of the
symphony orchestra there four
years ago.
Ozawa has had vast exposure
in the music world, due to
numerous posts he has held, in
cluding former director of the
Toronto symphony, adviser to
the Japan Philharmonic, guest
conductor with most of the im
portant orchestras, and co
director of the Boston Sym
phony Orchestra's Berkshire
Summer Music Festival at
Tangle wood. Advisor to the San
Francisco Symphony since
1970, he will be taking charge at
several of the orchestra's per
formances this season.
This year, the repertoire of
composers is particularly strong
in Mahler, Beethoven, Mozart,
and Bartok, and there is a fairly
good showing of Haydn. This
writer finds the scarcity of

Brahms a bit disappointing, as
such a prolific and diverse com
poser deserves more representa
tion than one symphony and one
concerto provide. The absence of
a few others, for example Ravel
and Saint-Saens. leaves a gap in
the selection of music, but the
program nevertheless reflects a
broad range of tastes and
periods.
Recommended concerts
Certain performances will be
devoted exclusively to a single
composer, among which we find
Mahler, Beethoven. Stravinsky.
Verdi, Bartok. Strauss, and
Wagner. This writer recom
mends a few concerts which ap
pear especially hopeful: on Feb
ruary 9, 11, and 12, Sarah
Caldwell, founder and director
of the Opera Company of Boston,
will appear as guest conductor
in a choice program featuring
two works by Debussy (Prin
ternps and Truis Nocturnes) and
one by Poulenc (La Voix
humaine). Caldwell has been
applauded throughout the world
for her exceptional work with
the Boston opera, and it will be
interesting to see her in concert
with the San Francisco Sym
phony Chorus, which will join
the orchestra in this perfor
mance.
Pianist Andre Watts
Another good program will be
played January 5, 0, 7, and 8 and
will offer the chance to see not
only Ozawa but also pianist
Andre Watts in a performance of
Pendericki, Franck, Liszt and
Schumann. There are twenty
tour concerts. Choose according
to your own musical prefer
ences.
In addition, the orchestra is of
fering a series of concerts at De
Anza College in Cupertino.
There are ten in this group, in
cluding the above-mentioned
one featuring Watts (January 8)
and an all-Stravinsky one with
guest violinist Itzhak Perl man.
All ot these concerts, except
one. take place on Saturday
evenings at 8:30 and are readily
accessible by car: 280 south and
get off at the Stevens Creek
Boulevard exit. De Anza College
is immediately off of that exit,
and the performances will take
place at the Flint ("enter for the

Performing Arts there. Unfortu
nately for those who don't have a
car at their disposal, bus no. 23
makes the trip from the Stanford
Shopping Center to De Anza but
does not return on Saturday
evenings.
Although there are no student
discounts per se for this series,
tickets are nevertheless slightly
cheaper than those for the opera
house concerts and r.inge from
$5 to $9.75. The p: \imity of
Stanford to De Anza makes this a
particularly convenient and
worthwhile venture.
Tips for concert-goers
If you really favor an evening
in San Francisco, though, you
can get there via the Southern
Pacific for $2.05 (one way).
Upon arrival at the San Fran
cisco depot, you can take Muni
Bus no. 30-Stockton to Market
Street, wtiere you will have to
transfer to n0.5-McCallister. The
bus costs 25 cents (including
transfer ticket) and will take you
to the War Memorial Opera
House, where the concerts are
given. Tickets to these sell from
$5.25 for center balcony to
$12.50 for a single box seat.
Actually, there is no reason
why students should purchase
expensive seats, since, as far as
acoustics are concerned, sound
can be appreciated best in the
second balcony.
As a tip for those who are un
familiar with the auditorium, it
is wise to avoid anything back of
row W on the first floor, as these
seats are located under the over
hang of the first balcony, which
has an unpleasant effect on the
sound. And a final reminder to
all holders of student discount
tickets: you must present your ID
when you enter, so be certain to
have it with you. If you do not,
your ticket will be declared in
valid, and you will be obliged to
pay the difference in price bet
ween the student ticket and a

regular one.
Despite the fact th.it single
concert tickets are not sold at a
discount to students, there are
several ways of obtaining tickets
at a reduced price. You can
purchase a student season ticket
($24-$5O) if you have Wednes
day evenings free and plan to go
to all eight concerts. A group of
people can easily beat this, how
ever. by pooling their resources,
buying one season pass together,
and deciding among themselves
who will go to a given concert.
Dormitories and fraternities
often subscribe for the season
and then sell the individual tic
kets within the house, so it
would be worthwhile to inquire
wherever you live to find out if
this is the case. The final date to
order student season tickets is
Friday. October 25). and this can
be done at the Tresidder ticket
office.
One way to get single concert
tickets at a cheaper rate or. for
that matter, to resell tickets that
you cannot use for some reason,
is to take advantage of the c.lear
ing house in the Row Office
(Grove House). Diane Brinker is
in charge of a system there
whereby ticket holders deposit
t hier tickets with her and name a
price. She maintains a waiting
list of persons interested in a par
ticular concert and wiil tele
phone them if a place comes up.
The waiting lists are often long,
however, and. since it is or. ,i
first-come, first-served basis, us
wise to put in an early bid., n*t
erably sometime in November.
Theoffice isat 584 Mayfielrl. and
her number is 497-4207 or 4'i7-
2971.
Individual concert tickets can
always be bought at the regular
price through the Tresidder of
fice, where you will be sold a
voucher which you will have to
exchange for a ticket upon your
arrival at the performance.
