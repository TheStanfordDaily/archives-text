# TWICE AROUND THE ARTS
## 
### Jeffrey Kimball 
The creative energy at this university is dying.
Faced with a wealth of opportunities to explore
the artistic and the intellectual, most students
tend to ignore the challenge and dwell upon the
mundane. Stanford will remain a forum for crea
tive thought and exchange of ideas only if it
doesn't become a glorified vocational school —
though not teaching the skills of auto mechanics
or TV repair, then teaching the skills of medicine
and engineering. And where, amongst all this is
the intellectual development?
It may begin in the classroom, but it doesn't stop
there. A liberal arts education means more than
simply the pursuit of a career. Its concern is with
the expansion of self beyond the limits of courses
and degrees and football games. The oppor
tunities exist right now, they need only be recog
nized. The current trend of intellectual regression
may, in part, be due to a lack of communication.
This column, henceforth to appear Thursdays in
the Daily, will be a reference guide to what's hap
pening on campus, both artistically and socially.
Hopefully, it will further contribute to the con
tinuation of this university as an institution of
progressing, as well as technological, thought.
THURSDAY, OCT. 21: The Coffee House is
quickly becoming a major Stanford arena for the
performing arts. Today and tomorrow they will

All announcements of artistic and social events
(yes, even parties) should be sent two weeks in

Daily.
The creative energy at this university is dying.
Faced with a wealth of opportunities to explore
the artistic and the intellectual, most students
tend to ignore the challenge and dwell upon the
mundane. Stanford will remain a forum for crea
tive thought and exchange of ideas only if it
doesn't become a glorified vocational school —
though not teaching the skills of auto mechanics
or TV repair, then teaching the skills of medicine
and engineering. And where, amongst all this is
the intellectual development?
It may begin in the classroom, but it doesn't stop
there. A liberal arts education means more than
simply the pursuit of a career. Its concern is with
the expansion of self beyond the limits of courses
and degrees and football games. The oppor
tunities exist right now, they need only be recog
nized. The current trend of intellectual regression
may, in part, be due to a lack of communication.
This column, henceforth to appear Thursdays in
the Daily, will be a reference guide to what's hap
pening on campus, both artistically and socially.
Hopefully, it will further contribute to the con
tinuation of this university as an institution of
progressing, as well as technological, thought.

All announcements of artistic and social events
(yes, even parties) should be sent two weeks in

Daily.
The creative energy at this university is dying.
Faced with a wealth of opportunities to explore
the artistic and the intellectual, most students
tend to ignore the challenge and dwell upon the
mundane. Stanford will remain a forum for crea
tive thought and exchange of ideas only if it
doesn't become a glorified vocational school —
though not teaching the skills of auto mechanics
or TV repair, then teaching the skills of medicine
and engineering. And where, amongst all this is
the intellectual development?
It may begin in the classroom, but it doesn't stop
there. A liberal arts education means more than
simply the pursuit of a career. Its concern is with
the expansion of self beyond the limits of courses
and degrees and football games. The oppor
tunities exist right now, they need only be recog
nized. The current trend of intellectual regression
may, in part, be due to a lack of communication.
This column, henceforth to appear Thursdays in
the Daily, will be a reference guide to what's hap
pening on campus, both artistically and socially.
Hopefully, it will further contribute to the con
tinuation of this university as an institution of
progressing, as well as technological, thought.
