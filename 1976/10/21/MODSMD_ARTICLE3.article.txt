# Mondale rips GOP budget
## 
### Bill Snyder 
San Jose â€” Sen. Walter Mondale,
Democratic vice presidential candi
date, last night blamed the Ford ad
ministration for the four per cent de
cline in the nation's economic growth.
"Every day new statistics point to
the failure of this administration," he
said.
The Minnesota senator spoke to
about 1000 persons at a rally in front of
San Jose city hall. Mondale shared the
platform with the two congressmen
from South Santa Clara County, Don
Edwards and Norm Mineta, and David
Harris, congressional candidate from
the 12th District.
Earlier at a press conference at the
San Jose airport, Mondale admitted
that California is crucial to the Carter
campaign. "If we carry California, we
win," he said. "If we lose California,
we lose."
He did not elaborate on Carter's
chances for a win in California, but
said, "We're picking up here very im
pressively. I'm convinced we're gain
ing here every day."
GOP shortcomings
According to Mondale, unemploy
ment has tripled in the last eight years
of Republican administration and has
increased 15 per cent since Ford took
office. Over six per cent of American
workers are unemployed, "the highest
unemployment since the Great Depres
sion," he said.
"(The administration) does not
know how to put America back to
work," he added.
Mondale accused the administra
tion of not doing "a single thing to
fight inflation," which he said has tri
pled in eight years. "The average
American knows that inflation is tor
turing for families in this country," he
said.
Mondale stressed the need to roll
back the interest rate, and to induce
competition in industry, "to get those
prices down." Presently, he said, for
every one per cent in interest added to
the purchase of a home, 13 per cent is
added to the price of the home.
Neglecting citizens
He criticized the administration for
neglecting the youth, the ill and the
aged in this country. "In every one of
those areas, we've slipped backwards
for eight years," he said.

Mondale was interrupted during the
speech by about 15 members of the
Unemployed Workers Organization
Committee who chanted, "Ford and
Carter both the same, we won't play
your election game."
But the crowd was dominated by
Carter supporters. Signs held by mem
bers of the crowd pledged the support
of the "Local 19 Union" and the Un
ited Farm Workers. Mondale pointed
out the Stanford presence at the rally
by a sign which read, "Stanford lusts
for Carter." Another sign read, "Fritz is
a mellow cat."
The rally in San |ose captured the
style and some of the substance of the
classic stump speech. Mondale arrived
at the San Jose airport at 4:40 p.m. and
by 6 p.m. he was on his way to another
function last night in Portland, Ore.
