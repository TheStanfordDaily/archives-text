# Frederick outlines Lebanese schism

Howard Frederick, speaking on the
situation in Lebanon at Bechtel Inter
national Center yesterday, said that he
believed that class conflict and con
tradictory perceptions on the part of
Lebanese Christians and Moslems are
the major areas of struggle in Lebanon.
"Moslems and Christians have such
different conceptions of what the state
should be. It is not a religious war, not
a matter of differing faiths. It is a class
conflict over political and economical
issues," he said.
Frederick recently returned from
Beirut, where he worked with the
American Friends Service Commit
tee's Middle East Working Committee,
and spoke with representatives of
Lebanon's conflicting factions.
Frederick said, "The Lebanese
Christians feel that they are Arab by
accident. They have never appreciated
the Moslem desire for Pan-Arab unity.
"The Christians want to retain their
privileged status, and the Moslems
want to implement democratic reform
with a representative parliament," he
explained.
Many Christian Lebanese in the au
dience orally objected to Frederick's
contention that the Christian mental
ity is in part responsible for the con
flict.

Frederick explained that there are
really two separate conflicts — the
Lebanese left (which is predominantly
Moslem) against the right (which is
primarily Christian), and the problem
of Syria and Palestine.
Frederick described the destruction
caused by the fighting in Beirut, de
picted in the slides he showed.
"Fifty-thousand civilians have been
killed, and 100,000 wounded — 5 per
cent of the total Lebanese population.
"However, the greater destruction
has been in the society. There is frag
mentation, mutual fear, hatred, and
bitterness beneath the political
machinations," he said.
He noted that a new cease-fire has
recently been signed, and that al
though some fifty had previously
failed, he said he was optimistic about
its success. The agreement will give
Palestinians limited reign in southern
Lebanon, but it did not mention the
removal of Syrian troops, which now
number around 20,000 soldiers, he
said.
He implied that what may beof more
significance is that the cease-fire was
arranged within the context of a rap
prochement between Syria and
Egypt, which were represented by
their presidents Anwar Sadat and
Hafez Assad.
