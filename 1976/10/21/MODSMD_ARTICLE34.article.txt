Ferry rammed in Mississippi River
Luling, Ga. A 664-foot Norwegian tanker
rammed a Mississippi River ferry crowded with
nearly 100 persons yesterday, dumping vehicles
and screaming passengers into the swift muddy
current. Twenty persons were known dead and as
many as 58 were missing.
St. Charles Parish Sheriff, John St. Amant, said 20
bodies were recovered, most of them by divers.
Rescue work was complicated by muddy water up
to 80 feet deep and currents that scattered the cars
and pickup trucks thrown over the side by the colli
sion.
I he crash, one of the worst in river history, hap
pened at about 6:15 a.m. That's the ferry rush-hour
between Luling and Destrehan, located about 20
miles upriver from New Orleans.
Witnesses said the tanker Frosta, whistle shriek
ing, loomed up out of the chill early morning light
and rammed the George Prince amidships.
No one was positive exactly how many were on
the ferry.
Many were walk-on passengers, having left cars
parked near the levee to ride across the river to
plants or projects where they worked.
Capacity would be 35 cars and 140 passengers.
The terry, 120 feet long and 55 fefet wide, went
down about 150 yards off the west bank. Part of its
hull jutted above the muddy water.
Americans may sweep Nobel Prizes
Stockholm, Sweden — The winner of the 1976
Nobel Prize in literature will be named by the
Swedish Academy of Letters today with American
novelist Saul Bellow mentioned as a top contender.
A number of literary insiders with contacts in the
academy predicted Bellow, 61, would be the win
ner. It would give the United States an unpre
cedented sweep of all five Nobel Prizes this year.
Bellow, born in Canada of Russian Jewish parents
and reared in Chicago from the age of 9, has been
mentioned as a contender for the prize — this year
worth $160,000 — for several years. He was repor
tedly the close runner-up to Italian poet Eugenio
Montale last year.
Among his books are Humboldt's Gift, Herzog,
Mr. Sammler's Plunot and Henderson the Rain
King.
Other U.S. citizens probably in the running in
clude Norman Mailer, 51, and Russian-born Vla
dimir Nabokov, 77, who lives in Switzerland.
Strikes, arson and bombings in Italy
Rome — Strikes, arson and bombings plagued
Italy yesterday as leftist leaders met defiance in

trying to convince workers to swallow the austerity
program of the new Christian Democrat govern
ment, which rules with Communist support.
Some 70,000 workers marched through
downtown Milan in a violence-marred demonstra
tion of union rank and file discontent.
Croups of students roamed the city before and
during the march, attacking stores and businesses,
throwing firebombs and beating bystanders. At
least two persons were hospitalized with injuries,
but damage was limited mostly to broken windows.
Earlier yesterday, a powerful bomb blew up the
main door and shattered the windows of the Milan
headquarters of the conservative anti-Communist
group Communion and Liberation. Police specu
lated the attack was politically motivated.
Meanwhile, national union leaders and Com
munist politicians held separate meetings in Rome
to find ways to get their supporters to swallow the
austerity pill prescribed by the government, with
some even calling for stronger medicine than that
proposed by the ruling Christian Democrats.
The austerity measures are aimed at halting an
inflation rate of 19 per cent, cutting into a trade
deficit expected to reach $2.5 billion this year and
protect the faltering lire from further deterioration.

Ford defends Arab trade relations
Washington — President Gerald Ford said yes
terday that Jimmy Carter's claim he could end the
Arab boycott against Israel is naive and ridiculous
and declared that his Democratic challenger "does
waver, wander, wiggle and waffle" on campaign
issues.
At his afternoon news conference in the White
House Ford said he disagrees with darter's threat
to cut off exports to Arab nations in the event of an
oil embargo, particularly "food that American far
mers have produced and sell abroad in order to help
our economy here at home."
The president said he would not tolerate another
oil embargo but added that probabilities of another
one "are virtually nil because of the leadership of
this administration."
During the news conference and in off
microphone comments afterwards, the president
said he intends to keep Clarence kelley as director
of the FBI, despite the controversy over his views
on relations with the press, and Gen. George Brown
as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, despite his
comments on the burden of U.S. military support
for Israel.
The president added that he was disappointed at
a sag in the growth rate of the Gross National Pro
duct to four per cent in the last quarter.
Bolles case jury selection begins
Phoenix, Ariz. — The judge in the John Harvey
Adamson murder trial says he hopes to seat a jury
by tomorrow to hoar opening statements in the
bomb killing of newspaper reporter Don Bolles.
At the end of Tuesday's closed-door jury selec -
tion process 12 of 87 prospects had been excused
for hardship or prejudice.
Superior Court Judge Frederic Heineman. who
has barred press and public from the first phase of
the trial, said the prospective jurors are being quiz
zed carefully because of "the extreme publicity"
which surrounded the slaying of investigative re
porter Bolles.
"Without that," said the judge, "we'd have a jury
selected by now."
Adamson, a 32 year-old greyhound dog breeder,
is charged with the gangland-style bombing mur
der of the Arizona Republic newsman.
