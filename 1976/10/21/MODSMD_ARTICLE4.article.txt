### Arlene Kishi 
The fraternity cluster has $501VJ to
spend on student-initiated residential
educational programs this year, but
one fraternity house manager is find
ing it difficult to discover the
money's whereabouts.
According to Peter Sylvester of the
General Secretary's Office, the Hurd
Fund, established for the enrichment
of undergraduate education by alum
nus Joubert Hurd in 1967, has a princi
pal balance of $21,084 as of Sept. 30,
1976.
This principal is currently invested
primarily in stocks, bonds and in
terests in the Stanford Shopping
Center. The Board of Trustees annu
ally determines the amount of the in
come earned on these investments that
may be spent for programs as deter
mined by the Office of the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs.
Chuck Nelson, secretary and house
manager of Kappa Alpha Phi and
member of the Speaker's Bureau,
wants to use the funds to bring speak
ers to the fraternity cluster this year.
"The money hasn't been used as much
as it should have been. I think there's a
lot of funds like that around campus
that the students don't know about,"
he said.
Several weeks ago, when he was sit
ting in the Row Office, Nelson said
someone "let it slip" and ever since
then, he said he has been trying to find
out more about the money.
But people have been "evasive," he
said. "I think it's been fed back into the
university coffers, and that's not fair,"
said Nelson.
Karen Murray, director of the Row
and Fraternities and assistant dean of
Student Affairs, is in the hospital and
was unavailable for comment.
Norm Robinson, acting associate
dean of Student Affairs, said Nelson
has not talked to him about the fund.
In a 1973 memo from Larry Horton,
then associate dean for Residential
Education, an outline for obtaining
funds was revealed.
"Each specific program proposal
should be submitted in writing to the
Director of Fraternities or one of the
Cluster Residence Fellows, who will
evaluate and endorse the proposal be
fore sending it to this office."
