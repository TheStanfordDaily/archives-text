# 'Sex bias' found in library salaries

### Emily Sachar 
A two-year-old pending grievance
made by a part-time librarian here was
resolved Tuesday when she signed a
release document which will assure
her two years' back-pay.
Lise Giraud made the grievance to
the library administration claiming
that her lower salary levels were a re
sult of direct political discrimination
and sexism.
"I had salary statistics that showed
blatant discrimination. All our direc
tors were men," said Giraud. a level
three librarian whose grievance battle
began in September 1974.
Meanwhile, all other three and four
level women librarians will also re
ceive compensation for their work
over the last two years.
There are four salary ranks, level
four being the highest.
According to Assoc. Provost Ed
Shaw, the Provost's office also began a
study two years ago to investigate
whether sexual bias existed in the lib
rary systems.
Pay differences discovered
"We found only differences based
on sex for women in positions three
and four in the main library. We could
not explain it," Shaw said.
According to Shaw, any relation
ship bptween Giraud's grievance and
the study's operational date is coinci
dental.
"I was always getting paid at the bot
tom for my rank as a librarian. I was
better than what I was being paid for,"
Giraud said.
Giraud has been a librarian at the
university for 18 years, and is now
working in the main library-
Following complaints to her de
partment head, Giraud resorted to ar
bitration. President Richard Lyman
provided one arbitrator from a panel of
five to hear each case. Ghosen for
Giraud's case was Prof. Julius Getman,
a visiting professor of law.
Private records
"To substantiate sexist claims, we
requested a subpoena of libraries
salaries and rank distribution by sex,
and figures on length of tenure by sex.
The university refused and said it
would destroy privacy," Giraud said.
Getman then backed out one week
before the hearing, according to
Giraud, refusing to hear the case be

cause of a conflict of interest.
He would have been the one to issue
the subpoena to the library.
At one point, the union asked
Giraud to postpone her hearing date to
another time. The hearing was re
scheduled for February, 1976 at which
time the university's lawyers, Priscilla
Wheeler and Doug Barton, declared
the university's case was not yet pre
pared.
After she filed her grievance,
women were appointed to offices pre
viously held by men, said Giraud. The
head of Meyer library, one associate
director, a personnel officer, head of
reference and head of circulation posi
tions are now held by women, she said.
"1 think my grievance directly en
couraged this," Giraud said.
