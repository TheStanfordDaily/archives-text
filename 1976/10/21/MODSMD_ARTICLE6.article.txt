A proposal that would allow an ex
pert at the Palo Alto Fire Department
(PAFD) to handle disposal of bombs
here is being discussed, according to
Marvin Herrington, director of the
Stanford Department of Public Safety
(SDPS).
The SDPS proposal would arrange
to have Gapt. Jack Barr of the PAFD
handle bomb disposals on his off-duty
hours.
Herrington said the proposal to Barr
has been submitted to the Palo Alto
Fire Department "to see if they had any
objections. Last I hear, they (PAFD)
had no particular objections," he said.
Since the Stanford and Palo Alto fire
departments merged Oct. 1. there has
been no bomb de-activation or search
team in the area.
According to Barr, the closest bomb
disposal units are the San Jose police
bomb squad and military units from
the Presidio and Moffett Field which,
he said, "may or may not come, and
will only come if the device is found."
Barr, former assistant chief of the
Stanford Fire Department, has been a
firefighter for 26 years, 15 of them

here. He was an integral part of the
bomb squad here until its dissolution
in October.
"Jack Barr has a lot of experience I
just hated to lose," said Herrington.
According to Herrington, some
Stanford police officers are waiting to
enter a federal bomb disposal training
program. Together with Barr they may
form a new bomb squad.
Herrington said that Barr will "help
me bridge the gap in training my
people to take over those (bomb squad)
duties. The combination should work
fine for us."
"If it works out it'll be great, if it
doesn't we've already made plans to
train our own people." he added.
Herrington stressed that there is
"nothing formal as yet. Palo Alto (fire
department) has said nothing."
According to Robert Parker, man
ager of Personnel and Employee Rela
tions. negotiations regarding bomb
search duties as distinct from bomb
disposals will resume after Stanford
Police Officer's Assocation president
Herman Williams returns from vaca
tion later this month.
