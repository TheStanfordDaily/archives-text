# Chilean deaths show U.S. guilt

Three years ago last month the pres
idential palace in Chile lay under
seige, assaulted by the armed might of
a military junta staging a coup d'etat.
When the smoke finally cleared, Pres
ident Salvador Allende was dead, ancl
his democratic socialist government
would rule no more.
A reign of terror followed. Over 2000
Allende supporters were murdered
during the next month. Thousands of
others, imprisoned in a soccer stadium
and elsewhere, were tortured daily.
The death toll by now has probably
reached 30,000.
One more figure joined the list last
Sept. 21, when Orlando Letelier,
Allende's ambassador to the United
States, was assasinated in
Washington, D.C. by a bomb that blew
up his car. In the years since the coup,
Letelier had become one of the most
eloquent and outspoken foes of the
Chilean junta.
Just two weeks before his murder,
the tyrants in his home country had
deprived him of his Chilean citizen
ship. But that action, it seems, was not
enough; evidently the Chilean dic
tators decided that only Letelier's
death would completely silence him.
Reminder
The site of the assassination —
within blocks of the White House —
serves only to remind Americans of
our own government's complicity in
the junta's rise to power, and the irony
therein is shameful. Although it is not
an issue this election year, the Central
Intelligence Agency's (CIA) $8-
million effort to destabilize and ulti
mately destroy Allende's government
is a matter of record.
Acting on a general edict from
Richard Nixon and with authorization
by an intelligence group headed by
Henry Kissinger, the CIA funded op
position political parties and labor un
ions and helped plan two unsuccessful
coups by Chilean military personnel.
The responsibility for the murders of
Allende, 30,000 of his country people,
and now of Letelier is our govern
ment's to bear.
But responsibility for murder and
despotism in foreign lands is some
thing our government leaders will never
concede, and thus Letelier's assassina
t ion makes even more outrageous Pres
ident Lord's remarks two years ago at a
press conference.
Saddening, heinous
Responding then to reports of the
ClA's war against Chile. Lord's answer
will lung be remembered as one of the
most saddening and heinous sets of
words that any American president
has ever uttered.
Lord maintained th.it theClA's effort

"was in the best interest of the people
of Chile, and certainly in our best in
terest." The deaths and torture he did
not mention.
He continued, "Our government,
like other governments, does take cer
tain actions to help implement foreign
policy and protect national security.
I'm not going to pass judgment on
whether it's permitted or authorized
under international law. It's a recog
nized fact that, historically as well as
presently, that such actions are taken
in the best interest of the countries in
volved."
But now the Chilean terrorism has
reached our nation's capital, and the
bomb that blew up Orlando Letelier's
car and shook the windows of the
White House shows up Ford's words
for the gall and hypocrisy they repre
sent. Were Victor Jara alive today, he
would doubtless sing mightily about
the tragedy of it all.
Taken prisoner
Once Chile's foremost folksinger,
Jara was taken prisoner to the soccer
stadium after the coup and sub
sequently tortured and murdered, his
head mashed to a pulp by rifle butts,
his body riddled with bullets.
Jara managed nonetheless to write a
poem that was smuggled out of Chile
and that stands as a ringing indictment
of the junta and of the American gov
ernment that facilitated and now sus
tains its rise to power:
We are five thousand
Here in this little corner of the city.
Hoiv many are we -in all the cities of
the world?
All, all of as, our eyes fixed on death.
Hon terrifying is the face of fascism!
For them, blood is a medal
Carnage is a heroic gesture.
Song, I cannot sing you well when I
must sing out of fear.
When I am dying of fright
When I find myself in these endless
moments
Where silence and cries are the echoes
of my song.
