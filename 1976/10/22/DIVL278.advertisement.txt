Program for the Academic Year 1976-77
DEVICES FOR ENERGY
MANAGEMENT
This year E 235 will focus on some badly needed technology pertinent to
energy conservation —devices and systems that can be used to measure and
control the energy flows in existing facilities. The need for this became apparent in
last year's E 235 study of the energy system on the Stanford campus. In order to
deal with our rapidly rising energy costs, we must cut consumption, and to do this
intelligently we need much more data than presently can be obtained: steam and
chill-water demand of individual buildings; electrical demand and utilization in
individual buildings; building-use patterns, including potentials for energy
conserving building function changes. There is also a need for new devices that
sense the utilization of facilities and adjust the energy supply (e.g., lighting)
accordingly, thereby eliminating the need for continual human control.
The class will be organized in a series of small task groups, each assigned to
a particular problem. After a set of briefings, the group will explore a wide range of
technological approaches to the task, propose a recommended line of attack, and
design a prototype system. If time and funds permit, the prototype will be built
tested. There will be opportunity for a few students to continue on their project
over the summer, and there will be entrepreneuring possibilities as well. An
advisory panel of users of the technology, and other technical consultants, will
periodically review the project progress.
Participation will be limited to graduate students with a strong technical
specialty that car. be brought to bear on the problem. Admission will be selective,
based on interviews to be conducted during the week of November 15. We will
need engineers of all disciplines, and can use others with strong backgrounds in
applied sciences, including MBA students with engineering degrees and experi
ence. Interested students should sign the course application list in the ENERGY
INFORMATION CENTER just north of the Old Union.
E 235 is sponsored by the Institute for Energy Studies. The course coor
dinator is Professor W.C, Reynolds, Chairman of Mechanical Engineering and
the Institute for Energy Studies. Faculty willing to participate as advisors or
j section leaders please call Prof. Reynolds, 497-3148.

accordingly, thereby eliminating the need for continual human control.
The class will be organized in a series of small task groups, each assigned to
a particular problem. After a set of briefings, the group will explore a wide range of
technological approaches to the task, propose a recommended line of attack, and
design a prototype system. If time and funds permit, the prototype will be built
tested. There will be opportunity for a few students to continue on their project
over the summer, and there will be entrepreneuring possibilities as well. An
advisory panel of users of the technology, and other technical consultants, will
periodically review the project progress.
Participation will be limited to graduate students with a strong technical
specialty that car. be brought to bear on the problem. Admission will be selective,
based on interviews to be conducted during the week of November 15. We will
need engineers of all disciplines, and can use others with strong backgrounds in
applied sciences, including MBA students with engineering degrees and experi
ence. Interested students should sign the course application list in the ENERGY
INFORMATION CENTER just north of the Old Union.
E 235 is sponsored by the Institute for Energy Studies. The course coor
dinator is Professor W.C, Reynolds, Chairman of Mechanical Engineering and
the Institute for Energy Studies. Faculty willing to participate as advisors or
j section leaders please call Prof. Reynolds, 497-3148.
