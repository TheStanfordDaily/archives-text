# Chavez assails opponents of Proposition 14
## Foes charged with not reporting all contributions 
### 
United Farm Workers President Cesar Chavez
announced yesterday that his union is filing a com
plaint with the state Fair Campaign Practices
Commission charging that there have been 51 unre
ported campaign contributions by opponents of
Proposition 14.
Speaking before an overflow crowd of more than
500 people in Cubberley Auditorium, Chavez com
pared the $243,000 raised by supporters of the
proposition through 120,000 separate contribu
tions with the $984,000 raised by "fewer than
5000" contributions by its opponents for the filing
period ending Sept. 27.
Chavez claimed that 56 per cent of the oppo
nent's total came from four per cent of their con
tributors.
"There is only one issue surrounding Prop. 14:
giving workers the right to cast a secret ballot if
they want a union," said the labor organizer.
Chavez traced the origin of the initiative to the

demise earlier this year of the state Agricultural
Labor Relations Board, which "went out of busi
ness" when, according to Chavez, state legislators
sympathetic to the growers refused to provide
further funding for the board's operations unless
the legislature adopted certain amendments.
These amendments would have changed the
board in ways unacceptable to the union, Chavez
said.
When the board ceased operations because of a
lack of funds, said Chavez, the farm workers started
an initiative campaign, and were able to place the
measure on the ballot by collecting 729,000 signa
tures in 29 days.
After that campaign, the growers changed their
minds, he said, and the legislature refunded the
board again. However.grower-worker relationswill
remain at an impasse without Prop. 14, Chavez
predicted.
"There will be no amendments, no money, and
no elections," claimed Chavez.
No ads on ABC
Chavez announced at the beginning of his speech
that ABC in New York had told its California af
filiates not to run "No on 14"advertisements unless
they deleted references saying 14 would infringe
on property rights. He also said KPIX in San Fran
cisco (CBS affiliate) was refusing to run the grow
ers' ads, and growers had been picketing outside
the station.
Chavez said, "The growers have no issues.
They're not worried about access; they don't want
the workers to have the right to organize." He said
labor unions' right of access has long been estab
lished in federal law, going back to the National
Labor Relations Act of 1936.
Access procedures, which give organizers the
right to talk to workers for an hour before and after
work and one hour during lunch, were not too
useful, since "workers don't come an hour before
work any more than students come to class an hour
early," Chavez said.

He called grower statements about the proposi
tion "deceptive, fraudulent, and misleading." and
characterized their approach in general as "the big
lie."
"We are not arguing with their right to lie. We are
the first to defend their First Amendment rights to
lie to you," said Chavez. "They have the right to lie
to you. But let them tell you that they're lying to
you," he demanded.
Chavez argued that the large growers, by claim
ing that Prop. 14 would put small growers out of
business, are using the small growers as a front.
"This union has not put one small grower out of
business, but agribusiness is putting lots of small
growers out of business. We don't want to organize
the small growers," he said, because it is not practi
cal. "We want to organize the big corporarate
farms."
'Small growers'
He sarcastically listed the Southern Pacific Rail
road, the California Chamber of Commerce, the J.T.
Boswell company, and the Weyerhauser Paper
Company as some of the "small growers having
trouble making ends meet" as claimed by Prop. 14
opponents.
He said these parties have made major contribu
tions to the campaign to defeat the initiative.
He said the "No on 14" forces consisted of "big
growers, big money, and big lies."
Chavez said of the measure's chances of passage
that "it's in the balance. The real issue is not the
union; it's human beings."
The struggles of the farmworkers were particu
larly important, Chavez pointed out, because "un
like any other worker in the country, their work
product is everything you eat."
"They who provide the food go hungry," said
Chavez. "Your 'yes' vote helps us feed ourselves."
"If you vote 'no' we'll accept that," he concluded.
"If you vote 'yes,' we'll accept that, too, and love
you even more."

right to talk to workers for an hour before and after
work and one hour during lunch, were not too
useful, since "workers don't come an hour before
work any more than students come to class an hour
early," Chavez said.

He called grower statements about the proposi
tion "deceptive, fraudulent, and misleading." and
characterized their approach in general as "the big
lie."
"We are not arguing with their right to lie. We are
the first to defend their First Amendment rights to
lie to you," said Chavez. "They have the right to lie
to you. But let them tell you that they're lying to
you," he demanded.
Chavez argued that the large growers, by claim
ing that Prop. 14 would put small growers out of
business, are using the small growers as a front.
"This union has not put one small grower out of
business, but agribusiness is putting lots of small
growers out of business. We don't want to organize
the small growers," he said, because it is not practi
cal. "We want to organize the big corporarate
farms."
'Small growers'
He sarcastically listed the Southern Pacific Rail
road, the California Chamber of Commerce, the J.T.
Boswell company, and the Weyerhauser Paper
Company as some of the "small growers having
trouble making ends meet" as claimed by Prop. 14
opponents.
He said these parties have made major contribu
tions to the campaign to defeat the initiative.
He said the "No on 14" forces consisted of "big
growers, big money, and big lies."
Chavez said of the measure's chances of passage
that "it's in the balance. The real issue is not the
union; it's human beings."
The struggles of the farmworkers were particu
larly important, Chavez pointed out, because "un
like any other worker in the country, their work
product is everything you eat."
"They who provide the food go hungry," said
Chavez. "Your 'yes' vote helps us feed ourselves."
"If you vote 'no' we'll accept that," he concluded.
"If you vote 'yes,' we'll accept that, too, and love
you even more."

Cesar Chavez, president of the United Farm Workers, addressed an
overflowing crowd at Cubberley Auditorium yesterday. Chavez talked
about the current problems in getting Proposition 14 passed and its
history.
United Farm Workers President Cesar Chavez
announced yesterday that his union is filing a com
plaint with the state Fair Campaign Practices
Commission charging that there have been 51 unre
ported campaign contributions by opponents of
Proposition 14.
Speaking before an overflow crowd of more than
500 people in Cubberley Auditorium, Chavez com
pared the $243,000 raised by supporters of the
proposition through 120,000 separate contribu
tions with the $984,000 raised by "fewer than
5000" contributions by its opponents for the filing
period ending Sept. 27.
Chavez claimed that 56 per cent of the oppo
nent's total came from four per cent of their con
tributors.
"There is only one issue surrounding Prop. 14:
giving workers the right to cast a secret ballot if
they want a union," said the labor organizer.
Chavez traced the origin of the initiative to the

demise earlier this year of the state Agricultural
Labor Relations Board, which "went out of busi
ness" when, according to Chavez, state legislators
sympathetic to the growers refused to provide
further funding for the board's operations unless
the legislature adopted certain amendments.
These amendments would have changed the
board in ways unacceptable to the union, Chavez
said.
When the board ceased operations because of a
lack of funds, said Chavez, the farm workers started
an initiative campaign, and were able to place the
measure on the ballot by collecting 729,000 signa
tures in 29 days.
After that campaign, the growers changed their
minds, he said, and the legislature refunded the
board again. However.grower-worker relationswill
remain at an impasse without Prop. 14, Chavez
predicted.
"There will be no amendments, no money, and
no elections," claimed Chavez.
No ads on ABC
Chavez announced at the beginning of his speech
that ABC in New York had told its California af
filiates not to run "No on 14"advertisements unless
they deleted references saying 14 would infringe
on property rights. He also said KPIX in San Fran
cisco (CBS affiliate) was refusing to run the grow
ers' ads, and growers had been picketing outside
the station.
Chavez said, "The growers have no issues.
They're not worried about access; they don't want
the workers to have the right to organize." He said
labor unions' right of access has long been estab
lished in federal law, going back to the National
Labor Relations Act of 1936.
Access procedures, which give organizers the
right to talk to workers for an hour before and after
work and one hour during lunch, were not too
useful, since "workers don't come an hour before

Speaking before an overflow crowd of more than
500 people in Cubberley Auditorium, Chavez com
pared the $243,000 raised by supporters of the
proposition through 120,000 separate contribu
tions with the $984,000 raised by "fewer than
5000" contributions by its opponents for the filing
period ending Sept. 27.
Chavez claimed that 56 per cent of the oppo
nent's total came from four per cent of their con
tributors.
"There is only one issue surrounding Prop. 14:
giving workers the right to cast a secret ballot if
they want a union," said the labor organizer.
Chavez traced the origin of the initiative to the

demise earlier this year of the state Agricultural
Labor Relations Board, which "went out of busi
ness" when, according to Chavez, state legislators
sympathetic to the growers refused to provide
further funding for the board's operations unless
the legislature adopted certain amendments.
These amendments would have changed the
board in ways unacceptable to the union, Chavez
said.
When the board ceased operations because of a
lack of funds, said Chavez, the farm workers started
an initiative campaign, and were able to place the
measure on the ballot by collecting 729,000 signa
tures in 29 days.
After that campaign, the growers changed their
minds, he said, and the legislature refunded the
board again. However.grower-worker relationswill
remain at an impasse without Prop. 14, Chavez
predicted.
"There will be no amendments, no money, and
no elections," claimed Chavez.
No ads on ABC
Chavez announced at the beginning of his speech
that ABC in New York had told its California af
filiates not to run "No on 14"advertisements unless
they deleted references saying 14 would infringe
on property rights. He also said KPIX in San Fran
cisco (CBS affiliate) was refusing to run the grow
ers' ads, and growers had been picketing outside
the station.
Chavez said, "The growers have no issues.
They're not worried about access; they don't want
the workers to have the right to organize." He said
labor unions' right of access has long been estab
lished in federal law, going back to the National
Labor Relations Act of 1936.
Access procedures, which give organizers the
right to talk to workers for an hour before and after
work and one hour during lunch, were not too
useful, since "workers don't come an hour before
work any more than students come to class an hour
early," Chavez said.

He called grower statements about the proposi
tion "deceptive, fraudulent, and misleading." and
characterized their approach in general as "the big
lie."
"We are not arguing with their right to lie. We are
the first to defend their First Amendment rights to
lie to you," said Chavez. "They have the right to lie
to you. But let them tell you that they're lying to
you," he demanded.
Chavez argued that the large growers, by claim
ing that Prop. 14 would put small growers out of
business, are using the small growers as a front.
"This union has not put one small grower out of
business, but agribusiness is putting lots of small
growers out of business. We don't want to organize
the small growers," he said, because it is not practi
cal. "We want to organize the big corporarate
farms."
'Small growers'
He sarcastically listed the Southern Pacific Rail
road, the California Chamber of Commerce, the J.T.
Boswell company, and the Weyerhauser Paper
Company as some of the "small growers having
trouble making ends meet" as claimed by Prop. 14
opponents.
He said these parties have made major contribu
tions to the campaign to defeat the initiative.
He said the "No on 14" forces consisted of "big
growers, big money, and big lies."
Chavez said of the measure's chances of passage
that "it's in the balance. The real issue is not the
union; it's human beings."
The struggles of the farmworkers were particu
larly important, Chavez pointed out, because "un
like any other worker in the country, their work
product is everything you eat."
"They who provide the food go hungry," said
Chavez. "Your 'yes' vote helps us feed ourselves."
"If you vote 'no' we'll accept that," he concluded.
"If you vote 'yes,' we'll accept that, too, and love
you even more."
