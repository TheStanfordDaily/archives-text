# Carter candidacy reveals sectionalism
## 
### 
In Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream,
Doris Kearns quotes L.8.J., "The burden of national
unity rests heaviest on one man, the President. And
I did not believe, any more than I ever had, that the
nation would unite indefinitely behind any South
erner . . . My experience in office had confirmed
this reaction.
"I was not thinking just of the derisive articles
about my style, my clothes, my manner, my accent,
and my family. I was thinking of a more deep
seated and far-reaching attitude — a disdain for the
South that seems to be woven into the fabric of
national experience ... an automatic reflex, un
conscious or deliberate ..."
In 1976 the South has produced another national
leader and possibly the 39th president of the United
States in the person of Jimmy Carter. Already, even
to a greater extent than did Johnson, Carter has
come under intense and hostile scrutiny from those
who do not understand the forces which shape a
man who grew up in Plains, Ga.
Subtle prejudice
Perhaps the greatest intangible manifested in this
year's presidential race is the subtle prejudice the
Democratic party nominee has faced while cam
paigning in the northern and western regions of
this country. Carter ran third in New York and
fourth in Massachusetts, while failing to win a
single primary in the western states.
Of course, a multiplicity of factors determined
the outcome of each primary. However, judging
from the national media, Carter's accent, manner
and religious beliefs seem to compose a predomin
ant part of his image, even eclipsing his stands on
the issues.
And though the peanut farmer's character maybe
a product of personal and family influences, which
have little to do with his birthplace, the fact that he
comes from the South, in itself, has become a major
issue.
Therefore, in order to come to any understanding
of who Carter is, one must understand the South.
Final re-emergence
A few years ago much was being said about the
final re-emergence into national life of the states
below the Mason-Dixon line. This region was
termed "The New South."
After a century of post-Civil War inequality, it
was perceived that the people of Atlanta, Birming
ham and New Orleans had at last cuaght up to the
rest of the nation in terms of both outlook and

lifestyle.
The facts seem to confirm this analysis. During
Carter's term of office as governor, employment in
Georgia increased by 24 per cent. Compared to the
industrial Northeast, the South, like its sister sun
belt regions, was attracting more new investment,
new companies, and people.
This economic maturity appeared to coincide
with a fresh political impulse: a firm commitment
toward racial equality. Willie Morris, former editor
of the Texas Observer, writes, "Most Northerners
still view the South as a segregated society, ignor-

. WW & m&mmm mmfmmsm ' mm.
ing the fact that a combination of the Federal pre
sence and its own best instincts have transformed it
in the last fifteen years into the most racially integ
rated region in America."
More black representatives
While they stoned school buses in Boston, the
South enjoyed the leadership of more black rep
resentatives than at any time in its history. The
demise of George Wallace is symbolic of a new era
in southern race relations. Maybe the wheelchair
cost him a significant number of votes, but his de
feat never would have come about were it not for
the presence of a strong challenger.
If Jimmy Carter is remembered for notliing else,
his 34 to 31 per cent victory in the Florida primary
over Wallace is of historic importance.
Since that time last spring, Carter has been
catapulated into national prominence. And as the
microphones recorded his soft accent responding
to questions about his Baptist faith, many people
felt an uneasiness concerning this new political
figure.
How much does the manner of speech and
philosophical outlook affect voters? I can only
answer from personal experience, one which fo
cuses not on Jimmy Carter, but his wife Rosalyn.
Sorely mistaken
A few weeks ago, the candidate's wife visited a
congressional campaign headquarters in Los

Angeles in which I worked. I expected her to give a
stock speech with the usual rhetoric, but was sorely
mistaken. The lilting tones of her voice were pleas
ingly disarming as she casually spoke of the times
when she and her husband were happily surprised
if 20 people came to hear him speak.
It suddenly hit me how amazing Carter's rise to
prominence has been. And despite my cynicism, 1
found myself willing to accept the phrase, "trust
me," and the talk of a government of love that
surrounded it. I was experiencing the positive side
of the Carter southern inflection.
Yet, judging the response to Carter's recent re
marks in Playboy magazine, 1 think my views must
be in the minority. Aside from the few sensational
references to his opinions on sexual sin, the
Playboy interview deals primarily with Carter's
politics, ethics, friends and family. Statements
such as "My wife and 1 were born and raised in
innocent times. The normal thing to do was to goto
church" seem almost puritanical in today's society.
Typical environment
Still, one should keep in mind that Carter's re
ligious beliefs are derived from what was a typical
environment in the rural South. Like John Kennedy
before him, he does not believe his religious per
suasion renders him incapable of making fair deci
sions in secular matters. The qualifications of a
president are not a matter of style and background
as media campaigns lead us to believe.
It would be a shame, therefore, were the Democ
ratic nominee to be rejected on the basis of his
upbringing.
Sadly, such a prejudice does exist. As Carter
lamented in Playboy, "There's still a tendency on
the part of some members of the press to treat the
South, you know, as a suspect nation. There are a
few who think that since 1 am a Southern governor,
I must be a secret racist or there's something in a
closet somewhere that's going to be revealed to
show my true colors. There's been a constant prob
ing back 10, 12 years in my background, even as
early as the first primaries."
Americans must try to understand what they per
ceive as different. If not, we may wind up with a
President Carter who feels the same alienation
Johnson did. and only because he was born a few
more degrees latitude closer to the equator than
most of us.

erner . . . My experience in office had confirmed
this reaction.
"I was not thinking just of the derisive articles
about my style, my clothes, my manner, my accent,
and my family. I was thinking of a more deep

In 1976 the South has produced another national
leader and possibly the 39th president of the United
States in the person of Jimmy Carter. Already, even
to a greater extent than did Johnson, Carter has
come under intense and hostile scrutiny from those
who do not understand the forces which shape a
man who grew up in Plains, Ga.
Subtle prejudice
Perhaps the greatest intangible manifested in this
year's presidential race is the subtle prejudice the
Democratic party nominee has faced while cam
paigning in the northern and western regions of
this country. Carter ran third in New York and
fourth in Massachusetts, while failing to win a
single primary in the western states.
Of course, a multiplicity of factors determined
the outcome of each primary. However, judging
from the national media, Carter's accent, manner
and religious beliefs seem to compose a predomin
ant part of his image, even eclipsing his stands on
the issues.
And though the peanut farmer's character maybe
a product of personal and family influences, which
have little to do with his birthplace, the fact that he
comes from the South, in itself, has become a major
issue.
Therefore, in order to come to any understanding
of who Carter is, one must understand the South.
Final re-emergence
A few years ago much was being said about the
final re-emergence into national life of the states
below the Mason-Dixon line. This region was
termed "The New South."
After a century of post-Civil War inequality, it
was perceived that the people of Atlanta, Birming
ham and New Orleans had at last cuaght up to the
rest of the nation in terms of both outlook and

lifestyle.
The facts seem to confirm this analysis. During
Carter's term of office as governor, employment in
Georgia increased by 24 per cent. Compared to the
industrial Northeast, the South, like its sister sun
belt regions, was attracting more new investment,
new companies, and people.
This economic maturity appeared to coincide
with a fresh political impulse: a firm commitment
toward racial equality. Willie Morris, former editor
of the Texas Observer, writes, "Most Northerners
still view the South as a segregated society, ignor-

. WW & m&mmm mmfmmsm ' mm.
ing the fact that a combination of the Federal pre
sence and its own best instincts have transformed it
in the last fifteen years into the most racially integ
rated region in America."
More black representatives
While they stoned school buses in Boston, the
South enjoyed the leadership of more black rep
resentatives than at any time in its history. The
demise of George Wallace is symbolic of a new era
in southern race relations. Maybe the wheelchair
cost him a significant number of votes, but his de
feat never would have come about were it not for
the presence of a strong challenger.
If Jimmy Carter is remembered for notliing else,
his 34 to 31 per cent victory in the Florida primary
over Wallace is of historic importance.
Since that time last spring, Carter has been
catapulated into national prominence. And as the
microphones recorded his soft accent responding
to questions about his Baptist faith, many people
felt an uneasiness concerning this new political
figure.
How much does the manner of speech and
philosophical outlook affect voters? I can only
answer from personal experience, one which fo
cuses not on Jimmy Carter, but his wife Rosalyn.
Sorely mistaken
A few weeks ago, the candidate's wife visited a
congressional campaign headquarters in Los

Angeles in which I worked. I expected her to give a
stock speech with the usual rhetoric, but was sorely
mistaken. The lilting tones of her voice were pleas
ingly disarming as she casually spoke of the times
when she and her husband were happily surprised
if 20 people came to hear him speak.
It suddenly hit me how amazing Carter's rise to
prominence has been. And despite my cynicism, 1
found myself willing to accept the phrase, "trust
me," and the talk of a government of love that
surrounded it. I was experiencing the positive side
of the Carter southern inflection.
Yet, judging the response to Carter's recent re
marks in Playboy magazine, 1 think my views must
be in the minority. Aside from the few sensational
references to his opinions on sexual sin, the
Playboy interview deals primarily with Carter's
politics, ethics, friends and family. Statements
such as "My wife and 1 were born and raised in
innocent times. The normal thing to do was to goto
church" seem almost puritanical in today's society.
Typical environment
Still, one should keep in mind that Carter's re
ligious beliefs are derived from what was a typical
environment in the rural South. Like John Kennedy
before him, he does not believe his religious per
suasion renders him incapable of making fair deci
sions in secular matters. The qualifications of a
president are not a matter of style and background
as media campaigns lead us to believe.
It would be a shame, therefore, were the Democ
ratic nominee to be rejected on the basis of his
upbringing.
Sadly, such a prejudice does exist. As Carter
lamented in Playboy, "There's still a tendency on
the part of some members of the press to treat the
South, you know, as a suspect nation. There are a
few who think that since 1 am a Southern governor,
I must be a secret racist or there's something in a
closet somewhere that's going to be revealed to
show my true colors. There's been a constant prob
ing back 10, 12 years in my background, even as
early as the first primaries."
Americans must try to understand what they per
ceive as different. If not, we may wind up with a
President Carter who feels the same alienation
Johnson did. and only because he was born a few
more degrees latitude closer to the equator than
most of us.

and my family. I was thinking of a more deep

In 1976 the South has produced another national
leader and possibly the 39th president of the United
States in the person of Jimmy Carter. Already, even
to a greater extent than did Johnson, Carter has
come under intense and hostile scrutiny from those
who do not understand the forces which shape a
man who grew up in Plains, Ga.
Subtle prejudice
Perhaps the greatest intangible manifested in this
year's presidential race is the subtle prejudice the
Democratic party nominee has faced while cam
paigning in the northern and western regions of
this country. Carter ran third in New York and
fourth in Massachusetts, while failing to win a
single primary in the western states.
Of course, a multiplicity of factors determined
the outcome of each primary. However, judging
from the national media, Carter's accent, manner
and religious beliefs seem to compose a predomin
ant part of his image, even eclipsing his stands on
the issues.
And though the peanut farmer's character maybe
a product of personal and family influences, which
have little to do with his birthplace, the fact that he
comes from the South, in itself, has become a major
issue.
Therefore, in order to come to any understanding
of who Carter is, one must understand the South.
Final re-emergence
A few years ago much was being said about the
final re-emergence into national life of the states
below the Mason-Dixon line. This region was
termed "The New South."
After a century of post-Civil War inequality, it
was perceived that the people of Atlanta, Birming
ham and New Orleans had at last cuaght up to the
rest of the nation in terms of both outlook and

lifestyle.
The facts seem to confirm this analysis. During
Carter's term of office as governor, employment in
Georgia increased by 24 per cent. Compared to the
industrial Northeast, the South, like its sister sun
belt regions, was attracting more new investment,
new companies, and people.
This economic maturity appeared to coincide
with a fresh political impulse: a firm commitment
toward racial equality. Willie Morris, former editor
of the Texas Observer, writes, "Most Northerners
still view the South as a segregated society, ignor-

. WW & m&mmm mmfmmsm ' mm.
ing the fact that a combination of the Federal pre
sence and its own best instincts have transformed it
in the last fifteen years into the most racially integ
rated region in America."
More black representatives
While they stoned school buses in Boston, the
South enjoyed the leadership of more black rep
resentatives than at any time in its history. The
demise of George Wallace is symbolic of a new era
in southern race relations. Maybe the wheelchair
cost him a significant number of votes, but his de
feat never would have come about were it not for
the presence of a strong challenger.
If Jimmy Carter is remembered for notliing else,
his 34 to 31 per cent victory in the Florida primary
over Wallace is of historic importance.
Since that time last spring, Carter has been
catapulated into national prominence. And as the
microphones recorded his soft accent responding
to questions about his Baptist faith, many people
felt an uneasiness concerning this new political
figure.
How much does the manner of speech and
philosophical outlook affect voters? I can only
answer from personal experience, one which fo
cuses not on Jimmy Carter, but his wife Rosalyn.
Sorely mistaken
A few weeks ago, the candidate's wife visited a
congressional campaign headquarters in Los

Angeles in which I worked. I expected her to give a
stock speech with the usual rhetoric, but was sorely
mistaken. The lilting tones of her voice were pleas
ingly disarming as she casually spoke of the times
when she and her husband were happily surprised
if 20 people came to hear him speak.
It suddenly hit me how amazing Carter's rise to
prominence has been. And despite my cynicism, 1
found myself willing to accept the phrase, "trust
me," and the talk of a government of love that
surrounded it. I was experiencing the positive side
of the Carter southern inflection.
Yet, judging the response to Carter's recent re
marks in Playboy magazine, 1 think my views must
be in the minority. Aside from the few sensational
references to his opinions on sexual sin, the
Playboy interview deals primarily with Carter's
politics, ethics, friends and family. Statements
such as "My wife and 1 were born and raised in
innocent times. The normal thing to do was to goto
church" seem almost puritanical in today's society.
Typical environment
Still, one should keep in mind that Carter's re
ligious beliefs are derived from what was a typical
environment in the rural South. Like John Kennedy
before him, he does not believe his religious per
suasion renders him incapable of making fair deci
sions in secular matters. The qualifications of a
president are not a matter of style and background
as media campaigns lead us to believe.
It would be a shame, therefore, were the Democ
ratic nominee to be rejected on the basis of his
upbringing.
Sadly, such a prejudice does exist. As Carter
lamented in Playboy, "There's still a tendency on
the part of some members of the press to treat the
South, you know, as a suspect nation. There are a
few who think that since 1 am a Southern governor,
I must be a secret racist or there's something in a
closet somewhere that's going to be revealed to
show my true colors. There's been a constant prob
ing back 10, 12 years in my background, even as
early as the first primaries."
Americans must try to understand what they per
ceive as different. If not, we may wind up with a
President Carter who feels the same alienation
Johnson did. and only because he was born a few
more degrees latitude closer to the equator than
most of us.
