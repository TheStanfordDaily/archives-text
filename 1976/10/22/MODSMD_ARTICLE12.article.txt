# A-bomb atrocities told by Hiroshima survivors

Rev. Gyotsu Sato, one of the
Japanese survivors of the
Hiroshima atomic bomb explo
sion, recently urged for an inter
national agreement prohibiting
the use of nuclear weapons.
Speaking before about 25 per
sons at the Bechtel International
Center on Wednesday, Sato dis
cussed a proposal recently pre
sented to the United Nations
General Assembly by a special
Japanese delegation, calling for
such an agreement.
Sato, chairman of the Japan
Council Against Atomic and
Hydrogen Bombs, presented a
panel discussion, slide show
and film on various atomic and
hydrogen bomb after-effects
with three other survivors.
Discussing the Japanese prop
osal, Sato said it states that the
United Nations should "take the
initiative to make the reality and
after-effect of the atomic bomb
ing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
known to the whole world, and
awaken world public opinion
demanding the total elimination
of nuclear weapons."
"It will not be easy to force
nuclear-producing nations to
reduce their armaments, but we
are confident that if the poeple of
the world demand such action,
they will be listened to," Sato
commented.
He went on to say that the
greatest responsibility lies on
the shoulders of the American
people because the United States
is supporting and stimulating
the armaments race with its in
vention of the Trident nuclear
submarine systems.
"Japan: The Country Covered
with Nuclear Bases" was the

discussion topic of Etsuro
Honda, chairman of the
Shizuaka Prefecture High
School Teachers Union. Accord
ing to Honda, the U.S. Army has
approximately 136 bases in Ja
pan, 57 of which are concen
trated in Okinawa.
"American, peace-loving
friends, I'd like to tell you
frankly about the intolerable
pain and disgrace which this
situation has been imposing on
the Japanese people," Honda
said.
"Japanese and U.S. ruling
classes have been using the false
logic that the nuclear umbrella
has been keeping the security of
the Japanese people in accor
dance with the U.S.-Japanese
Security Treaty," he continued.
"But this rationale, based on the
theories of 'Nuclear Deterrence'
and 'Balance of Power,' has be
come a threat to the survival of
the human kind, bringing about
the vicious circle of the nuclear
arms race and the first-strike pol
icy."
Psychological and medical
after-effects were t he 1 ecture sub
jects of the remaining two
speakers, Takashi Nakamoto and

Dr. Eiichi Kobayashi.
Nakamoto, a victim 29
kilometers from the epicenter of
the Hiroshima A-bomb, de
scribed the scene as he remem
bered it. Nakamoto also talked
about his daughter's death
caused by leukemia, a disease
directly related to bomb radia
tion.
"Damages resulting from nuc
lear radiation are both physical
and spiritual, and they increase
as the exposed individuals grow
older," commented Dr.
Kobayashi, in his discussion of
the medical aspects of the
A-bomb.
Kobayashi said that cancer,
liver trouble, leukemia, anemia
and cataracts are among the dis
eases now registered by Japanese
law as "A-bomb diseases."
A film entitled "Walk" and a
slide show composed of
sketches by victims of the
Hiroshima A-bomb explosion
were also part of the presenta
tion. The film recounted a recent
Japanese peace march from
Tokyo to Hiroshima made by
over 5700 people who favored
the banning of nuclear weapons.
