# Vienna Garden not always hot
## 
### Nancy Wilson 
The Vienna Garden Restaur
ant in Palo Alto is very much a
family-run operation. Joe Kruz
along with his daughter and son
run the restaurant aiming to pre
sent meals with a twist all their
own. The style is mostly Hunga
rian with some Austrian and
German ideas mixed in. To af
ford maximum attention to each
dish, the menu selection rotates
nightly, narrowing the choice
down to about six entrees and at
least two soups, sa lads and
desserts.
For soups we tried the chicken
liver dumplings and the
tomato-beef vegetable soup.
Though we didn't find much
beef per se, the tomato vegeta
ble soup had a hearty flavor,
packed with garden vegetables.
The chicken soup was mostly a
rather bland broth, with several
dumplings, also lacking
any remarkable flavor. Indeed,
the tomato soup was our favo
rite. On a second visit 1 reordered
the tomato vegetable soup and
was less impressed. This turned
out to be a recurring feature:
perhaps as a side effect to a fam
ily run show, some nights are
better than others.
One dish that retained its orig
inal delicious flavor was the
zucchini salad. It is made with
thinly sliced zucchini and a
sweet-sour dressing that carries
just the right amount of spices
and sugar. Definitely a great way

to start off a meal, or even com
plete enough flavor-wise to
serve as a light meal after soup.
We also ordered the Caesar's
salad, which was fine, though
the anchovy flavor seemed a bit
too strong.
The entree selection includes
stuffed cabbage. Schnitzel Ber
liner, Rostbrauten, Vienna Saus
age, Schnitzel Holstein, Veal
Paprikas, Beef Stroganoff and
more. The price range is $5 to $6
for an ample portion. Veal Pap
rikas is served over spaetzels
(thick noodles), with an abun
dance of sour cream and mus
hroom sauce. The overall flavor
is good and on the mild side. The
Stroganoff resembled the Pap
rikas, but was served over wide,
flat noodles. The two entrees
have distinctive tastes, though
both have the same mild quality.
The Stroganoff was another
example of inconsistent
quality. On neither occasion was
is not good, but one time it had
just a little more spark than the
other.
Family dish
We also tried the Schnitzel
Berliner, which is the Kruz fam
ily version of veal cordon bleu.
The body of the dish is a fine
blend of cheese and veal, along
with a special variety of ham.
This dish is richer than the two
previously described, and is
something worth going out for.
Perhaps as notable as the en
trees themselves were the side

vegetables. With the schintzel
came a well rounded German
potato salad and red cabbage.
Brightening up the Stroganoff
and Paprikas were steamed car
rots that had been seasoned with
honey and cinnamon. They
picked up a very special flavor
without getting sticky-sweet.
Some may object that it's like
having dessert with dinner,
though that's probably just why I
liked it.
Dessert selection is limited to
a caramel dumpling, a
palatschintek, a mocha cream
and ice cream or sherbert. The
dumpling was a light biscuit
with caramel sauce and whipped
cream: sweet, sticky, delicious,
but better some times than
others. Palatschintek is the Hun
garian version of a crepe and
comes stuffed with apricot but
ter, lekvar (prune butter) or

cheese. Both the apricot and
prune butter fillings are very
good.
Having eaten our fill, we then
enjoyed a glass of Tokay, a nutty
flavored sherry, and also tasted
some Black Muscat. Both made a
pleasant after-dinner drink,
though personally I prefer the
sherry.
Backyard garden
Vienna Carden Restaurant
also serves lunch and offers a
backyard garden to eat in when
weather permits. The garden
set-up offers greenery and pri
vacy among the low-hanging
boughs.
The touch of the Kruz family
shows in their personal attention
to service and decor. Even the
ladies room is specially done.
They offer things a little differ
ently, very personally and at a
modest price.
