What do you do when the courts decide that the
rights to the musical you're performing belong to
someone else and that you must stop your perfor
mances? If you're the cast of the local production
of "Boy Meets Boy", a show satirizing the musi
cals of the 1930s and their boy-meets-girl, boy
loses-girl, boy-gets-girl plots, you give yourself 48
hours to get a new show together and wryly title it
"The Injunction Follies." (A Superior Court tem
porary injunction stopped them, you see,
so . . . get it?)
The cast had difficulties with the first "Boy
Meets Boy" producer, Edith O'Hara, and was par
tially fired and partially quit on a tempermental
Saturday night last August. Low Moan Spectacu
lar, a group which created and produced "El
Grande de Coca-Cola" in San Francisco a few
years ago, and "Bullshot Crummond", which is in
its second year at the Hippodrome Theatre, step
ped in and volunteered to stage the show, pleas
ing "Boy Meets Boy" writers Donald Ward and
Bill Solly, who were having royalty problems
with O'Hara, and pleasing the displaced cast of
"Boy Meets Boy", but displeasing O'Hara.
For a while the City had two productions of
"Boy Meets Boy", but on her second try O'Hara
got her temporary injunction. And while Low
Moan fights back in court — a final decision on
who owns the rights to the local production is
expected bythe end of the month — we get "The
Injunction Follies." (Low Moan wants to keep the
show going even if they get the rights to "Boy
Meets Boy."
"The Injunction Follies" is a comedy revue,
which means that short skits are interspaced with
short songs. Most of the music is by Solly — tunes
from the new musical he's writing — and the skits
were written by three members of Low Moan
Spectacular, Ron House, Diz White and Alan
Sherman.
The cosmopolitan show satirizes life in Italy,
France, Japan, England, Cermany and the United

States. It also ridicules the m*vtial arts, that first
date, "revolutionary" poetry, magicians and
priests. Much of their satire is shallow and some
what boring but the 90 minutes flies by fast
enough and the talented cast capitalizes excel
lently on the sporadic moments of humor so that
the show becomes partly entertaining.
1 especially enjoyed the radical poetry of Juan
Tanomera, who beautifully wrote, as he was ar
rested by the fascist dictatorship:"l didn't do it!/ It
was my brother Pablo and the Valdez boy!/ I'll tell
you where the hideout is!/ Kill them,, don't kill
me!" Three girls softly sang "VVonton American"
in the background while a scholarly-looking gent
leman tenderly read Juan's lines.
The group also did a nice take-off on American
rock'n'roll entertainers of the 1950s and a tunny
sketch on an Italian couple who go for a drive.
(Naples to Rome in two hours.) Many of the skits
relied on off-color events for their humor — a
fierce desire to urinate, a kick to the groin, the size
of one's more private places and sexual inter
course with a chair — and when they nicely
hinted at the intentions it seemed to work, but
when the material was more explicit much of the
humor vanished.
The cast (Anna-Lee Austin, Mark Clark, Ron
House, Madelaine Hurley, Craig Mason, Tom
Mielsen, Sean Sharp, Alan Shearman, Marsha
Solton, Diz White and Rayjond Wood) does a fine,
high-energy job zipping the material by quick
enough so that what you don't like doesn't last
very long.
In the post-production plea for patronage, one
cast member told the audience to tell their friends
if they liked it"and to keep your mouth shut if you
didn't. My mouth is about 40 per cent open.
