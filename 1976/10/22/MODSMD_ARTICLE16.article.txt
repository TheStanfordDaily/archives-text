## 'New-look' Cougars still kittens Cardinals face WSU 
### David Georgette 
New uniforms, new helmets
and a new coach — on the sur
face the Washington State
Cougars are sporting a different
look this season.
But don't mourn the loss of a
team whose schedule slot in the
past was usually chalked up in
the opponent's win column long
before the game had taken place.
With all the changes, one
thing remains the same —
Washington State is 1-5 this year
and 0-2 in the Pacific-8. "We're
not a good football team yet,"
said first-year coach Jackie Sher
rill.
Cards 1-1 in Pac-8
At times this year, the Stan
ford Cardinals have not shown
themselves to be a very good
team, either. The Cards, 1-1 in
the conference and 2-4 overall,
will have an opportunity tomor
row afternoon in Pullman,
Wash., to show just how good
they are when they take on the
Cougars. Kick-off is set for 1:30
(KSFO 560 AM).
A glance at the depth charts
illustrates one of the reasons
WSU has only one triumph — its
home-opener three weeks ago
against Idaho, 45-6. "We line up
with one senior on defense and
two seniors on offense," Sherill
said.
The lack of experience on the
Cougar roster is not reflected in

Sherrill. He played on three
bowl teams and two national
championship teams at
Alabama under Paul "Bear"
Bryant.
Crimson Tide
Sherrill coached for a year
with the Crimson Tide before
moving to Arkansas to aide coach
Frank Broyles. He assisted
Johnny Majors for the last eight
years, first at lowa State and then
at Pittsburgh.
The Cougars' depth problems
have surfaced during a rough
schedule. Opening the season
with three consecutive losses to
Kansas, Minnesota and Wiscon
sin, Washington State had the
honor of kicking off its Pac-8
slate against USC and UCLA.
The two Los Angeles schools
turned the Cougars into kittens,
as Ricky Bell turned in a 346-
yard performance in Seattle's
Kingdome and coach Terry
Donahue slaughtered WSU,
62-3.
Raging wildcat
The Cougs might have been
kittens last week, but Stanford
coach Jack Christiansen talks
like the Cardinals will be going
into the Palouse brushlands to
cage a raging wildcat.
"They always get pretty well
pumped up when they play
Stanford," said Christiansen.
The Cards' last trip to Pullman
resulted in a narrow, 20-18 vie-

Tory in 1974. "It's like the age
old thing," said Chris, "a state
school versus a private school."
Christiansen added that most
of Stanford's visits to Pullman
have coincided with a special
event day at Martin Stadium.
Tomorrow is Dad's Day at
Washington State.
A Cougar the fathers will have
their eyes on is junior split end
Mike Levenseller. He leads the
Pac-8 in receiving with 36 grabs
for 603 yards and four
touchdowns.
'Speed guy'
According to Christiansen,
Levenseller catches a lot of short
and middle-distance passes, and
is "not a speed guy that does
deep."
Washington State's second
lei s ling receiver is also second in
conference stats. Fullback Dan
Doornick has 26 receptions for
202 yards and one touchdown.
"Up until this time, they might
be as good a passing team as
we've faced," said Christiansen.
Getting the ball to Levenseller
and Doornick has been handled
by sophomore Jack Thompson
for most the season. In only 14
quarters of action, Thompson, a
quarterback who likes the poc
ket, has completed 60 per cent
of his passes for 1231 yards and
nine touchdowns. That's good
enough for third in the Pac-8
statistics.
Best passing team
How can a team lead the na
tion in passing offense and be
1-5? "They've been behind and
they've been throwing,"
answers Christiansen.
It's fortunate the Cougars have
been able to move the ball
through the air, because they
have on mustered only 77 yards
rushing per game.
Washington State launches its
air game from "multiple offen
sive formations which can cause
problems for the defense," said
Christiansen.

the nation.

202 yards and one touchdown.
"Up until this time, they might
be as good a passing team as
we've faced," said Christiansen.
Getting the ball to Levenseller
and Doornick has been handled
by sophomore Jack Thompson
for most the season. In only 14
quarters of action, Thompson, a
quarterback who likes the poc
ket, has completed 60 per cent
of his passes for 1231 yards and
nine touchdowns. That's good
enough for third in the Pac-8
statistics.
Best passing team
How can a team lead the na
tion in passing offense and be
1-5? "They've been behind and
they've been throwing,"
answers Christiansen.
It's fortunate the Cougars have
been able to move the ball
through the air, because they
have on mustered only 77 yards
rushing per game.
Washington State launches its
air game from "multiple offen
sive formations which can cause
problems for the defense," said
Christiansen.


Gang tackle —Daily photo by Randy Keith
Stanford defenders Duncan McColl (77), John Harris (78) and Gordy Ceresino (95) try to bring
down Washington's Robin Earl in action from last week. The Card defense will have its work cut
out tomorrow afternoon when Stanford takes on Washington State —the best passing team in
the nation.
New uniforms, new helmets
and a new coach — on the sur
face the Washington State
Cougars are sporting a different
look this season.
But don't mourn the loss of a
team whose schedule slot in the
past was usually chalked up in
the opponent's win column long
before the game had taken place.
With all the changes, one
thing remains the same —
Washington State is 1-5 this year
and 0-2 in the Pacific-8. "We're
not a good football team yet,"
said first-year coach Jackie Sher
rill.
Cards 1-1 in Pac-8
At times this year, the Stan
ford Cardinals have not shown
themselves to be a very good
team, either. The Cards, 1-1 in
the conference and 2-4 overall,
will have an opportunity tomor
row afternoon in Pullman,
Wash., to show just how good
they are when they take on the
Cougars. Kick-off is set for 1:30
(KSFO 560 AM).
A glance at the depth charts
illustrates one of the reasons
WSU has only one triumph — its
home-opener three weeks ago
against Idaho, 45-6. "We line up
with one senior on defense and
two seniors on offense," Sherill
said.
The lack of experience on the
Cougar roster is not reflected in

Sherrill. He played on three
bowl teams and two national
championship teams at
Alabama under Paul "Bear"
Bryant.
Crimson Tide
Sherrill coached for a year
with the Crimson Tide before
moving to Arkansas to aide coach
Frank Broyles. He assisted
Johnny Majors for the last eight
years, first at lowa State and then
at Pittsburgh.
The Cougars' depth problems
have surfaced during a rough
schedule. Opening the season
with three consecutive losses to
Kansas, Minnesota and Wiscon
sin, Washington State had the
honor of kicking off its Pac-8
slate against USC and UCLA.
The two Los Angeles schools
turned the Cougars into kittens,
as Ricky Bell turned in a 346-
yard performance in Seattle's
Kingdome and coach Terry
Donahue slaughtered WSU,
62-3.
Raging wildcat
The Cougs might have been
kittens last week, but Stanford
coach Jack Christiansen talks
like the Cardinals will be going
into the Palouse brushlands to
cage a raging wildcat.
"They always get pretty well
pumped up when they play
Stanford," said Christiansen.
The Cards' last trip to Pullman
resulted in a narrow, 20-18 vie-

Tory in 1974. "It's like the age
old thing," said Chris, "a state
school versus a private school."
Christiansen added that most
of Stanford's visits to Pullman
have coincided with a special
event day at Martin Stadium.
Tomorrow is Dad's Day at
Washington State.
A Cougar the fathers will have
their eyes on is junior split end
Mike Levenseller. He leads the
Pac-8 in receiving with 36 grabs
for 603 yards and four
touchdowns.
'Speed guy'
According to Christiansen,
Levenseller catches a lot of short
and middle-distance passes, and
is "not a speed guy that does
deep."
Washington State's second
lei s ling receiver is also second in
conference stats. Fullback Dan
Doornick has 26 receptions for
202 yards and one touchdown.

yard performance in Seattle's
Kingdome and coach Terry
Donahue slaughtered WSU,
62-3.
Raging wildcat
The Cougs might have been
kittens last week, but Stanford
coach Jack Christiansen talks
like the Cardinals will be going
into the Palouse brushlands to
cage a raging wildcat.
"They always get pretty well
pumped up when they play
Stanford," said Christiansen.
The Cards' last trip to Pullman
resulted in a narrow, 20-18 vie-

Tory in 1974. "It's like the age
old thing," said Chris, "a state
school versus a private school."
Christiansen added that most
of Stanford's visits to Pullman
have coincided with a special
event day at Martin Stadium.
Tomorrow is Dad's Day at
Washington State.
A Cougar the fathers will have
their eyes on is junior split end
Mike Levenseller. He leads the
Pac-8 in receiving with 36 grabs
for 603 yards and four
touchdowns.
'Speed guy'
According to Christiansen,
Levenseller catches a lot of short
and middle-distance passes, and
is "not a speed guy that does
deep."
Washington State's second
lei s ling receiver is also second in
conference stats. Fullback Dan
Doornick has 26 receptions for
202 yards and one touchdown.
"Up until this time, they might
be as good a passing team as
we've faced," said Christiansen.
Getting the ball to Levenseller
and Doornick has been handled
by sophomore Jack Thompson
for most the season. In only 14
quarters of action, Thompson, a
quarterback who likes the poc
ket, has completed 60 per cent
of his passes for 1231 yards and
nine touchdowns. That's good
enough for third in the Pac-8
statistics.
Best passing team
How can a team lead the na
tion in passing offense and be
1-5? "They've been behind and
they've been throwing,"
answers Christiansen.
It's fortunate the Cougars have
been able to move the ball
through the air, because they
have on mustered only 77 yards
rushing per game.
Washington State launches its
air game from "multiple offen
sive formations which can cause
problems for the defense," said
Christiansen.

the nation.
New uniforms, new helmets
and a new coach — on the sur
face the Washington State
Cougars are sporting a different
look this season.
But don't mourn the loss of a
team whose schedule slot in the
past was usually chalked up in
the opponent's win column long
before the game had taken place.
With all the changes, one
thing remains the same —
Washington State is 1-5 this year
and 0-2 in the Pacific-8. "We're
not a good football team yet,"
said first-year coach Jackie Sher
rill.
Cards 1-1 in Pac-8
At times this year, the Stan
ford Cardinals have not shown
themselves to be a very good
team, either. The Cards, 1-1 in
the conference and 2-4 overall,
will have an opportunity tomor
row afternoon in Pullman,
Wash., to show just how good
they are when they take on the
Cougars. Kick-off is set for 1:30
(KSFO 560 AM).
A glance at the depth charts
illustrates one of the reasons
WSU has only one triumph — its
home-opener three weeks ago
against Idaho, 45-6. "We line up
with one senior on defense and
two seniors on offense," Sherill
said.
The lack of experience on the
Cougar roster is not reflected in

Sherrill. He played on three
bowl teams and two national
championship teams at
Alabama under Paul "Bear"
Bryant.
Crimson Tide
Sherrill coached for a year
with the Crimson Tide before
moving to Arkansas to aide coach
Frank Broyles. He assisted
Johnny Majors for the last eight
years, first at lowa State and then
at Pittsburgh.
The Cougars' depth problems
have surfaced during a rough
schedule. Opening the season
with three consecutive losses to
Kansas, Minnesota and Wiscon
sin, Washington State had the
honor of kicking off its Pac-8
slate against USC and UCLA.
