rowly missed a second con
secutive perfect week last
Saturday when Oregon State
upset California, 10-9. He's
still off to one of his best starts
in years, having hit on seven of
eight games (88 per cent).
The Stanford Cardinals
leave this morning for 36
action-packed hours in east
ern Washington. Tomorrow

teams have great passing at
tacks, but both have trouble
on defense.
The Cal-UCLA game at
Berkeley, tomorrow afternoon
at 1:30 is the best game of the
week and also the toughest to

but we'll take Cat.
One more defeat and the
Bears will be all but eliminated
from the Rose Bowl race.
Coach Mike White knows it

ously doesn't help, but Cal is
deep at quarterback and wide
receiver.
Craig Fertig returns to USC,
where he coached for 10
years under John McKay, as
his Oregon State Beavers
take on the Trojans in Los
Angeles.
Oregon plays at
