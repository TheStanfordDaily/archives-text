# Card poloists hosts UCLA today
## Walk-on stars for poloists 
### Chris Kamel 
Looking at Marty Davis, one
would not get the impression
that he plays water polo, one of
the most physically demanding
sports on the Farm.
But underneath his lean
5-foot-ll frame, Davis is indeed
a poloist and one of the best
players on the team, according to
Card water polo coach Art Lam
bert.
The circumstances which led
Davis to the position he is in
right now — varsity starter and
one of the leading scorers — is a
riches-to-rags saga.
Davis was not recruited and
came out as a walk-on for the
junior varsity team during his
freshman year. But he moved
into the varsity starting lineup
only three quarters after his arri
val here.
'Came from nowhere'
"He just came out of
nowhere," recalls Lambert.
"You keep your fingers crossed
for a guy like that, but chances

are he never materializes."
If Davis' quick rise into the
spotlight led to a book or a
movie, it's doubtful that the
story would sell very well. Davis
has a very low-keyed approach
to water polo.
"1 don't really get hyper for a
game," said Davis, "because
usually I don't play as well. 1 just
try to be relaxed and do things
naturally."
It didn't take long for his
teammates to realize that Davis
would play an integral part on
the team, using the qualities that
only come naturally to him.
Important role
Davis plays an important role
in Stanford's offense. He is a crit
ical part of Lambert's six-on-five
offensive formation, utilized
when the Cards have a one-man
advantage.
He also shares penalty shot
honors with teammate Doug
Burke. And with a rule change,
awarding a penalty shot to a
team after its opponent's seventh
foul, Davis is a valuable asset.
"This is an offensive-type
rule," said Lambert. "We have to
control our turnovers and not
take a bad shot selection in order
to beat the rule and our oppo
nents."
According to Davis, the new
rule gives an edge to UCLA
which the Cards host today at
3:30 p.m. at deCuerre Pools.
'Rules favor UCLA'
"The rules seem to favor
them," he admitted. "They have
good holemen (men who work
the ball out of the pivot)."
Lambert said UCLA has to be
considered the favorite on the
basis of its record. The Bruins
have lost just once — to defend
ing NCAA champion California,
12-11.
It should be a shootout, when
the Cards face UCLA, and the
contest might come down to a
duel — with Davis and Card Rick
Johannsen facing UCLA sharp

shooters Joe Vargas and Rick
Sherbourne.
Water polo dominates Davis'
schedule. During the off-season,
Davis is sticking to a tight train
ing schedule, which includes at
least nine hours of sleep a night.
But the junior from Redlands
still manages to keep one foot in
the water.
National competition
"During the summer, I mostly
work, but I also get a chance to
compete in the nationals for
Stanford," he said. "You really
get good playing experience."
Davis made the second All-
Tournament team.
When Davis does get time off
from water polo, his activities

follow his mellow character.
"When my weekends are not
taken up by water polo, l just likr
to relax and get away from
school," he said. "1 enjoy going
to the City or to the mountains."
But he is always trying to im
prove his game. At the moment.
Davis just wants to work on the
little parts of his game.
"I really want to start
capitalizing a littlemore on our
opponents' mistakes," he said,
"while forcing more turnovers
on defense."
Davis would like to weight
train. "As 1 get stronger, I he
come a better player," he said.
Once Davis has reached these
standards, he said he will he
satisfied with himself.

would play an integral part on
the team, using the qualities that
only come naturally to him.
Important role
Davis plays an important role
in Stanford's offense. He is a crit
ical part of Lambert's six-on-five
offensive formation, utilized
when the Cards have a one-man
advantage.
He also shares penalty shot
honors with teammate Doug
Burke. And with a rule change,
awarding a penalty shot to a
team after its opponent's seventh
foul, Davis is a valuable asset.
"This is an offensive-type
rule," said Lambert. "We have to
control our turnovers and not
take a bad shot selection in order
to beat the rule and our oppo
nents."
According to Davis, the new
rule gives an edge to UCLA
which the Cards host today at
3:30 p.m. at deCuerre Pools.
'Rules favor UCLA'
"The rules seem to favor
them," he admitted. "They have
good holemen (men who work
the ball out of the pivot)."
Lambert said UCLA has to be
considered the favorite on the
basis of its record. The Bruins
have lost just once — to defend
ing NCAA champion California,
12-11.
It should be a shootout, when
the Cards face UCLA, and the
contest might come down to a
duel — with Davis and Card Rick
Johannsen facing UCLA sharp

shooters Joe Vargas and Rick
Sherbourne.
Water polo dominates Davis'
schedule. During the off-season,
Davis is sticking to a tight train
ing schedule, which includes at
least nine hours of sleep a night.
But the junior from Redlands
still manages to keep one foot in
the water.
National competition
"During the summer, I mostly
work, but I also get a chance to
compete in the nationals for
Stanford," he said. "You really
get good playing experience."
Davis made the second All-
Tournament team.
When Davis does get time off
from water polo, his activities

follow his mellow character.
"When my weekends are not
taken up by water polo, l just likr
to relax and get away from
school," he said. "1 enjoy going
to the City or to the mountains."
But he is always trying to im
prove his game. At the moment.
Davis just wants to work on the
little parts of his game.
"I really want to start
capitalizing a littlemore on our
opponents' mistakes," he said,
"while forcing more turnovers
on defense."
Davis would like to weight
train. "As 1 get stronger, I he
come a better player," he said.
Once Davis has reached these
standards, he said he will he

Card poloist Marty Davis (39) maneuvers between two UCLA Bruins in action from last year's
3-2 win over UCLA. Stanford will host the Bruins in a crucial contest this afternoon at 3:30 in
deGuerre Pools.
Looking at Marty Davis, one
would not get the impression
that he plays water polo, one of
the most physically demanding
sports on the Farm.
But underneath his lean
5-foot-ll frame, Davis is indeed
a poloist and one of the best
players on the team, according to
Card water polo coach Art Lam
bert.
The circumstances which led
Davis to the position he is in
right now — varsity starter and
one of the leading scorers — is a
riches-to-rags saga.
Davis was not recruited and
came out as a walk-on for the
junior varsity team during his
freshman year. But he moved
into the varsity starting lineup
only three quarters after his arri
val here.
'Came from nowhere'
"He just came out of
nowhere," recalls Lambert.
"You keep your fingers crossed
for a guy like that, but chances

are he never materializes."
If Davis' quick rise into the
spotlight led to a book or a
movie, it's doubtful that the
story would sell very well. Davis
has a very low-keyed approach
to water polo.
"1 don't really get hyper for a
game," said Davis, "because
usually I don't play as well. 1 just
try to be relaxed and do things
naturally."
It didn't take long for his
teammates to realize that Davis
would play an integral part on

only come naturally to him.

Water polo dominates Davis'
schedule. During the off-season,
Davis is sticking to a tight train
ing schedule, which includes at
least nine hours of sleep a night.
But the junior from Redlands
still manages to keep one foot in
the water.
National competition
"During the summer, I mostly
work, but I also get a chance to
compete in the nationals for
Stanford," he said. "You really
get good playing experience."
Davis made the second All-
Tournament team.
When Davis does get time off
from water polo, his activities

follow his mellow character.
"When my weekends are not
taken up by water polo, l just likr
to relax and get away from
school," he said. "1 enjoy going
to the City or to the mountains."
But he is always trying to im
prove his game. At the moment.
Davis just wants to work on the
little parts of his game.
"I really want to start
capitalizing a littlemore on our
opponents' mistakes," he said,
"while forcing more turnovers
on defense."
Davis would like to weight
train. "As 1 get stronger, I he
come a better player," he said.
Once Davis has reached these
standards, he said he will he
satisfied with himself.
