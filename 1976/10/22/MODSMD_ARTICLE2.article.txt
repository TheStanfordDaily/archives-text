## Reds win Series 
### 
New York (AP) â€”Johnny Bench smashed a pair
of home runs and drove in five runs as the Cin
cinnati Reds defeated the New York Yankees 7-2
last night, completing a four-game sweep of the
1976 World Series. .
The Keds became the first National
League team in 54 years to win consecutive
world championships. The last NL team to ac
complish that feat was the New York Giants of
1921-22.
For the first time in the Series, the Reds had to
come from behind. Hut they did the job in typi
cal Cincinnati style, with a stolen base setting
the stage and home runs both capping the win
ning rally and breaking the game open.
