# Levinson: a well-rounded Scotcher
## Captain can't put 'books ahead of people' 
### Debbie Carlton 
What's it like to be good at all the things you
love? Ask kathy Levinson, whose leadership
and commitment on the hockey field are
matched by an eagerness to enrich herself and
get involved in off-field activities as well.
Like many Stanford students, she attempts
to keep her hands in many cherished pots,
without spreading herselftoo thin. She is un
disputedly a "jock" — but a well-rounded
one.
A senior, from Winchester, Mass., she was
recently elected captain of the field hockey
team. Levinson will be the first Scotcher to
earn four varsity letters.
She has received invitations to participate
in several national field hockey camps —
training grounds for serious national field
hockey squad contenders.
'Positive things'
According to Scotcher coach Shirley
Schoof, Levinson's field prowess is a result of
being "very fast and aggressive, very creative
and thinking a lot. She knows what to do with
the ball and does very positive things with it."
Levinson has always been a "jock" and
said, "I think it is really something to be
proud of." Her dedication to sports has taken
its toll in the form of a nose which has been
broken five times. "Only four were from hoc
key — the other was from basketball," she
joked.
Levinson loves to win, but feels she is mel
lowing out in her old age. "I'm not as driven
by beating someone else as much as doing the

best 1 can," she said. She doesn't play the
worrisome "measure-and-compare" game,
which she feels prevails among many Stan
ford students.
"1 guess the competition with yourself is
what it comes down to," Levinson observed,
adding, "But I set high standards for myself."
The star Scotcher "didn't come to Stanford
just for hockey," but is eager to see California
hockey make big strides.
Cut hockey schedule
This year Levinson has pared her hockey
schedule to 20 hours a week. Much of the
remaining time is divided between her re
sponsibilities as Stanford's NCI AC hockey
representative, a post on the Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation,
and her position as a Residential Assistant (RA)
in Madera.
Levinson, stating that "everything 1 do is
important to me," takes her dorm respon
sibilities especially seriously.
Last summer, Levinson survived a serious
car accident, and the incident deeply altered
her philosophy. She now feels a strong
need to spend time with people and savor
life's experiences.
"I think my values are different than most
people at Stanford — 1 don't spend that much
time studying." For her, a well-balanced ex
tracurricular diet is supplemented by "book
ing," and she wouldn't feast in any other or
der.
"People have so much to offer," she states.
"I can't put books in front of people."
