Novelist Saul Bellow wins Nobel Prize for literature
Stockholm, Sweden — Novelist Saul Bellow won the Nobel Prize for litera
ture yesterday for his books portraying modern man as frightened and alien
ated but still striving "to find a foothold in a tottering world."
He was the seventh American to win the coveted award and completed an
unprecedented sweep of the 1976 prizes by the United States.
Bellow, 61, had been prominently mentioned as a possible winner last year
but the 1975 prize went to Italian poet Eugenio Montale.
Bellow, known for his caustic comments about writers' awards, continued in
the same vein, telling reporters at a Chicago news conference: "Thechild in me
is delighted."
In announcing Bellow's prize, the academy also cited him for "the human
understanding and subtle analysis of contemporary culture that are combined
in his work."
Smith threatens walkout on Geneva conference
Geneva, Switzerland — Rhodesian Prime Minister lan Smith threatened
yesterday to walk out on Geneva talks on the future of his country if black
nationalists "undermine" the U.S.-British package deal he accepted last
month.
With both sides testing their strength, Smith talked of a walkout after arriv
ing for informal talks preceding the start on Oct. 2B of the conference called by
Britain to work out an interim government. This would guide Rhodesia toward
full rule by its 6.4 million blacks in two years.
Ruling out black demands that the 270,000 whites surrender key defense and
security positions in the proposed biracial interim government, Smith insisted
that white control of these posts was promised him by U.S. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger in securing Smith's agreement to confer. Smith added he has
an unsigned document given him by the U.S. secretary to prove it.
Inflation eases, but purchasing power declines
Washington — Inflation eased slightly in September but the average wage
earner continued to lose ground as purchasing power declined for the second
consecutive month.
Retail prices rose four-tenths of a per cent last month, compared with in
creases of five-tenths in each of the preceding three months.
Another report, on purchasing power, was less favorable. It showed the
buying power of the average workers' paycheck declined five-tenths of one per
cent.
President Gerald Ford and his Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter were
quick to offer different interpretations of yesterday's reports by the Labor
Department, the final major economic statistics to be released before the elec
tion.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy fog and low clouds along the coast.
Fog and low clouds extending locally inland this morning. A little cooler. Lows
in the upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs both days in the 60s and low 70s.

Britain to work out an interim government. This would guide Rhodesia toward
full rule by its 6.4 million blacks in two years.
Ruling out black demands that the 270,000 whites surrender key defense and
security positions in the proposed biracial interim government, Smith insisted
that white control of these posts was promised him by U.S. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger in securing Smith's agreement to confer. Smith added he has
an unsigned document given him by the U.S. secretary to prove it.
Inflation eases, but purchasing power declines
Washington — Inflation eased slightly in September but the average wage
earner continued to lose ground as purchasing power declined for the second
consecutive month.
Retail prices rose four-tenths of a per cent last month, compared with in
creases of five-tenths in each of the preceding three months.
Another report, on purchasing power, was less favorable. It showed the
buying power of the average workers' paycheck declined five-tenths of one per
cent.
President Gerald Ford and his Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter were
quick to offer different interpretations of yesterday's reports by the Labor
Department, the final major economic statistics to be released before the elec
tion.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy fog and low clouds along the coast.
Fog and low clouds extending locally inland this morning. A little cooler. Lows
in the upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs both days in the 60s and low 70s.
Novelist Saul Bellow wins Nobel Prize for literature
Stockholm, Sweden — Novelist Saul Bellow won the Nobel Prize for litera
ture yesterday for his books portraying modern man as frightened and alien
ated but still striving "to find a foothold in a tottering world."
He was the seventh American to win the coveted award and completed an
unprecedented sweep of the 1976 prizes by the United States.
Bellow, 61, had been prominently mentioned as a possible winner last year
but the 1975 prize went to Italian poet Eugenio Montale.
Bellow, known for his caustic comments about writers' awards, continued in
the same vein, telling reporters at a Chicago news conference: "Thechild in me
is delighted."
In announcing Bellow's prize, the academy also cited him for "the human
understanding and subtle analysis of contemporary culture that are combined
in his work."
Smith threatens walkout on Geneva conference
Geneva, Switzerland — Rhodesian Prime Minister lan Smith threatened
yesterday to walk out on Geneva talks on the future of his country if black
nationalists "undermine" the U.S.-British package deal he accepted last
month.
With both sides testing their strength, Smith talked of a walkout after arriv
ing for informal talks preceding the start on Oct. 2B of the conference called by
Britain to work out an interim government. This would guide Rhodesia toward
full rule by its 6.4 million blacks in two years.
