FBI called in at SLAC
The FBI has been called in to investigate the Oct. 6 cable
cutting incident at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC), according to Robert Moulton, associate director
for administrative services.
SLAC facilities are under the control of the federal
Energy Research and Development Administration
(ERDA). SLAC reports all damages of government prop
erty to ERDA which in turn refers it to the FBI, according
to Moulton.
William Lusebrink, deputy manager of plant engineer
ing at SLAC, estimated damage at $2,000.
The FBI investigation is "still pending," according to
Special Agent Frank Perone of the bureau's San Francisco
office. While operations were not disrupted by the inci

dent, investigators view the matter "not as sabotage, but as
an attempt to destroy," said Perone.
Senate to handle tie
The tenth-place tie for ASSU Senate will be handled by
the senate itself, ASSU Elections Commissioner Randy
Bird said yesterday. ASSU officials say they plan to accept
all 21 top vote getters, and let the senate decide what to do
with the extra person. Bird said there is a distinct possibil
ity that one of the two tied for tenth place will become the;
chairman of the senate.
Bird claims that the election is officially ended, and that
he will not accept any more ballots from overseas. Any
new ballots which come in will be brought to the attention
of the senate to be used as a criteria to decide what to do,
said Bird.
