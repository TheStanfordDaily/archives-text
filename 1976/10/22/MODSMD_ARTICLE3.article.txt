# Candidate blunders haunt '76 campaign

### 
New York (AF) —Jimmy Carter com
plained yesterday that his morals were
impugned in ads approved by Presi
dent Gerald Ford. The president
meanwhile courted senior citizens and
East Europeans. Both men prepared to
debate one last time and to crisscross
the country until election day-
They were to visit the same public
platform in the evening, though at dif
ferent times to avoid a meeting. Carter
was booked into the annual A 1 Smith
Dinner in New York City half an hour
after Ford's departure from the event,
which honors the Democrat who lost
to Herbert Hoover in the 1928 presi
dential election.
During another of his now-frequent
wardhouse inspections, Carter told re
porters yesterday morning that a Ford
campaign committee ad placed in 350
newspapers in 22 states Wednesday
and yesterday tries "to insinuate that
Fm a special case and have low morals
simply because I granted an interview
with Playboy."
Republicans have repeatedly
criticized Carter for the interview in
which, among many other things, he
said he does not judge others because
he himself has lusted after women in
his heart and believes God forgives
him for this.
Ford sounded the GOP reaction
again yesterday when he told a news
conference that he had declined to be
interviewed by Playboy and added: "I
don't think a president of the United
States ought to be interviewed in a
magazine that has that format."
While Carter was home in Plains de
aling with the interview the Republi
cans won't let him forget, Ford was
home in the White House dealing with
the Eastern Europe statement that the
Democrats won't let him forget.
In another of his now-frequent Rose

Garden ceremonies, Ford told a group
of Hungarian-American leaders on the
20th anniversary of the Hungarian up
rising crushed by the Soviet army that
he shares their hope for Hungary's
eventual freedom.
Ford has made several special efforts
to win the support of ethnic groups
since he said during his second debate
with Carter that the Soviet Union
does not dominate Eastern Europe.
The president also presided at the
swearing-in or five members of the
federal Council on the Aging before an
audience of 200 in the White House
East Room. He said all Americans
could count on his administration and
the Council on the Aging to see that the
problems concerning older citizens
"are met head-on."
At roughly the same time on the op
posite end of the country, Democratic
vice presidential candidate Walter
Mondale was telling several hundred
senior citizens at the Sons of Norway
hall in Everett, Wash., that the Ford
administration tried "to make it more
expensive when you are sick."
"The cruelest thing you can do in
America is to raise the medical bills of
senior citizens," Mondale said. "What
they've done is repeal Medicare by
nickel-and-diming it to death" to the
point where it pays an average of 40
per cent of medical costs.

vice presidential candidate Walter
Mondale was telling several hundred
senior citizens at the Sons of Norway
hall in Everett, Wash., that the Ford
administration tried "to make it more
expensive when you are sick."
"The cruelest thing you can do in
America is to raise the medical bills of
senior citizens," Mondale said. "What
they've done is repeal Medicare by
nickel-and-diming it to death" to the
point where it pays an average of 40
per cent of medical costs.
New York (AF) —Jimmy Carter com
plained yesterday that his morals were
impugned in ads approved by Presi
dent Gerald Ford. The president
meanwhile courted senior citizens and
East Europeans. Both men prepared to
debate one last time and to crisscross
the country until election day-
They were to visit the same public
platform in the evening, though at dif
ferent times to avoid a meeting. Carter
was booked into the annual A 1 Smith
Dinner in New York City half an hour
after Ford's departure from the event,
which honors the Democrat who lost
to Herbert Hoover in the 1928 presi
dential election.
During another of his now-frequent
wardhouse inspections, Carter told re
porters yesterday morning that a Ford
campaign committee ad placed in 350
newspapers in 22 states Wednesday
and yesterday tries "to insinuate that
Fm a special case and have low morals
simply because I granted an interview
with Playboy."
Republicans have repeatedly
criticized Carter for the interview in
which, among many other things, he
said he does not judge others because
he himself has lusted after women in
his heart and believes God forgives
him for this.
Ford sounded the GOP reaction
again yesterday when he told a news
conference that he had declined to be
interviewed by Playboy and added: "I
don't think a president of the United
States ought to be interviewed in a
magazine that has that format."
While Carter was home in Plains de
aling with the interview the Republi
cans won't let him forget, Ford was
home in the White House dealing with
the Eastern Europe statement that the
Democrats won't let him forget.
In another of his now-frequent Rose

Garden ceremonies, Ford told a group
of Hungarian-American leaders on the
20th anniversary of the Hungarian up
rising crushed by the Soviet army that
he shares their hope for Hungary's
eventual freedom.
Ford has made several special efforts
to win the support of ethnic groups
since he said during his second debate
with Carter that the Soviet Union
does not dominate Eastern Europe.
The president also presided at the
swearing-in or five members of the
federal Council on the Aging before an
audience of 200 in the White House
East Room. He said all Americans
could count on his administration and
the Council on the Aging to see that the
problems concerning older citizens
"are met head-on."
At roughly the same time on the op
posite end of the country, Democratic
vice presidential candidate Walter
Mondale was telling several hundred
senior citizens at the Sons of Norway
hall in Everett, Wash., that the Ford
administration tried "to make it more
expensive when you are sick."
