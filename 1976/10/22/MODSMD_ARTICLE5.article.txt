# Dumbarton connection
## PA fights state over veto 
### Lonnie Rosenwald 
On Tuesday, Palo Alto will go to court in an effort to
retain the veto power over plans for construction of an
approach road to tie University Avenue to the planned
Dumbarton Bridge.
City attorneys are challenging the California State
Legislature's interpretation of a Streets and Highways
Code amendment dealing with Palo Alto. The language
reads that council approval is required for a connection to
be built "in the vicinity of Embarcadero Road."
Embarcadero Road, one of the original connection
routes proposed, was vetoed by Palo Alto under the
('ode's terms.
Now Palo Alto argues that University Avenue, another
of the proposed connection routes, also lies "in the vicin
ity of Embarcadero Road." The state claims University
Avenue is within the borders of East Palo Alto.
The bridge plans call for construction of three connec
tions between the bridge and Route 101, at Embarcadero
Road, University Avenue, and Marsh Road. A fourth con
nection already runs along Willow Road, and will be ex
panded.
A 1072 amendment to the State Streets and Highways
Code stipulated that approval of local communities, San
Mateo County and the Bay Conservation and Develop
ment Commission would be required prior to construction
of the proposed connections.
The amendment reads that Palo Alto has the option to
veto plans for such a connection "in the vicinity of Embar
cadero Road."
Palo Alto City Council exercised that right in barring the
Embarcadero Road connection. However„the state denies
the Council's veto power in the case of the University
Avenue connection, because it does not lie within city
territory.
The Palo Alto plaintiffs argue that not only would the
University Avenue connection run through the city's bay
lands, but would also lie within the vicinity of Embarcad
ero Road. Certain points along University Avenue are
within a mile of Embarcadero.

"The statutory language is clear," says assistant Palo
Alto city attorney Marilyn Taketa, who will represent the
cityincourt. But "the state's interpretation ofthe statute is
something different."
This legal dispute is the latest in a series of controver
sies which have pitted proponents of the new bridge
against no-growth opponents since the state legislature
approved $00 million in funds for the project in 1971.
Many Palo Alto residents view the entire Dumbarton
Bridge plan as a threat to their community and environ
ment. Calling the plan "another noisy network through
your town," Civic League President and former City
Councilman Alan Henderson warns, "With a potentially
six-lane bridge, you've got a lot of traffic going into Palo
Alto."
He and others view the connection routes as part of an
overall design to eventually build an east-west corridor
stretching from the East Bay to Route 280. This same
charge has been hurled at backers of the Willow Road
Improvement Project.
"There's going to be a lot of pressure to go on through,"
claims Henderson. "There are pressures from developers
in the East Bay," and"from business interests on this
side."
Henderson denies that the bridge is needed at all. "The
bridge is not at maximum capacity by a long range," he
says."The question is, 'Who wants this bridge?"'
Henderson says he feels not just developers and busi
ness interests are pushing the plan, but also the state Toll
Bridge Authority. "They've got to keep building bridges
or they go out of business."
Even a success in the current court suit does not
guarantee Palo Alto residents protection from new
commuter-generated traffic which the bridge will al
legedly bring into the area. "If you get more commuters
you're going to get more traffic." claims Henderson.
Estimates of construction costs for the bridge have esca
lated to over $100 million by 1975, compared to $00 mill
ion in 1971.

side."
Henderson denies that the bridge is needed at all. "The
bridge is not at maximum capacity by a long range," he
says."The question is, 'Who wants this bridge?"'
Henderson says he feels not just developers and busi
ness interests are pushing the plan, but also the state Toll
Bridge Authority. "They've got to keep building bridges
or they go out of business."
Even a success in the current court suit does not
guarantee Palo Alto residents protection from new
commuter-generated traffic which the bridge will al
legedly bring into the area. "If you get more commuters
you're going to get more traffic." claims Henderson.
Estimates of construction costs for the bridge have esca
lated to over $100 million by 1975, compared to $00 mill
ion in 1971.
On Tuesday, Palo Alto will go to court in an effort to
retain the veto power over plans for construction of an
approach road to tie University Avenue to the planned
Dumbarton Bridge.
City attorneys are challenging the California State
Legislature's interpretation of a Streets and Highways
Code amendment dealing with Palo Alto. The language
reads that council approval is required for a connection to
be built "in the vicinity of Embarcadero Road."
Embarcadero Road, one of the original connection
routes proposed, was vetoed by Palo Alto under the
('ode's terms.
Now Palo Alto argues that University Avenue, another
of the proposed connection routes, also lies "in the vicin
ity of Embarcadero Road." The state claims University
Avenue is within the borders of East Palo Alto.
The bridge plans call for construction of three connec
tions between the bridge and Route 101, at Embarcadero
Road, University Avenue, and Marsh Road. A fourth con
nection already runs along Willow Road, and will be ex
panded.
A 1072 amendment to the State Streets and Highways
Code stipulated that approval of local communities, San
Mateo County and the Bay Conservation and Develop
ment Commission would be required prior to construction
of the proposed connections.
The amendment reads that Palo Alto has the option to
veto plans for such a connection "in the vicinity of Embar
cadero Road."
Palo Alto City Council exercised that right in barring the
Embarcadero Road connection. However„the state denies
the Council's veto power in the case of the University
Avenue connection, because it does not lie within city
territory.
The Palo Alto plaintiffs argue that not only would the
University Avenue connection run through the city's bay
lands, but would also lie within the vicinity of Embarcad
ero Road. Certain points along University Avenue are
within a mile of Embarcadero.

"The statutory language is clear," says assistant Palo
Alto city attorney Marilyn Taketa, who will represent the
cityincourt. But "the state's interpretation ofthe statute is
something different."
This legal dispute is the latest in a series of controver
sies which have pitted proponents of the new bridge
against no-growth opponents since the state legislature
approved $00 million in funds for the project in 1971.
Many Palo Alto residents view the entire Dumbarton
Bridge plan as a threat to their community and environ
ment. Calling the plan "another noisy network through
your town," Civic League President and former City
Councilman Alan Henderson warns, "With a potentially
six-lane bridge, you've got a lot of traffic going into Palo
Alto."
He and others view the connection routes as part of an
overall design to eventually build an east-west corridor
stretching from the East Bay to Route 280. This same
charge has been hurled at backers of the Willow Road
Improvement Project.
"There's going to be a lot of pressure to go on through,"
claims Henderson. "There are pressures from developers
in the East Bay," and"from business interests on this
side."
