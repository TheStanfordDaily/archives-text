# No 'free choice' left for voters
## McCarthy challenges election laws 
### Jack Vaughn 
Burlingame—"The first unconstitu
tional presidential election in this cen
tury" may take place next month, in
dependent presidential candidate
Eugene McCarthy warned in a San
Francisco airport press conference

yesterday.
Completing a visit to California
promoting his write-in candidacy,
McCarthy said state laws requiring
strict qualifications in order for candi
dates to appear on ballots, together
with the new federal election law re
stricting political donations to presi
dential candidates, constitute "dis
crimination against the right of the
people to have a reasonably free choice
in the presidential election."
McCarthy cited a U.S. Supreme
Court ruling nullifying several provi
sions of the federal election law, in
cluding some sections relating to

campaign contributions, on the
grounds that they violated First
Amendment guarantees of free speech.
He also announced that his cam
paign is bringing court actions chal
lenging election laws in 15 states, as
well as the federal law.
The independent candidate, who
gained prominence with his opposi
tion to the Vietnam war in the 1960s
and his unsuccessful campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination
in 1968, said his effort this year is not
aimed at being a "spoiler" candidate
taking Democratic votes away from
Jimmy Carter.

"What am I spoiling? What right
does Carter have to the nomination, or
Geral Ford? Whose is it, you know?"
McCarthy asked.
"If we are spoiling the Democratic
and Republican game of controlling
American politics, that would be a
very positive achievement," he said.
He criticized both major parties for
what he termed a "substantive failure
to deal with the critical problems of
our country and said he is running "to
give people something to voteforother
than Carter and Ford, something other
than the Republican and Democratic


Cooney


McCarthy
parties."
"There's no difference between
them (Carter and Ford) on defense pol
icy, as far as you could tell from the
second debate," McCarthy said. He
called for a debate on the wisdom of
increasing stockpiles of nuclear
weapons,the. advisability of develop
ing the Trident submarine and the sel
ling of fighter aircraft to foreign na
tions.
He also said there has been no real
debate on methods for curbing un
employment and ending waste of
natural resources.
After viewing the first two debates
between Ford and Carter, McCarthy

said he would "much rather watch the
World Series" than the third debate,
scheduled for tonight.
McCarthy criticized Carter for "pub
lic belligerency," saying Carter has in
dicated he would be tougher in foreign
policy than Ford if elected, that he
would, in McCarthy's words, "wage
economic warfare" by manipulating
foreign trade policies, that he would
better arm the National Guard and that
he would do nothing to weaken the
U.S. position in the Panama Canal
Zone.
Responding to a critical ad placed in
the New Republic and the Nation by
former McCarthy supporter Sam
Brown, who now supports Carter,

McCarthy said he had sent Brown ":J0
pieces of silver to remind him of cer
tain scriptural realities."
While Bown was correct, McCarthy
said, in pointing out that the McCarthy
candidacy in 1968 had opened up the
Democratic party, McCarthy said his
candidacy this year is aimed at "open
ing up the political process beyond the
Democratic and Republican parties."
Joss Cooney, American Independent
Party candidate for the 12th Congres
sional District, was at the McCarthy
press conference handing out McCar
thy literature.
However, McCarthy campaign aides
disavowed any knowledge of Cooney's
actions and statements.

McCarthy said he had sent Brown ":J0
pieces of silver to remind him of cer

While Bown was correct, McCarthy
said, in pointing out that the McCarthy
candidacy in 1968 had opened up the
Democratic party, McCarthy said his
candidacy this year is aimed at "open
ing up the political process beyond the
Democratic and Republican parties."
Joss Cooney, American Independent

Burlingame—"The first unconstitu
tional presidential election in this cen
tury" may take place next month, in
dependent presidential candidate
Eugene McCarthy warned in a San
Francisco airport press conference

yesterday.
Completing a visit to California
promoting his write-in candidacy,
McCarthy said state laws requiring
strict qualifications in order for candi
dates to appear on ballots, together
with the new federal election law re
stricting political donations to presi
dential candidates, constitute "dis
crimination against the right of the
people to have a reasonably free choice
in the presidential election."
McCarthy cited a U.S. Supreme
Court ruling nullifying several provi
sions of the federal election law, in
cluding some sections relating to

campaign contributions, on the
grounds that they violated First
Amendment guarantees of free speech.
He also announced that his cam
paign is bringing court actions chal
lenging election laws in 15 states, as
well as the federal law.
The independent candidate, who
gained prominence with his opposi
tion to the Vietnam war in the 1960s
and his unsuccessful campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination
in 1968, said his effort this year is not
aimed at being a "spoiler" candidate
taking Democratic votes away from
Jimmy Carter.

"What am I spoiling? What right
does Carter have to the nomination, or
Geral Ford? Whose is it, you know?"
McCarthy asked.
"If we are spoiling the Democratic
and Republican game of controlling
American politics, that would be a
very positive achievement," he said.
He criticized both major parties for
what he termed a "substantive failure
to deal with the critical problems of
our country and said he is running "to
give people something to voteforother
than Carter and Ford, something other
than the Republican and Democratic


Cooney


McCarthy
parties."
"There's no difference between
them (Carter and Ford) on defense pol
icy, as far as you could tell from the
second debate," McCarthy said. He
called for a debate on the wisdom of
increasing stockpiles of nuclear
weapons,the. advisability of develop
ing the Trident submarine and the sel
ling of fighter aircraft to foreign na
tions.
He also said there has been no real
debate on methods for curbing un
employment and ending waste of
natural resources.
After viewing the first two debates
between Ford and Carter, McCarthy

said he would "much rather watch the
World Series" than the third debate,
scheduled for tonight.
McCarthy criticized Carter for "pub
lic belligerency," saying Carter has in
dicated he would be tougher in foreign
policy than Ford if elected, that he
would, in McCarthy's words, "wage
economic warfare" by manipulating
foreign trade policies, that he would
better arm the National Guard and that
he would do nothing to weaken the
U.S. position in the Panama Canal
Zone.
