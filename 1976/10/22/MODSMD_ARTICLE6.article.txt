# No 'free choice' left for voters
## McCarthy challenges election laws 
### Jack Vaughn 
Burlingameâ€”"The first unconstitu
tional presidential election in this cen
tury" may take place next month, in
dependent presidential candidate
Eugene McCarthy warned in a San
Francisco airport press conference

yesterday.
Completing a visit to California
promoting his write-in candidacy,
McCarthy said state laws requiring
strict qualifications in order for candi
dates to appear on ballots, together
with the new federal election law re
stricting political donations to presi
dential candidates, constitute "dis
crimination against the right of the
people to have a reasonably free choice
in the presidential election."
McCarthy cited a U.S. Supreme
Court ruling nullifying several provi
sions of the federal election law, in
cluding some sections relating to

campaign contributions, on the
grounds that they violated First
Amendment guarantees of free speech.
He also announced that his cam
paign is bringing court actions chal
lenging election laws in 15 states, as
well as the federal law.
The independent candidate, who
gained prominence with his opposi
tion to the Vietnam war in the 1960s
and his unsuccessful campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination
in 1968, said his effort this year is not
aimed at being a "spoiler" candidate
taking Democratic votes away from
Jimmy Carter.

"What am I spoiling? What right
does Carter have to the nomination, or
Geral Ford? Whose is it, you know?"
McCarthy asked.
"If we are spoiling the Democratic
and Republican game of controlling
American politics, that would be a
very positive achievement," he said.
He criticized both major parties for
what he termed a "substantive failure
to deal with the critical problems of
our country and said he is running "to
give people something to voteforother
than Carter and Ford, something other
than the Republican and Democratic
