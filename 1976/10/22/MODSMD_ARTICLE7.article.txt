# Ford, Carter to debate for last timeâ€”a voter's guide on issues from taxes to oil
## 
### Laura Kennedy 
A few weeks ago, President Gerald
Lord said, "For too many days this
campaign has been mired in questions
that have little bearing upon the future
of this nation. The people of this coun
try deserve better than that. They de

serve a campaign that focuses on the
serious issues of our time. . .
One hopes Ford and his Democratic
counterpart, Jimmy Carter, will "focus

News analysis

on the serious issues" when they de
bate tonight in Williamsburg, Va.,
rather than trading personal jabs or
launching into vague sermons.
The topics discussed tonight will
probably include the following six
areas:
Government spending. Inflation is
the major issue according to most
polls, pundits, and pocketbooks, and
both candidates consider a reduction
in government spending to be one of
the chief solutions for inflation.
Ford vows to cut government spend
ing by continuing to veto bills from
what he sees as a spendthrift Democra
tic Congress. Ford points to the halv
ing of the inflation rate from 12 per
cent at the beginning of his administ
ration to six per cent now as proof that
his vetoes and his fiscal conservatism
in general have "whipped inflation
now."
He has already vetoed 59 bills (12 of
which were overridden), including
bills on such mom-and-apple-pie areas
as school lunch programs and day care
centers. While he claims these vetoes
have saved $9 billion. Carter coun
terclaims that the vetoes only saved $4
billion and the savings were out
weighed by increases in unemploy
ment compensation and welfare.
Bilious budgets
Carter's favorite cure for bilious
budgets (and perhaps his most original
difference from what would otherwise
be a fairly standard Democratic plat
form) is administrative reform and
reorganization.
Carter's claim to have saved $50
million as governor of Georgia by
streamlining 300 agencies into 22 has
been greatly overrated since only 65 of
the original agencies were actually
funded and operational. Also, the

Georgia state auditor, Ernest Davis, re
veals that Carter left one large agency
still hacking its way through what
Davis calls "total financial chaos."
Carter has been vague as to precisely
how he would reorganize the federal
government, even hedging on whether
he would cut any federal jobs. Instead,
he says, "1 would like to have complete
authorization to reorganize the execu
tive branch of government, giving me
as much authority as possible."
Consolidation of agencies
Specific improvements Carter has
recommended include a consolidation
of the numerous health and energy
agencies and "a greater reliance (by
government) upon long-range plan
ning and long-term budgets." He indi
cates that a reorganized and stream
lined government would not necessar
ily be smaller.
Ford, on the other hand, has said,
"We must not continue drifting in the
direction of bigger and bigger gov
ernment," and claims to have already
cut 11,000 employes from the federal
payroll.
Ford also criticizes Carter's plan to
reduce expenditure by hacking $5-$7
billion off the defense budget and
claims that Carter proposed a cut of
$15 billion in March 1975. Carter has
neither denied nor confirmed Ford's
charge.
Unemployment. Inflation and un
employment are intertwined evils for
the two candidates; however, Ford's
first priority is fighting inflation,
while Carter's priority is whittling
down unemployment. Hence, both
men call for an inflation-fighting ba
lanced budget by 1979, but Carter adds
that there must also be full employ
ment.
After some reluctance, Carter sup
ported the Humphrey-Hawkins bill
which requires that unemployment be
reduced to three per cent four years
after enactment. According to the bill,
if private enterprise does not provide
enough jobs to fulfill this goal, gov
ernment would make up the differ
ence.

Despite Carter's support of this bill,
and despite his plan for a doubling of
the number of workers in the Com
prehensive Employment and Training
Act program and a federal summer job
program for 80(3,000 youngsters, he
Still says. "Covernment should be the
employer of the last resort." Carter
emphasizes instead stimulation of pri
vate enterprise through such methods
as channeling research money into
job-producing areas like health, trans
portation, energy and housing, and (in
certain cases) partially subsidizing
private salaries.
'Election-year boondoggle'
Ford, like Carter, has said that "any
body who wants a job can have a job."
but sees government job programs as
too inflationary. For that reason, he
vetoed two public works bills and an
emergency employment appropria
tion. Me calls the Humphrey-Hawkins
bill "a vast, election-year boondoggle"
and in his fiscal 1977 budget plans to
slash the number of public service jobs
from the current level of 320,000 to
40,000.
Ford expects jobs will be created by
general economic growth and indirect
government policy: for example, tax
incentives for businessmen to invest in
new plants and equipment.
Taxes. Although Carter at one time
said he intended to "shift a substantial
increase toward those who have the
higher incomes." his latest statement
is, "1 would guess the tax rates would
be lowered throughout the entire
gamut of income."
Ford proposes a "tax reduction di
rected at business in a way that creates
more jobs." His suggestion to keep the
10 per cent investment tax credit (al
beit only until 1980) was incorporated
in the recently-passed tax bill, as was
another Ford idea of increasing the
personal exemption for estate taxes.
Ford wants to provide $10 billion in
tax cuts, directed particularly toward
families earning between $8000 and
$30,000 a year, by (among other
things) raising the individual personal
