# Ford, Carter to debate for last time—a voter's guide on issues from taxes to oil
## 
### Laura Kennedy 
A few weeks ago, President Gerald
Lord said, "For too many days this
campaign has been mired in questions
that have little bearing upon the future
of this nation. The people of this coun
try deserve better than that. They de

serve a campaign that focuses on the
serious issues of our time. . .
One hopes Ford and his Democratic
counterpart, Jimmy Carter, will "focus

News analysis

on the serious issues" when they de
bate tonight in Williamsburg, Va.,
rather than trading personal jabs or
launching into vague sermons.
The topics discussed tonight will
probably include the following six
areas:
Government spending. Inflation is
the major issue according to most
polls, pundits, and pocketbooks, and
both candidates consider a reduction
in government spending to be one of
the chief solutions for inflation.
Ford vows to cut government spend
ing by continuing to veto bills from
what he sees as a spendthrift Democra
tic Congress. Ford points to the halv
ing of the inflation rate from 12 per
cent at the beginning of his administ
ration to six per cent now as proof that
his vetoes and his fiscal conservatism
in general have "whipped inflation
now."
He has already vetoed 59 bills (12 of
which were overridden), including
bills on such mom-and-apple-pie areas
as school lunch programs and day care
centers. While he claims these vetoes
have saved $9 billion. Carter coun
terclaims that the vetoes only saved $4
billion and the savings were out
weighed by increases in unemploy
ment compensation and welfare.
Bilious budgets
Carter's favorite cure for bilious
budgets (and perhaps his most original
difference from what would otherwise
be a fairly standard Democratic plat
form) is administrative reform and
reorganization.
Carter's claim to have saved $50
million as governor of Georgia by
streamlining 300 agencies into 22 has
been greatly overrated since only 65 of
the original agencies were actually
funded and operational. Also, the

Georgia state auditor, Ernest Davis, re
veals that Carter left one large agency
still hacking its way through what
Davis calls "total financial chaos."
Carter has been vague as to precisely
how he would reorganize the federal
government, even hedging on whether
he would cut any federal jobs. Instead,
he says, "1 would like to have complete
authorization to reorganize the execu
tive branch of government, giving me
as much authority as possible."
Consolidation of agencies
Specific improvements Carter has
recommended include a consolidation
of the numerous health and energy
agencies and "a greater reliance (by
government) upon long-range plan
ning and long-term budgets." He indi
cates that a reorganized and stream
lined government would not necessar
ily be smaller.
Ford, on the other hand, has said,
"We must not continue drifting in the
direction of bigger and bigger gov
ernment," and claims to have already
cut 11,000 employes from the federal
payroll.
Ford also criticizes Carter's plan to
reduce expenditure by hacking $5-$7
billion off the defense budget and
claims that Carter proposed a cut of
$15 billion in March 1975. Carter has
neither denied nor confirmed Ford's
charge.
Unemployment. Inflation and un
employment are intertwined evils for
the two candidates; however, Ford's
first priority is fighting inflation,
while Carter's priority is whittling
down unemployment. Hence, both
men call for an inflation-fighting ba
lanced budget by 1979, but Carter adds
that there must also be full employ
ment.
After some reluctance, Carter sup
ported the Humphrey-Hawkins bill
which requires that unemployment be
reduced to three per cent four years
after enactment. According to the bill,
if private enterprise does not provide
enough jobs to fulfill this goal, gov
ernment would make up the differ
ence.

Despite Carter's support of this bill,
and despite his plan for a doubling of
the number of workers in the Com
prehensive Employment and Training
Act program and a federal summer job
program for 80(3,000 youngsters, he
Still says. "Covernment should be the
employer of the last resort." Carter
emphasizes instead stimulation of pri
vate enterprise through such methods
as channeling research money into
job-producing areas like health, trans
portation, energy and housing, and (in
certain cases) partially subsidizing
private salaries.
'Election-year boondoggle'
Ford, like Carter, has said that "any
body who wants a job can have a job."
but sees government job programs as
too inflationary. For that reason, he
vetoed two public works bills and an
emergency employment appropria
tion. Me calls the Humphrey-Hawkins
bill "a vast, election-year boondoggle"
and in his fiscal 1977 budget plans to
slash the number of public service jobs
from the current level of 320,000 to
40,000.
Ford expects jobs will be created by
general economic growth and indirect
government policy: for example, tax
incentives for businessmen to invest in
new plants and equipment.
Taxes. Although Carter at one time
said he intended to "shift a substantial
increase toward those who have the
higher incomes." his latest statement
is, "1 would guess the tax rates would
be lowered throughout the entire
gamut of income."
Ford proposes a "tax reduction di
rected at business in a way that creates
more jobs." His suggestion to keep the
10 per cent investment tax credit (al
beit only until 1980) was incorporated
in the recently-passed tax bill, as was
another Ford idea of increasing the
personal exemption for estate taxes.
Ford wants to provide $10 billion in
tax cuts, directed particularly toward
families earning between $8000 and
$30,000 a year, by (among other
things) raising the individual personal
exemption from $750 to $1000.
Ford has not always been so eager
for a tax cut. Early in his administra
tion, he considered a proposal from his
economic advisers for a $4.7 billion tax
increase coupled with a $4.6 billion
cut in federal spending, as the
economy was facing a serious slump.
Ford suddenly made what Press Sec
retary Ron Nessen called a "179-
degree turn," deciding it would be
politically expedient to agree to the
Democrats' $22.8 billion tax cut and
their government spending program.
Energy and the environment. Car
ter. although committed to full
employment, has said, "Whenever
there is a conflict between develop
ment and environmental quality . . . 1
would go with the environment."
Ford, on the other hand, says. "1 pur
sue the goal of clean air and water, but 1
must also pursue the objective of
maximum jobs and economic prog
ress."
Toward Ford's aim of prompting the
economy's growth through private en
terprise, he has urged that energy re
search and development come primar
ily from private business. He claims
his proposed Nuclear Fuel Assurance
Act and Nuclear Licensing Act would
make operating commercial nuclear
plants more feasible. He has also put
forward a plan for an Energy Indepen
dence Authority, a government corpo
ration to encourage private financing
of energy facilities and research and
development.
Ford and public research
Ford has not neglected government
supported research. His 1977 budget
asks for a 30 per cent increase in the
Energy Research and Development
Agency and a 63 per cent increase in
energy conservation research and de
velopment.
Nevertheless, Ford recently vetoed
as too expensive a bill for research on
the electric car. Also, in his 1977
budget, he cuts the Environmental
Protection Agency to $718 million —

$53 million more than Congress's 1976
appropriation and $77 million less
than his 1976 request.
Carter emphasizes energy conserva
tion in his energy plan (including
some mandatory measures) and find
ing methods to convert coal to a clean
alternative to oil. Despite Carter's
background as a nuclear engineer, he
advocates a cautious approach to

wards developing nuclear power. Un
like Ford. Carter does not support the
current move to lower air pollution
standards.
Crime. Ford has called for mandat
ory. minimum sentences for crimes
involving dangerous weapons, but is
"unalterably opposed" to gun registra
tion. However, he favors prohibiting
manufacture or sale of "Saturday night

specials" (cheap hand guns).
On the other hand. Carter favors re
gistration of hand guns, banning oj
"Saturday night specials" and prohib
ition of gun ownership by anyone con
victed of a crime involving a gun and
by those deemed mentally incompe
tent.
Carter also wants to set uniform sen
tences.
A few weeks ago, President Gerald
Lord said, "For too many days this
campaign has been mired in questions
that have little bearing upon the future
of this nation. The people of this coun
try deserve better than that. They de

beit only until 1980) was incorporated
in the recently-passed tax bill, as was
another Ford idea of increasing the
personal exemption for estate taxes.
Ford wants to provide $10 billion in
tax cuts, directed particularly toward
families earning between $8000 and
$30,000 a year, by (among other
things) raising the individual personal
exemption from $750 to $1000.
Ford has not always been so eager
for a tax cut. Early in his administra
tion, he considered a proposal from his
economic advisers for a $4.7 billion tax
increase coupled with a $4.6 billion
cut in federal spending, as the
economy was facing a serious slump.
Ford suddenly made what Press Sec
retary Ron Nessen called a "179-
degree turn," deciding it would be
politically expedient to agree to the
Democrats' $22.8 billion tax cut and
their government spending program.
Energy and the environment. Car
ter. although committed to full
employment, has said, "Whenever
there is a conflict between develop
ment and environmental quality . . . 1
would go with the environment."
Ford, on the other hand, says. "1 pur
sue the goal of clean air and water, but 1
must also pursue the objective of
maximum jobs and economic prog
ress."
Toward Ford's aim of prompting the
economy's growth through private en
terprise, he has urged that energy re
search and development come primar
ily from private business. He claims
his proposed Nuclear Fuel Assurance
Act and Nuclear Licensing Act would
make operating commercial nuclear
plants more feasible. He has also put
forward a plan for an Energy Indepen
dence Authority, a government corpo
ration to encourage private financing
of energy facilities and research and
development.
Ford and public research
Ford has not neglected government
supported research. His 1977 budget
asks for a 30 per cent increase in the
Energy Research and Development
Agency and a 63 per cent increase in
energy conservation research and de
velopment.
Nevertheless, Ford recently vetoed
as too expensive a bill for research on
the electric car. Also, in his 1977
budget, he cuts the Environmental
Protection Agency to $718 million —

$53 million more than Congress's 1976
appropriation and $77 million less
than his 1976 request.
Carter emphasizes energy conserva
tion in his energy plan (including
some mandatory measures) and find
ing methods to convert coal to a clean
alternative to oil. Despite Carter's
background as a nuclear engineer, he
advocates a cautious approach to

wards developing nuclear power. Un
like Ford. Carter does not support the
current move to lower air pollution
standards.
Crime. Ford has called for mandat
ory. minimum sentences for crimes
involving dangerous weapons, but is
"unalterably opposed" to gun registra
tion. However, he favors prohibiting
manufacture or sale of "Saturday night

specials" (cheap hand guns).
On the other hand. Carter favors re
gistration of hand guns, banning oj
"Saturday night specials" and prohib
ition of gun ownership by anyone con
victed of a crime involving a gun and
by those deemed mentally incompe
tent.
Carter also wants to set uniform sen
tences.
A few weeks ago, President Gerald
Lord said, "For too many days this
campaign has been mired in questions
that have little bearing upon the future
of this nation. The people of this coun
try deserve better than that. They de

serve a campaign that focuses on the
serious issues of our time. . .
One hopes Ford and his Democratic
counterpart, Jimmy Carter, will "focus

News analysis

on the serious issues" when they de
bate tonight in Williamsburg, Va.,
rather than trading personal jabs or
launching into vague sermons.
The topics discussed tonight will
probably include the following six
areas:
Government spending. Inflation is
the major issue according to most
polls, pundits, and pocketbooks, and
both candidates consider a reduction
in government spending to be one of
the chief solutions for inflation.
Ford vows to cut government spend
ing by continuing to veto bills from
what he sees as a spendthrift Democra
tic Congress. Ford points to the halv
ing of the inflation rate from 12 per
cent at the beginning of his administ
ration to six per cent now as proof that
his vetoes and his fiscal conservatism
in general have "whipped inflation
now."
He has already vetoed 59 bills (12 of
which were overridden), including
bills on such mom-and-apple-pie areas
as school lunch programs and day care
centers. While he claims these vetoes
have saved $9 billion. Carter coun
terclaims that the vetoes only saved $4
billion and the savings were out
weighed by increases in unemploy
ment compensation and welfare.
Bilious budgets
Carter's favorite cure for bilious
budgets (and perhaps his most original
difference from what would otherwise
be a fairly standard Democratic plat
form) is administrative reform and
reorganization.
Carter's claim to have saved $50
million as governor of Georgia by
streamlining 300 agencies into 22 has
been greatly overrated since only 65 of
the original agencies were actually
funded and operational. Also, the

Georgia state auditor, Ernest Davis, re
veals that Carter left one large agency
still hacking its way through what
Davis calls "total financial chaos."
Carter has been vague as to precisely
how he would reorganize the federal
government, even hedging on whether
he would cut any federal jobs. Instead,
he says, "1 would like to have complete
authorization to reorganize the execu
tive branch of government, giving me
as much authority as possible."
Consolidation of agencies
Specific improvements Carter has
recommended include a consolidation
of the numerous health and energy
agencies and "a greater reliance (by
government) upon long-range plan
ning and long-term budgets." He indi
cates that a reorganized and stream
lined government would not necessar
ily be smaller.
Ford, on the other hand, has said,
"We must not continue drifting in the
direction of bigger and bigger gov
ernment," and claims to have already
cut 11,000 employes from the federal
payroll.
Ford also criticizes Carter's plan to
reduce expenditure by hacking $5-$7
billion off the defense budget and
claims that Carter proposed a cut of
$15 billion in March 1975. Carter has
neither denied nor confirmed Ford's
charge.
Unemployment. Inflation and un
employment are intertwined evils for
the two candidates; however, Ford's
first priority is fighting inflation,
while Carter's priority is whittling
down unemployment. Hence, both
men call for an inflation-fighting ba
lanced budget by 1979, but Carter adds
that there must also be full employ
ment.
After some reluctance, Carter sup
ported the Humphrey-Hawkins bill
which requires that unemployment be
reduced to three per cent four years
after enactment. According to the bill,
if private enterprise does not provide
enough jobs to fulfill this goal, gov
ernment would make up the differ
ence.

Despite Carter's support of this bill,
and despite his plan for a doubling of
the number of workers in the Com
prehensive Employment and Training
Act program and a federal summer job
program for 80(3,000 youngsters, he
Still says. "Covernment should be the
employer of the last resort." Carter
emphasizes instead stimulation of pri
vate enterprise through such methods
as channeling research money into
job-producing areas like health, trans
portation, energy and housing, and (in
certain cases) partially subsidizing
private salaries.
'Election-year boondoggle'
Ford, like Carter, has said that "any
body who wants a job can have a job."
but sees government job programs as
too inflationary. For that reason, he
vetoed two public works bills and an
emergency employment appropria
tion. Me calls the Humphrey-Hawkins
bill "a vast, election-year boondoggle"
and in his fiscal 1977 budget plans to
slash the number of public service jobs
from the current level of 320,000 to
40,000.
Ford expects jobs will be created by
general economic growth and indirect
government policy: for example, tax
incentives for businessmen to invest in
new plants and equipment.
Taxes. Although Carter at one time
said he intended to "shift a substantial
increase toward those who have the
higher incomes." his latest statement
is, "1 would guess the tax rates would
be lowered throughout the entire
gamut of income."
Ford proposes a "tax reduction di
rected at business in a way that creates
more jobs." His suggestion to keep the
10 per cent investment tax credit (al
beit only until 1980) was incorporated
in the recently-passed tax bill, as was

personal exemption for estate taxes.

he says, "1 would like to have complete
authorization to reorganize the execu
tive branch of government, giving me
as much authority as possible."
Consolidation of agencies
Specific improvements Carter has
recommended include a consolidation
of the numerous health and energy
agencies and "a greater reliance (by
government) upon long-range plan
ning and long-term budgets." He indi
cates that a reorganized and stream
lined government would not necessar
ily be smaller.
Ford, on the other hand, has said,
"We must not continue drifting in the
direction of bigger and bigger gov
ernment," and claims to have already
cut 11,000 employes from the federal
payroll.
Ford also criticizes Carter's plan to
reduce expenditure by hacking $5-$7
billion off the defense budget and
claims that Carter proposed a cut of
$15 billion in March 1975. Carter has
neither denied nor confirmed Ford's
charge.
Unemployment. Inflation and un
employment are intertwined evils for
the two candidates; however, Ford's
first priority is fighting inflation,
while Carter's priority is whittling
down unemployment. Hence, both
men call for an inflation-fighting ba
lanced budget by 1979, but Carter adds
that there must also be full employ
ment.
After some reluctance, Carter sup
ported the Humphrey-Hawkins bill
which requires that unemployment be
reduced to three per cent four years
after enactment. According to the bill,
if private enterprise does not provide
enough jobs to fulfill this goal, gov
ernment would make up the differ
ence.

Despite Carter's support of this bill,
and despite his plan for a doubling of
the number of workers in the Com
prehensive Employment and Training
Act program and a federal summer job
program for 80(3,000 youngsters, he
Still says. "Covernment should be the
employer of the last resort." Carter
emphasizes instead stimulation of pri
vate enterprise through such methods
as channeling research money into
job-producing areas like health, trans
portation, energy and housing, and (in
certain cases) partially subsidizing
private salaries.
'Election-year boondoggle'
Ford, like Carter, has said that "any
body who wants a job can have a job."
but sees government job programs as
too inflationary. For that reason, he
vetoed two public works bills and an
emergency employment appropria
tion. Me calls the Humphrey-Hawkins
bill "a vast, election-year boondoggle"
and in his fiscal 1977 budget plans to
slash the number of public service jobs
from the current level of 320,000 to
40,000.
Ford expects jobs will be created by
general economic growth and indirect
government policy: for example, tax
incentives for businessmen to invest in
new plants and equipment.
Taxes. Although Carter at one time
said he intended to "shift a substantial
increase toward those who have the
higher incomes." his latest statement
is, "1 would guess the tax rates would
be lowered throughout the entire
gamut of income."
Ford proposes a "tax reduction di
rected at business in a way that creates
more jobs." His suggestion to keep the
10 per cent investment tax credit (al
beit only until 1980) was incorporated
in the recently-passed tax bill, as was
another Ford idea of increasing the
personal exemption for estate taxes.
Ford wants to provide $10 billion in
tax cuts, directed particularly toward
families earning between $8000 and
$30,000 a year, by (among other
things) raising the individual personal
exemption from $750 to $1000.
Ford has not always been so eager
for a tax cut. Early in his administra
tion, he considered a proposal from his
economic advisers for a $4.7 billion tax
increase coupled with a $4.6 billion
cut in federal spending, as the
economy was facing a serious slump.
Ford suddenly made what Press Sec
retary Ron Nessen called a "179-
degree turn," deciding it would be
politically expedient to agree to the
Democrats' $22.8 billion tax cut and
their government spending program.
Energy and the environment. Car
ter. although committed to full
employment, has said, "Whenever
there is a conflict between develop
ment and environmental quality . . . 1
would go with the environment."
Ford, on the other hand, says. "1 pur
sue the goal of clean air and water, but 1
must also pursue the objective of
maximum jobs and economic prog
ress."
Toward Ford's aim of prompting the
economy's growth through private en
terprise, he has urged that energy re
search and development come primar
ily from private business. He claims
his proposed Nuclear Fuel Assurance
Act and Nuclear Licensing Act would
make operating commercial nuclear
plants more feasible. He has also put
forward a plan for an Energy Indepen
dence Authority, a government corpo
ration to encourage private financing
of energy facilities and research and
development.
Ford and public research
Ford has not neglected government
supported research. His 1977 budget
asks for a 30 per cent increase in the
Energy Research and Development
Agency and a 63 per cent increase in
energy conservation research and de
velopment.
Nevertheless, Ford recently vetoed
as too expensive a bill for research on
the electric car. Also, in his 1977
budget, he cuts the Environmental
Protection Agency to $718 million —

$53 million more than Congress's 1976
appropriation and $77 million less
than his 1976 request.
Carter emphasizes energy conserva
tion in his energy plan (including
some mandatory measures) and find
ing methods to convert coal to a clean
alternative to oil. Despite Carter's
background as a nuclear engineer, he
advocates a cautious approach to

wards developing nuclear power. Un
like Ford. Carter does not support the
current move to lower air pollution
standards.
Crime. Ford has called for mandat
ory. minimum sentences for crimes
involving dangerous weapons, but is
"unalterably opposed" to gun registra
tion. However, he favors prohibiting
manufacture or sale of "Saturday night

specials" (cheap hand guns).
On the other hand. Carter favors re
gistration of hand guns, banning oj
"Saturday night specials" and prohib
ition of gun ownership by anyone con
victed of a crime involving a gun and
by those deemed mentally incompe
tent.
Carter also wants to set uniform sen
tences.
A few weeks ago, President Gerald
Lord said, "For too many days this
campaign has been mired in questions
that have little bearing upon the future
of this nation. The people of this coun
try deserve better than that. They de

serve a campaign that focuses on the
serious issues of our time. . .
One hopes Ford and his Democratic
counterpart, Jimmy Carter, will "focus

News analysis

on the serious issues" when they de
bate tonight in Williamsburg, Va.,
rather than trading personal jabs or
launching into vague sermons.
The topics discussed tonight will
probably include the following six
areas:
Government spending. Inflation is
the major issue according to most
polls, pundits, and pocketbooks, and
both candidates consider a reduction
in government spending to be one of
the chief solutions for inflation.
Ford vows to cut government spend
ing by continuing to veto bills from
what he sees as a spendthrift Democra
tic Congress. Ford points to the halv
ing of the inflation rate from 12 per
cent at the beginning of his administ
ration to six per cent now as proof that
his vetoes and his fiscal conservatism
in general have "whipped inflation
now."
He has already vetoed 59 bills (12 of
which were overridden), including
bills on such mom-and-apple-pie areas
as school lunch programs and day care
centers. While he claims these vetoes
have saved $9 billion. Carter coun
terclaims that the vetoes only saved $4
billion and the savings were out
weighed by increases in unemploy
ment compensation and welfare.
Bilious budgets
Carter's favorite cure for bilious
budgets (and perhaps his most original
difference from what would otherwise
be a fairly standard Democratic plat
form) is administrative reform and
reorganization.
Carter's claim to have saved $50
million as governor of Georgia by
streamlining 300 agencies into 22 has
been greatly overrated since only 65 of
the original agencies were actually
funded and operational. Also, the

Georgia state auditor, Ernest Davis, re
veals that Carter left one large agency
still hacking its way through what
Davis calls "total financial chaos."
Carter has been vague as to precisely
how he would reorganize the federal
government, even hedging on whether
he would cut any federal jobs. Instead,
he says, "1 would like to have complete
authorization to reorganize the execu
tive branch of government, giving me
as much authority as possible."
Consolidation of agencies
Specific improvements Carter has
recommended include a consolidation
of the numerous health and energy
agencies and "a greater reliance (by

payroll.

than his 1976 request.
Carter emphasizes energy conserva

some mandatory measures) and find

alternative to oil. Despite Carter's
background as a nuclear engineer, he
advocates a cautious approach to

like Ford. Carter does not support the
current move to lower air pollution

Crime. Ford has called for mandat
ory. minimum sentences for crimes
involving dangerous weapons, but is
"unalterably opposed" to gun registra
tion. However, he favors prohibiting
manufacture or sale of "Saturday night

specials" (cheap hand guns).
On the other hand. Carter favors re

A few weeks ago, President Gerald
Lord said, "For too many days this
campaign has been mired in questions
that have little bearing upon the future
of this nation. The people of this coun
try deserve better than that. They de

serve a campaign that focuses on the
serious issues of our time. . .
One hopes Ford and his Democratic
counterpart, Jimmy Carter, will "focus

News analysis

on the serious issues" when they de
bate tonight in Williamsburg, Va.,
rather than trading personal jabs or
launching into vague sermons.
The topics discussed tonight will
probably include the following six
areas:
Government spending. Inflation is
the major issue according to most
polls, pundits, and pocketbooks, and
both candidates consider a reduction
in government spending to be one of
the chief solutions for inflation.
Ford vows to cut government spend
ing by continuing to veto bills from
what he sees as a spendthrift Democra
tic Congress. Ford points to the halv
ing of the inflation rate from 12 per
cent at the beginning of his administ
ration to six per cent now as proof that
his vetoes and his fiscal conservatism
in general have "whipped inflation
now."
He has already vetoed 59 bills (12 of
which were overridden), including
bills on such mom-and-apple-pie areas
as school lunch programs and day care
centers. While he claims these vetoes
have saved $9 billion. Carter coun
terclaims that the vetoes only saved $4
billion and the savings were out
weighed by increases in unemploy
ment compensation and welfare.
Bilious budgets
Carter's favorite cure for bilious
budgets (and perhaps his most original
difference from what would otherwise
be a fairly standard Democratic plat
form) is administrative reform and
reorganization.
Carter's claim to have saved $50
million as governor of Georgia by
streamlining 300 agencies into 22 has
been greatly overrated since only 65 of
the original agencies were actually
funded and operational. Also, the

Georgia state auditor, Ernest Davis, re
veals that Carter left one large agency
still hacking its way through what
Davis calls "total financial chaos."
Carter has been vague as to precisely
how he would reorganize the federal
government, even hedging on whether
he would cut any federal jobs. Instead,
he says, "1 would like to have complete
authorization to reorganize the execu
tive branch of government, giving me
as much authority as possible."
Consolidation of agencies
Specific improvements Carter has
recommended include a consolidation
of the numerous health and energy
agencies and "a greater reliance (by
government) upon long-range plan
ning and long-term budgets." He indi
cates that a reorganized and stream
lined government would not necessar
ily be smaller.
Ford, on the other hand, has said,
"We must not continue drifting in the
direction of bigger and bigger gov
ernment," and claims to have already
cut 11,000 employes from the federal
payroll.
Ford also criticizes Carter's plan to
reduce expenditure by hacking $5-$7
billion off the defense budget and
claims that Carter proposed a cut of
$15 billion in March 1975. Carter has
neither denied nor confirmed Ford's
charge.
Unemployment. Inflation and un
employment are intertwined evils for
the two candidates; however, Ford's
first priority is fighting inflation,
while Carter's priority is whittling
down unemployment. Hence, both
men call for an inflation-fighting ba
lanced budget by 1979, but Carter adds
that there must also be full employ
ment.
After some reluctance, Carter sup
ported the Humphrey-Hawkins bill
which requires that unemployment be
reduced to three per cent four years
after enactment. According to the bill,
if private enterprise does not provide
enough jobs to fulfill this goal, gov
ernment would make up the differ
ence.

Despite Carter's support of this bill,
and despite his plan for a doubling of
the number of workers in the Com
prehensive Employment and Training
Act program and a federal summer job
program for 80(3,000 youngsters, he
Still says. "Covernment should be the
employer of the last resort." Carter
emphasizes instead stimulation of pri
vate enterprise through such methods
as channeling research money into
job-producing areas like health, trans
portation, energy and housing, and (in
certain cases) partially subsidizing
private salaries.
'Election-year boondoggle'
Ford, like Carter, has said that "any
body who wants a job can have a job."
but sees government job programs as
too inflationary. For that reason, he
vetoed two public works bills and an
emergency employment appropria
tion. Me calls the Humphrey-Hawkins
bill "a vast, election-year boondoggle"
and in his fiscal 1977 budget plans to
slash the number of public service jobs
from the current level of 320,000 to
40,000.
Ford expects jobs will be created by
general economic growth and indirect
government policy: for example, tax
incentives for businessmen to invest in
new plants and equipment.
Taxes. Although Carter at one time
said he intended to "shift a substantial
increase toward those who have the
higher incomes." his latest statement
is, "1 would guess the tax rates would
be lowered throughout the entire
gamut of income."
Ford proposes a "tax reduction di
rected at business in a way that creates
more jobs." His suggestion to keep the
10 per cent investment tax credit (al
beit only until 1980) was incorporated
in the recently-passed tax bill, as was
another Ford idea of increasing the
personal exemption for estate taxes.
Ford wants to provide $10 billion in
tax cuts, directed particularly toward
families earning between $8000 and
$30,000 a year, by (among other
things) raising the individual personal
exemption from $750 to $1000.
Ford has not always been so eager
for a tax cut. Early in his administra
tion, he considered a proposal from his
economic advisers for a $4.7 billion tax
increase coupled with a $4.6 billion
cut in federal spending, as the
economy was facing a serious slump.
Ford suddenly made what Press Sec
retary Ron Nessen called a "179-
degree turn," deciding it would be
politically expedient to agree to the
Democrats' $22.8 billion tax cut and
their government spending program.
Energy and the environment. Car
ter. although committed to full
employment, has said, "Whenever
there is a conflict between develop
ment and environmental quality . . . 1
would go with the environment."
Ford, on the other hand, says. "1 pur
sue the goal of clean air and water, but 1
must also pursue the objective of
maximum jobs and economic prog
ress."
Toward Ford's aim of prompting the
economy's growth through private en
terprise, he has urged that energy re
search and development come primar
ily from private business. He claims
his proposed Nuclear Fuel Assurance
Act and Nuclear Licensing Act would
make operating commercial nuclear
plants more feasible. He has also put
forward a plan for an Energy Indepen
dence Authority, a government corpo
ration to encourage private financing
of energy facilities and research and
development.
Ford and public research
Ford has not neglected government
supported research. His 1977 budget
asks for a 30 per cent increase in the
Energy Research and Development
Agency and a 63 per cent increase in
energy conservation research and de
velopment.
Nevertheless, Ford recently vetoed
as too expensive a bill for research on
the electric car. Also, in his 1977
budget, he cuts the Environmental
Protection Agency to $718 million —

$53 million more than Congress's 1976
appropriation and $77 million less
than his 1976 request.
Carter emphasizes energy conserva
tion in his energy plan (including
some mandatory measures) and find
ing methods to convert coal to a clean
alternative to oil. Despite Carter's
background as a nuclear engineer, he
advocates a cautious approach to

wards developing nuclear power. Un

current move to lower air pollution
standards.

ory. minimum sentences for crimes
involving dangerous weapons, but is
"unalterably opposed" to gun registra
tion. However, he favors prohibiting
manufacture or sale of "Saturday night

On the other hand. Carter favors re

vetoed two public works bills and an
emergency employment appropria
tion. Me calls the Humphrey-Hawkins
bill "a vast, election-year boondoggle"
and in his fiscal 1977 budget plans to
slash the number of public service jobs
from the current level of 320,000 to
40,000.
Ford expects jobs will be created by
general economic growth and indirect
government policy: for example, tax
incentives for businessmen to invest in
new plants and equipment.
Taxes. Although Carter at one time
said he intended to "shift a substantial
increase toward those who have the
higher incomes." his latest statement
is, "1 would guess the tax rates would
be lowered throughout the entire
gamut of income."
Ford proposes a "tax reduction di
rected at business in a way that creates
more jobs." His suggestion to keep the
10 per cent investment tax credit (al
beit only until 1980) was incorporated
in the recently-passed tax bill, as was
another Ford idea of increasing the
personal exemption for estate taxes.
Ford wants to provide $10 billion in
tax cuts, directed particularly toward
families earning between $8000 and
$30,000 a year, by (among other
things) raising the individual personal
exemption from $750 to $1000.
Ford has not always been so eager
for a tax cut. Early in his administra
tion, he considered a proposal from his
economic advisers for a $4.7 billion tax
increase coupled with a $4.6 billion
cut in federal spending, as the
economy was facing a serious slump.
Ford suddenly made what Press Sec
retary Ron Nessen called a "179-
degree turn," deciding it would be
politically expedient to agree to the
Democrats' $22.8 billion tax cut and
their government spending program.
Energy and the environment. Car
ter. although committed to full
employment, has said, "Whenever
there is a conflict between develop
ment and environmental quality . . . 1
would go with the environment."
Ford, on the other hand, says. "1 pur
sue the goal of clean air and water, but 1
must also pursue the objective of
maximum jobs and economic prog
ress."
Toward Ford's aim of prompting the
economy's growth through private en
terprise, he has urged that energy re
search and development come primar
ily from private business. He claims
his proposed Nuclear Fuel Assurance
Act and Nuclear Licensing Act would
make operating commercial nuclear
plants more feasible. He has also put
forward a plan for an Energy Indepen
dence Authority, a government corpo
ration to encourage private financing
of energy facilities and research and
development.
Ford and public research
Ford has not neglected government
supported research. His 1977 budget
asks for a 30 per cent increase in the
Energy Research and Development
Agency and a 63 per cent increase in
energy conservation research and de
velopment.
Nevertheless, Ford recently vetoed
as too expensive a bill for research on
the electric car. Also, in his 1977
budget, he cuts the Environmental
Protection Agency to $718 million —

$53 million more than Congress's 1976
appropriation and $77 million less
than his 1976 request.
Carter emphasizes energy conserva
tion in his energy plan (including
some mandatory measures) and find
ing methods to convert coal to a clean
alternative to oil. Despite Carter's
background as a nuclear engineer, he
advocates a cautious approach to

wards developing nuclear power. Un
like Ford. Carter does not support the
current move to lower air pollution
standards.
Crime. Ford has called for mandat
ory. minimum sentences for crimes
involving dangerous weapons, but is
"unalterably opposed" to gun registra
tion. However, he favors prohibiting
manufacture or sale of "Saturday night

specials" (cheap hand guns).
On the other hand. Carter favors re
gistration of hand guns, banning oj
"Saturday night specials" and prohib
ition of gun ownership by anyone con
victed of a crime involving a gun and
by those deemed mentally incompe
tent.
Carter also wants to set uniform sen
tences.
