## 'Daily' ad policy 
### 
In Wednesday's Daily appeared an ad placed by Gallo Wine
Company. The decision to accept this ad and others was not an
easy one.
Many members of our community have the deepest personal
and political involvement with the issues evoked by Gallo sales.
The Daily has, in the past, editorialized against Gallo and sup
ported various boycotts against the company. Some would ar
gue, therefore, that the Daily should not violate its social con
sciousness by accepting Gallo ads. However, my position as
editor creates in me a duty to abide by the Daily's ad policy.
This policy states that the Daily will refuse to publish ads
whose content tends to incite to violence, is obscene or libelous,
or casts aspersions on individuals or groups because of race,
religion, sex, sexual preference, national origin, age or physical
disability.
If the advertiser discriminates in hiring on any of these bases,
we will not publish further ads from the advertiser if a member of
the community calls our attention to the fact and gives sufficient
evidence.
Under the present policy, I can find no reason to ban Gallo ads.
This is as far as we delve into the internal policies and prac
tices of our advertisers. Perhaps we should go further; perhaps
we should ignore their internal actions altogether.
The Daily Board of Directors will be reconsidering the entire
issue at its meeting Tuesday. We welcome written comments
from the community on this issue. Please limit comments to
these specific questions: How far should the Daily inquire into
the internal workings of its advertisers? What criteria should be
used for banning an advertiser? How should the Daily's policy
be enforced?
In the meantime, we continue to operate with the compromise
reached last year after months of painstaking effort. We will offer
counter-advertising to interested groups on the same page and at
the same rate as Gallo ads. Perhaps the thousands of persons who
registered at the "Yes on 14" tables could contribute a small sum
each to such an effort. Those interested in placing responsive ads
should contact Newell LaVoy, our business manager, at 497-
2554.
Our opinions page is also an excellent vehicle for reflecting
the diverse views of the community. Those who have opposed
Gallo have, in the recent past, unfortunately been not so vocifer
ous as the pro-Gallo forces. We trust this will change, especially
as election day for Prop. 14 approaches.
We consider the Gallo issue a live one. For the future, a
thoughtful advertising policy will still be needed. This can only
be accomplished if dissatisfied members of the community make
their views known.

Many members of our community have the deepest personal
and political involvement with the issues evoked by Gallo sales.
The Daily has, in the past, editorialized against Gallo and sup
ported various boycotts against the company. Some would ar
gue, therefore, that the Daily should not violate its social con
sciousness by accepting Gallo ads. However, my position as
editor creates in me a duty to abide by the Daily's ad policy.
This policy states that the Daily will refuse to publish ads
whose content tends to incite to violence, is obscene or libelous,
or casts aspersions on individuals or groups because of race,
religion, sex, sexual preference, national origin, age or physical
disability.
If the advertiser discriminates in hiring on any of these bases,
we will not publish further ads from the advertiser if a member of
the community calls our attention to the fact and gives sufficient
evidence.
Under the present policy, I can find no reason to ban Gallo ads.
This is as far as we delve into the internal policies and prac
tices of our advertisers. Perhaps we should go further; perhaps
we should ignore their internal actions altogether.
The Daily Board of Directors will be reconsidering the entire
issue at its meeting Tuesday. We welcome written comments
from the community on this issue. Please limit comments to
these specific questions: How far should the Daily inquire into
the internal workings of its advertisers? What criteria should be
used for banning an advertiser? How should the Daily's policy
be enforced?
In the meantime, we continue to operate with the compromise
reached last year after months of painstaking effort. We will offer
counter-advertising to interested groups on the same page and at
the same rate as Gallo ads. Perhaps the thousands of persons who
registered at the "Yes on 14" tables could contribute a small sum
each to such an effort. Those interested in placing responsive ads
should contact Newell LaVoy, our business manager, at 497-
2554.
Our opinions page is also an excellent vehicle for reflecting
the diverse views of the community. Those who have opposed
Gallo have, in the recent past, unfortunately been not so vocifer
ous as the pro-Gallo forces. We trust this will change, especially
as election day for Prop. 14 approaches.
We consider the Gallo issue a live one. For the future, a
thoughtful advertising policy will still be needed. This can only
be accomplished if dissatisfied members of the community make
their views known.

In Wednesday's Daily appeared an ad placed by Gallo Wine
Company. The decision to accept this ad and others was not an
easy one.
