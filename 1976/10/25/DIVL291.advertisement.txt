"Twelve novelists, some well known, some deserving a wider readership, discuss
their real and fictional worlds, careers, influences, work habits and the special agonies
I and joys of writing in these thoroughly candid and enjoyable interviews. Tooker and
Hofheins, who have clearly done their homework, draw out Wallace Stegner, Jessamyn
West, Herbert Gold, Kay Boyle, Evan S. Connell, Jr. and the others in talk that is free
flowing, articulate, full of true observations on writers and writing. The novelists run
the gamut in genres and styles, all the way from fantasy (Peter Beagle) to comedy
(James Leigh) and historical fiction (Janet Lewis). Each interview is supplemented by a
photo of the novelist, a capsule biography, a word picture of the writer at home and a
bibliography." • —Publishers Weekly
"A fresh, revealing, continually interesting insight into the creative process."
