# Vietnam, U.S. to open talks
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” Vietnam has
accepted a United States proposal
aimed at opening discussions on nor
malizing relations between the two
countries, Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger said yesterday.
Kissinger confirmed Vietnam's ac
ceptance to reporters after appearing
on CBS's Face The Nation. He gave no
further details.
In Paris, Vietnamese officials said
they have agreed to meet "for an ex
change of views on problems of in
terest to each side." They did not indi
cate when or where the meeting would
be held.
The United States and Vietnam have
been exchanging messages through
their respective embassies in Paris for
the past six months.
An American official said the Un
ited States wants to hold preliminary
talks with the Vietnamese "to test the
waters" before committing itself to
hard bargaining.
"We want to talk about talks," he
said.
The chief American objective is a
full accounting of Americans still
listed as missing in action in Vietnam.
Ilanoi is seeking war reconstruction
aid which the United States pledged in
the Paris peace agreement of January
1973.
U.S. officials say that massive Viet
namese violations of the agreement
preclude American assistance.
Moreover, there is virtually no sen
timent in Congress for granting aid to
Vietnam.
In his television appearance, Kis
singer took issue with several posi
tions outlined by Democratic presi
dential nominee Jimmy Carter.
The secretary said the independence
and non-alignment of Yugoslavia is a
"major American interest" and ques
tioned Carter's statement that Yugos
lavia lies outside the American de
fense perimeter.
Kissinger said that all Republican
and Democratic presidents in the
post-World War II era have considered
the independence of Yugoslavia an
important objective.
