It may be a cliche to liken society to a pendulum,
which swings from one extreme to another, but
cliches are generally based on truths, even if over
simplified.
A recent example of society-as-pendulum is de
monstrated by America's past three decades.
The '50s, '60s and '70s represent the extremes.
The '50s made complacency into a national pas
time. The '60s shook America from its deceptive
American Dream, but now, in the '70s, the Dream is
settling down once again upon the American mind,
welcomed by a weary citizenry which seeks its
fraudulent reassurance.
Most college students of 1976 do not remember
the decade of the '50s. Therefore, the current nos
talgia of older adults for the '50s has no sentimen
tally personal meaning for the college age popula
tion.
Wholesome character
It is easy to like Fonzie or LaVerne and Shirley.
They seem so silly, so innocent, so wholesome. But
the decade from which these characters are drawn
was anything but wholesome.
The view of the '50s from the safe distance of the
'70s is that there was peace then, security, respect
for the respectable, and patriotism. People, espe
cially the young, were basically "decent" and
"regular," even if they wore tight leather jackets
like Fonzie. Life was good, and there were few
problems.
But the '50s was also a time of bigotry, turmoil,
fear and deceit.

In the '50s, a junior senator from Wisconsin
wielded enough power to ruin the careers of any
persons he labeled "Commie," even if the charge
was false.
'I like Ike'
in the '50s, "I Like Ike" was the slogan which
elected a World War II general to the White House,
with his running mate, Dick Nixon. It was at this
time that Nixon first encountered the presidential
privilege and power which he was later to abuse to
the country's detriment.
In the '50s, blacks were shoeshine boys, porters,
athletes, entertainers, hookers.
Latinos were the Cisco Kid and Pancho.
Japs were deserving victims of the Atomic Bomb.
Chinese were inscrutable people whose food
made you hungry an hour later.
Breeders and cleaners
Women were breeders and cleaners, rightfully
demoted from the jobs they had held while the men
were away at the war.
There was little welfare in those days. People
were lazy then, not hungry or medically needy or
unemployable.
Farm surpluses rotted in the silos, as politicians
of the decade were proudly eager to point out.
For other countries with poor populations—well,
that was their problem. God, in the fifties, helped
those who helped themselves.
Lost in admiration
Yet, today many Americans are lost in admira
tion for the "peaceable kingdom" of the fifties, dur

ing which there was a war in Korea, a "cold war" of
threats and counter threats between atomic super
powers, civil defense drills, backyard bomb shel
ters and advisers sent to Vietnam.
Above all. the decade of the '50s was one of pre
tense. Everyone was expected to cooperate with the
American Dream, which allowed no minority prob
lems, no questioning of authority, no repudiation of
materialistic values.
Those who criticized the excesses of free enter
prise, and they were few, were easily written off as
"unAmerican." Those who grew rich from corpo
rate profits were better citizens for it. The poor
remained poor because they refused to help them
selves.
Life was simple 20 years ago. One ignored the
problems, and accepted the ready-made
philosophies offered by the government, the
schools, the clergy.
Dream life
The American Dream was precisely what its
name implies — a dream, a fantasy. It left no room
for nuances, subtleties, ambiguities.
Dick Nixon was good, Alger Hiss was bad. White
was good, non-white was bad. Conformity was
good,independent thought was bad.
Life was easier in the '50s. At least, it was easier
for some.

Lost in admiration
Yet, today many Americans are lost in admira
tion for the "peaceable kingdom" of the fifties, dur

ing which there was a war in Korea, a "cold war" of
threats and counter threats between atomic super
powers, civil defense drills, backyard bomb shel
ters and advisers sent to Vietnam.
Above all. the decade of the '50s was one of pre
tense. Everyone was expected to cooperate with the
American Dream, which allowed no minority prob
lems, no questioning of authority, no repudiation of
materialistic values.
Those who criticized the excesses of free enter
prise, and they were few, were easily written off as
"unAmerican." Those who grew rich from corpo
rate profits were better citizens for it. The poor
remained poor because they refused to help them
selves.
Life was simple 20 years ago. One ignored the
problems, and accepted the ready-made
philosophies offered by the government, the
schools, the clergy.
Dream life
The American Dream was precisely what its
name implies — a dream, a fantasy. It left no room
for nuances, subtleties, ambiguities.
Dick Nixon was good, Alger Hiss was bad. White
was good, non-white was bad. Conformity was
good,independent thought was bad.
Life was easier in the '50s. At least, it was easier
for some.

It may be a cliche to liken society to a pendulum,
which swings from one extreme to another, but
cliches are generally based on truths, even if over
simplified.
A recent example of society-as-pendulum is de
monstrated by America's past three decades.
The '50s, '60s and '70s represent the extremes.
The '50s made complacency into a national pas
time. The '60s shook America from its deceptive
American Dream, but now, in the '70s, the Dream is
settling down once again upon the American mind,
welcomed by a weary citizenry which seeks its
fraudulent reassurance.
Most college students of 1976 do not remember
the decade of the '50s. Therefore, the current nos
talgia of older adults for the '50s has no sentimen
tally personal meaning for the college age popula
tion.
Wholesome character
It is easy to like Fonzie or LaVerne and Shirley.
They seem so silly, so innocent, so wholesome. But
the decade from which these characters are drawn
was anything but wholesome.
The view of the '50s from the safe distance of the
'70s is that there was peace then, security, respect
for the respectable, and patriotism. People, espe
cially the young, were basically "decent" and
"regular," even if they wore tight leather jackets
like Fonzie. Life was good, and there were few
problems.
But the '50s was also a time of bigotry, turmoil,
fear and deceit.

In the '50s, a junior senator from Wisconsin
wielded enough power to ruin the careers of any
persons he labeled "Commie," even if the charge
was false.
'I like Ike'
in the '50s, "I Like Ike" was the slogan which
elected a World War II general to the White House,
with his running mate, Dick Nixon. It was at this
time that Nixon first encountered the presidential
privilege and power which he was later to abuse to
the country's detriment.
In the '50s, blacks were shoeshine boys, porters,
athletes, entertainers, hookers.
Latinos were the Cisco Kid and Pancho.
Japs were deserving victims of the Atomic Bomb.
Chinese were inscrutable people whose food
made you hungry an hour later.
Breeders and cleaners
Women were breeders and cleaners, rightfully
demoted from the jobs they had held while the men
were away at the war.
There was little welfare in those days. People
were lazy then, not hungry or medically needy or
unemployable.
Farm surpluses rotted in the silos, as politicians
of the decade were proudly eager to point out.
For other countries with poor populations—well,
that was their problem. God, in the fifties, helped
those who helped themselves.
