# No justification for not voting

It is time to get off our asses. Liber
als, progressives — whatever we call
ourselves these days — it is time to
realize that events are such in this
dismal and uninspiring presidential
election that we can no longer afford
to sit back and hope that Carter stum
bles through.
It is time to speak out, to let it be said
that, as submerged as they may be,
there are issues at stake in this elec
tion and, yes, it does matter who wins!
We must move the debate beyond
the focus on personality which pere

nially afflicts the American political
process. Ford is not a bad president
because he bumps his head or because
he sometimes says he is in Pontiac
when he is in Lincoln.
Ford is a bad president because he
has presided over an administration
totally devoid of initiatives in the
major problem areas confronting us.
Recent progress in the areas of un
employment, health, energy, envi
ronment, and transportation has
been in spite of, not because of, the
Ford administration.
I jttle difference
This administration has departed
little from the Nixon administration in
its approach to defense spending,
foreign policy, and management of
the economy. Are the policies in these
areas now more tolerable because
P'ord is a nice guy whereas Nixon was
not?
Will Carter be any improvement is
the question. Even though he does not
have a long track record, and even
though I value the permanence of his
stated positions only a little more than
does Dole, I am confident that a Carter
administration would be capable of
significant progress in many areas
where little could be hoped for under
Ford.
This can be said on the basis of the
advisers Carter is likely to surround
himself with, and on the basis of the
mainstream of opinion within his
pa rty by which he will be const rained.
Under Carter we could expect ad
vances in health and environmental
issues. We could expect a reduction in
unemployment. I would be less san
guine about significant departures
from current policy in the areas of de
fense spending, foreign policy, and
income redistribution. Rut even in
areas such as these, I believe the op
portunities for moving the Carter ad
ministration would be greater than
under Ford.
Running mates
If one needs further evidence of the
real differences between Ford and
Carter, one need only consider their
choice of running mates. Mondale.
who doesn't really deserve Dole's es
timation of him as being the most lib
eral senator, is nevertheless a most
reasonable man whom many wish
were heading the ticket.
On the other side, the debate of last

week should have reminded those
who had forgotten his performance
during Watergate or who might not
have followed his unscrupulous and
narrowly successful senate campaign
against Dr. William Roy in 1974, of
what a mean little man Robert Dole
is.
For those who fail to see a clear
choice between Carter and Ford, the
thought of Robert Dole a heartbeat
from the presidency should be the de
ciding factor.
Politically chaste
In an election as close as this one
has apparently become, there is no de
fense for voting for McCarthy or for
Peter Camejo (whose candidacy is
more understandable than McCar
thy's), or for not voting. To attempt to
remain politically chaste by one of
these routes is an intellectual conceit
which may seem affordable in the
comfortable surroundings here, but

for which many less fortunates may
pay dearly in the years ahead.
Presidential politics is no substitute
for issue-oriented politics. In other
words, I suffer under no illusion ihat
Jimmy Carter will bring the Mil
lenium, twice-born or not. But if we
want to expand the range of pos
sibilities attainable in the next four
years, it would behoove progressive
types to muster whatever enthusiasm
and energy they can to ensure Carter's
election.
I will be pounding the pavement on
November 2 to get out the Carter vote.
I hope I will see you there too.
In the meantime, let us do what we
can to improve the quality of the de
bate. Let us insist that there are issues
other than slips of the tongue by either
candidate and the Playboy interview.
