# New theme house draws Italian spirits, cuisine
## 
### Meg Walker 
What does it feel like to live in
a Row house that is worth $1.3
million? Everyone certainly a
grees "it's an architectural
showboat," so says Taddeo
Bartlem, the house associate
(RAJ of La Casa Italiana, one of
the three new Row houses. With
rooms spread out on the two top
levels, staggered around a well
that makes the sunken living
room the center of the house, it's
a far cry from Stern or Wilbur.
The most interesting thing
about the house is what goes on
inside. La Casa Italiana brings
in a bit of Italian life and cul

ture. At the encouragement of
Prof. Alphonse Julliand, four
students presented the idea of an
Italian theme house to the Com
mittee on Student Services
(COSS) last spring. The plan was
approved and today all students
who live at 562 Mayfield share
an interest and enthusiasm to
learn about the culture, lan
guage, history, art and cuisine of
Italy.
Many educators agree there's
no better way to learn a language
than to speak it all the time and
hear other people speaking it to
you. With 44 students all at dif
ferent levels of ability in Italian
it's not always easy to find a

common pace, but by everyone
making an effort and with the
help of the many Italians coming
in and out, the atmosphere
makes you feel like speaking Ita
lian.
Much of the spirit of the house
is generated by Anna Maria
Napolitano and her husband
Fietro. The Napolitanos live in
the house as resident fellows.
Signora Napolitano is the Senior
Lecturer in the Italian Depart
ment and comes from Naples,
where she is descended from a
royal Neapolitan family. She
teaches a class in the house on
the folklore of southern Italy,
her specialty. With her constant
stream of Italian and her flam
boyant character she adds her
aura to the house.
All the students living in La
Casa Italiana are required to take
a course offered in the Italian
Department (unless they have
completed the equivalent of Ita
lian 52). Courses fulfilling this
requirement range from the
basic Italian grammar classes to
Louis Nigro's history course,
"From Mazzini to Mussolini".
Nigro, familiar to many students
as a research fellow of History
1,2,3, has put together a seminar
taught at La Casa Italiana,
concerning important fi
gures and the impact of their
ideas in Italian history.
Other inspirations
Other Italian inspirations to
the house include Guelpho
Frulla and Franca Celli who are
on leave from Stanford in Flor
ence. Frulla, born in Venice and
a graduate of Yale Law School,
teaches a class on Machiavelli
and Guicciardini and he adds his
sparkle and deep appreciation of
opera to the Wednesday night
opera lecture series; both classes
given in La Casa Italiana. Sig
nora Celli, a native of Florence,
teaches Italian grammar conver
sation classes. Both Frulla and
Celli eat their meals at the house
and are invaluable in encourag
ing students to speak Italian.
Students find their Italian put
to the test when they go to help
Maria Catena, the house cook,
make pasta in the kitchen. She is
from a small town on the Adria
tic coast and has been living in
the Italian district in San Fran
cisco for the past 15 years. She

speaks very little English and
provides the house with some of
the best Italian cuisine to be
found. From her risotto allu
Milanese to vitello con spinuci,
she brings the house one of the
most exciting parts of the Italian
culture as well as a rich Italian
vocabulary that is not found in
the average classroom.
By the efforts of the French
and Italian Departments and La
Casa Italiana, there is always
some aspect of Italian culture
appearing in the house. Interest
ing speakers and programs have

been planned for Fall quarter.
For instance, Giorgio Bassani,
the author of The Gardens of
Vinzi Contini will be at the
house on Nov. 23. His book was
made into a successful movie,
The Gardens of Vinzi Contini,
that focuses on the plight of Ita
lian Jews during the war. Bas
sani is now studying and teach
ing poetry at UC Berkeley.
In November the house will
also be filled with the sculptures
of Mimi Sinisca, a Roman
sculptor. Recently his art has
been showing in New York, and

with the help of Santa Clara
Museum of Art it is being flown
out here and will be on display
in La Casa Italiana.
Cine club
The cine club italiano pro
vides Italian films every Tues
day night; all films are in Italian
with English subtitles. Between
the showing of each film Leda
Mussio, a lecturer in the Italian
Department, will come back to
the house to discuss the film and
its importance to Italy. Many of
the films have been acclaimed as
the best film of the Cannes Film

Festival as is the case with this
Tuesday's film: The Working
Class Goesto Paradise.
La Casa Italiana hopes the
Stanford community will find
these events as interesting as
they do. The house wants to
share its theme with more than
just the 44 students who live
here. La Casa Italiana can also he
used as a place to hold events
about Italy that the community
may wish to sponsor. Anyone
having any ideas about Italy or
the culture should contact the
RA Taddeo Bartlem.
