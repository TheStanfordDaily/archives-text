# Candidates fare equally in debate

"It was a fairly even perfor
mance for both sides," said Win
Foster, chairman of the Mid-
Peninsula Steering Committee
for Carter-Mondale, comment
ing on the last presidential de
bate between Republican in
cumbant Gerald Ford and his
Democratic challenger Jimmy
Carter.
His reaction was fairly typical
of local opinion, and similar to
the overall national response, as
determined by several polls.
Foster also said, "Both (candi
dates) had good moments. Carter
came out a little bit ahead.
Neither one did anything to
harm their standing. While Car

ter spoke too rapidly at times,
President Ford just put me to
sleep. 1 think he struck most
people as a decent enough guy,
but he doesn't project an impres
sion of offering any creative
leadership."
Bob Walker, executive direc
tor of the Santa Clara County Re
publican Central Committee, felt
that the President's response to
questions about his role in block
ing a 1972 investigation into
Watergate was "sufficient."
"Numerous investigations all
found the same thing," he said.
lames Yeager, press secretary
to independent presidential
candidate Eugene McCarthy,
characterized the event as "not

debates, but parallel press con
ferences." He said they were "an
exercise in limiting free speech
to the two largest political par
ties."
Criticism of both
candidates also came from Roger
Macßride, Presidential candi
date of the Libetarian Party.
Macßride said that "the fun
damental.issues were not raised
in the debate.. .All of them spoke
in terms of what should be done
by the government, what the
government was and was not do
ing, in terms of what 'we' ought
to do about housing, un
employment, foreign policy.
There was no challenge as to
whether the statist, collectivist

government authority ought to
have a role in our lives."
Amy Doi, chairman of the
northern California Asian-
Americans for Senator John
Tunney and a member of the
Mid-Peninsula Steering Com
mittee for Carter-Mondale, said
she thought the last debate was
"the best".
"I thought Jimmy Carter ap
peared much more calm and had
better eye contact," she said.
