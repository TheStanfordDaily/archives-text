# Peking crowd greets China's new premier

Tokyo (AP) — Hua kuo-feng re
ceived thunderous applause yesterday
from a reported one million Chinese
on his first public appearance as the
successor to Mao Tse-tung.
The crowd in front of Tien An Men
— the Cate of Heavenly Peace — also
cheered a report that the nation has
escaped "real danger" from a coup at
tempt involving Mao's widow.
Peking Mayor Wu Teh told the audi
ence of soldiers and civilians that Mao,
before his death at age 82 on Sept. 9,
personally had selected Hua to suc
ceed him as Communist party chair
man. He added that a "gang of four"
top officials had tried to thwart this
alleged wish of Mao and wanted to
name Mao's widow, Chiang Ching, to
the top party post.
Wu gave few details of the alleged
coup attempt and said nothing about
the fate of the conspirators. In addition
to Chiang Ching, the ringleaders were
identified as party Vice Chairman
Wang Hung-wen, Vice Premier Chang
Chun-chiao and Politburo member
Yao Wen-yuan.
Japanese reports said they are being
detained and investigated separately
in Peking.
"We were confronted with the real
danger of our party turning revisionist
and our country changing its political
color," said Wu, who is one of 16 re

maining Politburo members and alter
nates.
The official Hsinhua news agency
said Wu stated that shortly after nam
ing Hua premier and first deputy party
chairman in April, "Chairman Mao
wrote to comrade Hua kuo-feng in his
own handwriting, 'With you incharge,
I'm at ease.' which expressed his
boundless trust in comrade Hua kuo
feng."
Japan's kyodo news service quoted
reliable sources in Peking as saying
Mao was not at ease with his wife. It
said he had refused even to meet with
Chiang Ching since late 1973.
Wu said, "while Chairman Mao was
seriously ill and after he passed away,
the anti-party clique of Wang Hung
wen, Chang Chun-chiao, Chiang
Ching and Yao Wen-yuan hastily
seized the opportunities and attemp
ted to usurp top party and state leader
ship."
Although Wu seemed to give equal
treatment to Moscow and Washington
since Mao's death, China's official
press has concentrated its fire on the
Soviet Union, declaring it the likely
source of a new world war.
Hua, 57, was virtually unknown
until last January when he was picked
as acting premier following the death
of Premier Chou En-lai.
