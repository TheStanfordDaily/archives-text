# Lawyer claims Trident violates international law
## 
### Mary LeBlanc 
The Trident nuclear submarine and missile sys
tem is illegal because it violates the principles of
international law as established at the Nuremberg
War Trials and in the U.N. Charter, according to
former Nuremberg prosecuting attorney Mary
Kaufman.
Speaking at kresge Auditorium Friday. Kauf
man, professor of international law at Antioch
College, focused her lecture on the question of
national security or international crime regarding
nuclear and thermonuclear first-strike weapons.
"These first-strike weapons are illegal because
they will take the initiative to go after an enemy.
They are 'crimes against peace' according to the
Nuremberg Charter," Kaufman stated. She
explained that the fundamental innovation at
Nuremberg was the branding of aggressive war as
a crime.
Kaufman said these weapons are illegal also
because they violate the U.N. Charter which
"prohibits the threat of or the use of force." Other
provisions in the charter guarantee against "any
conduct which threatens international security."
"One of the primary purposes of the U.N. Char
ter was to eliminate and prohibit the right of a
country to start and continue war, except for self
defense in the case of an actual armed attack," she
said.
'Direct violation'
"The use of first-strike nuclear weapons is
clearly a direct violation of this charter and of
many other international treaties," she added.
Kaufman went on to say the most minimal read
ing of such laws of war indicates that these laws
distinctly prohibit the use of nuclear weapons
such as the Trident.
Although the illegality of nuclear weapons has
been in effect since World War 11, Kaufman said
the United States and several other countries have
disregarded this fact.

Supporting her statement, Kaufman presented
excerpts from The Low of Land Warfare, an Army
field manual printed in 1956 and currently in use,
which states that . . the use of lances with
barbed heads, irregular-shaped bullets, and pro
jectiles filled with glass. . . "are illegal, but "the
use of explosive 'automic weapons'. . . as such
cannot be regarded as violative of international
law in the absence of any customary rule of inter
national law
She also stated that the arms race is getting so
serious "that in several years 35 nations will be
able to produce nuclear and thermo-nuclear
weapons."
To stop the use of such weapons, "individuals
must project the principle that Trident and all
other nuclear weapons are illegal, and individu
als must create a political climate in which the
American society will accept the principles of
international laws," Kaufman said.
Outlaw nuclear weapons
She added the United States must not only out
law and stop the construction of nuclear weapons,
but it must also stop the technological develop
ment of them.
"This job is tough for tlit; simple reason that the
makers of these weapons have a vested economic
interest in the continuance of one horrifying
weapon after another," concluded Kaufman.
Kaufman's lecture was the last campus event of
Trident Concern Week, sponsored by Pacific Life
Community to call attention to the global danger
of the Trident submarine and missle system, ac
cording to its sponsors.
"The great significance of Trident Concern
Week to the Stanford community is that the Tri
dent 1 missile is being developed at Lockheed
Missiles and Space Research Lab in the Stanford
Industrial Park and is being built at Lockheed in
Sunnyvale," said Wayne Sachs, a student or
ganizer for Trident Concern Week.
