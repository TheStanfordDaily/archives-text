## Fourth quarter Card drive does in WSU Off day for Benjamin, Stanford 
### Chris Baker 
Pullman, Wash.—lt's hard to
understand how Washington
State, a team which was dazed
and confused by UCLA 62-3,
could come home to the Falouse
and play a good football game.
But even Patty Hearst's
psychiatrists might rob a bank if
they tried to understand how
Stanford, a team which shares
the same feelings about the final
15 minutes of a football game as
most Americans reserve for
April 15, could put together a
fourth-period scoring march
which would have made General
Woody Hayes proud.
Hell, what do shrinks know?
With a long plane ride home,
and 74 yards, looming ahead, the
Cards ate up the last six and
one-half minutes with a 14-play
scoring drive to beat the Cougars
22-16. The win kept Stanford's
slim Rose Bowl hopes, rather
dreams, alive.
Winning touchdown
Running back Gary Lynn went
over from the one-yard line with
29 seconds remaining, to skin
the Cougs. It was Lynn's second
touchdown of the cold after
noon, and it made the near
capacity Martin Stadium crowd
of 24,300 drunken fans seek
further comfort from the bottle.
Stanford buried Washington
State when the Cards converted
four third-down situations dur
ing their final 74-yard scoring
march.
Card flanker Tony Hill threw
the first shovel of dirt, when he
caught an 18-yard pass from
quarterback Guy Benjamin on
third-and-eight at the Stanford
28.
Receiving mark
It was Hill's fourth catch of the
afternoon and it tied the Stan
ford career reception record
(122) set by San Francisco 49er
All-Pro Gene Washington.
Running back Phil Francis,
who had his best day as a Card
with 135 yards on 28 carries,
converted two of the do-or-die
situations with a pair of short
runs.
Benjamin got Stanford to the
WSU 11-yard line with a 21-yard
pass to tailback Ron Inge, but the
Cards were faced with a third
and-three situation at the four
yard line.
Francis threw the final shovel
of dirt when he got three tough
yards over the middle, for the
crucial first down.
Ball control
"It's always great to come out
and put together a drive like that
when you need it," said Stanford
coach Jack Christiansen.
"It wasn't artistic, but it's a
win."

How did Stanford manage to
put itself into such a deep hole?
"I was the shits," offered Ben
jamin.
Worst day
Benjamin had his worst day of
the season, completing just 13 of
30 passes for 154 yards and one
touchdown. His receivers drop
ped his first three passes of the
afternoon and the next two were
intercepted.
But if Benjamin was "the
shits" then so was Stanford.
The Cards' only real drive of
the first quarter, other than the
two-hour trek from their hotel in
Spokane, was sparked by Mike
Michel's 21-yard fake punt. But
Inge committed his first of two
fumbles and the drive was over.
Cougar quarterback Jack
Thompson marched WSU down
totheStanford 11-yard line,after
Benjamin threw his second in
terception of the day.
Key injury
On a first down from the Stan
ford 12, Thompson fired a pass
to split end Mike Levenseller,
the Pacific-B's leading receiver.
Levenseller's thigh hit the end
zone marker but the officials
ruled that he was out of the end
zone.
But if WSU fans thought that
call was bad, they had only to
wait for the next play.
Thompson ran the same play,
hitting flanker Brian kelley in
the end zone. The officials nul
lified the touchdown, saying
that Kelley was out of the end
zone.
But the Stanford defense gave
Thompson a few gifts on the
Cougars' first possession of the
second quarter. The sophomore
quarterback moved Washington

State, the nation's leading col
lege passing team. 85 yards in 11
plays to take a short-lived 6-0
lead.
High fumble
The Cards drove to the WSU
19-yard line on the very next
possession of the game.But Inge
fumbled the ball high into the air
(it was about as high as most of
the Washington State Dad's
Weekend crowd was) when he
was hit and the Cougars reco
vered the ball at the eight-yard
stripe.
But Martin Stadium is not the
Los Angeles Colisem, as WSU
and Stanford found out on the
next play.
Card linebacker C.ordy Cere
si no, who had another superb
game with 13 tackles, recovered
Cougar running back Sam
Busch's fumble at the WSU
one-yard line.
It took Stanford just two plays
to score, with Francis bolting
over the middle for the tying
touchdown. Michel booted the
extra point and added a 43-yard
field goal as the first half ran out
to give Stanford a 10-6 lead.
Thompson had to operate
under constant pressure from
Ceresino, Duncan McColl and
Jeff Barton. Washington State
came within one point, when
kicker Chuck Diedrick booted a
27-yard field goal, after a Cougar
Stanford's biggest break, in
this comedy of errors, came
when the Cards partially
blocked a punt by All-American
candidate Gavin Hedrick.
It took the Cards just two plays
to go 30 yards, as Benjamin fired
