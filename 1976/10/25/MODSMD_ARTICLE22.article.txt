# Cal out of Rose Bowl race
## 
### Paul Bauman 
Berkeley — California, a team
that remained in the 1976 Rose
Bowl race until the final few mi
nutes of last season, is already
out of the running for this New
Year's Day classic.
The Bears lost to UCLA, 35-19,
Saturday, dropping their
Pacific-8 record to 1-2. That
doesn't automatically eliminate
them, but their chances now are
only mathematical. lust to finish
ahead of UCLA, Cal would have
to win the rest of its games and
the Bruins would have to lose
three of their remaining four
games.
"We can't hide from reality,"
said a mourning Mike White, Cal
head coach, after the game. "Our
one chance now is to spoil
somebody else's New Year's

Day. You don't go to the Rose
Bowl with two conference los
ses."
Cal's loss is no reason for Stan
ford to rejoice. UCLA, you may
recall, beat the Cards too. If Stan
ford is going to edge out the
Bruins for the Rose Bowl, it will
have to win the rest of its games,
while UCLA loses two games,
probably to Washington next
week and USC.
The future doesn't look too
rosy for Stanford.
No excuses
Cal has no excuses to offer
after Saturday. The Bears had
ample opportunities to win, but
failed to cash in on them. UCLA
fumbled six times in the game,
four times in the second quarter
alone.
That second period was as

bizarre as the fourth in the
Stanford-UCLA game three
weeks ago, when Cuy Benjamin
threw four interceptions. UCLA
fumbled every time it had the
ball.
The clumsiest Bruin was
second-string quarterback Steve
Bukich, who played most of the
second quarter after a hard tackle
temporarily put starter Jeff
Dankworth on the sidelines.
Missed handoff
On Bukich's first series, he
tried to hand the ball off to an
unsuspecting running back. The
ball popped up in the air and Cal
recovered.
Exactly three minutes later,
Bukich rolled out and sprinted
upfield for 40 yards, 38 of them
with the ball. Bukich somehow
surrendered it in full stride
without being hit. The Bears
again recovered.
Cal was able to convert the
turnovers into only 13 points,
but that was enough to put the
Bears back in the game. UCLA
led 14-13 at halftime.
Cal lost because it could not
move the ball on UCLA with any

consistency. The loss of quarter
back Joe Roth and receiver Wes
ley Walker, who were injured in
last week's loss to Oregon State,
undoubtedly hurt, but this was
the third straight week that the
Bears' offense had faltered.
Fred Besana, who played the
whole game at quarterback for
Gal, completed 24 of 42 passes
for 175 yards, an average of only
7.3 yards per completion.
Gal's offensive game plan was
to throw short in an effort to con
trol the ball and keep it away
from UCLA's potent veer of
fense. It didn't work. Gal had
only 12 first downs, compared to
UCLA's 21.
The Bruins had little trouble
moving the ball when they held
on to it. UCLA gained 429 total
yards, 347 of them on the
ground. Wendell Tyler ran for
131 yards on 19 carries and
Dankworth gained 107 yards on
18 rushes.
Good passer
Dankworth also passed well,
hitting eight of 12 attempts for
83 yards, including a beautiful
27-yard slant-in to Wally Henry
for a touchdown.
The game would have heen
more lopsided had UCLA not
been so generous with the ball.
For Besana, the afternoon was
a dream turned into a nightmare.

"This is the kind of thing you
dream about, to play against a
great team," he said.
"I've had a lot of terrible
games, but I've never felt this
bad. You work all your life and
watch championship games as a
kid. It's just an unbelievable feel
ing to lose that way."
In other Pac-8 action,
freshman tailback Charles White
rushed for 107 yards and three
touchdowns, leading USC to a
56-0 crunching of Oregon State.
Ricky Bell suffered a hip pointer
in the first quarter and retired for
the day. The injury was not
considered serious.
USC has now played both
Oregon schools and outscored
them 109-0.
Another freshman tailback,
Joe Steele, ran 72 yards for the

winning touchdown a
Washington beat Oregon 14-7.
