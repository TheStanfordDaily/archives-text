# Cards find ground game
## 
### Chris Baker 
Pullman, Wash.—There haven't
been many games in which the
Stanford rushing game has been
more potent than the Card pas
sing game.
You could probably count
them on one hand.
But in Saturday's 22-16 vic
tory over Washington State, the
Card rushers accounted for 216
of Stanford's 370 total yards.
When Stanford needed to
convert four third-down situa
tions on the deciding
touchdown drives, it did some
thing usually reserved for UCLA
and Michigan — it went to its
running game.
Offensive line
"Talk about the line, all of
them," said running back Phil
Francis, the contest's leading
rusher with 135 yards on 28 car
ries.
"Everytime I had a hole to run
to, I felt no pressure on the
drive. . . those third-down plays
I just ran behind Gordy King and
you can't help but be confident
following him."
Francis was filling in for
fullback Don Stevenson, who
pulled a muscle in practice last
week. The sophomore from
Beaverton, Ore. had gained just
100 yards on 22 carries coming
into the contest.
But on a day when Stanford's
half of an expected air show
never materialized, Francis
saved the Cards from humilia
tion. He carried the offensive
load most of the afternoon.
'Outstanding job'
"I though Phil Francis did an
outstanding job," said coach
Jack Christiansen. "I also thought

Gary Lynn, who scored two
touchdowns, did a great job."
Francis' Card teammates gave
him the nickname "Guts" Satur
day. He earned it.
"1 banged up my knee during
the first half," said Francis. "I
had no idea I was going to play
that much. I haven't carried the
ball that much since high
school."
Stanford flat
For the second week in a row,
Stanford appeared to be as flat as
the Palouse's rolling hills. v We
had a lot of adversity getting
here," said Christiansen. "We
had a two-hour bus ride and a lot
of the kids were sleeping. You
could tell there wasn't a hell of a
lot of enthusiasm.
"Sometimes you can talk and
talk (about how tough a team is)
and it doesn't do any good. At
halftime, I think they got a little
enthusiastic."
Quarterback Guy Benjamin
had his worst day of the year,
completing 13 of 30 passes for
154 yards, but Christiansen was
still pleased with his perfor
mance.
"I thought Benjamin did well,
especially on the last drive, pick
ing up first downs and seeing the
situations coming up" said
Chris.
"I though he did an outstand
ing job especially after the shaky
start, with three dropped passes
and two interceptions," he ad
ded.
If Benjamin didn't live up to
his part of the bargain, Cougar
quarterback Jack Thompson
did. The sophomore signal caller
hit on 19 of 33 passes for 235
yards.
