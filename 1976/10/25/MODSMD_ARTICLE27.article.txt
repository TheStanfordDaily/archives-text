# Battle of NCAA contenders
## Poloists upset UCLA, 11-6 
### Chris Kamel 
"Mentally, I know we'll be
ready for UCLA," said varsity
water polo starter Marty Davis
during the practice week before
the Bruin-Card matchup, pitting
the third and fourth NCAA
finishers last year, respectively,
at the deCuerre Pools Friday.
Well, the Cards were ready. In
fact, they played out of their
water polo hats in upsetting the
Bruins, 11-6. Their performance
had even coach Art Lambert up
and applauding after the game.
"It's probably the best game
for us thus far," said Lambert,
"but we really have a lot of
things to work on yet." He out
lined that the Cards have to work
on offense when Stanford has a
man advantage as well as make
certain defensive changes.
Robert Horn, UCLA water polo

coach, had feelings along the
same lines after the game.
"Stanford is definitely the best
team we've played so far," said
Horn, whose Bruins had lost
only once coming into the
match. "The basic mistake that
we made was that when we had a
man disadvantage on defense
and managed to steal the ball, we
didn't wait for that man to come
back on offense."
Dorst leads team
Stanford did not win on UC
LA's weaknesses, however, but
rather on its own strengths. Led
by Chris Dorst in the goal, the
Cards' pressing defense forced
numerous turnovers through
steals and blocked shots. This
led to the frustrated Bruins tak
ing many low-percentage shots
in the fourth quarter, which led
the Cards to a 4-2 last-period dif

ference, shutting the door on
UCLA.
Dorst's performance included
seven blocks, two on penalty go
als, which upped that mark to six
penalty shot blocks in the last
two games. The senior's defen
sive play didn't stop there, how
ever. Dorst came out of the goal
on many occasions to steal the
ball on defense.
How does Dorst feel when he
uses that heart-in-the-throat tac
tic? Well, he acknowledged that
he knows that there is no one be
hind him to back him up.
"It's a gamble," Dorst said,
"but I make sure that there is no
blatant way they can score when
I come out." The gamble paid off
as Dorst came out three times to
steal the ball without getting
burned once.
Stanford's evenly-pressing de

fense was complemented by its
balanced scoring attack as Rick
Johannsen dominated the play
in the hole (the pivot around
which the offense is set up),
lohannesen, Davis, and Robbie
Arnold led the Cards with two
goals apiece, while Drew
McConald, Doug Burke, and
Tommy Angelo picked up pne
each.
"I think a major part of this
game was based on the play of
Angelo," said Lambert. "I hadn't
really used him all that much be
fore this, but he came on and
played superby."
In their second game of the
weekend, the Cards beat Univer
sity of the Pacific, 12-5. Once
again, Stanford's offense was
marked by the balanced scoring
of McDonald, Arnold, Burke and
Paul Clark, who led the Cards
with two goals apiece.
"The good thing about this
weekend was that we could key
on only one team," said Lambert
referring to UCLA. "But, it is
going to be different this next
weekend."
Tough weekend
The Cards go up against UCSB
and California at deCuerre Fri
day and Saturday. Both teams
are strong contenders for NCAA
tournament berths.
"It's vital that we establish
that we can beat Cal," said Lam
bert, "for if we make it to the
NCAAs, we will have to play
them twice more after this."

Shot on goal
Stanford's Drew McDonald, a three-year letterman, takes a shot against UCLA Friday. The
Cards upset UCLA, 11-6.
"Mentally, I know we'll be
ready for UCLA," said varsity
water polo starter Marty Davis
during the practice week before
the Bruin-Card matchup, pitting
the third and fourth NCAA
finishers last year, respectively,
at the deCuerre Pools Friday.
Well, the Cards were ready. In
fact, they played out of their
water polo hats in upsetting the
Bruins, 11-6. Their performance
had even coach Art Lambert up
and applauding after the game.
"It's probably the best game
for us thus far," said Lambert,
"but we really have a lot of
things to work on yet." He out
lined that the Cards have to work
on offense when Stanford has a
man advantage as well as make
certain defensive changes.
Robert Horn, UCLA water polo

coach, had feelings along the
same lines after the game.
"Stanford is definitely the best
team we've played so far," said
Horn, whose Bruins had lost
only once coming into the
match. "The basic mistake that
we made was that when we had a
man disadvantage on defense
and managed to steal the ball, we
didn't wait for that man to come
back on offense."
Dorst leads team
Stanford did not win on UC
LA's weaknesses, however, but
rather on its own strengths. Led
by Chris Dorst in the goal, the
Cards' pressing defense forced
numerous turnovers through
steals and blocked shots. This
led to the frustrated Bruins tak
ing many low-percentage shots
in the fourth quarter, which led
the Cards to a 4-2 last-period dif

ference, shutting the door on
UCLA.
Dorst's performance included
seven blocks, two on penalty go
als, which upped that mark to six
penalty shot blocks in the last
two games. The senior's defen
sive play didn't stop there, how
ever. Dorst came out of the goal
on many occasions to steal the
ball on defense.
How does Dorst feel when he
uses that heart-in-the-throat tac
tic? Well, he acknowledged that
he knows that there is no one be
hind him to back him up.
"It's a gamble," Dorst said,
"but I make sure that there is no
blatant way they can score when
I come out." The gamble paid off
as Dorst came out three times to
steal the ball without getting
burned once.
Stanford's evenly-pressing de

fense was complemented by its
balanced scoring attack as Rick
Johannsen dominated the play
in the hole (the pivot around
which the offense is set up),
lohannesen, Davis, and Robbie
Arnold led the Cards with two
goals apiece, while Drew
McConald, Doug Burke, and
Tommy Angelo picked up pne
each.
"I think a major part of this
game was based on the play of
Angelo," said Lambert. "I hadn't
really used him all that much be
fore this, but he came on and
played superby."
In their second game of the
weekend, the Cards beat Univer
sity of the Pacific, 12-5. Once
again, Stanford's offense was
marked by the balanced scoring
of McDonald, Arnold, Burke and
Paul Clark, who led the Cards
with two goals apiece.
"The good thing about this
weekend was that we could key
on only one team," said Lambert
referring to UCLA. "But, it is
going to be different this next
weekend."
Tough weekend
The Cards go up against UCSB
and California at deCuerre Fri
day and Saturday. Both teams
are strong contenders for NCAA
tournament berths.
