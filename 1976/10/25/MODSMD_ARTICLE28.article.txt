Scotchers win
Stanford's red and white plaid
whirlwind twirled by a stubborn
Cal-Poly Pomona team to a 3-1
victory Friday at Roble Field,
adding another win to its unde
feated record.
Moving the ball throughout
the game with superb stick-work
and enviable hustle, the Card
scotchers were challenged by
the Broncos just enough to keep
the game exciting, but not
heart-breaking.
The clash between the two
feisty teams resulted in a 1-0
score at the half, with junior link
Onnie killefer scoring for the
Cards off a penalty point.
Ten seconds into the second
half, junior forward Mandy Read
took a pass from Killefer, drib
bled and shot for the Scotchers'
second goal.
Despite this initial momen
tum. the second half found both
teams slowing down and play
ing more loosely. The Card mo
tion wasn't flowing as well, and
Cal-Poly finally managed to
score, making the tally 2-1.
With two-and-a-half minutes
to go in the game, the Broncos
once again brought the ball too
close to Stanford's goal for Card
comfort. In the tensest moment
of the game, they made a crucial
shot, but were thwarted by Card
goalie Buffie Berger.
Keeping the grateful crowd in
suspense, the scotchers waited
until the final minute of the
game to make what offensive
coach Lewis Alexander termed a
"picture perfect goal." Read took
the ball down the right, making a
wall pass to senior forward
Kathy Levinson. Levinson pas
sed across the heavily defended
circle to left wing Alison King,
who deflected it in for the game's
impressive final point.

Though Card coach Shirley
Schoof was proud of the "excep
tional teamwork" exhibited by
the Cards, she admitted that both
teams were playing less precise
hockey the second.half.
"The other team was desper
ate for a shot, and their despera
tion transferred across to us,"
she stated. —Debbie Carlton
JV football rout
Both the jubilant Cards and
the relieved Santa Clara Broncos
were happy to leave Stanford
Stadium Friday night after Stan
ford coach Don Frease's awe
some junior varsity gridders an
nihilated their Santa Clara
guests 56-6.
As the halftime score glared
35-6, many of the more humane
fans advocated immediate
euthanasia for the visitors — in
stead, the remaining quarters
were shortened by three minutes
each as all 50 of the Stanford
roughs got a piece of the action.
They helped to blast out 585
yards of dynamite offense, while
a stingy defense allowed only
157 yards in the 54-minute
laugher v
Junior quarterback Joe
Rominger was sensational, mis
sing only 4 of 13 passes, hurling
for 248 yards, and leading the
squad in rushing with a 9.2 aver
age on six carries. One play that
shook the 100-plus spectators
from their lethargy was a 70-yard
scoring strike from Rominger to
his leading receiver. Rick Parker.
Dave Baum snatched three
tosses for 65 yards to comple
ment his perfect eight-for-eight
point-after-touchdown kicking
show. LaVoy Hooks, Mark
Lightfoot and Gordie Banks
joined Rominger in the over
50 yards rushing depart
ment, behind the rock-solid
blocking of the offensive line.

Running back Banks raised
the curtain on Stanford's scoring
extravaganza as he punched the
ball through from four yards out
after only three minutes had
elapsed. The scoreboard flashed
two more updates in that initial
period as Rominger crossed the
goal on runs of two and eleven
yards.
A 30-yard gambol to paydirt
by Rominger in the opening mi
nutes of the second quarter was
accompanied 2:30 later by a
five-yard touchdown from Rich
White. It was with 3:45 left in the
first half that the Broncs found
their way into the greener pas
ture at the end of the field on a
30-yard pass from Dave Alfaro to
Garey Candau, one of Santa Cla
ra's nine completions in the
course of 29 tries.
The Cards roared back onto
the field after intermission and
marched to three impressive
touchdowns in the next 12 mi
nutes. _ ... .

tighter than expected, was
marked by good play from Davis
and the Cards' mental lapses.

conference last year, and was
"up" for the highly-regarded
Stanford team. It was a close af
fair until the third game, when
the Cards came through in fine

The clash between the two
feisty teams resulted in a 1-0
score at the half, with junior link
Onnie killefer scoring for the
Cards off a penalty point.
Ten seconds into the second
half, junior forward Mandy Read
took a pass from Killefer, drib
bled and shot for the Scotchers'
second goal.
Despite this initial momen
tum. the second half found both
teams slowing down and play
ing more loosely. The Card mo
tion wasn't flowing as well, and
Cal-Poly finally managed to
score, making the tally 2-1.
With two-and-a-half minutes
to go in the game, the Broncos
once again brought the ball too
close to Stanford's goal for Card
comfort. In the tensest moment
of the game, they made a crucial
shot, but were thwarted by Card
goalie Buffie Berger.
Keeping the grateful crowd in
suspense, the scotchers waited
until the final minute of the
game to make what offensive
coach Lewis Alexander termed a
"picture perfect goal." Read took
the ball down the right, making a
wall pass to senior forward
Kathy Levinson. Levinson pas
sed across the heavily defended
circle to left wing Alison King,
who deflected it in for the game's
impressive final point.

Though Card coach Shirley
Schoof was proud of the "excep
tional teamwork" exhibited by
the Cards, she admitted that both
teams were playing less precise
hockey the second.half.
"The other team was desper
ate for a shot, and their despera

JV football rout
Both the jubilant Cards and
the relieved Santa Clara Broncos
were happy to leave Stanford
Stadium Friday night after Stan
ford coach Don Frease's awe
some junior varsity gridders an
nihilated their Santa Clara
guests 56-6.
As the halftime score glared
35-6, many of the more humane
fans advocated immediate
euthanasia for the visitors — in
stead, the remaining quarters
were shortened by three minutes
each as all 50 of the Stanford
roughs got a piece of the action.
They helped to blast out 585
yards of dynamite offense, while
a stingy defense allowed only
157 yards in the 54-minute
laugher v
Junior quarterback Joe
Rominger was sensational, mis
sing only 4 of 13 passes, hurling
for 248 yards, and leading the
squad in rushing with a 9.2 aver
age on six carries. One play that
shook the 100-plus spectators
from their lethargy was a 70-yard
scoring strike from Rominger to
his leading receiver. Rick Parker.
Dave Baum snatched three
tosses for 65 yards to comple
ment his perfect eight-for-eight
point-after-touchdown kicking
show. LaVoy Hooks, Mark
Lightfoot and Gordie Banks
joined Rominger in the over
50 yards rushing depart
ment, behind the rock-solid
blocking of the offensive line.

Running back Banks raised
the curtain on Stanford's scoring
extravaganza as he punched the
ball through from four yards out
after only three minutes had
elapsed. The scoreboard flashed
two more updates in that initial
period as Rominger crossed the
goal on runs of two and eleven
yards.
A 30-yard gambol to paydirt
by Rominger in the opening mi
nutes of the second quarter was
accompanied 2:30 later by a
five-yard touchdown from Rich
White. It was with 3:45 left in the
first half that the Broncs found
their way into the greener pas
ture at the end of the field on a
30-yard pass from Dave Alfaro to
Garey Candau, one of Santa Cla
ra's nine completions in the
course of 29 tries.
The Cards roared back onto
the field after intermission and
marched to three impressive
touchdowns in the next 12 mi

JV football rout
Both the jubilant Cards and
the relieved Santa Clara Broncos
were happy to leave Stanford
Stadium Friday night after Stan
ford coach Don Frease's awe
some junior varsity gridders an
nihilated their Santa Clara
guests 56-6.
As the halftime score glared
35-6, many of the more humane
fans advocated immediate
euthanasia for the visitors — in
stead, the remaining quarters
were shortened by three minutes
each as all 50 of the Stanford
roughs got a piece of the action.
They helped to blast out 585
yards of dynamite offense, while
a stingy defense allowed only
157 yards in the 54-minute
laugher v
Junior quarterback Joe
Rominger was sensational, mis
sing only 4 of 13 passes, hurling
for 248 yards, and leading the
squad in rushing with a 9.2 aver
age on six carries. One play that
shook the 100-plus spectators
from their lethargy was a 70-yard
scoring strike from Rominger to
his leading receiver. Rick Parker.
Dave Baum snatched three
tosses for 65 yards to comple
ment his perfect eight-for-eight
point-after-touchdown kicking
show. LaVoy Hooks, Mark
Lightfoot and Gordie Banks
joined Rominger in the over
50 yards rushing depart
ment, behind the rock-solid
blocking of the offensive line.

Running back Banks raised
the curtain on Stanford's scoring
extravaganza as he punched the
ball through from four yards out
after only three minutes had
elapsed. The scoreboard flashed
two more updates in that initial
period as Rominger crossed the
goal on runs of two and eleven
yards.
A 30-yard gambol to paydirt
by Rominger in the opening mi
nutes of the second quarter was
accompanied 2:30 later by a
five-yard touchdown from Rich
White. It was with 3:45 left in the
first half that the Broncs found
their way into the greener pas
ture at the end of the field on a
30-yard pass from Dave Alfaro to
Garey Candau, one of Santa Cla
ra's nine completions in the
course of 29 tries.
The Cards roared back onto
the field after intermission and
marched to three impressive
touchdowns in the next 12 mi

Keeping the grateful crowd in
suspense, the scotchers waited
until the final minute of the
game to make what offensive
coach Lewis Alexander termed a
"picture perfect goal." Read took
the ball down the right, making a
wall pass to senior forward
Kathy Levinson. Levinson pas
sed across the heavily defended
circle to left wing Alison King,
who deflected it in for the game's
impressive final point.

Though Card coach Shirley
Schoof was proud of the "excep

the Cards, she admitted that both
teams were playing less precise

JV football rout
Both the jubilant Cards and
the relieved Santa Clara Broncos
were happy to leave Stanford
Stadium Friday night after Stan
ford coach Don Frease's awe
some junior varsity gridders an
nihilated their Santa Clara
guests 56-6.
As the halftime score glared
35-6, many of the more humane
fans advocated immediate
euthanasia for the visitors — in
stead, the remaining quarters
were shortened by three minutes
each as all 50 of the Stanford
roughs got a piece of the action.
They helped to blast out 585
yards of dynamite offense, while
a stingy defense allowed only
157 yards in the 54-minute
laugher v
Junior quarterback Joe
Rominger was sensational, mis
sing only 4 of 13 passes, hurling
for 248 yards, and leading the
squad in rushing with a 9.2 aver
age on six carries. One play that
shook the 100-plus spectators
from their lethargy was a 70-yard
scoring strike from Rominger to
his leading receiver. Rick Parker.
Dave Baum snatched three
tosses for 65 yards to comple
ment his perfect eight-for-eight
point-after-touchdown kicking
show. LaVoy Hooks, Mark
Lightfoot and Gordie Banks
joined Rominger in the over
50 yards rushing depart
ment, behind the rock-solid
blocking of the offensive line.

Running back Banks raised
the curtain on Stanford's scoring
extravaganza as he punched the
ball through from four yards out
after only three minutes had
elapsed. The scoreboard flashed
two more updates in that initial
period as Rominger crossed the
goal on runs of two and eleven
yards.
A 30-yard gambol to paydirt
by Rominger in the opening mi
nutes of the second quarter was
accompanied 2:30 later by a
five-yard touchdown from Rich
White. It was with 3:45 left in the
first half that the Broncs found
their way into the greener pas
ture at the end of the field on a
30-yard pass from Dave Alfaro to
Garey Candau, one of Santa Cla
ra's nine completions in the
course of 29 tries.
The Cards roared back onto
the field after intermission and
marched to three impressive
touchdowns in the next 12 mi
nutes. _ ... .

10-15, 15-3.
The match, which was much
tighter than expected, was
marked by good play from Davis
and the Cards' mental lapses.

conference last year, and was
"up" for the highly-regarded
Stanford team. It was a close af
fair until the third game, when
the Cards came through in fine
form to withstand the challenge.
The victory over Davis pushed
Stanford's season record to 2-0.
After playing at California to

Stanford junior varsity quarterback Joe Rominger unleashes a
70-yard TD pass to Rick Parker in a 56-6 rout of Santa Clara
Friday.
Scotchers win
Stanford's red and white plaid
whirlwind twirled by a stubborn
Cal-Poly Pomona team to a 3-1
victory Friday at Roble Field,
adding another win to its unde
feated record.
Moving the ball throughout
the game with superb stick-work
and enviable hustle, the Card
scotchers were challenged by
the Broncos just enough to keep
the game exciting, but not
heart-breaking.
The clash between the two
feisty teams resulted in a 1-0
score at the half, with junior link
Onnie killefer scoring for the
Cards off a penalty point.
Ten seconds into the second
half, junior forward Mandy Read
took a pass from Killefer, drib
bled and shot for the Scotchers'
second goal.
Despite this initial momen
tum. the second half found both
teams slowing down and play
ing more loosely. The Card mo
tion wasn't flowing as well, and
Cal-Poly finally managed to
score, making the tally 2-1.
With two-and-a-half minutes
to go in the game, the Broncos
once again brought the ball too
close to Stanford's goal for Card
comfort. In the tensest moment
of the game, they made a crucial
shot, but were thwarted by Card
goalie Buffie Berger.
Keeping the grateful crowd in
suspense, the scotchers waited
until the final minute of the
