# Cardinal booters tie '75 NCAA champs

### John Murao 
Saturday's soccer match between Stanford
and the University of San Francisco provided
Cardinal sports fans with the highlight of a
heretofore relatively uneventful Stanford athle
tic season. The final 4-4 score does not do jus
tice to the exciting nature of the game.
San Francisco is the defending NCAA
champion.
The game began with both teams cautious,
USF's superior skill somewhat throttled by
Stanford's aggressive marking. At the 15th mi
nute, lightning struck. Stanford's Paul
Kozachenko intercepted an errant Don pass and
aimed the ball between the San Francisco de
fense. With cat-quick suddenness, Bobby
"Count" Geiger turned on the jets and beat
everyone to the ball, sliding a shot past USF's
helpless keeper, Salvador Diaz, for a 1-0 advan
tage. USF tallied in the 43rd minute on a fluke
shot which Card keeper Lewis Butler just mis
sed, for a half-time score of 1-1.
Stanford's incredible first-half performance
set the tone for the second 45 minutes. Five
minutes into the half, it was Stanford which
displayed a world-class creativity in producing

its prettiest goal of the season and a shocking
2-1 lead, kozachenko, emerging from a mid
season scoring slump, put a devastating move
on a USF defender and beat Diaz with a well
placed shot.
Inspired to greater things. Stanford moved
two goals ahead before an ecstatic, unbelieving
crowd five minutes later. Jim Melamed hit a
lazy ball over the Dons' defense and "Count"
stunned everyone with his second goal of the
game. No one, least of all the San Francisco
side, could believe the goings-on.
USF coach, Steve Negoesco, made no less
than six substitutions, including that of a belea
gured Diaz, in an effort to shake up his squad.
1 he remaining 30 minutes went by agonizingly
slow for the Cards. The ensuing USF attack was
torturous and produced two goals to force the
game into overtime.
Hat trick
In the fourth minute of overtime, an in
credulous audience watched Ceiger complete
his "hat-trick" by converting a penalty shot for
a 4-3 lead. In the waning moments of the first
overtime period, a flurry in front of the Stanford
goal resulted in USF's fourth goal.
