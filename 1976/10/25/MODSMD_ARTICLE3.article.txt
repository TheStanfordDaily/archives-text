# Church cautions voters they can't 'afford Ford'
## 
### Cynthia Neil 
Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho)
stumped for the Democratic ticket yes
terday evening at White Plaza, saying
"1 am so shocked that people are ask
ing me if we can take a chance on Car
ter. I ask, can we take a chance on
Ford?"
Church also campaigned for David
Harris, Democratic candidate for the
12th Congressional district, who
spoke prior to Church.
Church plugged Carter saying,
"Only apathy will defeat Carter." He
added that the example set by a presi

dent "matters a whole lot."
Citing economic statistics, Church
asserted, "We cannot afford Ford. Un
employment is hi'gher than it has been
since the depression and inflation is
twice as high as the average was in the
eight years of the last Democratic ad
ministrations.
"And according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, more persons crossed
into poverty last year than have since
the bureau began taking these statis
tics 17 years ago."
Church, in speaking of morality in
the executive branch and in foreign
policy, said, "The law must be resur
rected in order to restore confidence in
our government. The law must be en
forced in an evenhanded way."
False propaganda
Under this Republican administra
tion, according to Church, the FBI has
come to believe its function is to
spread false propaganda against those
who protested the war in Vietnam and
against minorities trying to achieve
their rights.
The senator then pointed to Ford's
pardon of Nixon, saying, "This type of
action keeps cynicism alive in
America."
As a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Church also said
he wants to bring our foreign policy
"back into conformity."
'Ridiculous'
"It is immoral and ridiculous for
example, for the CIA to make a deal
with some little country in order to
overthrow a government," he said.
Calling Chile a "dagger pointed
straight at the heart of Antarctica,"
Church likened Nixon's order to inter
vene there to "Caesar's peering down
at the colonies from Rome."
Harris in his speech urged voters to
look at this election in the context of
public policy and the future.
Shrinking U.S. advantage
"The United States has six per cent
of the world's population, 60 per cent
of its wealth, and 40 per cent of its
resources. But our advantage will
shrink. This is quickly becoming a
world of scarcity and poorer nations
will no longer sell necessary com
modities to us cheaply," said Harris.
Pointing to the Social Security sys

tem, Harris stated that it is slowly
starving people to death. Harris urged
an abolition of funding Social Security
through what he termed the "regres
sive" Social Security tax, suggesting it
should be funded instead out of gen
eral revenues.
Speaking on conservation and
energy, Harris criticized the Ford ad-

ministration's energy policy as short
sighted.
"They have simply allowed prices to
rise, which is a regressive tax in effect
and are planning to build 110 new
nuclear power plants in the next 10 to
15 years," Harris said.
As an alternative to current policies,
the candidate advocated conservation
measures, such as requiring that all
cars would get 26 miles per gallon by
1980and redesigning heating systems.
"This has been the biggest, strongest
and mightiest nation on earth. We
must become the most compassionate,
far-sighted, understanding and effi
cient. Otherwise we will become as a
race of dinosaurs living on a planet
that can no longer support us."
Harris said the generation rep
resented by students in the audience
was different from his.

"We couldn't ignore the world. You
can. When 1 was a student here the
government was taking people 1 knew
5000 miles from here to get their legs
blown off."
Citing the high unemployment rate,
Harris said that "it will catch up with
you" and that "we must realize our
dreams."
Harris urged the audience to vote for
Carter and Mondale, John Tunney
(Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate)
and yes on Proposition 14.
The rally was sponsored by the Stan
ford Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE), the Stanford Community for
David Harris, SWOPSI, the Dickinson
Fund, the Speakers Bureau, the Office
of Student Activities and the ASSU
Council of Presidents.

"They have simply allowed prices to
rise, which is a regressive tax in effect
and are planning to build 110 new
nuclear power plants in the next 10 to
15 years," Harris said.
As an alternative to current policies,
the candidate advocated conservation
measures, such as requiring that all
cars would get 26 miles per gallon by
1980and redesigning heating systems.
"This has been the biggest, strongest
and mightiest nation on earth. We
must become the most compassionate,
far-sighted, understanding and effi
cient. Otherwise we will become as a
race of dinosaurs living on a planet
that can no longer support us."
Harris said the generation rep
resented by students in the audience
was different from his.

"We couldn't ignore the world. You
can. When 1 was a student here the
government was taking people 1 knew
5000 miles from here to get their legs
blown off."
Citing the high unemployment rate,
Harris said that "it will catch up with
you" and that "we must realize our
dreams."
Harris urged the audience to vote for
Carter and Mondale, John Tunney
(Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate)
and yes on Proposition 14.

Harris, Democratic candidate for the
12th Congressional district, who
spoke prior to Church.
Church plugged Carter saying,
"Only apathy will defeat Carter." He
added that the example set by a presi

Citing economic statistics, Church
asserted, "We cannot afford Ford. Un
employment is hi'gher than it has been

twice as high as the average was in the
eight years of the last Democratic ad
ministrations.
"And according to the Bureau of

Church, in speaking of morality in
the executive branch and in foreign
policy, said, "The law must be resur

False propaganda
Under this Republican administra
tion, according to Church, the FBI has
come to believe its function is to
spread false propaganda against those
who protested the war in Vietnam and
against minorities trying to achieve
their rights.
The senator then pointed to Ford's
pardon of Nixon, saying, "This type of
action keeps cynicism alive in
America."
As a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Church also said
he wants to bring our foreign policy
"back into conformity."
'Ridiculous'
"It is immoral and ridiculous for
example, for the CIA to make a deal
with some little country in order to
overthrow a government," he said.
Calling Chile a "dagger pointed
straight at the heart of Antarctica,"
Church likened Nixon's order to inter
vene there to "Caesar's peering down
at the colonies from Rome."
Harris in his speech urged voters to
look at this election in the context of
public policy and the future.
Shrinking U.S. advantage
"The United States has six per cent
of the world's population, 60 per cent
of its wealth, and 40 per cent of its

Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho)
stumped for the Democratic ticket yes
terday evening at White Plaza, saying
"1 am so shocked that people are ask
ing me if we can take a chance on Car
ter. I ask, can we take a chance on
Ford?"
Church also campaigned for David
Harris, Democratic candidate for the
12th Congressional district, who
spoke prior to Church.
Church plugged Carter saying,
"Only apathy will defeat Carter." He
added that the example set by a presi

dent "matters a whole lot."
Citing economic statistics, Church
asserted, "We cannot afford Ford. Un
employment is hi'gher than it has been
since the depression and inflation is
twice as high as the average was in the
eight years of the last Democratic ad
ministrations.
"And according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, more persons crossed
into poverty last year than have since
the bureau began taking these statis
tics 17 years ago."
Church, in speaking of morality in
the executive branch and in foreign
policy, said, "The law must be resur
rected in order to restore confidence in
our government. The law must be en
forced in an evenhanded way."
False propaganda
Under this Republican administra
tion, according to Church, the FBI has
come to believe its function is to
spread false propaganda against those
who protested the war in Vietnam and
against minorities trying to achieve
their rights.
The senator then pointed to Ford's
pardon of Nixon, saying, "This type of
action keeps cynicism alive in
America."
As a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Church also said
he wants to bring our foreign policy
"back into conformity."
'Ridiculous'
"It is immoral and ridiculous for
example, for the CIA to make a deal
with some little country in order to
overthrow a government," he said.
Calling Chile a "dagger pointed
straight at the heart of Antarctica,"
Church likened Nixon's order to inter
vene there to "Caesar's peering down
at the colonies from Rome."
Harris in his speech urged voters to
look at this election in the context of
public policy and the future.
Shrinking U.S. advantage
"The United States has six per cent
of the world's population, 60 per cent
of its wealth, and 40 per cent of its
resources. But our advantage will
shrink. This is quickly becoming a
world of scarcity and poorer nations
will no longer sell necessary com
modities to us cheaply," said Harris.
Pointing to the Social Security sys

tem, Harris stated that it is slowly
starving people to death. Harris urged
an abolition of funding Social Security
through what he termed the "regres
sive" Social Security tax, suggesting it
should be funded instead out of gen
eral revenues.
Speaking on conservation and
energy, Harris criticized the Ford ad-

ministration's energy policy as short
sighted.
"They have simply allowed prices to
rise, which is a regressive tax in effect
and are planning to build 110 new
nuclear power plants in the next 10 to
15 years," Harris said.
As an alternative to current policies,
the candidate advocated conservation
measures, such as requiring that all
cars would get 26 miles per gallon by
1980and redesigning heating systems.
"This has been the biggest, strongest
and mightiest nation on earth. We
must become the most compassionate,
far-sighted, understanding and effi
cient. Otherwise we will become as a
race of dinosaurs living on a planet
that can no longer support us."
Harris said the generation rep
resented by students in the audience
was different from his.

"We couldn't ignore the world. You
can. When 1 was a student here the
government was taking people 1 knew
5000 miles from here to get their legs
blown off."
Citing the high unemployment rate,
Harris said that "it will catch up with
you" and that "we must realize our
dreams."
Harris urged the audience to vote for
Carter and Mondale, John Tunney
(Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate)
and yes on Proposition 14.
The rally was sponsored by the Stan
ford Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE), the Stanford Community for
David Harris, SWOPSI, the Dickinson
Fund, the Speakers Bureau, the Office
of Student Activities and the ASSU
Council of Presidents.
SCOPE plans to sponsor activities
for Harris opponent Paul McCloskey
before the election.
