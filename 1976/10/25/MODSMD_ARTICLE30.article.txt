Rhodesian blacks vow more violence
Geneva — Two key Rhodesian black leaders vowed
yesterday to step up the guerrilla waragainst Prime Minis
ter lan Smith's white regime despite talks here intended to
bring about black majority rule.
Joshua Knomo, who heads the leading black nationalist
political group inside Rhodesia, and Robert Mugabe, who
speaks for the most militant army of Rhodesian guerrillas,
also reiterated to journalists in separate arrival statements
that U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's peace plan
for Rhodesia is unacceptable to them.
Rhodesian Foreign Minister P.K. Van Der By 1 later told
reporters that in view of the differences and confusion, "it
might well be useful" for Kissinger to come to Geneva to
clarify things.
Ford, Carter strategists predict victory
Interviewed separately on a national television show,
top campaign strategists for Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford
each claimed that his man has the momentum now and
will win.
Democratic national chairman Robert Strauss said Car
ter would collect between 335 and 345 electoral votes,
comfortably more than the 270 needed for victory. Ford's
campaign manager, James A. Baker 111, said he thought the
president would win. "It'll be close," Baker said, but
would not estimate how many electoral votes Ford would
take.
Ford's windup barnstorming tour of the country put
him in California — one of a handful of populous states
which campaign strategists on both sides have pegged as
perhaps pivotal in the Nov. 2 election.
Carter spent yesterday at home in Plains, Ga., and plan
ned to stay there today before setting out on his own final
push that will take him to the West Coast and back before
election day.
Arson claims 25 in Bronx nightclub fire
New York — An arsonist set a fire in the only stairway to
a second story Puerto Rican social club in the South Bronx
during a festive party early yesterday and 25 persons died
in a panicky surge for safety. There were 24 injured, many
leaping from windows to avoid the flames.
"There was only one exit," a fire department spokesman
said, adding that this accounted for the panic and high
loss of life, worst of its kind in the city in a decade.
Three slain in South African protest
Johannesburg, South Africa — Police armed with shot
guns opened fire on demonstrators at a Soweto cemetery
yesterday, killing three persons, a senior police official
said. He reported 51 were injured.
Police also fired on a smaller crowd in the all-black
Soweto township, 10 miles south of Johannesburg,
wounding four blacks, according to Deputy Police Com
missioner D.J. Kriel.

The latest casualties raised the toll from black protests
against the white-minority government to at least 344
persons killed and more than 2000 wounded since June.
Arab summit to focus on Lebanon
Cairo — Arab kings and presidents meet in a summit
conference today to ratily a new peace agreement on
Lebanon that has already been undermined by the warring
factions.
The agreement was reached at a minisummit in Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia, last Monday that brought together six Mos
lem leaders involved in the Lebanese conflict. The full
summit of all 21 Arab League members was to confirm the
pact and fill in a few details.
Instead, as so often has happened in the 18-month-old
civil war, battlefield developments have overtaken the
elaborately-constructed political pact. Now the summit
will have to focus first on violations of the agreement
instead of merely giving its seal of approval.
Archbishop calls for resistance to Pope
Friedrichshafen, West Germany — Cheers rose from a
congregation of about 10.000 yesterday when
traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre called on
Roman Catholics around the world to resist Pope Paul VI.
The church should return to "true Catholic belief," the
French archbishop said in his 1 '/2-hour speech preceeding
the first Latin Mass he has celebrated in public since he
met with the Pope on Sept. 11.
"The destruction of the Catholic faith is proceeding
under orders of the hierarchy," said Archbishop Lefebvre,
who was interrupted repeatedly by applause and cheers of
"bravo."

Three slain in South African protest
Johannesburg, South Africa — Police armed with shot
guns opened fire on demonstrators at a Soweto cemetery
yesterday, killing three persons, a senior police official
said. He reported 51 were injured.
Police also fired on a smaller crowd in the all-black
Soweto township, 10 miles south of Johannesburg,
wounding four blacks, according to Deputy Police Com
missioner D.J. Kriel.

Arab summit to focus on Lebanon
Cairo — Arab kings and presidents meet in a summit
conference today to ratily a new peace agreement on
Lebanon that has already been undermined by the warring
factions.
The agreement was reached at a minisummit in Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia, last Monday that brought together six Mos
lem leaders involved in the Lebanese conflict. The full
summit of all 21 Arab League members was to confirm the
pact and fill in a few details.
Instead, as so often has happened in the 18-month-old
civil war, battlefield developments have overtaken the
elaborately-constructed political pact. Now the summit
will have to focus first on violations of the agreement
instead of merely giving its seal of approval.
Archbishop calls for resistance to Pope
Friedrichshafen, West Germany — Cheers rose from a
congregation of about 10.000 yesterday when
traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre called on
Roman Catholics around the world to resist Pope Paul VI.
The church should return to "true Catholic belief," the
French archbishop said in his 1 '/2-hour speech preceeding
the first Latin Mass he has celebrated in public since he
met with the Pope on Sept. 11.
"The destruction of the Catholic faith is proceeding
under orders of the hierarchy," said Archbishop Lefebvre,
who was interrupted repeatedly by applause and cheers of
"bravo."

Ford, Carter strategists predict victory
Interviewed separately on a national television show,
top campaign strategists for Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford
each claimed that his man has the momentum now and
will win.
Democratic national chairman Robert Strauss said Car
ter would collect between 335 and 345 electoral votes,
comfortably more than the 270 needed for victory. Ford's
campaign manager, James A. Baker 111, said he thought the
president would win. "It'll be close," Baker said, but
would not estimate how many electoral votes Ford would
take.
Ford's windup barnstorming tour of the country put
him in California — one of a handful of populous states
which campaign strategists on both sides have pegged as
perhaps pivotal in the Nov. 2 election.
Carter spent yesterday at home in Plains, Ga., and plan
ned to stay there today before setting out on his own final
push that will take him to the West Coast and back before
election day.

Rhodesian blacks vow more violence
Geneva — Two key Rhodesian black leaders vowed
yesterday to step up the guerrilla waragainst Prime Minis
ter lan Smith's white regime despite talks here intended to
bring about black majority rule.
Joshua Knomo, who heads the leading black nationalist
political group inside Rhodesia, and Robert Mugabe, who
speaks for the most militant army of Rhodesian guerrillas,
also reiterated to journalists in separate arrival statements
that U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's peace plan
for Rhodesia is unacceptable to them.
Rhodesian Foreign Minister P.K. Van Der By 1 later told
reporters that in view of the differences and confusion, "it
might well be useful" for Kissinger to come to Geneva to
clarify things.
Ford, Carter strategists predict victory
Interviewed separately on a national television show,
top campaign strategists for Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford
each claimed that his man has the momentum now and
will win.
Democratic national chairman Robert Strauss said Car
ter would collect between 335 and 345 electoral votes,
comfortably more than the 270 needed for victory. Ford's
campaign manager, James A. Baker 111, said he thought the
president would win. "It'll be close," Baker said, but
would not estimate how many electoral votes Ford would
take.
Ford's windup barnstorming tour of the country put
him in California — one of a handful of populous states
which campaign strategists on both sides have pegged as
perhaps pivotal in the Nov. 2 election.
Carter spent yesterday at home in Plains, Ga., and plan
ned to stay there today before setting out on his own final
push that will take him to the West Coast and back before
election day.
Arson claims 25 in Bronx nightclub fire
New York — An arsonist set a fire in the only stairway to
a second story Puerto Rican social club in the South Bronx
during a festive party early yesterday and 25 persons died
in a panicky surge for safety. There were 24 injured, many
leaping from windows to avoid the flames.
"There was only one exit," a fire department spokesman
said, adding that this accounted for the panic and high
loss of life, worst of its kind in the city in a decade.
Three slain in South African protest
Johannesburg, South Africa — Police armed with shot
guns opened fire on demonstrators at a Soweto cemetery
yesterday, killing three persons, a senior police official
said. He reported 51 were injured.
Police also fired on a smaller crowd in the all-black
Soweto township, 10 miles south of Johannesburg,
wounding four blacks, according to Deputy Police Com
missioner D.J. Kriel.

The latest casualties raised the toll from black protests
against the white-minority government to at least 344
persons killed and more than 2000 wounded since June.
Arab summit to focus on Lebanon
Cairo — Arab kings and presidents meet in a summit
conference today to ratily a new peace agreement on
Lebanon that has already been undermined by the warring
factions.
The agreement was reached at a minisummit in Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia, last Monday that brought together six Mos
lem leaders involved in the Lebanese conflict. The full
summit of all 21 Arab League members was to confirm the
pact and fill in a few details.
Instead, as so often has happened in the 18-month-old
civil war, battlefield developments have overtaken the
elaborately-constructed political pact. Now the summit
will have to focus first on violations of the agreement
instead of merely giving its seal of approval.
Archbishop calls for resistance to Pope
Friedrichshafen, West Germany — Cheers rose from a
congregation of about 10.000 yesterday when
traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre called on
Roman Catholics around the world to resist Pope Paul VI.
The church should return to "true Catholic belief," the
French archbishop said in his 1 '/2-hour speech preceeding
the first Latin Mass he has celebrated in public since he
met with the Pope on Sept. 11.
"The destruction of the Catholic faith is proceeding
under orders of the hierarchy," said Archbishop Lefebvre,
who was interrupted repeatedly by applause and cheers of
"bravo."
