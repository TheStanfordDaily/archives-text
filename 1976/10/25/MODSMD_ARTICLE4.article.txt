# Berk's return divides USE

### Pan Demetrakakes 
When Jim Berk, former United Stan
ford Employees (USE) president
joined the union's negotiating team
Thursday such controversy erupted
within the union that, according to a
high union source, "USE's future may
hang in the balance."
Two members of USE's negotiating
team walked out of a bargaining ses
sion Thursday in protest of Berk's join
ing the team, and his presence has
brought an anti-USE petition to within
10 signatures of the number needed to
force a vote by university workers on
decertifying USE.
Berk was elected to the negotiating
team last week by USE's contract rep
resentatives, who represent the vari
ous unit divisions of USE's member
ship.
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
worker Richard Gross, who is helping
circulate the petition, said that on Fri
day 25 signatures were added by
people who objected to Berk's pre
sence on the negotiating team.
"People feel more comfortable with
Berk out of the union," Gross con
tended.
He said that although the decertifi
cation petition has been in circulation
for several months, it was revitalized
by the flap over Berk.
Gross also said that the petition
probably would have the required
number of signatures by today, after
which it would go to the National
Labor Relations Board. If the Board
certifies the petition, university work
ers will vote on whether they want
USE to represent them. A simple
majority would be needed to remove
USE's certification.
A high union source said that sig
ners of the petition fall into three

categories: workers who are not USE
members, USE members who dislike
the contract accepted Tuesday and
USE members who dislike Berk.
"You have pro-union people and
anti-union people signing the same
petition," the source commented. "It's
a strange coalition."
On Thursday night. Asst. President
William Reynolds and negotiator
Damir Ibrisimovic walked out of a
session devoted to negotiating minor
language changes in the university
contract already accepted but not yet
signed by USE's membership.
Ibrisimovic said he walked out of the
session because "I don't think (Berk)
should be using the negotiating team
to get back his power.
"If we got more from management
he would take the credit for it," Ib
risimovic said.
Berk denied that he was making a
bid for power. However, he admitted
that he has had differences with the
negotiating team.
"They bungled the management of
the negotiations," Berk charged.
"They waited to see what the univer
sity had to offer, then served it up to
the membership."
Berk said he will not consider res
igning from the negotiating team.
"They're trying to give me a kick in the
rear, and I'm not going to bend over,"
he said.
A negotiating session scheduled for
Friday was canceled because of the
walkout, and no new sessions are
scheduled, according to a high USE
source.
Chief university negotiator Douglas
Barton said the next move in re
establishing negotiations will have to
be taken by USE.

for several months, it was revitalized
by the flap over Berk.
Gross also said that the petition
probably would have the required
number of signatures by today, after
which it would go to the National
Labor Relations Board. If the Board
certifies the petition, university work
ers will vote on whether they want
USE to represent them. A simple
majority would be needed to remove
USE's certification.
A high union source said that sig
ners of the petition fall into three

categories: workers who are not USE
members, USE members who dislike
the contract accepted Tuesday and
USE members who dislike Berk.
"You have pro-union people and
anti-union people signing the same
petition," the source commented. "It's
a strange coalition."
On Thursday night. Asst. President
William Reynolds and negotiator
Damir Ibrisimovic walked out of a
session devoted to negotiating minor
language changes in the university
contract already accepted but not yet
signed by USE's membership.
Ibrisimovic said he walked out of the
session because "I don't think (Berk)
should be using the negotiating team
to get back his power.
"If we got more from management
he would take the credit for it," Ib
risimovic said.
Berk denied that he was making a
bid for power. However, he admitted
that he has had differences with the
negotiating team.
"They bungled the management of
the negotiations," Berk charged.
"They waited to see what the univer
sity had to offer, then served it up to
the membership."
Berk said he will not consider res
igning from the negotiating team.
"They're trying to give me a kick in the
rear, and I'm not going to bend over,"
he said.
A negotiating session scheduled for
Friday was canceled because of the
walkout, and no new sessions are
scheduled, according to a high USE
source.
Chief university negotiator Douglas
Barton said the next move in re
establishing negotiations will have to
be taken by USE.
When Jim Berk, former United Stan
ford Employees (USE) president
joined the union's negotiating team
Thursday such controversy erupted
within the union that, according to a
high union source, "USE's future may
hang in the balance."
Two members of USE's negotiating
team walked out of a bargaining ses
sion Thursday in protest of Berk's join
ing the team, and his presence has
brought an anti-USE petition to within
10 signatures of the number needed to
force a vote by university workers on
decertifying USE.
Berk was elected to the negotiating
team last week by USE's contract rep
resentatives, who represent the vari
ous unit divisions of USE's member
ship.
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
worker Richard Gross, who is helping
circulate the petition, said that on Fri
day 25 signatures were added by
people who objected to Berk's pre
sence on the negotiating team.
"People feel more comfortable with
Berk out of the union," Gross con
tended.
He said that although the decertifi
cation petition has been in circulation
for several months, it was revitalized
by the flap over Berk.
