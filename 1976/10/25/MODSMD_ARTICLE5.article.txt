# With human billboards
## 'Yes on 14' takes to the streets 
### Karen Caesar 
The "Yes on 14" campaign commit
tee will file 22 charges today with the
state Fair Campaign Practices Com
mission and set up a "massive line of
human billboards" throughout
California as a final effort to call atten
tion to their opponents' alleged failure
to report campaign contributions,
"Yes" spokesman Will Kirkland re
vealed to the Daily last night.
Both actions are part of a "two
pronged approach to revealing the il
legality" of funds raised by the "No on
14" campaign, said another spokes
man for the "Yes" committee.
Phil Jordan, a press director for the
"No on 14" committee, said in re
sponse to the charges that "so far as I
know we're complying with the law in
every way. It would be foolish not to."
According to Kirkland, six of the 22
charges against the "No" campaign
involve "major donors" (those who
have contributed over $5000) who,
"Yes" forces have said, failed to sub
mit reports of their donations.
The "Yes" committee said the 16
other charges involve alleged failure
by the "No" committee to report fund
raising mass mailings.
Under California law, all campaign
committees must report names of
donors and each major donor must
also file a report with the secretary of
state.
Human billboards
The "Yes" campaign plans to adver
tise its cause with "human
billboards," four foot by two and a half
foot signs carried on posts. "These
human billboards are far different than

the growers' massive stationary com
mercial billboards," said Kirkland.
Six hundred "human billboards"
have been told to gather around the
Century City (Los Angeles) office of
the Chairman of the Board of the
Superior Oil Company, a corporation
that is a major contributor to the "No
on 14" campaign.
According to yesterday's San Fran
cisco Examiner and Chronicle,
$994,671.20 has been spent by oppo
nents of Proposition 14 in the period
since the initiative qualified for the
ballot, as opposed to the $243,851.59
spent by the proposition's supporters.
Spending reports
The Examiner also said that accord
ing to reports that had been filed last
month, anti-14 forces outspent the
supporters of the proposition by al
most four to one in the first filing
period.
"We are asking the state to investi
gate the charges and that the $2000
fine (for Fair Campaign Practices vio
lations) be applicable," said Kirkland.

The United Farm Workers are also
requesting that the "No" campaign not
be allowed to use funds they insist
were obtained illegally.
'Major infractions'
"We have hard evidence that shows
there are in fact major infractions of the
law," said Kirkland.
Jordan responded to United
Farm Workers leader Cesar Chavez'
statement that there is a broadcasting
ban by two networks on "No on 14"
commercials by saying that "the only
commercials that have been pulled
have been by KPIX," a CBS affiliate.
"It looks to me as though they
panicked," said Jordan. "Every major
station . . . reviews every commercial
before they run it," Jordan said. "These
ads were reviewed and accepted, and
then they pulled them."
Jordan also mentioned that the Los
Angeles Times, which ran an article
discussing the ban, found that "the
story did not stand up," and printed a
"full retraction for running that story."
