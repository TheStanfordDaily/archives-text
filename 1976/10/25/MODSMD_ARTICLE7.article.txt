# File grievance with dean
## Students revive Foley tenure issue 
### William Scott 
In response to the failure of the economics de
partment to recommend tenure for Assoc.
Economics Prof. Duncan Foley, a student liaison
committee has filed a grievance with Halsey
Royden. dean of sciences and humanities. The
Dean's Office confirmed that a number of meetings
have taken place and reported the matter was under
continuing discussion.
Bill Behn. committee member, said he expects a
written statement from the dean "in a week or
two."
The Economics Department faculty refused to
recommend Foley for tenure last Dec. 8, offering
him .1 three-year contract renewal instead, with his
tenure to be reconsidered during that period.
Bert Hickman. Economics Department chairman,
said that Royden had informed him of the student
committee's grievance but had not yet made any
direct requests for information. Hickman added
that the department had "no plans to reconsider
Foley's case."
Controversial
According to Behn the grievance requested that
Royden investigate these issues surrounding the
controversial tenure decision: the criteria by which
Foley was judged, the consistency in application of
those standards compared with other professors'

tenure cases, the extent to which teaching ability
entered into the evaluation process and the possi
bility of political discrimination against Foley.
Record and potential
Behn said the students presented an analysis to
Royden of Foley's past research record and poten
tial productivity. The analysis also examined al
leged inadequacies in the tenure decision which,
the students said, could leave decisions open to
political manipulation.
The analysis reviewed actions of individual
economic faculty over the last several years which,
the statement alleged, illustrated persistent pat
terns of political discrimination.
The Foley controversy generated student protest
last spring, with a boycott of economics classes,
teach-ins and several faculty-student meetings.
'Protect privacy'
Since the decision last December, the economics
faculty has refused to discuss specific reasons for
not offering tenure to Foley, in order to "protect the
rights of privacy of the candidate and the outside
referees, and to secure the moral obligation of each
of the faculty to state forthrightly any reservations
he may have concerning a candidate's qualifica
tions," according to a letter from Hickman to the
Daily last spring stating the official department

position.
However, according to student committee
member Behn, "Confidentiality is not an issue for
Prof. Foley. The department's failure to clarify their
reasons for postponing the tenure decision does as
much damage to his professional reputation as the
faculty claims would result from a full disclosure."
Behn stated, "The issues raised by the students
are vitally important to the academic community
and merit careful investigation by Royden. The
university must demonstrate that teaching perfor
mance is an important factor in tenure decisions
and encour.ige academic freedom by actively
guarding against political discrimination."
He explained that student participation in tenure
decisions was very limited in the Economics De
partment, as well as in most departments.
One voting student
Only one department in the School of
Humanities and Sciences has a voting student on
tenure committees, according to a Council of Presi
dents report last spring.
Last autumn the official economics faculty com
mittee to review Foley's tenure investigated Foley's
research record and solicited outside opinion of his
work and unanimously recommended his promo
tion to full professor with tenure.
