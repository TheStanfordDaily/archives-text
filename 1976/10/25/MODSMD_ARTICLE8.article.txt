# Students question tenure denial
## 
### 
Behn, et. al.

Last spring, following widespread
protest and a boycott of economics"
classes in response to the failure of the
Economics Department to recommend
Duncan Foley for tenure, students
voted to place the following resolu
tions before the economics faculty: (1)
a tenure decision must be made on
Duncan Foley and we strongly urge a
positive recommendation; (2) stu
dents should be appointed as regular
members of all faculty search, tenure
and admission committees; and (3)
student evaluations of teaching
should be made public.
The senior faculty rejected the first
resolution, simply reaffirming their
confidence in the integrity of their de
cision procedures and their judgment.
An all-faculty meeting rejected the
second resolution and voted to estab
lish a student-faculty committee to
consider the last resolution. The pub
lic minutes of the June faculty meeting
where resolutions 2 and 3 were dis
cussed clearly indicate what trans
pires when students are not present to
defend their interests.
The only significant positive re
commendation of the meeting was to
increase junior faculty participation in
departmental decisions, a right they
should have had all along. While this
is all very interesting, the faculty
meeting was called to address student
resolutions regarding student input
into departmental decisions, not to
pics posed by junior faculty.
Moreover, it was disappointing to
read the disparaging faculty remarks
about the ability of undergraduates to
evaluate teaching.
Student grievance
As a result of the failure of the
economics faculty to seriously ad
dress the issues raised by students, a
student grievance was filed with
Halsey Royden, dean of humanities
and sciences, to request an inves
tigation of the issues surrounding
the department's failure to reach a te
nure decision on Duncan Foley.
Student review of tenure evaluation
procedures in the economics depart
ment has revealed the need for impor
tant changes to encourage outstand
ing teaching and to protect academic
freedom in teaching and research.
Still, no faculty leadership has been
forthcoming on these vital issues, pos
sibly because it is difficult for faculty
to admit deficiencies without raising
embarrassing questions about past te
nure decisions including Prof. Foley's.
Obvious deficiency
The most obvious deficiency in te
nure evaluation procedures is the ab
sence, with one exception, of opera
tionally defined evaluative criteria.
Only criteria to guide comparative
evaluation of research are defined,
and even application of these criteria
leave opportunity for political dis
crimination.
Because no criteria are established
to weigh teaching relative to re
search, it is not surprising that little
weight is accorded teaching perfor
mance. Some academics privately
admit teaching is almost totally ig
nored in tenure decisions.
Political discrimination in tenure
decisions exists despite flat assertions
to the contrary by the economics fa
culty. The problem of protecting
academic freedom is more complex
than the problem of rewarding teach
ing excellence. Prof. Kenneth
Arrow (Harvard University, and
former head of the American
Economic Association Committee on
Political Discrimination) has noted
that rarely are overt signs of political
discrimination evident today since

there are more sophisticated ways to
achieve the same result.
For example, political discrimina
tion against faculty utilizing Mar
xian analytic methods is often cloaked
behind criticism posed on seemingly
professional bases. However, this
criticism does not receive closer
scrutiny by faculty because of their
ambivalence to the teaching and study
of Marxian economics.
Questionable rationale
We find that economics faculty who
have actively opposed academic free
dom in the past are the same faculty
who today raise questionable
rationale to deny tenure to Foley.
Procedural weaknesses in the te
nure process here invite manipulation
of tenure decisions on the basis of
ideological prejudice. For example,
information from Stanford faculty as
sessing the candidates record is not
compiled for careful review prior to
the faculty meeting where a tenure re
commendation is made.
Thus when the faculty meet for two
hours to reach a tenure decision, they
must.for the first time,voice their opin
ion before all their colleagues as well
as resolve any new questions of fact
not considered by tbe department's
evaluation committee.
Moreover, the voting procedure
permits as few as one or two faculty to
block a positive recommendation for
any reason as long as they offer an
explanation based upon their "profes
sional" judgment.
Time running short
Time is running short in the case of
Prof. Foley if a tenure offer is to be
made by Stanford. The student liaison
committee has therefore prepared a
petition to be circulated among stu
dents.
The petition reads: "We, the under
signed students, request that the
senior economics faculty reach a deci
sion this fall on tenure for Duncan
Foley. When Prof. Foley was
hired, the faculty promised they
would make a tenure decision by last
year, yet failed to do so. Prof.
Foley repeated his request for a deci
sion; still no action was forthcoming.
"In addition to the department's ob
ligation to Prof. Foley, the de
partment's action to postpone a tenure
decision for three years must be re
viewed because of two important is
sues raised by students last spring and
ignored by the faculty: (1) evidence
that Prof. Foley's outstanding teaching
record was not given significant
weight in the decision to postpone a
tenure recommendation; and (2) evi
dence that political discrimination led
faculty to ignore Prof. Foley's excel
lent research record.
"It is highly likely that Prof.
Foley will accept a tenured appoint
ment at another university this fall
and the department is well aware of
this fact. Yet the department persists
in simply reiterating its claim that it
has not made a decision on tenure,
only postponed it.
Even a year from now when Prof.
Foley is teaching at another uni
versity, the faculty could say the same
thing, but the statement would be as
foolish then as it has been irresponsi
ble now to fail to reach a definite deci
sion. The senior faculty must reach a
decision no later than Dec. 1 and be
accountable for the decision. Action
can no longer be postponed."
The petition will be circulated this
week.
