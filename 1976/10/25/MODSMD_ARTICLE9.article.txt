# Letters: Senate, boycott

### 
Worth the trouble
It's fair to state that most of the
Senators and would-be Senators who
ran in last week's ASSU Senate elec
tion have concluded that, to fully
savor the Stanford experience, one
must run a campaign.
Going door-to-door every night for
10nights, you havethe opportunity to
meet all kinds. As any candidate will
tell you, the supple freshmen are the
hest. They are invariably the most gul
lible — a candidate can tell them
pretty much whatever he wants about
an issue or their sexual prowess. And
they will have little to check him on.
Moreover, the little suckers almost
always vote and thus are top priority
in any serious campaign.
But mainly they are the best because
they have not yet acquired the
pseudo-sophisticated Stanford snob
bery which infects numerous conser
vative Senate candidates. Therein lies
the worst part of campaigning.
It's that "don't bother me" attitude.
They don't care that you've pawned
your mother's wedding ring to fi nance
your campaign. They don't care that
you've spent hours leafing through
Roget's Thesaurus, trying to make
your posters imply the right thing.
Cyclists dodge you in White Plaza,
and when you offer them a flyer after
knocking them down, they sneer and
mutter something about wasting
paper. Basically, they don't care about
anyone except themselves.
But what the hell, you've proved
something to yourself.
YOU'RE A WINNER.

Yes, it takes a thick skin to meet
these people day after day, night after
night, but you come home gratified
after four or five hours of knocking,
knowing that you've satiated at least a
few interested people. The warm feel
ing one gets from this experience is far
greater than the thrill of victory itself.
The satisfaction manifests itself in
other ways: the boy who rides by on
election day and cheerily says"I
voted for you" and the name-you've
forgotten-but-face-you-remember
whocomes up to you on the proverbial
Morning After and says, "Congratula
tions, Senator . . . I'm pregnant."
To all of these people you say "You
must mean my twin brother," and al
though you say it dozens of times a
day, on this occasion you really mean
it.
Long after your term in the humble
Senate is up, you'll kick your feet up
on your Ivy League Law School desk
and ask "Was it worth it all?," and
your accountant will answer "yes."

I am in the process of closing my
checking account (what there is of it) at
the Bank of America, pending public
explanation of their participation in
the Arab boycott.
Since I hardly expect a single action
to bring B of A executives to their
knees, I should like to take this time to
address those who are thinking of
doing the same: YOU ARE NOT

Protection against waste
A recent letter-writer casually
suggested scrapping certain weapons
programs, lumped them with waste,
and then commented about cutting so
cial programs to "buy more missiles."
Though emotionally appealing. I don't
feel this sort of analysis is fair.
Of course waste exists in the defense
department, but it exists everywhere.
But waste happens to be
expensive. Unfortunately, new sys
tems are needed to promote a very
worthwhile social goal — that of the
protection of the society itself.
And unfortunately, protection is
needed. The Soviet Union's domina
tion of Eastern Europe (Ford's confu
sion notwithstanding), its history of
broken agreements (like recent viola
tions of the SALT accords), its massive
military build-up over the past few
years, and its support of aggression by
Cuban imperialists in Angola all point
to the basic venality and ruthless na
ture of the Soviet regime.
It would be wise, then, to look at new
programs not in terms of the number of
admirals or generals (which is ridicul
ous), or cost overruns (which are flag
rant), but in terms of the basic social
goal of successfully protecting the
country and people. Only in these
terms can one evaluate fairly the
necessity and usefulness of new prog
rams. _ _

YOU'RE A WINNER.

Yes, it takes a thick skin to meet
these people day after day, night after
night, but you come home gratified
after four or five hours of knocking,
knowing that you've satiated at least a
few interested people. The warm feel
ing one gets from this experience is far
greater than the thrill of victory itself.
The satisfaction manifests itself in
other ways: the boy who rides by on
election day and cheerily says"I
voted for you" and the name-you've
forgotten-but-face-you-remember
whocomes up to you on the proverbial
Morning After and says, "Congratula
tions, Senator . . . I'm pregnant."
To all of these people you say "You
must mean my twin brother," and al
though you say it dozens of times a
day, on this occasion you really mean
it.
Long after your term in the humble
Senate is up, you'll kick your feet up
on your Ivy League Law School desk
and ask "Was it worth it all?," and
your accountant will answer "yes."

Protection against waste
A recent letter-writer casually
suggested scrapping certain weapons
programs, lumped them with waste,
and then commented about cutting so
cial programs to "buy more missiles."
Though emotionally appealing. I don't
feel this sort of analysis is fair.
Of course waste exists in the defense
department, but it exists everywhere.
But waste happens to be
expensive. Unfortunately, new sys
tems are needed to promote a very
worthwhile social goal — that of the
protection of the society itself.
And unfortunately, protection is
needed. The Soviet Union's domina
tion of Eastern Europe (Ford's confu
sion notwithstanding), its history of
broken agreements (like recent viola
tions of the SALT accords), its massive
military build-up over the past few
years, and its support of aggression by
Cuban imperialists in Angola all point
to the basic venality and ruthless na
ture of the Soviet regime.
It would be wise, then, to look at new
programs not in terms of the number of
admirals or generals (which is ridicul
ous), or cost overruns (which are flag
rant), but in terms of the basic social
goal of successfully protecting the
country and people. Only in these
terms can one evaluate fairly the
necessity and usefulness of new prog
rams. _ _

It's fair to state that most of the
Senators and would-be Senators who
ran in last week's ASSU Senate elec
tion have concluded that, to fully
savor the Stanford experience, one
must run a campaign.
Going door-to-door every night for
10nights, you havethe opportunity to
meet all kinds. As any candidate will
tell you, the supple freshmen are the
hest. They are invariably the most gul
lible — a candidate can tell them
pretty much whatever he wants about
an issue or their sexual prowess. And
they will have little to check him on.
Moreover, the little suckers almost
always vote and thus are top priority
in any serious campaign.
But mainly they are the best because
they have not yet acquired the
pseudo-sophisticated Stanford snob
bery which infects numerous conser
vative Senate candidates. Therein lies
the worst part of campaigning.
It's that "don't bother me" attitude.
They don't care that you've pawned
your mother's wedding ring to fi nance
your campaign. They don't care that
you've spent hours leafing through
Roget's Thesaurus, trying to make
your posters imply the right thing.
Cyclists dodge you in White Plaza,
and when you offer them a flyer after
knocking them down, they sneer and
mutter something about wasting
paper. Basically, they don't care about
anyone except themselves.
But what the hell, you've proved
something to yourself.

Protection against waste
A recent letter-writer casually
suggested scrapping certain weapons
programs, lumped them with waste,
and then commented about cutting so
cial programs to "buy more missiles."
Though emotionally appealing. I don't
feel this sort of analysis is fair.
Of course waste exists in the defense
department, but it exists everywhere.
But waste happens to be
expensive. Unfortunately, new sys
tems are needed to promote a very
worthwhile social goal — that of the
protection of the society itself.
And unfortunately, protection is
needed. The Soviet Union's domina
tion of Eastern Europe (Ford's confu
sion notwithstanding), its history of
broken agreements (like recent viola
tions of the SALT accords), its massive
military build-up over the past few
years, and its support of aggression by
Cuban imperialists in Angola all point
to the basic venality and ruthless na
ture of the Soviet regime.
It would be wise, then, to look at new
programs not in terms of the number of
admirals or generals (which is ridicul
ous), or cost overruns (which are flag
rant), but in terms of the basic social
goal of successfully protecting the
country and people. Only in these
terms can one evaluate fairly the
necessity and usefulness of new prog
rams. _ _
