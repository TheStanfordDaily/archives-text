## 
### Elizabeth Pollock 
University lawyers filed a lawsuit
Friday in the Santa Clara County
Superior Court against Gukenheimer
Enterprises a nil their wholly owned
subsidiary. Tout l)e Suite. Inc. (TDS,
Inc.), which runs the food services in
Tresidder Memorial Union.
The suit alleges that negligence on
tilt; part of TDS and its employes led to
a tire in a fryer at the Transition
cafeteria one year and a day ago.
University attorneys have checked
into the incident and found evidence
of negligence on the pa rt of TDS and its
employes, said Robert Beth, director of
insurance and risk management for the
university.
Damage from the fire was estimated
<it about $10,000. According to Dan
Williams, associate dean for student
affairs and manager of Tresidder, most
of the damage was caused by the
grease-laden smoke.
"Under the contract with TDS.
they're required to maintain their
equipment," Beth said. In September,
1075, the fire department was called to
check out smoke emissions from Tre
sidder. Beth said the firemen found a
greasy duct system. Furthermore, TDS
"knew that the thermostat was not
working properly, but failed to have it
fixed," Beth explained.
"That thermostat apparatus kept fal
ling into the grease, and they never
had it secured," Beth said.
Asst. Chief John Barr of the Stanford
Fire Department said at the time of the
lire that the thermostat on the deep fry
unit had failed to shut off.
Because of evidence that appears to
indicate TDS had failed to maintain
their equipment and keep up the pre
mises. the university has alleged that
blame for the fire lies with TDS.
The university also claimed in its
complaint that employes had been
given inadequate safety instruction
about operation of the kitchen.
Assistant staff counsel Adrian
Arima has asked for $65,596.88 in
damages, $1 in labor time and
attorney's fees and costs in the case.
Thus far, the university has been de
aling with TDS' insurance company,
Hammond and Associates in San
Francisco.
Robert Caselli. food services director
and president of TDS said. "We're
fully covered, so if we're ruled against
that's no problem."
The present night manager at the
Transition. Ed Birmingham, said that,
"every night the fryer goes through a
thorough inspection by the night man
ager." It is also cleaned two or three
times daily, he said.
In addition to the Transition. TDS
also operates the Coffee House, The
Commons in Encina. and the Political
Science Department l.ounge.
