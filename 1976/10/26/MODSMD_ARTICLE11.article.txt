# Misrepresented views set straight

When reading a diatribe of the nature of David
Brown's column on libertarianism (Daily. Oct. 1H),
the overwhelming temptation is to reply in kind, to
create gross and simplistic caricatures of one's op
ponent's positions and, since his solutions involve
various governmental intrusions in private ac
tivities. point to a list of well-known boondoggles
and disasters associated with public programs. 1
could say these failures are the inevitable results of
my opponent's policies which, if continued, will
lead to the apocalyptic conclusion my enlightened
foresight tells me will be played out in the near
future.
The obvious conclusion is that Brown and those
who hold similar views are unrealistic Utopian
idealists, misinformed nincompoops, or misan
thropes intentionally foisting a plan for disaster
upon an unwitting public.
But such a polemic is inappropriate to use in
what is supposed to be a forum for reasoned public
debate.
The purpose of this reply is to provide an accu
rate statement of libertarian principles and policies
for those who are unfamiliar with libertarianism
and may have been misled by Brown's distortions
and innuendos.
Consumer protection
Start with consumer protection. Libertarians do
not say that the government "has no business pro
tecting the consumer." The libertarian position is
that protection against fraud, negligence, etc. is
most properly provided by a well-designed liability
system which specifies penalties sufficient to dis
courage such activities.
One virtue of this system is that enforcement
response would be proportional to the severity of
the problem. In addition, an incentive is provided
for the policing of product characteristics by those
parties to whom relevant information is the
cheapest and most accessible, namely the produc
ers and consumers involved.
A second virtue of a liability solution is that con
sumer choice is preserved. Many people, when
they are allowed to choose, will often pick the
cheaper product with its attendent higher risks.
This loss of choice in a world of federally-mandated
sizes, shapes, and price-quality combinations is a
significant cost to the consumer, a factor missing

from Brown's social calculus.
In addition, the fact that honesty and quality
would provide a competitive advantage in a dis
honest market will insure that most firms will pro
vide these characteristics.
It should be obvious that tin; federal Drug Ad
ministration is just a specialized consumer protec
tion agency. It cannot be disputed that
Thalidomide was a catastrophe. But disasters will
be a feature of the world regardless of the gov
ernmental system. What we should be concerned
with art; relative costs and benefits.
A study by a I Jniversity ol (Chicago economist indi
cates that the costs in terms of lives lost and pain
prolonged due to the regulatory delay in the mar
keting of new drugs outweighs the gains accruing
from the identification of those that may be harm
ful.
Brown doubts that a free market medical system
would lower prices and that most consumers could
cope with the choices if it did.
Parallel escalation
One would have to be naive to believe that the
parallel escalation of medical costs and govern
ment participation in tin? medical industry are un
related. It is widely recognized that the American
Medical Association has been effective in restrict
ing entry and raising prices. It is also true that tin;
nature of the restrictions is legal and governmen
tal Iv enforced. The elimination of such federal in
tervention leading to increased competition and
reduced prices is a reasonable expectation.
Many medical functions can be performed by
trained personnel without medical degrees. True
there will be charlatans, but they also exist under
the present system. Libertarians do not share
Brown's bel ief that with t he except ion of a n intel li
gent minority, consumers of medical services lack
the deductive capacity to distinguish between cer
tified physicians and medicine-show quacks. And
it an individual settles on a higher-risk, lower-cost
alternative, the choice should be his.
Likewise libertarians do not buy the argument
that people taken individually are an intemperate
and irrational bunch incapable of controlling con
sumptive urges. Nor do they believe it may be
necessary to set up an apparatus to forciblv extract
that which they have neither the foresight nor self-

control to voluntarily set aside tor retirement and
charitable purposes.
Contrary to what Brown would have one believe,
there are no promises of overnight solutions to
economic problems. What is stated is that private
solutions are preferable on purely economic;
grounds, even it considerations of personal free
dom are ignored.
Private solutions are preferred because: (1) they are
taster, because recognition and implementation
lags are generally shorter), and (2) they are more
efficient, because governmental responses are not
subject to t he discipline of a profit constraint so that
the relative cost of various solutions is often ig
nored.
Market forces
Market forces will terminate an inappropriate
private response while governmental mistakes may
be perpetuated indefinitely. High prices (as in fuel
and power) reflect genuine scarcity, and to sup
press them destroys a natural incentive to conserve
an increasingly scarce resource and develop alter
natives.
Libertarians do not say that industrialists will not
conspire to raise prices, but that conspiracies have
been historically unstable and their effect on the
consumer has been negligible at most.
What libertarians promise is that productivity
and average incomes will be higher in an unfettered
market system. This is not to be construed as a
guarantee of increased material prosperity for every
individual.
It is libertarians' responsibility to state clearly the
philosophical difference which separates them
from the adherents of all other political
philosophies.
In opposition to all others who subvert the indi
vidual to some vaguely defined collective good,
libertarians hold that each individual is an inviola
ble entity. A government has no legitimate powerto
alter his activities, provided he doesn't use coer
sion (including fraud) to influence another per
son's behavior. One may have other sufficient
reasons tor voting for libertarian party candidate
Roger MacHride, but this is the libertarians' mison
d' at re.
