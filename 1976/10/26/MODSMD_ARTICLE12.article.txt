He arrived quietly, without secret
service agents leading the way or tele
vision crews trailing behind. The
campaign bus full of Broders, Restons,
Whites and Witcovers had disap
peared. They were all following
another fellow now.
Last week in a storefront Democratic
headquarters in San Leandro, hardly
anyone noticed the tall former basket
ball player when he first entered the
room, even though he was the guest of
honor. Morris k. Udall (D.-Ariz), the
man who first called Jimmy Carter
"fuzzy" on the issues, shook a few
hands, smiled at some familiar faces,
and waited to be introduced to speak
on behalf of local Democratic candi
dates, and the Carter-Mondale ticket.
It was clearly not very easy for I Jdall
to be supporting the man whom he had
campaigned so long and hard against.
"It hurts a little bit, he admitted,
"but I don't take; back all that I said
about him during the campaign . . . I'd
be a hypocrite."
The question seemed to narrow
down to a choice between bad and
above-average candidates. "I don't
get 100 per cent from Carter. I 00
per cent on some issues, HO or 90 per
cent on others, but from Ford I get no
thing." said I id,ill.
He still openly disagreed with his
party's nominee. "My position is still
•better than Carter's (on many issues)"
he declared. "Carter says he is for
Humphrey-Hawkins, but Ik? hasn't
pushed it."
Health insurance
"He says be is for national health
insurance but will not tell us whether
there is going to be a rolefor the private
insurance companies. But Ford isn't
for any national health insurance. Ford
isn't for employment programs except
under his old-fashioned doctrines.
Ford is bad news on everything 1 be
lieve in." concluded Udall.
Udall devised a method of selection
which overcame any doubts about the
Democratic ticket. He called it the
"Udall two-minute truth test."
Take a piece of paper, and in front ot
a mirror write down the three issues
which are most important to you
whatever they may be, nuclear power.

the arms race, womens rights, prob
lems in the cities, defense, environ
ment — whatever it is, write them
down, and then look up into the mir
ror. and say "I think Cerald Ford is
going to do just as good as Carter in
these areas' and if you can say it with a
straight face, then go ahead and vote
for him . . . but I don't think anybody
can."
After the speech, when the reception
ended, several of Udall's former
California campaign aides accom
panied him to his hotel to drink a
couple of beers and reflect on the fond
memories of a hard fought campaign.
Honesty
He was t lit? only other candidate be
sides Carter who had started in New
Hampshire and made it to Madison
SquareCarden. But Udall was not your
run-of-the-mill presidential candi
date. He didn't have that all
consuming hunger for power. His per
sonal life was too important to him. 1 le
liked to write his own speeches. He'd
written two books, not campaign
propaganda, but highly-respected
classroom texts. He was honest.
He would tell liberals that he op
posed gun control and oil company
executives that he favored divestiture,
lie had something most candidates
lacked; a terrific sense of humor. And
he wasn't afraid to poke fun .it himself.
More than anything else, unlike so
many politicians and power seekers,
deep down. Udall is a good, decent
human being. Maybe that is why he
lost.
Or maybe his staff failed him. They
spent as much time and energy fight
ing each other, as they did planning
the candidate's schedule. The national
campaign went through three different
managers, one who served at two diffe
rent times.
Mistakes
In California alone, there were three
different state coordinators, each new
one worse than the last. Mistakes in
judgment were common. It was de
cided to campaign in Arkansas and
Tennessee instead of California and
Oregon. But no one would ever admit
to making the decision.
The money was tight. Ford, by his

delay in signing the legislation which
would have opened up the matching
funds, assured that the campaign
committee remained penniless during
some of the most critical moments.
Not surprisingly. Udall was unwil
ling lo spend his time looking back.
Sure, he allowed for a few "what if's"
that might have changed a half
percentage poi nt in Michigan, or a few
thousand votes in Wisconsin or New
Hampshire. But he was looking ahead
to the next session of Congress, to a
new committee chairmanship, to a
new strip mining bill, to a land man
agement act, and to another look at
political reform legislation.

work, couldn't help but look a little bit
farther ahead.

"It's reassuring to know that someone
like him could come so close," con
fided one staffer. "It gives us a little
hope for this system."
And if he could come so close the
first time around, why not try again?
What if Carter happened to lose? Why
not Udall in 1980? Why shouldn't a
creative, warm, decent person be in the
White I louse?
Udall truth test or not, these ques
tions made it very difficult for these
former staffers to think of voting for
Carter. But as the group broke up.
everyone quietly acknowledged that
they would probably vote for Carter,
because, after all, Udall is the kind of
person who would want them to do so.
(During the presidential primary
cam pa i gn, Jeff Klein was Udall's
California press secretary. He is noiv a
first-year law student at Stanford.)

Honesty
He was t lit? only other candidate be
sides Carter who had started in New
Hampshire and made it to Madison
SquareCarden. But Udall was not your
run-of-the-mill presidential candi
date. He didn't have that all
consuming hunger for power. His per
sonal life was too important to him. 1 le
liked to write his own speeches. He'd
written two books, not campaign
propaganda, but highly-respected
classroom texts. He was honest.
He would tell liberals that he op
posed gun control and oil company
executives that he favored divestiture,
lie had something most candidates
lacked; a terrific sense of humor. And
he wasn't afraid to poke fun .it himself.
More than anything else, unlike so
many politicians and power seekers,
deep down. Udall is a good, decent
human being. Maybe that is why he
lost.
Or maybe his staff failed him. They
spent as much time and energy fight
ing each other, as they did planning
the candidate's schedule. The national
campaign went through three different
managers, one who served at two diffe
rent times.
Mistakes
In California alone, there were three
different state coordinators, each new
one worse than the last. Mistakes in
judgment were common. It was de
cided to campaign in Arkansas and
Tennessee instead of California and
Oregon. But no one would ever admit
to making the decision.
The money was tight. Ford, by his

delay in signing the legislation which
would have opened up the matching
funds, assured that the campaign
committee remained penniless during
some of the most critical moments.
Not surprisingly. Udall was unwil
ling lo spend his time looking back.
Sure, he allowed for a few "what if's"
that might have changed a half
percentage poi nt in Michigan, or a few
thousand votes in Wisconsin or New
Hampshire. But he was looking ahead
to the next session of Congress, to a
new committee chairmanship, to a
new strip mining bill, to a land man
agement act, and to another look at
political reform legislation.

Last week in a storefront Democratic
headquarters in San Leandro, hardly
anyone noticed the tall former basket
ball player when he first entered the
room, even though he was the guest of
honor. Morris k. Udall (D.-Ariz), the
man who first called Jimmy Carter
"fuzzy" on the issues, shook a few
hands, smiled at some familiar faces,
and waited to be introduced to speak
on behalf of local Democratic candi

to be supporting the man whom he had
campaigned so long and hard against.
"It hurts a little bit, he admitted,

The question seemed to narrow

campaign went through three different
managers, one who served at two diffe

Mistakes
In California alone, there were three
different state coordinators, each new
one worse than the last. Mistakes in
judgment were common. It was de
cided to campaign in Arkansas and
Tennessee instead of California and
Oregon. But no one would ever admit
to making the decision.
The money was tight. Ford, by his

delay in signing the legislation which
would have opened up the matching
funds, assured that the campaign
committee remained penniless during
some of the most critical moments.
Not surprisingly. Udall was unwil
ling lo spend his time looking back.
Sure, he allowed for a few "what if's"
that might have changed a half
percentage poi nt in Michigan, or a few
thousand votes in Wisconsin or New
Hampshire. But he was looking ahead
to the next session of Congress, to a
new committee chairmanship, to a
new strip mining bill, to a land man
agement act, and to another look at
political reform legislation.

farther ahead.

"It's reassuring to know that someone
like him could come so close," con
fided one staffer. "It gives us a little
hope for this system."
And if he could come so close the
first time around, why not try again?
What if Carter happened to lose? Why
not Udall in 1980? Why shouldn't a
creative, warm, decent person be in the
White I louse?
Udall truth test or not, these ques
tions made it very difficult for these
former staffers to think of voting for
Carter. But as the group broke up.
everyone quietly acknowledged that
they would probably vote for Carter,
because, after all, Udall is the kind of
person who would want them to do so.

cam pa i gn, Jeff Klein was Udall's
California press secretary. He is noiv a
first-year law student at Stanford.)

He arrived quietly, without secret
service agents leading the way or tele
vision crews trailing behind. The
campaign bus full of Broders, Restons,
Whites and Witcovers had disap
peared. They were all following
another fellow now.
Last week in a storefront Democratic
headquarters in San Leandro, hardly
anyone noticed the tall former basket
ball player when he first entered the
room, even though he was the guest of
honor. Morris k. Udall (D.-Ariz), the
man who first called Jimmy Carter
"fuzzy" on the issues, shook a few
hands, smiled at some familiar faces,
and waited to be introduced to speak
on behalf of local Democratic candi
dates, and the Carter-Mondale ticket.
It was clearly not very easy for I Jdall
to be supporting the man whom he had
campaigned so long and hard against.
"It hurts a little bit, he admitted,
"but I don't take; back all that I said
about him during the campaign . . . I'd
be a hypocrite."
The question seemed to narrow
down to a choice between bad and
above-average candidates. "I don't
get 100 per cent from Carter. I 00
per cent on some issues, HO or 90 per
cent on others, but from Ford I get no
thing." said I id,ill.
He still openly disagreed with his
party's nominee. "My position is still
•better than Carter's (on many issues)"
he declared. "Carter says he is for
Humphrey-Hawkins, but Ik? hasn't
pushed it."
Health insurance
"He says be is for national health
insurance but will not tell us whether
there is going to be a rolefor the private
insurance companies. But Ford isn't
for any national health insurance. Ford
isn't for employment programs except
under his old-fashioned doctrines.
Ford is bad news on everything 1 be
lieve in." concluded Udall.
Udall devised a method of selection
which overcame any doubts about the
Democratic ticket. He called it the
"Udall two-minute truth test."
Take a piece of paper, and in front ot
a mirror write down the three issues
which are most important to you
whatever they may be, nuclear power.

the arms race, womens rights, prob
lems in the cities, defense, environ
ment — whatever it is, write them
down, and then look up into the mir
ror. and say "I think Cerald Ford is
going to do just as good as Carter in
these areas' and if you can say it with a
straight face, then go ahead and vote
for him . . . but I don't think anybody
can."
After the speech, when the reception
ended, several of Udall's former
California campaign aides accom
panied him to his hotel to drink a
couple of beers and reflect on the fond
memories of a hard fought campaign.
Honesty
He was t lit? only other candidate be
sides Carter who had started in New
Hampshire and made it to Madison
SquareCarden. But Udall was not your
run-of-the-mill presidential candi
date. He didn't have that all
consuming hunger for power. His per
sonal life was too important to him. 1 le
liked to write his own speeches. He'd
written two books, not campaign
propaganda, but highly-respected
classroom texts. He was honest.
He would tell liberals that he op
posed gun control and oil company
executives that he favored divestiture,
lie had something most candidates
lacked; a terrific sense of humor. And
he wasn't afraid to poke fun .it himself.
More than anything else, unlike so
many politicians and power seekers,
deep down. Udall is a good, decent
human being. Maybe that is why he
lost.
