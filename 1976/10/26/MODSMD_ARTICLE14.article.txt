# The 						views they are a changin'
## 
### Martin Kernberg 
In the 1970'5, a Daily survey
of Stanford students would still
convince Prince kropotkin that
educated youth is as "unrecep
tive, infected, and corrupted" as
the youth of nineteenth century
Russia. Stanford students, in
spite of California's temptations,
are still truly incapable of re
nouncing the tradition of scho
larly learning. However, the
number of undergraduates who
see "the necessity of revolutio
nary activity" are as rare as roy
ally born Russian anarchists. In
10 years, the campus has moved
from the Section of David Har
ris. an American
anarchist. as student
body president to the endorse
ment of the Hammer and Coffin
slate as ASSIJ senators.
The pronounced shift from so
cial involvement to scholastic
commitment at Stanford has
been a part of a growing national
trend on college campuses from
to 1976. A series of exten
sive interviews with Stanford
undergraduates probed three
major questions about this back
to-the-books trend: What are its
main characteristics? What are
the sources of its growing
strength? What does the future
hold for campus political or
ganizations and student ac
tivism in local and national af
fairs?
Thirty students randomly
selected from all four classes
were interviewed on these ques
tions during the first two weeks
of October.

Six major aspects of the new
mood of political abstinence
emerged from these interviews
and characterized the forces
shaping the change.
—A shift from international
and national issues to those of
the campus alone. Kick Morrow,
a senior majoring in economics
and an ASSU senate candidate
(subsequently elected), was one
of the four students in our sam
ple who was participating in
some form of political activity.
His platform reflected the shift to
exclusively campus issues: the
threatened suspension of Band
leaders for library disruptions,
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
scandal, the hiring of three radi
cal guest professors by the
ASSU. and the senate opposition
tcj the Big Game bonfire. He
termed his position and con
cerns the "realist" perspective;
with respect to broader univer
sity issues, not to speak of
national problems, he asked de
spairingly. "What can you do?"
Only one of the freshmen (17
were interviewed) was involved
in national politics (as part of the
Carter campaign); Craig kensek
underscored that this would be
his "one chance in college" to
participate in national politics.
—The restriction of political
participation to voting. Twenty
five of the 30 students had regis
tered to vote, either in California
or in their home states. However,
the only interview subjects en
gaging in political activity above
this level were three candidates
for ASSU Senate and kensek,
working for Carter.
—The decline of political lit
eracy. Four undergraduates of
the 30 attended the Sept. 28
Bishop Auditorium debate on
the Issues of the '76 Elections
and only four undergraduates
were able to list and discuss the
major state and national cam
paign policy conflicts (for
example. Proposition 14. na
tional energy policy. SALT II
negotiations, Mid-Eastern arms
sales). Freshmen comments are
fairly represented by the
analysis of the defense budget by
a newly-arrived native of
Hawaii, "Present defense ex
penditures are necessary to en
sure the security of the nation. Of
1 / freshmen, not one could give
a detailed analysis of any piece

of pending national legislation.
Students' lack of political
knowledge was reflected in the
argument of information they
had access to. While regular sub
scribers to the Son Francisco
Chronicle and the New York
Times could be found at Synergy
and Columbae, the dependence
on the Daily as a sole source of
political information was pre
dominant. Among those inter
viewed, Subscriptions to such
specialized political journals as
Commentary, the London
Economist, New Politics, the No
tion, or Monthly Review were
entirely absent.
—The rejection of political
ideologies. All 30 interviewees
described themselves as a com
bination of the following terms:
"pragmatic," "realistic," "inde
pendent," "moderate," left- or
right- "of center." or "leaning
toward" the Democratic or Re
publican Party. At Columbae,
sophomore Dave Thorn de
scribed the pclitical orientation
of the house as predominantly
"democratic and liberal" with
few individuals rigidly commit
ted to any radical doctrine, con
trary to campus mythology.
Within the eligible freshman
sample. 13.4 percent were regis
tered as Democrats. 26.8 percent
were registered as Republicans.
33 per cent enrolled as indepen
dents. and 20.8 per cent had not
bothered to register. Thus, inde
pendence and indifference car
ried nearly 60 per cent of the
eligible freshmen. Surprisingly,
five of the students polled ex
pressed an interest in libertarian
thought and anarchism, but
were reticent to be counted as
advocates of such movements.
—The apposition of scholastic

and social involvement. Politi
cal involvement was perceived
as being outside of, if not a hin
drance to, the educational pro
cess. Barbara Smith, who had
not registered because she
"didn't know enough about the
issues," underscored that politi
cal activities were a nuisance:
"we're here to learn." Pam
Miles, a freshmen from Mas
sachusetts. noted that the pre
medical society meeting was
scheduled at the same time as
the second Ford-Carter debate —
she attended the society's intro
ductory meeting.
—Personal over social con
cerns. TheDoily's interview sub
jects. without exception, placed
increased emphasis on their
immediate personal environ
ment (housing, parking space,
sports facilities, social life. food,
courses, grading policies, fa
culty recommendations among
others) at the expense of univer
sity or outside social concerns.
As sophomore Dave Thorn of
Columbae noted. "I was sur
prised at the political apathy as a
freshman. Now, I understand
and sympathize with students
who are willing to put up with a
certain number of outside prob
lems to secure entrance to law.
medical, and graduate schools,
though I don't endorse it."
According to Dan Howard (a
senior at Theta \i). Stanford stu
dents underwent an enormous
change as the threat of the draft
vanished, "Activists like David
Harris and Steven Hayes were
elected to the Council of Presi
dents on national issues, on
questions of civil rights and the
Vietnam war. In The last four
years, the issues that affect the
national community have

become irrelevant; they no
longer directly affect the indi
vidual student."

The Daily survey seems to
have invalidated Aristotle's
claim that "man is by nature a
civic animal." What are the
forces that have shaped these
new characteristics of student
behavior? Several of the stu
dents interviewed said they had
given a great deal of thought to
the underlying determinants
behind the profound change in
student attitudes since 11)72.
Students focused on major in
fluences which ranged in scope
from the impact of international
events to the more subtle role of
family structure in the post-
Korean War era.
These were among t he reasons
students cited for a decline of
political activism:
—The affluence of Stanford
students. Most of the economic
problems that have extensive
state or national repercussions
do nol immediately concern
Stanford students: the recession
of 1973-75, metropolitan
double -digit unemployment, the
flight of business and industry
from the Northeast, the urban
fiscal crisis, rent control, deregu
lation of natural gas. inflationary
reduction of wages, escalating
food costs, labor strife in agricul
ture and industry, taxation pol
icy.
Susan O'Hara. a junior major
ing in political science and
economics, argued that "afflu
ence is one of the factors behind
the decrease in interest in the
'real world,' and the increase in
interest in student politics.
Them are students, however.

with interests in the outside
world; again, affluence plays an
interesting role. Like many un
dergraduates at Stanford from
business backgrounds, Nan
Raney, a first-year student, is a
registered Republican. She did
not participate in national poli
tics before college, nor does she
intend to in college; yet, she felt
strongly about Proposition 14
(the Agricultural Labor
Relations-Initiative Statute),
which proponents claim will
ensure labor peace in the fields.
"My father used to be a grapef
ruit grower but was forced to
leave the business as a result of
the jump in labor costs due to
unions. 1 think Cesar Chavez is a
hypocrite. Class war is a bunch
of crap. I'm against Proposition
14."
—Post-baby boom narcissism.
One of the more intriguing
suggestions behind the decline
in social interests was proposed
by O'Hara: "The baby boom
which started after the Second
World War ended with the close
of the Korean War. After the end
of the baby boom, many families
had a single child; this child re
ceived extensive, if not exces
sive. attention. This is one of the
origins of the self-centered at
titude found on campus."
—Admissions committee sc
reening against political ac
tivists. Morrow suggested that
Fred Hargadon. dean of admis
sions. has refashioned selection
policies to avoid the radical
orientation of college under
graduates in the late 1960'5.
Classes here, according to this
view, had thus become systemat
ically less radical. Morrow noted
the end result by 1975 "was that
everyone in my dormitory was

extremely religious or conserva
tive."
—The futility of political ac
tivity. The basic conclusion
drawn by m;iny undergraduates
about the enormous exertions of
their predecessors here and
elsewhere was that the student
movement had demonstrated
the hopelessness of social ac
tivism. Organizing. pam
phleteering. teach-ins, sit-ins,
demonstrations, class boycotts,
building occupation, draft resis
tance. and harassment of milit
ary recruiters. Such forms of pro
test could not reform, much less
revolutionize, either the institu
tions of the university or the na
tion.
Meg Durvin. a junior majoring
in human biology from Los
Angeles, recalled her older sis
ter's experience in student and
national politics: "I was deeply
influenced by my sister's experi
ence in college. The cynicism
that developed as a result of the
failure to change fundamental
institutions rubbed out student
interest in politics and reduced
my own expectations about
political involvement."
—The lack of social rewards
for student activists. Students
considering political activity on
campus find few political lead
ers. perceive few social benefits,
and fear the prospect of exten
sive isolation from their non
political peers. George Dallas, a
pre-law student majoring in his
tory, pointed out that in addition
to the frustration of student poli
tics. it is "not as glamorous as in
the days of David Harris, when
being the campus radical was re
ally prestigious." As a consequ
ence. politics gains few particip
ants, he argued.

More importantly, under
graduates had a feeling that
political participation carried
serious penalties ranging from
faculty hostility in letters of re
commendation to government
discrimination in future
employment. One student re
fused to sign a Socialist Worker's
Party {SWT) petition to get SWF
candidates on the California bal
lot fearing a risk to his aspira
tions in government research
and administration. He.
nonetheless, planned to vote for
the SWT in the national elec
tions.
--Job security and pre
professional competition. The
recession of the past several
years coupled with a dwindling
college age population has had
immediate consequences on
campuses: cutbacks in graduate
school positions, contraction of
available jobs, and the competi
tion for admission to profes
sional schools of law, medicine,
business, and journalism among
others. Because of time consid
erations. the pre-professional
goals (set by all but three of our
sample) were considered in
compatible with political in
volvement. Marv I.eßlanc from
Ba*tlesville, Oklahoma de
clared that,"l'm interested in the
humanities, but my long term
sights are on journalism or law,
or some kind of professional
career. The time involved in
academic work and writing
excludes political activities,
though I wish they didn't."
—The responsiveness of univer
sity institutions. The university
seems to have shown itself suffi
ciently flexible in dealing with
the present level of student con
cerns to secure widespread stu
dent support or at least avoid
widespread student alienation:
in the recent ASSIJ elections, no
undergraduate candidate
criticizing university policy or
advocating institutional change
was elected by the student body.
Though there was concern ex
pressed by some candidates
about inadequate student influ
ence in faculty appointments, in
the board of trustees and the
Supreme Judicial Council,
sophomore Dan Livingston
commented that there was not
enough student interest to sus
tain an ASSU political effort.

Excluding military interven
tion abroad, (he economic situa-
I ion in the nation as a whole and
its effect on the university in par
ticular is the most likely vehicle
upon which outside events will
enter the campus and disturb its
present tranquility.
Given the limitations of na
tional economic resources, the
fiscal problems of private uni
versities will increase in the
coming decades. Along with
them, the painful choices to be
made about faculty hiring, tui
tion increases, scholarship sup
port. food costs, library expan
sion. housing facilities, laborat
ory space, and maintenance will
require student involvement and
activism. As the Brown Univer
sity strike in the past year illus
trated. the level of political ac
tivism has less to do with the
active ideological commitments
of a student body than with the
immediate educational envi
ronment and its irritants within
which they live their daily lives.
The success of Stanford in
securing sufficient revenue to
maintain its present level of ac
tivities and ongoing improve
ments is. therefore, the major de
terminant of political activism at
the present time. One Stanford
student wryly observed that a
major earthquake, taxing Stan
ford's resources to the breaking
point, would either produce a
revival of student politics or the
founding of the University of
California at Palo Alto: "The
answer, my friends, is not blow
ing in the wind. It's rumbling in
the ground."

"They are unreceptive to any sort of ex
treme views, incapable of renouncing the
tradition of scholarly learning. They are so
infected by an awe of authority, so corrupted
by the habit of demanding hundreds of facts
to be convinced, so accustomed to demand
ing that the path of the future of mankind be
scientifically deduced for them that any
propagandizing among the educated youth

involves a terribly unproductive waste of
time. . . . Those of the young who sincerely
seek a way out of their doubts will, on finding
out the necessary facts, inevitably come to
the same conclusion themselves on the
necessity of revolutionary activity."

Russia, speaking of college youth in the 1870's
