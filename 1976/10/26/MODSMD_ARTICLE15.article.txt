# Far from capacity
## Library use on increase 
### Dave Georgette 
If all you early-quarter red
hots are discouraged by the ap
parent overcrovvdedness of The
Meyer Undergraduate Library
(U(ILY). take heed, it's only your
imagination. "It seems to be
fairly busy." said UGLY's head
librarian. Elizabeth Salzer, "but
most students find the building
uncomfortable before it actually
gets close to capacity."
Koi instance. Salzer said a re
cent surveyof I IGLYrevealedthat
only 40 per cent ot the 1935 total
seats were occupied during one
evening.
Even though UGLY is not
close to capacity use, according
to Salzer, it has been "fairly
crowded. Usually the early part
ot fall quarter is crowded," she
said, because many of the new
and transfer students frequent

the library during this time.
Over in the Main Library, the
situation is not quite the same.
Although Ed Martinez, the night
supervisor at the Main Library,
said "every carrel has been
signed up for," he added, "This
is the least-used time of the year
for most students."
Martinez said many students
sign up for carrels in the fall
quarter because they think they
will need a place to study on
campus, and then sometimes
they do not use their carrels.
He added that "the atmos
phere at the undergraduate lib
rary" is a major reason many
students go there. "People come
here to do research, and that
work has just started," he said.
The Law Library does not offer
an alternative as a place to study
for undergrads because of li

mited space. "The reason we do
i he< k ID's is because we don't
have space for a lot of students,
said Rosalet Long, the assistant
law librarian. She said the Law
Library has about 240 carrels for
approximately 500 law students.
Undergraduates can get into
the Law Library, though. "Any
one in the Stanford community
can use any of the law library
materials,'' said Long. She said
use of the library is up this year.
"We have noticed a great in
crease this fall." stated Long.
Miil-term season will be here
in about two weeks. Salzer said
she is hopeful that there will be
no disruptive antics by students
in UGLY during mid-terms. "We
have been working in a number
of directions towards making the
libr.frv more conducive to study
ing," she said.
