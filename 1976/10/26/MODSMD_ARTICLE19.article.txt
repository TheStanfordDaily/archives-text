# Chaotic possibilities exist using electoral college
## 
### 
Washington (Al'l — At just
about this time every four years
the presidential race usually
tightens up enough to remind lis
that chaos or worse is lurking
out there in something called the
electoral college.
That is because the candidate
who carries the right combina
tion of states and wins in the
electoral college becomes presi
dent. even if the other guv gets
more popular votes.
II nobody gets a majority of the
electoral votes, then the House of

Representatives elects the presi
dent .iihl it can choose anyone it
pleases.
None of the more frightful
possibilities latent in the elec
toral college has occurred re
( ently. but they have? happened.
Each time it has brought the
country to 11 it* brink of disaster.
And that was back in the days ol
sailing ships. and not the present
nuclear tension, instant global
i omnninication and pushbutton
reaction.
It's all because when you vote

in a presidential election you
never vote for a presidential
candidate. You vote for people
who are running for membcr
shi pi n the electoral college;.
Their names may be listed in
dividually on the ballot as elec
tors for the candidate of a pol iti
cal party. Or they may be listed
as electors for the individual
candidate, who is named on the
ballot.
Some states don't name t he
electors on the ballot at all, ibut
they are still the ones you .ire

voting for, and they, in turn,
elect the president.
Elector number varies
Each state gets a number of
electors equal to its congres
sional delegation, one for each of
its two senators and one for each
House member. This ranges
from three for a small state like
Delaware to 4 5 for California.
Every presidential candidate
who has qualified for the state's
ballot is represented by bis own
slate of electors. Their actual
choice is generally left up to the

party or the candidate.
On Nov. 2 the voters in each
stale elect one of those slates.
Then, on the first Monday after
the second Wednesday in De
cember — that's I )ec. 1A this year
the winning slate in each state
meets at the state capital and
casts its votes tor president and
vice president.
Results tallied in Congress
The results will be sent to
Washington. On Jan. 6. 1077 in a
joint session of Congress Vice
President Nelson A. Rockefeller
will open the certificates from
each state and the votes will be
counted by tellers.
If one of the candidates gets a
majority of the electoral votes,
Rockefeller will declare him the
President-elect, and he will be
inaugurated on Jan. 20
But, if no one gets the majority
of electoral votes, no matter how
many popular votes he got. the
election is turned over to the
House of Representatives.
Democratic advantage
Since the House has a big
Democratic majority, it probably
would elect a Democrat as presi
dent.
Hut it could pick any native
born American citizen who has
reached the age of :i5 and has
lived in this country at least 14
years. Rather than risk 1 he public
wrath, it probably would pick
the Democratic nominee.
The House hasn't decided an
election in a long time, but it
very nearly happened in 1968
when George C. Wallace, run
ning as Iht; American Party
nominee, carried several states
and almost denied an electoral
college majority to Richard M.
Nixon, who had beaten Democ
rat Hubert 11. Humphrey and
Wallace in the popular vote.
Winner sometimes loser
It did happen in 1800. and the
House made Thomas Jefferson
president after 16 ballots. It hap
pened again in 1824 when An
drew Jackson beat John Quincy
Adams in the popular vote but
failed to get a majority of elec
toral votes in a four-man race.
The House made loser Adams
president.
Other losers have become
president because, although
I hey got fewer votes, they carried
states which added up to an elec
toral majority. Rutherford B.
Hayes in 1876 and benjamin
Harrison in 1888 were second
place finishers who became
president in this manner.

This is possible because the
states have chosen to cast their
votes in a winner-take-all bloc.
So. a candidate might carry sev
eral states by wide margins and
build up a large popular vote
majority with strong showings
in other states and still lose the
election because he fails to carry
some large states by the thinnest
margi ns.
Governing impossible
A president elected by a clique
in Congress or a quirk of the elec
toral mathematics would likely
find it almost impossible to gov
ern with any public confidence.
Every four years the question
comes up. and just as regularly it
is dropped once the election is
over. (Congressional leaders such
as Sen. birch bayh (D-Ind.). have
been trying for years to amend.
the process, but concede it may
take a national disaster before
anything is done.
This predicament was cast
upon us by the founding fathers
with the best ot intentions. Their
problem was simple enough
—no one had even elected a na
tional chief executive of a large
country before.
Responsible elite
"A small number of persons
selected by their fellow citizens
from the general mass, will be
most likely to possess the infor
mation and discernment requis
ite! to" select <i president, Ale
xander Hamilton believed.
The idea was to have the
people select the wisest and
most respectable leaders from
their midst, and this more re
sponsible elite would meet in
some grand convention to select
tin; president.
but it never worked out the
way the founding fathers plan
ned. First of all, the slate system
means voters are not even al
lowed to do what the founders
intended, that is vote for the best
men in the community on the
basis of their own merit.
The voters must take a whole
slate or nothing at all. Therefore
the outcome is predetermined
and the main reason for having
the electoral college is defeated
right at I he ballot box.
After some early near catas
trophes and the rise of political
parties, politicians quickly
learned to bind delegates to can
didates. which also defeats the
deliberative purpose of the col
lege and makes it largely a cere
mony.
