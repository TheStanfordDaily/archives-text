# Can chimpanzees predict earthquakes?

Accurate and comprehensive ear
thquake prediction still eludes mod
ern researchers, but a group of be
havioral scientists here are following
up on what they believe could be a new
and effective prediction technique.
They are proposing that chimpan
zees can predict earthquakes.
"While our evidence is not yet suffi
cient to conclude that animal behavior
will predict earthquakes, it suggests a
model tor researching the question,"
said Helena Kraemer. associate profes
sor of biostatics, one of Ihe team of
researchers at the Stanford Outdoor
Primate Facility. The researchers re
ported their findings Sunday to a
Menlo I'ark meeting sponsored by the
U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS). Also
participating in the research and
analysis were Seymour Levine, profes
sor of psychiatry and director of the
primate facility, and Bruce Smith, a
geophysicist with USGS.
Kraemer explained that observers at
the facility had noted "intriguing be
havioral changes" among the chim
panzees immediately before a cluster
of minor earthquakes last June.
Animals restless
"The animals were more restless
than usual," she reported. "They spent
more time on the ground than high on
their climbing structures and nesting
areas. Their behavior change was so
significant it seems unlikely that it was
due to chance."
Because the "Gombe East" facility
here is unlikely to experience enough

earthquakes during a reasonable time
span to confirm this earthquake pre
diction theory, the researchers have
suggest "multiple monitors... . using
perhaps less expensive animals, for
example, poultry and cattle at ranches
scattered along major faults. Trained
observers or automated behavior
monitors will be required, coupled
with computerized systems for routine
observation and data analysis."
Scientifically unsubstantiated re
ports of unusual behavior by animals
have been common in the past. Amos
Nur, associate professor of geophysics,
after conferring with Chinese scien
tists who had predicted a major ear
thquake near the city of Haicheng last
year, reported in an article in the Stan
ford Earth Scientist that during a
swarm of foreshocks preceding the
quake "many reports came from a mul
titude of villagers concerning abnor
mal behavior in their livestock."
"First scientific evidence"
"Animal behaviors can be moni
tored and reliably measured." the re
searchers said. "We believe we have
the first scientific evidence there are
behavior changes that precede ear
thquakes."
This unusual development in the
earthquake prediction field comes
only a week after the announcement ot
the formation of the nation's first Ear
thquake Prediction Council at the
lISCS Menlo Park facility.
"Ultimately our goal is to be able to
predict any potentially dangerous ear
thquake capable of damage," said Jerry

Eaton, chairman of the council."The
council represents a prototype effort
here in the central California area."
"Our network is extensive enough
now, utilizing different types of obser
vation, that we have reached a level at
which we are faced with clearly ex
pressive data, which requires that we
comment about the outcome,"
explained Eaton, emphasizing that
"the principal thing will be how cer
tain we are of the data itself, and of our
interpretation, not how sure we are
that it will occur."
Although the council will attempt to
pi edict as many earthquakes as possi
ble, no public announcements of the
predictions will be made unless the
possible earthquake has a potential
magnitude of approximately 5.5 on the
Rifchter scale. Eaton said.
"That's the level at which we feel
compelled to make a public an

nouncement ofourbest estimate of the
possibilites," he said, which includes
"a declaration of our reservations."
Among tht! various techniques used
by the council to aid their predictions
is the dilatency theory proposed by
Nur, which deal with subterranean
water levels and its effect on the creep
of faults.
Despite the theory's continuing util
ity, however. Eaton noted that "we are
finding that it is becoming harder and
harder to take that theory at face value
as it was first proposed."
Eaton said that the council perceives
its role as not being limited merely to
prediction.
"We're really wearing two hats —
we're primarily responsible for de
scribing the phenomenon of ear
thquakes correctly, but we're also vit
ally interested in how they work."
"We also keep track of other
people's work on the'consequences of
predictions — when formulating a
prediction, you need to know in ad
vance what the effect of your predic
tion will be."
Eaton pointed out that the council
also hopes to serve in an educational
sense, by "documenting (earthquakes)
in such a way that the public will come
to discriminate" between scientifi
cally based predictions and less credi
ble popular predictions.
