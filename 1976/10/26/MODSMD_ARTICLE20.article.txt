Cesar Chavez, prtjsidt;nt ol tin?
I'llited Farm Workers, was in
terviewed in the Dean's OtTit:tf oi
(lubberley Hall last Thursda> .
after his speech in the adjacent
auditorium where he urged his
listeners to vote 'Yes' on Propos
ition 14. What follows are ex
cerpts from that interview :
Daily: Are you happy with the
support you're getting from (!ov.
|erry Brown?
Chavez: Indeed ver\ happy.
I le's doing an awful lot for us.
Daily: What are your expecta
tions of (lov. Jimmy (larter if he's
elected ?
Chavez: Well. 1 think at the \ er\
least we'll he able to talk to him
about our problems, something
we have not been able to do with
the present administration. I
think at the very least we'll get
that.
Daily: II as Cov. (barter given \ on
much support?
Chavez: lie endorsed us. he en
dorsed 14 and when he's in
California he speaks favorabh
about it. Mis people are putting
out our information along with
their material.
Daily: Could you elaborate on
the charges you're bringing
against the growers?
Chavez: We're asking the State
Pair Political Practices Commis
sion to investigate what our in
vestigations reveal to lis that
the growers have not reported all
of their contributions. And we
want to know if they're hiding
illegal money. We want to know
if that money is laundered. We
want to know why they aren't
reporting the money. We have
j these questions. Could it be that
I tin? money is contributed illeg
ally? What we're saying is we're
raising the questions.

Daily: How much was it that you
said in \our speech was given by
four per cent of the contributors?
Chavez: Fifty-six per cent of
${)H4.o()n. I think what they did
is that the contributors were wel I
o\ er a mil lion so they didn't re
port it. They reported just under
a million so it wouldn't look too
bad. holding that maybe for this
next report. Hut we found sev
eral thousands of dollars that
have not been reported.
Daily: What would you say has
been vour biggest success and
biggest failure so far?
Chavez: 1 think acquainting the
\merican public with the prob
lems of the farmworkers was one
of the most important things
we've done.

Daily: And your biggest blun
der?
(Chavez: Blunder? We've run ;i
lot of them. I don't know. It's
hard to say which one, you
know, I wish I knew.
Daily: What arc; your long torm
goals over the next 5 or 10 years?
Chavez: Well, trying to use
California as a hase to organize
other workers, in other stores.
And that's going to takeall of the
next 20 years or so.
Daily: II Proposition 14 is pas
sed. how will it stop child labor?
Chavez: The best way to stop
child labor is bv havi nj> adequate
wages for the fathers and the
mothers so that the kids are not
going into the fields to augment
wages. So if 14 passes, the work

ers will be able to build a union
throught the democratic process
of secret elections, uninter
rupted. (Jetting t lit; elections and
winning the elections and get
ting certified as the collective
bargaining representative leads
to collective bargaining and it's
through collective bargaining,
really, where the change comes.
Daily: Would you be happy to
see |errv Brown run for President
again?
Chavez: Of course, you know. I
think he'd make a good presi
dent.
Daily: Did you enjoy yourself
during the Democratic; Conven
tion in New York?
Chavez: No. I did not. It was a big
burden for me. I'm not used to
those things. I did it because he
asked me, but I couldn't sleep a
week before.
Daily: I low do you tlii nk t In; vote
on 14 will go?
Chavez: I think it's pretty close. I
think we'll be i nchi ng ahead this
week and next week. We were
way up there: they were down.
Then they came with two weeks
of mass media, they spent about
half a million dollars in two
weeks and just confused
everyone. And now we're trying
to get it together and get the
word out about the private prop
erty issue. And we're gaining, so
I think we'll be up ahead at the
end of the week.
Daily: What will you be doing
during the last week?
Chavez: It's a lot ot things, not
only one tiling. There's an awful
lot of work. Basically, just very
common sense work: the
bumper stickers, the leafleting. a
lot ot street work, door to door
work, telephones and we're
going to have some media: we're
buying some time.

word out about the private prop
erty issue. And we're gaining, so
I think we'll be up ahead at the
end of the week.
Daily: What will you be doing
during the last week?
Chavez: It's a lot ot things, not
only one tiling. There's an awful
lot of work. Basically, just very
common sense work: the
bumper stickers, the leafleting. a
lot ot street work, door to door
work, telephones and we're
going to have some media: we're
buying some time.

Cesar Chavez, president of the United Farm Workers, discus
ses union ideas on relations with the state and federal govern
ments plus Proposition 14 and other issues.
Cesar Chavez, prtjsidt;nt ol tin?
I'llited Farm Workers, was in
terviewed in the Dean's OtTit:tf oi
(lubberley Hall last Thursda> .
after his speech in the adjacent
auditorium where he urged his
listeners to vote 'Yes' on Propos
ition 14. What follows are ex
cerpts from that interview :
Daily: Are you happy with the
support you're getting from (!ov.
|erry Brown?
Chavez: Indeed ver\ happy.
I le's doing an awful lot for us.
Daily: What are your expecta
tions of (lov. Jimmy (larter if he's
elected ?
Chavez: Well. 1 think at the \ er\
least we'll he able to talk to him
about our problems, something
we have not been able to do with
the present administration. I
think at the very least we'll get
that.
Daily: II as Cov. (barter given \ on
much support?
Chavez: lie endorsed us. he en
dorsed 14 and when he's in
California he speaks favorabh
about it. Mis people are putting
out our information along with
their material.
Daily: Could you elaborate on
the charges you're bringing
against the growers?
Chavez: We're asking the State
Pair Political Practices Commis
sion to investigate what our in
vestigations reveal to lis that
the growers have not reported all
of their contributions. And we
want to know if they're hiding
illegal money. We want to know
if that money is laundered. We
want to know why they aren't
reporting the money. We have
j these questions. Could it be that
I tin? money is contributed illeg
ally? What we're saying is we're
raising the questions.

Daily: How much was it that you
said in \our speech was given by
four per cent of the contributors?
Chavez: Fifty-six per cent of
${)H4.o()n. I think what they did
is that the contributors were wel I
o\ er a mil lion so they didn't re
port it. They reported just under
a million so it wouldn't look too
bad. holding that maybe for this
next report. Hut we found sev
eral thousands of dollars that
have not been reported.
Daily: What would you say has
been vour biggest success and
biggest failure so far?
Chavez: 1 think acquainting the
\merican public with the prob
lems of the farmworkers was one
of the most important things
we've done.

Daily: And your biggest blun
der?
(Chavez: Blunder? We've run ;i
lot of them. I don't know. It's
hard to say which one, you
know, I wish I knew.
Daily: What arc; your long torm
goals over the next 5 or 10 years?
Chavez: Well, trying to use
California as a hase to organize
other workers, in other stores.
And that's going to takeall of the
next 20 years or so.
Daily: II Proposition 14 is pas
sed. how will it stop child labor?
Chavez: The best way to stop
child labor is bv havi nj> adequate
wages for the fathers and the
mothers so that the kids are not
going into the fields to augment
wages. So if 14 passes, the work

ers will be able to build a union
throught the democratic process
of secret elections, uninter
rupted. (Jetting t lit; elections and
winning the elections and get
ting certified as the collective
bargaining representative leads
to collective bargaining and it's
through collective bargaining,
really, where the change comes.
Daily: Would you be happy to
see |errv Brown run for President
again?
Chavez: Of course, you know. I
think he'd make a good presi
dent.
Daily: Did you enjoy yourself
during the Democratic; Conven
tion in New York?
Chavez: No. I did not. It was a big
burden for me. I'm not used to
those things. I did it because he
asked me, but I couldn't sleep a
week before.
Daily: I low do you tlii nk t In; vote
on 14 will go?
Chavez: I think it's pretty close. I
think we'll be i nchi ng ahead this
week and next week. We were
way up there: they were down.
Then they came with two weeks
of mass media, they spent about
half a million dollars in two
weeks and just confused
everyone. And now we're trying
to get it together and get the
word out about the private prop
erty issue. And we're gaining, so
I think we'll be up ahead at the

Daily: Did you enjoy yourself
during the Democratic; Conven
tion in New York?
Chavez: No. I did not. It was a big
burden for me. I'm not used to
those things. I did it because he
asked me, but I couldn't sleep a
week before.
Daily: I low do you tlii nk t In; vote
on 14 will go?
Chavez: I think it's pretty close. I
think we'll be i nchi ng ahead this
week and next week. We were
way up there: they were down.
Then they came with two weeks
of mass media, they spent about
half a million dollars in two
weeks and just confused
everyone. And now we're trying
to get it together and get the
word out about the private prop
erty issue. And we're gaining, so
I think we'll be up ahead at the
end of the week.
Daily: What will you be doing
during the last week?
Chavez: It's a lot ot things, not
only one tiling. There's an awful
lot of work. Basically, just very
common sense work: the
bumper stickers, the leafleting. a
lot ot street work, door to door
work, telephones and we're
going to have some media: we're
buying some time.

Chavez reiterates stands
Cesar Chavez, president of the United Farm Workers, discus
ses union ideas on relations with the state and federal govern
ments plus Proposition 14 and other issues.
Cesar Chavez, prtjsidt;nt ol tin?
I'llited Farm Workers, was in
terviewed in the Dean's OtTit:tf oi
(lubberley Hall last Thursda> .
after his speech in the adjacent
auditorium where he urged his
listeners to vote 'Yes' on Propos
ition 14. What follows are ex
cerpts from that interview :
Daily: Are you happy with the
support you're getting from (!ov.
|erry Brown?
Chavez: Indeed ver\ happy.
I le's doing an awful lot for us.
Daily: What are your expecta
tions of (lov. Jimmy (larter if he's
elected ?
Chavez: Well. 1 think at the \ er\
least we'll he able to talk to him
about our problems, something
we have not been able to do with
the present administration. I
think at the very least we'll get
that.
Daily: II as Cov. (barter given \ on
much support?
Chavez: lie endorsed us. he en
dorsed 14 and when he's in
California he speaks favorabh
about it. Mis people are putting
out our information along with
their material.
Daily: Could you elaborate on
the charges you're bringing
against the growers?
Chavez: We're asking the State
Pair Political Practices Commis
sion to investigate what our in
vestigations reveal to lis that
the growers have not reported all
of their contributions. And we
want to know if they're hiding
illegal money. We want to know
if that money is laundered. We
want to know why they aren't
reporting the money. We have
j these questions. Could it be that
I tin? money is contributed illeg
ally? What we're saying is we're
raising the questions.

Daily: How much was it that you
said in \our speech was given by
four per cent of the contributors?
Chavez: Fifty-six per cent of
${)H4.o()n. I think what they did
is that the contributors were wel I
o\ er a mil lion so they didn't re
port it. They reported just under
a million so it wouldn't look too
bad. holding that maybe for this
next report. Hut we found sev
eral thousands of dollars that
have not been reported.
Daily: What would you say has
been vour biggest success and
biggest failure so far?
Chavez: 1 think acquainting the
\merican public with the prob
lems of the farmworkers was one
of the most important things
we've done.

Daily: And your biggest blun
der?
(Chavez: Blunder? We've run ;i
lot of them. I don't know. It's
hard to say which one, you
know, I wish I knew.
Daily: What arc; your long torm
goals over the next 5 or 10 years?
Chavez: Well, trying to use
California as a hase to organize
other workers, in other stores.
And that's going to takeall of the
next 20 years or so.
Daily: II Proposition 14 is pas
sed. how will it stop child labor?
Chavez: The best way to stop
child labor is bv havi nj> adequate
wages for the fathers and the
mothers so that the kids are not
going into the fields to augment
wages. So if 14 passes, the work

ers will be able to build a union
throught the democratic process
of secret elections, uninter
rupted. (Jetting t lit; elections and
winning the elections and get
ting certified as the collective
bargaining representative leads
to collective bargaining and it's
through collective bargaining,
really, where the change comes.
Daily: Would you be happy to
see |errv Brown run for President
again?
Chavez: Of course, you know. I
think he'd make a good presi
dent.
Daily: Did you enjoy yourself
during the Democratic; Conven
tion in New York?
Chavez: No. I did not. It was a big
burden for me. I'm not used to
