# Companion at Tresidder
## Band with an identity 
### Dean Eyre 
Comparaion, the ASSU
ponsored'band that performed
I the noontime concert at the
residder. Union three weeks
jo. featuries the creative talents
112 tour musicians, their man-
Jer, and their engineer with the
mphasis on individuality as
(pressed through their music,
he band consists of Ron Miller
hums), Kelly (bass), Pat
(aguire (keyboards), brother
hi Maguire(guitar). Jim Henney
oad manager), and Steve Jarvis
fccording engineer).
•Jim Maguire originally came
oin Joker, an offshoot of Steve
liller's band. He started as a
la no player and lyricist and left
)ker to devote interest to a new
lathering of musicians. The
irpup started as a "Sunday jam
ession." Jim explained that in
lit: beginning "there was no de-
Inite decision made to become a
►and formally." Pat joined Jim,
)oug, and Ron a year later.
A basic ideal has remained
vitli the bund throughout its
xistence, that of maintaining an
'(ittitude of identity" as an en
semble of musicians rather
tlian evolving into a "blown-out
sffectric biind." One can sense
[lie determination of the group's
Members in holding to this ideal,
<|r even though they have been
[inspired by various artists, the
fctjyle ol the finished product is
■ hat of the individuals of Com
panion.
p.' Pat reflected upon the de
velopment of his musical style
.aiid felt that Stevie Wonder.
►I'raffic. and Stephen Stills had
3>eisn influential performers. Pat
opted that these three in particu

lar tried to "say something in
music," a concept very similar to
that of Companion's musical go
als. Doug, bass player for the
group, thought that Yes and Pro
col Harum had developed musi
cal styles which influenced him.
Live performances
Of the three years that (-om
panion has been together, the
first two were spent in recording
sessions. The band has played
live performances for the last
year, the reverse of the usual pat
tern for groups, which com
monly start with live music and
then move to studio work. Thirty
tracks have been recorded,
awaiting the go ahead for the ac
tual release of an album, hope
fully within the next few
months.
Steve, Companion's recording
engineer, elaborated on tin? sub
ject of the studio angle of the
music industry. He commented
that he has been very receptive to
the music field, especially the
recording aspect. In accomplish
ing studio work and negotiating
a recording deal, artists end up
literally "buying time." Tre
mendous amounts of coordina
tion are required to produce an
album, because many different
aspects of the music industry
must each be aligned into one
stream of effort.
Studies and recording equip
ment are needed for the audi
tion. and an efficient marketing
program must be established to
provide publicity and booking
arrangements.
In public appearances. Com
panion has "tried its wings."
Small scale concerts are becom
ing looked upon as a wise in

vestment in today's competitive
music industry. A performance
such as the one at Tresidder
Union will help to put the name
of the group out in the open. Jim
Maguire figured that even
though the band plays for free
and puts money out for rental
and other expenses, the adver
tisement is worth it in the long
run.
Valuable exposure
If, in an audience attending
such a concert, just a few people
become interested in the band
and get to know its style of play
ing, then it has been a valuable
exposure. This kind of adver
tisement is a slow process, but
one which pays off by building
up,a following at a personal
level.
Maguire gave a musician's
perspective on the Bay Area
music scene, describing the
situation as one oriented around
the night clubs. The bands that
perform in the clubs play the
Top 40 music that is popular be
cause of its dancing possibilities
rather than its musical or lyrical
content.
The majority of the people
who come to the night clubs are
looking for a spot that features
dancing and drinking. They are
not concerned with the original
ity of the music, just so long as it
is the "boogie" sound. The
popularity of the Top 40 has
made clubs featuring disco
music financially profitable.
Owners are not going to risk
such a money-making enterprise
by hiring a non-Top 40 band.
The result of the financial dis
crimination in the night clubs is
that groups based on original

music must compote fiercely for
the few places that offer open
ings for these bands. In Berkeley,
tor example, where the music
market is almost 100
per cent disco music, the pros
sure discourages the creative
bands, The effect over the long
run will be that the favoring of
Top 40 mus'ic in clubs will deter
the creativity in music.
Varied tastes
In respect to topic of creativ
ity, Jim praises the atmosphere
of musical tastes found on col
lege campuses. Concerts in the
college community provide the
outlet for original composition
that is denied in the majority of
night clubs. Musical tastes are so
varied in a student body that a
group is fairly sure of drawing
well regardless of the position in
the music spectrum that the
musicians occupy. On a campus
such as Stanford, where the mus
ical preferences range from
Schubert to Steppenwolf and
anywhere between, the indi
viduality that groups like Com
panion seek, can exist.

The "coffeehouse days" are
gone from today's world of
large-scale performances, and
with them have gone many op
portunities for the exposure
needed for beginning artists. Jim
expressed his desire in the at
mosphere of a place 1 ikc> Juani
ta's in Marin County. In such a
location, a '70s version of the
coffeehouse, musicians are al
lowed to "do their own
number."
For the sake of individuality, it
is best to exist on that level. Play
ing in the receptive; mood of
such a place, a group can pack
the place nine out of 10 times.
The audience consists of people
who come to listen and ap
preciate the expression of the
music that is being performed.
Maguire feels that thorn is a
good chance that in five to 10
years a circle will have been
completed, bringing back the
popularity of the coffeehouse
level of music, with the impetus
of this change originating at the
colleges.
The sorry fact is that in order

to really "make it" financially in
the present-day music industry
entertainers have to resort to the
balls. Ideally, the return to
small audiences will allow the
artists to relate through their
music more effectively.
The popular groups of today
are very often "forced to follow
others." Magu ire said. Managers
and contract executives of re
cord companies cause the musi
cians to be "locked in by the
music industry." The business
can be very intense, full of
people at different levels who
"demand something in return
for favors."
In such an atmosphere, it is a
difficult t;isk to "maintain self
control" and allow yourself to
"keep your philosophy unaf
fected." From the viewpoint of
tin; members of Companion, the
music programs at Stanford offer
an opportunity for artists to es
cape from th(! industry and just
play their hearts out. Hopefully,
the campus can remain a refuge
for the individuality of the arts to
breed — with the support of the
students, it can.

Companion keeps philosophy unaffected
Companion has been inspired by many artists yet they have maintained an "attitude of identity"
as an ensemble of musicians, rather than evolving into a down-out electric band.
