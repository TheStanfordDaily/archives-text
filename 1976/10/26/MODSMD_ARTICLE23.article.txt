# Lively Arts present play about Red Purge of '50s
## 
### Meg Walker 
This Thursday the Lively Arts will present Arc
You Now or Hove You Ever Been. . .?, one of the
finest dramatic performances produced on the
Wefct Coast as well as one of the most painful
recounts of a disturbing period in American his
tory. A play with actors playing other actors in
volved in drama in an age where the
word communism meant ostracism, it's hard to
say whether Arc You Now or Have You Ever
lUrgn. . i.4J|pieant to give a political lesson or
•create a theatrical experience.
The play is a dramatic version of Eric Bentley's
hook Thirty Years of Treason; it is taken directly
Jrom the transcripts recounting the trials of House
I 'a : AmeriQin Activities Committee (HUAC) bet
ween the vears 1947-1957. Senator McCarthy's
communist scare had achieved its effect and per
meated tlu! entertainment world in a thorough
search for Communist supporters. Eleven years of
Congressional hearings resulted in the grim story
ot the Hollywood 10 — group of writers, artists
and directors who went to jail for refusing to tes
tify before the ominous Committee.
William Devane, who played John F. Kennedy
in the television drama, Missiles of October, pro
duced the play in Los Angeles, where it received
the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for
the 1075-7(> season. The play was also shown in
Washington D.C.
Devane has skillfully produced the play with
almost no stage movement; the static setting of a
Congressional hearing builds up the internal mo
tion of the play as such talented artists as Arthur
Miller. Lillian Helman. Paul Robeson. Ring Lard
ner Jr.. anrf lose Ferrer (a renowned actor appear
ing .it Stanford in January), are interrogated, "Are
you now or have you ever been ... a Com
munist?"
Moral element
A psychological and moral element enters the
play in the reaction of each actor to tin; Commit
tee's questions. At a time when taking the sth

amendment was meant as "yes, I am a Com
munist," when even guilt by association was suf
ficient to end a Hollywood career, it was not easy
to withstand the pressures of a Congressional in
terrogation. Even if the actor did cooperate with
the Committee he was labeled as an informer and
blacklisted in the Hollywood studios.
Taking the chance of being labeled as a fink or
losing an acting career, each actor responds to the
question in a different way, adding lighter mo
ments to an intense emotional trial. Arthur Miller
(originally played bv Jeff Davis) tells the trial he
will not bring trouble on another person and if
that's contempt of Congress, so be it. Lionel Stan
dor (originally played by Wyan Irwin) makes it
plain that the HUAC is made up of a bunch of
courthouse boobs.
I lowever, the traumas and pressures of the fren
zied anticommunist movement are shown in the
anguish of actor Larry Parks when he is forced and
humiliated into revealing and "informing" the
Committee of 10 names. In some eyes Parks may
deserve the harsh reputation of a "fink" by de
stroying the careers of 10 fellow actors, but De
vane, showing Parks in the role of a decent human
being trying to decide the right thing, throws the
issue to the audience. History is not incapable of
repeating itself: how much integrity do we
really have in deciding what is right and what is
wrong?
Does a play like A re You Now or I hive You Ever
Been. . . stick in our minds because of guilty re
membrances of Salem witch hunts, locking up
Japanese Americans or even recently, the Water
gate trials. The circumstances are more intense in
the HUAC trials; the Hollywood 10 had not bet
rayed their constitution; there was no crime in
volved; they had no elaborate defense counsel and
no chance of making deals for lighter prison sen
tences. Devane's play sticks in our minds because
it's so real, because it has happened again and
again in our history and no one seems to he able to
figure out why.
