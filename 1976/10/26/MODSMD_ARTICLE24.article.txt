Tonight Cine-club Italia no
will present the peninsula pre
miere of Lulu the Tool, or The
Working Class Goes to Heaven at
kresge Auditorium. (The film,
although made in 1072. has had
only a very limited release on the
West Coast.) It tells the story of a
factory worker named Lulu who
must cope with the demands of
his bosses and his union while
trying to keep his sanity amid
t he insane working conditions of
his factory.
The workers are paid accord
ing to how much they produce
(called "piecework") and the
plot revolves around Lulu and
the efforts to change the wage
procedure. Gian Maria Volonte
plays Lulu and Mariangela
Melato (the girl on Swept Away,
The Seduction ofMimi and Love
and Anarchy) portrays his
girlfriend.
Lulu's dilemma
Lulu is caught between a
group of socialist students, who
beleaguer the workers at the
gates of the factory every morn
ing with bullhorns and cries of
worker-student unity and re
volution; the union leaders, who
want to raise the piecework
pay-rate but keep the system; the
factory management, who want

to keep the pay as low as possi
ble; and his girlfriend, who can
not understand why he lets all
the outside forces trouble him.
Lulu is a thoughtful, emotional
man. who, being the fastest
worker at the factory, is loved by
the management and despised
by his co-workers.
I le loses a finger in an indust
rial accident, however, and his
political apathy turns to support
lor the students. The companv
fires him, he goes to the students
who soon desert him, and even
tually the union leaders, while
selling-out the workers, get Lulu
rehired.
Lulu returns to the factory
dazed by the constant harass
ment he has received and the ad
vice of an old, crazy friend in an
insane asylum who used to work
at the factory. "If you want to go
mad. just return to the factory."
the old man told him.
Lulu won't go mad. though,
for he has realized how limited
he is to determine his destiny;
the different forces used him as
they wanted and he could not
stop them.
Lulu had his pleasures
material objects, sex and food
but by the end of the film lie has
seen the uselessness of his pos
sessions. The exhausting work

makes sex unwanted and gives
him an ulcer that destroys his
appetite.
Dynamic movie
The film would he over
whelmingly depressing if it
wasn't so forceful and energetic,
and il Mariangela Melato and
her son did not remain suppor
tive and concerned throughout
Lulu's ordeals. They leave him
when he brings home his new,
<md temporary, socialist friends,
but the two soon return, still
deeply involved with Lulu.
Volonte, as Lulu, gives the
character a possessed furv. He
incessantly battles the lathe he
operates as the milky lubricating
spray splashes in his faceand the
machine drains his strength and
sanity. Volonte also gives Lulu
<m emotional complexity that
makes the character vital and the
film stimulating. The movie's
sometimes witty and humorous
comments on a life trapped in a
world dominated by pain and
confusion stirs the mind; the
film attacks and excites too
much to be depressing.

festival with The Mallei Affair,

will present the peninsula pre
miere of Lulu the Tool, or The
Working Class Goes to Heaven at
kresge Auditorium. (The film,
although made in 1072. has had
only a very limited release on the
West Coast.) It tells the story of a
factory worker named Lulu who
must cope with the demands of
his bosses and his union while
trying to keep his sanity amid
t he insane working conditions of
his factory.
The workers are paid accord
ing to how much they produce
(called "piecework") and the
plot revolves around Lulu and
the efforts to change the wage
procedure. Gian Maria Volonte
plays Lulu and Mariangela
Melato (the girl on Swept Away,
The Seduction ofMimi and Love
and Anarchy) portrays his
girlfriend.
Lulu's dilemma
Lulu is caught between a
group of socialist students, who
beleaguer the workers at the
gates of the factory every morn
ing with bullhorns and cries of
worker-student unity and re
volution; the union leaders, who
want to raise the piecework
pay-rate but keep the system; the
factory management, who want

to keep the pay as low as possi
ble; and his girlfriend, who can
not understand why he lets all
the outside forces trouble him.
Lulu is a thoughtful, emotional
man. who, being the fastest
worker at the factory, is loved by
the management and despised
by his co-workers.
I le loses a finger in an indust
rial accident, however, and his
political apathy turns to support
lor the students. The companv
fires him, he goes to the students
who soon desert him, and even
tually the union leaders, while
selling-out the workers, get Lulu
rehired.
Lulu returns to the factory
dazed by the constant harass
ment he has received and the ad
vice of an old, crazy friend in an
insane asylum who used to work
at the factory. "If you want to go
mad. just return to the factory."
the old man told him.
Lulu won't go mad. though,
for he has realized how limited
he is to determine his destiny;
the different forces used him as
they wanted and he could not
stop them.
Lulu had his pleasures
material objects, sex and food
but by the end of the film lie has
seen the uselessness of his pos
sessions. The exhausting work

makes sex unwanted and gives
him an ulcer that destroys his
appetite.
Dynamic movie
The film would he over
whelmingly depressing if it
wasn't so forceful and energetic,
and il Mariangela Melato and
her son did not remain suppor
tive and concerned throughout
Lulu's ordeals. They leave him
when he brings home his new,
