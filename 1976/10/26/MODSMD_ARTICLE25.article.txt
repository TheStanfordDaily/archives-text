# Little humor

### Howard Baldwin 
The best To Tell The Truth
episode had to be the one Rich
Little performed .it the Circle
Star Theatre last weekend, in
which Gerald Lord. Jinum ('.li
ter and Richard Nixon were in
terviewed by Gary Crant, David
Janssen and Raymond Burr. Lit
tle slipped effortlessly from
voice to voice, supplanting the
verbal images with facial ex
pressions and mannerisms par
ticular to the celebrity whose
impression lie was doing.
Little's humor couldn't have
been more topical, as it included
references to Jimmy Carter's
Playboy interview. He had writ
ten the skit, in fact, as he flew up
to the Bay Area from his home in
Los Angeles.
Little continued by compli
menting San Francisco — "It's a
beautiful city, if they ever get it
finished." — and then moved
onto politics. He described the
debates as exciting as "watching
a moth climb up a drape" and
mentioned Henry Kissinger in a
similar way, saying watching
him was like "watching a casket
warp." But he did admit that a
lot of people were jumping on
''Ford's b landwagon."
The most famous and the most
talented of all the impre
ssionists, Little rattled through a
majority of his 160 possible voi
ces, at one point even asking the
audience for requests. The audi
ence, in turn, responded with
rapt attention, giving him a
standing ovation at the end of a
superb show and clammering for
more.
Little ribbed Cosell's image of
pomposity mercilessly, quoting
him as saying, "1 think I'll run for
Pope," and adding afterwards.
"You know Cosell — they used
his mouth for the Tidy-80l
commercial . . . He was born
with a terrible birthmark — his
face."
Coif lesson
The routine also included a
Bing Crosby golf lesson. "You
should address the ball, not
forgetting the zip code, because
that makes it go faster." Little
utilized an amazing assortment
of hats and imaginary props to
add to his characterizations in
the golfing routine, all to the au
dience's delight.
The voice that he finds the
most difficult, Frank Sinatra's,
he imitated in a singing routine,
but his most requested personal
ity by far was that of Paul Lynde.
Little took great pleasure in re
counting some events that had
transcribed while he was taping
five episodes of the Hollywood
Squares with Lynde. Asked if
you could get a butterfly drunk.
Lynde answered, "It's the best
time to mount them!"
Little never slackened his pace
for 90 minutes, dishing out im
pressions as if they were on an
amazing conveyor belt, enjoying
the audience's delight im
mensely.
