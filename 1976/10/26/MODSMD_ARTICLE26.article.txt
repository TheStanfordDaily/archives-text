Rhodesian talks unsuccessful
Geneva, Switzerland — Prime Minister lan
Smith of Rhodesia declared yesterday his country's
white minority can hold out against black guerril
las and world sanctions for years if necessary.
Two of four black nationalist leaders, here to
discuss Rhodesia's fate with Smith, in turn de
manded that his government free all political pris
oners and stop what they called the "genocide and
massacre" of blacks.
Their stiff conditions and Smith's hard-line
statement threw the preliminary talks into confu
sion.
Smith told a news conference, "You know we are
having great success against the terrorists — a 12-
or 13-to-l kill ratio."
By that he meant up to 13 black guerrilla suspects
are being killed for every white, in a country where
there are 0.4 million blacks and 278.000 whites.
Two black leaders, Joshua Nkomo and Robert
Mugabe who head the recently formed Patriotic
Front, met with British conference chairman Ivor
Richard and then issued their demands.
Richard promised to take up the demands with
Smith and with the British government.
Initial signs suggested there was no chance
Smith would accept such conditions or that Britain
would assign Foreign Secretary Anthony Crosland
to take over the chairmanship at this stage.
Crosland has resisted U.S. appeals to take on the
assignment, presumably because he feels there are
few prospects of success.
Iraq objects to Syrian inclusion
Cairo — Arab leaders endorsed a peace plan tor
war-battered Lebanon yesterday despite objections
from Iraq over the makeup of the 30,000-man force
intended to monitor the cease-fire.
An Arab League spokesman said the opening
session of an Arab summit meeting had approved
the plan to end the fighting reached by six involved
Arab leaders a week ago in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Iraq, which has 2000 troops fighting on the side
of the Palestinians and Moslem leftists in Lebanon,
objected to the inclusion of troops from its arch
rival. Syria, in the peacekeeping contingent. Syrian
troops have sided with Christians against the
Moslem-leftist alliance.
Sources said the force will be made up mostly of
Syrian troops with additional units from Saudi
Arabia. Sudan and South Yemen. Speedy deploy
ment of the force is necessary for the plan to have a
chance of working, the sources added.
Ford speaks to aircraft workers
President Gerald Ford said yesterday his recent
proposal to require commercial aircraft noise re
duction would bring 250,000 new jobs to the air
craft construction industry. But he also disclosed
that he has ordered public hearings to determine
whether "financial provisions" might be needed to
help airlines meet the standards.
Stressing economic themes in his last pre
election visit to crucial California and the Pacific
Northwest. Ford also pledged to hold down gov
ernment spending because it contributes to infla
tion. which he called "just another high tax."
In Seattle. Ford told workers at the Boeing Com
pany. the world's largest airplane maker and the
city's biggest employer, that his decision, an

nounced last week, to extend aircraft noise limits to
all domestic commercial aircraft in the United
States would result in a more prosperous aircraft
industry that would he able to provide more jobs.
Meanwhile, in Plains, Ga., Jimmy Carter made
preparations for his own coast-to-coast trip that
will keep him moving in search of votes until the
eve of the election showdown with Ford on Nov. 2.
Aides to Carter said the Democratic nominee
would focus on economic issues and appeals for
voters to exercise their ballot, the latter subject
being newly emphasized by the Democrats, who
express concern about voter apathy and believe a
large vote will enhance their prospects.
Press Director Rex Granum said Carter's attacks
on Ford would be restrained, hewing close to his
standard criticisms of Ford policies, especially on
inflation and unemployment.
Carter, he said, is "trying to demonstrate to the
nation what kind of president he will be."
Investigation sparked by N.Y. fire
New York — Mayor Abraham Beame ordered a
top-level investigation yesterday into the city's
thousands of afterhour bottle clubs in the wake of a
weekend club fire that killed 25 persons in the
South Bronx.
The blaze in a licensed but overcrowded Puerto
Rican social club was described by authorities as
the work of an arsonist. A search for him was under
way, but police said there were no signs of a pend
ing arrest.
Fire broke out in the Puerto Rican Social Club
shortly before 3 a.m. Sunday while more than 50
partying guests drank and danced to a six-piece
band. Officials said the second-floor premises had a
Buildings Department certificate limiting occu
pancy to no more than 20 persons.
A fierce flash fire was set with gasoline or some
other substance in the stairway of the club, its only
regular means of entrance and exit.
Survivors reported that the blaze erupted some
time after a man had been thrown out of the club
following an argument over his wife's dancing with
another man.
I lowever, this man denied he had set the fire and
said he never had left the club until his leap to
safety at the height of the blaze.
Waldorf-Astoria lobby robbed
New York — Two men wearing wigs and false
beards robbed a jewelry boutique in the lobby of the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel yesterday of what police cal
led a "substantial" amount of cash and jewels.
Police at first said $150,000 in jewels and $50,000
in cash were taken, but later said the figures were
not accurate and "could be more. They took the
good stuff."
Police said the whole operation at the small
Cartier-franchised lobby store was "very smooth,
very knowledgeable." An assistant manager of the
hotel said it was "very nicely done, very genteel."
Mondale and Dole campaign
Sen. Walter Mondale's day began badly when,
through a staff snafu, he reached the gates of the
U.S. Steel Corp. plant in Duquesne, Pa., five mi
nutes too late to greet all but a handful of 1700
workers changing shifts.
Later. Mondale breakfasted with steel workers at
a Duquesne cafe and called the area's 14 per cent

unemployment rate "the reality of what's going
on."
In New Jersey, Mondale blamed the COP lor an
unemployment problem among Vietnam veterans.
He said that among those 20 to 24 years old. one in
five is without a job.
In Providence, Sen. Robert Dole used a Veterans
Day theme to laud Ford's efforts to maintain peace
and said Mondale was "downright frightening"
because he has opposed spending for various milit
ary programs and supported defense budget cuts
Alabama pardons "Scottsboro Boy"
Montgomery, Ala. — Forty-five years after it be
gan, "Scottsboro Boy" Clarence Norris won a full
pardon from theState of Alabama yesterday and the
right to live at last in full freedom.
He had spent five years on death row, years more
behind bars and decades living as a fugitive, all for
a crime he always insisted he did not commit.
The Pardon-Parole Board not only pardoned Nor
ris, but in effect also recognized his innocence. By
law, the board could pardon him only if il felt there
was proof of his innocence.
When Norris first inquired about a pardon last
summer, he encountered stern resistance from the
Pardon-Parole Board. The chairman of the board.
Norman Ussery. said Norris was still a fugitive and
would have to return to prison in Alabama before
the request could be considered.
At first, he said, "we did not have any informa
tion as to where he (Norris) was living, where he
worked, or what his behavior had been since he left
Alabama."
But the official application gave the board "the
necessary information to investigate this case," the
chairman said, and "after verifying this informa
tion, I no longer felt that he was a fugitive from
justice."
Norris said in a recent interview that after fleeing
Alabama he lived in Cleveland until 1953, when he
went to New York. Fie is married now, and has two
daughters, 20 and 16 years old.
Friendship gesture at River Kwai
River Kwai, Thailand — Former Japanese sol
diers and Allied prisoners marched again yesterday
to the Bridge on the River Kwai and maneuvered
gingerly across the narrow span in a friendship
gesture. But memories lingered of the tropical hell
where thousands died.
To those who have come of age since World War
II this jungle river means a much-acclaimed movie
and an oft-whistled military march.
Stanley Willner, 56, of Norfolk, Va., remembers it
differently.
He prayed silently at the side of the muddy river
yesterday for those who died while building the
bridge and backing through jungle to construct a
250-mile railroad to Burma for the Japanese. The
railroad was completed 33 years ago yesterday on
Oct. 25, 1943.
