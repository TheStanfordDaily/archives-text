# Pound nosedives to new low

London (AP) — The British pound
plummeted to record lows aginst the
U.S. dollar and other major currencies
yesterday, posing a new threat to Bri
tain's crippled economy and Labor
government.
In wild selling on the London
foreign exchange that lasted just over
.in hour, the pound nosedived 7V2
cents to $1.5730. It recovered some
what to close at $ 1.5945. but that was a
record low close.
It had closed Friday at $1.6481.
The dramatic slump was triggered
by a report in the Sunday Times news
paper tli.it the International Monetary
Fund — IMF — wants the pound to fall
to $1.50 as a condition for extending
Britain .1 $.'L9-billion loan to help it out
of the gravest economic crisis si nee the
(ireat Depressions.
The Times said the IMF felt this
would make British exports more at
tractive and the United States, as the

IMF's biggest contributor, was in ag
reement with the plan.
The IMF. U.S. Treasury Secretary
William Simon and British Chancellor
of the Exchequer Denis Healey all de
nied the report, but the denials only
partially revived sterling.
Prime Minister James Callaghan
warned the IMF that Britain will reject
tough austerity measures as a condi
tion for the loan.
"If the IMF fries to force us into
policies we believe will harm our
economy. 'You must accept the politi
cal responsibilities'," he said.
Callaghan said Britain has shoul
dered heavy commitments as a "loyal
ally" in Western defense and he hoped
it would not be "pushed into a posi
tion" of having to decide between fo
fulfilling and abandoning those com
mitments.
Callaghan insisted that his strategy
of pressing British industry to expand

exports is the only solution. Deflatio
nary measures, despite this year's pro
jected budget deficit of more than $20
billion, would bring social chaos, he
said.
The pound's slump means the
once-mighty currency has been effec
tively devalued by 47.fi percent in re
lation to 10 major currencies since De
cember 1971. It was worth $2.40 about
18 months ago and fell through the
psychologically important $2 level
last March.
The pound's sudden slide Monday
morning was the ailing currency's
worst fall, apart from formal devalua
tion, since it ran into trouble four years
ago.
Some analysts believe investors lack
confidence in the Labor government's
ability to deal with the country's 13.8
per cent inflation rate, a huge budget
deficit, record high unemployment
and low productivity.
