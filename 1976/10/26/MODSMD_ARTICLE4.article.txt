The United States should become a "giant Swit
zerland," said Roger Macßride. presidential candi
date for the Libertarian Party, in an Interview last
Friday night with the Daily
"Our foreign policy should be modeled on that of
Switzerland, an open foreign policy. The United
States should be a giant Switzerland: at all times,
we must refrain from committing aggression," said
Macßride.
However. Macßride still called for a "secure de
fense against foreign [lowers and foreign invasion."
lie said such a defense could be accomplished by
an effective nuclear deterrent "which we already
have" and .1 small contingent of land troops to
allow .1 non-nuclear option "if the need should
arise, for example, to stop Castro from seizing Key
West (in Florida)."
Macßride further said. "The troops should be
limited, mobile, completely volunteer and paid ac
cording to the risk involved."
Macßride criticized the last debate between

Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, saying, "The fun
damental issues were not raised in the debate." lie
said. "There was no challenge as to whether the
statist, collectivism government authority ought to
have a role in our lives."
Macßride also denounced Ford's refusal to
specify, during the debate, the appropriate U.S.
reaction in case of a Soviet invasion of Yugoslavia.
Macßride said he saw no reason for the U.S. to
intervene and presented a reversal of the hypothet
ical situation. "If the Cubans were invading
America, would we want to havea foreign invasion
of the United States to protect us from the Cubans?"
Although saying that "individual American citi
zens would be completely free to commit body or
money to the cause of Yugoslavian freedom." Mac-
Bride emphasized that the U.S. government should
not get involved.
"It the Soviets invaded Yugoslavia, 1 would im
mediately make a nationwide broadcast underscor
ing categorically the principle of non-intervention.
I would declare that there would be no militarv

action taken by the United States."
MacHride criticized what he termed the "inter
ventionist" approach to international affairs taken
by both Ford and Carter. "There is a plague ol
power politics in the thinking of our present politi
cal leadership." he insisted.
The Libertarian Party adheres to two fundamen
tal principles: .tn end to government intervention
in the private affairs of individuals and end to
military intervention in the affairs of foreign coun
tries. This would mean as practical legislation: the
abolition of victimless crime laws, complete
economic laissez-faire, strict adherence to full civil
liberties and.i neutralist foreign policy.
MacHride estimated his chance at winning the
presidency as "one in 7fi." but said. "My own elec
tion. however, is not the principal question."
Me added. "It's not my name that is important, it's
the effort of the Libertarian Party <in .1 whole in
spreading its < oncepts, programs and alternatives."
MacHride is on the ballot in .12 states, but s.iid he
