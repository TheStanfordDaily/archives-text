# Senate settles tie, selects chairman
## 
### Kathy Trafton 
Two more Hammer and Coffin (H
and C) candidates were voted in by the
ASSU Senate last night in the first se
nate meeting of the year.
I I and C candidate Barry Parr won by
a vote of 11 to 4 the 10th under
graduate senate seat against Tim Fer
guson, resolving the tie that had re
sulted from the ASSU undergraduate
elections. Alternate senator Patrik
Hall, who ran on the Hand CI slate in
the elections, was elected Chairman of
the Senate by a vote of 12 to 8.
Ferguson, who is now first alternate,
said he was "very disappointed, and I
think the voters will be disappointed
at the scheming evident tonight. 1
think the voters will be a bit surprised
at the very political nature of the Hand
C slate which they elected on an anti
political platform."
H anil C senator Roy Skogstrom re
sponded. "We all wore suits and ties
tonight, so we must be serious."
After Hall was voted chairman, he
nominated Greg Larson as parliamen
tarian. The nomination was refused by
Larson.
Collusion
Larson stated that there was "no
doubt in (his) mind that there is
explicit or implicit collusion" bet
ween Hand C senators and certain
other senators to elect Hall as chair
man.
Larson said he decided not to run for
chairman himself because he "likes
Pat (Hall). Hut 1 almost felt that I was
offered parliamentarianship if I didn't
run for senate chairman."
Larson claimed that Sen. Dave Sharp
told him Sen. Dan Livingston would
be made Finance Chairman if
Livingston and his slate members
(Morrow and Sharp) would support
Hall for chairman.
Committee chairmanships
Larson said he supported Hall as se
nate chairman until Hall was asked if
he had discussed giving a committee
chairmanship to anyone. Hall replied
that he had not.
The contradiction Larson saw bet
ween Sharp's and Hall's statements
made Larson decide "there was no
doubt that there was collusion."
"He (Hall) will do a good job, but it

should be made clear that it was a rail
road," Larson added.
No deals
Hall said, "l talked with over half of
the senators about various committees.
1 didn't make any deals. It is bad that a
lot of people still think that there was a
deal made. There wasn't."
Livingston said, "At no time was
any 'deal' made. ... 1 remained un
committed on the chairman question
until tonight. In fact, 1 had agreed to
nominate Brad krevoy had Ferguson
not done so first. Had there been any
'deal' made, I would obviously have
not agreed to do so."
In addition to his other duties, the
senate chairman is expected to appoint
members and chairmen to three com
mittees, the Rules, Finance and
Bylaws committees. Sen. Jim King
said, "There is a lot of politicking on
many sides that created some bitter
ness, and I would like to see that it
doesn't happen again."
King motion
King made a motion that committee
chairmen be elected by members of the
individual committees instead of
appointed by the Chairman of
the Senate.
"In the future it (the motion) will
eliminate a lot of politicking," said
King.
The motion was approved unanim
ously and will become a special order
to be voted on at the next senate meet
ing Nov. 1.
Hold Bird's salary
The Livingston-Morrow-Sharp slate
supported a resolution to indefinitely
withhold Election Commissioner
Randy Bird's salary.
Sharp said that the "unfortunate
oversight" of Bird's not having noticed
that the ballots were incomplete "falls
in the realm of incompetence. The
ASSI! shouldn't tolerate incompe
tence. This incompetence may have
materially affected results of the elec
tions." The resolution failed.

Hold Bird's salary
The Livingston-Morrow-Sharp slate
supported a resolution to indefinitely
withhold Election Commissioner
Randy Bird's salary.
Sharp said that the "unfortunate
oversight" of Bird's not having noticed
that the ballots were incomplete "falls
in the realm of incompetence. The
ASSI! shouldn't tolerate incompe
tence. This incompetence may have
materially affected results of the elec
tions." The resolution failed.

Chao and Steven Buckley to serve on
the ASSU Course Guide Policy Board.
Also senators Bandowand Barth were
seated as members of the Publication
Board.
Two more Hammer and Coffin (H
and C) candidates were voted in by the
ASSU Senate last night in the first se
nate meeting of the year.
I I and C candidate Barry Parr won by
a vote of 11 to 4 the 10th under
graduate senate seat against Tim Fer
guson, resolving the tie that had re
sulted from the ASSU undergraduate
elections. Alternate senator Patrik
Hall, who ran on the Hand CI slate in
the elections, was elected Chairman of
the Senate by a vote of 12 to 8.
Ferguson, who is now first alternate,
said he was "very disappointed, and I
think the voters will be disappointed
at the scheming evident tonight. 1
think the voters will be a bit surprised
at the very political nature of the Hand
C slate which they elected on an anti
political platform."
H anil C senator Roy Skogstrom re
sponded. "We all wore suits and ties
tonight, so we must be serious."
After Hall was voted chairman, he
nominated Greg Larson as parliamen
tarian. The nomination was refused by
Larson.
Collusion
Larson stated that there was "no
doubt in (his) mind that there is
explicit or implicit collusion" bet
ween Hand C senators and certain
other senators to elect Hall as chair
man.
Larson said he decided not to run for
chairman himself because he "likes
Pat (Hall). Hut 1 almost felt that I was
offered parliamentarianship if I didn't
run for senate chairman."
Larson claimed that Sen. Dave Sharp
told him Sen. Dan Livingston would
be made Finance Chairman if
Livingston and his slate members
(Morrow and Sharp) would support
Hall for chairman.
Committee chairmanships
Larson said he supported Hall as se
nate chairman until Hall was asked if
he had discussed giving a committee
chairmanship to anyone. Hall replied
that he had not.
The contradiction Larson saw bet
ween Sharp's and Hall's statements
made Larson decide "there was no
doubt that there was collusion."
"He (Hall) will do a good job, but it

should be made clear that it was a rail
road," Larson added.
No deals
Hall said, "l talked with over half of
the senators about various committees.
1 didn't make any deals. It is bad that a
lot of people still think that there was a
deal made. There wasn't."
Livingston said, "At no time was
any 'deal' made. ... 1 remained un
committed on the chairman question
until tonight. In fact, 1 had agreed to
nominate Brad krevoy had Ferguson
not done so first. Had there been any
'deal' made, I would obviously have
not agreed to do so."
In addition to his other duties, the
senate chairman is expected to appoint
members and chairmen to three com
mittees, the Rules, Finance and
Bylaws committees. Sen. Jim King
said, "There is a lot of politicking on
many sides that created some bitter
ness, and I would like to see that it
doesn't happen again."
King motion
King made a motion that committee
chairmen be elected by members of the
individual committees instead of
appointed by the Chairman of

"In the future it (the motion) will
