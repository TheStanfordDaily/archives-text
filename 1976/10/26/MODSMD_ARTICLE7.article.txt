The university does not have <i pol
icy to guide its dealing with com
panies participating in the Arab
economic boycott of Israel, according
to Robert vice president for
university relations. However,
California Assembly Mill 2553. signed
into law in July, will render such dis
crimination illegal in the state .is ot
January 1. 1077.

The bill provides "that no business
establishment shall discriminate
against, boycott or blacklist, refuse to
buy from, sell to, or trade with any
person, as defined, in this state be
cause of the race, creed, religion, color,
national origin, or sex of such person,
or of such person's partners, members,
stockholders, directors, officers, man
agers. superintendents, agents,
employes, business associates,
suppliers, or customers."
One of tin; university's bankers.
Hank of America. San Francisco (B of
A) was on the original list compiled
by reporters with access to Commerce
Department files planning to comply
with the Arab economic boycott of Is
rael in the future.
B of A underwrote and
sold the university's first issue of
bonds through the California Educa
tional facilities Authority.
In addition. Rodney Adams, director
of finance, said that B of A handles
the university's cash disbursement ac
counts and "a minor portion of bor
rowings." primarily for equipment at
the medical center.
Other banks
It is not known whether other banks
used by the university were also on the
list of companies planning to comply
with the boycott, but SueTaha. senior
information officer for B of A
explained that si me the list was first
available, "(the Department of] Com
merce has since withdrawn and de
nied that there was such a list."

Rather, the department had opened
its files to reporters, because all con
tracts involving discriminatory
clauses are required to be registered
with the department. For example,
India and Pakistan discriminate
against one another; Israel boycotts
Arah goods, and the U.S. boycotts
Cuba. Taha said.
"There has been a lot of internal dis
cussion (of the issue) at the bank,"
Taha said. Should the new legislation
apply to banks, as bank officials seem
to think it will. "We intend to comply
with the law," Taha said. This would
mean that thereafter B of A would not
be able to issue letters of credit for con
tracts involving discrimination.
Manufacturer's choice
"We are not the one making the
choice (of whether to boycott); the
manufacturer makes the choice." Taha
said. "The bank merely processes the
documents," she said.
The university holds some contracts
with Arab customers, according to As
soc. Dean of Engineering 1,. Farrell
McGhie. Hut Rosenzweig said, "We
would never accept such a contract
(with a discriminatory clause)."
Rosenzweig also said that it is prob
ably not appropriate for the university
as an institution to have a policy re
garding the boycott, but the universi
ty's attutudes toward other American
companies involved in the boycott is
"separable from the university's wil
lingness itself to he ,1 party to the
bovcott."
