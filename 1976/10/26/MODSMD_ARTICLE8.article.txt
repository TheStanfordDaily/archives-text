## Opinions Look at the issue 
### 
Steve Schiller

The debate over the "Agricultural
l.abor Relationsâ€”lnitiative Statute"
(Prop. 14) largely ignores the crucial
issues and. instead, dwells on irra
tional arguments and questions which
have been previously resolved.
Discussions over Prop. 14 tend to
degenerate into "tales of the fields."
Participants cite "evidence" of
second-hand reports or perhaps even
personal experience. For instance, one
told me of hearing workers tell of IJn
ited Farm Workers (IJFW) threats to
their well-being; another tells of a
grower who deploys hired thugs
against peaceable union organizers.
But these "tales of the fields" are
irrelevant to the value of Prop. 14. By
dwelling on these incidents, true or
not, we make implicit judgments
about the goodness or evil of the battl
ing camps, and. hence, of the proposi
tion. In other words, we make the clas
sical mistake ol "arguing the man."
Look at statute
But the relative characters or tactics
ot either side of the initiative fight
have no bearing on the question at
hand. We must look at the statute and
not at its sponsors.
I lere. too. we find ourselves in trou
ble. Popular arguments for or against
the issue are largely inaccurate or tri
vial. Take, forexample, the access rule.
Crowers' ads assert that "private prop
erty" is at stake. Yet the California
Supreme Court has upheld the access
regulation of the current state Agricul
tural Labor Relations Board (ALRB).
which is the same as the access rule in
the initiative.
And the "No on 14" group claims
that the access rule permits disruption
ol normal activities by union organiz
ers. List's turn to the initiative- "The
right ol access shall not include con
duct disruptive of the employer's
property or agricultural operations,
including injury to crops or machin
ery." (Section l 152.2, subsection e)
Some portray the growers as help
less before hordes of unkempt union
organizers overrunning property and

destroying valuable crops. Yet the
growers can appeal to the ALRB for
protection and restitution for unfair
labor actions, just as the unions can.
Emotional appeals
On the other side, the relative emo
tional appeals of the Prop. 14 group
also have little bearing on the actual
issue. "You can end squalid labor
camps, malnourished farm worker
children, and hazardous working con
ditions in the field," reads the "Argu
ment in favor of Proposition 14" in the
California voters pamphlet.
The quality of life for farmworkers is
not the question; rather, the issue is
value of a particular structure for reg
ulating agricultural labor.
What are the basic issues of Prop.
14? First, are the structures and regula
tions proposed by the statute fair and
workable? The experience of the
short-lived ALRB last year de
monstrates that such guidelines are
reasonable and effective.
The San Francisco Examiner the
other day raised another problem: the
question of flexibility. While under the
current law the board can set up and
modify labor regulations, the initiative
would encase some of these flexible
regulations into law, where only a
statewide ballot can change them.
This feature may prevent politicians
from neutralizing the rules under
pressure from concerned interests, but
it also prevents the Board from adjust
ing to changing conditions.
The largest question remains, how
ever, does California need regulation
of agricultural labor? We need only
look to the history of labor unrest to
answer affirmatively.
I support Prop. 14 with reservations.
More importantly, though, I argue that
we should discard the irrational
reasons ("tales of the fields") and ig
nore the trivial arguments of cost or
"private property" rights in favor of a
sensible, rational dialogue on a struc
ture for labor relations.
