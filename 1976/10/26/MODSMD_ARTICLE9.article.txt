# McCloskey's record
## 
### 
Lobdell and Warfield

In an election year in which the pres
idential candidates have waged a
mud-slinging, low-level campaign,
the two congressional candidates for
tlit' 12th district began their race on an
admirably high plane.
Throughout the campaign we have
seen sensitive discussion and debate
ot the important issues by both David
Harris and Rep. Paul "Pete" McClos
key (R-Menlo Park) — a campaign
practice for which both men merit our
respect.
I ntortunately. in the last few weeks
literature has been distributed on this
campus which intentionally distorts
McCloskey's voting record and tries to
paint him as someone which lie clearly
is not.
Since many of the statements con
tained in the Harris literature make
damaging and unfair statements and
i nferenees about McClloskey. and si nee
both candidates signed a Pair Cam
paign Practices Agreement which
provided, in part, that each would
"condemn the use of campaign mate
rial of any sort which misrepresents,
distorts or otherwise falsifies the facts
regarding any candidate." it is impor
tant that the misleading impressions
he corrected and the false implications
be refuted.
Campaign literature
This tactic of distorting the truth by
implying false conclusions is used
most blatantly in a piece of Harris
campaign literature entitled "You lie
the Judge."
The pamphlet characterizes
McCloskev as a "Ford" man. Yet on 1 7
ot the veto override votes in the
House. McCloskev has voted against
Cerald l ord's administration.
He has not hesitated to criticize
l ord's stands on amnesty, abortion,
environmental legislation, foreign
policy <md domestic funding prog
rams. He has urged the resignation of
Henry Kissinger and the normaliza
tion of relations with Vietnam.
The Harris pamphlet states
"\le( llos key's vol ing record has grown
increasingly party-line and increas
ingly conservative." Yet last year, as
always. McCloskev consistently sup
ported bills in favor of education
spending, school lunch programs,
food stamps and national health insur
ance in fact, most of the tradition
ally democratic health, education and
welfare measures.
Deceptive tactic
This attempt by the I larris campaign
to show otherwise has been done
through the deceptive tactic of picking
an unrepresentative sampling of
McCloskey's votes, providing mis
leading definitions of the votes, and
then using them to support [ire
determined — and often false — con
(lusions.
l ot example, a listing under "Paul
McCloskey's Record" states "in Au-

gust. 1976. voted against expediting
passage of the major Congressional
Day Care Bill."
The inference is clear from this
statement that McCloskey's vote was
in opposition to day care centers. That
is simply false.
A look at the voting record reveals
that there were six votes pertaining to
the Day Care Center issue. McCloskev
had consistently voted for the DayCare
Center Bill, had voted to override the
president's veto of that bill, and had
voted for the revised version of the bill
after the veto was sustained.
Procedural question
The vote singled out by Harris dealt
with a procedural question — whether
to waive the "Three Day Rule" which
requires that the House have three full
days to review any piece of legislation
before the final vote. This vote had no
thing to do with tilt; substance of the
Day Care bill, and did not reflect
McCloskey's feeling on the Day Care
bill.
A similar distortion is the charge
made at different times in the cam
paign that McCloskev voted against
the release of the CIA report. McClos
key actually voted with a large major
ity of Congress to not publicly release
the CIA report until having a chance to
read it himself. After reviewing it,
McCloskev publicly stated that he fa
vored its release.
It is to McCloskey's credit that he is
not a knee-jerk politician. His votes on
a specific hill throughout its legisla
tive history may differ as the bill
changes format or emphasis through
added or deleted amendments.
On the oil depletion allowance, for
example. Harris literature charges that
McCloskev voted against its repeal,
"which cost us millions in uncollected
taxes each year."
The vote cited had actually been on
the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, which
included a provision to repeal the oil
depletion allowance. McCloskev had
previously and subsequently publicly
supported the repeal of the oil deple
tion allowance by Congress. This,
however, was not the main emphasis
of tin; tiix bill and was not the issue on
which McCloskev based his vote.
Harris has singled out a minor por
tion of a complex bill to infer a position
McCloskev does not hold.
Space does not permit further de
tailed discussion of the various mis
representations of Pete McCloskey's
voting record, but this discussion
should make you more cautious and
questioning in swallowing such cam
paign literature in the future.
You will be the judge, but we hope
your decision will be based on a much
more fair view of each candidate's re
cord.

Throughout the campaign we have
seen sensitive discussion and debate
ot the important issues by both David
Harris and Rep. Paul "Pete" McClos
key (R-Menlo Park) — a campaign
practice for which both men merit our
respect.
I ntortunately. in the last few weeks
literature has been distributed on this
campus which intentionally distorts
McCloskey's voting record and tries to
paint him as someone which lie clearly
is not.
Since many of the statements con
tained in the Harris literature make
damaging and unfair statements and
i nferenees about McClloskey. and si nee
both candidates signed a Pair Cam
paign Practices Agreement which
provided, in part, that each would
"condemn the use of campaign mate
rial of any sort which misrepresents,
distorts or otherwise falsifies the facts
regarding any candidate." it is impor
tant that the misleading impressions
he corrected and the false implications
be refuted.
Campaign literature
This tactic of distorting the truth by
implying false conclusions is used
most blatantly in a piece of Harris
campaign literature entitled "You lie
the Judge."
The pamphlet characterizes
McCloskev as a "Ford" man. Yet on 1 7
ot the veto override votes in the
House. McCloskev has voted against
Cerald l ord's administration.
He has not hesitated to criticize
l ord's stands on amnesty, abortion,
environmental legislation, foreign
policy <md domestic funding prog
rams. He has urged the resignation of
Henry Kissinger and the normaliza
tion of relations with Vietnam.
The Harris pamphlet states
"\le( llos key's vol ing record has grown
increasingly party-line and increas
ingly conservative." Yet last year, as
always. McCloskev consistently sup
ported bills in favor of education
spending, school lunch programs,
food stamps and national health insur
ance in fact, most of the tradition
ally democratic health, education and
welfare measures.
Deceptive tactic
This attempt by the I larris campaign
to show otherwise has been done
through the deceptive tactic of picking
an unrepresentative sampling of
McCloskey's votes, providing mis
leading definitions of the votes, and
then using them to support [ire
determined — and often false — con
(lusions.
l ot example, a listing under "Paul
McCloskey's Record" states "in Au-

gust. 1976. voted against expediting
passage of the major Congressional
Day Care Bill."
The inference is clear from this
statement that McCloskey's vote was
in opposition to day care centers. That
is simply false.
A look at the voting record reveals
that there were six votes pertaining to
the Day Care Center issue. McCloskev
had consistently voted for the DayCare
Center Bill, had voted to override the
president's veto of that bill, and had
voted for the revised version of the bill
after the veto was sustained.
Procedural question
The vote singled out by Harris dealt
with a procedural question — whether
to waive the "Three Day Rule" which
requires that the House have three full
days to review any piece of legislation
before the final vote. This vote had no
thing to do with tilt; substance of the
Day Care bill, and did not reflect
McCloskey's feeling on the Day Care
bill.
A similar distortion is the charge
made at different times in the cam
paign that McCloskev voted against
the release of the CIA report. McClos
key actually voted with a large major
ity of Congress to not publicly release
the CIA report until having a chance to
read it himself. After reviewing it,
McCloskev publicly stated that he fa
vored its release.
It is to McCloskey's credit that he is
not a knee-jerk politician. His votes on
a specific hill throughout its legisla
tive history may differ as the bill
changes format or emphasis through
added or deleted amendments.
On the oil depletion allowance, for
example. Harris literature charges that
McCloskev voted against its repeal,
"which cost us millions in uncollected
taxes each year."
The vote cited had actually been on
the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, which
included a provision to repeal the oil
depletion allowance. McCloskev had
previously and subsequently publicly
supported the repeal of the oil deple
tion allowance by Congress. This,
however, was not the main emphasis
of tin; tiix bill and was not the issue on
which McCloskev based his vote.
Harris has singled out a minor por
tion of a complex bill to infer a position
McCloskev does not hold.
Space does not permit further de
tailed discussion of the various mis
representations of Pete McCloskey's
voting record, but this discussion
should make you more cautious and
questioning in swallowing such cam
paign literature in the future.
You will be the judge, but we hope
your decision will be based on a much
more fair view of each candidate's re
cord.

I ntortunately. in the last few weeks
literature has been distributed on this
campus which intentionally distorts
McCloskey's voting record and tries to
paint him as someone which lie clearly
is not.
Since many of the statements con
tained in the Harris literature make
damaging and unfair statements and
i nferenees about McClloskey. and si nee
both candidates signed a Pair Cam
paign Practices Agreement which
provided, in part, that each would
"condemn the use of campaign mate
rial of any sort which misrepresents,
distorts or otherwise falsifies the facts
regarding any candidate." it is impor
tant that the misleading impressions
he corrected and the false implications
be refuted.
Campaign literature
This tactic of distorting the truth by
implying false conclusions is used
most blatantly in a piece of Harris
campaign literature entitled "You lie
the Judge."
The pamphlet characterizes
McCloskev as a "Ford" man. Yet on 1 7
ot the veto override votes in the
House. McCloskev has voted against
Cerald l ord's administration.
He has not hesitated to criticize
l ord's stands on amnesty, abortion,
environmental legislation, foreign
policy <md domestic funding prog
rams. He has urged the resignation of
Henry Kissinger and the normaliza
tion of relations with Vietnam.
The Harris pamphlet states
"\le( llos key's vol ing record has grown
increasingly party-line and increas
ingly conservative." Yet last year, as
always. McCloskev consistently sup
ported bills in favor of education
spending, school lunch programs,
food stamps and national health insur
ance in fact, most of the tradition
ally democratic health, education and
welfare measures.
Deceptive tactic
This attempt by the I larris campaign
to show otherwise has been done
through the deceptive tactic of picking
an unrepresentative sampling of
McCloskey's votes, providing mis
leading definitions of the votes, and
then using them to support [ire
determined — and often false — con
(lusions.
l ot example, a listing under "Paul
McCloskey's Record" states "in Au-

gust. 1976. voted against expediting
passage of the major Congressional
Day Care Bill."
The inference is clear from this
statement that McCloskey's vote was
in opposition to day care centers. That
is simply false.
A look at the voting record reveals
that there were six votes pertaining to
the Day Care Center issue. McCloskev
had consistently voted for the DayCare
Center Bill, had voted to override the
president's veto of that bill, and had
voted for the revised version of the bill
after the veto was sustained.
Procedural question
The vote singled out by Harris dealt
with a procedural question — whether
to waive the "Three Day Rule" which
requires that the House have three full
days to review any piece of legislation
before the final vote. This vote had no
thing to do with tilt; substance of the
Day Care bill, and did not reflect
McCloskey's feeling on the Day Care
bill.
A similar distortion is the charge
made at different times in the cam
paign that McCloskev voted against
the release of the CIA report. McClos
key actually voted with a large major
ity of Congress to not publicly release
the CIA report until having a chance to
read it himself. After reviewing it,
McCloskev publicly stated that he fa
vored its release.
It is to McCloskey's credit that he is
not a knee-jerk politician. His votes on
a specific hill throughout its legisla
tive history may differ as the bill
changes format or emphasis through
added or deleted amendments.
On the oil depletion allowance, for
example. Harris literature charges that
McCloskev voted against its repeal,
"which cost us millions in uncollected
taxes each year."
The vote cited had actually been on
the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, which
included a provision to repeal the oil
depletion allowance. McCloskev had
previously and subsequently publicly
supported the repeal of the oil deple
tion allowance by Congress. This,
however, was not the main emphasis
of tin; tiix bill and was not the issue on
which McCloskev based his vote.
Harris has singled out a minor por
tion of a complex bill to infer a position
McCloskev does not hold.
Space does not permit further de
tailed discussion of the various mis
representations of Pete McCloskey's
voting record, but this discussion
should make you more cautious and
questioning in swallowing such cam
paign literature in the future.
You will be the judge, but we hope
your decision will be based on a much
more fair view of each candidate's re
cord.

In an election year in which the pres
idential candidates have waged a
mud-slinging, low-level campaign,
the two congressional candidates for
tlit' 12th district began their race on an
admirably high plane.
Throughout the campaign we have
seen sensitive discussion and debate
ot the important issues by both David
Harris and Rep. Paul "Pete" McClos
key (R-Menlo Park) — a campaign
practice for which both men merit our
respect.
