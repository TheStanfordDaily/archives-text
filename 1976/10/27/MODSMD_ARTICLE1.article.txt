# Land' ownership disputed
## Commune given notice 
### Marc Strassman 
Santa Clara County deputy sheriffs
yesterday served eviction notices to
iour members of an ecology-minded
commune called The Land located on
upper Page Mill Road.
1 he action is the latest in a series of
attempts by Emmett Burns Sr. to evict
the 50-member community from a
600-acre tract which he claims he
owns.
Previous unsuccessful eviction ef
forts have included tin; brandishing of
a shotgun by Burns' son, sabotage of
the commune's water tanks and the
appearance of a bulldozer on the
grounds.
I he deputy sheriffs. Edward Peter
man and Leo Mauro. said, "We're just
serving civil papers," as they served
the complaints for unlawful detainer
issued by clerk John kazuikowski in
the North County Branch of the
Superior Court of Santa Clara against
"D.F. Eldridge, Marion T. Eldridge,
Mark Schneider, Robyn Wesley and
Does I through D inclusive."
The plaintiffs listed were Alyce Lee
Burns, wife of Emmett Burns Sr., who
originally sold the property involved
in Donald Eldridge in 1968, and the
law firm of Crist, Crist, Criffiths.
Bryant and Schulz. Palo Alto, Burns'
attorneys.

Complaints for unlawful detainer
give the defendants 30 days to show
cause why they should not he evicted
from tlit' property they are allegedly
occupying unlawfully.
Wesley asked Mauro not to partici
pate in the eviction process because
more harm would be done the more
people cooperated in the eviction pro
cess.
"I'd lose my job if 1 don't." re
sponded Mauro.
After some initial tension, the en
counter between the process servers
and the community residents became
more relaxed, with each side attempt

ing to make its position clear while
de-emphasizing hostile attitudes and
feelings.
Wesley said afterwards, "I feel
pleased that we're going to get an op
portunity to go to court. It's going to
give us an opportunity to show the
courts that there's a great question of
ownership and that in our minds the
land belongs to Mr. (Donald) Kl
dridge."
Schneider said, "My fear is that Mr.
Hums is evicting us because he wants
to develop the land and as a five year
resident on the land, I feel a responsi
bility not to let that happen."


This Land is our land, maybe
