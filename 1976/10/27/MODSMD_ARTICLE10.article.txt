# On 'independence' in South Africa

Glenn Jordan

Yesterday, the Transkei — that
"model Bantustan" — became the first
of the black African "homelands" to
achieve "independence." The Bantus
tans, or "homelands," are relatively
small islands located within the Re
public of South Africa.
Assumed to be ethnically
homogeneous, the land they occupy is.
generally, the worst. The current pol
icy is to make Africans citizens of
these, and of these only. Viewed in
historical context, does the "indepen
dence" of the Transkei reflect a change
in South Africa? What is it about?
It is certainly not about what the
South African government, and, inci
dentally, the "legitimate" U.S. press,
says it is about. Instead, the policy of
granting "independence;" to the Ban
tustans has to do with insuring con
tinued economic exploitation of Afri
can labor power at minimal cost to
white South Africa. After all. what is
the South African social formation if it
is not a labor control system?
On the other hand, it has to do with
some political considerations. What
does all this mean?
It is a well-known fact that the aver
age standard of living enjoyed by
South African whites is the highest in
the world. This position of relative
privilege is directly traceable to the
exploitation of black African labor
power — in the mines, in domestic
work, in secondary industry, on the
white settler farms. . . .
S. African state and labor
Since its inception in 1910, the
South African state has attempted to
guarantee the production and repro
duction of cheap, docile politically
emasculated African labor power.
Originally, this was attempted for the
benefit of newly-established mining
interests; later, for the benefit of par
ticular groups of white capitalists
and or white workers.
This production and reproduction
has been accomplished through the
use of three "state apparatuses": the

repressive (the army, the police, the
priests, etc.), the ideological (the press,
the schools and colleges, literature,
etc.), and the legal (legislation and the
court systems).
Let's focus on the legal.
In the history of South Africa, there
are innumerable pieces of legislation
having to do with such matters as
alienating black labor from the means
of production especially the land in
the non-capitalist sector; controlling
the internal movement of that labor
once it has been "freed"; and insuring
that the labor market it enters will be a
racially stratified one.
Long pattern
The pattern for such legislation
began even before the formation of
South Africa as a state. The notorious
Masters and Servants Acts were pas
sed between 1856and 1904. And. once
the state was formed, a whole package
of legislation dealing with the three
factors listed above was passed (e.g., in
the early period, the Mines and Works
Act of 1911, the Native Land Act of
191.5 and the various pass laws).
This set the pattern, though, of
course, there has been some variation
on the theme, as a function of such
factors as shifts in power relations
among the ruling political and
economic elites.
The latest of the major politico-legal
measures taken by the South African
state is that of beginning to "free" the
Bantustans. But there is really no fre
eing here. For the attempt is to create a
situation in which Africans would be
forced to work in the republic (since
the "homelands" are too im
poverished and "underdeveloped" to
support all the people contained in
them), but would have no rights to
housing, political participation, etc.,
there, even if it were the place of their
birth(!).
Extremely vulnerable
The "homelands" are extremely
vulnerable politically and economi
cally. They comprise about 13 percent

of South Africa's total kind area, but
are to be the "homes" of 70 per cent ot
the population. And it is clear that they
will only be able to gainfully employ a
fraction of these residents.
These areas will be places to "store"
labor not wanted by South Africa.
They will be dependent "puppet
nations."
The attempt to relegate the Bantus
tans to neo-colonial status has been a
quite deliberate move. This explains
such facts as the governments of the

"independent" Bantustans being'put
in the hands of "traditional authority."
Undoubtedly, the South African rul
ing elite, or some large fraction
thereof, feel that concentrating power
i» the hands of conservative, "tradi
tional" African authority should ac
complish several ends simultane
ously: that of working against the de
velopment of ethnic-group-based
nationalism; that of preventing the
emergence to power of new, educated
elites who might "rock the boat"; that
of insuring the hegemony of tlie South
African state.
Hut it seems almost inevitable that,
despite all the effort, this new attempt
at nun-colonialism will ultimately fail,

some political considerations. What
does all this mean?
It is a well-known fact that the aver
age standard of living enjoyed by
South African whites is the highest in
the world. This position of relative
privilege is directly traceable to the
exploitation of black African labor
power — in the mines, in domestic
work, in secondary industry, on the
white settler farms. . . .
S. African state and labor
Since its inception in 1910, the
South African state has attempted to
guarantee the production and repro
duction of cheap, docile politically
emasculated African labor power.
Originally, this was attempted for the
benefit of newly-established mining
interests; later, for the benefit of par
ticular groups of white capitalists
and or white workers.
This production and reproduction
has been accomplished through the
use of three "state apparatuses": the

repressive (the army, the police, the
priests, etc.), the ideological (the press,
the schools and colleges, literature,
etc.), and the legal (legislation and the
court systems).
Let's focus on the legal.
In the history of South Africa, there
are innumerable pieces of legislation
having to do with such matters as
alienating black labor from the means
of production especially the land in
the non-capitalist sector; controlling
the internal movement of that labor
once it has been "freed"; and insuring
that the labor market it enters will be a
racially stratified one.
Long pattern
The pattern for such legislation
began even before the formation of
South Africa as a state. The notorious
Masters and Servants Acts were pas
sed between 1856and 1904. And. once
the state was formed, a whole package
of legislation dealing with the three
factors listed above was passed (e.g., in
the early period, the Mines and Works
Act of 1911, the Native Land Act of
191.5 and the various pass laws).
This set the pattern, though, of
course, there has been some variation
on the theme, as a function of such
factors as shifts in power relations
among the ruling political and
economic elites.
The latest of the major politico-legal
measures taken by the South African
state is that of beginning to "free" the
Bantustans. But there is really no fre
eing here. For the attempt is to create a
situation in which Africans would be
forced to work in the republic (since
the "homelands" are too im
poverished and "underdeveloped" to
support all the people contained in
them), but would have no rights to
housing, political participation, etc.,
there, even if it were the place of their
birth(!).
Extremely vulnerable
The "homelands" are extremely
vulnerable politically and economi
cally. They comprise about 13 percent

of South Africa's total kind area, but
are to be the "homes" of 70 per cent ot
the population. And it is clear that they
will only be able to gainfully employ a
fraction of these residents.
These areas will be places to "store"
labor not wanted by South Africa.
They will be dependent "puppet
nations."
The attempt to relegate the Bantus
tans to neo-colonial status has been a
quite deliberate move. This explains
such facts as the governments of the

"independent" Bantustans being'put
in the hands of "traditional authority."
Undoubtedly, the South African rul
ing elite, or some large fraction
thereof, feel that concentrating power
i» the hands of conservative, "tradi
tional" African authority should ac
complish several ends simultane
ously: that of working against the de
velopment of ethnic-group-based
nationalism; that of preventing the
emergence to power of new, educated
elites who might "rock the boat"; that
of insuring the hegemony of tlie South
African state.
Hut it seems almost inevitable that,
despite all the effort, this new attempt
at nun-colonialism will ultimately fail,

In the history of South Africa, there
are innumerable pieces of legislation
having to do with such matters as
alienating black labor from the means
of production especially the land in
the non-capitalist sector; controlling
the internal movement of that labor
once it has been "freed"; and insuring
that the labor market it enters will be a
racially stratified one.
Long pattern
The pattern for such legislation
began even before the formation of
South Africa as a state. The notorious
Masters and Servants Acts were pas
sed between 1856and 1904. And. once
the state was formed, a whole package
of legislation dealing with the three
factors listed above was passed (e.g., in
the early period, the Mines and Works
Act of 1911, the Native Land Act of
191.5 and the various pass laws).
This set the pattern, though, of
course, there has been some variation
on the theme, as a function of such
factors as shifts in power relations
among the ruling political and
economic elites.
The latest of the major politico-legal
measures taken by the South African
state is that of beginning to "free" the
Bantustans. But there is really no fre
eing here. For the attempt is to create a
situation in which Africans would be
forced to work in the republic (since
the "homelands" are too im
poverished and "underdeveloped" to
support all the people contained in
them), but would have no rights to
housing, political participation, etc.,
there, even if it were the place of their
birth(!).
Extremely vulnerable
The "homelands" are extremely
vulnerable politically and economi
cally. They comprise about 13 percent

of South Africa's total kind area, but
are to be the "homes" of 70 per cent ot
the population. And it is clear that they
will only be able to gainfully employ a
fraction of these residents.
These areas will be places to "store"
labor not wanted by South Africa.
They will be dependent "puppet
nations."
The attempt to relegate the Bantus
tans to neo-colonial status has been a
quite deliberate move. This explains
such facts as the governments of the

"independent" Bantustans being'put
in the hands of "traditional authority."
Undoubtedly, the South African rul
ing elite, or some large fraction
thereof, feel that concentrating power
i» the hands of conservative, "tradi
tional" African authority should ac
complish several ends simultane
ously: that of working against the de
velopment of ethnic-group-based
nationalism; that of preventing the
emergence to power of new, educated
elites who might "rock the boat"; that
of insuring the hegemony of tlie South
African state.

despite all the effort, this new attempt
at nun-colonialism will ultimately fail,

Yesterday, the Transkei — that
"model Bantustan" — became the first
of the black African "homelands" to
achieve "independence." The Bantus
tans, or "homelands," are relatively
small islands located within the Re
public of South Africa.
Assumed to be ethnically
homogeneous, the land they occupy is.
generally, the worst. The current pol
icy is to make Africans citizens of
these, and of these only. Viewed in
historical context, does the "indepen
dence" of the Transkei reflect a change
in South Africa? What is it about?
It is certainly not about what the
South African government, and, inci
dentally, the "legitimate" U.S. press,
says it is about. Instead, the policy of
granting "independence;" to the Ban
tustans has to do with insuring con
tinued economic exploitation of Afri
can labor power at minimal cost to
white South Africa. After all. what is
the South African social formation if it
is not a labor control system?
On the other hand, it has to do with
some political considerations. What
does all this mean?
It is a well-known fact that the aver
age standard of living enjoyed by
South African whites is the highest in
the world. This position of relative
privilege is directly traceable to the
exploitation of black African labor
power — in the mines, in domestic
work, in secondary industry, on the
white settler farms. . . .
S. African state and labor
Since its inception in 1910, the
South African state has attempted to
guarantee the production and repro
duction of cheap, docile politically
emasculated African labor power.
Originally, this was attempted for the
benefit of newly-established mining
interests; later, for the benefit of par
ticular groups of white capitalists
and or white workers.
This production and reproduction
has been accomplished through the
use of three "state apparatuses": the

repressive (the army, the police, the
priests, etc.), the ideological (the press,
the schools and colleges, literature,
etc.), and the legal (legislation and the
court systems).
