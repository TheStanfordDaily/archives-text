# Letter: Prop. 13
## 
### 
Governor Jerry Brown calls it "un
savory," Attorney General Kvelle
Younger says it attracts crime, the
Teamsters are against it and the horse
racing interests fear the competition.
Despite this motley array of bedfel
lows, you may still want to vote
against Prop. 13. to legalize betting on
greyhound races in Galifornia. because
it is a barbarous business.
The greynounds that chase the cute
mechanical rabbit that the public sees
have been trained on even cuter live
rabbits that the public does not see
and for good reason, because it is a
gruesome sight. In a method called
"coursing," generally considered the
best way of getting a dog to chase an
electrical lure, several dogs are sicked
on a rabbit loosed on the track.
The terrified and helpless rabbit,
when the dogs catch up with it. is torn
apart alive, because "bloodying"
makes for keener dogs. Sometimes cats

are used. If coursing is outlawed in
California, dogs are simply imported
from states where it is not.
The dogs themselves don't live hap
pily ever after. Only a small percentage
of the greyhounds bred turn out to he
suitable for racing. The others are kil
led. So. for the most part, are the dogs
that do race. A greyhound's racing
career only lasts about two or three
years.
In other words, dog racing means
grisly torture and death for countless
animals for fun and profit. So, even if
few of the great debaters particularly
send you. there are still some very
good things that can be done in that
ballot booth in November. One of them
is to vote No on Prop. 13.
