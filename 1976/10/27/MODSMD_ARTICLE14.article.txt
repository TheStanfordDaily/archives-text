## Thrupp leads women harriers 
### Bruce Anderson 
Ann Thrupp, Stanford's premier
woman runner, has come (o know vic
tory in its many vagarious forms.
Sometimes her victories have been
walkovers this fall. Other times, such as
last Saturday when she made a wrong
turn late in a race at Chico and had to
come from behind to win by one second,
her triumphs have been anything but
easy.
In all, she has won four of her five races
this fall.
But her biggest victory this fall was
one in which she had no part. The victory
was an Athletic Department decision to
send the sophomore from Santa Ana to
the women's intercollegiate nationals
next month in Madison, Wis.
Unexpected
Of all Thrupps's triumphs, this may
have been most gratifying and the most
unexpected.
A day before the department an
nounced the decision, the slender harrier
was discussing her goals as a runner:
competing in the national meet was at
the top of her list.
"1 wish I could go to the nationals," she
said somewhat hesitantly. She appeared
to reconsider the statement, and then
quickly passed it off as a "futile hope,"
resigning herself to a good performance
in the state AAIJ meet.
But the next day when she received
word that the department had decided to
send her to the championships, she bub
bled with joy.
Pinnacle
To truly appreciate Thrupp's ac
complishments, of which her trip to the
nationals is the pinnacle, one has to

realize that she has been running com
petitively for little over a year.
Last fall Thrupp was practicing bas
ketball in an effort to make the women's
team. During one of the workouts, the
cagers were timed in a two-mile run.
She finished the distance in under 12
minutes, and the coach suggested that
she run with the women's cross country
team which was still being organized at
that time.
First race
Thrupp says she joined the team,
"went out and ran that Saturday and did
well."
She entered that first race with no
competitive experience because, "the
idea of competitive running bothered
me. I associated competition with up
tight feelings. 1 thought it would take
from the fun of running."
Thrupp now admits her fears were un
founded. "I enjoy competition," she
says,"the more experiences of competi
tion, the more advantageous to myself."
Within nine months of her initial taste
of competition, Thrupp entered her first
major national meet. She ran in the na
tional AAU junior meet, in Los Angeles,
and finished ninth in the 3000-meter
run.
Only women
To qualify for the AAU meet, she en
tered the men's intramural two-mile run
last spring. The only woman among 30
or 40 men, Thrupp nevertheless met the
11:10 qualifying qualifying standard
with five seconds to spare.
Before Thrupp joined the cross coun
try team last year, her running experi
ence consisted of occasional runs of two
or three miles.

She now runs between 50 and 60 miles
a week in workouts that alternate be
tween running intervals, to develop
speed, road runs, aimed at distance, and
practice on hills.
'Consistent work'
Both cross country coach Marshall
Clark and Thrupp attribute her success to
"consistent work." Her record speaks for
itself: four wins in five races.
One can get an idea of how much
Thrupp has improved by looking at the
one race she didn't win this season, the
Stanford Invitational.
Thrupp, running with a bad hip,
finished second, five seconds behind
winner Judy Craham. No slouch herself,
Craham participated in the U.S. Olympic
Trials last June.
In 1975, Thrupp finished sixth in the
Invitational, one minute and fifty sec
onds behind winner Tina Anex. This
year Ann finished more that 30 seconds
ahead of her rival.
Newcomer
The Card women's cross country
squad, like Thrupp. is a newcomer to the
sport. And likeall'infants, it is experienc
ing growing pains.
"We're using uniforms and sweats
from the men's team to run in." Ann says.
She indicates, however, that most of the
team accepts the inconvenience rather
well.
She expressed a hope that the women
harriers will gain varsity status.
And while the Athletic Department
may not be ready to grant the women's
cross country team varsity status, it has
taken a positive step by supporting
Thrupp's efforts and sending her to the
nationals.
