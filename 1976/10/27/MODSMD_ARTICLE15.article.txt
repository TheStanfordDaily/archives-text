# Beaver pass defense best in Pac-8
## Cardinals prepare for OSU 
### Chris Baker 
Talk about burning books.
Oregon State coach Craig Fer
tig's initial act was to im
mediately toss the Beavers' game
films from last year's 2-9 season
into the incinerator.
Stanford coach Jack Christian
sen isn't going to burn the films
of USC's 56-0 win over Oregon
State last weekend, but he isn't
going to show them to his
players until they start prepara
tions for the Trojans next week.
'Good team'
"Oregon State's a good foot
ball team," said Christiansen at
his weekly press breakfast yes
terday. "All we have to look at is
the Cal-OSU game or the
Washington-OSU game."
This is the second consecutive
week that the Cards are taking on
a team that is recovering from
the shock of a 50-point loss.
"Sometimes you can just talk
and talk, about how good a team
is, and your players don't lis

ten," said Chris.
It took the Cards 30 minutes to
wake up against Washington
State last weekend. Stanford fi
nally put together a six and one
half-minute scoring drive to sew
up a 22-16 win over the Cougars.
'Tough game'
"After the disappointment of
last week, they'll be much more
pumped up for us," said Christ
iansen. "Oregon State has al
ways been a tough game for us.
"Over the last five years we've
never beaten them by more than
a touchdown." Stanford scored a
28-22 win over the Beavers last
year in Corvallis, Ore.
The Cards, led by fullback Phil
Francis' 135 yards on 28 carries,
gained 216 yards on the ground
last week. Christiansen plans to
come out running against the
Beavers.
"We'll go with a game plan of
running the ball and we'll try to
get the ball to the tight end and
running backs," said Chris. The
OSU defense has allowed 1956
yards on the ground this year.
Pass defense
But the Oregon State pass de
fense. ranked first in the confer
ence, has been superb. The
Beaver secondary is coached by
former USC defensive back Nate
Shaw, the brother of Stanford de
fensive secondary coach Willie
Shaw.
"Oregon State's defense has
played pretty well in all the
games we've seen," said Christ

iansen. "They double cover both
outside receivers and try to dis
rupt them at the line of scrim
mage. They disguise their de
fenses pretty well. Oregon
State is getting a good pass rush.
It's a combination of everything
that seems to be working for
them on defense," said Chris.
Injury problems
The Beavers have been filling
Corvallis hospitals faster than
Swine Flu. Fertig has lost eight
players for the season, including
three quarterbacks. Scott
Richardson, who is slated to start
at quarterback this week, has a
spraineil ankle.
"Our biggest problem this
week is getting a quorum," said
Fertig. "1 don't know if we will
be able to come up with 54
players to take down to Palo
Alto. We do not have enough
people to practice against.
"We may go to the pro style

where our No. 1 offense prac
tices against our No. 1 defense,
and the defense against the of
fense, because they are an out
standing team and very under
rated on defense." said Fertig.
The Card injury situation is
very good this week. Francis has
a sore ankle but he will be ready
to go. Don Stevenson,
who was held out of last week's
game with a pulled muscle, will
start at fullback.
Quarterback Guy Benjamin
and flanker Tony Hill had their
ankles treated Monday, hut both
will start on Saturday.
When Hill catches his first
pass aginst OSU, the officials
will stop the contest and give
him the game ball. The senior
wide reciver will break Gene
Washington's career receiving
record of 122 catches against
Washington State, with his first
catch.

Receiving record
Stanford flanker Tony Hill, shown here against Washington two weeks ago, will be presented
with the game ball when he catches his first pass Saturday. Hill should break Gene
Washington's record for career receptions (122) with his first catch against Oregon State. His
four grabs last week tied Washington's mark.
