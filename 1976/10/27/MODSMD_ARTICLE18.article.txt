Field Hockey
The Card Scotchers racked up
another win yesterday, beating
Hayward State 5-1 at Hayward.
The Cards are now 4-0 on the
season.
It only took four minutes for
Mandy Read to score the Cards'
first goal, off a beautiful assist
from kathv Levinson. Each liked
what the other did. and they ex
changed field maneuvers for the
next goal to make the half-time
score 2-1.
The Scotchers played slowly
the first half, according to coach
Shirley Schoof. This was due in
part to the slower Hayward
fields, and partly because, "we

were not running to meet the ball
enough."
Stanford compensated in the
second half with a tighter de
fense. Goalie Buftie Merger made
seven saves in the first half, but
in the second stanza she "didn't
have to work so hard," said
Schoof. "We kept it out of that
territory."
Stanford also quickened the
pace of the second half with a
more aggressive offense. Sukie
Jackson scored oft another assist
from Levinson three minutes
into the half. Onnie killefer fol
lowed suit with a solo scoop into
the net. Read took it all by herself
for her second goal of the game.
The Cards will meet San Diego

this Friday at San Diego.

The Card Scotchers racked up
another win yesterday, beating
Hayward State 5-1 at Hayward.
The Cards are now 4-0 on the
season.
It only took four minutes for
Mandy Read to score the Cards'
first goal, off a beautiful assist
from kathv Levinson. Each liked
what the other did. and they ex
changed field maneuvers for the
next goal to make the half-time
score 2-1.
The Scotchers played slowly
the first half, according to coach
Shirley Schoof. This was due in
part to the slower Hayward
fields, and partly because, "we

were not running to meet the ball
enough."
Stanford compensated in the
second half with a tighter de
fense. Goalie Buftie Merger made
seven saves in the first half, but
in the second stanza she "didn't
have to work so hard," said
Schoof. "We kept it out of that
territory."
Stanford also quickened the
pace of the second half with a
more aggressive offense. Sukie
Jackson scored oft another assist
from Levinson three minutes
into the half. Onnie killefer fol
lowed suit with a solo scoop into
the net. Read took it all by herself
for her second goal of the game.
The Cards will meet San Diego

this Friday at San Diego.
