# City bans new pinball machines
## 
### Lonnie Rosenwald 
In a move bound to arouse public
controversy, the Palo Alto City Coun
cil last night enacted a surprise mea
sure banning any new installation of
mechanical amusement devices, in
chiding pinball machines and other
coin-operated games throughout the
city.
The moratorium measure, which
wi 11 take effect in six weeks, passed by
a ?>-'A vote, with Councilmen Byron

Sher, Scott Carey and Vice Mayor Roy
("lay dissenting.
Councilman John Berwald proposed
the measure during a discussion of a
proposal for a new ordinance which
calls for licensing of such mechanical
devices in order to control their use. A
city ordinance currently prohibits the
devices entirely. However, this ordi
nance has been unenforced.
The council last night repealed the
old ordinance because of the con

troversy over its constitutionality.
Calling the old ordinance "unen
forceable, unsupportahle, and uncon
stitutional." Carey opposed any legal
restriction on the mechanical games.
"You're assuming all pinball
machines are evil." said Carey.
However, several Palo Alto resi
dents testified last night before the
council contending that "pinball
halls" foster vice and juvenile delin
quency.
After the moratorium measure was
enacted, the Daily interviewed lerry
Brewton, owner of the Amber Lantern
bar and restaurant at his establish
ment. Brewton termed mechanical
games "a harmless amusement."
At Shakev's Pizza Parlor, which has
several pinball machines, employe
Karen Meyer last night told the Daily
that pinball "causes truancy."
She explained, "We get kids in here
at one in the afternoon when they
should be in school."
Berwald, principal proponent of the
drive to rid Palo Alto of pinball activ
ity. attacked the "filthy bestiality and
absolute perversion" of pinball halls
during the council meeting. "They
have no place in a community such as
Palo Alto," he said.
The new six-month moratorium on
new mechanical devices is a prelimi
nary to council consideration of a strict
licensing proposal which was sent
back to the council's legal staff for
further study. It was not immediately
clear whether such an ordinance
would receive the council's support.
License fee
Two further amendments to the pos
sible new ordinance, one which would
have raised the proposed license fee
from $5 to $!()() per machine and
another which woidd have fixed it at

$25 were introduced but defeated.
Last night's move was regarded by
observers of the council proceedings
as a significant and unexpected de
velopment in the pinball controversy.
"What we have is a prohibition,"
noted Evelyn Richards, reporter for the
Palo Alto Times.
One student attending the council
meeting told the Daily that he expects
some opposition to pinball control
from the university community.
"The same puritanical Palo Alto
elements that fought massage parlors
areat it again. First it was good-bye toa
woman's ownership of her own body
with massage parlor law. Then it was
good-bye to the First Amendment with
the controls on adult bookstores and
movie houses. Now it is good-bye to
fun." he said.

devices entirely. However, this ordi
nance has been unenforced.
The council last night repealed the
old ordinance because of the con

troversy over its constitutionality.
Calling the old ordinance "unen
forceable, unsupportahle, and uncon
stitutional." Carey opposed any legal
restriction on the mechanical games.
"You're assuming all pinball
machines are evil." said Carey.
However, several Palo Alto resi
dents testified last night before the
council contending that "pinball
halls" foster vice and juvenile delin
quency.
After the moratorium measure was
enacted, the Daily interviewed lerry
Brewton, owner of the Amber Lantern
bar and restaurant at his establish
ment. Brewton termed mechanical
games "a harmless amusement."
At Shakev's Pizza Parlor, which has
several pinball machines, employe
Karen Meyer last night told the Daily
that pinball "causes truancy."
She explained, "We get kids in here
at one in the afternoon when they
should be in school."
Berwald, principal proponent of the
drive to rid Palo Alto of pinball activ
ity. attacked the "filthy bestiality and
absolute perversion" of pinball halls
during the council meeting. "They
have no place in a community such as
Palo Alto," he said.
The new six-month moratorium on
new mechanical devices is a prelimi
nary to council consideration of a strict
licensing proposal which was sent
back to the council's legal staff for
further study. It was not immediately
clear whether such an ordinance
would receive the council's support.
License fee
Two further amendments to the pos
sible new ordinance, one which would
have raised the proposed license fee
from $5 to $!()() per machine and
another which woidd have fixed it at

$25 were introduced but defeated.
Last night's move was regarded by
observers of the council proceedings
as a significant and unexpected de
velopment in the pinball controversy.
"What we have is a prohibition,"
noted Evelyn Richards, reporter for the
Palo Alto Times.
One student attending the council
meeting told the Daily that he expects
some opposition to pinball control
from the university community.
"The same puritanical Palo Alto
elements that fought massage parlors
areat it again. First it was good-bye toa
woman's ownership of her own body
with massage parlor law. Then it was
good-bye to the First Amendment with
the controls on adult bookstores and
movie houses. Now it is good-bye to
fun." he said.
In a move bound to arouse public
controversy, the Palo Alto City Coun
cil last night enacted a surprise mea
sure banning any new installation of
mechanical amusement devices, in
chiding pinball machines and other
coin-operated games throughout the
city.
The moratorium measure, which
wi 11 take effect in six weeks, passed by
a ?>-'A vote, with Councilmen Byron

Councilman John Berwald proposed
