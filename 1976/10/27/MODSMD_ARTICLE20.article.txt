U.N. condemns Transkei
United Nations, N.Y. — The General Assembly
voted 134-0 yesterday for a resolution condemning
the "sham independence" of Transkei and asking
all nations to shun diplomatic and economic links
with South Africa's black offspring. The United
States was alone in abstaining.
The United States said it was against South Afri
ca's apartheid and tribal homelands policies, and
would not recognize Transkei, but abstained be
cause of certain provisions and "very loose lan
guage" in the resolution.
The resolution was passed at the beginning of the
annual assembly debate on apartheid, the South
African policy of racial separation.
Transkei yesterday became the first of South Af
rica's "bantustans," or black tribal enclaves, to re
ceive independence. Black Africans condemn the
new state as a product of apartheid and foreign
dignitaries stayed away from the independence
ceremonies.
Mack Africans deliberately timed the opening of
assembly debate on apartheid to coincide with
Tra nske is i nd epe nd e nee.
The resolution "strongly condemns" South Afri
ca's policy of setting bantustan tribal homelands,
calling it a design "to consolidate the inhuman
policies of apartheid, to destroy the territorial in
tegrity of the country and to perpetuate white
minority rule."
Kremlin shakeup doubtful
Moscow — The likelihood of a Kremlin shakeup
faded yesterday as a two-day meeting of the Com
munist party's Central Committee ended with the
nation's aging leaders all retaining their powerful
Politburo posts.
Before the meeting, rumors had circulated that
Premier Alexei Kosygin, 72. might be nearing the
end of his career. Kosygi n has been reported to be il 1
and dropped from public view for three months
until reappearing earlier this month.
A Moscow radio communique at the end of the
year's second committee session announced no
changes in the Politburo, whose members, averag
ing close to fi(i years in age. control party and state
policy.
The committee meeting is to be followed today
by the 1976 session of the Soviet parliament,
known as the Supreme Soviet, which technically
could bring changes in Soviet government posi
tions.
But no major changes in the leadership were ex
pected to come following the lack of a party an
nouncement yesterday. And no visible steps were

expected to be taken toward solving succession
problems as Soviet leaders grow older.
Nixon tapes freed for broadcasting
Washington — The U.S. Court of Appeals cleared
the way yesterday for broadcasting of the Nixon
White House tapes played at the Watergate cover
up trial.
But lawyers for former President Richard Nixon
promptly announced they will appeal further be
cause "the effect ... is to permit the commercial
exploitation of the recordings of presidential con
versations subpoenaed tor use in a criminal trial."
The appeals court ruled that "the tapes played at
trial are no longer confidential." The 2-1 decision
returned the case to U.S. District Judge John Sirica
who must develop a plan for release of the record
ings.
"Distribution should be prompt, and on an equal
basis to all persons desiring copies." the court said.
The ruling also permits the sale of the tapes as
recordings.
Included is the so-called "smoking gun" tape of
June 23. 1972 when Nixon ordered that the FBl's
investigation of the Watergate break-in, six days
earlier, be derailed.
Carter talks defense in Chicago
Chicago — Suburban Chicago voters got a mas
sive dose of presidential campaigning yesterday
when President Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter flew
into the area seeking the support that could tip
closely contested Illinois in their favor.
Foreign policy and defense issues were the prin
cipal themes for both candidates as they toured the
Chicago suburbs.
The Democratic candidate talked of how he
would cut waste from the Pentagon budget. And he
sought to counter the president's criticism of Car
ter's statement that he would not send American
troops into Yugoslavia in the event of a Soviet inva
sion of that country.
"I think the world is tired of bluff and blustering
where you insinuate you're going to send troops to
some country when you know your own people
won't let you do it," Carter said.
Later, Carter aides gave out a list of six Ford
statements which they said were commitments
comparable to Carter's statement about Yugoslavia.
State's mental hospitals suffering
Napa — California's state mental hospital system
is suffering from a lack of leadership and in
adequate staffing and is drifting with no firm plan
for the future, a state Senate hearing was told yes

terday.
Furthermore, experimental programs to test the
value of increased professional staffing are being
hampered bv a lack of trained personnel to hire,
witnesses testified.
"I'm greatly concerned about the loss of morale
and other problems, and the lack of leadership."
said Frank James, a former mental hospital director.
"We have seen the mental health system go
under the waves some," continued James, program
chief of the Fresno County Mental Health Program.
"The professional leadership is missing and the
visibility of the mental health system is seen only in
community groups."
The hearing, held by the Senate Health and Wel
fare Committee to discuss proposed standards for
upgrading hospital staffs, heard from a number of
mental health professionals and public officials.
The climate of the sessions reflected recent allega
tions of abuse at state mental hospitals, in particu
lar Camarillo State Hospital and Metropolitan State
Hospital.

mands of Rhodesia's black leaders yesterday for the
