President Richard Lyman indicated
that the university relationship with
the Bank of America probably will not
be affected since the bank's name ap
peared on a Commerce Department list
of businesses planning to participate
in the Arab economic boycott of Israel.
"One has to draw a distinction bet
ween what we will do as an institution
and what we will try to find out about
all the people we deal with," Lyman
said on last night's Cumpus Confer
ence, broadcast from Arroyo Lounge,
Wilbur Hall.
"It is difficult for us to become the
moral policemen of the whole array of
enterprises that we deal with. On the
other hand, we have a distinct respon
sibility to be our own moral policemen
insofar as we think it is compatible
with our objectives," he said.
"I get uneasy when any particular
aspect of a business enterprise's be

havior is made the reason for out
dropping all contact or doing business
with them." Lyman added.
Lyman also commented on student
involvement in tenure decisions.
"Students may be in a good position
to judge some things about a faculty
member's performance, but may be in
a bad position to judge others. Evalua
tion must improve. That seems to me
to be the key to a more satisfactory
position regarding tenure promo
tions," he said.
