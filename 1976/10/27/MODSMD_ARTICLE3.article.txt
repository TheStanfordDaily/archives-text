actually been issued yet. Officials at
Riggs National Bank in Washington
declined to comment on the matter.
The probe was disclosed Sunday by
'/'ln; Washington Post and since then

told federal investigators of making
the gift payments.

and active in Washington society."and
there have been reports linking him
with the Korean Central Intelligence
Agency.
Making gifts to members of Con

gress is not illegal unless it is meant to
influence their action on legislation or
unless it is a campaign contribution
which does not comply with the cam
paign laws.
The government of South Korea yes

alleged gift-giving, terming as "totally
groundless" allegations that Park en
gaged in lobbying activities for that
