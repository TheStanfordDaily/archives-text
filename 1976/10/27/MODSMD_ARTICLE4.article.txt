# The
						Land dispute: 3-sided question
## 
### 
In 1968, Emmett Burns agreed to sell
Atherton businessman Donald El
dridge 750 acres of land that he owned
on upper Page Mill Road near Skyline
Drive.
Eldridge agreed to pay Burns
$600,000 in cash, to sign a note for
$1,450,000 and to assume payments
on a $400,000 assessment from the city
of Palo Alto for the construction of
water and utility lines to the remote
location.
For his $600,000 cash, Eldridge got
clear title to 150 acres; for the
$1,450,000 (which was to be paid off at
the rate of $145,000 per year) he was to
get the other 600 acres, with clear title
to the land going to him in approxi
mate proportion to how much of the
note he had paid; and for the $400,000
the city of Palo Alto would continue to
maintain the utility and water lines
and not bother him.
Rezoned
In 1969, the city began a land study
to decide the future of the property.
The city decided to rezone the prop
erty in 1972 as open space, which dras
tically reduced its commercial value.
Eldridge brought suit against the city
for taking the land, but the case was
thrown out of trial court.
The case was appealed as far as the
California Supreme Court, which af
firmed the reversal of the of the District
Court of Appeals to the effect that it
had to be heard in trial court.
"At issue here," says Frank Cliff, El
dridge's attorney, "is whether the city
must pay and how much."
Meanwhile, by 1973 Eldridge had
paid Burns $725,000 against the
$1.450.000 note. This entitled him, ac
cording to the terms of the original ag
reement, to ownership of 240 of the
remaini 600 acres. In 1974, Eldridge
asked Burns to release the 240 acres to
him. Burns refused.
The Land is horn
During t he late 60s and early 70s, the
Institute for the Study of Non-

Violence, run by folksinger Joan Baey
and her friend and associate Ir.'t
Sandperl. rented space on the prop
erty. When the Institute moved out ii
the early 70s, "a community of persons
associated with the Institute ami
closely identified with the land,
stayed," said Cliff.
"They called themselves The l.air
They remained there, with Eldridg
permission, who appreciated their <
forts to preserve the ecology and keep
motorcyclists from disrupting tin
shallow soil," said Cliff.
Eldridge stopped making his yearlv
payments against the principal and
Burns responded by foreclosing on the
property, asking that he be allowed to
keep the money he had already re
ceived, regain possession of the prop
erty and be paid the balance of the out
standing note. Cliff said bis behavior
was "incredible."
Judge Marshall Hall of the Santa
Clara County Superior Court in 1*175
ruled against Eldridge and in favor of
Burns.
Eviction efforts
Around Labor Day, Emmett Jr. ar
rived on the property and brandished a
shotgun at Obie, a resident of the land,
said Kobyn Wesley, another resident.
Emmett Jr. said he was "just dove
hunting," said Wesley.
Two weeks later, according to Wes
ley and resident Mark Schneider, a
group led by Emmett |r. came up to
The Land and posted a number of "No
trespassing" signs. While they were
doing this, others in the group drained
out 15.000 gallons of water from the
community's 25,000 gallon cistern
and entirely emptied their smaller
75UU gallon tank.
And on Oct. 15, a bulldozer hired bv
the Burnses arrived on the land early
in the morning, with the intention of
demolishing the residents' hand-made
houses. It was immediately sur
rounded by 30 residents who eventu
ally persuaded the driver to withdraw,
which he did.
