# Nobel winner to take post

### George Anders 
Milton Friedman, this year's Nobel laureate in
economics, has accepted a post as a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution, beginning Dec. 1.
Friedman, currently an economics professor at the Uni
versity of Chicago, said "personal reasons figured largely
in my decision." Several of his relatives live on the West
Coast, he explained.
But Friedman said academic reasons as well as "good
computer facilities and an excellent library" here also led
him to accept the appointment.
"We're delighted to have him," said Hoover Institution
Director Glenn Campbell. "I've known and admired
Friedman for many years."
Friedman received his Nobel prize last week for his
work on consumption analysis, monetary history and
theory, and for demonstrating the complexity of economic
stabilization policies.
While at Hoover, Friedman said he expects to continue
doing the same kind of research he has done in the last 40
years.

Although his appointment begins in January, "the ap
pointment won't become active until fall 1977," Friedman
said. He said he will work as a visiting scholar at the San
Francisco branch of the Federal Reserve Hank until March
and then vacation in Vermont.
Hoover Senior Fellow Thomas Moore said he expects
Friedman will be "a valuable resource to all of us." adding
that other fellows will be able to "bounce their ideas off of
him."
Friedman will be free of teaching and administrative
duties while at the institution, Moore said.
Friedman's appointment will be for five years and was
made before the Nobel prize was announced, Campbell
said.
The appointment arose through a mutual meeting of
minds, Campbell explained, although "we would have
been happy to go out and seek him."
Friedman is a columnist for Newsweek, a former presi
dent of the American Economics Association and the au
thor of several books including Capitalism and Freedom.
