# Carta Hills endorses Ford
## 
### Marc Strassman 
U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
(MUD) Carla Mills said she supports President Gerald
Ford's bid for re-election and has been campaigning for
him "on every occasion I get."
In a Daily interview at San Francisco Airport last
Wednesday. Mills, who was returning to Washington,
D C. after a speaking engagement in San Diego, said. "I
rather feel that I almost have a constitutional obligation
to describe what our policies are and what our visions
for the future might be if returned to office and I'm very
excited about MUD. I worry about changes which I
think would be detrimental."
Mills, a 1«)55 Stanford graduate and last
June's commencement speaker, is not so enthusiastic
about Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter.
"The governor has given very little specificity with
respect to his overall (housing) programs.
"Me has stated on several occasions that he would
subsidize housing starts in this country to the level of
2Vi million units a year. I think this would be extremely
counter-prod uctive."
Republican policies
She then explained in detail how the Democratic
program of subsidizing new housing construction
under the provisions of the Mousing Act of IHfiB had
"literally ripped our cities apart" by creating "a tre
mendous overproduction that was artificially stimu
lated."
She said that now as a result of current Republican
policies, which are based on the Section H provisions of
the Housing and Community Development Act of
1 ;)74, which provide subsidies to landlords so that

low-income families may obtain already-built housing
in urban areas otherwise not available to them, "there's
no question the housing recovery is just (moving) right
along."
She said she did not think that Ford's recent decision
to turn $1.6 billion in advanced weapons over to Israel
was a political decision.
She acknowledged that "in some areas I've been dis
appointed" with the general level of the presidential
campaign, and said, "If the people, the electorate, this
being a democracy, show an interest in frivolous is
sues, then they will be given frivolous issues."
Hills refused to comment on a recent dispute bet
ween her husband. Roderick Mills, chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and Secretary of
Commerce Elliot Richardson over the release of infor
mation on corporate bribery.
"I don't think I should interpose myself on that.
Reasonable minds often differ on serious issues. Me
{Richardson) remains a very close friend of the family."
Females in government
Having reached a position in government and soci
ety enjoyed today by few other women. Mills said she
was not interested in promoting women solely on the
basis of their sex.
"1 think that government desperately needs talented
people. I think women are talented, they're a large
segment of the population. If you want to get your most
talented people you'd better screen through every
single person, woman, minority and what have you to
get the best people you can. I want to do all I can to help
both for women, but more for the nation."

D C. after a speaking engagement in San Diego, said. "I
rather feel that I almost have a constitutional obligation
to describe what our policies are and what our visions
for the future might be if returned to office and I'm very
excited about MUD. I worry about changes which I
think would be detrimental."
Mills, a 1«)55 Stanford graduate and last
June's commencement speaker, is not so enthusiastic
about Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter.
"The governor has given very little specificity with
respect to his overall (housing) programs.
"Me has stated on several occasions that he would
subsidize housing starts in this country to the level of
2Vi million units a year. I think this would be extremely
counter-prod uctive."
Republican policies
She then explained in detail how the Democratic
program of subsidizing new housing construction
under the provisions of the Mousing Act of IHfiB had
"literally ripped our cities apart" by creating "a tre
mendous overproduction that was artificially stimu
lated."
She said that now as a result of current Republican
policies, which are based on the Section H provisions of
the Housing and Community Development Act of
1 ;)74, which provide subsidies to landlords so that

low-income families may obtain already-built housing
in urban areas otherwise not available to them, "there's
no question the housing recovery is just (moving) right
along."
She said she did not think that Ford's recent decision
to turn $1.6 billion in advanced weapons over to Israel
was a political decision.
She acknowledged that "in some areas I've been dis
appointed" with the general level of the presidential
campaign, and said, "If the people, the electorate, this
being a democracy, show an interest in frivolous is
sues, then they will be given frivolous issues."
Hills refused to comment on a recent dispute bet
ween her husband. Roderick Mills, chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and Secretary of
Commerce Elliot Richardson over the release of infor
mation on corporate bribery.
"I don't think I should interpose myself on that.
Reasonable minds often differ on serious issues. Me
{Richardson) remains a very close friend of the family."
Females in government
Having reached a position in government and soci
ety enjoyed today by few other women. Mills said she
was not interested in promoting women solely on the
basis of their sex.
"1 think that government desperately needs talented
people. I think women are talented, they're a large
segment of the population. If you want to get your most
talented people you'd better screen through every
single person, woman, minority and what have you to
get the best people you can. I want to do all I can to help
both for women, but more for the nation."
