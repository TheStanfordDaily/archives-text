Warfield, Lobdell

Our community faces a difficult
political decision next week. Students
and faculty arc.' understandably torn
between voting for a congressman we
have admired, respected, and trusted,
despite occasional disagreements,
and a younger idealist who has proven
his liberal credentials.
Nevertheless, those of us who intend
to vote next Tuesday must decide
whether to vote for Rep. Pete McClos
key (R-Menlo Park) or David Harris.
We believe the community should not
vote McCloskey out of office.
McCloskey represents a set of ethical
and political standards comparable to
virtually no other politician. He has
incurred tin; wrath of his party and
most special interest groups by refus
ing to bend to political pressures.
It was on this campus in February,
I<)7 1, that McCloskey told an overflow
audience of anti-war protestors that
one possible way to end the war in
Vietnam was to begin a national
dialogue on the impeachment of
Richard Nixon.
McCloskey has repeatedly put con
viction in front of political expe
diency. and he has earned a reputation
throughout the nation as a con
gressman independent of both politi
cal parties, labor unions, corpora
tions. and the special interests.
McCloskey has actively worked for
amnesty, a woman's right to an abor
tion. an end to the death penalty, a ban
on handguns, decriminalization of
marijuana, passage of the Equal Rights
Amendment Rights Hill, repealing our
trade embargo on Vietnam, admitting
Vietnam to the U.N.. and against the
13-1 bomber.
McCloskey became a recognized
leader in the environmental move
ment for his role in sponsoring the first
Earth Day. McCloskey led the effort
last spring to save the nation's wet
lands from commercial developments.
He was the only member of his sub
committee fighting to save the por
poises from tuna fishermen when
Chairman Robert Leggett tried to push
an anti-porpoise bill through the

House.
McCloskey was instrumental in
drafting this year's Coastal Zone Man
agement Act Amendments â€” work tor
which lie received the "Environmental
Congressman of the Year Award" from
the California Coastal Alliance. I le au
thored theTule Elk Protection bill, re
cently enacted into law. Me has been
endorsed by the respected League of
Conservation Voters.
McCloskey has consistently sup
ported education hills, the school
lunch program, the food stamp prog
ram. the need for ;i national health in
surance system, the right of all con
struction unions to picket a common
work strike and is against right-to
work laws. He supports Prop. 14.
He was a congressional delegate to
the Law of the Sea Conference and con
tinues to work hard in this area.
McCloskey was one of the chiet
House authors of the Government-in
the-Sunshine legislation, which opens
up nearly all government meeting to
the public.
He favors the establishment of per
manent .oversight Select Commit
tees on the CIA, and introduced the
first bill to limit theCIA to intelligence
gathering only.
McCloskey was publicly credited by
Ralph Nader with the House's passage
of the Consumer Protection Agency
bill.
He is an outspoken supporter of
energy conservation, and one of the
few people in Congress willing to sup
port gas rationing in order to conserve.
McCloskey is not afraid to stand on
his record, and has always urged hon
est discussion of the difficult issues
which face our country. He wants to
present the voters with an open and
honest view of who he is, and he has
offered everyone ample opportunity to
hear him debate, to ask him questions,
to challenge his positions.
If we don't support McCloskey, what
can we ever expect of our politicians?
