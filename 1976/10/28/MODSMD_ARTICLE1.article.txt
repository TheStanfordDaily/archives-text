# Band incurs $4000 deficit, and doesn't travel to Michigan
## 
### Mike Charlson 
Poor planning and an absence of fi
nancial records which resulted in an
over-expenditure of about $1000 last
year has prompted the band to insti
tute a new financial accounting sys
tem, according to Band Manager Kent
Blumberg.
Last year's fall trip expenses ex
ceeded band official estimates thus re
quiring the band to spend about $4000
which was supposed to be carried over
from last year's account and applied to
this year's anticipated expenses.
When the band asked for a two
quarter fee assessment in spring, 1975,
William Wick, 1975 band manager,
told students that the trip to Penn
State, Michigan and other alumni and
freshman functions in the fall would
cost an estimated $12,000 and the
winter trip to Washington would cost
about $4000 for a total anticipated ex
penditure of $16,000.
Fee assessments are voted in $1 in
crements which would provide about
$10,000 per quarter for the group. The
band, therefore, requested a $1 as

sessment for two quarters which
would provide them with about
$20,000 for the year. The band in
cluded with their request a promise to
keep the leftover money ($4000) for
use the following year, according to
Wick.
No leftover
The band was voted another $20,000
in assessments this year, however,
with no mention of the $4000 which
was meant to be leftoverand applied to
anticipated expenses this year.
Initial cost estimates for last year's
fall trip were made for 80 band mem
bers. However, 100 members made the
trip, hiking anticipated costs up 25 per
cent, said Wick.
In addition, Wick said he neglected
to include the $500 travel expenses for
Hand Advisor Arthur Barnes. This, he
claims, accounts for the originally an
ticipated surplus.
"My estimate wasn't really all that
far off," Wick said. "Had only HO
members traveled, it would have been
almost exactly right."
Nonetheless the estimation error left

the band with hardly any funds for this
year, so another two-quarter assess
ment was requested, said Wick.
The request last spring was also ap
parently poorly estimated as well. An
April 7, 1976 article in the Daily
quoted Blumberg as listing trips to
Michigan and Penn State during the
fall plus a winter trip to Oregon as the
things money was to be spent on. At
that time, Blumberg stated, "The trip
to Michigan will be particularly im
portant if the game is televised."
Michigan stop dropped
Later in the spring, after the assess
ment was approved, the band an
nounced that it would not travel to
Michigan, though, because of a poor
reception the year before. The fact that
the game was not televised was also a
major contributing factor to the rever
sal.
Blumberg explained that "\\e never
bound ourselves to go to Michigan. I
don't agree that they (the students)
voted (for the assessment) under that
assumption." The manager said the
band had only committed itself to
spend the money on "out-of-state
trips."
The band records kept by the ASSU
show one problem—a lack of records
within the band hierarchy itself with
respect to their finances.
This year's band officers said they
do not know about expenditures made
last year. "Before January, I had no
contact with the money," Blumberg
said. "Bill Wick kept no records."
Wick substantiated this.
No accurate estimates of costs were
presented to the ASSU when the band
petitioned for a fee assessment.
New officer
According to Blumberg, though,
this trend of irresponsibility is being
phased out. A band treasurer, instead
of an assistant manager, will be re
sponsible for keeping account of band
funds beginning spring.
Transactions within the ASSU ac
count for the band showed no ir
regularities. As of Oct. 26, the band
account balance was $525.91. How
ever, they have not received their au
tumn quarter fee assessment or paid
the eastern trip expenses.

Reimbursements to band members
are for gas and oil for the trip only.
Those who fly receive about 10 per
cent of their costs. This contrasts with
reimbursements for gas, oil, and $2 per
day for food for those who drove, and
about 23 per cent reimbursemet for
plane fares last year.
Blumberg said that this fall's costs ot
food and lodging totalled nearly $100
per person and were paid by those who
went on the trip.
The cost of this year's fall trip is es
timated at about $12,000, a substantial
decrease to last year's expenses, said
Blumberg.
"If we don't use all of the money.
ASSI! will keep it in an interest
earning account," according to Blum
berg. "If future bands can keep their
records straight, maybe there will
come a year when we won't need a fee
assessment to make our fall trip.'' '
However, Assistant Manager Rich
Johnson said, "We will likely use all
the money tliis year," although he said
he did not know exactly what this
year's expenditure will be.

within the band hierarchy itself with
respect to their finances.
This year's band officers said they
do not know about expenditures made
last year. "Before January, I had no
contact with the money," Blumberg
said. "Bill Wick kept no records."
Wick substantiated this.
No accurate estimates of costs were
presented to the ASSU when the band
petitioned for a fee assessment.

According to Blumberg, though,
this trend of irresponsibility is being
phased out. A band treasurer, instead
of an assistant manager, will be re
sponsible for keeping account of band
funds beginning spring.
Transactions within the ASSU ac
count for the band showed no ir
regularities. As of Oct. 26, the band
account balance was $525.91. How
ever, they have not received their au
tumn quarter fee assessment or paid
the eastern trip expenses.

Reimbursements to band members
are for gas and oil for the trip only.
Those who fly receive about 10 per
cent of their costs. This contrasts with
reimbursements for gas, oil, and $2 per
day for food for those who drove, and
about 23 per cent reimbursemet for
plane fares last year.
Blumberg said that this fall's costs ot
food and lodging totalled nearly $100
per person and were paid by those who
went on the trip.
The cost of this year's fall trip is es
timated at about $12,000, a substantial
decrease to last year's expenses, said
Blumberg.
"If we don't use all of the money.
ASSI! will keep it in an interest
earning account," according to Blum
berg. "If future bands can keep their
records straight, maybe there will
come a year when we won't need a fee
assessment to make our fall trip.'' '
However, Assistant Manager Rich
Johnson said, "We will likely use all
the money tliis year," although he said
he did not know exactly what this
year's expenditure will be.


Labor treaty
The university and United Stanford Employees (USE) signed a new
three-year contract yesterday, which had been approved by union mem-

bers Oct. 19. Shown here signing the contract are university Vice Presi
dent for Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig (left) and USE President Roger
Hardy (center).
Poor planning and an absence of fi
nancial records which resulted in an
over-expenditure of about $1000 last
year has prompted the band to insti
tute a new financial accounting sys
tem, according to Band Manager Kent
Blumberg.
Last year's fall trip expenses ex
ceeded band official estimates thus re
quiring the band to spend about $4000
which was supposed to be carried over
from last year's account and applied to
this year's anticipated expenses.
When the band asked for a two
quarter fee assessment in spring, 1975,
William Wick, 1975 band manager,
told students that the trip to Penn
State, Michigan and other alumni and
freshman functions in the fall would
cost an estimated $12,000 and the
winter trip to Washington would cost
about $4000 for a total anticipated ex
penditure of $16,000.
Fee assessments are voted in $1 in
crements which would provide about
$10,000 per quarter for the group. The
band, therefore, requested a $1 as

sessment for two quarters which
would provide them with about
$20,000 for the year. The band in
cluded with their request a promise to
keep the leftover money ($4000) for
use the following year, according to
Wick.
No leftover
The band was voted another $20,000
in assessments this year, however,
with no mention of the $4000 which
was meant to be leftoverand applied to
anticipated expenses this year.
Initial cost estimates for last year's
fall trip were made for 80 band mem
bers. However, 100 members made the
trip, hiking anticipated costs up 25 per
cent, said Wick.
In addition, Wick said he neglected
to include the $500 travel expenses for
Hand Advisor Arthur Barnes. This, he
claims, accounts for the originally an
ticipated surplus.
"My estimate wasn't really all that
far off," Wick said. "Had only HO
members traveled, it would have been
almost exactly right."
Nonetheless the estimation error left

the band with hardly any funds for this
year, so another two-quarter assess
ment was requested, said Wick.
The request last spring was also ap
parently poorly estimated as well. An
April 7, 1976 article in the Daily
quoted Blumberg as listing trips to
Michigan and Penn State during the
fall plus a winter trip to Oregon as the
things money was to be spent on. At
that time, Blumberg stated, "The trip
to Michigan will be particularly im
portant if the game is televised."
Michigan stop dropped
Later in the spring, after the assess
ment was approved, the band an
nounced that it would not travel to
Michigan, though, because of a poor
reception the year before. The fact that
the game was not televised was also a
major contributing factor to the rever
sal.
Blumberg explained that "\\e never
bound ourselves to go to Michigan. I
don't agree that they (the students)
voted (for the assessment) under that
assumption." The manager said the
band had only committed itself to
spend the money on "out-of-state
trips."

$10,000 per quarter for the group. The
band, therefore, requested a $1 as

sessment for two quarters which
would provide them with about
$20,000 for the year. The band in
cluded with their request a promise to
keep the leftover money ($4000) for
use the following year, according to
Wick.
No leftover
The band was voted another $20,000
in assessments this year, however,
with no mention of the $4000 which
was meant to be leftoverand applied to
anticipated expenses this year.
Initial cost estimates for last year's
fall trip were made for 80 band mem
bers. However, 100 members made the
trip, hiking anticipated costs up 25 per
cent, said Wick.
In addition, Wick said he neglected
to include the $500 travel expenses for
Hand Advisor Arthur Barnes. This, he
claims, accounts for the originally an
ticipated surplus.
"My estimate wasn't really all that
far off," Wick said. "Had only HO
members traveled, it would have been
almost exactly right."
Nonetheless the estimation error left

the band with hardly any funds for this
year, so another two-quarter assess
ment was requested, said Wick.
The request last spring was also ap
parently poorly estimated as well. An
April 7, 1976 article in the Daily
quoted Blumberg as listing trips to
Michigan and Penn State during the
fall plus a winter trip to Oregon as the
things money was to be spent on. At
that time, Blumberg stated, "The trip
to Michigan will be particularly im
portant if the game is televised."
Michigan stop dropped
Later in the spring, after the assess
ment was approved, the band an
nounced that it would not travel to
Michigan, though, because of a poor
reception the year before. The fact that
the game was not televised was also a
major contributing factor to the rever
sal.
Blumberg explained that "\\e never
bound ourselves to go to Michigan. I
don't agree that they (the students)
voted (for the assessment) under that
assumption." The manager said the
band had only committed itself to
spend the money on "out-of-state
trips."
The band records kept by the ASSU
show one problem—a lack of records
within the band hierarchy itself with
respect to their finances.
This year's band officers said they
do not know about expenditures made
last year. "Before January, I had no
contact with the money," Blumberg
said. "Bill Wick kept no records."
Wick substantiated this.
No accurate estimates of costs were
presented to the ASSU when the band
petitioned for a fee assessment.
New officer
According to Blumberg, though,
this trend of irresponsibility is being
phased out. A band treasurer, instead
of an assistant manager, will be re
sponsible for keeping account of band
funds beginning spring.
Transactions within the ASSU ac
count for the band showed no ir
regularities. As of Oct. 26, the band
account balance was $525.91. How
ever, they have not received their au
tumn quarter fee assessment or paid
the eastern trip expenses.

Reimbursements to band members
are for gas and oil for the trip only.
Those who fly receive about 10 per
cent of their costs. This contrasts with
reimbursements for gas, oil, and $2 per
day for food for those who drove, and
about 23 per cent reimbursemet for
plane fares last year.
Blumberg said that this fall's costs ot
food and lodging totalled nearly $100
per person and were paid by those who
went on the trip.
The cost of this year's fall trip is es
timated at about $12,000, a substantial
decrease to last year's expenses, said
Blumberg.
"If we don't use all of the money.
ASSI! will keep it in an interest
earning account," according to Blum
berg. "If future bands can keep their
records straight, maybe there will
come a year when we won't need a fee
assessment to make our fall trip.'' '
However, Assistant Manager Rich
Johnson said, "We will likely use all
the money tliis year," although he said
he did not know exactly what this
year's expenditure will be.

Poor planning and an absence of fi
nancial records which resulted in an
over-expenditure of about $1000 last
year has prompted the band to insti
tute a new financial accounting sys
tem, according to Band Manager Kent
Blumberg.
Last year's fall trip expenses ex
ceeded band official estimates thus re
quiring the band to spend about $4000
which was supposed to be carried over
from last year's account and applied to
this year's anticipated expenses.
When the band asked for a two
quarter fee assessment in spring, 1975,
William Wick, 1975 band manager,
told students that the trip to Penn
State, Michigan and other alumni and
freshman functions in the fall would
cost an estimated $12,000 and the
winter trip to Washington would cost
about $4000 for a total anticipated ex
penditure of $16,000.
