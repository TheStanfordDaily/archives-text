# Pamphlet on McCloskey accurate

David Harris

During the closing minutes of the debate held on
Oct. 14 at the Stanford I .aw School between Rep.
Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) and myself,
McCloskey made a number of claims that I feel
require a personal response. Basically, he charged
that our pamphlet Has Our Maverick Become a
Ford? seriously distorted his voting record.
The pamphlet in question contains selected votes
that represent a side of McCloskey's record that is
unknown to most voters. Of course, any process of
vote selection will inevitably present an incom
plete picture. But selection per so is not distortion.
It is not my responsibility to present McCloskey's
view of his record —he must do that. Additional
problems in evaluating his voting record are inhe
rent in McCloskey's repeated practice of voting
both for and against a specific bill at various times
in its history.
Immediately after the debate I asked McCloskey
to forward to me his specific objections. Upon re
viewing them, and restudying his votes. I have con
cluded that our description of his record was fair
and in some ways an understated representation.
Let's look again at that record.
Voting with Ford
In the pamphlet, we noted that McCloskey voted
with the Ford administration r .iore often than Barry
Coldwater Jr. (64 per cent of the time).
At the debate, McCloskey said this is because
Coldwater was running for the U.S. Senate and
wasn't present as often. In fact, Coldwater had a
betterattendance record than McCloskey, both on
the floor (15 per cent to 18 per cent absent) and in
committee (36 to 56 per cent).
The pamphlet stated that McCloskey voted
against banning military aid to countries which
don't respect basic human rights. McCloskey
claims this bill would have also cut off economic
aid. The fact is that the Harkin amendment specifi
cally provides that if "the president determines that
such aid will directly benefit the needy people"

then the president may continue such aid. There
fore, not only is his argument false, but the intent,
as we described it, of banning military aid is clear.
The pamphlet further stated that McCloskey
voted against prohibiting the use of federal funds
for political assassination. McCloskey claims that
he voted against the amendment in question be
cause it would have banned the CIA from interven
ing in a covert fashion in the political process of
other nations in peace time. For example, he
claimed that the bill would prohibit the possibility
of the CIA financing opposition newspapers to the
Chilean junta. McCloskey's vote, and his dubious
defense of it, call his whole attitude toward the CIA
into even more critical question.
Against expedition
Another McCloskey vote in Aug. 1976 was
against expediting passage of a major congres
sional Day Care bill. He claims that he only voted to
follow the house rule (which is commonly waived)
that requ ires a bill be left on the floor for three days
after committee approval.
The fact is, there was a recess scheduled within
those three days. If McCloskey's position had won.
then the bill couldn't have been considered until
after Congress had reconvened. The result would
have been the closure of many day care centers
since their funding would have expired. Fortu
nately, despite McCloskey's vote, the house rules
were waived, the bill came to the floor, and the day
care centers were funded.
Of course, any vigorously pursued campaign is
going to make some errors, and this campaign is no
exception. After re-researching his stands, we dis
covered that two of McCloskey's complaints were
warranted.
First, his record concerning the elderly is not
impressive, but the rating we cited by the National
Alliance of Senior Citizens is not a good reflection
of that record. Second, when the pamphlet was
printed, it had stated correctly that McCloskey had

lost the endorsement of theLeagueof Conservation
Voters. Only after intense lobbying, did the league
reverse their position (on the eve of the debate
here). We have gladly corrected our references to
these matters, and have reissued a corrected second
edition of the pamphlet.
'SDSer'
However, McGloskey's campaign has not been
free of inaccuracies. He has pictured me as an
"SDSer" and an anarchist. In fact, throughout the
1960s I never joined theSDS (Students for a Democ
ratic Society), but steadfastly represented nonvio
lence wherever I went. To the press, he has cast me
as a socialist and an opponent of the free enterprise
system, yet he has publicly acknowledged my
strong support for small business and competition.
He has said I favor the army's right to strike, yet
he has heard me say repeatedly that 1 do not. He has
characterized me as someone only pretending to be
a Democrat, despite the endorsements of Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) and Governor Jerry Brown to the
contrary.
In all the time I've spent trying to change the
course of national policy, no one has ever made
these kinds of accusations. Even those with whom I
deeply disagreed over the war in Vietnam recog
nized that I am a person of principle, integrity, and
honesty, who says what he means and backs it up
when the time comes.
I would like to thank the Stanford community for
your generous support and I trust this column has
helped to demonstrate that our pamphlet, Has Our
Maverick Become A Ford?, is in fact an accurate
description of McCloskey's record. Pick one up and
judge McCloskey for yourself. And when Nov. 2
comes, vote on the real policy differences between
McCloskey and myself. That's what this campaign
is about. Thank you.

covered that two of McCloskey's complaints were
warranted.
First, his record concerning the elderly is not
impressive, but the rating we cited by the National
Alliance of Senior Citizens is not a good reflection
of that record. Second, when the pamphlet was
printed, it had stated correctly that McCloskey had

lost the endorsement of theLeagueof Conservation
Voters. Only after intense lobbying, did the league
reverse their position (on the eve of the debate
here). We have gladly corrected our references to
these matters, and have reissued a corrected second
edition of the pamphlet.
'SDSer'
However, McGloskey's campaign has not been
free of inaccuracies. He has pictured me as an
"SDSer" and an anarchist. In fact, throughout the
1960s I never joined theSDS (Students for a Democ
ratic Society), but steadfastly represented nonvio
lence wherever I went. To the press, he has cast me
as a socialist and an opponent of the free enterprise
system, yet he has publicly acknowledged my
strong support for small business and competition.
He has said I favor the army's right to strike, yet
he has heard me say repeatedly that 1 do not. He has
characterized me as someone only pretending to be
a Democrat, despite the endorsements of Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) and Governor Jerry Brown to the
contrary.
In all the time I've spent trying to change the
course of national policy, no one has ever made
these kinds of accusations. Even those with whom I
deeply disagreed over the war in Vietnam recog
nized that I am a person of principle, integrity, and
honesty, who says what he means and backs it up
when the time comes.
I would like to thank the Stanford community for
your generous support and I trust this column has
helped to demonstrate that our pamphlet, Has Our
Maverick Become A Ford?, is in fact an accurate
description of McCloskey's record. Pick one up and
judge McCloskey for yourself. And when Nov. 2
comes, vote on the real policy differences between
McCloskey and myself. That's what this campaign
is about. Thank you.

During the closing minutes of the debate held on
Oct. 14 at the Stanford I .aw School between Rep.
Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) and myself,
McCloskey made a number of claims that I feel
require a personal response. Basically, he charged
that our pamphlet Has Our Maverick Become a
Ford? seriously distorted his voting record.
The pamphlet in question contains selected votes
that represent a side of McCloskey's record that is
unknown to most voters. Of course, any process of
vote selection will inevitably present an incom
plete picture. But selection per so is not distortion.
It is not my responsibility to present McCloskey's
view of his record —he must do that. Additional
problems in evaluating his voting record are inhe
rent in McCloskey's repeated practice of voting
both for and against a specific bill at various times
in its history.
Immediately after the debate I asked McCloskey
to forward to me his specific objections. Upon re
viewing them, and restudying his votes. I have con
cluded that our description of his record was fair
and in some ways an understated representation.
Let's look again at that record.
Voting with Ford
In the pamphlet, we noted that McCloskey voted
with the Ford administration r .iore often than Barry
Coldwater Jr. (64 per cent of the time).
At the debate, McCloskey said this is because
Coldwater was running for the U.S. Senate and
wasn't present as often. In fact, Coldwater had a
betterattendance record than McCloskey, both on
the floor (15 per cent to 18 per cent absent) and in
committee (36 to 56 per cent).
The pamphlet stated that McCloskey voted
against banning military aid to countries which
don't respect basic human rights. McCloskey
claims this bill would have also cut off economic
aid. The fact is that the Harkin amendment specifi
cally provides that if "the president determines that
such aid will directly benefit the needy people"

then the president may continue such aid. There
fore, not only is his argument false, but the intent,
as we described it, of banning military aid is clear.
The pamphlet further stated that McCloskey
voted against prohibiting the use of federal funds
for political assassination. McCloskey claims that
he voted against the amendment in question be
cause it would have banned the CIA from interven
ing in a covert fashion in the political process of
other nations in peace time. For example, he
claimed that the bill would prohibit the possibility
of the CIA financing opposition newspapers to the
Chilean junta. McCloskey's vote, and his dubious
defense of it, call his whole attitude toward the CIA
into even more critical question.
Against expedition
Another McCloskey vote in Aug. 1976 was
against expediting passage of a major congres
sional Day Care bill. He claims that he only voted to
follow the house rule (which is commonly waived)
that requ ires a bill be left on the floor for three days
after committee approval.
The fact is, there was a recess scheduled within
those three days. If McCloskey's position had won.
then the bill couldn't have been considered until
after Congress had reconvened. The result would
have been the closure of many day care centers
since their funding would have expired. Fortu
nately, despite McCloskey's vote, the house rules
were waived, the bill came to the floor, and the day
care centers were funded.
Of course, any vigorously pursued campaign is
going to make some errors, and this campaign is no
exception. After re-researching his stands, we dis
covered that two of McCloskey's complaints were
warranted.

Coldwater was running for the U.S. Senate and
wasn't present as often. In fact, Coldwater had a
betterattendance record than McCloskey, both on
the floor (15 per cent to 18 per cent absent) and in
committee (36 to 56 per cent).
The pamphlet stated that McCloskey voted
against banning military aid to countries which
don't respect basic human rights. McCloskey
claims this bill would have also cut off economic
aid. The fact is that the Harkin amendment specifi
cally provides that if "the president determines that
such aid will directly benefit the needy people"

then the president may continue such aid. There
fore, not only is his argument false, but the intent,
as we described it, of banning military aid is clear.
The pamphlet further stated that McCloskey
voted against prohibiting the use of federal funds
for political assassination. McCloskey claims that
he voted against the amendment in question be
cause it would have banned the CIA from interven
ing in a covert fashion in the political process of
other nations in peace time. For example, he
claimed that the bill would prohibit the possibility
of the CIA financing opposition newspapers to the
Chilean junta. McCloskey's vote, and his dubious
defense of it, call his whole attitude toward the CIA
into even more critical question.
Against expedition
Another McCloskey vote in Aug. 1976 was
against expediting passage of a major congres
sional Day Care bill. He claims that he only voted to
follow the house rule (which is commonly waived)
that requ ires a bill be left on the floor for three days
after committee approval.
The fact is, there was a recess scheduled within
those three days. If McCloskey's position had won.
then the bill couldn't have been considered until
after Congress had reconvened. The result would
have been the closure of many day care centers
since their funding would have expired. Fortu
nately, despite McCloskey's vote, the house rules
were waived, the bill came to the floor, and the day
care centers were funded.
Of course, any vigorously pursued campaign is
going to make some errors, and this campaign is no
exception. After re-researching his stands, we dis
covered that two of McCloskey's complaints were
warranted.
First, his record concerning the elderly is not
impressive, but the rating we cited by the National
Alliance of Senior Citizens is not a good reflection
of that record. Second, when the pamphlet was
printed, it had stated correctly that McCloskey had

lost the endorsement of theLeagueof Conservation
Voters. Only after intense lobbying, did the league
reverse their position (on the eve of the debate
here). We have gladly corrected our references to
these matters, and have reissued a corrected second
edition of the pamphlet.
'SDSer'
However, McGloskey's campaign has not been
free of inaccuracies. He has pictured me as an
"SDSer" and an anarchist. In fact, throughout the
1960s I never joined theSDS (Students for a Democ
ratic Society), but steadfastly represented nonvio
lence wherever I went. To the press, he has cast me
as a socialist and an opponent of the free enterprise
system, yet he has publicly acknowledged my
strong support for small business and competition.
He has said I favor the army's right to strike, yet
he has heard me say repeatedly that 1 do not. He has
characterized me as someone only pretending to be
a Democrat, despite the endorsements of Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) and Governor Jerry Brown to the
contrary.
In all the time I've spent trying to change the
course of national policy, no one has ever made
these kinds of accusations. Even those with whom I
deeply disagreed over the war in Vietnam recog
nized that I am a person of principle, integrity, and
honesty, who says what he means and backs it up
when the time comes.
I would like to thank the Stanford community for
your generous support and I trust this column has
helped to demonstrate that our pamphlet, Has Our
Maverick Become A Ford?, is in fact an accurate
description of McCloskey's record. Pick one up and
judge McCloskey for yourself. And when Nov. 2
comes, vote on the real policy differences between
McCloskey and myself. That's what this campaign
is about. Thank you.

During the closing minutes of the debate held on
Oct. 14 at the Stanford I .aw School between Rep.
Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) and myself,
McCloskey made a number of claims that I feel
require a personal response. Basically, he charged
that our pamphlet Has Our Maverick Become a
Ford? seriously distorted his voting record.
The pamphlet in question contains selected votes
that represent a side of McCloskey's record that is
unknown to most voters. Of course, any process of
vote selection will inevitably present an incom
plete picture. But selection per so is not distortion.
It is not my responsibility to present McCloskey's
view of his record —he must do that. Additional
problems in evaluating his voting record are inhe
rent in McCloskey's repeated practice of voting
both for and against a specific bill at various times
in its history.
Immediately after the debate I asked McCloskey
to forward to me his specific objections. Upon re
viewing them, and restudying his votes. I have con
cluded that our description of his record was fair
and in some ways an understated representation.
Let's look again at that record.
Voting with Ford
In the pamphlet, we noted that McCloskey voted
with the Ford administration r .iore often than Barry
Coldwater Jr. (64 per cent of the time).
At the debate, McCloskey said this is because
Coldwater was running for the U.S. Senate and
wasn't present as often. In fact, Coldwater had a
