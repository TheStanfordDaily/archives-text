# Letters: MacBride, Hurd fund

### 
Back Macßride
Voters in the 1976 Presidential elec
tion have a chance to make their votes
deliver a clear indication of their dis
content with the policy proposals of
Ford and Carter. They can and should
vote for Roger Macßride, on the ballot
in California as an independent and in
other states as the nominee of the
Libertarian Party.
While Ford and Carter compete to
have the most jingoistic posture to
ward Eastern Europe and compete
over ways to entangle the United
States more deeply in the Middle Fast
imbroglio, Macßride and the Liberta
rians propose a foreign policy of neut
rality and non-intervention.
While Ford and Carter compete over
ways to dilute, hamstring, or cut back
the rights of the accused recognized by
tin! Warren Court. Macßride speaks
out forcefully for civil liberties and
treating persons as innocent until
proven guilty.
In a sense, Macßride's candidacy is
an opportunity for sophisticated
members of the Jerry Brown consti
tuency to voice their views and protest
the fundamentally conservative offer
ings of the Democrats and Republi
cans. Even more strongly than Jerry
Brown, Macßride favors a society open
to alternative life styles and taking a
live and let live attitude toward drugs
and consenting sex.
Even more strongly than Jerry
Brown. Macßride is bringing us the
news that we have to lower our expec
tations about the possibility of the
government magically curing social
ills.
If you want to apply pressure to the
political system to extend the liberties
of Americans and to stay at peace with
the world, vote for Roger Macßride for
President.

Hurd fund
1 read with interest your article
about the Hurd fund and appreciate
your bringing it to the attention of the
residents of the houses in Cluster 111
and the fraternities. The fund was es
tablished to support creative and in
novative educational programs in
those residences, and as the article ac
curately points out, has been under
utilized i 11 recent years.
There have been no attempts to keep
the existence of the fund a secret;
rather every year it is announced to
fraternity presidents and senior house
associates with pleas to them to prop
ose programs on which the funds
could be spent.
Last year, the I lurd fund was used to
finance a series of three concerts at the
Alpha Sigma Phi house. It has also
been used to support a guest-in
residence at Whitman House, and
other similar events.
What distresses me about the article
is its tone. The implication that the
university has attempted to keep the
fund's existence secret, or has some
how tried to avoid spending it is un
founded. Unused money remains in
the fund, available for its intended
purpose.
I hope that students living in the
houses which can make use of the
I lurd fund will be stimulated to prop
ose; programs which can make use of
the monies. All such proposals should
be submitted, well in advance of the
program's date, to the Row Office.

I voted for McCloskey in 1H74 be
cause he was considered a sure anti
war vote in Washington. Yet even dur
ing the final dark days, he strongly ad
vocated the continuation ol the war. In
doing so McCloskey disregarded the
express wishes ot a vast majority of his
constituency, I know my vote was be
traved.

In 1H74 I agreed with McCloskey on
the abortion and gay rights issues, but
now I cannot count on his support in a
decisive vote.
While McCloskey is proud of his re
cord on environmental and energy is
sues, I cannot be so enthusiastic. The
net effect of his environmental-energy
policy is to surround all nuclear power
plants, strip-mines, and oilfields with
tule elk preserves.
In supporting Ford, our maverick
representative defends the status quo
of the Republican party. At the same

time, he is running against what the
Republicans consider the root of all
evils, the Democratic Congress.
McCloskey admits that he wields only
marginal influence in Congress. Why
elect a Republican who admits he can
not influence a Democratic Congress?
I plan to elect, with your help, a rep
resentative who can constructively
contribute to the Democratic Congress:
David Harris.
