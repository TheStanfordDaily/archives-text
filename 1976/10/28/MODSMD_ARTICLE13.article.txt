I would like to comment on Steve
Barkan's article "Chilean Deaths ..."
As a Chilean student I cannot remain
silent any longer.
In the first place, to speak of Al
lende's government as "democratic" is
highly misleading, since the Parlia
ment, the Supreme Court and the Con
troller General found him guilty of
"purposely and repeatedly violating
the Constitution."
The few democratic features of his
government were retained not because
of the democratic desires of the
Marxist-Leninist government, but due
to the presence of the army and the
opposition that was an overwhelming
majority of the country. It is worth re
membering that the "battle" cheers of
the Marxist-Leninist mobs were: let's
close the Parliament, the Supreme
Court, and take the "momios" (opposi
tion people) to the "paredon" (to be
executed). So, the "coup" was not pre
cisely against democracy.
Second, it was not the army's fault
that Allende unlawfully sneaked arms
into the country to prepare the "red
army" (poder popular). The army just
defended itself against the attack of
armed guerrillas and defeated them. It

is stupid to think that the armed forces
would have permitted being killed by
the guerrillas.
The people killed in the first months
and thereafter were not law-abiding
and democratic citizens, but armed
violent guerrillas that loved the pro
letarian dictatorship and not democ
racy. Also, to claim that 30.000 people
were killed is a gross exaggeration
made with motives that 1 will not qual
ify here.
On Letelier's death: it is unjust to
blame our junta of the crime before
having the results of the investigation.
It is just as if 1 blame Barkan of Letelier's
death. To assume culpability without
hearing the accused's defense, nor the
results of the investigation, is a pretty
"fascist" way of judging events.
Finally, it is naive to believe that the
opposition movement to Allende
(around six million people) were paid
by the CIA to destabilize the govern
ment. If you divide $H million by six
million citizens, it implies that the op
position was set into motion receiving
little more than $1 per capita.
