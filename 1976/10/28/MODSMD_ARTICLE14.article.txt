# 'All I had to do was show them I am a viable candidate'
## 
### Mark Funk 
David Harris arrived early at
the Sunnyvale Chamber of
Commerce's "candidate's
hotseat." I it; had been campaigning
for the 12th district congressional
seat for 17 months and most of the
morning of Oct. 20, but he was
largely ignored when he walked
into the lobby of the Sunnyvale
Holiday Inn.
He had to introduce himself to
chamber officials.
This was not the case when his
opponent. Congressman Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., entered the lobby
about 15 minutes later. Friendly
calls ot "Hello, good to see you
I'ete," greeted the eight-year Re
publican incumbent, and a round of
flesh-pressing ensued.
Harris contented himself with
buttonholing individuals or small
groups and explaining his stands
on issues as varied as tax reform,
energy, the bureaucracy and
employment.
The plush Holiday Inn lobbv un
derscored the circumstances which
have made this part of Santa Clara
County so prosperous. And the
chamber reflected its industrial
demographics.
An old Army uniform hung for
posterity's sake in a showcase on
the far wall. On another was a paint
ing of the Spad biplane which Capt.
Eddie Rickenbacker flew during
"the war to end all wars" while a
stained glass window depicted a
dogfight over the skies of France.
Businessmen and women mil
led around the lobby. They spoke,
as business types will do, about
their professions. And that was not
a local dental practice or corner
grocery store.
Lockheed is a major employer in
Sunnyvale. Ceneral Electric has
built a large plant in the area which
houses, among other things, its
nuclear energy division, breeder
reactor operation and its command
and information systems organiza
tion. Westinghouse is there, too.
Contrary crowd
And they all had representatives
in the chamber.
If 1 larris. former Stanford student
body president. Vietnam war resis
ter, federal convict, author, self
proclaimed activist and Democratic
congressional candidate, had
searched the breadth and width of
Santa Clara County, he could not
have found a group less in tune
with his thoughts than the Sun
nyvale Chamber of Commerce.
Harris and McCloskey were gong
head to head for the umpteenth
time during this campaign before
the chamber. Harris had said before
the roast that he expected to win
few converts in this organization.
He understated his point.
The show was McCloskey's. but
Harris managed to mitigate the
congressman's statements by ad
vocating the rights of the small
businessman versus Washington.
D.C.. and criticizing the red tape of
federal bureaucracy-
Harris even had a word of praise
for the Hewlett-Packard Corp.
If David Packard, the company's
co-founder and former U.S. Secret
arv of Defense, had heard Harris
laud Hewlett-Packard for its deci
sion to switch to a four-day work
week instead of laying off employes
during the energy crisis, he might
have done a double take.
It was an indication of Harris'
growing political maturity. Con
trasted with his rhetoric of the late
'60s and early '70s, it marked a
pragmatic concession to the
realities of 12th district politics.
Reaction
Only once did the audience react
to any of the statements (which
happened to be one of McCloskey's)
during the 45 minute exchange.
Heaccused Harris of "advocating
cutting the defense budget bv $20

billion" at the expense of jobs and
the economy of Santa Clara County.
Eyebrows shot up and a murmur
rippled through the room. A Couple
of aerospace employes grabbed a
half-full decanter of wine and
finished it off on the spot.
As he left for his Mountain View
campaign headquarters. Harris
said, "Well, that ritual is over."
An aide, laughing, asked him
why he had not laid into the
chamber, denouncing tham and the
industrial-military complex.
"All I had to do was show them
that 1 am a viable candidate," Harris
replied.

position to Nixon earned him the
respect (and the support) of many
small "D" democrats.
As Harris noted, "Those are all
good things to be against. But I have
a record of being against those
things, too."
If Harris expects to take a seat on
Capitol Hill in January, he will have
to win back the support of many of
those Democrats.
Administration supporter
The key to that element, the Har
ris people feel, is McCloskey's vot
ing record during the past two or
three years. They have attempted to
portray him as a congressman

Ford administration.
"Pete McCloskey has a splotchy
voting record," said Church, who
until the primaries was Harris'
press aide. "He (McCloskey) has
some good votes and some bad
votes. It makes him very difficult to
run against." admitted Church.
Church, who first met Harris
when he made an anti-war speech
at the University of Michigan, said,
"When a bill comes up and there is
a procedural vote, like waiving the
three day rule, he might vote
against that."
"But when the bill reaches the
floor." Church added, "McCloskey

It is fair to say that he is not a propo
nent of subsidizing school
lunches."
At the debate, McCloskey said
one of the reasons he voted against
the amendment was because higher
income level students would also
be subsidized under the program.
"How do you separate them?"
Harris asked. "Give a financial test
to every kid getting in the lunch
line?" He said the vote only hurt the
poor.
"How do you put all McCloskey's
bad votes on a small piece of
paper?" Harris said.
Harris accused McCloskey of

nouncing an imminent visit by Car
ter printed up. But the visit fell
through.
"I wish 1 could have gotten more
money from them (the Democratic
party). "Harris added.
Hut he says his support of Carter
remains firm.
Columbae House's parlor room
has, for all intents and pur
poses. become the Stanford
field office for the Harris campaign.
Yard signs were stacked along the
far wall and a box or two of litera
ture occupied space in the corner.
There were balloons and bum
perstickers. buttons and a contribu
tions jar.
Harris, who drove up from San
Jose for dinner with Columbae's re
sidents, was among friends. Many
of his campus workers—Sherry
Sprague, Bill Tyndal and Chris
Gray—were on hand.
Only once, during a question and
answer period, did Harris say any
thing that stirred the 30 students
grouped around him. It was on the
sovereignity of Israel.
"The Arab nations are not com
mitted to the right of Israel to sur
vive," Harris said. "Selling arms to
both sides in the Middle East is a
policv I will not accept."
Someone asked him if he had not,
at one point in his life, called him
self a pacifist. "There was a time
when I thought I was a pacifist,"
Harris acknowledged. "But not
now."
"I have to consider everything
situation by situation," he added.
David Harris is committed to the
survival of Israel.
From Columbae. Harris drove
back to Sunnyvale for
his second head-to-head
confrontation of the day with
McCloskey. He had been on the
campaign trail since 9 a.m., when
he spoke to a group of high school
students.
It was not an unusual schedule
for Harris and in the waning days of
the campaign, his time would prob
ably become tighter.
There would also be more de
bates with McCloskey. In a year
when debates between political
candidates have been in vogue.
McCloskey and Harris have made
many more appearances before the
people of the 12th district than
other politicians might be expected
to make.
Strong organization
And Harris, particularly, has as
sembled an effective campaign or
ganization. Eschewing television
and the mass media, he has instead
relied on precinct walkers and can
vassers to spread information about
his candidacy.
In a sense, Harris' organization is
a throwback to an older age in pol
tics, before television largely cir
cumvented grassroots campaign
organizations.
The organization is strong and its
people are loyal to Harris. Should
Harris win on Nov. 2, he already has
the makings of a sound congres
sional staff with ties throughout the
district.
If Harris is unable to overcome
McCloskey's 12 per cent lead by
election day, one of two things will
happen.
The organization will probably
melt away if Harris does not make a
decision fairly quickly after the race
to run again. Harris is charismatic.
His followers are working for him,
not the Democratic party as such.
They would not. as an organization,
support another candidate.
If Harris announces his inten
tions to seek office again soon after
the election, he will probably have
an organization tested by this cam
paign at his disposal.
In any event. Harris has secured
his position on the 12th district
political scene for some time to
come.
