# Harris' uphill battle
## 
### 
Harris has done more than
show he is a viable candidate.
Launching a largely un
heralded campaign 17 months ago,
he has assembled a cohesive and
loyal political organization which
the Congressional Quarterly has
described as one of the most effec
tive teams challenging an incum
bent in the United States this elec
tion year.
Revitalizing a moribund Democ
ratic party in the 12th district—
where registered Democrats out
number Republicans three to
two—Harris has been endorsed by
U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston and Gov.
Jerry Brown.
Cranston had supported McClos
key in the Republican's previous
campaigns. Their relationship has
cooled considerably since the en
dorsement.
When U.S. Rep. Andrew Young
(D-Ga.), Jimmy Carter's top domes
tic adviser, was in East Palo Alto
last month, he said, "I don't know if
he (Carter) has long enough coat
tails to help candidates in close
elections here (in California). We
were hoping that maybe David Har
ris could help us out down here."
And that may very well be the
case. It is Harris people doing the
precinct walking and conducting
voter registration and get-out-the
vote drives in the 12th district.
"We arethe Democratic organiza
tion," said Dennis Church, Harris'
campaign manager.
Uphill fight
In spite of his impressive ac
complishments. Harris, by his own
admission, still trails McCloskey by
as much as 12 per cent.
"I don't expect to pick up many
votes in Atherton." Harris has told
gatherings at Stanford.
But the 12th district is essentially
a middle to upper middle class con
stituency. While Stanford provides
a liberal bastion in north Santa
Clara County, the rest of the district
has a conservative streak.
Richard Nixon won the 12th in
1072. Jerry Brown carried it by less
than 1 100 votes when he ran for
governor in 1974.
McCloskey, meanwhile, has dis
posed of Democratic opponents
with relative ease. His toughest
challenges have come in the prim
ary elections against conservative
Republicans.
During 1974. only a move by
Stanford students and faculty to re
gister Republican saved McCloskey
from a primary defeat at the hands
of conservative businessman Cor
don knapp. (The knapp threat,
however, has since been lifted from
McCloskey's head—knapp was ap
pointed to a federal position by
President Gerald Ford.)
In fact, McCloskey, at least until
now, has been more popular with
certain elements of the Democratic
party than he has been with his
own. The ex-Marine's criticism of
the Vietnam war and his early op

closely aligned with the policies of
the Ford administration and a foe of
many pieces of domestic social
legislation.
Harris has carried this n'essage
wherever he has spoken.
ust two weeks before the Nov.
2 general election and count
ing down, David Harris' cam
paign headquarters in Mountain
View was in an uproar.
Volunteers scurried everywhere
and telephones rang incessantly.
The clatter of typewriters could be
heard coming from the second floor
while Frisbee, finance manager
Greg Movsesyan's mongrel dog,
nipped at his master's heels.
Campaign signs, flyers and boxes
of buttons occupied nearly every
corner.
In 17 months the campaign has
grown from four hardcore workers
to 30 full time staffers. "But that
depends on what you call full
time," said Denny Sargent, who has
been with Harris since the cam
paign's inception, "Forty hours or
80 hours a week."
"We have the most extensive
campaign oraganization in the
area," Harris said. "We have the
people that are out working the pre
cincts."
Finances
But precinct walking alone will not
overcome McCloskey's 12 per cent
lead. Financially, Movsesyan said
the Harris organization would
spend about $75,000 on the general
election campaign. He added that
this was more than the average sum
spent for most congressional races.
At an Oct. 16, benefit concert for
Harris featuring Stephen Stills,
Movsesyan said the campaign
realized "about $12,000." An art
auction Oct. 19. brought in another
$2500.
A $25-a-couple cocktail party
with actress-singer Ronnee Blakely
of Nashville fame was also on
schedule.
"You have to have money to raise
money," Harris said and pointed
out that much of his treasury has
been raised through direct mail.
"The money spent on direct mail
campaigns is not working capital
per se."
But the campaign has raised
enough to put some of the top
workers on salary.
It has also brought in enough
money for television spots, but Har
ris has decided not to go with a
media blitz during the waning days
of the race. Instead, he will rely on
volunteers and his solid organiza
tional structure to get his message
to the voters.
Working out of field offices in
Sunnyvale and Palo Alto and the
central campaign headquarters in
Mountain View, the volunteers,
mostly from local colleges and high
schools, will carry literature the
Harris people hope can link
McCloskey's votinu record to the

might turn around and vote in favor
of the bill."
"He might vote several times on
one bill," Church added. "You can't
break McCloskey's record down
intoa simplistic statement. It makes
it easy for him to hide in his re
cord."
During their debate at Stanford,
McCloskey charged that a
number of points printed in a
Harris pamphlet entitled "You Be
The Judge" either distorted his
congressional voting record or were
incorrect
Six days later, Harris was still
upset by the charges. His staff had
gone over McCloskey's specific al
legations and he was now more
convinced than ever that the pam
phlet was not a misrepresentation
of the congressman's record.
"McCloskey said that we dis
torted his position," Harris said on
the way to a rally in San Jose. Dur
ing the Stanford debate. McCloskey
took exception to a point in the leaf
let that said in 1975 he voted with
President Gerald Ford more times
than conservative Rep. Barry
Coldwater Jr. (R-Orange County).
McCloskey said that he only
voted with Ford one more time than
Coldwater (55 votes by McCloskey.
54 for Coldwater) and besides.
Coldwater had been absent from the
House more times than he had. He
also said he voted against Ford
more times than Coldwater.
"He maligned Barry Gold water
Jr.," Harris said. "We found that in
1975 he was absent more times than
Coldwater. Our point remains a
good one."
One problem that Harris had in
the Oct. 15 debate here was that
McCloskey put him on the defen
sive. Harris offered no counter at
tack.
"I came to that expecting to de
bate government reform (the de
bate's selected topic)." Harris s.iid
"I didn't have the materials read\
for an immediate response (to
charges of misrepresenting
McCloskey).
"I felt guilty that we might have
distorted his record." he added.
"We went so far as to solicit what
points he felt he was misrep
resented on."
Harris stands corrected
Harris admitted the rating given
McCloskey by the National Al
liance of Senior Citizens was not a
good reflection of the Republican's
record. He also acknowledged that
the League of Conservation Voters
had endorsed McCloskey—the
pamphlet said the organization
made no endorsement.
Harris said, however, that en
dorsement came on the day of the
debate and only after intense lobby
ing by McCloskey to change a pre
vious "no endorsement" decision.
He claimed that McCloskey's
vote on an amendment to the school
lunch program legislation was "a
partisan Republican political move.

doing some distorting of his own.
"He keeps saying that 1 advocate
giving the military the right to
out on strike," he said. "He knows 1
don't. We've gone over this."
'60s rhetoric
During the last month of the elec
tion, McCloskey has stepped up his
attempts to link Harris with his
rhetoric of the '60s.
During the Sunnyvale Chamber
of Commerce's "candidate's hot
seat," McCloskey said Harris' sup
port of the right for public employes
to strike was an indication that
some of his views on anarchism
nurtured during the '60s still held
sway.
"He has called me an ex-SDSer
(Students for a Democratic Society)
wearing a three-piece suit." Harris
said. "I've never belonged to the
SDS in my whole goddamned life."
According to people who were
observers to the campus situation of
the '60s. Harris did not associate
with the SDS.
"Why doesn't he (McCloskey) de
fend his record instead of scream
ing distortion?" Harris said. "Every
bleeping campaign he's run in he
has said someone was distorting his
record."
"That's what he did to Jim
Stewart (McCloskey's Democratic
opponent) in 1972," Harris said,
en. Walter Mondale of Min-
Snesota, Democratic vice
presidential candidate,
waved to a cheering crowd of parti
san supporters at San lose city hall.
He had just flown in from Los
Angeles for the afternoon rally. Be
fore he retired for the night he
would hop up the coast, stopping in
Portland and Seattle.
Local Democrats were putting on
a good, old fashioned stump rally.
There were banners, bands and a
good time was had by all. Mondale
delivered a ringing denunciation of
the Kord administration which stir
red the faithful to an emotional
froth.
IJp on the speakers' stand, a
number of prominent south bay
Democrats were clutched—
figuratively—to Mondale's coat
tails as the local and national media
recorded the spectacle. Don Ed
wards and Norm Minyta, two con
gressmen seeking re-election, were
there. So was Delores Huerte of the
United Farm Workers.
Mainstream Democrats
Harris was up there, too. But
when the band struck up 'Happy
Days are Here Again.'—the anthem
of the Democratic party —he did not
appear to clap with the enthusiasm
exhibited by the others.
Harris has attempted to draw
mainstream Democrats closer to his
campaign.
Harris said he wished that either
Carter or Mondale could have made
it into the 12th district before the
election, but that never panned out.
On at least one occasion, the Harris
people had proofs for a flyer an-
