# Assembly candidates quiet
## 
### Manuel J. Hernandez 
In a low-profile, low-budget
race for the 21st Assembly Dis
trict seat, incumbent Victor
Calvo and Republican Sandy
Sanger are attempting to sway
voters by focusing on transporta
tion issues.
With Sanger, president of a
taxicab company, spending less
than $5000 and Calvo, who is
seeking his second term, spend
ing $12,000 to $15,000, the only
visible evidence of the campaign
are some Calvo billboards along
Highway 10 1 and El Camino
Real and Sanger signs atop
taxicabs and delivery cars.
The local Democratic and Re
publican Headquarters on K1
Camino have also been dis
seminating campaign literature
for their respective candidates.
Sanger, president of Cabs Un
limited in Mountain View which
he founded in 1957 and Falcon
Parcel Service, an interstate
motor carrier serving twenty
counties in northern California,
said in an interview with the
Palo Alto Times that he feels he
is qualified to serve in the As
sembly because he is an expert
on transportation, insurance and
the penal system.
Transportation gripes
He said he is irked at Calve
and other legislators who have
been critical of Congress for de
laying imposition of stricter fed
eral standards for automobiles.

Sanger added, "The legislature
must be in synchronization with
technology."
Sanger said he wants to re
place Calvo in the Assembly be
cause he is "more qualified to sit
on the Joint Transportation
Committee."
However. Calvo pointed out
that there is no Joint Transporta
tion Committee, hut rather a
separate Senate Transportation
Committee and Assembly
T ra ns porta t ion Committee.
Calvo is vice-chairman of the lat
ter and said the two committees
have never met jointly.
Lobbyists
Sanger, who received his B.A.
in political science in 1957 from
Bucknell University, attri
butes his decision to run for the
Assembly to his experience in
dealing with the legislature as
president of the California
Taxicabs Association in 1971
and 1972. He said during that
time he witnessed the tremend
ous effect lobbyists have on the
legislature.
Yet, Sanger said he was also
upset about reports from a taxi
cab lobbyist who said that for the
taxicab industry to receive the
support of the legislature and
other interest groups, it had to
support legislation outside its
interests and give large cam
paign contributions to legis
lators.
Sanger faces heavy odds in a

district that is 5(5.1 per cent
Democrat and only 36.2 per cent
Republican.
Besides the university, the
21st Assembly District includes
Sunnyvale, Mountain View,
Palo Alto, East Palo Alto and a
small section of south Menlo
Park.
The state and county Republi
can machinery is not optimistic
about a Sanger victory. As a re
sult, they have given him little
money and attention, Sanger
claimed.
Although Sanger said he be
lieves that "most problems can
be solved through the tree enter
prise system rather than gov
ernment control," he considers
himself a maverick. "I'm not in
the (Republican) cliques" he
said.
In the Assembly
Meanwhile, Calvo, who has
been in local politics for 16 years
first as Mountain View planning
commissioner, city councilman
and mayor and was elected to the
Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors in 1968, disputes
Sanger's claim that he (Calvo) is
unqualified in the transporta
tion field.
"It's one of my interests. 1 have
served as chairman of the As
sembly Transportatin Commit
tee. I understand the problems of
transportation and the problems
of private carriers. I understand
the different modes of transpor

tation, and I understand the
transportation problems of this
county (Santa Clara) and San
Mateo County," Calvo said.
Prior to his election to the As
sembly in 1974, Calvo served as
the first chairman of the new
Santa Clara County transit dis
trict. Upon arriving in Sac
ramento as a freshman Assemb
lyman he was appointed vice
chairman of the Assembly
Transportation Committee by
Assembly Speaker Leo McCar
thy.
Calvo said he is too busy being
a legislator to become seriously
involved in the campaign
against Sanger. He said, how
ever, that he is running "on who
I am and my record."
Calvo said he believes he is
now "in a position to be more
effective in the next two years"
after having adjusted to working
on the state level.
Calvo is vice-chairman of the
Transportation Committee,
chairman of the Permanent Sub
committee on Air Quality, and
the Resources, Land Use and
Energy Committee and a
member of the Ways and Means
Committee.
One of his bills increased the
representation of Santa Clara
and Alameda Counties on the
board of the Bay Area Air Pollu
tion Control District. He was in
strument;?! in carrying the bill
known "the El Camino Plan"
which gave hospitals the author
ity to institute their own mal
practice insurance companies.
He also rewrote the Williamson
Act so that more open space
could be subsidized by the state
in urban counties.
