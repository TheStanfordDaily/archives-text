Why did (hey take the ivy off the Old Union a feiv
days ago? I kind of like the idea of enter in# the
ivy-covered halls of wisdom. -L.k.
It seems in this case practicality precludes
beauty. John Catania of Plant Services told me
they cut the ivy "in order to protect the building
itself," since ivy "causes structural damage when
it's allowed to progress that far."
Catania said the ivy was lifting those expensive
red tiles oft the roof, and was also pushing on the
drain pipe outside the building. "(The ivy) looks
great," he said, "but if it gets out of control it can
be very costly." Another tradition down the tubes,
I guess. . . .
On a more heartening note, Herb Kong, also of
Plant Services, says the ivy is a relatively fast
grower capable of climbing half-way up the walls
in one growing season, but from now on, "it's just
gonna grow on the arches," says Fong. And now
that the ivy is removed, Fong says the building
may get a new paint job.
Whot is the etymology of the computer term
"kludge?"
I called Terry YVinograd, assistant professor of
Linguistics and Computer Science, who promptly
whipped out his dictionary of slang computer
terms. This nifty little reference book was com
piled by a bunch of grad students and staffers in
the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
Anyway, getting back to the question, YVinog
rad said the term comes from the German word
"klute," meaning "clever."
He quoted this definition from the dictionary:
"1. a Rube Goldberg (cartoonist) device in
hardware of or software 2. a clever program
ming trick intended to solve a particularly nasty
case in an efficient if not clear manner, often used
to prepare bugs; often verges on being a cri crock
3. something that works for the wrong reason."
Got it?
What happened to the Friday Films'.'' I remember a
notice in the Daily about moving things from Mem
Aud -but ivhere? We checked Hi shop, Kresg eand
Cubberley last week ( also 25-30 others). Neither

Tresidder nor Public Events know. We wanted to
see "Return of the Tall Blond Man." -J.S.
The Friday Films are alive and well and being
shown in Cubberley, but I don't think those are the
ones you are referring to, since the "Return of the
Tall Blond Man" is not part of their series. But just
for future reference, they are sponsored by the
Stanford Film Society and are shown on Friday
nights at 7:;U) in Cubberley.
I think you must have seen an old schedule of
the Chaparral's series. They had originally
scheduled "The Tall Blond Man With One Black
Shoe" for Friday. Oct. 15. But with the reshuffling
of viewing sites, etc.. that film got canned.
If you can hang in there till next quarter, Pat
Hall of the Chappie, says there's a good possibility
they may be showing "The Return of the Tall
Blond Man" then.
I'm pissed. Every morning as I ride my bike
behind Mem Chu I am nearly run down by cars
cruising past the "Sendee Vehicles Only" sign an
Panama Street on their way to park in the inner
quad.
Since when are motorists allowed to turn the
inner quad into a drag-strip and or parking lot?
Curs may be found parked all around Mem Chu
and the Math Corner, in particular.
Hey bug -get the cars the hell out of the quad.
-C.R.
According to Police Chief Harrington, cars are
NOT permitted in that area â€” discounting, of
course, a few "legitimate" service vehicles.
Harrington said he wasn't sure how often that
part of the campus is patrolled, but he did say that
it is "part of a regular beat." Nevertheless, said
Harrington, "tickets don't move cars." Point well
made.
As for a solution, Harrington says they're con
sidering installing some kind of an arm-type gate
like the one on Serra Street. But that might turn
out to be more of a hassle than it's worth, since
service vehicles would have a tough time getting
through, too.
