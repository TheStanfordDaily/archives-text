### William Scott 
The economics faculty met in a spe
cial session to discuss student ac
tivities surrounding the Duncan Foley
tenure issue Tuesday, according to
I'rot. Bert Hickman, department
chairman.
He said tin; faculty discussed the
student petition demanding tenure for
Foley and the statement put out by the
Union for Radical Political Economics
(IJRPE) which charged economics
Prof. Mordecai kurz and a "handful of
senior faculty" with the sabotage of a
faculty search committee's recom
mendation to accord Foley tenure last
December.
Kurz called the report "untrue and
based on rumor." He said that he
would likt; the details of the December
meeting revealed, but that the faculty
had rejected his proposal.
Perusing petition
Hickman declined to comment on
thr I 'RI'F statement. but said he would
submit the student petition to the
economics faculty for their considera
tion.
IJRPE member. Sandy Thompson,
said he stood by the published state
ment and maintained that kurz has
demonstrated a "consistent pattern of
opposition to the program in political
economy."
He added that IJRPE was not in
terested in attacking individuals but
rather in pointing out the main issue,
discrimination against the Political
Economy Program.
The 11RPE statement charged that
the economics faculty has tried to iso
late the Political Economy faculty and
students from the rest of the depart
ment, and it cites the "dumping of
Foley as a major step in this direction."
It maintains that a minority of the
faculty opposed Foley's being recom
mended for tenure and that they were
able to make their view predominate.
kurz said, however, it was impossi
ble for a small group to manipulate
faculty opinion.
Matter of persuasion
Economics Prof. John Gurley said.
"It a small group of people present
persuasive arguments, it can have a
definite influence in a meeting." He
added That the faculty tends to look

unfavorably on student petitions, al
though petitions have sometimes
brought about changes.
Karen Johnson, assistant economics
professor, characterized the language
used in the IJRPE report as "unfortu
nate," but said she could "understand
the students' frustrations."
Economics students have been cir
culating a petition this week demand
ing that the economics faculty make a
definite tenure decision on Foley be
fore Dec. 1. Foley was offered a three
year contract renewal last year with
tenure to be decided within that
period.
The petition says"it is highly likely
that Professor Foley will accept a te
nured position at another university
this fall."
