# Decriminalization of marijuana advocated by national group
## 
### 
(CPS) — If NORML and its af
filiate members have anything to
say about it, pot smokers in at
least 12 states will no longer be
subject to arrest and jail sen
tences. They will merely be
given a citation fora fine if found
to be in possession of less than
an ounce of grass.
The National Organization for
the Reform of Marijuana Laws
(NORML), with headquarters in
Washington D.C., is working
toward changing the laws re
garding possession of
marijuana, through the system.
NORML is making available
funds and expert witnesses to
help lobbying efforts for 'de
criminalization' bill passage.
Pointing to the landmark
Alaskan case last year, which in
effect has made marijuana legal
there, Keith Stroup. a NORML
coordinator, spoke hopefully of
similar court decisions.

"The battle on the marijuana
issue is becoming more sophis
ticated," lie explained. "In eight
states, the smoker is no longer
subjected to arrest or jail, usually
receiving a citation. . . . But,"
Stroup stressed, "the person sel
ling small amounts are getting
years in jail. The courts are tak
ing a hard-pusher attitude to
wards them."
Stroup also pointed to the
findings of the National Institute
on Drug Abuse (NII)A), which,
after five years of intensive re
search on pot, have come up
with no specific, harmful data.
After spending $(> million on
this research, the director of the
project has publicly endorsed
the decriminalization of
marijuana.
One argument for the de
criminalization push is the relief
it would give in the amount of
tax money spent by law en-

forcement agencies chasing after
and prosecuting users and small
consumer sellers.
Stroup said there were
416,000 marijuana arrests in
1975, which accounted for 69.5
per cent of all drug-related ar
rests. The cost of sending all
those pot toters through the
criminal justice system totals
over $600 million."The police
are wasting money chasing after
smokers," says Stroup. "There
are less arrests for hard-drug
pushers."
Stroup is optomistic about get
ting the decriminalization legis
lation through Congress this up
coming session, especially if
Jimmy Carter is elected. Senator
Birch Bayh (D-Ind.) will intro
duce a bill that basically copies
the Oregon law. A bill by Senator
Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.) will provide
a clause stipulating no penalty
for minor offenses regarding pot.

"The battle on the marijuana
issue is becoming more sophis
ticated," lie explained. "In eight
states, the smoker is no longer
subjected to arrest or jail, usually
receiving a citation. . . . But,"
Stroup stressed, "the person sel
ling small amounts are getting
years in jail. The courts are tak
ing a hard-pusher attitude to
wards them."
Stroup also pointed to the
findings of the National Institute
on Drug Abuse (NII)A), which,
after five years of intensive re
search on pot, have come up
with no specific, harmful data.
After spending $(> million on
this research, the director of the
project has publicly endorsed
the decriminalization of
marijuana.
One argument for the de
criminalization push is the relief
it would give in the amount of
tax money spent by law en-

forcement agencies chasing after
and prosecuting users and small
consumer sellers.
Stroup said there were
416,000 marijuana arrests in
1975, which accounted for 69.5
per cent of all drug-related ar
rests. The cost of sending all
those pot toters through the
criminal justice system totals
over $600 million."The police
are wasting money chasing after
smokers," says Stroup. "There
are less arrests for hard-drug
pushers."
Stroup is optomistic about get
ting the decriminalization legis
lation through Congress this up
coming session, especially if
Jimmy Carter is elected. Senator
Birch Bayh (D-Ind.) will intro
duce a bill that basically copies
the Oregon law. A bill by Senator
Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.) will provide
a clause stipulating no penalty
for minor offenses regarding pot.
(CPS) — If NORML and its af
filiate members have anything to
say about it, pot smokers in at
least 12 states will no longer be
subject to arrest and jail sen
tences. They will merely be
given a citation fora fine if found
to be in possession of less than
an ounce of grass.
The National Organization for
the Reform of Marijuana Laws
(NORML), with headquarters in
Washington D.C., is working
toward changing the laws re
garding possession of
marijuana, through the system.
NORML is making available
funds and expert witnesses to
help lobbying efforts for 'de
criminalization' bill passage.
Pointing to the landmark
Alaskan case last year, which in
effect has made marijuana legal
there, Keith Stroup. a NORML
coordinator, spoke hopefully of
similar court decisions.
