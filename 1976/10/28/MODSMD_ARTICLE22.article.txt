Sacramento (AP) — Should Caliiornians. who
opted long ago against toll roads, start paying to
get on a freeway or even a city street?
How would the public react to toll roads?
The state's most publicized recent experiment
involving freeways was the Santa Monica Free
way Diamond Lane, a project banned by a court
order.
Now there's a local question in Berkeley
whether to charge tolls of $1 or $2 .1 day to use city
streets, with money going for shuttle buses.
"It makes the Diamond Lane sound like
peanuts," said Donald Burns, Gov. Edmund

Brown |r.'s business and transportation secret
ary. in an interview Tuesday.
Burns described the Berkeley proposal as
"amazing."
"It is being closely monitored by the Depart
ment of Transportation." he said.
Statewide, local governments may soon be
given the public's opinon on toll roads, from a
series of hearings set up by Burns' agency.
"1 think that's fine. I would have no problem"
with local tolls for local roads, but "1 feel pretty
sure we won't recommend any toll roads" using
major arteries "of statewide significance."
