# Watson and Fahey to appear
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
Three of the finest musicians
in the folk tradition today are
coming to Stanford. Doc and
Merle Watson and John Fahey
will be appearing at Memorial
Auditorium this coming Satur
day. Oct. 30, for two shows at
7 and 9:30 p.m.
Hoc Watson has not enjoyed
the notoriety that is usually ac
corded such a talented musician.
I le is probably the finest acoustic
guitar player around today. He
has amazing dexterity and
quickness on the fingerboard
which are necessarily the re
quirements for his unique'flat
picking style. Doc sings too,
with a mellow southern voice
that is easy to listen to. I lis music
includes traditional folk, blueg
rass, gospel, and some country.
11is son Merle is a fine slide and
finger-picking guitarist and also
an excellent banjoist.
John Fahey is not just an "also
appearing." He uses a finger
picking style on guitar but the
guitar take: on a new dimension
when in his hands. He has trans
posed everything from Epis
copal hymns to classical music
to the acoustic guitar. He also
has a wealth of traditional music
in his repertoire. Fahey hasn't
just been keeping this to himself
either. I le has already cut several
albums which are for the most
part just John Fahey, pure and
simple, on guitar. And that's all
that's necessary.
This ASSU sponsored event is
sure to be a highlight on this sea
son's special events calendar.
Advance tickets for Stanford
students are $4.00 at the Tresid
der Ticket Office. The price at
the door will be $4.50. Regular
advance tickets for $5.00 are also
available at Tresidder, all BASS
outlets, and all other major ticket
agencies. Regular admission at
the door will be $5.50.
