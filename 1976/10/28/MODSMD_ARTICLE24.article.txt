# 'Freaks' at Kresge...
## Everest ski flick at Cubberley 
### 
Saturday night in Cubberley
Auditorium will be the
Academy-Award winning 1975
documentary The Man Who
Skied Down Everest, the story of
the spectacular descent down
the Himalayan mountain by
Yuichiro Miura on May 6, 1970.
Outfitted with an oxygen
mask, a two-way radio, and a
special ski suit complete with a
parachute to slow his speed, at
one point Miura sped 660 feet in
two minutes and twenty sec
onds, documented by three
Cinemascope cameras.

The logistics of the two
pronged skiing and cinematic
project are staggering. It in
volved ultimately 850 people, 27
tons of equipment, including
meterological and medical re
search instruments, and cost $3
million. It chronicles the expedi
tion of technicians' and porters'
arrival in Katmandu, Nepal, on
February 25, 1970, their danger
ous and at one point fatal trek up
the mountain, and finally Miu
ra's historic run on May 6.
Canadian actor Douglas Rain
narrates from Miura's diary, and

in the words of critic John Si
mon. "if there were a prize for
the difficult art of narra
tion . . . the first one should go to
him." The background music
was performed by the Canadian
group Nexus. The film wiH be
shown at 6:30, 8:15 and 10.
In Kresge Auditorium will be
Tod Browning's 1932 film
Fretiks, a horror story that was
banned from exhibition for forty
years. It is the extreme conclu
sion of the "revenge" film, as a
group of circus freaks, inspired
by a unique camaraderie, pursue

a fortune-hunting trapeze artist
who has married one of their
own group.
Though completely tame by
today's standards, the final
chase through the rainstorm
ranks among horrordom's finest.
Freaks vill be shown at 7:30,
11:15 and 11.
And on Monday the French
Documentary Film Series begins
atB:ls p.m. in the French Theme
House with a bunch of shorts by
Marcel Marceau, Picasso,
Moliere and St. Exupery. This
series is free.
