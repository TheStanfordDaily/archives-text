# Music society shines

The Friday night concert of the Chamber Music
Society of Lincoln Center was an overwhelming
success. The level of musicianship in every piece
was so high as to make any one of them the climax
of any other concert. But for these artists, every
piece becomes a highlight.
The opening work on the program was a Mozart
Quartet for Oboe and Strings, k. 270. Oboe soloist
Leonard Arner demonstrated here emotional as
well as technical mastery of his instrument. After
one small rough place in the first movement for
each of three of the four players (a cracked oboe
note and muddy runs for Jaime Laredo on violin
and Leslie Parnas on cello), the playing smoothly
proceeded.
The interaction of the players was marvelous to
watch as well as to hear. They played so well
together that they seemed almost a single unit.
Arner's performance was exceptional for its sensi
tive phrasing and exquisite timbre. And he had
plenty of opportunity to display his technical skill
in the exceedingly difficult final rondo. True, an
apparent reed problem prevented his sounding
one high note and cracked the final note, but these
were only very minor flaws in a wonderful per
formance.
Violist Walter Trampler returned with pianist
Richard Coode for the second piece, Robert
Schumann's "Maerchenbilder." The performance
was so warm, so vital, that one could not help
enjoying it in entirety. Yet Trampler's vibrant
playing was still so precise that even each of the
thirty-second notes in the lively second move
ment was clearly defined.
Except for a couple of places in the second
movement where Coode briefly drowned out the
viola, his piano playing was very sensitive. The
finest movement of the piece was the last, in
which the two men together created a truly mov
ing experience by their expert control of the ebb
and flow of Romantic melancholy.
The high point of the evening of high points
was the Beethoven G-major String Trio. Opus 9.
no. 1. The performance was as close to perfect as
one might ever hear in live performance, marred
only by a slightly muddy run on Leslie Parnas's
cello at the beginning of the first Allegro.

The musicians were so well in tune with one
another that often one could hear overtones
shimmering above the notes that they played.
And Jaime Laredo's violin tone was exemplary for
its extraordinary singing quality.
The second movement, even better than the
first, was breathtaking to the very end. The Mo/.ar
tean Scherzo had a delicate bounce. And the final
Presto was so exciting that one's pulse raced even
after the players had finished.
The only work performed after intermission
was the Brahms Trio tor Horn, Violin, and Piano,
Opus 40. This performance was also memorable.
True, hornist Barry Tuckwell gave less than his
usual flawless performance, hut his "less than
best" is still far better that anyone else's "best."
Richard C.oode rendered beautifully a thankless
piano part that combines great difficulty with a
usually subordinate role.
The only word for Jaime Laredo's music
making is "brilliant." Friday night, the beginning
of the trio was faster in tempo than is customary,
but it was so convincingly played that one was
instantly drawn into its magic. Even the rubato
sections, never overstated, were perfectly to
gether.
Tuckwell's lovely timbre would have melted
butter. He did crack notes near the beginnings of
the second and third movements, hut his delicate
articulation elsewhere more than made up for it.
Another interpretive innovation was the short
pause before the violin's slow introduction to the
A-flat minor trio section. But again the change
was entirely convincing.
The third movement had a mysterious and
yearning quality, especially by contrast to the
rather boisterous end of the second movement.
The one portion which features, in decidedly dif
ferent form, the same motif that predominates in
the fourth movement was wonderfully expressive
of near-tearful Verzicht. The tremendously soft
yet clear playing of both violin and horn was
amazing. Yet buildups of emotional tension were
rapid in this deceptively slow movement.
The last movement was at once simply 01 ul
elegantly exuberant — a fitting finale for a
chamber music program of the finest quality.

Fine artistry
Stanford's Lively Arts sequence began with vitality and warmth as the Lincoln Center Chamber
Music Society demonstrated their talent last Friday night.
