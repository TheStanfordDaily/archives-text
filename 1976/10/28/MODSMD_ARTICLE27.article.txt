# Savoyards here with 'Pirates'
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Sharing a common apprecia
tion of the musicals of Gilbert
and Sullivan, the Stanford
Savoyards is an "informal"
group of "students, faculty, staff,
alumni, and friends of the uni
versity" Described by Rita
Taylor, producer for the group,
the Savoyards are "basically a lot
of people from <i 11 levels of Stan
ford life."
As the ASSU organization be
gins its fourth season, Taylor de
scribed the origins and purposes
of the campus musical company.
The Savoyards, named for the
Savoy Theater built by Richard
D'Ovly Carte for the original Gil
bert and Sullivan operettas,
started in the spring of 1973,
when a group from Cornell
found no Gilbert and Sullivan
organization on campus. An an
nouncement was placed in the
Daily, and the formation of the
Savoyards began. Listed as
SCIRE 113. the group received a
SCIRE grant of $000 to stage the
lirst performance, the Pirates of
Penzance,
Since that first performance,
the group has never had to ask
for money to fund the sub
sequent productions. Profits
from the last show are always
put back into the next show if
possible. Nobody working for
the Savoyards receives a salary,
but people involved with the
production do receive com
plimentary tickets. Responding
to the absence of a salary, "some
people stay and some don't." If
helping the group requires per
sonal expenditures, such as driv
ing on errands, the driver is
reimbursed to cover the cost of
the gas. but there is no profit.
Expenses
A typical budget for a
Savoyards project (in this case,
lolanthe) totals around $1970 in
expenses. To cut down on un
necessary expenses memos are
sent to all involved personnel to
remind then to stay within the
budget. Financially, the group
has "done very well."
In terms of the preparation for
■ m upcoming musical, much
I'ar-sighted planning must be
done. Taylor is already starting
on The Gondoliers which will
not be shown until April 29.
Taylor replied that she is looking
for a director, a musical director,
and other production people for
this operetta.
Casting for The Gondoliers
will begin at the end of January.
\ cast for such a production wi 11
spend an average of 12-15 days,
or about 60 hours in readying

their parts "by the time they get
to the show."
Stage and costume work is
done by volunteers such as Mrs.
Hamerton-kelley. the wife of
the Dean of the Chapel, and Mrs.
Richter, the wife of Stanford's
most recent Nobel Prize reci
pient. Bonnie Senko, wardrobe
mistress tor the Savoyards, in
volved as a student and even as
an alumni, still finds time to con
tribute significantly to the cos
tume preparations.
A lull orchestra accompanies
each showing, comprised of stu
dents from the Music depart
ment, whom Taylor described as
being very "capable of doing the
show." The ability of both the
orchestra and the cast are well
presented in the Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, which has good
acoustics. In staging, Taylor noted
that "you must be sure not to
have people singing across the
stage, but rather directly out to
the audience," a point rarely
noticed by the audience, yet
fundamental to the effectiveness
of the presentation.
Involvement
To illustrate just how wide
spread the involvement in the
Savoyards really is, President
Lyman played the part of a
haunting ancestor in Ruddigore
or the Witch's Curse. Also in
volved in that particular produc
tion were the Vice Provost Art
Bienenstock, Art Brycen of
Aero-Astro, John Breakwell
(professor of engineering), and
Ed Coode, a professor of religion
when not working with the mus
ical company. Another "name
performer" is Jim Siena, an assis
tant to the president, who has
been very active in the
Savoyards.
In the history of the produc
tion group, only one summer
performance has been attemp
ted. Patience. performed a year
ago. owes much of its success to
a pair of talented men who gam
bled on the success of an
operetta in the campus "off
season." Taylor described the pro
ject as a "cliffhanger," because
"you can't sell tickets in ad
vance" during the summer. With
ticket sales being unpredictable,
resulting from the spontaneity of
people's plans during vacation.
Patience required a lot of it.and
was a "producer's nightmare."
The campus Gilbert and Sulli
van organization receives help
from ifs San Francisco counter
part. the Lamplighters in the
form of advertisement and cos
tume rentals. Last year as a
Lamplighter production was

closing, ticket personnel told
customers that while the
Lamplighter shows were sold
out. good Clilbert and Sullivan
productions could be seen here.
This kind of advertisement,
without any request from the
Savoyards, is greatly ap
preciated and helps to spread the
interest in operettas throughout
the Bay Area.
Costumes
Some of the costumes are re
nted from the Lamplighters, be
cause the four week time span
between the start of school and
the first showing of The Pirates
of Penzance does not allow
enough time to prepare all of the
costumes.
The first Savoyards produc
tion of the '7fi-'77 season is The
Pirates of Pen/once, which
opens October 29.
The show tells of a young boy
who becomes apprenticed to pi
rates by his nursemaid, Ruth.
Reaching his 21st birthday, Fre
deric leaves the pirates and
meets the very beautiful wards of
Major-General Stanley. One of

these girls, Mabel, becomes quite
interested in Frederic, and he in
her. The other girls are seized by
the pirates and threatened with
immediate marriage.
The Major-General dissuades
the pirates, who is troubled by
the lie over the following days
and nights. Fate causes Frederic
to return to the pirates, who find
out about the Major-General's
deception. Seeking revenge, the
pirates attack the Major-General,
who receives protection from the
local constabulary. Upon the
end of the battle, Ruth gives an
explanation which clears up the
situation.
. The Pirates of Penzance is the
first show by Gilbert and Sulli
van to follow the success nil IMS
Pinafore, and displays the typi
cal wit and musical brilliance of
fered in the works of the British
team.

be obtained at Macv's Ticket Of

Sharing a common apprecia
tion of the musicals of Gilbert
and Sullivan, the Stanford
Savoyards is an "informal"
group of "students, faculty, staff,
alumni, and friends of the uni
versity" Described by Rita
Taylor, producer for the group,
the Savoyards are "basically a lot
of people from <i 11 levels of Stan
ford life."
As the ASSU organization be
gins its fourth season, Taylor de
scribed the origins and purposes
of the campus musical company.
The Savoyards, named for the
Savoy Theater built by Richard
D'Ovly Carte for the original Gil
bert and Sullivan operettas,
started in the spring of 1973,
when a group from Cornell
found no Gilbert and Sullivan
organization on campus. An an
nouncement was placed in the
Daily, and the formation of the
Savoyards began. Listed as
SCIRE 113. the group received a
SCIRE grant of $000 to stage the
lirst performance, the Pirates of
Penzance,
Since that first performance,
the group has never had to ask
for money to fund the sub
sequent productions. Profits
from the last show are always
put back into the next show if
possible. Nobody working for
the Savoyards receives a salary,
but people involved with the
production do receive com
plimentary tickets. Responding
to the absence of a salary, "some
people stay and some don't." If
helping the group requires per
sonal expenditures, such as driv
ing on errands, the driver is
reimbursed to cover the cost of
the gas. but there is no profit.
Expenses
A typical budget for a
Savoyards project (in this case,
lolanthe) totals around $1970 in
expenses. To cut down on un
necessary expenses memos are
sent to all involved personnel to
remind then to stay within the
budget. Financially, the group
has "done very well."
In terms of the preparation for
■ m upcoming musical, much
I'ar-sighted planning must be
done. Taylor is already starting
on The Gondoliers which will
not be shown until April 29.
Taylor replied that she is looking
for a director, a musical director,
and other production people for
this operetta.
Casting for The Gondoliers
will begin at the end of January.
\ cast for such a production wi 11
spend an average of 12-15 days,
or about 60 hours in readying

their parts "by the time they get
to the show."
Stage and costume work is
done by volunteers such as Mrs.
Hamerton-kelley. the wife of
the Dean of the Chapel, and Mrs.
Richter, the wife of Stanford's
most recent Nobel Prize reci
pient. Bonnie Senko, wardrobe
mistress tor the Savoyards, in
volved as a student and even as
an alumni, still finds time to con
tribute significantly to the cos
tume preparations.
A lull orchestra accompanies
each showing, comprised of stu
dents from the Music depart
ment, whom Taylor described as
being very "capable of doing the
show." The ability of both the
orchestra and the cast are well
presented in the Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, which has good
acoustics. In staging, Taylor noted
that "you must be sure not to
have people singing across the
stage, but rather directly out to
the audience," a point rarely
noticed by the audience, yet
fundamental to the effectiveness
of the presentation.
Involvement
To illustrate just how wide
spread the involvement in the
Savoyards really is, President
Lyman played the part of a
haunting ancestor in Ruddigore
or the Witch's Curse. Also in
volved in that particular produc
tion were the Vice Provost Art
Bienenstock, Art Brycen of
Aero-Astro, John Breakwell
(professor of engineering), and
Ed Coode, a professor of religion
when not working with the mus
ical company. Another "name
performer" is Jim Siena, an assis
tant to the president, who has
been very active in the
Savoyards.
In the history of the produc
tion group, only one summer
performance has been attemp
ted. Patience. performed a year
ago. owes much of its success to
a pair of talented men who gam
bled on the success of an
operetta in the campus "off
season." Taylor described the pro
ject as a "cliffhanger," because
"you can't sell tickets in ad
vance" during the summer. With
ticket sales being unpredictable,
resulting from the spontaneity of
people's plans during vacation.
Patience required a lot of it.and
was a "producer's nightmare."
The campus Gilbert and Sulli
van organization receives help
from ifs San Francisco counter
part. the Lamplighters in the
form of advertisement and cos
tume rentals. Last year as a
Lamplighter production was

closing, ticket personnel told
customers that while the
Lamplighter shows were sold
out. good Clilbert and Sullivan
productions could be seen here.
This kind of advertisement,
without any request from the
Savoyards, is greatly ap
preciated and helps to spread the
interest in operettas throughout
the Bay Area.
Costumes
Some of the costumes are re
nted from the Lamplighters, be
cause the four week time span
between the start of school and
the first showing of The Pirates
of Penzance does not allow
enough time to prepare all of the
costumes.
The first Savoyards produc
tion of the '7fi-'77 season is The
Pirates of Pen/once, which
opens October 29.
The show tells of a young boy
who becomes apprenticed to pi
rates by his nursemaid, Ruth.
Reaching his 21st birthday, Fre
deric leaves the pirates and
meets the very beautiful wards of
Major-General Stanley. One of

these girls, Mabel, becomes quite
interested in Frederic, and he in
her. The other girls are seized by
the pirates and threatened with
immediate marriage.
The Major-General dissuades
the pirates, who is troubled by
the lie over the following days
and nights. Fate causes Frederic
to return to the pirates, who find
out about the Major-General's
deception. Seeking revenge, the
pirates attack the Major-General,
who receives protection from the
local constabulary. Upon the
end of the battle, Ruth gives an
explanation which clears up the
situation.
. The Pirates of Penzance is the
first show by Gilbert and Sulli
van to follow the success nil IMS
Pinafore, and displays the typi
cal wit and musical brilliance of
fered in the works of the British
team.

Sharing a common apprecia
tion of the musicals of Gilbert
and Sullivan, the Stanford
Savoyards is an "informal"
group of "students, faculty, staff,
alumni, and friends of the uni
versity" Described by Rita
Taylor, producer for the group,
the Savoyards are "basically a lot
of people from <i 11 levels of Stan
ford life."
As the ASSU organization be
gins its fourth season, Taylor de
scribed the origins and purposes
of the campus musical company.
The Savoyards, named for the
Savoy Theater built by Richard
D'Ovly Carte for the original Gil
bert and Sullivan operettas,
started in the spring of 1973,
when a group from Cornell
found no Gilbert and Sullivan
organization on campus. An an
nouncement was placed in the
Daily, and the formation of the
Savoyards began. Listed as
SCIRE 113. the group received a
SCIRE grant of $000 to stage the
lirst performance, the Pirates of
Penzance,
Since that first performance,
the group has never had to ask
for money to fund the sub
sequent productions. Profits
from the last show are always
put back into the next show if
possible. Nobody working for
the Savoyards receives a salary,
but people involved with the
production do receive com
plimentary tickets. Responding
to the absence of a salary, "some
people stay and some don't." If
helping the group requires per
sonal expenditures, such as driv
ing on errands, the driver is
reimbursed to cover the cost of
the gas. but there is no profit.
Expenses
A typical budget for a
Savoyards project (in this case,
lolanthe) totals around $1970 in
expenses. To cut down on un
necessary expenses memos are
sent to all involved personnel to
remind then to stay within the
budget. Financially, the group
has "done very well."
In terms of the preparation for
■ m upcoming musical, much
I'ar-sighted planning must be
done. Taylor is already starting
on The Gondoliers which will
not be shown until April 29.
Taylor replied that she is looking
for a director, a musical director,
and other production people for
this operetta.
Casting for The Gondoliers
will begin at the end of January.
\ cast for such a production wi 11
spend an average of 12-15 days,
or about 60 hours in readying

their parts "by the time they get
to the show."
Stage and costume work is
done by volunteers such as Mrs.
Hamerton-kelley. the wife of
the Dean of the Chapel, and Mrs.
Richter, the wife of Stanford's
most recent Nobel Prize reci
pient. Bonnie Senko, wardrobe
mistress tor the Savoyards, in
volved as a student and even as
an alumni, still finds time to con
tribute significantly to the cos
tume preparations.
A lull orchestra accompanies
each showing, comprised of stu
dents from the Music depart
ment, whom Taylor described as
being very "capable of doing the
show." The ability of both the
orchestra and the cast are well
presented in the Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, which has good
acoustics. In staging, Taylor noted
that "you must be sure not to
have people singing across the
stage, but rather directly out to
the audience," a point rarely
noticed by the audience, yet
fundamental to the effectiveness
of the presentation.
Involvement
To illustrate just how wide
spread the involvement in the
Savoyards really is, President
Lyman played the part of a
haunting ancestor in Ruddigore
or the Witch's Curse. Also in
volved in that particular produc
tion were the Vice Provost Art
Bienenstock, Art Brycen of
Aero-Astro, John Breakwell
(professor of engineering), and
Ed Coode, a professor of religion
when not working with the mus
ical company. Another "name
performer" is Jim Siena, an assis
tant to the president, who has
been very active in the
Savoyards.
In the history of the produc
tion group, only one summer
performance has been attemp
ted. Patience. performed a year
ago. owes much of its success to
a pair of talented men who gam
bled on the success of an
operetta in the campus "off
season." Taylor described the pro
ject as a "cliffhanger," because
"you can't sell tickets in ad
vance" during the summer. With
ticket sales being unpredictable,
resulting from the spontaneity of
people's plans during vacation.
Patience required a lot of it.and
was a "producer's nightmare."
The campus Gilbert and Sulli
van organization receives help
from ifs San Francisco counter
part. the Lamplighters in the
form of advertisement and cos
tume rentals. Last year as a
Lamplighter production was

closing, ticket personnel told
customers that while the
Lamplighter shows were sold
out. good Clilbert and Sullivan
productions could be seen here.
This kind of advertisement,
without any request from the
Savoyards, is greatly ap
preciated and helps to spread the
interest in operettas throughout
the Bay Area.
Costumes
Some of the costumes are re
nted from the Lamplighters, be
cause the four week time span
between the start of school and
the first showing of The Pirates
of Penzance does not allow
enough time to prepare all of the
costumes.
The first Savoyards produc
tion of the '7fi-'77 season is The
Pirates of Pen/once, which
opens October 29.
The show tells of a young boy
who becomes apprenticed to pi
rates by his nursemaid, Ruth.
Reaching his 21st birthday, Fre
deric leaves the pirates and
meets the very beautiful wards of
Major-General Stanley. One of

these girls, Mabel, becomes quite
interested in Frederic, and he in
her. The other girls are seized by
the pirates and threatened with
immediate marriage.
The Major-General dissuades
the pirates, who is troubled by
the lie over the following days
and nights. Fate causes Frederic
to return to the pirates, who find
out about the Major-General's
deception. Seeking revenge, the
pirates attack the Major-General,
who receives protection from the
local constabulary. Upon the
end of the battle, Ruth gives an
explanation which clears up the
situation.

Sharing a common apprecia
tion of the musicals of Gilbert
and Sullivan, the Stanford
Savoyards is an "informal"
group of "students, faculty, staff,
alumni, and friends of the uni
versity" Described by Rita
Taylor, producer for the group,
the Savoyards are "basically a lot
of people from <i 11 levels of Stan
ford life."
As the ASSU organization be
gins its fourth season, Taylor de
scribed the origins and purposes
of the campus musical company.
The Savoyards, named for the
Savoy Theater built by Richard
D'Ovly Carte for the original Gil
bert and Sullivan operettas,
started in the spring of 1973,
when a group from Cornell
found no Gilbert and Sullivan
organization on campus. An an
nouncement was placed in the
Daily, and the formation of the
Savoyards began. Listed as
SCIRE 113. the group received a
SCIRE grant of $000 to stage the
lirst performance, the Pirates of
Penzance,
Since that first performance,
the group has never had to ask
for money to fund the sub
sequent productions. Profits
from the last show are always
put back into the next show if
possible. Nobody working for
the Savoyards receives a salary,
but people involved with the
production do receive com
plimentary tickets. Responding
to the absence of a salary, "some
people stay and some don't." If
helping the group requires per
sonal expenditures, such as driv
ing on errands, the driver is
reimbursed to cover the cost of
the gas. but there is no profit.
Expenses
A typical budget for a
Savoyards project (in this case,
lolanthe) totals around $1970 in
expenses. To cut down on un
necessary expenses memos are
sent to all involved personnel to
remind then to stay within the
budget. Financially, the group
has "done very well."
In terms of the preparation for
■ m upcoming musical, much
I'ar-sighted planning must be
done. Taylor is already starting
on The Gondoliers which will
not be shown until April 29.
Taylor replied that she is looking
for a director, a musical director,
and other production people for
this operetta.
Casting for The Gondoliers
will begin at the end of January.
\ cast for such a production wi 11
spend an average of 12-15 days,
or about 60 hours in readying

their parts "by the time they get
to the show."
Stage and costume work is
done by volunteers such as Mrs.
Hamerton-kelley. the wife of
the Dean of the Chapel, and Mrs.
Richter, the wife of Stanford's
most recent Nobel Prize reci
pient. Bonnie Senko, wardrobe
mistress tor the Savoyards, in
volved as a student and even as
an alumni, still finds time to con
tribute significantly to the cos
tume preparations.
A lull orchestra accompanies
each showing, comprised of stu
dents from the Music depart
ment, whom Taylor described as
being very "capable of doing the
show." The ability of both the
orchestra and the cast are well
presented in the Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, which has good
acoustics. In staging, Taylor noted
that "you must be sure not to
have people singing across the
stage, but rather directly out to
the audience," a point rarely
noticed by the audience, yet
fundamental to the effectiveness
of the presentation.
Involvement
To illustrate just how wide
spread the involvement in the
Savoyards really is, President
Lyman played the part of a
haunting ancestor in Ruddigore
or the Witch's Curse. Also in
volved in that particular produc
tion were the Vice Provost Art
Bienenstock, Art Brycen of
Aero-Astro, John Breakwell
(professor of engineering), and
Ed Coode, a professor of religion
when not working with the mus
ical company. Another "name
performer" is Jim Siena, an assis
tant to the president, who has
been very active in the
Savoyards.
In the history of the produc
tion group, only one summer
performance has been attemp
ted. Patience. performed a year
ago. owes much of its success to
a pair of talented men who gam
bled on the success of an
operetta in the campus "off
season." Taylor described the pro
ject as a "cliffhanger," because
"you can't sell tickets in ad
vance" during the summer. With
ticket sales being unpredictable,
resulting from the spontaneity of
people's plans during vacation.
Patience required a lot of it.and
was a "producer's nightmare."
The campus Gilbert and Sulli
van organization receives help
from ifs San Francisco counter
part. the Lamplighters in the
form of advertisement and cos
tume rentals. Last year as a
Lamplighter production was

closing, ticket personnel told
customers that while the
Lamplighter shows were sold
out. good Clilbert and Sullivan
productions could be seen here.
This kind of advertisement,
without any request from the
Savoyards, is greatly ap
preciated and helps to spread the
interest in operettas throughout
the Bay Area.
Costumes
Some of the costumes are re
nted from the Lamplighters, be
cause the four week time span
between the start of school and
the first showing of The Pirates
of Penzance does not allow
enough time to prepare all of the
costumes.
The first Savoyards produc
tion of the '7fi-'77 season is The
Pirates of Pen/once, which
opens October 29.
The show tells of a young boy
who becomes apprenticed to pi
rates by his nursemaid, Ruth.
Reaching his 21st birthday, Fre
deric leaves the pirates and
meets the very beautiful wards of
Major-General Stanley. One of

these girls, Mabel, becomes quite
interested in Frederic, and he in
her. The other girls are seized by
the pirates and threatened with
immediate marriage.
The Major-General dissuades
the pirates, who is troubled by
the lie over the following days
and nights. Fate causes Frederic
to return to the pirates, who find
out about the Major-General's
deception. Seeking revenge, the
pirates attack the Major-General,
who receives protection from the
local constabulary. Upon the
end of the battle, Ruth gives an
explanation which clears up the
situation.
. The Pirates of Penzance is the
first show by Gilbert and Sulli
van to follow the success nil IMS
Pinafore, and displays the typi
cal wit and musical brilliance of
fered in the works of the British
team.
Musical director
Featuring many of the
Savoyard regulars. The Pirates
of Pen/onee is the 11th produc
tion by the group. Included in
this performance is Dan Robin

son. as Major-General Stanley,
who was the musical director for
the Pirates production in 197:5 as
well as numerous additional
shows. Frederic is played by
Gerald Moshell, the musical di
rector for the summer produc
tion of Patience.
David Babbs and Lindi
Bauman. return from former
Savoyard productions to serve as

tor respectively. Peter Vilkin. as
