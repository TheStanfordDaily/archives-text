### 
Caught up in a mad dream of horses, Dr. Dysart (Daniel Davis, left), his obsessed patient
Alan (Harry Hamlin, center) and the god-horse Nugget (Michael Keys-Hall) bring Pete-
Shaffer's acclaimed drama "Equus" to one of its many shattering moments of truth. The
electrifying thriller, staged by William Ball for the American Conservatory Theater, returns to
the Geary repertory Nov. 2.
