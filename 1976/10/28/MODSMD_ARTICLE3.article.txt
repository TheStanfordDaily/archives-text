# Concern over lake

### Steve Schiller 
A proposal to close Searsville Lake
to recreational use has generated
"concern and some disappointment"
among local residents and organiza
tions, according to Andrew Doty, di
rector of Community Relations here.
Concerned community groups in
clude the Department of Parks and Re
creation of San Mateo County, a Hoy
Scout troop, the Searsville Committee
for Education and Recreation and the
I ,oma Prieta chapter of the Sierra Club.
A letter from Frederick Martin.
Sierra Club chapter chairperson, urged
the university to "delay final deci
sion" on the question until public
hearings had been held.
Calling Searsville a "truly unique
resource," Martin expressed confi
dence that a compromise could be
reached to benefit both the local com
munity and university research.
The Hoard of Trustees briefly dis
cussed the closing of Searsville Lake
for educational purposes at their Oct.
12 meeting and Doty said they are ex
pected to take up the discussion again
at their Nov. 9 meeting.
Edna Sott, chairperson of the
Searsville Committee for Education
and Recreation, has also called for a
compromise, recommendinu "non

commercial, regulated recreational
use on weekends, and educational use
during the week."
In a letter to the Hoard of Trustees,
she took issue with statements of Alan
Grundman, administrative director of
Jasper Ridge Preserve, which raised
questions about the safety of Searsville
Lake for public use.
Sott claimed that "many of Mr.
Grundman's statements and implica
tions were groundless fears."
The debate over disease hazards at
Searsville Lake depends on "how one
defines a health problem." according
to John Walker, chief of waste man
agement at the State Department of
Health.
In terms of diseases which may af
fect humans, Searsville contains "not
much of anything of any consequ
ence," said Walker.
According to Harry Dean, chief of
Planning and Development of the
Parks and Recreation Department of
San Mateo County, closure of the lake
"would be a disservice to the public."
Searsville Lake is the "only (fresh
water) facility of its kind in the
county," said Dean, who added that he
knew of no complaints about health
hazards at the lake.
