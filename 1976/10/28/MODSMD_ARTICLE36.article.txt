Tuttle. (i Reagan adviser, to ask whether Reagan
would be willing to campaign in Florida, Missis
sippi and Texas as well as California. All are states

to congressional and other state-level Republican
candidates.

Hayakawa outlines foreign tactics
Los Angeles — S.I. Hayakawa, the Republican
challenger in the California Senate race, said that
he would encourage rebellions in Soviet satellites.
"I would hope to encourage insurrections in
Hungary. Poland. Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia, or
Tibet for that matter. Those poor crushed nations.
We must not write them off and say, 'Toobad, we'll
say a prayer for you,' " Hayakawa said.
During the debate, he also said that if Africa
moves to the edge of bloodshed, "it may require our
own peacekeeping forces" to prevent that eventual
ity.
On his African proposal, Hayakawa said troops,
if sent, should take "neither one side nor the other."
He said military action should he taken only in
"situations under which a bloodbath could be pre
vented by use of troops.
"If the LI.N. is not performing its function, some
one must," said the 70-year-old renowned semanti
cist.
John Tunney, the Democratic candidate running
for his second six-year term, branded the Africa
comment as "ludicrous" and predicted it would
help him win Tuesday's election.
Blacks to meet S. African minister
Geneva, Switzerland — The Rhodesian drama
enters a new and maybe final phase today when
black nationalist leaders meet Prime Minister lan
Smith on an equal basis for the first time. They will
carry the assurance that white mastery is on its way
out in their homeland.

ment conference, Smith's white minority govern
ment betrayed no readiness to swiftly or easily
yield the control it has exercised for 11 years. The
basic black-white disagreement over the confer
ence's purpose remained unresolved.
British officials spread word ahead of the talks
that they consider a settlement possible. They
stressed that the public postures of the participants
did not necessarily reflect their less vehement pri
vate attitudes.
