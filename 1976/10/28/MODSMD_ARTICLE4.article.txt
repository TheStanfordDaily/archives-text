# USE approves 3 year contract

### Pan Demetrakakes 
Overcoming internal differences,
negotiators of the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union signed a
three-year contract with the university
yesterday thus killing some members'
attempts to put USE up to a decertifica
tion vote.
The contract had been approved by
USE's membership by a 17-vote mar
gin on Oct. 19.
Because of the signing, a petition for
a vote on USE's decertification will not
be accepted by the National Labor Re
lations Board (NLRB). The petition has
the required number of signatures, but
it has not been turned in to the NLRB,
according to Stanford Electronics
Laboratories worker Albert Armes, one
of the petitioner's circulators.
The NLRB cannot accept a decertifi
cation petition against a union which
has a valid contract with management.
The controversy of the addition of
former USE president Jim Berk to the
negotiating team, which interrupted
post-vote negotiations on the contract
last Thursday, was resolved when
Berk agreed not to attend the joint bar
gaining session Tuesday, even though
he still remained on the negotiating
team.
• Return to table
USE negotiators William Reynolds
and Damir Ibrisimovic, who had
walked out of the bargaining session
last week in protest of Berk's addition
to the team, returned to the bargaining
table Tuesday and signed the contract
yesterday along with Berk.
The post-vote negotiations were de
voted to minor language changes in
the contract, according to USE reporter
Glenda Jones. These changes will not
require another vote on the contract,
she said.
USE president Roger 1 lardy said that
although the contract "represents sub
stantial gains in non-economic areas,"
there is dissatisfaction among USE's
members about the pay increases.
The contract provides for a 7.5 per
cent increase in work pay this year, a
six per cent increase next year, and a
five per cent raise plus cost-of-living
increases in 1978. USE had asked for
raises of 14 percent this yearand seven
per cent next year.
'Underpaid'
"Stanford workers will continue to
be the most underpaid workers in the
Bay Area," Hardy said.
Other provisions of the contract in
clude:

—A "range classification" for next
year. One per cent of USE's total
payroll will go to workers who have
suffered loss of income through mis
classification in the past.
—A state-certified apprenticeship
program.
University employment will remain
under a "modified union shop" sys
tem, which means that new workers
who do not join USE will have to pay
the union the equivalent of member
ship dues.
