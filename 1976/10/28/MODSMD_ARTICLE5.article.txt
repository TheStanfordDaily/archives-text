# Voting blacks support Carter says poll
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
Almost 95 per cent of urban blacks
who now plan to vote for president say
they will support Jimmy Carter.
That figure is based on what is be
lieved to be the first person-to-person
poll of blacks taken by blacks in the
nation's 15 largest urban black areas
organized by Thorn Khue, assistant
professor of sociology here.
More than a third of those inter
viewed, however, said they definitely
did not intend to vote or were unde
cided about the candidates.
With five colleagues, Rhue inter
viewed 589 individuals, representa
tive of 7.H million urban blacks. When
asked, "For whom are you voting for
president?" 61.5 per cent said they
supported darter, 3.4 per cent sup
ported Ford and 34.6 percent said they
were either not voting or undecided.
In Rhue's findings, reported Friday,
30.7 percent of those interviewed said
that employment was the "most im
portant" political issue, followed by
education (25.1 per cent) and crime
(23.6 per cent).
Living conditions
Further findings by Rhue's survey
pertaining to the civil rights and living
conditions of urban blacks were re
leased yesterday.
Asked if conditions of life for black
Americans are "generally getting bet
ter, staying the same, or getting
worse," 64.5 per cent of those inter
viewed said that conditions are either
the same or getting worse.
"Most black Americans now do not
enjoy all of the benefits this country
offers." Rhue said. "Those who see
their condition as 'the same' have not
experienced any progress."
In the sample, 37 percent of the men
as compared to 31 per cent of the
women interviewed reported im
provement, a finding which may re
flect discrimination by sex as well as
by race.
Over 80 per cent of those surveyed

about government efforts to end dis
crimination considered current policy
"too weak" in the areas of unemploy
ment and housing.
A lower level of dissatisfaction with
anti-discrimination policy in educa
tion (68.9 per cent) was especially
marked in the South.
"Southerners have experienced tin?
most dramatic efforts at integrating
schools in the past two decades."

about government efforts to end dis
crimination considered current policy
"too weak" in the areas of unemploy
ment and housing.
A lower level of dissatisfaction with
anti-discrimination policy in educa
tion (68.9 per cent) was especially
marked in the South.
"Southerners have experienced tin?
most dramatic efforts at integrating
schools in the past two decades."
noted Rhue.
Almost 95 per cent of urban blacks
who now plan to vote for president say
they will support Jimmy Carter.
That figure is based on what is be
lieved to be the first person-to-person
poll of blacks taken by blacks in the
nation's 15 largest urban black areas
organized by Thorn Khue, assistant
professor of sociology here.
More than a third of those inter
viewed, however, said they definitely
did not intend to vote or were unde
cided about the candidates.
With five colleagues, Rhue inter
viewed 589 individuals, representa
tive of 7.H million urban blacks. When
asked, "For whom are you voting for
president?" 61.5 per cent said they
supported darter, 3.4 per cent sup
ported Ford and 34.6 percent said they
were either not voting or undecided.
In Rhue's findings, reported Friday,
30.7 percent of those interviewed said
that employment was the "most im
portant" political issue, followed by
education (25.1 per cent) and crime
(23.6 per cent).
Living conditions
Further findings by Rhue's survey
pertaining to the civil rights and living
conditions of urban blacks were re
leased yesterday.
Asked if conditions of life for black
Americans are "generally getting bet
ter, staying the same, or getting
worse," 64.5 per cent of those inter
viewed said that conditions are either
the same or getting worse.
"Most black Americans now do not
enjoy all of the benefits this country
offers." Rhue said. "Those who see
their condition as 'the same' have not
experienced any progress."
In the sample, 37 percent of the men
as compared to 31 per cent of the
women interviewed reported im
provement, a finding which may re
flect discrimination by sex as well as
by race.
Over 80 per cent of those surveyed

about government efforts to end dis
crimination considered current policy
"too weak" in the areas of unemploy
ment and housing.
A lower level of dissatisfaction with
anti-discrimination policy in educa
tion (68.9 per cent) was especially
marked in the South.
