# City wants university land
## 
### Lonnie Rosenwald 
The Menlo Park City Council has moved to purchase
a 367-ac.re parcel of university land, and may condemn
the parcel if the university continues to refuse to sel 1 it.
The land involved, located west of Interstate 280
between Sand Mill and Whiskey Mill Roads, would be
developed as a public golf course, according to plans
endorsed by the city Tuesday night.
Although the university has repeatedly indicated
that it is not interested in selling the land. Menlo Park
could condemn the acreage, a move which would force
the sale.
Andrew Doty, director of community relations here,
said the university will fight such action in court.
The university is prohibited from selling its land
under terms of the founding grant. In the past, unused
property has been leased for numerous uses.
However, in 1974, university administrators revised
the leasing policy to specify that "it will look upon its
land, not as a financial asset to be developed commer
cially for profit, but rather as an academic asset."
explained Doty.
The policy is intended to insure that lands could be
reacquired for future academic needs.
"Once a golf course is built." said Doty, "it becomes
very difficult to tell the people who are using it to

stop." He alluded to the current outcry at the universi
ty's efforts to limit public access to Searsville Lake.
It is "more of a political problem when land is used
by the public," he explained.
Land value appears to be an additional point of con
tention in the proposed purchase. According to Doty, a
Menlo Park committee studying the project valued the
land at $3700 per acre.
In contrast, for a potential land exchange with
Sequoia High School on adjacent acreage, the univer
sity set the land value at about $12,500 per acre.
"That's just an indication of the differences between
the parties involved," Doty said.
Menlo Park's plan cal Is for construction of an 18-hole
golf course with a pro shop and eating areas, as well as a
solar and wind energy station, hiking and horseback
trails, and tennis, handball, archery and lawn bowling
facilities.
A petition supporting the project drew 2000 signa
tures from people who said they would use the prop
osed development.
Initial construction cost, not including the purchase
of land, is estimated at $1.0 million. Menlo Park hopes
use fees would generate revenue of $141,000 annual ly.
The land in question is currently vacant, except for a
few cows who graze there. The cows belong to ranchers
who hold leases on university land.

from the university, the city council indicated it will
attempt to have the land condemned in order to
acquire the land. The university said it will go to
court to avoid giving up the land.
