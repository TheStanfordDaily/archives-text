# Right to abstain

Kevin O'Crady takes an unfortunate
(and unfortunately common)
narrow-minded and categorical ap
proach to the electoral process in the
I Jnited States when he states that those
who choose not to vote are attempting
to remain "politically chaste" (Daily,
Oct. 25.)
On the contrary. I, as one who has
opted to abstain in 1976, am mired in
the political process. All of us. as
Americans, are involved, whether we
like it or not, because t lie outputs of the
"political system" interact with our
daily lives in a multitude of ways.
My decision not to vote is a result of
long hours of discussion and argu
ment, to which many of my friends
will attest; as such, this decision is as
much a positive political act as a vote
for Carter or a vote for Ford. I am not
placing myself above the electoral sys
tem by an act of "intellectual conceit;"
rather. I am registering mv grievance
against tfiat system as an act of politi
cal conscience.
O'Crady's article sounds like just
another Carter-for-presidenf poster,
making 1 'aims about progress in given
areas, with absolutely nothing to sup
port them. O'Crady's only evidence is
a remark concerning the advisers with
whom Carter is likely to surround
himself.
Carter's staff
111 the area of foreign policy and de
fense. for example, this piece of "posi
tive" evidence is belied by the pre
sence 011 Carter's staff of Paul Warnke,
Xbigniew Brzezinski and Samuel Hun
tington. Two of these individuals
(Warnke and Brzezinski) are said to be
likely candidates for secretary of state
in a Carter administration, and Hun
tington will certainly be an informal
adviser, at least. The contrast between
Warnke, on the one hand, and
Brzezinski anil Huntington, on the
other, is striking. Warnke. who spoke
here on Oct. 15, takes an across-the
board "liberal" approach to foreign
policy, ranging from arms control
(anti-trident, anti-B-1) to relationships
with dictatorships (consistent policies
toward all repressive regimes, regard
hiss of political color, if any).
Brzezinski and I luntington, by con
trast, are known conservatives on most
foreign policy issues, and both, as ad
visers during this Johnson years, took
hardline stands on U.S. involvement
in Southeast Asia. Are these the advis
ers which thi! former chairman of the
Stanford-MeCovern campaign claims

will make .1 difference? When you vote
for Carter, do you know which advice
you are voting for and which foreign
policy tlit? U.S. will have?
Carter consistently refuses to name a
prospective cabinet prior to the elec
tion. which gives him the option, offer
election day. to implement a
Brzezinski-Huntington foreign policy
or a Warnke foreign policy or some
combination of the two. Is this Carter's
idea of getting the American people
involved in foreign policy decision
making? How can voting make a dif
ference when I do not know what 1 am
voting for?
O'Crady maintains that Ford's
policies art! no more tolerable than Ni
xon's simply because he is a "nice
guy" (whether correctly or not is not
the point here, although the assertion,
coming from a McCovernite, is sur
prising). Evidently "nice guy-ness."
for O'Crady. has no political salience.
Why then does O'Crady. only five
paragraphs later, assail Robert Dole as
unscrupulous and accuse him of being
a "mean little man"? Is that all of a
sudden politically significant?
Narrow perspective
O'Crady may think himself a
"progressive-type" within the narrow
confines of the American political
spectrum, but if he were to broaden his
perspective he might be surprised at
the conservative nature of his political
orientation.
What kind of electoral system is it
which gives us a choice between
Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford? What
kind of system is it that makes a profes
sion out of politics, where the goal is to
get elected, and not to take a stand or
dare to lead?
It is a system in which I choose to
participate by saying "no!" and by
joining with millions of other Ameri
cans, in ever-increasing numbers, in
registering my discontent. 1 am tired of
choosing between two "evils" and this
time I will make my voice heard louder
than ever before by the act of not vot
ing.
(So that this column wi 11 jiot, in any
way, be misconstrued as a pro-Ford
statement, let me just say that I find
Ford's administration and his politics
equally, if not more, impenetrable and
uninviting as Carter's. The anti-Carter
thrust of this letter was dictated chief ly
by the obvious pro-Carter nature of
O'Crady's article).

sence 011 Carter's staff of Paul Warnke,
Xbigniew Brzezinski and Samuel Hun
tington. Two of these individuals
(Warnke and Brzezinski) are said to be
likely candidates for secretary of state
in a Carter administration, and Hun
tington will certainly be an informal
adviser, at least. The contrast between
Warnke, on the one hand, and
Brzezinski anil Huntington, on the
other, is striking. Warnke. who spoke
here on Oct. 15, takes an across-the
board "liberal" approach to foreign
policy, ranging from arms control
(anti-trident, anti-B-1) to relationships
with dictatorships (consistent policies
toward all repressive regimes, regard
hiss of political color, if any).
Brzezinski and I luntington, by con
trast, are known conservatives on most
foreign policy issues, and both, as ad
visers during this Johnson years, took
hardline stands on U.S. involvement
in Southeast Asia. Are these the advis
ers which thi! former chairman of the
Stanford-MeCovern campaign claims

will make .1 difference? When you vote
for Carter, do you know which advice
you are voting for and which foreign
policy tlit? U.S. will have?
Carter consistently refuses to name a
prospective cabinet prior to the elec
tion. which gives him the option, offer
election day. to implement a
Brzezinski-Huntington foreign policy
or a Warnke foreign policy or some
combination of the two. Is this Carter's
idea of getting the American people
involved in foreign policy decision
making? How can voting make a dif
ference when I do not know what 1 am
voting for?
O'Crady maintains that Ford's
policies art! no more tolerable than Ni
xon's simply because he is a "nice
guy" (whether correctly or not is not
the point here, although the assertion,
coming from a McCovernite, is sur
prising). Evidently "nice guy-ness."
for O'Crady. has no political salience.
Why then does O'Crady. only five
paragraphs later, assail Robert Dole as
unscrupulous and accuse him of being
a "mean little man"? Is that all of a
sudden politically significant?
Narrow perspective
O'Crady may think himself a
"progressive-type" within the narrow
confines of the American political
spectrum, but if he were to broaden his
perspective he might be surprised at
the conservative nature of his political
orientation.
What kind of electoral system is it
which gives us a choice between
Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford? What
kind of system is it that makes a profes
sion out of politics, where the goal is to
get elected, and not to take a stand or
dare to lead?
It is a system in which I choose to
participate by saying "no!" and by
joining with millions of other Ameri
cans, in ever-increasing numbers, in
registering my discontent. 1 am tired of
choosing between two "evils" and this
time I will make my voice heard louder
than ever before by the act of not vot
ing.
(So that this column wi 11 jiot, in any
way, be misconstrued as a pro-Ford
statement, let me just say that I find
Ford's administration and his politics
equally, if not more, impenetrable and
uninviting as Carter's. The anti-Carter
thrust of this letter was dictated chief ly
by the obvious pro-Carter nature of
O'Crady's article).

Kevin O'Crady takes an unfortunate
(and unfortunately common)
narrow-minded and categorical ap
proach to the electoral process in the
I Jnited States when he states that those
who choose not to vote are attempting
to remain "politically chaste" (Daily,
Oct. 25.)
On the contrary. I, as one who has
opted to abstain in 1976, am mired in
the political process. All of us. as
Americans, are involved, whether we
like it or not, because t lie outputs of the
"political system" interact with our
daily lives in a multitude of ways.
My decision not to vote is a result of
long hours of discussion and argu
ment, to which many of my friends
will attest; as such, this decision is as
much a positive political act as a vote
for Carter or a vote for Ford. I am not
placing myself above the electoral sys

rather. I am registering mv grievance

involved in foreign policy decision
making? How can voting make a dif
ference when I do not know what 1 am
voting for?
O'Crady maintains that Ford's
policies art! no more tolerable than Ni
xon's simply because he is a "nice
guy" (whether correctly or not is not
the point here, although the assertion,
coming from a McCovernite, is sur
prising). Evidently "nice guy-ness."
for O'Crady. has no political salience.
Why then does O'Crady. only five
paragraphs later, assail Robert Dole as
unscrupulous and accuse him of being
a "mean little man"? Is that all of a
sudden politically significant?
Narrow perspective
O'Crady may think himself a
"progressive-type" within the narrow
confines of the American political
spectrum, but if he were to broaden his
perspective he might be surprised at
the conservative nature of his political
orientation.
What kind of electoral system is it
which gives us a choice between
Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford? What
kind of system is it that makes a profes
sion out of politics, where the goal is to
get elected, and not to take a stand or
dare to lead?
It is a system in which I choose to
participate by saying "no!" and by
joining with millions of other Ameri
cans, in ever-increasing numbers, in
registering my discontent. 1 am tired of
choosing between two "evils" and this
time I will make my voice heard louder
than ever before by the act of not vot
ing.
(So that this column wi 11 jiot, in any
way, be misconstrued as a pro-Ford
statement, let me just say that I find
Ford's administration and his politics
equally, if not more, impenetrable and
uninviting as Carter's. The anti-Carter
thrust of this letter was dictated chief ly
by the obvious pro-Carter nature of
O'Crady's article).

Kevin O'Crady takes an unfortunate
(and unfortunately common)
narrow-minded and categorical ap
proach to the electoral process in the
I Jnited States when he states that those
who choose not to vote are attempting
to remain "politically chaste" (Daily,
Oct. 25.)
On the contrary. I, as one who has
opted to abstain in 1976, am mired in
the political process. All of us. as
Americans, are involved, whether we
like it or not, because t lie outputs of the
"political system" interact with our
daily lives in a multitude of ways.
My decision not to vote is a result of
long hours of discussion and argu
ment, to which many of my friends
will attest; as such, this decision is as
much a positive political act as a vote
for Carter or a vote for Ford. I am not
placing myself above the electoral sys
tem by an act of "intellectual conceit;"
rather. I am registering mv grievance
against tfiat system as an act of politi
cal conscience.
O'Crady's article sounds like just
another Carter-for-presidenf poster,
making 1 'aims about progress in given
areas, with absolutely nothing to sup
port them. O'Crady's only evidence is
a remark concerning the advisers with
whom Carter is likely to surround
himself.
Carter's staff
111 the area of foreign policy and de
fense. for example, this piece of "posi
tive" evidence is belied by the pre
sence 011 Carter's staff of Paul Warnke,
Xbigniew Brzezinski and Samuel Hun
tington. Two of these individuals
(Warnke and Brzezinski) are said to be
likely candidates for secretary of state
in a Carter administration, and Hun
tington will certainly be an informal
adviser, at least. The contrast between
Warnke, on the one hand, and
Brzezinski anil Huntington, on the
other, is striking. Warnke. who spoke
here on Oct. 15, takes an across-the
board "liberal" approach to foreign
policy, ranging from arms control
(anti-trident, anti-B-1) to relationships
with dictatorships (consistent policies
toward all repressive regimes, regard
hiss of political color, if any).
Brzezinski and I luntington, by con
trast, are known conservatives on most
foreign policy issues, and both, as ad
visers during this Johnson years, took
hardline stands on U.S. involvement
in Southeast Asia. Are these the advis
ers which thi! former chairman of the
Stanford-MeCovern campaign claims

will make .1 difference? When you vote
for Carter, do you know which advice
you are voting for and which foreign
policy tlit? U.S. will have?
Carter consistently refuses to name a
prospective cabinet prior to the elec
tion. which gives him the option, offer
election day. to implement a
Brzezinski-Huntington foreign policy
or a Warnke foreign policy or some
combination of the two. Is this Carter's
idea of getting the American people
involved in foreign policy decision
making? How can voting make a dif
ference when I do not know what 1 am
voting for?
