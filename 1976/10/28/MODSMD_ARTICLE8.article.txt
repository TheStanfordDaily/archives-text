When the major party presidential
candidates have carried on a dialogue
with little genuine problem-solving in
it. a number of highly questionable as
sumptions about U.S. politics rise to
the surface. When we look deeper into
the American political scene, these as
sumptions become serious obstacles to
our achiev ing a more perfect democ
racy.
The 'two-party system was not or
dained by the founding fathers as the;
best form of government. In fact, great
opposition existed at the time to even
permitting any direct involvement by
political parties at all. limiting them to
purely social functions.
John Adams, George Washington,
and Thomas Jefferson all stated that
parties were a very small attempt at
covering a truly democratic process.
Washington went as far to say. in his
farewell Address (which was co
authored by Alexander Hamilton), that
.1 two-party system would actually un
dermine the original purposes of the
Revolution and the Constitution, put
ting power in tin; hands of a succession
of demagogues.

Independent presidential candidate
Cent! McCarthy is the latest of fine
popular leaders — such as Teddy
Roosevelt and Robert I.aFollette before
him — to suffer under the misconcep
tion that the two party system and the
U.S. government are synonymous.
In an election year that cries out for
creative solutions to the problems that
beset our way of life, we have heard
two candidates do little more than vil
ify each other. Meanwhile, McCarthy
has endured a virtual news blackout:
the television networks do not follow
him. the press does not investigate bis
ideas.
Is Ceorge Washington really so far
away? Gene McCarthy relies on the
original patriots' ideas, and on many
modern researchers seeking a way to
make Spaceship Earth survive intact.
I le is on the ballot as an independent
in every state, either listed or by write
in. as is the case here in California. I
hope that you vote for this thoughtful
and guileless man.
I Larry Borok is chairman of the So.
