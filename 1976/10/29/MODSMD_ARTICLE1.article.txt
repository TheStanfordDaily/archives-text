From the Associated Press
San Francisco â€” The California
Supreme Court yesterday confirmed
its decision to strike down special
minority admissions programs in Uni
versity of California professional
schools, refusing a UC petition to re
hear the case.
The action set the stage for a show
down in the U.S. Supreme court over
the volatile issue of so-called reverse
discrimination.
The court declined to grant a stay in
implementing its Sept. 16 decision in
Bakke vs. University of California that
minority admissions programs viol
ated equal protection rights guaran
teed under the 14th amendment.
Modifying its original opinion, the
court also ordered that Allan Bakke be
admitted to the medical school at the
LJC-Davis campus. Bakke had con
tended he had been denied admission
because he was white.
Only Justice Mathew Tobriner voted
in favor of rehearing the so-called re
verse discrimination case. Tobriner
also case the sole dissenting vote in the
original 6-1 opinion.
Special admissions using race as a
criterion are now prohibited on all
nine campuses of the state university
system as a result of the court's deci
sion, said Donald Reidharr, general
counsel for the UC Board of Regents.
The university plans to appeal the
case to the U.S. Supreme Court before
Dec. 15, Reidharr said.
In addition, UC will ask the U.S.
Supreme Court early next week to
issue a stay in implementing the deci
sion of the California court. In the
meantime, Reidharr said, UC cam
puses have been advised to take no
action applications for special admis
sions.
"Given the great public importance
of the case, and the fact that high
courts of other states have come to dif
ferent conclusions on the issue, the
decision should not go into effect until
the U.S. Supreme Court has had an
opportunity to rule on the issue,"
Reidharr said.
Bakke applied for admission to the
University ofCalifornia-Davis medical
school in 1973 and 1974 and was re
jected both years.
