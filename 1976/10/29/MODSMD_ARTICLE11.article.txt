# Bucks for babies: a modest proposal
## 
### 
According to the New York Times
Magazine of Aug. 17, 1975, a booming
business in black market babies is de
veloping in the United States. States
are dusting off old slavery statutes to
deal with the problem. This situation
has developed because the supply of
babies wanted for adoption is decreas
ing at a time when the demand for
them is increasing.
The Pill and abortion have elimi
nated many unwanted pregnancies
and unwed mothers are keeping their
offspring in greater numbers than be
fore. All of this comes at a time when
many couples are turning to adoption
because of the threat of overpopula
tion. Unfortunately, adoption of heal
thy white babies through conventional
agencies entails a three to seven year

wait, according to the Times. Couples,
unwilling to wait, are asking lawyers
to find women willing to give up their
children for adoption. The lawyers
command fees up to $25,000 for such a
transaction.
This is an ideal money-making op
portunity for Stanford students. Think
of the revenue-producing potential of
one Saturday night at the university.
The Farm's prime breeding stock
could charge outrageous prices for
their high quality offspring. The days
of debt and summer jobs could be
through forever.
This new plan, called "Bucks for
Babies," would be simple. A couple,
male and female, would sign an ag
reement with the Stanford "baby
broker." The couple would agree to

produce a baby for a set price, say
$25,000. The broker would locate a
buyer and collect a small commission.
All medical expenses would come out
of the commission. The couple would
split the profits. This would be called a
"50-50 proposition."
Only a few
Only a few pregnancies would be
needed to put a couple of students

through school. Certainly, ambitious
couples would exploit the system for
fun and profit far above that needed to
cover school expenses. Students could
have good times with all the extra
money.
Some loony airheads will attack the
plan with spurious charges that this is
"inhuman slavery." Bosh.
A group has even formed in opposi
tion, calling itself "The Infantry." Its
alarmist ravings are simply unfair and
not realistic. The girls would probably
go out and have abortions anyway, so
why not make some money out of the
deal? There might be a few bugs in the
plan, but that is typical of anything in
its embryonic stages.
New scenario
To demonstrate how ludicrous any
criticism is of this plan, let's show
what Stanford would be like if the in
novative "Bucks for Babies" scheme is
fully implemented. The scene: a male
Stanford student calling home. Let's
listen in.
Dad: (Ring) Hello?
Son: Hi Dad. This is your son.
Dad: Hey, good to hear from you.
How's school?
Son: Oh, it's going fine. Anything new
at home?
Dad: Yes, we finally got the swimming
pool installed in the backyard. It's a
real beauty.
Son: That's great. Now Jimmy will be
able to practice for the swim team.
Dad: That's something 1 wanted to tell
you about. We were a little short on
cash when the pool bill came, so we
had to pawn your little brother.

Son: I'm sure he'll find a nice home.
How's Grandma?
Dad: She got soryie new false teeth last
week. Now we can understand what
she's saying.
Son: I'm looking forward to coming
home to her cooking at Christmas.
Dad: Well son, we didn't have enough
to pay the dental bill, so we had to
leave Grandma with the dentist.
Son: That's too bad. But all those
cookies were just giving me cavities
anyway.
Dad: Yeah, we were lucky to get any
thing at all for the old girl.
Son: Dad, the reason I called, was, er,
ah, Dad, I got a girl, uh, pregnant. I
didn't even know her name. I got
drunk at a frat party and she was
pretty loaded herself and I didn't
take my normal precautions and—
Dad: I'm proud of you son. Such a con
scientious, industrious young lad.
Son: But Dad, 1 didn't sign a contract,
so she'll get all the money herself.
Dad: What? That was stupid. I bet you
want money from us now.
Son: Let's talk about that later. How is
Mom doing?
Dad: I had to use her to pay for the
groceries last week.
Son: Gol, Dad, you sound bad off.
Maybe you should apply for welfare,
or Aid to Dependent Children.
Dad: I don't have any children left.
Son: But you have me.
Dad: Well son, there's something I
meant to tell you earlier. I was a little
short for the mortgage payments and
you were the only one left, so ... .
Son: Don't worry Dad, 1 understand.
Dad: I'd better get off the phone now,
I'm spending all of your money.
Son: Don't worry, I called collect. Bye,
Dad.

According to the New York Times
Magazine of Aug. 17, 1975, a booming
business in black market babies is de
veloping in the United States. States
are dusting off old slavery statutes to
deal with the problem. This situation
has developed because the supply of
babies wanted for adoption is decreas
ing at a time when the demand for
them is increasing.
The Pill and abortion have elimi
nated many unwanted pregnancies
and unwed mothers are keeping their
offspring in greater numbers than be
fore. All of this comes at a time when
many couples are turning to adoption
because of the threat of overpopula
tion. Unfortunately, adoption of heal
thy white babies through conventional
agencies entails a three to seven year

wait, according to the Times. Couples,
unwilling to wait, are asking lawyers
to find women willing to give up their
children for adoption. The lawyers
command fees up to $25,000 for such a
transaction.
This is an ideal money-making op
portunity for Stanford students. Think
of the revenue-producing potential of
one Saturday night at the university.
The Farm's prime breeding stock
could charge outrageous prices for
their high quality offspring. The days
of debt and summer jobs could be
through forever.
This new plan, called "Bucks for
Babies," would be simple. A couple,
male and female, would sign an ag
reement with the Stanford "baby
broker." The couple would agree to

produce a baby for a set price, say
$25,000. The broker would locate a
buyer and collect a small commission.
All medical expenses would come out
of the commission. The couple would
split the profits. This would be called a
"50-50 proposition."
Only a few
Only a few pregnancies would be
needed to put a couple of students

through school. Certainly, ambitious
couples would exploit the system for
fun and profit far above that needed to
cover school expenses. Students could
have good times with all the extra
money.
Some loony airheads will attack the
plan with spurious charges that this is
"inhuman slavery." Bosh.
A group has even formed in opposi
tion, calling itself "The Infantry." Its
alarmist ravings are simply unfair and
not realistic. The girls would probably
go out and have abortions anyway, so
why not make some money out of the
deal? There might be a few bugs in the
plan, but that is typical of anything in
its embryonic stages.
New scenario
To demonstrate how ludicrous any
criticism is of this plan, let's show
what Stanford would be like if the in
novative "Bucks for Babies" scheme is
fully implemented. The scene: a male
Stanford student calling home. Let's
listen in.
Dad: (Ring) Hello?
Son: Hi Dad. This is your son.
Dad: Hey, good to hear from you.
How's school?
Son: Oh, it's going fine. Anything new
at home?
Dad: Yes, we finally got the swimming
pool installed in the backyard. It's a
real beauty.
Son: That's great. Now Jimmy will be
able to practice for the swim team.
Dad: That's something 1 wanted to tell
you about. We were a little short on
cash when the pool bill came, so we
had to pawn your little brother.

Son: I'm sure he'll find a nice home.
How's Grandma?
Dad: She got soryie new false teeth last
week. Now we can understand what
she's saying.
Son: I'm looking forward to coming
home to her cooking at Christmas.
Dad: Well son, we didn't have enough
to pay the dental bill, so we had to
leave Grandma with the dentist.
Son: That's too bad. But all those
cookies were just giving me cavities
anyway.
Dad: Yeah, we were lucky to get any
thing at all for the old girl.
Son: Dad, the reason I called, was, er,
ah, Dad, I got a girl, uh, pregnant. I
didn't even know her name. I got
drunk at a frat party and she was
pretty loaded herself and I didn't
take my normal precautions and—
Dad: I'm proud of you son. Such a con
scientious, industrious young lad.
Son: But Dad, 1 didn't sign a contract,
so she'll get all the money herself.
Dad: What? That was stupid. I bet you
want money from us now.
Son: Let's talk about that later. How is
Mom doing?
Dad: I had to use her to pay for the
groceries last week.
Son: Gol, Dad, you sound bad off.
Maybe you should apply for welfare,
or Aid to Dependent Children.
Dad: I don't have any children left.
Son: But you have me.
Dad: Well son, there's something I
meant to tell you earlier. I was a little
short for the mortgage payments and
you were the only one left, so ... .
Son: Don't worry Dad, 1 understand.
Dad: I'd better get off the phone now,
I'm spending all of your money.
Son: Don't worry, I called collect. Bye,
Dad.

According to the New York Times
Magazine of Aug. 17, 1975, a booming
business in black market babies is de
veloping in the United States. States
are dusting off old slavery statutes to
deal with the problem. This situation
has developed because the supply of
babies wanted for adoption is decreas
ing at a time when the demand for
them is increasing.
The Pill and abortion have elimi
nated many unwanted pregnancies
and unwed mothers are keeping their
offspring in greater numbers than be
fore. All of this comes at a time when
many couples are turning to adoption
because of the threat of overpopula
tion. Unfortunately, adoption of heal
thy white babies through conventional
agencies entails a three to seven year

wait, according to the Times. Couples,
unwilling to wait, are asking lawyers
to find women willing to give up their
children for adoption. The lawyers
command fees up to $25,000 for such a
transaction.
This is an ideal money-making op
portunity for Stanford students. Think
of the revenue-producing potential of
one Saturday night at the university.
The Farm's prime breeding stock
could charge outrageous prices for
their high quality offspring. The days
of debt and summer jobs could be
through forever.
This new plan, called "Bucks for
Babies," would be simple. A couple,
male and female, would sign an ag
reement with the Stanford "baby
broker." The couple would agree to

produce a baby for a set price, say
$25,000. The broker would locate a
buyer and collect a small commission.
All medical expenses would come out
of the commission. The couple would
split the profits. This would be called a
"50-50 proposition."
Only a few
Only a few pregnancies would be
needed to put a couple of students

through school. Certainly, ambitious
couples would exploit the system for
fun and profit far above that needed to
cover school expenses. Students could
have good times with all the extra
money.
Some loony airheads will attack the
plan with spurious charges that this is
"inhuman slavery." Bosh.
A group has even formed in opposi
tion, calling itself "The Infantry." Its
alarmist ravings are simply unfair and
not realistic. The girls would probably
go out and have abortions anyway, so
why not make some money out of the
deal? There might be a few bugs in the
plan, but that is typical of anything in
its embryonic stages.
New scenario
To demonstrate how ludicrous any
criticism is of this plan, let's show
what Stanford would be like if the in
novative "Bucks for Babies" scheme is
fully implemented. The scene: a male
Stanford student calling home. Let's
listen in.
Dad: (Ring) Hello?
Son: Hi Dad. This is your son.
Dad: Hey, good to hear from you.
How's school?
Son: Oh, it's going fine. Anything new
at home?
Dad: Yes, we finally got the swimming
pool installed in the backyard. It's a
real beauty.
Son: That's great. Now Jimmy will be
able to practice for the swim team.
Dad: That's something 1 wanted to tell
you about. We were a little short on
cash when the pool bill came, so we
had to pawn your little brother.

Son: I'm sure he'll find a nice home.
How's Grandma?
Dad: She got soryie new false teeth last
week. Now we can understand what
she's saying.
Son: I'm looking forward to coming
home to her cooking at Christmas.
Dad: Well son, we didn't have enough
to pay the dental bill, so we had to
leave Grandma with the dentist.
Son: That's too bad. But all those
cookies were just giving me cavities
anyway.
Dad: Yeah, we were lucky to get any
thing at all for the old girl.
Son: Dad, the reason I called, was, er,
ah, Dad, I got a girl, uh, pregnant. I
didn't even know her name. I got
drunk at a frat party and she was
pretty loaded herself and I didn't
take my normal precautions and—
Dad: I'm proud of you son. Such a con
scientious, industrious young lad.
Son: But Dad, 1 didn't sign a contract,
so she'll get all the money herself.
Dad: What? That was stupid. I bet you
want money from us now.
Son: Let's talk about that later. How is
Mom doing?
Dad: I had to use her to pay for the
groceries last week.
Son: Gol, Dad, you sound bad off.
Maybe you should apply for welfare,
or Aid to Dependent Children.
Dad: I don't have any children left.
Son: But you have me.
Dad: Well son, there's something I
meant to tell you earlier. I was a little
short for the mortgage payments and
you were the only one left, so ... .
Son: Don't worry Dad, 1 understand.
Dad: I'd better get off the phone now,
I'm spending all of your money.
Son: Don't worry, I called collect. Bye,
Dad.
