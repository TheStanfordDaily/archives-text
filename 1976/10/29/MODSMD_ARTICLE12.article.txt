Students not apathetic
I am writing in response to the arti
cle entitled "The Views They Are
A-Changin' " (Daily, Oct. 26). This is
the latest in a series of articles printed
by the Daily over the past several
months which say, in effect, that col
lege students today care very little
about their country or what happens in
it.
The tone of these articles has been
that the fervor of the '60s is gone and
that political activism on college cam
puses is dead or dying. Moreover, the
Daily's tone is critical of this so-called
"apathy."
I respond by saying that college stu
dents, and particularly Stanford stu
dents, are farther from an apathetic at
titude than ever before. Students care
more deeply about this nation and its
government than the Daily would dare
to think about: what is different bet
ween students of the mid-'7os and the
students of the late-'6os is the way in
which today's students care.
College students today realize that
the way to change the system is to
work hard in school, graduate with a
degree, get a job, and aggressively try
to reform the system while working
within it. They have learned some val
uable lessons by watching the students
of the '60s — namely, that the way to
change things is not by tearing them
down.

The college student today is more
pragmatic; he/she realizes that throw
ing rocks through windows does no
thing to change the system. Indeed,
destruction serves as a retardant to
change because the leaders within the
system are much more reluctant to
negotiate with hecklers than with
well-spoken, but firm-minded, young
people.
Even the traditionally left-wing
elements on campus, such as the Al
liance for Radical Change (ARC),
realize that the way to get their views
across is to be vocal, not vandalistic. In
short, students have found that the
method for change is not to tear down
the system, but instead to build new
ideas within in.
If the Daily is trying to serve as a
rallying point for a rebirth of the cam
pus violence of the '60s, it had better
stop for its own good; for it is
quickly gaining the reputation of
being an amateurish, rabble-rousing
publication which is trying to exhume
a dead and badly beaten horse. And
maybe someday theDuily will open its
eyes and print some stories about how
fraternities and other campus organi
zations make a real effort to help out
the university, the surrounding com
munity, and — as a result — the coun
try.

I am writing in response to the arti
cle entitled "The Views They Are
A-Changin' " (Daily, Oct. 26). This is
the latest in a series of articles printed
by the Daily over the past several
months which say, in effect, that col
lege students today care very little
about their country or what happens in
it.
The tone of these articles has been
that the fervor of the '60s is gone and
that political activism on college cam
puses is dead or dying. Moreover, the
Daily's tone is critical of this so-called
"apathy."
I respond by saying that college stu
dents, and particularly Stanford stu
dents, are farther from an apathetic at
titude than ever before. Students care
more deeply about this nation and its
government than the Daily would dare
to think about: what is different bet
ween students of the mid-'7os and the
students of the late-'6os is the way in
which today's students care.
College students today realize that
the way to change the system is to
work hard in school, graduate with a
degree, get a job, and aggressively try
to reform the system while working
within it. They have learned some val
uable lessons by watching the students
of the '60s — namely, that the way to
change things is not by tearing them
down.

The college student today is more
pragmatic; he/she realizes that throw
ing rocks through windows does no
thing to change the system. Indeed,
destruction serves as a retardant to
change because the leaders within the
system are much more reluctant to
negotiate with hecklers than with
well-spoken, but firm-minded, young
people.
Even the traditionally left-wing
elements on campus, such as the Al
liance for Radical Change (ARC),
realize that the way to get their views
across is to be vocal, not vandalistic. In
short, students have found that the
method for change is not to tear down
the system, but instead to build new
ideas within in.
If the Daily is trying to serve as a
rallying point for a rebirth of the cam
pus violence of the '60s, it had better
stop for its own good; for it is
quickly gaining the reputation of
being an amateurish, rabble-rousing
publication which is trying to exhume
a dead and badly beaten horse. And
maybe someday theDuily will open its
eyes and print some stories about how
fraternities and other campus organi
zations make a real effort to help out
the university, the surrounding com
munity, and — as a result — the coun
try.
