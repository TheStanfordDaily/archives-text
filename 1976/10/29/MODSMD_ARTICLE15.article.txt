## McCloskey, Harris disagree 
### Marc Strassman 
Candidate David Harris has
playfully offered to give his op
ponent Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park) a job if the in
cumbent will pull out of the
Congressional race.
Harris made the remark Wed
nesday when the two candidates
were answering questions at
kresge Auditorium.
McCloskey was explaining
how he helped his one-time
primary opponent Gordon
knapp get a job as assistant
secretary of the Air Force (for In
stallation and Logistics). Harris
remarked, "I'll give you a job,
too, if you'll pull out of the race."
McCloskey explained that
knapp, a conservative mid-
Peninsula businessman, who
came within 848 votes of defeat
ing the incumbent in the 1974
Republican primary, stopped by
his district office in the fall of
1975 and told him he was in
terested in a job in the executive
branch of the federal govern
ment.
McCloskey obligingly called a
friend of his at the White House,
Doug Bennett, and told him that
he had a constitutent in his office
who would like a job and asked,
"Can you do anything?"
Three or four months later,
knapp was appointed assistant
secretary of the Air Force by
McCloskey's former House of
Representatives colleague, Presi
dent Gerald Ford. This position,
said McCloskey, entitles knapp
"to decide which air bases to close
down."
Moderator Byron Sher, a law

school professor here, asked
Harris if he cared to comment.
"I wish I was in a position to
give Gordon knapp a job," said
Harrris.
Released from prison
McCloskey asked Harris to
clarify his statement that "our
lives would be better off without
any government."
Harris explained that he made
the statement four days after
being released from federal
prison where he had spent 20
months for refusing induction
into the armed forces because he
opposed the Vietnam war.
Harris said that at the time he
made the statement he had "just
finished a relationship with the
government that was quite un
satisfactory." While he is still
suspicious of government, he
said he now considers it "a tool
available to us."
The candidates disagreed on
many topics. Harris supported
Democratic presidential candi
date Jimmy Carter's program for
national health insurance while
McCloskey opposed the
kennedy-Corman Health Insur
ance Bill. McCloskey defended
his vote in Congress not to con
sider the Equal Rights Amend
ment under a procedural rule
that would have allowed only
one hour for debate.
Harris said, "1 don't think it
would take me an hour to decide
on the ERA."
McCloskey said Ford had
adequately answered questions
about his role in blocking a pre
election 1972 probe of the
Watergate burglary being con

ducted then by the House Bank
ing Committee.
Harris said he "wants to see
more investigation. I'd like to
hear the tapes played." The
tapes carry alleged White House
references to Ford's part in
blocking the process.
There was some disagreement
between the candidates on the
subjects of nuclear power and
socialism, which Harris said he
understood to mean "public
ownership of the means of
production." Harris said that he
didn't consider his plan to insti
tute a negative income tax as
either socialism or a threat.
McCloskey, emphasizing his
attitude towards public owner
ship of the means of production,
said "I would not like to see the
U.S. move towards socialism.
"David's opposition to
socialism is not consistent," said
McCloskey, because he (Harris)
opposed turning the nuclear fuel
enrichment process over to pri
vate industry and wanted to
"maintain a government
monopoly."
Harris said that the govern
ment had always been the sole
producer of nuclear fuel and that
hardly constituted "creeping
socialism."
To turn production of atomic
fuel sources over to private cor
porations would be "an unwar
ranted expansion that we don't
need," he said.
Whitman House appearance
Harris later made a campaign
appearance at Whitman House
with Jill Volner, a former pro
secutor in the special pro

secutor's office which handled the
Watergate case, and Mary King,
director of the Carter-Mondale Na
tional Feminist Committee (51.3
per cent Committee).
King spoke out against the
"disbelief and skepticism"
which she said are the "greatest
enemies" of Carter. She said Car
ter's wife Rosalynn could be ex
pected to take the same active
role on the national level, par
ticularly in matters relating to
mental health and the elderly,
that she had in Georgia when her
husband was governor there.
Volner said that her experi
ence on the Watergate prosecu
tion team had convinced her that
"the president must be of great
integrity," and that "it makes me
sad we've forgotten so fast about
the roles (some individuals) had
played in Watergate."

secretary of the Air Force by
McCloskey's former House of
Representatives colleague, Presi
dent Gerald Ford. This position,
said McCloskey, entitles knapp
"to decide which air bases to close
down."
Moderator Byron Sher, a law

school professor here, asked
Harris if he cared to comment.
"I wish I was in a position to
give Gordon knapp a job," said
Harrris.
Released from prison
McCloskey asked Harris to
clarify his statement that "our
lives would be better off without
any government."
Harris explained that he made
the statement four days after
being released from federal
prison where he had spent 20
months for refusing induction
into the armed forces because he
opposed the Vietnam war.
Harris said that at the time he
made the statement he had "just
finished a relationship with the
government that was quite un
satisfactory." While he is still
suspicious of government, he
said he now considers it "a tool
available to us."
The candidates disagreed on
many topics. Harris supported
Democratic presidential candi
date Jimmy Carter's program for
national health insurance while
McCloskey opposed the
kennedy-Corman Health Insur
ance Bill. McCloskey defended
his vote in Congress not to con
sider the Equal Rights Amend
ment under a procedural rule
that would have allowed only
one hour for debate.
Harris said, "1 don't think it
would take me an hour to decide
on the ERA."
McCloskey said Ford had
adequately answered questions
about his role in blocking a pre
election 1972 probe of the
Watergate burglary being con

ducted then by the House Bank
ing Committee.
Harris said he "wants to see
more investigation. I'd like to
hear the tapes played." The
tapes carry alleged White House
references to Ford's part in
blocking the process.
There was some disagreement
between the candidates on the
subjects of nuclear power and
socialism, which Harris said he
understood to mean "public
ownership of the means of
production." Harris said that he
didn't consider his plan to insti
tute a negative income tax as
either socialism or a threat.
McCloskey, emphasizing his
attitude towards public owner
ship of the means of production,
said "I would not like to see the
U.S. move towards socialism.
"David's opposition to
socialism is not consistent," said
McCloskey, because he (Harris)
opposed turning the nuclear fuel
enrichment process over to pri
vate industry and wanted to
"maintain a government
monopoly."
Harris said that the govern
ment had always been the sole
producer of nuclear fuel and that
hardly constituted "creeping
socialism."
To turn production of atomic
fuel sources over to private cor
porations would be "an unwar
ranted expansion that we don't
need," he said.
Whitman House appearance
Harris later made a campaign
appearance at Whitman House
with Jill Volner, a former pro
secutor in the special pro

secutor's office which handled the
Watergate case, and Mary King,
director of the Carter-Mondale Na
tional Feminist Committee (51.3
per cent Committee).
King spoke out against the
"disbelief and skepticism"
which she said are the "greatest
enemies" of Carter. She said Car
ter's wife Rosalynn could be ex
pected to take the same active
role on the national level, par
ticularly in matters relating to
mental health and the elderly,
that she had in Georgia when her
husband was governor there.
Volner said that her experi
ence on the Watergate prosecu
tion team had convinced her that
"the president must be of great
integrity," and that "it makes me
sad we've forgotten so fast about
the roles (some individuals) had
played in Watergate."
Candidate David Harris has
playfully offered to give his op
ponent Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park) a job if the in
cumbent will pull out of the
Congressional race.
Harris made the remark Wed
nesday when the two candidates
were answering questions at
kresge Auditorium.
McCloskey was explaining
how he helped his one-time
primary opponent Gordon
knapp get a job as assistant
secretary of the Air Force (for In
stallation and Logistics). Harris
remarked, "I'll give you a job,
too, if you'll pull out of the race."
McCloskey explained that
knapp, a conservative mid-
Peninsula businessman, who
came within 848 votes of defeat
ing the incumbent in the 1974
Republican primary, stopped by
his district office in the fall of
1975 and told him he was in
terested in a job in the executive
branch of the federal govern
ment.
McCloskey obligingly called a
friend of his at the White House,
Doug Bennett, and told him that
he had a constitutent in his office
who would like a job and asked,
"Can you do anything?"

ment under a procedural rule
that would have allowed only
one hour for debate.
Harris said, "1 don't think it
would take me an hour to decide
on the ERA."
McCloskey said Ford had
adequately answered questions
about his role in blocking a pre
election 1972 probe of the
Watergate burglary being con

ducted then by the House Bank
ing Committee.
Harris said he "wants to see
more investigation. I'd like to
hear the tapes played." The
tapes carry alleged White House
references to Ford's part in
blocking the process.
There was some disagreement
between the candidates on the
subjects of nuclear power and
socialism, which Harris said he
understood to mean "public
ownership of the means of
production." Harris said that he
didn't consider his plan to insti
tute a negative income tax as
either socialism or a threat.
McCloskey, emphasizing his
attitude towards public owner
ship of the means of production,
said "I would not like to see the
U.S. move towards socialism.
"David's opposition to
socialism is not consistent," said
McCloskey, because he (Harris)
opposed turning the nuclear fuel
enrichment process over to pri
vate industry and wanted to
"maintain a government
monopoly."
Harris said that the govern
ment had always been the sole
producer of nuclear fuel and that
hardly constituted "creeping
socialism."
To turn production of atomic
fuel sources over to private cor
porations would be "an unwar
ranted expansion that we don't
need," he said.
Whitman House appearance
Harris later made a campaign
appearance at Whitman House
with Jill Volner, a former pro
secutor in the special pro

secutor's office which handled the
Watergate case, and Mary King,
director of the Carter-Mondale Na
tional Feminist Committee (51.3
per cent Committee).
King spoke out against the
"disbelief and skepticism"
which she said are the "greatest
enemies" of Carter. She said Car
ter's wife Rosalynn could be ex
pected to take the same active
role on the national level, par
ticularly in matters relating to
mental health and the elderly,
that she had in Georgia when her
husband was governor there.
Volner said that her experi
ence on the Watergate prosecu
tion team had convinced her that
"the president must be of great
integrity," and that "it makes me
sad we've forgotten so fast about
the roles (some individuals) had
played in Watergate."
Candidate David Harris has
playfully offered to give his op
ponent Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park) a job if the in
cumbent will pull out of the
Congressional race.
Harris made the remark Wed
nesday when the two candidates
were answering questions at
kresge Auditorium.
McCloskey was explaining
how he helped his one-time
primary opponent Gordon
knapp get a job as assistant
secretary of the Air Force (for In
stallation and Logistics). Harris
remarked, "I'll give you a job,
too, if you'll pull out of the race."
McCloskey explained that
knapp, a conservative mid-
Peninsula businessman, who
came within 848 votes of defeat
ing the incumbent in the 1974
Republican primary, stopped by
his district office in the fall of
1975 and told him he was in
terested in a job in the executive
branch of the federal govern
ment.
McCloskey obligingly called a
friend of his at the White House,
Doug Bennett, and told him that
he had a constitutent in his office
who would like a job and asked,
"Can you do anything?"
Three or four months later,
knapp was appointed assistant
secretary of the Air Force by
McCloskey's former House of
Representatives colleague, Presi
dent Gerald Ford. This position,
said McCloskey, entitles knapp
"to decide which air bases to close
down."
Moderator Byron Sher, a law

school professor here, asked
Harris if he cared to comment.
"I wish I was in a position to
give Gordon knapp a job," said
Harrris.
Released from prison
McCloskey asked Harris to
clarify his statement that "our
lives would be better off without
any government."
Harris explained that he made
the statement four days after
being released from federal
prison where he had spent 20
months for refusing induction
into the armed forces because he
opposed the Vietnam war.
Harris said that at the time he
made the statement he had "just
finished a relationship with the
government that was quite un
satisfactory." While he is still
suspicious of government, he
said he now considers it "a tool
available to us."
The candidates disagreed on
many topics. Harris supported
Democratic presidential candi
date Jimmy Carter's program for
national health insurance while
McCloskey opposed the
kennedy-Corman Health Insur
ance Bill. McCloskey defended
his vote in Congress not to con
sider the Equal Rights Amend
ment under a procedural rule
that would have allowed only
one hour for debate.
