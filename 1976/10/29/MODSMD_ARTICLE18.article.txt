## A
						small success Swallow Press story 
### Dana Gioia 
The most exciting places in
American publishing are small
presses. They are currently
printing some of the best writers
in America. Morever, each year
as the major publishing com
panies bring out fewer volumes
of serious fiction and poetry, the
importance of small presses will
continue to grow.
Yet despite their increasing
importance in American litera
ture, few people have any idea
what small presses are like.
Swallow Press, a tiny publish
ing company located in Chicago,
is an excellenj example of the
small presses which are keeping
American literature alive. If it is
different than any of the
hundred other tiny publishing
companies in this country, it is
only because Swallow is older
and has a more distinguished list
of authors. Its origin?:, problems
and resources are much the
same.
Origins
In 1940 a graduate student
named Alan Swallow was study
ing at Louisiana State University
under Robert Penn Warren and
C lea nth Brooks. Deciding to
publish a collection of student
writing, he purchased a small
hand press that he moved to his
garage.
From these modest begin
nings Swallow gradually de
veloped into one of the most im
portant small publishers in
America. Twenty-five years later
Swallow had moved from
Louisiana to Colorado and from
two books a year to fifty. During
his peak year in 1960, Swallow
mailed 70,000 volumes out of his
garage. Most of the printing was
now done by a professional
press, but Swallow still directed
every phase of the operation
himself.
During these years Swallow
acquired a list of authors as im
pressive as many major firms.

Included among the writers he
first published or later took on a
regular basis are Yvor Winters,
Anais Nin, Allen Tate, Janet
Lewis, J.V. Cunningham, Vardis
Fisher, and Edgar Bowers.
Significantly, these writers
were either having difficulty
finding publishers for their work
or their best work had gone out
of print after poor sales.
Believed in his authors
Once an author came to Swal
low, he or she rarely left. Al
though Swallow could not offer
the financial rewards of a big
Eastern house, he believed in his
authors. No matter what sales
they produced Swallow kept his
best books in his catalogue.
Many important writers owe
their reputations to Swallow's
dedication. He kept the novels of
Janet Lewis in print through
years of neglect. Only now, de
cades after their publication,are
her books becoming recognized
as important American novels.
Likewise when Anais Nin
could not find an American pub
lisher, Swallow rescued her. He
brought all of her novels back
into print. Then he convinced
Harcourt, Brace and World to
enter a joint publishing venture
with him and bring out her
diaries. This partnership was
broken only by Swallow's death.
Equally important was Swal
low's commitment to poets. No
matter how small sales might be
he was always eager to publish
the work of young or under
valued poets. Stanford writers
were especially fortunate. He
published books of verse by Yvor
Winters, J.V. Cunningham,
Edgar Bowers, Janet Lewis, Alan
Stephens, and several other
Stanford writers.
When Swallow died on
Thanksgiving Day in 1966, it
seemed as if this unique literary
venture had ended. But, luckily,
Swallow's press became one of
the few cases in which the good a

man did lived after him. Mort
Weisman, a bookseller who had
never met Swallow, bought the
assets of the press and decided to
keep it going in the same spirit.
Weisman moved the offices of
the press to his native city of
Chicago, but kept the 20,000 un
catalogued volumes of Swal
low's inventory in Denver.
Slowly things got organized as
Weisman and his associates
began filling orders, reprinting
steady sellers and publishing
new titles.
Most of Swallow's best au
thors continued publishing with
the new press and new authors
were introduced. Now nearly ten
years after the change of re
gimes, the current Swallow
catalogue exhibits a healthy
mixture of the old and the new.
Swallow Press is still a tiny
enterprise. There are only four
full-time people on the staff.
Their offices consist of a few
rooms on the third floor of a
spacious old home near
Chicago's Lakeshore Drive.
What possible advantages
would an author have by ignor
ing the big Eastern houses and
publishing with Swallow? Quite
a few, it seems. In the case of a
previously unpublished author,
many Eastern houses won't even
read an unsolicited manuscript.
But Swallow Press has con
tinued the spirit of its founder in
discovering and supporting new
writers.
Nor does an author suffer
much from lack of exposure by
publishing with Swallow. "The
market for serious books is very
small," Weisman admits. "But I
believe that Swallow Press
knows how to reach this small
audience as well as any press in
the country. For example, we
run the same number of copies of
a new book of verse as most big,
Eastern houses do."
