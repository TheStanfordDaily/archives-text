Rosalyn Basandall, Linda
Gordon and Susan Reverbys's
anthology of America's Working
Women from 1600 to the present
is an ambitious effort to inject
working-women into the
mainstream of American his
tory.
The'authors contend that the
work of housekeepers, factory
employees, secretaries, waitres
ses and prostitutes h&s been
excluded far too long from the
history of this country. This neg
lect, they concede, is not acci
dental. They believe it is a con
spiracy by American capitalists
to suppress working-class con
sciousness.
Only when working-class
women are included in the cent
ral chapters of American history
can women, the authors stress,
reconstruct society. This new
society would strip the sexes of
legal and economic differences,
and would develop along
socialist lines.
The 400-page book reads like a
newspaper bound by a hard
cover. For this reason. Working
Women is spread a little thin
over the 400 years it attempts to
cover, and risks oversimplifica
tion. Too often the authors attri
bute the cause of a major change

in American history to a single
indigestible factor without exa
mining alternate points of view.
The Marxist-revisionist analysis
has a stranglehold over their in
terpretation of history.
Nevertheless, Working
Women offers invaluable mate
rials heretofore not seen in his
torical texts. The book includes
provocative essays, diaries,
union records, letters and
photographs that chronicle the
lives of women laborers of virtu
ally all cultures and races. The
spirit and pulse that beats
throughout the book becomes
increasngly lively as women tell
their story of struggle and con
frontation.
Discrimination
Some of the more interesting
forms of discrimination in the
book are worth repeating here.
Women who practiced healing
in the 17th century were some
times burned as witches or
banished. Female indentured
servants faced a real double
standard. They were powerless
to resist their masters' sexual ad
vances and were forbidden to
marry. Some black women in
isolated rural areas were never
told of their emancipation after
the Civil War. Only when condi
tions reached intolerable levels

did they run away and discover
freedom.
Women along the Oregon trail
didn't always share the glamor
of the rugged West. Women's
trail diaries express a pervasive
helplessness devoid of any
material comforts.
Although nursing was more
respected after the heroics of
Florence Nightengale in the
Crimean War, women still had to
overcome prejudice. Male pa
tients resisted women carrying
off their bedpans.
Certain chapters delve into the
character of the working woman.
There is an electric profile on the
birth of rank and file union or
ganizer Agnes Nestor.
AFL opposition
Certain facts and ideas are
emphasized in this book that have
been passed over by the general
reader of American history. The
American Federation of Labor
(AFL), for instance, opposed the
entry of women and blacks into
the work force. Boycotting meat,

we learn, is not a recent innova
tion. In 1902 Jewish women
doused meat with kerosene in a
protest over high meat prices.
Most startling of all might be the
fact that the Equal Rights
Amendment (ERA) has been
proposed in every session since
1923.
It is not true, the authors
claim, that working women have
more delinquent children. De
linquency, they say, is directly
linked to lack of money, not to
the lack of a mother in the home.
The authors also add that col
lege education has not improved
women's opportunities for work.
Instead it has allowed employers
to require education for jobs that
previously required none.
Working Women has suc
ceeded in taking women from
the periphery of American his
tory and placing them instead, at
the center of it. The remaining
question now is whether society
will permit them to stay there.
