# National faculty vote Carter

Jimmy Carter "will win the profes
sorial vote by a large margin, but with
out any very strong commitment," ac
cording to a nationwide survey con
ducted between Oct. 19 and Oct. 21 by
the Social Science Data Center at the
University of Connecticut.
From an analysis of the survey data,
which involved telephone interviews
with 481 professors at 105 colleges and
universities, Prof. Everett Carll Ladd
Jr. of the University of Connecticut,
now a visiting scholar at the Hoover
Institution and Political Science Prof.
Seymour Upset, a Senior Fellow at the
Institution, found that, although 57
per cent of those polled plan to vote for
the Democratic candidate, "the most
liberal faculty are notably unen
thusiastic about Carter. Sixty-five per
cent of those who describe themselves
as very liberal, for example, maintain
that he is not well suited to be presi
dent," the study concluded.
Nevertheless, most liberal
academics plan to vote for the Geor
gian. Ladd and Lipset characterize

their position as "Better Carter than
Ford, even though we don't like Car
ter."
The social scientists explain the
substantial 57-28 per cent preference
for Carter over Ford revealed by the
poll by saying that "faculty appear to
support Carter not because they like
him but because their predominant
liberalism leads them to reject a con
servative candidate."
Ladd and Lipset observe also that
"professors closely resemble blue col
lar workers and the less educated in
their electoral preferences. Manual
workers, a recent New York Times-
CBS poll reveals, back Carter by 57 per
cent to 28, while the Democrat leads
among those with less than 12 grades
of schooling by 55 to 22 per cent." Pro
fessors seem to break the trend that,
"the lower the income, the higher the
proportion" for Carter, say Ladd and
Lipset.
High rates of dissatisfaction and
substantial voter turnout were both
predicted by the survey. "Over half, 54
per cent, of our sample agree that 'we

really do not have any adequate major
party nominee this year. Neither the
Democrats nor the Republicans have
nominated a man well-suited to be
president.' "
Nevertheless, the scholars report,
"Ninety-six per cent of all profes
sors. . .including the overwhelming
majority of those dissatisfied with the
choices before them, told us in
anonymous interviews that they plan
to vote."
Significant differences emerged
from the data concerning variation in
presidential preferences according to
age and academic discipline. Social
scientists, humanists, and natural sci
entists support Carter in that descend
ing order, while more professional
school faculty plan to vote for Ford
> rather than for Carter.
"Fort's support varies directly and
significantly with the age of the pro
fessor, according to Ladd and Lipset.
"Ford is backed by 41 per cent of fa
culty 55 years of age or older, but by
only 20 per cent of those 35 years old or
younger."
