## Trick or treat? Cards host crippled Beavers 
### David Georgette 
Halloween is two days away,
but the Stanford Cardinals
should have to wait only half
that long to get their treat when
tomorrow the orange and black
Oregon State Beavers visit Stan
ford Stadium. Kick-off is at 1:30,
and it is Fan Appreciation Day.
In the past, Stanford fans
would be able to see Dee Andros,
theGreatPumpkin, call the shots
for the Beavers. But Andros re
tired as head coach last year dur
ing a disastrous 1-10 season and
is now OSU's athletic director.
To find a new coach, Andros
reached into the depths of Trojan
tradition at USC and plucked a
plum, Craig Fertig. And an in
spection of the OSU sidelines
tomorrow will reveal a Craig Fer
tig with a physique which car
ries little resemblence to the one
he displayed as a fine college
quarterback at SC in 1964. He is
far, though, from being a
pumpkin.
But fans don't dwell on
coaches' waistlines. They look at
their records. Well, don't look at
OSU's record â€” it's 1 -6. It seems
as if Fertig left his Trojan magic
in Los Angeles.
Big deficit
The Beavers, in being out
scored this season 204-65, have
run up against some respectable
teams. Last Saturday USC
showed no mercy to its 10-year
assistant, clobbering the Beav

ers, 56-0. OSU's solitary
triumph, two weeks ago in Cor
vallis against California, 10-9,
ranks as the conference upset of
the season so far.
"Last week was really no indi
cation of Oregon State's ability,"
said Stanford head coach Jack
Christiansen. "We're going off
their performance against Cal.
They were really emotionally
ready for that game and played
very well."
It is the defensive strategy
employed by the Beavers against
Cal that has Christiansen con
cerned. "Their defense has re
ally been tough," said Chris.
"We expect their game plan to be
double-coverage on the wide re
ceivers. They try to cut them
down at the line of scrimmage
and disrupt their patterns, and
then they go with a two-deep
zone."
Two-deep zone
Oregon State incorporates
linebacker blitzes into its defen
sive scheme, too. "They use a lot
of double coverage and blitz
coverage and try to make the two
of them look alike," said Christ
iansen.
The Beavers are leading the
conference in pass defense, al
lowing an average of only 90.1
yards a game through the air.
About the Beavers' defensive
backs, Christiansen said, "They
are good athletes."
TheCards,2-l inthePacific-8,

are ranked second in the confer
ence in passing with an average
of 249 yards a game. Fertig cal
led Guy Benjamin "a very accu
rate passer, both long and short."
Tony Hill, who with his first
catch tomorrow will break Gene
Washington's school career re
cord for receptions (122), is
termed by Fertig "one of the best
receivers we will face this year."
Speechless
Hill's potential accomplish
ment tomorrow leaves the wide
receiver at a loss for words. "It is
hard to sum up in words," said
Hill. "It's a great feeling to break
a record set by Gene
Washington."
Christiansen said Stanford
will try to use its blossoming
ground attack more tomorrow.
The Cards gained 216 yards
overland last week against
Washington State.
"Donnie Stevenson will start
at fullback if he's healthy," said
Christiansen. Stevenson was
forced out of action last week be
cause of a leg injury. Super
sophomore Phil Francis, averag
ing 4.7 yards per carry, is battl
ing a sore knee and a sore ankle,
but he will be ready to go tomor
row.
Black and blue
One of the reasons the orange
and black have only one victory
is because they've been black
and blue most of the year. The
Beavers have had eight players

lost for the season due to injury.
Against SC, Fertig said, "We
were badly beaten up physically.
We lost 10 or 12 players during
the game with injuries."
Oregon State's top three quar
terbacks are out for the year.
Freshman Scott Richardson,
who himself has an ankle sprain,
is expected to start at the helm.
He has completed only 29 per
cent of his passes. And the Beav
ers' ground attack has not com
pensated for this deficiency with
its average of 126 yards a game.
Offensively, then, Oregon
State looks pretty futile, and the
Cards should bag their treat with
ease. However, Christiansen
warns against lethargy. "The
players have got to get them
selves up," he said. "This is a
team that beat California."
