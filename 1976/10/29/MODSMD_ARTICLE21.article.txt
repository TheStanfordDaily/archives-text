After picking three of four games correctly
last week, our predictor is aiming for a perfect
mark this time around. His season percentage
is now a booming .833. The wizard's crystal
ball has correctly forecast 10 of 12 games.
First-year coach Craig Fertig brings his
injury-stricken Oregon State Beavers into
Stanford Stadium tomorrow afternoon. OSU is
coming off a 56-0 loss to fourth-ranked USC
last weekend.
But don't bet your tuition money that the
Cards will beat the 17-point spread. Quarter
back Guy Benjamin says that if the Beavers
are inspired it could be a close contest. If
OSU isn't keyed out of its mind, then you can
look for a rout.
UCLA hasn't beaten Washington, on the
shores of Lake Washington since 1958, when

Stanford 28, Oregon State 21
UCLA 35, Washington 28
USC 21, California 14
Washington State 21, Oregon 20

Bruin coach Terry Donahue was 14 years old.
The Huskies have won the last two games.
But we'll go with third-ranked UCLA. The
Bruin veer offense will just be too tough for the
Husky defense.
USC took over the nation's total offense lead
last week. The Trojans are getting to the heart
of their conference schedule, facing Califor
nia, Stanford and UCLA in the next four weeks.
As Cal coach Mike White said after last
week's 35-19 loss to UCLA, the Bears can only
hope to spoil someone else's Rose Bowl
hopes. But Cal won't spoil the Trojans' New
Year's Day plans.
The toughest game to call is the battle of the
cellar - Washington State vs. Oregon. The
Ducks return home after losing three road con
tests, but Cougar quarterback Jack
Thompson won't make it a nice homecoming.
