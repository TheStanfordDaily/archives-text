# Francis: Cards' back of the future
## Soph compared to Scott Laidlaw 
### Chris Baker 
Phil Francis has no illusions.
So what that he gained 137 yards on 28
carries last week.
His performance earned him NorCal
Player of the Week honors, but it didn't
earn him a starting spot in the Card
backfield.
"I don't expect to be starting," said
Francis. "I was just filling in for Donny
Stevenson. He's been doing a heck of a
job for us. I don't feel like I've won myself
a starting job."
But he certainly won last Saturday's
contest against Washington State for
Stanford. Francis carried the entire Card
offensive load in the 22-16 victory over
the Cougars.
Crucial situations
Francis converted two crucial third
down situations during Stanford's six
and one-half minute game-winning
drive. He gained 30 of his yards on the
drive.
"I don't think I lost a yard the entire
game," said Francis. "I attribute that to
the line. When you're in the huddle it's
nice to see (offensive tackle) Gordy
King."
Going into last Saturday's game, Fran
cis had gained 100 yards on just 22 car
ries. His performance certainly helped
bolster his confidence. The sophomore
admits it wasn't too high after fumbling
against Michigan on his first rushing at
tempt of the year.
'Turning point'
"Before the Washington game, I wasn't
really sure of myself," said Francis. "It
was the turning point. Before that 1 was
just going into games not wanting to
make mistakes. I was gun shy."
Card coach Jack Christiansen com
pares the sophomore from Beaverton,
Ore., to ex-Stanford running back Scott
Laidlaw, now with the Dallas Cowboys.
"Both Phil and Laidlaw are a lot alike in
the way they move," said Christiansen.
"But I think Phil gets to the line of
scrimmage a little quicker than Laid
law."
Christiansen speculated that Francis
runs well on artificial surfaces, such as
WSU's Martin Stadium, because he's
flat-footed.
'Bad suggestion'
"I think it's a bad suggestion," said
Francis. "I don't like astroturf. I bruised
my elbows on it." He played his entire

prep career on artificial surfaces. "That
was one of the reasons I decided to come
here, besides the weather."
Francis is one of seven Oregonians on
the Stanford roster. When former UCLA
basketball star Richard Washington was
being recruited by the Bruins, former
Oregon Governor Tom McCall said that
"losing Oregon athletes is like losing
natural resources."
"I don't think there's any real animos
ity," Francis said. "Oregon does lose a lot
of players to out-of-state schools. I've
read where they talk about how we can't
get excited for the northern schools. For
Oregon State, I'll be as ready as for any
game. My folks will be coming to this
game. They were also at WSU last week."
Considered OSU
If Francis hadn't decided to come to
the Farm, he might be wearing the
orange and black of Oregon State. "It
came down to Colorado and Oregon
State," said Francis. "If I didn't get ac
cepted at Stanford I probably would have
gone to Oregon State."
Francis gained over 1000 yards as a
high school junior, to lead Beaverton to
the state title. But his squad ran into
Larry Reynolds' Corvallis squad in the
first playoff game during his senior year.
"Stanford doesn't get a lot of quality
running backs," said Francis. "You don't
get many O.J. Simpsons coming here."
But you certainly get a lot of aspiring
Jim Plunketts.
Starting lineup
Some fans have suggested that Francis
should be moved from the fullback posi
tion to get him into the starting lineup
with Stevenson. "I'm not really that
(tailback) type. There are a lot of different
assignments to learn. It's taken me a year
and a half to learn the assignments.
"Ron Inge is a heck of a good blocker.
He almost never makes a mistake. Don
ny's doing a heck of a job. We play a pro
offense and it takes a lot of experience."
Last week Francis looked like he was
playing tailback instead of fullback. "If
you call what I'm playing a fullback,
then's it's my best position. I like to run
wide."
Francis, a communications major, said
he would like to try his hand at broad
casting. He might even give pro football a
shot, but he said, "It's a long way off."
A 1000-yard season might not be a
long wav off for Francis.

was one of the reasons I decided to come
here, besides the weather."
Francis is one of seven Oregonians on
the Stanford roster. When former UCLA
basketball star Richard Washington was
being recruited by the Bruins, former
Oregon Governor Tom McCall said that
"losing Oregon athletes is like losing
natural resources."
"I don't think there's any real animos
ity," Francis said. "Oregon does lose a lot
of players to out-of-state schools. I've
read where they talk about how we can't
get excited for the northern schools. For
Oregon State, I'll be as ready as for any
game. My folks will be coming to this
game. They were also at WSU last week."
Considered OSU
If Francis hadn't decided to come to
the Farm, he might be wearing the
orange and black of Oregon State. "It
came down to Colorado and Oregon
State," said Francis. "If I didn't get ac
cepted at Stanford I probably would have
gone to Oregon State."
Francis gained over 1000 yards as a
high school junior, to lead Beaverton to
the state title. But his squad ran into
Larry Reynolds' Corvallis squad in the
first playoff game during his senior year.
"Stanford doesn't get a lot of quality
running backs," said Francis. "You don't
get many O.J. Simpsons coming here."
But you certainly get a lot of aspiring
Jim Plunketts.
Starting lineup
Some fans have suggested that Francis
should be moved from the fullback posi
tion to get him into the starting lineup
with Stevenson. "I'm not really that
(tailback) type. There are a lot of different
assignments to learn. It's taken me a year
and a half to learn the assignments.
"Ron Inge is a heck of a good blocker.
He almost never makes a mistake. Don
ny's doing a heck of a job. We play a pro
offense and it takes a lot of experience."
Last week Francis looked like he was
playing tailback instead of fullback. "If
you call what I'm playing a fullback,
then's it's my best position. I like to run
wide."
Francis, a communications major, said
he would like to try his hand at broad
casting. He might even give pro football a
shot, but he said, "It's a long way off."
A 1000-yard season might not be a
long wav off for Francis.

Stanford fullback Phil Francis reaches
for a pass against Washington State

last week. Francis, starting for the in
jured Don Stevenson, ran for 135
yards in the game.
Phil Francis has no illusions.
So what that he gained 137 yards on 28
carries last week.
His performance earned him NorCal
Player of the Week honors, but it didn't
earn him a starting spot in the Card
backfield.
"I don't expect to be starting," said
Francis. "I was just filling in for Donny
Stevenson. He's been doing a heck of a
job for us. I don't feel like I've won myself
a starting job."
But he certainly won last Saturday's
contest against Washington State for
Stanford. Francis carried the entire Card
offensive load in the 22-16 victory over
the Cougars.
Crucial situations
Francis converted two crucial third
down situations during Stanford's six
and one-half minute game-winning
drive. He gained 30 of his yards on the
drive.
"I don't think I lost a yard the entire
game," said Francis. "I attribute that to
the line. When you're in the huddle it's
nice to see (offensive tackle) Gordy
King."
Going into last Saturday's game, Fran
cis had gained 100 yards on just 22 car
ries. His performance certainly helped
bolster his confidence. The sophomore
admits it wasn't too high after fumbling
against Michigan on his first rushing at
tempt of the year.
'Turning point'
"Before the Washington game, I wasn't
really sure of myself," said Francis. "It
was the turning point. Before that 1 was
just going into games not wanting to
make mistakes. I was gun shy."
Card coach Jack Christiansen com
pares the sophomore from Beaverton,
Ore., to ex-Stanford running back Scott
Laidlaw, now with the Dallas Cowboys.
"Both Phil and Laidlaw are a lot alike in
the way they move," said Christiansen.
"But I think Phil gets to the line of
scrimmage a little quicker than Laid
law."
Christiansen speculated that Francis
runs well on artificial surfaces, such as
WSU's Martin Stadium, because he's
flat-footed.
'Bad suggestion'
"I think it's a bad suggestion," said
Francis. "I don't like astroturf. I bruised
my elbows on it." He played his entire

prep career on artificial surfaces. "That
was one of the reasons I decided to come
here, besides the weather."

shot, but he said, "It's a long way off."
A 1000-yard season might not be a
long wav off for Francis.

Stanford fullback Phil Francis reaches
for a pass against Washington State

last week. Francis, starting for the in
jured Don Stevenson, ran for 135
yards in the game.
Phil Francis has no illusions.
So what that he gained 137 yards on 28
carries last week.
His performance earned him NorCal
Player of the Week honors, but it didn't
earn him a starting spot in the Card
backfield.
"I don't expect to be starting," said
Francis. "I was just filling in for Donny
Stevenson. He's been doing a heck of a
job for us. I don't feel like I've won myself
a starting job."
But he certainly won last Saturday's
contest against Washington State for
Stanford. Francis carried the entire Card
offensive load in the 22-16 victory over
the Cougars.
Crucial situations
Francis converted two crucial third
down situations during Stanford's six
and one-half minute game-winning
drive. He gained 30 of his yards on the
drive.
"I don't think I lost a yard the entire
game," said Francis. "I attribute that to
the line. When you're in the huddle it's
nice to see (offensive tackle) Gordy
King."
Going into last Saturday's game, Fran
cis had gained 100 yards on just 22 car
ries. His performance certainly helped
bolster his confidence. The sophomore
admits it wasn't too high after fumbling
against Michigan on his first rushing at
tempt of the year.
'Turning point'
"Before the Washington game, I wasn't
really sure of myself," said Francis. "It
was the turning point. Before that 1 was
just going into games not wanting to
make mistakes. I was gun shy."
Card coach Jack Christiansen com
pares the sophomore from Beaverton,
Ore., to ex-Stanford running back Scott
Laidlaw, now with the Dallas Cowboys.
"Both Phil and Laidlaw are a lot alike in
the way they move," said Christiansen.
"But I think Phil gets to the line of
scrimmage a little quicker than Laid
law."
Christiansen speculated that Francis
runs well on artificial surfaces, such as
WSU's Martin Stadium, because he's
flat-footed.
'Bad suggestion'
"I think it's a bad suggestion," said
Francis. "I don't like astroturf. I bruised
my elbows on it." He played his entire

prep career on artificial surfaces. "That
was one of the reasons I decided to come
here, besides the weather."
Francis is one of seven Oregonians on
the Stanford roster. When former UCLA
basketball star Richard Washington was
being recruited by the Bruins, former
Oregon Governor Tom McCall said that
"losing Oregon athletes is like losing
natural resources."
"I don't think there's any real animos
ity," Francis said. "Oregon does lose a lot
of players to out-of-state schools. I've
read where they talk about how we can't
get excited for the northern schools. For
Oregon State, I'll be as ready as for any
game. My folks will be coming to this
game. They were also at WSU last week."
Considered OSU
If Francis hadn't decided to come to
the Farm, he might be wearing the
orange and black of Oregon State. "It
came down to Colorado and Oregon
State," said Francis. "If I didn't get ac
cepted at Stanford I probably would have
gone to Oregon State."
Francis gained over 1000 yards as a
high school junior, to lead Beaverton to
the state title. But his squad ran into
Larry Reynolds' Corvallis squad in the
first playoff game during his senior year.
"Stanford doesn't get a lot of quality
running backs," said Francis. "You don't
get many O.J. Simpsons coming here."
But you certainly get a lot of aspiring
Jim Plunketts.
Starting lineup
Some fans have suggested that Francis
should be moved from the fullback posi
tion to get him into the starting lineup
with Stevenson. "I'm not really that
(tailback) type. There are a lot of different
assignments to learn. It's taken me a year
and a half to learn the assignments.
"Ron Inge is a heck of a good blocker.
He almost never makes a mistake. Don
ny's doing a heck of a job. We play a pro
offense and it takes a lot of experience."
Last week Francis looked like he was
playing tailback instead of fullback. "If
you call what I'm playing a fullback,
then's it's my best position. I like to run
wide."
Francis, a communications major, said
he would like to try his hand at broad
casting. He might even give pro football a
shot, but he said, "It's a long way off."
