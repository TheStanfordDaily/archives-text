# Basketball opener near
## 
### Chris Baker 
It's hard to believe, but Stan
ford's basketball season opener
is only 20 days away. The Cards
begin phase two of the "New
Era" Nov. 18, when they host the
Republic of China in an interna
tional basketball exhibition.
Stanford second-year coach
Dick Dißiaso, voted Pacific-8
co-Coach of the Year last season,
guided the Cards to a 9-18 mark
in 1975.
But 11 of the defeats, includ
ing a 68-67 loss to UCLA in
Pauley Pavilion, came by six
points or less.
'Must stay healthy'
"This year we're hoping to
win our share of the close ones,"
said Dißiaso yesterday at the
Stanford basketball press clinic.

"If we can stay healthy, we have
a good chance of improving our
record considerably."
The Cards lost forward Ed
Schweitzer, the team's leading
scorer and the leading reboun
der in the Pac-8, to graduation.
Dißiaso will also have to replace
veteran center Tim Patterson.
But the rest of the starters re
turn — senior forward George
Schader, senior guard Mike
Bratz and sophomore guard
Wolfe Perry.
Nucleus
"We're counting on those
three to give us leadership.
They're going to be the nucleus
of our team," said Dißiaso.
The Cards also return their
three top reserves. Junior center
Jeff McHugh (6-foot-8),
swingman Jay Carter (6-4) and
sophomore guard Paul Giovac
chini.
Dißiaso and his assistants,
Bob Frederick and Tom
McLaughlin, also signed three
top recruits. Prep All-American
forward Kimberly Belton (6-7,
225), center Tom Schmalzaried
(6-11, 220) and guard Doug
Barnes (6-1) give Stanford its
best crop of recruits in a long
time.
Potential
"All three of the incoming
freshmen have the potential to
help us," said Dißiaso. "It will
depend on how fast they adjust.
"We hope they learn in Oc

tober and November and in the
pre-season. Hopefully they'll be
ready for the Pac-8."
Dißiaso also added three
walk-ons — junior Anthony
"Ace" Edwards, a 6-5 forward
from San Marino; Daryl Morgan,
a 6-0 guard from El Cerrito; and
Keith Level, a 6-3 guard from
Ventura.
"I'm excited about this year,"
said Dißiaso. "The players have
been working hard in practice."
Two injuries
The Cards have suffered two
injuries since practice began
Oct. 15, but they're not serious.
Schader pulled a hamstring
muscle and Schmalzaried has a
sprained knee.
Stanford opened last season
with a pressing defense, but Di-
Biaso said he plans to drop it be
cause he doesn't have the per
sonnel to employ it.
"We're going to continue to
press, but only at key points,"
said Dißiaso. "We will continue
to fast break again this year.
"We'll try to improve upon an
aggressive man-to-man defense.
We'll probably start going to
multiple defenses," said Di-
Biaso. "We have adapted this
philosophy because we don't
have the depth that some teams
have."

preseason basketball polls,

which tab UCLA to win the
Pac-8. "I have to go with UCLA.
They're the defending champ
ions and have been for an eter
nity," said Dißiaso. "I think
we've laid a good foundation,"
said Dißiaso. "You don't change
attitudes overnight. Last year we
lost 11 games by six or less, this
year we hope to turn those games
around.
"Winning is very important. A
lot of athletes talk about
priorities. We do want to win,
but it's no disgrace to lose."
Dißiaso refused to predict
how many games his Cards will
win. "You're going to win some
and lose some. We haven't set a
number. The team has to build to
the point where you can deter
mine your own fate."

we've laid a good foundation,"

attitudes overnight. Last year we
lost 11 games by six or less, this
year we hope to turn those games
around.
"Winning is very important. A

priorities. We do want to win,
but it's no disgrace to lose."
Dißiaso refused to predict
how many games his Cards will

and lose some. We haven't set a
number. The team has to build to
the point where you can deter
mine your own fate."
It's hard to believe, but Stan
ford's basketball season opener
is only 20 days away. The Cards
begin phase two of the "New
Era" Nov. 18, when they host the
Republic of China in an interna
tional basketball exhibition.
Stanford second-year coach
Dick Dißiaso, voted Pacific-8
co-Coach of the Year last season,
guided the Cards to a 9-18 mark
in 1975.
But 11 of the defeats, includ
ing a 68-67 loss to UCLA in
Pauley Pavilion, came by six
points or less.
'Must stay healthy'
"This year we're hoping to
win our share of the close ones,"
said Dißiaso yesterday at the
Stanford basketball press clinic.

"If we can stay healthy, we have
a good chance of improving our
record considerably."
The Cards lost forward Ed
Schweitzer, the team's leading
scorer and the leading reboun
der in the Pac-8, to graduation.
Dißiaso will also have to replace
veteran center Tim Patterson.
But the rest of the starters re
turn — senior forward George
Schader, senior guard Mike
Bratz and sophomore guard
Wolfe Perry.
Nucleus
"We're counting on those
three to give us leadership.
They're going to be the nucleus
of our team," said Dißiaso.
The Cards also return their
three top reserves. Junior center
Jeff McHugh (6-foot-8),
swingman Jay Carter (6-4) and
sophomore guard Paul Giovac
chini.
Dißiaso and his assistants,
Bob Frederick and Tom
McLaughlin, also signed three
top recruits. Prep All-American
forward Kimberly Belton (6-7,
225), center Tom Schmalzaried
(6-11, 220) and guard Doug
Barnes (6-1) give Stanford its
best crop of recruits in a long
time.
Potential
"All three of the incoming
freshmen have the potential to
help us," said Dißiaso. "It will
depend on how fast they adjust.
"We hope they learn in Oc

tober and November and in the
pre-season. Hopefully they'll be
ready for the Pac-8."
Dißiaso also added three
walk-ons — junior Anthony
"Ace" Edwards, a 6-5 forward
from San Marino; Daryl Morgan,
a 6-0 guard from El Cerrito; and
Keith Level, a 6-3 guard from
Ventura.
"I'm excited about this year,"
said Dißiaso. "The players have
been working hard in practice."
Two injuries
The Cards have suffered two
injuries since practice began
Oct. 15, but they're not serious.
Schader pulled a hamstring
muscle and Schmalzaried has a
sprained knee.
Stanford opened last season
with a pressing defense, but Di-
Biaso said he plans to drop it be
cause he doesn't have the per
sonnel to employ it.
"We're going to continue to
press, but only at key points,"
said Dißiaso. "We will continue
to fast break again this year.
"We'll try to improve upon an
aggressive man-to-man defense.
We'll probably start going to
multiple defenses," said Di-
Biaso. "We have adapted this
philosophy because we don't
have the depth that some teams
have."

aggressive man-to-man defense.
We'll probably start going to
multiple defenses," said Di-
Biaso. "We have adapted this
philosophy because we don't
have the depth that some teams
have."

which tab UCLA to win the
Pac-8. "I have to go with UCLA.
They're the defending champ
ions and have been for an eter
nity," said Dißiaso. "I think
we've laid a good foundation,"
said Dißiaso. "You don't change
attitudes overnight. Last year we
lost 11 games by six or less, this
year we hope to turn those games
around.
"Winning is very important. A
lot of athletes talk about
priorities. We do want to win,
but it's no disgrace to lose."
Dißiaso refused to predict
how many games his Cards will
win. "You're going to win some
and lose some. We haven't set a
number. The team has to build to
the point where you can deter
mine your own fate."
It's hard to believe, but Stan
ford's basketball season opener
is only 20 days away. The Cards
begin phase two of the "New
Era" Nov. 18, when they host the
Republic of China in an interna
tional basketball exhibition.
Stanford second-year coach
Dick Dißiaso, voted Pacific-8
co-Coach of the Year last season,
guided the Cards to a 9-18 mark
in 1975.
But 11 of the defeats, includ
ing a 68-67 loss to UCLA in
Pauley Pavilion, came by six
points or less.
'Must stay healthy'
"This year we're hoping to
win our share of the close ones,"
said Dißiaso yesterday at the
Stanford basketball press clinic.

"If we can stay healthy, we have
a good chance of improving our
record considerably."
The Cards lost forward Ed
Schweitzer, the team's leading
scorer and the leading reboun
der in the Pac-8, to graduation.
Dißiaso will also have to replace
veteran center Tim Patterson.
But the rest of the starters re
turn — senior forward George
Schader, senior guard Mike
Bratz and sophomore guard
Wolfe Perry.
Nucleus
"We're counting on those
three to give us leadership.
They're going to be the nucleus
of our team," said Dißiaso.
The Cards also return their
three top reserves. Junior center
Jeff McHugh (6-foot-8),
swingman Jay Carter (6-4) and
sophomore guard Paul Giovac
chini.
Dißiaso and his assistants,
Bob Frederick and Tom
McLaughlin, also signed three
top recruits. Prep All-American
forward Kimberly Belton (6-7,
225), center Tom Schmalzaried
(6-11, 220) and guard Doug
Barnes (6-1) give Stanford its
best crop of recruits in a long
time.
Potential
"All three of the incoming
freshmen have the potential to
help us," said Dißiaso. "It will
depend on how fast they adjust.
"We hope they learn in Oc

tober and November and in the
pre-season. Hopefully they'll be
ready for the Pac-8."
Dißiaso also added three
walk-ons — junior Anthony
"Ace" Edwards, a 6-5 forward
from San Marino; Daryl Morgan,
a 6-0 guard from El Cerrito; and
Keith Level, a 6-3 guard from
Ventura.
"I'm excited about this year,"
said Dißiaso. "The players have
been working hard in practice."
Two injuries
The Cards have suffered two
injuries since practice began
Oct. 15, but they're not serious.
Schader pulled a hamstring
muscle and Schmalzaried has a
sprained knee.
Stanford opened last season
with a pressing defense, but Di-
Biaso said he plans to drop it be
cause he doesn't have the per
sonnel to employ it.
"We're going to continue to
press, but only at key points,"
said Dißiaso. "We will continue
to fast break again this year.
"We'll try to improve upon an
aggressive man-to-man defense.
We'll probably start going to
multiple defenses," said Di-
Biaso. "We have adapted this
philosophy because we don't

have."
