the title "is up for grabs" as the
harriers clash with California
and host UCLA Saturday for the
Pacific-8 Southern Division
Championships in Los Angeles.
Captain Jeff Norton, fresh from
a fourth-place finish in the
Pleasant Hill Invitational, leads
the Stanford running contingent
on its invasion of the Bruins'
demanding 6.2-mile course.
Norton and teammate Frank
Boutin, who sat out last
weekend's competition in prep
aration for tomorrow's race, will
vie with California's Martin
Dean, Gary Blume and Hal

Schultz for the top spot in the
division championships.
UCLA, which is without the
services of standout runner
Bobby Thomas because he did
not re-enroll on the Westwood
campus, is an unknown quan
tity, Clark says.
The Cardinals, if they are to
repeat as the division titlists.
will rely on strong performances
from Jerry Emory, Jeff Parietti,
Wendell Birkhofer, Greg Eger
and Bill Haldeman. Lettermen
Elmory and Parietti have experi
ence on the UCLA course, but
