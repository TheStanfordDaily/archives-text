# Crucial weekend for poloers
## Dorst: goalie with a mental block 
### Chris Kamel 
"It was like throwing at a brick
wall," said a stunned Joe Vargas,
Ail-American candidate for UC
LA's water polo team. What Var
gas was referring to was Stan
ford's goalie Chris Dorst, whose
seven blocks had stopped the
Bruins cold, 11-6, last Friday.
Dorst leads the Cards against
UC-Santa Barbara today at 3:30
p.m. and three-time NCAA
champion California tomorrow
at 11 a.m. But what Vargas

doesn't know is that there is a lot
mot;eto that "brick wall" than he
thinks. Dorst relies on his mind
in order to block shots.
"Youhaveto havean idea how
you are going to play each
team," said Dorst. "For instance,
in UCLA's case, they have an ex
cellent two-meter man in Var
gas, so I have to help stop the ball
when they get it into him."
According to Dorst, he will
have to use the same type of
strategy when the Cards face Cal

tomorrow, except that this time
he will have to watch out for the
Bears' Mike Loughlin.
Need win
The Cards' match against Cal
is a very important one for Stan
ford. Stanford still has to estab
lish that it can beat the Bears
after dropping its initial con
frontation to them in the finals of
the Northern California Aquatics
Tournament.
"This is really a big match for
us," Dorst said. "It (water polo)

has become so psychological.
One big win could really screw
them up."
Dorst hopes that things will be
different from the first
Stanford-Cal matchup.
"We'll need more offense this
game," said Dorst. "Our defense
last week was good and 1 hope
we can keep it up."
Dorst sharp
What head coach Art Lambert
hopes can be maintained is
Dorst's fine performance of the
past IJCLA and Long Beach State
games. In those two consecutive
games, Dorst deflected six pen
alty throws while making many
key steals when the ball went
into the pit.
"In trying to block penalty
shots, 1 just try to mix it up," he
said. "It really gives me an ad
vantage. Otherwise, all 1 try to do
is get my body out of the water as
far as I can to try and block a
shot."
According to Lambert, Dorst
and the team as well, the crowd
which attended the Stanford-
UCLA game a week ago made the
difference in the outcome.
"They (the crowd) really won
it for us," said sophomore var
sity poloer Rob Arnold. "They
were really great."
And the crowd will have to be
good this weekend because this
game is a "must win" situation
for the Bears as well.
"Cal played UCLA and lost,
12-6," Dorst said. "The thing
was that they were really mad
from that match and won't let us
run away from them."
UCSB first
First things first, however. The
Cards have to play UCSB today
at deCuerre and the Cauchos are
no team to be taken lightly.
"They are really upset
minded," Lambert said. "They
are a fine team and can't be
counted out at all."
In a pre-weekend tune-up),
Stanford whitewashed the San
Jose State Spartans, 18-8, yester
day at West Valley College.
