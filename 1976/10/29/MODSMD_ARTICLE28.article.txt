Booters face Spartans
Stanford soccer coach Nelson Lodge and his
crew spent yesterday preparing to face San Jose
State, presently ranked No. 1 on the West Coast
and ninth on the national charts, today at 3 p.m. at
Harry Maloney Field. The Spartans are currently
9-2 on the season, which includes an earlier 4-0
thrashing of the Cardinals in the Bi-Centennial
Tourney at San Jose.
The Spartans are led by Easy Perez, a junior who
topped the entire nation last year in scoring with
21 markers. He has 15 goals to date. Stanford will
counter with Bobby Ceiger who also has 15 goals
this season.
San Jose, coached by former United States
Olympic soccer coach, Julie Menendez, has annu
ally been edged out of a NCAA finals berth by San
Francisco or UCLA. This year may be the year of
the Spartan as San Jose continues to roll up big
victories. This afternoon, Ceiger and company
will try to play giant-killers once again, having
brought down mighty San Francisco a few
notches last Saturday with a 4-4 tie.
"Against San Jose, we'll play pretty much the
same way as we did against USF," Lodge said.
"We'll try to force thern out of their pattern and
take advantage of any mistakes or lapses they
have. If we try to play their game, we won't have a
chance. Hut these boys have character, and they
are going to give San Jose a game.
"We're not the same team they (San Jose) faced
earlier this season, and they know it. We surprised
USF. We'll surprise San Jose."
Indeed, the Cardinals have the potential to
upset anyone. Stanford's record stands at 5-7-1.
The Cardinals played two exhibition games ear
lier this week, losing to San Diego State, 2-1, in a
rather miserable game Monday, and defeating a

useless San Francisco State side 11 -0 Wednesday.
Playing without the services of Jim Melamed
who was injured against USF, the Cards had a
total lack of mid-field play against San Diego
State.
The only highlight of the rather boring San
Francisco State match was Bobby Geiger's six
goal performance. The 11 goals was Stanford's
highest output of the season.

this season.
San Jose, coached by former United States
Olympic soccer coach, Julie Menendez, has annu
ally been edged out of a NCAA finals berth by San
Francisco or UCLA. This year may be the year of
the Spartan as San Jose continues to roll up big
victories. This afternoon, Ceiger and company
will try to play giant-killers once again, having
brought down mighty San Francisco a few
notches last Saturday with a 4-4 tie.
"Against San Jose, we'll play pretty much the
same way as we did against USF," Lodge said.
"We'll try to force thern out of their pattern and
take advantage of any mistakes or lapses they
have. If we try to play their game, we won't have a
chance. Hut these boys have character, and they
are going to give San Jose a game.
"We're not the same team they (San Jose) faced
earlier this season, and they know it. We surprised
USF. We'll surprise San Jose."
Indeed, the Cardinals have the potential to
upset anyone. Stanford's record stands at 5-7-1.
The Cardinals played two exhibition games ear
lier this week, losing to San Diego State, 2-1, in a
rather miserable game Monday, and defeating a

useless San Francisco State side 11 -0 Wednesday.
Playing without the services of Jim Melamed
who was injured against USF, the Cards had a
total lack of mid-field play against San Diego
State.
The only highlight of the rather boring San
Francisco State match was Bobby Geiger's six
goal performance. The 11 goals was Stanford's
highest output of the season.
