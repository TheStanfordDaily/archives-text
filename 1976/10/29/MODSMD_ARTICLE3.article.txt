## Marijuana produces varying effects 
### Bill Snyder 
Marijuana, unlike alcohol, is an "ex
traordinarily complicated drug in
terms of the effects it produces and in
terms of how the body handles it" said
Leo Hollister, professor of psychiatry
and medicine at the Medical School.
Hollister, who conducts marijuana
research at the Veteran's Administra
tion Hospital in Palo Alto, emphasized
that every drug has more than one ef
fect. Delta-9 tetrahydrocannibol
(THC), one of the psychoactive com
ponents of marijuana, affects neuronal
processes of memory and perception
in the brain, but it also affects the heart,
neuronal control of the skeletal mus
cles, and the endocrinal, genetic, and
immunological systems.
Recent studies indicate that
marijuana may be effective in reducing
the buildup of fluids within the
eyeball which causes glaucoma.
Marijuana has also demonstrated an
ability to control vomiting and nausea
which are frequent side effects of some
kinds of cancer chemotherapy.
On the other hand, some researchers

indicate that marijuana may cause
structural damage to individual cells
throughout the body. They have re
ported interference with the immunity
process, an increase in the number of
cells with broken chromosomes, and
pre-malignant lesions in lung tissues
in subjects who have used marijuana.
Difficult to study
The effects of marijuana on behavior
are difficult to study because behavior
is influenced by many variables not
related to the action of the drug.
Marijuana experiments are compli
cated by the differences between sub
jects in terms of age, personality, cul
tural conditioning, and previous drug
usage.
Certain distinct behavioral effects
do occur, but, said Hollister, "I'm
never sure whether they occur because
of marijuana, or marijuana occurs be
cause of them." The decision to smoke
marijuana may reflect a conscious de
cision to alter one's lifestyle, he said.
Nevertheless, "It's a very powerful
drug that has a clearly defined core of
manifestations", Hollister said. Large

doses will cause in most people an in
creased heart rate, reddening of the
inner eyelid, tremor of the limbs and
unsteadiness, and dryness of the muc
ous membranes.
In addition, marijuana will affect
perception. Time will seem to pass
more slowly. The user will have diffi
culty in maintaining attention and in
completing his thoughts. He will lose
some short term memory, Hollister
said.
Memory
"Marijuana has an affect on the stor
age of memory (short term) as opposed
to retrieval (long term)", said Jared
Tinklenberg, assistant professor of
psychiatry at the Medical School, who
also conducts marijuana research at
the V.A. Hospital.
He added that the precise physiolog
ical mechanism is unknown and it is
unclear if the effects which marijuana
has on perception are related to its ef
fects on memory.
In addition, few conclusions can be
drawn from any memory research.
"Memory research is in terrible
shape," said Hollister. "The short
term—long term division is conve
nient but a gross oversimplification."
Most of the techniques for studying
memory are confounded by the simul
taneous measurement of attention and
motivation. "Results tend to be so con
tradictory as to be almost meaning
less," he said.
Most of the effects caused by
marijuana seem to be transient and re
versible. Hardin Jones, professor of
medical physics and physiology at
University of California, Berkeley, in
dicates that full recovery from pro
longed and heavy marijuana use may
require as long as three years.
Jones observed that college students
who gave up marijuana regained nor
mal memory, cleared thinking and the
return of interest in themselves and
their surroundings.
Improvement
Jones said in a recent article in Pri
vate Practice, magazine, "In three
cases of students who were heavily af
fected. but not incapacitated,...im
provement was evident in a few
months. These young men probably
gained full recovery and lost all signs
of suppressed mental functions." He
added that he feels full recovery takes
three years.
Jones feels that the extended recov
ery time reflected an accumulation of

THC by the body, and that it continued
to exert its effects until it was com
pletely broken down and removed.
"It's the accumulation that's responsi
ble for the disagreeable cytotoxic ef
fects and the effects on the central
nervous system," he said.
Other researchers have found evi
dence of THC accumulation. It is lipid
soluble, which means it dissolves in
oil and fats more easily than it dissol
ves in water. As a result, it tends to be
deposited in fatty tissues throughout
the body, including the brain.
"We've been able to find after a
single dosage, metabolites (break
down products) coming out of people
for as long as a week later," said Hollis
ter.
In general, as long as a drug is main
tained in the body in an active form, it
will continue to exert its effects.
Because marijuana is lipid
soluble, it does not dissolve in
the blood readily, and probably
can not reach toxic concentra
tions.
"So far as I know, no one has
ever died of an overdose of
said Hollister. Alcohol,
on the other hand, becomes le
thal when it reaches a concentra
tion of 500-600 milligrams per
100 milliliters of blood.
Permanent affects
A prominent question in the
controversy over the de
criminalization or legalization of
marijuana as a social drug is
whether it has any permanent ef
fects on the brain. Like other
questions in marijuana research,
it is difficult to answer.
For one thing, it is very dif
ficult to find subjects with a long
history of marijuana use who
haven't used other drugs. In ad
dition, there are few tests which
can detect brain damage accu
rately.
Experimenters have found ab
normalities in the electroence
phalograms (EEC), measures of
brain waves, obtained from sub
jects during THC use. However,
abnormal EEC tracings are fre
quently found associated with
diseased brain tissue, and they
can be influenced by other
psychological and physical fac
tors such as emotion, sex, and
age.
Another study employed air
encephalography, in which air
is injected into the brain cavities.
Results indicated that the brains
of heavy and long term human
users were physically atrophied
compared to the brains of
nonusers. But the subjects also
had used other drugs, including
amphetamines and LSD.
Tolerance
Heavy use of marijuana can
lead to tolerance, in which some
of the physical and psychologi
cal abnormalities caused by the
drug are partially restored. "To
lerance to THC has been very
readily induced in almost every
animal species in which it has

been tested," said Hollister.
Tolerance in some drugs is re
lated to their addictive proper
ties. Although physical depen
dence on marijuana has been ob
served only infrequently. Hollis
ter admits that there may be
"cannabinolics".
The marijuana controversy re
sults in part from the drug's
complexity of actions, and the
inadequacies of science which

seeks to understand those ac
tions. Hollister believes that con
tinued marijuana research will
eventually describe a drug
which is neither as dangerous as
its opponents claim, nor as safe
as its supporters say it is.
"Cannabis, just like any other
social drug, is going to exert a
toll," said Hollister. "There will
inevitably be casualties...But
which do you blame, the drug or
the user?"

creased heart rate, reddening of the
inner eyelid, tremor of the limbs and
unsteadiness, and dryness of the muc
ous membranes.
In addition, marijuana will affect
perception. Time will seem to pass
more slowly. The user will have diffi
culty in maintaining attention and in
completing his thoughts. He will lose
some short term memory, Hollister
said.
Memory
"Marijuana has an affect on the stor
age of memory (short term) as opposed
to retrieval (long term)", said Jared
Tinklenberg, assistant professor of
psychiatry at the Medical School, who
also conducts marijuana research at
the V.A. Hospital.
He added that the precise physiolog
ical mechanism is unknown and it is
unclear if the effects which marijuana
has on perception are related to its ef
fects on memory.
In addition, few conclusions can be
drawn from any memory research.
"Memory research is in terrible
shape," said Hollister. "The short
term—long term division is conve
nient but a gross oversimplification."
Most of the techniques for studying
memory are confounded by the simul
taneous measurement of attention and
motivation. "Results tend to be so con
tradictory as to be almost meaning
less," he said.
Most of the effects caused by
marijuana seem to be transient and re
versible. Hardin Jones, professor of
medical physics and physiology at
University of California, Berkeley, in
dicates that full recovery from pro
longed and heavy marijuana use may
require as long as three years.
Jones observed that college students
who gave up marijuana regained nor
mal memory, cleared thinking and the
return of interest in themselves and
their surroundings.
Improvement
Jones said in a recent article in Pri
vate Practice, magazine, "In three
cases of students who were heavily af
fected. but not incapacitated,...im
provement was evident in a few
months. These young men probably
gained full recovery and lost all signs
of suppressed mental functions." He
added that he feels full recovery takes
three years.
Jones feels that the extended recov
ery time reflected an accumulation of

THC by the body, and that it continued
to exert its effects until it was com
pletely broken down and removed.
"It's the accumulation that's responsi
ble for the disagreeable cytotoxic ef
fects and the effects on the central
nervous system," he said.
Other researchers have found evi
dence of THC accumulation. It is lipid
soluble, which means it dissolves in
oil and fats more easily than it dissol
ves in water. As a result, it tends to be
deposited in fatty tissues throughout
the body, including the brain.
"We've been able to find after a
single dosage, metabolites (break
down products) coming out of people
for as long as a week later," said Hollis
ter.
In general, as long as a drug is main
tained in the body in an active form, it
will continue to exert its effects.
Because marijuana is lipid
soluble, it does not dissolve in
the blood readily, and probably
can not reach toxic concentra
tions.
"So far as I know, no one has
ever died of an overdose of
said Hollister. Alcohol,
on the other hand, becomes le
thal when it reaches a concentra
tion of 500-600 milligrams per
100 milliliters of blood.
Permanent affects
A prominent question in the
controversy over the de
criminalization or legalization of
marijuana as a social drug is
whether it has any permanent ef
fects on the brain. Like other
questions in marijuana research,
it is difficult to answer.
For one thing, it is very dif
ficult to find subjects with a long
history of marijuana use who
haven't used other drugs. In ad
dition, there are few tests which
can detect brain damage accu
rately.
Experimenters have found ab
normalities in the electroence
phalograms (EEC), measures of
brain waves, obtained from sub
jects during THC use. However,
abnormal EEC tracings are fre
quently found associated with
diseased brain tissue, and they
can be influenced by other
psychological and physical fac
tors such as emotion, sex, and
age.
Another study employed air
encephalography, in which air
is injected into the brain cavities.
Results indicated that the brains
of heavy and long term human
users were physically atrophied
compared to the brains of
nonusers. But the subjects also
had used other drugs, including
amphetamines and LSD.
Tolerance
Heavy use of marijuana can
lead to tolerance, in which some
of the physical and psychologi
cal abnormalities caused by the
drug are partially restored. "To
lerance to THC has been very
readily induced in almost every
animal species in which it has

been tested," said Hollister.
Tolerance in some drugs is re
lated to their addictive proper
ties. Although physical depen
dence on marijuana has been ob
served only infrequently. Hollis
ter admits that there may be
"cannabinolics".
The marijuana controversy re
sults in part from the drug's
complexity of actions, and the
inadequacies of science which

seeks to understand those ac
tions. Hollister believes that con
tinued marijuana research will
eventually describe a drug
which is neither as dangerous as
its opponents claim, nor as safe
as its supporters say it is.
"Cannabis, just like any other
social drug, is going to exert a
toll," said Hollister. "There will
inevitably be casualties...But
which do you blame, the drug or
the user?"
Marijuana, unlike alcohol, is an "ex
traordinarily complicated drug in
terms of the effects it produces and in
terms of how the body handles it" said
Leo Hollister, professor of psychiatry
and medicine at the Medical School.
Hollister, who conducts marijuana
research at the Veteran's Administra
tion Hospital in Palo Alto, emphasized
that every drug has more than one ef
fect. Delta-9 tetrahydrocannibol
(THC), one of the psychoactive com
ponents of marijuana, affects neuronal
processes of memory and perception
in the brain, but it also affects the heart,
neuronal control of the skeletal mus
cles, and the endocrinal, genetic, and
immunological systems.
Recent studies indicate that
marijuana may be effective in reducing
the buildup of fluids within the
eyeball which causes glaucoma.
Marijuana has also demonstrated an
ability to control vomiting and nausea
which are frequent side effects of some
kinds of cancer chemotherapy.
On the other hand, some researchers

indicate that marijuana may cause
structural damage to individual cells
throughout the body. They have re
ported interference with the immunity
process, an increase in the number of
cells with broken chromosomes, and
pre-malignant lesions in lung tissues
in subjects who have used marijuana.
Difficult to study
The effects of marijuana on behavior
are difficult to study because behavior
is influenced by many variables not
related to the action of the drug.
Marijuana experiments are compli
cated by the differences between sub
jects in terms of age, personality, cul
tural conditioning, and previous drug
usage.
Certain distinct behavioral effects
do occur, but, said Hollister, "I'm
never sure whether they occur because
of marijuana, or marijuana occurs be
cause of them." The decision to smoke
marijuana may reflect a conscious de
cision to alter one's lifestyle, he said.
Nevertheless, "It's a very powerful
drug that has a clearly defined core of
manifestations", Hollister said. Large

doses will cause in most people an in
creased heart rate, reddening of the
inner eyelid, tremor of the limbs and
unsteadiness, and dryness of the muc
ous membranes.
In addition, marijuana will affect

added that he feels full recovery takes
three years.
Jones feels that the extended recov
ery time reflected an accumulation of

THC by the body, and that it continued
to exert its effects until it was com
pletely broken down and removed.
"It's the accumulation that's responsi
ble for the disagreeable cytotoxic ef
fects and the effects on the central
nervous system," he said.
Other researchers have found evi
dence of THC accumulation. It is lipid
soluble, which means it dissolves in
oil and fats more easily than it dissol
ves in water. As a result, it tends to be
deposited in fatty tissues throughout
the body, including the brain.
"We've been able to find after a
single dosage, metabolites (break
down products) coming out of people
for as long as a week later," said Hollis
ter.
In general, as long as a drug is main
tained in the body in an active form, it
will continue to exert its effects.
Because marijuana is lipid
soluble, it does not dissolve in
the blood readily, and probably
can not reach toxic concentra
tions.
"So far as I know, no one has
ever died of an overdose of
said Hollister. Alcohol,
on the other hand, becomes le
thal when it reaches a concentra
tion of 500-600 milligrams per
100 milliliters of blood.
Permanent affects
A prominent question in the
controversy over the de
criminalization or legalization of
marijuana as a social drug is
whether it has any permanent ef
fects on the brain. Like other
questions in marijuana research,
it is difficult to answer.
For one thing, it is very dif
ficult to find subjects with a long
history of marijuana use who
haven't used other drugs. In ad
dition, there are few tests which
can detect brain damage accu
rately.
Experimenters have found ab
normalities in the electroence
phalograms (EEC), measures of
brain waves, obtained from sub
jects during THC use. However,
abnormal EEC tracings are fre
quently found associated with
diseased brain tissue, and they
can be influenced by other
psychological and physical fac
tors such as emotion, sex, and
age.
Another study employed air
encephalography, in which air
is injected into the brain cavities.
Results indicated that the brains
of heavy and long term human
users were physically atrophied
compared to the brains of
nonusers. But the subjects also
had used other drugs, including
amphetamines and LSD.
Tolerance
Heavy use of marijuana can
lead to tolerance, in which some
of the physical and psychologi
cal abnormalities caused by the
drug are partially restored. "To
lerance to THC has been very
readily induced in almost every
animal species in which it has

been tested," said Hollister.
Tolerance in some drugs is re
lated to their addictive proper
ties. Although physical depen
dence on marijuana has been ob
served only infrequently. Hollis
ter admits that there may be
"cannabinolics".
The marijuana controversy re
sults in part from the drug's
complexity of actions, and the
inadequacies of science which

seeks to understand those ac
tions. Hollister believes that con
tinued marijuana research will
eventually describe a drug
which is neither as dangerous as
its opponents claim, nor as safe
as its supporters say it is.
"Cannabis, just like any other
social drug, is going to exert a
toll," said Hollister. "There will
inevitably be casualties...But
which do you blame, the drug or
the user?"
Marijuana, unlike alcohol, is an "ex
traordinarily complicated drug in
terms of the effects it produces and in
terms of how the body handles it" said
Leo Hollister, professor of psychiatry
and medicine at the Medical School.
Hollister, who conducts marijuana
research at the Veteran's Administra
tion Hospital in Palo Alto, emphasized
that every drug has more than one ef
fect. Delta-9 tetrahydrocannibol
(THC), one of the psychoactive com
ponents of marijuana, affects neuronal
processes of memory and perception
in the brain, but it also affects the heart,
neuronal control of the skeletal mus
cles, and the endocrinal, genetic, and
immunological systems.
Recent studies indicate that
marijuana may be effective in reducing
the buildup of fluids within the
eyeball which causes glaucoma.
Marijuana has also demonstrated an
ability to control vomiting and nausea
which are frequent side effects of some
kinds of cancer chemotherapy.
On the other hand, some researchers

indicate that marijuana may cause
structural damage to individual cells
throughout the body. They have re
ported interference with the immunity
process, an increase in the number of
cells with broken chromosomes, and
pre-malignant lesions in lung tissues
in subjects who have used marijuana.
Difficult to study
The effects of marijuana on behavior
are difficult to study because behavior
is influenced by many variables not
related to the action of the drug.
Marijuana experiments are compli
cated by the differences between sub
jects in terms of age, personality, cul
tural conditioning, and previous drug
usage.
Certain distinct behavioral effects
do occur, but, said Hollister, "I'm
never sure whether they occur because
of marijuana, or marijuana occurs be
cause of them." The decision to smoke
marijuana may reflect a conscious de
cision to alter one's lifestyle, he said.
Nevertheless, "It's a very powerful
drug that has a clearly defined core of
manifestations", Hollister said. Large

doses will cause in most people an in
creased heart rate, reddening of the
inner eyelid, tremor of the limbs and
unsteadiness, and dryness of the muc
ous membranes.
In addition, marijuana will affect
perception. Time will seem to pass
more slowly. The user will have diffi
culty in maintaining attention and in
completing his thoughts. He will lose
some short term memory, Hollister
said.
Memory
"Marijuana has an affect on the stor
age of memory (short term) as opposed
to retrieval (long term)", said Jared
Tinklenberg, assistant professor of
psychiatry at the Medical School, who
also conducts marijuana research at
the V.A. Hospital.
He added that the precise physiolog
ical mechanism is unknown and it is
unclear if the effects which marijuana
has on perception are related to its ef
fects on memory.
In addition, few conclusions can be
drawn from any memory research.
"Memory research is in terrible
shape," said Hollister. "The short
term—long term division is conve
nient but a gross oversimplification."
Most of the techniques for studying
memory are confounded by the simul
taneous measurement of attention and
motivation. "Results tend to be so con
tradictory as to be almost meaning
less," he said.
Most of the effects caused by
marijuana seem to be transient and re
versible. Hardin Jones, professor of
medical physics and physiology at
University of California, Berkeley, in
dicates that full recovery from pro
longed and heavy marijuana use may
require as long as three years.
Jones observed that college students
who gave up marijuana regained nor
mal memory, cleared thinking and the
return of interest in themselves and
their surroundings.
Improvement
Jones said in a recent article in Pri
vate Practice, magazine, "In three
cases of students who were heavily af
fected. but not incapacitated,...im
provement was evident in a few
months. These young men probably
gained full recovery and lost all signs
of suppressed mental functions." He
added that he feels full recovery takes
three years.

brain waves, obtained from sub
jects during THC use. However,
abnormal EEC tracings are fre
quently found associated with
diseased brain tissue, and they
can be influenced by other
psychological and physical fac
tors such as emotion, sex, and
age.
Another study employed air
encephalography, in which air
is injected into the brain cavities.
Results indicated that the brains
of heavy and long term human
users were physically atrophied
compared to the brains of
nonusers. But the subjects also
had used other drugs, including
amphetamines and LSD.
Tolerance
Heavy use of marijuana can
lead to tolerance, in which some
of the physical and psychologi
cal abnormalities caused by the
drug are partially restored. "To
lerance to THC has been very
readily induced in almost every
animal species in which it has

been tested," said Hollister.
Tolerance in some drugs is re
lated to their addictive proper
ties. Although physical depen
dence on marijuana has been ob
served only infrequently. Hollis
ter admits that there may be
"cannabinolics".
The marijuana controversy re
sults in part from the drug's
complexity of actions, and the
inadequacies of science which

seeks to understand those ac
tions. Hollister believes that con
tinued marijuana research will
eventually describe a drug
which is neither as dangerous as
its opponents claim, nor as safe
as its supporters say it is.
"Cannabis, just like any other
social drug, is going to exert a
toll," said Hollister. "There will
inevitably be casualties...But
which do you blame, the drug or
the user?"
Marijuana, unlike alcohol, is an "ex
traordinarily complicated drug in
terms of the effects it produces and in
terms of how the body handles it" said
Leo Hollister, professor of psychiatry
and medicine at the Medical School.
Hollister, who conducts marijuana
research at the Veteran's Administra
tion Hospital in Palo Alto, emphasized
that every drug has more than one ef
fect. Delta-9 tetrahydrocannibol
(THC), one of the psychoactive com
ponents of marijuana, affects neuronal
processes of memory and perception
in the brain, but it also affects the heart,
neuronal control of the skeletal mus
cles, and the endocrinal, genetic, and
immunological systems.
Recent studies indicate that
marijuana may be effective in reducing
the buildup of fluids within the
eyeball which causes glaucoma.
Marijuana has also demonstrated an
ability to control vomiting and nausea
which are frequent side effects of some
kinds of cancer chemotherapy.
On the other hand, some researchers

indicate that marijuana may cause
structural damage to individual cells
throughout the body. They have re
ported interference with the immunity
process, an increase in the number of
cells with broken chromosomes, and
pre-malignant lesions in lung tissues
in subjects who have used marijuana.
Difficult to study
The effects of marijuana on behavior
are difficult to study because behavior
is influenced by many variables not
related to the action of the drug.
Marijuana experiments are compli
cated by the differences between sub
jects in terms of age, personality, cul
tural conditioning, and previous drug
usage.
Certain distinct behavioral effects
do occur, but, said Hollister, "I'm
never sure whether they occur because
of marijuana, or marijuana occurs be
cause of them." The decision to smoke
marijuana may reflect a conscious de
cision to alter one's lifestyle, he said.
Nevertheless, "It's a very powerful
drug that has a clearly defined core of
manifestations", Hollister said. Large

doses will cause in most people an in
creased heart rate, reddening of the
inner eyelid, tremor of the limbs and
unsteadiness, and dryness of the muc
ous membranes.
In addition, marijuana will affect
perception. Time will seem to pass
more slowly. The user will have diffi
culty in maintaining attention and in
completing his thoughts. He will lose
some short term memory, Hollister
said.
Memory
"Marijuana has an affect on the stor
age of memory (short term) as opposed
to retrieval (long term)", said Jared
Tinklenberg, assistant professor of
psychiatry at the Medical School, who
also conducts marijuana research at
the V.A. Hospital.
He added that the precise physiolog
ical mechanism is unknown and it is
unclear if the effects which marijuana
has on perception are related to its ef
fects on memory.
In addition, few conclusions can be
drawn from any memory research.
"Memory research is in terrible
shape," said Hollister. "The short
term—long term division is conve
nient but a gross oversimplification."
Most of the techniques for studying
memory are confounded by the simul
taneous measurement of attention and
motivation. "Results tend to be so con
tradictory as to be almost meaning
less," he said.
Most of the effects caused by
marijuana seem to be transient and re
versible. Hardin Jones, professor of
medical physics and physiology at
University of California, Berkeley, in
dicates that full recovery from pro
longed and heavy marijuana use may
require as long as three years.
Jones observed that college students
who gave up marijuana regained nor
mal memory, cleared thinking and the
return of interest in themselves and
their surroundings.
Improvement
Jones said in a recent article in Pri
vate Practice, magazine, "In three
cases of students who were heavily af
fected. but not incapacitated,...im
provement was evident in a few
months. These young men probably
gained full recovery and lost all signs
of suppressed mental functions." He
added that he feels full recovery takes
three years.
Jones feels that the extended recov
ery time reflected an accumulation of

THC by the body, and that it continued
to exert its effects until it was com
pletely broken down and removed.
"It's the accumulation that's responsi
ble for the disagreeable cytotoxic ef
fects and the effects on the central
nervous system," he said.
Other researchers have found evi
dence of THC accumulation. It is lipid
soluble, which means it dissolves in
oil and fats more easily than it dissol
ves in water. As a result, it tends to be
deposited in fatty tissues throughout
the body, including the brain.
"We've been able to find after a
single dosage, metabolites (break
down products) coming out of people
for as long as a week later," said Hollis
ter.
In general, as long as a drug is main
tained in the body in an active form, it
will continue to exert its effects.
Because marijuana is lipid
soluble, it does not dissolve in
the blood readily, and probably
can not reach toxic concentra
tions.
"So far as I know, no one has
ever died of an overdose of
said Hollister. Alcohol,
on the other hand, becomes le
thal when it reaches a concentra
tion of 500-600 milligrams per
100 milliliters of blood.
Permanent affects
A prominent question in the
controversy over the de
criminalization or legalization of
marijuana as a social drug is
whether it has any permanent ef
fects on the brain. Like other
questions in marijuana research,
it is difficult to answer.
For one thing, it is very dif
ficult to find subjects with a long
history of marijuana use who
haven't used other drugs. In ad
dition, there are few tests which
can detect brain damage accu
rately.
Experimenters have found ab
normalities in the electroence
phalograms (EEC), measures of
brain waves, obtained from sub
jects during THC use. However,
abnormal EEC tracings are fre
quently found associated with
