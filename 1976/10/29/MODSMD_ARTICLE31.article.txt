# Women spikers start fast
## Coach foresees national contender in two years 
### Richard Keller Dean Eyre 
Sporting official varsity status for the first
year, an experienced coach and the enthusiasm
of a young team, the Stanford women's vol
leyball squad has already shown it can play
competitively with the best.
Earlier this month, the Card spikers made a
run at UCLA, the defending national champ
ion, before bowing 15-11, 15-13, 15-9.
Most schools in the first year of a sports prog
ram would have to start out from scratch. Not
so at Stanford. Through the sheer brilliance of
the admissions staff and the brains of the
players, the Cardinals were blessed with talent
before they played a match.
Since the team was to have only three return
ing women from last year's club team, the out
look wasn't too rosy for its inaugural season.
Hut from the incoming class of 1980 came three
members of the national championship high
school team from Marlborough in Los Angeles
and from former champion Louisville. All this
was accomplished through the normal admis
sions process. There was no recruiting.
'Building period'
"We area young, naive team," stressed assis
tant coach Jim Johnson. "This year is going to
be a building period. We have to break old
habits and train new ones. Another problem
we have to solve is quickness. We need to get a
faster, more disciplined offense and defense,"
observed Johnson.
The team consists of junior Shawn Hoover;

sophomores Liz Hughes, Carol Miehause and
Lane Harris; and seven freshmen — Jane Bas
sett, Carrie Casey, Joline Esparza, Claudia
Henrion, Sherry Norman, Dana Padden and
Cindy Whitaker. As Johnson sees it, the two
cogs of the team are Hughes and Hoover.
"Liz and Shawn returned from last year's
team and have helped with experience," he
emphasized. "Liz is very strong in the middle
blocker position and Shawn is ourbest setter."
Top spikers
Johnson considers another returnee,
Miehause, along with Hughes and Bassett the
best spikers on the Stanford squad. "All three
are fairly good hitters," he commented.
Coach optimistic
Head coach Bruce Downing, a volleyball
player in his own right, is very optimistic when
speaking about his spikers in the future tense.
"We should finish one or two this year in
Northern Cal," predicted Downing. "That will
put is in the regionals. but UCLA and USC will
get us there. Next year, we should win North
ern Cal easily. And after that we will be a na
tionally contending team — maybe in the top
three or four in the country, or higher."
In their most recent action, the women de
feated California Tuesday at Berkeley, 15-3,
4-15. 15-10, 9-15, 15-5.
The team hits the road this weekend, playing
at Fresno State tonight and at the University of
the Pacific in Stockton tomorrow.

habits and train new ones. Another problem
we have to solve is quickness. We need to get a
faster, more disciplined offense and defense,"
observed Johnson.
The team consists of junior Shawn Hoover;

sophomores Liz Hughes, Carol Miehause and
Lane Harris; and seven freshmen — Jane Bas
sett, Carrie Casey, Joline Esparza, Claudia
Henrion, Sherry Norman, Dana Padden and
Cindy Whitaker. As Johnson sees it, the two
cogs of the team are Hughes and Hoover.
"Liz and Shawn returned from last year's
team and have helped with experience," he
emphasized. "Liz is very strong in the middle
blocker position and Shawn is ourbest setter."
Top spikers
Johnson considers another returnee,
Miehause, along with Hughes and Bassett the
best spikers on the Stanford squad. "All three
are fairly good hitters," he commented.
Coach optimistic
Head coach Bruce Downing, a volleyball
player in his own right, is very optimistic when
speaking about his spikers in the future tense.
"We should finish one or two this year in
Northern Cal," predicted Downing. "That will
put is in the regionals. but UCLA and USC will
get us there. Next year, we should win North
ern Cal easily. And after that we will be a na
tionally contending team — maybe in the top
three or four in the country, or higher."
In their most recent action, the women de
feated California Tuesday at Berkeley, 15-3,
4-15. 15-10, 9-15, 15-5.
The team hits the road this weekend, playing
at Fresno State tonight and at the University of
the Pacific in Stockton tomorrow.

The women's volleyball team is shown here in action against UC-Davis. Carol Meihaus (6)
and Sherry Norman (12) are at the net for Stanford.
Sporting official varsity status for the first
year, an experienced coach and the enthusiasm
of a young team, the Stanford women's vol
leyball squad has already shown it can play
competitively with the best.
Earlier this month, the Card spikers made a
run at UCLA, the defending national champ
ion, before bowing 15-11, 15-13, 15-9.
Most schools in the first year of a sports prog
ram would have to start out from scratch. Not
so at Stanford. Through the sheer brilliance of
the admissions staff and the brains of the
players, the Cardinals were blessed with talent
before they played a match.
Since the team was to have only three return
ing women from last year's club team, the out
look wasn't too rosy for its inaugural season.
Hut from the incoming class of 1980 came three
members of the national championship high
school team from Marlborough in Los Angeles
and from former champion Louisville. All this
was accomplished through the normal admis
sions process. There was no recruiting.
'Building period'
"We area young, naive team," stressed assis
tant coach Jim Johnson. "This year is going to
be a building period. We have to break old
habits and train new ones. Another problem
we have to solve is quickness. We need to get a
faster, more disciplined offense and defense,"
observed Johnson.

sophomores Liz Hughes, Carol Miehause and
Lane Harris; and seven freshmen — Jane Bas
