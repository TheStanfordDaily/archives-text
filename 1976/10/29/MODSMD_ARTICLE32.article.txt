Brown harangues oil companies
l.os Angeles — Cov. Edmund Brown Jr. accused
major oil companies yesterday of conducting a cal
culated campaign against Prop. 14, the farm labor
initiative in order to distract the Legislature from
getting on to other business.
"This is a political issue," Brown told a news
conference at the Los Angeles Press Club. "It's a
chance for certain people to keep the Legislature in
turmoil."
He warned that defeat of the initiative would
begin another series of long battles over farm labor
laws and would prevent action on such issues as
property tax relief.
"I was personally involved in the farm labor
question," said Brown. "I know the hundreds of
hours it took. Prop. 14 will give us the peace and
stability we need to get onto other issues."
Brown said that major oil companies have con
trolling interests in the giant farms of California
and stand to benefit by preventing secret elections
in which farm laborers decide which union they
want to represent them.
Rhodesian meeting has shaky start
Geneva. Switzerland — Leaders of Rhodesia's
blacks and whites began their conference yesterday
on the African country's future in an atmosphere of
pessimism, bitterness and suspicion.
The historic meeting at the Palais des Nations
brought white Prime Minister lan Smith face to face
with four nationalist leaders vying to succeed him.
Britain told the delayed opening session all five
Rhodesian delegations must have the shared aim of
black majority rule within two years.
Delay and demonstration marked the start of the
talks that came about largely through the initiative
of U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and his
mission through Africa last month.
Black Rhodesians were divided against other
blacks, white Britons against their Rhodesian
cousins.
Aim of the talks is to arrange peaceful transition
to black rule in the breakaway British colony in
southern Africa where blacks outnumber the ruling
whites by 6.4 million to 278,000.
Richard said the aim of the conference is majority
rule within two years.
Richard told reporters during the day that "seri
ous problems" could arise next week. One relates to
a definition of majority rule. To the blacks it means
one man-one vote, while to Smith's group it means
rule by a majority of electors qualified by education
and property to vote.
A major conflict is over the makeup of an interim
government. Smith says he agreed with Kissinger
on a package that provided for white control of
police and the military during the transition
period. Nationalist leaders now say black control
must come at once.
Worldwide population growth slows
United Nations — Falling birth rates and unfore
seen deaths from hunger have slowed global popu
lation growth to the point where a doubling of
world population by the year 2000 is no longer
anticipated, according to the Worldwatch Research
Institute.
Paced by two of the world's four most populous

countries, China and the United States, population
growth has decreased in rich and poor countries
alike, reversing for the first time in history a trend of
gradually accelerating growth, the Worldwatch
study adds.
Cited among contributing factors for the U.S. de
cline are new social trends, including an unantici
jwted drop in the marriage rate, steady growth in
female employment and a sharp increase in female
enrollment in graduate and professional schools.
I)r. Brown says China's performance should
come as no surprise: the comprehensive Chinese
effort focuses not only on increasing family plan
ning services, including abortion, but also on re
shaping economic and social policies to encourage
small families, and on an intensive public educa
tion campaign extolling the benefits of smaller
families.
The few countries that still have rising birth rates
are mostly in Eastern Europe where the govern
ments recently adopted policies encouraging
births, and reversed the long-standing decline in
population growth.
IRA political leader slain
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Three youths assas
sinated IRA political organizer Maire Drumm last
night in a hospital ward, police reported.
They said the youths burst into Ward 3 of the
Mater Hospital in Belfast and shot Drumm as she
lay in bed.
Drumm, 56, was vice president and principal
political organizer for the Provisional Sinn Fein,
the legal political arm of the outlawed Irish Repub
lican Army's Provisional wing.
The Provisional IRA is a mainly Roman Catholic
movement fighting to drive the British from North
ern Ireland and unite the province with the Irish
republic.
Ehrlichman goes to prison
Safford, Ariz. — John Ehrlichman suddenly
became a federal prisoner yesterday by walking
into the Swift Trail federal work camp as soon as he
learned that two judges in Washington had granted
his request to begin serving his Watergate sen
tences.
By not waiting for Supreme Court review of his
convictions, Ehrlichman became the first of the
three convicted men closest to Richard Nixon —
and the highest ranking member of the Nixon ad
ministration to date — to be imprisoned.
His lawyer said he will continue to fight for re
versal of Ehrlichman's two Watergate convictions
in the high court.
Unless the prison time is reduced later through
application to the sentencing judges, Ehrlichman
must serve a minimum of 2.5 years before he be
comes eligible for parole.
Volcano expert loses position
Paris — Haroun Tazieff, one of the world's lead
ing authorities on volcanos, has been fired from his
post as head of a study institute after a dispute over
a Caribbean volcano that was supposed to explode
like an atomic bomb last summer — but never did.
Claude Allegre, director of the Clobal Physics
Institute, a branch of Paris University, said Thurs
day he had dismissed Tazieff as head of the insti
tute's volcanology service.

About 70,000 people were evacuated from an
area around the volcano Aug. 17 after scientists
said that La Soufriere's eruption was inevitable.
They predicted that it could have the force of sev
eral atomic bombs and posed the danger of "mon
strous" and "catastrophic" damage.
Tazieff told a reporter that he believes his dismis
sal was a "personal settling of scores."
'Psychic' canine picks Ford
Los Angeles — A political pup with a nose for
Tuesday's presidential election is predicting that
Gerald Ford will win the contest, even though the
canine prefers Jimmy Carter.
Taco Lipps. while hardly a name befitting a seri
ous political analyst, has a strong record for gues
sing correct answers to a variety of multiple choice
questions even though the dog thinks it's a bird.
Taco's owner, Frieda Lipps of suburban Canoga
Park, says Taco scores about 90 per cent correct on
mathematical multiple choice quizzes and can do
addition, multiplication, subtraction, division and
square roots.
But when it comes to choosing which kind of
animal he is, Taco inevitably chooses the answer
marked "bird."
Nevertheless. Taco was asked whether he would
predict a winner for Tuesday's presidential elec
tion.
"Taco," Mrs. Lipps said instructively, "we have
two men running for the Presidency. Now 1 want
you to tell me which one you like best."
"Krrowf rrrowf," said Taco, apparently referring
to Carter, choice No. 2.
"Who do you think will win?" asked Mrs. Lipps.
"Rrrowf," Taco said firmly.
Mrs. Lipps took Taco to the University of Califor
nia, Los Angeles Neuropsychology Institute where
parapsychologist Dr. Thelma Moss examined the
dog and ran a few brief experiments.
Dr. Moss said she found the canine's perfor
mance "impressive" and would like to perform
more experiments with the animal.
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday except low clouds and
patchy fog along the coast extending locally inland
nights and mornings. Slightly cooler. Lows in mid
40s to low 50s. Highs in mid 60s to mid 70s.

of U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and his
mission through Africa last month.
Black Rhodesians were divided against other
blacks, white Britons against their Rhodesian
cousins.
Aim of the talks is to arrange peaceful transition
to black rule in the breakaway British colony in
southern Africa where blacks outnumber the ruling
whites by 6.4 million to 278,000.
Richard said the aim of the conference is majority
rule within two years.
Richard told reporters during the day that "seri
ous problems" could arise next week. One relates to
a definition of majority rule. To the blacks it means
one man-one vote, while to Smith's group it means
rule by a majority of electors qualified by education
and property to vote.
A major conflict is over the makeup of an interim
government. Smith says he agreed with Kissinger
on a package that provided for white control of
police and the military during the transition
period. Nationalist leaders now say black control
must come at once.
Worldwide population growth slows
United Nations — Falling birth rates and unfore
seen deaths from hunger have slowed global popu
lation growth to the point where a doubling of
world population by the year 2000 is no longer
anticipated, according to the Worldwatch Research
Institute.
Paced by two of the world's four most populous

countries, China and the United States, population
growth has decreased in rich and poor countries
alike, reversing for the first time in history a trend of
gradually accelerating growth, the Worldwatch
study adds.
Cited among contributing factors for the U.S. de
cline are new social trends, including an unantici
jwted drop in the marriage rate, steady growth in
female employment and a sharp increase in female
enrollment in graduate and professional schools.
I)r. Brown says China's performance should
come as no surprise: the comprehensive Chinese
effort focuses not only on increasing family plan
ning services, including abortion, but also on re
shaping economic and social policies to encourage
small families, and on an intensive public educa
tion campaign extolling the benefits of smaller
families.
The few countries that still have rising birth rates
are mostly in Eastern Europe where the govern
ments recently adopted policies encouraging
births, and reversed the long-standing decline in
population growth.
IRA political leader slain
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Three youths assas
sinated IRA political organizer Maire Drumm last
night in a hospital ward, police reported.
They said the youths burst into Ward 3 of the
Mater Hospital in Belfast and shot Drumm as she
lay in bed.
Drumm, 56, was vice president and principal
political organizer for the Provisional Sinn Fein,
the legal political arm of the outlawed Irish Repub
lican Army's Provisional wing.
The Provisional IRA is a mainly Roman Catholic
movement fighting to drive the British from North
ern Ireland and unite the province with the Irish
republic.
Ehrlichman goes to prison
Safford, Ariz. — John Ehrlichman suddenly
became a federal prisoner yesterday by walking
into the Swift Trail federal work camp as soon as he
learned that two judges in Washington had granted
his request to begin serving his Watergate sen
tences.
By not waiting for Supreme Court review of his
convictions, Ehrlichman became the first of the
three convicted men closest to Richard Nixon —
and the highest ranking member of the Nixon ad
ministration to date — to be imprisoned.
His lawyer said he will continue to fight for re
versal of Ehrlichman's two Watergate convictions
in the high court.
Unless the prison time is reduced later through
application to the sentencing judges, Ehrlichman
must serve a minimum of 2.5 years before he be
comes eligible for parole.
Volcano expert loses position
Paris — Haroun Tazieff, one of the world's lead
ing authorities on volcanos, has been fired from his
post as head of a study institute after a dispute over
a Caribbean volcano that was supposed to explode
like an atomic bomb last summer — but never did.
Claude Allegre, director of the Clobal Physics
Institute, a branch of Paris University, said Thurs
day he had dismissed Tazieff as head of the insti
tute's volcanology service.

About 70,000 people were evacuated from an
area around the volcano Aug. 17 after scientists
said that La Soufriere's eruption was inevitable.
They predicted that it could have the force of sev
eral atomic bombs and posed the danger of "mon
strous" and "catastrophic" damage.
Tazieff told a reporter that he believes his dismis
sal was a "personal settling of scores."
'Psychic' canine picks Ford
Los Angeles — A political pup with a nose for
Tuesday's presidential election is predicting that
Gerald Ford will win the contest, even though the
canine prefers Jimmy Carter.
Taco Lipps. while hardly a name befitting a seri
ous political analyst, has a strong record for gues
sing correct answers to a variety of multiple choice
questions even though the dog thinks it's a bird.
Taco's owner, Frieda Lipps of suburban Canoga
Park, says Taco scores about 90 per cent correct on
mathematical multiple choice quizzes and can do
addition, multiplication, subtraction, division and
square roots.
But when it comes to choosing which kind of
animal he is, Taco inevitably chooses the answer
marked "bird."
Nevertheless. Taco was asked whether he would
predict a winner for Tuesday's presidential elec
tion.
"Taco," Mrs. Lipps said instructively, "we have
two men running for the Presidency. Now 1 want
you to tell me which one you like best."
"Krrowf rrrowf," said Taco, apparently referring
to Carter, choice No. 2.
"Who do you think will win?" asked Mrs. Lipps.
"Rrrowf," Taco said firmly.
Mrs. Lipps took Taco to the University of Califor
nia, Los Angeles Neuropsychology Institute where
parapsychologist Dr. Thelma Moss examined the
dog and ran a few brief experiments.
Dr. Moss said she found the canine's perfor
mance "impressive" and would like to perform
more experiments with the animal.

Brown harangues oil companies
l.os Angeles — Cov. Edmund Brown Jr. accused
major oil companies yesterday of conducting a cal
culated campaign against Prop. 14, the farm labor
initiative in order to distract the Legislature from
getting on to other business.
"This is a political issue," Brown told a news
conference at the Los Angeles Press Club. "It's a
chance for certain people to keep the Legislature in
turmoil."
He warned that defeat of the initiative would
begin another series of long battles over farm labor
laws and would prevent action on such issues as
property tax relief.
"I was personally involved in the farm labor
question," said Brown. "I know the hundreds of
hours it took. Prop. 14 will give us the peace and
stability we need to get onto other issues."
Brown said that major oil companies have con
trolling interests in the giant farms of California
and stand to benefit by preventing secret elections
in which farm laborers decide which union they
want to represent them.
Rhodesian meeting has shaky start
Geneva. Switzerland — Leaders of Rhodesia's
blacks and whites began their conference yesterday
on the African country's future in an atmosphere of
pessimism, bitterness and suspicion.

IRA political leader slain
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Three youths assas
sinated IRA political organizer Maire Drumm last
night in a hospital ward, police reported.
They said the youths burst into Ward 3 of the
Mater Hospital in Belfast and shot Drumm as she
lay in bed.
Drumm, 56, was vice president and principal
political organizer for the Provisional Sinn Fein,
the legal political arm of the outlawed Irish Repub
lican Army's Provisional wing.
The Provisional IRA is a mainly Roman Catholic
movement fighting to drive the British from North
ern Ireland and unite the province with the Irish
republic.
Ehrlichman goes to prison
Safford, Ariz. — John Ehrlichman suddenly
became a federal prisoner yesterday by walking
into the Swift Trail federal work camp as soon as he
learned that two judges in Washington had granted
his request to begin serving his Watergate sen
tences.
By not waiting for Supreme Court review of his
convictions, Ehrlichman became the first of the
three convicted men closest to Richard Nixon —
and the highest ranking member of the Nixon ad
ministration to date — to be imprisoned.
His lawyer said he will continue to fight for re
versal of Ehrlichman's two Watergate convictions
in the high court.
Unless the prison time is reduced later through
application to the sentencing judges, Ehrlichman
must serve a minimum of 2.5 years before he be
comes eligible for parole.
Volcano expert loses position
Paris — Haroun Tazieff, one of the world's lead
ing authorities on volcanos, has been fired from his
post as head of a study institute after a dispute over
a Caribbean volcano that was supposed to explode
like an atomic bomb last summer — but never did.
Claude Allegre, director of the Clobal Physics
Institute, a branch of Paris University, said Thurs
day he had dismissed Tazieff as head of the insti
tute's volcanology service.

About 70,000 people were evacuated from an
area around the volcano Aug. 17 after scientists
said that La Soufriere's eruption was inevitable.
They predicted that it could have the force of sev
eral atomic bombs and posed the danger of "mon
strous" and "catastrophic" damage.
Tazieff told a reporter that he believes his dismis
sal was a "personal settling of scores."
'Psychic' canine picks Ford
Los Angeles — A political pup with a nose for
Tuesday's presidential election is predicting that
Gerald Ford will win the contest, even though the
canine prefers Jimmy Carter.
Taco Lipps. while hardly a name befitting a seri
ous political analyst, has a strong record for gues
sing correct answers to a variety of multiple choice
questions even though the dog thinks it's a bird.
Taco's owner, Frieda Lipps of suburban Canoga
Park, says Taco scores about 90 per cent correct on
mathematical multiple choice quizzes and can do
addition, multiplication, subtraction, division and
square roots.
But when it comes to choosing which kind of
animal he is, Taco inevitably chooses the answer
marked "bird."
Nevertheless. Taco was asked whether he would
predict a winner for Tuesday's presidential elec
tion.
"Taco," Mrs. Lipps said instructively, "we have
two men running for the Presidency. Now 1 want
you to tell me which one you like best."
"Krrowf rrrowf," said Taco, apparently referring
to Carter, choice No. 2.
"Who do you think will win?" asked Mrs. Lipps.
"Rrrowf," Taco said firmly.
Mrs. Lipps took Taco to the University of Califor
nia, Los Angeles Neuropsychology Institute where
parapsychologist Dr. Thelma Moss examined the
dog and ran a few brief experiments.
Dr. Moss said she found the canine's perfor
mance "impressive" and would like to perform
more experiments with the animal.
Today's weather

Brown harangues oil companies
l.os Angeles — Cov. Edmund Brown Jr. accused
major oil companies yesterday of conducting a cal
culated campaign against Prop. 14, the farm labor
initiative in order to distract the Legislature from
getting on to other business.
"This is a political issue," Brown told a news
conference at the Los Angeles Press Club. "It's a
chance for certain people to keep the Legislature in
turmoil."
He warned that defeat of the initiative would
begin another series of long battles over farm labor
laws and would prevent action on such issues as
property tax relief.
"I was personally involved in the farm labor
question," said Brown. "I know the hundreds of
hours it took. Prop. 14 will give us the peace and
stability we need to get onto other issues."
Brown said that major oil companies have con
trolling interests in the giant farms of California
and stand to benefit by preventing secret elections
in which farm laborers decide which union they
want to represent them.
Rhodesian meeting has shaky start
Geneva. Switzerland — Leaders of Rhodesia's
blacks and whites began their conference yesterday
on the African country's future in an atmosphere of
pessimism, bitterness and suspicion.
The historic meeting at the Palais des Nations
brought white Prime Minister lan Smith face to face
with four nationalist leaders vying to succeed him.
Britain told the delayed opening session all five
Rhodesian delegations must have the shared aim of
black majority rule within two years.
Delay and demonstration marked the start of the
talks that came about largely through the initiative
of U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and his
mission through Africa last month.
Black Rhodesians were divided against other
blacks, white Britons against their Rhodesian
cousins.
Aim of the talks is to arrange peaceful transition
to black rule in the breakaway British colony in
southern Africa where blacks outnumber the ruling
whites by 6.4 million to 278,000.
Richard said the aim of the conference is majority
rule within two years.
Richard told reporters during the day that "seri
ous problems" could arise next week. One relates to
a definition of majority rule. To the blacks it means
one man-one vote, while to Smith's group it means
rule by a majority of electors qualified by education
and property to vote.
A major conflict is over the makeup of an interim
government. Smith says he agreed with Kissinger
on a package that provided for white control of
police and the military during the transition
period. Nationalist leaders now say black control
must come at once.
Worldwide population growth slows

learned that two judges in Washington had granted
his request to begin serving his Watergate sen
tences.
By not waiting for Supreme Court review of his
convictions, Ehrlichman became the first of the
three convicted men closest to Richard Nixon —
and the highest ranking member of the Nixon ad
ministration to date — to be imprisoned.
His lawyer said he will continue to fight for re
versal of Ehrlichman's two Watergate convictions
in the high court.
Unless the prison time is reduced later through
application to the sentencing judges, Ehrlichman
must serve a minimum of 2.5 years before he be
comes eligible for parole.
Volcano expert loses position
Paris — Haroun Tazieff, one of the world's lead
ing authorities on volcanos, has been fired from his
post as head of a study institute after a dispute over
a Caribbean volcano that was supposed to explode
like an atomic bomb last summer — but never did.
Claude Allegre, director of the Clobal Physics
Institute, a branch of Paris University, said Thurs
day he had dismissed Tazieff as head of the insti
tute's volcanology service.

About 70,000 people were evacuated from an
area around the volcano Aug. 17 after scientists
said that La Soufriere's eruption was inevitable.
They predicted that it could have the force of sev
eral atomic bombs and posed the danger of "mon
strous" and "catastrophic" damage.
Tazieff told a reporter that he believes his dismis
sal was a "personal settling of scores."
'Psychic' canine picks Ford
Los Angeles — A political pup with a nose for
Tuesday's presidential election is predicting that
Gerald Ford will win the contest, even though the
canine prefers Jimmy Carter.
Taco Lipps. while hardly a name befitting a seri
ous political analyst, has a strong record for gues
sing correct answers to a variety of multiple choice
questions even though the dog thinks it's a bird.
Taco's owner, Frieda Lipps of suburban Canoga
Park, says Taco scores about 90 per cent correct on
mathematical multiple choice quizzes and can do
addition, multiplication, subtraction, division and
square roots.
But when it comes to choosing which kind of
animal he is, Taco inevitably chooses the answer
marked "bird."
Nevertheless. Taco was asked whether he would
predict a winner for Tuesday's presidential elec
tion.
"Taco," Mrs. Lipps said instructively, "we have
two men running for the Presidency. Now 1 want
you to tell me which one you like best."
"Krrowf rrrowf," said Taco, apparently referring
to Carter, choice No. 2.
"Who do you think will win?" asked Mrs. Lipps.
"Rrrowf," Taco said firmly.
Mrs. Lipps took Taco to the University of Califor
nia, Los Angeles Neuropsychology Institute where
parapsychologist Dr. Thelma Moss examined the
dog and ran a few brief experiments.
Dr. Moss said she found the canine's perfor
mance "impressive" and would like to perform
more experiments with the animal.
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday except low clouds and
patchy fog along the coast extending locally inland
nights and mornings. Slightly cooler. Lows in mid
40s to low 50s. Highs in mid 60s to mid 70s.
Brown harangues oil companies
l.os Angeles — Cov. Edmund Brown Jr. accused
major oil companies yesterday of conducting a cal
culated campaign against Prop. 14, the farm labor
initiative in order to distract the Legislature from
getting on to other business.
"This is a political issue," Brown told a news
conference at the Los Angeles Press Club. "It's a
chance for certain people to keep the Legislature in
turmoil."
He warned that defeat of the initiative would
begin another series of long battles over farm labor
laws and would prevent action on such issues as
property tax relief.
"I was personally involved in the farm labor
question," said Brown. "I know the hundreds of
hours it took. Prop. 14 will give us the peace and
stability we need to get onto other issues."
Brown said that major oil companies have con
trolling interests in the giant farms of California
and stand to benefit by preventing secret elections
in which farm laborers decide which union they
want to represent them.
Rhodesian meeting has shaky start
Geneva. Switzerland — Leaders of Rhodesia's
blacks and whites began their conference yesterday
on the African country's future in an atmosphere of
pessimism, bitterness and suspicion.
The historic meeting at the Palais des Nations
brought white Prime Minister lan Smith face to face
with four nationalist leaders vying to succeed him.
Britain told the delayed opening session all five
Rhodesian delegations must have the shared aim of
black majority rule within two years.
Delay and demonstration marked the start of the
talks that came about largely through the initiative
of U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and his
mission through Africa last month.
Black Rhodesians were divided against other
blacks, white Britons against their Rhodesian
cousins.
Aim of the talks is to arrange peaceful transition
to black rule in the breakaway British colony in
southern Africa where blacks outnumber the ruling
whites by 6.4 million to 278,000.
Richard said the aim of the conference is majority
rule within two years.
Richard told reporters during the day that "seri
ous problems" could arise next week. One relates to
a definition of majority rule. To the blacks it means
one man-one vote, while to Smith's group it means
rule by a majority of electors qualified by education
and property to vote.
A major conflict is over the makeup of an interim
government. Smith says he agreed with Kissinger
on a package that provided for white control of
police and the military during the transition
period. Nationalist leaders now say black control
must come at once.
Worldwide population growth slows
United Nations — Falling birth rates and unfore
seen deaths from hunger have slowed global popu
lation growth to the point where a doubling of
world population by the year 2000 is no longer
anticipated, according to the Worldwatch Research
Institute.
Paced by two of the world's four most populous

countries, China and the United States, population
growth has decreased in rich and poor countries
alike, reversing for the first time in history a trend of
gradually accelerating growth, the Worldwatch
study adds.
Cited among contributing factors for the U.S. de
cline are new social trends, including an unantici
jwted drop in the marriage rate, steady growth in
female employment and a sharp increase in female
enrollment in graduate and professional schools.
I)r. Brown says China's performance should
come as no surprise: the comprehensive Chinese
effort focuses not only on increasing family plan
ning services, including abortion, but also on re
shaping economic and social policies to encourage
small families, and on an intensive public educa
tion campaign extolling the benefits of smaller
families.
The few countries that still have rising birth rates
are mostly in Eastern Europe where the govern
ments recently adopted policies encouraging
births, and reversed the long-standing decline in
population growth.
IRA political leader slain
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Three youths assas
sinated IRA political organizer Maire Drumm last
night in a hospital ward, police reported.
They said the youths burst into Ward 3 of the
Mater Hospital in Belfast and shot Drumm as she
lay in bed.
Drumm, 56, was vice president and principal
political organizer for the Provisional Sinn Fein,
the legal political arm of the outlawed Irish Repub
lican Army's Provisional wing.
The Provisional IRA is a mainly Roman Catholic
movement fighting to drive the British from North
ern Ireland and unite the province with the Irish
republic.
