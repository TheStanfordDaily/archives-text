# UGLY disruption
## 
### 
A one-man disruption was staged at Meyer
Library (UCLY) from 9:30 to 9:45 p.m. yesterday.
According to witnesses, a figure dressed in a
trench coat and an old man's mask appeared on
the third floor and walked around for several
minutes. When a crowd had gathered around the
balcony, attracted perhaps by the "mood of an
ticipation," the disrupter "flashed" a clown
mask. After library staff members asked him to
leave, the masquerader exited to a standing ova
tion from the spectators.
Library officials refused to comment on the
incident, but UCLY staffer Kathleen Henry said
"We don't need publicity."
