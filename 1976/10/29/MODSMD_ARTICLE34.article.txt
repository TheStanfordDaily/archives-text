Research on recombinant DNA
molecules, known as "genetic en
gineering," will continue at Stanford
for the present under strict controls,
Acting Provost William Massy said
yesterday.
Massy told the Faculty Senate that
recombinant DNA research "has great
potential for science and is likely to
produce important socially desirable
results."
Recombinant DNA research in
volves active introduction of external
DNA into organisms such as bacteria,
and studying any resulting changes in
the organisms' structure and function.
DNA molecules are the "master code"
for the building of all living cell con
stituents, and are essential in cell re
production.
The difficulty with this type of re

search arises "because there is always
a possibility of human error" which
presents potential dangers, said
Massy. Recombinant or mutant bac
teria used in this research could cause
cancer and/or disease, and could sur
vive and multiply in the environment
should they escape.
An administrative panel on recom
binant DNA research has been estab
lished to review and control such re
search activities. "The questions being
raised are important, and they need
careful consideration," said Massy.
"Therefore I have called for a joint
DNA Panel/Committee on Research
meeting where spokesmen on both
sides of the issue will be invited to
present their positions."
Notice of the meeting will be pub
licized and wi 11 be open to members of
theuniversitycommunity, said Massy.
