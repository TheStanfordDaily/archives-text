# Marijuana may offer cures for glaucoma

A Washington D.C. speech and
rhetoric teacher will be able to smoke
marijuana legally in order to control
his glaucoma as the result of a recent
ruling by the U.S. Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
Bob Randall. 28. a part-time instruc
tor at Prince Georges Community Col
lege near Washington, D.C. was ar
rested earlier this year and charged
with possession of marijuana because
he had a few grass plants growing on
his back porch. At his trial in the D.C.
Superior Court in July, Randall admit
ted possession of the plants, but his
lawyer, John Karr, argued that his pos
session of the plants and use of the
drug was justified by the medical
necessity of using it to control his dis
ease.
Glaucoma is an eye disease in which
intraocular pressure eventually dam
ages the retina and leads to a serious
deterioration of vision, often resulting
in partial or complete blindness. The

decision is expected soon.
Randall's opthalmologists have said
his condition can no longer be control
led with conventional anti-glaucoma
drugs. He is already functionally blind
in one eye and has seriously impaired
vision in the other.
However, while a college student,
Randall noticed that after smoking
marijuana, the hazy ring seen around
lights by glaucoma sufferers disap
peared. He obtained similar relief
when he used the drug during a re
search program investigating
marijuana and glaucoma at IJCLA.
There was no similar university
program anywhere in the Washington,
D.C., area to which he moved. So he
asked the federal government to
exempt him from the 1970 Controlled
Substances Act, which classifies
marijuana in the same category as he
roin, and makes it illegal for physi
cians to prescribe it for treatment of
their patients.
Technically, the FDA ruling,
issued with the approval of the
National Institute for Drug
Abuse (NIDA) and the Drug En
forcement Administration, will
allow Randall access to the
marijuana under an authoriza
tion for "the study of marijuana
for the treatment of severe
glaucoma in adults" issued to
Dr. John Merritt, a Howard Uni
versity ophthalmologist. Up to
50 glaucoma patients may even
tually participate in the prog
ram, but so far, Randall is the
only subject in the study.
The marijuana that Randall
will use to control his glaucoma
will be provided to him by NIDA
from the federal marijuana farm
at the University of Mississippi,
where it is grown for use in fed
erally approved research. Ran
dall will reportedly be allowed
to obtain a week's supply at a
time, which he will administer to
himself. He has said that he
needs approximately five "reef
ers" (marijuana cigarettes) per
day to obtain the desired anti
glaucoma effects.
A recent report by the Depart
ment of Health, Education and
Welfare, Marijuana and Health

(1975), indicated that the "most
promising therapeutic applica
tions" of marijuana are in the
treatment of glaucoma and as an
anti-emetic for cancer patients
receiving chemotherapy and
possibly in the treatment of as
thmatics It is estimated that one
million Americans suffer from
glaucoma.
John Kaplan, a professor at the
Law School and author of
Marijuana, the New Prohibition
commented, "I would be sur
prised if a substance used for as
long and as widely as marijuana
couldn't be found useful in some
medical way."
Kaplan also said he feels that
the national effort to de
criminalize marijuana "is basi
cally being won" and that all
that remains is "the mopping
up."

commented, "I would be sur

Bob Randall. 28. a part-time instruc
tor at Prince Georges Community Col
lege near Washington, D.C. was ar
rested earlier this year and charged
with possession of marijuana because
he had a few grass plants growing on
his back porch. At his trial in the D.C.
Superior Court in July, Randall admit
ted possession of the plants, but his
lawyer, John Karr, argued that his pos
session of the plants and use of the
drug was justified by the medical
necessity of using it to control his dis
ease.
Glaucoma is an eye disease in which
intraocular pressure eventually dam
ages the retina and leads to a serious
deterioration of vision, often resulting
in partial or complete blindness. The

decision is expected soon.
Randall's opthalmologists have said
his condition can no longer be control
led with conventional anti-glaucoma
drugs. He is already functionally blind
in one eye and has seriously impaired
vision in the other.
However, while a college student,
Randall noticed that after smoking
marijuana, the hazy ring seen around
lights by glaucoma sufferers disap
peared. He obtained similar relief
when he used the drug during a re
search program investigating
marijuana and glaucoma at IJCLA.
There was no similar university
program anywhere in the Washington,
D.C., area to which he moved. So he
asked the federal government to
exempt him from the 1970 Controlled
Substances Act, which classifies
marijuana in the same category as he
roin, and makes it illegal for physi
cians to prescribe it for treatment of
their patients.
Technically, the FDA ruling,
issued with the approval of the
National Institute for Drug
Abuse (NIDA) and the Drug En
forcement Administration, will
allow Randall access to the
marijuana under an authoriza
tion for "the study of marijuana
for the treatment of severe
glaucoma in adults" issued to
Dr. John Merritt, a Howard Uni
versity ophthalmologist. Up to
50 glaucoma patients may even
tually participate in the prog
ram, but so far, Randall is the
only subject in the study.
The marijuana that Randall
will use to control his glaucoma
will be provided to him by NIDA
from the federal marijuana farm
at the University of Mississippi,
where it is grown for use in fed
erally approved research. Ran
dall will reportedly be allowed
to obtain a week's supply at a
time, which he will administer to
himself. He has said that he
needs approximately five "reef
ers" (marijuana cigarettes) per
day to obtain the desired anti
glaucoma effects.
A recent report by the Depart
ment of Health, Education and
Welfare, Marijuana and Health

(1975), indicated that the "most
promising therapeutic applica
tions" of marijuana are in the
treatment of glaucoma and as an
anti-emetic for cancer patients
receiving chemotherapy and
possibly in the treatment of as
thmatics It is estimated that one
million Americans suffer from
