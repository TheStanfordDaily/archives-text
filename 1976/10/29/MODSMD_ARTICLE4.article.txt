# Marijuana may offer cures for glaucoma

A Washington D.C. speech and
rhetoric teacher will be able to smoke
marijuana legally in order to control
his glaucoma as the result of a recent
ruling by the U.S. Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
Bob Randall. 28. a part-time instruc
tor at Prince Georges Community Col
lege near Washington, D.C. was ar
rested earlier this year and charged
with possession of marijuana because
he had a few grass plants growing on
his back porch. At his trial in the D.C.
Superior Court in July, Randall admit
ted possession of the plants, but his
lawyer, John Karr, argued that his pos
session of the plants and use of the
drug was justified by the medical
necessity of using it to control his dis
ease.
Glaucoma is an eye disease in which
intraocular pressure eventually dam
ages the retina and leads to a serious
deterioration of vision, often resulting
in partial or complete blindness. The

decision is expected soon.
Randall's opthalmologists have said
his condition can no longer be control
led with conventional anti-glaucoma
drugs. He is already functionally blind
in one eye and has seriously impaired
vision in the other.
However, while a college student,
Randall noticed that after smoking
marijuana, the hazy ring seen around
lights by glaucoma sufferers disap
peared. He obtained similar relief
when he used the drug during a re
search program investigating
marijuana and glaucoma at IJCLA.
There was no similar university
program anywhere in the Washington,
D.C., area to which he moved. So he
asked the federal government to
exempt him from the 1970 Controlled
Substances Act, which classifies
marijuana in the same category as he
roin, and makes it illegal for physi
cians to prescribe it for treatment of
their patients.
