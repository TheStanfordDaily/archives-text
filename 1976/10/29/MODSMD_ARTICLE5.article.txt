# U.S. customs agent:
## Korean businessman funded U.S. politicians

From the Associated Press
Washington â€” Korean businessman
Tongsun Park boasted in December
1973 that he gave thousands of dollars
in campaign contributions to many
prominent American politicians, in
cluding $500,000 to former President
Richard Nixon, a customs official said
yesterday.
Park, a rice broker who is the key
figure in a Justice Department investi
gation of influence-peddling in Con
gress by Korean agents, was carrying a
list with U.S. politicians' names and
figures he said represented campaign
contributions when he was searched
by customs agents in Anchorage,
Alaska, on Dec. 8, 1973.
Park made frantic efforts to recover
or tear up the list and other papers
dealing with rice transactions before
inspectors read them, said Donavan
Working, former U.S. Customs district
director for Anchorage.

Later, a phone call to customs offi
cials in Washington determined the
papers could not be confiscated, Work
ing said.
Park then bragged that the two- and
three-digit figures beside each name
stood for "thousands of dollars" in
contributions, which had "something
to do with assistance from these offi
cials with some sort of a rice program
that he was involved in," according to
Working, now district customs direc
tor in Laredo, Texas.
A government source said Thursday
that Justice Department investigators
have not determined the significance
of Park's list, particularly whether it
meant Park had made any payments to
the officials.
Most of the names on the list have
not been made public. Working said
that in addition to Nixon, he recalled
that the names of Sens. Barry Coldwa
ter, R-Ariz., and Hubert Humphrey,
D-Minn., were on the list, along with
then Rep. Richard Hanna, D-Calif.
A spokesman for Humphrey said
Thursday, "There was no contribu
tions to the senator from Park, and he
had no connection with Park or the
Korean lobby."
An aide to Goldwater said the
senator had thoroughly checked his
financial records back to 1964, "and
none of us can recall any kind of con
tribution or gift of any kind from Park

or anybody connected in any fashion
with him."
The aide said that Goldwater is a
member of the posh Georgetown Club,
a private club here owned by Park, but
does not have ties with Park himself.
Park, who also owns an export
import business here, is out of the
country, but his lawyers have said he
has denied allegations that he made
illegal cash payments to any con
gressmen.
Park reportedly has told federal in
vestigators about contributions he
made to several congressmen, includ
ing former Reps. Cornelius Gallagher
of New Jersey and Hanna of California.
Rep. John Brademas, D-Ind., has
acknowledge receiving campaign con
tributions totaling $4650 from Park in
1972 and 1974.
Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards ad
mitted Monday that his wife accepted
a gift of $10,000 from Park in 1971 after
Edwards, then a congressman, turned
down Park's offer of a contribution to
Edwards' gubernatorial campaign.
Before 1974, it was not illegal for
foreigners to make contributions to
American political campaigns. But it
would be illegal for Park to undertake
any lobbying activity in Congress on
behalf of the Korean government
without registering with the Justice
Department under the Eoreign Agents
Registration Act.
