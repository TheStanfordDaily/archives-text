# Ford and Carter even in California

From the Associated Press
Los Angeles — Jimmy Carter's com
fortable lead in California over Presi
dent Gerald Ford has melted to no
thing, according to an Associated
Press poll, but Democratic leaders say
the Carter campaign is "all coming to
gether" now.
Ford, despite spectacular gains in
voter preference polls, still has the re
gistration figures stacked heavily
against him in California, whose 45
electoral votes give it the biggest clout
of any state.
The president was one percentage
point ahead of Carter in the latest
California Poll, after trailing by 20
points two months ago.
Hut in the same period, a registration
drive has signed up three new Democ
rats for every new Republican. Democ
rats now outnumber Republicans by
about 2.1 million, around 58 per cent
to 36 per cent.
Leaders of both parties say the race
for California's 45 electors may be de
cided by the size of the voter turnout
and the impact of a state ballot propos
ition pushed by farm labor leader
Cesar Chavez.
Ford said before his final swing
through California last week that the
state is on his must-win list.
"There are a number of other combi
nations, but California has 45 electoral
votes. That means California is the real
key state in any realistic combina
tion," Ford told newspaper editors.
Carter underscored the emphasis he
puts on California with plans to spend
the final day of his two-year-long cam
paign for president at get-out-the vote
rallies in three California cities.
After equally slow and disorganized

starts, the Ford and Carter campaigns
both are attracting large numbers of
volunteers.
"It can go either way now, and it's
going to be voter turnout that decides
it," said Republican state Vice Chair
man Mike Montgomery.
"You're going to see people from
both parties criss-crossing the street in
the same precincts. If there are kids at
home, we'll baby-sit. If they're in trac
tion, we'll wheel them to the polls. We
need an 80 per cent turnout of the Re
publicans to win, and we're organiz
ing to get 80 per cent," Montgomery
said.
"It will be close, with the remaining
variable being the turnout," said Cray
Davis, chief adviser to Democratic
Cov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.
David agreed Carter's campaign was
slow starting in California. But he said
the voter registration drive was a suc
cess, and that volunteers are in place
for the get-out-the-vote drive.
"It's coming together. Yes. We will
win," Davis said. "There is no doubt
that more eligible voters prefer Cov.
Carter to Gerald Ford. A big turnout
will produce a substantial victory for
Gov. Carter. A modest turnout will
produce a close victory."
Montgomery said he will have one
or more volunteers working in every
one of California's 24,440 precincts to
get out the GOP vote.
Democrats, with less precinct or
ganization, say they will reach three
quarters of the state's 5.8 million
Democrats by letter or telephone or
both next Monday and Tuesday to re
mind them to vote.
Ford, campaigning in Cincinnati,
Ohio, yesterday unveiled plans tor an
international effort to prevent the
spread of nuclear weapons. He
coupled his proposals with a promise
that construction of uranium enrich
ment facilities in Portsmouth, Ohio,
would begin early next year and would
mean 6000 new jobs.
Carter told a rally in Cleveland he
cannot promise a substantial tax re
duction that a day earlier he had de
clared would he the "almost inevita

ble" result of his economic policies
after four years in the White House.
The Democratic candidate said that
with a good rate of economic growth
and lowered inflation and unemploy
ment "perhaps" there could be "some
tax cuts."
He added, "I am very careful not to
promise that for sure."
Ohio with 25 electoral votes is be
lieved to be leaning slightly toward
Carter, although both sides say the race
is tight.

"It can go either way now, and it's
going to be voter turnout that decides
it," said Republican state Vice Chair
man Mike Montgomery.
"You're going to see people from
both parties criss-crossing the street in
the same precincts. If there are kids at
home, we'll baby-sit. If they're in trac
tion, we'll wheel them to the polls. We
need an 80 per cent turnout of the Re
publicans to win, and we're organiz
ing to get 80 per cent," Montgomery
said.
"It will be close, with the remaining
variable being the turnout," said Cray
Davis, chief adviser to Democratic
Cov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.
David agreed Carter's campaign was
slow starting in California. But he said
the voter registration drive was a suc
cess, and that volunteers are in place
for the get-out-the-vote drive.
"It's coming together. Yes. We will
win," Davis said. "There is no doubt
that more eligible voters prefer Cov.
Carter to Gerald Ford. A big turnout
will produce a substantial victory for
Gov. Carter. A modest turnout will
produce a close victory."
Montgomery said he will have one
or more volunteers working in every
one of California's 24,440 precincts to
get out the GOP vote.
Democrats, with less precinct or
ganization, say they will reach three
quarters of the state's 5.8 million
Democrats by letter or telephone or
both next Monday and Tuesday to re
mind them to vote.
Ford, campaigning in Cincinnati,
Ohio, yesterday unveiled plans tor an
international effort to prevent the
spread of nuclear weapons. He
coupled his proposals with a promise
that construction of uranium enrich
ment facilities in Portsmouth, Ohio,
would begin early next year and would
mean 6000 new jobs.
Carter told a rally in Cleveland he
cannot promise a substantial tax re
duction that a day earlier he had de
clared would he the "almost inevita

ble" result of his economic policies
after four years in the White House.
The Democratic candidate said that
with a good rate of economic growth
and lowered inflation and unemploy
ment "perhaps" there could be "some
tax cuts."
He added, "I am very careful not to
promise that for sure."
Ohio with 25 electoral votes is be
lieved to be leaning slightly toward
Carter, although both sides say the race
is tight.

From the Associated Press
Los Angeles — Jimmy Carter's com
fortable lead in California over Presi
dent Gerald Ford has melted to no
thing, according to an Associated
Press poll, but Democratic leaders say
the Carter campaign is "all coming to
gether" now.
Ford, despite spectacular gains in
voter preference polls, still has the re
gistration figures stacked heavily
against him in California, whose 45
electoral votes give it the biggest clout
of any state.
The president was one percentage
point ahead of Carter in the latest
California Poll, after trailing by 20
points two months ago.
Hut in the same period, a registration
drive has signed up three new Democ
rats for every new Republican. Democ
rats now outnumber Republicans by
about 2.1 million, around 58 per cent
to 36 per cent.
Leaders of both parties say the race
for California's 45 electors may be de
cided by the size of the voter turnout
and the impact of a state ballot propos
ition pushed by farm labor leader
Cesar Chavez.
Ford said before his final swing
through California last week that the
state is on his must-win list.
"There are a number of other combi
nations, but California has 45 electoral
votes. That means California is the real
key state in any realistic combina
tion," Ford told newspaper editors.
Carter underscored the emphasis he
puts on California with plans to spend
the final day of his two-year-long cam
paign for president at get-out-the vote
rallies in three California cities.
After equally slow and disorganized

starts, the Ford and Carter campaigns
both are attracting large numbers of
volunteers.
"It can go either way now, and it's
going to be voter turnout that decides
it," said Republican state Vice Chair
man Mike Montgomery.
"You're going to see people from
both parties criss-crossing the street in
the same precincts. If there are kids at
home, we'll baby-sit. If they're in trac
tion, we'll wheel them to the polls. We

Carter told a rally in Cleveland he
cannot promise a substantial tax re
duction that a day earlier he had de
clared would he the "almost inevita

ble" result of his economic policies
after four years in the White House.
The Democratic candidate said that

and lowered inflation and unemploy
ment "perhaps" there could be "some
tax cuts."
He added, "I am very careful not to

lieved to be leaning slightly toward
Carter, although both sides say the race
is tight.
