## Opinions Democracy dies 
### 
John Gove

While the Chicago Tribune may be
convinced that the "New Thai Regime
Threatens Freedom" (Daily, Oct. 19),
its editorial staff has itself clearly
threatened the possibility of a rational
appraisal of the Thai political situa
tion. Both the facts and issues involved
were distorted by the Tribune.
The most recent military coup in
Bangkok was ostensibly directed to
preserve the monarchy forever in the
face of alleged criticism, and to pre
vent an imminent, communist
inspired plot to gain power. In fact, it
was a rightist-military assault on the
civilian left — the final act of a well
planned plot which was ruthless and
swift enough to forestall any organized
opposition.
And so the three-year Thai experi
ment in democracy died with hardly a
whimper on Oct. 7. The reasons for the
relatively easy demise of the civilian
government do. however, go much
deeper into Thai politics and have
more far-reaching implications than
the Tribune allows for.
Thailand's brief republican experi
ence, coming after 40 years of assorted
military regimes and 13 previous
coups, was not exactly a conspicuous
success. Civilian government disunity
was so pervasive, and direction was so
nebulous that ineffectiveness and con
tinued corruption were the watch
words of the administration. Its only
clear policy was to seek rapproche
ment with the new communist gov
ernments of Indochina, completely
alienating the powerful and militant
right.
Turbulent homecomings
Furthermore, the weak and fragile
position of the civilian was underlined
by vacillation and uncertainty in deal
ing with turbulent homecomings of

the exiled former strongman, Marshal
Prapas in August, and last month's re
turn by his former boss, Marshal
Thanom.
The coming of Thanom and Prapas
not only laid bare the power vacuum in
Thai politics, but has rudely exposed
the contradictions in Thai democracy
and confirmed that the question of
who should take power, raised by their
exile three years ago, remained un
answered.
These questions went deeper than
the perennial ones of which faction or
party should plunder the spoils of of
fice. They were concerned whether
democratic institutions in Thailand
could construct a forum where the
people could share in power, or merely
establish a storefront for traditional
bureaucratic absolutism, military or
otherwise.
It appears now that the brief inter
lude of mob rule, the student worker
alliance in the streets, has lost both its
popularity and its effectiveness. It was
this failure of democracy, not the pat
tern of historical inevitability cited by
the Tribune, that led to the rise of the
military to power.
Regardless of one's ideological view
point or values, free and representa
tive democracy appears to have run its
course in Thailand. Even the left may
now decide that it has no option but to
accept the situation or, for its more ad
venturous souls, to take to the jungle
with the communists. If the military
can overcome its own internal fac
tionalism, as now appears certain,
then it can and will seize power for
good: only if they fail could the way be
open for civilian politicians to intro
duce some form of guided democracy.

convinced that the "New Thai Regime
Threatens Freedom" (Daily, Oct. 19),
its editorial staff has itself clearly
threatened the possibility of a rational
appraisal of the Thai political situa
tion. Both the facts and issues involved
were distorted by the Tribune.
The most recent military coup in
Bangkok was ostensibly directed to
preserve the monarchy forever in the
face of alleged criticism, and to pre
vent an imminent, communist
inspired plot to gain power. In fact, it
was a rightist-military assault on the
civilian left — the final act of a well
planned plot which was ruthless and
swift enough to forestall any organized
opposition.
And so the three-year Thai experi
ment in democracy died with hardly a
whimper on Oct. 7. The reasons for the
relatively easy demise of the civilian
government do. however, go much
deeper into Thai politics and have
more far-reaching implications than
the Tribune allows for.
Thailand's brief republican experi
ence, coming after 40 years of assorted
military regimes and 13 previous
coups, was not exactly a conspicuous
success. Civilian government disunity
was so pervasive, and direction was so
nebulous that ineffectiveness and con
tinued corruption were the watch
words of the administration. Its only
clear policy was to seek rapproche
ment with the new communist gov
ernments of Indochina, completely
alienating the powerful and militant
right.
Turbulent homecomings
Furthermore, the weak and fragile
position of the civilian was underlined
by vacillation and uncertainty in deal
ing with turbulent homecomings of

the exiled former strongman, Marshal
Prapas in August, and last month's re
turn by his former boss, Marshal
Thanom.
The coming of Thanom and Prapas
not only laid bare the power vacuum in
Thai politics, but has rudely exposed
the contradictions in Thai democracy
and confirmed that the question of
who should take power, raised by their
exile three years ago, remained un
answered.
These questions went deeper than
the perennial ones of which faction or
party should plunder the spoils of of
fice. They were concerned whether
democratic institutions in Thailand
could construct a forum where the
people could share in power, or merely
establish a storefront for traditional
bureaucratic absolutism, military or
otherwise.
It appears now that the brief inter
lude of mob rule, the student worker
alliance in the streets, has lost both its
popularity and its effectiveness. It was
this failure of democracy, not the pat
tern of historical inevitability cited by
the Tribune, that led to the rise of the
military to power.
Regardless of one's ideological view
point or values, free and representa
tive democracy appears to have run its
course in Thailand. Even the left may
now decide that it has no option but to
accept the situation or, for its more ad
venturous souls, to take to the jungle
with the communists. If the military
can overcome its own internal fac
tionalism, as now appears certain,
then it can and will seize power for
good: only if they fail could the way be
open for civilian politicians to intro
duce some form of guided democracy.
