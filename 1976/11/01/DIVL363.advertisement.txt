because the planet depends on it
Spaceship Earth, 1976. The oceans are dying. The air is contaminated.
The water is polluted. Animal and marine species are disappearing. Our
forests are clear-cut. Our mountains are strip-mined. Our rivers and streams
are dammed, diverted and channelized. Our future is being ransomed to
the uncertainties and hazards of nuclear power. And on Tuesday, we will
elect a President who must face it all.
What difference does your vote make?
Quite simply, it makes the difference between environmental hope and
environmental despair. It makes the difference between Jimmy Carter—who
is the best environmental candidate in seventy years —and Gerald Ford —
who is probably the worst. On no other issue in this Presidential campaign
are the differences between Carter and Ford more clearly defined. And
every serious environmentalist in the country knows it.
Last April, the prestigious National League of Conservation
Voters published an exhaustive, six-month study on the environ
mental records of each major candidate. Jimmy Carter received
the League's highest rating: OUTSTANDING. Gerald Ford received
the lowest rating: HOPELESS. On every major environmental issue
facing us, these ratings represent the choice we face.
What we face is the most important environmental election of our life
time. The choice is clear. The choice is in your hands. PLEASE . . . make your
vote count on election day. Join us—Vote for JIMMY CARTER. Environ
mentalist, for President.
The environmental health of the planet depends on it.

because the planet depends on it
Spaceship Earth, 1976. The oceans are dying. The air is contaminated.
The water is polluted. Animal and marine species are disappearing. Our
forests are clear-cut. Our mountains are strip-mined. Our rivers and streams
are dammed, diverted and channelized. Our future is being ransomed to
the uncertainties and hazards of nuclear power. And on Tuesday, we will
elect a President who must face it all.
What difference does your vote make?
Quite simply, it makes the difference between environmental hope and
environmental despair. It makes the difference between Jimmy Carter—who
is the best environmental candidate in seventy years —and Gerald Ford —
who is probably the worst. On no other issue in this Presidential campaign
are the differences between Carter and Ford more clearly defined. And
every serious environmentalist in the country knows it.
Last April, the prestigious National League of Conservation
Voters published an exhaustive, six-month study on the environ
mental records of each major candidate. Jimmy Carter received
the League's highest rating: OUTSTANDING. Gerald Ford received
the lowest rating: HOPELESS. On every major environmental issue
facing us, these ratings represent the choice we face.
