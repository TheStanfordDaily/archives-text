## 
### Martin Kernberg Marc Strassman 
Democratic candidates are heavily favored
by undergraduates here according to a poll
of 274 persons conducted Friday by the
Daily.
Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy
Carter was the choice of 5U per cent of the
students surveyed, while Republican in
cumbent Gerald Ford received 35 per cent.
Independent candidate Fugene McCarthy
was thechoice of five percent of those polled
and other candidates received four per cent.
Six per cent were still undecided.
Democratic congressional candidate
David Harris was the choice of 55 percent of
those registered in the 12th District, com
pared to .12 per cent supporting Republican
incumbent Pete McCloskey. Thirteen per
cent had not yet decided how to vote on this
one.
Democratic Senator John Tunney com
pleted a Democratic sweep by receiving 53
per cent of the survey votes, compared to
Republican challenger S.l. Hayakawa's 28
per cent, with 16 per cent undecided.
Proposition 14. the Farm Workers' Initia
tive, was approved by 64 per cent of those

polled, while 26 per cent disagreed with the
proposition. Eleven per cent were unde
cided.
Voter registration
Of those polled, 95 per cent were regis
tered to vote: 56 per cent Democratic, 29 per
cent Republican, 15 per cent had other re
gistrations.
These registration figures vary by only
three per cent from figures provided by the
Santa Clara County registrar of voters as of
October 4 for all Stanford students and fa
culty.
The sample was 55 per cent male and 45
per cent female, a representative cross
sample of the student population as a whole.
The breakdown by class was: freshmen: 10
per cent, sophomores: 46 per cent, juniors:
21 per cent, seniors: 19 per cent and graduate
students four per cent.
Support by party
Democrat Carter received less support
from registered members of his own party
than did Republican Pord. While 78 per cent
of those identifying themselves as Republi
cans support their party's nominee, only 68
per cent of Democrats said they plan to vote
for the Georgia peanut farmer and nuclear

engineer.
Congressional candidate Harris, on the
other hand, was the choice of a greater per
centage of his party than his Republican op
ponent McCloskey. Seventy-four per cent of
registered Democrats said they plan to vote
for the former Stanford student body presi
dent and draft resister, while only 61 per
cent of the registered Republicans are sup
porting former Marine colonel and anti-war
liberal McCloskey.
The survey showed political philosophy
to be an important indicator of presidential
preference. Seventy-eight per cent of those
describing themselves »s slightly conserva
tive, conservative, or very conservative said
they are going to vote for Ford, while 69 per
cent of those calling themselves slightly lib
eral, liberal, very liberal or radical expressed
a preference for Carter.
Political philosophies
Thirty-two per cent described themselves
as slightly conservative, conservative, or
very conservative, while 67 per cent
categorized themselves as slightly liberal,
liberal, very liberal, or radical (six percent).
Those supporting the president and those
favoring Carter differed significantly on

political issues. On the question of defense
spending, for example, 59 per cent of those
favoring present funding levels or an in
crease in defense spending support Ford,
while 63 percent of those favoring moderate
or substantial reductions in the Defense De
partment's appropriation said they plan to
vote for Carter.
Of those who indicated they feel un
employment is a more important priority tor
government action than inflation, 69 per
cent are for Carter, while of those who chose
the opposite priorities, 62 per cent are for
Ford.
Abortion
Eighty-one per cent of those polled agreed
with the statement that "the decision to have
an abortion is the sole responsibility of a
woman and her physician." Presidential
preference seemed to have little to do with
this issue. Forty-nine per cent of Carter sup
porters agreed with the statement, while 47
per cent disagreed; 33 per cent of Ford sup
porters agreed and 44 per cent disagreed.
The typical Ford supporter emerging from
this survey is Protestant, from a small town
and has self-employed parents. Ford enjoys a
44-39 per cent lead among students from

smaller towns (less than 75,000 population).
All other residential categories favor Carter.
Carter's lead over Ford increases from 53-30
in cities of 250,000 to 1,000.000 people to
(>l-22 in cities with populations greater than
1.000,000.
By religious categories, Ford has majority
(55-42) only among Protestant students. The
majority of all other religious groups favor
Carter.
Among those whose parents were self
employed. Ford led Carter by a margin of 44
per cent to 33 per cent. However, in every
income group, from those whose parents
made less than $h()()l) a year (three percent of
the sample) to those whose parents made
more than $50,000 a year (26 per cent of the
sample), a majority favored Carter.
Other findings
Other significant findings from the poll:
Fifty-eight per cent of those polled said
they thought economic and military aid
should be cut off from nations violating
human rights, while 1H per cent disagreed
and 23 per cent were undecided.
No one endorsed United States military
intervention to overthrow an unfriendly
government. Six per cent said U.S.
military intervention was never ap
propriate, 42 per cent said invasion
was appropriate to prevent an immi
nent invasion of the U.S., 17 per cent
said invasion was allowable to defend
threatened friendly governments, and
35 per cent said it was appropriate to
protect U.S. lives and property abroad.
On detente, 41 per cent said it had

been beneficial to the U.S., 22 per cent
considered it harmful; and 36 per cent
said it had had no effect.
Fifty-nine per cent of those polled
said they thought that political events
are "slightly important" in directly in
fluencing their lives, while 35 per cent
indicated they were very important,
and six per cent said they had no effect.
A majority (54 per cent) of the stu
dents polled said they had not partici

pated at all in any political activities in
1976. Of those who had, almost equal
numbers had been involved on the
presidential level (12 per cent), the se
nate and congressional level (12 per
cent) and the university or dormitory
level (10and 11 percent, respectively).

ponent McCloskey. Seventy-four per cent of
registered Democrats said they plan to vote
for the former Stanford student body presi
dent and draft resister, while only 61 per
cent of the registered Republicans are sup
porting former Marine colonel and anti-war
liberal McCloskey.
The survey showed political philosophy
to be an important indicator of presidential
preference. Seventy-eight per cent of those
describing themselves »s slightly conserva
tive, conservative, or very conservative said
they are going to vote for Ford, while 69 per
cent of those calling themselves slightly lib
eral, liberal, very liberal or radical expressed
a preference for Carter.
Political philosophies
Thirty-two per cent described themselves
as slightly conservative, conservative, or
very conservative, while 67 per cent
categorized themselves as slightly liberal,
liberal, very liberal, or radical (six percent).
Those supporting the president and those
favoring Carter differed significantly on

political issues. On the question of defense
spending, for example, 59 per cent of those
favoring present funding levels or an in
crease in defense spending support Ford,
while 63 percent of those favoring moderate
or substantial reductions in the Defense De
partment's appropriation said they plan to
vote for Carter.
Of those who indicated they feel un
employment is a more important priority tor
government action than inflation, 69 per
cent are for Carter, while of those who chose
the opposite priorities, 62 per cent are for
Ford.
Abortion
Eighty-one per cent of those polled agreed
with the statement that "the decision to have
an abortion is the sole responsibility of a
woman and her physician." Presidential
preference seemed to have little to do with
this issue. Forty-nine per cent of Carter sup
porters agreed with the statement, while 47
per cent disagreed; 33 per cent of Ford sup
porters agreed and 44 per cent disagreed.
The typical Ford supporter emerging from
this survey is Protestant, from a small town
and has self-employed parents. Ford enjoys a
44-39 per cent lead among students from

smaller towns (less than 75,000 population).
All other residential categories favor Carter.
Carter's lead over Ford increases from 53-30
in cities of 250,000 to 1,000.000 people to
(>l-22 in cities with populations greater than
1.000,000.
By religious categories, Ford has majority
(55-42) only among Protestant students. The
majority of all other religious groups favor
Carter.
Among those whose parents were self
employed. Ford led Carter by a margin of 44
per cent to 33 per cent. However, in every
income group, from those whose parents
made less than $h()()l) a year (three percent of
the sample) to those whose parents made
more than $50,000 a year (26 per cent of the
sample), a majority favored Carter.

Fifty-eight per cent of those polled said
they thought economic and military aid

said invasion was allowable to defend
threatened friendly governments, and
35 per cent said it was appropriate to
protect U.S. lives and property abroad.
On detente, 41 per cent said it had

been beneficial to the U.S., 22 per cent
considered it harmful; and 36 per cent
said it had had no effect.
Fifty-nine per cent of those polled
said they thought that political events
are "slightly important" in directly in
fluencing their lives, while 35 per cent
indicated they were very important,
and six per cent said they had no effect.
A majority (54 per cent) of the stu

pated at all in any political activities in
1976. Of those who had, almost equal
numbers had been involved on the
presidential level (12 per cent), the se

culty.
The sample was 55 per cent male and 45
per cent female, a representative cross
sample of the student population as a whole.
The breakdown by class was: freshmen: 10
per cent, sophomores: 46 per cent, juniors:
21 per cent, seniors: 19 per cent and graduate
students four per cent.

of those identifying themselves as Republi
cans support their party's nominee, only 68
per cent of Democrats said they plan to vote
for the Georgia peanut farmer and nuclear

engineer.
Congressional candidate Harris, on the
other hand, was the choice of a greater per
centage of his party than his Republican op
ponent McCloskey. Seventy-four per cent of
registered Democrats said they plan to vote
for the former Stanford student body presi
dent and draft resister, while only 61 per
cent of the registered Republicans are sup
porting former Marine colonel and anti-war

liberal, very liberal, or radical (six percent).

favoring present funding levels or an in
crease in defense spending support Ford,
while 63 percent of those favoring moderate
or substantial reductions in the Defense De
partment's appropriation said they plan to
vote for Carter.
Of those who indicated they feel un
employment is a more important priority tor
government action than inflation, 69 per
cent are for Carter, while of those who chose
the opposite priorities, 62 per cent are for
Ford.
Abortion
Eighty-one per cent of those polled agreed
with the statement that "the decision to have

porters agreed with the statement, while 47
per cent disagreed; 33 per cent of Ford sup
porters agreed and 44 per cent disagreed.
The typical Ford supporter emerging from

and has self-employed parents. Ford enjoys a
44-39 per cent lead among students from

smaller towns (less than 75,000 population).
All other residential categories favor Carter.
Carter's lead over Ford increases from 53-30

was thechoice of five percent of those polled
and other candidates received four per cent.
Six per cent were still undecided.
Democratic congressional candidate
David Harris was the choice of 55 percent of
those registered in the 12th District, com
pared to .12 per cent supporting Republican
incumbent Pete McCloskey. Thirteen per
cent had not yet decided how to vote on this

Proposition 14. the Farm Workers' Initia
tive, was approved by 64 per cent of those

polled, while 26 per cent disagreed with the
proposition. Eleven per cent were unde
cided.
Voter registration
Of those polled, 95 per cent were regis
tered to vote: 56 per cent Democratic, 29 per
cent Republican, 15 per cent had other re
gistrations.
These registration figures vary by only
three per cent from figures provided by the
Santa Clara County registrar of voters as of
October 4 for all Stanford students and fa
culty.
The sample was 55 per cent male and 45
per cent female, a representative cross
sample of the student population as a whole.
The breakdown by class was: freshmen: 10
per cent, sophomores: 46 per cent, juniors:
21 per cent, seniors: 19 per cent and graduate
students four per cent.
Support by party
Democrat Carter received less support
from registered members of his own party
than did Republican Pord. While 78 per cent
of those identifying themselves as Republi
cans support their party's nominee, only 68
per cent of Democrats said they plan to vote
for the Georgia peanut farmer and nuclear

engineer.
Congressional candidate Harris, on the
other hand, was the choice of a greater per
centage of his party than his Republican op
ponent McCloskey. Seventy-four per cent of
registered Democrats said they plan to vote
for the former Stanford student body presi
dent and draft resister, while only 61 per
cent of the registered Republicans are sup
porting former Marine colonel and anti-war
liberal McCloskey.
The survey showed political philosophy
to be an important indicator of presidential
preference. Seventy-eight per cent of those
describing themselves »s slightly conserva
tive, conservative, or very conservative said
they are going to vote for Ford, while 69 per
cent of those calling themselves slightly lib
eral, liberal, very liberal or radical expressed
a preference for Carter.
Political philosophies
Thirty-two per cent described themselves
as slightly conservative, conservative, or
very conservative, while 67 per cent
categorized themselves as slightly liberal,
liberal, very liberal, or radical (six percent).
Those supporting the president and those
favoring Carter differed significantly on

political issues. On the question of defense
spending, for example, 59 per cent of those
favoring present funding levels or an in
crease in defense spending support Ford,
while 63 percent of those favoring moderate
or substantial reductions in the Defense De
partment's appropriation said they plan to
vote for Carter.
Of those who indicated they feel un
employment is a more important priority tor
government action than inflation, 69 per
cent are for Carter, while of those who chose
the opposite priorities, 62 per cent are for
Ford.
Abortion
Eighty-one per cent of those polled agreed
with the statement that "the decision to have
an abortion is the sole responsibility of a
woman and her physician." Presidential
preference seemed to have little to do with
this issue. Forty-nine per cent of Carter sup
porters agreed with the statement, while 47
per cent disagreed; 33 per cent of Ford sup
porters agreed and 44 per cent disagreed.
The typical Ford supporter emerging from
this survey is Protestant, from a small town
and has self-employed parents. Ford enjoys a
44-39 per cent lead among students from

smaller towns (less than 75,000 population).
All other residential categories favor Carter.
Carter's lead over Ford increases from 53-30
in cities of 250,000 to 1,000.000 people to
(>l-22 in cities with populations greater than
1.000,000.
By religious categories, Ford has majority
(55-42) only among Protestant students. The
majority of all other religious groups favor
Carter.
Among those whose parents were self
employed. Ford led Carter by a margin of 44
per cent to 33 per cent. However, in every
income group, from those whose parents
made less than $h()()l) a year (three percent of
the sample) to those whose parents made
more than $50,000 a year (26 per cent of the
sample), a majority favored Carter.

they thought economic and military aid
should be cut off from nations violating
