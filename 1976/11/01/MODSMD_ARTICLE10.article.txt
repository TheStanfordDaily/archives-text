# Ford threatens civil, economic liberty
##

Bill Evers

Salient aspects of President Gerald
Ford's record on civil liberties,
economic policy, and foreign policy
have received less attention than they
deserve in the course of this election
campaign.
Concerning the rights of the ac
cused, Ford said during the Oct. 22
debate that he was "pleased" that steps
had been taken by the Burger court to
reduce the protections of the Warren
court's Miranda decision. The
Miranda decision provides specific
safeguards against forced or fraudu
lently induced confessions.
On preventive detention, Ford ap
proved of the preventive detention
provision of the District of Columbia
Court Reform and Criminal Procedure
Act of 1970. He was the sole sponsor of
a 1971 Nixon Administration bill that
would have provided for large-scale
pretrial detention of accused persons.
Ford endorsed the Nixon Administ
ration's handling of the 1971 "May
day" antiwar protest, in which police
used mass arrests to indiscriminately
sweep 12,000 persons off the streets of
Washington on the day of the de
monstrations.
Regarding governmental secrecy,
Ford voted while in Congress against
the release to Congress of the Pentagon
Papers. In 1974, Ford vetoed amend
ments to the 1966 Freedom of Informa
tion Act that placed on the government
the burden of proof to show that secret
documents were legitimately clas
sified and required the opening of any
agency investigative files.
Ford has as president recommended
legislation that would be the equiva
lent of the British Official Secrets Act.
It would provide criminal penalties for
disclosing "information relating to in
telligence sources and methods."
Ford's proposed law also shores up the
executive's power to enjoin the publi
cation of such information. In practice
during the Watergate scandal and
a CIA investigation, "sources and
methods" has served as an elastic
category used by persons and agencies
under investigation to protect them
selves.
On the right to privacy, Ford op
posed Lyndon Johnson's 1967 prop
osal to ban most governmental and
private electronic eavesdropping. He
spoke out in favor of wiretapping in
the debate over the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968
and the District of Columbia Court Re
form and Criminal Procedure Act of
1970.
Concerning internal security and

civil liberties, the Ford Administra
tion's Justice Department released on
March 10 a set of guidelines on be
havior for the FBI. Under the
guidelines, FBI agents would be al
lowed, when authorized by FBI head
quarters, to infiltrate groups, use elec
tronic surveillance, and examine the
outside of suspects' mail.
On Feb. 18, Ford announced a prog
ram to reform the U.S. foreign intelli
gence agencies. Concerning foreign
activities of the CIA, Ford did not re
commend any substantive restriction
upon covert activities abroadâ€” except
a ban on peacetime assassination.
Concerning the domestic activities
of the U.S. foreign intelligence agen
cies, Ford's plan permits collection of
information on any citizen whose
domestic activities are picked up in
the foreign intelligence collection
processes of the CIA and the military
intelligence agencies, on any person
connected with the CIA via present or
past employment or contracts, or on
persons who are reasonably believed
to be "potential sources or contacts."
In other words, virtually everybody.
Ford's plan on foreign intelligence
as embodied in the Foreign Intelli
gence Surveillance Act (S. 3197) al
lows unrestricted domestic surveil
lance whenever new equipment is
being tested.
The Ford Administration has sup
ported passage of S.l, the proposed re
form of the U.S. Criminal Code, which
includes an Official Secrets Act, cur
tailment of freedom of assembly,
open-ended wiretapping provisions, a
Nuremberg defense for government of
ficials who can claim that they only
followed orders, and a drastic hike in
the penalties for trafficking in
marijuana.
Concerning abortion and a woman's
right to ownership of her own body,
Ford said in a television interview on
Feb. 3, that he did not believe in "abor
tion on demand" and did not agree
with the Supreme Court's 1973 deci
sion on abortion. He favors a constitu
tional amendment giving the states
discretion to restrict abortion.
Ford went along with Richard Nix
on's program of wage and price con
trols. He said of the Phase II program:
"Let me emphasize that our price and
wage controls are working." In April
1973, Ford voted to extend for one year
the president's authority over wages
and prices.
In agriculture, Ford has been a sup
porter of farm subsidies. For example,
in 1971, Ford voted against reducing

the maximum per crop payments from
$55,000 to $20,000.
Ford voted for a federal guarantee of
the $250 billion loan to bail out the
bankrupt Lockheed Aircraft Corpora
tion. Ford also voted for federal fund
ing of the development of the super
sonic transport (SST). Both votes were
direct attacks on the market system of
profit-and-loss and private entrep-
p.
In 1975, Ford authorized a three
year import quota program on five
types of European-produced stainless
and tool steel. Since then, he
negotiated a so-called "voluntary"
steel import agreement with Japan.
Both quota systems are direct attacks
upon freedom of international trade.
Their effect is to artificially raise prices
paid by consumers.
In his 1976 State of the Union ad
dress, Ford reiterated his support for a
national Energy Independence Au
thority. This public authority would
supervise a $100 billion program of
loan guarantees, grants, and price
supports proposed by Vice President
Nelson Rockefeller and aimed at the
protectionist and monopoly-creating
goal of energy self-sufficiency. How's

that for free enterprise?
During the Vietnam war, Ford was
among the first to call for bombing
North Vietnam (January 1965), protec
tive reaction strikes against missile
sites and airfields (July 1965), a naval
quarantine of North Vietnam (De
cember 1965), and bombing Hanoi and
Haiphong (June 1966).
Except for the scheduled
phasedown on Taiwan and the recent
pullout from Thailand, the Ford Ad
ministration favors no reduction of the
484,000-person U.S. military presence
outside U.S. borders.
Concerning the extent of the U.S. de
fense perimeter, Ford in May pledged
that the U.S. would be the "ultimate
guarantor" of the State of Israel. Fol
lowing the Oct. 22 Ford-Carter debate,
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger de
signated Yugoslavia and the People's
Republic of China as national security
interests of the United States. Kis
singer ranked these countries with the
NATO alliance in indicating their
military importance to the United
States.
