# Carter the ideal president?
## 
### 
Peter Stamos

As that long road to the White
House enters its closing hours,
we can safely expect to find both
presidential candidates using
any and all means to secure
those last crucial votes.
Admidst the vast barrage of
campaign gibberish and politi
cal mudslinging it unfortunately
becomes rather easy to lose sight
of the critical issue at hand
—namely, the selection of the
president.
John Kennedy, in 1960, spoke
of a new vision in American
presidential politics — one of
public concern, awareness and
involvement, with leaders
equally concerned and ready to
lead a young, growing, vibrant
nation.

However, when political
analysts predict a miserable 50
per cent voter turnout; when
voters slur the old excuses: "who
cares?—what's the differ
ence?—why vote?"; when
Playboy interviews become a
major campaign issue; and when
both candidates stoop down to
the desperate level of blasting
each other's personal morality
and integrity, one begins to
wonder if we haven't lost sight of
that vision Kennedy outlined.
Re-evaluation needed
It seems our perspectives and
criteria for decisions need re
evaluating.
American history reveals a
new breed of leaders. These men
were said to derive their author

ity from the people, and to repre
sent the spirit of the people they
served.
Thomas Jefferson represented
an America of human rights and
ideals. Andrew Jackson rep
resented an America of "true
democracy" and rule by the
people. Abraham Lincoln rep
resented an America of equality
and justice. Franklin Roosevelt
represented an America of con
cern for the common man, and
John Kennedy represented a
young, vibrant nation of in
volved citizens.
The interesting point is that
each man shares one common
characteristic — they were all
able to meet the demands of the
nation when America needed
them most. And in this sense we
can define the "ideal president."
Important choice
Clearly,the choice for the Pres
idency is an important one. We
must not merely elect "the best
President money can buy," but
rather must make some serious
value judgements regarding the
type of leader we, as citizens,
want to be associated with.
We must look behind the sur
face comments and political pos
itions being made by the candi
dates and view the more impor
tant issue — the type of nation
these men would represent, and
how each man would the prob
lems facing America today.
What are the demands, the
needs and the problems of 1976?
The whole issue focuses on mor
ality. There is a lack of morality
in foreign affairs with the Cent
ral Intelligence Agency's (CIA)
corrupting influence in Chile,
and with the memory of Vietnam
still on our minds.
Economic inequities
There are abundant economic
inequities in the nation which
reveal the present administra
tion's less than moral view to
wards the poor. Inflation and
unemployment are higher than
they've been in decades. The
poor, underprivileged and el
derly have been ignored by the
federal government, which
under Nixon and Ford has held
the philosophy that the way to
curb inflation is to maintain high
unemployment and to cut

domestic welfare, assistance and
education funds.
Finally, there is a general lack
of confidence in government
stemming from the repercus
sions of Watergate and the fact
that President Gerald Ford is still
the man Richard Nixon chose as
a successor.
Who can honestly see morality
in an administration that "un
conditionally" pardons former
President Nixon while his sub
ordinates face federal prison
terms?
Carter offers answers
In light of our present situa
tion it becomes clear that Jimmy
Carter offers better answers to
the problems we face.
The fact remains that the elec
tion of a Republican administra
tion will only guarantee "four
more years" of the same in
adequate policy that we have
have since 1969.
On the other hand, a Carter
administration would provide
an opportunity for change. Car
ter advocates a foreign policy
that would respect national
self-sovereignty, limit CIA
foreign involvement and prom
ote openness with regards to na
tional purpose in foreign affairs.
Carter would work towards
balancing economic inequities.
He feels that high unemploy
ment should not be used to curb
inflation, but rather that gov
ernment should provide a job for
every able American willing to
work.
Finally, and perhaps most im
portantly, Carter would attempt
to set a moral vision and tone for
the American people. Honestly,
openness and justice are what
Carter calls for.
Obviously, neither one of the
candidates could provide
"ideal" leadership and elimi
nate all the nation's problems, as
even "great" Presidents in the
past have had their faults, weak
nesses and limitations. But a
Carter presidency would at
tempt to provide a new morality,
thereby meeting a major demand
and need in America today. In
this sense Jimmy Carter would
approach the "ideal" President"
in 1976.

new breed of leaders. These men
were said to derive their author

ity from the people, and to repre
sent the spirit of the people they
served.
Thomas Jefferson represented
an America of human rights and
ideals. Andrew Jackson rep
resented an America of "true
democracy" and rule by the
people. Abraham Lincoln rep
resented an America of equality
and justice. Franklin Roosevelt
represented an America of con
cern for the common man, and
John Kennedy represented a
young, vibrant nation of in
volved citizens.
The interesting point is that
each man shares one common
characteristic — they were all
able to meet the demands of the
nation when America needed
them most. And in this sense we
can define the "ideal president."
Important choice
Clearly,the choice for the Pres
idency is an important one. We
must not merely elect "the best
President money can buy," but
rather must make some serious
value judgements regarding the
type of leader we, as citizens,
want to be associated with.
We must look behind the sur
face comments and political pos
itions being made by the candi
dates and view the more impor
tant issue — the type of nation
these men would represent, and
how each man would the prob
lems facing America today.
What are the demands, the
needs and the problems of 1976?
The whole issue focuses on mor
ality. There is a lack of morality
in foreign affairs with the Cent
ral Intelligence Agency's (CIA)
corrupting influence in Chile,
and with the memory of Vietnam
still on our minds.
Economic inequities
There are abundant economic
inequities in the nation which
reveal the present administra
tion's less than moral view to
wards the poor. Inflation and
unemployment are higher than
they've been in decades. The
poor, underprivileged and el
derly have been ignored by the
federal government, which
under Nixon and Ford has held
the philosophy that the way to
curb inflation is to maintain high
unemployment and to cut

domestic welfare, assistance and
education funds.
Finally, there is a general lack
of confidence in government
stemming from the repercus
sions of Watergate and the fact
that President Gerald Ford is still
the man Richard Nixon chose as
a successor.
Who can honestly see morality
in an administration that "un
conditionally" pardons former
President Nixon while his sub
ordinates face federal prison
terms?
Carter offers answers
In light of our present situa
tion it becomes clear that Jimmy
Carter offers better answers to
the problems we face.
The fact remains that the elec
tion of a Republican administra
tion will only guarantee "four
more years" of the same in
adequate policy that we have
have since 1969.
On the other hand, a Carter
administration would provide
an opportunity for change. Car
ter advocates a foreign policy
that would respect national
self-sovereignty, limit CIA
foreign involvement and prom
ote openness with regards to na
tional purpose in foreign affairs.
Carter would work towards
balancing economic inequities.
He feels that high unemploy
ment should not be used to curb
inflation, but rather that gov
ernment should provide a job for
every able American willing to
work.
Finally, and perhaps most im
portantly, Carter would attempt
to set a moral vision and tone for
the American people. Honestly,
openness and justice are what
Carter calls for.
Obviously, neither one of the
candidates could provide
"ideal" leadership and elimi
nate all the nation's problems, as
even "great" Presidents in the
past have had their faults, weak
nesses and limitations. But a
Carter presidency would at
tempt to provide a new morality,
thereby meeting a major demand
and need in America today. In
this sense Jimmy Carter would
approach the "ideal" President"
in 1976.

As that long road to the White
House enters its closing hours,
we can safely expect to find both
presidential candidates using
any and all means to secure
those last crucial votes.
Admidst the vast barrage of
campaign gibberish and politi
cal mudslinging it unfortunately
becomes rather easy to lose sight
of the critical issue at hand
—namely, the selection of the
president.
John Kennedy, in 1960, spoke
of a new vision in American
presidential politics — one of
public concern, awareness and
involvement, with leaders
equally concerned and ready to
lead a young, growing, vibrant
nation.

However, when political
analysts predict a miserable 50
per cent voter turnout; when
voters slur the old excuses: "who
cares?—what's the differ
ence?—why vote?"; when
Playboy interviews become a
major campaign issue; and when
both candidates stoop down to
the desperate level of blasting
each other's personal morality
and integrity, one begins to
wonder if we haven't lost sight of
that vision Kennedy outlined.

how each man would the prob
lems facing America today.
What are the demands, the
needs and the problems of 1976?
The whole issue focuses on mor
ality. There is a lack of morality
in foreign affairs with the Cent
ral Intelligence Agency's (CIA)
corrupting influence in Chile,
and with the memory of Vietnam
still on our minds.
Economic inequities
There are abundant economic
inequities in the nation which
reveal the present administra
tion's less than moral view to
wards the poor. Inflation and
unemployment are higher than
they've been in decades. The
poor, underprivileged and el
derly have been ignored by the
federal government, which
under Nixon and Ford has held
the philosophy that the way to
curb inflation is to maintain high
unemployment and to cut

domestic welfare, assistance and
education funds.
Finally, there is a general lack
of confidence in government
stemming from the repercus
sions of Watergate and the fact
that President Gerald Ford is still
the man Richard Nixon chose as
a successor.
Who can honestly see morality
in an administration that "un
conditionally" pardons former
President Nixon while his sub
ordinates face federal prison
terms?
Carter offers answers
In light of our present situa
tion it becomes clear that Jimmy
Carter offers better answers to
the problems we face.
The fact remains that the elec
tion of a Republican administra
tion will only guarantee "four
more years" of the same in
adequate policy that we have
have since 1969.
On the other hand, a Carter
administration would provide
an opportunity for change. Car
ter advocates a foreign policy
that would respect national
self-sovereignty, limit CIA
foreign involvement and prom
ote openness with regards to na
tional purpose in foreign affairs.
Carter would work towards
balancing economic inequities.
He feels that high unemploy
ment should not be used to curb
inflation, but rather that gov
ernment should provide a job for
every able American willing to
work.
Finally, and perhaps most im
portantly, Carter would attempt
to set a moral vision and tone for
the American people. Honestly,
openness and justice are what
Carter calls for.
Obviously, neither one of the
candidates could provide
"ideal" leadership and elimi
nate all the nation's problems, as
even "great" Presidents in the
past have had their faults, weak
nesses and limitations. But a
Carter presidency would at
tempt to provide a new morality,
thereby meeting a major demand
and need in America today. In
this sense Jimmy Carter would
approach the "ideal" President"
in 1976.

As that long road to the White
House enters its closing hours,
we can safely expect to find both
presidential candidates using
any and all means to secure
those last crucial votes.
Admidst the vast barrage of
campaign gibberish and politi
cal mudslinging it unfortunately
becomes rather easy to lose sight
of the critical issue at hand
—namely, the selection of the
president.
John Kennedy, in 1960, spoke
of a new vision in American
presidential politics — one of
public concern, awareness and
involvement, with leaders
equally concerned and ready to
lead a young, growing, vibrant
nation.

However, when political
analysts predict a miserable 50
per cent voter turnout; when
voters slur the old excuses: "who
cares?—what's the differ
ence?—why vote?"; when
Playboy interviews become a
major campaign issue; and when
both candidates stoop down to
the desperate level of blasting
each other's personal morality
and integrity, one begins to
wonder if we haven't lost sight of
that vision Kennedy outlined.
Re-evaluation needed
It seems our perspectives and
criteria for decisions need re
evaluating.
American history reveals a
new breed of leaders. These men
were said to derive their author

ity from the people, and to repre
sent the spirit of the people they
served.
Thomas Jefferson represented
an America of human rights and
ideals. Andrew Jackson rep
resented an America of "true
democracy" and rule by the
people. Abraham Lincoln rep
resented an America of equality
and justice. Franklin Roosevelt
represented an America of con
cern for the common man, and
John Kennedy represented a
young, vibrant nation of in
volved citizens.
The interesting point is that
each man shares one common
characteristic — they were all
able to meet the demands of the
nation when America needed
them most. And in this sense we
can define the "ideal president."
Important choice
Clearly,the choice for the Pres
idency is an important one. We
must not merely elect "the best
President money can buy," but
rather must make some serious
value judgements regarding the
type of leader we, as citizens,
want to be associated with.
We must look behind the sur
face comments and political pos
itions being made by the candi
dates and view the more impor
tant issue — the type of nation
these men would represent, and
how each man would the prob
lems facing America today.
