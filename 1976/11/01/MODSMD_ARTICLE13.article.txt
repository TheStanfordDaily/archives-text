As many may already be
aware, the recent World Bank
Conference in Manila revealed
again the harrowing reality to
which much of the world is sub
ject. In his opening address to
1500 leaders of international fi
nance and banking, World Bank
President Robert McNamara de
scribed the plight of those who
live in "absolute poverty."
He said, "malnutrition saps
their energy, stunts their bodies,
and shortens their lives. Illiter
acy darkens their minds and
forecloses their futures. Squalor
and ugliness pollute and poison
their surroundings."
This enormous tragedy con
demns at least 750 million
people with an average per
capita income of less than $100 a
year. Indeed, even after two Un
ited Nations' "decades of de
velopment" the situation grows
steadily worse. In McNamara's
own words: "The per capita in
comes of the more than one bill
ion human beings in the poorest
countries have nearly stagnated
over the past decade." And this
is in the face of unprecedented
world inflationary trends.
But the tragedy runs even
deeper. In our own country there

are 25.9 million people living at
or below the poverty lineaccord
i ng to the latest report of the U.S.
Census Bureau. That is 2.5 mill
ion more than in 1974. And con
trary to some arguments, the
bureau's definition of poverty
clearly rests on one bedrock var
iable: people must eat.
The juxtaposition of wealth
and poverty, waste and want,
added to the shocking reality de
scribed above, is especially dis
turbing because it threatens
most norms of human value. The
simple truth is that Stanford
University is not all that far from
East Palo Alto. Or, if you prefer,
military spending is increased
while social services are being
cut back. One would hope that
sometime soon we will realize
that people cannot live on nuc
lear warheads alone.
In his moving address, how
ever, McNamara was doing more
than engaging our shame at the
brutality, injustice,and exploita
tion that infests the world — he
was eliciting our compassion
and subsequent action.
