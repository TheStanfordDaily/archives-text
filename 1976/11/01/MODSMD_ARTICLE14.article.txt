# Letters: 'misconceptions'
## 
### 
Strictly personal
My decision to agree to make a
brief statement on behalf of Pres
ident Gerald Ford in Los Angeles
last Tuesday seems to have gen
erated unexpectedly high levels
of misunderstanding and con
troversy. I would like to re
emphasize a few points I made
prior to my trip to L.A. in an ef
fort to clear up some of these ap
parent misconceptions.
First, as 1 have stated re
peatedly, my opinions concern
ing the presidential election are
strictly personal, and are in no
way meant to reflect those of
Stanford, the ASSU or even the
Council of Presidents. To believe
otherwise is to believe that Gov.
Jerry Brown's endorsement of
Jimmy Carter is representative of
the entire citizenry of California.
Second, 1 had never thought of
my support of Ford as an "en
dorsement," primarily because I
am unable to ascertain how an
endorsement on my part could
favorably influence the results of
the election for Ford. Such influ
ence is far beyond the
capabilities of a lowly ASSU
president.

Inevitable consequences
Those who advocate voting for
Eugene McCarthy as a form of
protest should face up to the in
evitable consequences. If Presi
dent Gerald Ford wins the elec
tion because McCarthy takes
votes from Jimmy Carter, the re
sult will not be interpreted as a
protest.
It will be hailed around the
world as a victory and a vindica
tion for the Nixon-Ford policies
of the past eight years. Under
Nixon and Ford, the United
States has been the mainstay of
military dictatorships from
Chile to Iran. Carter has firmly
opposed support for such re
gimes.
Certainly the election of Ford
will close the door on any hope
for the thousands now in prison
as political dissenters in these
countries.
This issue, and others, were
important enough this year to

former McCarthy supporters so
that 59 leaders of his 1968 cam
paign recently took a full page ad
in the New Republic, which said,
in part: "We have a healthy skep
ticism toward our political sys
tem. Most of us have worked in
the movement against the Viet
nam war, for civil rights, against
government-sponsored subver
sion abroad and spying at home.
"But our ideas are now wel
come in the Democratic Party.
(Carter's) opposition to the pre
cipitous use of nuclear pow
er, .. . to American support for
dictatorships abroad, . . . and to
America's becoming the arms
merchant of the world . . . make
him a candidate we can sup
port ... If we are to have a
chance to put our ideas into ef
fect, we must have a Democratic
President."

Electoral dilemma
An electoral dilemma! What
do I do if I dread President
Gerald Ford continuing in office,
but I'm turned off by so many of
Jimmy Carter's statements? If I

cast my vote for some other can
didate, 1 may succeed in register
ing my displeasure, but 1 give a
free vote to Ford in the process. !
gave one to Nixon in '6B when 1
refused to vote for a hawkish
Humphrey, and oh was I sorry!
My way out of the predica
ment is as follows. 1 just wrote a
letter to Robert Strauss, Chair
man, Democratic National
Committee, 1625 Mass. AveNW,
Washington, D.C., 20036. 1 told
him I'm voting for Carter mainly
to vote against Ford, and 1 expect
better next time.

Tuesday, then the 26 per cent of
the people who think what's
good for General Motors is good
for the country can end up with a
majority of the votes. Since they
already have the economic
power, they don't deserve the
political power, too.
It won't be so bad electing Car
ter. I'll be glad to see an en
vironmentalist in the White
House. Jobs bills won't be vetoed
any more. Who knows? Maybe
many years of mediocre presi
dents have dulled my senses and
1 don't recognize a good leader
when 1 see him any more.

Electoral dilemma

My way out of the predica

letter to Robert Strauss, Chair
man, Democratic National
Committee, 1625 Mass. AveNW,

to vote against Ford, and 1 expect

Strictly personal
My decision to agree to make a
brief statement on behalf of Pres
ident Gerald Ford in Los Angeles
last Tuesday seems to have gen
erated unexpectedly high levels
of misunderstanding and con
troversy. I would like to re
emphasize a few points I made
prior to my trip to L.A. in an ef
fort to clear up some of these ap
parent misconceptions.
First, as 1 have stated re
peatedly, my opinions concern
ing the presidential election are
strictly personal, and are in no
way meant to reflect those of
Stanford, the ASSU or even the
Council of Presidents. To believe
otherwise is to believe that Gov.
Jerry Brown's endorsement of
Jimmy Carter is representative of
the entire citizenry of California.
Second, 1 had never thought of
my support of Ford as an "en
dorsement," primarily because I
am unable to ascertain how an
endorsement on my part could
favorably influence the results of
the election for Ford. Such influ
ence is far beyond the
capabilities of a lowly ASSU
president.
