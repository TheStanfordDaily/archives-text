# Brick wall may hide da Vinci painting
## 
### 
Florence, Italy (AH) — Travers Newton has been spending his
days rapping on a wall with his bare fist, but he is confident his
sore knuckles and some sophisticated sonar equipment uMI
eventually locate a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci.
Newton is part of an American team which launched the
search 10 days ago in the great council hall of the Florence
municipal palace.
Members of the team have already discovered that there is a
brick wall behind a fresco by Giorgio Vasari, and they believe
the wall was put up by the 16th century painter out of respect foi
a fellow artist whose work he dared not destroy. A small inscrip
tion in Vasari's painting — "Cerca, Trova" or seek and you will
find — is a piece of "Renaissance humor" that helps convince
them they are looking in the right spot for Leonardo's "Battle ol
Angiari."
Leonardo began the work in 1505 under contract with the Re
public of Florence but never finished it. Records of the time
indicate the fragment was admired as one of his most important
paintings and preserved for up to 50 years, despite a change in
politics that destroyed the republic it glorified.
Vasari was given the job of remodeling the hall in 1563 and
the Leonardo disappeared, either destroyed or preserved intact
behind a special wall.
"I'd like to believe the latter," says Newton, 25, an art restora
tion expert from Los Angeles. His knuckles rapping is to look for
hollow spaces and flaws in the Vasari, which must be treated to
preserve it from harm during the search.
Newton says it would be simpler and less costly to cut a hole
in the Vasari, which could be replaced later, and look behind it.
"But no one is able or willing to give us permission to do this,"
he said.
