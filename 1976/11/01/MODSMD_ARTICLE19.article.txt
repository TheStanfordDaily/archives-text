## Legality could force sale of land 
### Lonnie Rosenwald News analysis 
"Land condemnation" is a term
usually associated with deteriorating
slums, health hazards and other threats to a
community. However, it is equally legiti
mate for a court to condemn pastoral uni
versity acreage lyinj» dormant.
In legal terms, condemnation means the
"exercise of the power of eminent domain,"
according to Menlo Park City Attorney Jack
Jorgenson.
The notion of land condemnation was
raised in respect to the city's intention to
aquire 367 acres of university lands located
west of Interstate 280, between Sand Hill
and Whiskey Hill Roads. The university has
indicated that it is prohibted from selling its
lands under terms of the founding grant.
Menlo Park has earlier indicated it might
resort to condemnation as a legal means to
require a sale.
Condemnation is "a power given to a
government agency to acquire land for a
public purpose," said Jorgenson. The land
involved would be developed by Menlo
Park for a municipal golf course.
So far Menlo Park has taken no legal steps
to condemn the land. "It's one of the options
that s available, but it's down the road,"
Jorgenson noted.
"We're primarily interested in leasing the
land," he added.
University officials have indicated their
reluctance to lease lands for public pur

poses because it may be difficult for the
university to reclaim the land for academic
development in the future.
According to the university's policy,
leasers reserve the right to reacquire lands
in such cases. However, such anattempt has
aroused public resistance in the university's
current effort to limit public access to
Searsville Lake.
Jorgensen indicated Menlo Park's wil
lingness to abide by the university's leasing
policy. "We recognize that the university's
primary business is to be an educutional
institution. . . Academic interests come
first over a golf course," he said.
Menlo Park has condemned university

lands in the past. For the widening of Sand
Hill Road in 1970 the city condemned ac
reage it needed tor construction.
Besdies forcing sale, condemnation pro
ceedings also serve as a legal means to fix
the price of land parcels. Each party asses
ses land value and the court sets the proper
price of sale.
Jorgenson said that San Mateo County as
sessments ot the different acres involved in
this case run as high as $10,000 per acre.
The Menlo Park ci ty council has directed
its staff to approach the university with an
offer to lease or purchase the property.
Should such efforts fail, then the city will
consider condemnation proceedings.

"Land condemnation" is a term
usually associated with deteriorating
slums, health hazards and other threats to a
community. However, it is equally legiti
mate for a court to condemn pastoral uni
versity acreage lyinj» dormant.
In legal terms, condemnation means the
"exercise of the power of eminent domain,"
according to Menlo Park City Attorney Jack
Jorgenson.
The notion of land condemnation was
raised in respect to the city's intention to
aquire 367 acres of university lands located
west of Interstate 280, between Sand Hill
and Whiskey Hill Roads. The university has
indicated that it is prohibted from selling its
lands under terms of the founding grant.
Menlo Park has earlier indicated it might
resort to condemnation as a legal means to
require a sale.
Condemnation is "a power given to a
government agency to acquire land for a
public purpose," said Jorgenson. The land
involved would be developed by Menlo
Park for a municipal golf course.
So far Menlo Park has taken no legal steps
to condemn the land. "It's one of the options
that s available, but it's down the road,"
Jorgenson noted.
"We're primarily interested in leasing the
land," he added.
University officials have indicated their
reluctance to lease lands for public pur

poses because it may be difficult for the
university to reclaim the land for academic
development in the future.
According to the university's policy,
leasers reserve the right to reacquire lands
in such cases. However, such anattempt has
aroused public resistance in the university's
current effort to limit public access to
Searsville Lake.
