## Hill breaks record as Cards break OSU, 24-3 New marks leave Hill speechless 
### Chris Baker 
It was a clay for records.
Stanford flanker Tony Hill be
came the leading receiver in the
school's history, raising his
career total to 126 catches, as the
Cards beat Oregon State 24-3
Saturday. Hill broke Gene
Washington's 122 mark, set in
1966-68.
The senior from Long Beach
also caught the 14th and 15th
touchdown passes of his career,
breaking Bill McColl's record of
14. Hill's career stats, with three
games remaining, are 126 recep
tions for 2023 yards.
A record number of Oregon
State players (eight) limped, or
were carried, off the field. "I'm
afraid to go to our trainer," said
first-year OSU coach Craig Fer
tig after the contest.
Speechless
Hill, who caught four passes
for 68 yards and two
touchdowns to set the new
career reception and touchdown
standards, was almost at a loss
tor words.
"I think I've used every quota
tion. I've been preparing to break
the records, but I left my speech
in the locker room.
"I was extremely happy to
break two great records set by
two great people," said Hill. "I'd
like to increase the records so

they'll be there for a long time."
Freak accident
Hill almost never got a chance
to break the marks. "I didn't
know until I got on the field this
morning whether I'd be able to
play. I didn't think I'd be able to
when I reinjured my ankle yes
terday (Friday).
"A girl ran into me outside my
poli sci class," said Hill. "It hurts
me a lot playing on it. I haven't
let it heal. I'm confident about it.
If I start thinking about it. I'll
drop passes."
Hill, like Washington, was a
prep quarterback at Long Beach
Poly. He erased all of
Washington's prep marks and is
now doing the same thing on the
Farm.
Hill broke Washington's re
cord with his first catch of the
contest — an 18 yarder from
quarterback Guy Benjamin. His
McColl-tying catch came with
2:08 left in the first quarter — a
16-yard touchdown. Hill's
6-yard touchdown ignited a 17-
point (and fourth quarter) rally.
Two touchdowns
"Of the touchdowns that I've
scored," said Hill, "these two
stick out in my mind. The first
one hit me as unusual, right on
the nose and I was wide open.
"The second one, I ran right
under it. It was a beautiful pass,"

said Hill. "I don't think in terms
of records, so it takes a lot of
pressure off me that other people
face."
Hill's four catches forged him
further into the Stanford record
books, but four Oregon State
plays moved the Beavers further
into the loss column.
"Four big plays made the dif
ference." said Fertig. "Two fum
bles by us, a fourth-and-one that
didn't work and a ball that just
missed the finger tips of Wavne
Hall.
"On that pass to Hall, we
picked Stanford's defense up
pretty well. I think they rushed
everybody but (Card defensive
coordinator) Norb Hecker. It just
missed," said the first-year
Beaver coach.
"The way our kids fight and
hang in there, it makes you want
to cry. They played their hearts

out."
Ever since former USC coach
John McKay immortalized himself
with his infamous 2000-point
comment, there have never been
good relations between the
Cards and Trojans.
'Chris showed class*
Fertig, who wears two USC na
tional championship rings, the
rewards from his years as a Tro
jan assistant, said. "Jack Christ
iansen showed me a lot of class
by running late in the game. He
knew that we were broken up."
Oregon State has now been de
feated by USC and Stanford in
successive weekends. "Stanford
is the best passing team we've
faced all year," said P'ertig. "It's
hard to compare them with USC
— Stanford with their passing at
tack and USC is bigger and more
physical. It should be a real don
nybrook."

"The way our kids fight and
hang in there, it makes you want
to cry. They played their hearts

out."
Ever since former USC coach
John McKay immortalized himself
with his infamous 2000-point
comment, there have never been
good relations between the
Cards and Trojans.

Fertig, who wears two USC na
tional championship rings, the

Oregon State has now been de
feated by USC and Stanford in
successive weekends. "Stanford
is the best passing team we've
faced all year," said P'ertig. "It's
hard to compare them with USC
— Stanford with their passing at
tack and USC is bigger and more
physical. It should be a real don
nybrook."

win over the Beavers.
It was a clay for records.
Stanford flanker Tony Hill be
came the leading receiver in the
school's history, raising his
career total to 126 catches, as the
Cards beat Oregon State 24-3
Saturday. Hill broke Gene
Washington's 122 mark, set in
1966-68.
The senior from Long Beach
also caught the 14th and 15th
touchdown passes of his career,
breaking Bill McColl's record of
14. Hill's career stats, with three
games remaining, are 126 recep
tions for 2023 yards.
A record number of Oregon
State players (eight) limped, or
were carried, off the field. "I'm
afraid to go to our trainer," said
first-year OSU coach Craig Fer
tig after the contest.
Speechless
Hill, who caught four passes
for 68 yards and two
touchdowns to set the new
career reception and touchdown
standards, was almost at a loss
tor words.
"I think I've used every quota
tion. I've been preparing to break
the records, but I left my speech
in the locker room.
"I was extremely happy to
break two great records set by
two great people," said Hill. "I'd
like to increase the records so

they'll be there for a long time."
Freak accident
Hill almost never got a chance
to break the marks. "I didn't
know until I got on the field this
morning whether I'd be able to
play. I didn't think I'd be able to
when I reinjured my ankle yes
terday (Friday).
"A girl ran into me outside my
poli sci class," said Hill. "It hurts
me a lot playing on it. I haven't
let it heal. I'm confident about it.
If I start thinking about it. I'll
drop passes."
Hill, like Washington, was a
prep quarterback at Long Beach
Poly. He erased all of
Washington's prep marks and is
now doing the same thing on the
Farm.
Hill broke Washington's re
cord with his first catch of the
contest — an 18 yarder from
quarterback Guy Benjamin. His
McColl-tying catch came with
2:08 left in the first quarter — a
16-yard touchdown. Hill's
6-yard touchdown ignited a 17-
point (and fourth quarter) rally.
Two touchdowns
"Of the touchdowns that I've
scored," said Hill, "these two
stick out in my mind. The first
one hit me as unusual, right on
the nose and I was wide open.
"The second one, I ran right
under it. It was a beautiful pass,"

said Hill. "I don't think in terms
of records, so it takes a lot of
pressure off me that other people
face."
Hill's four catches forged him
further into the Stanford record
books, but four Oregon State
plays moved the Beavers further
into the loss column.
"Four big plays made the dif
ference." said Fertig. "Two fum
bles by us, a fourth-and-one that
didn't work and a ball that just
missed the finger tips of Wavne
Hall.
"On that pass to Hall, we
picked Stanford's defense up
pretty well. I think they rushed
everybody but (Card defensive
coordinator) Norb Hecker. It just
missed," said the first-year
Beaver coach.

2:08 left in the first quarter — a
16-yard touchdown. Hill's
6-yard touchdown ignited a 17-
point (and fourth quarter) rally.
Two touchdowns
"Of the touchdowns that I've
scored," said Hill, "these two
stick out in my mind. The first
one hit me as unusual, right on
the nose and I was wide open.
"The second one, I ran right
under it. It was a beautiful pass,"

said Hill. "I don't think in terms
of records, so it takes a lot of
pressure off me that other people
face."
Hill's four catches forged him
further into the Stanford record
books, but four Oregon State
plays moved the Beavers further
into the loss column.
"Four big plays made the dif
ference." said Fertig. "Two fum
bles by us, a fourth-and-one that
didn't work and a ball that just
missed the finger tips of Wavne
Hall.
"On that pass to Hall, we
picked Stanford's defense up
pretty well. I think they rushed
everybody but (Card defensive
coordinator) Norb Hecker. It just
missed," said the first-year
Beaver coach.
"The way our kids fight and
hang in there, it makes you want
to cry. They played their hearts

out."
Ever since former USC coach
John McKay immortalized himself
with his infamous 2000-point
comment, there have never been
good relations between the
Cards and Trojans.
'Chris showed class*
Fertig, who wears two USC na
tional championship rings, the
rewards from his years as a Tro
jan assistant, said. "Jack Christ
iansen showed me a lot of class
by running late in the game. He
knew that we were broken up."
Oregon State has now been de
feated by USC and Stanford in
successive weekends. "Stanford
is the best passing team we've
faced all year," said P'ertig. "It's
hard to compare them with USC
— Stanford with their passing at
tack and USC is bigger and more
physical. It should be a real don
nybrook."
