# Stanford cracks Beavers with 17-point rally
## 
### Paul Bauman 
Tony Hill broke two all-time team records and
Stanford broke out of a three-quarter scoring
slump as the Cardinals defeated Oregon State,
24-3, Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
Hill's first catch of the game, the 123 rd of his
career, moved him past Gene Washington's
former record of 122 receptions.
The Card senior also caught his 14th and 15th
career touchdown passes to break the old record
of 14 set by Bill McColl in 1949-51. McColl
watched the game from the press box.
17-point rally
Records aside, there was a game to be won
Saturday, which Stanford finally realized in the
fourth quarter. The Cards toyed around with Ore
gon State for three quarters before getting serious
and scoring 17 points in the final period.
Stanford accomplished the near-impossible by
keeping the game close for the first 45 minutes,
leading just 7-3. This was against a 1-6 team
which saw at least six starters leave the game with
injuries. Prior to Saturday, Oregon State already
had eight players out for the year.
Stanford had little trouble moving the ball
throughout thegame, but it wasn't until the fourth
quarter that the Cards could maintain any
touchdown drives. Their only score before then
was virtually handed to them when Beaver tail
back James Fields fumbled at Stanford's lb-yard
line in the first quarter. Guy Benjamin threw a
touchdown pass to Hill on the next play.
The Cards got inside Oregon State's 40-yard
line five times in the first three periods without
scoring any points. The Beavers were responsible
only once—when they stopped Stanford on its
two-yard line on the Card's opening series. Stan
ford stopped itself the other four times with un
timely penalties, interceptions and dropped pas
ses — "stupid things" Benjamin called them.
'Mental mistakes'
"It wasn't as much a problem of moving the
ball," said receiver Bill kellar, "as getting penal
ties and having to do it over again."
Kellar said the Cards had another problem, too.
'I can't help but think that we had some
thoughts of the big game next week against SC,"
he said. "Whether or not anybody wants to admit
it, I think it was in the back of our minds."
If we ever stop the mental mistakes," Benjamin
said, "we'll have an awesome attack. We should
have scored 50 or 60 points."
Maybe so, but the way the Oregon State offense
was going, almost anything would have done.
The Beaver's only points came on a 55-yard field
goal by Kieron Walford, who was born in Coven
try, England. It was the longest field goal in OSU
history by eight yards.
Fourth-string QB
Considering that the Beavers were starting their
fourth-string quarterback (the top three are all out
for the year with injuries) — freshman Scott
Richardson—nobody expected them to score
much.And when Richardson re-sprained an ankle
late in the first quarter and left the game for good,
it looked as if the only way Oregon State was
going to score a touchdown was. if the defense

intercepted a pass and ran it back all the way. It
almost did.
Early in the third quarter, with Stanford driv j
ing, OSI I safety Jay Locey intercepted a Benjamin
pass and returned it 34 yards to Stanford's 45.
Going to the option attack, Dave White, the
Beaver's fifth-string QB, got Oregon State down to
the Cards' eight-yard line.
1 his was the Beaver's chance to take the lead
and give Stanford some real worries. They blew
it, which is not altogether strange for Oregon
State, l ields committed his second fumble of the
day, this one on a pitch-out, and Card Duncan
McColl recovered.
Stanford dominates
After that, it was all Stanford. Oregon State got
one first down and never advanced past its own 38
in the last 18 minutes ot the game.
Meanwhile, Stanford was finally getting its act
together on offense. Mike Michel kicked a 34-yard
field goal early in the fourth quarter to give Stan
ford a 10-3 lead. I hen the Cards generated their
only long TD drive of the afternoon — a 69-yarder.
The big plays were a 29-yard pass to Kellar, a
15-yard run by Gary Lynn and, of course, the
touchdown itself. Benjamin lobbed a pass from
six yards out towards the corner of the end-zone
and Hill niade a beautiful catch.
Stanford 17, Oregon State 3.
I he Cards got good field position on their next
possession and eventually scored on the same
pass pattern as before. This time James Lofton
made a fine grab over an OSU defender.
1 he 1 D passes to Hill and Lofton both came on
third downs. Stanford scores when it has to
against a Pacific-8 northern team. The Cards just
took their time Saturday.
One-sided stats
The statistics were one-sided all day even
though the score wasn't. Stanford finished with
446 total yards and 25 first downs; OSU had 182
and 10. The Beavers gained just 71 yards in the
second half.
Benjamin's stats, although very good, don't suf
ficiently describe an excellent performance. Al
most all of his passes were meticulously placed.
As Hill said about his first touchdown pass in the
first quarter, "It hit me as usual, right on the
nose." It's no fluke that Benjamin is the highest
percentage passer in Stanford history.
Lqually outstanding was McColl on defense.
I he senior defensive end led both teams with 15
assisted or unassisted tackles, caused one fumble,
recovered two fumbles and deflected one pass.
McColl and his co-linemen kept heavy pressure
on Oregon State's quarterbacks, helping limit
them to seven completions for 80 yards.
The Beavers' offense, what little of it there was,
consisted of Fields, who carried 25 times for 79
yards. Not too bad behind an injury-plagued line.
Fullback Steve Bozan. who pinched a nerweinhis
left arm, was the next busiest OSU back with five
carries.
Stanford gained 185 yards rushing on 48 car
ries, for a respectable 3.85 average. Ron Inge
showed some speed and some moves in leading
the team with 63 rushing yards on just 10 carries.


Congratulations
Quarterback Guy Benjamin offers flanker Tony Hill his congratulations, after Hill broke Gene
Washington's Stanford career reception mark in the first quarter of the Cards' 24-3 win over
OSU. Hill's four catches pushed the mark to 126 catches.
