# Cards down NCAA champion
## Poloists erupt for 5 goals, sink Cal 
### Chris Kamel 
"We have to establish that
we can beat them, because we
will have to meet them twice
more if we make it to the
NCAA playoffs," said Stan
ford water polo coach Art
Lambert before Saturday's
meeting between the Cards
and three-time NCAA water
polo champion California.
Well, it took Stanford about
22 minutes but the Cards left
no question that they can
manhandle the Bears as they
beat Cal 9-3 at deCuerre.
The win avenged Stan
ford's 4-3 loss to the Bears last
month, in the finals of the
NorCal Aquatics Tourna
ment.
Ahead by a slim 4-3 mar

gin, after three quarters of
what Lambert termed a
"sloppy" game, the Cards
exploded for five fourth
period goals to blow the Bears
back to Berkeley.
"One minute we were in it,
the next we were out," said an
unbelieving Cal coach Pete
Cutino. "That's been our pat
tern the last two weeks."
Cutino was referring to the
Bears' loss to UCLA Oct. 23.
The Bruins, possibly upset by
their 11-6 loss to the Cards the
day before, took their aggres
sions out on Cal, handing the
Bears a 12-6 loss.
Early lead
Cal came out ready for
Stanford, as the Bears played a
very physical game from the

outset. It paid off as Cal en
joyed its only lead ot the
game, a 1-0 margin, after the
first quarter.
This is not to say that the
Cards didn't have their
chances. In the opening
period, which Lambert called
a "land of missed oppor
tunities," Stanford blew
many scoring possibilities.
"This game was critical to
Cal and they played like it."
said Lambert. "They were
physical as hell." This was
most aptly illustrated by the
Cards having to make three
swimsuit changes due to torn
suits.
Officiating
But, to the pleasure of the
third-year Stanford coach, the

Cards 'stuck it right back to
them. Lambert noted that
the officiating was unusually
loose.
Stanford s aggressive play
set the Bears up with two
penalty shots, but goalie
Chris Dorst, who had had two
penalty blocks against UCLA,
duplicated his earlier per
formance.
"Chris is a tremendous
goalie," said Lambert. "1
think he is by far one of the
best goalies in college water
polo this year."
Sparked by Dorst's play,
the Cards came back to take a
3-2 halftime lead and then
keep that one goal edge at 4-3,
going into the final quarter.
Fireworks
Enter the fireworks.
"Right before (the fourth
quarter) I told them to keep
doing what they were doing
and the ball would fall (in the
goal)," said Lambert.
Well, the Cards followed
Lambert's advice and the ball
fell. In fact, at times it looked
like the Cards were shooting
at an open net, as good passes
set up shots that found the
holes in the Bear defense.
Rick Johannsen's two goals
led the five goal eruption.
Drew McDonald, Doug
Burke, and Paul Clark added a
goal each.
"I just wish we would be a
little consistent," said Lam
bert. 'I don't like to have to
climb out of a hole." Indeed
Lambert's concerns were jus
tified, as the Cards made a
habit of climbing out of holes
this weekend.
Possibly looking ahead to
Cal, the Cards found them
selves trailing UC-Santa Bar
bara 4-2 early in Friday's con
test.
But the Cards exploded,
after trailing 4-3 at intermis
sion, and won the game, 9-6.


Defense
Card poloist Rick Johannsen defends against a submerged Cal player in Stanford's 9-3 win
over the defending NCAA water polo champions Saturday. The Cards exploded for five

habit of climbing out of holes
this weekend.
Possibly looking ahead to
Cal, the Cards found them
selves trailing UC-Santa Bar

But the Cards exploded,
after trailing 4-3 at intermis
sion, and won the game, 9-6.


Defense
Card poloist Rick Johannsen defends against a submerged Cal player in Stanford's 9-3 win
over the defending NCAA water polo champions Saturday. The Cards exploded for five
goals in the fourth quarter.
"We have to establish that
we can beat them, because we
will have to meet them twice
more if we make it to the
NCAA playoffs," said Stan
ford water polo coach Art
Lambert before Saturday's
meeting between the Cards
and three-time NCAA water
polo champion California.
Well, it took Stanford about
22 minutes but the Cards left
no question that they can
manhandle the Bears as they
beat Cal 9-3 at deCuerre.
The win avenged Stan
ford's 4-3 loss to the Bears last
month, in the finals of the
NorCal Aquatics Tourna
ment.
Ahead by a slim 4-3 mar

gin, after three quarters of
what Lambert termed a
"sloppy" game, the Cards
exploded for five fourth
period goals to blow the Bears
back to Berkeley.
"One minute we were in it,
the next we were out," said an
unbelieving Cal coach Pete
Cutino. "That's been our pat
tern the last two weeks."
Cutino was referring to the
Bears' loss to UCLA Oct. 23.
The Bruins, possibly upset by
their 11-6 loss to the Cards the
day before, took their aggres
sions out on Cal, handing the
Bears a 12-6 loss.
Early lead
Cal came out ready for
Stanford, as the Bears played a
very physical game from the

outset. It paid off as Cal en
joyed its only lead ot the
game, a 1-0 margin, after the
first quarter.
This is not to say that the
Cards didn't have their
chances. In the opening
period, which Lambert called
a "land of missed oppor
tunities," Stanford blew
many scoring possibilities.
"This game was critical to
Cal and they played like it."
said Lambert. "They were
physical as hell." This was
most aptly illustrated by the
Cards having to make three
swimsuit changes due to torn
suits.
Officiating
But, to the pleasure of the
third-year Stanford coach, the

Cards 'stuck it right back to
them. Lambert noted that
the officiating was unusually
loose.
Stanford s aggressive play
set the Bears up with two
penalty shots, but goalie
Chris Dorst, who had had two
penalty blocks against UCLA,
duplicated his earlier per
formance.
"Chris is a tremendous
goalie," said Lambert. "1
think he is by far one of the
best goalies in college water
polo this year."
Sparked by Dorst's play,
the Cards came back to take a
3-2 halftime lead and then
keep that one goal edge at 4-3,
going into the final quarter.
Fireworks
Enter the fireworks.
"Right before (the fourth
quarter) I told them to keep
doing what they were doing
and the ball would fall (in the
goal)," said Lambert.
Well, the Cards followed
Lambert's advice and the ball
fell. In fact, at times it looked
like the Cards were shooting
at an open net, as good passes
set up shots that found the
holes in the Bear defense.
Rick Johannsen's two goals
led the five goal eruption.
Drew McDonald, Doug
Burke, and Paul Clark added a
goal each.
"I just wish we would be a
little consistent," said Lam
bert. 'I don't like to have to
