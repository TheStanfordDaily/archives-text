## USC spoils Cal's role 
### Marko Fong 
Whoever claimed that USC
has no tradition was obviously
not a Trojan football fan. Other
wise, he would have known
about the USC tailback tradi
tion.
Dating back to Frank Gifford
and Jon Arnett, the Trojans have
annually unveiled tailbacks who
have made even the most exces
sive sportswriting jargon, words
like stupendous, spectacular,
super and sensational, seem ap
propriate.
Although this has been the
season of the sensational Ricky
Bell, in Saturday's 20-6 win over
Cal, the Trojans let loose Bell's
stupendous heir apparent
Charles White.
While the Bears' defensive line
held Bell's panzer thrust to just
82 yards on 24 carries, it could
not contain White. The southern
California prep Athlete of the
Year blitzed behind the Bear de
fense for 91 yards on 14 carries.
While John Robinson's
blitzkrieg decimated Cal's Rose
Bown chances, coach Terry
Donahue's sleeping IJCLA
Bruins won a game in Seattle for
the first time in 16 years, dump
ing Washington 30-21.
UCLA displayed its concept of
a balanced attack, running in
side as well as outside with
Theotis ("Big Foot") scoring
three touchdowns and stomping
220 yards.

The Bruin rushing attack
burned the Dogs for 451 yards.
Washington managed to make
it close on two occasions.
Unfortunately for the Huskies,
UCLA answered promptly with
a Brown 51-yard touchdown
run, to put the game out of reach.
In the Washington State-
Oregon game, which is some
thing like a war between

Bangladesh and Biafra, Cougar
quarterback. Jack Thompson
hit tightend Eason Ransom
for a 14-yard touchdown with 19
seconds left and then connected
with Dan Doomick for the two
pointer to give Washington State
its first conference win 23-22.
Oregon has yet to win a
Pacific-8 football contest this
season.
