# Runners third in Pac-8 south

### Bruce Anderson 
The Stanford harriers finished
third behind California and
UCLA, in an unsuccessful de
fense of their Pacific-8 southern
division cross country title in
what coach Marshall Clark
termed, "the most disappointing
performance all season."
Saturday the Cardinals relin
quished the team title they cap
tured a year ago to California, as
junior Gary Blume headed the
Golden Bear victory by captur
ing the individual crown on the
6.2-mile UCLA course.
Blume covered the gruelling
Westwood course, which in
cludes two steep ascents up
Sunset Boulevard, with a win
ning time of 31:06.5. He held off
the challenge of runnerup Vic
ken Simonian of UCLA on the
way to his title.
Bruin second
Blume and his Bear team
mates, Martin Dean and Brad
Dufey who finished third and
fourth, paced the Cal squad to its
score of 29. The host Bruins
finished with a score of 43 and
Stanford brought up the rear
with 49.
Stanford captain Jeff Norton
led the Cards with a fifth-place
effort, covering the course in

31:51. Sophomore Jerry Emory
placed seventh with a time of
32:00. Clark called Emory's per
formance "one of his best ever."
Seniors Frank Boutin and Jeff
Pari etti placed tenth and
eleventh, respectively, with
times of 32:25 and 32:38. Junior
Wendell Birkhofer finished 15th
in 33:30, and Greg Eger and Bill
Haldeman finished 18th and
19th for the Cardinals.
'Broke down'
"We broke down completely,"
Clark said of the team's disap
pointing finish. "Our grouping
fell apart."
Clark explained that although
the Cards don't have the front
runners who are going to run
away with a race, they have been
able to compete well during the
season by finishing tightly
bunched.
The Cards do not have a meet
this weekend, as they take two
weeks to prepare for the
Pacitic-8 cross country champ
ionships run on the Stanford
Golf Course Nov. 13 at 10 a.m.
Clark said that for the Cards to
do well at the conference meet,
the team would have to restore
the tight grouping it had at
tained earlier in the season.
