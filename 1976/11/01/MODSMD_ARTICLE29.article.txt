Davis downs JV gridders
The Stanford JV gridders out
did their Davis hosts everywhere
but on the scoreboard Friday
evening, as the Cards outran,
outthrew, but failed to outscore
the Aggies in the 27-20 thriller.
Coach Don Frease's Cards led
the Davis team for 45 minutes,
but they allowed two fourth
quarter Davis touchdowns.
As time drained away, Stan
ford found itself only six yards
from the goal after a desperate
march that covered most of the
field in 1:30.
Freasesawthegameas"a very
finecontest. We played well,and

they capitalized on a few un
timely turnovers and unlucky
penalties to great advantage.
Their offense is very well ba
lanced."
Perfectly balanced might be
more appropriate, since the Ag
gies tossed and rushed for iden
tical 148-yard figures. Card quar
terback Joe Rominger completed
13 of 24 passes for 164 yards.
Gordie Banks churned out 131 of
Stanford's 258 rushing total.
Banks was the contest's leading
rusher..
The Cards leaped to a 14-7
halftime edge on runs of nine
and 33 yards from Banks and
Rich White.

Wide receiver Rick Parker
snagged a 40-yard floater from
Rominger, to complete Stan
ford's scoring.
The Cards, now 1-2, travel to
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo on
Friday.
