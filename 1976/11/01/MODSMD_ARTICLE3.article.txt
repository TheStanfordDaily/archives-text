# Hoover fellow predicts narrow victory
## Carter's coalition splintering in stretch 
### Mark Funk 
With the general election just one
day away, the Democratic coalition
which presidential candidate Jimmy
Carter attempted to forge is splinter
ing, but Seymour Martin Lipset, a
senior fellow in political science at the
Hoover Institute, says, "If I read my
polls right. Carter is still going to win."
Lipset speculates that a mistake in
Carter's initial campaign strategy after
the Democratic convention and the in

cumbency of President Cerald Ford
have combined to tighten the 1976
election.
Carter, lagging behind Ford by as
much as six per cent in the latest polls
taken in California, brought his cam
paign to San Francisco yesterday in a
last-ditch attempt to recapture part of
the commanding lead which has slip
ped away from the former Ceorgia
governor since July.
The shift in voter sentiment in

California toward Ford is parallel to
the trend in nationwide polls. Accord
ing to most of them, Carter's lead has
been cut significantly.
At least one poll, released Friday by
pollster Louis Harris, indicated Car
ter's lead has dwindled to just one per
cent. In contrast, Carter led Ford by 35
points right after the Democratic con
vention.
Disillusioned factions
Some of Carter's recent problems,
according to Lipset, have come be
cause different factions which make
up the Democratic party have become
disillusioned with their party's
nominee.
Lipset pointed out that Wallace
ites, blacks and other ethnic groups,
labor and liberals are all harbored
within the Democratic party and "Car
ter had them all together on the
podium during the convention."
"Both the Republicans and Democ
rats are made up of factions," Lipset
said. "The Democrats are the biggest
because they have the most factions.
You almost have to waffle to hold a
coalition of that size together."
'Couldn't hold together'
"Retrospectively, it couldn't hold
together." Lipset added. "It comes
down to a question of who do you keep
and who do you lose. I don't think Car
ter campaign thought in those terms."
Carter's major error, according to
Lipset, appears to have been a deci
sion by his advisers to court liberal
voters, a strategy which may have cost
him some support among conservative
Democrats.
Lipset added that he thought the
choice of Minnesota Sen. Walter Mon
dale was an indication the Carter cam
paign was attempting to solidify its
ties with the liberal element of the
party.

mund Muskie, a Catholic who would
have strengthened Carter's position
with that ethnic group.
)ews and liberals
"The (Carter) campaign went desp
erately after both Jews and liberals,"
Li pset said. "But the chances of losing
those two groups to Ford were small.
Where could they go but Carter? But
the Catholic ethnics, for instance, or
the Wallace-ites could be lost."
Lipset said when the Carter people
noticed a shift towards Ford from
those groups, they changed to a more
conservative strategy.
But that strategy did not help his
image among voters who perceived
the Democratic candidate as "flip
flopping" or hazy on issues.
Higher turnout
Lipset said that as the race has
grown closer during the past few
weeks, the chances for a higher voter
turnout have probably increased.
"Most people are aware that the
election is going to be close," Lipset
said. "It should activate pressure on
them to vote."
Lipset said that, in contrast to most
elections, the major candidates ap
peared to be riding the coattails of
local politicials. He used the 12th con
gressional district as an example.
Harris coattails
"As a result of David Harris, more
liberals and students will be voting.
The effort to register these voters is
going to help (John) Tunney (Democ
ratic candidate for U.S. Senate) and
Carter," Lipset said.
"In New York, the Carter people, al
though they did not say so, were wor
ried Bella Abzug (unsuccessful Senate
candidate in the Democratic primary)
might win." Lipset said. "They
wanted (Daniel Patrick) Moynihan

cause they thought he would attract

Lipsett cautioned that the polls
might not hold true on election day.
"If every person who was undecided
voted for the same person," he said,
"there would be a landslide. Of course
this won't happen."
However, he said two things could
happen. The voters could either opt for
incumbent Ford or vote on a party
basis — and "there are many more re
gistered Democrats than Republi
cans," Lipsett said.
