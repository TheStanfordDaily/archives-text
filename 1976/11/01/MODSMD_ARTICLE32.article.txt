San Jose State, the West
Coast's second-ranked soccer
team, handed Stanford a 3-0 loss
Friday at Harry Maloney Field.
"We played a great game for
65 minutes," said Card soccer
coach Nelson Lodge. "We
marked Easy Perez," added
Lodge. Perez, who led the nation
in scoring with 21 goals last
year, came into the contest with
15 markers.
"We figured the best thing to
do was to defend against them.
They countered very quickly by
putting three forwards on Bobby
Ceiger," said Lodge. San Jose
State blanked Ceiger, the Cards'
leading scorer.
"We learned quite a bit from
the game," said Lodge. "We
learned that we can't rely on
Bobby to carry us. We're going to
have to create another type of at
tack to go to, when they overplay
him."
Perez managed to break
through the Stanford defense to
set up Spartan teammate Stan
Swadley, to give San Jose State a
1-0 lead, with 25 minutes left in
the second half. Swadley added
San Jose's insurance goal.
"We never thought we were
out of it," said Lodge. The Cards
missed two scoring oppor
tunities in the first half. Their
best chance came when Ceiger
bounced a shot off the top of the
San Josegoal late in thefirst half.
Stanford changed formations
after the Spartans got off to a 3-0
lead, but it was too late. "We just
had a 25 minute breakdown,"
said Lodge.
San Jose State should move up

to the top spot because first
ranked Hayward State lost to
USF this weekend. Stanford was
ranked 14 on the West Coast in
last week's rankings.
Stanford, now 5-8-1 on the
year, hosts United States Inter
national University this after
noon at 3 p.m. on Harry Maloney
Field.

"1 don't know anything about
them," said Lodge. The Cards
have only one home match left
on the schedule after today's
contest.
Stanford travels to Stockton
for a 3 p.m. match with UOP
Saturday. The Cards entertain
USC Sunday at San Mateo.
