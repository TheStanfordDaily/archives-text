# Scotchers sweep San Diego teams
## 
### Debbie Carlton 
The Stanford field hockey
team survived a schizophrenic
weekend, brilliantly blitzing
UC-San Diego 5-0 Friday and
narrowly edging San Diego State
2-1 Saturday morning in San
Diego.
Scotchers' went into their first
contest with confidence and a
solid desire to come out on top.
Stanford set its own accelerated
pace, hustling the ball across
and down a field left open by San
Diego's bunching strategy.
The Cards lured UC-San
Diego's goalie from her cage
with threatening cross circle
shots, allowing sophomore wing
Helen Hunt to score on a de
flected shot off the goalie's pads.
Halftime lead
Mandy Read scored off a
beautiful assist from link Jessie
Gerrard to give the Scotchers a
2-0 lead.
Gerrard and Onnie killefer
wasted no time in the second
half, co-maneuvering on a
corner shot until Killefer scored
from the top of the circle.
Team captain Kathy Levinson
straightened out a traffic jam in
front of the goal with one smooth
stroke to give Stanford a 4-0
cushion.
Junior link Sukie Jackson
scored the final point of the

game with assistance from Hunt
and Killefer.
'Grey hairs'
The Cards seemed undecided
about winning their game
against San Diego State, accord
ing to coach Shirley Schoof, who
confessed, "I grew a few grey
hairs over this game."
The Aztecs opened the first
half playing "superb" hockey.
"We made a lot of mistakes."
said School. "We were sloppy,
had our feet on the ball more
than off, and passed to the other
team more than to each other."
As if Stanford needed any
more problems, Levinson
strained an ankle muscle and sat
out the beginning of the second
half. But with San Diego state
leading 1-0 and threatening to
break the game open, she re
entered the game.
The Cards recuperated from
their first half lethargy just in
time, with good, crisp passes
and solid teamwork.
With time running out, the
Scotchers finally tied the game
with a hard, beautiful shot by the
injured Levinson. Taped ankle
and all, she came through once
more with only four minutes to
go for the final winning point.
The Cards will face a strong
UC-Davis squad at 1:30 Wed
nesday afternoon at Roble Field.
