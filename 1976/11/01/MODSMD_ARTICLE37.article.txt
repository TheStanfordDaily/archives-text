Carter's church refuses entry to black
Plains, Ga. — Services at the Plains Baptist Church,
which claims Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy
Carter as a member, were canceled yesterday when a black
minister who had applied for membership attempted to
join the worshippers.
"The only thing 1 know is that our church for many
years has accepted any worshippers who came there, and
my own deep belief is that anyone who lives in our com
munity who wants to be a member of our church, regard
less of race, ought to be admitted," Carter told reporters
after hearing of the cancellation while campaigning in
Texas yesterday.
"1 know that the pastor agrees with me. I hope this will
be the outcome of the problem in Plains. 1 don't know what
happened."
The pastor, Bruce Edwards, who said the black minis
ter's attempt to join the church was politically inspired,
said the decision was made at a Tuesday night meeting of
the church's Board of Deacons, which voted to affirm a
1965 resolution which bars blacks and civil rights
agitators from the church.
That resolution was passed over the protest of Carter
and his family, said Edwards.
The church deacons voted later yesterday to recom
mend that Edwards be fired for telling reporters that the
1965 resolution barred "niggers and civil rights activists"
from joining the church, the Atlanta Constitution re
ported in its editions today.
I hat language was not in the resolution, the deacons
said, and they were concerned that the quote had been
transmitted throughout the country, the newspaper re
ported. The ouster recommendation was to be placed be
fore a church prayer meeting Wednesday, the newspaper
said.
Navy team retrieves Phoenix missile
London — A U.S. Navy team conquered gale winds and
heaving seas yesterday to retrieve a Phoenix missile that
fell from an aircraft carrier six weeks ago and plunged to
the bottom of the Atlantic off Scotland.
The rough weather prevented raising the F-14 Tomcat
jet fighter that sank with the highly classified missile off
the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy on Sept. 14, the Navy
reported. It will be attempted when the sea calms.
Discovery of the jet 10 days ago and yesterday's recov
ery of the Phoenix put an end to fears, minimized by the
Navy, that Soviet ships might snatch the $20 million plane
and $515,000 missile.
The missile had a non-nuclear warhead but capture of a
Phoenix and F-14 would have provided valuable techni
cal data to a potential adversary.
Two seized at Carter rally; later let go
Dallas — Two persons who were arrested yesterday
morning after carrying pistols into a hotel where Democ
ratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter was to speak later
were released. Police said they were not considered a
threat to Carter.
A 31-year-old man volunteered that he was carrying a
loaded .25 caliber pistol at a checkpoint outside the room
where Carter addressed county Democrats.

A police spokesman said the woman was standing in
the line with her husband and apparently decided to leave
because she, too. was carrying a loaded .32 caliber
weapon. Officers detained her and found the pistol in her
purse.
A Secret Service officer said the matter was turned over
to Dallas police and that neither person was considered to
be a threat.

Carter's church refuses entry to black
Plains, Ga. — Services at the Plains Baptist Church,
which claims Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy
Carter as a member, were canceled yesterday when a black
minister who had applied for membership attempted to
join the worshippers.
"The only thing 1 know is that our church for many
years has accepted any worshippers who came there, and
my own deep belief is that anyone who lives in our com
munity who wants to be a member of our church, regard
less of race, ought to be admitted," Carter told reporters
after hearing of the cancellation while campaigning in
Texas yesterday.
"1 know that the pastor agrees with me. I hope this will
be the outcome of the problem in Plains. 1 don't know what
happened."
The pastor, Bruce Edwards, who said the black minis
ter's attempt to join the church was politically inspired,
said the decision was made at a Tuesday night meeting of
the church's Board of Deacons, which voted to affirm a
1965 resolution which bars blacks and civil rights
agitators from the church.
That resolution was passed over the protest of Carter
and his family, said Edwards.
The church deacons voted later yesterday to recom
mend that Edwards be fired for telling reporters that the
1965 resolution barred "niggers and civil rights activists"
from joining the church, the Atlanta Constitution re
ported in its editions today.
I hat language was not in the resolution, the deacons
said, and they were concerned that the quote had been
transmitted throughout the country, the newspaper re
ported. The ouster recommendation was to be placed be
fore a church prayer meeting Wednesday, the newspaper
said.
Navy team retrieves Phoenix missile
London — A U.S. Navy team conquered gale winds and
heaving seas yesterday to retrieve a Phoenix missile that
fell from an aircraft carrier six weeks ago and plunged to
the bottom of the Atlantic off Scotland.
The rough weather prevented raising the F-14 Tomcat
jet fighter that sank with the highly classified missile off
the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy on Sept. 14, the Navy
reported. It will be attempted when the sea calms.
Discovery of the jet 10 days ago and yesterday's recov
ery of the Phoenix put an end to fears, minimized by the
Navy, that Soviet ships might snatch the $20 million plane
and $515,000 missile.
The missile had a non-nuclear warhead but capture of a
Phoenix and F-14 would have provided valuable techni
cal data to a potential adversary.
Two seized at Carter rally; later let go
Dallas — Two persons who were arrested yesterday
morning after carrying pistols into a hotel where Democ
ratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter was to speak later
were released. Police said they were not considered a
threat to Carter.
A 31-year-old man volunteered that he was carrying a
loaded .25 caliber pistol at a checkpoint outside the room
where Carter addressed county Democrats.

A police spokesman said the woman was standing in
the line with her husband and apparently decided to leave
because she, too. was carrying a loaded .32 caliber
weapon. Officers detained her and found the pistol in her
purse.
A Secret Service officer said the matter was turned over
to Dallas police and that neither person was considered to
be a threat.
