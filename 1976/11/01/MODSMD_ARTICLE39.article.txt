# McCarthy says HE DOESN'T CARE IF HIS VOTES HELP RE-ELECT FORD. WE DO.
## 
### 
Eight years ago we were
working against a cruel, illegal
war and an unresponsive gov
ernment. We called for a candi
date to lead us in the Democratic
primaries. When those we first
turned to declined our call, an
other answered. Our leaflets
said, "He gave America new
hope."
We continued to follow him
when others entered the cam
paign. We believed that his
courage would not serve as an
example if we shunted him
aside once the task of defeating
an incumbent President had
been accomplished. We followed
him to Chicago and beyond;
few of us transferred our ener
gies to the nominee of our party
in 1968.
So it is with sadness that we
reject the call from that man now.
Eugene McCarthy is running for
President as an independent,
and we cannot support him.
We have the greatest respect
for Eugene McCarthy. Some of
us are his friends. He is a man
of intelligence, poetry, wisdom
and wit. We know that he—and
we who worked in the same
cause—did not get a fair shot
at the nomination in 1968; the
delegate selection process was
stacked against any challenger.
But in 1968 we began the
process of reforming the Demo
cratic party, ending the war and
building a new political constitu
ency.
Some of us worked in Mc-
Carthy's brief campaign for the
Democratic nomination in 1972.
Some of us would have preferred
Barbara Ackerman, Mass.

to have McCarthy as the nomi
nee of our party in 1976. Many
of us did support candidates
other than Jimmy Carter, and we
lost.
In 1976 we had the most open
nominating process ever. The
people voted in primary after
primary and in local caucuses
all over the country. McCarthy
did not compete. In 1968 we
called McCarthy "THE PEO
PLE'S CHOICE." This year the
people chose Jimmy Carter.
We have a healthy skepticism
toward our political system.
Most of us have worked in the
movement against the Vietnam
war, for civil rights, against gov
ernment-sponsored subversion
abroad and spying at home. But
our ideas are now welcome in
the Democratic party. The Demo
cratic candidate is running on a
platform some of us helped
write. He is intelligent and a tal
ented administrator. His opposi
tion to the precipitous use of
nuclear power, to indiscriminate
strip-mining and dam-building,
to American support for dicta
torships abroad, to the B-l
bomber, and to America's be
coming the arms merchant of
the world, as well as his stance
on the issues of jobs and tax
reform, make him a candidate
we can support.
Many of McCarthy's ideas still
make sense; his thinking has al
ready permeated our party and
should be welcome in any Dem
ocratic administration; certainly
it will not be in a Ford adminis
tration. But he knows he will not
be elected President in 1976.

The question, then, is who will
be elected.
McCarthy says he
DOESN'T CARE IF HIS VOTES
HELP RE-ELECT FORD.
We do. We are not cynical
enough to believe that both can
didates and the groups they rep
resent are alike.
We have largely achieved our
goal of 1968 of opening up the
Democratic party. We have be
gun the task of reforming Con
gress. If we are to have a
chance to put our ideas into ef
fect, we must have a Democratic
President.
The complexion of a Ford ad
ministration, Ford appointments,
the actions of agencies and de
partments under Ford will take
us further from our goal of a just
society dealing with the nations
of the world as a friend rather
than an empire-builder.
With Democratic majorities,
with many new members and
new leadership in the House and
Senate—and with a Democratic
administration—we can make a
new start toward this goal.
After eight years of Nixon-Ford,
it would be tragic to let this
chance slip away.
The effect of voting for Gene
McCarthy this year is to make
it more likely that Ford will
again be our President.
We, former 1968 campaign
workers and supporters of
Eugene McCarthy, urge others
who were with us in 1968 and
in other struggles over the years
to join us in voting for the
Carter-Mondale ticket.
