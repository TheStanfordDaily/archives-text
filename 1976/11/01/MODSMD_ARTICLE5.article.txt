# Carter, Ford vie for crucial votes
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
With only hours to go before they
rest their campaigns in tlie hands of a
closely divided electorate, President
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter yester
day sought to sway the big, pivotal
states that will make or break a presi
dent in tomorrow's election.
Ford campaigned in the rain in up
state New York, then in the Long Is
land suburbs, asking voters for a man
date to continue the administration he
began by appointment 27 months ago.
In person and on television, Carter
worked in Texas, then in California.
Acknowledging that the election is
razor-close now, he declared that the
nation needs change only he can bring.
Midsummer's runaway leader in the
public opinion polls, Carter is now
rated barely ahead of Ford in two late
surveys of voter opinion, by margins
so slender that both said the election
could go either way.
Those numbers added to the tension
and the urgency as Ford and Carter
worked where the electoral votes are
— 41 in New York, 2b in Texas and 43
in California.
Ohio
Ford was moving yesterday night to
Canton. Ohio, then on election eve, to
Akron and home to Michigan, for ap
pearances near Detroit and in Grand
Rapids.
Carter flew from Fort Worth to San
Francisco and Sacramento. He is to
campaign today in Los Angeles, then
plans to meet his vice presidential
running mate, Sen. Walter Mondale,at
a rally in Flint. Mich., for a final bid to
pry away Ford's own state. Then he
goes home to Plains, Ga., to await the
outcome.
Carter kicked off his final swing
through vote-rich California last night
with an outdoor rally in San Francisco
telecast to four western states.
"Every vote counts," Carter declared

to the thousands of cheering persons
crammed into Ghirardelli Square and
those watching on television.
"I don't want to lose," Carter told the
rally. "1 don't intend to lose."
Carter was introduced by Gov. Ed
mund Brown )r., who portrayed the
Democratic presidential candidate as a
choice "of the future, of possibility, of
openness." Me said another Ford ad
ministration would "recycle the last
eight years into the status quo."
The Carter rally was televised in 10
cities in California, Oregon,
Washington and Nevada.
$70,000 to air
Some of the stations carried the
program live, while others recorded it
for broadcast later yesterday and to
day. The show cost $70,000 to air. Car
ter aides said.
It will take 270 electoral votes to
elect a president tomorrow. In the final
two days of the campaign, Carter and
Ford were appearing in six states
which among them have 104 electoral
votes to offer.

From the Associated Press
With only hours to go before they
rest their campaigns in tlie hands of a
closely divided electorate, President
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter yester
day sought to sway the big, pivotal
states that will make or break a presi
dent in tomorrow's election.
Ford campaigned in the rain in up
state New York, then in the Long Is
land suburbs, asking voters for a man
date to continue the administration he
began by appointment 27 months ago.
In person and on television, Carter
worked in Texas, then in California.
Acknowledging that the election is
razor-close now, he declared that the
nation needs change only he can bring.
Midsummer's runaway leader in the
public opinion polls, Carter is now
rated barely ahead of Ford in two late
surveys of voter opinion, by margins
so slender that both said the election
could go either way.
Those numbers added to the tension
and the urgency as Ford and Carter
worked where the electoral votes are
— 41 in New York, 2b in Texas and 43
in California.
Ohio
Ford was moving yesterday night to
Canton. Ohio, then on election eve, to
Akron and home to Michigan, for ap
pearances near Detroit and in Grand
Rapids.
Carter flew from Fort Worth to San
Francisco and Sacramento. He is to
campaign today in Los Angeles, then
plans to meet his vice presidential
running mate, Sen. Walter Mondale,at
a rally in Flint. Mich., for a final bid to
pry away Ford's own state. Then he
goes home to Plains, Ga., to await the
outcome.
