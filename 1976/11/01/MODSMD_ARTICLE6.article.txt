# New House: Democratic but younger
## 
### 
Washington (AP) —The House that
voters will elect tomorrow, by all indi
cations, will show about the same
party division as its predecessor —
overwhelmingly Democratic. But it
will not be a carbon copy.
At least one-third of the representa
tives sworn in next January probably
will have not more than two years'
previous service.
The outgoing House was split
exactly two to one — 290 Democratic
seats, 145 Republican.
Election prospect estimates by
Democratic and Republican analysts,
agree, at least privately, with those by
outside estimators within a notably
narrow range. Almost without excep
tion, they point to a net shift of few
more than a dozen seats, at the most.
Republicans are favored to make a
small gain, if only because the post-
Watergate election of 1974 swept in an
abnormally large Democratic
freshman class, some from normally
Republican districts. Newly elected in
1974 and in subsequent special elec
tions to fill vacancies were 79 Democ
rats and 19 Republicans.
There will bean absolute minimum
of 53 new members in the incoming
House. That many seats are open be
cause of death, retirement and primary
defeat. Almost certainly there will be
even more new faces. It is hardly pos
sible that every incumbent seeking
re-election will succeed. I
So, depending on how the presiden
tial election comes out, Jimmy Carter
will be seeking the cooperation of. or
President Cerald Ford will be con
fronting, a heavily Democratic House

with a proportion of junior members
unmatched in recent years.
It could be a yeasty House. The 1974
Democratic freshmen, working with
some restless older members, made a
major dent in the hallowed seniority
system, toppling three committee
chairmen and forcing changes in the
House's ways of doing business, with
the role of the party caucus
strengthened.
