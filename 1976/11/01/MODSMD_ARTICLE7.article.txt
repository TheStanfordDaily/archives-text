## 
### Robert Mauro 
Emergency dispatching services for
the university and Palo Alto will
merge today at noon.according to Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer of the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety.
The four dispatchers presently
employed by the university will be
laid off November 7, according to Jim
Berk. United Stanford Employees'
negotiator.
Berk said that three of the dispatch
ers were offered jobs by the university.
One dispatcher will be hired as a
Community Service Officer, and two
have been offered utility dispatching
positions.
According to Berk, since utility dis
patching is a lower skill position, the
emergency dispatchers' pay will be
frozen at the present level until regular
pay increases for utility dispatchers
reach that level He estimated that the
actual loss due to losing regular pay
increases would amount to a 30 per
cent cut in pay staggered over several
years.
Sue Paulsen, univeristy negotiator,
disagreed with Berk's view.

"I think that's exaggerated. They
have received this year's increase.
Under the terms of the agreement they
will lose six percent, next year they
will lose five per cent, that makes 1 1
per cent. The year after, we negotiate a
new contract, and who knows?" she
said.
Berk said that without his consent
the dispatchers were told to decide by
last Friday whether or nor to accept the
jobs.
"They seem to have quit dealing
with me, they seem to like to avoid me.
I will have to talk to Sue Paulsen and
chew her out about his .. . Negotia
tions are still needed since they (the
university) haven't budged. . . . What
they've said is whatever your other
demands are. this is what our position
is," said Berk,
Ed Everett, of Palo Alto's Office of
Budget and Staff, said that two dis
patchers from Mountain View
emergency services had been hired be
fore the vacancy occured. He said that
interviews for the va< ant position have
been completed and th.it a decision
would be made today or tomorrow.
