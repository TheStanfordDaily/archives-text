## Opinions Long UFW struggle behind Prop. 14 
### 
Steve Barkan

With the fate of Prop. 14 to he de
cided tomorrow, we should not be
surprised at the vicious, false argu
ments that have been launched against
it. Advanced in a mil lion-dollar adver
tising campaign, they represent only
the latest effort by the huge California
crop growers to destroy their stubborn
opponent, the United Farm Workers
(UFW) union.
For more than 1U long and bloody
years, the UFW has fought the growers
in an attempt to improve conditions in
the fields. Since 1970 the UFW has
also had to face the Teamsters union,
which entered into "sweetheart" con
tracts with the growers.
In this struggle between a modern
day David and Goliath, the David has
repeatedly refused to admit defeat.
When strikes in the fields proved in
sufficient. the UFW turned to national
boycotts of lettuce, grapes, and Gallo
wine.
New aspect
In September 1975 the conflict took
on a radically new aspect — elections.
For the first time in American farm
labor history, farm workers in Califor
nia were allowed to vote for the union
of their choice to represent them in
contract negotiations with the grow
ers.
Several months earlier Gov. Jerry
Brown had brought together the UFW,
Teamsters and growers to work on
and finally agree to the unprecedented
election legislation. The Agriculture
Labor Relations Board (ALRB) was es
tablished to supervise the hundreds of
elections that would take place at har
vest time on farms across the state.
The growers and Teamsters were
confident that the elections would
prove the undoing of Cesar Chavez's,
small, impoverished union. The news
media also doubted the ability of the
UFW to win votes among workers
whose loyalty to La Causa was suspect.
Beyond expectations
But once again the David proved re
sourceful beyond all expectations. By
January of this year the UFW had won
more than half of the 376 elections that
had been certified by that time, receiv
ing 54 per cent of all votes cast, com
pared to the Teamsters' total of only 29
per cent.
But the elections ended at the end of
January; seeing that democracy in the
fields was not working in their favor,
the growers and Teamsters made sure
that democracy would not work at all.
On Jan. 31 the board supervising the
elections ran out of money. It needed a
special $3.8 million appropriation
from the California state legislature to
stay in business, but the
agribusiness-Teamster combine sec
ured the support of enough state legis
lators to prevent the appropriation
from being allocated.
Securing signatures
It was only then that the UFW scur
ried the state and secured over 700,000
signatures to put Prop. 14 on the ballot
in order to guarantee funding for the
board despite the action of the state
legislature. In an attempt to head off

the proposition, the growers changed
their minds and allowed continued
funding to be enacted. But if Prop. 14
fails, they could change their minds
once more.
Before last spring, the growers and
Teamsters had done their best to pre
determine the outcome of the elec
tions. One grower threatened to kill any
of his workers who voted for the UFW.
At other farms, Teamster goons car
ried clubs and guns near the polling
sites. Many growers granted total ac
cess to Teamsters to talk to their work
ers while denying access to UFW or
ganizers. Still others photographed
workers who did talk with UFW rep
resentatives. And some laborers who
wore UFW buttons were fired.
These were not the only outrages
perpetrated by the Goliath upon the
stubborn David. Following on the
heels of these election violations was a
confession last December by a former
deputy sheriff that he'd been paid by
two California growers to break into
UFW offices 10 years ago and steal
union documents.
Communist party
Late in 1974, this same man con
vinced a group of California
businessmen to lend him money in an
effort to link Cesar Chavez to the
Communist party. Their plot was re
vealed when they stupidly com
plained to a district attorney's office
that the man had done little or nothing
with their money.
These are all crimes of desperate
men, terrified at the tenacity of a union
that refused to die. Its strength lies not
in guns or clubs or money but in the
bodies and souls of workers who want
to stop living in shacks heated only by
ashes from fires outside.
Its power lies not in deals made wi th
judges and legislators but in the sweat
of laborers fighting or their lives. And
its success will lie not in Watergate
type burglaries and McCarthyite tac
tics but in votes for Prop. 14 and in
boycotts by citizens across America —
a nation celebrating the birth of its
freedom while farm workers must
struggle merely to vote for the union of
their choice.

had been certified by that time, receiv
ing 54 per cent of all votes cast, com
pared to the Teamsters' total of only 29
per cent.
But the elections ended at the end of
January; seeing that democracy in the
fields was not working in their favor,
the growers and Teamsters made sure
that democracy would not work at all.
On Jan. 31 the board supervising the
elections ran out of money. It needed a
special $3.8 million appropriation
from the California state legislature to
stay in business, but the
agribusiness-Teamster combine sec
ured the support of enough state legis
lators to prevent the appropriation
from being allocated.
Securing signatures
It was only then that the UFW scur
ried the state and secured over 700,000
signatures to put Prop. 14 on the ballot
in order to guarantee funding for the
board despite the action of the state
legislature. In an attempt to head off

the proposition, the growers changed
their minds and allowed continued
funding to be enacted. But if Prop. 14
fails, they could change their minds
once more.
Before last spring, the growers and
Teamsters had done their best to pre
determine the outcome of the elec
tions. One grower threatened to kill any
of his workers who voted for the UFW.
At other farms, Teamster goons car
ried clubs and guns near the polling
sites. Many growers granted total ac
cess to Teamsters to talk to their work
ers while denying access to UFW or
ganizers. Still others photographed
workers who did talk with UFW rep
resentatives. And some laborers who
wore UFW buttons were fired.
These were not the only outrages
perpetrated by the Goliath upon the
stubborn David. Following on the
heels of these election violations was a
confession last December by a former
deputy sheriff that he'd been paid by
two California growers to break into
UFW offices 10 years ago and steal
union documents.
Communist party
Late in 1974, this same man con
vinced a group of California
businessmen to lend him money in an
effort to link Cesar Chavez to the
Communist party. Their plot was re
vealed when they stupidly com
plained to a district attorney's office
that the man had done little or nothing
with their money.
These are all crimes of desperate
men, terrified at the tenacity of a union
that refused to die. Its strength lies not
in guns or clubs or money but in the
bodies and souls of workers who want
to stop living in shacks heated only by
ashes from fires outside.
Its power lies not in deals made wi th
judges and legislators but in the sweat
of laborers fighting or their lives. And
its success will lie not in Watergate
type burglaries and McCarthyite tac
tics but in votes for Prop. 14 and in
boycotts by citizens across America —
a nation celebrating the birth of its
freedom while farm workers must
struggle merely to vote for the union of
their choice.

With the fate of Prop. 14 to he de
cided tomorrow, we should not be
surprised at the vicious, false argu
ments that have been launched against
it. Advanced in a mil lion-dollar adver
tising campaign, they represent only
the latest effort by the huge California
crop growers to destroy their stubborn
opponent, the United Farm Workers
(UFW) union.
For more than 1U long and bloody
years, the UFW has fought the growers
in an attempt to improve conditions in
the fields. Since 1970 the UFW has
also had to face the Teamsters union,
which entered into "sweetheart" con
tracts with the growers.
In this struggle between a modern
day David and Goliath, the David has
repeatedly refused to admit defeat.
When strikes in the fields proved in
sufficient. the UFW turned to national
boycotts of lettuce, grapes, and Gallo
wine.
New aspect
In September 1975 the conflict took
on a radically new aspect — elections.
For the first time in American farm
labor history, farm workers in Califor
nia were allowed to vote for the union
of their choice to represent them in
contract negotiations with the grow
ers.
Several months earlier Gov. Jerry
Brown had brought together the UFW,
Teamsters and growers to work on
and finally agree to the unprecedented
election legislation. The Agriculture
Labor Relations Board (ALRB) was es
tablished to supervise the hundreds of
elections that would take place at har
vest time on farms across the state.
The growers and Teamsters were
confident that the elections would
prove the undoing of Cesar Chavez's,
small, impoverished union. The news
media also doubted the ability of the
UFW to win votes among workers
whose loyalty to La Causa was suspect.
Beyond expectations
But once again the David proved re
sourceful beyond all expectations. By
January of this year the UFW had won
more than half of the 376 elections that
had been certified by that time, receiv
ing 54 per cent of all votes cast, com
pared to the Teamsters' total of only 29

With the fate of Prop. 14 to he de
cided tomorrow, we should not be
surprised at the vicious, false argu
ments that have been launched against
it. Advanced in a mil lion-dollar adver
tising campaign, they represent only
the latest effort by the huge California
crop growers to destroy their stubborn
opponent, the United Farm Workers
(UFW) union.
For more than 1U long and bloody
years, the UFW has fought the growers
in an attempt to improve conditions in
the fields. Since 1970 the UFW has
also had to face the Teamsters union,
which entered into "sweetheart" con
tracts with the growers.
In this struggle between a modern
day David and Goliath, the David has
repeatedly refused to admit defeat.
When strikes in the fields proved in
sufficient. the UFW turned to national
boycotts of lettuce, grapes, and Gallo
wine.
New aspect
In September 1975 the conflict took
on a radically new aspect — elections.
For the first time in American farm
labor history, farm workers in Califor
nia were allowed to vote for the union
of their choice to represent them in
contract negotiations with the grow
ers.
Several months earlier Gov. Jerry
Brown had brought together the UFW,
Teamsters and growers to work on
and finally agree to the unprecedented
election legislation. The Agriculture
Labor Relations Board (ALRB) was es
tablished to supervise the hundreds of
elections that would take place at har
vest time on farms across the state.
The growers and Teamsters were
confident that the elections would
prove the undoing of Cesar Chavez's,
small, impoverished union. The news
media also doubted the ability of the
UFW to win votes among workers
whose loyalty to La Causa was suspect.
Beyond expectations
But once again the David proved re
sourceful beyond all expectations. By
January of this year the UFW had won
more than half of the 376 elections that
had been certified by that time, receiv
ing 54 per cent of all votes cast, com
pared to the Teamsters' total of only 29
per cent.
But the elections ended at the end of
January; seeing that democracy in the
fields was not working in their favor,
the growers and Teamsters made sure
that democracy would not work at all.
On Jan. 31 the board supervising the
elections ran out of money. It needed a
special $3.8 million appropriation
from the California state legislature to
stay in business, but the
agribusiness-Teamster combine sec
ured the support of enough state legis
lators to prevent the appropriation
from being allocated.
Securing signatures
It was only then that the UFW scur
ried the state and secured over 700,000
signatures to put Prop. 14 on the ballot
in order to guarantee funding for the
board despite the action of the state
legislature. In an attempt to head off

the proposition, the growers changed
their minds and allowed continued
funding to be enacted. But if Prop. 14
fails, they could change their minds
once more.
Before last spring, the growers and
Teamsters had done their best to pre
determine the outcome of the elec
tions. One grower threatened to kill any
of his workers who voted for the UFW.
At other farms, Teamster goons car
ried clubs and guns near the polling
sites. Many growers granted total ac
cess to Teamsters to talk to their work
ers while denying access to UFW or
ganizers. Still others photographed
workers who did talk with UFW rep
resentatives. And some laborers who
wore UFW buttons were fired.
These were not the only outrages
perpetrated by the Goliath upon the
stubborn David. Following on the
heels of these election violations was a
confession last December by a former
deputy sheriff that he'd been paid by
two California growers to break into
UFW offices 10 years ago and steal
union documents.
