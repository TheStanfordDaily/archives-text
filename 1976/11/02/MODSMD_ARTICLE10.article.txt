# Another reason not to vote
## 
### 
Election Day. Oh boy.
Tonight will see another of those biennial rituals
when the "winners" and their followers celebrate,
having received permission from an electoral
majority to rule over all of us. For the losers, a few
hours of sulking will give way to the hatching of
new plots to gain power.
Surely there must be honorable men and women
out on the hustings. Stanford's congressional dis
trict, in fact, has two unusually decent politicians
as major-party nominees: Pete McCloskey and
David Harris. But the system in which they partake
is a corrupting one.
From the lowliest city council seat to the imperial
presidency, American politics is not a battleground
of ideas and philosophies on which respected
minds contest. Instead, it has degenerated into the
anti-ideology of pork barrel politics, of who can
combine the necessary numbers of special interests
through promises of government largesse.
Doesn't matter
For this reason, it matters little which of the two
major parties celebrates tonight. Regardless of who
occupies the presidency or controls the Congress,
we can expect:
—continuation of interventionist American
foreign policy, the "us vs. them" scenario which
really should apply only to the powerful corporate
and union interests which control both major par
ties and seek global dominion;
—more attempts to use volatile economic situa
tions, such as the energy "crisis," to create power
ful new bureaucracies which only exacerbate mar
ket dislocations;

—more worthless grandstand plays in the "pub
lic interest," such as the swine flu immunization
program;
Further inflation
—further inflation of the government
monopolized money supply, the most expedient
way for politicians to "give" the people something;
—new regulators whose ostensible purpose is

watch over the vagaries of private enterprise, but
the actual effect of whom is protection of some
firms' present markets and generation of higher
prices for consumers;
—subsidies from the public purse for every polit
ically powerful interest group, be it farmers, artists,
railroads, welfare recipients, oil companies, de
fense contractors or profligate city governments;
—import quotas on everything from shoes to
cars, to protect domestic companies and unions
from foreign competition (while raising prices for
consumers);
Continued control
—continued control over individuals' personal
activities which offend (though do not aggress

upon) a sizable number of others — gambling and
drug-taking being two;
—further application of affirmative
discrimination quota plans to appease bureaucrats
who apparently are blind to the long-run consequ
ences of such policies;
—even more pernicious paperwork to slow the
flow of interpersonal transactions, so that govern
ment planners can keep watch over how we spend
our money and live our lives;
—increased payments to the elderly from a
worse-than-bankrupt Social Security system, with
little thought about where the money will someday
come from.
—higher pay for government employes — most
importantly, for elected officials. Bigger staffs,
more fringe benefits, stricter campaign finance
laws to protect incumbents;
'Give me' politics
All these events are inexorable, no matter who
wins today. They area fact of life in the pluralism of
"give me" politics. No office holder can sincerely
work to counter any of them without committing
political suicide. The reason: voters do not support
a candidate because his/her principles are sound
ideologically; they seek only to know, "what's in it
for me?"
So long as the voters so demand, and the politi
cians so promise, 1 find little in the American polit
ical system to interest me. If elections someday are
contests of philosophies and not payoffs, then I will
cast a vote. E3i.it for now, I've got better things to do.

from foreign competition (while raising prices for

Continued control
—continued control over individuals' personal
activities which offend (though do not aggress

upon) a sizable number of others — gambling and
drug-taking being two;

discrimination quota plans to appease bureaucrats
who apparently are blind to the long-run consequ
ences of such policies;

flow of interpersonal transactions, so that govern
ment planners can keep watch over how we spend
our money and live our lives;

worse-than-bankrupt Social Security system, with
little thought about where the money will someday
come from.
—higher pay for government employes — most
importantly, for elected officials. Bigger staffs,
more fringe benefits, stricter campaign finance
laws to protect incumbents;
'Give me' politics
All these events are inexorable, no matter who
wins today. They area fact of life in the pluralism of
"give me" politics. No office holder can sincerely
work to counter any of them without committing
political suicide. The reason: voters do not support
a candidate because his/her principles are sound
ideologically; they seek only to know, "what's in it
for me?"
So long as the voters so demand, and the politi
cians so promise, 1 find little in the American polit
ical system to interest me. If elections someday are
contests of philosophies and not payoffs, then I will
cast a vote. E3i.it for now, I've got better things to do.

Election Day. Oh boy.
Tonight will see another of those biennial rituals
when the "winners" and their followers celebrate,
having received permission from an electoral
majority to rule over all of us. For the losers, a few
hours of sulking will give way to the hatching of
new plots to gain power.
Surely there must be honorable men and women
out on the hustings. Stanford's congressional dis
trict, in fact, has two unusually decent politicians
as major-party nominees: Pete McCloskey and
David Harris. But the system in which they partake
is a corrupting one.
From the lowliest city council seat to the imperial
presidency, American politics is not a battleground
of ideas and philosophies on which respected
minds contest. Instead, it has degenerated into the
anti-ideology of pork barrel politics, of who can
combine the necessary numbers of special interests
through promises of government largesse.
Doesn't matter
For this reason, it matters little which of the two
major parties celebrates tonight. Regardless of who
occupies the presidency or controls the Congress,
we can expect:
—continuation of interventionist American
foreign policy, the "us vs. them" scenario which
really should apply only to the powerful corporate
and union interests which control both major par
ties and seek global dominion;
—more attempts to use volatile economic situa
tions, such as the energy "crisis," to create power
ful new bureaucracies which only exacerbate mar
ket dislocations;

—more worthless grandstand plays in the "pub
lic interest," such as the swine flu immunization
program;
Further inflation
—further inflation of the government
monopolized money supply, the most expedient
way for politicians to "give" the people something;
—new regulators whose ostensible purpose is

watch over the vagaries of private enterprise, but
the actual effect of whom is protection of some
firms' present markets and generation of higher
prices for consumers;
—subsidies from the public purse for every polit
ically powerful interest group, be it farmers, artists,
railroads, welfare recipients, oil companies, de
fense contractors or profligate city governments;
—import quotas on everything from shoes to
cars, to protect domestic companies and unions
from foreign competition (while raising prices for
consumers);
