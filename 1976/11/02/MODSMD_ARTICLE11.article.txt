Tenure review
It has come to our attention that
Profs. Michael Hurd and Warren San
derson will be reviewed by the
Economics Department for tenure this
fall. We encourage any student who
wishes to express his opinion on the
merits of either case to write to:

Real choice
In 1968, many people argued, much
like my friend Frank Hawke (Daily,
Oct. 28), that the presidential election
offered no real choice, that it was a race
between "tweedledee and tweed
ledum." Watergate could conceivably
haveoccured under Hubert Humphrey
although I believe that such an abuse
of executive power would have been
far less likely.
We now know from the Pentagon
Papers that Humphrey was dovish on
Vietnam and for that reason LBJ os
tracized him from discussions about
the war. Given his legislative record, it
is very likely that Humphrey would
have taken greater initiative in the area
of arms control and aid to developing
countries. Humphrey's appointments
to the Supreme Court would most
likely have been very different from
those appointed by Nixon. This differ-*
ence alone has had a dramatic impact
in the area of capital punishment.
The choice between presidential
candidates in 1976 is far more drama
tic than in 1968. If voters consider the
vice presidential candidates — which
we certainly must given recent history
— the choice is even more dramatic.
In a number of vitally important is
sues. there are significant differences
between Ford and Carter. For instance,
on the issue of nuclear proliferation
Carter has presented specific propos
als and it matters little whether these
were authored by Paul Warnke or
Zbigniew Brzezinski. On abortion the
two candidates also contrast mar
kedly.
By not voting. Hawke is taking the
easy way out. It is far harder to actively
seek to change the political situation
than to grumble about its lack of alter

natives. There is a choice in this year's
presidential election if one takes the
time to examine the thirty-three can
didates.

Irritated at Petroff
I was irritated to read that ASSU
President Vic Petroff was flown to Los
Angeles last Tuesday morning to offi
cially endorse President Gerald Ford at
a press conference along with eight
other California student body presi
dents.
Petroff claimed, "My endorsement
of Ford is not in any way meant to
represent Stanford or the students of
Stanford." Apparently Petroff does not
realize that the general public cannot
help but regard the opinion of a
school's student body president to be
that of the students as a whole.
While Vic Petroff, American citizen,
has every right to express his political
opinions, Vic Petroff, ASSU president,
has no right to express them in a public
forum. He would not have been flown
to Los Angeles were he not the ASSU
president. His views cannot help but
reflect as being the views of the stu
dents here. Only if all or almost all of
the students here favored Ford for elec
tion could Petroff's actions be jus
tified.
It would seem Petroff was a bit too
impressed with being given the VIP
treatment to pause and consider how
his political opinions would be re
ceived by the general public. It is not
Petroff's political opinions 1 criticize,
but the principles on which he acted.

Within the system
Don Barton is a bit idealistic in his
letter entitled "Students not apathe
tic" (Daily, Oct. 29). He assures us that
"Stanford students, are farther from an
apathetic attitude than ever before."
and that after graduating most will
"get a job, and aggressively try to re
form the system while working within
it."
There is little evidence of this "quiet
radicalism" among Stanford students.
Without placing a value judgment on
the issue, one must honestly admit that
most Stanford students will strive for

happiness within the system. For some
this quest for a good living and sec
urity may include aggressively trying
to change the system from within, but
for most it will not.
As to Barton's verbal vandalism of
the Daily, I would suggest that he fol
low his own scenario of the college
student: he should write for the Daily.
In this way Barton could "aggressively
try to reform" the "amateurish" and
"rabble-rousing" Daily "while work
ing within it."

Students do nothing
I feel compelled to come to the Dai
ly's defense to protect it from Don Bar
ton's scathing attack (Daily, Oct. 29). I
question his optimism in students
when he claims "students care more
deeply about this nation than theDaily
would dare to think about." If we are so
concerned, why are so many of us
politically uninformed?
In the '60s, students faced an issue of
particular concern to themselves —
whether or not to go to war. This situa
tion motivated national student in
volvement that this country has not
seen since. Today's issues involve stu
dents less directly, so consequently
many of them just don't care. It is this
absence of involvement that the Daily
labels apathy, and I agree.
Granted, the '60s movement was
violent, but nowhere near as much as
Barton's hyperbole suggests. At that
time, working within the system sim
ply wasn't practical. In the '50s, you
couldn't smile at the House Un-
American Activities Committee and
suggest that communism should be
legalized. In the same context, the joint
chiefs of staff and the president would
not have carefully considered a calm
approach opposing the Vietnam war.
Barton entirely fails to understand
student movements from a historical
context. As far back as 1848 in Europe,
students played a role in making and
unmaking the policies of govern
ments. In Thailand in 1973, students
overthrew the military government. In
America, student opposition to the
Vietnam war helped to slowly erode
the war's support. Our predecessors at
this university helped to end our fruit
less and brutal involvement in Viet

nam.
Now, although there are still many
problems in American policy, stu
dents do nothing. We sit on our hands
as our government overthrows democ
racy in Chile. We watch our leaders
make arms deals with medieval
Mideastern tryants.
If the Daily was calling for a rebirth
of the 1960s movement, I say all the
more power to it. The broken windows
of the '60s were much rarer than the
shattered dreams of our violent gener
als.

Worthy opponent
I wish to comment on the article on
the Stanford soccer team (Daily, Oct.
20). In it, John Murao said that the
LSJU soccer team has faced . . less
than formidable opponents. Indeed,
Stanford has been a bit unlucky."
This comment on luck was Murao's
explanation of the losses to several
small college soccer teams. However,
in mentioning the loss to Pomona Col
lege, Murao ignored the fact that for
the last six years the Pomona Sagehens
have made the NAIA Division II Na
tional playoffs on several occasions,
and have made at least one contribu
tion to the semi-final roster of the 1976
USA Olympic soccer squad.
Pomona does not give any athletic
scholarships to its students, unlike
Stanford, and the team is coached by a
classics professor.
As another case in point, Pomona
was one of the few undefeated champ
ion teams of theC.E. College Howl. It's
football team has a winning record
against USC (which we last played in
192-something), and since CalTech
was in its league up until a few years
ago (and their home football stadium
was the only stadium in Pasadena)
Pomona has been to the Rose Howl
many more times than Stanford ever
