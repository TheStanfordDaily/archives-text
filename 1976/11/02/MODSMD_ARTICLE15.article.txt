# 14 state races
## GOP may gain governors' chairs 
### 
Washington (AP) — The
fraternity of GOP governors has a
chance to expand Tuesday for
the first time since becoming vir
tually an endangered species in
1970. And so has the sorority of
Democratic women governors,
now numbering one.
There is no way, politically or
mathematically, that the Repub
licans can regain their late 1960s
dominance of executive man
sions. The field is too sparse,
with only 14 contests for gover
norships now held by eight
Democrats and six Republicans.
Republicans are expected to
Win the biggest prize. Illinois.
Democratic women candi
dates in Washington and Ver
mont are even with their Repub
lican male opponents in the
pre-election rankings. The coun
try now has only one woman
governor, Connecticut's Ella
Grasso, a Democrat whose term
has two more years to run.
Going into today's election, 36
governors are Democrats, 13 are
Republicans and there is one in
dependent, Maine's James B.
Longley. Seven incumbents are
standing for re-election.
Favorites
Republicans are pre-election
favorites to win in Illinois. De
laware and Utah, and are rated
tossups in Montana and Ver
mont. all states with Democratic
governors.
The flip side of that coin has
Democrats favored in North
Carolina and West Virginia, and
rated even in New Hampshire
and Washington — all with Re
publican governors.
The governorships of Arkan
sas, North Dakota and Rhode Is
land are expected to remain in
Democratic hands. And Repub
licans are favored to hold onto
Indiana and Missouri.
The natural focus of attention
.is on the race in Illinois where
the candidate of a big-citv
machine is the underdog to a
crusading prosecutor.
That movie-script contest pits
Democrat Michael J. Howlett,
the secretary of state and protege
of Chicago's Mayor Richard J.
Daley, against Republican James
R. Thompson, a former U.S. at
torney in Chicago who sent a
number of Daley cronies to jail.
Nemesis defeated
As Dal"\ \, candidate, Howlett
removed a long-time Daley

nemesis by defeating incumbent
Gov. Daniel Walker in a bitterly
contested primary. But Walker
tagged him as the mayor's
stooge. Howlett's insistence that
he is his own man has done little
to alter that image.
Thompson, 40, has led in the
polls and doesn't let voters
forget who propelled Howlett, at
62, a veteran of Illinois Democra
tic politics.
