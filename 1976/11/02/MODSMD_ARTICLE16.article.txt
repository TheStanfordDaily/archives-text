# Harris, McCloskey debate economy

### Manuel Hernandez 
Solving the nation's high un
employment problem, with a
look at the Humphrey-Hawkins
bill and the role of the Federal
Reserve Bank, was the central
issue in the final debate between
Republican Paul McCloskey Jr.
and Democrat David Harris,
held last Friday at the Benson
Center on the University of Santa
Clara campus.
Over 600 persons listened to
the different approaches ad
vanced by the candidates of the
12th congressional seat and wit
nessed a disruption by the
American Independent Party
candidate Joss Cooney, who was
physically escorted out of the
debate during the question and
answer period.
In his opening remarks, Harris
declared that a good economic
policy gives people the oppor
tunity to get part of the wealth.

He then contended that the na
tion faces the highest rates of un
employment and inflation and
the largest deficit in history. He
criticized the government's poor
allocation for social needs.
"The government has a pre
judice to support the monopolis
tic against the competitive and
small businesses." remarked
Harris.
For solutions to the nation's
social needs he called for an end
to the business entertainment
deduction and income security
for the retired. Stimulation of
small businesses with tax reform
should be initiated according to
Harris.
In turn, McCloskey stated that
a good economic policy lies in
the stimulation of free enter
prise and launched an attack on
the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, the
cornerstone of the Democratic
platform last spring. The bill's

goal is to lower unemployment
to three per cent through gov
ernment employment.
Forced inflation
"It would force an inflation on
95 per cent of the working
people," charged McCloskey.
Next, he stated that the Democ
rats want to politicize the Fed
eral Reserve Bank by bringing it
under the president's control.
McCloskey then proposed a
simplification of the tax policy
in order to make it understanda
ble. A single graduated income
tax for incomes above $6000, no
tax for those below the amount,
and a graduated corporate tax
were included in the incum
bent's proposal.
In his rebuttal. Harris stated
that the economic plan of the
Humphrey-Hawkins bill should
not be seen in simplistic terms.
Charging insensitivity on the
part of President Gerald Ford,

Harris expressed his support for
the Democratic bill and
explained it. According to him,
the plan would first identify the
jobs available from corporations
and then seek to fill them. If in
four years unemployment was
not lowered, the government
would then step in.
He concluded, "To rule our
selves out as employers is a great
mistake."
On the Federal Reserve Bank
proposal, Harris stated his sup
port and charged that the Fed
eral Reserve Bank is already
politicized, favoring the nation's
banks through their representa
tives on the board.

selves out as employers is a great
mistake."
On the Federal Reserve Bank
proposal, Harris stated his sup
port and charged that the Fed
eral Reserve Bank is already
politicized, favoring the nation's
banks through their representa
tives on the board.
Solving the nation's high un
employment problem, with a
look at the Humphrey-Hawkins
bill and the role of the Federal
Reserve Bank, was the central
issue in the final debate between
Republican Paul McCloskey Jr.
and Democrat David Harris,
held last Friday at the Benson
Center on the University of Santa
Clara campus.
Over 600 persons listened to
the different approaches ad
vanced by the candidates of the
12th congressional seat and wit
nessed a disruption by the
American Independent Party
candidate Joss Cooney, who was
physically escorted out of the
debate during the question and
answer period.
In his opening remarks, Harris
declared that a good economic
policy gives people the oppor
tunity to get part of the wealth.

He then contended that the na
tion faces the highest rates of un
employment and inflation and
the largest deficit in history. He
criticized the government's poor
allocation for social needs.
"The government has a pre
judice to support the monopolis
tic against the competitive and
small businesses." remarked
Harris.
For solutions to the nation's
social needs he called for an end
to the business entertainment
deduction and income security
for the retired. Stimulation of
small businesses with tax reform
should be initiated according to
Harris.
In turn, McCloskey stated that
a good economic policy lies in
the stimulation of free enter
prise and launched an attack on
the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, the
cornerstone of the Democratic
platform last spring. The bill's

goal is to lower unemployment
to three per cent through gov
ernment employment.
Forced inflation
"It would force an inflation on
95 per cent of the working
people," charged McCloskey.
Next, he stated that the Democ
rats want to politicize the Fed
eral Reserve Bank by bringing it
under the president's control.
McCloskey then proposed a
simplification of the tax policy
in order to make it understanda
ble. A single graduated income
tax for incomes above $6000, no
tax for those below the amount,
and a graduated corporate tax
were included in the incum
bent's proposal.
In his rebuttal. Harris stated
that the economic plan of the
Humphrey-Hawkins bill should
not be seen in simplistic terms.
Charging insensitivity on the
part of President Gerald Ford,

Harris expressed his support for
the Democratic bill and
explained it. According to him,
the plan would first identify the
jobs available from corporations
and then seek to fill them. If in
four years unemployment was
not lowered, the government
would then step in.
He concluded, "To rule our
selves out as employers is a great
mistake."
