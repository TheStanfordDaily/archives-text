Los Angeles (AP) — Indepen
dent presidential candidate
Eugene McCarthy, denouncing
the presidential election as un
constitutional, accused the news
media yesterday of failing to ex
pose what he called illegal mea
sures to keep him off the ballot.

"The press has stood by,
watching all of these violations
of constitutional feedoms,"
McCarthy told a news confer
ence before addressing a rally at
UCLA.
"1 think you're conditioned,"
he told reporters, "which is the

worst thing you can say about
the press.
"1 wish you were conspirators
being paid by the Democrats or
Republicans. But this is 1984
stutt. You think you're doing a
public service by going along
with the Democrats and Repub
licans."
He said he believed much of
the election was being influ
enced by television coverage
and"the writing press is being
controlled by TV."
Write-in urged
McCarthy expressed bitter
ness about his inability to get on
the ballot in California and New
York and urged write-in votes
for his protest candidacy.
He conceded he doesn't ex
pect to win the election but said
that a substantial vote for him —
at least five per cent — would
demonstrate that voters are fed
up with the two-party system
and would pave the way for
changes in election laws.
"What we're saying is that
there's not a question of personal
choice now," said McCarthy.
"Something must be done as a
challenge."
No reference
Although he refused to say
which of the two major candi
dates he prefers. McCarthy at
tacked Democratic candidate
Jimmy Carter's record as gover
nor of Georgia, saying that many
of his actions were contrary,to
his current stand as a liberal.
"Carter signed a bill for capital
punishment...which included
treason. Who was going to com
mit treason against Georgia?" he
asked. "Here's someone who
says William Galley was con
victed of killing civilians during
the My Lai massacre in Vietnam.
McCarthy said he felt Ford's
record required no comment and
laughed.
No difference
He said he should have been in
cluded in the presidential de
bates but feels they didn't make
any difference in the election
anyway.
The debates were a distrac
tion," he said. "It was like the
National Football League
playoffs. It took two months and
I don't think the country is in a
better position to judge between
the candidates than if there
hadn't been any debates."
McCarthy bagan his last cam
paign day with a radio talk show
stint in which he told listeners
that he had already cast his vote
for himself in Minnesota and
hoped they would follow his
example.
He was pressed repeatedly by
talk show host Michael Jackson
to indicate a preference for Car
ter or Ford but McCarthy re
fused.
