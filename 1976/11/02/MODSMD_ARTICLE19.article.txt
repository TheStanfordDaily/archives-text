# Student votes may affect East Palo Alto election
##

Student votes here could be a factor in the Dis
trict 1 race for the East Palo Alto Municipal Coun
cil, according to the Democratic challenger.
Republican incumbent Clarence Jackson, an
eight-year veteran ol the council, is in a close race
with Democrat Lonnie Johnson for the seat.
District 1 is a triangle ot land separated from
San Mateo County by the Bayshore Freeway and
Baywood Avenue and bordered by San Francis
quito Creek. Its heavy concentration of apartment
buildings attracts many university students who.
as Johnson points out, are unaware they are living
in East Palo Alto.
Johnson, a real property appraiser and
negotiator, implied that the student vote could
hold the key to the election.
Incumbent Jackson is aware of the student
population, but feels that it will not be a factor in
the voting. "Students do not have much time," he
said.

Jackson, running on his record, is <1 member ol
numerous commissions and agencies. In 1972 he
was one of 10 Bay Area individuals presented the
San Francisco Examiner's "Outstanding 10
Award." which recognizes community service.
Johnson is challenging the top vote-getter in
previous elections. He said he has spent a lot ot
time in the neighborhoods talking to people.
"1 want to get the citizen involved," said
Johnson.
He is attempting to familiarize residents with
his involvement in government, which has in
cluded work in urban renewal, and a successful
fight in 1970 to reduce property taxes.
"I'm not setting myself out saying I'm God,"
said Johnson. Rather, by progress through in
volvement. "We can make things happen."
Jackson feels things are already happening in
his district, and that he should be reelected if they
are to continue to happen.
