# Meetings moved to residences
## ASSU senators to seek out students 
### Kathy Trafton 
The ASSU Semite voted last night to
meet in university residences for the
remainder of the year because the
senators agreed that meetings in the
Craduate School of Business are too
"remote" from the students whom
they represent.
In an attempt to encourage students
to attend their sessions, the senate will
hold its next meeting <it the Wilbur
dining hall at 7:30 p.m., Nov. 15.
The resolution submitted by Sen.
Jeft Stoler for the Hammer and Coffin
slate stated in part, "The present cus
tom of meeting in rather remote cir
cumstances has a tendency to allow
senators to act differently than would
he in their constituents' best interest."
James Siena, legal adviser to the
president, spoke to the senate in an
attempt to dissuade it from trying to
convene the Committee of 15 (C-15)

this year.
Siena said he felt that students
would try to gain a majority in all judi
cial cases, and that the attempt would
be futile because he, President Richard
Lyman and the faculty in general
would not want a student majority.
The C-15 is a university-wide judi
cial body which proposes amend
ments to the Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 19(5H.
Siena claimed that the administra
tion is "fundamentally satisfied with
the rules and regulations.
"The basic system is fair. 1 see no
pros, and 1 see quite a few cons to re
convening the C-15. I urge you not to
act this evening. You will put a lot ot
people to a lot of work that very well
may result in nothing," Siena said.
Stoler said he felt that "Siena maybe
trying to stamp on students now to
keep them from completely taking

over later."
ASSU President Vic Petroff said
Siena felt that "students have nothing
lett to ask except for a student majority
on general cases. Siena's mind isn't
open to other kinds of questions. We're
not even sure what the questions are
yet . . . . I do feel that the random selec
tion process (of the Stanford Judicial
Council) is unfair."
Also, Petroff said students should be
able to complain of faculty violation of
the Honor Code.
"We've all been in classes where the
prof illegally stayed in the exam room.
I never thought about charging the fa
culty with violation of the Honor Code.
That's the kind of reason we should
have to reconvene the C-15." Petroff
said.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Randy Bird said last week that if the
senate decided to hold a special re
ferendum election to determine
whether the C-15 will convene this
year, it would cost approximately
$300.
The senate deferred the issue, and
set up a special committee to further
investigate the matter.
A resolution suggesting that the se
nate urge a "full reinstatement on the
campus" of the Delta Tau Delta frater
nity for the 1977-7H school year was
submitted by Senators Dan Livingston,
Rick Morrow and David Sharp but was

not passed by the senate.
However, a similar resolution spon
sored by Sen. Steve Wurzburg urging
"the administration to act affirma
tively" to allow the fraternity back on
campus was passed with the approval
of the authors of the original resolu
tion.
Delt Steve Schwarz said the resolu
tion, passed by a vote of 12 to 3, "won't
do anything per se. It's just another
bird in the hand for the Delts. It will be
on the positive side for the Delts when
we go before the university."
Senate Chairman Patrick Hall also
apologized to the senate for not fully
answering question at the last
senate meeting regarding an alleged
deal in which Hall agreed to appoint
Livingston as chairman of the Finance
Committee in exchange for support
from Livingston's slate for his (Hall's)
chairmanship.
"1 didn't answer Mr. Petroff's ques
tion (concerning the matter) com
pletely honestly. I'd like to apologize
to the senate for my answer. I made no
explicit deals," said Hall.
"There may have been an implicit
deal. I'm the only one who can say. We
(Livingston and Hall) got together and
talked. He said that he would like to be
chairman. I said 'Okay, I'll think about
it.' I would have appointed him . . . but
solely on the basis of his competence,"
Hall said.

senators to act differently than would
he in their constituents' best interest."
James Siena, legal adviser to the
president, spoke to the senate in an
attempt to dissuade it from trying to
convene the Committee of 15 (C-15)

this year.
Siena said he felt that students
would try to gain a majority in all judi
cial cases, and that the attempt would
be futile because he, President Richard
Lyman and the faculty in general
would not want a student majority.
The C-15 is a university-wide judi
cial body which proposes amend
ments to the Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 19(5H.
Siena claimed that the administra
tion is "fundamentally satisfied with
the rules and regulations.
"The basic system is fair. 1 see no
pros, and 1 see quite a few cons to re
convening the C-15. I urge you not to
act this evening. You will put a lot ot
people to a lot of work that very well
may result in nothing," Siena said.
Stoler said he felt that "Siena maybe
trying to stamp on students now to
keep them from completely taking

over later."
ASSU President Vic Petroff said
Siena felt that "students have nothing
lett to ask except for a student majority
on general cases. Siena's mind isn't
open to other kinds of questions. We're
not even sure what the questions are
yet . . . . I do feel that the random selec
tion process (of the Stanford Judicial
Council) is unfair."
Also, Petroff said students should be
able to complain of faculty violation of
the Honor Code.
"We've all been in classes where the
prof illegally stayed in the exam room.
I never thought about charging the fa
culty with violation of the Honor Code.
That's the kind of reason we should
have to reconvene the C-15." Petroff
said.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Randy Bird said last week that if the
senate decided to hold a special re
ferendum election to determine
whether the C-15 will convene this
year, it would cost approximately
$300.
The senate deferred the issue, and
set up a special committee to further
investigate the matter.
A resolution suggesting that the se
nate urge a "full reinstatement on the
campus" of the Delta Tau Delta frater
nity for the 1977-7H school year was
submitted by Senators Dan Livingston,
Rick Morrow and David Sharp but was

not passed by the senate.
However, a similar resolution spon
sored by Sen. Steve Wurzburg urging
"the administration to act affirma
tively" to allow the fraternity back on
campus was passed with the approval
of the authors of the original resolu
tion.
Delt Steve Schwarz said the resolu
tion, passed by a vote of 12 to 3, "won't
do anything per se. It's just another
bird in the hand for the Delts. It will be
on the positive side for the Delts when
we go before the university."
Senate Chairman Patrick Hall also
apologized to the senate for not fully
answering question at the last
senate meeting regarding an alleged
deal in which Hall agreed to appoint
Livingston as chairman of the Finance
Committee in exchange for support
from Livingston's slate for his (Hall's)
chairmanship.
"1 didn't answer Mr. Petroff's ques
tion (concerning the matter) com
pletely honestly. I'd like to apologize
to the senate for my answer. I made no
explicit deals," said Hall.
"There may have been an implicit
deal. I'm the only one who can say. We
(Livingston and Hall) got together and
talked. He said that he would like to be
chairman. I said 'Okay, I'll think about
it.' I would have appointed him . . . but
solely on the basis of his competence,"
Hall said.
The ASSU Semite voted last night to
meet in university residences for the
remainder of the year because the
senators agreed that meetings in the
Craduate School of Business are too
"remote" from the students whom
they represent.
In an attempt to encourage students
to attend their sessions, the senate will
hold its next meeting <it the Wilbur
dining hall at 7:30 p.m., Nov. 15.
The resolution submitted by Sen.
Jeft Stoler for the Hammer and Coffin
slate stated in part, "The present cus
tom of meeting in rather remote cir
cumstances has a tendency to allow
senators to act differently than would
he in their constituents' best interest."
