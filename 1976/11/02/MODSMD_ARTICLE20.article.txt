# 'Sport of kings' reigns on
## 
### Peter Bennett 
Where can you have a picnic, watch a cavalry
charge nine times daily and enjoy an indigenous
lend ot cigar smoke and buttered popcorn in the
bay Area? Hay Meadows race track, of course.
At the heart of the' »'s broad appeal is its rich
tradition of comp. thoroughbred racing. The
San Mateo course, v. .iich is located 12 miles north
of Stanford, has seen great horses and jockeys
perform over the one mile oval since 1934.
The immortal Seabiscuit twice won the Bay
Meadows Handicap, and Citation, the 1948 Triple
Crown winner, launched the great comeback here
that was to make him the turf's first equine mil
lionaire. Also, Bill Shoemaker, the world's win
ningest jockey, began his career at the Meadows
in 194 H.
Entrance to the "sport of kings" is $2.25 and a
dollar for parking.
"Admission is cheaper than a movie in Palo
Alto or a 49er football game," according to Rich
Pearl man, assistant publicity director for Bay
Meadows.
Women are admitted to the grandstand area
every Thursday except Thanksgiving Day for
5i.25. Friday men receive the same special dis
count.
The infield provides picnic areas and ample
space to kick back or toss I 'risbees. There are re
freshment stands as well as tellers to receive your
bets.
Elaborate ritual
There is quite an elaborate ritual that surrounds
each race at Bay Meadows. The horses are led
from the stables to the paddock area by their re
spective trainers. The horses then parade around
the walking ring in full view of the public. Some
thoroughbreds smack their lips, sneeze, roll their
eyes and stare out from behi nd their cumbersome
blinkers. Appreciative fans are more apt to lather
than the horses themselves.
The colorful jockeys, clad in the riding silks of
their respective stables, enter the prized circle,
receive last-minute riding instructions and then
take their mounts. A bugle call greets their en
trance onto the main track.
Now the handicappers enter directly into the
race. They glance over the daily racing form,
check the charts and then flock to the gaming
windows to get their bets down in time for the
race. Of course, not everybody makes the mad
dash. Some people just enjoy watching the others.
Tense excitement
When the starter cocks the red flag, tense ex
citement grips the crowd. It murmurs a last
second "1 should have" and "1 told you so."
The flag slashing the air signals the start of the
race. The crowd is momentarily silent, begrudg
ing whatever control they had over the race to the
horse. Once they enter the stretch, the fans use the
program in much the same fashion as the jockey

uses his whip to push his horse across the wire
first.
When the winning numbers flash across the
totalizator board, the post-race scramble begins.
Winners rush to the cashier's window to reap the
profits of their handicapping skills. Losers,
meanwhile, settle back into their seats, dipping
their heads between the pages of the racing digest
to chart the next race.
Therapy
Many fans come to Bay Meadows, believe it or
not. tor therapeutic reasons. They claim it gives
them a chance to unwind and relax. One rumor
circulating is that a man who was permanently
disabled and confined to a wheelchair leaped up
to cash his winning $10 ticket, only to discover
upon return that his wheelchair was missing.
Although Bay Meadows is proud of the fact that
racing is the number one spectator sport in
America, it is still sensitive to critics who insist
that it is pure gambling.
"It that's true." said Pearlman, "so is the stock
market, or for that matter, any professional sports
venture."
"An owner invests in certain basketball players
to form a better team. General Motors makes cars a
foot shorter to make more money. We're no diffe
rent from any other business."
Pearlman also thinks the proposed 20 per cent
withholding tax on all winnings over $1000 will
hurt the fans.
"The casual bettor playing his favorite numbers
or names won't come out as often if he knows he
has to pay a tax," he said.
Every year horse racing generates nearly $100
million in revenue for California. The withhold
ing tax could jeopardize that money.
"The big bettor will take his business to a
bookie where he pays no tax at all," added the
assistant director.
Internal problems
Racing, like any sport, has its internal prob
lems, but the fans keep pouring through the
turnstiles.
rhe Giants may draw only 1500 fans or so for a
game, but even in the pouring rain we get 7000,"
Pearlman said.
This enthusiasm for the sport is shared bv four
Stanford students who appropriately bought and
named their horse "Our Tuition." After ex
periencing numerous difficulties, which in
cluded a strike at Golden Gate, the horse finally
raced last week at the Meadows. He went off at
17-1. and not surprisingly, only beat one horse.
But that hasn't dampened the owners' optimism
any, because according to the official track recor
der. "Our Tuition" did flash early speed.
Maybe he was a little skittish. At any rate, "Our
Tuition" will run again in one of those nine
cavalry charges run Tuesday through Saturday at
Bav Meadows.

ing tax could jeopardize that money.
"The big bettor will take his business to a
bookie where he pays no tax at all," added the
assistant director.
Internal problems
Racing, like any sport, has its internal prob
lems, but the fans keep pouring through the
turnstiles.
rhe Giants may draw only 1500 fans or so for a
game, but even in the pouring rain we get 7000,"
Pearlman said.
This enthusiasm for the sport is shared bv four
Stanford students who appropriately bought and
named their horse "Our Tuition." After ex
periencing numerous difficulties, which in
cluded a strike at Golden Gate, the horse finally
raced last week at the Meadows. He went off at
17-1. and not surprisingly, only beat one horse.
But that hasn't dampened the owners' optimism
any, because according to the official track recor
der. "Our Tuition" did flash early speed.
Maybe he was a little skittish. At any rate, "Our
Tuition" will run again in one of those nine
cavalry charges run Tuesday through Saturday at
Bav Meadows.




They're off and running
Twelve miles north of campus there's a course you probably
haven't studied before. Bay Meadows is one race course

where horses and their jockeys have been performinq since
1934. a
Where can you have a picnic, watch a cavalry
charge nine times daily and enjoy an indigenous
lend ot cigar smoke and buttered popcorn in the
bay Area? Hay Meadows race track, of course.
At the heart of the' »'s broad appeal is its rich
tradition of comp. thoroughbred racing. The
San Mateo course, v. .iich is located 12 miles north
of Stanford, has seen great horses and jockeys
perform over the one mile oval since 1934.
The immortal Seabiscuit twice won the Bay
Meadows Handicap, and Citation, the 1948 Triple
Crown winner, launched the great comeback here
that was to make him the turf's first equine mil
lionaire. Also, Bill Shoemaker, the world's win
ningest jockey, began his career at the Meadows
in 194 H.
Entrance to the "sport of kings" is $2.25 and a
dollar for parking.
"Admission is cheaper than a movie in Palo
Alto or a 49er football game," according to Rich
Pearl man, assistant publicity director for Bay
Meadows.
Women are admitted to the grandstand area
every Thursday except Thanksgiving Day for
5i.25. Friday men receive the same special dis
count.
The infield provides picnic areas and ample
space to kick back or toss I 'risbees. There are re
freshment stands as well as tellers to receive your
bets.
Elaborate ritual
There is quite an elaborate ritual that surrounds
each race at Bay Meadows. The horses are led
from the stables to the paddock area by their re
spective trainers. The horses then parade around
the walking ring in full view of the public. Some
thoroughbreds smack their lips, sneeze, roll their
eyes and stare out from behi nd their cumbersome
blinkers. Appreciative fans are more apt to lather
than the horses themselves.
The colorful jockeys, clad in the riding silks of
their respective stables, enter the prized circle,
receive last-minute riding instructions and then
take their mounts. A bugle call greets their en
trance onto the main track.
Now the handicappers enter directly into the
race. They glance over the daily racing form,
check the charts and then flock to the gaming
windows to get their bets down in time for the
race. Of course, not everybody makes the mad
dash. Some people just enjoy watching the others.
Tense excitement
When the starter cocks the red flag, tense ex
citement grips the crowd. It murmurs a last
second "1 should have" and "1 told you so."
The flag slashing the air signals the start of the
race. The crowd is momentarily silent, begrudg
ing whatever control they had over the race to the
horse. Once they enter the stretch, the fans use the
program in much the same fashion as the jockey

uses his whip to push his horse across the wire
first.
When the winning numbers flash across the
totalizator board, the post-race scramble begins.
Winners rush to the cashier's window to reap the
profits of their handicapping skills. Losers,
meanwhile, settle back into their seats, dipping
their heads between the pages of the racing digest
to chart the next race.
Therapy
Many fans come to Bay Meadows, believe it or
not. tor therapeutic reasons. They claim it gives
them a chance to unwind and relax. One rumor
circulating is that a man who was permanently
disabled and confined to a wheelchair leaped up
to cash his winning $10 ticket, only to discover
upon return that his wheelchair was missing.
Although Bay Meadows is proud of the fact that
racing is the number one spectator sport in
America, it is still sensitive to critics who insist
that it is pure gambling.
"It that's true." said Pearlman, "so is the stock
market, or for that matter, any professional sports
venture."
"An owner invests in certain basketball players
to form a better team. General Motors makes cars a
foot shorter to make more money. We're no diffe
rent from any other business."
Pearlman also thinks the proposed 20 per cent
withholding tax on all winnings over $1000 will
hurt the fans.
"The casual bettor playing his favorite numbers
or names won't come out as often if he knows he
has to pay a tax," he said.

million in revenue for California. The withhold
ing tax could jeopardize that money.

Winners rush to the cashier's window to reap the
profits of their handicapping skills. Losers,
meanwhile, settle back into their seats, dipping
their heads between the pages of the racing digest
to chart the next race.
Therapy
Many fans come to Bay Meadows, believe it or
not. tor therapeutic reasons. They claim it gives
them a chance to unwind and relax. One rumor
circulating is that a man who was permanently
disabled and confined to a wheelchair leaped up
to cash his winning $10 ticket, only to discover
upon return that his wheelchair was missing.
Although Bay Meadows is proud of the fact that
racing is the number one spectator sport in
America, it is still sensitive to critics who insist
that it is pure gambling.
"It that's true." said Pearlman, "so is the stock
market, or for that matter, any professional sports
venture."
"An owner invests in certain basketball players
to form a better team. General Motors makes cars a
foot shorter to make more money. We're no diffe
rent from any other business."
Pearlman also thinks the proposed 20 per cent
withholding tax on all winnings over $1000 will
hurt the fans.
"The casual bettor playing his favorite numbers
or names won't come out as often if he knows he
has to pay a tax," he said.
Every year horse racing generates nearly $100
million in revenue for California. The withhold
ing tax could jeopardize that money.
"The big bettor will take his business to a
bookie where he pays no tax at all," added the
assistant director.
Internal problems
Racing, like any sport, has its internal prob
lems, but the fans keep pouring through the
turnstiles.
rhe Giants may draw only 1500 fans or so for a
game, but even in the pouring rain we get 7000,"
Pearlman said.
This enthusiasm for the sport is shared bv four
Stanford students who appropriately bought and
named their horse "Our Tuition." After ex
periencing numerous difficulties, which in
cluded a strike at Golden Gate, the horse finally
raced last week at the Meadows. He went off at
17-1. and not surprisingly, only beat one horse.
But that hasn't dampened the owners' optimism
any, because according to the official track recor
der. "Our Tuition" did flash early speed.
Maybe he was a little skittish. At any rate, "Our
Tuition" will run again in one of those nine
cavalry charges run Tuesday through Saturday at
Bav Meadows.




They're off and running
Twelve miles north of campus there's a course you probably
haven't studied before. Bay Meadows is one race course

where horses and their jockeys have been performinq since
1934. a
Where can you have a picnic, watch a cavalry
charge nine times daily and enjoy an indigenous
lend ot cigar smoke and buttered popcorn in the
bay Area? Hay Meadows race track, of course.
At the heart of the' »'s broad appeal is its rich
tradition of comp. thoroughbred racing. The
San Mateo course, v. .iich is located 12 miles north
of Stanford, has seen great horses and jockeys
perform over the one mile oval since 1934.
The immortal Seabiscuit twice won the Bay
Meadows Handicap, and Citation, the 1948 Triple
Crown winner, launched the great comeback here
that was to make him the turf's first equine mil
lionaire. Also, Bill Shoemaker, the world's win
ningest jockey, began his career at the Meadows
in 194 H.
Entrance to the "sport of kings" is $2.25 and a
dollar for parking.
"Admission is cheaper than a movie in Palo
Alto or a 49er football game," according to Rich
Pearl man, assistant publicity director for Bay
Meadows.
Women are admitted to the grandstand area
every Thursday except Thanksgiving Day for
5i.25. Friday men receive the same special dis
count.
The infield provides picnic areas and ample
space to kick back or toss I 'risbees. There are re
freshment stands as well as tellers to receive your
bets.
Elaborate ritual
There is quite an elaborate ritual that surrounds
each race at Bay Meadows. The horses are led
from the stables to the paddock area by their re
spective trainers. The horses then parade around
the walking ring in full view of the public. Some
thoroughbreds smack their lips, sneeze, roll their
eyes and stare out from behi nd their cumbersome
blinkers. Appreciative fans are more apt to lather
than the horses themselves.
The colorful jockeys, clad in the riding silks of
their respective stables, enter the prized circle,
receive last-minute riding instructions and then
take their mounts. A bugle call greets their en
trance onto the main track.
Now the handicappers enter directly into the
race. They glance over the daily racing form,
check the charts and then flock to the gaming
windows to get their bets down in time for the
race. Of course, not everybody makes the mad
dash. Some people just enjoy watching the others.
Tense excitement
When the starter cocks the red flag, tense ex
citement grips the crowd. It murmurs a last
second "1 should have" and "1 told you so."
The flag slashing the air signals the start of the
race. The crowd is momentarily silent, begrudg
ing whatever control they had over the race to the
horse. Once they enter the stretch, the fans use the
program in much the same fashion as the jockey

uses his whip to push his horse across the wire
first.
