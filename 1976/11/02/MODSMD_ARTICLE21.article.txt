# Watsons, Fahey sell out
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
Doc Watson, considered by many to he the best
'acoustic guitar player alive today, is still perform
ing one of the finest acts anyone could hope to see.
Doc and his son Merle, along with John Fahey.
played before two virtual sellouts at Memorial
Auditorium last Saturday evening. Doc once
again showed that he is not only a highly skilled
guitarist, but also a top-notch entertainer.
Watson, 52, started his professional career
when he was 29, but it wasn't until 1960 that a
folklorist discovered him on a trip to the South.
Since then he has been a dominant force in the
revival of traditional music of that region. Not
only has he helped revive traditional American
music, but he also has almost single-handedly
elevated the flat-top guitar to the stature of a lead
instrument (much like Segovia has done for the
classical guitar).
Harmonica was the first instrument that Doc
Watson played. Then he learned banjo on a fret
less banjo that his father made forhim. Finally, a
few years later he purchased his first guitar. Influ
ences in those early days included people like
Jimmie Rodgers. the Delmore Brothers and Clar
ence Ashley. Later on. after Doc was a regular on
the folk music circuit, he came into contact with
and was heavily influenced by one of the finest
blues guitarists of all time. "Misssissippi" John
Hurt. ,
'lust the best'
Watson is not a flashy guitarist, just the best. His
unwaning dedication to perfection in his music is
expressed in a style that is always precise and
clear.
During the first showthe Watson team surveyed
music from blues, traditional mountain tunes,
bluegrass. and country. Doc did not, however.

relegate himself to just the old songs. In addition
to playing old blues tunes like "Roll on Buddy",
he sang Tom Paxton's "That Was the Last Thing
on My Mind" and"St. James Infirmary", a more
modern version of an older blues song. He man
aged to get in a few hot licks on the guitar, too,
when he played "Sweet Georgia Brown".
The audience was polite and received Doc very
well. It is unfortunate, however, that they didn't
participate more. Doc's informal style lends itself
to a little hand-clapping and foot-stomping. Doc
said that he and Merle were always informal "be
cause we just don't know no other way to be". But
tor the most part theaudience reserved everything
until after each number and then they broke into
what was nevertheless very enthusiastic
applause.
Amusing tales
Doc told a couple of amusing tales between
songs and wrapped up the first show with "Mama
Don't Allow No Music" featuring some fine slide
guitar by Merle. But the crowd wouldn't let them
leave without an encore, so they did "Tennessee
Stud" the way that only Doc Watson can do it.
John Fahey appeared as the first act in Saturday
night's show. His set was relatively short to the
dismay of some but to the relief of others. Fahey,
who is exclusively an instrumentalist on guitar,
did not introducea single song that hephfvedand
seemed to completely disregard his audience. But
he does have an interesting finger-picking style.
He plays in an almost lyrical manner that sounds
somewhat like Leo kottke but is more akin to the
Eastern sitar music that contains a heavy droning
quality. Although his style perhaps explores a
new genre of acoustic guitar music, the similarity
of the songs and their long duration sometimes
seemed unbearable to this reviewer.
