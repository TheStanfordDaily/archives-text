# Communists in Mem Aud?
## House hearings become a play 
### Eric Small Sue Hoover 
Are You Now or Have You
Ever Beenplay dealing
with the terror of the McCarthy
era, showed Thursday night at
Memorial Auditorium, and was
a total letdown. Although
characterized by superb acting,
the play fails miserably in terms
of depicting the actual feeling
surrounding the 1950 s in
America.
There can be no doubt about
the accuracy of the dialogue
used in the play, for one can
hardly question direct quotes
taken from hearings before the
Un-American Activities Com
mittee. What is questionable,
and in fact mitrageous, is the
selection of the particular quotes
and circumstances that were de
picted. That is to say, the hear
ings and parts of hearings that
were singled out as the most in
dicative of the era were mislead
ing and above all, incomplete.
The audience laughs its way
through one of the most infam
ous eras of American history.
The audience is not encouraged
to look beyond the laughs that
certain witnesses draw while on
the stand. No serious thought is
given to the effects of the mas
sive blacklists, and the terror of
the era. Worst of all, the actual
murders by the American gov
ernment of so-cal led Communist
spies are overlooked.
'Neo-fascist committee'
The characters that confront
us give no indication as to the
massive opposition that existed
to this neo-fascist committee.
The majority are sniveling,
self-prostituted squealers. There
is no doubt that they existed. The
hope and the progressive spirit
of change that grew out of this
era, however, is virtually ig
nored.

Perhaps the most positive fi
gure in the entire play was that of
F'aul Robeson. Even here, how
ever, the author (Eric Bentley)
cannot communicate the full
scope of the resistance to the
Un-American Activities Com
mittee. An overview of the era is
required to teach us the disastr
ous effects of complacency. We
are not shown the legacy of
righteous morality, of strength,
courage and dignity, that is
rightfully ours.
Robeson's resistance was
moral, in the purest sense of the
word, but not broad enough in
its scope. The fight of the black
race for its rights during the fif
ties is relevant, and of extreme
importance, yet it forms only
part of the whole picture of the
growing social consciousness.
The play was lacking seriously
in its ability to convey a spirit
that moved thousands of Ameri
cans to resist the Committee.
This resistance was enacted o,n
the principle that an individual
would not cooperate with an arm
of the government that was de
nying not only the rights of
blacks, but of all people all ac
ross the nation.
Humorous characterization
The characterization is
humorous, and in fact, quite pro
fessionally done. 1 have no bones
to pick with the actors, for they
were all superb. The composi
tion of the play, however, makes
the terror of the McCarthy era
seem like second-rate humor. It
is this gross misrepresentation
that makes the play so objection
able. The author fails to create a
gripping story that could teach
us some lessons. Are we naive
enough to assume that if we
laugh at the situation, it won't
reoccur? McCarthyism is not
gone forever.

Eric Bentley's play, Are You
Now or Have You Ever Been
spans 11 years of the Commit
tee's probing into Communism
in the film industry. Producers,
actors, and writers testified
under oath in Memorial Au
ditorium Thursday night in a
production sponsored by the
Lively Arts at Stanford.
"This is the most difficult
thing I have ever done," said sc
reen star Larry Parks (Phillip R.
Allen), burying his head in his
hands before revealing names of
others in his Party cell. After his
sessions with the Committee he
was left with a self-predicted
ruined career, very few friends
and an imminent nervous
breakdown.
The dialogue of the play is the
actual testimony of the witnes
ses, taken verbatim from trans
cripts of the hearings. Americans
seem to have a partiality for
courtroom drama, and this was it
at its finest, complete with flag
center stage.
Bentley's play flowed well
considering the limits of the
dialogue, the time span covered
and the number of characters in
troduced. There was an intrigu
ing balance in the play, in both
scene length and content.
Semantics and shtik
In the second act, which is
shorter and lighter than the first
and third, Abe Burrows (Allan
Miller) provided wonderful
comic relief in trying to semanti
cally sidestep the Committee
with lots of shtik. "There is no
thing humorous in the New Mus
ses," he said, waving his large
hands. He often played the piano
at parties where possibly
"Communists were present."
The inflections and timing of
the actors were superb. The
chairman (Michael Dan Wagner)
presided with a deafening gavel
and a bantering demeanor, and
in wielding his congressional
authority he managed to control
the events on stage more than the
investigator (Allan Williams).
The question he pursued the
most ruthlessly was, of course.
"Are you now, or have you ever
been a member of the Com

munist Party?"
In the third act, Lillian
Hellman (Kevyne Barr) and
Lionel Stander (Wynn Irwin)
stood up for their rights. Stander
was most vehement, as he had
been blacklisted and ruined. He
called the Committee a "Spanish
Inquisition" and worked himself
into a frenzy condemning the
Committee, its witnesses, and
anti-Communism in general.
Paul Robeson (Sil Words), the
last witness and strongest
character in the play, began the
third act by demanding to know
who was addressing him and
then invoked the Fifth Amend
ment at every question.
Excellent summation
Act 111 is an excellent summa
tion of the play. Paul Robeson is
the only totally coherent and
confident witness. Sil Words'
voice and demeanor carried the
scene, with all the other actors,
particularly the chairman,
playing up to him. The argument
was so intense and well fought
that the hearings closed with sh
outing and thumps of the gavel.
Are You Now or Have You
ever Been. . ..? is a relevant play
today, paricularly because of its
transcript style. The basic ques
tions of control and beliefs are
explored. In a program insert,
author Eric Bentley gives a quote
from Chairman Wood which
suggests the Committee's pur
poses and views:
"If, by any action of this Com
mittee, we could be instrumental
in eliminating from the field of
public entertainment the views
of people, particularly the youth
who decline to answer a ques
tion as to whether they are mem
bers of the Communist Party, it
would make me extremely
happy."

Now or Have You Ever Been
spans 11 years of the Commit
tee's probing into Communism
in the film industry. Producers,
actors, and writers testified
under oath in Memorial Au
ditorium Thursday night in a
production sponsored by the
Lively Arts at Stanford.
"This is the most difficult
thing I have ever done," said sc
reen star Larry Parks (Phillip R.
Allen), burying his head in his
hands before revealing names of
others in his Party cell. After his
sessions with the Committee he
was left with a self-predicted
ruined career, very few friends
and an imminent nervous
breakdown.
The dialogue of the play is the
actual testimony of the witnes
ses, taken verbatim from trans
cripts of the hearings. Americans
seem to have a partiality for
courtroom drama, and this was it
at its finest, complete with flag
center stage.
Bentley's play flowed well
considering the limits of the
dialogue, the time span covered
and the number of characters in
troduced. There was an intrigu
ing balance in the play, in both
scene length and content.
Semantics and shtik
In the second act, which is
shorter and lighter than the first
and third, Abe Burrows (Allan
Miller) provided wonderful
comic relief in trying to semanti
cally sidestep the Committee
with lots of shtik. "There is no
thing humorous in the New Mus
ses," he said, waving his large
hands. He often played the piano
at parties where possibly
"Communists were present."
The inflections and timing of
the actors were superb. The
chairman (Michael Dan Wagner)
presided with a deafening gavel
and a bantering demeanor, and
in wielding his congressional
authority he managed to control
the events on stage more than the
investigator (Allan Williams).
The question he pursued the
most ruthlessly was, of course.
"Are you now, or have you ever
been a member of the Com

munist Party?"
In the third act, Lillian
Hellman (Kevyne Barr) and
Lionel Stander (Wynn Irwin)
stood up for their rights. Stander
was most vehement, as he had
been blacklisted and ruined. He
called the Committee a "Spanish
Inquisition" and worked himself
into a frenzy condemning the
Committee, its witnesses, and
anti-Communism in general.
Paul Robeson (Sil Words), the
last witness and strongest
character in the play, began the
third act by demanding to know
who was addressing him and
then invoked the Fifth Amend
ment at every question.
Excellent summation
Act 111 is an excellent summa
tion of the play. Paul Robeson is
the only totally coherent and
confident witness. Sil Words'
voice and demeanor carried the
scene, with all the other actors,
particularly the chairman,
playing up to him. The argument
was so intense and well fought
that the hearings closed with sh
outing and thumps of the gavel.
Are You Now or Have You
ever Been. . ..? is a relevant play
today, paricularly because of its
transcript style. The basic ques
tions of control and beliefs are
explored. In a program insert,
author Eric Bentley gives a quote
from Chairman Wood which
suggests the Committee's pur
poses and views:
"If, by any action of this Com
mittee, we could be instrumental
in eliminating from the field of
public entertainment the views
of people, particularly the youth
who decline to answer a ques
tion as to whether they are mem
bers of the Communist Party, it
would make me extremely
happy."

Are You Now or Have You
Ever Beenplay dealing
with the terror of the McCarthy
era, showed Thursday night at
Memorial Auditorium, and was
a total letdown. Although
characterized by superb acting,
the play fails miserably in terms
of depicting the actual feeling
surrounding the 1950 s in
America.
There can be no doubt about
the accuracy of the dialogue
used in the play, for one can
hardly question direct quotes
taken from hearings before the
Un-American Activities Com
mittee. What is questionable,
and in fact mitrageous, is the
selection of the particular quotes
and circumstances that were de
picted. That is to say, the hear
ings and parts of hearings that
were singled out as the most in
dicative of the era were mislead
ing and above all, incomplete.
The audience laughs its way
through one of the most infam
ous eras of American history.
The audience is not encouraged
to look beyond the laughs that
certain witnesses draw while on
the stand. No serious thought is
given to the effects of the mas
sive blacklists, and the terror of
the era. Worst of all, the actual
murders by the American gov
ernment of so-cal led Communist
spies are overlooked.
'Neo-fascist committee'
The characters that confront
us give no indication as to the
massive opposition that existed
to this neo-fascist committee.
The majority are sniveling,
self-prostituted squealers. There
is no doubt that they existed. The
hope and the progressive spirit
of change that grew out of this
era, however, is virtually ig
nored.

Perhaps the most positive fi
gure in the entire play was that of
F'aul Robeson. Even here, how
ever, the author (Eric Bentley)
cannot communicate the full
scope of the resistance to the
Un-American Activities Com
mittee. An overview of the era is
required to teach us the disastr
ous effects of complacency. We
are not shown the legacy of
righteous morality, of strength,
courage and dignity, that is
rightfully ours.
Robeson's resistance was
moral, in the purest sense of the
word, but not broad enough in
its scope. The fight of the black
race for its rights during the fif
ties is relevant, and of extreme
importance, yet it forms only
part of the whole picture of the
growing social consciousness.
The play was lacking seriously
in its ability to convey a spirit
that moved thousands of Ameri
cans to resist the Committee.
This resistance was enacted o,n
the principle that an individual
would not cooperate with an arm
of the government that was de
nying not only the rights of
blacks, but of all people all ac
ross the nation.
Humorous characterization
The characterization is
humorous, and in fact, quite pro
fessionally done. 1 have no bones
to pick with the actors, for they
were all superb. The composi
tion of the play, however, makes
the terror of the McCarthy era
seem like second-rate humor. It
is this gross misrepresentation
that makes the play so objection
able. The author fails to create a
gripping story that could teach
us some lessons. Are we naive
enough to assume that if we
laugh at the situation, it won't
reoccur? McCarthyism is not
gone forever.

Forced by treachery to defend herself against false charges of
infidelity, Desdemona (Deborah May) confronts suspicious
husband (John Hancock) at the Geary Theater.
Are You Now or Have You
Ever Beenplay dealing
with the terror of the McCarthy
era, showed Thursday night at
Memorial Auditorium, and was
a total letdown. Although
characterized by superb acting,
the play fails miserably in terms
of depicting the actual feeling
surrounding the 1950 s in
America.
There can be no doubt about
the accuracy of the dialogue
used in the play, for one can
hardly question direct quotes
taken from hearings before the
Un-American Activities Com
mittee. What is questionable,
and in fact mitrageous, is the
selection of the particular quotes
and circumstances that were de
picted. That is to say, the hear
ings and parts of hearings that
were singled out as the most in
dicative of the era were mislead
ing and above all, incomplete.
The audience laughs its way
through one of the most infam
ous eras of American history.
The audience is not encouraged
to look beyond the laughs that
certain witnesses draw while on
the stand. No serious thought is
given to the effects of the mas
sive blacklists, and the terror of
the era. Worst of all, the actual
murders by the American gov
ernment of so-cal led Communist
spies are overlooked.
'Neo-fascist committee'
The characters that confront
us give no indication as to the
massive opposition that existed
to this neo-fascist committee.
The majority are sniveling,
self-prostituted squealers. There
is no doubt that they existed. The
hope and the progressive spirit
of change that grew out of this
era, however, is virtually ig
nored.

Perhaps the most positive fi
gure in the entire play was that of
F'aul Robeson. Even here, how
ever, the author (Eric Bentley)
cannot communicate the full
scope of the resistance to the
Un-American Activities Com
mittee. An overview of the era is
required to teach us the disastr
ous effects of complacency. We
are not shown the legacy of
righteous morality, of strength,
courage and dignity, that is
rightfully ours.
Robeson's resistance was
moral, in the purest sense of the
word, but not broad enough in
its scope. The fight of the black
race for its rights during the fif
ties is relevant, and of extreme
importance, yet it forms only
part of the whole picture of the
growing social consciousness.
The play was lacking seriously
in its ability to convey a spirit
that moved thousands of Ameri
cans to resist the Committee.
This resistance was enacted o,n
the principle that an individual
would not cooperate with an arm
of the government that was de
nying not only the rights of
blacks, but of all people all ac
ross the nation.
Humorous characterization
The characterization is
humorous, and in fact, quite pro
fessionally done. 1 have no bones
to pick with the actors, for they
were all superb. The composi
tion of the play, however, makes
the terror of the McCarthy era
seem like second-rate humor. It
is this gross misrepresentation
that makes the play so objection
able. The author fails to create a
gripping story that could teach
us some lessons. Are we naive
enough to assume that if we
laugh at the situation, it won't
reoccur? McCarthyism is not
gone forever.

Eric Bentley's play, Are You
Now or Have You Ever Been
spans 11 years of the Commit
tee's probing into Communism
in the film industry. Producers,
actors, and writers testified
under oath in Memorial Au
ditorium Thursday night in a
production sponsored by the
Lively Arts at Stanford.
"This is the most difficult
thing I have ever done," said sc
reen star Larry Parks (Phillip R.
Allen), burying his head in his
hands before revealing names of
others in his Party cell. After his
sessions with the Committee he
was left with a self-predicted
ruined career, very few friends
and an imminent nervous
breakdown.
The dialogue of the play is the
actual testimony of the witnes
ses, taken verbatim from trans
cripts of the hearings. Americans
seem to have a partiality for
courtroom drama, and this was it
at its finest, complete with flag
center stage.
Bentley's play flowed well
considering the limits of the
dialogue, the time span covered
and the number of characters in
troduced. There was an intrigu
ing balance in the play, in both
scene length and content.
Semantics and shtik
In the second act, which is
shorter and lighter than the first
and third, Abe Burrows (Allan
Miller) provided wonderful
comic relief in trying to semanti
cally sidestep the Committee
with lots of shtik. "There is no
thing humorous in the New Mus
ses," he said, waving his large
hands. He often played the piano
at parties where possibly
"Communists were present."
The inflections and timing of
the actors were superb. The
chairman (Michael Dan Wagner)
presided with a deafening gavel
and a bantering demeanor, and
in wielding his congressional
authority he managed to control
the events on stage more than the
investigator (Allan Williams).
The question he pursued the
most ruthlessly was, of course.
"Are you now, or have you ever
been a member of the Com

munist Party?"
In the third act, Lillian
Hellman (Kevyne Barr) and
Lionel Stander (Wynn Irwin)
stood up for their rights. Stander
was most vehement, as he had
been blacklisted and ruined. He
called the Committee a "Spanish
Inquisition" and worked himself
into a frenzy condemning the
Committee, its witnesses, and
anti-Communism in general.
Paul Robeson (Sil Words), the
last witness and strongest
character in the play, began the
third act by demanding to know
who was addressing him and
then invoked the Fifth Amend
ment at every question.
Excellent summation
Act 111 is an excellent summa
tion of the play. Paul Robeson is
the only totally coherent and
confident witness. Sil Words'
voice and demeanor carried the
scene, with all the other actors,
particularly the chairman,
playing up to him. The argument
was so intense and well fought
that the hearings closed with sh
outing and thumps of the gavel.
Are You Now or Have You
ever Been. . ..? is a relevant play
today, paricularly because of its
transcript style. The basic ques
tions of control and beliefs are
explored. In a program insert,
author Eric Bentley gives a quote
from Chairman Wood which
suggests the Committee's pur
poses and views:
"If, by any action of this Com
mittee, we could be instrumental
in eliminating from the field of
public entertainment the views
of people, particularly the youth
who decline to answer a ques
tion as to whether they are mem
bers of the Communist Party, it
would make me extremely
happy."

able. The author fails to create a
gripping story that could teach
us some lessons. Are we naive
enough to assume that if we
laugh at the situation, it won't
reoccur? McCarthyism is not
gone forever.

Eric Bentley's play, Are You
Now or Have You Ever Been
spans 11 years of the Commit
tee's probing into Communism
in the film industry. Producers,
actors, and writers testified
under oath in Memorial Au
ditorium Thursday night in a
production sponsored by the
Lively Arts at Stanford.
"This is the most difficult
thing I have ever done," said sc
reen star Larry Parks (Phillip R.
Allen), burying his head in his
hands before revealing names of
others in his Party cell. After his
sessions with the Committee he
was left with a self-predicted
ruined career, very few friends
and an imminent nervous
breakdown.
The dialogue of the play is the
actual testimony of the witnes
ses, taken verbatim from trans
cripts of the hearings. Americans
seem to have a partiality for
courtroom drama, and this was it
at its finest, complete with flag
center stage.
Bentley's play flowed well
considering the limits of the
dialogue, the time span covered
and the number of characters in
troduced. There was an intrigu
ing balance in the play, in both
scene length and content.
Semantics and shtik
In the second act, which is
shorter and lighter than the first
and third, Abe Burrows (Allan
Miller) provided wonderful
comic relief in trying to semanti
cally sidestep the Committee
with lots of shtik. "There is no
thing humorous in the New Mus
ses," he said, waving his large
hands. He often played the piano
at parties where possibly
"Communists were present."
The inflections and timing of
the actors were superb. The
chairman (Michael Dan Wagner)
presided with a deafening gavel
and a bantering demeanor, and
in wielding his congressional
authority he managed to control
the events on stage more than the
investigator (Allan Williams).
The question he pursued the
most ruthlessly was, of course.
"Are you now, or have you ever
been a member of the Com

munist Party?"
In the third act, Lillian
Hellman (Kevyne Barr) and
Lionel Stander (Wynn Irwin)
stood up for their rights. Stander
was most vehement, as he had
been blacklisted and ruined. He
called the Committee a "Spanish
Inquisition" and worked himself
into a frenzy condemning the
Committee, its witnesses, and
anti-Communism in general.
Paul Robeson (Sil Words), the
last witness and strongest
character in the play, began the
third act by demanding to know
who was addressing him and
then invoked the Fifth Amend
ment at every question.
Excellent summation
Act 111 is an excellent summa
tion of the play. Paul Robeson is
the only totally coherent and
confident witness. Sil Words'
voice and demeanor carried the
scene, with all the other actors,
particularly the chairman,
playing up to him. The argument
was so intense and well fought
that the hearings closed with sh
outing and thumps of the gavel.
Are You Now or Have You
ever Been. . ..? is a relevant play
today, paricularly because of its
transcript style. The basic ques
tions of control and beliefs are
explored. In a program insert,
author Eric Bentley gives a quote
from Chairman Wood which
suggests the Committee's pur
poses and views:
"If, by any action of this Com
mittee, we could be instrumental
in eliminating from the field of
public entertainment the views
of people, particularly the youth
who decline to answer a ques
tion as to whether they are mem
bers of the Communist Party, it
would make me extremely
happy."
