### 
Geneva, Switzerland (AP) â€”Britain
has called on black and white Rhode
sian leaders to meet informally today
to discuss fixing a target date for black
majority rule and legal independence
for the break-away British colony.
"I hopethatthe meeting will beheld
tomorrow afternoon." said British dip
lomat Ivor Richard, chairman of the
iive-dav-old Rhodesian settlement
conference.
Through the weekend and vester
dav. Richard had been pressed by each
of the four black nationalist leaders to
set ,i 1077 target date. This would be
sooner than the two-year target to
which Prime Minister lan Smith
said he agreed during Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger's southern Afri
can shuttle in September.
Smith, spokesman for Rhodesia's
277.000 whites, was asked to call on
Richard after the diplomat's meetings
with the representatives of 6.2 million
Rhodesian blacks.
'77 target date?
As Smith left the 90-minute private
session, a reporter asked what he felt
about the reported black demand for a
1077 target date. "I've given no
thought to that." replied Smith. "It's a
new one on me."
Karlier the Rhodesian white leader
let it be known he means to fly home
tomorrow because he is tired of
"twiddling his thumbs" inGeneva and
has important work awaiting him in
Salisbury, bis capital.
One of his main preoccupations is
bou ml to be the escalation of guerrilla
warfare .thing Rhodesia's 800-mile
frontier with Mozambique where
Soviet and Cuban specialists have
been reported training black Rhode
sian "freedom fighters." The casualty
toll among Rhodesian security forces
rose to 84 in October, the highest in
almost lour years of fighting.
Rhodesian commandos raided ac

ross the border into Mozambique over
the weekend and yesterday in retalia
tion for killings of several whites more
than 300 miles away in western
Rhodesia. Informed sources said the
Rhodesians destroyed a camp believed
to be the base for 100 guerrillas.
Mozambique attacked
Mozambique reported yesterday
that it was undergoing the "biggest at
tack ever" by Rhodesian forces. The
Mozambique Information Agency said
the Rhodesian invasion force was
using tanks, mortars, cannons, bom
bers and other aircraft, infantry and
mounted troops.
Mozambique forces fired about
thirty 122 mm rockets into a tea planta
tion near the Rhodesian garrison town
of Umfali in apparent retaliation for
the attack by black and white troops of
the minority government.
The stepped up guerrilla activities
along the border seem to reflect the
warning of intensified conflict each
black leader issued on arriving in
Geneva for the conference, which was
brought about largely as a consequ
ence of Kissinger's initiative.
Shuttle negotiations
Brief, preliminary sessions of the
conference were held Thursday and
Friday, then it recessed while Richard
shuttled between Smith's delegations
and the nationalists to try to resolve
differences over the target date for
black rule and the composition of tin;
interim government. Another formal
conference session was not expected
before tomorrow.
Announcing his decision to call an
informal meeting for today. Richard
told reporters: "As a result of consulta
tions I have come to the conclusion
that the time has now come toconvene
an informal meeting of the heads of
delegations to discuss the issue of the
conference's fixing a date for the inde
pendence of Rhodesia."
