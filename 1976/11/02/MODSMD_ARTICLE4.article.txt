# Ford, Carter make final campaign appearances
## 
### Associated Press 
Amid campaign tumult soon to
yield to the intimate hush of the voting
booth, President Cerald Ford and
Jimmy Carter delivered last night the
final, familiar words of a close contest
for the White House.
Ford went home to Grand Rapids,
Mich., and said in an emotional cam
paign finale that his motto as president
is simple: "What can we do to help
you?"
Carter said the nation needs a presi
dent "who is not part of the establish
ment," and counseled voters against
discouragement that might keep them
from the polls today.
"The promises I've made have been
very cautious, and I'm going to keep
them," Carter said in an election eve
television broadcast.
Ford support
In Detroit, suburban Livonia, then in
Grand Rapids, Ford sought the votes to
guard his home territory against the
Democrat who has whittled his lead
there to a standoff in the last-minute
surveys of voter opinion. "1 am a part
of this great state," said the president.
"1 know you will support me as you
always have."
Democrats sought to turn to their
advantage the episode in which Car
ter's Plains. Ga., Baptist church can
celed Sunday services after a black
minister tried to gain church member
ship and join worshippers there.
Carter told a Sacramento, Calif.,
news conference that he disagreed
with the church deacons who called
off the service, and would work to
eliminate such vestiges of discrimina

tion. but would not resign from the
church.
"I can't resign from the human race
because there's discrimination." he
said. "I can't resign from America tie
cause there's discrimination. I can't
resign from my church because there's
discrimination."
". . . This is not my church, it's
Cod's church," he said. "... There is a
difference between resigning from a
country club and resigning from a
church that is one's life," said Carter.
- So, in its final hours, the campaign
tookanother detour from the issues the
candidates sought to stress, just as it
had in the controversy over Eastern
Europe and over Carter's interview
with Playboy magazine.
TV ads
Both Carter and Ford were appear
ing on each of the three major televi
sion network in 30-minute election
eve broadcasts. It cost them $300,000
apiece, and the programs were essen
tially reviews of what they have said
before, spiced with scenes of their
campaigns and their crowds.
The Ford program included a brief
statement, in effect a summation of his
basic campaign speech, boasting of an
America strong and on the move,

claiming economic progress and
promising more to come.
Candidates' proposals
In it, the president said once again
that he will recommend a personal in
come tax cut, through an increase from
$750 to $1000 in the personal exemp
tion. "...On Jan. 3, when Congress
comes back, 1 will have the tax reduc
tion proposal on their desks." he said.
"YVe have a lot of things to do," l-'ord
said. "Hut we are in shape to do it now
that we are over the hump of the tough
last two years. So we come to the final
round in this election. 1 want your
prayers, as you gave them to me two
years ago. But I would hope that you
would confirm me this time by your
ballots."
The Carter broadcast was a tape al
ready shown in three major states. It
shows Carter in the study of his home
in Plains, answering questions posed
by citizens on the economy, defense
and other issues.
In the South, wheje Carter began, a
broadcast commercial urged voters to
stick with him on "the most important
day of our region's history . . .
"On Nov. 2. the South is being
readmitted to the Union." the ad said.
