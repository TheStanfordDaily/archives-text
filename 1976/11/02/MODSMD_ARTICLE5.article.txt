# Carter's pastor to fight ouster over 'racism'
## 
### 
Plains, Ga. (AP) — Jimmy Carter's
pastor plans to 112 ight a move to dismiss
him because he favors racial integra
tion, but he says he may be leaving the
Plains Baptist Church anyway.
"My plans are to carry it to the
church." Bruce Edwards said yester
day of a church deacons' secret vote for
his dismissal. The vote came Sunday
after a decision to cancel services to
avoid a confrontation with blacks
planning to attend the church.
Under church rules, only the church
congregation in a business meeting
can remove the pastor. Edwards said.
A week's notice must be given before
such a meeting and "as far as 1 know,
no such notice has been given."
However. Edwards added, "1 believe
my ministry here is about to close and
I'll be leaving."
The 33-year-old pastor, who served
the Plains Baptist Church for the past
two years, did not rule out the possibil
ity of staying.
'Strong support'
"A sizeable group of people in this
church are supporting me very
strongly," he said. "1 would hope to
continue to minister to them, and to
the whole church if there is an oppor
tunity."
Edwards, interviewed at his home,
said he and Carter agree that it is
wrong that the church is segregated.
"We have discussed it," Edwards
said. "We expressed our views but
didn't discuss any possible action" in
response to a specific integration
move.
Won't quit
Carter, who was campaigning in the
West on Sunday, has repeatedly stated
his support for his pastor. He said ves
terday be would trv to resolve the situ

ation but would not quit I lie church.
The confrontation came when Clen
non King, pastor of a nondenomina
tional mission in Albany, Ga., 30 miles
away, posted a notice on the Baptist
parsonage door announcing that he
would seek membership in the church.
King, who has run for local, state and
federal offices, said he was challeng
ing a church rule against blacks wor
shipping at the church.
Quick reaction
Reaction to the incident was quick
with black Democrats flocking to Car
ter's defense yesterday while Pres
ident Gerald Ford's backers dis
patched a telegram to some 375 to 400
black ministers and field workers
questioning Carter's response.
The Carter supporters claimed the
church incident may have been politi
cally motivated but would have either
no impact on today's vote or would
actually help the Democratic presiden
tial candidate.
The Ford group's telegram re
counted the incident and questioned:
"If the former Georgia governor and
life-long member of the Plains Baptist
Church cannot influence the decisions
and opinions of his own church can we
expect him to influence the issues and
opinions of the United States Con
gress?"
Telegram sent
The telegram was signed "President
Ford Committee, Washington, D.C."
but at the committee's offices Martin
Dinkins, national director of the black
desk at the People for Ford Committee,
said that that body had sent the tele
gram.
Dinkins said he assumed the tele
gram had received higher clearance
but he did not know by whom.
Dinkins said it was sent yesterday
afternoon "after we received numer
ous queries as to whether this was a
true incident — queries from ministers
who support Ford and from our field
workers." He said the telegrams were
sent only to blacks.
Yesterday morning. Carter called a
news conference in Sacramento on a
few minutes' notice to say he disag
reed with the deacons' action but
would not resign from the church. He
said the incident may have been "par
tially at least politically motivated,"
noting that king is not from Plains, not
a Baptist and has run for public office
as a Republican.
Mondale appears
Carter's running mate, Walter Mon
dale. appeared in Gary, Ind., with that
city's black Democratic Mayor Richard
Hatcher to defend Carter and cast sus
picion on the incident.

"Black people all across the United
States art; too smart, too sophisticated"
to be influenced by the incident,
Hatcher said. Polls show that Carter's
chances in a number of large, northern
states could depend on how many
black voters turn out to support him.
Asked if the incident would have an
impact on today's vote, Mondale said.
"I think it may be in the opposition
direction . . . There's something very
suspicious about a last-minute trick

like this, to try to escalate an issue
when there's not time to explain it."
Meanwhile, on Carter's campaign
plane, Coretta Scott King, widow
of Martin Luther King jr.. said, "We
think that the raising of this issue at
this time has been instigated and is
consistent with the low level on which
the campaign against Gov. Carter has
been run." The Albany minister is not
related to the King family of civil
rights fame.

patched a telegram to some 375 to 400
black ministers and field workers
questioning Carter's response.
The Carter supporters claimed the
church incident may have been politi
cally motivated but would have either
no impact on today's vote or would
actually help the Democratic presiden
tial candidate.
The Ford group's telegram re
counted the incident and questioned:
"If the former Georgia governor and
life-long member of the Plains Baptist
Church cannot influence the decisions
and opinions of his own church can we
expect him to influence the issues and
opinions of the United States Con
gress?"
Telegram sent
The telegram was signed "President
Ford Committee, Washington, D.C."
but at the committee's offices Martin
Dinkins, national director of the black
desk at the People for Ford Committee,
said that that body had sent the tele
gram.
Dinkins said he assumed the tele
gram had received higher clearance
but he did not know by whom.
Dinkins said it was sent yesterday
afternoon "after we received numer
ous queries as to whether this was a
true incident — queries from ministers
who support Ford and from our field
workers." He said the telegrams were
sent only to blacks.
Yesterday morning. Carter called a
news conference in Sacramento on a
few minutes' notice to say he disag
reed with the deacons' action but
would not resign from the church. He
said the incident may have been "par
tially at least politically motivated,"
noting that king is not from Plains, not
a Baptist and has run for public office
as a Republican.
Mondale appears
Carter's running mate, Walter Mon
dale. appeared in Gary, Ind., with that
city's black Democratic Mayor Richard
Hatcher to defend Carter and cast sus
picion on the incident.

"Black people all across the United
States art; too smart, too sophisticated"
to be influenced by the incident,
Hatcher said. Polls show that Carter's
chances in a number of large, northern
states could depend on how many
black voters turn out to support him.
Asked if the incident would have an
impact on today's vote, Mondale said.
"I think it may be in the opposition
direction . . . There's something very
suspicious about a last-minute trick

like this, to try to escalate an issue
when there's not time to explain it."
Meanwhile, on Carter's campaign
plane, Coretta Scott King, widow
of Martin Luther King jr.. said, "We
think that the raising of this issue at
this time has been instigated and is
consistent with the low level on which
the campaign against Gov. Carter has
been run." The Albany minister is not
related to the King family of civil
rights fame.
Plains, Ga. (AP) — Jimmy Carter's
pastor plans to 112 ight a move to dismiss
him because he favors racial integra
tion, but he says he may be leaving the
Plains Baptist Church anyway.
"My plans are to carry it to the
church." Bruce Edwards said yester
day of a church deacons' secret vote for
his dismissal. The vote came Sunday
after a decision to cancel services to
avoid a confrontation with blacks
planning to attend the church.
Under church rules, only the church
congregation in a business meeting
can remove the pastor. Edwards said.
A week's notice must be given before
such a meeting and "as far as 1 know,
no such notice has been given."
However. Edwards added, "1 believe
my ministry here is about to close and
I'll be leaving."
The 33-year-old pastor, who served
the Plains Baptist Church for the past
two years, did not rule out the possibil
ity of staying.
'Strong support'
"A sizeable group of people in this
church are supporting me very
strongly," he said. "1 would hope to
continue to minister to them, and to
the whole church if there is an oppor
tunity."
Edwards, interviewed at his home,
said he and Carter agree that it is
wrong that the church is segregated.
"We have discussed it," Edwards
said. "We expressed our views but
didn't discuss any possible action" in
response to a specific integration
move.
Won't quit
Carter, who was campaigning in the
West on Sunday, has repeatedly stated
his support for his pastor. He said ves
terday be would trv to resolve the situ

ation but would not quit I lie church.
The confrontation came when Clen
non King, pastor of a nondenomina
tional mission in Albany, Ga., 30 miles
away, posted a notice on the Baptist
parsonage door announcing that he
would seek membership in the church.
King, who has run for local, state and
federal offices, said he was challeng
ing a church rule against blacks wor
shipping at the church.

like this, to try to escalate an issue
when there's not time to explain it."
Meanwhile, on Carter's campaign
plane, Coretta Scott King, widow
of Martin Luther King jr.. said, "We
think that the raising of this issue at

Plains, Ga. (AP) — Jimmy Carter's
pastor plans to 112 ight a move to dismiss
him because he favors racial integra
tion, but he says he may be leaving the
Plains Baptist Church anyway.
"My plans are to carry it to the
church." Bruce Edwards said yester
day of a church deacons' secret vote for
his dismissal. The vote came Sunday
after a decision to cancel services to
avoid a confrontation with blacks
planning to attend the church.
Under church rules, only the church
congregation in a business meeting
can remove the pastor. Edwards said.
A week's notice must be given before
such a meeting and "as far as 1 know,
no such notice has been given."
However. Edwards added, "1 believe
my ministry here is about to close and
I'll be leaving."
The 33-year-old pastor, who served
the Plains Baptist Church for the past
two years, did not rule out the possibil
ity of staying.
'Strong support'
"A sizeable group of people in this
church are supporting me very
strongly," he said. "1 would hope to
continue to minister to them, and to
the whole church if there is an oppor
tunity."
Edwards, interviewed at his home,
said he and Carter agree that it is
wrong that the church is segregated.
"We have discussed it," Edwards
said. "We expressed our views but
didn't discuss any possible action" in
response to a specific integration
move.
Won't quit
Carter, who was campaigning in the
West on Sunday, has repeatedly stated
his support for his pastor. He said ves
terday be would trv to resolve the situ

ation but would not quit I lie church.
The confrontation came when Clen
non King, pastor of a nondenomina
tional mission in Albany, Ga., 30 miles
away, posted a notice on the Baptist
parsonage door announcing that he
would seek membership in the church.
King, who has run for local, state and
federal offices, said he was challeng
ing a church rule against blacks wor
shipping at the church.
Quick reaction
Reaction to the incident was quick
with black Democrats flocking to Car
ter's defense yesterday while Pres
ident Gerald Ford's backers dis
patched a telegram to some 375 to 400
black ministers and field workers
questioning Carter's response.
The Carter supporters claimed the
church incident may have been politi
cally motivated but would have either
no impact on today's vote or would
actually help the Democratic presiden
tial candidate.
The Ford group's telegram re
counted the incident and questioned:
"If the former Georgia governor and
life-long member of the Plains Baptist
Church cannot influence the decisions
and opinions of his own church can we
expect him to influence the issues and
opinions of the United States Con
gress?"
Telegram sent
The telegram was signed "President
Ford Committee, Washington, D.C."
but at the committee's offices Martin
Dinkins, national director of the black
desk at the People for Ford Committee,
said that that body had sent the tele
gram.
Dinkins said he assumed the tele
gram had received higher clearance
but he did not know by whom.
Dinkins said it was sent yesterday
afternoon "after we received numer
ous queries as to whether this was a
true incident — queries from ministers
who support Ford and from our field
workers." He said the telegrams were
sent only to blacks.
Yesterday morning. Carter called a
news conference in Sacramento on a
few minutes' notice to say he disag
reed with the deacons' action but
would not resign from the church. He
said the incident may have been "par
tially at least politically motivated,"
noting that king is not from Plains, not
a Baptist and has run for public office
as a Republican.
Mondale appears
Carter's running mate, Walter Mon
dale. appeared in Gary, Ind., with that
city's black Democratic Mayor Richard
Hatcher to defend Carter and cast sus
picion on the incident.

"Black people all across the United
States art; too smart, too sophisticated"
to be influenced by the incident,
Hatcher said. Polls show that Carter's
chances in a number of large, northern
states could depend on how many
black voters turn out to support him.
Asked if the incident would have an
impact on today's vote, Mondale said.
"I think it may be in the opposition
direction . . . There's something very
suspicious about a last-minute trick

like this, to try to escalate an issue
when there's not time to explain it."
Meanwhile, on Carter's campaign
plane, Coretta Scott King, widow
