# Oppose approval of B1 bomber

Within the next few months, Con
gress will make a final decision on
whether or not the United States will
finance a fleet of 244 Bl supersonic
bombers. It is important to all of us that
money is not appropriated for this.
The Pentagon claims that these
planes are needed for national defense,
to replace our 852 bombers. Another
argument for the jets is that too many
jobs are dependent upon this project to
cut off funds for it. These are the only
two real arguments for the plan, and
both are weak.
First of all. the Bl is not needed for
our defense. The United States is still
clearly number one in military
strength. By 1980. without the 81. the
United States will have over 12,000
nuclear weapons on nuclear-powered
submarines, land-based missiles and
long-range bombers. It is utterly im
possible that anybody could survive a
war with us. If just one sub remained
unintercepted, its 160 warheads
woidd destroy any nation on earth.
As far as air strength goes, there is no
need to replace the 852. We have 425
of these jets, and they are constantly
being modernized and improved.
They can penetrate any country's de
fenses. including the Soviet Union's,
as effectively as the Bis could. We also
have other modern jets in our Air
Force, which are capable of delivering
over 220,000 Hiroshima equivalents.
Our Intercontinental Ballistic Mis
siles (ICBM) and Submarine-
Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBM).
are capable of another 369,000
Hiroshima equivalents. These
capabilities will increase dramatically
over the next few years, with or with
out the Bis. Our existing jets will re
main effective and operative until at
least 1990.
Bomber force
Meanwhile, the Soviet bomber force
consists of only 160 planes. 100 of
which are propeller-driven, and very
few of which are a threat to our sec
urity. The importance of the bomber to
any nation's defenses has steadily de
clined. Then why should we spend so
much money on a plan to build a new
fleet of bombers? â€¢
Secondly, the cost of building and
maintaining this fleet of 244 bombers
over a 30 year period would be about
,92 billion dollars. It is ridiculous to
believe that the jobs created by such a
project would be a worthwhile in
vestment. For every $1 billion spent on
defense. 22.000 jobs are created. How
ever. $1 billion spent in other areas
would employ: 34.000 people if spent

on durable goods production, 36,000
people if spent on housing construc
tion. 46,000 people if spent on health,
welfare and sanitation, and 52,000
people if spent on education.
Clearly, more jobs would be lost by
building these jets than would be
gained if the money was spent on other
projects. Also, 48 states would have
people that worked on the 81, and 43
of these states would give the govern
ment more money in taxes for the Bl
than they would gain in defense con
tracts. For example, the state of New
York would get $18 million in con
tracts, but the people of New York
would pay over $100 million in taxes
that would be used for the 81.
Obviously, neither argument for the
project is a good one. However, there
are many good arguments against the
81. First of all, it would further esca
late the arms race. Secondly, these
planes would hurt the environment;
they create sonic booms, and are con
siderably louder than the Concorde,
which has been banned in most of the
United States. Thirdly, the $92 billion
could be spent more wisely. As already
stated, more jobs could be made avail
able to Americans.
Health care possible
For one quarter of the cost of the 81,
health care could be provided for every
American who needed it. For the cost
of the Bl project, low cost housing
could be built for six million American
families. Asa matter of fact, the money
that would be used for the Bl could
instead be used to put every American
student through college for the next
100 years!
Then why has this project been al
lowed to proceed as far as it has? One
reason is that three very powerful cor
porations. Rockwell International.
General Electric and Boeing, have a
vested interest in this. Executives from
these companies have been involved
in the Nixon and Ford administra
tions, and have lobbied for the 81.
General Electric can expect over $12
billion in sales if these planes are built.
Also, the Pentagon has had a great say
in how a lot of our money has been
spent over the last three decades. Since
World War 11, we've spent $1.3 trillion
on defense. That's a bit too much of a
say if you ask me.
Needless to say. much of that money
could probably have been used other
wise. to make the quality of life better
for many Americans, including us.

sound to you?)
