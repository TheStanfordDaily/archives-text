a.m. today that President Gerald Ford
narrowly defeated President-elect
Jimmy Carter in California.

solid lead in the South, eked out vic
tories in New York and Pennsylvania
to win the presidency last night, end
ing eight years of Republican rule.
Carter held a steady three per cent
lead in the popular vote over President
Gerald Ford throughout the night. The
contest was not decided here until 1:30
a.m., with races being decided by less
than one per cent in Illinois, Ohio.
Maine and lowa.
Wisconsin and Mississippi put Car
ter past the majority with 272 electoral
votes.
Carter upset Ford in California, but
by the time the state's results had been
tabulated, the man from Plains. Ca.,
had already clinched the election.
Carter was leading by less than
100.000 votes with about 90 per cent of
California's precincts reporting. Voter
turnout in California was heavy and a
coalition of blacks, supporters of Prop.
14 and liberals managed to offset a
large conservative vote brought out by
senate Republican candidate S.I.
Hayakawa.
As late as Saturday, at least one poll
predicted Ford would carry California
by as much as six per cent.
In the popular vote, with 90 per cent
of the nation reporting. Carter was
leading Ford 36,859.904 to
34,905,294.
Carter addressed a victory rally in
Atlanta before returning home early in
the morning to Plains.
He told supporters that "this tre
mendous crowd at four in the morning
represents hundreds of millions of
people ready to see national unity."
Carter, humble in victory, described
Ford as the "toughest" opponent
"anyone could have."
Telling the crowd, "I pray I can live
up to your confidence," Carter reaf
firmed many of the pledges he made
during the campaign. He said he was
going to use the period before he takes
office to familiarize himself with the
processes of the White House.
Before the speech, Carter said he had
already gone over about 75 names for
Cabinet and other high-level administ
ration posts. He also said he would
open a Washington office after a weeks
rest.
Carter said he would spend three or
four days a week there.
"The logistics of trying to do it out of
Plains." he said, "are just too great."
Ford, who was nursing a bad case ot
larvngitis. went to bed about 3:30 a.m.

(EST). He did not concede defeat.
Aides said he would have a statement
on the election tomorrow.
Start in the South
Carter, who began an unheralded
campaign 22 months ago without any
visible political support, will become
39th president of the United States Jan.
20. 1977.
He is the first man from the Deep
South to be elected president since
Zachary Taylor in 1848.
Ford, meanwhile, will go down in
history as the country's only ap
pointed head of state. He is also the
first incumbent to lose since Herbert
Hoover in 1932. In the past weeks.
Ford had narrowed a seemingly in
surmountable Carter lead, but his ina
bility to crack the Ceorgian's solid
southern vote and his losses in the
northeastern industrial states of New
Yorkand Pennsylvania sealed his fate.
Carter picked up 118 electoral votes
in the South, losing only Virginia to
Ford.
The former Ceorgia governor ap
peared headed for some trouble in that
region earlier in the evening. He car
ried only 52 per cent of the vote in
Kentucky, a key border state which is
usually a bellweather for other south
ern states.
Louisiana a surprise
But Carter scored impressive wins in
Louisiana, a state Ford had been ex
pected to carry because of its large
Catholic population, and South
Carolina. Healso won in Texas in spite
of a heavy turnout for Ford around
Houston.
Pennsylvania, with 27 electoral
votes, and New York, with 41, put Car
ter on the threshold of the White
House. He had been expected to carry
both states, but Ford ran surprisingly
strong in New York.
When it appeared Ford had a chance
to win in New York. Republicans de
clared they would go to court seeking
impoundment of voting machines fora
recount.

Gerald Ford throughout the night and was declared the winner by the
television networks around 1 a.m. today.
A spokesman for the White House
said the decision to go to court was
approved by Ford.
Carter also captured other Democra
tic strongholds on the east coast in
cluding Rhode Island and Mas
sachusetts. He won in Minnesota, the
home of Carter's running mate Sen.
Walter Mondale.
Ford countered Carter's strong
showing in the South by winning the
plains and intermountain states.
The president won by a large plural
ity in Indiana, riding to victory on the
coattails of successful Republican se
nate candidate Richard Lugar. He also
picked up Oklahoma, a state which
was expected to go to Carter.
Ford ran up a string of victories in
the Rocky Mountain states including
Colorado, Montana and Idaho.
Ford was helped in two states bv the
presence of independent presidential
candidate Eugene McCarthy's name
on the ballot. McCarthy, who drew one
per cent of the vote in Illinois, pre
vented Carter from pulling into a vir
tual dead heat with the president.
In lowa, where McCarthy got his
highest total, the former Minnesota
senator won four per cent of the vote
allowing Ford to win.
