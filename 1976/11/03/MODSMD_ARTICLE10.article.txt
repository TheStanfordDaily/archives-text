Jimmy Carter was drinking water in Virginia
16 months ago. Come January 20, 1977,
the former Georgia governor can enjoy
a mint julep in the White House

Jimmy Carter was elected 39th president of the United States
of America yesterday by a razor thin margin. Few races in the
nation's history have been closer than his contest with incum
bent President Gerald Ford.
For Carter, it was the culmination ot a campaign that has seen
him rise from the "other" catagory of the Harris and Gallup polls
to the White House.
There have been calmer moments in Carter's march to the
presidency.
On an early campaign swing through the Tidewater region of
Virginia, Carter was in what Hunter Thompson, political writer
for Rolling Stone, would call stage one in his quest tor the White
House.

The former Georgia governoi was more accessible than he
would be at any other time during the campaign.
There were no secret service men and, as far as the national
media were concerned, the only southern politico of note was
George Corley Wallace, governor of Alabama. So they we not
around either.
It was still seven months before Carter reached stage two — the
New Hampshire primary election — and another 15 months
before he was elected president.
Things were a lot less hectic at that point in the campaign — at
least for the people who were aware Carter was running for
office.
His plane suffered mechanical problems coming in from At
lanta. so reporters lolled about and sipped lemonade on the
veranda of a Norfolk home.
When he did arrive, Carter spoke to a good-sized crowd. And the
catch phrases which would characterize and identify his cam
paign during the months ("I would never tell a lie. I would never
tell you a misleading statement. Watch me closely. If you ever
hear me doing any of these things then I don't deserve to be your
president.") rolled from his veranda podium over the audience.
The only place he did not win converts was among the state's
Democratic political leadership. Carter took one of them to task
for supporting a rival candidate — a tipoff that the Georgian was
perfectly capable of playing hard ball.
"I didn't come here to be embarrassed," said Joe Fitzpatrick,
the leader in question. "If somebody asked me, I'll go down to
Georgia and campaign against Carter. When he gets to the con
vention and looks at the Virginia delegate total and sees zero tor
Carter, he'll remember the name of joe Fitzpatrick."
Apparently, Carter did remember. When the Democratic con
vention rolled around, there was Fitzpatrick delivering the
maioritv of the Virginia delegation to him.



Cup of water in hand, Carter faces the press in Norfolk, Va., Aug. 2, 1975. The
characteristic smile, a feature of the Carter campaign even before the New Hamp
shire primary, was very much in evidence that day.

from state officials and political figures.

The former Georgia governoi was more accessible than he
would be at any other time during the campaign.
There were no secret service men and, as far as the national
media were concerned, the only southern politico of note was
George Corley Wallace, governor of Alabama. So they we not
around either.
It was still seven months before Carter reached stage two — the
New Hampshire primary election — and another 15 months
before he was elected president.
Things were a lot less hectic at that point in the campaign — at
least for the people who were aware Carter was running for
office.
His plane suffered mechanical problems coming in from At
lanta. so reporters lolled about and sipped lemonade on the
veranda of a Norfolk home.
When he did arrive, Carter spoke to a good-sized crowd. And the
catch phrases which would characterize and identify his cam
paign during the months ("I would never tell a lie. I would never
tell you a misleading statement. Watch me closely. If you ever
hear me doing any of these things then I don't deserve to be your
president.") rolled from his veranda podium over the audience.
The only place he did not win converts was among the state's
Democratic political leadership. Carter took one of them to task
for supporting a rival candidate — a tipoff that the Georgian was
perfectly capable of playing hard ball.
"I didn't come here to be embarrassed," said Joe Fitzpatrick,
the leader in question. "If somebody asked me, I'll go down to
Georgia and campaign against Carter. When he gets to the con
vention and looks at the Virginia delegate total and sees zero tor
Carter, he'll remember the name of joe Fitzpatrick."
Apparently, Carter did remember. When the Democratic con
vention rolled around, there was Fitzpatrick delivering the
maioritv of the Virginia delegation to him.



Cup of water in hand, Carter faces the press in Norfolk, Va., Aug. 2, 1975. The
characteristic smile, a feature of the Carter campaign even before the New Hamp
shire primary, was very much in evidence that day.


Carter was not looking for devine guidance in Virginia, he was looking for support
from state officials and political figures.
Jimmy Carter was drinking water in Virginia
16 months ago. Come January 20, 1977,
the former Georgia governor can enjoy
a mint julep in the White House

Jimmy Carter was elected 39th president of the United States
of America yesterday by a razor thin margin. Few races in the
nation's history have been closer than his contest with incum
bent President Gerald Ford.
For Carter, it was the culmination ot a campaign that has seen
him rise from the "other" catagory of the Harris and Gallup polls
to the White House.
There have been calmer moments in Carter's march to the
presidency.
On an early campaign swing through the Tidewater region of
Virginia, Carter was in what Hunter Thompson, political writer
for Rolling Stone, would call stage one in his quest tor the White
House.
