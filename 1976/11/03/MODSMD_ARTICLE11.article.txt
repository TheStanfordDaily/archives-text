# 'Bad' teaching
## 
### 
Behn, et. al.

By now, most of the Stanford com
munity is a ware that there are signific
ant unanswered questions about the
failure of the Economics Department
to reach a tenure decision on Duncan
Foley. The question examined here is
the extent to which Foley's
widely acknowledged teaching excel
lence influenced the faculty decision
to defer a tenure recommendation.
Past tenure decisions provide ample
evidence to support the view that
teaching and research are not treated
symmetrically as university
guidelines prescribe. When con
troversy arises it appears faculty fail to
return to first principles and instead
narrow the range of factors considered
in the decision. The issues involved,
however, are far more complex than
the apparent insignificant weight at
tached to teaching performance. We
contend that Foley's outstanding
teaching record was actually weighted
negatively, if unconsciously so, by
many faculty.
This possibility has been ignored in
campus discussion of the problems of
Weighing teaching performance in te
nure decisions. Simply stated, the
problem is as follows. If a facuMty
member is an outstanding teacher in a
field which other colleagues believe
warrants limited study, or if thefaculty
member is an outstanding teacher in a
field perceived as central to the discip
line but seriously addresses non
traditional analytic methods (e.g.,
Marxian methodology), good teaching
is discounted in a tenure decision.
While good teaching as "bad" teach
ing is not as widely discussed
phenomenon, it is not just the subject
of idle speculation.
High student interest
One argument raised two years ago
in the Economics Department in op
position to the permanent appointing
of visiting Prof. Donald Harris, a Mar
xist scholar, was that his excellence as
.1 teacher attracted students to study in
his, area of instruction. Some
economics faculty took high student
interest in Harris' courses as: (1) a sig
nal of student inability Â«to select
courses important to their education,
and (2) a demonstration of the danger
of good teaching directing student in
terest away from the areas of investiga
tion other faculty preferred students
.address.
Harris was described as too
charismatic, a pied piper leading stu
dents astray from neo-classical
economics. In brief. Harris taught
*'had" courses too well. (Not long ago
another university of high reputation
Actually sought to appoint an ineffec
tive teacher to discourage growing
student interest in Marxian
economics.)
Students will quickly recognize the
parallel between the absence of faculty
confidence in student ability to select
,iin academic program which fits their
needs, and a lack of confidence in stu
dent ability to evaluate teaching.
Alternative perspectives
Comments of some faculty suggest
Foley's teaching has also drawn
close scrutiny because of its effective
ness. While he has taught courses trad
itionally offered at Stanford, he has in
troduced alternative perspectives to
neo-classical analysis to encourage

critical study of the course material. In
other words, he has taught "good"
courses "badly" from a faculty view
point.
Students see the situation diffe
rently, praising Foley for his em
phasis on the development of analytic
skills, and invitation of questions in
class discussion from different analy
tic perspectives.
When tenure review procedures are
assessed we must consider the sys
tem's ability to correct bad decisions,
not simply make good decisions in the
first instance. The tenure review pro
cess in the School of Humanities and
Sciences provides a means to reverse
had positive tenure recommendations
from individual departments (e.g., re
commendations that don't reflect care
ful comparative evaluation of the can
didates qualifications). But there are
no procedures to correct a bad negative
recommendation, the situation where
political discrimination against an in
dividual is most likely to occur.
The likelihood of a bad negative de
cision by the Economics Department
in the case of Foley is supported
by the departments failure to encour
age academic freedom in course in
struction. The department has persis
tently failed to support the introduc
tion of different analyticapproaches in
classes, despite the fact that in early
1974, faculty claimed this responsibil
ity for themselves when over 250 stu
dents requested new faculty be hired
who would be able to introduce Mar
xian perspectives.
Discuss and defend
Foliowi ng a detailed student survey
in the same year, a Committee on IJn
dergradute Economics Curriculum re
commended that faculty introduce
non-neoclassical perspectives in their
courses as well as discuss and defend
the perspective they chose to em
phasize. The economics faculty failed
to publicly affirm the committee's
recommendation, or actively encour
age faculty to implement it in practice.
Nor did it address thereport'simplica
tions for changes in faculty composi
tion.
So even though student protesta
tions on the absence of alternative
perspectives lay behind initiation of
t he curriculum review, little was done
to improve undergraduate education
either by changing instructional pat
terns of existing faculty or by new fa
culty appointments. This is consistent
with the absence, spanning several
years, of collective faculty leadership
on measures which would encourage
academic freedom in the department.
Since faculty have already deter
mined what economic system they
prefer and what methods of analysis
they find useful to employ, they
choose to restrict student study to
areas which confirm the importance of
their own work and value judgments.
The essence of academic freedom is
tret; competition of ideas. The
economics department should en
courage good teaching of all subjects
.iihl systematic critique of economic
theories. Cood teaching must be re
warded. not penalized in tenure deci
sions.
