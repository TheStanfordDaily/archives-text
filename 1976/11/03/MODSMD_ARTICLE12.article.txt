It seems that the Guaranteed Hous
ing Plan. the berrelits of which are
applicable to <i 11 hut this year's seniors,
has woiked beyond all expectation.
Indeed, were a guaranteed student to
have received an assignment to a
house other than his or her first choice
in last spring's Housing Draw, it was
possible to attain fulfillment of that
lirst choice by placing his or lier name
on the waiting list over the summer.
Let me illustrate to the point: a
guaranteed male assigned to Toyon in
last spring's draw was. by Sept. 5.
reassigned to Lambda Nu. after having
sought to alter his previous assign
ment on the waiting list.
This move was achieved through the
opening up of a male spot in Lambda
Nu over the summer. The move was
made by "leapfrogging" past at lensf
five previously unassigned senior
males, all of whom possessed present
residence priority in Lambda Nu.
This also despite the fact that they
too were on the summer waiting list
and had listed Lambda Nu their first
choice.
Virtually impossible
For seniors not covered by the plan,
assignment during this past summer
from the waiting list was virtually
impossible, according to a I lousing Of
fice explanation After all transfer stu
dents were assigned this summer,
further openings were filled first from
a "pool" of guaranteed students drawn
from the waiting list applicants, appa
rently even when they had been previ
ously assigned.
Since the housing office boasted ol
having placed all guaranteed students
within the system last May. one might
assume that, aside from transfer stu
dents, the pool contained only guaran
teed students wishing to alter their
previous assignment.
Only once this pool was depleted
were other unassigned non
guaranteed students also on the wait
ing list tapped for openings. Whether

or not they possessed present resi
dence priority in a house listed as their
first choice and where an opening had
occured made no difference. In fact,
these latter students on the waiting list
were not even considered until the
September round of assignments.
Possibly justified
The waiting list selections thus
worked to place guaranteed students
into the system before non-guaranteed
students, who happened to matricu
late a year before the new scheme went
into effect — a possibly justified exer
cise.
Hut furthermore, the' waiting list
selections also worked to give at least
one student already assigned to a spot
within the housing system a second,
presumably more desirable assign
ment. This second selection occured
before unassigned students were even
considered for assignment from the
waiting lists, though they possessed
present residence priority in a house
where openings did exist.
Conceivably they could have even
possessed loner draw numbers than a
reassigned student since not being co
vered by the guarantee restricted them
from the pool under consideration.
Perversely, an unassigned ex-Nudie
could hypothetically havebeen placed
in Toyon after the vacancy was created
bv <1 Toyon assignee whose "superior"
choice of Lambda Nu had in effect
been guaranteed.
This is not to criticize housing office
staffers, a harried but usually helpful
lot. nor to downgrade Toyon Hall,
which has many things to be proud of.
Rather, the example should de
monstrate the effect of a system struc
turally unfair — or alternatively the
effect of "judicious" aim through a
loophoh;. however inadvertent.
Names have been withheld to protect
the innocent (plural) and the lucky
(singular?).

have received an assignment to a
house other than his or her first choice
in last spring's Housing Draw, it was
possible to attain fulfillment of that
lirst choice by placing his or lier name
on the waiting list over the summer.
Let me illustrate to the point: a
guaranteed male assigned to Toyon in
last spring's draw was. by Sept. 5.
reassigned to Lambda Nu. after having
sought to alter his previous assign
ment on the waiting list.
This move was achieved through the
opening up of a male spot in Lambda
Nu over the summer. The move was
made by "leapfrogging" past at lensf
five previously unassigned senior
males, all of whom possessed present
residence priority in Lambda Nu.
This also despite the fact that they
too were on the summer waiting list
and had listed Lambda Nu their first
choice.
Virtually impossible
For seniors not covered by the plan,
assignment during this past summer
from the waiting list was virtually
impossible, according to a I lousing Of
fice explanation After all transfer stu
dents were assigned this summer,
further openings were filled first from
a "pool" of guaranteed students drawn
from the waiting list applicants, appa
rently even when they had been previ
ously assigned.
Since the housing office boasted ol
having placed all guaranteed students
within the system last May. one might
assume that, aside from transfer stu
dents, the pool contained only guaran
teed students wishing to alter their
previous assignment.
Only once this pool was depleted
were other unassigned non
guaranteed students also on the wait
ing list tapped for openings. Whether

or not they possessed present resi
dence priority in a house listed as their
first choice and where an opening had
occured made no difference. In fact,
these latter students on the waiting list
were not even considered until the
September round of assignments.
Possibly justified
The waiting list selections thus
worked to place guaranteed students
into the system before non-guaranteed
students, who happened to matricu
late a year before the new scheme went
into effect — a possibly justified exer
cise.
Hut furthermore, the' waiting list
selections also worked to give at least
one student already assigned to a spot
within the housing system a second,
presumably more desirable assign
ment. This second selection occured
before unassigned students were even
considered for assignment from the
waiting lists, though they possessed
present residence priority in a house
where openings did exist.
Conceivably they could have even
possessed loner draw numbers than a
reassigned student since not being co
vered by the guarantee restricted them
from the pool under consideration.
Perversely, an unassigned ex-Nudie
could hypothetically havebeen placed
in Toyon after the vacancy was created
bv <1 Toyon assignee whose "superior"
choice of Lambda Nu had in effect
been guaranteed.
This is not to criticize housing office
staffers, a harried but usually helpful
lot. nor to downgrade Toyon Hall,
which has many things to be proud of.
Rather, the example should de
monstrate the effect of a system struc
turally unfair — or alternatively the
effect of "judicious" aim through a
loophoh;. however inadvertent.
Names have been withheld to protect
the innocent (plural) and the lucky
(singular?).
