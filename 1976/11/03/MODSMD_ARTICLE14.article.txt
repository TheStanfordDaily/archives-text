# American public lost last night
## 
### 
At the time of this writing, the out
come of the presidential election is in
doubt. But even without the know
ledge of the vote totals, one thing is
certain: the American public is the
loser.
About theonly tiling tobe said about
the race this year is that it was a great
one for humor. Julian Bond called it a
race between "the lackluster and the
lusty." Political pundits cracked up at
the gaffes of the two candidates, ob

serving that the Polish are now telling
President Ford jokes and suggesting
that Jimmy Carter's slogan ought to be
"in his heart he knows your wife."
But tor anyone with a firm political
ideology, there is little humor this
morning. The two major parties chose
as their nominees the most fuzzy of the
candidates who sought nomination.
While this may be good strategy for
confusing the voters in the election,
the leadership that results is question

able.
Carter, it has been said, would come
out in favor of cancer if it would get
him elected.
He began by winning the lowa
caucus as the conservative alternative
to Wallace and now echoes Walter

Mondale's liberal views. Indeed, he
displays a hunger and desire for the
presidency paralleled in recent time
only by Richard Nixon.
Old-time partisan
Ford is an old-time partisan, a man
who would like to blame the Democra
tic Congress for all our ills without of
fering any solutions to them. If he was
elected president yesterday, it is a
great tribute to the power of partisan
rhetoric. Two men, Democrat Morris
Udall and Republican Ronald Reagan
would have been far better choices for
their parties and for the nation. Each
had an ideology which they did not
change with each new audience or
ethnic group. They were honest and
straightforward with the public in
challenging established ideas — as a
result, they lost.
Udall made it clear he was a "prog
ressive," a man who sought to apply a
New Deal program to the 19705. He
wanted to use the vast power of the
federal government to improve the
quality of life in America, to insure
jobs for all, give decent health care to
everyone, protect the consumer
through regulation, to clean up our
urban areas and correct the social in
justices he saw in America.
To pay for these proposals he advo
cated large cuts in the defense budget,
pointing to it as wasteful and excessive
and advocating a policy of non
intervention overseas.
Won respect
While all of these views may be ap
palling to those who see government
in a more limited role and the dangers
of isolationism, Udall won the respect
of all for his wit and candor on the
issues — a quality seriously lacking in
the man the Democratic party nomi
nated.

Although Reagan received nearly
500,000 more primary votes than
Gerald Ford, the CQP Convention
chose Ford because he happened to be
living in the White House at the time.
Had it been Congressman Jerry Ford in
the race against the former California
governor, Reagan might have been
elected president yesterday.
Like Udall on the left. Reagan made
no hesitation in letting the public
know where he stood. He saw the evil
in an ever-growing federal bureauc
racy in Washington which infringes
daily on the freedom of the people
whose rights it is supposed to protect.
He warned against the dangers of mas
sive deficit spending, of restricting our
system of free-enterprise with over
regulation and federal subsidies and in
further burdening the American tax
payer with federal spending programs.
On the defense issue, Reagan
warned that the Soviet Union is con
ducting the greatest arms build-up tlie
world has ever seen. He said peacie
could only be preserved in the world
with a strong American defensive
capability, but when Ford's Secretary
of Defense James Schlesinger
warned the same, Ford fired him.
Ford approach
Perhaps the best summation of the
Ford approach to foreign policy can be
seen in a campaign speech he made in
San Diego last week, attacking Democ
ratic proposals for defense spending
cuts because, "they might just, mean
closing defense plants throughout the
United States, including some right
here in the great state of California."
As the Wall Street Journal put it edito
rially, "faced with a mounting threat to
the security of the nation, the Presi
dent of the United States worries about
the pork barrel."
Lest the reader think otherwise, this
is not to commend those who
abstained from voting —quite the con
trary. Apathy and non-participation
produced the; man we saw elected yes
terday; he is a man without vision, a
man who is more concerned with par
tisan political rhetoric than he is with
the awesome challenges to peace and
freedom the United States will face in
the next four years. Today is a great
day for the hard-core partisans who
backed the winner — the status quo
has been safely preserved.
Hut for those who saw the vision and
shared the idealism of men like Mo
I Idall or Ronald Reagan.it is a sad day
indeed.
