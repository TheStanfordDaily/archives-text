Buy Menlo Park

We, the civic-minded under
graduates of Stanford University, have
been contemplating methods to re
solve the current conflict between the
university and Menlo Park concerning
the status of university property.
Our repeated attempts to buy Menlp
Park have been rebuffed. Under our
new proposal, all Stanford students
currently living off-campus will move
to Menlo Park, and elect a student
majority to the Menlo Park City Coun
cil, which would then vote to con
demn parcels of that city for university
use. Projections estimate that the uni
versity would then be able to purchase
the condemned acreage at approxi
mately one-fourth its actual value.
The chairman of the Menlo Park City
Council has indicated that the city will
fight such action in court.
If we are successful, the land could
be reclaimed for more socially useful
purposes. Our preliminary plan in
cludes appropriation of Menlo College
for conversion into an 18-hole golf
course with a pro shop and eating area,
as well as a solar and wind energy sta
tion,.hiking and horseback trails, and
tennis, handball, archery, and lawn
bowling facilities.
Of course, this would only be the
beginning. Think of the possibilities.
The conversion of Santa Cruz Ave. to
grazing land would make it more
economically feasible for the food ser
vice to serve real meat again. The Oasis
could be renamed Little Leland's Pub.
Finally, we could perhaps in the future
prevent such unfortunate occurences
as John Naber and theChowchilla kid
nappers.
We call on all responsible Stanford
students to take immediate action on
our proposal.

Beyond belief
In order to agree with the California
State Supreme Court's decision, and
confirmatory rehearing, in the Bakke
case, in which medical school minor
ity admissions programs were de
clared unconstitutional, you would
have to believe the following.
1. It is not general ly advantageous to
be white rather than black or brown in
our present society, and has not been
for a hundred years or more.
2. That on grounds other than race,
such as income, job securing and hold
ing, political power, family structure,
and disease propensity, whites and
blacks and browns, and of course
American Indians, are equal.
3. That there are no disadvantages
other than socio-economic ones to
being present day descendents of
those who were slaves a hundred years
ago.
4. That whites have had no advan
tage in this society in terms of ease of
entry into schools or social and athle
tic clubs, nor in appointments, promo
tions, or ease of obtaining credentials
of all kinds.
5. That our society has never before
gently connived to give restitutional
advantage for a decade or so to a re
cently deprived or injured group, such
as veterans or Hungarian freedom
fighters.

And then there is the awkward mat
ter of U.S. citizens who could not mus
ter the academic accomplishments to
gain entrance to one of more than 100
U.S. medical schools, and who were
fortunate enough to possess the family
financial support to attend such
foreign medical schools as Guadalaj
ara in Mexico or Bologna in Italy.
These institutions are expensive
even by U.S. standards, and provide
nothing in the way of scholarships or
job opportunities.

No closet skeletons
Unless something drastic forces a
change in my feelings, 1 will throw
myself into the political arena. I will
stand before this country as a presiden
tial candidate. What this country
wants is a candidate who can not be
hurt by investigations into his past. I
will start my campaign with a clean
slate.
1 admit that I did not send my
grandmother a birthday card last year.
Nor did I call her to console her on her
terminal illness. Flowers too, were
more than I could afford. She was dy
ing, and all I could think of was
"where would my care packages come
from next year." This is evil. I state for
the record that I will do as little this
year, if she is alive, whether elected or
not.
The rumor that 1 supported the bon
fire last year to sacramentally burn my
aunt is true. But what could he better?
My aunt had a sizable crowd to watch
her cremation, and the crowd had a
slightly larger fire. This could hardly
make me unfit for the presidency.
Nowhere in the constitution does it
state that a man can not be president
for burning relatives. No other person
has been kept from office for adding
fuel to the fire. I see no reason why I
should be the first victim of such a
bias.
I also admit that I am not the friend
of the typical college student. In his
present deplorable state the student
would be of more use del imbed, can
ned and sent to New Cuinea as poor
grade tuna. If elected I would suggest
legislation on this question. My first
campaign yell would be: "Dissipate
the student, send him canned rather
than educated."
So let any congressional committee
investigate my past, for these are the
worst parts of my record. I stand before
this country, reedy to serve, knowing
that I would be a safe man to elect. I
begin at total baseness, and promise to
be evil to the end.
