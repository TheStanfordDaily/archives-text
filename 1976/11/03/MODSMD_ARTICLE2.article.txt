Prop. 14, the United Farm Workers
(UFVV)-inspired initiative designed to
make permanent provisions of the
1975 Agricultural Labor Relations Act,
together with regulations including
the controversial "access rule," was
defeated by a 3 to 2 margin yesterday.
The initiative, the target of intense
criticism from growers, who said it
would create a farm labor system un
fairly weighted in favor of the UFW
and Teamsters unions, was proposed
when the Agricultural Labor Relations
Board (ALRB) ran out of money last
February and a coalition of conserva

blocked funds until July.
Critics charged that the "access

union organizers to talk to workers in
the field for three hours per day, viol

is presently a regulation of the ALRB,
and will remain in force unless it is
struck down in the courts or is resci

The initiative would also have re

employes to the ALRB for the unions'
use and would have made union de
certification more difficult.
The initiative had the support of
Gov. Edmund Brown. Jr. and
President-elect Jimmy Carter, but was
opposed by many legislators, includ

a sponsor of the 1975 act.
The legislators said the initiative
would have taken the power to amend
the act out of the legislature's hands
and made it impossible to remove
those provisions which proved to be
unworkable.
Supporters, however, said the legis
