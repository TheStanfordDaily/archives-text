# Voters reject Prop. 14

### Jack Vaughn 
Prop. 14, the United Farm Workers
(UFVV)-inspired initiative designed to
make permanent provisions of the
1975 Agricultural Labor Relations Act,
together with regulations including
the controversial "access rule," was
defeated by a 3 to 2 margin yesterday.
The initiative, the target of intense
criticism from growers, who said it
would create a farm labor system un
fairly weighted in favor of the UFW
and Teamsters unions, was proposed
when the Agricultural Labor Relations
Board (ALRB) ran out of money last
February and a coalition of conserva
tive and pro-grower legislators
blocked funds until July.
Critics charged that the "access
rule," which would have allowed
union organizers to talk to workers in
the field for three hours per day, viol
ates private property rights. That rule
is presently a regulation of the ALRB,
and will remain in force unless it is
struck down in the courts or is resci
nded by the ALRB.
The initiative would also have re
quired growers to supply lists of
employes to the ALRB for the unions'
use and would have made union de
certification more difficult.
The initiative had the support of
Gov. Edmund Brown. Jr. and
President-elect Jimmy Carter, but was
opposed by many legislators, includ
ing Assembly Speaker Leo McCarthy,
a sponsor of the 1975 act.
The legislators said the initiative
would have taken the power to amend
the act out of the legislature's hands
and made it impossible to remove
those provisions which proved to be
unworkable.
Supporters, however, said the legis
lature is too likely to he controlled by
grower lobbyists and predicted that,
without the initiative, funding for the
AI.RB will be imperiled every year.
Santa Clara County
San Mateo and Santa Clara County
voters also rejected the initiative by a 3
to 2 margin despite personal appear
ances by UI'VV leader Cesar Chavez
and.i strong campaign organization
here.
Brian Banmiller. northern California
coordinator of the "No on 14" cam
paign. called the proposition's defeat a
"repudiation of the naked power grab
of Cesar Chavez." He said the "public
has spoken" on the "access rule" and
proposed amending it to make it "fair
to both union officials and growers."
Cindy Carlson, a member of the
UFVV Support Committee on campus,
blamed the initiative's defeat on
"enormous advertising" and financial
support for the anti-Prop. 14 forces.
She predicted that UFW efforts in the
coming year will be directed toward
"supporting the board (ALRB)," en
suring funding for the ALRB and pro
tecting the "access rule."
Others fail
Several other controversial proposi
tions met similar fates. Prop. 13, an
initiative which would have legalized
betting on dog races in California, was
defeated by a 3 to 1 margin. The prop
osal would have set up a Dog Racing
Commission similar to the agency
supervising horseracing in the state,
and revenue received from the gambl
ing would have gone into social prog
rams.
The proposition, largely the result of
efforts by dog racing promoter George
Hardie. met criticism from opponents
of gambling as well as persons sus
picious of Hardie's motives in leading
the initiative drive. The proposition
also suffered from charges that Hardie
failed to report campaign contribu
tions properly.
Prop. 3, authorizing $25 million in
low interest loans for installing home
energy insulation or solar heating un
its and Prop. 5, allowing interest rates
on busi ness loans to exceed 10 per cent
under limited conditions, were de
feated, while Prop. 4. empowering the
legislature to require competitive bid
ding in University of California con
tracts, won.
