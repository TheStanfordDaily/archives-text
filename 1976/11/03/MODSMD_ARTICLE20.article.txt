## 'Trojans loaded with pro prospects' Chris tackles USC offense 
### Paul Bauman 
Stanford has several problems
to tackle in its game against USC
Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
Their names are Ricky Bell,
Charles White. Mosi Tatupu and
Dave Farmer.
This illustrious quartet com
prises the core of the Trojans'
running attack.
"The secret to the whole game
willbe tackling,"Cardinal coach
Jack Christiansen told a group of
northern California football
writers at his press breakfast yes
terday. "We have to be able to
stop their runners and force
them to do something they don't
want, like pass.
Evans improved
"The quarterback (Vince
Evans) is improved, but we still
feel like the thing you have to do
against SC is stop the running
game."
Last year, if you stopped Bell,
you stopped USC's offense.
None of their other runners were
major threats and their passing
was, quite frankly, pathetic. The
Trojans have patched up those
weaknesses this season well
enough to rank second in the na
tion in total offense (475.1 yards
a game) and scoring (37.6).
USC may have two of the best
three or four running backs in
the country. There's Bell and
there's his back-up, White. The
freshman tailback will come in
handy Saturday because Bell is
hurting from a hip pointer and
twisted ankle.
First-year Trojan coach John
Robinson says Bell will probably
start, but the injuries "make his
full-time status questionable.
Our big concern is that he has
missed almost two full weeks of
practice, and he's losing some of
his edge."
Good average
White led all SC rushers, in
cluding Bell, last week against
California, gaining 91 yards on
14 carries. His season average of
7.0 yards on 70 carries is almost
twice that of all Stanford run

ners.
When a writer mentioned that
White is gone for good if he
breaks through the line. Christ
iansen said, "That's why we
have a guy in the press box with
a shotgun."
Evans has completed 55 per
cent of his passes this year, quite
an improvement over his 31 per
cent mark of last season.
'Super athletes'
"We're playing a team that is
loaded with super athletes,"
Christiansen said. "They have
10 to 15 senior pro prospects.
They might have the first draft
choice in the country in Bell.
Their pro prospects are spread
all over the team—in the offen
sive and defensive lines, the sec
ondary and at linebacker. They
have size at every position, plus
the speed to go with it."
Stanford does not have such
personnel. To win, Christiansen
said the Cards will have to de
pend "to a large degree on emo
tion.
"If we play the first three quar
ters the way we did against
UCLA and the fourth like we did
against Oregon State, it might be
a helluva ballgame. The players
are going to have to play their
hearts out for four quarters."
Christiansen was asked about
Stanford's Rose Bowl chances.
"Pretty slim, but not out of
sight," he said. "It might take a
miracle, but we definitely can't
go unless we win this one. It's a
long-shot possibility. I'd gamble
on our chances. I really believe
we have a chance and I think
most of our players do too."
'Risen to occasion'
Receiver Tony Hill, the proud
owner of two new Stanford
career records, is one of those
players.
"We've risen to the occasion
so far," Hill said. "In our last
three games, there were situa
tions where we needed to move
the ball and we moved the ball."
Hill conceded, though, that
Stanford hasn't looked anything

like a Rose Bowl-quality team so
far this year.
'Potential'
"We have far too much talent
to have scored as few points as
we have and our defense is far
too good to have allowed as
many points as it has. I feel that
we have extremely good person
nel, but we haven't played to our
full potential. In order to be a
Rose Bowl team, you have to
play good all the time and we
haven't been doing that."
Stanford is in fairly good
shape health-wise for the game.

Several players have miitf>r
pains, but only reserve defensive
tackle Steve Howe is listed ;*is
questionable for USC. Howe lyis
a pulled hamstring muscle. J
Middle linebacker tkiriv
Ceresino should start after sit
ting out last week's Oregon Stjjte
game with a slight concussion.
Cardinal notes: Guy Benjamin
is now ranked No. 2 in the coiyi
try in passing and total of
fense...The 6-foot-3, 201-pound
junior is averaging 21.3 compac
tions and 256.3 yards in total €>f
fense per game.

Player of Week
Stanford defensive tackle Duncan McColl, shown registering one of his two quarterback sacks
in Stanford's 24-3 victory over Oregon State last Saturday, has been named Pac-8 defensive
Player of the Week. McColl registered 15 tackles against the Beavers. He also knocked down a
pass at the line of scrimmage, caused two fumbles and recovered two fumbles.
Stanford has several problems
to tackle in its game against USC
Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
Their names are Ricky Bell,
Charles White. Mosi Tatupu and
Dave Farmer.
This illustrious quartet com
prises the core of the Trojans'
running attack.
"The secret to the whole game
willbe tackling,"Cardinal coach
Jack Christiansen told a group of
northern California football
writers at his press breakfast yes
terday. "We have to be able to
stop their runners and force
them to do something they don't
want, like pass.
Evans improved
"The quarterback (Vince
Evans) is improved, but we still
feel like the thing you have to do
against SC is stop the running
game."
Last year, if you stopped Bell,
you stopped USC's offense.
None of their other runners were
major threats and their passing
was, quite frankly, pathetic. The
Trojans have patched up those
weaknesses this season well
enough to rank second in the na
tion in total offense (475.1 yards
a game) and scoring (37.6).
USC may have two of the best
three or four running backs in
the country. There's Bell and
there's his back-up, White. The
freshman tailback will come in
handy Saturday because Bell is
hurting from a hip pointer and
twisted ankle.
First-year Trojan coach John
Robinson says Bell will probably
start, but the injuries "make his
full-time status questionable.
Our big concern is that he has
missed almost two full weeks of
practice, and he's losing some of
his edge."
Good average
White led all SC rushers, in
cluding Bell, last week against
California, gaining 91 yards on
14 carries. His season average of
7.0 yards on 70 carries is almost
twice that of all Stanford run

ners.
When a writer mentioned that
White is gone for good if he
breaks through the line. Christ
iansen said, "That's why we
have a guy in the press box with
a shotgun."
Evans has completed 55 per
cent of his passes this year, quite
an improvement over his 31 per
cent mark of last season.
'Super athletes'
"We're playing a team that is
loaded with super athletes,"
Christiansen said. "They have
10 to 15 senior pro prospects.
They might have the first draft
choice in the country in Bell.
Their pro prospects are spread
all over the team—in the offen
sive and defensive lines, the sec
ondary and at linebacker. They
have size at every position, plus
the speed to go with it."
Stanford does not have such
personnel. To win, Christiansen
said the Cards will have to de
pend "to a large degree on emo
tion.
"If we play the first three quar
ters the way we did against
UCLA and the fourth like we did
against Oregon State, it might be
a helluva ballgame. The players
are going to have to play their
hearts out for four quarters."
Christiansen was asked about
Stanford's Rose Bowl chances.
"Pretty slim, but not out of
sight," he said. "It might take a
miracle, but we definitely can't
go unless we win this one. It's a
long-shot possibility. I'd gamble
on our chances. I really believe
we have a chance and I think
most of our players do too."
'Risen to occasion'
Receiver Tony Hill, the proud
owner of two new Stanford
career records, is one of those
players.
"We've risen to the occasion
so far," Hill said. "In our last
three games, there were situa
tions where we needed to move
the ball and we moved the ball."
Hill conceded, though, that
Stanford hasn't looked anything

like a Rose Bowl-quality team so
far this year.
'Potential'
"We have far too much talent
to have scored as few points as
we have and our defense is far
too good to have allowed as
many points as it has. I feel that
we have extremely good person
nel, but we haven't played to our
full potential. In order to be a
Rose Bowl team, you have to
play good all the time and we
haven't been doing that."
Stanford is in fairly good
shape health-wise for the game.

Several players have miitf>r
pains, but only reserve defensive
tackle Steve Howe is listed ;*is
questionable for USC. Howe lyis
a pulled hamstring muscle. J
Middle linebacker tkiriv
Ceresino should start after sit
ting out last week's Oregon Stjjte
game with a slight concussion.
Cardinal notes: Guy Benjamin
is now ranked No. 2 in the coiyi
try in passing and total of
fense...The 6-foot-3, 201-pound

Player of Week
Stanford defensive tackle Duncan McColl, shown registering one of his two quarterback sacks
in Stanford's 24-3 victory over Oregon State last Saturday, has been named Pac-8 defensive
Player of the Week. McColl registered 15 tackles against the Beavers. He also knocked down a
pass at the line of scrimmage, caused two fumbles and recovered two fumbles.
Stanford has several problems
to tackle in its game against USC
Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
Their names are Ricky Bell,
Charles White. Mosi Tatupu and
Dave Farmer.
This illustrious quartet com
prises the core of the Trojans'
running attack.
"The secret to the whole game
willbe tackling,"Cardinal coach
Jack Christiansen told a group of
northern California football
writers at his press breakfast yes
terday. "We have to be able to
stop their runners and force
them to do something they don't
want, like pass.
Evans improved
"The quarterback (Vince
Evans) is improved, but we still
feel like the thing you have to do
against SC is stop the running
game."
Last year, if you stopped Bell,
you stopped USC's offense.
None of their other runners were
major threats and their passing
was, quite frankly, pathetic. The
Trojans have patched up those
weaknesses this season well
enough to rank second in the na
tion in total offense (475.1 yards
a game) and scoring (37.6).
USC may have two of the best
three or four running backs in
the country. There's Bell and
there's his back-up, White. The
freshman tailback will come in
handy Saturday because Bell is
hurting from a hip pointer and
twisted ankle.
First-year Trojan coach John
Robinson says Bell will probably
start, but the injuries "make his
full-time status questionable.
Our big concern is that he has
missed almost two full weeks of
practice, and he's losing some of
his edge."
Good average
White led all SC rushers, in
cluding Bell, last week against
California, gaining 91 yards on
14 carries. His season average of
7.0 yards on 70 carries is almost
twice that of all Stanford run

ners.
When a writer mentioned that
White is gone for good if he
breaks through the line. Christ
iansen said, "That's why we
have a guy in the press box with
a shotgun."
Evans has completed 55 per
cent of his passes this year, quite
an improvement over his 31 per
cent mark of last season.
'Super athletes'
"We're playing a team that is
loaded with super athletes,"
Christiansen said. "They have
10 to 15 senior pro prospects.
They might have the first draft
choice in the country in Bell.
Their pro prospects are spread
all over the team—in the offen
sive and defensive lines, the sec
ondary and at linebacker. They
have size at every position, plus
the speed to go with it."
Stanford does not have such
personnel. To win, Christiansen
said the Cards will have to de
pend "to a large degree on emo
tion.
"If we play the first three quar
ters the way we did against
UCLA and the fourth like we did
against Oregon State, it might be
a helluva ballgame. The players
are going to have to play their
hearts out for four quarters."
Christiansen was asked about
Stanford's Rose Bowl chances.
"Pretty slim, but not out of
sight," he said. "It might take a
miracle, but we definitely can't
go unless we win this one. It's a
long-shot possibility. I'd gamble
on our chances. I really believe
we have a chance and I think
most of our players do too."
'Risen to occasion'
Receiver Tony Hill, the proud
owner of two new Stanford
career records, is one of those
players.
"We've risen to the occasion
so far," Hill said. "In our last
three games, there were situa
tions where we needed to move
the ball and we moved the ball."
Hill conceded, though, that
Stanford hasn't looked anything

like a Rose Bowl-quality team so
far this year.
'Potential'
"We have far too much talent
to have scored as few points as
we have and our defense is far
too good to have allowed as
many points as it has. I feel that
we have extremely good person
nel, but we haven't played to our
full potential. In order to be a
Rose Bowl team, you have to
play good all the time and we
haven't been doing that."
Stanford is in fairly good
shape health-wise for the game.

pains, but only reserve defensive
