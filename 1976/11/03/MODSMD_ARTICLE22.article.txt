# Card poloist eyes 1980 Olympics
## 
### Richard Keller 
If ABC's Jim McKay stops babbling during
the 1980 summer Olympic Games from Mos
cow, the center of attention might just be Drew
McDonald and the U.S. water polo team —that
is, if McDonald has anything to say about it.
The senior has been a four-year starter on the
Card water polo squad. He discovered the sport
at Orinda's Miramonte High, where he led his
team to four consecutive league crowns.
McDonald was named a prep Ail-American his
last two years.
After that auspicious introduction to the
game, it was on to the Farm. McDonald has
been honored as an Amateur Athletic Union
(AAU) and NCAA All-American.
According to Stanford water polo coach Art
Lambert, McDonald, "to be sure," is one ol the
best poloists in the nation.
Complete player
He is a complete player both offensively and
defensively. Already this season, McDonald
has burned opposing goalies for 12 scores. His
Card teammates also look to McDonald for de
fensive leadership.
Lambert said, "Drew has tremendous
savvy—a great knowledge of the game. He keys
our defense and is an excellent outside shooter.
"1 think he stands an excellent chance of
making many national teams," Lambert con
cluded.
McDonald assessed his own strengths say
ing, "My strengths are that I'm big, I'm fast and
1 have long arms. I'm a physical player. I don't

like to take any cheap shots, but I do want to
use my assets as best I can," he said.
'Counter-attack'
"I enjoy playing defense, and starting the
counter-attack. It's like playing guard on a bas
ketball team—you have to set up the plays and
start the fast-break. My job is to prevent the
other team's center from getting the ball. If he
can't get the ball, that shuts down their entire
offense."
When McDonald cocks his muscular right
arm for a shot, he tries "to focus on the entire
goal. I don't have a really quick release like,
say, (Stanford teammate) Marty Davis has, so I
try to freeze the goalie by changing my mo
tion," he added.
l-ast weekend the poloists demolished two of
their stiffest competitors—lJC-Santa Barbara
and defending NCAA champion Cal. To
McDonald, such performances haven't been
unexpected.
"I said before the season started that we
should be NCAA champs. We started slowly,
but now we're really beginning to come on."
Water polo is number one on Drew's agenda
for 1977. The AAU recently decided to revamp
its water polo program since the U.S. polo
squad failed to qualify for the 1976 Olympics.
Consequently, the AAU will be holding tryouts
next year to form a new squad.
"That's why I'm taking next year off," said
McDonald. "I've got a lot of work to do to get to
. that level of play, but Moscow is where I want
to be in 1980."
