# Experts predict Carter's impact on U.S. policy
## 
### John Freed News Analysis 
Assuming the College of Electors provides
110 surprises in its 48th quadrennial meeting
this December and chooses Jimmy Carter as
president, what will the country have to look
forward to?
Experts in economy, defense, affirmative
action, civil liberties, higher education and
agriculture responded to this question in in
terviews yesterday.
The nation's defense posture will remain
basically the same, according to Alain Entho
ven, assistant secretary of defense in the Ken
nedy and Johnson administrations and pro
fessor at the Graduate School of Business.
"I know he made some broad statements
about a cut in the defense budget, but 1 know
when it comes down to specific decision
making that he will have to consider each
program individually," Enthoven said. "The
Soviets have been building up their armed
forces for the last decade or so, and we're
Roinß to have to build up ours."
Carter will press for a Strategic Arms Limi

tation Treaty (SALT) agreement and will
keep troops in Western Europe, Enthoven
predicted.
"It is not likely that there will be any large,
drastic changes." he said. "In all likelihood,
we will continue in pretty much the same
direction we have been going."
That sentiment was echoed by specialists
in agriculture, affirmative action and higher
education.
"It might not matter that much," said Roger
Gray, professor at the Food Research Insti
tute, when asked what impact a change from
a Ford to a Carter administration would have.
World export markets look strong for the
next decade. Gray said, and Carter would
probably not want to intervene in agricultural
markets while things are going well. If things
went poorly. Carter would be more likely
than Ford to use governmental intervention,
Gray surmised.
Leonard Edwards, a spokesperson for the
local American Civil Liberties Union chapter,
sees marked improvement for human free
dom under the Carter administration.

"Civil liberties will be advanced signific
antly. Ford still had the aura of the 'Nixon-
Mitchell/Senate Bill 1/secrecy-i n
government-is-right' era." he argued. "Carter
moves away from that position. He specifi
cally will appoint better people to the bench.
A great amount of civil-liberties protection
comes from the bench—by that. I mean the
courts, both the Supreme Court and the lower
courts," said Edwards.
The diminuation of discrimination has
been helped by the courts, agreed Anne
Miner, university affirmative action offficer.
"In job discrimination, most of the action
has occurred through the courts." she said.
"There is a life (of their own) to the legal
aspects. A particular president could slow it
down or speed it up, but not change the gen
eral direction."
This direction is toward ending discrimi
nation, she said. Advocates from women's
and minority groups see Carter as speeding
up the process, she reported.
"I'm probably underplaying the differ
ences as most people see it. The people in the

groups I deal with...are thoroughly pro-
Carter." she noted.
Bureaucratic inertia will oppose any rever
sal in the affirmative-action trend, she pre
dicted. Civil service employes in the Depart
ments of Labor anil of Health. Education and
Welfare "won't let the programs be dramati
cally affected." she said.
Carter is likely to make additional ef forts to
stimulate the economy, said Asst. Economics
Prof. Michael Boskin.
"I think the unemployment rate will come
down a little faster (under Carter)." he said.
"There is some danger he will rekindle infla
tion, but I think the unemployment rate can
be brought down a little without that happen
ing."
Boskin said that the unemployment rate,
inflation rate and real GNP would have been
at about the same level whether Ford or Carter
were elected. He agreed with Gray, however,
that Carter is more likely to intervene in the
marketplace.
"Carter is more prone to government inter
vention in several markets—for example, in

energy." Buskin Siiid.
The nation should not look for an increase
in federal support of higher education, ac
cording to Assoc. Education Prof. Michael
kirst.
"You're not going to get much spending
done (on higher education) unless there is a
massive growth in the economy, or unless
you cut something, like defense, but there is
not much indication of that." Kirst said.
"Education has not had any priority in either
campaign. It's received very little attention."
What funds may become available are more
likely to go to elementary and secondary edu
cation because that sector has more political
clout, he said.
And that bugaboo of every college
administrator—federal regulation—may in
crease. Kirst suggested.
"Nixon and Ford were not supposed to
favor regulation, but regulation increased
during the last eight years. I don't have a clue
from these campaigns in the area of federal
regulation. The Democrats might go for more
regulation, but that's only a guess." he said.

Miner, university affirmative action offficer.
"In job discrimination, most of the action
has occurred through the courts." she said.
"There is a life (of their own) to the legal
aspects. A particular president could slow it
down or speed it up, but not change the gen
eral direction."
This direction is toward ending discrimi
nation, she said. Advocates from women's
and minority groups see Carter as speeding
up the process, she reported.
"I'm probably underplaying the differ
ences as most people see it. The people in the

groups I deal with...are thoroughly pro-
Carter." she noted.
Bureaucratic inertia will oppose any rever
sal in the affirmative-action trend, she pre
dicted. Civil service employes in the Depart
ments of Labor anil of Health. Education and
Welfare "won't let the programs be dramati
cally affected." she said.
Carter is likely to make additional ef forts to
stimulate the economy, said Asst. Economics
Prof. Michael Boskin.
"I think the unemployment rate will come
down a little faster (under Carter)." he said.
"There is some danger he will rekindle infla
tion, but I think the unemployment rate can
be brought down a little without that happen
ing."
Boskin said that the unemployment rate,
inflation rate and real GNP would have been
at about the same level whether Ford or Carter
were elected. He agreed with Gray, however,
that Carter is more likely to intervene in the
marketplace.
"Carter is more prone to government inter
vention in several markets—for example, in

energy." Buskin Siiid.
The nation should not look for an increase
in federal support of higher education, ac
cording to Assoc. Education Prof. Michael
kirst.
"You're not going to get much spending
done (on higher education) unless there is a
massive growth in the economy, or unless
you cut something, like defense, but there is
not much indication of that." Kirst said.
"Education has not had any priority in either
campaign. It's received very little attention."
What funds may become available are more
likely to go to elementary and secondary edu
cation because that sector has more political
clout, he said.
And that bugaboo of every college
administrator—federal regulation—may in
crease. Kirst suggested.
"Nixon and Ford were not supposed to
favor regulation, but regulation increased
during the last eight years. I don't have a clue
from these campaigns in the area of federal
regulation. The Democrats might go for more
regulation, but that's only a guess." he said.
Assuming the College of Electors provides
110 surprises in its 48th quadrennial meeting
this December and chooses Jimmy Carter as
president, what will the country have to look
forward to?
Experts in economy, defense, affirmative
action, civil liberties, higher education and
agriculture responded to this question in in
terviews yesterday.
The nation's defense posture will remain
basically the same, according to Alain Entho
ven, assistant secretary of defense in the Ken
nedy and Johnson administrations and pro
fessor at the Graduate School of Business.
"I know he made some broad statements
about a cut in the defense budget, but 1 know
when it comes down to specific decision
making that he will have to consider each
program individually," Enthoven said. "The
Soviets have been building up their armed
forces for the last decade or so, and we're
Roinß to have to build up ours."
Carter will press for a Strategic Arms Limi

tation Treaty (SALT) agreement and will
keep troops in Western Europe, Enthoven
predicted.
"It is not likely that there will be any large,
drastic changes." he said. "In all likelihood,
we will continue in pretty much the same
direction we have been going."
That sentiment was echoed by specialists
in agriculture, affirmative action and higher
education.
"It might not matter that much," said Roger
Gray, professor at the Food Research Insti
tute, when asked what impact a change from
a Ford to a Carter administration would have.
World export markets look strong for the
next decade. Gray said, and Carter would
probably not want to intervene in agricultural
markets while things are going well. If things
went poorly. Carter would be more likely
than Ford to use governmental intervention,
Gray surmised.
Leonard Edwards, a spokesperson for the
local American Civil Liberties Union chapter,
sees marked improvement for human free
dom under the Carter administration.

"Civil liberties will be advanced signific
antly. Ford still had the aura of the 'Nixon-
Mitchell/Senate Bill 1/secrecy-i n
government-is-right' era." he argued. "Carter
moves away from that position. He specifi
cally will appoint better people to the bench.
A great amount of civil-liberties protection
comes from the bench—by that. I mean the
courts, both the Supreme Court and the lower
courts," said Edwards.

regulation. The Democrats might go for more
regulation, but that's only a guess." he said.
Assuming the College of Electors provides
110 surprises in its 48th quadrennial meeting
this December and chooses Jimmy Carter as
president, what will the country have to look
forward to?
Experts in economy, defense, affirmative
action, civil liberties, higher education and
agriculture responded to this question in in
terviews yesterday.
The nation's defense posture will remain
basically the same, according to Alain Entho
ven, assistant secretary of defense in the Ken
nedy and Johnson administrations and pro
fessor at the Graduate School of Business.
"I know he made some broad statements
about a cut in the defense budget, but 1 know
when it comes down to specific decision
making that he will have to consider each
program individually," Enthoven said. "The
Soviets have been building up their armed
forces for the last decade or so, and we're
Roinß to have to build up ours."
Carter will press for a Strategic Arms Limi

tation Treaty (SALT) agreement and will
keep troops in Western Europe, Enthoven
predicted.
"It is not likely that there will be any large,
drastic changes." he said. "In all likelihood,
we will continue in pretty much the same
direction we have been going."
That sentiment was echoed by specialists
in agriculture, affirmative action and higher
education.
"It might not matter that much," said Roger
Gray, professor at the Food Research Insti
tute, when asked what impact a change from
a Ford to a Carter administration would have.
World export markets look strong for the
next decade. Gray said, and Carter would
probably not want to intervene in agricultural
markets while things are going well. If things
went poorly. Carter would be more likely
than Ford to use governmental intervention,
Gray surmised.
Leonard Edwards, a spokesperson for the
local American Civil Liberties Union chapter,
sees marked improvement for human free
dom under the Carter administration.

"Civil liberties will be advanced signific
antly. Ford still had the aura of the 'Nixon-
Mitchell/Senate Bill 1/secrecy-i n
government-is-right' era." he argued. "Carter
moves away from that position. He specifi
cally will appoint better people to the bench.
A great amount of civil-liberties protection
comes from the bench—by that. I mean the
courts, both the Supreme Court and the lower
courts," said Edwards.
The diminuation of discrimination has
been helped by the courts, agreed Anne
Miner, university affirmative action offficer.
"In job discrimination, most of the action
has occurred through the courts." she said.
"There is a life (of their own) to the legal
aspects. A particular president could slow it
down or speed it up, but not change the gen
eral direction."
This direction is toward ending discrimi
nation, she said. Advocates from women's
and minority groups see Carter as speeding
up the process, she reported.
"I'm probably underplaying the differ
ences as most people see it. The people in the

groups I deal with...are thoroughly pro-
Carter." she noted.
Bureaucratic inertia will oppose any rever
sal in the affirmative-action trend, she pre
dicted. Civil service employes in the Depart
ments of Labor anil of Health. Education and
Welfare "won't let the programs be dramati
cally affected." she said.
Carter is likely to make additional ef forts to
stimulate the economy, said Asst. Economics
Prof. Michael Boskin.
"I think the unemployment rate will come
down a little faster (under Carter)." he said.
"There is some danger he will rekindle infla
tion, but I think the unemployment rate can
be brought down a little without that happen
ing."
Boskin said that the unemployment rate,
inflation rate and real GNP would have been
at about the same level whether Ford or Carter
were elected. He agreed with Gray, however,
that Carter is more likely to intervene in the
marketplace.
"Carter is more prone to government inter
vention in several markets—for example, in

energy." Buskin Siiid.
The nation should not look for an increase
in federal support of higher education, ac
cording to Assoc. Education Prof. Michael
kirst.
"You're not going to get much spending
done (on higher education) unless there is a
massive growth in the economy, or unless
you cut something, like defense, but there is
not much indication of that." Kirst said.
"Education has not had any priority in either
campaign. It's received very little attention."
What funds may become available are more
likely to go to elementary and secondary edu
cation because that sector has more political
clout, he said.
And that bugaboo of every college
administrator—federal regulation—may in
crease. Kirst suggested.
"Nixon and Ford were not supposed to
favor regulation, but regulation increased
during the last eight years. I don't have a clue
from these campaigns in the area of federal
regulation. The Democrats might go for more
regulation, but that's only a guess." he said.
