# Students yawn and party while results are tallied
## 
### 
By Jacob Young

As the results came over the national
networks, salvos of cheers erupted
from the 200 people packed into the
lounge of the American Studies house.
The Hand and Dollies had just left, and
there were still three kegs sitting un
tapped. It was more like a party than
anything, but the undercurrents of the
whole affair were serious.
Meanwhile, at Tresidder, a crowd of
much older observers watched as Wal
ter Cronkite delivered the tales of new
power. The only thing that really
seemed to get them into action was a
Gallo Hearty Burgundy ad. Boos and
catcalls broke the silence every time
the bottle was tipped.
So the campus was interested in the
results of yesterday's election. Meyer
library attendance was "substantially
less" than on normal nights, according
to Mark Renner, who sits at the entr
ance desk each Tuesday night. It ap
peared that there were about half as
many bikes as usual parked outside
I T.LY, and you might have been able
to study there last night.
Thecampus.forail indications.took
a break from midterm cramming last
night to watch what may have been
some of the closest and most bitterly
fought elections in years. Popular
support for many issues was high and
ran deep, but no real demonstrations of
anger or bitterness were to be seen
here.
Frosh fans
In Larkin. an all-freshman dorm in
Stern Hall, a huge yellow plastic bag of
popcorn was surrounded by about 10
students, and all eyes were riveted to
the black and white set in the basement
lounge.
"Stern is 100 per cent pro-Carter,"

proclaimed one of the guys sprawled
on the floor. "Or at least everyone in
here's for him." Yeahs and uh-uhs
floated around the room.
Bill MacDougall, editor of the con
servative Stanford Arena, commented
that he has been in an "optimistic
mood" over Ford's chances for the past
few weeks.
"But because of the good weather,
which will mean a good turnout, I
think Carter will win. Most marginal
voters are Democrats," MacDougall
said.
Despite the excitement and real ac
tion in some parts of thecampus. many
students just didn't seem to care about
the election. Many felt no real choices
were offered in the major races, and
disappointment over the alternatives
caused one grad student to comment,
"I'm mildly constipated. It just doesn't
get me moving."
Farmworkers
Another student said she hoped
Prop. 14 passes, because "farmworkers
deserve their rights." But concern over
the United Farm Workers (UFW) spon
sored bill, which was defeated
soundly, raged down to the wire as
both ranchers and farmworkers en
gaged in dubious advertising cam
paigns.
Cindy Carlson, a member of the UFW
Support Committee here said she
thought "enormous advertising and
money defeated Prop. 14."
Prof. Raymond Giraud of the French
and Italian Departments, said he felt
the defeat of Prop. 14 is "a tragic
thing." He attributed the defeat to the
fact that "people are just not suffi
ciently sympathetic to the farmwor
kers. Either people are not aware or
they don't care."
House race
In another race which stirred much
local action. Stanford alums David
Harris and Paul McCloskey faced off in
the local congressional race, with
McCloskey coming out the clear win
ner.
Economics Prof. George Bach said
he was pleased about the McCloskey
victory, and that he felt McCloskey
"has done a good job."
Meanwhile. Harris supporters
promised that they were "saving their
bumper stickers" in anticipation of
another race in two years.
At about 1 a.m. today, all three major
networks declared Jimmy Carter the
winner in the presidential race. No
clear campus reaction was evident. It
seemed that most persons had pre
pared themselves for the eventual suc
cession of the Georgian to the White
House.
Doug Gamble, visiting professor in
the History Department, and a native

of Tennessee, said he "didn't support
i Carter just because he was a south
> erner," and that he "did not giveactive
support to the campaign.
"I did spend some time convincing
I people to vote for Carter," Camble
: said, "but I wouldn't really call it sup
: port."
'Party' politics
Dave Burnett, head of the Carter
[ campaign on campus, predicted a Car
-1 ter victory at about 9:30 last night.
I "You can quote me," he said, "I'm
drunk."
Indeed, after a few beers, most of the
r crowd at the American Studies house
t seemed to loosen up and get involved
; with the spirit as much as the sub-
I stance of the event. Champagne was
; poured for all, and the election returns
, soon seemed all but forgotten,
t "Who cares about California?"
shouted one student as the results of
the California presidential votes came
1 in. "For all 1 care, they can just slide
i into the ocean."
