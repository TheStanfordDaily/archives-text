In local elections last night, incum
bent Democratic assemblyman Victor
Calvo easily defeated Republican chal
lenger Sandy Sanger in the 21st dis
trict, and Santa Clara County voter
turnout was the heaviest recorded in at
least 12 years, election officials said.
With 41.5 per cent of the precincts
reporting, Calvo led Sanger 24,730 to
12,612. Calvo, who was elected to the
newly established district two years
ago. was favored over Sanger, a trans
portation consultant and former taxi

fleet owner.
The county-wide turnout exceeded
81 per cent of registered voters, not
counting absentee ballots. Only in the
Johnson-Goldwater race in 1964 did
turnout approach that level, when 68
per cent of the electorate voted, ac
cording to a county election official.
"It's much higher than anyone ex
pected." said Don McCorquodale,
head of the Santa Clara County Board
of Supervisors.
However, he did not attribute the
heavy turnout to the Ford-Carter race.

"I don't think that that was really the
big issue. The debates kind of forced
them to the point that they were pretty
much even," he said.
The issues that brought the voters
out, according to McCorquodale, were
Prop. 14, anil the U.S. Senate race and
local San Jose City Council elections.
Ed Crouch, Election Central Coor
dinator for Santa Clara County, said
that voter turnout in average years ran
between 50 and 60 per cent.
At his headquarters late last night
Calvo said he was pleased with his
strong showing and attributed his vic
tory to widespread bipartisan support.
"I relate well to the constituency.
The people know who 1 am and what 1
stand for." Calvo said.
In Palo Alto, voters approved all
three propositions by almost 3-1 mar
gins.
Proposition G extends the period be
tween filing of recall and initiative pet
itions and the date of election.
Proposition H, a technical measure,
will allow the Red Cross to continue
using city property on which it is
headquartered.
Proposition I clears the way for con
struction of a State funded mixed-level
rental housing development proposed
on Webster Avenue.
