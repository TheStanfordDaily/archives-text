### Bonny Rodden 
Faced with two liberals as major
candidates, residents in the 12th con
gressional district voted by a more
than 2 to 1 margin, to send the more
conservative of the two. Rep. Paul M.
McCloskey Jr., back to Washington
D.C. for his fifth term in the U.S.
House.
With 63 per cent of the vote in, the
Republican incumbent won 80,776
votes, his Democratic challenger
David Harris garnered 36,906 votes
and American Independent candidate
Joss Cooney came in third with a vote
total of 3216.
When the San Mateo County votes
were tabulated and it was clear Harris
had lost by a 2.5 to 1 margin in the
county's precincts, he was asked what
he planned to do.
"Oh, you mean after the gang bang. I
plan to rest too." he said, echoing the
response of his campaign manager
Dennis Church.
Long struggle
kit Bricca. chairman of the David
Harris for Congress Committee, re
marked, "There are all kinds of people
who want David to run again, includ
ing David. His whole life has been a
long-term struggle."
Harris confirmed that he planned to
run again.
Harris campaigner and Stanford
student activist Chris Cray added.
"We'll kill McCloskey in two years if
he doesn't retire. We have saved our
extra bumper stickers for 197 H."
McCloskey accepted victory with
100 percent of the conservative south
ern San Mateo County vote tallied and
about five per cent of the Santa Clara
County counted.
He referred to Harris but never men
tioned his name. "This fellow ran a
good campaign against me. He showed
me a lot of idealism," he said.
McCloskey told his cheering sup
porters at Rickey's Hyatt House in
Mountain View not to count him out in
1978. "I may put you all through this
again two years from now." he said.
After his speech, McCloskey put his

arms around his 84-year-old mother
and picked her up.
'Good lawyer'
His mother, Vera McCloskey, a 1915
Stanford graduate, said before the ac
ceptance speech that she "would pre
fer he not be in politics. He is a good
lawyer. I'd really much rather he
would practice law."
Commenting on McCloskey's over
whelming victory, McCloskey staff
member )oan Williams confirmed that
McCloskey is the more conservative of
the two major candidates, "but 1 don't
think that's why he won. I think he
won because of his independent vot
ing record."
McCloskey is a Republican but has
taken many anti-administration
stands, including opposing the Viet
nam War during the Nixon presi
dency.
Pete's success
McCloskey staff member Mary
O'Neil attributed the incumbent's suc
cess to "Pete's integrity, his respon
siveness to constituents, his availabil
ity. People trust him. He says what he
thinks. People have just gotten to
know him over the past nine years."
McCloskey has returned to his dis
trict regularly to speak wih his con
stituents in informal discussion ses
sions.
O'Neil added. "I think it's been more
of a personality campaign. The issues
didn't play a dominant role. Their
ends are the same. Their means are
different. The emotional issues of the
'60s, Nixon and the war are gone."
However, the two candidates waged
a pitched battle, debating more than
two dozen times publicly to make their
separate stands known.
The judge
During the debate on government re
form at Kresge Auditorium here,
McCloskey defended his votes on var
ious bills which were listed in a Harris
pamphlet entitled "You Bethe Judge."
Harris criticized McCloskey for vot
ing against the Emergency Jobs Ap
propriations Bill after telling his San
Jose constituents that he would sup

port it.
McCloskey responded that he voted
against the bill when President Gerald
Ford informed him the bill would ex
ceed the congressional budget by
about $2 billion.
Harris has supported a program in
which each business and citizen
would be allotted a specific amount of
energy to be purchased at controlled
prices. Those persons purchasing fuel
in excess of the quota would pay dere
gulated prices.
Despite Harris' defeat, the anti-war

supporter, who was imprisoned for
months for resisting the draft, fought a
pitched battle. Entering the race with
the office ot ASSU president as his
only political experience, Harris de
feated Norman Shaskey in the Democ
ratic primary.
McCloskey said on a television in
terview that with Harris "looking over
his shoulder," he was not obligated to
keep his campaign promises.
