# Hayakawa slips by Tunney
## 
### Bill Snyder 
Republican candidate S.I. Hayakawa edged incumbent
Democrat John Tunney to capture the Senate seat last
night.
With 71 per cent of the precincts reporting at 1:30 a.m.
today, Hayakawa had 2,510,000 votes to Tunney's
2,481,000.
Most experts predicted that the race would be close. The
most recent pre-election poll showed Tunney with 45 per
cent of the votes cast and Hayakawa with 43 per cent.
Hayakawa capitalized on the conservative nature of
California voters, despite the fact that a majority of Demo
crats registered to vote this year.
Tunney led in liberal San Francisco and some southern
California counties, though he fell behind in conservative
Orange County.
Valley support
Hayakawa had strong support from the agricultural
central valley, presumably because of his opposition to
Prop. 14. He also had the support of professional people
and white collar workers.
The close race culminates months of fierce campaign
ing by the candidates, in which they fought head to head
on many issues.
Tunney supported the Carter amnesty plan for Vietnam
draft evaders. Hayakawa opposed it.
Tunney favored breaking up the major oil companies.
Hayakawa opposed that, too.
Tunney proposed an increased federal role in providing
full employment and health care. Hayakawa said he felt
private enterprise should take those responsibilities. He
favored the repeal of child labor laws and lowering the
minimum wage to make more jobs available for youth.
Tunney supported and Hayakawa opposed Prop. 14. the
farm labor issue.

Hayakawa had been criticized for racial insensitivity
because of his remark that World War II relocation centers
in which Japanese Americans were interned had some
"unexpected benefits" in helping to assimilate Japanese
Americans into American culture.
Tunney saw no benefits in the centers. He referred to
them as "prison camps."
On several occasions during the campaign, Hayakawa
admitted he didn't know the answers. When asked how he
would handle a fluctuating economy, he said. "God. I
don't know. These are among the things I've got to learn."
Tunney has hammered Hayakawa about his uncer
tainty. questioning whether he was qualified to run for the
Senate.
Tunney's critics pointed to his poor voting record in the
Senate this year. According to the Congressional Quar
terly, Tunney missed over 500 roll call votes. He voted in
23 per cent of the total f>BB, which is far below the Senate
average of 83 per cent.
Previous voting attendance high
However, for the first five years of his term. Tunney
voted in an average of 83-90 per cent of the roll call votes.
Hayakawa, a former semanticist and university profes
sor, had never run for public office before the primary. He
has been a Republican for only three years. He has said
that his position as a newcomer to politics helped him win
the primary.
Hayakawa's colorful and outspoken image dates back to
1968, when he was appointed acting president of San
Francisco State College. At one point during a student
strike, he silenced a demonstration by ripping out the
wires from the top of the sound truck.
Hayakawa relied on his image and his traditional con
servative stance to draw support away from Tunney. who
is a three term congressional veteran.

On several occasions during the campaign, Hayakawa
admitted he didn't know the answers. When asked how he
would handle a fluctuating economy, he said. "God. I
don't know. These are among the things I've got to learn."
Tunney has hammered Hayakawa about his uncer
tainty. questioning whether he was qualified to run for the
Senate.
Tunney's critics pointed to his poor voting record in the
Senate this year. According to the Congressional Quar
terly, Tunney missed over 500 roll call votes. He voted in
23 per cent of the total f>BB, which is far below the Senate
average of 83 per cent.
Previous voting attendance high
However, for the first five years of his term. Tunney
voted in an average of 83-90 per cent of the roll call votes.
Hayakawa, a former semanticist and university profes
sor, had never run for public office before the primary. He
has been a Republican for only three years. He has said
that his position as a newcomer to politics helped him win
the primary.
Hayakawa's colorful and outspoken image dates back to
1968, when he was appointed acting president of San
Francisco State College. At one point during a student
strike, he silenced a demonstration by ripping out the
wires from the top of the sound truck.
Hayakawa relied on his image and his traditional con
servative stance to draw support away from Tunney. who
is a three term congressional veteran.
Republican candidate S.I. Hayakawa edged incumbent
Democrat John Tunney to capture the Senate seat last
night.
With 71 per cent of the precincts reporting at 1:30 a.m.
today, Hayakawa had 2,510,000 votes to Tunney's
2,481,000.
Most experts predicted that the race would be close. The
most recent pre-election poll showed Tunney with 45 per
cent of the votes cast and Hayakawa with 43 per cent.
Hayakawa capitalized on the conservative nature of
California voters, despite the fact that a majority of Demo
crats registered to vote this year.
Tunney led in liberal San Francisco and some southern
California counties, though he fell behind in conservative
Orange County.
Valley support
Hayakawa had strong support from the agricultural
central valley, presumably because of his opposition to
Prop. 14. He also had the support of professional people
and white collar workers.
The close race culminates months of fierce campaign
ing by the candidates, in which they fought head to head
on many issues.
Tunney supported the Carter amnesty plan for Vietnam
draft evaders. Hayakawa opposed it.
Tunney favored breaking up the major oil companies.
Hayakawa opposed that, too.
Tunney proposed an increased federal role in providing
full employment and health care. Hayakawa said he felt
private enterprise should take those responsibilities. He
favored the repeal of child labor laws and lowering the
minimum wage to make more jobs available for youth.
Tunney supported and Hayakawa opposed Prop. 14. the
farm labor issue.

Hayakawa had been criticized for racial insensitivity
because of his remark that World War II relocation centers
in which Japanese Americans were interned had some
"unexpected benefits" in helping to assimilate Japanese
Americans into American culture.
Tunney saw no benefits in the centers. He referred to
them as "prison camps."
