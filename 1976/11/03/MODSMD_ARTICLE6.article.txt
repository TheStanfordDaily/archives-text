# Democrats gain strength in statehouses
## 
### Karen Caesar Martin Kernberg 
Democrats riding on Jimmy Carter's
coattails of victory have slightly in
creased control in statehouses across
the country. They now hold ,J7 of 50
governorships.
Democrats won nine of 14 guber
natorial contests, increasing their total
from 36 to 37. while Republicans cap
tured five races, decreasing their total
trom 1H to 12. Thirty six governors —
2H Democrats, seven Republicans, and
an Independent — did not com 6 up for
re-election
Some results from key states:
Missouri saw one of the biggest up
sets in the country in the race for its top
job. Incumbent Republican Governor
Christopher "Kit" Bond. 37. a pre
election favorite, and one-time vice
presidential hopeful, was defeated by
a margi nof 51 per cent to 49 per cent.
Democratic lawyer Joseph Teasdale is
his replacement.
Teasdale. .t neo-populist lawyer, ran
his campaign from the back of a white
pick-up truck. Though the Republi
cans carried the Senate with John Dan
forth, traditionally Democratic Mis
souri voters split their tickets to give
the presidency and the governorship
to the Democrats.
The contest in West Virginia ended
with Democrat John D. "Jay" Rockefel
ler IV following in the footsteps of Re
publican uncles Nelson and VVinthrop.
both of whom have headed state gov
ernments in the past. It was Jay Roc
kefeller's second try for the job. I le lost
two years ago to incumbent Arch
Moore, who cannot succeed himself.
Strip mining
Rockefeller outspent his opponent
by ;i wide margin and carefully mod-

ified his previous 1974 stand on strip
mining, a critical West Virginia indus
try. Two years ago. Rockefeller prop
osed a ban on strip mining; this year,
Rockefeller supported strip mining,
but urged funding projects to reclaim
mined areas.
In races where women were guber
natorial candidates. Democrat Dixie
Lee Ray. ftl. former head of the Atomic
Energy Commission, defeated county
executive John Spellman in
Washington state, while Ford took its
nine electoral votes.
In Vermont. Democratic conserva
tive Stella Hackel lost to Republican
Richard Snelling.
Carter's strong showing in various
states assisted Democratic aspirants
and incumbents. In Arkansas, Gov.
David I'ryor secured re-election over
minor Republican opposition. North
Carolina's unified Democratic Party
led by Lt. Gov. fames Hunt secured the
governorship for Hunt and the presi
dential electoral vote for Carter. Even
though Carter's stand on abortion re
duced his margin of victory among
Rhode Island's Catholic voters (6ft per
cent of the electorate), Carter's coat
tails were long enough to aid Democrat
J. Joseph Garrahy's bid for the gover
nor's chair.
Divided Democrats
New Hampshire's Democrats seri
ously divided over Carter's successful
bid tor the Democratic presidential
nomination. The disorganized Democ
ratic party was easily overcome by in
cumbent Republican Meldrim Thom
son's gubernatorial effort. In Indiana.
Otis Bowen easily seized the
statehouse taking advantage of his
image as a benevolent physician; Dr.
Bowen previously practiced medicine

in the state. Ford's victory in Indiana
and the Republican gubernatorial
triumph swept Democratic incumbent
Vance Hartke out of office, giving the
Senate seat to Richard Lugar, the con
servative ex-mayor of Indianapolis.
In several states carried by Ford,
Democratic aspirants were still able to
edge out their Republican opponents.
Utah's Democrat Scott Matheson over
came Republican opponent Romney,
in spite of Congressman Allan Howe's
conviction on sex-solicitation charges
which crippled the state Democratic
Party. In North Dakota, which went to
Ford in the presidential race, Arthur
Link beat Richard Elkin to give the
Democrats another statehouse. Attor
ney General Robert Woodahl lost to
Democrat incumbent Thomas Judge in
Montana.
In Illinois, thebiggest of the 14 states
electing governors, Republican "Big
Jim" Thompson, an up-and-coming
political star and a former U.S. attor
ney who has convicted some of
Chicago Democratic Mayor Richard
Daley's followers, defeated Secretary
of State Michael Howlett. Howlett, a
political veteran, was hand-picked for
the race by Daley.
Convictions
Thompson has secured hundreds of
convictions against both Democratic
and Republican state officials in Il
linois; his political prestige propelled
him to victory over the traditional
Democratic forces centered in Cook
County.
Although Carter carried Delaware,
the governor's seat was captured by a
Republican congressman, Pierre du
Pont IV, 41, of E.I. duPont de Nemours
Company, a major national chemical

firm. Du Pont industries are based in
Delaware and are a mainstay of the
state's economy.
The GOP had hoped this year to halt
or perhaps reverse a downhill trend
that began in the 1970 election. That
year, Democrats took 11 of the 32 seats
held by Republicans, one more in each
of the next three years, then five in
1974.
One of the more interesting national
trends was the gubernatorial victories
taken by moderate politicians with
large personal resources. Among these
were John D. Rockefeller IV in Arkan
sas and Pierre "Peter" du Pont IV, in
Delaware. Interestingly, du Pont spent
none of his own funds and limited do
nations to 100 dollars.

Link beat Richard Elkin to give the
Democrats another statehouse. Attor
ney General Robert Woodahl lost to
Democrat incumbent Thomas Judge in
Montana.
In Illinois, thebiggest of the 14 states
electing governors, Republican "Big
Jim" Thompson, an up-and-coming
political star and a former U.S. attor
ney who has convicted some of
Chicago Democratic Mayor Richard
Daley's followers, defeated Secretary
of State Michael Howlett. Howlett, a
political veteran, was hand-picked for
the race by Daley.
Convictions
Thompson has secured hundreds of
convictions against both Democratic
and Republican state officials in Il
linois; his political prestige propelled
him to victory over the traditional
Democratic forces centered in Cook
County.
Although Carter carried Delaware,
the governor's seat was captured by a
Republican congressman, Pierre du
Pont IV, 41, of E.I. duPont de Nemours
Company, a major national chemical

firm. Du Pont industries are based in
Delaware and are a mainstay of the
state's economy.
The GOP had hoped this year to halt
or perhaps reverse a downhill trend
that began in the 1970 election. That
year, Democrats took 11 of the 32 seats
held by Republicans, one more in each
of the next three years, then five in
1974.
One of the more interesting national
trends was the gubernatorial victories
taken by moderate politicians with
large personal resources. Among these
were John D. Rockefeller IV in Arkan
sas and Pierre "Peter" du Pont IV, in
Delaware. Interestingly, du Pont spent
none of his own funds and limited do
nations to 100 dollars.

Some results from key states:
Missouri saw one of the biggest up

In races where women were guber
natorial candidates. Democrat Dixie
Lee Ray. ftl. former head of the Atomic
Energy Commission, defeated county
executive John Spellman in
Washington state, while Ford took its
nine electoral votes.
In Vermont. Democratic conserva
tive Stella Hackel lost to Republican
Richard Snelling.
Carter's strong showing in various
states assisted Democratic aspirants
and incumbents. In Arkansas, Gov.
David I'ryor secured re-election over
minor Republican opposition. North
Carolina's unified Democratic Party
led by Lt. Gov. fames Hunt secured the
governorship for Hunt and the presi
dential electoral vote for Carter. Even
though Carter's stand on abortion re
duced his margin of victory among
Rhode Island's Catholic voters (6ft per
cent of the electorate), Carter's coat
tails were long enough to aid Democrat
J. Joseph Garrahy's bid for the gover
nor's chair.
Divided Democrats
New Hampshire's Democrats seri
ously divided over Carter's successful
bid tor the Democratic presidential
nomination. The disorganized Democ
ratic party was easily overcome by in
cumbent Republican Meldrim Thom
son's gubernatorial effort. In Indiana.
Otis Bowen easily seized the
statehouse taking advantage of his
image as a benevolent physician; Dr.
Bowen previously practiced medicine

in the state. Ford's victory in Indiana
and the Republican gubernatorial
triumph swept Democratic incumbent
Vance Hartke out of office, giving the
Senate seat to Richard Lugar, the con
servative ex-mayor of Indianapolis.
In several states carried by Ford,
Democratic aspirants were still able to
edge out their Republican opponents.
Utah's Democrat Scott Matheson over
came Republican opponent Romney,
in spite of Congressman Allan Howe's
conviction on sex-solicitation charges
which crippled the state Democratic
Party. In North Dakota, which went to
Ford in the presidential race, Arthur
Link beat Richard Elkin to give the
Democrats another statehouse. Attor
ney General Robert Woodahl lost to
Democrat incumbent Thomas Judge in
Montana.
In Illinois, thebiggest of the 14 states
electing governors, Republican "Big
Jim" Thompson, an up-and-coming
political star and a former U.S. attor
ney who has convicted some of
Chicago Democratic Mayor Richard
Daley's followers, defeated Secretary
of State Michael Howlett. Howlett, a
political veteran, was hand-picked for
the race by Daley.
Convictions
Thompson has secured hundreds of
convictions against both Democratic
and Republican state officials in Il
linois; his political prestige propelled
him to victory over the traditional
Democratic forces centered in Cook
County.
Although Carter carried Delaware,
the governor's seat was captured by a
Republican congressman, Pierre du
Pont IV, 41, of E.I. duPont de Nemours
Company, a major national chemical

firm. Du Pont industries are based in
Delaware and are a mainstay of the
state's economy.
The GOP had hoped this year to halt
or perhaps reverse a downhill trend
that began in the 1970 election. That
year, Democrats took 11 of the 32 seats
held by Republicans, one more in each
of the next three years, then five in
1974.
One of the more interesting national
trends was the gubernatorial victories
taken by moderate politicians with
large personal resources. Among these
were John D. Rockefeller IV in Arkan
sas and Pierre "Peter" du Pont IV, in
Delaware. Interestingly, du Pont spent
none of his own funds and limited do
nations to 100 dollars.

presidential hopeful, was defeated by
a margi nof 51 per cent to 49 per cent.
