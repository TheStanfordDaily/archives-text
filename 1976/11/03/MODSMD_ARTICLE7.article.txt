# Democrats lose House seats; Senate majority unchanged
## 
### Martin Kernberg Pan Demetrakakes 
The Democrats lost their veto-proof
House as a result of last night's con
gressional elections but retained their
majority in the Senate.
As of 2 a.m. today, the Democrats
had won 258 seats and were leading in
29 congressional races. Assuming that
they won those 29 seats, the Democrats
would have 287 seats in the House, a
net loss of three. It takes 290 votes to
override a presidential veto.
The Republicans had won 125 con
gressional races and were leading in
23 as of 2 a.m.
The Democrats took 21 senatorial
races and the Republicans, 10. Califor
nia's election was too close to call at
press time.
The 21 Democratic victories mean
that the Democrats will at least retain
their previous total of 62 Senate seats.
Women and freshmen
In the House races, two categories of
Democratic incumbents did particu
larly well â€” women representatives
and so-called "Watergate freshmen,"
first-term representatives from nor
mally conservative districts who were
propelled into office by the backlash
over Watergate two years ago.

Here are rundowns of some of the
more interesting Senate races across
the nation:
New York
Incumbent Republican James
Buckley was defeated by Democrat
Daniel Moynihan. former ambassador
to the United Nations. Both men are
conservative, although Buckley is
more so. The liberal vote in the Democ
ratic primary was split between former
Rep. Bella Abzug and former Atty.
Gen. Ramsey Clark. Major differences
between Mpynihan and Buckley in
cluded federal aid to New York City
(Moynihan is for it. Buckley, against)
and Jimmy Carter's plan for federal aid
for employment (Moynihan for.
Buckley against).
Maryland
The incumbent, J. Glenn Beall. was
defeated by Paul Sarbanes, a liberal
Democratic representative. The
backgrounds of the two men differ
markedly. Beall, educated at Exeter
Academy and Yale University, won
his senate seat in 1970 with heavy
support from the Nixon White House
and was a strong supporter of Richard
Nixon during Watergate. Sarbanes, a
Greek-American whose father owned a
small restaurant, served on the House
Judiciary Committee vyhen it drafted
articles of impeachment against Nixon
and was one of Nixon's most outspo
ken critics.
Ohio
In an upset, Democrat Howard Met
zenbaum defeated Republican Robert
Taft, the scion of two generations of
respected Ohio conservatives. Met
zenbaum was appointed to the senate
in 1974 to fill a vacancy, but was
ousted shortly thereafter by former as
tronaut John Glenn. Metzenbaum, a
rich businessman, is a liberal who ad
vocates defense cutbacks and more
protection for the consumer.
Pennsylvania
Republican John Heinz 111, heir to
the pickle-and-catsup fortune, de
feated Democrat William Green 111.
Since both men are relatively liberal,
the campaign centered on per
sonalities rather than issues. Green
tried to make political capital out of an
allegedly illegal $6000 contribution by
Gulf Oil to Heinz' campaign. Heinz

successfully linked Green to the con
servative machine of Democratic
mayor Frank Rizzo of Philadelphia. In
a revolt against Rizzo. Philadelphia's
Democrats turned against Green and
thus threw the election to Heinz.
Michigan
In another race that centered on per
sonalities, liberal Democratic candi
date Don Rigledefeated liberal Repub
lican Marvin Esch. Rigle almost blewa
17-point lead in the polls after the De
troit Ncivs accused him of cheating on
his income tax. Rigle will fill the seat
of Democrat Philip Hart, who retired
after discovering he had cancer.
Tennessee
In an election upset, incumbent Re
publican William Brqck was defeated
by Democrat James Sasser. Sasser's
strategies included charging Brock
with being a spokesman for big busi
ness and reminding the voters of
Brock's up-to-the-end defense of Ni
xon.
Arizona
Democrat Dennis DeGoncini scored
an upset victory over Republican in
cumbent Samuel Steiger. The ultra
conservative Steiger probably lost
support because of the heatedness and
divisiveness of the Republican prim
ary. in which he was opposed by Rep.
John Golan, another conservative.
Utah
In yet another upset, conservative
Republican Orrin Hatch defeated
Democratic incumbent Frank Moss,
who suffered from the conviction of
Democratic Rep. Allan Howe on a
charge of soliciting prostitutes.
Howe's conviction probably affected
the entire Utah Democratic party.
Indiana
As was expected, Richard Lugar. the
former mayor of Indianapolis, unsea
ted Vance Hartke, the Democratic in
cumbent. Indiana's representation in
the senate will thusbebrought morein
line with its conservative consti
tuency.
Missouri
Liberal Republican John Danforth,
former attorney general of Missouri,
defeated Democrat Warren Hearnes.
Hearnes, a member of the Missouri
Democratic machine, replaced Rep.
Jerry Litton, who was killed in a plane
crash hours after winning the Democ
ratic primary.
