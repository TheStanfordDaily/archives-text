# Jimmy Maddox or Lester Carter?
## 
### 
San Francisco (AF) â€” Some voters complained yester
day that they had accidentally voted for Lester Maddox
instead of Jimmy Carter because of the way ballot levers
were lined up. election officials said.
A look at a typical voting machine revealed that the
levers in the polling booth did not match up exactly with
the candidates' names.
Carter was flanked on the right by Maddox. American
Independent Party candidate, and on the left by the candi
dates from the Socialist Workers' Party.
The lever for Carter only extended as far as his first
name. The rest of the lever was above the Socialist ticket.
The lever for Maddox straddled the last half of Carter's
name and extended as far as Maddox's first name.
Gerald Ford's name appeared first, on the far left of the
list of presidential candidates.
As a result of complaints, local radio stations began
announcements cautioning voters to take special care

when making selections in the booths.
Thomas Kearney, registrar of voters, said he had re
ceived about a doren calls from voters upset about pulling
the wrong lever. He said it was up to the voter to pay closer
attention to the levers.
Chuck Hurley, a local Carter campaign aide, said his
office also had been receiving calls from persons con
cerned because "the levers were not lined up well with the
candidates."
"One women called here in tears because she realized
she had voted for Maddox instead of Carter," Hurley said.
"We're reporting this to the U.S. Attorney's office to look
into it and see it it warrants any further action."
Kearney said he was "quite enthused" by the early voter
turnout yesterday. He said a sampling of key precincts at
10 a.m. showed a 21.8 per cent turnout, up three per cent
from 1972 presidential election. He is predicting an over
all turnout of 76 per cent.
