# Panel reviews Honor Code

Students need to be made more
aware of the honor code if it is to sur
vive, Ombudsman John Goheen said
yesterday at a panel discussion to
evaluate the present status of Stan
ford's honor code.
Goheen, James Lyons, dean of stu
dent affairs, and Michael Gage, a Dan
forth Fellow and teaching fellow in the
math department, answered questions
concerning the honor code posed by
an audience of fifteen at the Stanford
Center for Research and Development
in Teaching.
"My idea is that students take re
sponsibility for honor. They individu
ally affirm to fellow students that they
won't cheat. The faculty is then able to
relinquish some of the responsibility,"
Gage said.
Questions were posed regarding
faculty and administrative input to
uphold the honor code. Some persons
said they felt instructors are in viola
tion of the code when they stay to proc
tor tests, and should be encouraged to
uphold their end of the code by leaving
the roonj.
Reciprocity
"We certainly do need such a type of
reciprocity, but if students will take on
the responsibilities of reporting (in
structor violations) that will be true
enforcement of the code," Gage said.
Several listeners posed questions
regarding the penalty procedure for
honor code violations to both faculty
and students.
"There are two different procedures,
one being trial before a legislative
council (composed of both faculty and
students) and the other being admis
sion of guilt to Lyons. Students maybe
suspended for a quarter or may lose
credit in the course," Goheen said.
Students who wish to report faculty

violations may go to the chairman of
the department, then to the dean, then
to the president of the university, ac
cording to Goheen.
"Generally this method is used ef
fectively only in student groups.
Sometimes I call the instructor myself
or I ask the instructor questions as to
his awareness of existence of the
code," Goheen said.
Students unaware
According to survey results released
yesterday, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council (SCLC) noted
that only 13 per cent of under
graduates and 9 per cent of graduate
students are aware of the holdings in
the university honor code, Lyons
noted.
"The history of the honor code is
that it was a student responsibility and
that the student body would foster the
honor code to make students aware of
it. We need a recommitment in order to
see the code survive," Goheen said.
Vic Petroff, ASSU president, said
several attempts will be made to alert
students to the code. He said a full
page ad in the dead week Doily may be
run, which would give the full text of
the code.
Flyers will also be distributed to re
sidences during finals week, he added.
In the future, Petroff said he hopes to
incorporate some type of flier in the
orientation reg packs for freshmen,
transfers, and graduate students. At
tempts are also being made to orient
the faculty with the text of the code
and alert them as to specific honor
code responsibilities, Petroff said.
Faculty violations
"It's possible that faculty may be
more in violation of the honor code
than students or as much so. It is essen
tial that faculty express confidence in
the honor code," Goheen said.

Also discussed was the policy of
signing blue books before examina
tions, in which students promise to
report cheating that they observe.
"I've always felt that signing was a
violation of the code itself. We need to
have a way of keeping this alive, but
signing turns into a contractual obliga
tion rather than a question of honor,"
Gage said.
Another method for upholding the
code and assigning punishments
without administrative intervention
could be a direct confrontation bet
ween classmates, according to Lyons.
