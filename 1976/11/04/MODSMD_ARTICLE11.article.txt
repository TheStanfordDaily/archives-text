# Foley 'dumping' part of larger campaign

Where does the Economics Depart
ment stand today? Asst. Prof. Duncan
Foley is being dumped and the Politi
cal Economy Program is under attack.
Every year for the last five years, the
economics faculty has renewed its at
tack upon the Political Economy Prog
ram.
The program resulted from student
demands for an alternative to estab
lishment economics within the de
partment. Student activism has been
the moving force behind: (a) the only
student-initiated seminar in the de
partment (the Political Economy
Seminar met for a year before being
officially recognized); (b) the de
velopment of the Seminar into the Al
ternative Approaches field; (cjthe hir
ing of Prof. Don Harris (the search

committee that "found" him was es
tablished as the direct result of mass
activity including hundreds of stu
dents and faculty, among them Dun
can Foley); (d) the addition of courses
dealing with Marxism, imperialism,
etc. at the undergraduate level in
itiated and taught by graduate stu
dents.
Coming here with the promise of a
tenure decision within three years.
Foley distinguished himself and his
department with an exemplary per
formance as a teacher, adviser and
theorist able to bridge the gulf between
establishment and Marxist economics.
No one seriously expected that he
would not get tenure; in fact, the fa
culty search committee unanimously
recommended Foley's immediate
promotion to full professor.
But a handful of senior faculty,
under the leadership of Mordecai
Kurz, quietly sabotaged this at the ini
tial faculty meeting in December 1975.
Although tliis decision was met with
massive student opposition and pro
test, the faculty responded by becom
ing increasingly defensive and secre
tive, while those responsible never
stood accountable for their actions.
The Union for Radical Political
Economy (IJRPE) says that the betrayal
of P'oley, his advisees, and all his stu
dents is not simply another chapter in
the history of routine departmental
bunglings.
He is being dumped because he re
fused to join "theclub;" he was willing
to stick his neck out as an untenured
associate professor and actively work
for the hiring of Harris and the forma
tion of the Political Economy Program;
he was bold enough to work on Marx
ist economics as an alternative to the
neo-classical paradigm represented by
the department; he even supported
university workers in their fight for
their union.
If we permit the faction that en
gineered the "lack of action" on
Foley's tenure to succeed, we pay an
awful price. First, we lose Foley. But
even more important, we will suffer
the ensuing rise of political control
and the intimidation of other junior
faculty. We demand immediate tenure
for Foley.
As bad as it is, this political dump
ing bears on more than the depart
ment's treatment of a si ngle individual
or its indifference to student opinion
— it represents the beginning of a re
newed attack on the Political Economy
Program.
IJRPE says that a strategy is being

implicitly employed by a faction
within the faculty who have opposed
this program since its inception.
Today, this is how this strategy ap
pears: 1) isolate political economy fa
culty and students from the rest of the
department. Dumping Foley is a major
step in this direction. 2) limit the prog
ram's access to institutional resources.
3) avoid dealing with any issues criti
cal of establishment economics in the
rest of the department's classes and re
fuse to consider Marxist economists as
candidates for non-political economy
positions.
Political economy faculty, working
in one of the most popular fields in the
department, receive little teaching as
sistant (TA) support; Gurley and Har
ris receive no research assistant sup
port. TAs are generally assigned only
to the introductory neo-classical
courses and are not available to other
large undergraduate courses, includ
ing those in political economy.
Research assistants (RAs), are usu
ally supported by outside grants, a sys
tem that works fine if your research
isn't too critical of the capitalist in
stitutions that generate this funding.
We demand adequate teaching assis
tance for Gurley and Harris and all

large courses in the department. We
demand that the department guarantee
one RA for each professor.
The department's pigeon-holing of
the Political Economy Program and its
faculty forces us to constantly struggle
against this isolation. "Alternative Ap
proaches" is not just a single field; it
stands as an active critique of estab
lished neo-classical analysis in all
fields.
There are only two ways to go for the
future of political economy here —
erosion and eventual dismantling, or
adequate staffing commensurate with
the department's committment we
won over two years ago.
Past performance has shown that
promises of political neutrality and
"openness" are poor substitutes for
concrete action. As a minimum, we
demand that each year the department
commit itself to bringing to Stanford
for full hiring consideration an indi
vidual proposed by the Political
Economy Seminar for each position
being filled.
URPE invites general student par
ticipation and support in this struggle.

activity including hundreds of stu

dealing with Marxism, imperialism,
etc. at the undergraduate level in
itiated and taught by graduate stu
dents.
Coming here with the promise of a
tenure decision within three years.
Foley distinguished himself and his
department with an exemplary per
formance as a teacher, adviser and
theorist able to bridge the gulf between
establishment and Marxist economics.
No one seriously expected that he
would not get tenure; in fact, the fa
culty search committee unanimously
recommended Foley's immediate
promotion to full professor.
But a handful of senior faculty,
under the leadership of Mordecai
Kurz, quietly sabotaged this at the ini
tial faculty meeting in December 1975.
Although tliis decision was met with
massive student opposition and pro
test, the faculty responded by becom
ing increasingly defensive and secre
tive, while those responsible never
stood accountable for their actions.
The Union for Radical Political
Economy (IJRPE) says that the betrayal
of P'oley, his advisees, and all his stu
dents is not simply another chapter in
the history of routine departmental
bunglings.
He is being dumped because he re
fused to join "theclub;" he was willing
to stick his neck out as an untenured
associate professor and actively work
for the hiring of Harris and the forma
tion of the Political Economy Program;
he was bold enough to work on Marx
ist economics as an alternative to the
neo-classical paradigm represented by
the department; he even supported
university workers in their fight for
their union.
If we permit the faction that en
gineered the "lack of action" on
Foley's tenure to succeed, we pay an
awful price. First, we lose Foley. But
even more important, we will suffer
the ensuing rise of political control
and the intimidation of other junior
faculty. We demand immediate tenure
for Foley.
As bad as it is, this political dump
ing bears on more than the depart
ment's treatment of a si ngle individual
or its indifference to student opinion
— it represents the beginning of a re
newed attack on the Political Economy
Program.
IJRPE says that a strategy is being

implicitly employed by a faction
within the faculty who have opposed
this program since its inception.
Today, this is how this strategy ap
pears: 1) isolate political economy fa
culty and students from the rest of the
department. Dumping Foley is a major
step in this direction. 2) limit the prog
ram's access to institutional resources.
3) avoid dealing with any issues criti
cal of establishment economics in the
rest of the department's classes and re
fuse to consider Marxist economists as
candidates for non-political economy
positions.
Political economy faculty, working
in one of the most popular fields in the
department, receive little teaching as
sistant (TA) support; Gurley and Har
ris receive no research assistant sup
port. TAs are generally assigned only
to the introductory neo-classical
courses and are not available to other
large undergraduate courses, includ
ing those in political economy.
Research assistants (RAs), are usu
ally supported by outside grants, a sys
tem that works fine if your research
isn't too critical of the capitalist in
stitutions that generate this funding.
We demand adequate teaching assis
tance for Gurley and Harris and all

large courses in the department. We
demand that the department guarantee
one RA for each professor.
The department's pigeon-holing of
the Political Economy Program and its
faculty forces us to constantly struggle
against this isolation. "Alternative Ap
proaches" is not just a single field; it
stands as an active critique of estab
lished neo-classical analysis in all
fields.
There are only two ways to go for the
future of political economy here —
erosion and eventual dismantling, or
adequate staffing commensurate with
the department's committment we
won over two years ago.
Past performance has shown that
promises of political neutrality and
"openness" are poor substitutes for
concrete action. As a minimum, we
demand that each year the department
commit itself to bringing to Stanford
for full hiring consideration an indi
vidual proposed by the Political
Economy Seminar for each position
being filled.
URPE invites general student par
ticipation and support in this struggle.

under the leadership of Mordecai
Kurz, quietly sabotaged this at the ini
tial faculty meeting in December 1975.
Although tliis decision was met with
massive student opposition and pro
test, the faculty responded by becom
ing increasingly defensive and secre
tive, while those responsible never
stood accountable for their actions.
The Union for Radical Political
Economy (IJRPE) says that the betrayal
of P'oley, his advisees, and all his stu
dents is not simply another chapter in
the history of routine departmental
bunglings.
He is being dumped because he re
fused to join "theclub;" he was willing
to stick his neck out as an untenured
associate professor and actively work
for the hiring of Harris and the forma
tion of the Political Economy Program;
he was bold enough to work on Marx
ist economics as an alternative to the
neo-classical paradigm represented by
the department; he even supported
university workers in their fight for
their union.
If we permit the faction that en
gineered the "lack of action" on
Foley's tenure to succeed, we pay an
awful price. First, we lose Foley. But
even more important, we will suffer
the ensuing rise of political control
and the intimidation of other junior
faculty. We demand immediate tenure
for Foley.
As bad as it is, this political dump
ing bears on more than the depart
ment's treatment of a si ngle individual
or its indifference to student opinion
— it represents the beginning of a re
newed attack on the Political Economy
Program.
IJRPE says that a strategy is being

implicitly employed by a faction
within the faculty who have opposed
this program since its inception.
Today, this is how this strategy ap
pears: 1) isolate political economy fa
culty and students from the rest of the
department. Dumping Foley is a major
step in this direction. 2) limit the prog
ram's access to institutional resources.
3) avoid dealing with any issues criti
cal of establishment economics in the
rest of the department's classes and re
fuse to consider Marxist economists as
candidates for non-political economy
positions.
Political economy faculty, working
in one of the most popular fields in the
department, receive little teaching as
sistant (TA) support; Gurley and Har
ris receive no research assistant sup
port. TAs are generally assigned only
to the introductory neo-classical
courses and are not available to other
large undergraduate courses, includ
ing those in political economy.
Research assistants (RAs), are usu
ally supported by outside grants, a sys
tem that works fine if your research
isn't too critical of the capitalist in
stitutions that generate this funding.
We demand adequate teaching assis
tance for Gurley and Harris and all

large courses in the department. We
demand that the department guarantee
one RA for each professor.
The department's pigeon-holing of
the Political Economy Program and its
faculty forces us to constantly struggle
against this isolation. "Alternative Ap
proaches" is not just a single field; it
stands as an active critique of estab
lished neo-classical analysis in all
fields.
There are only two ways to go for the
future of political economy here —
erosion and eventual dismantling, or
adequate staffing commensurate with
the department's committment we
won over two years ago.
Past performance has shown that
promises of political neutrality and
"openness" are poor substitutes for
concrete action. As a minimum, we
demand that each year the department
commit itself to bringing to Stanford
for full hiring consideration an indi
vidual proposed by the Political
Economy Seminar for each position
being filled.
URPE invites general student par
ticipation and support in this struggle.

Where does the Economics Depart
ment stand today? Asst. Prof. Duncan
Foley is being dumped and the Politi
cal Economy Program is under attack.
Every year for the last five years, the
economics faculty has renewed its at
tack upon the Political Economy Prog
ram.
The program resulted from student
demands for an alternative to estab
lishment economics within the de
partment. Student activism has been
the moving force behind: (a) the only
student-initiated seminar in the de
partment (the Political Economy
Seminar met for a year before being
officially recognized); (b) the de
velopment of the Seminar into the Al
ternative Approaches field; (cjthe hir
ing of Prof. Don Harris (the search

committee that "found" him was es
tablished as the direct result of mass
activity including hundreds of stu
dents and faculty, among them Dun
can Foley); (d) the addition of courses
dealing with Marxism, imperialism,
etc. at the undergraduate level in
itiated and taught by graduate stu
dents.
Coming here with the promise of a
tenure decision within three years.
Foley distinguished himself and his
department with an exemplary per
formance as a teacher, adviser and
theorist able to bridge the gulf between
establishment and Marxist economics.
No one seriously expected that he
would not get tenure; in fact, the fa
culty search committee unanimously
recommended Foley's immediate
promotion to full professor.

under the leadership of Mordecai
Kurz, quietly sabotaged this at the ini
