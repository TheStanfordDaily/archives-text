# Distribution requirements to be made more stringent
## 
### Bob Svikhart 
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Herant Katch
adourian commented on the possibility ot more
stringent distribution requirements when he ap
peared on k/SU's Campus Conference Tuesday
night.
"The concern is," katchadourian said, "it stu
dents are left to their own resources, are they
going to be able to make the right choices?"
The question of increased requirements was
brought to attention in light of a report issued
earlier this week by the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (CUS) which advocates that
Western culture should be a part of every under
graduate's education, but not a formal require
ment.
The Committee on Reform and Renewal of Lib
eral Education at Stanford (CORRLES) made a
more structured porposal in January of 1975 when
it called for required enrollment in one of several
year-long Western Culture sequences.
Katchadourian was also asked to present the
basis on which the university assumes that stu-

dents are not fulfilling a wide diversity of courses
on their own.
He said, "1 don't have any basis and 1 don't
know if anybody else does to my satisfaction."
"The fact that 1 say there is a lack of evidence for
my purposes doesn't mean other faculty members
aren't entitled, on the basis of their experience, to
say that they see a great need for the kind of
(structured) programs that they are pushing for,"
he said.
Katchadourian then went on to outline a two
pronged procedure that his office is implement
ing to obtain the desired information.
First, a department by department survey will
be made to determine the situation in each de
partment. In this practice, close attention will be
paid to the majors that students declare and the
courses that they take.
Also, the registrar and the dean want to look into
students' records (anonymously, according to
Katchadourian) to find out what class choices
students are making and if they are related.
