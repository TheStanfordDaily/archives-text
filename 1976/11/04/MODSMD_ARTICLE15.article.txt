# Device may destroy cancer

A Palo Alto inventor may have
developed a machine that pain
lessly destroys some cancer
tumors while leaving healthy
surrounding tissue intact.
Wilfrid Whalley, 67, who
holds degrees in applied science
and engineering physics from
the University ot Toronto, said

in his system, a cancer tumor is
placed between positive and
negative electric plates forming
an electric capacitor. This allows
a radio frequency current to flow
through the tumor heating and
killing the malignant cells, he
claimed.
Malignant tumors tend to have
worse circulation than healthy

surrounding tissues, Whalley
pointed out.
"Whenever there is a zone
where the internal circulation is
poor compared to the normal
surrounding tissue, as the
radiofrequency current flows
through it, it becomes consider
ably hotter, to the point where it
kills the malignant cells."
The same process can also be
used for treating pilonidal cysts,
a painful condition also charac
terized by zones of decreased
circulation. Whalley said.
Nice for mice
George Hahn, an adjunct pro
fessor of radiology at the Medi
cal Center here and co-author of
a paper based on work with
Whalley's system said, however,
that while 100 per cent cure rates
are possible for antigenic tumors
in mice, "tumor irradiation in
mice is based on certain immune
effects that are not likely to be
equally operative in humans."
Hahn has conducted experi
ments only on mice, dogs and
rats using the system.
Hahn also noted that similar
devices and methods of cancer
treatment had been used by
other researchers previously, in

eluding .1 researcher at l.os
Alamos Scientific Labs.
While H.ilm agreed that the
treatment was particularly effec
tive in mice against certain
cancer cells and "in dogs and
cats occasionally, the impres
sion he (Whalley) gives that all
tumors just melt away is more
fantasy than fact."
System explained
Whalley developed the system
in 1W74 and has since built six
separate systems. Two .ire being
used .it the Veterans Administra
tion Hospital in Brooklyn, N.Y.
three are being used by Hahn in
the radiobiologv research de
partment here, and another sys
tem is located i 11 Newcastle, Kng
land.
The system costs around
$20,000 and uses 500 watts of
electricity. At current power
rates, the half-hour treatment
that Whalley said is required
to eliminate malignancies costs
around half a cent.
After the tumor has been
heated to 111.2 degrees
Karenheit and destroyed, natural
processes of the body filter out
and eliminate the dead cancer
cells, Whalley said.
