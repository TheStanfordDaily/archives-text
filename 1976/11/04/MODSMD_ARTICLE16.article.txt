There is <j mail box at the corner of Lomita and
Panama Streets. The mail box has no posted times
for pick-up. It is painted all blue, and there is no
written indication that it is in operation or that it
belongs to the Postal Service. What's the story?
-J.F.W.E.
Since that mail box is just around the corner
from the Daily, I decided to truck on down there
m'self for a "look see." You're right, there are no
pick-up times posted, and it is painted all blue.
But on either side, in glorious bicentennial color,
are the words "U.S. .Mail."
The Post Office confirms that the box is their
baby, and 1 heard it through the grapevine (mean
ing Postman Daniel Riley who, in turn, talked to
Supervisor Richard kilby) that the mail is picked
up from there once a day.
As for the sign with the pick-up times, well,
Riley says "somebody probably took it." 1 le says a
mail collector will most likely put up a new one
some time this week.
Meanwhile, rest assured that those letters you
dropped in there months ago are not molding at
the bottom of the bin. I've talked to several stu
dents who have used that drop spot, and whose
letters were faithfully delivered.
My roommate and I have a bet of one six-pack of
the finest. Please tell us the maximum attainable
flight speed of a common housefly. I said that it
was around 30 mph, and my roommate said ten.
Anything above 20 wins for me, so don't let me
down.
-Egoon and Putgoon

I'm afraid our "Resident Bug Man' Ward Watt
says 30 mph for a housefly is "an overestimate.'
HOWEVER, breathe a sigh of relief, and cash in on
the free brew because Watt says the maximum
flight speed is "roughly around 20 mph.
Just for the record, Watt says flies can only keep
up this speed for a very short period of time. I or
example, "you wouldn't see one zipping over the
Berkeley" at 20 mph.
How does one go about obtaining a live, preda
cious diving beetle? I've heard you can order them
live from some place in South Carolina, but I
didn't know who to write to. I have a friend who
really likes them and I would like to get him one to
put in an aquarium for Christmas.
-L.M.
Again, 1 bugged Professor Ward Watt, who says
there are a variety of biological supply houses that
you can get in touch with through the university's
Purchasing Department.
"You might have some trouble getting them,"
says Watt, because California is rather nasty about
getting insects in. "They'reafraid(you'll)drop one
and start a plague, or something," he said.
Most of the people at the Purchasing Depart
ment that I talked to were a bit skeptical about
ordering that particular little beastie. "We deal in
crickets, frogs, and grasshoppers," said Bob
Peterson, and added that they've never had the
occasion to order a diving beetle.
If you don't haveany luck with purchasing, you
may try fishing under rocks, since Watt says giant
water bugs are actually native to the state.
