# Rick Nelson: grown up at last
## 
### Lyndon Stambler Richard Waldow 
As on The Ozzie and Harriet
Show Kick Nelson takes the
stage accompanied by screams
from the audience. To look at his
face, you'd swear that this was
the Kicky Nelson of TV, circa
1957, with the same shy smile
and smooth voice, doing his
number at the end of the show.
But looks are deceiving.
This is 1976, Kick Nelson is
36, and he's changed. He's come
to terms with the past but he
lives in the present. At the Brew

ery in San Jose recently, he pre
viewed his new album, and
talked about himself and his
career.
In fact, the concert was like a
tug-of-war between the old and
the new. Most of the audience,
those weaned on Ozzie and Har
riet (or reruns) along with a
sprinkling of fortyish house
wives, obviously had come to
hear the old material. And they
got what they came for — Truve
lin' Man, Lonesome Town,
Hello Mary Lou. This was the
emotional high point of the con

cert, accompanied by screams,
and it was hard not to get ex
cited. Besides being catchy, the
songs are so familiar as to be rock
classics. Hearing Kick Nelson
sing them gives one a sense of
his stature in rock history.
But the juxtaposition of his
1971 hit Garden Party directly
after the oldies medley illus
trates Kick Nelson's struggle to
grow artistically and live in the
present while not denying his
past as a teenage idol. The song
grew out of his experience ap
pearing at a rock 'n roll revival
concert in Madison Square Gar
den that he really didn't want to
do. Playing his old songs made
him feel that he wasn't progres
sing musically.
'Oldie' image
But he understands his
"oldie" image and reserves part
of his concerts for the old songs.
The bulk of the concert show
cased the new direction which
Nelson is taking and which will
comprise his Epic album,
scheduled for a January release.
His last change in direction
led him to winning form. He
scored a string of early 70's hits
in a Dylan-folk-rock vein. In a
live album recorded at The Los
Angeles Troubadour he per
formed such Dylan songs as /
Shall lie Released, She Belongs
to Me, and Love Minus Zero/No
Limit. His soft, country-tinged
arrangements and smooth deliv
ery showed his ability to inter
pret such material with insight
and feeling. His own writing of
the time, songs such as Easy to
He Free and One Night Stand in
New York City displayed his
maturation as a lyricist as com
pared to his Hello, Mary Lou
days.
Indeed, Kick Nelson's career
and life ought to provide in
teresting lyrical material. Hav
ing lived through and changed
with rock since its earliest days,
through the stormy sixties to to
day, he has a unique vantage
point. His very musical survival
should have wrought unique in

sights into fame, success, and an
artist's struggle to create and to
maintain his integrity against
the shifting trends of public
acclaim.
A disappointment
But, his new material is
somewhat of a disappointment.
The band is tight, the arrange
ments professional, the songs
pleasant and even catchy. But.
given the backdrop of Nelson's
accomplishments and promise
of five years previous, one can't
help feeling somewhat disap
pointed.
Some of his new songs are
well-crafted, even touching,
such as On Dreams Alone,
which featured Nelson on piano.
This song is introspective and
tastefully arranged. Others, such
as You Can't Dance and Some
thing You Can't Buy, are catchy
tunes with AM potential, but the
rest seemed to blend together in
their predictability.

And his goals as an artist? A
Number One Hit? A huge follow
ing? In a dressing room inter
view Rick Nelson leans back and
ponders a moment before re
sponding. We study bis band
some face and see not a 18-year
old sensation but a mature, sea
soned man of :Ui, a veteran of
20 years of touring. Now he
looks at us intently.
"1 try to set higher standards,
not goals . . . I'm just trying to
get better and better — in my
singing, in playing electric
guitar. This is a new thing for me
— to hear each note to know it
has to be right. You could never
hear the acoustic
guitar . . . When I was starting
out, it was in front of 20,000
people at a state fair..."
He continued wistfully, "They
put a guitar in my hands and I
just strummed chords. This is a
challenge."
