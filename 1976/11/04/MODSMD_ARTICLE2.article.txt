For Jimmy Carter — who savored
victory — and President Ford — who
conceded it — the 1976 presidential
election was over yesterday. But the
numbers game still continues.
First was the issue of the absentee
ballots. A few remained uncounted
yesterday afternoon, although officials
in more than half the 50 states said the
absentees either had been tallied or
could not have any effect on the out
come.
Second was the closeness of a few
key races. What if . . . .?
Carter's margin in the nationwide
popular vote and in the electoral col
lege was clear if close. But the electoral
tally — and that's the one that counts
— could have gone the other way if
less than 25,000 voters in the right
states had supported Ford instead of
Carter.
Here's how:
As of early yesterday afternoon, with
almost all the votes counted, Carter led

Ford by 1.7 million votes or 3 per cent
in the popular vote. He had 272 elec
toral votes — two more than needed —
to Ford's 235.
Ohio and Oregon remained too close
to call. Carter was leading in Ohio and
Ford in Oregon. But Carter's Ohio lead
was less than 8000 and Ford's Oregon
lead was less than 1000 votes. Assume
9000 voters had gone the other way.
That would put Ohio, with 25 electoral
votes, and Oregon, with 6. in the Ford
column, giving him a total of 266.
Next take two other states in the Car
ter column — Mississippi and Hawaii
— where the Democrat's margin of vic
tory was less than 10,000 votes. The
actual number of votes separating the
two was smallest in Hawaii — a scant
7000. If those voters also had gone for
Ford instead of Carter, they would
have added 4 electoral votes to the
president's total — giving him a
victory-clinching 270 — and sub
tracted four from Carter — leaving him
a loser at 268.
