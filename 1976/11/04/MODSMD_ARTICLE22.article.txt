# Pirates steal their way into hearts
## 
### Dean Eyre 
The 1976-1977 season of the
Stanford Savoyards got off to a
fine start last Friday night with
the opening performance of The
Pirates of Penzance.
The Gilbert and Sull ivan two
act opera went very smoothly for
a first night showing, especially
considering the relatively short
span of time between the begin
ning of school and the downbeat
of Sullivan's score at 8:05. This
is a credit to the work of pro
ducer Rita Taylor, director Lindi
Bauman, and assistant director
Robert Wildman.
The thirty-five piece orchestra
which signalled the com
mencement of the opera was ex
cellent under the conducting
and direction of David Babbs.
The main characters of the
production portrayed their parts
very well. Frederic, the "Slave of
Duty" was played by Gerald
Moshell. As the pirate appren

tice, Moshell displayed good
all-around abilities in singing
and acting. The part offered him
an opportunity to sing some of
the very fine operatic solos and
duets written by Sullivan.
Ella Asbury Harsin, playing
the role of Frederic's nursemaid
Ruth, took advantage of the part
to show some very good singing
abilities.
Pirate King
The Pirate King was very ably
performed by Peter Vilkin, who
was a believable but soft-hearted
villain of the seas. This part was
well-cast, for with the help of
fine costuming, Vilkin truly re
sembled a pirate king. He gave a
fine performance dramatically,
but should project his talented
bass voice more towards the au
dience.
Dan Robinson, as Major-
General Stanley, did a fine job of
acting out his role as a noble but
meek gentleman of rank. Robin

sun gave a fine overall rendition
of the Major-General, but needs
to project his singing toward
maintaining a balance of sound
with the orchestra.
Mabel, the girl who falls in
love with Frederic, was beauti
fully portrayed by Bonnie Lan
field. Lanfield showed a great
versatility as a singer, playing
the character of Mabel in a comi
cal sense. The well-written voice
part can be either sung seriously
or in a humorous vein; Lanfield
handled the latter in a fine
manner.
Fine costumes
Much credit should go to Ma
rian Colwell, costume designer
for the production, for a fine col
lection of costumes which
helped to highlight the charac
ters. The wardrobes for the
wards of the Major-General and
the pirates were especially effec
tive in adding to the atmosphere
of the production.

Credit is due to technical di-.
rector lan Kirkbrideand lighting
designer Wendy Ueffner for'
their fine jobs in the technicalj
portion of the stage presentation.?
Choreographer Ann Hawkes
should be congratulated for fine'
direction especially in the work
with the Major-General's wards.
The set design and properties,
were effective, particularly in
the second act during which the
ruined chapel is the background.
However, the first act, portray-,
ing the Coast of Cornwall's rocky'
seashore needed to he a bit more
convincing, literally in terms of
"setting the stage" for the pi
rates. The elements of piracy and
the ocean should be emphasized;
to creafe the atmosphere of this
scene in the minds of the audi
ence.
Delicate balance
The only overall problem
which was noticeable in the per
formance was that of maintain
ing the delicate balance between
the various singers onstage and
the orchestra. At several pointy
in the presentation, specifically
when there was a chorus and
either the Major-General or ths
Firate King singing at the same
time, the orchestra and chorus
sound levels tended to over-;
power the featured singers.
Other than this one problem,
the production was excellent,
and since experience is the best
teacher, the successive shows
should allow the cast and crew
to get used to working together
in front of an audience.
If you haven't seen the produc
tion yet. you have two more op
portunities to see this Savoyard
project â€” November 6 at 2 p.m.
and November 7 at 8 p.m. 1
would recommend seeing Fi
rntes of Penzance both to the ex
perienced Gilbert and Sullivan
fan and the novice alike, for it is
one of the most popular operafc
bv the British team.
