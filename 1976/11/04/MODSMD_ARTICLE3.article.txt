# Campus pub future in doubt

Discussion on establishing a pub in Tresidder Union
has been put off for the present time, leaving financial and
access considerations unresolved, according to Dan Wil
liams, associate dean of students and director of Tresidder
Union. However, Williams said that he is organizing a
group of students and faculty to further discuss the feasi
bility of a pub and work out a possible solution.
ASSU President Vic Petroff said he is confident the
group can work out a solution.
Williams explained the main problem is that the license
for the proposed pub "would prohibit a significant per
centage of the students from using the pub."
According to Hob Caselli, director of Tressider food
services, the pub license (type 61) secured from the Al
coholic Beverage Commission by the food service last year
restricts anyone under 21 years of age from entering the
facility. Also, beer would be the only alcoholic beverage
that could be sold, he said.
Williams said the pub's purpose is "not to serve beer,
but to get people together. Heer was only a vehicle."

The other reason for tabling discussion on the pub is a
question of its financial feasibility, said Williams. "The
financial feasibility would be marginal — no disadvan
tage or advantage financially," he said.
"I have no objection to a pub; it's just that everybody
couldn't use the facility," Williams commented.
"The university wants the pub," according to Petroff.
The idea of a pub originated three years ago when Tre
sidder was in financial straights, according to Williams.
"The ASSU put much work into it, though they were not
too serious until 18 months ago."
Last year, a license was obtained and a location for the
pub was selected. Williams said the pinball room seemed
a logical location then because pinballs were not too
popular. However, because of the pinballs' increased
popularity, the pinballs would have to be relocated rather
than discarded, he said. Williams said this would create
another financial burden.
Presently, no meeting has been scheduled to discuss the
pub. Williams said. "We will pursue the matter, but there
is no great urgency."
