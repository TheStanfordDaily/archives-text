Pocketbook tops voter concerns
New York — The national agenda of voters
who elected Jimmy Carter is dominated by poc
ketbook concerns which mirror the strengths of
the next president's campaign themes.
An Associated Press nationwide election day
poll asked voters to identify the one or two is
sues of most concern to them personally.
Slightly more than 41 per cent of those who
voted for Carter cited jobs and unemployment.
Just under 41 per cent named inflation and
high prices and 17 per cent said tax reform.
The only noneconomic concern pushing into
this top rank was trust in government, cited by
19 per cent of Carter voters and another princi
pal thrust of his campaign against President
Ford.
Voters who backed President Gerald Ford also
showed purse-string priorities, but from a differ
ent perspective. Inflation and high prices top
ped their list, mentioned by 39 per cent. Gov
ernment spending was second at 25 per cent and
jobsand unemployment was third at 22 percent.
Trust in government was a principal concern
of 17 per cent and 1 5 per cent listed tax reform.
Ford pitched part of his campaign strongly on
his leadership experience in foreign affairs, but
only one in five of his supporters listed any of
the defense or foreign issues as preeminent in
their concerns.
The poll, conducted at 100 scientifically
selected voting locations across the country, in
dicated, however, that voters are less than cer
tain about what kind of performance they'll get
from Carter on these issues.
The poll showed that Carter built his 51 per
cent popular vote edge from traditional Democ
ratic blocs, including overwhelming black sup
port, dominance among labor union families,
and strength among lower-income and less
educated voters. He also was strongest with
younger voters.
Among black poll respondents. Carter was the
favorite of a massive 94 per cent, a dominance
nearly 20 points greater than Democratic con
gressional candidates achieved among blacks.
Voters evaluate state propositions
Los Angeles — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said
yesterday that he hopes a "spirit of cooperation"
will evolve from the heated arguments over the
defeated farm labor initiative.
The measure, Prop. 14. was defeated 3-2 by
voters in Tuesday's general election, at the same
time another Brown administration proposal —

$500 million in housing bonds — was rejected.
On other key propositions, voters defeated
measures legalizing greyhound race betting,
funding low-interest solar heating loans and al
lowing firms to pay higher interest rates on some
business loans.
Voters also approved a $280 million park
bond measure that included funds for coastal
acquisitions.
On other measures, voters:
—Approved Prop. 7 by a landslideB3 percent.
It revamps the state commission overseeing jud
icial performance in the state, and makes it
easier to censure or even fire a judge.
—Approved Prop. 4, which allows the legisla
ture to require the University of Calitornia to put
projects up for competitive bidding.
—Rejected Prop. 6, which would have given
the governor more time to consider bills after the
first year of a two-year legislative session.
State Demos gain seats in House
Los Angeles — The election in which Califor
nia Republicans hoped to recover some of their
post-Watergate congressional losses turned out
to be another year of gain for Democrats.
The number of seats held by the GOP dropped
to 14 Tuesday as a veteran Republican incum
bent went down to defeat and a Democrat scar
red by a sex scandal and a bribery probe held on
to win.
Altogether, Democrats gained one seat, bring
ing their total to 29. They added four seats two
years in the wake of Watergate.
Nation votes on diverse initiatives
Washington — The following are the results
of dozens of initiatives on various state ballots
around the country in Tuesday's election.
The measure to suffer the most resounding
defeat was that to limit the growth of nuclear
power plants by imposing strict safety stan
dards. Such a proposal was turned down hand
ily in Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Ohio, Ore
gon and Washington.
The measures were mostly patterned on a
California plan that was defeated by the voters in
June. While differing in detail, they generally
would have required that nuclear facilities be
proved safe by equipment testing before they
may be built or operated.
The nuclear and electric utility industries
spent heavily to defeat the six measures on the
ballot Tuesday. In Ohio alone, their budget was
$1 million — 25 times the funds available to

supporters, who were largely from environmen
tal or consumer groups.
Opponents had said the measures would, in
effect, ban further nuclear power development
and could lead to electricity shortages.
A measure to ban the sale of handguns fared
little better. It was defeated by a more than 2-to-l
margin in Massachusetts, which was believed to
be the first state with a referenda on such a mea
sure.
The measure would have required owners to
turn in handguns for reimbursement by the
state, with the total cost estimated at $50 million
to $125 million.
New Jersey citizens voted, meanwhile, to
allow legal casino gambling in the state's best
known resort, Atlantic City, known mostly in
recent years as the home of the Miss America
pageant.
Proponents of the measure had maintained it
would restore the resort to the days when it was
visited by wealthy New Yorkers and Philadelp
hians a half-century ago, an era when it was
known for its night life, including illegal gambl
ing and before air travel made other resort areas
more accessible.
And in Maine and Michigan, voters accepted
proposals to require deposit beverage bottles.
Similar measures met defeat in Colorado and
Massachusetts.
The measures were based on an Oregon law
adopted four years ago that bans sale of no
deposit bottles and pull-top cans. It too met
heavy opposition from industry and labor
groups who maintained it would do little to
solve the problem it was intended for — litter —
and would raise prices on soft drinks and beer.
Other states also voted on gambling measures
Tuesday. Georgia voters approved a constitu
tional amendment legalizing nonprofit bingo
games, Vermonters voted to ask the state legisla
ture to approve a state-run lottery and Colorado
voters approved a state sweepstakes.
However, a nonbinding measure on allowing
up to six gambling casinos in Detroit was de
feated, a proposal to legalize greyhound racing
lost in California and a measure to allow slot
machines was rejected in Delaware.
Referenda in other states included:
—Michigan voters turned down proposals to
limit state spending and taxes, permit a
graduated income tax and lower the minimum
age for state legislators from 28 to 21.

—Alaska citizens voted to move the state capi
tal to Willow, about 70 miles from Anchorage.
The present capital, at Juneau, is tar from the
state's most populous areas.
—In Colorado, voters turned down a measure
that would have required a majority of residents
to approve any increase in state or local govern
ment spending.
—Oklahomans rejected a proposed constitu
tional amendment to permit sale of liquor by the
drink.
Ford, Hayakawa races tight in state
Los Angeles — Californians gave 45 electoral
votes to President Gerald Ford yesterday in a
cliff hanger that didn't matter, and they elected
70-year-old Republican S.l. Hayakawa to replace
Democrat John Tunney in the U.S. Senate.
Both the presidential and Senate races were
close throughout a long count that wasn't com
pleted until noon yesterday.
In final unofficial returns, Ford defeated Gar
ter by 127,685 votes or 1.7 per cent, ,H.:i:ir> to
3,708,650.
Hayakawa defeated Tunney 3,700,386 to
3,473,433, a 50-47 per cent margin.
Libertarian Roger Macßride received 55,582
votes, followed by American Independent party
nominee Lester Maddox, 50,559; Peace and
Freedom nominee Margaret Wright, 41,616; in
dependent Peter Camejo, 17,08:t, and indepen
dent (lus Hall. 12,791.
Write-in votes for independent Eugene
McCarthy were not counted in the unofficial
canvass.
Carter locked up the election nationwide
hours before Ford overcame the Democratic
candidate's early lead and forged ahead for good
on returns from the affluent Republican suburbs
from Santa Ana and San Clemente to San Diego
on the Southern California coast.
Ford carried California in the face of a 3-2
Democratic majority with a big assist from the
grassroots political organization that former
Gov. Ronald Reagan turned over to Ford after
Reagan lost the GOP nomination to Ford.

Pocketbook tops voter concerns
New York — The national agenda of voters
who elected Jimmy Carter is dominated by poc
ketbook concerns which mirror the strengths of
the next president's campaign themes.
An Associated Press nationwide election day
poll asked voters to identify the one or two is
sues of most concern to them personally.
Slightly more than 41 per cent of those who
voted for Carter cited jobs and unemployment.
Just under 41 per cent named inflation and
high prices and 17 per cent said tax reform.
The only noneconomic concern pushing into
this top rank was trust in government, cited by
19 per cent of Carter voters and another princi
pal thrust of his campaign against President
Ford.
Voters who backed President Gerald Ford also
showed purse-string priorities, but from a differ
ent perspective. Inflation and high prices top
ped their list, mentioned by 39 per cent. Gov
ernment spending was second at 25 per cent and
jobsand unemployment was third at 22 percent.
Trust in government was a principal concern
of 17 per cent and 1 5 per cent listed tax reform.
Ford pitched part of his campaign strongly on
his leadership experience in foreign affairs, but
only one in five of his supporters listed any of
the defense or foreign issues as preeminent in
their concerns.
The poll, conducted at 100 scientifically
selected voting locations across the country, in
dicated, however, that voters are less than cer
tain about what kind of performance they'll get
from Carter on these issues.
The poll showed that Carter built his 51 per
cent popular vote edge from traditional Democ
ratic blocs, including overwhelming black sup
port, dominance among labor union families,
and strength among lower-income and less
educated voters. He also was strongest with
younger voters.
Among black poll respondents. Carter was the
favorite of a massive 94 per cent, a dominance
nearly 20 points greater than Democratic con
gressional candidates achieved among blacks.
Voters evaluate state propositions
Los Angeles — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said
yesterday that he hopes a "spirit of cooperation"
will evolve from the heated arguments over the
defeated farm labor initiative.
The measure, Prop. 14. was defeated 3-2 by
voters in Tuesday's general election, at the same
time another Brown administration proposal —

$500 million in housing bonds — was rejected.
On other key propositions, voters defeated
measures legalizing greyhound race betting,
funding low-interest solar heating loans and al
lowing firms to pay higher interest rates on some
business loans.
Voters also approved a $280 million park
bond measure that included funds for coastal
acquisitions.
On other measures, voters:
—Approved Prop. 7 by a landslideB3 percent.
It revamps the state commission overseeing jud
icial performance in the state, and makes it
easier to censure or even fire a judge.
—Approved Prop. 4, which allows the legisla
ture to require the University of Calitornia to put
projects up for competitive bidding.
—Rejected Prop. 6, which would have given
the governor more time to consider bills after the
first year of a two-year legislative session.
State Demos gain seats in House
Los Angeles — The election in which Califor
nia Republicans hoped to recover some of their
post-Watergate congressional losses turned out
to be another year of gain for Democrats.
The number of seats held by the GOP dropped
to 14 Tuesday as a veteran Republican incum
bent went down to defeat and a Democrat scar
red by a sex scandal and a bribery probe held on
to win.
Altogether, Democrats gained one seat, bring
ing their total to 29. They added four seats two
years in the wake of Watergate.
Nation votes on diverse initiatives
Washington — The following are the results
of dozens of initiatives on various state ballots
around the country in Tuesday's election.
The measure to suffer the most resounding
defeat was that to limit the growth of nuclear
power plants by imposing strict safety stan
dards. Such a proposal was turned down hand
ily in Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Ohio, Ore
gon and Washington.
The measures were mostly patterned on a
California plan that was defeated by the voters in
June. While differing in detail, they generally
would have required that nuclear facilities be
proved safe by equipment testing before they
may be built or operated.
The nuclear and electric utility industries
spent heavily to defeat the six measures on the
ballot Tuesday. In Ohio alone, their budget was
$1 million — 25 times the funds available to

supporters, who were largely from environmen
tal or consumer groups.
Opponents had said the measures would, in
effect, ban further nuclear power development
and could lead to electricity shortages.
A measure to ban the sale of handguns fared
little better. It was defeated by a more than 2-to-l
margin in Massachusetts, which was believed to
be the first state with a referenda on such a mea
sure.
The measure would have required owners to
turn in handguns for reimbursement by the
state, with the total cost estimated at $50 million
to $125 million.
New Jersey citizens voted, meanwhile, to
allow legal casino gambling in the state's best
known resort, Atlantic City, known mostly in
recent years as the home of the Miss America
pageant.
Proponents of the measure had maintained it
would restore the resort to the days when it was
visited by wealthy New Yorkers and Philadelp
hians a half-century ago, an era when it was
known for its night life, including illegal gambl
ing and before air travel made other resort areas
more accessible.
And in Maine and Michigan, voters accepted
proposals to require deposit beverage bottles.

Voters evaluate state propositions
Los Angeles — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said
yesterday that he hopes a "spirit of cooperation"
will evolve from the heated arguments over the
defeated farm labor initiative.
The measure, Prop. 14. was defeated 3-2 by
voters in Tuesday's general election, at the same
time another Brown administration proposal —

$500 million in housing bonds — was rejected.
On other key propositions, voters defeated
measures legalizing greyhound race betting,
funding low-interest solar heating loans and al
lowing firms to pay higher interest rates on some
business loans.
Voters also approved a $280 million park
bond measure that included funds for coastal
acquisitions.
On other measures, voters:
—Approved Prop. 7 by a landslideB3 percent.
It revamps the state commission overseeing jud
icial performance in the state, and makes it
easier to censure or even fire a judge.
—Approved Prop. 4, which allows the legisla
ture to require the University of Calitornia to put
projects up for competitive bidding.
—Rejected Prop. 6, which would have given
the governor more time to consider bills after the
first year of a two-year legislative session.
State Demos gain seats in House
Los Angeles — The election in which Califor
nia Republicans hoped to recover some of their
post-Watergate congressional losses turned out
to be another year of gain for Democrats.
The number of seats held by the GOP dropped
to 14 Tuesday as a veteran Republican incum
bent went down to defeat and a Democrat scar
red by a sex scandal and a bribery probe held on
to win.
Altogether, Democrats gained one seat, bring
ing their total to 29. They added four seats two
years in the wake of Watergate.
Nation votes on diverse initiatives
Washington — The following are the results
of dozens of initiatives on various state ballots
around the country in Tuesday's election.
The measure to suffer the most resounding
defeat was that to limit the growth of nuclear
power plants by imposing strict safety stan
dards. Such a proposal was turned down hand
ily in Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Ohio, Ore
gon and Washington.
The measures were mostly patterned on a
California plan that was defeated by the voters in
June. While differing in detail, they generally
would have required that nuclear facilities be
proved safe by equipment testing before they
may be built or operated.
The nuclear and electric utility industries
spent heavily to defeat the six measures on the
ballot Tuesday. In Ohio alone, their budget was
$1 million — 25 times the funds available to

supporters, who were largely from environmen
tal or consumer groups.
Opponents had said the measures would, in
effect, ban further nuclear power development
and could lead to electricity shortages.
A measure to ban the sale of handguns fared
little better. It was defeated by a more than 2-to-l
margin in Massachusetts, which was believed to
be the first state with a referenda on such a mea
sure.
The measure would have required owners to
turn in handguns for reimbursement by the
state, with the total cost estimated at $50 million
to $125 million.
New Jersey citizens voted, meanwhile, to
allow legal casino gambling in the state's best
known resort, Atlantic City, known mostly in
recent years as the home of the Miss America
pageant.
Proponents of the measure had maintained it
would restore the resort to the days when it was
visited by wealthy New Yorkers and Philadelp
hians a half-century ago, an era when it was
known for its night life, including illegal gambl
ing and before air travel made other resort areas
more accessible.
And in Maine and Michigan, voters accepted
proposals to require deposit beverage bottles.
Similar measures met defeat in Colorado and
Massachusetts.
The measures were based on an Oregon law
adopted four years ago that bans sale of no
deposit bottles and pull-top cans. It too met
heavy opposition from industry and labor
groups who maintained it would do little to
solve the problem it was intended for — litter —
and would raise prices on soft drinks and beer.
Other states also voted on gambling measures
Tuesday. Georgia voters approved a constitu
tional amendment legalizing nonprofit bingo
games, Vermonters voted to ask the state legisla
ture to approve a state-run lottery and Colorado
voters approved a state sweepstakes.
However, a nonbinding measure on allowing
up to six gambling casinos in Detroit was de
feated, a proposal to legalize greyhound racing
lost in California and a measure to allow slot
machines was rejected in Delaware.
Referenda in other states included:
—Michigan voters turned down proposals to
limit state spending and taxes, permit a
graduated income tax and lower the minimum
age for state legislators from 28 to 21.

—Alaska citizens voted to move the state capi
tal to Willow, about 70 miles from Anchorage.
The present capital, at Juneau, is tar from the
state's most populous areas.
—In Colorado, voters turned down a measure
that would have required a majority of residents
to approve any increase in state or local govern
ment spending.
—Oklahomans rejected a proposed constitu
tional amendment to permit sale of liquor by the
drink.
Ford, Hayakawa races tight in state
Los Angeles — Californians gave 45 electoral
votes to President Gerald Ford yesterday in a
cliff hanger that didn't matter, and they elected
70-year-old Republican S.l. Hayakawa to replace
Democrat John Tunney in the U.S. Senate.
Both the presidential and Senate races were
close throughout a long count that wasn't com
pleted until noon yesterday.
In final unofficial returns, Ford defeated Gar
ter by 127,685 votes or 1.7 per cent, ,H.:i:ir> to
3,708,650.
Hayakawa defeated Tunney 3,700,386 to
3,473,433, a 50-47 per cent margin.
Libertarian Roger Macßride received 55,582
votes, followed by American Independent party
nominee Lester Maddox, 50,559; Peace and
Freedom nominee Margaret Wright, 41,616; in
dependent Peter Camejo, 17,08:t, and indepen
dent (lus Hall. 12,791.
Write-in votes for independent Eugene
McCarthy were not counted in the unofficial
canvass.
Carter locked up the election nationwide
hours before Ford overcame the Democratic
candidate's early lead and forged ahead for good
on returns from the affluent Republican suburbs
from Santa Ana and San Clemente to San Diego
on the Southern California coast.
Ford carried California in the face of a 3-2
Democratic majority with a big assist from the
grassroots political organization that former
Gov. Ronald Reagan turned over to Ford after
Reagan lost the GOP nomination to Ford.

Pocketbook tops voter concerns
New York — The national agenda of voters
who elected Jimmy Carter is dominated by poc
ketbook concerns which mirror the strengths of
the next president's campaign themes.
An Associated Press nationwide election day
poll asked voters to identify the one or two is
sues of most concern to them personally.
Slightly more than 41 per cent of those who
voted for Carter cited jobs and unemployment.
Just under 41 per cent named inflation and
high prices and 17 per cent said tax reform.
The only noneconomic concern pushing into
this top rank was trust in government, cited by
19 per cent of Carter voters and another princi
pal thrust of his campaign against President
Ford.
Voters who backed President Gerald Ford also
showed purse-string priorities, but from a differ
ent perspective. Inflation and high prices top
ped their list, mentioned by 39 per cent. Gov
ernment spending was second at 25 per cent and
jobsand unemployment was third at 22 percent.
Trust in government was a principal concern
of 17 per cent and 1 5 per cent listed tax reform.
Ford pitched part of his campaign strongly on
his leadership experience in foreign affairs, but
only one in five of his supporters listed any of
the defense or foreign issues as preeminent in
their concerns.
The poll, conducted at 100 scientifically
selected voting locations across the country, in
dicated, however, that voters are less than cer
tain about what kind of performance they'll get
from Carter on these issues.
The poll showed that Carter built his 51 per
cent popular vote edge from traditional Democ
ratic blocs, including overwhelming black sup
port, dominance among labor union families,
and strength among lower-income and less
educated voters. He also was strongest with
younger voters.
Among black poll respondents. Carter was the
favorite of a massive 94 per cent, a dominance
nearly 20 points greater than Democratic con

Pocketbook tops voter concerns
New York — The national agenda of voters
who elected Jimmy Carter is dominated by poc
ketbook concerns which mirror the strengths of
the next president's campaign themes.
An Associated Press nationwide election day
poll asked voters to identify the one or two is
sues of most concern to them personally.
Slightly more than 41 per cent of those who
voted for Carter cited jobs and unemployment.
Just under 41 per cent named inflation and
high prices and 17 per cent said tax reform.
The only noneconomic concern pushing into
this top rank was trust in government, cited by
19 per cent of Carter voters and another princi
pal thrust of his campaign against President
Ford.
Voters who backed President Gerald Ford also
showed purse-string priorities, but from a differ
ent perspective. Inflation and high prices top
ped their list, mentioned by 39 per cent. Gov
ernment spending was second at 25 per cent and
jobsand unemployment was third at 22 percent.
Trust in government was a principal concern
of 17 per cent and 1 5 per cent listed tax reform.
Ford pitched part of his campaign strongly on
his leadership experience in foreign affairs, but
only one in five of his supporters listed any of
the defense or foreign issues as preeminent in
their concerns.
The poll, conducted at 100 scientifically
selected voting locations across the country, in
dicated, however, that voters are less than cer
tain about what kind of performance they'll get
from Carter on these issues.
The poll showed that Carter built his 51 per
cent popular vote edge from traditional Democ
ratic blocs, including overwhelming black sup
port, dominance among labor union families,
and strength among lower-income and less
educated voters. He also was strongest with
younger voters.
Among black poll respondents. Carter was the
favorite of a massive 94 per cent, a dominance
nearly 20 points greater than Democratic con
gressional candidates achieved among blacks.
Voters evaluate state propositions
Los Angeles — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said
yesterday that he hopes a "spirit of cooperation"
will evolve from the heated arguments over the
defeated farm labor initiative.
The measure, Prop. 14. was defeated 3-2 by
voters in Tuesday's general election, at the same
time another Brown administration proposal —

$500 million in housing bonds — was rejected.
On other key propositions, voters defeated
measures legalizing greyhound race betting,
funding low-interest solar heating loans and al
lowing firms to pay higher interest rates on some
business loans.
Voters also approved a $280 million park
bond measure that included funds for coastal
acquisitions.
On other measures, voters:
—Approved Prop. 7 by a landslideB3 percent.
It revamps the state commission overseeing jud
icial performance in the state, and makes it
easier to censure or even fire a judge.
—Approved Prop. 4, which allows the legisla
ture to require the University of Calitornia to put
projects up for competitive bidding.
—Rejected Prop. 6, which would have given
the governor more time to consider bills after the
first year of a two-year legislative session.
State Demos gain seats in House
Los Angeles — The election in which Califor
nia Republicans hoped to recover some of their
post-Watergate congressional losses turned out
to be another year of gain for Democrats.
The number of seats held by the GOP dropped
to 14 Tuesday as a veteran Republican incum
bent went down to defeat and a Democrat scar
red by a sex scandal and a bribery probe held on
to win.
Altogether, Democrats gained one seat, bring
ing their total to 29. They added four seats two
years in the wake of Watergate.
Nation votes on diverse initiatives
Washington — The following are the results
of dozens of initiatives on various state ballots
around the country in Tuesday's election.
The measure to suffer the most resounding
defeat was that to limit the growth of nuclear
power plants by imposing strict safety stan
dards. Such a proposal was turned down hand
ily in Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Ohio, Ore
gon and Washington.
The measures were mostly patterned on a
California plan that was defeated by the voters in
June. While differing in detail, they generally
would have required that nuclear facilities be
proved safe by equipment testing before they
may be built or operated.
The nuclear and electric utility industries
spent heavily to defeat the six measures on the
ballot Tuesday. In Ohio alone, their budget was
$1 million — 25 times the funds available to

supporters, who were largely from environmen
tal or consumer groups.
Opponents had said the measures would, in
effect, ban further nuclear power development
and could lead to electricity shortages.
A measure to ban the sale of handguns fared
little better. It was defeated by a more than 2-to-l
margin in Massachusetts, which was believed to
be the first state with a referenda on such a mea
sure.
The measure would have required owners to
turn in handguns for reimbursement by the
state, with the total cost estimated at $50 million
to $125 million.
New Jersey citizens voted, meanwhile, to
allow legal casino gambling in the state's best
known resort, Atlantic City, known mostly in
recent years as the home of the Miss America
pageant.
Proponents of the measure had maintained it
would restore the resort to the days when it was
visited by wealthy New Yorkers and Philadelp
hians a half-century ago, an era when it was
known for its night life, including illegal gambl
ing and before air travel made other resort areas
more accessible.
And in Maine and Michigan, voters accepted
proposals to require deposit beverage bottles.
Similar measures met defeat in Colorado and
Massachusetts.
The measures were based on an Oregon law
adopted four years ago that bans sale of no
deposit bottles and pull-top cans. It too met
heavy opposition from industry and labor
groups who maintained it would do little to
solve the problem it was intended for — litter —
and would raise prices on soft drinks and beer.
Other states also voted on gambling measures
Tuesday. Georgia voters approved a constitu
tional amendment legalizing nonprofit bingo
games, Vermonters voted to ask the state legisla
ture to approve a state-run lottery and Colorado
voters approved a state sweepstakes.
However, a nonbinding measure on allowing
up to six gambling casinos in Detroit was de
feated, a proposal to legalize greyhound racing
lost in California and a measure to allow slot
machines was rejected in Delaware.
Referenda in other states included:
—Michigan voters turned down proposals to
limit state spending and taxes, permit a
graduated income tax and lower the minimum
age for state legislators from 28 to 21.

—Alaska citizens voted to move the state capi
tal to Willow, about 70 miles from Anchorage.
The present capital, at Juneau, is tar from the
state's most populous areas.
—In Colorado, voters turned down a measure
that would have required a majority of residents
to approve any increase in state or local govern
ment spending.
—Oklahomans rejected a proposed constitu
tional amendment to permit sale of liquor by the
drink.
