McKay debate tonight
Debaters Jim Wagstaffe and Vicki
Kifferstein will face a team from the
University of Southern California in
the annual McKay Debate tonight at 8
in Cubherley Auditorium. The topi(
will be "Safety of Birth Control Drugs
and Devices."
Swine flu shots
Free swine flu vaccinations will be
availablefor members of the university
community whose names begin with

from noon to 4 p.m.
Correction
The unfortunate insertion of the
word "not" in "McCloskey rolls over
opponents" in yesterday's Daily
changed the sense of one of Con
gressman McCloskey's remarks drasti
cally. The last sentence of the article
should have read . . with Harris
'looking over his shoulder* he was ob
ligated to keep his campaign prom
ises."
