# Vote exceeds prediction

The experts predicted that Ameri
cans were too apathetic to vote this
year. But the experts reckoned without
the determination of the public.
"There was so much darn talk about
apathy, that people decided not to be
apathetic," said one politician in Ken
tucky, explaining the heavy turnout in
his state.
On a nationwide basis, the turnout
was about 53 per cent of the voting age
population — above the level pre
dicted by many experts, but lower than
any year since 1948.
The percentage of the voting age
population balloting in presidential
elections has declined steadily since a
record 62.8 per cent turned out for the
1960 race between Richard Nixon and
John Kennedy.
Percentage drops
"For the fourth consecutive elec
tion, voting as a percentage of eligible
population declined," said Curtis
Gans of the Committee for the Study of
the America Electorate.
The committee said in July that its
poll showed voter turnout might be
less than 50 per cent of those eligible.
That would have been the lowest turn
out since the 51.1 pier cent showing in
the 1948 race between Harry Truman
and Thomas Dewey. The all-time re
cord low turnout, 43.5 per cent of the
voting age population, was in 1920
when universal suffrage was in effect
for the first time.
Gans said yesterday that the com
mittee had cited three factors that
could boost the turnout: the presiden
tial debates, a race that appeared close
and Jimmy Carter's appeal to the
South.
Debate impact minimal
He said the debates had little effect
on the turnout, but said that the
number of people voting in the South
was larger than normal. The narrow
ing of the gap between Carter and Pres
ident Gerald Ford also brought out
more people, Gans said.
As of midaftertioon Tuesday, the
News Election Service reported
79,398,843 votes cast for Ford. Carter,
independent Eugene McCarthy and

American Independent party candi
date Lester Maddox. Totals for other
minor party candidates were not im
mediately available.
That figure, based on nearly com
plete voting reports in most areas, rep
resented 52.9 per cent of the voting age
population, estimated at 150 million
persons. And the number was certain
to grow as complete returns were tal
lied.
Political analysts — and the candi
dates themselves — talked about
apathy this year and worried about the
turnout, despite a later Gallup poll
showing that the closeness of the race
and the presidential debates might
send people to the voting booth.
The Gallup poll apparently was
right. "Everybody read that voters
were apathetic and most people prob
ably said, 'I don't want to be the apathy
guy," said Jack McDermott, an election
commissioner in Boston. "People re
solved to get out and vote. Also, they
read it was close and they figured their
vote might make a difference."

Land's end
A Santa Clara County court ruling this week may hasten the demolition of
this house and others occupied by residents of The Land commune. Palo
Alto has already posted 10-day notices for eviction.
