# Carter sets unity as goal

### 
Washington (AP) — President-elect
Jimmy Carter, the outsider come to
power, accepted yesterday the hoarse
congratulations and the promised
support of President Gerald Ford, the
appointed incumbent he so narrowly
vanquished to win the White House.
At the railroad depot in Plains, Ga.,
his hometown campaign headquar
ters, Carter said a first task must be
"the unification of our country after a
close and hard-fought election." He
said Ford's promise of cooperation to
that end will make the job "much
easier for me."
So hoarse and weak was the presi
dent's voice that in his telephone call
to Carter, Ford had aide Richard
Cheney read his telegram of conces
sion and congratulation. Later, Ford
turned to his wife to read it to news
men and the nation in an appearance
televised from the White House.
The Democrat who began by run
ning against the Washington estab
lishment prepared to take over; his
confidantes forecasting an activist
administration that will change the
face of government.
Bare electoral win
Carter had 272 electoral votes, two
more than a majority, with Ohio's 25
and Oregon's six still in doubt, al
though he was narrowly ahead in
those states.
Ford had 235.
More than 79 million ballots were
cast, and the switch of a relative hand
ful in closely contested states would
have been enough to tip the electoral
college verdict from Carter to Ford.
Ford carried 26 states. Carter 22 and
the District of Columbia. Hut Carter's
near-solid South, his command of
Democratic bastions of the Northeast,
and his inroads into the Midwest

added up to victory.
In the popular vote, with 99 per cent
of the nation's precincts reporting, the
outcome was:
Carter 40,173,854 or 51 per cent.
Ford 38,429,988 or 48 per cent.
Independent Eugene McCarthy
654,770 or 1 per cent.
New people
Carter will begin quickly with his
designs to reshape government and fill
a cabinet mostly with "people you've
probably never heard of," aides said.
An extensive pre-election transition
operation has done the groundwork to
enable Carter to begin even before he
takes office to press his budget ideas
on Congress. And the framework for
major legislative programs already has
been drafted.
The other immediate task is staffing
his new administration.
The first Carter imprint is apt to be
felt in the White House staff structure,
which he has pledged to reorder.
Hamilton Jordan, Carter's campaign
manager, predicted there would be a
high percentage of young persons in
top jobs. Jack Watson. Carter's transi
tion office head, anticipates a heavy
weighting toward women and
minorities.
Watson, who is considered likely to
continue as transition chief, has pre
pared lists of likely appointees to the
top offices, although he insists the real
recruiting hasn't begun.
Close aids
The one category for which there is
no list is Carter's personal White
House staff, which is likely to be based
on the group of close aides who have
been with him through the campaign
and, before that, in his Georgia roles as
legislator and governor.
Jordan, who was Carter's executive
secretary as governor, is considered
most likely to head his White House
staff. Jody Powell, Carter's press sec
retary for years, is expected to keep
that role.
Senior Carter adviser Charles kirbo
said he wants no part of Washington.

Although he expects to remain a friend
and counsel to the president-elect, he
says he is not interested in any formal
office.
No names
Although Watson and the campaign
staff have kept quiet ahout names, Car
ter's advisers on specific subjects are
known.
Former Defense Secretary James
Schlesinger, an adviser before the
foreign affairs debate with Ford, has
been mentioned as a possibility for the
Pentagon post again.
Possible replacements for Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger include two
former Pentagon officials, Paul Nit/.e
and Cyrus Vance, as well as former
Undersecretary of State Ceorge Ball.
But Carter's campaign statements in
dicate he may pick someone even less
well-known.
Key counselor
One of Carter's key counselors on
foreign policy, Columbia University
professor Zbigniew Brzezinski, is con
sidered a candidate for Kissinger's
other old job of national security ad
viser.
In the area of economics, Carter's top
advisor has been Lawrence Klein of the
Wharton School. He is a prospect for
chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers.
Other economic advisers who might
be offered administration posts in
clude Charles Schultze of the Brook
ings Institution, former chairman of
Lyndon Johnson's economic advisers
and Joseph Pechman of Brookings,
who has been Carter's top tax adviser.
Other posts indefinite
Speculation in other areas has been
less specific.
Carter will find new faces but the
same Democratic command in Con
gress. This was the box score:
The Senate retained its power ba
lance of 02 Democrats and 38 Republi
cans. The Democratic balance in
cludes Independent Harry Byrd Jr. of
Virginia who votes in the Democratic
caucus. All told, each party won seven
seats held by the other.
In the House, Democrats won 293
seats and led for five others. Republi
cans won 142 seats.
The presidential edge was razor
thin in several states.
In Ohio, Carter's edge over Ford was
fewer than 8000 votes. In Oregon, it
was fewer than 1000. In Hawaii, Car
ter's margin was a scant 7000. Among
them, those states have 35 electoral
votes, enough to have given Ford the
victory that was Carter's.
So it was close, but it was clear. T<
underscore that judgment, New York
Republicans withdrew their suit to
impound ballots for a recount of the
vote that delivered Carter 41 electoral
votes there. At the White House, .t
spokesman said there would be no ef
fort to challenge the state count. Cartel
won bv about 327,000 votes.

more than a majority, with Ohio's 25
and Oregon's six still in doubt, al
though he was narrowly ahead in
those states.
Ford had 235.
More than 79 million ballots were
cast, and the switch of a relative hand
ful in closely contested states would
have been enough to tip the electoral
college verdict from Carter to Ford.
Ford carried 26 states. Carter 22 and
the District of Columbia. Hut Carter's
near-solid South, his command of
Democratic bastions of the Northeast,
and his inroads into the Midwest

added up to victory.
In the popular vote, with 99 per cent
of the nation's precincts reporting, the
outcome was:
Carter 40,173,854 or 51 per cent.
Ford 38,429,988 or 48 per cent.
Independent Eugene McCarthy
654,770 or 1 per cent.
New people
Carter will begin quickly with his
designs to reshape government and fill
a cabinet mostly with "people you've
probably never heard of," aides said.
An extensive pre-election transition
operation has done the groundwork to
enable Carter to begin even before he
takes office to press his budget ideas
on Congress. And the framework for
major legislative programs already has
been drafted.
The other immediate task is staffing
his new administration.
The first Carter imprint is apt to be
felt in the White House staff structure,
which he has pledged to reorder.
Hamilton Jordan, Carter's campaign
manager, predicted there would be a
high percentage of young persons in
top jobs. Jack Watson. Carter's transi
tion office head, anticipates a heavy
weighting toward women and
minorities.
Watson, who is considered likely to
continue as transition chief, has pre
pared lists of likely appointees to the
top offices, although he insists the real
recruiting hasn't begun.
Close aids
The one category for which there is
no list is Carter's personal White
House staff, which is likely to be based
on the group of close aides who have
been with him through the campaign
and, before that, in his Georgia roles as
legislator and governor.
Jordan, who was Carter's executive
secretary as governor, is considered
most likely to head his White House
staff. Jody Powell, Carter's press sec
retary for years, is expected to keep
that role.
Senior Carter adviser Charles kirbo
said he wants no part of Washington.

Although he expects to remain a friend
and counsel to the president-elect, he
says he is not interested in any formal
office.
No names
Although Watson and the campaign
staff have kept quiet ahout names, Car
ter's advisers on specific subjects are
known.
Former Defense Secretary James
Schlesinger, an adviser before the
foreign affairs debate with Ford, has
been mentioned as a possibility for the
Pentagon post again.
Possible replacements for Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger include two
former Pentagon officials, Paul Nit/.e
and Cyrus Vance, as well as former
Undersecretary of State Ceorge Ball.
But Carter's campaign statements in
dicate he may pick someone even less
well-known.
Key counselor
One of Carter's key counselors on
foreign policy, Columbia University
professor Zbigniew Brzezinski, is con
sidered a candidate for Kissinger's
other old job of national security ad
viser.
In the area of economics, Carter's top
advisor has been Lawrence Klein of the
Wharton School. He is a prospect for
chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers.
Other economic advisers who might
be offered administration posts in
clude Charles Schultze of the Brook
ings Institution, former chairman of
Lyndon Johnson's economic advisers
and Joseph Pechman of Brookings,
who has been Carter's top tax adviser.
Other posts indefinite
Speculation in other areas has been
less specific.
Carter will find new faces but the
same Democratic command in Con
gress. This was the box score:
The Senate retained its power ba
lance of 02 Democrats and 38 Republi
cans. The Democratic balance in
cludes Independent Harry Byrd Jr. of
Virginia who votes in the Democratic
caucus. All told, each party won seven
seats held by the other.
In the House, Democrats won 293
seats and led for five others. Republi
cans won 142 seats.
The presidential edge was razor
thin in several states.
In Ohio, Carter's edge over Ford was
fewer than 8000 votes. In Oregon, it
was fewer than 1000. In Hawaii, Car
ter's margin was a scant 7000. Among
them, those states have 35 electoral
votes, enough to have given Ford the
victory that was Carter's.
So it was close, but it was clear. T<
underscore that judgment, New York
Republicans withdrew their suit to
impound ballots for a recount of the
vote that delivered Carter 41 electoral
votes there. At the White House, .t
spokesman said there would be no ef
fort to challenge the state count. Cartel
won bv about 327,000 votes.

probably never heard of," aides said.
An extensive pre-election transition
operation has done the groundwork to
enable Carter to begin even before he
takes office to press his budget ideas
on Congress. And the framework for
major legislative programs already has
been drafted.
The other immediate task is staffing
his new administration.
The first Carter imprint is apt to be
felt in the White House staff structure,
which he has pledged to reorder.
Hamilton Jordan, Carter's campaign
manager, predicted there would be a
high percentage of young persons in
top jobs. Jack Watson. Carter's transi
tion office head, anticipates a heavy
weighting toward women and
minorities.
Watson, who is considered likely to
continue as transition chief, has pre
pared lists of likely appointees to the
top offices, although he insists the real
recruiting hasn't begun.
Close aids
The one category for which there is
no list is Carter's personal White
House staff, which is likely to be based
on the group of close aides who have
been with him through the campaign
and, before that, in his Georgia roles as
legislator and governor.
Jordan, who was Carter's executive
secretary as governor, is considered
most likely to head his White House
staff. Jody Powell, Carter's press sec
retary for years, is expected to keep
that role.
Senior Carter adviser Charles kirbo
said he wants no part of Washington.

Although he expects to remain a friend
and counsel to the president-elect, he
says he is not interested in any formal
office.
No names
Although Watson and the campaign
staff have kept quiet ahout names, Car
ter's advisers on specific subjects are
known.
Former Defense Secretary James
Schlesinger, an adviser before the
foreign affairs debate with Ford, has
been mentioned as a possibility for the
Pentagon post again.
Possible replacements for Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger include two
former Pentagon officials, Paul Nit/.e
and Cyrus Vance, as well as former
Undersecretary of State Ceorge Ball.
But Carter's campaign statements in
dicate he may pick someone even less
well-known.
Key counselor
One of Carter's key counselors on
foreign policy, Columbia University
professor Zbigniew Brzezinski, is con
sidered a candidate for Kissinger's
other old job of national security ad
viser.
In the area of economics, Carter's top
advisor has been Lawrence Klein of the
Wharton School. He is a prospect for
chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers.
Other economic advisers who might
be offered administration posts in
clude Charles Schultze of the Brook
ings Institution, former chairman of
Lyndon Johnson's economic advisers
and Joseph Pechman of Brookings,
who has been Carter's top tax adviser.
Other posts indefinite
Speculation in other areas has been
less specific.
Carter will find new faces but the
same Democratic command in Con
gress. This was the box score:
The Senate retained its power ba
lance of 02 Democrats and 38 Republi
cans. The Democratic balance in
cludes Independent Harry Byrd Jr. of
Virginia who votes in the Democratic
caucus. All told, each party won seven
seats held by the other.
In the House, Democrats won 293
seats and led for five others. Republi
cans won 142 seats.
The presidential edge was razor
thin in several states.
In Ohio, Carter's edge over Ford was
fewer than 8000 votes. In Oregon, it
was fewer than 1000. In Hawaii, Car
ter's margin was a scant 7000. Among
them, those states have 35 electoral
votes, enough to have given Ford the
victory that was Carter's.
So it was close, but it was clear. T<
underscore that judgment, New York
Republicans withdrew their suit to
impound ballots for a recount of the
vote that delivered Carter 41 electoral
votes there. At the White House, .t
spokesman said there would be no ef
fort to challenge the state count. Cartel
won bv about 327,000 votes.
Washington (AP) — President-elect
Jimmy Carter, the outsider come to
power, accepted yesterday the hoarse
congratulations and the promised
support of President Gerald Ford, the
appointed incumbent he so narrowly
vanquished to win the White House.
At the railroad depot in Plains, Ga.,
his hometown campaign headquar
ters, Carter said a first task must be
"the unification of our country after a
close and hard-fought election." He
said Ford's promise of cooperation to
that end will make the job "much
easier for me."
So hoarse and weak was the presi
dent's voice that in his telephone call
to Carter, Ford had aide Richard
Cheney read his telegram of conces
sion and congratulation. Later, Ford
turned to his wife to read it to news
men and the nation in an appearance
televised from the White House.
The Democrat who began by run
ning against the Washington estab
lishment prepared to take over; his
confidantes forecasting an activist
administration that will change the
face of government.
Bare electoral win
Carter had 272 electoral votes, two
more than a majority, with Ohio's 25
and Oregon's six still in doubt, al
though he was narrowly ahead in
those states.
Ford had 235.
More than 79 million ballots were
cast, and the switch of a relative hand
ful in closely contested states would
have been enough to tip the electoral
college verdict from Carter to Ford.
Ford carried 26 states. Carter 22 and
the District of Columbia. Hut Carter's
near-solid South, his command of
Democratic bastions of the Northeast,
and his inroads into the Midwest

added up to victory.
In the popular vote, with 99 per cent
of the nation's precincts reporting, the
outcome was:
Carter 40,173,854 or 51 per cent.
Ford 38,429,988 or 48 per cent.
Independent Eugene McCarthy
654,770 or 1 per cent.
