The North Santa Clara County
Superior Court ruled Tuesday that the
city of PaloAlto must "grant sufficient
and adequate protection" to a hind
owner if she decides to demolish struc
tures on her property built and cur
rently occupied by members of The
Land commune.
Judge Peter Anello ruled in favor of
owner Alyce Burns after she testified
that she had been prevented from tear
ing down the hand-made buildings lo
cated on her 600-acre foothill site on
Page Mill Road near Skyline Drive.
She said she had been informed that
the buildings did not meet the city's

municipal building code. When she at
tempted to demolish them, her agents
had been prevented by some of the ap
proximately 50 members of The Land
commune from tearing the structures
down.
"This is my land and they are tres
passers up there. They won't let me
up," she said.
Palo Alto city attorney Robert Booth
Jr., who represented the city of Palo
Alto, asked Burns if she was willing to
tear down the buildings. She said she
would be if "given proper protection."
A condition of Tuesday's court order
was that notice must be posted on the
property at least 10 days prior to the
date and time set for the demolition of
the structures.
Notice posted
Lt. A 1 Bowra of the Palo Alto police
department said yesterday that signs
have been posted on the property.
The court also heard testimony on
conditions at the commune from three
city employes.
Rick Herman, city inspector, re
ported that on Oct. 29, he saw "15
structures there and about 15 more lo
cated about the wooded areas and ap
proximately 50 inhabitants."
He said the buildings were "very
rustic," with no utilities or sewage
lines, and were heated with "wood
burning stoves, kerosene lamps and
space heaters." The buildings "don't
meet the housing code" and could not
be brought up to standard "without
utilities," Herman said.
Norman Lacey, city fire inspector,
said the results of his recent inspection
were "very similar to an inspection
we'd made in 1973."
1 le said that the land was a "hazard
ous fire area" and that the buildings'
roofs didn't meet the city's fire retar
dant standards. The structures could
not be brought up to standard "unless
there's a complete rebuilding," he ad
ded.
Housing inadequate
Stanley Nowicki, the city's chief
building inspector, said that he went
up to The Land on Oct. 27 to inspect
the buildings, but "the people refused
me permission to enter." He said ar
rangements were made for an inspec
tion the next day, and that this inspec
tion found that "the conditions are
such that they cannot be remedied."
Commune members who attended
the session sat in stunned silence as
Anello read his decision, but after
ward. they vehemently expressed their
displeasure.
One of them said that the battle was
"far from over" and another said The
Land might consider applying class k
statutes (different building standards
for rural buildings) in the case to
"maybe set a precedent."
"I think it was a crime that there
wasn't anybody there to speak for the
people," said one resident.

Stanley Nowicki, the city's chief
building inspector, said that he went
up to The Land on Oct. 27 to inspect
the buildings, but "the people refused
me permission to enter." He said ar
rangements were made for an inspec
tion the next day, and that this inspec
tion found that "the conditions are
such that they cannot be remedied."
Commune members who attended
the session sat in stunned silence as
Anello read his decision, but after
ward. they vehemently expressed their
displeasure.
One of them said that the battle was
"far from over" and another said The
Land might consider applying class k
statutes (different building standards
for rural buildings) in the case to
"maybe set a precedent."
"I think it was a crime that there
wasn't anybody there to speak for the
people," said one resident.
The North Santa Clara County
Superior Court ruled Tuesday that the
city of PaloAlto must "grant sufficient
and adequate protection" to a hind
owner if she decides to demolish struc
tures on her property built and cur
rently occupied by members of The
Land commune.
Judge Peter Anello ruled in favor of
owner Alyce Burns after she testified
that she had been prevented from tear
ing down the hand-made buildings lo
cated on her 600-acre foothill site on
Page Mill Road near Skyline Drive.
She said she had been informed that
the buildings did not meet the city's

municipal building code. When she at
tempted to demolish them, her agents
had been prevented by some of the ap
proximately 50 members of The Land
commune from tearing the structures
down.
"This is my land and they are tres
passers up there. They won't let me
up," she said.
Palo Alto city attorney Robert Booth
Jr., who represented the city of Palo
Alto, asked Burns if she was willing to
tear down the buildings. She said she
would be if "given proper protection."
A condition of Tuesday's court order
was that notice must be posted on the
property at least 10 days prior to the
date and time set for the demolition of
the structures.
Notice posted
Lt. A 1 Bowra of the Palo Alto police
department said yesterday that signs
have been posted on the property.
The court also heard testimony on
conditions at the commune from three
city employes.
Rick Herman, city inspector, re
ported that on Oct. 29, he saw "15
structures there and about 15 more lo
cated about the wooded areas and ap
proximately 50 inhabitants."
He said the buildings were "very
rustic," with no utilities or sewage
lines, and were heated with "wood
burning stoves, kerosene lamps and
space heaters." The buildings "don't
meet the housing code" and could not
be brought up to standard "without
utilities," Herman said.
Norman Lacey, city fire inspector,
said the results of his recent inspection
were "very similar to an inspection
we'd made in 1973."
1 le said that the land was a "hazard
ous fire area" and that the buildings'
roofs didn't meet the city's fire retar
dant standards. The structures could
not be brought up to standard "unless
there's a complete rebuilding," he ad
ded.
