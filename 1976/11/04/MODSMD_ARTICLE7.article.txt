The American government has al
ways laid claim to being a government
that is concerned with the needs of the
American people. However, the Un
ited States should have a better and
more centralized system of social ser
vices for its people.
For over a hundred years, the United
States has led not only its citizens, but
people the world over, to believe that
America is a land of wealth and pros
perity. The Statue of Liberty, and the
quotation at its base, exemplifies this
perfectly. America has been consi
dered a haven for the poor and op
pressed the world over, and therefore
owes certain basic services to all
Americans. We must fulfill our prom
ises.
Many Americans have feared that
the instituting of a national social ser
vice system would be a step toward
communism. However, it is quite pos
sible to have an adequate system of this
nature, and remain non-communistic.
Germany is an example of this.
Germany had an industrial revolu
tion similar to ours, but from the start,
the value of the common laborer was
recognized in Germany. Under Bis
marck, Germany became a pioneer in
social-security legislation.
National sickness laws
As early as 1883, national sickness
laws were passed. Laws for accident
insurance were passed the following
year, and old-age and disability insur
ance laws were enacted in 1889. There
could be no reasonable argument
against these procedures. The cost of
the plans was not an issue, for the pro
ductivity of the workers increased so
much that their increased efficiency
paid for the insurance in full.
It had been feared that the quality of
medical care would decline as a side
effect, but (here was no evidence of
this. As a matter of fact, the only sig
nificant side-effect was that employers
redoubled their efforts to make work
ing conditions safer. Result: Within
one year there was a 70 per cent reduc
tion in accidents due to dangerous
machines.
Today, Germany still has one of the
best social-service systems in the
world. Workers are expected to have
4ong and productive careers, and are
rewarded, after retirement, with excel
lent medical care, food, and in some
cases, fully subsidized housing.
U.S. can afford one
The United States doesn't have a
system of this magnitude, but we can
probably afford one. We are first in
military strength, which means we
probably won't be attacked tonight,
but the United States ranks only 18th
in the world in doctor-patient ratio,
15th in literacy, 15th in infant mortal
ity, and 25th in life-expectancy.
Over the last few decades, Gongress
has passed bill after bill appropriating
money for missiles, bombers, subs and
other appliances, while the need for
better services for the people is evi
dent.
According to the Federal Poverty
Index, there were 25 million "poor"
Americans in 1968. According to the
inuex, "poor" refers to a family of four
whose income is under $3553 annu
ally. If we add to these 25 million the
millions of other Americans who earn
over $3553 but who still lack good
health care, housing, or education, we
may find that between one fifth and
one quarter of the American people

have serious basic needs which are not
being met by our government.
Need is clear
It is clear that the need for a better
social service plan is present, and it
seems reasonable to assume that
America has the wealth and industrial
capacity to fulfill those needs. How
can one more bomb be built, or gener
al's cocktail party be financed with
taxpayers' money, while so many
American citizens are in need?
Sure, defense is necessary, and so
are some other things our government
spends money on. But here we're deal
ing with a question of priorities. As tar
as I'm concerned, feeding and housing
our people is pretty high up on the list.
I'm certainly not advocating com
munism, or even socialism, but I think
this can be an even greater and more
prosperous nation. The word
"America" stands for something, and
it's not hunger. An adequate social
service system is not an unreasonable
goal.
Granted, it's not an easy one either,
but since when has that stopped the
United States of America?
Remember Emma Lacarns' words:
"Give me your tired, your hungry,
your poor, your huddled masses
yearning to be free, the wretched re
fuse of your teeming shore, send those
homeless tempest-tost to me; I left my
lamp beside the golden door."
