Use Giraud

A small amplification of the Daily
story of Oct. 21 on sexism in the Lib
rary; much as 1 appreciate Assoc. Pro
vost Edward Shaw's civilized and
happy settlement of my grievance,
which spared me and the university
the Title VII suit toward which it was
headed, the chief credit for its success
must go to United Stanford Emplovees
(USE).
Fighting city hall for two years can
get to be a sticky business, and the
women in the library, some bitterly
opposed to unions, should know that
there is just a chance that they might
not now be collecting their two years'
back pay — several thousand dollars
each in some cases — were it not for
the union.
USE made available to me all their
considerable expertise, acquired in
hundreds of grievances against unjust
employment practices. They saw me
through some of life's darker mo
ments.
They saved me from becoming the
Library's only woman to run a deficit
for equal pay: they shared the hefty
legal bill I had to run up in preparation
for the outside arbitration to which my
case, predictably, had to be carried.
It never took place, however, be
cause my arbitrator discovered his
conflict of interest six days before the
hearing, just when our side pressed
him to subpoena the library's closely
guarded figures on rank and salary dis-

tribution by sex.
USE put at my disposal its crack
legal team, attorney James Wolpman
and his assistant, Jane Burton, without
whom 1 should have been ill-matched
indeed against the massive legal talent
the university had pitted against me:
the redoubtable Doug Barton, the uni
versity's chief negotiator, and Prisci 1 la
Wheeler, a woman lawyer of fairly re
•cent hire, who fought hard and well to
keep any documentation on discrimi
nation against women from reaching
the light of day.
Inconspicuously absent from the
fray was Anne Miner, our affirmative
action officer for women, to whom I
spoke and sent a copy of my grievance
when I filed it and from whom I have
never heard a word in the 25 months
since.
Great credit too must go to the many
friends and colleag les in the library,
male and female, who offered me in
valuable moral support and hard facts
with which to build a strong case.
Alas, many of them have not profited
much from the recent adjustment.
For when our pay in the upper ranks
was brought up to par with that of men,
it was found that no inequity existed in
the lower ranks, since — mirabile
dictu — in the lower ranks there hardly
are any men.

Alas, many of them have not profited
much from the recent adjustment.
For when our pay in the upper ranks
was brought up to par with that of men,
it was found that no inequity existed in
the lower ranks, since — mirabile
dictu — in the lower ranks there hardly
are any men.

A small amplification of the Daily
story of Oct. 21 on sexism in the Lib
rary; much as 1 appreciate Assoc. Pro
vost Edward Shaw's civilized and
happy settlement of my grievance,
which spared me and the university
the Title VII suit toward which it was
headed, the chief credit for its success
must go to United Stanford Emplovees
(USE).
Fighting city hall for two years can
get to be a sticky business, and the
women in the library, some bitterly
opposed to unions, should know that
there is just a chance that they might
not now be collecting their two years'
back pay — several thousand dollars
each in some cases — were it not for
the union.
USE made available to me all their
considerable expertise, acquired in
hundreds of grievances against unjust
employment practices. They saw me
through some of life's darker mo
ments.
They saved me from becoming the
Library's only woman to run a deficit
for equal pay: they shared the hefty
legal bill I had to run up in preparation
for the outside arbitration to which my
case, predictably, had to be carried.
It never took place, however, be
cause my arbitrator discovered his
conflict of interest six days before the
hearing, just when our side pressed
him to subpoena the library's closely
guarded figures on rank and salary dis-

tribution by sex.
USE put at my disposal its crack
legal team, attorney James Wolpman
and his assistant, Jane Burton, without
whom 1 should have been ill-matched
indeed against the massive legal talent
the university had pitted against me:
the redoubtable Doug Barton, the uni
versity's chief negotiator, and Prisci 1 la
Wheeler, a woman lawyer of fairly re
•cent hire, who fought hard and well to
keep any documentation on discrimi
nation against women from reaching
the light of day.
Inconspicuously absent from the
fray was Anne Miner, our affirmative
action officer for women, to whom I
spoke and sent a copy of my grievance
when I filed it and from whom I have
never heard a word in the 25 months
since.
Great credit too must go to the many
friends and colleag les in the library,
male and female, who offered me in
valuable moral support and hard facts
with which to build a strong case.
Alas, many of them have not profited
much from the recent adjustment.
For when our pay in the upper ranks
was brought up to par with that of men,
it was found that no inequity existed in
