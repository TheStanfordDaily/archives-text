# Rhodesians spurn West's potential aid

Geneva (AF) â€” Robert Gabriel
Mugabe, who is making a strong bid to
become the first prime minister of a
black-ruled Rhodesia, says he would
spurn a $2-bi 11 ion trust and invest
ment fund planned for his country by
the West.
"We would have nothing to do with
it,"the nationalist leader said in an
interview with The Associated Press.
"To us it seems as if its purpose is to
bind Zimbabwe politically and
economically and it could therefore
compromise our independence."
Zimbabwe is the name the
nationalists will give to their new
state, and Mugabe is projecting the
toughest line of the four rival black
leaders attending the Geneva cofer
ence on Rhodesia's future.
The 52-year-old carpenter's son is the
chosen political spokesman for most of
the black guerrillas in the
Mozambique-based Zimbabwe
People's Army (ZIPA). The guerrillas
today are at the forefront of the black
struggle for control of the colony that
broke away from Britain 11 years ago
under the leadership of Prime Minister
lan Smith's white minority regime.
The future Zimbabwe will be nonra
cial and nonaligned in the East-West
struggle, Mugabe said in the inter
view. "We would hope to be guided by
socialisj principles."
United with whites
He said the new constitution would
guarantee the rights of the white
minority because "our concern is not
to differentiate. We want a united
Zimbabwean nation. This is the cor
rect approach."
For the Geneva conference Mugabe
and Joshua Nkumo, the elder stateman
of black politics in Rhodesia, have
united in a so-called Patriotic Front.
The conference has been stalled on
the issue of an independence date. The
British, trying to the break the stale
mate. on Thursday proposed March
1978 as the goal, but Mugabe rejected
the proposal, insisting on a 12-month
timetable.
Leader of ZANU
Mugabe claims leadership of the
Zimbabwe African National Union
(ZANU), and Nkomo leadership of the
Zimbabwe African People's Union
(ZAPU). They are togetheragain after a
split between ZANU and ZAPU dating
back to the early 19605.
The proposed $2-bil lion fund was
part of Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer's plan to achieve a peaceful
transer to black majority rule in
Rhodesia.
It would provide government and
private-sector money from several
Western nations to revive Rhodesia's
economy, which for years has been de
teriorating because of United Nations
trade sanctions. It would also insure
compensation for white Rhodesians
who might abandon the new black
ruled state, leaving behind savings,
pension rights or other assets.
But Mugabe believes that the future
Zimbabwean government, and not an
international consortium, should as
sess the value of businesses or proper
ties left behind by emigrating whites.
And, he said, Zimbabwe should be free
to formulate its own development
program.
