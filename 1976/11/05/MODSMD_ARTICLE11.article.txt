# Sagan seeks extraterrestrial life
## 
### 
The following interstellar radiogram was moni
tored yesterday by the Lyndon Johnson Space
Center in Houston.
It read: "Earthlings of the United States, con
gratulations on the election of the peanut farmer
from Georgia! We also send our best wishes to all
the inhabitants of your blue planet. We are sure that
you would like to acknowledge our message, but by
the time your simple technology can return our
greeting, your star will have exploded.
Signed, Inhabitants of the Trifid Nebula, P.O.
Box 9011, Milky Way 10024."
My first reaction to that well-meaning cosmic
letter was to wonder why those creatures were so
concerned with the election of Jimmy Carter. After
all.whatdoes it matter who governs for four orbits
of the Earth, a country of some 200 million hu
mans? As the aliens noted, our civilization will
probably crumble by the time we could transmit a
radio wave back to their residence.
Extraterrestrial expert
It would have been more appropriate for the In
habitants of Trifid to express their concern over the
achievements of one Carl Sagan, professor of
astronomy at Cornell University. Sagan is
probably the human being most qualified to answer
the question of whether extraterrestrial life exists.
Writing in his book, The Cosmic Connection,
Sagan states, "Even today there are moments when
what I do seems to me like an improbably, if unusu
ally pleasant, dream: to be involved in the explora
tion of Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; to try to
duplicate the steps that led to the origin of life four
billion years ago on an Earth very different from the
one we know; to land instruments on Mars to search
there for life; and perhaps to be engaged in a serious
effort to communicate with othef intelligent be
ings, if such there be, out there in the dark of the
night sky.
"Had I been born 50 years earlier. 1 could have
pursued none of these activities. They were then all
figments of the speculative imagination. Had I been
born 50 years later. I also could not have been in
volved in these efforts, except possibly the last,
because 50 years from now the preliminary recon
naisance of the solar system, the search for life on
Mars, and the study of the origin of life will have
been completed. I think myself extraordinarily for
tunate to be alive at pne moment in the history of
mankind when such ventures are being underta
ken."
Very few of us probably have that outlook on life;
wishing to exist exactly in this space and time. But

for the exploration of our solar system at least, this
is one of the most exciting times to he alive. When
historians look back on the twentieth century they
might sum up the significant achievement of man

at that time as either having found life in his own
solar system, or having tried and failed to do so.
Discovering life
As far as discovering life in other solar systems —
Alpha Centauri is the closest star to our sun — that
question may survive the human race. Of course,
very few people aside from the Sagans share
this perspective. • •
I had the opportunity to meet Sagan at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena before school
started. He discussed the progress of the Viking
Mars mission at that time (which I update here).
So far, with two landers conducting experiments,
the prospects for finding life on the red planet are
enigmatic at best. The Viking Two robot reported
that it had not found organic material (molecules
composed of carbon chains) on the surface of Mars.
The Viking One craft earlier sent back data which
either suggests previously unknown dimensions of
chemistry or very primitive forms of life.
The controversy, which may take years to re
solve, centers on the behavior of one of the three
biological labs located inside the Viking One craft.
After enriching a soil sample in nutrient "chicken
soup," a radioactive "tag" showed by its increasing
rate that something in the sample was using some
of the nutrients.
Microscopic life
When the sample was heated, whatever was in
there apparently "died," for no further activity was
recorded. All of these experiments presume that
life, if it exists on Mars, is microscopic.
1 asked Sagan whether one of Vikings' cameras,
which have sent back spectacular color pictures of
the red-tinted surface, could possibly take a picture
of a Martian, assuming macrobes (living organisms
visible to the eye) really were present there. He said
that if a Martian strolled around the lander, the
panoramic camera, which takes 360 degree pic

tu res of the landscape one line at a time, would only
record "him" or "her" as a single unusual line in
the photograph.
Sagan also said that he was disappointed that
Viking had no mobility, such as the lunar rovers
demonstrated. Were they to have that capability
(denied due to lack of funds), the craft would be
able to wander over to the next rock it it looked
interesting.
I asked him whether astronauts couldn't serve
that function, but then recalled that one of the
Apollo moon walkers had fallen and nearly ripped
his suit. The astronomer responded that machines
would preclude that possibility and travel more
safely than humans. 1 suggested that such portable
robots could not make great statements when they
arrived on various heavenly orbs. But Sagan, with
his quick humor, remarked that this had not been
the case with men.
Great oratory
With 250 billion stars in our galaxy, futureearthl
ings will have plenty of chances to demonstrate
great exploratory oratory. However, seriously con
sidering the possibilities of finding another exam
ple of life in that maze of stars!including the sig
nificant case on thisplanet),leadsusto new insights
into our own explorations.
For instance, what if some spaceperson from <1
distant star wanted to land a Viking type craft on
the third planet of this solar system, namely Earth?
According to Sagan, the three most likely sights
that being would select would be the Sahara desert,
the Marianas trench and Antarctica, in that order;
hardly places where "he" would find intelligent
life. (Of course, were the alien ship to land in New
York City, it would probably either be towed away,
have its hubcaps ripped off or find itself the target
of some inquisitive dog.)
We might not be on the right track. Nevertheless,
the work of men like Sagan on projects such as the
Viking mission certainly represents an important
human activity, which deserves our interest and
support.
One last note: if by some fluke of the universe an
inhabitant of the Trifid Nebula ever reads this, 1 feel
it would only be kind to include the following
definition in this article.
Peanut: A plant of the pea family, probably native
to South America, whose pods ripen underground
and usually contain two large seeds which are used
as food and for their oil; groundnut; goober.

The following interstellar radiogram was moni
tored yesterday by the Lyndon Johnson Space
Center in Houston.
It read: "Earthlings of the United States, con
gratulations on the election of the peanut farmer
from Georgia! We also send our best wishes to all
the inhabitants of your blue planet. We are sure that
you would like to acknowledge our message, but by
the time your simple technology can return our
greeting, your star will have exploded.
Signed, Inhabitants of the Trifid Nebula, P.O.
Box 9011, Milky Way 10024."
My first reaction to that well-meaning cosmic
letter was to wonder why those creatures were so
concerned with the election of Jimmy Carter. After
all.whatdoes it matter who governs for four orbits
of the Earth, a country of some 200 million hu
mans? As the aliens noted, our civilization will
probably crumble by the time we could transmit a
radio wave back to their residence.
Extraterrestrial expert
It would have been more appropriate for the In
habitants of Trifid to express their concern over the
achievements of one Carl Sagan, professor of
astronomy at Cornell University. Sagan is
probably the human being most qualified to answer
the question of whether extraterrestrial life exists.
Writing in his book, The Cosmic Connection,
Sagan states, "Even today there are moments when
what I do seems to me like an improbably, if unusu
ally pleasant, dream: to be involved in the explora
tion of Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; to try to
duplicate the steps that led to the origin of life four
billion years ago on an Earth very different from the
one we know; to land instruments on Mars to search
there for life; and perhaps to be engaged in a serious
effort to communicate with othef intelligent be
ings, if such there be, out there in the dark of the
night sky.
"Had I been born 50 years earlier. 1 could have
pursued none of these activities. They were then all
figments of the speculative imagination. Had I been
born 50 years later. I also could not have been in
volved in these efforts, except possibly the last,
because 50 years from now the preliminary recon
naisance of the solar system, the search for life on
Mars, and the study of the origin of life will have
been completed. I think myself extraordinarily for
tunate to be alive at pne moment in the history of
mankind when such ventures are being underta
ken."
Very few of us probably have that outlook on life;
wishing to exist exactly in this space and time. But

for the exploration of our solar system at least, this
is one of the most exciting times to he alive. When
historians look back on the twentieth century they
might sum up the significant achievement of man

at that time as either having found life in his own
solar system, or having tried and failed to do so.
Discovering life
As far as discovering life in other solar systems —
Alpha Centauri is the closest star to our sun — that
question may survive the human race. Of course,
very few people aside from the Sagans share
this perspective. • •
I had the opportunity to meet Sagan at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena before school
started. He discussed the progress of the Viking
Mars mission at that time (which I update here).
So far, with two landers conducting experiments,
the prospects for finding life on the red planet are
enigmatic at best. The Viking Two robot reported
that it had not found organic material (molecules
composed of carbon chains) on the surface of Mars.
The Viking One craft earlier sent back data which
either suggests previously unknown dimensions of
chemistry or very primitive forms of life.
The controversy, which may take years to re
solve, centers on the behavior of one of the three
biological labs located inside the Viking One craft.
After enriching a soil sample in nutrient "chicken
soup," a radioactive "tag" showed by its increasing
rate that something in the sample was using some
of the nutrients.
Microscopic life
When the sample was heated, whatever was in
there apparently "died," for no further activity was
recorded. All of these experiments presume that
life, if it exists on Mars, is microscopic.
1 asked Sagan whether one of Vikings' cameras,
which have sent back spectacular color pictures of
the red-tinted surface, could possibly take a picture
of a Martian, assuming macrobes (living organisms
visible to the eye) really were present there. He said
that if a Martian strolled around the lander, the
panoramic camera, which takes 360 degree pic

tu res of the landscape one line at a time, would only
record "him" or "her" as a single unusual line in
the photograph.
Sagan also said that he was disappointed that
Viking had no mobility, such as the lunar rovers
demonstrated. Were they to have that capability
(denied due to lack of funds), the craft would be
able to wander over to the next rock it it looked
interesting.
I asked him whether astronauts couldn't serve
that function, but then recalled that one of the
Apollo moon walkers had fallen and nearly ripped
his suit. The astronomer responded that machines
would preclude that possibility and travel more
safely than humans. 1 suggested that such portable
robots could not make great statements when they
arrived on various heavenly orbs. But Sagan, with
his quick humor, remarked that this had not been
the case with men.
Great oratory
With 250 billion stars in our galaxy, futureearthl
ings will have plenty of chances to demonstrate
great exploratory oratory. However, seriously con
sidering the possibilities of finding another exam

1 asked Sagan whether one of Vikings' cameras,
which have sent back spectacular color pictures of
the red-tinted surface, could possibly take a picture
of a Martian, assuming macrobes (living organisms
visible to the eye) really were present there. He said
that if a Martian strolled around the lander, the
panoramic camera, which takes 360 degree pic

tu res of the landscape one line at a time, would only
record "him" or "her" as a single unusual line in
the photograph.
Sagan also said that he was disappointed that
Viking had no mobility, such as the lunar rovers
demonstrated. Were they to have that capability
(denied due to lack of funds), the craft would be
able to wander over to the next rock it it looked
interesting.
I asked him whether astronauts couldn't serve
that function, but then recalled that one of the
Apollo moon walkers had fallen and nearly ripped
his suit. The astronomer responded that machines
would preclude that possibility and travel more
safely than humans. 1 suggested that such portable
robots could not make great statements when they
arrived on various heavenly orbs. But Sagan, with
his quick humor, remarked that this had not been
the case with men.
Great oratory
With 250 billion stars in our galaxy, futureearthl
ings will have plenty of chances to demonstrate
great exploratory oratory. However, seriously con
sidering the possibilities of finding another exam
ple of life in that maze of stars!including the sig
nificant case on thisplanet),leadsusto new insights
into our own explorations.
For instance, what if some spaceperson from <1
distant star wanted to land a Viking type craft on
the third planet of this solar system, namely Earth?
According to Sagan, the three most likely sights
that being would select would be the Sahara desert,
the Marianas trench and Antarctica, in that order;
hardly places where "he" would find intelligent
life. (Of course, were the alien ship to land in New
York City, it would probably either be towed away,
have its hubcaps ripped off or find itself the target
of some inquisitive dog.)
We might not be on the right track. Nevertheless,
the work of men like Sagan on projects such as the
Viking mission certainly represents an important
human activity, which deserves our interest and
support.
One last note: if by some fluke of the universe an
inhabitant of the Trifid Nebula ever reads this, 1 feel
it would only be kind to include the following
definition in this article.
Peanut: A plant of the pea family, probably native
to South America, whose pods ripen underground
and usually contain two large seeds which are used
as food and for their oil; groundnut; goober.

The following interstellar radiogram was moni
tored yesterday by the Lyndon Johnson Space
Center in Houston.
It read: "Earthlings of the United States, con
gratulations on the election of the peanut farmer
from Georgia! We also send our best wishes to all
the inhabitants of your blue planet. We are sure that
you would like to acknowledge our message, but by
the time your simple technology can return our
greeting, your star will have exploded.
Signed, Inhabitants of the Trifid Nebula, P.O.
Box 9011, Milky Way 10024."
My first reaction to that well-meaning cosmic
letter was to wonder why those creatures were so
concerned with the election of Jimmy Carter. After
all.whatdoes it matter who governs for four orbits
of the Earth, a country of some 200 million hu
mans? As the aliens noted, our civilization will
probably crumble by the time we could transmit a
radio wave back to their residence.
Extraterrestrial expert
It would have been more appropriate for the In
habitants of Trifid to express their concern over the
achievements of one Carl Sagan, professor of
astronomy at Cornell University. Sagan is
probably the human being most qualified to answer
the question of whether extraterrestrial life exists.
Writing in his book, The Cosmic Connection,
Sagan states, "Even today there are moments when
what I do seems to me like an improbably, if unusu
ally pleasant, dream: to be involved in the explora
tion of Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; to try to
duplicate the steps that led to the origin of life four
billion years ago on an Earth very different from the
one we know; to land instruments on Mars to search
there for life; and perhaps to be engaged in a serious
effort to communicate with othef intelligent be
ings, if such there be, out there in the dark of the
night sky.
"Had I been born 50 years earlier. 1 could have
pursued none of these activities. They were then all
figments of the speculative imagination. Had I been
born 50 years later. I also could not have been in
volved in these efforts, except possibly the last,
because 50 years from now the preliminary recon
naisance of the solar system, the search for life on
Mars, and the study of the origin of life will have
been completed. I think myself extraordinarily for
tunate to be alive at pne moment in the history of
mankind when such ventures are being underta
ken."
Very few of us probably have that outlook on life;
wishing to exist exactly in this space and time. But

for the exploration of our solar system at least, this
is one of the most exciting times to he alive. When
historians look back on the twentieth century they
might sum up the significant achievement of man

at that time as either having found life in his own
solar system, or having tried and failed to do so.
Discovering life
As far as discovering life in other solar systems —
Alpha Centauri is the closest star to our sun — that
question may survive the human race. Of course,
very few people aside from the Sagans share
this perspective. • •
I had the opportunity to meet Sagan at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena before school
started. He discussed the progress of the Viking
Mars mission at that time (which I update here).
So far, with two landers conducting experiments,
the prospects for finding life on the red planet are
enigmatic at best. The Viking Two robot reported
that it had not found organic material (molecules
composed of carbon chains) on the surface of Mars.
The Viking One craft earlier sent back data which
either suggests previously unknown dimensions of
chemistry or very primitive forms of life.
The controversy, which may take years to re
solve, centers on the behavior of one of the three
biological labs located inside the Viking One craft.
After enriching a soil sample in nutrient "chicken
soup," a radioactive "tag" showed by its increasing
rate that something in the sample was using some
of the nutrients.
Microscopic life
When the sample was heated, whatever was in
there apparently "died," for no further activity was
recorded. All of these experiments presume that
life, if it exists on Mars, is microscopic.
