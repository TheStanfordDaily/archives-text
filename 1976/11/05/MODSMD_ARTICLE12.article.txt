# Letters: URPE statement, voting
## 
### 
Collective effort
Yesterday, the Daily published a
Stanford URPE statement, "Foley
'dumping' part of larger campaign."
This statement was first drafted by a
committee of four URPE members,
then reworked by a general open meet
ing of 25 URPE members and finalized
by a delegated committee of six.
It is extremely unfortunate that the
Daily ignored explicit organizational
authorship. The attribution of this
group statement to a single member
incorrectly individualizes an openly
collective work. URPE strongly be
lieves that progress only emerges from
group effort. The Daily has created a
false impression of the current strug
gle in the Economics Dept.
Stanford URPE members stand
unanimously behind the public state
ment.

Show your concern
The most disturbing aspect of the
recent campaign has been the
not to vote'argument.Experience in y
system where voting is compulsory
leads me to question the wisdom of
adopting the "riyht not to vote" men
tality.
The idea that not voting registers a
dissatisfaction with all candidates is a
spurious and naive suggestion. This
negative form of protest can only be
detrimental to the conduct of a democ
racy in that it weakens,
not strengthens, the power of the

people to cGniroi its politicians.
The politician who knows that only
a minority of potential voters will ac
tually vote tailors hie campaign ac
cordingly. Logically, only those voters
actively supporting the candidate will
vote so the politician need not articu
late specific and comprehensive prog
rams that would affect all voters. The
results are clear: the candidate satisfies
himself with establishing positions on
issues of concern to the groups who do
traditionally vote.
Now come the complaints. Neither
candidate is being specific, say some:
they're both the same, say others. Still
others will say that neither candidate
deserves the presidency.
Surely, if politicians are not being
specific on issues, if they both head for
middle-ground, if they don't de
monstrate the strengths voters think
they should have, then the voters
themselves are at fault, not the politi
cians.

Imagine the delight, and the relief,
of a mediocre politician when Ik;
knows that a sizable proportion of po
tential, and potentially powerful, vot
ers are ignoring him. He no longer has
to justify his candidacy to people who,
by sheer force of numbers, could re
quire him to become specific and to
explain fully his positions.
Is this a responsible way to participate
in a democracy? Surely it is crucial
that every voter declares his or her in
tention to vote, if only to inform the
politicians that they will have to ad
dress themselves to the whole electo
rate. and not just the groups who have
something to gain by voting a particu
lar politician into office.
The message is clear: if you want
better politicians you've got to show
your concern by declaringan intention
to vote.

It is extremely unfortunate that the
Daily ignored explicit organizational
authorship. The attribution of this
group statement to a single member
incorrectly individualizes an openly
collective work. URPE strongly be

group effort. The Daily has created a
false impression of the current strug

Stanford URPE members stand

Show your concern
The most disturbing aspect of the
recent campaign has been the
not to vote'argument.Experience in y
system where voting is compulsory
leads me to question the wisdom of
adopting the "riyht not to vote" men
tality.
The idea that not voting registers a
dissatisfaction with all candidates is a
spurious and naive suggestion. This
negative form of protest can only be
detrimental to the conduct of a democ
racy in that it weakens,
not strengthens, the power of the

people to cGniroi its politicians.
The politician who knows that only
a minority of potential voters will ac
tually vote tailors hie campaign ac
cordingly. Logically, only those voters
actively supporting the candidate will
vote so the politician need not articu
late specific and comprehensive prog
rams that would affect all voters. The
results are clear: the candidate satisfies
himself with establishing positions on
issues of concern to the groups who do
traditionally vote.
Now come the complaints. Neither
candidate is being specific, say some:
they're both the same, say others. Still
others will say that neither candidate
deserves the presidency.
Surely, if politicians are not being
specific on issues, if they both head for
middle-ground, if they don't de
monstrate the strengths voters think
they should have, then the voters
themselves are at fault, not the politi
cians.

Imagine the delight, and the relief,
of a mediocre politician when Ik;
knows that a sizable proportion of po
tential, and potentially powerful, vot
ers are ignoring him. He no longer has
to justify his candidacy to people who,
by sheer force of numbers, could re
quire him to become specific and to
explain fully his positions.
Is this a responsible way to participate
in a democracy? Surely it is crucial
that every voter declares his or her in
tention to vote, if only to inform the
politicians that they will have to ad
dress themselves to the whole electo
rate. and not just the groups who have
something to gain by voting a particu
lar politician into office.
The message is clear: if you want
better politicians you've got to show
your concern by declaringan intention
to vote.

Yesterday, the Daily published a
Stanford URPE statement, "Foley
'dumping' part of larger campaign."
This statement was first drafted by a
committee of four URPE members,
then reworked by a general open meet
ing of 25 URPE members and finalized
by a delegated committee of six.
