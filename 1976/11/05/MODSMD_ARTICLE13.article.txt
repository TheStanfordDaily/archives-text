## Large election turnout puts Carter on top Local results defy trends 
### 
From the Associated Press
Jimmy Carter said that a large
voter turnout would help him
gain the White House. He appa
rently was right. Of 17 states
where the percentage of voters
going to the polls was equal or
better than 1972, Carter won 13.
Carter's biggest block of elec
toral votes — 149 of the 297 he
gathered — came in his native
South which was the only region
where the percentage of voter
turnout increased from 1972 to
1976.
President Ford's biggest block
of electoral votes — 98 of the 241
he won — came in the West. That
area saw the biggest decrease in
the percentage of voter turnout
from 1972 to 1976.
During the last days of the
presidential campaign, both
Democrats and Republicans ex
pressed concern about reports
that fewer than half the eligible
• voters would go to the polls.
Both Carter and Ford urged
people to vote.
There are two ways of looking
at voter turnout: in terms of the
percentage of the eligible popu
lation that goes to the polls and
in terms of the actual number of
people voting.
The percentage turnout in the
South increased from 47 per cent
in 1972 to 49 per cent this year.

In the Northeast, the turnout de
creased from 58.5 per cent to
54.5 per cent of the eligible
population; in the North Central
area, the percentage of eligible
voters going to the polls went
from 60.7 to 59.6, and in the
West, the percentage of the vot
ing age population that balloted
declined from 59.4 to 52.1 per
cent.
The record of the South also
was the best when it came to
numbers alone. The number vot
ing increased by 13 per cent from
1 l )72 to 1976. The only other in
crease was in the North Central
area where the number of voters
grew by three per cent. The per
centage turnout declined be
cause the population increase
was greater than the increase in
the number of voters.
The number of voters in the
Northeast decreased by four per
cent from 1972 to 1976, and the
number of voters in the West
dropped bv three per cent.
The Associated Press com
pared 1972 and 1976 turnout
based on nearly complete unof
ficial returns. The returns do not
include all the minor party can
didates or all absentee ballots so
the final number of voters is cer
tain to be larger than the pre
liminary figures indicate. There
fore, a state was considered to

have a larger turnout in 1976
than in 1972 if the percentage of
the voting age population that
actually voted was greater than it
was four years ago, exactly equal
to the 1972 figure or no more
than half a per cent less than the
previous presidential turnout.
On a nationwide basis, voter
turnout was about 53 per cent of
the eligible population of 150
million persons. That was better
than some pollsters had ex
pected, but worse than in 1972
when the turnout was 55.4 per
cent. In fact, it was the poorest
turnout of any year since 194H
when 51.1 per cent of eligible
voters went to the polls.
An AP study, based on regist
ration figures provided by the
News Election Service, showed
that about 74 per cent of those
registered went out to vote this
year. Similar figures for 1972
were not available.
Curtis Cans of the Committee
for the Study of the American
Electorate — the group that orig
irially raised the possibility of a
very low turnout — said that an
even bigger turnout "probably"
would have helped Carter. He
said studies showed that people

who put off deciding whether
and how to vote until the last
minute, generally followed
party lines and registered Demo
crats far outnumber registered
Republicans.
The AP state-by-state break
down showed that Carter and his
running mate. Sen. Walter F.
Mondale of Minnesota, got out
the home state vote. In Carter's
home state of Georgia, where he
won by a 67 to 33 per cent mar
gin, 42.4 per cent of the eligible
voters went to the polls, up from
37.9 per cent four years ago. In
Minnesota, where the Democra
tic ticket was victorious, 56 to 42
per cent, the turnout was 70.6
per cent of the eligible voters, up
from 68.4 per cent in 1972.
In contrast, in Ford's home
state of Michigan, the percen
tage of voters going to the polls
actually declined from 1972 to
1976, down 1.6 percentage
points, although the President
won a 52-to-47 per cent victory.
In Kansas, home state of GOP
vice presidential nominee
Robert Dole, the Ford ticket won
by a 53 to 45 per cent margin.
The turnout was virtually the
same in 1972 and 1976, with pre

liminarv figures showing a de
cline of three-tenths of one per
cent.
The statistics showed that the
percentage of eligible voters
going to the polls increased from
1972 to 1976 in these states won
by Carter: Alabama. Arkansas,
Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Mis
souri, North Carolina, Texas,
South Carolina, Tennessee and
Wisconsin. The turnout was
considered to have increased in
these Ford states: lowa, Kansas,
Maine and Virginia.
California voters, as usual,
sent their political leaders mixed
signals with their ballots this
week.
There was an unmistakably
conservative tilt to the voting on
statewide races and ballot mea
sures. California gave its 45 pres
idential electors to Republican
Gerald Ford, elected a Republi
can U.S. senator and defeated a
liberal-backed ballot farm labor
proposition.
But liberal candidates as a
group did better than conserva
tives — and better than liberals
in past years — in local races for
Congress, the state Assembly

and state Senate.
California now has 29 Democ
rats and 14 Republicans in Con
gress, a new Democratic high. 57
Democrats and 23 Republicans
in the state Assembly, and 26
Democrats to 14 Republicans in
the state Senate.
The result, whether intended
or not, should be a slight shift to
the left in public policy. That's
because it is Congress and the
legislature which make the laws
and set public policy.
California Democrats gained
seats Tuesday in the state Senate
and Assembly and Congress,ad
ding to already big margins and
totally frustrating Republican
hopes — which perhaps were
never realistic — of recouping
their Watergate scandal losses of
1974.
Even a Democratic scandal
didn't help theCOP inCalifornia
this year, although California
Democrats crossed party lines by
the millions to vote for Republi
cans Gerald Ford for President
and S.I. Hayakawa for the U.S.
Senate.
The dichotomy between votes
for Democrats in local elections

and Republicans in statewide
and national offices is not new in
California, or the nation
On the national level, Repub
licans have occupied the White
House for 16 of the last 24 years,
and Democrats have controlled
Congress for 22 of the same 24
years. On the state level Califor
nians elected Republican
Ronald Reagan to two terms as
governor, and gave him a Demo
cratic legislature for six of those
eight years.
However, the lineup after
Tuesday's election does not
create the kind of conflict in
those earlier races.
liecause California went
against the national tide in the
presidential election, its 2U
Democrats in Congress will find
a President of the same party in
Jimmy Carter.
Hayakawa's victory over
Democratic incumbent John
Tunney is one of the few Democ
ratic setbacks nationwide. The
new division in the U.S. Senate
is 62 Democrats and 38 Republi
cans, the same as at present, -al
though with new faces on both
sides.
