# Commission orders end to phone rate timings

### 
San Francisco (AP) —The
state Public Utilities Commis
sion has ordered Pacific Tele
phone to eliminate all residen
ti.il single-message rate timing
within five days.
The PIJC said in its 3-2 deci
sion that it is "unreasonable" to
continue using the time factor in
figuring charges' for the so-called
lifeline 30 message unit or 60
message unit residential service.
Under the single-message
rate, each five minutes or frac
tion of a minute of a local call is
charged as one message unit.
These are applied toward the 30
or 60 message unit allowance.
Once the allowance is used up,
an extra five-cent charge is made
for each five minutes.
, A 1974 PIJC order authorized
adoption of that system for all
Pacific Telephone customers ex
cept flat rate residential custom
ers. However, the program was
not instituted until June when
timing of calls was started in
East San Francisco Bay, Orange
County, San Diego and
peripheral areas of Los Angeles.
Donald McLaughlin, a Pacific
Telephone vice president, said
its revenues will be reduced $5
million by the PIJC' order, which
does not affect timing of busi
ness service in those areas.
Another PUCaction penalized
Pacific Telephone for "failing to

meet its public service obliga
tion," alleging it made budget
cuts that resulted in delays —
more than HO days in Northern
California — in filling requests
for new or better service.
It reduced the company's al
lowable rate of return by .007 per
cent until the utility shows its
service orders are within normal
limits — 33 days.
The revenue cut, amounting to
$740,000, is to be achieved by
reducing phone installation
charges.
Both actions are interim deci
sions in Pacific Telephone's cur
rent $119 million rate increase
application.
The commission also ordered
Pacific Telephone to use a tone
signal when required monitor
ing is done on repair and
maintenance work.
