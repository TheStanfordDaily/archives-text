# UC appeals to court
## 
### 
The University of California
today asked the U.S. Supreme
Court to stay, pending appeal, a
state court ruling that special
minority admissions programs
are unconstitutional.
Justice William H. Rehnquist
asked that a response be filed by
next Wednesday.
In Berkeley, Sarah Molla of the
UC staff said the high court is
being asked to delay enforce
ment of the state ruling pending
the filing of a formal appeal now
being prepared.
She said UC has until mid-
December to file the formal ap
peal.
The California Supreme Court
ruled Sept. 16 in a case brought
by a white medical school
applicant that the UC special
admissions programs were un
constitutional because they gave
special preference on the basis of
race to minority applicants.
The state high court refused to
rehear the case last Thursday

and declined to grant a stay in
implementing its decision. It or
dered the IJC-Davis medical
school to admit Allan Bakke,
who had claimed he was denied
admission because he was
white.
Bakke applied for admission
to the medical school in 1973
and 1974 and was rejected both
years. There were 2,644 first

year applicants for 100 openings
in 1973 and 3,737 in 1974. Six
teen slots were filled each year
under the special admissions
programs for minorities.
Bakke, 36, now is an engineer
in Sunnyvale.
UC said Bakke has made no
attempt to gain admittance since
the state court decision.
