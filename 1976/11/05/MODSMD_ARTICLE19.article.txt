# Food prices to rise again
## 
### 
Eat at home if you want to save
money on food, says a new Ag
riculture Department look at the
nation's food market.
For all of 1976, the depart
ment's Outlook and Situation
Hoard says, prices for meals and
snacks in restaurants and fast
food outlets will average about
seven per cent higher than the
1975 average.
At the same time, prices of
store-bought food for eating at
home should come out about 2.5
per cent higher, it said.
Labor and utility cost in
creases are the principal culprits
in both cases, officials said, not
ing that the farm value of foods

produced on U.S. farms is ex
pected to average four per cent
below last year's average.
Constantly rising prices for
coffee, an imported food, throw
the scales off a bit, but the board
said:
"Increases in retail food prices
this year mainly reflect wider
farm-to-retail spreads as well as
the sharply higher prices for cof
fee and fishery products."
The USDA forecasters made
no changes in this latest report in
their main prediction: an over
all 1976 average increase in re
tail food prices of three per cent,
including levels in these closing
months only one or two per cent

above late-1975 levels.
Next year, the outlook is still
for prices two to four percent
above the January-June 1976 av
erages.
Large supplies of both crop
derived food supplies and meat
are dampening retail price in
creases, the board said.
The portion of the price attri
buted to middlemen's costs and
profits is expected to average
five per cent higher this year
than last, "well under the in
creases of the previous two years
and a little below the rate of gen
eral inflation," which has been
around six per cent.
The improved economy's

spurring of consumer demand
and the large food supplies are
pushing American consumption
rates to near the 1972 record, the
hoard added. A five per cent rise
in the amount of red meat eaten
per person and a nine per cent
rise in poultry consumption are
primarily responsible.
In the months of July through
September, total spending for
food at home and away from
home rose at about the same
pace, the report said.
However, compared to a year
earlier, the at-home spending
was up 5.5 per cent while the
eating-out expense was up 11
per cent.

Next year, the outlook is still
for prices two to four percent
above the January-June 1976 av
erages.
Large supplies of both crop
derived food supplies and meat
are dampening retail price in
creases, the board said.
The portion of the price attri
buted to middlemen's costs and
profits is expected to average
five per cent higher this year
than last, "well under the in
creases of the previous two years
and a little below the rate of gen
eral inflation," which has been
around six per cent.
The improved economy's

spurring of consumer demand
and the large food supplies are
pushing American consumption
rates to near the 1972 record, the
hoard added. A five per cent rise
in the amount of red meat eaten
per person and a nine per cent
rise in poultry consumption are
primarily responsible.
In the months of July through
September, total spending for
food at home and away from
home rose at about the same
pace, the report said.
However, compared to a year
earlier, the at-home spending
was up 5.5 per cent while the
eating-out expense was up 11
per cent.
Eat at home if you want to save
money on food, says a new Ag
riculture Department look at the
nation's food market.
For all of 1976, the depart
ment's Outlook and Situation
Hoard says, prices for meals and
snacks in restaurants and fast
food outlets will average about
seven per cent higher than the
1975 average.
At the same time, prices of
store-bought food for eating at
home should come out about 2.5
per cent higher, it said.
Labor and utility cost in
creases are the principal culprits
in both cases, officials said, not
ing that the farm value of foods

produced on U.S. farms is ex
pected to average four per cent
below last year's average.
Constantly rising prices for
coffee, an imported food, throw
the scales off a bit, but the board
said:
"Increases in retail food prices
this year mainly reflect wider
farm-to-retail spreads as well as
the sharply higher prices for cof
fee and fishery products."
The USDA forecasters made
no changes in this latest report in
their main prediction: an over
all 1976 average increase in re
tail food prices of three per cent,
including levels in these closing
months only one or two per cent

above late-1975 levels.
