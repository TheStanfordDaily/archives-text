# At Pear Williams'....
## Unique entrees set mood 
### Nancy Wilson 
Pear William's in Menlo Park is a young
restaurant (less than a year old). It also
boasts one of the youngest chefs of conti
nental cuisine in the area. Similarly, the
menu at Pear William's is still growing, but
plans are being made for a "final" version
which will appear in a few weeks.
Despite its youth, Pear William's man
ages to present a fine selection of innovative
dishes. And the atmosphere is much more
casual than many local continental restaur
ants. A major factor in setting the mood is
the interior design which was inherited
from the building's previous owners. All of
the tables are done in wood with beautiful
grains, and no two tables are identical. Each
has its own design or its own combination
of wood. Each table leg is different, and each
partition between booths is different. The
panorama in wood carving at theentrance is
perhaps the prettiest.
Beyond the natural wood interior, Pear
William's offers a simple, straightforward
menu. All dinners come with the house
soup and salad. The soup du jour was a
creamy garden vegetable type, and salad

was served topped with walnuts and a
house dressing. Both were tasty, but not ex
ceptional. Apertifs are listed right on the
menu, including sherry, Dubonnet, red
vermouth and Amontillado ($.75 each).
The entrees present an interesting choice.
None of the selections is commonplace.
Starting off there is Foie u la Cunudienne (a
liver dish), Chicken Kiev, Filet of Soel Car
ville, Brochette de Coquille Suint-Jacques
Mornay, Escullopes de Veuu Brillat-
Scivarin and Tournudos de Boeuf. The
prices range from $6 to $8 and the new
menu will include another dish or two in
the $7 range.
We opted for the Filet of Sole Carville and
the Escallopes de Veuu. It certainly was a
new taste experience. The filet of sole was
curled like a jelly roll, stuffed inside with a
delicious mushroom sauce. On top of the
roll was a Sauce Aurore, which had a touch
of sweetness in it, like applesauce. To pick
up on this flavor combination, a puff pastry
accompanied the fish and had some
applesauce filling in the bottom. But for the
fact that the air-conditioning vent was right
overhead, making my fish nearly cold

within minutes, it was a very nice entree. I
also noticed that the side vegetables were
particularly tasty.
My guest ordered the Escallopes de Veciu
Brillut-Savarin. This is one of the more ex
pensive entrees and is made with a savory
sauce of brandy, mushrooms and cream all
simmered together. The mixture of flavors
was subtle and very satisfying.
The dessert selection was limited to the
house specialty (The Pear William), La Dac
quoise and several varieties of Bud's ice
cream.
The Pear William is truly a unique mix
ture of flavors and textures. On top of a
scoop of French vanilla ice cream sits a
poached pear half covered with a caramel
cream sauce. The pear is in slices, and from
being poached has a soft but firm grainy
texture. The grainy pear, plus the smooth
ice cream and the slightly thick and very
rich sauce is a different dessert (and it costs
$1.10). We didn't try La Ducquoise, but it's
meringue on raspberry ice cream with a
strawberry cream sauce. And of course, the
bittersweet chocolate ice cream from Bud's
was delicious.
