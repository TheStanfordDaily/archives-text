Fame makes a man think things over -David Bowie

In a little over two weeks voters will go to the polls to
cast their ballots again. But the peanut shucker from
Ceorgia and the former All-American center from
Michigan won't be listed on the ballot.
University of Southern California tailback Ricky Bell
and Pittsburgh running back Tony Dorsett are locked in
a head-to-head battle for the nation's 42nd Heisman
Trophy.
Bell limps into Stanford Stadium tomorrow afternoon
as the nation s leading rusher (164.9 yards per game)
and top all-purpose runner (176,0 yards agame),despite
missing about half ot the Trojans' last two contests. He's
also the nation's leading scorer (10.6 points per game).
Bell's statistics read like a script from the Bionic Man.
In seven games Bell has gained 1154 yards, scored 12
touchdowns, averaged 5.6 yards to carry and caught a
dozen passes.
Missed record
It was only a bewildered statistician which kept Bell
Irom setting a new NCAA single game rushing mark in
USC's 23-14 victory over Washington State last month.
Bell s 347 rushing yards fell three short of breaking
Michigan State running back Eric (The Flea) Allen's
NCAA single-game mark, set against Purdue in 1971. A
confused Cougar statistician told lirst-yearTrojan coach
John Robinson that Bell had broken Allen's record, so
Robinson removed his star and congratulated him.
The error was not discovered until after the game, but
Bell was not angry. "The only reason I feel bad is be
cause you guys (the press) feel bad. I'm not disap
pointed: you guys are more disappointed than I am,"
Bell said after his performance.
"I m running out of words to describe him . . . can
yoij think of any?," said Robinson after the contest. "He
may be the greatest ever to play the game."
Tough runner
Bell has piled up enough testimonials from opposing

coaches to hold his own television roast. Said Cougar
coach Jackie Sherrill after Bell just missed the NCAA
mark. "I've never seen a running back so physical in all
my life. He'll last as long as they give him the ball."
Oregon State head coach Craig Fertig, a USC assistant
for 10 years, saw Bell from the other side of the field in
the Trojans' 56-0 romp over the Beavers. "Bell's the best
back in the United States . . . for power, speed and
guts, said F-ertig, who tutored O.J. Simpson and An
thony Davis. "Bell's got my (Heisman) vote twice. He's
as good a player as USC has ever had.
"I think O.J. is probably faster, but Ricky is stronger,"
said Fertig. They're the same type of people — that's
what makes them great backs. They're intelligent run
ners. They know the defense, they know where their
blocking's coming from, and take it as an insult if you
tackle them."
Bell a target
Defenses have been keying on Bell ever since he
gained 256 yards in the first game last year. But of
course anyone who carries the ball 50 times a game is
open to almost any physical abuse except target prac
tice.
"It seems Jike the more I play," said Bell, "the more
cheap shots people take at me. But maybe that's just my
imagination."
Bell, who entered last week's USC-Cal encounter with
a hip pointer, left the game midway through the third
quarter with a sprained ankle. He still managed to gain
78 yards on 24 carries and scored the first touchdown in
the Trojans' 20-6 victory over the Bears.
Played linebacker
But Bell, who as a freshman started at linebacker on
I JSC's 1974 national championship squad, can be just as
physical.
"I took him out of the Purdue game when we found
that his shoulder had been knocked out of the socket,"
said Robinson. "He jammed it back in with the other
hand and said, 'Why did you take me out."

"He's so damn tough it's frightening. He's never had
that 'Let me out of the gamefor a play, I'm hurting look.'
I told him to give me a sign when he wants to come out
— but henevergives methedamn sign," said Robinson.
Dorsett, Bell's Heisman rival, said this week, "I'll be
personally insulted if I don't win the Heisman this
year."
But Bell doesn't care about post-season individual
glory. "My main goal this year is to win and go to the
Rose Bowl," said Bell. "If I just wanted individual ac
complishments, I'd go play tennis. That's a one man
sport as far as I'm concerned. Records don't mean any
thing when you're losing."
Celebrity
Bell became a superstar last season when he fell just
six yards short of Cornell running back Ed Marinaro's
NCAA single season rushing record of 1881 yards.
"I really like to be introduced for myself," said Bell.
"It still annoys me when my friends introduce me: 'This
is Ricky Bell, the USC tailback.'
"When I read descriptions of myself and my
background — like you see about movie stars — it
sounds like something out of a story book," said Bell.
"I've always been a little shy and I'm still a little like
that. All this fame sounds sort of si 1 ly. I remember where
I started from and I don't t hi nk this fame will change me.
I'ootball is still a dream and I'm living in a fantasy
world."
But wait a minute. Surely there's got to be some flaw
in Ricky Bell, Does he refuse to sign autographs? Can he
do the latest disco fad? Did he vote for President Ford?
"When people ask you about Ricky Bell, it's easy to
get involved in a lot of adjectives," Robinson said, "and
I don't like to keep saying nice things just for the sake of
saying them. But in my experience as a football coach —
17 years — he has no peer, either as a player or as a
man."
Now what candidate can honestly make that claim.
