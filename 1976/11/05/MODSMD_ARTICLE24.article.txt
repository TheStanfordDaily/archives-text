# Win over SC essential
## Card bowl chances slim 
### David Georgette 
Times have changed, that's for
sure. In the past few years, a
Stanford victory over USC
would have catapulted the Car
dinals right into serious consid
eration for that trip to Pasadena
on January 1, Card backers
would be sent scrambling for
hotel accommodations for New
Year's in Southern California
while the Stanford Band would
be choreographing its antics for
the parade down Colorado
Boulevard.
A Stanford triumph tomor
row, though, probably won't
send the Cards to the Rose Bowl
this year because of fifteen mi
nutes and three deflected passes
four weeks ago against UCLA.
However, the stakes are still
high. "It's our biggest game of
the year," said Stanford head
coach Jack Christiansen. Kick
off is at 1:30.
It is also 4th ranked USC's
biggest game of the year so far.
Should the 12-point favorite Tr
ojans get upset, only a UCLA loss
to one of the Oregon schools
would give the Trojans a shot at

the Rose Bowl.
"We realize that we have to
win the game if we want to stay
in the running," said USC's
first-year head coach, John
Robinson, who took over the
Trojans this season. After 16 sea
sons at USC, Stanford arch
nemesis John McKay decided to
take the money and run to the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the
NFL.
Competitive teams
Even with McKay gone, Chris
tiansen said, "There's still as
much competition between the
two schools. The rivalry is jtill
what it was."
Robinson served as McKay's
offensive coordinator from 1972
to 1974 before coaching with the
Oakland Raiders for a season last
year, so he is familiar with
Stanford-USC confrontations.
"It's one of the great games in
college football," said Robinson.
"I'm not sure whether Stanford
plays over its head against us or
just below its potential the rest of
the time."
Stanford better be playing
over its head against the Trojans

because, according to Christian
sen, "They're bigger, stronger,
and quicker than what we've
seen. "Because of their size, they
physically wear you down."
Chris said that after awhile, it
can resemble "a Mack truck beat
ing on a VW."
Potent offense
The Trojans are ranked first in
the Pacific-8 in team offense and
scoring with an average of 475.1
yards and almost 39 points a
game.
Tailback Ricky Bell is the na
tion's leading rusher with an av
erage of 164.8 yards per contest
over seven games. Bell has a
banged-up left side, and if he is
not ready to go all the way,
freshmen phenom Charles
White will get the call.
"He has done an outstanding
job in backing Bell up," said
Robinson. "White is a very good
and exciting back. Of course,
he's got the good fortune of com
ing in after Bell when the other
team is worn down." Christian
sen said White "is as scary as
hell."

Another reason the Trojans are
rolling up the points this year is
the improved play of quarter
back Vince Evans. Last season
Evans completed only 31 per
cent of his passes. This year he is
connecting on 55 per cent of his
tosses.
"We started this season with
the idea we'd have to be able to
pass,'' said Robinson. "If you get
caught in a one-dimensional of
fense, you're going to lose. Evans
has done a very good job. I think
he's a very good quarterback."
The Trojans are ranked first in
Pac-8 overall team defense and
rushing defense, but are listed
sixth against the pass. Robinson
said he hopes USC can apply
"steady pressure" on defense in
order to contain Guy Benjamin,
the second leading passer in the
country with 21.3 completions
per game. Robinson simply cal
led Benjamin a "great, great pas
ser."
Double coverage
Christiansen said that USC
"reads things very well on de
fense." He expects the Cardinals
to encounter double coverage on
the wide receivers, adding,
"We've got to get the ball to the
backs and the tight end."
The last thing Chris needs to
worry about is a lackadaisical
mental approach to the game by
his team. "I think it's just going
to be a matter of calming them
down," he said.
Should the Cards win, they'll
stand a reasonable chance of
sharing the conference title, and.
at least, a flicker of hope for the
Rose Bowl will remain. "While it
is a slim chance, well, hell, it's
still a chance," said Christian
sen. "In the nine years I've been
here, the philosophy to get to the
Rose Bowl has been to throw the
ball and beat SC."
Tomorrow Stanford will have
the opportunity to do both.
"You've got to be optimistic,"
said Christiansen.

sons at USC, Stanford arch
nemesis John McKay decided to
take the money and run to the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the
NFL.
Competitive teams
Even with McKay gone, Chris
tiansen said, "There's still as
much competition between the
two schools. The rivalry is jtill
what it was."
Robinson served as McKay's
offensive coordinator from 1972
to 1974 before coaching with the
Oakland Raiders for a season last
year, so he is familiar with
Stanford-USC confrontations.
"It's one of the great games in
college football," said Robinson.
"I'm not sure whether Stanford
plays over its head against us or
just below its potential the rest of
the time."
Stanford better be playing
over its head against the Trojans

because, according to Christian
sen, "They're bigger, stronger,
and quicker than what we've
seen. "Because of their size, they
physically wear you down."
Chris said that after awhile, it
can resemble "a Mack truck beat
ing on a VW."
Potent offense
The Trojans are ranked first in
the Pacific-8 in team offense and
scoring with an average of 475.1
yards and almost 39 points a
game.
Tailback Ricky Bell is the na
tion's leading rusher with an av
erage of 164.8 yards per contest
over seven games. Bell has a
banged-up left side, and if he is
not ready to go all the way,
freshmen phenom Charles
White will get the call.
"He has done an outstanding
job in backing Bell up," said
Robinson. "White is a very good
and exciting back. Of course,
he's got the good fortune of com
ing in after Bell when the other
team is worn down." Christian
sen said White "is as scary as
hell."

Another reason the Trojans are
rolling up the points this year is
the improved play of quarter
back Vince Evans. Last season
Evans completed only 31 per
cent of his passes. This year he is
connecting on 55 per cent of his
tosses.
"We started this season with
the idea we'd have to be able to
pass,'' said Robinson. "If you get
caught in a one-dimensional of
fense, you're going to lose. Evans
has done a very good job. I think
he's a very good quarterback."
The Trojans are ranked first in
Pac-8 overall team defense and
rushing defense, but are listed
sixth against the pass. Robinson
said he hopes USC can apply
"steady pressure" on defense in
order to contain Guy Benjamin,
the second leading passer in the
country with 21.3 completions
per game. Robinson simply cal
led Benjamin a "great, great pas
ser."
Double coverage
Christiansen said that USC
"reads things very well on de
fense." He expects the Cardinals
to encounter double coverage on
the wide receivers, adding,
"We've got to get the ball to the
backs and the tight end."
The last thing Chris needs to
worry about is a lackadaisical
mental approach to the game by
his team. "I think it's just going
to be a matter of calming them
down," he said.
Should the Cards win, they'll
stand a reasonable chance of
sharing the conference title, and.
at least, a flicker of hope for the
Rose Bowl will remain. "While it
is a slim chance, well, hell, it's
still a chance," said Christian
sen. "In the nine years I've been
here, the philosophy to get to the
Rose Bowl has been to throw the
ball and beat SC."
Tomorrow Stanford will have
the opportunity to do both.
"You've got to be optimistic,"
said Christiansen.
Times have changed, that's for
sure. In the past few years, a
Stanford victory over USC
would have catapulted the Car
dinals right into serious consid
eration for that trip to Pasadena
on January 1, Card backers
would be sent scrambling for
hotel accommodations for New
Year's in Southern California
while the Stanford Band would
be choreographing its antics for
the parade down Colorado
Boulevard.
A Stanford triumph tomor
row, though, probably won't
send the Cards to the Rose Bowl
this year because of fifteen mi
nutes and three deflected passes
four weeks ago against UCLA.
However, the stakes are still
high. "It's our biggest game of
the year," said Stanford head
coach Jack Christiansen. Kick
off is at 1:30.
It is also 4th ranked USC's
biggest game of the year so far.
Should the 12-point favorite Tr
ojans get upset, only a UCLA loss
to one of the Oregon schools
would give the Trojans a shot at

the Rose Bowl.

win the game if we want to stay
in the running," said USC's
first-year head coach, John
Robinson, who took over the

tion's leading rusher with an av
erage of 164.8 yards per contest
over seven games. Bell has a
banged-up left side, and if he is
not ready to go all the way,
freshmen phenom Charles
White will get the call.
"He has done an outstanding
job in backing Bell up," said
Robinson. "White is a very good
and exciting back. Of course,
he's got the good fortune of com
ing in after Bell when the other
team is worn down." Christian
sen said White "is as scary as
hell."

Another reason the Trojans are
rolling up the points this year is
the improved play of quarter
back Vince Evans. Last season
Evans completed only 31 per
cent of his passes. This year he is
connecting on 55 per cent of his
tosses.
"We started this season with
the idea we'd have to be able to
pass,'' said Robinson. "If you get
caught in a one-dimensional of
fense, you're going to lose. Evans
has done a very good job. I think
he's a very good quarterback."
The Trojans are ranked first in
Pac-8 overall team defense and
rushing defense, but are listed
sixth against the pass. Robinson
said he hopes USC can apply
"steady pressure" on defense in
order to contain Guy Benjamin,
the second leading passer in the
country with 21.3 completions
per game. Robinson simply cal
led Benjamin a "great, great pas
ser."
Double coverage
Christiansen said that USC
"reads things very well on de
fense." He expects the Cardinals
to encounter double coverage on
the wide receivers, adding,
"We've got to get the ball to the
backs and the tight end."
The last thing Chris needs to
worry about is a lackadaisical
mental approach to the game by
his team. "I think it's just going
to be a matter of calming them
down," he said.
Should the Cards win, they'll
stand a reasonable chance of
sharing the conference title, and.
at least, a flicker of hope for the
Rose Bowl will remain. "While it
is a slim chance, well, hell, it's
still a chance," said Christian
sen. "In the nine years I've been
here, the philosophy to get to the
Rose Bowl has been to throw the
ball and beat SC."
Tomorrow Stanford will have
the opportunity to do both.
"You've got to be optimistic,"
said Christiansen.
Times have changed, that's for
sure. In the past few years, a
Stanford victory over USC
would have catapulted the Car
dinals right into serious consid
eration for that trip to Pasadena
on January 1, Card backers
would be sent scrambling for
hotel accommodations for New
Year's in Southern California
while the Stanford Band would
be choreographing its antics for
the parade down Colorado
Boulevard.
A Stanford triumph tomor
row, though, probably won't
send the Cards to the Rose Bowl
this year because of fifteen mi
nutes and three deflected passes
four weeks ago against UCLA.
However, the stakes are still
high. "It's our biggest game of
the year," said Stanford head
coach Jack Christiansen. Kick
off is at 1:30.
It is also 4th ranked USC's
biggest game of the year so far.
Should the 12-point favorite Tr
ojans get upset, only a UCLA loss
to one of the Oregon schools
would give the Trojans a shot at

the Rose Bowl.
"We realize that we have to
win the game if we want to stay
in the running," said USC's
first-year head coach, John
Robinson, who took over the
Trojans this season. After 16 sea
sons at USC, Stanford arch
nemesis John McKay decided to
take the money and run to the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the
NFL.
Competitive teams
Even with McKay gone, Chris
tiansen said, "There's still as
much competition between the
two schools. The rivalry is jtill
what it was."
Robinson served as McKay's
offensive coordinator from 1972
to 1974 before coaching with the
Oakland Raiders for a season last
year, so he is familiar with
Stanford-USC confrontations.
"It's one of the great games in
college football," said Robinson.
"I'm not sure whether Stanford
plays over its head against us or
just below its potential the rest of
the time."
Stanford better be playing
over its head against the Trojans

because, according to Christian
sen, "They're bigger, stronger,
and quicker than what we've
seen. "Because of their size, they
physically wear you down."
Chris said that after awhile, it
can resemble "a Mack truck beat
ing on a VW."
Potent offense
The Trojans are ranked first in
the Pacific-8 in team offense and
scoring with an average of 475.1
yards and almost 39 points a
game.
Tailback Ricky Bell is the na
tion's leading rusher with an av
erage of 164.8 yards per contest
over seven games. Bell has a
banged-up left side, and if he is
not ready to go all the way,
