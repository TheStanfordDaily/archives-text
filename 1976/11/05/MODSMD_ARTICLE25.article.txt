# Pac-8 predictions
## 
### 
The Daily's prognosticator is coming off a rare
perfect week, having hit on all four Pacific-8 games
last Saturday. His season mark now stands at 87.5
per cent. The wizard concedes that there haven't
been many upsets so far. This week could be diffe
rent. There's only one sure bet: the Oregon-UCLA
game.
Oregon, a team that might have trouble produc
ing a win in an intrasquad game, plays the third
ranked Bruins in Los Angeles Saturday. The only
question here is when UCLA's third-string players
will get into the game.
The big game of the weekend, of course, is USC
at Stanford. The Cards must win or drop completely
out of the Rose Bowl race. SC can lose and still be
in it. We don't think the Trojans will, though. They're
just too good.
We're not counting Stanford out, though. If all the

#
Cards play to their potential for four full quarters,
they can win. i
California is at Washington in a game that could
go either way. The Bears' exalted offense has failed
to score a touchdown in two of their last three
games. The Huskies, on the other hand, are still
running over people. Cat is favored, but we'll take
Washington.
Oregon State tackles Washington State at
Pullman, Wash., Saturday. There's absolutely no
thing riding on this game except maybe a few dol
lars. Look for the Cougars to win because Oregon
State is too beat up to play dominoes, much less
football.
