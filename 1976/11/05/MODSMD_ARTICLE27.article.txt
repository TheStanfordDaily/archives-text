# How Stanford, USC match up tomorrow
## 
### 
The series
USC holds a 34-18 edge over Stanford in
the 54-year series. There have been two ties.
In the last six years, both teams have won
three games each.
The Cards have beaten the Trojans just
twice in Stanford Stadium since I<W6. Jim
Plunkett and the Thunderchickens snapped
a 12-year USC streak, beating the Trojans
24-14 in 1970. That w*as the last time the
Cards beat USC here.
The coaches
USC — USe head coach John Robinson
has a 6-1-0 mark in his first year. Robinson
replaced John McKay, who left USC to coach
lampa Bay after 16 years as the winningest
coach in USC football history.
Stanford — Jack Christiansen is in his fifth
year at Stanford as the head coach. His re
cord over that time is 28-21-3 overall and
20-11-1 in the Pacific-8.
Passing
USC — One of Robinson's major goals this
season was a balanced offense. Last year USC
ranked last in conference passing stats,
largely due to quarterback Vince Evans' 31
per cent completion rate.
The Trojans, with an improved Evans and
back-up quarterback Rob Hertel at the helm,
are fourth in conference passing stats this
year with an average of 158.6 yards per
game.
Evans is passing at a 55 per cent rate this
year.
An improved nassinc uame has heloed

USC rank second in the nation in total of
fense (475.1 yards per game) and scoring
(37.6), behind first-ranked Michigan (479.0
and 44.0).
Stanford — As always, this is Stanford's
strongest point. Guy Benjamin is the second
leading passer in the country (21.3 comple
tions per game), and is regarded as a Heis
man Trophy candidate in 1977. Benjamin
can throw on any team in the nation, as
shown by his 236 passing yards against
Michigan and 366 against UCLA.
Benjamin has completed 58.7 per cent of
his passes this year for an average of 258
yards per game.
As everyone knows by now, Stanford has
plenty of depth at quarterback. Not many
teams have as their back-up QB the seventh
leading passer in school history. The Cards
do in Mike Cordova.
Conclusion—Stanford is clearly superior
to USC in the passing department.
Rushing
USC — Ricky Bell.
The All-American tailback is the NCAA's
leading rusher with 1154 yards on 207 car
ries. In seven games Bell has averaged 164.9
yards per contest, scored 12 touchdowns and
caught a dozen passes.
Although Bell has only played in about
half of the Irojans last two games, Robinson
said he'll probably start tomorrow. Before
leaving midway through the third quarter of
USC's 20-6 win over Cal last week with a
sprained ankle, he scored the Trojans' first

touchdown and still managed to gain 78
yards.
If Bell can't go tomorrow. Robinson has
the perfect hack-up in freshman tailback
Charles White. White led all rushers in the
Cal game, with 91 yards on 14 carries. He has
gained 493 yards, averaged seven yards per
carry and scored eight touchdowns this sea
son. USC also has powerful fullbacks in Mosi
Tatupu and Dave Farmer.
Stanford — This is a very mediocre unit.
The Card backs can run effectively on lesser
teams, but not on good ones. Against San
Jose State, Army, Washington State and Ore
gon State, Stanford averaged 46 rushes for
184 yards per game. Against Penn State,
Michigan, UCLA and Washington, the Cards
averaged 32 carries for just 92 yards.
Stanford has no strong outside threat and
no bruising fullback. Its leading rusher. Don
Stevenson (362 yards), is dependable if not
flashy. Ron Inge, the starting halfback, is a
better blocker than runner.
Conclusion—Stanford's not even in the same
ballpark with USC in the rushing department.
Receiving
USC — Wide receiver Randy Simmrin, the
only sophomore to start for USC last year,
had a remarkable season. Playing on a team
that completed only 35 percent of its passes.
Simmrin caught at least one pass in every
game.
This year Simmrin is having an even better
season. He has caught just 19 passes, but he's
averaging 20.6 yards a catch.

Flanker Shelton Diggs missed the Trojans'
last four games last year with a shoulder
injury, but he has come on strong this sea
son. He has grabbed 18 passes for 293 yards
and three touchdowns.
TheTrojans don't throw much to tight-end
Bill Gay.
Stanford — The Cards are talented and
deep here. They like to think they have the
best receiver in the country in Tony Hill, and
they may be right.
Hill, likely to be chosen in the first round
of the pro draft, has size, speed, moves and
hands. What else is there? This year, he has
caught 30 passes for 494 yards and five TDs.
Bill Kellar is the other starting wide re
ceiver. Kellar doesn't have great speed, but
can catch almost any pass thrown in his gen
eral vicinity. He's seventh in the Pac-8 with
28 receptions.
Stanford hasn't thrown too much to its
tight-end. Mark Hoaglin (12 catches), either.
Conclusion—Stanford has the slight edge in
receiving.
Defense
USC — After all owing 46 points to Mis
souri in their opening 46-25 loss, the Trojans
have given up only 33 points. USC has not
allowed a touchdown for eight quarters.
USC has gotten a good performance from
inside linebacker Eric Williams. The6-2,215
pound senior is the Trojans' leading tackier.
USC's rushing defense, ranked first in the
Pac-8, allowed Cal just 18 net yards last
week.

DSC has been just as good against the pass.
The Trojans have already intercepted 19
passes (against 17 all of last year).
Stanford — It's difficult to assess Stan
ford's defensive performance this year. The
unit has played well overall, but has been
susceptible to breakdowns such as in the
Army and Washington games.
Without question, the offense has put an
unreasonable amount of pressure on the de
fense by turning the ball over repeatedly.
This explains in part why Stanford has given
up an average of 24.4 points a game. Only in
the Michigan game, and possibly the Army
game, did the defense not play well enough
for Stanford to win.
Qmclusion—l JSC has a clear defensive edge.
Kicking game
USC — Senior Glenn Walker handles both
the place kicking and punting chores for
USC. The 24-year-old senior has hit six of 13
field goals this year.
At times last year. Walker's poor punting
hurt USC. This year he owns a 39.9 punting
average. Walker's longest is a 56-yarder.
Stanford — Mike Michel has hit on 10 of
20 field goal attempts and his punting aver
age is 39.5. Michel has not been able to kick
as well in games as he has in practice, when
he consistently booms HO to 65-vard field
goals, fie is unquestionably a pro prospect.
Conclusion—Give Stanford the kicking ad
vantage because of Michel's range.

year with an average of 158.6 yards per
game.
Evans is passing at a 55 per cent rate this
year.
An improved nassinc uame has heloed

USC rank second in the nation in total of
fense (475.1 yards per game) and scoring
(37.6), behind first-ranked Michigan (479.0
and 44.0).
Stanford — As always, this is Stanford's
strongest point. Guy Benjamin is the second
leading passer in the country (21.3 comple
tions per game), and is regarded as a Heis
man Trophy candidate in 1977. Benjamin
can throw on any team in the nation, as
shown by his 236 passing yards against
Michigan and 366 against UCLA.
Benjamin has completed 58.7 per cent of
his passes this year for an average of 258
yards per game.
As everyone knows by now, Stanford has
plenty of depth at quarterback. Not many
teams have as their back-up QB the seventh
leading passer in school history. The Cards
do in Mike Cordova.
Conclusion—Stanford is clearly superior
to USC in the passing department.
Rushing
USC — Ricky Bell.
The All-American tailback is the NCAA's
leading rusher with 1154 yards on 207 car
ries. In seven games Bell has averaged 164.9
yards per contest, scored 12 touchdowns and
caught a dozen passes.
Although Bell has only played in about
half of the Irojans last two games, Robinson
said he'll probably start tomorrow. Before
leaving midway through the third quarter of
USC's 20-6 win over Cal last week with a
sprained ankle, he scored the Trojans' first

touchdown and still managed to gain 78
yards.
If Bell can't go tomorrow. Robinson has
the perfect hack-up in freshman tailback
Charles White. White led all rushers in the
Cal game, with 91 yards on 14 carries. He has
gained 493 yards, averaged seven yards per
carry and scored eight touchdowns this sea
son. USC also has powerful fullbacks in Mosi
Tatupu and Dave Farmer.
Stanford — This is a very mediocre unit.
The Card backs can run effectively on lesser
teams, but not on good ones. Against San
Jose State, Army, Washington State and Ore
gon State, Stanford averaged 46 rushes for
184 yards per game. Against Penn State,
Michigan, UCLA and Washington, the Cards
averaged 32 carries for just 92 yards.
Stanford has no strong outside threat and
no bruising fullback. Its leading rusher. Don
Stevenson (362 yards), is dependable if not
flashy. Ron Inge, the starting halfback, is a
better blocker than runner.
Conclusion—Stanford's not even in the same
ballpark with USC in the rushing department.
Receiving
USC — Wide receiver Randy Simmrin, the
only sophomore to start for USC last year,
had a remarkable season. Playing on a team
that completed only 35 percent of its passes.
Simmrin caught at least one pass in every
game.
This year Simmrin is having an even better
season. He has caught just 19 passes, but he's
averaging 20.6 yards a catch.

Flanker Shelton Diggs missed the Trojans'
last four games last year with a shoulder
injury, but he has come on strong this sea
son. He has grabbed 18 passes for 293 yards
and three touchdowns.
TheTrojans don't throw much to tight-end
Bill Gay.
Stanford — The Cards are talented and
deep here. They like to think they have the
best receiver in the country in Tony Hill, and
they may be right.
Hill, likely to be chosen in the first round
of the pro draft, has size, speed, moves and
hands. What else is there? This year, he has
caught 30 passes for 494 yards and five TDs.
Bill Kellar is the other starting wide re
ceiver. Kellar doesn't have great speed, but
can catch almost any pass thrown in his gen
eral vicinity. He's seventh in the Pac-8 with
28 receptions.
Stanford hasn't thrown too much to its
tight-end. Mark Hoaglin (12 catches), either.
Conclusion—Stanford has the slight edge in
receiving.
Defense
USC — After all owing 46 points to Mis
souri in their opening 46-25 loss, the Trojans
have given up only 33 points. USC has not
allowed a touchdown for eight quarters.
USC has gotten a good performance from
inside linebacker Eric Williams. The6-2,215
pound senior is the Trojans' leading tackier.
USC's rushing defense, ranked first in the
Pac-8, allowed Cal just 18 net yards last
week.

DSC has been just as good against the pass.
The Trojans have already intercepted 19
passes (against 17 all of last year).
Stanford — It's difficult to assess Stan
ford's defensive performance this year. The
unit has played well overall, but has been
susceptible to breakdowns such as in the
Army and Washington games.
Without question, the offense has put an
unreasonable amount of pressure on the de
fense by turning the ball over repeatedly.
This explains in part why Stanford has given
up an average of 24.4 points a game. Only in
the Michigan game, and possibly the Army
game, did the defense not play well enough
for Stanford to win.
Qmclusion—l JSC has a clear defensive edge.
Kicking game
USC — Senior Glenn Walker handles both
the place kicking and punting chores for
USC. The 24-year-old senior has hit six of 13
field goals this year.
At times last year. Walker's poor punting
hurt USC. This year he owns a 39.9 punting
average. Walker's longest is a 56-yarder.
Stanford — Mike Michel has hit on 10 of
20 field goal attempts and his punting aver
age is 39.5. Michel has not been able to kick
as well in games as he has in practice, when
he consistently booms HO to 65-vard field
goals, fie is unquestionably a pro prospect.
Conclusion—Give Stanford the kicking ad
vantage because of Michel's range.

The series
USC holds a 34-18 edge over Stanford in
the 54-year series. There have been two ties.
In the last six years, both teams have won
three games each.
The Cards have beaten the Trojans just
twice in Stanford Stadium since I<W6. Jim
Plunkett and the Thunderchickens snapped
a 12-year USC streak, beating the Trojans
24-14 in 1970. That w*as the last time the
Cards beat USC here.
The coaches
USC — USe head coach John Robinson
has a 6-1-0 mark in his first year. Robinson
replaced John McKay, who left USC to coach
lampa Bay after 16 years as the winningest
coach in USC football history.
Stanford — Jack Christiansen is in his fifth
year at Stanford as the head coach. His re
cord over that time is 28-21-3 overall and
20-11-1 in the Pacific-8.
Passing
USC — One of Robinson's major goals this
season was a balanced offense. Last year USC
ranked last in conference passing stats,
largely due to quarterback Vince Evans' 31
per cent completion rate.
The Trojans, with an improved Evans and
back-up quarterback Rob Hertel at the helm,
are fourth in conference passing stats this
year with an average of 158.6 yards per
game.

ries. In seven games Bell has averaged 164.9
yards per contest, scored 12 touchdowns and
caught a dozen passes.
Although Bell has only played in about
half of the Irojans last two games, Robinson
said he'll probably start tomorrow. Before
leaving midway through the third quarter of
USC's 20-6 win over Cal last week with a
sprained ankle, he scored the Trojans' first

touchdown and still managed to gain 78
yards.
If Bell can't go tomorrow. Robinson has
the perfect hack-up in freshman tailback
Charles White. White led all rushers in the
Cal game, with 91 yards on 14 carries. He has
gained 493 yards, averaged seven yards per
carry and scored eight touchdowns this sea
son. USC also has powerful fullbacks in Mosi
Tatupu and Dave Farmer.
Stanford — This is a very mediocre unit.
The Card backs can run effectively on lesser
teams, but not on good ones. Against San
Jose State, Army, Washington State and Ore
gon State, Stanford averaged 46 rushes for
184 yards per game. Against Penn State,
Michigan, UCLA and Washington, the Cards
averaged 32 carries for just 92 yards.
Stanford has no strong outside threat and
no bruising fullback. Its leading rusher. Don
Stevenson (362 yards), is dependable if not
flashy. Ron Inge, the starting halfback, is a
better blocker than runner.
Conclusion—Stanford's not even in the same
ballpark with USC in the rushing department.
Receiving
USC — Wide receiver Randy Simmrin, the
only sophomore to start for USC last year,
had a remarkable season. Playing on a team
that completed only 35 percent of its passes.
Simmrin caught at least one pass in every
game.
This year Simmrin is having an even better
season. He has caught just 19 passes, but he's
averaging 20.6 yards a catch.

Flanker Shelton Diggs missed the Trojans'
last four games last year with a shoulder
injury, but he has come on strong this sea
son. He has grabbed 18 passes for 293 yards
and three touchdowns.
TheTrojans don't throw much to tight-end
Bill Gay.
Stanford — The Cards are talented and
deep here. They like to think they have the
best receiver in the country in Tony Hill, and
they may be right.
Hill, likely to be chosen in the first round
of the pro draft, has size, speed, moves and
hands. What else is there? This year, he has
caught 30 passes for 494 yards and five TDs.
Bill Kellar is the other starting wide re
ceiver. Kellar doesn't have great speed, but
can catch almost any pass thrown in his gen
eral vicinity. He's seventh in the Pac-8 with
28 receptions.
Stanford hasn't thrown too much to its
tight-end. Mark Hoaglin (12 catches), either.
Conclusion—Stanford has the slight edge in
receiving.
Defense
USC — After all owing 46 points to Mis
souri in their opening 46-25 loss, the Trojans
have given up only 33 points. USC has not
allowed a touchdown for eight quarters.
USC has gotten a good performance from
inside linebacker Eric Williams. The6-2,215
pound senior is the Trojans' leading tackier.
USC's rushing defense, ranked first in the
Pac-8, allowed Cal just 18 net yards last
week.

DSC has been just as good against the pass.
The Trojans have already intercepted 19
passes (against 17 all of last year).
Stanford — It's difficult to assess Stan
ford's defensive performance this year. The
unit has played well overall, but has been
susceptible to breakdowns such as in the
Army and Washington games.
Without question, the offense has put an
unreasonable amount of pressure on the de
fense by turning the ball over repeatedly.
This explains in part why Stanford has given
up an average of 24.4 points a game. Only in
the Michigan game, and possibly the Army
game, did the defense not play well enough
for Stanford to win.
Qmclusion—l JSC has a clear defensive edge.
Kicking game
USC — Senior Glenn Walker handles both
the place kicking and punting chores for
USC. The 24-year-old senior has hit six of 13
field goals this year.
At times last year. Walker's poor punting
hurt USC. This year he owns a 39.9 punting
average. Walker's longest is a 56-yarder.
Stanford — Mike Michel has hit on 10 of
20 field goal attempts and his punting aver
age is 39.5. Michel has not been able to kick
as well in games as he has in practice, when
he consistently booms HO to 65-vard field
goals, fie is unquestionably a pro prospect.
Conclusion—Give Stanford the kicking ad
vantage because of Michel's range.

The series
USC holds a 34-18 edge over Stanford in
the 54-year series. There have been two ties.
In the last six years, both teams have won
three games each.
The Cards have beaten the Trojans just
twice in Stanford Stadium since I<W6. Jim
Plunkett and the Thunderchickens snapped
a 12-year USC streak, beating the Trojans
24-14 in 1970. That w*as the last time the
Cards beat USC here.
The coaches
USC — USe head coach John Robinson
has a 6-1-0 mark in his first year. Robinson
replaced John McKay, who left USC to coach
lampa Bay after 16 years as the winningest
coach in USC football history.
Stanford — Jack Christiansen is in his fifth
year at Stanford as the head coach. His re
cord over that time is 28-21-3 overall and
20-11-1 in the Pacific-8.
Passing
USC — One of Robinson's major goals this
season was a balanced offense. Last year USC
ranked last in conference passing stats,
largely due to quarterback Vince Evans' 31
per cent completion rate.
The Trojans, with an improved Evans and
back-up quarterback Rob Hertel at the helm,
are fourth in conference passing stats this
year with an average of 158.6 yards per
game.
Evans is passing at a 55 per cent rate this
year.
An improved nassinc uame has heloed

USC rank second in the nation in total of
fense (475.1 yards per game) and scoring
(37.6), behind first-ranked Michigan (479.0
and 44.0).
Stanford — As always, this is Stanford's
strongest point. Guy Benjamin is the second
leading passer in the country (21.3 comple
tions per game), and is regarded as a Heis
man Trophy candidate in 1977. Benjamin
can throw on any team in the nation, as
shown by his 236 passing yards against
Michigan and 366 against UCLA.
Benjamin has completed 58.7 per cent of
his passes this year for an average of 258
yards per game.
As everyone knows by now, Stanford has
plenty of depth at quarterback. Not many
teams have as their back-up QB the seventh
leading passer in school history. The Cards
do in Mike Cordova.
Conclusion—Stanford is clearly superior
to USC in the passing department.

Stevenson (362 yards), is dependable if not
flashy. Ron Inge, the starting halfback, is a
better blocker than runner.
Conclusion—Stanford's not even in the same
ballpark with USC in the rushing department.
Receiving
USC — Wide receiver Randy Simmrin, the
only sophomore to start for USC last year,
had a remarkable season. Playing on a team
that completed only 35 percent of its passes.
Simmrin caught at least one pass in every
game.
This year Simmrin is having an even better
season. He has caught just 19 passes, but he's
averaging 20.6 yards a catch.

Flanker Shelton Diggs missed the Trojans'
last four games last year with a shoulder
injury, but he has come on strong this sea
son. He has grabbed 18 passes for 293 yards
and three touchdowns.
TheTrojans don't throw much to tight-end
Bill Gay.
Stanford — The Cards are talented and
deep here. They like to think they have the
best receiver in the country in Tony Hill, and
they may be right.
Hill, likely to be chosen in the first round
of the pro draft, has size, speed, moves and
hands. What else is there? This year, he has
caught 30 passes for 494 yards and five TDs.
Bill Kellar is the other starting wide re
ceiver. Kellar doesn't have great speed, but
can catch almost any pass thrown in his gen
eral vicinity. He's seventh in the Pac-8 with
28 receptions.
Stanford hasn't thrown too much to its
tight-end. Mark Hoaglin (12 catches), either.
Conclusion—Stanford has the slight edge in
receiving.
Defense
USC — After all owing 46 points to Mis
souri in their opening 46-25 loss, the Trojans
have given up only 33 points. USC has not
allowed a touchdown for eight quarters.
USC has gotten a good performance from
inside linebacker Eric Williams. The6-2,215
pound senior is the Trojans' leading tackier.
USC's rushing defense, ranked first in the
Pac-8, allowed Cal just 18 net yards last
week.

DSC has been just as good against the pass.
The Trojans have already intercepted 19
passes (against 17 all of last year).
Stanford — It's difficult to assess Stan
ford's defensive performance this year. The
unit has played well overall, but has been
susceptible to breakdowns such as in the
Army and Washington games.
Without question, the offense has put an
unreasonable amount of pressure on the de
fense by turning the ball over repeatedly.
This explains in part why Stanford has given
up an average of 24.4 points a game. Only in
the Michigan game, and possibly the Army
game, did the defense not play well enough
for Stanford to win.
Qmclusion—l JSC has a clear defensive edge.
Kicking game
USC — Senior Glenn Walker handles both
the place kicking and punting chores for
USC. The 24-year-old senior has hit six of 13
field goals this year.
At times last year. Walker's poor punting
hurt USC. This year he owns a 39.9 punting
average. Walker's longest is a 56-yarder.
Stanford — Mike Michel has hit on 10 of
20 field goal attempts and his punting aver
age is 39.5. Michel has not been able to kick
as well in games as he has in practice, when
he consistently booms HO to 65-vard field
goals, fie is unquestionably a pro prospect.
Conclusion—Give Stanford the kicking ad
vantage because of Michel's range.

The series
USC holds a 34-18 edge over Stanford in
the 54-year series. There have been two ties.
In the last six years, both teams have won
three games each.
The Cards have beaten the Trojans just
twice in Stanford Stadium since I<W6. Jim
Plunkett and the Thunderchickens snapped
a 12-year USC streak, beating the Trojans
24-14 in 1970. That w*as the last time the
Cards beat USC here.
The coaches
USC — USe head coach John Robinson
has a 6-1-0 mark in his first year. Robinson
replaced John McKay, who left USC to coach
lampa Bay after 16 years as the winningest
coach in USC football history.
Stanford — Jack Christiansen is in his fifth
year at Stanford as the head coach. His re
cord over that time is 28-21-3 overall and
20-11-1 in the Pacific-8.
Passing
USC — One of Robinson's major goals this
season was a balanced offense. Last year USC
ranked last in conference passing stats,
largely due to quarterback Vince Evans' 31
per cent completion rate.
The Trojans, with an improved Evans and
back-up quarterback Rob Hertel at the helm,
are fourth in conference passing stats this
year with an average of 158.6 yards per
game.
Evans is passing at a 55 per cent rate this
year.
An improved nassinc uame has heloed

USC rank second in the nation in total of
fense (475.1 yards per game) and scoring
(37.6), behind first-ranked Michigan (479.0
and 44.0).
Stanford — As always, this is Stanford's
strongest point. Guy Benjamin is the second
leading passer in the country (21.3 comple
tions per game), and is regarded as a Heis
man Trophy candidate in 1977. Benjamin
can throw on any team in the nation, as
shown by his 236 passing yards against
Michigan and 366 against UCLA.
Benjamin has completed 58.7 per cent of
his passes this year for an average of 258
yards per game.
As everyone knows by now, Stanford has
plenty of depth at quarterback. Not many
teams have as their back-up QB the seventh
leading passer in school history. The Cards
do in Mike Cordova.
Conclusion—Stanford is clearly superior
to USC in the passing department.
Rushing
USC — Ricky Bell.
The All-American tailback is the NCAA's
leading rusher with 1154 yards on 207 car
ries. In seven games Bell has averaged 164.9
yards per contest, scored 12 touchdowns and
caught a dozen passes.
Although Bell has only played in about
half of the Irojans last two games, Robinson
said he'll probably start tomorrow. Before
leaving midway through the third quarter of
USC's 20-6 win over Cal last week with a
sprained ankle, he scored the Trojans' first

touchdown and still managed to gain 78
yards.
If Bell can't go tomorrow. Robinson has
the perfect hack-up in freshman tailback
Charles White. White led all rushers in the
Cal game, with 91 yards on 14 carries. He has
gained 493 yards, averaged seven yards per
carry and scored eight touchdowns this sea
son. USC also has powerful fullbacks in Mosi
Tatupu and Dave Farmer.
Stanford — This is a very mediocre unit.
The Card backs can run effectively on lesser
teams, but not on good ones. Against San
Jose State, Army, Washington State and Ore
gon State, Stanford averaged 46 rushes for
184 yards per game. Against Penn State,
Michigan, UCLA and Washington, the Cards
averaged 32 carries for just 92 yards.
Stanford has no strong outside threat and
no bruising fullback. Its leading rusher. Don
Stevenson (362 yards), is dependable if not
flashy. Ron Inge, the starting halfback, is a
better blocker than runner.
Conclusion—Stanford's not even in the same
