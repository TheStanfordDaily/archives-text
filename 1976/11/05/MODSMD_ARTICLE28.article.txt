# Jackson rebounds from injuries
## Scotcher undeterred by rough frosh year 
### Debbie Carlton 
Sue Katharine "Sukie"
Jackson played only one half
of a game of the varsity field
hockey season her freshman
year due to a knee injury.
Now a junior playing in the
demanding link position,
she's making up for lost time.
One of the top scotchers'
leading scorers, Jackson is
praised by coach Shirley
Schoof for her strength, ag
gressiveness and intelligence
on the field. "She has a fine
concept of the game," stated
Schoof. "She knows what to
do with the ball and is always
there."
Jackson's stature (5-foot
-10) has also proven to be an
asset on both offense and de
fense. As Schoof points out,
"She can really reach for that
ball."
Jackson can laugh about
her freshman injury now, but
at the time it was a big disap
pointment. And for someone
who is, in the words of her
coach, "an excellent natural
athlete who possesses a great
spirit of competitiveness,"
sitting out an important athle
tic season wasn't easy.
P'acial stitches
Jackson might also have
looked to some other sport for
amusement after an espe
cially hard-driven ball struck
her above the eye, necessitat
ing fourteen stitches.
That accident, occurring in
her first Stanford hockey
game, plus the knee injury,
might have made someone
else feel helplessly
accident-prone. Not Jackson.
If anything, she feels it's all
out of her system, and she just
wants to play hockey.
Stanford's valued import
from Santa Fe, N.M. "played
all the sports" her high school
offered, competing in hockey,
basketball and tennis.
Hockey first
Jackson has played basket
ball for Stanford during
winter quarter, but is espe
cially devoted to the hockey
program. Like other members
of the team, she attributes
much of the Cards' success
and her individual enjoyment
of the game to a special affin
ity within the group.
"It is a totally good experi
enre," states Jackson. "We
have fun. we get crazy, but we

work well together too. We
spend a lot of time on hockey,
but it never seems like a lot of
time."
Jackson prefers hockey
over other sports for its mutu
ally supportive qualities.
"There are no statistics in
hockey, really, and no sub
stitutions. It's a team sport —
you all have to work to
gether." Although she admits
the presence of "some ego
problems," she is convinced
that they are less intense and
less obvious in hockey than in
some of the other sports in
which she's participated.
Jackson's assets as a hockey
player form an admirable list,
but she would never list
them. She is a very natural,
unassuming and enthusiastic
person as well as a natural
athlete. Combined, these
qualities make her, in
Schoof's estimation, "very
coachable, and a strong team

sports person. Sukie is an in
tegral part of whatever team
she is on. She is one of the
best-liked by players and
coaches alike."
Part of Jackson's love for
hockey comes from an ap
preciation for the outdoors,
an appreciation that was en
tensified last summer during
a month spent hiking and
mountain-climbing in Ore
gon. The most difficult por
tion of a rigorous experience,
she said, was the three days
spent solo, without any food.
"The lack of food didn't
bother me nearly as much as
the lack of people," Jackson
said. "I didn't like being
alone for that long — I'm not
sure I'd do it again."
Despite her expertise as a
hockey player, Jackson is not
presently planning her life
around the game, although
her love for sports in general
may lead to coaching teach

ing. "I'm not sure what I'm
doing," she laughed.

Scotchers top Davis
Stanford's scrappy S; .idl
ers plowed over the UC- Javis
Aggies Wednesday, harvest
ing a 4-0 victory from Roble
field.
The Cards were relentless
in their attack, keeping the
ball consistently in the Ag
gies' half of the field.
The Red and White would
have reaped more goals had it
not been for the Davis goalie's
sharp reactions. Not easily in
timidated, she deflected sev
eral potential Card goals be
fore link Onnie killefer drove
a hard corner shot into the
net.
Link Sukie Jackson, assist
ing on the first goal, dribbled
solo down the field to chal
lenge the Aggies' defense
again. With three minutes left
in the first half, Jackson shot,
and the ball glanced off the
goalie's hand for the second
goal.
The game slowed down at
the beginning of the second
half, as both teams circled the
field attempting in vain to
boost their scores. The in
creased pressure on Davis
forced players of both teams
to make hasty shots and
pa nic-stricken passes. The ac
tion smoothed out, and Stan
ford came back with a solid
shot by Killefer from the top
of the circle.
The scotchers saved their
specialty, swift and rhythmic
teamwork, for the grand
finale. Forward Mandy Read
led a sweep downfield, pas
sing to sophomore link Jessie
Gerrard. Gerrard capitalized
on Read's assist for the fourth
and final goal of the game.
Coach Shirley Schoof was
especially proud of the final
Card effort. Halfback Jane
Soyster, who played a "truly
magnificent" defensive game
according to Schoof, pointed
out that the last score was
"one of those times we did
everything right. Davis didn't
even get a chance to tough it."
The Cards' Kathy Levinson
was out the second half due to
illness, but is expected to see
action Friday when the
scotchers take on a top
ranked Chico State team at
Chico. J

out of her system, and she just
wants to play hockey.
Stanford's valued import
from Santa Fe, N.M. "played
all the sports" her high school
offered, competing in hockey,
basketball and tennis.
Hockey first
Jackson has played basket
ball for Stanford during
winter quarter, but is espe
cially devoted to the hockey
program. Like other members
of the team, she attributes
much of the Cards' success
and her individual enjoyment
of the game to a special affin
ity within the group.
"It is a totally good experi
enre," states Jackson. "We
have fun. we get crazy, but we

work well together too. We
spend a lot of time on hockey,
but it never seems like a lot of
time."
Jackson prefers hockey
over other sports for its mutu
ally supportive qualities.
"There are no statistics in
hockey, really, and no sub
stitutions. It's a team sport —
you all have to work to
gether." Although she admits
the presence of "some ego
problems," she is convinced
that they are less intense and
less obvious in hockey than in
some of the other sports in
which she's participated.
Jackson's assets as a hockey
player form an admirable list,
but she would never list
them. She is a very natural,
unassuming and enthusiastic
person as well as a natural
athlete. Combined, these
qualities make her, in
Schoof's estimation, "very
coachable, and a strong team

sports person. Sukie is an in
tegral part of whatever team
she is on. She is one of the
best-liked by players and
coaches alike."
Part of Jackson's love for
hockey comes from an ap
preciation for the outdoors,
an appreciation that was en
tensified last summer during
a month spent hiking and
mountain-climbing in Ore
gon. The most difficult por
tion of a rigorous experience,
she said, was the three days
spent solo, without any food.
"The lack of food didn't
bother me nearly as much as
the lack of people," Jackson
said. "I didn't like being
alone for that long — I'm not
sure I'd do it again."
Despite her expertise as a
hockey player, Jackson is not
presently planning her life
around the game, although
her love for sports in general
may lead to coaching teach

ing. "I'm not sure what I'm
doing," she laughed.

Scotchers top Davis
Stanford's scrappy S; .idl
ers plowed over the UC- Javis
Aggies Wednesday, harvest
ing a 4-0 victory from Roble
field.
The Cards were relentless
in their attack, keeping the
ball consistently in the Ag
gies' half of the field.
The Red and White would
have reaped more goals had it
not been for the Davis goalie's
sharp reactions. Not easily in
timidated, she deflected sev
eral potential Card goals be
fore link Onnie killefer drove
a hard corner shot into the
net.
Link Sukie Jackson, assist
ing on the first goal, dribbled
solo down the field to chal
lenge the Aggies' defense
again. With three minutes left
in the first half, Jackson shot,
and the ball glanced off the
goalie's hand for the second
goal.
The game slowed down at
the beginning of the second
half, as both teams circled the
field attempting in vain to
boost their scores. The in
creased pressure on Davis
forced players of both teams
to make hasty shots and
pa nic-stricken passes. The ac
tion smoothed out, and Stan
ford came back with a solid
shot by Killefer from the top
of the circle.
The scotchers saved their
specialty, swift and rhythmic
teamwork, for the grand
finale. Forward Mandy Read
led a sweep downfield, pas
sing to sophomore link Jessie
Gerrard. Gerrard capitalized
on Read's assist for the fourth
and final goal of the game.
Coach Shirley Schoof was
especially proud of the final
Card effort. Halfback Jane
Soyster, who played a "truly
magnificent" defensive game
according to Schoof, pointed
out that the last score was
"one of those times we did
everything right. Davis didn't
even get a chance to tough it."
The Cards' Kathy Levinson
was out the second half due to
illness, but is expected to see
action Friday when the
scotchers take on a top
ranked Chico State team at
Chico. J


Sukie Jackson
Sue Katharine "Sukie"
Jackson played only one half
of a game of the varsity field
hockey season her freshman
year due to a knee injury.
Now a junior playing in the
demanding link position,
she's making up for lost time.
One of the top scotchers'
leading scorers, Jackson is
praised by coach Shirley
Schoof for her strength, ag
gressiveness and intelligence
on the field. "She has a fine
concept of the game," stated
Schoof. "She knows what to
do with the ball and is always
there."
Jackson's stature (5-foot
-10) has also proven to be an
asset on both offense and de
fense. As Schoof points out,
"She can really reach for that
ball."
Jackson can laugh about
her freshman injury now, but
at the time it was a big disap
pointment. And for someone
who is, in the words of her
coach, "an excellent natural
athlete who possesses a great
spirit of competitiveness,"
sitting out an important athle

sports person. Sukie is an in

she is on. She is one of the

coaches alike."
Part of Jackson's love for
hockey comes from an ap
preciation for the outdoors,
an appreciation that was en
tensified last summer during
a month spent hiking and
mountain-climbing in Ore
gon. The most difficult por
tion of a rigorous experience,
she said, was the three days
spent solo, without any food.
"The lack of food didn't
bother me nearly as much as
the lack of people," Jackson
said. "I didn't like being
alone for that long — I'm not
sure I'd do it again."
Despite her expertise as a
hockey player, Jackson is not
presently planning her life
around the game, although
her love for sports in general
may lead to coaching teach

ing. "I'm not sure what I'm
doing," she laughed.

Scotchers top Davis
Stanford's scrappy S; .idl
ers plowed over the UC- Javis
Aggies Wednesday, harvest
ing a 4-0 victory from Roble
field.
The Cards were relentless
in their attack, keeping the
ball consistently in the Ag
gies' half of the field.
The Red and White would
have reaped more goals had it
not been for the Davis goalie's
sharp reactions. Not easily in
timidated, she deflected sev
eral potential Card goals be
fore link Onnie killefer drove
a hard corner shot into the
net.
Link Sukie Jackson, assist
ing on the first goal, dribbled
solo down the field to chal
lenge the Aggies' defense
again. With three minutes left
in the first half, Jackson shot,
and the ball glanced off the
goalie's hand for the second
goal.
The game slowed down at
the beginning of the second
half, as both teams circled the
field attempting in vain to
boost their scores. The in
creased pressure on Davis
forced players of both teams
to make hasty shots and
pa nic-stricken passes. The ac
tion smoothed out, and Stan
ford came back with a solid
shot by Killefer from the top
of the circle.
The scotchers saved their
specialty, swift and rhythmic
teamwork, for the grand
finale. Forward Mandy Read
led a sweep downfield, pas
sing to sophomore link Jessie
Gerrard. Gerrard capitalized
on Read's assist for the fourth
and final goal of the game.
Coach Shirley Schoof was
especially proud of the final
Card effort. Halfback Jane
Soyster, who played a "truly
magnificent" defensive game
according to Schoof, pointed
out that the last score was
"one of those times we did
everything right. Davis didn't
even get a chance to tough it."
The Cards' Kathy Levinson
was out the second half due to
illness, but is expected to see
action Friday when the
scotchers take on a top
ranked Chico State team at
Chico. J


Sukie Jackson
Sue Katharine "Sukie"
Jackson played only one half
of a game of the varsity field
hockey season her freshman
year due to a knee injury.
Now a junior playing in the
demanding link position,
she's making up for lost time.
One of the top scotchers'
leading scorers, Jackson is
praised by coach Shirley
Schoof for her strength, ag
gressiveness and intelligence
on the field. "She has a fine
concept of the game," stated
Schoof. "She knows what to
do with the ball and is always
there."
Jackson's stature (5-foot
-10) has also proven to be an
asset on both offense and de
fense. As Schoof points out,
"She can really reach for that
ball."
Jackson can laugh about
her freshman injury now, but
at the time it was a big disap
pointment. And for someone
who is, in the words of her
coach, "an excellent natural
athlete who possesses a great
spirit of competitiveness,"
sitting out an important athle
tic season wasn't easy.
P'acial stitches
Jackson might also have
looked to some other sport for
amusement after an espe
cially hard-driven ball struck
her above the eye, necessitat
ing fourteen stitches.
That accident, occurring in
her first Stanford hockey
game, plus the knee injury,
might have made someone
else feel helplessly
accident-prone. Not Jackson.
If anything, she feels it's all
out of her system, and she just
wants to play hockey.
Stanford's valued import
from Santa Fe, N.M. "played
all the sports" her high school
offered, competing in hockey,
basketball and tennis.
Hockey first
Jackson has played basket
ball for Stanford during
winter quarter, but is espe
cially devoted to the hockey
program. Like other members
of the team, she attributes
much of the Cards' success
and her individual enjoyment
of the game to a special affin
ity within the group.
"It is a totally good experi
enre," states Jackson. "We
have fun. we get crazy, but we

work well together too. We
spend a lot of time on hockey,
but it never seems like a lot of
time."
Jackson prefers hockey
over other sports for its mutu
ally supportive qualities.
"There are no statistics in
hockey, really, and no sub
stitutions. It's a team sport —
you all have to work to
gether." Although she admits
the presence of "some ego
problems," she is convinced
that they are less intense and
less obvious in hockey than in
some of the other sports in
which she's participated.
Jackson's assets as a hockey
player form an admirable list,
but she would never list
them. She is a very natural,
unassuming and enthusiastic
person as well as a natural
athlete. Combined, these
qualities make her, in
Schoof's estimation, "very
coachable, and a strong team

sports person. Sukie is an in
tegral part of whatever team
she is on. She is one of the
best-liked by players and
coaches alike."
