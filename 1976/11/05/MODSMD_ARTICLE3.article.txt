### 
Plains, Ga. (AP) â€” Just two days
after winning the election, President
elect Jimmy Carter and running mate
W'alter Mondale began announcing
plans for the new administration at a
press conference here last night.
Here at a glance are highlights of the
conference.
News conferences: Carter said he
planned to hold at least two news con
ferences a month during his administ
ration.
Tux cut: He said economftj experts
think a tax cut might be necessary to
stimulate the economy if it is stagnant
in January and added that "this is a
strong possibility." He said a tax cut
would be aimed at stimulating pur
chasing power.
The election: Carter said his popular
and electoral majorities were in the
range of other elections and said he felt
he had "a clear majority oHhe electo
rate in this country," which he said
was enough of a mandate to allow him
to carry out his programs.
Restore good relations
Foreign policy: Foreign policy
priorities of the Carter administration
will be to restore good relations with
"our friends" and to open up policy
making decisions to Congress and the
people.
Cabinet: Carter said economic and

foreign policy appointments would
have precedence but he did not expect
any decisions until December. He said
he would follow the same general pro
cedure he used in picking Walter
Mondale as his running mate.
Oil prices: Carter said any increases
in prices by the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries,
scheduled to meet in December, would
be regrettable, but he said he could
take no official action since President
Gerald Ford still retained responsibil
ity for foreign policy.
Advisers not administrators
White House staff: Carter said he
would "never permit my White House
staff to run all the departments of the
government." He said White House
aides would serve as staff andadvisers
and not administrators.
It wasn't exactly the White House
Rose Garden when Carter held his con
ference, but there was lots of local
flavor in the outdoor setting as Carter
stood on the platform of the 19th cen
tury railroad depot that has served as a
local Carter campaign headquarters
and tourist reception center.
As a candidate. Carter had held do
zens of news conferences on the plat
form but none was broadcast live ac
ross the nation as was this one.
Reporters had worn blue jeans and

sports shirts during those earlier news
conferences but many were dressed in
suits and ties last night for the
President-elect's debut on a crisp au
tumn evening.
The reporters sat in metal folding
chairs in a semicircle placed exactly in
the middle of the street, and the ques
tioners exhaled frosty breaths in the
evening chill. Unlike the White House,
the public was present and a crowd of
about 400 watched from behind a line
of ropes strung around brightly
painted oil cans and applauded when
the 30-minute session finished.
Red, white and blue bunting left
over from the welcoming party given
Carter when he arrived here from At
lanta early Wednesday morning hung

on the depot and on buildings across
the street.
A new illuminated sign on a bank at
the end of the street read: "Congratula
tions Mr. President-elect."
Carter will leave Plains on Saturday
for a working vacation at St. Simon's
Island, off the Georgia coast.
He will take with him papers includ
ing memos entitled: "Some Thoughts
on Organizing Your Executive Office
of the Presidency," "Some Thoughts
on Selecting Your Cabinet," "Federal
Budget Issues," and papers in each
major federal department.
In addition, he got a three-volume
set of briefing books on foreign affairs
and national security.
