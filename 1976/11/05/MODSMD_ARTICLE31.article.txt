# Johannsen leads poloers against Long Beach, SC
## 
### Chris Kamel 
After two years of varsity
competition on the Stanford
water polo team, you would
think that preparation for each
game would be almost automatic
for junior Rick Johannsen, but
the native of Santa Barbara said
that this year is different.
"This season I get really ner
vous before a game," he said.
"Last year we had a chance to
win some of the games we
played, but this year we are ex
pected to win every one."
Part of the success of the Card
squad this season has hinged on
hole-man Johannsen. His job in
the pivot resembles that of the
center in basketball. Indeed, he
is as valuable. Most of the passes
that set up plays and scores come
from him on offense, while on
defense he is most concerned
with breaking up the opponent's
offense by disrupting the play of
the other hole-man.
"I've asked him to play a posi
tion that he hasn't played since
high school," said head water
polo coach Art Lambert. But ac
cording to Johannsen, the transi
tion back to his old position has
not been a difficult one.
"I started playing the position

a little during our tour in Europe
last summer," he said. "And it
came back to me pretty quick."
The Cards get a little bit of a
breather this weekend, if you
call playing a team that upset
UCLA last weekend a breather,
as they go up against Long Beach
State today at 3:30 pm and (JSC
tomorrow at 11 a.m. at deGuerre.
"Long Beach State upset the
Bruins, 6-5, last weekend in the
last three seconds," Lambert
said. "And after our game with
them down south, we're not
going to give them anything." In
the earlier meeting between the
Cards and the Forty-niners,
Stanford built up a 4-1 first quar
ter lead but had to hold on for a
7-6 win.
The Trojan match holds even
more importance for Lambert
because it marks the last home
game for seniors Drew
McDonald, Paul Clark and Chris
Dorst.
