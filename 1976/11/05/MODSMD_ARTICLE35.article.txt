Oregon, Ohio complete tallies
Oregon and Ohio, the last states whose presiden
tial results were still in doubt, finally counted
enough votes yesterday to indicate who had won
their ballots in the electoral college.
Ohio, like its neighbors Pennsylvania and West
Virginia, chose President-elect Jimmy Carter. Ore
gon went with every other Western state and gave
its electoral votes to President Gerald Eord.
Kissinger rules out early departure
Washington — Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer put to rest yesterday any suggestions that he
was going to leave his post before the end of the
Ford administration.
"I'm going to stay till January 20" (Inauguration
Day), he told reporters who asked him about the
possibility of an early departure.
Kissinger was at the White House, conferring for
about 90 minutes with President Ford. Asked what
they talked about, he smilingly told reporters,
"Foreign policy, what else?"
When asked what role he would pldy in the trans
ition to Carter, Kissinger said he was waiting to
hear from Carter and that "we'll be totally coopera
tive."
Earlier, the State Department had announced the
formation of a committee to handle the transition of
American foreign policy to the new administration.
State Department spokesman Robert Funseth
acknowledged that no one in the department had
discussed the transition procedure or concept with
anyone representing President-elect Carter.
Official alleges cartel threat
Sacramento — An international uranium cartel
•with apparent U.S. involvement poses a big threat
|to the American consumer, a high Westinghouse
{official told a congressional hearing yesterday.
I Albert Bethel, vice president and general man
ager for uranium resources at Westinghouse Elec
tric Corp., gave that view of the"club" of alleged
price-rigging uranium producers — including
"apparent" U.S. members.
But another witness actually laughed while tes
tifying about what he called an inept group of
foreign uranium producers "not getting their act
together" and having no clout — but admitting they
could hit hard in the future.
The witnesses appeared before the Subcommit
tee on Oversight and Investigations of the House
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce,
chaired by Rep. John Moss (D-Sacramento).
It was $5.95 a pound three years ago, and is $41
now, observed Moss, who declared the subcommit
tee will go after documents submitted as evidence
in Westinghouse's court cases, and make detailed
probes of uranium mining efforts in the United
States.
UC asks delay on minorities ruling
Washington — The University of California
asked the U.S. Supreme Court yesterday to delay
enforcement of a state ruling that special minority
admissions programs are unconstitutional.
U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist
asked that a response be filed by next Wednesday.
The UC Regents sought the stay pending appeal

of the California Supreme Court's Sept. 16 decision
in a case brought by a white student who had been
denied admission to the UC-Davis Medical School.
The state high court refused Oct. 28 to rehear the
case and ordered the medical school to admit Allan
Bakke, 36, now a Sunnyvale engineer.
In Berkeley, UC information officer Sarah Molla
said the university has until mid-December to file
its formal appeal. She said Bakke has made no at
tempt to gain admittance since the State court deci
sion.
The state Supreme Court found the special ad
missions program unconstitutional because it gave
special preference on the basis of race to minority
applicants. The appeal could mean a showdown in
the nation's highest court over the volatile issue of
so-called reverse discrimination.
Bakke was rejected by the medical school in 1973
and 1974. There were 2644 first-yearapplicants for
100 openings in 1973 and 3737 in 1974. Sixteen
slots were filled each year under the special admis
sions program for minorities.
The sole dissent to the state Supreme Court's
decision was by justice Mathevv Tobriner. "As a
practical matter," he said, "racial classifications
frequently must be employed if the effects of past
discrimination and exclusion are to be overcome."
Quakes hit Pasadena
Pasadena — A swarm of mild earthquakes that
shook the Imperial Valley area of southern Califor
nia with jolts as large as 4.9 on the Richter scale
continued yesterday with an occasional small
shudder.
The main flurry of some 60 quakes, which caused
little damage, rolled across the irrigated farmland
between 9:45 p.m. Wednesday and about 6 a.m.
yesterday.
The only damage reported was the breakage of
about $200 worth of food produces shaken from the
shelves of a market. There were many calls from
residents, however, as far away as San Diego, about
100 miles from the epicenter.
UC tightens English requirements
Berkeley — The University of California plans to
curb the tide of entering freshmen requiring
"bonehead" English courses by instituting stiffer
admissions requirements for high school prepara
tion, university officials say.
Beginning next year, the nine-campus university
system will no longer accept high school credits in
such subjects as drama, journalism or speech as
substitutes for academic English.
University officials have been concerned by in
creasing numbers of students who lack the reading
and writing skills necessary for success in college
level work.
In recent years, as many as half of each year's
incoming freshmen have needed remedial instruc
tion in basic English.
Lyle Gainsley, director of admissions and regis
trar, announced the action in letters to state high
school principals.
State officials earn more than Brown
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr., who
makes $49,100 a year, ranks 896 th among state
employes in earnings, a business-oriented tax
group reported yesterday.

The salary survey was topped by a University of
California health sciences professor who was re
ported to be making $94,000 a year in funds ad
ministered by the university.
The California Taxpayers Association released
the survey that listed salaries of hundreds of judges
and UC medical school teachers that are higher
than Brown's.
They include 508 Superior Court judges, whose
pay rose to $49,166 in September, and 288 UC
health science teachers making $50,000 or more.
Cal-Tax reported University of California offi
cials confirmed that a health science professor was
listed as earning $94,000 in the 1975-76 fiscal year,
but UC would not release the professor's name or
school.
Prisoner wants scheduled death
Provo, Utah — A district judge refused yesterday
to delay the Nov. 15 execution of convicted mur
derer Gary-Mark Gilmore. But defense lawyers said
they would go ahead with an appeal of the case
despite Gilmore's insistence he wants to die on
schedule.
Judge J. Robert Bullock said Gilmore has neither
appealed nor authorized an appeal and that the
condemned man is both competent to make such a
decision and aware of the consequences.
But court-appointed defense attorneys for Gil
more, who are trying to appeal the case over his
objections, said they would seek a review of the
matter before the Utah Supreme Court. Public de
fender Michael Esplin said the attorneys will, if
necessary, try to get the Supreme Court to grant the
stay.
Esplin said the judge's action really did not
change anything since the case appeared headed
for the state Supreme Court anyway.
Gilmore told Bullock this week he wants to keep
his date with the executioner so he does not have to
spend the rest of his life in prison. Gilmore, con
victed last month of murdering a motel clerk during
a robbery, has spent 18 of his 35 years in penal
institutions, defense attorney Craig Snyder said.
No one has been executed in the United States
since Luis Monge died in a Colorado gas chamber
on June 2,1967, for the murder of his pregnant wife
and three of their 10 children.
Deported Pole attempts hijack
Vienna, —A young Pole being deported from De
nmark wielded dummy weapons made of bread
colored with shoe polish to hijack a Polish airliner
yerterday and force it to land in Vienna, officials
said.
Police armed with machine guns ringed the
plane of Poland's LOT airline as it landed at Vien
na's Schwechat Airport, but the hijacker im
mediately surrendered and was taken into custody.
Today's weather
Fair with variable high clouds through tomorrow.
