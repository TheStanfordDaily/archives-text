# Campaign expense statement

R.B. Campbell's financial report on his frugal ASSU Senate campaign was
the most concise filed with ASSU Elections Commissioner Randy Bird.
One fourth of the successful candidates have not turned in their reports
although the deadline was last Friday. Bird said that while the statements
are "worthless" because "there is no way we can check up on them (the
candidates)," he will take action against those senators and alternates
who fail to file reports. No one exceeded the $50 limit, but the high
spender, alternate Steven Westley, just ducked under the limit with an
expenditure of $48.61. Campbell tied fellow graduate alternate Wick
Goodspeed for lowest expenditure. The Hammer and Coffin slate drove
their candidates home with $9.16 each; the Livingston-Morrow-Sharp
slate spent $46.84 each.
