Washington (AP) — Wholesale
prices jumped sharply in October for
the second straight month because of
the biggest rise in industrial prices in a
year, the Labor Department reported
yesterday.
Higher costs for 1977 model cars,
fuel and lumber products led a six
tenths of 1 per cent increase in the
wholesale price index, a precursor of
prices consumers will eventually pay.
A decline in farm prices kept the
over-all index from rising more shar
ply.
Although the October increase was
smaller than September's nine-tenths
per cent spurt, the report indicated
continuing strong inflationary pres
sures on the economy.
President-elect Jimmy Carter has a
greed with President Ford that inflation
will be a serious concern next yearand

will probably be in the range of six per
cent for the year.
Government role
During the presidential campaign,
Carter said the government should
play a more active role in getting pri
vate industry to restrain price in
creases.
Inflation at the wholesale level has
increased at a 5.8 per cent annual rate
over the past three months. For the
past 12 months, prices rose 3.5 per
cent, the smallest year-to-year change
since November 1971.
While the drop in farm prices is
good news for grocery shoppers, the
industrial price trend is a more dis
turbing sign for the economy.
Industrial prices
Economists follow movements in
industrial prices — which make up
more than 70 per cent of the wholesale
price index — more carefully than
farm prices because industrial price
changes are likely to have a prolonged
impact on the over-all price level.
Food prices, even after adjustment for
seasonal influences, fluctuate from
month to month.
Industrial prices have been rising
steadily for the past five months — in
creasing by five-tenths per cent in
June, seven-tenths in July and August,
nine-tenths in September and one per
cent last month. The October rise was
the sharpest monthly increase since
last October when they rose 1.2 per
cent.

Farm prices fell 1.2 per cent in
Cotober floowing a 1.9 per cent rise in
September and declines in July and Au
gust. Over the past three months, farm
prices have fallen at a 10.9 per cent
annual rate while industrial prices
climbed at an 11 per cent annual rate.
In a separate report, the Labor De
partment said the value of quality
changes to meet government pollution
and safety standards on the 1977
model cars averaged an estimated
$47.05 at wholesale and $59.15 at re
tail.
This estimate represented about
15.5 per cent of the average increase of
$382.30 in manufacturer's suggested
retail prices, the department said.

While the drop in farm prices is
good news for grocery shoppers, the
industrial price trend is a more dis
turbing sign for the economy.
Industrial prices
Economists follow movements in
industrial prices — which make up
more than 70 per cent of the wholesale
price index — more carefully than
farm prices because industrial price
changes are likely to have a prolonged
impact on the over-all price level.
Food prices, even after adjustment for
seasonal influences, fluctuate from
month to month.
Industrial prices have been rising
steadily for the past five months — in
creasing by five-tenths per cent in
June, seven-tenths in July and August,
nine-tenths in September and one per
cent last month. The October rise was
the sharpest monthly increase since
last October when they rose 1.2 per
cent.

Farm prices fell 1.2 per cent in
Cotober floowing a 1.9 per cent rise in
September and declines in July and Au
gust. Over the past three months, farm
prices have fallen at a 10.9 per cent
annual rate while industrial prices
climbed at an 11 per cent annual rate.
In a separate report, the Labor De
partment said the value of quality
changes to meet government pollution
and safety standards on the 1977
model cars averaged an estimated
$47.05 at wholesale and $59.15 at re
tail.
This estimate represented about
15.5 per cent of the average increase of
$382.30 in manufacturer's suggested
retail prices, the department said.
Washington (AP) — Wholesale
prices jumped sharply in October for
the second straight month because of
the biggest rise in industrial prices in a
year, the Labor Department reported
yesterday.
Higher costs for 1977 model cars,
fuel and lumber products led a six
tenths of 1 per cent increase in the
wholesale price index, a precursor of
prices consumers will eventually pay.
A decline in farm prices kept the
over-all index from rising more shar
ply.
Although the October increase was
smaller than September's nine-tenths
per cent spurt, the report indicated
continuing strong inflationary pres
sures on the economy.
President-elect Jimmy Carter has a
greed with President Ford that inflation
will be a serious concern next yearand

will probably be in the range of six per
cent for the year.
Government role
During the presidential campaign,
Carter said the government should
play a more active role in getting pri
vate industry to restrain price in
creases.
Inflation at the wholesale level has
increased at a 5.8 per cent annual rate
over the past three months. For the
past 12 months, prices rose 3.5 per
cent, the smallest year-to-year change
since November 1971.
