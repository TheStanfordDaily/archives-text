# Dean defends tenure decision
## 
### William Scott 
Halsey Royden, clean of humanities
and sciences, called the Economics
Department's decision about tenure
for Prof. Duncan Foley "reasona
ble and proper," in a letter to the
Economics Students Liaison Commit
tee on Wednesday.
Royden stated in the one-page letter
that he had not found any evidence of
political bias, and emphasized the
need for confidentiality in discussing
publicly the details of the case.
Prof. John Gurley, one of the people
consulted ifi Royden's investigation,
commented, "It is my belief tbat the
department used more severe stan
dards in evaluating Foley than it has
used in some other tenure decisions.
This suggests that other factors may
have been in the background in the
Foley case."
Gurley continued, "These factors
could have been political, personal or
something else. There is not enough
evidence to say which, but 1 am very
much disturbed by the possibility that
a double standard was used."
Prof. Bert Hickman, chairman of the
Economics Department, said he felt
Royden's letter speaks for itself. He
added, "I was happy the students
could go to the dean for an indepen
dent investigation."
Bill Behn, a member of the student
liaison committee, said Royden did
not systematically investigate the
grievance that his group had filed. "He
did not talk to all the people we felt
necessary to a complete investiga
tion," said Behn.
According to Royden as stated in his
letter, "In response to the request of
your student committee that I
re-examine this decision and their con
cern that there may have been political

bias or other improper factors in this
case, I have reread the documents,
made comparison with other recent
cases in economics, and talked to
numerous people including Kenneth J.
Arrow (head of the American
Economics Association's committee
on political discrimination) and a
broad spectrum from the Economics
Department. I have found no indica
tion of political motivation."
Royden continued, "Although there
was some difference of opinion as to
the wisdom of the decision taken,
there was near unanimity that the de
cision was reasonable, and no one be
lieved there was any evidence of im
proper consideration or political
bias. ..."
Royden ended his letter by saying,
"The need to preserve the integrity of
our appointment and promotion pro
cess and the confidential nature of the
material, both for the sake of the indi
viduals under consideration and for
those who give the (economics) de
partment and the dean (Royden) their
candid views and appraisals, prohibits
me from public discussion of the
merits of a case for or against promo
tion."
Royden was unavailable for further
comment on his report. He had sent the
letter to thestudent liaison committee,
as well as to Hickman, who made the
report public.
Behn stated, "We feel that the public
stance presented in the letter was in
consistent with the comments made to
us by the dean." He added. "The letter
gives the impression that there is no
question that the decision was reason
able. However, we feel Royden has
failed to meaningfully address our
grievance and ask that he reopen the
investigation."
