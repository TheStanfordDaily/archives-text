# Help for terminal patients
## Vitamin C cures cancer? 
### Marc Strassman 
Linus Pauling, professor emeritus of
chemistry, is actively pursuing re
search Into the use of vitamin C as a
therapeutic agent against cancer.
Terminal cancer patients treated
with 10 grams ofascorbate (vitamin C)
per day lived more than 4.2 times as
long as control patients not receiving
ascorbate therapy (2.0 days to 50 days
average survival time) according to a
paper by Pauling and Ewan Cameron
of Scotland in the October issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences.
Cameron is a consultant surgeon at
Vale of Leven District General Hospi
tal, Loch Lomondside, Scotland,
where the study was conducted. The
study indicated that 10 per cent of
those receiving the vitamin C have a
survival time averaging more than 20
times that for the control group. For 90
per cent of the ascorbate-treated pa
tients, deaths occur at one third the
rate of the control group.
Cameron and Pauling concluded
that "the results clearly indicate that
this simple and safe form of medica
tion is of definite value in the treat
ment of patients with advanced
cancer."
They postulated vitamin C might
have some effect against cancer be
cause "ascorbic acid metabolism is as
sociated with a number of mechanisms
known to be inolved in host resistance

to malignant disease. Cancer patients
are significantly depleted of ascorbic
acid, and in our opinion this demon
strable biochemical characteristic in
dicated a substantially increased re
quirement and utilization of this sub
stance to potentiate these various host
resistance factors.
Improves resistance
In other words, Cameron and Paul
-1 ng theorize that ascorbic acid is useful
in building up bodily resistance to
cancer and large doses of it provide the
body with quantities sufficient to im
prove the action of the resistance
mechanisms against cancer.
Cameron and Pauling suggested in
their report that "larger amounts than
10 grams a day might have a greater
effect" combating cancer. They also
said, "We surmise that the addition of
ascorbate to the treatment of patients
with cancer at an earlier stage of de
velopment might well have a similar
effect, changing life expectancy after
the stage when ascorbate treatment is
begun frorfi, for example, five years to
20 years."
Cancer is not the only disease that
Pauling, director of the Linus Pauling
Institute of Science and Medicine of
Menlo Park, says he thinks can be
treated successfully with ascorbic
acid. In 1970, he wrote Vitamin C and
the Common Cold, in which he argued
that large doses of the vitamin could
significantly reduce the frequency and

severity of colds. Debate within the
medical community continues on the
subject, with a recent article by Dr.
John Coulehan and others in the New
England Journal of Medicine, based on
a study of 868 Navajo children in
Arizona, concluding that "we do not
believe that vitamin C has widespread
usefulness as a cold remedy."
Vitamin C and flu
Pauling, however, continues to preach
its effectiveness, and. on Nov. 8, W.H.
Freeman and Company will release his
latest book. Vitamin C, the Common
Cold and the Flu, in which the chemist
argues that "regular use of vitamin C
may not only prevent the common
cold, but also protect against in
fluenza. Moreover, for most people,
the improvement in health that comes
from taking an optimum amount of
vitamin C in the diet may increase the
average life expectancy by twelve to
eighteen years. And regular use of vit
amin C may even make the proposed
swine flu shots unnecessary."
On the cover of the new book, un
derneath a picture of the scientist, is
this further amplication of Pauling's
views on vitamin C and swine flu: "In
1970-1977, when another swine flu
epidemic is expected, it is especially
important that everyone know that he
can protect himself to a considerable
extent against the disease and its con
sequences by use of this important
nutrient, vitamin C."
