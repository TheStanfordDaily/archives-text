# Flu shots go, slowly
## 
### Marc Strassman 
"It's going very smoothly," said Harvey Hall, co
ordinator of the campus swine flu immunization prog
ram, "because we're not very busy."
Hall, a former university registrar, said 236 persons had
received the vaccine on Tuesday, the first day of the on
campus facility in the lobby of Memorial Auditorium; 279
had gotten the innoculations on Wednesday; and that so
far on Thursday, "it does seem busier."
He said while his original expectation had been that
approximately half of the 15.000-20,000 in the university
community would receive vaccine through the free cam
pus program, now "I would hope 500 at least," would ap
pear each day during the remainder of the program, pro
ducing a final total of 4000-5000 swine-flu vaccine reci
pients.
Hall gave as possible reasons for the low turnout the
publicity surrounding the deaths during the early days of
the national innoculation program of elderly persons in
connection with administration of the vaccine, as well as a
general feeling among many that the shots may be un
necessary. He also put some of the blame on the fact that
Tuesday was Election Day.
Because of the unenthusiastic response to the program,
said Hall, few people take more than five minutes to go
through the entire process, most of which, he said, is spent
reading and filling out the "informed consent" forms. He
also said that because of the low turnout rates, individuals
desiring innoculation need not report in accordance with
the previously-announced alphabetical schedule. "Come
one, come all." is now the official policy, said Hall.
Hall also said a lower percentage of students than of

faculty and staff appeared to be coming by to get the
innoculations.
He also said that so far 16 persons between the ages of 18
and 25 had received the bivalent vaccine, designed for
individuals having a high risk of complications should
they get the flu, because of underlying major medical
problems. The bivalent vaccine confers protection against
the A-Victoria influenza as well as against the A-New
Jersey strain, which is commonly called swine flu.
The program continues today and next week, Tuesday
through Friday from noon till 4 p.m. in the lobby of Memo
rial Auditorium.
A random sampling of vaccine recipients revealed a
variety of reasons for getting the shot.
Sophomore Curt Cleaves, an economics major, said hu
got the vaccine "just basically because I figured it
wouldn't do me any harm and there's always the outside
chance of an outbreak."
Virginia Nicols, who characterized her university affilia
tion as "faculty wife." said she received an innoculation,
"basically because normally I would get a flu shot and I
consider this just the normal shot I would have gotten
anyway."
Indroo Keswani, a program analyst, said he got his shot
because "my wife is expecting a child and it's to protect
him, too."
And Dawn Pang, a senior, said she decided to get the
innoculation becuase "1 though it was a good health pre
caution." Asked if she expected an epidemic, she said. "I
think there might be, but if everyone gets a shot, then
mavbe there won't be."

Jersey strain, which is commonly called swine flu.
The program continues today and next week, Tuesday
through Friday from noon till 4 p.m. in the lobby of Memo
rial Auditorium.
A random sampling of vaccine recipients revealed a
variety of reasons for getting the shot.
Sophomore Curt Cleaves, an economics major, said hu
got the vaccine "just basically because I figured it
wouldn't do me any harm and there's always the outside
chance of an outbreak."
Virginia Nicols, who characterized her university affilia
tion as "faculty wife." said she received an innoculation,
"basically because normally I would get a flu shot and I
consider this just the normal shot I would have gotten
anyway."
Indroo Keswani, a program analyst, said he got his shot
because "my wife is expecting a child and it's to protect
him, too."
And Dawn Pang, a senior, said she decided to get the
innoculation becuase "1 though it was a good health pre
caution." Asked if she expected an epidemic, she said. "I
think there might be, but if everyone gets a shot, then
mavbe there won't be."

that many Thursday received swine flu innoculations in
the lobby of Memorial Auditorium.
"It's going very smoothly," said Harvey Hall, co
ordinator of the campus swine flu immunization prog
ram, "because we're not very busy."
Hall, a former university registrar, said 236 persons had
received the vaccine on Tuesday, the first day of the on
campus facility in the lobby of Memorial Auditorium; 279
had gotten the innoculations on Wednesday; and that so
far on Thursday, "it does seem busier."
He said while his original expectation had been that
approximately half of the 15.000-20,000 in the university
community would receive vaccine through the free cam
pus program, now "I would hope 500 at least," would ap
pear each day during the remainder of the program, pro
ducing a final total of 4000-5000 swine-flu vaccine reci
pients.
Hall gave as possible reasons for the low turnout the
publicity surrounding the deaths during the early days of
the national innoculation program of elderly persons in
connection with administration of the vaccine, as well as a
general feeling among many that the shots may be un
necessary. He also put some of the blame on the fact that
Tuesday was Election Day.
Because of the unenthusiastic response to the program,
said Hall, few people take more than five minutes to go
through the entire process, most of which, he said, is spent
reading and filling out the "informed consent" forms. He
also said that because of the low turnout rates, individuals
desiring innoculation need not report in accordance with
the previously-announced alphabetical schedule. "Come
one, come all." is now the official policy, said Hall.
Hall also said a lower percentage of students than of

faculty and staff appeared to be coming by to get the
innoculations.
He also said that so far 16 persons between the ages of 18
and 25 had received the bivalent vaccine, designed for
individuals having a high risk of complications should
they get the flu, because of underlying major medical
problems. The bivalent vaccine confers protection against
the A-Victoria influenza as well as against the A-New
Jersey strain, which is commonly called swine flu.
