Abramovitz, et. al.

In the last several months a series of
accusations have been made, in the
Daily and elsewhere, concerning the
treatment of radical economics and
economists at Stanford. The decision
by the Economics Department to offer
Duncan Foley, who was being consi
dered as a monetary economist (not a
Marxian economist), a three year reap
pointment rather than immediate
promotion to tenure clearly upset
many students and served as a catalyst
in bringing this issue to the forefront.
However, several more general
charges have been made which essen
tially suggest that there is a campaign
in the Economics Department to sup
press the teaching of radical
economics.
We shall reply here only to these
more general accusations, since uni
versity policy prohibits us from violat
ing the confidentiality of the tenure
review process in any particular case.
We would not reply even to the more
general accusations were they not a
blatant distortion of the facts.
First, the Stanford Economics De
partment has more tenured
economists who are experts in Marx
than any other outstanding economics
department in the country. The latest
rating of the quality of economics de
partments nationally places Stanford
in the top five with Harvard, Chicago.
MIT and Yale. These four economics
departments haveu combined total of
one tenured Marxist economist.
Two Marxists
While only a minute percentage of
U.S. economists have done research on
Marx in depth, Stanford has three te
nured economists (out of a total of 20
tenured professors) with such exper
tise. including two Marxists. The last
two senior appointments made from
outside the department were Donald
Harris and Nathan Rosenberg, who
both teach and do research in Marxian
economics.
Second, one need only examine the
Courses and Degrees Bulletin to note,
in addition to our wide range of tradi
tional economics courses, several un
dergraduate and graduate courses
with a Marxist orientation (including

one taught by an organizer of the re
cent protests).
Third, student demands for courses
in Marxian economics have risen no
more capidly than those in other areas
of, or approaches to, economics. The
number of graduate students offering
Alternative Approaches to Economics
(the subfield with the strongest Mar
xian orientation) as a field for their
Ph.D. in the last two years was substan
tially fewer than the number taking
many of the major applied subfields of
economics. At the undergraduate
level, recent surveys revealed that
Marxian economics was one of many
fields which students wanted ex
panded (a course on the stock market
topped the list).
Fourth, and most importantly, the
assertion that all economics faculty
(besides the two Marxists) share a set
of common beliefs about the economy,
let alone a common ideology, is at best
erroneous, at worst ridiculous! In fact,
we reflect considerable diversity, from
extremely conservative to quite lib
eral.
Differing views
There are widely differing views on
such matters as the basic operation of
the economy, the appropriate role of
government in economic affairs, and
the relative usefulness of abstract
theory and empirical research in
economics. This is also true of Stan
ford economists in other departments.
This diversity is widely recognized as
much gr6ater than that at the other
(usually larger) leading universities
named above and we believe it is a
major sourcexjf intellectual strength to
the department.
These facts hardly point toward a
systematic suppression of any ap
proach or point of view. Indeed, they
suggest that nothing could be further
from the truth.
