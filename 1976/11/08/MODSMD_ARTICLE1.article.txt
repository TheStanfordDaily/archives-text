# Radical factions purged in China
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
The sudden arrest and public de
nouncement of four government radi
cals in the People's Republic of China
last month was a surprise to three uni
versity members who were there at the
time.
"What struck me was that the people
in China were as surprised as we were.
I was totally flabbergasted," said Harry
Harding, assistant professor of politi
cal science.
Harding, along with an exchange
group which included Vice President
and Provost William Miller and Doug
las Murray, program director for inter
national studies, returned last week
from a 19 day stay which witnessed
mass demonstrations against Chiang
Ching, MaoTse-tung's widow; Deputy
Chairman from Shanghai Wang
Hung-wen; propagandist Yao Wen
yuan and Deputy Premier Chang
Chun-chiao in Shanghai.
Harding expressed surprise at how
"quickly and smoothly" the "elimina
tion" of the radicals had taken place.

"From what we saw, there was no sup
port for the radicals whatsoever," he
said. "There was a sense of surprise
among the people, of relief, of quiet
satisfaction — and even open joy,
among some."
"The thing which impressed me
most was to see suddenly, within a
matter of hours, such a build-up of
feeling," said Pat Miller, wife of Pro
vost Miller who accompanied him on
the trip.
"To see four million people pouring
into the streets of Shanghai'— but they
seemed to have very little information
about what was going on at the time,"
she said.
Harding said that when they asked
why the people supported the new
chairman of China's communist party.
Hua Kuo-Feng,in his move against the
radicals, they were told that it was be
cause Hua had been personally
selected by Mao, and, more impor
tantly, because Hua "had the guts to
move rapidly against the radicals."
Miller noted that he felt the people
he had come in contact with were "be
ing led, (the accusations against the
radicals) being taken very much on
faith."
The expression of relief at the purg
ing of the high ranking radicals seems
to indicated that the split between the
moderates and radicals was neither as
divisive nor as extensive as previously
thought.
"We tended to overestimate the
support of the radical faction," said
Harding.
Murray pointed out that the purge of
the radicals was not to avert a great
social upheaval. "The Chinese were
not avoiding something specific, but
rather certain types of pressure
brought by politicization that would
be lessened somewhat," he said.
"The radicals were accused of two
things," said Harding. "First, an
economic naivete — they had no prac
tical relevant experience. Second, in
the sense that the radicals would have
produced a constant tension, a con
stant struggle, a constant uncertainty."
"1 am concerned about the rhetoric
appearing in the western press about
the new regime," Murray continued.
"We cannot be sure it is wholly new.
The dominant orientations, the fun
damental goals and policies are not
changed."
Harding emphasized the signifi
cance of the overall policies of the gov
ernment providing clues as to its direc
tion. "Watch for the programs that af
fect the lives of the people — that's
what is really important. The farther
away you get from Peking, the per
sonalities fade and the programs be
come more important." he said.

Hua Kuo-Feng,in his move against the
radicals, they were told that it was be
cause Hua had been personally
selected by Mao, and, more impor
tantly, because Hua "had the guts to
move rapidly against the radicals."
Miller noted that he felt the people
he had come in contact with were "be
ing led, (the accusations against the
radicals) being taken very much on
faith."
The expression of relief at the purg
ing of the high ranking radicals seems
to indicated that the split between the
moderates and radicals was neither as
divisive nor as extensive as previously
thought.
"We tended to overestimate the
support of the radical faction," said
Harding.
Murray pointed out that the purge of
the radicals was not to avert a great
social upheaval. "The Chinese were
not avoiding something specific, but
rather certain types of pressure
brought by politicization that would
be lessened somewhat," he said.
"The radicals were accused of two
things," said Harding. "First, an
economic naivete — they had no prac
tical relevant experience. Second, in
the sense that the radicals would have
produced a constant tension, a con
stant struggle, a constant uncertainty."
"1 am concerned about the rhetoric
appearing in the western press about
the new regime," Murray continued.
"We cannot be sure it is wholly new.
The dominant orientations, the fun
damental goals and policies are not
changed."
Harding emphasized the signifi
cance of the overall policies of the gov
ernment providing clues as to its direc
tion. "Watch for the programs that af
fect the lives of the people — that's
what is really important. The farther
away you get from Peking, the per
sonalities fade and the programs be
come more important." he said.
The sudden arrest and public de
nouncement of four government radi
cals in the People's Republic of China
last month was a surprise to three uni
versity members who were there at the
time.
"What struck me was that the people
in China were as surprised as we were.
I was totally flabbergasted," said Harry
Harding, assistant professor of politi
cal science.
Harding, along with an exchange
group which included Vice President
and Provost William Miller and Doug
las Murray, program director for inter
national studies, returned last week
from a 19 day stay which witnessed
mass demonstrations against Chiang
Ching, MaoTse-tung's widow; Deputy
Chairman from Shanghai Wang
Hung-wen; propagandist Yao Wen
yuan and Deputy Premier Chang
Chun-chiao in Shanghai.
Harding expressed surprise at how
"quickly and smoothly" the "elimina
tion" of the radicals had taken place.

"From what we saw, there was no sup
port for the radicals whatsoever," he
said. "There was a sense of surprise
among the people, of relief, of quiet
satisfaction — and even open joy,
among some."
"The thing which impressed me
most was to see suddenly, within a
matter of hours, such a build-up of
feeling," said Pat Miller, wife of Pro
vost Miller who accompanied him on
the trip.
"To see four million people pouring
into the streets of Shanghai'— but they
seemed to have very little information
about what was going on at the time,"
she said.
Harding said that when they asked
why the people supported the new
chairman of China's communist party.
