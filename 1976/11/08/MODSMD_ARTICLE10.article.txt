# Revolt, new freedom marked Sixties

They came from all over the country:
the poets, the pilgrims, thealienated in
search of an anchor. San Francisco was
the fount of a new way of life, and at its
heart was the intersection oif Haight
and Ashbury Streets.
They used drugs, these invaders;
they painted their bodies, swelled the
sidewalks, offered flowers to the Tac
Squad.
They wore velvet, denim and calico,
begged in the streets, marched for an
end to the war that was thinning their
ranks.
San Francisco, in 1966, became the
focal point of the nation's attention.
The low rumble of the young's disillu
sion with materialistic America
erupted into a paean to new values,
among them equality for the races, an
end to American imperialism and
freedom of individual choice. San
Francisco, always cosmopolitan, in
dulgent and tolerant, drew the dis
satisfied to it like a magnet.

America was shocked, scandalized
and fearful. No one was supposed to
denounce domestic or foreign policy.
No one was supposed to grow beards
or long hair. No one was supposed to
smoke marijuana or mix the races or
say that communists might be humans
too.
While it had always been easy for
America to ignore problems, this was
usually due to the fact that those who
complained had no credibility or cur
rency with the society.
Prisoners might complain, or
minorities, or beatnicks, or socialists,
but to the American public and the
V\merican government, their voices
were unimportant and went un
heeded.
But this was a new phenomenon,
because those who were gleefully
pointing out military aggression, so
cial injustice and hypocrisy were the
nation's prideand joy, its white youth.

As the level of complaints against
the nation's policies mushroomed,
America reacted with brute force to
crush the "revolution". Police officers
began to harrass white youth in the
same way they had always harrassed
minority youth. Zoning ordinances
were used to prevent assemblies or
music concerts. Drug "busts" netted in
runaways, who were reclaimed by
their frantic parents. But the "revolu
tion" would not die.
The nation looked on in horror as
sexual, religious, political and racial
taboos were violated by its children.
Heroes arose among the dissenting
youth. Draft evaders, civil rights lead
ers, drug priests and communist lead
ers became the idols of the disil
lusioned. They flew the flags of the
nation's enemies, sewed the American
flag onto the seats of their britches and
converged on political conventions
determined to arouse the conscience of
the American people.
Revolt against values
The music of America's children
celebrated revolt against prevailing
values, the drug culture, free love and
the rejection of proper authority.
Slowly, the American Dream began
to deflate. As the young persisted in
their new lifestyle, adult Americans
began to listen to the voices which
questioned the Vietnam war, racial
discrimination, capitalism and
materialism.
Could it be that acquisition of goods,
racial discrimination and world
domination were not in keeping with
the ideals Americans professed but did
not practice? Was the country indeed
built upon hypocrisy and injustice?
It was apparent that the organized
forces of the nation, the police and the
military, were not enough to keep the
dissent from growing and spreading.

Soon many members of the "estab
lishment" were out in the streets pro
testing the atrocities of war brought to
them in the safety of their homes by the
television set.
Success
The "Movement" initiated by the
nation's youth finally succeeded in its
purpose â€” to awaken America from
the long and pleasant slumber of the
fifties. Voices critical of American val
ues would not be silent, and within a
few years, gained credibility even with
many elected representatives in gov
ernment.
New legislation was passed to solve
domestic problems. The Vietnam war
did not enjoy the sanctity accorded by
the American people to the Korean
War. Persons in all segments of society
developed a social and political
awareness that stupified a govern
ment accustomed to being believed,
regardless of what it said.
While the extremes of the sixties
"revolution" were never embraced by
the populace at large, its excesses had
been fundamental in bringing about
the gradual, sensible changes which
occurred.
The Abbie Hoffmans, Tom Haydens,
Eldridge Cleavers had pricked the
American conscience. Liberalism saw
its finest hour. Injustice for the few
became the correctable problem for the
ma ny.
But the changes were doomed to fai
lure, for there were still many who
longed for the simpler ways of the
previous decade, and in 1978, among
bitter protest and violence, they
elected Richard Nixon to the presi
dency of the United States.
