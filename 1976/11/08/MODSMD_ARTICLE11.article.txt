# U.S.-China parallel

Maybe China and America have
something in common after all. As a
once involved student of China, I can
draw a parallel between that country
and our own, in view of current na
tional and world affairs.
Before this century, China was gov
erned by dynasties of emperors who
promoted the idea that China was the
supreme nation in the world.
"Jung wo," the Chinese word for China,
means middle kingdom â€” middle of
the universe. Interestingly enough,
many of those dynasties lasted around
200 years.
Advance notice of the falling of a
dynasty was marked by national
calamities and then great efforts to re
form and purge corruption. Neverthe
less, that dynasty was doomed to be
replaced by a new one.
I can't help think of our own coun
try; we're 200 years old and going
through the same steps of political and
moral reform necessitated by the de
plorable discoveries of recent years. Is
this a foreshadowing of the downfal 1 of
the current system of government?
If America collapses, will it be all
her fault? One might study the anti-
Federalists' claim that eventually the
central government would usurp so
much power that corruption would be

inevitable. Instead, maybe outside in
fluences will be the cause. Accepting
the United States as the current
"Jungwo," her stability can be viewed
as further threatened by reading vari
ous news articles.
For example, the New York Times
on Oct. 28 expounded on Russia's
claims that she will top the United
States economically by 1980 and Chi
na's five-year plan to modernize by the
same year. And what influence does
South Korea really have over our con
gressmen? Of course America helps by
selling its technology, weapons, and
nuclear menaces. Indeed the news is
disheartening among the other
caveats.
I wonder how Americans would
react if such a toppling of our status
came about! Actually I don't suppose
Americans spend much time thinking
about the notion that this nation is
numero uno in world circumstances. I
rather doubt that the average Ameri
can has such a high self-esteem or
global view.
So perhaps if we became Avis or
Budget it might not matter to our mas
ses. What will the new dynasty be?
I hate to sound like Cassandra, but
the jig is up. folks, and the days are
numbered. If ever you had any
thoughts of being bullish on America,
the time is now. Our "greatness" is
imperiled, so if you have ever consi
dered being a nationalistic snob, you
better act it now.
Oh. and if you don't know how, you
might go to Stanford in Tours. Appa
rently. the French never reacted to
their demise, either.
