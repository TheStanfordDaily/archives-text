# Letters: breeding stock, Arab boycott

### 
Learn something
I have two suggestions for Jordan
Lorence ("Bucks for Babies," (Daily,
Oct. 29), who presumably was once a
healthy white baby. First, that he
spend more time with people who can
teach him the difference between
comic and distasteful topics for
weekly columns, and second, that he
seek a more appropriate Farm setting
for breeding white mothers.
Lorence might also talk with some of
Stanford's "prime breeding stock"
who may have suffered the consequ
ences of one "Saturday night at the
university." He could learn something
from listening to how difficult and
often overwhelming the situation was
for them.
I doubt that the promise of $25,000
at the end of nine months would have
been a factor in the decision whether to
have an abortion or to have the baby
and either keep it or give it up for adop
tion.

Closing accounts
In response to Peter Winkler's letter
(Daily, Oct. 25), we appreciate being
informed of the fact that Bank of
America participates in the Arab
boycott. Now we too are closing our
checking and savings accounts at this
bank.

Outrage
Last night my family paid $14 to §ee
a feature film at a local theater. About a
half-hour into the movie a scratching
became audible on the soundtrack and
destroyed the essential tension of a
pivotal scene.
When the problem persisted it be
came necessary for me to leave my seat
to inform the manager, who quite
casually advised me not to worry, that

it's only this one reel that's a problem,
and that, thank you, he's known about
it since they received the print two
weeks ago.
He claims to have asked the dis
tributor for a new reel, but, alas, it
hasn't arrived yet.
This kind of arrogance and hndiffer
ence is an outrage! The picture is a
brand new, multi-million dollar first
run film playing at a first-run theater,
and it behooves the theater own ers and
distributors to see that the prints are
pristine. But these people fully as-,
sume, and perhaps rightly, I hat at
$3.50 a head the cattle will stay put
and consume whatever they dish up.
As consumers we haven't much
leverage, even though this kind of poor
quality exhibition — bad sound,
scratched prints, sleeping projec
tionists — has become increasingly
prevalent. What is the good of all the
money, pain and talent that goes into a
film if some jerk behind a desk or in
side a projection booth is going to
louse it up anyway?
And of course, no one takes respon
sibility.
I encourage everyone to complain
loudly to theater owners whenever
appropriate and ask for your money
back if necessary. Otherwise; things
will just get worse. Maybe if we hit
them in the pocketbook they'll take
better care of us, their patrons.

Political process important
I found Tim W. Ferguson's "Another
reason not to vote" (Daily, Nov. 2)
thoroughly myopic and autistic.
Should the caliber of people who
populate the Stanford community
heed his advice and withdrfiw from
this nation's political syst'em, we
would indeed be in severe trouble.
I fear Ferguson has grown old before
his time. I hope he will be abl'3 to find
his way out of the philosophical cave
he's languishing in. Perhaps ho'll even
be able to find glasses and mad Dan
Caldwell's thoughtful letter ("Real
choice") in the same issue.
There is a bit of cynicism in all of us.
Ferguson's, however, has surpassed
the bounds of reality; it's almost
dangerous. Agreed, the American
political process is not all good — but

it is far from being all bad.

1 will comment on Cesar Barros'arti
cle "In Defense of Chile" I Daily, Oct.
29). because as he knows it is a chain of
Barros said, "I cannot remain silent
any longer." Barros is a lucky man; my
friend Victor fara will be silent forever.
Victor was killed by the troops of
Pinochet when he was a prisoner.
They cut his hands to keep him from
playing his guitar, but Victor con
tinued singing. They had to shoot.
It is completely false that Allende
was found guilty of purposely and re
peatedly violating the constitution.
Only a few enemies of democracy
raised some observations about Al
lende's interpretation of the constitu
tion in order to justify the coup.
Those who were found guilty of
murdering General Schneider were
members of the movement "Patria y
Libertad." Schneider accepted the
government of the majority. They had
to shoot. They were released after the
coup. The point is that at least one
member of "Patria y Libertad" is
studying at Stanford.
If the people had been armed the
situation could have been a different
one in Chile. It is a well-known fact
that there was and is only a strong
moral resistance in Chile.
The task of the DINA (Pinochet's in
ternal security department) and "Pat
ria y Libertad" is not only to kill per
sons who believe in a profound change
of the society as Letelier did, but also
anyone who is opposed to the military
regime. They tried to kill Frei (ex
president of Chile). On Aug. 14. a
bomb was found in his car. General
Prats was killed. Bernardo Leighton (a
Christian Democrat) was wounded by
the shots of Pinochet's men.
Finally, I want to say to Stanford
students that the majority of Chileans
are completely different from
Pinochet.
