# Ancient civilization found in Brazilian jungle hills

### 
La Paz, Bolivia (AP) — Ar
chaeologists have discovered
the ruins of what they believe to
be a previously unknown cul
ture that existed 500 years ago
and used an architecture based
on the trapezoid.
A trapezoid has four sides but
only two of them are parallel.
Most modern architecture uses
right angles.
"This is something com
pletely new in archaeology,"
said Carlos Ponce Sanjines, the
director of the National Institute
of Archaeology. "We've come
across an extremely original
form of architecture and we still
don't know how it developed."
The discovery in a mountain
jungle came when an expedition
found the ruins of a ciadel called
"Iskanwaya," the name given

the culture that is possibly de
scended from the mysterious
Tiahuanaco tribe, Ponce San
jines said. The Tiahuanaco, who
lived on a plain about 45 miles
north of La Paz, vanished about
800 years ago.
The newly discovered culture,
according to Ponce Sanjines,
is centered about 190 miles
north of La Paz in a warm region
on the eastern slopes of the
Andes at about 5000 feet above
sea level. There the Iskanwaya
citadel was built and sur
rounded by terraced garden
areas used for growing grain and
for supporting houses.
Careful calculations
The constrution of these
houses was based upon ex
tremely careful calculations,
Ponce Sanjines said in a recent
interview. But no one yet can
explain the use of the trapezoid.
"We're having to study the
structures slowly to see whether
the culture had based its ar
chitecture on some rare geomet
ric conception, or whether it was
based upon the climate or other
characteristics of the region,"
Ponce Sanjines said. "Perhaps
it's a combination of factors."
He said he recognizes, how
ever, that traditional architec
ture using right angles would
not have been prohibitive in the

jungled region — in fact, much
easier.
Photo exhibit
Ponce Sanjines and other ar
chaeologists opened a recent
photographic exhibition of the
Iskanwaya ruins in La Paz. The
trapezoid is seen in the photo
graphy as clearly dominating the
floor, the walls and the doors of
the small family units.
Although the ruins were
known to natives of the region,
and it is believed to be they who
named the citdel Iskanwaya, ar
cheological diggings did not
begin until three years ago.
The civilization is considered
by experts here to be of the
"Mollo" culture, the last known
descendents of the Tiahuanco
people who are believed to have
existed from 130 A.D. to 1170.
The Tiahuanaco culture disap
pered in the late 12th century,
apparently dispersing to other
areas. It is believed that drought
and resulting starvation brought
about the Tiahuanaco demise.
Mollo mystery
The "Mollo" culture began to
develop slowly and ruled the re
gion from roughly 1200 to 1480.
Its disappearance also is a mys
tery to archaeologists.
Iskanwaya is on a mountain
slope much as smaller citadels in
neighboring hills, "kari" and
"Pucanwaya" are two of the
more important fortresses listed
by archaeologists.

is centered about 190 miles
north of La Paz in a warm region
on the eastern slopes of the
Andes at about 5000 feet above
sea level. There the Iskanwaya
citadel was built and sur
rounded by terraced garden
areas used for growing grain and
for supporting houses.
Careful calculations
The constrution of these
houses was based upon ex
tremely careful calculations,
Ponce Sanjines said in a recent
interview. But no one yet can
explain the use of the trapezoid.
"We're having to study the
structures slowly to see whether
the culture had based its ar
chitecture on some rare geomet
ric conception, or whether it was
based upon the climate or other
characteristics of the region,"
Ponce Sanjines said. "Perhaps
it's a combination of factors."
He said he recognizes, how
ever, that traditional architec
ture using right angles would
not have been prohibitive in the

jungled region — in fact, much
easier.
Photo exhibit
Ponce Sanjines and other ar
chaeologists opened a recent
photographic exhibition of the
Iskanwaya ruins in La Paz. The
trapezoid is seen in the photo
graphy as clearly dominating the
floor, the walls and the doors of
the small family units.
Although the ruins were
known to natives of the region,
and it is believed to be they who
named the citdel Iskanwaya, ar
cheological diggings did not
begin until three years ago.
The civilization is considered
by experts here to be of the
"Mollo" culture, the last known
descendents of the Tiahuanco
people who are believed to have
existed from 130 A.D. to 1170.
The Tiahuanaco culture disap
pered in the late 12th century,
apparently dispersing to other
areas. It is believed that drought
and resulting starvation brought
about the Tiahuanaco demise.
Mollo mystery
The "Mollo" culture began to
develop slowly and ruled the re
gion from roughly 1200 to 1480.
Its disappearance also is a mys
tery to archaeologists.
Iskanwaya is on a mountain
slope much as smaller citadels in
neighboring hills, "kari" and
"Pucanwaya" are two of the
more important fortresses listed
by archaeologists.
La Paz, Bolivia (AP) — Ar
chaeologists have discovered
the ruins of what they believe to
be a previously unknown cul
ture that existed 500 years ago
and used an architecture based
on the trapezoid.
A trapezoid has four sides but
only two of them are parallel.
Most modern architecture uses
right angles.
"This is something com
pletely new in archaeology,"
said Carlos Ponce Sanjines, the
director of the National Institute
of Archaeology. "We've come
across an extremely original
form of architecture and we still
don't know how it developed."
The discovery in a mountain
jungle came when an expedition
found the ruins of a ciadel called
"Iskanwaya," the name given

the culture that is possibly de
scended from the mysterious
Tiahuanaco tribe, Ponce San
jines said. The Tiahuanaco, who
lived on a plain about 45 miles
north of La Paz, vanished about
800 years ago.
The newly discovered culture,
according to Ponce Sanjines,
is centered about 190 miles
north of La Paz in a warm region
on the eastern slopes of the
Andes at about 5000 feet above
sea level. There the Iskanwaya
