# How to succeed in business....
## Top-ranked biz school launches successful MBAs 
### Karen Koman 
How do you succeed in busi
ness without really trying? One
good way would be to secure one
of the 300 coveted openings each
year in the Stanford School of
Business. But the competition is
decidedly tough, with some
3600 applications received for
this year's class.
The end results are definitely
worthwhile, if one is able to sur
vive a grueling two years of hard
work and willing to invest
$16,000 for a shot at the rainbow
of corporate riches. Each
member of last year's graduating
class received an average of
three job offers and starting
salaries were in the range of

$20,000 a year according to Biz
school officials.
What special qualities or prog
rams give Stanford Biz its un
ique panache? Why are its stu
dents assiduously courted by
numerous firms and corpora
tional giants? The answer, ac
cording to Dick Lazurus, dean of
admissions, is Stanford's reputa
tion for academic excellence and
well-rounded student body.
The curriculum emphasizes
both the quantitative and qual
itative aspects of business. Great
importance is placed on analysis
of case histories or specific
businesses and their problems as
well as on present-day business
concerns and breakthroughs.
In days when owners of large
firms are entrusting their mana
gers with more and more re
sponsibility and power, the
marketability of a Masters in
Business Administration (MBA)
degree is easily seen.

Lazurus explains the recent
popularity of the MBA degree as
the result of the present
economic slump. Companies are
closing their ranks with very lit
tle expansion occuring. As a re
sult, people are leaving the work
force to return to school and
garner some more expertise. An
MBA is seen as the ticket to a
better job with built-in potential
for promotion.
Sue Berman, a second year
student from New York, left a
lucrative job with a publishing
company in order to come back
to school. Sue says an MBA will
give her more mobility in explor
ing other business fields, as well
as a "general picture of the deci
sion-making process in busi
ness." She says she particularly
enjoys the "friendly, no cut
throat atmostphere of the Biz
School"
She said. "People are very
generous with their time and ex

j>ertise,and this has really helped
me adjust to academics after so
long a break."
Wes Clark says he enrolled in
the MBA program because, after
working for several years with a
small business, he felt that he
had reached a stalemate, a level
beyond which he could not ad
vance. He is especially im
pressed with what he feels to be
the "positive, assertive attitude"
of students at the Biz School.
Experience needed
The criteria for admissions is
basically a proven track record of
achievement and work experi
ence. An important factor is
one's ability to take advantage of
any and all opportunities that
arise. It's really not necessary to
have a degree in finance or
economics in order to gain ad
mittance. In this year's class, 57
per cent of the students majored
in humanities and many never
expected to be going to business

school in a few years.
In the second year of the prog
ram, a great deal of time is spent
in looking for a "good job" and
in being interviewed by prospec
tive employers. The Biz School
Placement office plays a major
role in this process. In last year's
class, they successfully placed
60 per cent of the students.
The fields of finance and man
agement claimed the bulk of the
students, attracting respectively
27 per cent and 21 percent of the
class. Manufacturing and con
sulting firms, as well as various
non-profit organizations, also
drew a number of students.
Not money grubbers
Surprisingly, a high salary
was judged to be of minor impor
tance in job selection. Only 10
per cent of the grads cited it as
being a major determinate in the
selection of a certain job.
According to Carol Mar
chinick, head of the placement

office, "It blows recruiters'
minds that Stanford MBAs are
not money hungry."
Most Stanford MBAs start out
at the bottom of the corporate
heap with a 'staff' job. But once
leaving this basic training and
orientation program, their ad
vancement occurs quickly.
Salaries generally double within
five years and triple after ten
years with a firm.
Women generally earn very
close to the median salary of
men. The class of 1970 was 20
per cent female with the majority
of the women going into sevice
related fields such as banking
and accounting. Marchick be
lieves that companies have a
much more positive attitude
with regard to the hiring of
women and entrusting them
with important managerial posi
tions than in past years. "For one
thing," states Marchick, "they
(the corporations) know that

women coming here to Biz
School are committed to busi
ness and to a career. Women
here, though, still havea sense of
the pioneer spirit although ac
ceptance in the business world
has increased."
So for now. the Stanford Biz
School is riding the crest of this
new wave of popularity for busi
ness and finance. Stanford is
ranked at the top. along with
Harvard, as having one of the
best business schools in the na
tion. According to George Bach,
professor of economics, "The
fundamental point that is going
to make us last is that business is
a tough game and this kind of
training is going to pay
off . . . The early fear that a man
who didn't take courses in win
dow dressing would be no gootl
in business was just not true.
Look at the Fortune business
readers list. More and more are
MBAs."
