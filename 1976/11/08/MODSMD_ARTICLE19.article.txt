## USC drops Cards out of Rose Bowl race USC passing antics anger Chris 
### Paul Bauman 
Anybody who thinks that all
the feelings of animosity be
tween Stanford and USC accom
panied John McKay to Tampa
Hay wasn't in the Card locker
room after SC's 48-24 rout
Saturday.
Stanford head coach Jack
Christiansen was incensed, but
not surprised, that the Trojans
continued to throw the ball
when the game was way out of
the Cards' reach. Second-string
quarterback Rob Hertel directed
IJSC in the fourth quarter and
completed two of six passes for
54 yards. The two completions
were a 44-yard bomb to Kenny
Randle and a 10-yard
touchdown toss to Mike Robin
son.
"It didn't surprise me that they
passed at 41-10," Christiansen
told reporters after the game.

Then, in a sarcastic reference
to first-year SC head coach John
Robinson, Chris said, "It must be
a great feeling as a coach to take
over a great team and then to
play somebody and kick the shit
out of them. It must give him a
lot of confidence. We try to play
everybody here. We don't try to
pour it on anybody.
'Same philosophy'
"Of course, I guess if you have
a chance to be No. 1 in the coun
try, you stomp on the little
people. The coaching change
hasn't changed their
philosophy. I'd like to think
there's more humanity in the
world than that, but I guess there
isn't."
Robinson was not available to
comment on Christiansen's re
marks.
When asked if he thought SC
tried to run up the score, Stan

ford safety Larry McGovern said,
"Anytime you start throwing
when you're ahead by 30
points. . .
McGovern emphasized that
USC is "a good team, but not a
class team."
Saturday's game was close
compared to some of USC's pre
vious "contests." The Trojans
destroyed Oregon 53-0, lowa
55-0 and Oregon State 56-0.
Heavily penalized
The Trojans were heavily
penalized in the Stanford game,
but it was the nearly unanimous
opinion of Stanford players and
coaches that SC got away with
many infractions. As it was, USC
was called 14 times for 118
yards, compared to the Cards'
three for 25.
Christiansen said he thought
the officials called "about one
tenth of the penalties they
should have."
Some of the Cards' statements
were even more explicit.
Stanford kicker Mike Michel
said SC was "holding on every
play."
"SC pulls a lot of things when
the refs aren't looking,"
McGovern said, "like blocking
late and piling on. We saw them
do the same type of stuff in the
films. The really class teams like
Penn State and Michigan don't
pull thai kind of stuff."
Personal fouls
Five of the Trojans' penalties
were personal fouls, which usu
ally indicate that something
fishy is going on. USC was called
twice for roughing the passer
and twice for grabbing the face
mask. The other personal foul

resulted when SC back-up
tight-end Howard Studdard
slugged a Stanford player. Stud
dard was ejected from the game.
Trojan defensive tackle Gary
Jeter seemed to be the worst of
fender with one face-mask call
and one roughing-the-passer
call. On the latter penalty, Card
OB Guv Benjamin, arms at his
side, was watching his pass
reach its destination when the
USC senior smothered him from
behind.
If Jeter, a second team All-
American last year, doesn't
make it in pro football, there's
always big-time wrestling.
When asked if he'd call SG's
play dirty, Christiansen said
suggestively, "I wouldn't, but
you might."
Injuries mount
Stanford suffered several in
juries, particularly in the offen
sive line. A 1 Tenßruggencate,
Alex Karakozoff, Gary Anderson
and Brent Saylor were all hurt,
forcing some lineup juggling.
All players except Karakozoff
are expected to be ready for Ore
gon next week. Karakozoff was
carried off the field in the first
half against USC with a back in
jury. X-rays revealed two broken
vertebral processes. Head
Trainer Dave Blanchard said it is
not a serious injury, but
Karakozoff "will be in intense
pain for three or four days."
Correction: It was stated in
Friday's Daily that Stanford re
ceiver Bill Kellar "does not have
great speed." Kellar has run the
40 in 4.6 seconds, just a few steps
slowerthan teammateTonv Hill.
