# Pac-8 roundup
## Cal blanks Washington 
### Marko Fong 
While IJCLA and USC were setting up their
season ending showdown for the Rose Bowl, the
rest of the Pacific-8 Conference spent its weekend
trying to stay out of the Carbage Bowl.
Down in Los Angeles, after hearing about Pur
due's 16-14 upset of top-ranked Michigan (it was a
bad week all around for Jerry Ford), third-ranked
UCLA made a strong bid to move up a notch in the
polls devastating Oregon, 46-0. Oregon managed
to hold star UCLA halfback Wendell Tyler to 28
yards,but that was 30 more rushing yards than the
entire Duck offense could manage against the
UCLA defense.
The Bruin offensive line made pressed Duck of
the Oregon defense, which was flattened by 441
UCLA rushing yards. Jim Brown was the leading
UCLA runner with 110 yards.
In Seattle. Cal managed to hang onto its shot at a
wi nni ng season by squeaking by Washi ngton, 7-0.
l,ed by nose guard Bob Warner, the much
maligned Cal defense held the Huskies to just 250
yards total offense. The Bear defense got some
help from Huskie mental errors, which included
throwing the ball out of bounds to stop the clock
on fourth down.
TD plunge
The only score of the game came on a two-vard
touchdown run in the fourth quarter by tailback
Markey Crane. Crane had 07 yards on 18 carries.
Washington's star freshman halfback, Joe Steele,
and Cal's top receiver, Wesley Walker, both mis

sed the game with injuries. Cal is now 4-5.
"We weren't all that explosive offensively to
day," said Cal coach Mike White, "but it's a very
nice win. We've had three long weeks of not doing
well."
White said he had changed Cal's game plan for
Washington. "We felt we had been beating ourse
lves and that we needed to run the ball more and
count on our defense."
Rare shutout
The shutout was the Bears' first since 1970
when they routed Washington State, 45-0.
In a battle of state universities. Washington
State quarterback lack Thompson took advantage
of Guy Benjamin's lackluster statistical perfor
mance to strengthen his own challenge for the
Pac-fl passing title by riddling the Oregon State
defensive backfield with 28 completions and 345
yards on 45 attempts. Washington State won the
game 29-24. for its second straight victory.
lor you statistics freaks, Benjamin's and
Thompson's'chief rivals for the national passing
title. Rice's Tommy Kramer and Army's Leamon
Hill, went 29-45 for 380 yards and 11-27 for 141
yards, respectively.
Tony Dorsett. Ricky Bell's primary competition
for the national rushing title and the Heisman
Trophy, may have wrapped up both with a 212-
vard performance against Army. Pittsburgh's 37-7
win over Armv, combined with Michigan's loss,
will no douh give the undefeated Panthers the
top spot in 11 i polls.
