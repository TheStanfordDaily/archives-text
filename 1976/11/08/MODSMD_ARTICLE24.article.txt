# Trojan QB ties school record
## 
### Chris Baker 
It's hard to imagine how any
one could possibly have thought
that Stanford should represent
the Pacific-tt in the Rose Bowl.
After USC massacred Stanford
48-24 Saturday, not even the
most ardent Cardinal supporters
among the Stanford Stadium
crowd of 76,500 could logically
argue that Stanford should
spend the holidays doing any
thing other than watching UCLA
and Michigan or the Trojans and
Michigan on television.
Last year all you had to do to
beat USC was stop All-American
tailback Ricky Bell. But the Tro
jans didn't even need the former
Heisman Trophy candidate to
beat the Cards.
Bell held out
Bell dressed in street clothing,
watched from the sidelines, as
Trojan quarterback Vince Evans
threw four touchdown passes to
tie a school record.
"We didn't play Ricky Bell to
day," said first-year USC coach
John Robinson. "He was depre
ssed. He has a sore ankle and it
hurts to put pressure on it.
"It's not serious and 1 suppose
we could have played him, but I
made the decision. College foot
ball is not that important to risk a
permanent injury. I felt it was in
his best interest not to have him
play."
Evans ties record
Evans, who threw three
touchdown passes during the
entire 1975 season and four prior
to Saturday's game, completed
seven of 15 aerials for 131 yards
to turn the showdown into a
first-half rout.
Stanford was ready for Bell
and his back-up, freshman tail
back Charlie White. Card defen
sive tackle John Harris nailed
White at the line of scrimmage
on the game's first play.
Stanford came up with an
eight-man front designed to stop
the USC ground attack and force
Evans, who completed just 31
per cent of his passes last year, to
put the ball in the air.
It was not a very wise decision.
Robinson, an Oakland Raider as
sistant last year, called it a gam
ble.
'Cards gambled'
"Stanford played with inten
sity, but they did gamble. We
were flustered for a while but we
have confidence in our quarter
backs and receivers," said
Robinson. "It's risky to play that
way against us because we have
good balance running and pas
sing.
"Perhaps they miscalculated
our ability to throw," he added.
The Cards certainly miscalcu
lated Evans inthefirst 3:260f the
contest. The senior quarterback
hit flanker Shelton Diggs with 56
and 21-yard touchdown strikes.
Diggs' first touchdown came
on the third play of the game
when he just outran cornerback
Savann Thompson on a fly pat
tern.
'Played like freshman'
"I felt like a freshman today,"
said Thompson of his poor de
fensive effort. "He (Diggs)
showed me a lot. We just made
two many mistakes."
Stanford's only real offense in
the first half was Mike Michel's
44-yard run off a fake punt. The
trick play put the Cards inside
the SC 10-yard line, but they had
to settle for a 26-yard Michel

field goal.
The Stanford defense, after al
lowing USC two quick first
quarter touchdowns, was
superb. Card "defensive ends
Duncan McColl and Chuck
Evans harrassed Evans. McColl
led Stanford with 14 tackles.
Evans knocked down three pas
ses, while McColl batted down
another aerial.
The Card defense had not al
lowed USC a first down for five
consecutive series when punter
Clenn Walker was called into
service midway through the sec
ond quarter.
Controversial play
Walker got off a high spiral
and Thompson called for a fair
catch at the Stanford 20-yard
line. But Thompson was tripped
by a couple of Trojan defenders
as he was trying to field the punt
and the officials awarded the
ball to SC, ruling that the
sophomore defensive back had
fumbled the punt.
It was probably one of the
worst calls against the Cards this
season. And USC couldn't get off
a play for two minutes because
Evans couldn't call signals over
the crowds' booing.
"It's pretty amazing when
50,000 people in the stands can
see an error on the field, but
somebody down there who's
supposed to be watching for
something of that kind can't see
it," said Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen after the game.
Bad call
"Everybody pretty much ag
reed that Savann was tripped up
as he tried to catch the punt.
People were booing and I can't
blame them a bit. We could have
scored and gotten back in it at
that point," Christiansen added.
Thompson thought it was a
very bad call. "When I looked to
the side the official was right
there and I said, The dude hit
me.' And he said, 'No, no, you
fumbled.' And I knew I was not
going to change his mind."
. It took just four White runs to
give USC its third touchdown of
the afternoon. The freshman
finished as the game's leading
rusher with 136 yards on 23 car
ries and two touchdowns.
Second interception
Card quarterback Cuy Benja
min threw his second intercep
tion of the half on Stanford's en
suing series to present the Tro
jans with the ball at the Card 15.
Evans hit wide receiver Randy
Simmrin for his third
touchdown pass of the after
noon.
Benjamin threw to his running
backs much of the first half, be
cause USC double covered his
wide receivers. "Two of the in
terceptions were perfectly
thrown passes," said Benjamin,

"but the receivers didn't turn for
the ball and 1 really didn't have
enough time to let the receivers
run in the wrong holes."
SC drove 80 yards in the last
2:30 of the half to turn the first
half into a rout with Evans hit
ting Diggs with a 23-yard strike.
Diggs, who caught just three
touchdown passes in his first
three years at SC, tied the confer
ence record for most touchdown
receptions (three) in a game.
'Biggest moment'
"This is my biggest moment,"
said the Trojan senior who
caught the winning two-point
conversion in the 1975 Rose
Bowl. "They played a straight
man-to-man coverage on me. I
wasn't really surprised at their
coverage. 1 think they thought
they'd be able to rush eight
men."
Evans said that he wanted to
win the contest for Bell and cor
nerback Mike Carry, due to begin
treatment for Hodgkins Disease
next week.
"Ricky just looked so sad
when they told him he couldn't
play. He's a team cat and he takes
a lot of pressure off me," said
Evans.
Trojan strategy
USC 34, Stanford 3.
This was a game that should
have been 30 minutes long. USC
only added to the insult when
White scored a three-yard
touchdown after safety Dennis
Thurman picked off Benjamin's
third interception of the day.
That made it 41-3 midway
through the third quarter.
Benjamin put together an 80-
yard scoring march after the
touchdown, hitting five of seven
passes. It was the first
touchdown given up by the Tro
jans in 10 quarters.
Back-up Card quarterback
Mike Cordova did a good job
after Benjamin departed, direct
ing Stanford to two fourth
quarter touchdowns. Cordova
hit six of six passes for 74 yards,
but he didn't re-open the quar
terback controversy.
As Robinson said, "Stanford
gambled." And the Cards rolled
snake-eyes.

48-24 Saturday, not even the
most ardent Cardinal supporters
among the Stanford Stadium
crowd of 76,500 could logically
argue that Stanford should
spend the holidays doing any
thing other than watching UCLA
and Michigan or the Trojans and
Michigan on television.
Last year all you had to do to
beat USC was stop All-American
tailback Ricky Bell. But the Tro
jans didn't even need the former
Heisman Trophy candidate to
beat the Cards.
Bell held out
Bell dressed in street clothing,
watched from the sidelines, as
Trojan quarterback Vince Evans
threw four touchdown passes to
tie a school record.
"We didn't play Ricky Bell to
day," said first-year USC coach
John Robinson. "He was depre
ssed. He has a sore ankle and it
hurts to put pressure on it.
"It's not serious and 1 suppose
we could have played him, but I
made the decision. College foot
ball is not that important to risk a
permanent injury. I felt it was in
his best interest not to have him
play."
Evans ties record
Evans, who threw three
touchdown passes during the
entire 1975 season and four prior
to Saturday's game, completed
seven of 15 aerials for 131 yards
to turn the showdown into a
first-half rout.
Stanford was ready for Bell
and his back-up, freshman tail
back Charlie White. Card defen
sive tackle John Harris nailed
White at the line of scrimmage
on the game's first play.
Stanford came up with an
eight-man front designed to stop
the USC ground attack and force
Evans, who completed just 31
per cent of his passes last year, to
put the ball in the air.
It was not a very wise decision.
Robinson, an Oakland Raider as
sistant last year, called it a gam
ble.
'Cards gambled'
"Stanford played with inten
sity, but they did gamble. We
were flustered for a while but we
have confidence in our quarter
backs and receivers," said
Robinson. "It's risky to play that
way against us because we have
good balance running and pas
sing.
"Perhaps they miscalculated
our ability to throw," he added.
The Cards certainly miscalcu
lated Evans inthefirst 3:260f the
contest. The senior quarterback
hit flanker Shelton Diggs with 56
and 21-yard touchdown strikes.
Diggs' first touchdown came
on the third play of the game
when he just outran cornerback
Savann Thompson on a fly pat
tern.
'Played like freshman'
"I felt like a freshman today,"
said Thompson of his poor de
fensive effort. "He (Diggs)
showed me a lot. We just made
two many mistakes."
Stanford's only real offense in
the first half was Mike Michel's
44-yard run off a fake punt. The
trick play put the Cards inside
the SC 10-yard line, but they had
to settle for a 26-yard Michel

field goal.
The Stanford defense, after al
lowing USC two quick first
quarter touchdowns, was
superb. Card "defensive ends
Duncan McColl and Chuck
Evans harrassed Evans. McColl
led Stanford with 14 tackles.
Evans knocked down three pas
ses, while McColl batted down
another aerial.
The Card defense had not al
lowed USC a first down for five
consecutive series when punter
Clenn Walker was called into
service midway through the sec
ond quarter.
Controversial play
Walker got off a high spiral
and Thompson called for a fair
catch at the Stanford 20-yard
line. But Thompson was tripped
by a couple of Trojan defenders
as he was trying to field the punt
and the officials awarded the
ball to SC, ruling that the
sophomore defensive back had
fumbled the punt.
It was probably one of the
worst calls against the Cards this
season. And USC couldn't get off
a play for two minutes because
Evans couldn't call signals over
the crowds' booing.
"It's pretty amazing when
50,000 people in the stands can
see an error on the field, but
somebody down there who's
supposed to be watching for
something of that kind can't see
it," said Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen after the game.
Bad call
"Everybody pretty much ag
reed that Savann was tripped up
as he tried to catch the punt.
People were booing and I can't
blame them a bit. We could have
scored and gotten back in it at
that point," Christiansen added.
Thompson thought it was a
very bad call. "When I looked to
the side the official was right
there and I said, The dude hit
me.' And he said, 'No, no, you
fumbled.' And I knew I was not
going to change his mind."
. It took just four White runs to
give USC its third touchdown of
the afternoon. The freshman
finished as the game's leading
rusher with 136 yards on 23 car
ries and two touchdowns.
Second interception
Card quarterback Cuy Benja
min threw his second intercep
tion of the half on Stanford's en
suing series to present the Tro
jans with the ball at the Card 15.
Evans hit wide receiver Randy
Simmrin for his third
touchdown pass of the after
noon.
Benjamin threw to his running
backs much of the first half, be
cause USC double covered his
wide receivers. "Two of the in
terceptions were perfectly
thrown passes," said Benjamin,

"but the receivers didn't turn for
the ball and 1 really didn't have
enough time to let the receivers
run in the wrong holes."
SC drove 80 yards in the last
2:30 of the half to turn the first
half into a rout with Evans hit
ting Diggs with a 23-yard strike.
Diggs, who caught just three
touchdown passes in his first
three years at SC, tied the confer
ence record for most touchdown
receptions (three) in a game.
'Biggest moment'
"This is my biggest moment,"
said the Trojan senior who
caught the winning two-point
conversion in the 1975 Rose
Bowl. "They played a straight
man-to-man coverage on me. I
wasn't really surprised at their
coverage. 1 think they thought
they'd be able to rush eight
men."
Evans said that he wanted to
win the contest for Bell and cor
nerback Mike Carry, due to begin
treatment for Hodgkins Disease
next week.
"Ricky just looked so sad
when they told him he couldn't
play. He's a team cat and he takes
a lot of pressure off me," said
Evans.
Trojan strategy
USC 34, Stanford 3.
This was a game that should
have been 30 minutes long. USC
only added to the insult when
White scored a three-yard
touchdown after safety Dennis
Thurman picked off Benjamin's
third interception of the day.
That made it 41-3 midway
through the third quarter.
Benjamin put together an 80-
yard scoring march after the
touchdown, hitting five of seven
passes. It was the first
touchdown given up by the Tro
jans in 10 quarters.
Back-up Card quarterback
Mike Cordova did a good job
after Benjamin departed, direct
ing Stanford to two fourth
quarter touchdowns. Cordova
hit six of six passes for 74 yards,
but he didn't re-open the quar
terback controversy.
As Robinson said, "Stanford
gambled." And the Cards rolled
snake-eyes.
It's hard to imagine how any
one could possibly have thought

the Pacific-tt in the Rose Bowl.

spend the holidays doing any
thing other than watching UCLA
and Michigan or the Trojans and
Michigan on television.
Last year all you had to do to
beat USC was stop All-American
tailback Ricky Bell. But the Tro
jans didn't even need the former
Heisman Trophy candidate to
beat the Cards.
Bell held out
Bell dressed in street clothing,
watched from the sidelines, as
Trojan quarterback Vince Evans
threw four touchdown passes to
tie a school record.
"We didn't play Ricky Bell to
day," said first-year USC coach
John Robinson. "He was depre
ssed. He has a sore ankle and it
hurts to put pressure on it.
"It's not serious and 1 suppose
we could have played him, but I
made the decision. College foot
ball is not that important to risk a
permanent injury. I felt it was in
his best interest not to have him
play."
Evans ties record
Evans, who threw three
touchdown passes during the
entire 1975 season and four prior
to Saturday's game, completed
seven of 15 aerials for 131 yards
to turn the showdown into a
first-half rout.
Stanford was ready for Bell
and his back-up, freshman tail
back Charlie White. Card defen
sive tackle John Harris nailed
White at the line of scrimmage
on the game's first play.
Stanford came up with an
eight-man front designed to stop
the USC ground attack and force
Evans, who completed just 31
per cent of his passes last year, to
put the ball in the air.
It was not a very wise decision.
Robinson, an Oakland Raider as
sistant last year, called it a gam
ble.
'Cards gambled'
"Stanford played with inten
sity, but they did gamble. We
were flustered for a while but we
have confidence in our quarter
backs and receivers," said
Robinson. "It's risky to play that
way against us because we have
good balance running and pas
sing.
"Perhaps they miscalculated
our ability to throw," he added.
The Cards certainly miscalcu
lated Evans inthefirst 3:260f the
contest. The senior quarterback
hit flanker Shelton Diggs with 56
and 21-yard touchdown strikes.
Diggs' first touchdown came
on the third play of the game
when he just outran cornerback
Savann Thompson on a fly pat
tern.
'Played like freshman'
"I felt like a freshman today,"
said Thompson of his poor de
fensive effort. "He (Diggs)
showed me a lot. We just made
two many mistakes."
Stanford's only real offense in
the first half was Mike Michel's
44-yard run off a fake punt. The
trick play put the Cards inside
the SC 10-yard line, but they had
to settle for a 26-yard Michel

field goal.
The Stanford defense, after al
lowing USC two quick first
quarter touchdowns, was
superb. Card "defensive ends
Duncan McColl and Chuck
Evans harrassed Evans. McColl
led Stanford with 14 tackles.
Evans knocked down three pas
ses, while McColl batted down
another aerial.
The Card defense had not al
lowed USC a first down for five
consecutive series when punter
Clenn Walker was called into
service midway through the sec
ond quarter.
Controversial play
Walker got off a high spiral
and Thompson called for a fair
catch at the Stanford 20-yard
line. But Thompson was tripped
by a couple of Trojan defenders
as he was trying to field the punt
and the officials awarded the
ball to SC, ruling that the
sophomore defensive back had
fumbled the punt.
It was probably one of the
worst calls against the Cards this
season. And USC couldn't get off
a play for two minutes because
Evans couldn't call signals over
the crowds' booing.
"It's pretty amazing when
50,000 people in the stands can
see an error on the field, but
somebody down there who's
supposed to be watching for
something of that kind can't see
it," said Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen after the game.
Bad call
"Everybody pretty much ag
reed that Savann was tripped up
as he tried to catch the punt.
People were booing and I can't
blame them a bit. We could have
scored and gotten back in it at
that point," Christiansen added.
Thompson thought it was a
very bad call. "When I looked to
the side the official was right
there and I said, The dude hit
me.' And he said, 'No, no, you
fumbled.' And I knew I was not
going to change his mind."
. It took just four White runs to
give USC its third touchdown of
the afternoon. The freshman
finished as the game's leading
rusher with 136 yards on 23 car
ries and two touchdowns.
Second interception
Card quarterback Cuy Benja
min threw his second intercep
tion of the half on Stanford's en
suing series to present the Tro
jans with the ball at the Card 15.
Evans hit wide receiver Randy
Simmrin for his third
touchdown pass of the after
noon.
Benjamin threw to his running
backs much of the first half, be
cause USC double covered his
wide receivers. "Two of the in
terceptions were perfectly
thrown passes," said Benjamin,

"but the receivers didn't turn for
the ball and 1 really didn't have
enough time to let the receivers
run in the wrong holes."
SC drove 80 yards in the last
2:30 of the half to turn the first
half into a rout with Evans hit
ting Diggs with a 23-yard strike.
Diggs, who caught just three
touchdown passes in his first
three years at SC, tied the confer
ence record for most touchdown
receptions (three) in a game.
'Biggest moment'
"This is my biggest moment,"
said the Trojan senior who
caught the winning two-point
conversion in the 1975 Rose
Bowl. "They played a straight
man-to-man coverage on me. I
wasn't really surprised at their
coverage. 1 think they thought
they'd be able to rush eight
men."
Evans said that he wanted to
win the contest for Bell and cor
nerback Mike Carry, due to begin
treatment for Hodgkins Disease
next week.
"Ricky just looked so sad
when they told him he couldn't
play. He's a team cat and he takes
a lot of pressure off me," said
Evans.
Trojan strategy
USC 34, Stanford 3.
This was a game that should
have been 30 minutes long. USC
only added to the insult when
White scored a three-yard
touchdown after safety Dennis
Thurman picked off Benjamin's
third interception of the day.
That made it 41-3 midway
through the third quarter.
Benjamin put together an 80-
yard scoring march after the
touchdown, hitting five of seven
passes. It was the first
touchdown given up by the Tro
jans in 10 quarters.
Back-up Card quarterback
Mike Cordova did a good job
after Benjamin departed, direct
ing Stanford to two fourth
quarter touchdowns. Cordova
hit six of six passes for 74 yards,
but he didn't re-open the quar
terback controversy.
As Robinson said, "Stanford
gambled." And the Cards rolled
snake-eyes.
It's hard to imagine how any

tailback Ricky Bell. But the Tro
jans didn't even need the former
Heisman Trophy candidate to
beat the Cards.
Bell held out
Bell dressed in street clothing,
watched from the sidelines, as
Trojan quarterback Vince Evans
threw four touchdown passes to
tie a school record.
"We didn't play Ricky Bell to
day," said first-year USC coach
John Robinson. "He was depre
ssed. He has a sore ankle and it
hurts to put pressure on it.
"It's not serious and 1 suppose
we could have played him, but I
made the decision. College foot
ball is not that important to risk a
permanent injury. I felt it was in
his best interest not to have him
play."
Evans ties record
Evans, who threw three
touchdown passes during the
entire 1975 season and four prior
to Saturday's game, completed
seven of 15 aerials for 131 yards
to turn the showdown into a
first-half rout.
Stanford was ready for Bell
and his back-up, freshman tail
back Charlie White. Card defen
sive tackle John Harris nailed
White at the line of scrimmage
on the game's first play.
Stanford came up with an
eight-man front designed to stop
the USC ground attack and force
Evans, who completed just 31
per cent of his passes last year, to
put the ball in the air.
It was not a very wise decision.
Robinson, an Oakland Raider as
sistant last year, called it a gam
ble.
'Cards gambled'
"Stanford played with inten
sity, but they did gamble. We
were flustered for a while but we
have confidence in our quarter
backs and receivers," said
Robinson. "It's risky to play that
way against us because we have
good balance running and pas
sing.
"Perhaps they miscalculated
our ability to throw," he added.
The Cards certainly miscalcu
lated Evans inthefirst 3:260f the
contest. The senior quarterback
hit flanker Shelton Diggs with 56
and 21-yard touchdown strikes.
Diggs' first touchdown came
on the third play of the game
when he just outran cornerback
Savann Thompson on a fly pat
tern.
'Played like freshman'
"I felt like a freshman today,"
said Thompson of his poor de
fensive effort. "He (Diggs)
showed me a lot. We just made
two many mistakes."
Stanford's only real offense in
the first half was Mike Michel's
44-yard run off a fake punt. The
trick play put the Cards inside
the SC 10-yard line, but they had
to settle for a 26-yard Michel

field goal.
The Stanford defense, after al
lowing USC two quick first
quarter touchdowns, was
superb. Card "defensive ends
Duncan McColl and Chuck
Evans harrassed Evans. McColl
led Stanford with 14 tackles.
Evans knocked down three pas
ses, while McColl batted down
another aerial.
The Card defense had not al
lowed USC a first down for five
consecutive series when punter
Clenn Walker was called into
service midway through the sec
ond quarter.
Controversial play
Walker got off a high spiral
and Thompson called for a fair
catch at the Stanford 20-yard
line. But Thompson was tripped
by a couple of Trojan defenders
as he was trying to field the punt
and the officials awarded the
ball to SC, ruling that the
sophomore defensive back had
fumbled the punt.
It was probably one of the
worst calls against the Cards this
season. And USC couldn't get off
a play for two minutes because
Evans couldn't call signals over
the crowds' booing.
"It's pretty amazing when
50,000 people in the stands can
see an error on the field, but
somebody down there who's
supposed to be watching for
something of that kind can't see
it," said Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen after the game.
Bad call
"Everybody pretty much ag
reed that Savann was tripped up
as he tried to catch the punt.
People were booing and I can't
blame them a bit. We could have
scored and gotten back in it at
that point," Christiansen added.
Thompson thought it was a
very bad call. "When I looked to
the side the official was right
there and I said, The dude hit
me.' And he said, 'No, no, you
fumbled.' And I knew I was not
going to change his mind."
. It took just four White runs to
give USC its third touchdown of
the afternoon. The freshman
finished as the game's leading
rusher with 136 yards on 23 car
ries and two touchdowns.
Second interception
Card quarterback Cuy Benja
min threw his second intercep
tion of the half on Stanford's en
suing series to present the Tro
jans with the ball at the Card 15.
Evans hit wide receiver Randy
Simmrin for his third
touchdown pass of the after
noon.
Benjamin threw to his running
backs much of the first half, be
cause USC double covered his
wide receivers. "Two of the in
terceptions were perfectly
thrown passes," said Benjamin,

"but the receivers didn't turn for
the ball and 1 really didn't have
enough time to let the receivers
run in the wrong holes."
SC drove 80 yards in the last
2:30 of the half to turn the first
half into a rout with Evans hit
ting Diggs with a 23-yard strike.
Diggs, who caught just three
touchdown passes in his first
three years at SC, tied the confer
ence record for most touchdown
receptions (three) in a game.
'Biggest moment'
"This is my biggest moment,"
said the Trojan senior who
caught the winning two-point
conversion in the 1975 Rose
Bowl. "They played a straight
man-to-man coverage on me. I
wasn't really surprised at their
coverage. 1 think they thought
they'd be able to rush eight
men."
Evans said that he wanted to
win the contest for Bell and cor
nerback Mike Carry, due to begin
treatment for Hodgkins Disease
next week.
"Ricky just looked so sad
when they told him he couldn't
play. He's a team cat and he takes
a lot of pressure off me," said
Evans.
Trojan strategy
USC 34, Stanford 3.
This was a game that should
have been 30 minutes long. USC
only added to the insult when
White scored a three-yard
touchdown after safety Dennis
Thurman picked off Benjamin's
third interception of the day.
That made it 41-3 midway
through the third quarter.
Benjamin put together an 80-
yard scoring march after the
touchdown, hitting five of seven
passes. It was the first
touchdown given up by the Tro
jans in 10 quarters.
Back-up Card quarterback
Mike Cordova did a good job
after Benjamin departed, direct
ing Stanford to two fourth
quarter touchdowns. Cordova
hit six of six passes for 74 yards,
but he didn't re-open the quar
terback controversy.
As Robinson said, "Stanford
gambled." And the Cards rolled
snake-eyes.
It's hard to imagine how any
one could possibly have thought
that Stanford should represent
the Pacific-tt in the Rose Bowl.
After USC massacred Stanford
48-24 Saturday, not even the
most ardent Cardinal supporters
among the Stanford Stadium
crowd of 76,500 could logically
argue that Stanford should
spend the holidays doing any
thing other than watching UCLA
and Michigan or the Trojans and
Michigan on television.
