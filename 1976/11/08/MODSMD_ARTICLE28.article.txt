# Rally beats 49ers
## Poloers sweep matches 
### Chris Kamel 
It took a strong halftime talk,
complete with sensurround, by
water polo coach Art Lambert to
snap the Cardinals out of a
trance, as the Cards went on not
only to beat Long Beach State
Friday, 9-4, but to sweep their
last homestand with an 18-11
whipping of USC the next day.
With the Cards ahead just 4-2
at the half, Lambert, realiz
ing that Long Beach was follow
ing its same game pattern which
resulted in a 6-5 upset over
UCLA two weeks ago, shook the
players and the windows of the
locker room in pointing out the
Card errors.
"1 told them that they weren't
taking advantage of the scoring
opportunities they had," Lam-

Bert explained. "They seemed
like they felt that getting them
was enough. They just weren't
concentrating."
Cards erupt
It wasn't until Long Beach
State had pulled to within one
goal at 4-3 early in the third quar
ter that Lambert's talk seemed to
sink in. The Cards finally started
to take advantage of their scoring
opportunities. As they did two
weeks ago in their 9-3 win over
California, the Cards did it in
style. Ignited by Robbie Arnold's
drive and by Rick Johannesen's
flip shot back over his head,
Stanford scored three goals in a
four-minute span in the third
period to take a 7-4 lead.
"His speech definitely snap
ped us out of what we were

doing wrong," said Arnold. "\\'e
realized that we couldn't throw
away this game like UCLA did
against them."
Stanford meets UCLA down
south next weekend in a match
that will determine the Pacific-8
leader. Stanford is currently 3-0
in conference play.
USC, which looked so strong
in football this weekend, was, in
contrast, feeble in water polo
Saturday.
'Sloppy game'
Stanford played what Lambert
felt was one of its "sloppiest
games of the season," but in this
case neatness didn't count as a
Card victory over the Trojans
was never in doubt.
Stanford led by as much as
17-7 at one point in the game and
it was Lambert's active substitut
ing that made the game as close
as the score reflects. At the be
ginning of the second half, not
one regular starter was in the
Card lineup.
