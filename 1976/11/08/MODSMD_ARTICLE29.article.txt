JV gridders win
The fans in San Luis Obispo had little to
cheer about during a long third quarter of
cardinal and white pyrotechnics as the
Stanford junior varsity football team
exploded a 15-13 intermission edge into a
42-13 victory over the Cal-Poly Mustangs
Friday afternoon.
Coach Don Frease. now 2-2 with the JVs,
thought that the offense played well in the
second half, but he reserved the bulk of his
praise for the defensive unit. "Those guys
did a super job. Their tackles were crisp, the
backfield was alert and because of that we
forced nine turnovers."
Frease commended the defensive per
formances of Connie VVooldridge, Ted
Maehr, Kelly McDonough, Redmond Burke,
Chuck Renner and John McColl, all of
whom pounced on or picked off the (]al-
Foly football at least once.
Stanford's offense was led by sophomore
quarterback Steve Dils, whose step down
from the varsity ranks this week gave Joe
Rominger a crack at playing safety. Dils
rifled the ball 37 times for 20 receptions, but
his record should have been even better be
cause five or six first half incompletions
were right on the money.
The men up in front of Dils also played a
fine game. "I'd like to credit the offensive
line with a great job of pass blocking,"
Frease said.
Cal Foly's ground game looked frighten
ing in the opening minutes of the game, as
the Mustangs took the kickoff and marched
to an effortless 7-0 lead. But Stanford's de
fense stiffened for the remainder of the con

test, and the Mustangs' only other score
came atter a bad snap gave them the pigskin
only 11 yards from the goal.
The visiting Cards lit up the scoreboard
for the tirst time midway in the first quarter
after a run by Banks. A 30-yard field goal by
David Baum was followed by a nine-yard
scoring slant to star receiver Rick Parker,
giving Stanford a two-point cushion on
which to rest during halftime.
The Cards' offense really began to click in
the third quarter, as it capitalized on three
Mustang turnovers and drove to four
straight touchdowns. Six-point scrambles
by Dils and Mark Lightfoot complemented
10 and 38-yard TD receptions for Parkerand
Baum.
The fourth quarter found all of the Stan
ford JVs getting some valuable practice be
fore the final game of the season next
weekend against California.
A winning season for Frease hangs in the
balance Friday afternoon as the Cardinals
host the Bears in the classic Little Big Came.
Icemen set records
Stanford's ice hockey team had the high
est goal output in its nine-year history Fri
day night when it demolished I ISC 18-6. A
capacity crowd of 200 at Belmont Iceland
watched Stanford bombard the I ISC goalie
with a team record 100 shots-on-goal. Two
Stanford icemen, defenseman Steve Janicek
and forward Crove Nichols, scored hat
tricks (three goals).
The team comes off a 11-1 season last
year, and player-coach Pat Baldwin said en
thusiastically, "We can only be better than
last year." The USC win and a 10-2 victory

over Belmont last week were only "prac
tice" games for the regular season which
begins winter quarter.
"We're beating teams by 10 goals that two
years ago we would have beaten in over
time," claimed captain Danny Schley.
Stanford has lost only two of last year's
players, and this year the team has been
deluged with recruits. Janicek is a former
Harvard star, and goalie Gervin Peters, who
made 66 saves in the two victories, is in top
form.
Booters rally, win
The Stanford soccer team defeated
the University of the Pacific in a thrilling
double overtime victory, 5-1. yesterday. The
game, played in Menlo Park, wound up 1-1
at the end of regulation play. Hob Geiger
scored for Stanford.
Geiger, one of the nation's leading scor
ers, also scored a goal in the overtime play-
Skip Pfeiffer, playing wing for the Gards,
scored two goals himself.
Although Stanford dominated the game,
the team could not move the ball as well as it
should have. The Cards rallied during the
overtime periods, scoring four goals.

weekend against California.
A winning season for Frease hangs in the

Icemen set records
Stanford's ice hockey team had the high
est goal output in its nine-year history Fri
day night when it demolished I ISC 18-6. A
capacity crowd of 200 at Belmont Iceland
watched Stanford bombard the I ISC goalie
with a team record 100 shots-on-goal. Two
Stanford icemen, defenseman Steve Janicek
and forward Crove Nichols, scored hat
tricks (three goals).
The team comes off a 11-1 season last
year, and player-coach Pat Baldwin said en
thusiastically, "We can only be better than
last year." The USC win and a 10-2 victory

over Belmont last week were only "prac
tice" games for the regular season which
begins winter quarter.
"We're beating teams by 10 goals that two
years ago we would have beaten in over
time," claimed captain Danny Schley.
Stanford has lost only two of last year's
players, and this year the team has been
deluged with recruits. Janicek is a former
Harvard star, and goalie Gervin Peters, who
made 66 saves in the two victories, is in top
form.
Booters rally, win
The Stanford soccer team defeated
the University of the Pacific in a thrilling
double overtime victory, 5-1. yesterday. The
game, played in Menlo Park, wound up 1-1
at the end of regulation play. Hob Geiger
scored for Stanford.
Geiger, one of the nation's leading scor
ers, also scored a goal in the overtime play-
Skip Pfeiffer, playing wing for the Gards,
scored two goals himself.
Although Stanford dominated the game,
the team could not move the ball as well as it
should have. The Cards rallied during the
overtime periods, scoring four goals.

Kathy Levinson dribbles downfield for Stanford's field hockey team. The scotchers lost their
first game of the season Friday after winning six straight.
JV gridders win
The fans in San Luis Obispo had little to
cheer about during a long third quarter of
cardinal and white pyrotechnics as the
Stanford junior varsity football team
exploded a 15-13 intermission edge into a
42-13 victory over the Cal-Poly Mustangs
Friday afternoon.
Coach Don Frease. now 2-2 with the JVs,
thought that the offense played well in the
second half, but he reserved the bulk of his
praise for the defensive unit. "Those guys
did a super job. Their tackles were crisp, the
backfield was alert and because of that we
forced nine turnovers."
Frease commended the defensive per
formances of Connie VVooldridge, Ted
Maehr, Kelly McDonough, Redmond Burke,
Chuck Renner and John McColl, all of
whom pounced on or picked off the (]al-
Foly football at least once.
Stanford's offense was led by sophomore
quarterback Steve Dils, whose step down
from the varsity ranks this week gave Joe
Rominger a crack at playing safety. Dils
rifled the ball 37 times for 20 receptions, but
his record should have been even better be
cause five or six first half incompletions
were right on the money.
The men up in front of Dils also played a
fine game. "I'd like to credit the offensive
line with a great job of pass blocking,"
Frease said.
Cal Foly's ground game looked frighten
ing in the opening minutes of the game, as
the Mustangs took the kickoff and marched
to an effortless 7-0 lead. But Stanford's de
fense stiffened for the remainder of the con

test, and the Mustangs' only other score
came atter a bad snap gave them the pigskin
only 11 yards from the goal.
The visiting Cards lit up the scoreboard
for the tirst time midway in the first quarter
after a run by Banks. A 30-yard field goal by
David Baum was followed by a nine-yard
scoring slant to star receiver Rick Parker,
giving Stanford a two-point cushion on
which to rest during halftime.
The Cards' offense really began to click in
the third quarter, as it capitalized on three
Mustang turnovers and drove to four
straight touchdowns. Six-point scrambles
by Dils and Mark Lightfoot complemented
10 and 38-yard TD receptions for Parkerand
Baum.

first game of the season Friday after winning six straight.
JV gridders win
The fans in San Luis Obispo had little to
cheer about during a long third quarter of
cardinal and white pyrotechnics as the
Stanford junior varsity football team
exploded a 15-13 intermission edge into a
42-13 victory over the Cal-Poly Mustangs
Friday afternoon.
Coach Don Frease. now 2-2 with the JVs,
thought that the offense played well in the
second half, but he reserved the bulk of his
praise for the defensive unit. "Those guys
did a super job. Their tackles were crisp, the
backfield was alert and because of that we
forced nine turnovers."
Frease commended the defensive per
formances of Connie VVooldridge, Ted
Maehr, Kelly McDonough, Redmond Burke,
Chuck Renner and John McColl, all of
whom pounced on or picked off the (]al-
Foly football at least once.
Stanford's offense was led by sophomore
quarterback Steve Dils, whose step down
from the varsity ranks this week gave Joe
Rominger a crack at playing safety. Dils
rifled the ball 37 times for 20 receptions, but
his record should have been even better be
cause five or six first half incompletions
were right on the money.
The men up in front of Dils also played a
fine game. "I'd like to credit the offensive
line with a great job of pass blocking,"
Frease said.
Cal Foly's ground game looked frighten
ing in the opening minutes of the game, as
the Mustangs took the kickoff and marched
to an effortless 7-0 lead. But Stanford's de
fense stiffened for the remainder of the con

test, and the Mustangs' only other score
came atter a bad snap gave them the pigskin
only 11 yards from the goal.
The visiting Cards lit up the scoreboard
for the tirst time midway in the first quarter
after a run by Banks. A 30-yard field goal by
David Baum was followed by a nine-yard
scoring slant to star receiver Rick Parker,
giving Stanford a two-point cushion on
which to rest during halftime.
The Cards' offense really began to click in
the third quarter, as it capitalized on three
Mustang turnovers and drove to four
straight touchdowns. Six-point scrambles
by Dils and Mark Lightfoot complemented
10 and 38-yard TD receptions for Parkerand
Baum.
The fourth quarter found all of the Stan
ford JVs getting some valuable practice be
fore the final game of the season next
weekend against California.
A winning season for Frease hangs in the
balance Friday afternoon as the Cardinals
host the Bears in the classic Little Big Came.
Icemen set records
Stanford's ice hockey team had the high
est goal output in its nine-year history Fri
day night when it demolished I ISC 18-6. A
capacity crowd of 200 at Belmont Iceland
watched Stanford bombard the I ISC goalie
with a team record 100 shots-on-goal. Two
Stanford icemen, defenseman Steve Janicek
and forward Crove Nichols, scored hat
tricks (three goals).
The team comes off a 11-1 season last
year, and player-coach Pat Baldwin said en
thusiastically, "We can only be better than
last year." The USC win and a 10-2 victory

over Belmont last week were only "prac
tice" games for the regular season which
begins winter quarter.
"We're beating teams by 10 goals that two
years ago we would have beaten in over
time," claimed captain Danny Schley.
Stanford has lost only two of last year's
players, and this year the team has been
deluged with recruits. Janicek is a former
Harvard star, and goalie Gervin Peters, who
made 66 saves in the two victories, is in top
form.
Booters rally, win
The Stanford soccer team defeated
the University of the Pacific in a thrilling
double overtime victory, 5-1. yesterday. The
game, played in Menlo Park, wound up 1-1
at the end of regulation play. Hob Geiger
scored for Stanford.
Geiger, one of the nation's leading scor
ers, also scored a goal in the overtime play-
Skip Pfeiffer, playing wing for the Gards,
scored two goals himself.
Although Stanford dominated the game,
the team could not move the ball as well as it
should have. The Cards rallied during the
overtime periods, scoring four goals.
