# Scotchers drop first of season
## 
### Debbie Carlton 
The recipe for last Friday's
112 ield hockey game against Chico
State called for all the wrong in
gredients as far as Stanford was
concerned. Unlike Chico, the
scotchers weren't feeling up to
dishing out their usual talent,
and they got roasted 2-1 for their
first loss of the season.
The first half was scoreless.
The habitually late-blooming
scotchers conjured up enough
energy after their slow first half
to produce their first goal with
twelve minutes left in the game.
Junior forward Mandy Read
made the Card's lone point off an
assist from link Sukie Jackson.
Chico State, on the other hand,
"was really hot," according to
Card coach Shirley Schoof.
Psyched to beat the scotchers,
they doubled the Card's score for
the final upset.
Schoof admitted that Stanford
was playing sluggish hockey,
whereas Chico "was sprinting
for the ball. They were more ag
gressive and had more spirit."
Stanford's lack of spirit was
largely due to consistently "de
moralizing" officiating.
Read, the Cards' only scorer,
stated, "The referees were cal
ling sticks every time we hit the
ball. It just got really discourag
ing. I'm not making excuses, be
cause Chico won fair and square,
but the tight calls did affect us
psychologically."
Schoof said the Cards "should
have won the game." She stated,
"We're by far the strongest team,
but sometimes our players need
reminding of that." But. as Read
pointed out. "Losing's a mental
toughener."
As such, the loss may jolt the
Cards into a more energized state
when they take on San lose State
tomorrow in their biggest game
of the season. Last year, the two
teams tied for first place in the
Northern California Intercol
legiate Athletic Conference. At
stake in Tuesday's game is not
only this year's NCIAC title, bifat
a berth in the Regionals Friday
and Saturday. The game will be
held at 1 p.m. on Roble Field.
In junior varsity action, the
Cards defeated Chico State 4-2
with an "outstanding" display
of teamwork and skill, according
to Schoof. Freshman Julia
Johnson (2), Paula Mischima,
and Kathy Lahanas scored for
the scotchers.
