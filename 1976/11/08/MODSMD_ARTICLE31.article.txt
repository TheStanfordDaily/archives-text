Earthquakes strike Iran, Philippines
Tehran, Iran — A severe earthquake struck a mountain
ous region of north-east Iran on Sunday morning, killing
at least 16 persons and injuring 32, according to the relief
agency Red Lion and Sun.
Most of the victims in the Iranian quake lived in the
village of Vandik, where all of the 150 mud-brick houses
collapsed, a spokesman for the Red Lion and Sun said.
That agency is Iran's equivalent of the Red Cross.
The quake's center was placed some 400 miles north
east of Tehran and registered 6.2 on the Richter scale.
Another quake was recorded early today on the island of
Mindanao in the Philippines, but there were no im
mediate reports of casualties or damage there.
Manila's official geophysical observatory reported the
Mindanao quake marked 6.8 on the Richter scale. An
observatory spokesman said it rocked the eastern coast of
Mindanao, the southernmost island in the Philippines.
The epicenter was placed about 400 miles south-east of
Manila.
Carter hopes church policy changes
St. Simons Island, Ga. — Jimmy Carter expressed con
cern today about the whites-only policy of his hometown
Baptist church in Plains, Ga.
The Rev. Clennon King, a black minister from a non
denominational church in Albany, Ga., failed for the sec
ond Sunday in a row to win admittance to the all-white
Plains Baptist Church. But Carter said through an aide that
he has reason to hope his home church policy denying
entrance to blacks will be changed at a church conference
to be held after worship services next Sunday.
The Rev. Mr. King first tried to attend the Plains church
a week ago, but services were cancelled to avoid admitting
him. This Sunday, deacons forcibly restrained King from
entering the church through a basement door.
Mayors offer urban centers solutions
Chicago — Mayors of the nation's cities met yesterday
with a representative of President-elect jimmy Carter in a
search for ways to stem the flight of industry and people
from urban centers.
The mayors and Carter representative Howard Samuels
agreed that the most crucial task is stimulating employ
ment in the cities and stemming the flight of resources and
people to the suburban areas.
New York City Mayor Abe Beame said Carter has
suggested three ways for boosting urban employment —
extending benefits to firms for each person they hire off
the jobless rolls, as increased federal commitment to on
the-job training programs and federal incentives to pre
vent layoffs.
Other incentives suggested by Samuels or the mayors
included an urban development bank, which would use
federal funds to provide business with low-interest loans

for locating or expanding in a city and to cities for funding
certain economic projects.
George Moscone of San Francisco said "We're hurt be
cause we provide jobs to about 250,000 people who live
outside the city."
Richard Fulton of Nashville said another problem fac
ing the nation's big cities is the flight of industry overseas
where labor is cheaper.
Parade marks revolution anniversary
Moscow — The Soviet Union staged one of its smallest
annual military parades in history Sunday to mark the
59th anniversary of the Communist revolution. It pre
sented no new military equipment and even toned down
the marching style of its troops.
There was no official explanation for the toned-down
nature of the parade, but the Soviet government has been
increasing its calls in the past year for ending the arms
race and claims to be decreasing its own military budget.
Sarkis urges occupation 'toleration'
Beirut, Lebanon — President Elias Sarkis called on the
Lebanese people yesterday to tolerate occupation by an
Arab peace force as the only way to save their country from
further destruction.
"1 approach you knowing full well that some of you at
this very moment are still carrying arms, and that the
blood of our martyrs and victims has not yet dried," said
the taciturn former banker in a 10-minute appeal broad
cast over Moslem and Christian stations.
Sarkis spoke out amid increasing violations of a limping
17-day-old truce decreed by Arab kings and presidents
meeting first in Saudi Arabia, then in Cairo.
