# Med School OKs minority plan
## 
### Elizabeth Pollock 
The Medical School Faculty Senate
voted overwhelmingly Friday to keep
its Minority Admissions Committee
(MAC) "as it is now," rather than to
replace it by a Disadvantaged Admis
sions Committee (DAC).
The Medical School reviewed its
minority admissions policy as a result
of the September California Supreme
Court ruling in Bakke vs. The Regents
of the University of California that I JC
was guilty of reverse discrimination in
its admissions procedures.
The Bakke case is important because

the Facult Senate Friday had to assess
the probability of a similar ruling
should a case be brought against the
university and then decide its position
on present admissions policies.
Bakke was ordered admitted to the
medical school when UC proved un
able to show that Bakke would not
have br;en admitted even without the
special program. Initially, the lower
court held that Bakke must shoulder
the burden of proof, but the burden
was shifted to UC at the supreme court
level.
The case is now on appeal to the U.S.

Supreme Court, but should the highest
court take the case, it probably would
not be resolved until next term, ac
cording to John Schwartz, counsel for
medical affairs. The present term ends
in June.
Stay from Supreme Court?
UC has asked the U.S. Supreme
Court for a stay of the state court's find
ing of reverse discrimination which, if
granted, would mean that the pre-
Bakke law would stand until after a
U.S. Supreme Court ruling. However,
Schwartz explained that stays are not
granted very often because, "federal
courts are reticent to interfere with
state courts."
Referring to the Stanford Medical
School's minority admission program,
Schwartz said, "1 think there is re
spectable legal authority for the
legitimacy of our present system." The
question the Senate considered Friday
was "how much this school will
hazard in defense of its social beliefs
and its policies." as G. Mark Cramo
lini, president of the Stanford Medical
Students' Association phrased it.
"We've been tested once and found
to be satisfactory," said Phil Larson,
faculty senate member. Therefore, he
moved that the present system be re
tained.
In a letter dated June 29.1976, Floyd

Fierce, director of the office for civil
rights, region IX, said that an inves
tigator fur the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare, Eileen Kras
kouskas, had investigated a complaint
by Allan I3akke, alleging discrimina
tion here, and"the evidence we found
failed to substantiate his allegation."
Pierce's letter further indicated that
he had communicated the grounds of
the university's refusal of admission to
Bakke and because there was no re
sponse, the case was considered
closed.
The investigation also revealed
"that those minority students entering
through the Minority Admissions
Program are required to meet the same
admissions requirements as non
minority students who enter through
regular channels."
Reasons for DAC
As noted in a position paper submit
ted to the faculty senate by the Native
American Students of Stanford Medi
cal School, the Black Medical Students
of Stanford Medical School and the
Chicano Medical Students of Stanford
Medical School, the reasons for chang
ing the MAC to a DAC are two: 1) a
DAC would make the admission prog
ram here appear more defensible in
light of Bakke; 2) non-minority disad
vantaged students would be included
with the minority disadvantaged
applicants.
However, the position paper said
"we feel the proposed change from the
Minority Admissions Committee
would be the first step in phasing out
the administration's written commit
ment to minorities."
"The minority admissions program
is the only formal organ that deals di
rectly with minorities; we have no
other faculty or administrative body
that advocates for the minorities," the
paper said.
Disadvantaged whites
The paper explained, "We strongly
support non-minority disadvantaged
students . . . however, the situation of
disadvantaged white students are dif
ferent enough that we feel that their
admission should be handled by a
separate committee — either the Regu
lar Admissions Committee (as is now
the case) or some other designated
subcommittee."
On May 16, 1973, the faculty senate
voted "that the minimum goal for stu
dents to be admitted through the
Minority Admissions Program should
be 20 per cent of each entering class."
Since the MAC began with the enter
ing class in September, 1969, the total
class size has been increased by 22
spaces, to a total of H6. Twelve of these
new spaces were designated to be for
minority students. As a result of the
1973 vote, the number of minority stu
dents sought for matriculation was In
creased to a minimum of 17.
This year's minority admissions
procedure is planned to proceed as fol
lows: MAC will receive the applica
tions from all black, chicano and na
tive American applicants; will review
the files; interview and vote on possi
ble candidates and prepare a ranking
of students.
Top of the list
Students at the top of the list will be
referred to RAC where they will again
be interviewed and jointly discussed
with MAC. Of those students from this
pool admitted by RAC, up to three will
be counted towards the minimum goal
of 17 minority students. Any addi
tional students accepted by RAC will
put minority enrollment above 20 per
cent. Remaining top candidates will be

referred back to MAC.
MAC is charged to fill 14 spaces in
the class, or four-fifths of the mini mum
goal. Roy Maffly, chairman of the
MAC, said, "If we have on our list 14
acceptable candidates we will admit
them."
"We always have had" 14 accepta
ble candidates, he said. "If we didn't
have 14 acceptable candidates we
would fall below our minimum goal,"
he added. The current first year class
has a minority enrollment of 19.
Increase in communication
Maff ly explained that a major reason
for dual consideration of minority
candidates is to increase communica
tion between the two committees as to
the nature of minority students'
backgrounds.
The existence of a separate MAC
with minority members was decided
upon by the Senate Committee on
Admissions Policy (SCAP) because,
"SCAP is convinced that evaluation of

the ability of minority applicants to
succeed in the medical school — based
as it is on broad criteria — can best be
made by a group of physicians and
medical students of whom the major
ity are themselves members of minor
ity groups."
The senate recommended that "the
minority admissions process give
primary stress to the same considera
tions as the regular admissions pro
cess, while recognizing the results of
the applicant's socio-economic, edu
cational background."
Stanford's rank
A pamphlet, "Medical School Ad
missions Requirements, 1977-7H"
published by the American Associa
tion of Medical Colleges found that, of
114 medical schools. Stanford ranked
14th in the absolute number of minor
ity students in the student body, anil in
the top six per cent for enrollment rela
tive to class size. Of the 12 schools
with whom Stanford operates in a re
cruitment drive, Stanford ranks sec
ond absolutely in number of minority
students and has the highest percen
tile per class size enrolled.
Maffly said, "the administration
looks at the threat to the program as
being external," that is, that MAC is
not endangered by senate sentiment,
but rather by the existence of litigation
like the Bakke case. Maffly said, "we
ought to work together to guarantee
the continuation of our program."
Vince Quintana, representing the
minority medical students at the Fri
day meeting, said that when he was an
applicant he looked for "honesty in the
minority admissions policies" and
said, "we (minority students) were
here because the faculty senate de
cided that we would be here." He
explained that the minority students
had conferred with outside legal coun
sel and conclude the present program
is defensible on both legal and policy
grounds.

Medical student Raul Zimmerman
summed up the general feeling at the
end of the meeting, "I'm very proud of
the decision (to stand by the present
program) that was made."
He also expressed the hope that "it's
possible that there's a way to keep the
system we've got now and yet avoid
suits."
The Medical School Faculty Senate

its Minority Admissions Committee
(MAC) "as it is now," rather than to

published by the American Associa

114 medical schools. Stanford ranked
14th in the absolute number of minor
ity students in the student body, anil in
the top six per cent for enrollment rela

with whom Stanford operates in a re

ond absolutely in number of minority
students and has the highest percen

Maffly said, "the administration
looks at the threat to the program as

not endangered by senate sentiment,
but rather by the existence of litigation
like the Bakke case. Maffly said, "we
ought to work together to guarantee
the continuation of our program."
Vince Quintana, representing the
minority medical students at the Fri
day meeting, said that when he was an
applicant he looked for "honesty in the
minority admissions policies" and
said, "we (minority students) were
here because the faculty senate de
cided that we would be here." He
explained that the minority students
had conferred with outside legal coun

is defensible on both legal and policy
grounds.

Medical student Raul Zimmerman
summed up the general feeling at the
end of the meeting, "I'm very proud of
the decision (to stand by the present
program) that was made."
He also expressed the hope that "it's
possible that there's a way to keep the
system we've got now and yet avoid
suits."
The Medical School Faculty Senate
voted overwhelmingly Friday to keep
its Minority Admissions Committee
(MAC) "as it is now," rather than to
replace it by a Disadvantaged Admis
sions Committee (DAC).
The Medical School reviewed its
minority admissions policy as a result
of the September California Supreme
Court ruling in Bakke vs. The Regents
of the University of California that I JC
was guilty of reverse discrimination in
its admissions procedures.
The Bakke case is important because

the Facult Senate Friday had to assess
the probability of a similar ruling
should a case be brought against the
university and then decide its position
on present admissions policies.
Bakke was ordered admitted to the
medical school when UC proved un
able to show that Bakke would not
have br;en admitted even without the
special program. Initially, the lower
court held that Bakke must shoulder
the burden of proof, but the burden
was shifted to UC at the supreme court
level.
The case is now on appeal to the U.S.

Supreme Court, but should the highest
court take the case, it probably would
not be resolved until next term, ac
cording to John Schwartz, counsel for
medical affairs. The present term ends

Stay from Supreme Court?
UC has asked the U.S. Supreme
Court for a stay of the state court's find
ing of reverse discrimination which, if
granted, would mean that the pre-
Bakke law would stand until after a
U.S. Supreme Court ruling. However,
Schwartz explained that stays are not
granted very often because, "federal
courts are reticent to interfere with
state courts."
Referring to the Stanford Medical
School's minority admission program,
Schwartz said, "1 think there is re
spectable legal authority for the
legitimacy of our present system." The
question the Senate considered Friday
was "how much this school will
hazard in defense of its social beliefs
and its policies." as G. Mark Cramo
lini, president of the Stanford Medical
Students' Association phrased it.
"We've been tested once and found
to be satisfactory," said Phil Larson,
faculty senate member. Therefore, he
moved that the present system be re
tained.
In a letter dated June 29.1976, Floyd

Fierce, director of the office for civil
rights, region IX, said that an inves
tigator fur the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare, Eileen Kras
kouskas, had investigated a complaint
by Allan I3akke, alleging discrimina
tion here, and"the evidence we found
failed to substantiate his allegation."
Pierce's letter further indicated that
he had communicated the grounds of
the university's refusal of admission to
Bakke and because there was no re
sponse, the case was considered
closed.
The investigation also revealed
"that those minority students entering
through the Minority Admissions
Program are required to meet the same
admissions requirements as non
minority students who enter through
regular channels."
Reasons for DAC
As noted in a position paper submit
ted to the faculty senate by the Native
American Students of Stanford Medi
cal School, the Black Medical Students
of Stanford Medical School and the
Chicano Medical Students of Stanford
Medical School, the reasons for chang
ing the MAC to a DAC are two: 1) a
DAC would make the admission prog
ram here appear more defensible in
light of Bakke; 2) non-minority disad
vantaged students would be included
with the minority disadvantaged
applicants.
However, the position paper said
"we feel the proposed change from the
Minority Admissions Committee
would be the first step in phasing out
the administration's written commit
ment to minorities."
"The minority admissions program
is the only formal organ that deals di
rectly with minorities; we have no
other faculty or administrative body
that advocates for the minorities," the
paper said.
Disadvantaged whites
The paper explained, "We strongly
support non-minority disadvantaged
students . . . however, the situation of
disadvantaged white students are dif
ferent enough that we feel that their
admission should be handled by a
separate committee — either the Regu
lar Admissions Committee (as is now
the case) or some other designated
subcommittee."
On May 16, 1973, the faculty senate
voted "that the minimum goal for stu
dents to be admitted through the
Minority Admissions Program should
be 20 per cent of each entering class."
Since the MAC began with the enter
ing class in September, 1969, the total
class size has been increased by 22
spaces, to a total of H6. Twelve of these
new spaces were designated to be for
minority students. As a result of the
1973 vote, the number of minority stu
dents sought for matriculation was In
creased to a minimum of 17.
This year's minority admissions
procedure is planned to proceed as fol
lows: MAC will receive the applica
tions from all black, chicano and na
tive American applicants; will review
the files; interview and vote on possi
ble candidates and prepare a ranking
of students.
Top of the list
Students at the top of the list will be
referred to RAC where they will again
be interviewed and jointly discussed
with MAC. Of those students from this
pool admitted by RAC, up to three will
be counted towards the minimum goal
of 17 minority students. Any addi
tional students accepted by RAC will
put minority enrollment above 20 per
cent. Remaining top candidates will be

referred back to MAC.
MAC is charged to fill 14 spaces in
the class, or four-fifths of the mini mum
goal. Roy Maffly, chairman of the
MAC, said, "If we have on our list 14
acceptable candidates we will admit
them."
"We always have had" 14 accepta
ble candidates, he said. "If we didn't
have 14 acceptable candidates we
would fall below our minimum goal,"
he added. The current first year class
has a minority enrollment of 19.
Increase in communication
Maff ly explained that a major reason
for dual consideration of minority
candidates is to increase communica
tion between the two committees as to
the nature of minority students'
backgrounds.
The existence of a separate MAC
with minority members was decided
upon by the Senate Committee on
Admissions Policy (SCAP) because,
"SCAP is convinced that evaluation of

the ability of minority applicants to
succeed in the medical school — based
as it is on broad criteria — can best be
made by a group of physicians and
medical students of whom the major
ity are themselves members of minor
ity groups."
The senate recommended that "the
minority admissions process give
primary stress to the same considera
tions as the regular admissions pro
cess, while recognizing the results of
the applicant's socio-economic, edu
cational background."

tions from all black, chicano and na
tive American applicants; will review
the files; interview and vote on possi
ble candidates and prepare a ranking
of students.
Top of the list
Students at the top of the list will be
referred to RAC where they will again
be interviewed and jointly discussed
with MAC. Of those students from this
pool admitted by RAC, up to three will
be counted towards the minimum goal
of 17 minority students. Any addi
tional students accepted by RAC will
put minority enrollment above 20 per
cent. Remaining top candidates will be

referred back to MAC.
MAC is charged to fill 14 spaces in
the class, or four-fifths of the mini mum
goal. Roy Maffly, chairman of the
MAC, said, "If we have on our list 14
acceptable candidates we will admit
them."
"We always have had" 14 accepta
ble candidates, he said. "If we didn't
have 14 acceptable candidates we
would fall below our minimum goal,"
he added. The current first year class
has a minority enrollment of 19.
Increase in communication
Maff ly explained that a major reason
for dual consideration of minority
candidates is to increase communica
tion between the two committees as to
the nature of minority students'
backgrounds.
The existence of a separate MAC
with minority members was decided
upon by the Senate Committee on
Admissions Policy (SCAP) because,
"SCAP is convinced that evaluation of

the ability of minority applicants to
succeed in the medical school — based
as it is on broad criteria — can best be
made by a group of physicians and
medical students of whom the major
ity are themselves members of minor
ity groups."
The senate recommended that "the
minority admissions process give
primary stress to the same considera
tions as the regular admissions pro
cess, while recognizing the results of
the applicant's socio-economic, edu
cational background."
Stanford's rank
A pamphlet, "Medical School Ad
missions Requirements, 1977-7H"
published by the American Associa
tion of Medical Colleges found that, of
114 medical schools. Stanford ranked
14th in the absolute number of minor
ity students in the student body, anil in
the top six per cent for enrollment rela
tive to class size. Of the 12 schools
with whom Stanford operates in a re
cruitment drive, Stanford ranks sec
ond absolutely in number of minority
students and has the highest percen
tile per class size enrolled.
Maffly said, "the administration
looks at the threat to the program as
being external," that is, that MAC is
not endangered by senate sentiment,
but rather by the existence of litigation
like the Bakke case. Maffly said, "we
ought to work together to guarantee
the continuation of our program."
Vince Quintana, representing the
minority medical students at the Fri
day meeting, said that when he was an
applicant he looked for "honesty in the
minority admissions policies" and
said, "we (minority students) were
here because the faculty senate de
cided that we would be here." He
explained that the minority students
had conferred with outside legal coun
sel and conclude the present program
is defensible on both legal and policy
grounds.

Medical student Raul Zimmerman
summed up the general feeling at the
end of the meeting, "I'm very proud of
the decision (to stand by the present
program) that was made."
He also expressed the hope that "it's
possible that there's a way to keep the
system we've got now and yet avoid
suits."
The Medical School Faculty Senate
voted overwhelmingly Friday to keep
its Minority Admissions Committee
(MAC) "as it is now," rather than to
replace it by a Disadvantaged Admis
sions Committee (DAC).
The Medical School reviewed its
minority admissions policy as a result
of the September California Supreme
Court ruling in Bakke vs. The Regents
of the University of California that I JC
was guilty of reverse discrimination in
its admissions procedures.
The Bakke case is important because

the Facult Senate Friday had to assess
the probability of a similar ruling
should a case be brought against the
university and then decide its position
on present admissions policies.
Bakke was ordered admitted to the
medical school when UC proved un
able to show that Bakke would not
have br;en admitted even without the
special program. Initially, the lower
court held that Bakke must shoulder
the burden of proof, but the burden
was shifted to UC at the supreme court
level.
The case is now on appeal to the U.S.

Supreme Court, but should the highest
court take the case, it probably would
not be resolved until next term, ac
cording to John Schwartz, counsel for
medical affairs. The present term ends
in June.
Stay from Supreme Court?
UC has asked the U.S. Supreme
Court for a stay of the state court's find
ing of reverse discrimination which, if
granted, would mean that the pre-
Bakke law would stand until after a
U.S. Supreme Court ruling. However,
Schwartz explained that stays are not
granted very often because, "federal
courts are reticent to interfere with
state courts."
Referring to the Stanford Medical
School's minority admission program,
Schwartz said, "1 think there is re
spectable legal authority for the
legitimacy of our present system." The
question the Senate considered Friday
was "how much this school will
hazard in defense of its social beliefs
and its policies." as G. Mark Cramo
lini, president of the Stanford Medical
Students' Association phrased it.
"We've been tested once and found
to be satisfactory," said Phil Larson,
faculty senate member. Therefore, he
moved that the present system be re
tained.
In a letter dated June 29.1976, Floyd

Fierce, director of the office for civil
rights, region IX, said that an inves
tigator fur the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare, Eileen Kras
kouskas, had investigated a complaint
by Allan I3akke, alleging discrimina
tion here, and"the evidence we found
failed to substantiate his allegation."
Pierce's letter further indicated that
he had communicated the grounds of
the university's refusal of admission to
Bakke and because there was no re
sponse, the case was considered
closed.
The investigation also revealed
"that those minority students entering
through the Minority Admissions
Program are required to meet the same
admissions requirements as non
minority students who enter through
regular channels."
Reasons for DAC
As noted in a position paper submit
ted to the faculty senate by the Native
American Students of Stanford Medi
cal School, the Black Medical Students
of Stanford Medical School and the
Chicano Medical Students of Stanford
Medical School, the reasons for chang
ing the MAC to a DAC are two: 1) a
DAC would make the admission prog
ram here appear more defensible in
light of Bakke; 2) non-minority disad
vantaged students would be included
with the minority disadvantaged
applicants.
However, the position paper said
"we feel the proposed change from the
Minority Admissions Committee
would be the first step in phasing out
the administration's written commit
ment to minorities."
"The minority admissions program
is the only formal organ that deals di
rectly with minorities; we have no
other faculty or administrative body
that advocates for the minorities," the
paper said.
Disadvantaged whites
The paper explained, "We strongly
support non-minority disadvantaged
students . . . however, the situation of
disadvantaged white students are dif
ferent enough that we feel that their
admission should be handled by a
separate committee — either the Regu
lar Admissions Committee (as is now
the case) or some other designated
subcommittee."
On May 16, 1973, the faculty senate
voted "that the minimum goal for stu
dents to be admitted through the
Minority Admissions Program should
be 20 per cent of each entering class."
Since the MAC began with the enter
ing class in September, 1969, the total
class size has been increased by 22
spaces, to a total of H6. Twelve of these
new spaces were designated to be for
minority students. As a result of the
1973 vote, the number of minority stu
dents sought for matriculation was In
creased to a minimum of 17.
This year's minority admissions
procedure is planned to proceed as fol

of Stanford Medical School and the
Chicano Medical Students of Stanford
Medical School, the reasons for chang
ing the MAC to a DAC are two: 1) a
DAC would make the admission prog
ram here appear more defensible in
light of Bakke; 2) non-minority disad
vantaged students would be included
with the minority disadvantaged
applicants.
However, the position paper said
"we feel the proposed change from the
Minority Admissions Committee
would be the first step in phasing out
the administration's written commit
ment to minorities."
"The minority admissions program
is the only formal organ that deals di
rectly with minorities; we have no
other faculty or administrative body
that advocates for the minorities," the
paper said.
Disadvantaged whites
The paper explained, "We strongly
support non-minority disadvantaged
students . . . however, the situation of
disadvantaged white students are dif
ferent enough that we feel that their
admission should be handled by a
separate committee — either the Regu
lar Admissions Committee (as is now
the case) or some other designated
subcommittee."
On May 16, 1973, the faculty senate
voted "that the minimum goal for stu
dents to be admitted through the
Minority Admissions Program should
be 20 per cent of each entering class."
Since the MAC began with the enter
ing class in September, 1969, the total
class size has been increased by 22
spaces, to a total of H6. Twelve of these
new spaces were designated to be for
minority students. As a result of the
1973 vote, the number of minority stu
dents sought for matriculation was In
creased to a minimum of 17.
This year's minority admissions
procedure is planned to proceed as fol
lows: MAC will receive the applica
tions from all black, chicano and na
tive American applicants; will review
the files; interview and vote on possi
ble candidates and prepare a ranking
of students.
Top of the list
Students at the top of the list will be
referred to RAC where they will again
be interviewed and jointly discussed
with MAC. Of those students from this
pool admitted by RAC, up to three will
be counted towards the minimum goal
of 17 minority students. Any addi
tional students accepted by RAC will
put minority enrollment above 20 per
cent. Remaining top candidates will be

referred back to MAC.
MAC is charged to fill 14 spaces in
the class, or four-fifths of the mini mum
goal. Roy Maffly, chairman of the
MAC, said, "If we have on our list 14
acceptable candidates we will admit
them."
"We always have had" 14 accepta
ble candidates, he said. "If we didn't
have 14 acceptable candidates we
would fall below our minimum goal,"
he added. The current first year class
has a minority enrollment of 19.
Increase in communication
Maff ly explained that a major reason
for dual consideration of minority
candidates is to increase communica
tion between the two committees as to
the nature of minority students'
backgrounds.
The existence of a separate MAC
with minority members was decided
upon by the Senate Committee on
Admissions Policy (SCAP) because,
"SCAP is convinced that evaluation of

the ability of minority applicants to
succeed in the medical school — based
as it is on broad criteria — can best be
made by a group of physicians and
medical students of whom the major
ity are themselves members of minor
ity groups."
The senate recommended that "the
minority admissions process give
primary stress to the same considera
tions as the regular admissions pro
cess, while recognizing the results of
the applicant's socio-economic, edu
cational background."
Stanford's rank
A pamphlet, "Medical School Ad
missions Requirements, 1977-7H"
published by the American Associa
tion of Medical Colleges found that, of
114 medical schools. Stanford ranked
14th in the absolute number of minor
ity students in the student body, anil in
the top six per cent for enrollment rela
tive to class size. Of the 12 schools
with whom Stanford operates in a re
cruitment drive, Stanford ranks sec
ond absolutely in number of minority
students and has the highest percen
tile per class size enrolled.
Maffly said, "the administration
looks at the threat to the program as
being external," that is, that MAC is
not endangered by senate sentiment,
but rather by the existence of litigation
like the Bakke case. Maffly said, "we
ought to work together to guarantee
the continuation of our program."
Vince Quintana, representing the
minority medical students at the Fri
day meeting, said that when he was an
applicant he looked for "honesty in the
minority admissions policies" and
said, "we (minority students) were
here because the faculty senate de
cided that we would be here." He
explained that the minority students
had conferred with outside legal coun
sel and conclude the present program
is defensible on both legal and policy
grounds.

Medical student Raul Zimmerman
summed up the general feeling at the
end of the meeting, "I'm very proud of
the decision (to stand by the present
program) that was made."
He also expressed the hope that "it's
possible that there's a way to keep the
system we've got now and yet avoid
suits."
The Medical School Faculty Senate
voted overwhelmingly Friday to keep
its Minority Admissions Committee
(MAC) "as it is now," rather than to
replace it by a Disadvantaged Admis
sions Committee (DAC).
The Medical School reviewed its
minority admissions policy as a result
of the September California Supreme
Court ruling in Bakke vs. The Regents
of the University of California that I JC
was guilty of reverse discrimination in
its admissions procedures.
The Bakke case is important because

the Facult Senate Friday had to assess
the probability of a similar ruling
should a case be brought against the
university and then decide its position
on present admissions policies.
Bakke was ordered admitted to the
medical school when UC proved un
able to show that Bakke would not
have br;en admitted even without the
special program. Initially, the lower
court held that Bakke must shoulder
the burden of proof, but the burden
was shifted to UC at the supreme court
level.
The case is now on appeal to the U.S.

Supreme Court, but should the highest
court take the case, it probably would
not be resolved until next term, ac
cording to John Schwartz, counsel for
medical affairs. The present term ends
in June.
Stay from Supreme Court?
UC has asked the U.S. Supreme
Court for a stay of the state court's find
ing of reverse discrimination which, if
granted, would mean that the pre-
Bakke law would stand until after a
U.S. Supreme Court ruling. However,
Schwartz explained that stays are not
granted very often because, "federal
courts are reticent to interfere with
state courts."
Referring to the Stanford Medical
School's minority admission program,
Schwartz said, "1 think there is re
spectable legal authority for the
legitimacy of our present system." The
question the Senate considered Friday
was "how much this school will
hazard in defense of its social beliefs
and its policies." as G. Mark Cramo
lini, president of the Stanford Medical
Students' Association phrased it.
"We've been tested once and found
to be satisfactory," said Phil Larson,
faculty senate member. Therefore, he
moved that the present system be re
tained.
In a letter dated June 29.1976, Floyd

Fierce, director of the office for civil
rights, region IX, said that an inves
tigator fur the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare, Eileen Kras
kouskas, had investigated a complaint
by Allan I3akke, alleging discrimina
tion here, and"the evidence we found
failed to substantiate his allegation."
Pierce's letter further indicated that
he had communicated the grounds of
the university's refusal of admission to
Bakke and because there was no re
sponse, the case was considered
closed.
The investigation also revealed
"that those minority students entering
through the Minority Admissions
Program are required to meet the same
admissions requirements as non
minority students who enter through
regular channels."
Reasons for DAC
As noted in a position paper submit
ted to the faculty senate by the Native
American Students of Stanford Medi
cal School, the Black Medical Students
of Stanford Medical School and the
Chicano Medical Students of Stanford
Medical School, the reasons for chang
ing the MAC to a DAC are two: 1) a
