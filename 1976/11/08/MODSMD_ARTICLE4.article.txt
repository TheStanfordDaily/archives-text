# Med School OKs minority plan
## 
### Elizabeth Pollock 
The Medical School Faculty Senate
voted overwhelmingly Friday to keep
its Minority Admissions Committee
(MAC) "as it is now," rather than to
replace it by a Disadvantaged Admis
sions Committee (DAC).
The Medical School reviewed its
minority admissions policy as a result
of the September California Supreme
Court ruling in Bakke vs. The Regents
of the University of California that I JC
was guilty of reverse discrimination in
its admissions procedures.
The Bakke case is important because

the Facult Senate Friday had to assess
the probability of a similar ruling
should a case be brought against the
university and then decide its position
on present admissions policies.
Bakke was ordered admitted to the
medical school when UC proved un
able to show that Bakke would not
have br;en admitted even without the
special program. Initially, the lower
court held that Bakke must shoulder
the burden of proof, but the burden
was shifted to UC at the supreme court
level.
The case is now on appeal to the U.S.

Supreme Court, but should the highest
court take the case, it probably would
not be resolved until next term, ac
cording to John Schwartz, counsel for
medical affairs. The present term ends
in June.
Stay from Supreme Court?
UC has asked the U.S. Supreme
Court for a stay of the state court's find
ing of reverse discrimination which, if
granted, would mean that the pre-
Bakke law would stand until after a
U.S. Supreme Court ruling. However,
Schwartz explained that stays are not
granted very often because, "federal
courts are reticent to interfere with
state courts."
Referring to the Stanford Medical
School's minority admission program,
Schwartz said, "1 think there is re
spectable legal authority for the
legitimacy of our present system." The
question the Senate considered Friday
was "how much this school will
hazard in defense of its social beliefs
and its policies." as G. Mark Cramo
lini, president of the Stanford Medical
Students' Association phrased it.
"We've been tested once and found
to be satisfactory," said Phil Larson,
faculty senate member. Therefore, he
moved that the present system be re
tained.
In a letter dated June 29.1976, Floyd

Fierce, director of the office for civil
rights, region IX, said that an inves
tigator fur the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare, Eileen Kras
kouskas, had investigated a complaint
by Allan I3akke, alleging discrimina
tion here, and"the evidence we found
failed to substantiate his allegation."
Pierce's letter further indicated that
he had communicated the grounds of
the university's refusal of admission to
Bakke and because there was no re
sponse, the case was considered
closed.
The investigation also revealed
"that those minority students entering
through the Minority Admissions
Program are required to meet the same
admissions requirements as non
minority students who enter through
regular channels."
Reasons for DAC
As noted in a position paper submit
ted to the faculty senate by the Native
American Students of Stanford Medi
cal School, the Black Medical Students
of Stanford Medical School and the
Chicano Medical Students of Stanford
Medical School, the reasons for chang
ing the MAC to a DAC are two: 1) a
DAC would make the admission prog
ram here appear more defensible in
light of Bakke; 2) non-minority disad
