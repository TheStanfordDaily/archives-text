# Stanford population votes Democratic
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Voters here on The Farm cast a grea
ter number of Democratic ballots than
the national electorates during last
Tuesday's election, voting very much
as predicted by a Doily poll.
President-elect Jimmy Carter, who
won the nation's highest office with a
51 per cent of the vote, received 66 per
cent of the vote cast in on-campus pre
cincts, a total of 4178 votes.
President Cerald Ford received 34
per cent of the on-campus vote, or 1432
votes.
Harris favored
David Harris, former student body
president here, the Democratic candi
date for Congress in the 12th Distric,
carried the campus 2445 votes, or 56
per cent. This percentage is close to the
55 per cent for him in the survey.
Republican incumbent Pete
McCloskey trailed Harris on campus
by about 500 votes.
McCloskey had been the choice of 32
per cent of those polled in the under
graduate survey, and may have won
the votes of the 13 per cent who were
still undecided.
Tunney better off here
Incumbent U.S. Senator John Tun
ney did considerably better here than
he did statewide, where he lost to
semanticist S.I. Hayakawa, 51 percent
to 49 per cent. Some 3065 voters here
(73 per cent) preferred Yale graduate
Tunney compared to 1122 voters (27
per cent) who chose the former univer
sity president who describes himself
hs a "Republican unpredictable."
Those voting 'Yes' on Prop. 14. the
farmworker initiative, numbered 3088
votes, or 69 per cent.

Pollster Mervyn Field, director of
the California Poll, observed last week
that it may have been Tunney's en
thusiastic support of Prop. 14 that led
to his defeat.
Incumbent Assemblyman Victor
Calvo, who carried the 21st State As
sembly District easily, had no trouble
here either, winning 2768 votes (78 per
cent) to Republican opponent Sandy
Sanger's 790.
Better turnout
The thirteen precincts in the univer
sity area had 6500 persons registerd, of
which 4478 voted (69 per cent). This
turnout is considerably higher than
this year's nationwide voting partici
pation level of about 53 per cent.
The congressional race between
Harris and McCloskey generated the
most interest, with 97 per cent of those
voting casting a ballot for one of the
two former Stanford students. The two
major party candidates in the presi
dential and U.S. Senate races received
93 per cent of the vote in each of these
contests, while only 79 per cent of
those voting recorded a choice for the
assembly race.
The vote distribution was remarka
bly consistent from one university pre
cinct to another. Carter's percentage
was never lower than 52 per cent here,
with most of his scores falling in the 60
per cent range.
In the two precincts where Ford got
more than 45 per cent of the presiden
tial vote, the 'Yes' vote on Prop. 14
recorded two of its three lowest per
centages. 63.7 and 65.2 per cent.
Prop. 14's second lowest level of
support, 64.1 per cent, came in the
only precinct where McCloskey de
feated Harris. 61.1 per cent to 38.8 per
cent.
