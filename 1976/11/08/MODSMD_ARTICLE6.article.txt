# Inflation may complicate Carter's economic programs
## 
### 
Washington â€” An economic ad
viser to President-elect Jimmy Carter is
worried that inflation could raise an
early challenge to his economic prog
rams next year, forcing him to resort to
special anti-inflation measures to save
them.
Carter said during his campaign he
would like to have standby authority
to impose wage and price controls if
needed, but that he did not think they
would ever be used.
However, economic statistics issued
last week have caused at least one Car
ter economic adviser to wonder
whether inflation will not be more of a
problem than Carter thought.
The Labor Department's report on
wholesale prices for October showed
industrial prices increased a full one
per cent, the biggest increase in a year.

Even worse, industrial prices have in
creased at a steady rate for the past five
months. Eventually, these increases
will show up at the consumer level.
Another increase in world oil prices
appears certain when the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries
meets in mid-December, raising oil
prices possibly as much as 15 per cent.
Higher prices for gasoline, heating oil
and overall production costs would be
the inevitable result.
Unemployment
Along with wholesale prices, un
employment also increased in Oc
tober, to 7.9 per cent, raising the possi
bility for one adviser that Carter could
be severely tested early in his ad
ministration with both worsening in
flation and an unemployment rate

stuck ale nearly 8 per cent.
"If that happens, one has to consider
the full range of options he has been
talking about on the price side," said
the adviser, who did not want to be
quoted by name.
He s.iid Carter probably would not
push C ongress for authority to impose
controlis if inflation stayed at around 5
to 6 p'.ir cent, but would want such
authority if price hikes began to ap
proach levels of 10 per cent or more.
Council on industries
Carter also favors giving authority to
the Council on Wage and Price Stabil
ity to d olay price increases in some key
industries.
Advisers say he almost certainly
will follow through early in his ad
ministration on a plan to convene a
confere nee of business, labor and gov
ernment leaders to seek a cooperative
approach toward restraining price
hikes.
While Carter was critical of Ford's
anti-inflation program, he neverthe
less had counted on taking office with
a stable rate of inflation of about 6 per
cent a year. Both Carter and Ford ad
visers v/ere in agreement that this was
the underlying rate of inflation in the
economiy that could endure for years.
Additional spending
Ford's economists predicted Carter
could do little additional federal
spending without pushing the infla
tion rato higher. But Carter's top ad
viser, Lawrence R. Klein, said as re
cently as last week there is sufficient
slack in the economy to allow for new
Carter programs without making infla
tion worse.
Carter said in a post-election news
conference he will consider a tax cut
early in his administration to stimulate
the economy if the current economic
slowdown continues much longer. A
tax cut also could add to inflation, al
though it is not certain that it would.
Carte r said he believes "the only true
long-ter m solution" to U.S. economic
problems is through jobs in the private
sector.
"If the decline continues, considera
tions of a tax reduction for low and
middle income citizens may be in or
der. . . we must find ways to increase
employment without increasing infla
tion, through the use of private incen
tives to the private sector to hire and
train t he unemployed and through
employment programs carefully
targeted to areas of greatest need." Car
