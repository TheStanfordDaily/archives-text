# Minority admissions

The annual report for 1975-76 of the
Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid (CUAFA),
which appeared in the Sept. 29 issue of
Campus Report, brings to mind the De
Funis, Bukke and similar cases attack
ing minority admissions and financial
aid efforts in predominantly white
universities. There are several points
to be made about these cases.
First, one can only wonder about the
character of individuals who would
file such a suit. One can assume they
would not be eager to confess or state
with pride to their friends and, 10, their
clients, that the only way they were
able to get into professional school was
by legally attacking a school's efforts
to increase the number of minorities in
those professions.
Tragedy
Beyond the plaintiffs' own selfish
ness, the tragedy of the matter is that
the minority students who would have
been admitted under such programs
would have been of greater social util
ity to minority communities than
those whites to society in general who
are admitted by the defeat of minority
programs.
This statement is made fully aware
that many minority students are en
rol led on purely competitive grounds.
Second, there are criteria other than
scholastic achievement that are used
to select students. Majority males tend
to dominate the enrollment at most
universities; most universities have a
special program for admitting and
providing financial aid for athletes;
many universities factor in a positive
bias for sons and daughters of faculty
members.
And now, according to the CUAFA
report, Stanford is experimenting with
admitting "older students." Why don't
some of these courageous opponents
of reverse discrimination attack these
methods, and not just those that at
tempt to assist minorities? One con
clusion that could be drawn is that the
motives are racist.
Counteracting statement
Third, it is infuriating to hear the
often counteracting statement, "But
that's reverse discrimination," when
referring to minority admissions and
financial aid programs. Irrespective of
the law or the constitution, one finds it
quite difficult to accept this hypocriti
cal position, in light of centuries of
relative insensitivity to racism against
black people, preceded by the most
vicious form of slavery mankind has
ever.cknown.
It is saddening to note that more has
been done in the last five years in com-

bating reverse discrimination (and
there is little of that really) than was
ever done in centuries to eliminate ra
cial discrimination in the first instance
(and there has been much of that).
Interestingly, there are probably a
sizable number of minority applicants
who were not successful in getting
into school, but who were more
academically qualified than some
non-minority students who were ad
mitted. Apparently these minority
applicants cannot file suit based upon
racial discrimination. This suggests
that racial discrimination can only be
asserted in cases in which the plaintiff
is a majority.
Desire to continue
In spite of the legal and constitu
tional issues, actions against reverse
discrimination can be interpreted as a
desire to continue with the racial dis
crimination that has existed over the
years.
Fourth, what about the activities of
the universities as defendants in the
courts, and as defenders of their
minority programs outside the courts?
One favorable comment that can be
made is that those universities that
have been sued have taken, or will
take, their cases to the U.S. Supreme
Court. Some questions have been
raised, however, about the quality and
vigor of the defenses these universities
have been presenting.
What remains to be seen also is how
steadfastly our universities that have
not been sued, like Stanford, maintain
their minority programs, no matter
how effective they may be.
Fifth, the role of the judicial system
deserves comment. It is noteworthy
that scores of years were required for
the courts to rule on the unconstitu
tionality of racial discrimination in
public schools. And even then the
courts politely "requested" belligerent
schools to desegregate "with deliber
ate speed," which apparently meant
"at your leisure."
On the other hand, note the quick
ness with which the courts have
moved on the issue of so-called re
versed discrimination.
Sometimes equity should not follow
the law, and it can precede law when
the people so want, and it should in the
case of facilitating minority programs
ofvarious kinds. It seems as though the
only type of law black people can look
forward to for effective enforcement in
their communities is martial law.
