# Rumors fly after USC loss
## 
### Chris Baker 
Football coach Jack Christiansen,
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz and the
Cardinals aren't paying much atten
tion to two newspaper reports that a
"wealthy group of Stanford
alumni" are pressuring Ruetz to fire
Christiansen at the end of the cur
rent grid season.
"It's a hazard of coaches for
people to speculate," said Christ
iansen. "I have the same comment
that 1 had before. I have a five year
contract which has two years to run.
1 intend to honor my end of it."
Ruetz said that he has not been
approached by anyone offering to
buy up Christiansen's contract. "No
one has ever done that and 1
wouldn't accept it if they did.
"These are decisions that 1
make," added Ruetz.
Los Angeles Times columnist
John Hall, a Stanford alumnus, re
ported Friday, "The word is nearly
positive that Stanford will replace
football coach Jack Christiansen at
the end of the season. His successor
is likely to be UC-Davis graduate
Paul Hackett
Hackett
Hackett, 29, is in his first year as
quarterbacks and receivers coach at
USC. Prior to this season, he served
three years in the same position at
UC-Berkeley. where he tutored

Steve Bartkowski, Joe Roth. Steve
Rivera and Wesley Walker, among
others.
Hackett told the Palo Alto Times
Saturday. "As far as I'm concerned
they have a football coach...and a
very good one. They won three or
four games in a row before meeting
us."
"To an swer your question 1
haven't been approached — period.
I'm really very sorry this has come
up. 1 feel bad about it."
UPl's reports
United Press International yes
terday quoted one disgruntled
alumnus as saying, "This is the best
team we've had at Stanford in many
years. It should have been more
successful."
"When good athletes don't win.
then you have to blame the
coaches."
Another alumnus said, "The way
this team is coached, it would be
lucky to beat Pomona. How can so
much talent keep on losing?"
Christiansen, who guided the

Alumni pressure builds to oust
Jack Christiansen, but coach
pays no attention to calls

Cards to (>-5 and 7-4 seasons in his
first two years and has a 28-22-3
record, was awarded a five year
contract effective Feb. 1. 1974.
Christiansen said earlier this
year, "It seems with every doctor,
science and engineering degree.
Stanford hands out coaching de
grees.
"When 1 go to a doctor. I respect
his knowledge and background and
follow his advice. I would hope fans
would trust my coaching ability the
same way."
A little over a year ago newspa
pers reported players here were on
the verge of "mutiny" over Christ
iansen's decision to start quarter
back Mike Cordova over Cuv ben
jamin.
Question the coach
"Everybody always questions the
head coach," said benjamin yester
day. "Thealumni are paying money
to the school so they think they
have a say-so about the way things
should be running. They don't—
they're not coaches.

"They criticize Christiansen for
Stanford throwing the ball in the
fourth quarter of the UCLA game,
but he didn't throw the ball. Why
didn't they criticize me. 1 was cal
ling the plays."
"It's unfair. 1 can sympathize
with Christiansen from a quarter
back's standpoint. It's the same
thing. You get a lot of credit that's
not rightfully yours.
People who don't know
"Christiansen is being criticized
by people who don't really know. If
it was by the athletic director, that
would a different story "
Cordova said. "1 think it's pretty
bad if the alumni are running the
school and the football program.
We have enough problems as it is.
"That's what started the three
year mixup (about quarterbacks) in
the first place—alumni telling
coaches what to do.
Christiansen said that the fans
may expect too much. "Year in and
year out there's no way a coach can
compete with USC and UCLA. To
beat them we've gut to have everv
thing in our favor."
Christiansen added that some
fans wanted to lire ex-Card head
coach John Kafcton. now with the
Denver Broncos after his fifth sea
son.
