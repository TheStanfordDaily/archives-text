# Student trustee proposal questionable
## 
### 
A large number of the candidates for this year's
ASSU Senate listed among their proposals a student
member of the Board of Trustees. Few of those
elected made this pitch, but since the topic appears
to surface regularly, it seems fair at this time to point
out that, if the purpose is a stronger voice for student
interests, a student board member is likely to be
counterproductive.
At the outset, those calling for a student board
member should realize that it is extremely unlikely
that they will see any such animal in their lifetimes.
According to Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig, there was not a single voice in
approval of the proposition when ASSU President
Lee Rosenbaum presented it at the board's meeting
last April.
Though it is possible that a handful of the 32
board members kept their support for a student col
league quiet in light of overwhelming opposition,
the lack of any voiced support among a group
elected to five- and 10-year terms does not bode wel 1
for a speedy change in policy.
Even if 17 board members had a sudden change of
heart, however, would a board member from the
student body serve the best interests of either the
university or that member's proposed constituency?
Admittedly, the administration's most common
arguments — that most students don't have the time
or the inclination to sift through the reams of boring
material which lie behind most board decisions, and
that students are merely temporary consumers of the
university's services and have no permanent stake
in its actions — are demonstrably weak.
In fact, few busi ness and professional people, who
make up the largest group on the present board,
have a great deal of time to spend on matters not
related to their careers. Like some students, how
ever, they manage to find time to devote to their
avocations, and there is no reason to believe that an
undergraduate or graduate student here won't be
able to spare the hours for background study.
The "temporary consumer" notion is deceptively
attractive. It would be a reasonable argument were
the present board made up of long-term residents of
the Stanford community whose sole aim was to
maintain the university over the years.
Unfortunately, the board is made up of men and
women who, under the definition which gives stu
dents little stake in the university, have absolutely

no stake in the university. Only eight of the 32
members are even elected by alumni — who pre
sumably have some reason to maintain the prestige
of their diplomas.
The rest of the group is simply selected on an
ongoing basis by the sitting board, and there are no
qualifications on membership.
But the weakness of the administration's argu
ments does not prove the case for a student

member. Advocates of the proposal have never
dealt with the most important question: who will
this student member represent? Will s/he explicitly
represent the ASSU Council of Presidents (COP)?
And if not, to whom will s/he answer?
Most colleges which have student board mem
bers. including the University of California, give
veto power over the selection of the student
member to the board. At many of these institutions,
the entire selection process is in the board's hands.
Thereis noquestionthat.during thecrisisperiod in
which a student board member is most needed, the
board will select one in general agreement with its
philosophy of administration.
The danger in this possibility, and the central
reason for opposing a student board member, is that
if and when the student member, hand-picked by
the board or not, concurs in the board's action, that
concurrence will betaken by both theboqrd and the
administration as the voice of the student body.
As meaningless as actions by the senate and COP
often seem today, their independent status at least
allows for the potential, in a crisis situation, of a
united student voice which must be addressed by
faculty, administration and trustees alike. With a

student board member, this would not be the case.
The student body would be effectively co-opted by
the "student voice" on the board.
At best, with a student member who in every way
personified the student body as a whole and spoke
for each of its diverse groups at the same time,
board decisions might have a single dissenting
vote. While it is true that a forceful advocate could
swing other votes to his side, on a highly emotional
issue the student power on the board would be
pitiably small.
Given that such an ideal individual is not found,
and that the board yields complete authority over
the selection process to the student body, should
the senate or COP require that the student member
vote according to its "representative" wishes?
In view of the fact that board meetings as well as
votes are and will continue to be confidential, and
that portions — often the most controversial — of
the board's agencies are not made public, this could
be extremely difficult.
Especially in cases where the student elected to
the board disagreed with the sentiment of the ASSU
body, the student member would be virtually au
tonomous of the student organization.
Finally, and this argument has also been voiced
upon occasion by administrators, the bulk of the
board's work is affirmative of decisions already
made by university and board committees, which
already have student members. There would be
little effect in having a student member of the af
firming body.
In 90 percent of the questions which come before
the board, decisions are routine and already have
student input from the committee system. In the
few controversial decisions for which a student
board member is sought, the proposed student
voice would be weak, confused, unrepresentative
and would effectively undermine more representa
tive student bodies such as the senate and COP.
A board which had made up its mind to pursue a
policy contrary to the wishes of the student body,
but which had convinced its one student voice that
the policy was a sound one, would look no farther
than its student member to proclaim that the "tem
porary consumers," as well as those with a real
stake in the university, concurred in its actions.
