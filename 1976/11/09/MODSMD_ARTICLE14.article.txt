Fasting is not a new experience for
many students here. Last year more
than 1000 students participated in the
National Day of Fasting. The Stanford
Committee on Hunger, together with
the University Food Service, had stu
dents turn in their meal cards for one
day and permitted the cost of the meals
to he sent to various hunger organiza
tions.
The total amount collected from the
students was $1323.83. Additional
Stanford-related sources brought the
balance to $1400.
A total of $1000 was given to CHOP,
the hunger relief agency of Church
World Service, which channeled the
money to three towns in Tanzania.

Another $200 went to the Northern
California Food Network (NCFN)
which used the money for purchasing
short grain white rice. This organiza
tion distributes food to the needy in
Northern California through a network
of food banks.
The last $200 went to CARE for their
agricultural development programs
overseas.
This year, the Stanford Committee
on Hunger has organized a day of fast
ing on Wednesday. Nov. 17. The
theme for the fast is 1 lungry Children,
trying to develop concern for the mill
ions that are starving or otherwise suf
fering from malnutrition. Working

with Maxine Anderson, director of the
food service, a program has been de
veloped to allow students in the dor
mitory food service to donate the cost
of one day's worth of their meal plan to
the hungry.
Students who wish to fast may sign
up to turn in their meal cards for one
day and will have the opportunity to
choose the organizations they would
like their money to go to.
Today there will be students in the
dormitories collecting the signatures
of those who desire to fast. Similar
programs are being organized in other
living groups on campus.
Those students off campus will have
opportunities to donate the cost of

food for one day at booths that will be
set up in White Plaza.
Various other events will be an
nounced for the lunch and dinner
hours. The evening program will
have a panel discussion open to the
whole community.
Participating in the fast is not just
giving money to the poor but is an
educational experience both for the
individual and the community, lie
coming aware of hunger may make us
wiser decision makers not just on vot
ing day but every day.
