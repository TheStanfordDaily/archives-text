# Press 'decolonization' hurts media
##

The Christian Science Monitor

In the guise of "decolonizing" the
press, many third world countries are
seeking international sanction to put
new shackles on the press. The I Inited
States and other free countries would
be the losers, as well as developing
nations that vitally need the free flow
of information and ideas to keep mov
ing forward.
It is the cruel height of irony that a
movement in this repressive direction
should have gathered force under the
auspices of the United Nations Educa
tion. Scientific and Cultural Organiza
tion (UNESCO) — which was con
ceived to "promote the free flow of
ideas by word and image."
Every effort to restore that original
trust must be made during the General
Conference of UNESCO in Nairobi.

Kenva.
What has to be resisted, among other
things, is a drivefor UNESCO approval
of an insidious "declaration of funda
mental principles governing the use of
the mass media." One of its key articles
says that "stales are responsible for the
activities in the international sphere of
all mass media under their jurisdic
tion."
This is the passage that could pro
vide the excuse for a third world gov
ernment to pressure a correspondent
from the United States or elsewhere by
demanding that his own government
curb his activities.
Even though the declaration would
not be binding, its approval by the
UNESCO conference would permit
governments to exploit it in their own

interests. This despite the rhetoric of
the stated intentions of "strengthening
peace and international understand
ing and combating war. propaganda,
racism and apartheid."
There are better ways to respond to
the legitimate concerns of countries
that consider their development or
way of life threatened by foreign or
domestic media practices.
One way is for the developed world
to offer training to journalists and
media people from the third world.
Quite naturally the developing coun
tries want "balanced" reporting that
covers their achievements as well as
crises. But the only sound way toward
establishing balance is though freeand
responsible competence — not

through governmental intrusion.
Official news needs the constant
check that is provided hy the free
press. Even in the United States the
press constantly has to guard against
the government's encroaching on its
freedom or using it for the govern
ment's interests rather than the
people's.
This heing the case where the press
is conspicuously free, how much more
necessary it is to guard against en
croachments in lands where the strug
gle is just beginning. The task is hard
enough without UNESCO casting its
weight on Jhe wrong side.
