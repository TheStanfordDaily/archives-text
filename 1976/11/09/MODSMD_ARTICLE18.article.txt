# Ombudsman has student assistants
## 
### Barb Johnston 
There are a couple of students
at Stanford who want to hear
other students' problems. Not
(mJy»that, they'll try to solve
They are the om
bwts man's student assistants,
Marsha Wilkes and Margie
Weisz.
• Since the establishment of the
student assistant program last
ye.ar, Marsha and Margie have
handled most of the student
grievances which come into the
office. The program is based on
the assumption that most stu
dents would prefer to voice their
complaints to a peer and "not be
so concerned about meeting the
'.head honcho', especially if they
know what type of grie
vances the ombudsman listens
,to,".says Wilkes.
The ombudsman. Philosophy
Professor John Goheen, feels that
students can be much more sen
sitive to other students' prob
lems than administrators.
The student assistants main
tain office hours on Tuesdays

and Thursdays from 9 to 1 on the
second floor of Tresidder,
around the corner from the
ASSU office. Students can either
drop by during those hours or
contact an assistant through the
office at any other time.
"Folks can drop in and bring
specific complaints or else just
come in and talk about more
general things that are bothering
them," Wilkes said. Everything
the assistants are told is kept in
strict confidence.
The assistants solve most
complaints on their own, refer
ring to Goheen for help and ad
vice when needed. Like om
budsman, they begin by going
directly to the source of the prob
lem and working up the univer
sity hierarchy until the problem
is solved. Because the om
budsman's office has such a
good working relationship with
the administration, they usually
don't have to go very far to find a
solution.
"One of the things the office is

best at is cutting bureaucratic
red tape," according to Wilkes.
''With Stanford being as big as it
is and as structured as it is,
people have a tendency to get
the run-around."
It's not surprising that the
greatest number of complaints
come during registration week.
For example, as a result of many
complaints about course
scheduling ("Everything meets
MWF at 11!"), Marsha and Mar
gie talked to Registrar Sally
Mahony, who is now looking
into the possibility of an overall
procedure to monitor course
scheduling. Says Wilkes,
"Committees look at problems
which they wouldn't ever know
about unless a student came into
the Ombudsman's Office."
Open atmosphere
The student assistant posi
tions were offered through
work-study when Goheen insti
tuted them as a pilot program
last fall. Part of the job included
publicizing the new program. By
holding sherry hours in the

dorms and keeping longer office
hours, they tried to talk, to as
many students as possible. Since
then, the number of students
coming into the office has dou
bled.
Wilkes and Weisz have found
that working for the ombudsman
has changed their outlook on the
university. Wilkes feels that she
has gained "an awareness of
what thi! university is like."
Weisz says, "Now I feel a lot
less futile about things. At first 1
thought the university was a big
power crunch and there was no
thing you could do about it, but I
think there's a little shimmer of
hope somewhere. There's a way
to get around things at this
place...lt can be bent to serve the
needs of the people who go
here."

at Stanford who want to hear
other students' problems. Not

They are the om
bwts man's student assistants,
Marsha Wilkes and Margie
Weisz.
• Since the establishment of the
student assistant program last
ye.ar, Marsha and Margie have
handled most of the student
grievances which come into the
office. The program is based on
the assumption that most stu
dents would prefer to voice their
complaints to a peer and "not be
so concerned about meeting the
'.head honcho', especially if they
know what type of grie
vances the ombudsman listens
,to,".says Wilkes.
The ombudsman. Philosophy
Professor John Goheen, feels that
students can be much more sen
sitive to other students' prob
lems than administrators.
The student assistants main
tain office hours on Tuesdays

and Thursdays from 9 to 1 on the
second floor of Tresidder,
around the corner from the
ASSU office. Students can either
drop by during those hours or
contact an assistant through the
office at any other time.
"Folks can drop in and bring
specific complaints or else just
come in and talk about more
general things that are bothering
them," Wilkes said. Everything
the assistants are told is kept in
strict confidence.
The assistants solve most
complaints on their own, refer
ring to Goheen for help and ad
vice when needed. Like om
budsman, they begin by going
directly to the source of the prob
lem and working up the univer
sity hierarchy until the problem
is solved. Because the om
budsman's office has such a
good working relationship with
the administration, they usually
don't have to go very far to find a
solution.
"One of the things the office is

best at is cutting bureaucratic
red tape," according to Wilkes.
''With Stanford being as big as it
is and as structured as it is,
people have a tendency to get
the run-around."
It's not surprising that the
greatest number of complaints
come during registration week.
For example, as a result of many
complaints about course
scheduling ("Everything meets
MWF at 11!"), Marsha and Mar
gie talked to Registrar Sally
Mahony, who is now looking
into the possibility of an overall
procedure to monitor course
scheduling. Says Wilkes,
"Committees look at problems
which they wouldn't ever know
about unless a student came into
the Ombudsman's Office."
Open atmosphere
The student assistant posi
tions were offered through
work-study when Goheen insti
tuted them as a pilot program
last fall. Part of the job included
publicizing the new program. By
holding sherry hours in the

dorms and keeping longer office
hours, they tried to talk, to as
many students as possible. Since
then, the number of students
coming into the office has dou
bled.
Wilkes and Weisz have found
that working for the ombudsman
has changed their outlook on the
university. Wilkes feels that she
has gained "an awareness of
what thi! university is like."
Weisz says, "Now I feel a lot
less futile about things. At first 1
thought the university was a big
power crunch and there was no
thing you could do about it, but I
think there's a little shimmer of
hope somewhere. There's a way
to get around things at this
place...lt can be bent to serve the
needs of the people who go
here."
