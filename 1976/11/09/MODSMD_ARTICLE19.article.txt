# Med Center does research to help too-short children
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Eighteen children between the
ages ol 2' j and 1H nil I fit? receiv
ing pituitary growth hormone at
the Medical Center here as part
of an ongoing research and
treatment program, according to
Raymond Hintz. assistant pro
fessor of pediatrics at the Medi
cal School.
Hintz pointed out in an inter
view last week that "only human
pituitary hormone works in hu
mans." and that it can only be
donated posthumously.
He said that such donations
increased during the HHiO's to a
"plateau" of around 70.()()() per
year, which is now the current
level of supply.
One gland, said I lint, contains
enough hormone for about five
shots. Since the treatment of
children involves three shots per
week, he says, one gland is
enough to treat one child for
about two weeks. The treatment
therefore requires, 25 to !H)
glands per child per year. That
means ,i maximum of :<()()() chil
dren who can be treated in a
year, but since not all the hor
mone can go to treating children
(some is used for more basic re
search). the number that can ac
tually be treated is less than that.
Diagnosis and treatment
Hintz explained that
specialized tests were necessary
to determine whether the short
ness of abnormally short chil
dren was due to pituitary hor
mone deficiency or to other
causes, such as short parents or
some disease other than pituit
ary insufficiency.
In about one-third of the cases
involving pituitary insuffi
ciency. the cause is a brain
tumor. In the other two-thirds,
said Hintz, the cause is said to be
"idiopathic" (literally, the thing

causes itself) which is, he said, a
way of saying that "we don't
know what causes it.' 1
Once a child has been ac
cepted into the program, she or
he receives about 1 10 cc of the
hormone per kilogram of body
weight three times a week by in
tramuscular injection.
"Ninety per cent of the sub
jects respond within two or three
months." said Hint/.. "Ten per
cent respond really well, two
thirds pretty well, some sort of
well.and ten percent notatall."
He said the treatment usually
stops after the child reaches a
height of five feet or above.
The subject who has been re
ceiving treatment the longest
that Hint/ knows about is a child
ol 11 who has been receiving the
hormone since he was 3 and "is
still responding."
Hint/, said that in some cases
(around five percent) the subject
develops antibodies to the hor
mone atter the first treatment
and fails to respond thereafter.
Other problems involved in the
treatment, he said, include
"itching and redness" after the
injections.
More need it
llintz said that "we have five
additional children waiting who
could benefit" from the treat
ment if more hormone were av
ailable. Nationwide, he said,
there were "twice as many
around as are on treatment". The
figures tor growth hormone
deficient children is one in
10,000, while the number cur
rently being treated is around
one in 20,000.
The hormone used in the pro
ject here, as well as that used in a
similar program run at Yale
Medical School, is supplied by
the National Pituitary Agency, a
division ol the National Institute

of Health. To receive the hor
mone from t fi.it source, one must
get it through a recognized re
search project. There is no
charge to subjects receiving the
hormone in this manner.
There is also a private corpora
tion called Cal-Biochem, in San
Diego, which can provide the
substance for $2500 to $.!()()() per
year to individuals who have
been screened by private physi
cians. including an endoc
rinologist. Hintz said that Cal-
Biochem gets its supplies of the
pituitary hormone from Latin
America.
Possible further development
Hintz said that relying on
posthumous donations of the
hormone is "not a particuarly
good way." ife said that hope for
the future in treating growth
disorders caused by pituitary de
ficiency lies in efforts to 1) iso
late and synthesize the
hypothalmic messenger chemi
cal that stimulates the pituitary
gland to produce the growth
hormone; 2) synthesize either
thi; growth hormone itself or its
active parts (a difficult task not
yet accomplished due to the
complexity ot the molecule); or
3) isolate and synthesize the
smaller somatomedian chemi
cal. which is itself produced by
the pituitary hormoneand seems
to provide the direct signal to
tissues such as ligaments in
volved in bodily growth.
