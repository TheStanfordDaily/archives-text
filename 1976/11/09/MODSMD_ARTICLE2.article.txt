# Trouble in River City?
## Pinball limited by P.A. city fathers 
### Lonnie Rosenwald 
Lone pinball machines weregranted
amnesty in the city of Palo Alto last
night. But pinball arcades and
machines lined up in adult establish
ments or massage parlors will be
banished from the city during a six
month moratorium which was ap
proved by the City Council.
The new ordinance, which prohibits
the installation of more than two
mechanical devices in any establish
ment. passed in a 7-2 vote, and will go
into effect on Dec. 9. Council men
Byron Sher and Scott Carey opposed
the measure.
"This is real overkill," said Carey,
who supports limitations, rather than a
ban, on mechanical amusement de
vices.
Originally the council considered a
measure to ban all pinball machines,
but last night wrote into the ordinance
an exception allowing the installation
of one or two machines. Councilmem
bers agreed that a single machine
proposed no threat to the community.
"If you can satisfy me that we're
about to pervert the city of Palo Alto by
putting a pinball machine in. sav, the
Catehouse." said John Berwald, "I'll
vote for that ordinance. Otherwise. I'll
vote against it." The Catehouse is a
restaurant in Palo Alto.
Councilman Kirk Comstock
explained that the purpose of the
moratorium was to allow city attor
neys time to draft controlling regula
tions. "We're buying time." he said.
In the meantime, the pinball indus
try is voicing concern about the finan
cial impact of the moratorium.

Richard Parina, president of the Au
tomation Merchandising Company in
San )ose, told the council last night
that his business could not afford the
ban.
"We're not what you think we are,"
said Parina. alluding to allegation
made in the last council meeting that
the marketing of mechanical devices
was really a front for laundering of il
legitimate business funds.

"The whole problem of mechanical
devices is being lumped together with
the question of what's going on in
massage parlors," Parina added.
The pinball issue originally grew
out of concern about an arcade which,
until a few months ago, was operating
adjacent to a massage parlor on El
Camino. The arcade was shut down
and replaced by the headquarters of
congressional candidate David Harris,

but Palo Alto residents have heard that
the former owner, who is currently
serving a prison sentence for tax fraud,
wants to reopen it.
Nancy Buffium, a member of the Co
alition of Concerned Citizens, told the
council that this arcade would cause
"the development of an atmosphere
which I don't think is the kind of
neighborhood we want to see in Palo
Alto."

measure to ban all pinball machines,
but last night wrote into the ordinance
an exception allowing the installation
of one or two machines. Councilmem
bers agreed that a single machine
proposed no threat to the community.
"If you can satisfy me that we're
about to pervert the city of Palo Alto by
putting a pinball machine in. sav, the
Catehouse." said John Berwald, "I'll
vote for that ordinance. Otherwise. I'll
vote against it." The Catehouse is a
restaurant in Palo Alto.
Councilman Kirk Comstock
explained that the purpose of the
moratorium was to allow city attor
neys time to draft controlling regula
tions. "We're buying time." he said.
In the meantime, the pinball indus
try is voicing concern about the finan
cial impact of the moratorium.

Richard Parina, president of the Au
tomation Merchandising Company in
San )ose, told the council last night
that his business could not afford the
ban.
"We're not what you think we are,"
said Parina. alluding to allegation
made in the last council meeting that
the marketing of mechanical devices
was really a front for laundering of il
legitimate business funds.

"The whole problem of mechanical
devices is being lumped together with
the question of what's going on in
massage parlors," Parina added.
The pinball issue originally grew
out of concern about an arcade which,
until a few months ago, was operating
adjacent to a massage parlor on El
Camino. The arcade was shut down
and replaced by the headquarters of
congressional candidate David Harris,

but Palo Alto residents have heard that
the former owner, who is currently
serving a prison sentence for tax fraud,
wants to reopen it.
Nancy Buffium, a member of the Co
alition of Concerned Citizens, told the
council that this arcade would cause
"the development of an atmosphere
which I don't think is the kind of
neighborhood we want to see in Palo
Alto."
Lone pinball machines weregranted
amnesty in the city of Palo Alto last
night. But pinball arcades and
machines lined up in adult establish
ments or massage parlors will be
banished from the city during a six
month moratorium which was ap
proved by the City Council.
The new ordinance, which prohibits
the installation of more than two
mechanical devices in any establish
ment. passed in a 7-2 vote, and will go
into effect on Dec. 9. Council men
Byron Sher and Scott Carey opposed
the measure.
"This is real overkill," said Carey,
who supports limitations, rather than a
ban, on mechanical amusement de
vices.
