# ABA may let lawyers place advertisements
## 
### Chris Wasney 
1 he legal profession in California, following
the lead ot the American Bar Association (AHA),
has somewhat reluctantly begun to ease its long
standing ban on advertising by lawyers. This ac
tion comes as a result of pressure from consumer
groups, the Justice Department and a progressive
movement within the bar. all of whom favor the
loosening of such restrictions, according to a Feb
ruary 14, 197ti article in the New York Times.
Currently, the California Supreme Court is con
sidering a proposal passed by the State Bar Board
of Governors which would allow limited advertis
ing by lawyers in legal directories, telephone di
rectories and law-lists. A similar proposal was
passed by the ABA last February.
It the court approves the proposal, as is ex
pected, lawyers would be allowed for the first
time since 190H to publish such informaton as
area of specialization and fees for initial consulta
tions and specilic services. Additional pertinent
information such as payment plans, educational
background and personal history could also be
included.
1 he controversy over lawyers' advertising is an
old one, which has become especially heated re
cently in the wake of two Supreme Court deci
sions: one banning bar-imposed fee schedules,
and the other declaring unconstitutional a ban of
advertising of abortion service.
The logic in these cases, according to propo
nents of legal advertising, is applicable to the
bar's ban, and it raises the question of whether the
ban is in violation of the First Amendment and
anti-trust laws.
Opposition
Opposition to this porposal has come predomi
nately from the older, conservative faction of the
bar, who charge that advertising would demean

the law by making it seem more like a business
seeking a profit rather than a profession providing
a service. , <
However, many prominent members of the b.\r
in California, including Dean Joseph Leininger of
Stanford Law School, and Paul Valentine, presi
dent of the I'alo Alto Bar Association, favor such
limited advertising. Valentine states, "1 favor the
loosening of restrictions on advertising as a
means of educating the public. It would have.a
good effect on the profession, and it would make
lawyers more responsive to the public."
Favorable aspects
Both Leininger and Valentine agree that from
the consumer's point of view, the effects of adver
tising are favorable. Availability of legal services
will increase because of better communication
between lawyers and the general public.
Specialists will be easier to find, and consumers
will know beforehand the approximate cost of the
services they seek.
Most importantly, lawyers' fees will decrease as
a result of advertising. Bruce Owen, assistant pro
fessor of economics at Stanford, asserts that "price
competition will result from advertising and fues
will go down. The costs of the ads will be passed
along to the consumer, but they will be inconse
quential in comparison to the fee cuts, and the
consumer will benefit."
There is evidence that supports this clainvHn
the form of a 1972 survey by Lee Benham of th' 1
University of Chicago. In that study, Benhsn
showed that the price of eyeglasses was 50 Wt
cent lower in states where suppliers were pernut
ted to advertise than in states where such adverss
i ng was forbidden. This, of'course,'s not to say fh.it
lawyers' fees will decrease that drastically, but i!
does seem to indicate that price competition vvjll
result from advertising.

Stanford Law School, and Paul Valentine, presi
dent of the I'alo Alto Bar Association, favor such
limited advertising. Valentine states, "1 favor the
loosening of restrictions on advertising as a
means of educating the public. It would have.a
good effect on the profession, and it would make
lawyers more responsive to the public."
Favorable aspects
Both Leininger and Valentine agree that from
the consumer's point of view, the effects of adver
tising are favorable. Availability of legal services
will increase because of better communication
between lawyers and the general public.
Specialists will be easier to find, and consumers
will know beforehand the approximate cost of the
services they seek.
Most importantly, lawyers' fees will decrease as
a result of advertising. Bruce Owen, assistant pro
fessor of economics at Stanford, asserts that "price
competition will result from advertising and fues
will go down. The costs of the ads will be passed
along to the consumer, but they will be inconse
quential in comparison to the fee cuts, and the
consumer will benefit."
There is evidence that supports this clainvHn
the form of a 1972 survey by Lee Benham of th' 1
University of Chicago. In that study, Benhsn
showed that the price of eyeglasses was 50 Wt
cent lower in states where suppliers were pernut
ted to advertise than in states where such adverss
i ng was forbidden. This, of'course,'s not to say fh.it
lawyers' fees will decrease that drastically, but i!
does seem to indicate that price competition vvjll
result from advertising.
1 he legal profession in California, following
the lead ot the American Bar Association (AHA),
has somewhat reluctantly begun to ease its long
standing ban on advertising by lawyers. This ac
tion comes as a result of pressure from consumer
groups, the Justice Department and a progressive
movement within the bar. all of whom favor the
loosening of such restrictions, according to a Feb
ruary 14, 197ti article in the New York Times.
Currently, the California Supreme Court is con
sidering a proposal passed by the State Bar Board
of Governors which would allow limited advertis
ing by lawyers in legal directories, telephone di
rectories and law-lists. A similar proposal was
passed by the ABA last February.
It the court approves the proposal, as is ex
pected, lawyers would be allowed for the first
time since 190H to publish such informaton as
area of specialization and fees for initial consulta
tions and specilic services. Additional pertinent
information such as payment plans, educational
background and personal history could also be
included.
1 he controversy over lawyers' advertising is an
old one, which has become especially heated re
cently in the wake of two Supreme Court deci
sions: one banning bar-imposed fee schedules,
and the other declaring unconstitutional a ban of
advertising of abortion service.
The logic in these cases, according to propo
nents of legal advertising, is applicable to the
bar's ban, and it raises the question of whether the
ban is in violation of the First Amendment and
anti-trust laws.
Opposition
Opposition to this porposal has come predomi
nately from the older, conservative faction of the
bar, who charge that advertising would demean

the law by making it seem more like a business
seeking a profit rather than a profession providing
a service. , <
