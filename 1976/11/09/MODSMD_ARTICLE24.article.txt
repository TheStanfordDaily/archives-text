# Pure Prairie League plays old and new
## 
### Mark Wieland 
Anticipating my first visit to
The Boarding House and a good
show by Pure Prairie League, 1
filled lip my wine skin for the
trip up to San Francisco Friday
night. We were seated in the
front row at a table about 10 feet
away from the pedal steel guitar,
and the atmosphere was inti
mate as a cloud of smoke hung
over the small crowd of about
250.
Larry Meyzer, a comedian
traveling with the band, came on
stage at about 11 p.m. Typical
lines on newscasting, laun
dromats and Beaver Cleaver,
along with good sound effects
(his forte ) built up audience
energy for some good country
rock.
Pure Prairie League took the
stage at about 11:45 and opened
with Kansas City Southern from
their Tuo Lane Highway album.
The show was well planned to
keep the audience rocking with
some tunes from their new al
bum. just released about two
weeks ago.
After a brief respite to give
people time to buy another $3.50
pitcher of beer, they went into a
country set starting with I'll
Change Your Flat Tire, Merle.

They continued with Pickin' to
Bent the Devil, featuring John
David Call on the banjo. Then
came the classics Fallin In and
Out of Love and Amy with Larry
Goshorn and George Ed Powell
playing acoustic guitars. Those
were the only two songs from the
Bustin' out album. They mixed
inacoupleofnewtunes with the
old favorites That'll Be the Day
and Two Lane Highway to finish
up the show.
The encore consisted of only
two songs; a new one, and
Dance, Little Sister, Dance.
There were a few notable solo
performances by Call on pedal
steel and Powell on lead guitar.
Powell was more into theatrics
than the rest of the band, and
came right down into the audi
ence dressed in his white suit to
play some impressive lines.
The audience was amused,
considering they only played for
one hour and 45 minutes. A
longer show which included
more tunes off their Pure Prairie
League and Bustin' Out albums
would have been more desirable.
Their recent three-night stand at
The Hoarding House, with two
shows each night, concluded on
Halloween.

came the classics Fallin In and
Out of Love and Amy with Larry
Goshorn and George Ed Powell
playing acoustic guitars. Those
were the only two songs from the
Bustin' out album. They mixed
inacoupleofnewtunes with the
old favorites That'll Be the Day
and Two Lane Highway to finish
up the show.
The encore consisted of only
two songs; a new one, and
Dance, Little Sister, Dance.
There were a few notable solo
performances by Call on pedal
steel and Powell on lead guitar.
Powell was more into theatrics
than the rest of the band, and
came right down into the audi
ence dressed in his white suit to
play some impressive lines.
The audience was amused,
considering they only played for
one hour and 45 minutes. A
longer show which included
more tunes off their Pure Prairie
League and Bustin' Out albums
would have been more desirable.
Their recent three-night stand at
The Hoarding House, with two
shows each night, concluded on
Halloween.
