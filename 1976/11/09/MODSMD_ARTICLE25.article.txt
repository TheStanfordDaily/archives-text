# Gasolin' electrifies rock
## Sophie's hosts Spirit 
### David Parker 
Attention Spirit fans. The 6riginal Spirit,
featuring Randy California and Ed Cas.sidv. along
with Casofin', a Danish group on their first
American tour, performed recently at Sophie's in
Palo Alto. Spirit played a mellow blend of
California-style rock that had the crowd jumping
to their feet for the finale.
Spirit is a southern California enterprise that
has produced one gold album. The Tivelve
Dreams of Doctor Sardonicus. as well as some
outstanding singles, such as' Nature's \Vay."Spirit
has been-together since 1968 but only Randy
California on lead guitar and Ed C.assidv on drums
remain from the original group. John Turlep. the
group's bass player of four months, replaced the
original Mark Andes, who now is working with
the group Firefall. Despite the replacement. Spirit
continues to produce very fine sounds and even
has a soon-to-be-released double live album, the
culmination of four months of concert and club
recordings. The album will be entitled The Thir
teenth Dream, a sequel to The Tivelve Dreams of
Doctor Sardonicus. and will have "sort of a magi
cal mystery" theme, according to Randy Califor
nia.
Casolin', a four-man group presently successful
and on top of things in Europe, produces heavy
electric '60s rock. They insist that they are a popu
lar group to be enjoyed by people of all ages and

towards that end they work to add some melody to
their electrified rock. The rhythm and lyrics were
a 1 ittle simplisticat times bufthey reflect the diffe
rent rock culture development of Europe. I was
reminded of early David Howie as 1 listened to
Casolin'. but Hector, the manager/owner of
Sophie's and rock connoisseur extraordinaire, in
formed me that they were really closer to Mott the
I loople.
This is their first American tour, and they man
aged to stop in New York long enough to record a
single. "The Twilight World." which will he re
leased shortly. Best of luck to Casolin' with their
tourand their new release. The distance across the
Atlantic is a great one and they will need all the
help they can get to overcome the difficult task of
finding a following on this side of the sea.
Sophie's, the 260 California Avenue night spot
which hosted Spirit and Casolin*. is often the
scene of extraordinary Hay Area entertainment. In
the past they have featured such guests as Kenny
Rankin, jazz violinist Jean Luc I'onty and Country
Joe Mac Donald (formerly of the Fish).
It you are looking for fine entertainment, or just
a great way to spend an evening, then look to
Sophie's. This month they will have Maria Mul
daur. Nov. 17 and 18. Jerry Carcia Nov. 15. Ho
Diddley Nov. 12 and 13. Snail on Nov. 19 and 20,
as well as a Reggae group from Kingston, Jamaica,
Soul Syndicate on Nov. 2(i and 27.

It you are looking for fine entertainment, or just
a great way to spend an evening, then look to
Sophie's. This month they will have Maria Mul
daur. Nov. 17 and 18. Jerry Carcia Nov. 15. Ho
Diddley Nov. 12 and 13. Snail on Nov. 19 and 20,
as well as a Reggae group from Kingston, Jamaica,
Soul Syndicate on Nov. 2(i and 27.
Attention Spirit fans. The 6riginal Spirit,
featuring Randy California and Ed Cas.sidv. along
with Casofin', a Danish group on their first
American tour, performed recently at Sophie's in
Palo Alto. Spirit played a mellow blend of
California-style rock that had the crowd jumping
to their feet for the finale.
Spirit is a southern California enterprise that
has produced one gold album. The Tivelve
Dreams of Doctor Sardonicus. as well as some
outstanding singles, such as' Nature's \Vay."Spirit
has been-together since 1968 but only Randy
California on lead guitar and Ed C.assidv on drums
remain from the original group. John Turlep. the
group's bass player of four months, replaced the
original Mark Andes, who now is working with
the group Firefall. Despite the replacement. Spirit
continues to produce very fine sounds and even
has a soon-to-be-released double live album, the
culmination of four months of concert and club
recordings. The album will be entitled The Thir
teenth Dream, a sequel to The Tivelve Dreams of
Doctor Sardonicus. and will have "sort of a magi
cal mystery" theme, according to Randy Califor
nia.
Casolin', a four-man group presently successful
and on top of things in Europe, produces heavy
electric '60s rock. They insist that they are a popu
lar group to be enjoyed by people of all ages and

towards that end they work to add some melody to
their electrified rock. The rhythm and lyrics were
a 1 ittle simplisticat times bufthey reflect the diffe
rent rock culture development of Europe. I was
reminded of early David Howie as 1 listened to
Casolin'. but Hector, the manager/owner of
Sophie's and rock connoisseur extraordinaire, in
formed me that they were really closer to Mott the
I loople.
This is their first American tour, and they man
aged to stop in New York long enough to record a
single. "The Twilight World." which will he re
leased shortly. Best of luck to Casolin' with their
tourand their new release. The distance across the
Atlantic is a great one and they will need all the
help they can get to overcome the difficult task of
finding a following on this side of the sea.
Sophie's, the 260 California Avenue night spot
which hosted Spirit and Casolin*. is often the
scene of extraordinary Hay Area entertainment. In
the past they have featured such guests as Kenny
Rankin, jazz violinist Jean Luc I'onty and Country
Joe Mac Donald (formerly of the Fish).
