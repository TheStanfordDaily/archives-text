# Tubes' insanity in Santa Clara
## 
### Scott Mclntyre 
The lights dimmed and the
tension mounted as Spiderman,
Uncle Sam, Richard Nixon,
Groucho Marx, AliceCooperand
the Mummy roared their thun
derous approval. Cinderella, the
Werewolf, Kiss, two magpies,
several bees, Lucifer and his de
vilettes, numerous apes, one
large yellow star and creatures
from various other planets were
also on hand to cheer on the
Tubes in one of their most in
vogirating recent performances.
The Tubes' recent show at
Santa Clara's Leavey Center was,
to say the least, very strange. The
fact that it was the night before
Halloween only made matters
more insane. Insanity, in fact,
ruled over all else as the cos
tumed audience was on its feet
for most of the evening.
After a short rendition of their
patriotic Proud to Be an Ameri
can. Fee Waybill, lead singer
and method frontman, strutted
onstage with a girl on either arm
and sprang into a lively Tubes
World Tour, supported by a large
movie screen featuring the
Tubes on their zany romp
around the world.
As the song drew to a close,
Fee found his clothes being rip
ped off by his lovely assistants,
leaving him with only a fig leaf.
And as he began singing
Madorn. I'm Adam/Ain't no
other ivomun that's had 'm, the
stage was suddenly cluttered
with prehistoric dinosaurs and
gigantic ants frolicking in an im
aginary Garden of Eden.
Mondo Bondage
After leaving the stage for a
moment, Fee raced back wearing
his notorious Mondo Bondage
outfit, which consisted of a
leather chastity belt topped with
an executioners mask. In the
middle of the tune, the band
broke into their most recent hit
Do n't Touch Me There.
The highlight of the song, at
least as gauged by audience re
sponse, was when Fee buried his
head beneath the girl's dress,
drew a microphone toward his
lips and cried. "Oh. your salty
taste!"
The audience was now forced
to do some work. An applause
scope was set up to register the
response of the audience to three
new songs from the Tubes' up
coming album. The first tune
met with an average amount of

thunderous approval, the sec
ond, a blues number, met with
less than thunderous applause.
But the third, I'm a Ninety
pound Weakling with a Pound of
Flesh, met with an exceptionally
thunderous roar which sent the
applause scope bouncing off the
upper limits of the graph.
Not only did they perform
their own music, hut they made
an excellent argument for the
dearth of talent possessed by the
Captain and Tenille, by perform
ing Love Will Keep Us Together
the way it should be done. The
number was filled with lengthy
guitar rifts, and soulful vocals by
Fee.
But thehighlight of this part of
the show was Paul Anka's Hav
ing My Baby, which was done
with a down-Jamaica-way re
ggae beat that had those mem
bers of the crowd who had pre
viously been standing down on
their knees in fits of hysterical
guffawing. With that, Fee bid
everyone goodnight, and left,
while theTubes' dancers in their
scanty outfits entertained the
crowd.
Quay Lewd
Darkness fell over the stage,
and amidst a cloud of smoke and
a shower of glitter, the notorious
Quay Lewd made his trium
phant entry, accompanied by the
Lewdettes. With his now famous
U-shaped guitar, Quay Lewd
(Fee) broke into a vigorous ver
sion of Boy Crazy while "educa
tional" movies flashed on the sc
reen behind.
Audience participation was
evident throughout the show,
but the crowd literally lit up
when that infamous song, White
Punks on Dope, began. Now, ap
proaching the end of the show,
the entire Tubes road ensemble
— managers and all — made
their way on stage with guitars.
And, as Frankenstein began hit
ting the keys of the synthesizer.
Fee shouted, "Yes, even Fran
kenstein's on dope!" The
applause became deafening; the
Tubes cranked up the amplifiers.
This intense pace kept up for
well over 15 minutes. The crowd
was more than satisfied.
And, when it was all over, the
excitement had yet to die as all
the ghouls and goons in the au
dience decided to make it a night
to remember as they screamed to
their hearts' content.
