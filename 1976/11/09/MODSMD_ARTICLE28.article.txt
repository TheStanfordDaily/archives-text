# Steve Martin brings down house
## Superb comedy at Cal 
### Susie Kaplan 
Comedian Steve Martin brought his special
brand of humor to U.C. Berkeley's Zellerbach Au
ditorium last week-end. Judging by the reaction of
the sold-out house, Martin has struck upon the
right formula.
It is almost impossible to characterize Martin's
style; he is cynical, sarcastic, absurd and topical
all at once. But most importantly, he is funny
; consistently throughout his entire 90-minute act.
From his opening routine through his second
encore, Martin displayed an uncanny ability to
captivate his huge audience. Zellerbach is
roughly the size of Stanford's Memorial Au
ditorium, yet by all accounts, he was audible in
[ the second balcony and nary a line was lost amidst
laughter. For a comedian who is used to working
in relatively small clubs, Martin's control of this

audience was impressive.
Martin continues to use much of the material
from his original routine (which dates back over
two years), but even those audience members who
had seen him before laughed heartily at the re
peated jokes. Personally, I think that seeing some
one try to suck a piano through a straw is funny
the first time, but the second time around it is
pretty easy to guess the outcome.
However, most of the material was fresh, and it
was skillfully blended into the old routine in de
ference to Martin's returnees. His subjects ranged
from Jackie Onassis to the l-'renph language
("Those French have a different word for every
thing. . .1 think they do it on purpose."), his style
ran the gamut from absurd slapstick to cynical
putdowns. But everything he did was executed
with perfection and the audience hardly had time
to catch its breath between laughs.
