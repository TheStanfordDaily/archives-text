U .S. mayors look to Carter for city aid
Chicago — The deterioration of the nation's
troubled central cities can be stopped dead if Jimmy
Carter puts the full weight of Washington belli nd a
new urban strategy, big city mayors said yesterday.
Keys to such an effort, which the mayors support,
would be creation of an Urban Development Bank
and federal reorganization to reduce the paperwork
that now ensnarescitv halls.More money is another
key.
Representatives ot President-elect Jimmy Carter
and Vice President-elect Walter Mondale said yes
terday the mayors' shopping list was in line with
much of Carter's thinking.
The U.S. Conference of Mayors yesterday con
cluded a two-day brainstorming session here on
priorities to present Congress and Carter. Confer
ence officials said they are seeking a meeting with
Carter to discuss their urban plan.
Several mayors yesterday attacked what Mayor
Coleman Young of Detroit called "the doughnut
syndrome."
"That's where the central city is the hole and
everything around us is sugary and nice," said
Young. He called for a reordering of federal muscle
"designed to make the cities as healthy and attrac
tive as the suburbs."
Conference president Kenneth Gibson stead
fastly refused to put a price tag on the urban plan,
but said it was "fair to say we're talking about a lot
ot money."
Spain's Carlos offers reform
Madrid, Spain — One year since death ended
Francisco Franco's long dictatorship. Spain has
more than .')()() political parties, consumer groups,
women's lib and a government committed to free
elections. But towering obstacles still stand on the
road to democracy.
('hief among these are Gen. Franco's solidly en
trenched political heirs, disunity in the opposition,
labor unrest and continuing political violence.
The key dispute is over government recognition
of the Communist party, illegal since Franco ban
ned it at the end of the Spanish civil war in 1939.
The moderate left, principally the Socialists, is de
bating whether to boycott elections if the Com
munists are not allowed to participate.
King Juan Carlos, who took over when Franco
died Nov. 20. 1975, has legalized demonstrations,
treed political prisoners and even brought a few of
franco's police to trial for torture. The word "dic
tatorship" has appeared in the Spanish press for the
first time in four decades.
But the first year has also brought Spain an
eight-fold increase in strikes, devaluation of its
peseta and political violence.
Federal employes ponder Carter
Washington — Within the federal bureaucracy

there .irt' only lew pockets ul tear and trepidation
over the coming ot Jimmy Carter mid his pledge to
reorganize 17(H) departments and agencies into
200.
Most ot the 2200 men and women in government
posts listed in the political "plum book" are recon
ciled to their imminent departure.
A few want to stay on. Some candidly admit they
can't find anytlii ng as good or better elsewhere and
are hoping Carter won t lire them.
By law, theirs are the only jobs among the 4.5
million on the federal payroll in immediate
jeopardy upon the changing of the guard. Virtually
all others are projected by Civil Service, postal or
military employment standards outside the politi
cal arena.
For the first time in history, virtually all of the
major government employe unions endorsed a
presidential candidate — Jimmy Carter.
"The American labor movement played a great
part in the Carter victory and for the first time we
were a part of the American labor movement in a
national election," said Kenneth Blaylock, presi
dent of the American Federation of Government
Employes.
"I'm pleased and gratified." said Vincent Con
uery, head of the National Treasury Employes Un
ion. "We look forward to fairer treatment of federal
employes under the Carter administration."
That "fairer treatment" includes Carter's promise
not to hold down cost-of-living raises for federal
workers, as Ford and Nixon tried to do, unless simi
lar sacrifices are made by other Americans.
Talks on Rhodesia may break down
Geneva, Switzerland — British chairman Ivor
Richard flew home to London late yesterday to con
sult on how to prevent stalemated talks on the fu
ture of Rhodesia from collapsing into a guerrilla
war solution.
Richard told a reporter at the airport that he was
"not at all despondent." But the conference ap
peared locked in a hardening black-white confron
tation 11 days after its formal opening.
A spokesman said Richard would return today to
try to set up another working session with black
and white delegations.
"Obviously, we have reached a stage where there
are difficulties and it would be absurd to hide
them," the spokesman said. On the other hand, he
said, "we believe some useful progress has been
made."
Richard met separately over the weekend with
leaders of the five delegations. But he failed to win
support for a proposed March 1, 1978, deadline on
achieving black majority rule in the rebel British
colony.
Hospital undergoes murder probe
Ventura — Charges of murder in at least 1.1
deaths at Camarillo State 1 lospital may result from a
year-long county investigation that went ot the
Grand Jury yesterday, the prosecutor said in open

ing arguments.
Deputy Ventura County Dist. Atty. William
Maxwell told grand jurors during an extraordinary
open jury session that 13 of 112 deaths investigated
during a year-long probe of Camarillo "could po
tentially warrant indictments" on charges of mur
der and medical mistreatment.
Low flu shot turnout seen in state
Sacramento — State health officials say the turn
out for swine flu shots in California has been "way
below" expectations.
Bob Nance, a spokesman for the state Department
of Health, said yesterday that only about a million
persons had received either swine flu immuniza
tions or a bivalent vaccination against both swine
and A-Victoria flu.
"By this time we hoped to have several million"
persons vaccinated, said Nance, who blamed the
low turnout on the fact that a few elderly persons
died in Pennsylvania after receiving swine flu
shots.
No link was established between the shots and
the deaths. Nancy said that 2000 Californians were
killed by A-Victoria flu last year. Most of the deaths
occurred among the elderly and chronically ill.
Six arrested in S.F. drug raid
San Francisco — Five men and a 15-year-old girl
were arrested yesterday evening in what police cal
led "one of the larger drug busts in recent years."
Inspector Marvin Dean said more than $100,000
worth of LSD tablets, cocaine, hash oil and tai sticks
— a potent form of marijuana — were confiscated at
a private home along with equipment to manufac
ture LSD.
"This should put a dent in the sale and use of LSD
for a while at least." he said. "This is one of the
larger drug busts in recent years."
Gandhi denies Indian dictatorship
New Delhi. India — Prime Minister Indira Gan
dhi denied yesterday that she has established a
dictatorship in India and defended a constitutional
amendment giving her government sweeping
powers.
Gandhi spoke to the upper house of Parliament
during debate on the amendment, which oppo
nents claim will make India a "constitutional dic
tatorshi p."
"The word dictatorship has been frequently ban
died about since more than a year before the
emergency, especially by the people who them
selves have shown dictatorial tendencies over the
years." Gandhi said. "Not only our system but our
methods of working leave little room for au
thoritarianism."
