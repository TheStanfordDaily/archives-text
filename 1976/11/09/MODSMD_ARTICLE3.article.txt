# Many blind to Honor Code?
## 
### Emiy Sachar 
Many students and faculty here are ignorant of the con
tents of the Honor Code, according to a survey adminis
tered by sociology graduate student Sally Cole.
The study also shows that the level of cheating in 1976
is not alarmingly high, nor is it different from trends
shown by the 1961 Columbia University Bureau of
Applied Social Research's survey of national cheating.
Cole's survey, which will be used to evaluate the honor
code's present status, shows that even though individual
student honesty is at a "fairly high level," students are
now more aware of the cheating that does exist but are less
willing to report offenders than they were in 1961.
When asked about their own behavior, 31 per cent un
dergraduate and 15 percent of graduate students admitted
cheating at least once during an exam. Only one per cent
reported cheating frequently.
Changes possible
"We plan to have open meetings where people can
comment and we will make recommendations (for possi
ble Honor Code changes). The survey is only prelimi
nary." said Emeritus Philosophy Prof. Philip Rhinelander.
head of the Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC).
In her report to the SCLC, Cole stated that, "Students are
not knowledgeable about the contents of the Honor Code,
nor is the majority highly committed to it.
"They similarly perceive their fellow students and fa
culty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not actually
indifferent or opposed to it."
Former Dean of Students Donald Winbigler is preparing
a history of the Honor Code, according to Rhinelander.
Persons would thus be able to know the origins of the Code
and see that the Code was initiated by students and not
faculty, he said.
The report will be ready within the next few weeks.
Copies of the actual survey questionnaires used by stu
dents and faculty may be obtained in the office of Jim

Siena, legal adviser to the president.
In the Cole survey, 70 per cent of the undergraduates
and 42 percent of the graduates admitted at least one act of
cheating on 17 different questions. Included in these were
"padding" bibliographies, copying sentences without
footnoting or copying an answer rather than doing work
independently.
While approximately three-fourths of the 1961 under
graduates agreed strongly that "under no circumstances is
cheating justified" and "students are morally obliged not
to cheat." only about half felt the same way this year (46
per cent and 52 per cent respectively).
Cheating was most likely to occur in courses which
were introductory, had more than 30 students enrolled
and had short-answer examinations, instead of open book,
essay, or take-home teâ€žts.
Few tattle-tales
The fact that students see cheating occur during proc
tored tests may help explain the lack of widespread sup
port for this method of combating academic dishonesty.
"The reporting end of the Code must be firmed up also,"
Cole said. "The fact that students rarely report observed
cheaters puts the code in a bad position. Part of the reason
for this lack of reporting may be due to ignorance."
Between September 1975 and May 1976, 16 students
were charged with Honor ("ode violations at the univer
sity.
Using questions identical with those in the 1961 study,
the 1976 survey also found almost no change in what
undergraduates view as the most important purpose of
education here; to provide a basic, general education and
appreciation of ideas.
Cole expects that publication of the survey results and
ensuing debates will result in heightened awareness of the
code.
"My guess is that modest changes will be made," Cole
said.
