# Lyman to announce cost cutting plan
## 
### Andy Brown 
President Richard Lyman of Stan
ford and Chancellor Albert Bowker of
the University of California-Berkeley
plan to announce today a cooperative
program between the two university
libraries in order to curb rapidly rising
library costs.
The initial funding of the program,
which will join two of the nation's 10
largest libraries, will be provided by
two grants totaling $580,000 from the
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, both
of New York.
The exchange will provide direct
borrowing privileges for faculty,
graduate students and academic per
sonnel at both institutions.
David Weber, library director here,
said he expects some preliminary pha
ses of the program to begin in five or
six weeks. But two years of "exceed
ingly intense effort" between library
and faculty subject specialists will be
needed to adjust acquisition policies

in a coordinated fashion, he explained.
"Gaining faculty confidence is es
sential." said Weber. "Both remote ac
cess via telephone and direct access to
the library shelves are integral parts of
the program."
Later this month Weber said he in
tends to meet with representatives
from the Hoover Institution, as well as
from the law. business and medical
school libraries to discuss implementa
tion of the program.
"No single research library can ac
quire all the books it requires to keep
up with the complex needs of graduate
students and faculty it must serve."
noted Weber.
Stanford and Berkeley have 8.7 mill
ion books in their combined collec
tions. which double in sizeabout every
1 fi years. However, present annual cost
increases of between 15 and 20 per
cent on books and journals, and pro
jected increases of 30 per cent for the
rest of this decade have jeopardized
both collections.
