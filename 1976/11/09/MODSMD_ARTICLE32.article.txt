the Cit\ of Mahagonny com

with hoodlums and whores

theatre.
Mahniionny is difficult to
appret i.ite. not because the
translation is faulty or the
narrative is confusing; but
because so much of the
aesthetic experience depends
upon Weill's music.
"Alabama Moon" (recorded
by The Doors in H)H7) and
"Benares" .ire the two best

known pieces in the opera.
But even an extensive know
ledge of Weill's music is not
enough. The reader must be
prepared to be assaulted by
the theme and alienated by
the structure of the opera:
. . . the penniless man
Is the worst kind of crimi
nal.
Beyond both pity mid par
don.
In the broadest sense the
opera follows the rise and fall
of an earthly paradise.
Muhtigonnv takes place on
some American coast far from
Alabama, somewhere bet

Alaska but near I'ensacola. at
<i time when automobiles and
a goltl rush coexist. A boom

Slowlv. tlu? t ity entraps each

of the characters.
One eats himself to death.
Another is electrocuted for a
drinking debt. The city of
pleasure swells like a bloated
lamb. "Neither God nor na
ture can destroy or reform
Mahagonny. Only its own in
terned contradictions can do
that." Brecht attempts to in
struct the reader on the nature
of capitalism; his class
conscious strategy as well as
his dramatic abilities alter
nately disappoint and over
whelm the reader.
Brecht considered himself
an enemy of conventional
emotionalism in the theatre.
His theory or alienation, or
Verfremdung, asserts that it is
necessary to prevent the au
dience from losing itself in
the illusion of drama. The
spectator must become an ob
server. capable of reason. Any
play that depends too much
on the sympathy of the audi
ence is unrealistic, and more
important I v. u nsuccessfu 1.
Mahagonny is an opera that
refuses to charm us and a play
that refuses to ask for our
sympathy. It slashes its way
through moral and ideologi

cal problems, using the
exuberance of the music hall
and the cheap cabaret to
praise or blame. Auden's
translation is articulate; but it
is more suited for the singing
voice than for the library or
the private reader.
Auden's knowledge of
German, and Brecht in par
ticuhir. was extensive; and
his own plays closely parallel
the theories and techniques of
the German stage. Neverthe

less, the poetry is often dis
tracting and the rhetoric flat.
He has taken some liberties
with the text, hut ultimately
preserves the flavor and vir
tuosity of the original.
Why. though, did lie need
(i Ylahugonny?
Because this ivorld is u
foul one
With neither charity
Nor peace nor concord.
Because there's nothing
To build any trust upon.
