Not that we could not have
known how good he was, long
before now. Most poets guessed.
The critics gambled, nervously,
and won. Time crowned him with
its tawdry laurel, and he kept on
working. 15 volumes, 30 years.
And we took him for granted.
Tate introduced him to the
world. He sat at John Crowe Ran
dom's knee. Eliot gave him his
blessing. Williams watched from
the wings and applauded. Frost
was "his friend in the art." His
peers, such as they were, fell for
ward in adultation, or backward in
terror at his first onslaught across
the field.
He read all of the books. And he
keeps on reading them, appa
rently with an eye to rewriting
them. Past Rimbaud, Rilke, Val
ery, he muscled his way through
the lands of Racine and Villon,
back to the no-man's-land of Sap
pho, and even Homer, annexing
them one by one to his vast domin
ions. (Quibble as you will, all of
these have his flag planted in
them, as surely as Peking remains
the property of Pound.)
But who could read or "like" the
poems themselves? Knotted, clot
ted, Catholic, Puritanical, violent,
pacifist poems. Full of history,
fed up with history, formal, fed up
with formalities, glutted, stub-

born, bloody, bathetic: the Ameri
can Poet, "always, always
agonized."
A mess of contradictions that
ought to have floundered com
pletely, ought to have clammed
up, years ago. Ought to have gone
off his rocker, goes off and not
come back, gone off to Ethiopia
and become a gun runner, given
up, sold out, folded, flushing him
self down the successpool once
and for all. Who can come back
from the land of the cover of Time?
He is still writing. And still re
writing, which for Lowell is no
less important. He has never
committed a minor poem. There
are plenty of majors that fail, that
keep on failing, coming unravel
led. But nothing is wasted. To

day's failures â€”the ones that look
pathetic in among the grand suc
cesses of the Selected Poems
may well turn out to be his greatest
of all when we have the Collected,
the Complete, the Red-Letter
Lowell in our hands.
Nothing is finished, not even
the poet. All is in flux, and we
ought to be glad. We ought to
applaud this flux, this desperate
"lurch/ F'or forms to harness
Heraclitus' stream!"
In his youth he attached himself
to the Createst Living Masters.
Now he is one. He absorbed the
tradition. Now he inches it for
ward, mile after mile. If you think
that the crux of the poetry that
matters lies elsewhere, you are the
one who ought to read this book.
