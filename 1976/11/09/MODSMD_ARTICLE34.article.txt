# Springboard for young writers
## Two magazines publish area literature

M writers in America
begin their careers
by publishing in small
magazines. In hundreds of
tiny publications scattered
around the country writers
present their works to audi
ences which may vary from a
few dozen to a few thousand.
Some of these magazines
disappear after a few issues. A
few have lasted for decades.
But through their collective
influence the majority of
young American writers
make their reputations and
find their readership.
Until the last few years it
was always assumed that as
the writers matured their ta
lents and earned sizeable
reputations, that they would
move on to larger markets.
They would begin publishing
their work in national
magazines and collecting it in
volumes published by the es
tablished New York or Boston
presses. This line of de
velopment no longer holds
true.
As financial pressures be
come greater for the big na
tional magazines and presses,
they are increasingly con
cerned with profits. Since
literary quality has never
been a guarantee for sales,
they have often turned their
backs on serious writing and
pursued the fashionable.

Top national magazines
like Esquire or Atlantic
Monthly have reduced the
amount of fiction and poetry
they publish drastically dur
ing the past few years. Other
magazines have stopped
printing it entirely. Only the
New Yorker, that miraculous
exception to everything
American, has continued
supporting serious writing as
strongly as ever.
Absolutely awful
There are several dozen
small magazines edited in the
Bay Area. Most of them are
absolutely awful. Edited by
groups of friends whose chief
interests are seeing each
others' work in print, these
publications have little ap
peal to an outsider. The work
they publish is not merely un
impressive; it is also insuffer
ably dull.
There is certainly nothing
wrong with publishing minor
writing. After all. in the long
run, almost all writing is
minor (the most minor and
ephemeral being book re
views). But there is little ex
cuse to publish work on a
regular basis that is boring.
A few local magazines,
however, stand out among
this mediocre crowd. They
maintain a standard of excel
lence in writing from issue to
issue and publish a diverse
and engaging body of work.
While they have a distinctly

local flavor, they are
magazines which deserve
and receive national atten
tion. No one who is seriously
interested in Bay Area writ
ing can afford to ignore them.
Two of the best local
magazines are Hyperion and
Invisible City. Each has a dif
ferent format and aim. The
work published in each one
often appeals to a different
sort of sensibility, but within
the limitations of these tastes
the editing is consistently
good. Separately they reveal
diversity of northern Califor
nian literary interests. Collec
tively they testify to the range
and depth of these interests.
Invisible City
Invisible City is a striking
magazine. Published in an
enormous tabloid format
(roughly the size of an un
folded copy of a daily news
paper), this magazine liter
ally sprawls over the reader. It
prints a huge amount of mate
rial with three columns of
writing on each oversize
page.
Invisible City is probably
the closest thing the Bay Area
has to a European literary
magazine. The contents of
each issue include poetry and
politics both with a markedly
continental flavor. The
editors as well as many of the
contributors are Italian/
Americans, and their in
terests reflect their cultural

and intellectual heritage.
The politics are naturally
Marxist, and the poetics a
blend of surrealism and the
Beats. Surprisingly enough
these elements mix convinc
ingly making Invisible City
an intellectually challenging
magazine from first to last.
This ideological integrity
makes Invisible City almost
unique among local
magazines where so many
editors avoid extended dis
cussions on issues of any
depth.
Invisible City is also dedi
cated to bringing the best of
European avant-garde writ
ing to the attention of an
American audience. Each
issue contains a dozen or
more translations from Italian
or other European literatures.
For the most part they print
work which has never ap
peared before in English (in
stead of re-translating the
same few writers). San Fran
cisco is a very European city
deeply influenced bv its Ita
lian citizens. There could not
be a more characteristic
magazine than Invisible City
to represent it.
Hyperion
Hyperion, a small
magazine edited in Berkeley,
is also very interested in
translation. Their latest issue,
which runs over 200 pages, is
made up completely of trans
lations. Ranging from classi

cal Greek and Latin poetry to
contemporary Russian and
Bengali this issue of Hyper
ion surveys almost every lit
erature in between.
Paul Foreman, the editor of
Hyperion, conceived of this
quadruple issue as a memo
rial to the Berkeley poet and
translator, Elrov Bundy. It
would be hard to imagine a
more impressive testimonial
to Bundy's interest in transla
tion. This issue brings to
gether a small anthology of
world poetry.
Some of the translations are
superb. Most are very good. A
few are rather flat and deriva
tive. But the overall effect of
the issue is powerful. It is an
unqualified joy to see so
much unfamiliar poetry
translated into English. Many
of the poems appeared in this
issue for the first time in En
glish. Hyperion ac
complishes what so few other
local magazines have. It edu
cates and broadens the sen
sibilities of its readers.
Both Hyperion and Invisi
ble City are available at
bookstores in Palo Alto and
around the Bay Area. While
they don't present the full
range of local writing, they
show certain aspects of it at
its best. Both of them are not
only magazines to watch but
to buy.

tion. No one who is seriously
interested in Bay Area writ
ing can afford to ignore them.
Two of the best local
magazines are Hyperion and
Invisible City. Each has a dif
ferent format and aim. The
work published in each one
often appeals to a different
sort of sensibility, but within
the limitations of these tastes
the editing is consistently
good. Separately they reveal
diversity of northern Califor
nian literary interests. Collec
tively they testify to the range
and depth of these interests.
Invisible City
Invisible City is a striking
magazine. Published in an
enormous tabloid format
(roughly the size of an un
folded copy of a daily news
paper), this magazine liter
ally sprawls over the reader. It
prints a huge amount of mate
rial with three columns of
writing on each oversize
page.
Invisible City is probably
the closest thing the Bay Area
has to a European literary
magazine. The contents of
each issue include poetry and
politics both with a markedly
continental flavor. The
editors as well as many of the
contributors are Italian/
Americans, and their in
terests reflect their cultural

and intellectual heritage.
The politics are naturally
Marxist, and the poetics a
blend of surrealism and the
Beats. Surprisingly enough
these elements mix convinc
ingly making Invisible City
an intellectually challenging
magazine from first to last.
This ideological integrity
makes Invisible City almost
unique among local
magazines where so many
editors avoid extended dis
cussions on issues of any
depth.
Invisible City is also dedi
cated to bringing the best of
European avant-garde writ
ing to the attention of an
American audience. Each
issue contains a dozen or
more translations from Italian
or other European literatures.
For the most part they print
work which has never ap
peared before in English (in
stead of re-translating the
same few writers). San Fran
cisco is a very European city
deeply influenced bv its Ita
lian citizens. There could not
be a more characteristic
magazine than Invisible City
to represent it.
Hyperion
Hyperion, a small
magazine edited in Berkeley,
is also very interested in
translation. Their latest issue,
which runs over 200 pages, is
made up completely of trans
lations. Ranging from classi

cal Greek and Latin poetry to
contemporary Russian and
Bengali this issue of Hyper
ion surveys almost every lit
erature in between.
Paul Foreman, the editor of
Hyperion, conceived of this
quadruple issue as a memo
rial to the Berkeley poet and
translator, Elrov Bundy. It
would be hard to imagine a
more impressive testimonial
to Bundy's interest in transla
tion. This issue brings to
gether a small anthology of
world poetry.
Some of the translations are
superb. Most are very good. A
few are rather flat and deriva
tive. But the overall effect of
the issue is powerful. It is an
unqualified joy to see so
much unfamiliar poetry
translated into English. Many
of the poems appeared in this
issue for the first time in En
glish. Hyperion ac
complishes what so few other
local magazines have. It edu
cates and broadens the sen
sibilities of its readers.
Both Hyperion and Invisi
ble City are available at
bookstores in Palo Alto and
around the Bay Area. While
they don't present the full
range of local writing, they
show certain aspects of it at
its best. Both of them are not
only magazines to watch but
to buy.
ost contemporary
M writers in America
begin their careers
by publishing in small
magazines. In hundreds of
tiny publications scattered
around the country writers
present their works to audi
ences which may vary from a
few dozen to a few thousand.
Some of these magazines
disappear after a few issues. A
few have lasted for decades.
But through their collective
influence the majority of
young American writers
make their reputations and
find their readership.
Until the last few years it
was always assumed that as
the writers matured their ta
lents and earned sizeable
reputations, that they would
move on to larger markets.
They would begin publishing
their work in national
magazines and collecting it in
volumes published by the es
tablished New York or Boston
presses. This line of de
velopment no longer holds
true.
As financial pressures be
come greater for the big na
tional magazines and presses,
they are increasingly con
cerned with profits. Since
literary quality has never
been a guarantee for sales,
they have often turned their
backs on serious writing and
pursued the fashionable.

Top national magazines
like Esquire or Atlantic
Monthly have reduced the
amount of fiction and poetry
they publish drastically dur
ing the past few years. Other
magazines have stopped
printing it entirely. Only the
New Yorker, that miraculous
exception to everything
American, has continued
supporting serious writing as
strongly as ever.
Absolutely awful
There are several dozen
small magazines edited in the
Bay Area. Most of them are
absolutely awful. Edited by
groups of friends whose chief
interests are seeing each
others' work in print, these
publications have little ap
peal to an outsider. The work
they publish is not merely un
impressive; it is also insuffer
ably dull.
There is certainly nothing
wrong with publishing minor
writing. After all. in the long
run, almost all writing is
minor (the most minor and
ephemeral being book re
views). But there is little ex
cuse to publish work on a
regular basis that is boring.
A few local magazines,
however, stand out among
this mediocre crowd. They
maintain a standard of excel
lence in writing from issue to
issue and publish a diverse
and engaging body of work.
While they have a distinctly

local flavor, they are
magazines which deserve

erature in between.
Paul Foreman, the editor of
Hyperion, conceived of this
quadruple issue as a memo
rial to the Berkeley poet and
translator, Elrov Bundy. It
would be hard to imagine a
more impressive testimonial
to Bundy's interest in transla
tion. This issue brings to
gether a small anthology of
world poetry.
Some of the translations are
superb. Most are very good. A
few are rather flat and deriva
tive. But the overall effect of
the issue is powerful. It is an
unqualified joy to see so
much unfamiliar poetry
translated into English. Many
of the poems appeared in this
issue for the first time in En
glish. Hyperion ac
complishes what so few other
local magazines have. It edu
cates and broadens the sen
sibilities of its readers.
Both Hyperion and Invisi
ble City are available at
bookstores in Palo Alto and
around the Bay Area. While
they don't present the full
range of local writing, they
show certain aspects of it at
its best. Both of them are not
only magazines to watch but
to buy.
ost contemporary
M writers in America
begin their careers
by publishing in small
magazines. In hundreds of
tiny publications scattered
around the country writers
present their works to audi
ences which may vary from a
few dozen to a few thousand.
Some of these magazines
disappear after a few issues. A
few have lasted for decades.
But through their collective
influence the majority of
young American writers
make their reputations and
find their readership.
Until the last few years it
was always assumed that as
the writers matured their ta
lents and earned sizeable
reputations, that they would
move on to larger markets.
They would begin publishing
their work in national
magazines and collecting it in
volumes published by the es
tablished New York or Boston
presses. This line of de
velopment no longer holds
true.
As financial pressures be
come greater for the big na
tional magazines and presses,
they are increasingly con
cerned with profits. Since
literary quality has never
been a guarantee for sales,
they have often turned their
backs on serious writing and
pursued the fashionable.

Top national magazines
like Esquire or Atlantic
Monthly have reduced the
amount of fiction and poetry
they publish drastically dur
ing the past few years. Other
magazines have stopped
printing it entirely. Only the
New Yorker, that miraculous
exception to everything
American, has continued
supporting serious writing as
strongly as ever.
Absolutely awful
There are several dozen
small magazines edited in the
Bay Area. Most of them are
absolutely awful. Edited by
groups of friends whose chief
interests are seeing each
others' work in print, these
publications have little ap
peal to an outsider. The work
they publish is not merely un
impressive; it is also insuffer
ably dull.
There is certainly nothing
wrong with publishing minor
writing. After all. in the long
run, almost all writing is
minor (the most minor and
ephemeral being book re
views). But there is little ex
cuse to publish work on a
regular basis that is boring.
A few local magazines,
however, stand out among
this mediocre crowd. They
maintain a standard of excel
lence in writing from issue to
issue and publish a diverse
and engaging body of work.
While they have a distinctly

local flavor, they are
magazines which deserve
and receive national atten
tion. No one who is seriously
interested in Bay Area writ
ing can afford to ignore them.
Two of the best local
magazines are Hyperion and
Invisible City. Each has a dif
ferent format and aim. The
work published in each one
often appeals to a different
sort of sensibility, but within
the limitations of these tastes
the editing is consistently
good. Separately they reveal
diversity of northern Califor
nian literary interests. Collec
tively they testify to the range
and depth of these interests.
Invisible City
Invisible City is a striking
magazine. Published in an
enormous tabloid format
(roughly the size of an un
folded copy of a daily news
paper), this magazine liter
ally sprawls over the reader. It
prints a huge amount of mate
rial with three columns of
writing on each oversize
page.
Invisible City is probably
the closest thing the Bay Area
has to a European literary
magazine. The contents of
each issue include poetry and
politics both with a markedly
continental flavor. The
editors as well as many of the
contributors are Italian/
Americans, and their in
terests reflect their cultural

and intellectual heritage.
The politics are naturally
Marxist, and the poetics a
blend of surrealism and the
Beats. Surprisingly enough
these elements mix convinc
ingly making Invisible City
an intellectually challenging
magazine from first to last.
This ideological integrity
makes Invisible City almost
unique among local
magazines where so many
editors avoid extended dis
cussions on issues of any
depth.
Invisible City is also dedi
cated to bringing the best of
European avant-garde writ
ing to the attention of an
American audience. Each
issue contains a dozen or
more translations from Italian
or other European literatures.
For the most part they print
work which has never ap
peared before in English (in
stead of re-translating the
same few writers). San Fran
cisco is a very European city
deeply influenced bv its Ita
lian citizens. There could not
be a more characteristic
magazine than Invisible City
to represent it.
Hyperion
Hyperion, a small
magazine edited in Berkeley,
is also very interested in
translation. Their latest issue,
which runs over 200 pages, is
made up completely of trans
lations. Ranging from classi

cal Greek and Latin poetry to
contemporary Russian and
Bengali this issue of Hyper
ion surveys almost every lit
erature in between.
