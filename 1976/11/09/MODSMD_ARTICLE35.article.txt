The Great Victorian Collection
A novel by Brian Moore. Ballantine, $1.75

Brian Moore's The Great
Victorian Collection is one of
the most interesting short
novels published in the last
year. Moore is a British
novelist who has had a dis
tinguished career during the
last ten years scoring both
critical and popular succes
ses with books like Catholics
and The Luck of GingerCo//y.
Graham Greene has called him
"my favorite living novelist."
This latest book should do
much to justify that compli

ment.
The plot of The Great Vic
torian Collection is very sim
ple. A young Ganadian his
tory professor on his way to
Big Sur checks into a motel in
Garmel. He goes to bed and
dreams he is in London. In his
dream he begins following a
man dressed in old-fashioned
clothes. In following the man
he unexpectedly stumbles
into his own Galifornia motel
room, but looking out the
room window he discovers a

huge Victorian exhibit in an
empty lot next to the motel.
He awakes just after dawn
that morning and. looking out
the window, discovers that
the exhibit is indeed really
there.
These events happen in the
first few pages of the novel.
The remainder of the book
concerns Professor Maloney's
attempt to come to terms with
this "secular miracle." Jour
nalists and academics sus
pect him of fraud, the police
suspect theft. A religious
fanatic accuses him of heresy.
Maloney is guilty of none of
these crimes. Indeed he is not
sure what he is guilty of or
responsible for. He knows
that the collection is genuine
and that he has dreamed it
into reality. How this miracle
happened is as much a mys
tery to him as to the public.
Surrounded by journalists,
psychologists, businessmen,
art experts and sightseers.
Maloney tries to discover his
relationship to the collection.
Each night he dreams obses
sively about it and knows that
these dreams are necessary to
perpetuate its existence.
These dreams disturb him.
Furthermore he is fixated on

the notion of dreaming
another fantasy into existence
so that he can justify his pow
ers both to the world and to
himself.
The Great Victorian Collec
tion continues Moore's com
mitment to the Catholic wing
of the modern British novel.
In this tradition Moore fol
lows the examples of Evelyn
Waugh, Graham Greene and
non-Catholics like Aldous
Huxley. He writes short, en
tertaining novels in popular
genres (like satire, spy stories
or science-fiction) with seri
ous intellectual themes. As in
the work of his contemporary.
Anthony Burgess. Moore
specializes in writing
theological investigations
disguised as popular enter
tainments.
Moore resembles Burgess
in another respect. Both of
them write novels that one
feels could easily have been
small masterpieces. They
have the sympathy, the range
and the intellectual depth of.
great novelists. But midway
in every book something goes
wrong. One is never sure
exactly what has gone wrong.
The style loosens. The satire
becomes too transparent or

heavy-handed. Events take
too easy a turn towards a re
solution. And in the end the
reader is left not with a major
novel but another superior
entertainment.
On one level the novel is
obviously an allegory about
the creative act. Nlaloney's
"secular miracle" is bringing
a dream to actuality just as an
artist creates a real thing in a
work of art. The lack of un
derstanding the real world
displays about this creation is
the core of the novel. And
perhaps Maloney's inability
to live harmoniously with
both the world and his dream
is Moore's warning about the
creative life.
Yet however much The
Great Victorian Collection
invites an allegorical reading,
it gains very little from such
an approach. The novel un
folds like some marvellous
fairy tale heard in childhood.
One is aware in a vague sense
of the disturbing truths be
neath the events, but it is the
story itself that captures the
imagination.
Brian Moore is one of the
most talented novelists writ
ing today. Anyone who loves
to read owes it to himself to

The Great Victorian Collection
A novel by Brian Moore. Ballantine, $1.75

Brian Moore's The Great
Victorian Collection is one of
the most interesting short
novels published in the last
year. Moore is a British
novelist who has had a dis
tinguished career during the
last ten years scoring both
critical and popular succes
ses with books like Catholics
and The Luck of GingerCo//y.
Graham Greene has called him
"my favorite living novelist."
This latest book should do
much to justify that compli

ment.
The plot of The Great Vic
torian Collection is very sim
ple. A young Ganadian his
tory professor on his way to
Big Sur checks into a motel in
Garmel. He goes to bed and
dreams he is in London. In his
dream he begins following a
man dressed in old-fashioned
clothes. In following the man
he unexpectedly stumbles
into his own Galifornia motel
room, but looking out the
room window he discovers a

huge Victorian exhibit in an
empty lot next to the motel.
He awakes just after dawn
that morning and. looking out
the window, discovers that
the exhibit is indeed really
there.
These events happen in the
first few pages of the novel.
The remainder of the book
concerns Professor Maloney's
attempt to come to terms with
this "secular miracle." Jour
nalists and academics sus
pect him of fraud, the police
suspect theft. A religious
fanatic accuses him of heresy.
Maloney is guilty of none of
these crimes. Indeed he is not
sure what he is guilty of or
responsible for. He knows
that the collection is genuine
and that he has dreamed it
into reality. How this miracle
happened is as much a mys
tery to him as to the public.
Surrounded by journalists,
psychologists, businessmen,
art experts and sightseers.
Maloney tries to discover his
relationship to the collection.
Each night he dreams obses
sively about it and knows that
these dreams are necessary to
perpetuate its existence.
These dreams disturb him.
Furthermore he is fixated on

the notion of dreaming
