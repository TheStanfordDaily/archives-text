# Stenger's latest novel
## Spectator Bird: A bittersweet delving 
### Barry Brinker 
Wallace Stegner's latest
novel .The Spectator Bird, is a
short and bittersweet delving
into the life of one Joe Allston,
a "wisecracking fellow
traveler in the lives of other
people, and a tourist in his
own."
Allston is a retired literary
agent approaching seventy
who surveys his life in retros
pect and'finds much that is
painful and depressing. In
telling his own story, he
maintains a posture of de
tachment and unreality, say
ing at one point: "I sometimes
get the feeling my whole life
happened to somebody else."
Yet he returns obsessively to
the sad details of his life, as if
picking at a scab that has
never healed and never will.
All his wiseacre remarks
seem symptomatic of the same
problem; some are funny,
some are tired old chestnuts,
but taken together they com
prise his strategy for confront
ing (as he explains) .. The
way the word wags. . .The dif
ference between what we'd
like to be and what we're able
to be. How to respect myself
when I know I'm confused and
cowardly. How to respect a
world where nothing I believe
in is valued. How to live and
grow old inside a head I'm
contemptuous of, in a culture I
despise."
Yet the book does not end
up as a litany of self-pitying
meditations nor as a tiresome
rehash of Villon's definitive
backward glance of his own
life: "Je plains le temps de ma
jeunesse." It Joe Allston

whines about Walter Cron
kite's diction and interest
ingly enough Stanford stu
dents (for he and his wife have
retired to Portola Valley), he at
least has enough distance on
himself to knoiv that he is
whining and enough courage
to examine his own lifeas well
as life as a metaphysical issue.
The bulk of the book is de
voted to Allston reading out
loud to his wife a journal he
had kept years before on a trip
he and his wife had made to
Denmark, the birthplace of
Joe's mother, who had emig
rated to the , lited States as a
young girl. As it happens,
Allston and his wife had gone
to Denmark to recover from
the recent suicide of their only
son.
The recitation of the jour
nals is, in fact, only flashbacks
in disguise. In terms of stylis
tic craft, the effect is very
felicitous: There is really no
action in the present of the
novel — all that happens had
already occurred long ago.
The point being, of course,
that the reader, like Joe
Allston, merely observes it all
from afar.
The story line, however, has
coincidences so outlandish as
to recall some of the more im
plausible juxtapositions in
time and place of novels by
Charles Dickens. Item: Allston
and his wife, in their stay in
Denmark, happen to room
with a countess impoverished
to the poi nt of having to take in
boarders. The countess' father
happens to have been the lord
of the estate where Allston's
mother was born and raised.

But if this book has failings,
it also has arresting moments
of wisdom. Allston muses to
himself: "Take gratefully any
pleasantness the world pro
vides, but don't curse God
when they fail. Nobody in the
universe ever promised you
anything. Most things break,
including hearts. The lessons
of a life amount not to wisdom
but to tissue and callus." If.
after 70 years, one has learned
no lesson save this, that is still
much to have learned.
The journals recount the
strange and perplexing
period of his life when
Allston came to love the
Danish countess; his wife has
ahvays known about this
infidelity (of the spirit and not
of the flesh, as it turns out), but
they have never Brought It Out
Into The Open. Reading the
journals out loud is.in a sense,
an incantation whose magical
effect is — as nearly as possi
ble — to allow the two of them
to relive a part of their lives
together. It is a soul-searing
experience, at times, for both
of them, but an experience
they help each other through.
A stunning image, one that
informs the whole of the book,
occurs near the end of the
story, as Allston and his wife
walk with each other at night
after having relived a part of
their past: "The truest vision
of life I know is that bird in the
Venerable Bede that flutters
from the dark into a lighted
hall, and after a while flutters
out again into the dark. But
Ruth is right. It is something
— it can be everything — to

have found a fellow bird with
whom you can sit among the
rafters while the drinking and
boasting and reciting and
fighting go on below; a fellow
bird whom you can look after
and find bugs and seeds for;
one who will patch your
bruises and straighten your
ruffled feathers and mourn
over your hurts when you ac
cidentally fly into something
you can't handle."
Such a vision leads one in
evitably to conclude that both
Stegner and the Venerable
Bede read, at one time. Psalms
90:10, which provides a not
dissimilar vision: "The days of
our years are threescore years
and ten; and if by reason of
strength they be fourscore
years, yet is their strength
labour and sorrow; for it is
soon cut off. and we fly away."
