onald Barthelrne is
Dthe most successful
serious short story
writer in America. Out
of the hundreds of short story
writers who made their de
buts during the sixties. Barth
elme has been the only one
who captured and kept a na
tional audience. The darling
of the avant-garde as well as
the bulwark of the Nmv
Yorker, he has put himself
into that rare position of the
American artist who has not
only earned himself a fine
reputation but a fine income
as well.
It is not difficult to see how-
Bart hel me won such a loyal
following. His stories have a
personal tone that is im
mediately distinctive. With
the single-mindedness of
Kafka he writes about an
urban world gone mad in
some perfectly logical way.

Barthelme's characters
speak with an unassailable
authority as they comment on
some absurd preoccupation.
Quite often his stories resem
ble some superior form of sci
ence fiction. Almost always
they are a deft and humorous
type of fantasy.
Barthelme's personal blend
of the comic and the fantastic,
the absurd with the selt
consciously intellectual
make him closer to a Euro
pean writer than an Ameri
can. There is no trace of terse,
backwoods realism in his
writing. His cosmopolitan
tone reminds one of the most
entertaining members of the
European avant-garde like
Italo Calvino or Julio Cor
tazar. Like them he has disco
vered a way of writing that is
original without being dull.
Barthelme is a comic writer to
take seriously-

Theroux Metuphrastes
A book by Alexander Theroux. Godine Press, $1.50

Theroux Metuphrustes may
not be the most important
critical essay of the seventies,
but it will very likely be the
most entertaining. In a viv
aciously ornate way Theroux
makes an important point
about the current dearth of
fine writing in America. Sing
ling out the drab similarity ot
contemporary fiction, he
suggests as alternate mode for
American writers, namely the
amplified style.
For Theroux fine writing is
never stingy. Neither is it
self-consciously plain like

the clothes of a Puritan minis
ter. Above all it is not the
clipped, colorless prose of the
post-Hemingway school ot
Creative Writing. Instead
Theroux asks for rich style
not afraid to be complex or
demonstrative.
The style of the essay
proves Theroux's point more
eloquently than any argu
ments ever could. Although
Theroux has borrowed his
title from Dryden who used
"metaphrase" to mean trans
lating poetry into prose.

Theroux writes a flamboyant
tvpe of prose that leaves
much contemporary poetry
far behind.
Compared to Theroux,
most academic critics seem as
clumsy and predictable as a
high school student practic
ing scales would be next to a
Horowitz playing Scarlatti.
Horace asked that writers de
light as well as instruct. He
could have been talking about
this essav-

Eagle or Sun
A book by Octavio Paz, translated by
Eliot Weinberger.
New Directions, $2.95.

Octavio Paz is Mexico's
leading man of letters. A dis
tinguished poet, critic, trans
lator. and teacher. Paz has
won an international reader
ship few Latin American
writers have ever been able to
attract. Although he is com
pletely familiar and much in
fluenced by European, espe
cially French culture. Paz's
deepest impressions come
from his native country.
Fugle or Sun was a land
in.irk book in Paz's develop
ment. In this series of prose
poems he let his imagination
explore the changing rela
tionships between himself

Guide to Inexpensive Wines
A book by Alexis Bespaloff. Pocket Books, $1.50

Along with reading fine
hooks there are few activities
in life more rewarding than
drinking excellent wine. But
unlike hooks it is not possible
to sample the quality of an
unknown wine hy stepping
inside an appropriate shop
and paging through the case
in question. Nor does the es-

and his country, his language
and the reality its tries to de
scribe. I.ike so much modern
poetry Eagle or Sun is about
the act of writing and the
metaphysical struggle it en
compasses.
Yet Paz confronts these
problems using the associa
tive faculties of his mind
rather than the logical ones.
Influenced by the French sur
realists. Paz explored the un
conscious not the conscious
mind in these poems. The re
sults are strikingly original
poems that evoke a mythic
Mexico not found on any
map.

sence of a particular wine
transmit very successfully in
a verbal description.
Most beginning wine lov
ers will want to purchase a
book like Alexis Bespaloffs
practical Guide to Inexpen
sive Wines. Although the
hook says nothing particu
larly exciting or original, it
would be an invaluable help
to a beginner. In a very
straight-forward and amus
ing manner Bespalotf discus
ses the various categories ot
wine and makes some sensi
ble recommendations tor in
expensive but excellent
purchases.
Of course one might quib
ble with some ot Bespaloffs
choices. Tastes differ, and
consequently one might dis
agree with his censure of cer
tain California wines as not
dry enough. Or one might feel
he has slighted or ignored a
favorite label. I, tor one. puz
zled at his ommission of
Famigliu Cribari from his list
of cheap. California red Jug
wines. But whatever the
quibbles this is certainly an
excellent introduction that
will provide the loyal reader
with nearly infinite reward.
Never forget the wisdom ot
the ancients: in vino verifns.

Saul Bellow, whose less-than-cordial relationship with crowds of strangers probably
wasn't smoothed over any when he visited Stanford last winter, published a new book on
the eve of his Nobel Prize award. Entitled To Jerusalem and Back, the work is not the
customary novel but a collection of social reportage inspired by Bellow's recent trip to
