iving in California
Lone has at times the
curious sensation
that nature
has taken the place of history.
In other parts of the country,
especially the East and South,
the evidence of earlier eras is
always at hand and gives the
impression of human history
stretching backwards. There
is a certain reassurance in this
continuity. But then part of
the excitement one senses
here might be just this odd
juxtaposition of transient
modernity with the immemo
rial landscape.
.An Eduring Heritage pre
sents a completely different
vision of the Peninsula. It is a
historical survey of signific
ant buildings in the area from
the 1850s on, comprising a
series of wonderful photo
graphs and architectural
drawings with commentary.
What emerges goes far
beyond idle curiosities about
antiquated buildings.
Imagine, if you will, the
year 1852. The population of
the whole Peninsula is about
150. Cattle wander over the
hillsides — some things don't
change — but no one cared
who owned any giv en hill in
that vastness. Deserting sol
diers set up a little burg at a

spot in the redwoods called
YVoodside. In the dreamy iso
lation of Portola Valley. Felix
Buelna. once mayor of San
Jose, sets up a saloon by a
roadside (he later lost it in a
memorable poker game). This
is the very building known to
many as Zot's (officially the
Alpine Beer Carden). Its
facade smiles out quite un
changed in a photo from
1906.
Perspective
This is the kind of perspec
tive one gains from this book
on many buildings hereab
outs whose age one had
noticed but whose inner story
had not been revealed. The
Woodside store is another
good example; also the many
neat houses in Pescadero,
created by nostalgic emigres
from Maine.
Many contrasts emerge.
There is the ocean side of the
Sierra Morena (yes. that's the
Coast Range) which remained
rather sleepy for lack of effec
tive transportation of goods
and produce north. Compare
Pescadero with one of the
bayside towns, which had the
requisite transportation, and
you will realize some striking
t hi ngs.
Contrast on the human
level also emerges. There is

the house of the swaggering
Isaac Graham, which once
perched out over the ocean
south of Pidgeon Point, a
landmark of sailors. There is
the Steele family, which
cautiously built up a whole
series of dairies and
alongside them radiant pros
perous houses.
Grandiose estates
Much later, there are the
grandiose estates, i often have
driven on Middlefield in
Atherton and wondered what
used to lay beyond those in
terminable brick walls and
ponderous gates. 1 couldn't

believe Linden Towers when
1 saw the illustration given in
this book: think of a three
story palace surmounted bv a
150 foot tower, built by
Flood, once the richest man
in California, this mansion is
said to have contained every
kind of wood known to man.
Of course, there is Stanford
too. The growth of a univer
sity among all these other de
velopments gives a whimsi
cal touch, just the improbabil
ity that one would never have
expected. Architecturally,
too, Stanford is an improba
ble place, and the book gives

an interesting insight into its
conception.
The Stone Age
One learns of the Great
Stone Age of Stanford history
— David Starr Jordan's sar
castic term for Mrs. Stanford's
grandiose projects, many of
which were insufficiently
reinforced and collapsed
(perhaps mercifully) in the '(Mi
earthquake. Ultimately, how
ever. all the quirks of these
earlier styles seem to me quite
winning and lovable. One
wonders if Tresidder or the
new Education School build
ing will excite as much
warmth and sympathy in fu
ture beholders.
An Enduring Herituge is an
admirable introduction to
these perspectives which
open out into broader views
of history. The text is a tactful
complement to the visual
materials and effectively di
rects one's attention to these
buildings both in their indi
vidual particularity and in
their broader context.
Here it makes, it seems to
me, an important point. His
tory is not merely the record
of the past, the enumeration
of the fragments ol the past
that wash up into the present.
It is a vantage point for
looking at the present itself.
Looking at these buildings
one also begins to see the
larger human framework:
looking around in a similar
way at the present enables us
to see ourselves from the van
tage point of the future. I
think this kind ot nostalgia for
the present is a valuable addi
tion to one's feelings.
