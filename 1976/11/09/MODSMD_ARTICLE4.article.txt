# Trustees to decide lake's fate
## 
### Mike Charlson 
The Board of Trustees is expected to
make a decision on the proposed clos
ing of Searsville Lake and the sur
rounding area at its regular monthly
meeting today at 8:30 a.m. The meet
ing. to be held in the Forum Room of
Meyer Library, is closed to the public.
The board will consider a proposal
to close Searsville Lake to public re
creational use and add it to the Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve facility.
According to a background report
supplied to the trustees, repeated acts
of vandalism in the area have made it
virtually unuseable for instructional
purposes in recent years.
A number of building addition and
renovation proposals will also receive
attention. Four major projects, totaling
some $37.44 million, will be presented
for approval of financing, including a
$20 million addition to Main Library, a
$940,000 renovation of Old Pavilion
across from Encina Hall, an $8.5 mill

ion reconstruction of Margaret Jacks
Hall (building 460), and an $8 million
reconstruction of History Corner.
The Old Pavilion renovation will be
primarily to provide space for various
administrative offices once housed in
Encina Hall, the east wing of which
was gutted by fire in June, 1972. The
officials have used Old Pavilion since
â–ºhat time until a decision could be
made for permanent facilities. The cost
of renovating the burned section of
Encina Hall would be prohibitive, ac
cording to Robert Rosen/.weig, vice
president of university affairs, so the
board has been asked to provide funds
for renovation of the former Athletic
Department facility.
Other matters which will receive
consideration include 1977-78 tuition.
This month, according to Rosenzweig.
the Committee of Finance and De
velopment will hear a report by uni
versity staff members on the subject
and a discussion will occur. Actual
setting of the amount of tuition is

slated for the regular December meet
ing.
Trustees will also receive a report on
the outcome of the 1975-76 operating
budget. The university sustained a
$188,000 deficit last year, a dramati
cally smaller figure than the over $1.9
million which was anticipated when
the budget was approved in March,
1975. The university is predicting a

$214,000 deficit for 1976-77 according
to a report scheduled for presentation
at the meeting.
Board members will also hear re
ports on some of the research presently
going on here including the controver
sial recombinant DNA "genetic en
gineering". The panel will hear and
discuss recently adopted guidelines
for the research.
