$8.95

From scruffy beginning to
down-at-heel ending The
Family Arsenal by Paul
Theroux gives a true impres
sion of the London of today;
contrived, complex, ambigu
ous. seedy, and ultimately
pointless. The novel's charac
ters are incidental to the great
city; they are waltzed onto the
stage competently enough,
the strings that tug them up
and down are in experienced

hands, but the heads are
putty. Only the great city,
skilfully evoked, is real, and
what a mess it is. One charac
ter. an unlikely accountant
named Gawper, actually
spends most of his time long
ing for an apocalypse to
dump London and inhabit
ants into a cleft in the earth.
The plot is overblown;
Theroux has taken 'Only
connect' in a literal sense.
Here are enough connections
for anyone. Hood, an opium
smoking American. ex-US
consul in Hue, reprogram
med by his encounter with
the Far East, has surfaced in a
provisional IRA hangout in
south London. Hood is no or
dinary righter of wrongs. For
a graduate of those two grand
schools of masterful inaction.

the U.S. Foreign Service and
the Republic of Viet Nam
(deed.). Hood shows consid
erable form. He is definitely a
forceful sort of guy. Before we
so much as learn Hood's first
name, he has laid hands upon
one Ron Weech and broken
his neck, after softening up
Weech with a knee in theface.
That Hood has never met
Weech before adds to the
poignancy of their brief en
counter.
Hood has all the moves. Not
only does he connect with the
Widow Weech shortly after
eliminating her old man. he
simultaneously cohabits with
a rich IRA agent. Mayo, who
has stolen a painting so valu
able and beautiful that the
bourgeois powers-that-be
immediately write it off to the
Irish bad debt account, thus
frustrating Mayo's desire to
blackmail them. Still with
me?
Characters drift into Hood's
orbit, and, though they are
presented with a goodly
amount of conventional de
tail about their sex lives and
fetishes, they exist only as
props. Hood himself doesn't
seem to be all there either,
perhaps due to the malaria
that has turned the whites of
his eyes yellow or perhaps
due more to his being per
petually stoned.
A couple of the minor fi
gures. however, have a horrid
sort of reality, being freely
drawn from life as lived in the

Trendy Leftie circles of Lon
don. Possibly they are a bit
too much for a non-English
audience. Lady Arrow, for
example, is rich, socialist,
and lesbian, though I may
have the order wrong.
Judged as a thriller or a
good read, The Family Arse
nal is a pretty dreadful book.
Apart from a plot that Verdi
would reject as contrived,
dialogue that would embar
rass Arthur Hailey, and such
textual gems as "he felt a
dumb hilarity in his groin,"
Theroux lets us know with an
opening quote from Henry
James (Henry James in a thril
ler?) that he has plans for us.
Uplifting plans. We are flat
tered with a little snatch of
Kipling as a warm-up. Then
the pitch. We're supposed to
think of Conrad's The Secret
Agent. Theroux drops the
name if Conrad's protagonist,
Verlor, once, then explains
the allusion later for those of
us who are slow. So what if
theplot issilly?Thisauthoris
not merely literate; he is liter
ary. This novel is no vulgar
thriller; it is an entertain
ment, a way of making money
while practicing the craft of
writing. 1 mean, your actual
Len Deighton don't know this
shit, do he? So what if Con
rad's tale is a moral allegory,
and The Family Arsenal is
devoid of any content at all?
It's no crime to ape your bet
ters. Anyway, it sits well with
the more academic sort of re
viewer.

The interesting question is
whyTheroux, a talented man,
bothered to churn out this sad
little story. It's an English
story, told in an English way,
yet Theroux is American. But
he works hard on his effects,
gets the slang and the ugly
south London accents right,
and generally does more than
is needed to get time on the
BBC talk shows or reviewing
work for the "Sunday
Times."
The answer, 1 think, is that
Theroux is the traditional
'hate that shoddy TV culture'
American literary expatriate.
Without roots he has to in
itiate, and initiations are al
ways a bit out of date. For we
have been here before; we
know this world. The mean
streets, the shrivelled and un
shriven souls, the mindless
cruelty done in the name of
humanity. But where is the
tortured Catholic convert,
nursing a sick conscience and
an empty gin bottle? Where is
the failed priest or the re
morseful killer? Where is the
search for final things behind
the killing and the maiming?
Gone. All that is left is the
mummery, and that none too
well done. O, where are you
now, Graham Greene?
Theroux needs you.
The Greene vein was rich
and broad, but how mined
out. Young English writers
only write like Thgroux by
accident or for money. I feel
for Theroux. He has chosen to
live within the confines of the
London literary establish
ment. Like the Empire, it has
seen better days, yet survives
in a debilitating twisted,
form. It demands sacrifices,
like phony atmospheric de
scription and stagey
dialogue. You review me; I
review you, and twice a
month my publisher's public
ity agent will buy your lunch.
The subject matter of The
Family Arsenal is promising.
Drugs, murder, sex, Vietnam,
the IRA, even dog racing, and
all those colorful London set
tings. Think what the author
of Dog Soldiers would make
of this mix. Theroux has
blown an opportunity. Come
home, buddy, you need a re
charge.

The Family Arsenal.
A book by Paul Theroux
Houghton Mifflin Co.
$8.95

From scruffy beginning to
down-at-heel ending The
Family Arsenal by Paul
Theroux gives a true impres
sion of the London of today;
contrived, complex, ambigu
ous. seedy, and ultimately
pointless. The novel's charac
ters are incidental to the great
city; they are waltzed onto the
stage competently enough,
the strings that tug them up
and down are in experienced

hands, but the heads are
putty. Only the great city,
skilfully evoked, is real, and
what a mess it is. One charac
ter. an unlikely accountant
named Gawper, actually
spends most of his time long
ing for an apocalypse to
dump London and inhabit
ants into a cleft in the earth.
The plot is overblown;
Theroux has taken 'Only
connect' in a literal sense.
Here are enough connections
for anyone. Hood, an opium
smoking American. ex-US
consul in Hue, reprogram
med by his encounter with
the Far East, has surfaced in a
provisional IRA hangout in
south London. Hood is no or
dinary righter of wrongs. For
a graduate of those two grand
schools of masterful inaction.

the U.S. Foreign Service and
the Republic of Viet Nam
(deed.). Hood shows consid
erable form. He is definitely a
forceful sort of guy. Before we
so much as learn Hood's first
name, he has laid hands upon
one Ron Weech and broken
his neck, after softening up
Weech with a knee in theface.
That Hood has never met
Weech before adds to the
poignancy of their brief en
counter.
Hood has all the moves. Not
only does he connect with the
Widow Weech shortly after
eliminating her old man. he
simultaneously cohabits with
a rich IRA agent. Mayo, who
has stolen a painting so valu
able and beautiful that the
bourgeois powers-that-be
immediately write it off to the
Irish bad debt account, thus
frustrating Mayo's desire to
blackmail them. Still with
me?
Characters drift into Hood's
orbit, and, though they are
presented with a goodly
amount of conventional de
tail about their sex lives and
fetishes, they exist only as
props. Hood himself doesn't
seem to be all there either,
perhaps due to the malaria
that has turned the whites of
his eyes yellow or perhaps
due more to his being per
petually stoned.
A couple of the minor fi
gures. however, have a horrid
sort of reality, being freely
drawn from life as lived in the

Trendy Leftie circles of Lon
don. Possibly they are a bit
too much for a non-English
audience. Lady Arrow, for
example, is rich, socialist,
and lesbian, though I may
have the order wrong.
Judged as a thriller or a
good read, The Family Arse
nal is a pretty dreadful book.
Apart from a plot that Verdi
would reject as contrived,
dialogue that would embar
rass Arthur Hailey, and such
textual gems as "he felt a
dumb hilarity in his groin,"
Theroux lets us know with an
opening quote from Henry
James (Henry James in a thril
ler?) that he has plans for us.
Uplifting plans. We are flat
tered with a little snatch of
Kipling as a warm-up. Then
the pitch. We're supposed to
think of Conrad's The Secret
Agent. Theroux drops the
name if Conrad's protagonist,
Verlor, once, then explains
the allusion later for those of
us who are slow. So what if
theplot issilly?Thisauthoris
not merely literate; he is liter
ary. This novel is no vulgar
thriller; it is an entertain
ment, a way of making money
while practicing the craft of
writing. 1 mean, your actual
Len Deighton don't know this
shit, do he? So what if Con
rad's tale is a moral allegory,
and The Family Arsenal is
devoid of any content at all?
It's no crime to ape your bet
ters. Anyway, it sits well with
the more academic sort of re
viewer.

The interesting question is
whyTheroux, a talented man,
bothered to churn out this sad
little story. It's an English
story, told in an English way,
yet Theroux is American. But
he works hard on his effects,
gets the slang and the ugly
south London accents right,
and generally does more than
is needed to get time on the
BBC talk shows or reviewing
work for the "Sunday
Times."
The answer, 1 think, is that
Theroux is the traditional
'hate that shoddy TV culture'
American literary expatriate.
Without roots he has to in
itiate, and initiations are al
ways a bit out of date. For we
have been here before; we
know this world. The mean
streets, the shrivelled and un
shriven souls, the mindless
cruelty done in the name of
humanity. But where is the
tortured Catholic convert,
nursing a sick conscience and
an empty gin bottle? Where is
the failed priest or the re
morseful killer? Where is the
search for final things behind
the killing and the maiming?
Gone. All that is left is the
mummery, and that none too
well done. O, where are you
now, Graham Greene?
Theroux needs you.
The Greene vein was rich
and broad, but how mined
out. Young English writers
only write like Thgroux by
accident or for money. I feel
for Theroux. He has chosen to
live within the confines of the
London literary establish
ment. Like the Empire, it has
seen better days, yet survives
in a debilitating twisted,
form. It demands sacrifices,
like phony atmospheric de
scription and stagey
dialogue. You review me; I
review you, and twice a
month my publisher's public
ity agent will buy your lunch.
The subject matter of The
Family Arsenal is promising.
Drugs, murder, sex, Vietnam,
the IRA, even dog racing, and
all those colorful London set
tings. Think what the author
of Dog Soldiers would make

The Family Arsenal.
A book by Paul Theroux
Houghton Mifflin Co.
$8.95

From scruffy beginning to
down-at-heel ending The
Family Arsenal by Paul
Theroux gives a true impres
sion of the London of today;
contrived, complex, ambigu
ous. seedy, and ultimately
pointless. The novel's charac
ters are incidental to the great
city; they are waltzed onto the
stage competently enough,
the strings that tug them up
and down are in experienced

hands, but the heads are
putty. Only the great city,
skilfully evoked, is real, and
what a mess it is. One charac
ter. an unlikely accountant
named Gawper, actually
spends most of his time long
ing for an apocalypse to
dump London and inhabit
ants into a cleft in the earth.
The plot is overblown;
Theroux has taken 'Only
connect' in a literal sense.
Here are enough connections
for anyone. Hood, an opium
smoking American. ex-US
consul in Hue, reprogram
med by his encounter with
the Far East, has surfaced in a
provisional IRA hangout in
south London. Hood is no or
dinary righter of wrongs. For
a graduate of those two grand
schools of masterful inaction.

the U.S. Foreign Service and
the Republic of Viet Nam
(deed.). Hood shows consid
erable form. He is definitely a
forceful sort of guy. Before we
so much as learn Hood's first
name, he has laid hands upon
one Ron Weech and broken
his neck, after softening up
Weech with a knee in theface.
That Hood has never met
Weech before adds to the
poignancy of their brief en
counter.
Hood has all the moves. Not
only does he connect with the
Widow Weech shortly after
eliminating her old man. he
simultaneously cohabits with
a rich IRA agent. Mayo, who
has stolen a painting so valu
able and beautiful that the
bourgeois powers-that-be
immediately write it off to the
Irish bad debt account, thus
frustrating Mayo's desire to
blackmail them. Still with
me?
Characters drift into Hood's
orbit, and, though they are
presented with a goodly
amount of conventional de
tail about their sex lives and
fetishes, they exist only as
props. Hood himself doesn't
seem to be all there either,
perhaps due to the malaria
that has turned the whites of
his eyes yellow or perhaps
due more to his being per
petually stoned.
A couple of the minor fi
gures. however, have a horrid
sort of reality, being freely
drawn from life as lived in the

Trendy Leftie circles of Lon
don. Possibly they are a bit
too much for a non-English
audience. Lady Arrow, for
example, is rich, socialist,
and lesbian, though I may
have the order wrong.
Judged as a thriller or a
good read, The Family Arse
nal is a pretty dreadful book.
Apart from a plot that Verdi
would reject as contrived,
dialogue that would embar
rass Arthur Hailey, and such
textual gems as "he felt a
dumb hilarity in his groin,"
Theroux lets us know with an
opening quote from Henry
James (Henry James in a thril
ler?) that he has plans for us.
Uplifting plans. We are flat
tered with a little snatch of
Kipling as a warm-up. Then
the pitch. We're supposed to
think of Conrad's The Secret
Agent. Theroux drops the
name if Conrad's protagonist,
Verlor, once, then explains
the allusion later for those of
us who are slow. So what if
theplot issilly?Thisauthoris
not merely literate; he is liter
ary. This novel is no vulgar
thriller; it is an entertain
ment, a way of making money
while practicing the craft of
writing. 1 mean, your actual
Len Deighton don't know this
shit, do he? So what if Con
rad's tale is a moral allegory,
and The Family Arsenal is
devoid of any content at all?
It's no crime to ape your bet
ters. Anyway, it sits well with
the more academic sort of re
viewer.

The interesting question is
whyTheroux, a talented man,
bothered to churn out this sad
little story. It's an English
story, told in an English way,
yet Theroux is American. But
he works hard on his effects,
gets the slang and the ugly
south London accents right,
and generally does more than
is needed to get time on the
BBC talk shows or reviewing
work for the "Sunday
Times."
The answer, 1 think, is that
Theroux is the traditional
'hate that shoddy TV culture'
American literary expatriate.
Without roots he has to in
itiate, and initiations are al
ways a bit out of date. For we
have been here before; we
know this world. The mean
streets, the shrivelled and un
shriven souls, the mindless
cruelty done in the name of
humanity. But where is the
tortured Catholic convert,
nursing a sick conscience and
an empty gin bottle? Where is
the failed priest or the re
morseful killer? Where is the
search for final things behind
the killing and the maiming?
Gone. All that is left is the
mummery, and that none too
well done. O, where are you
now, Graham Greene?
Theroux needs you.
The Greene vein was rich
and broad, but how mined
out. Young English writers
only write like Thgroux by
accident or for money. I feel
for Theroux. He has chosen to
live within the confines of the
London literary establish
ment. Like the Empire, it has
seen better days, yet survives
in a debilitating twisted,
form. It demands sacrifices,
like phony atmospheric de
scription and stagey
dialogue. You review me; I
review you, and twice a
month my publisher's public
ity agent will buy your lunch.
