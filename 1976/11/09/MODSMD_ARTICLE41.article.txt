## Youthful Writings should boost Camus study

n recent times, the
1 a warding of the
Nobel Prize in Liter
ature to a Western
novelist has
usually been followed by a
significant surge of interest in
the author's work. Admirers
and detractors alike, with a
healthy disregard of the cap
rices of the Swedish
Academy, are affected by
what is now regarded by
some as the Western World's
supreme literary accolade
and by the seemingly mysti
cal legitimization it brings to
an author's work.
When French author Al
bert Camus received the
Nobel Prize in 1957, a re
kindling of interest in his
novels came as a matter of
course. Another significant
examination followed the
news of his tragic death in an
automobile accident a few
years later.
During the interval bet
ween Camus' death in 1960
and the present, publishing
companies have sought to
capitalize on this awakening
literary interest by bringing
out great quantities of post
humous material. Camus's
Notebooks were printed in
two editions in the early '60s;
a work entitled Lyrical and
Critical Essays followed
shortly in 1968; an early at
tempt at a ndvel, A Happy
Death, which reflects much of
the young Camus's struggle
to discipline his voice, was
edited and published in 1972.
Interest in Camus
Youthful Writings pub
lished this year in English
represents the latest attempt
by publishers to keep the
waning tide of interest in
Camus strong. But with all re
spect to this great author, the

gragments and illogically
conceived pieces in this edi
tion are of such minor impor
tance, save the biographical
information they provide,
that it would have been well
had they never appeared in
print.
Camus, writing in his
Notebooks. saw little merit in
the efforts of biographical
criticism. For him, the en
vironmental expieriences
which shaped his thinking
were of less importance than
the actual statements of that
thought contained in his
novels and essays. It is ironic
that biographical criticism,
for which Camus felt such
disdain, should be the only
redeeming aspect of this
latest book.
Nearly half of Youthful
Writings consists of an infor
mative though somewhat
overly laudatory and long
winded introductory essay by
Paul Viallaneix. An effective
attempt has been made by
Viallaneix to record Camus's
early life in Algiers. The essay

provides an interesting
glimpse of the fledgling wri
ter absorbed in his early read
ings and struggling to strip
his language of superfluous
ornamentation. Unfortu
nately. the actual Camus
fragments, written in 1932
and 1933. when he was in his
early twenties, and before the
author begins his major ad
vances.
Movement
The movement from a
naive and energetic young
writer to a nature stylist is
never fully discerned. Vial
laneiux's essay makes its
greatest contribution in the
examination of this critical
period.and it isannoying that
they accompanying frag
ments are incomplete in
paralleling this movement.
Taken reportedly, without
regard for the events which
shaped half of them, Camus's
reflections are more ambiti
ous than profound. Now and
then particularly in the fic
tion pieces "Voices From the
Poor Quarter" and"The
Moorish House," Camus
strikes the first chords of lyri
cism that will characterize his
later works. But the prelude
to the future mastery stops
short. Tricks of eloquence,

the persistence of logical
terms of phrase, and heavy
layering of certain adjectives
burden the prose, making it
sluggish and uneven.
In effect. Youthful Writings
can claim little in the way of
exposing Camus as a man of
substantial literary standing.
For the hardcore Camus fan or
the academic, interested not
so much in the ideas these es
says and stories present in
isolation, but for a glimpse
into the young Camus's ef
forts to perfect his expression,
this collection will be of some
interest. But for the general
reader, aware of Camus's

reputation and interested in
the maturity of the author's
later work.s effort should not
he wasted on Youthful Writ
ings.
The hook is interesting, but
the interest it arouses is of the
narrowest sort. While Youth
ful Writings does little to en
hace Camus's standing as a
writer in any substantial way.
the book is informative about
the changes within the man
himself. Ultimately the deci
sion as to whether biographi
cal information is interesting
or is a necessary tool for com
prehensive critical analysis
must be left to the dis
criminating reader.

Nearly half of Youthful
Writings consists of an infor
mative though somewhat
overly laudatory and long
winded introductory essay by
Paul Viallaneix. An effective
attempt has been made by
Viallaneix to record Camus's
early life in Algiers. The essay

provides an interesting
glimpse of the fledgling wri
ter absorbed in his early read
ings and struggling to strip
his language of superfluous
ornamentation. Unfortu
nately. the actual Camus
fragments, written in 1932
and 1933. when he was in his
early twenties, and before the
author begins his major ad
vances.
Movement
The movement from a
naive and energetic young
writer to a nature stylist is
never fully discerned. Vial
laneiux's essay makes its
greatest contribution in the
examination of this critical
period.and it isannoying that
they accompanying frag
ments are incomplete in
paralleling this movement.
Taken reportedly, without
regard for the events which
shaped half of them, Camus's
reflections are more ambiti
ous than profound. Now and
then particularly in the fic
tion pieces "Voices From the
Poor Quarter" and"The
Moorish House," Camus
strikes the first chords of lyri
cism that will characterize his
later works. But the prelude
to the future mastery stops
short. Tricks of eloquence,

the persistence of logical
terms of phrase, and heavy
layering of certain adjectives
burden the prose, making it
sluggish and uneven.
In effect. Youthful Writings
can claim little in the way of
exposing Camus as a man of
substantial literary standing.
For the hardcore Camus fan or
the academic, interested not
so much in the ideas these es
says and stories present in
isolation, but for a glimpse
into the young Camus's ef
forts to perfect his expression,

Youthful Writings, Volume 11.
The notebooks of Albert Cam us.
Translated by Ellen Conroy Kennedy

n recent times, the
1 a warding of the
Nobel Prize in Liter
ature to a Western
novelist has
usually been followed by a
significant surge of interest in
the author's work. Admirers
and detractors alike, with a
healthy disregard of the cap
rices of the Swedish
Academy, are affected by
what is now regarded by
some as the Western World's
supreme literary accolade
and by the seemingly mysti
cal legitimization it brings to
an author's work.
When French author Al
bert Camus received the
Nobel Prize in 1957, a re
kindling of interest in his
novels came as a matter of
course. Another significant
examination followed the
news of his tragic death in an
automobile accident a few
years later.
During the interval bet
ween Camus' death in 1960
and the present, publishing
companies have sought to
capitalize on this awakening
literary interest by bringing
out great quantities of post
humous material. Camus's
Notebooks were printed in
two editions in the early '60s;
a work entitled Lyrical and
Critical Essays followed
shortly in 1968; an early at
tempt at a ndvel, A Happy
Death, which reflects much of
the young Camus's struggle
to discipline his voice, was
edited and published in 1972.
Interest in Camus
Youthful Writings pub
lished this year in English
represents the latest attempt
by publishers to keep the
waning tide of interest in
Camus strong. But with all re
spect to this great author, the

gragments and illogically
conceived pieces in this edi
tion are of such minor impor
tance, save the biographical
information they provide,
that it would have been well
had they never appeared in
print.
Camus, writing in his
Notebooks. saw little merit in
the efforts of biographical
criticism. For him, the en
vironmental expieriences
which shaped his thinking
were of less importance than
the actual statements of that
thought contained in his
novels and essays. It is ironic
that biographical criticism,
for which Camus felt such
disdain, should be the only
redeeming aspect of this
latest book.
Nearly half of Youthful
Writings consists of an infor
mative though somewhat
overly laudatory and long
winded introductory essay by
Paul Viallaneix. An effective
attempt has been made by
Viallaneix to record Camus's
early life in Algiers. The essay

provides an interesting
glimpse of the fledgling wri
ter absorbed in his early read
ings and struggling to strip
his language of superfluous
ornamentation. Unfortu
nately. the actual Camus
fragments, written in 1932
and 1933. when he was in his
early twenties, and before the
author begins his major ad
vances.
Movement
The movement from a
naive and energetic young
writer to a nature stylist is
never fully discerned. Vial
laneiux's essay makes its
greatest contribution in the
examination of this critical
period.and it isannoying that
they accompanying frag
ments are incomplete in
paralleling this movement.
Taken reportedly, without
regard for the events which
shaped half of them, Camus's
reflections are more ambiti
ous than profound. Now and
then particularly in the fic
tion pieces "Voices From the
Poor Quarter" and"The
Moorish House," Camus
strikes the first chords of lyri
cism that will characterize his
later works. But the prelude
to the future mastery stops
short. Tricks of eloquence,

the persistence of logical
terms of phrase, and heavy
layering of certain adjectives
burden the prose, making it
sluggish and uneven.
In effect. Youthful Writings
can claim little in the way of
exposing Camus as a man of
substantial literary standing.
For the hardcore Camus fan or
the academic, interested not
so much in the ideas these es
says and stories present in
isolation, but for a glimpse
into the young Camus's ef
forts to perfect his expression,
this collection will be of some
interest. But for the general
reader, aware of Camus's

reputation and interested in
the maturity of the author's
later work.s effort should not
he wasted on Youthful Writ
ings.
The hook is interesting, but
the interest it arouses is of the
narrowest sort. While Youth
ful Writings does little to en
hace Camus's standing as a
writer in any substantial way.
the book is informative about
the changes within the man
himself. Ultimately the deci
sion as to whether biographi
cal information is interesting
or is a necessary tool for com
prehensive critical analysis
must be left to the dis
criminating reader.
