## Close Searsville 
### 
The Board of Trustees will vote today on whether Searsville
Lake should be added to the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve and
no longer used for public recreational purposes. Citizens and
local governments have reacted strongly to the possibility of the
lake being closed to tne public. Public complaints notwithstand
ing, the board should vote to add the lake to the preserve.
The university has been allowing the public to use the lake tor
recreational purposes. Unfortunately, some people have abused
this permission and not only are they destroying the beauty of
the lake but they have even begun to endanger the preserve itself,
which borders on the lake.
If the lake is added to the preserve, it will not only protect the
preserve but will allow research to be expanded to the lake itself.
Land is the heart of this university, and even though not all
land is currently being used for academic purposes, that option
is — and must be — open. The time has come to use Searsville
Lake for academic pursuits, something for which it was en
visioned many years ago.
