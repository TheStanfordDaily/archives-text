# No golf course

We look with disfavor at the suggestion by the City of Menlo
Park that it may condemn university land between Sand Hill and
Whiskey Hill Roads for use as public golf course. In our view,
this would bean abuse of thecity's right of condemnation, which
should be reserved for situations in which public health and
safety is at stake.
The university, with good cause, has been reluctant to lease
the land to the city. Once converted to a golf course, it will be
costly for both the university and the city to reconvert the land
for academic uses.
If it were clear that the public's health or safety were involved
in the golf course issue, the threatened condemnation procedure
might be justified. In this case, however, Menlo Park residents
have other recreational facilities for their use, and it is far from
clear that, if the city wants to expand its facilities, it must use this
particular parcel of land.
Further, it is important to distinguish between use of the land
as a park for all residents as well as students here and use of the
land exclusvely for golfers.
Clearly, the condemnation procedure is unjustified in this case.
The university has the right to dispose of its land as it sees fit, and
should be allowed to do so.
