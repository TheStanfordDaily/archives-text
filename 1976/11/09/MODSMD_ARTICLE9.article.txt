# Potential conflict
## 
### 
ASSU Sen. Jeff Stoler is both a member of the senate and the
chairman of the ASSU Publications Board, which supervises
student publications such as the Arena, the Course Guide, and
the Chaparral. We believe this situation has created a potential
conflict of interest for Stoler, and urge Stoler to exclude himself
from voting in the senate on matters affecting the board.
As board chairman, Stoler is required to serve as an impartial
arbiter between publications and between the ASSU and the
board. In his present situation, he may be called upon to take a
side in the senate on matters already taken up by the board,
causing confusion.
An example of this conflict was the debate over funding for the
Course Guide last year. Though the board rejected the publica
tion's request, the senate overrode that action and granted the
funds. Clearly were Stoler a member of the legislative body at the
same time he was called upon to impartially chair the board, his
credibility in the board hearing would be threatened.
In addition, Stoler's duties as board chairman include overse
eing the use of board funds. As a senate member, he must, along
with the rest of the senate, oversee the actions of the board in
allocating publication funds. Thus, he would be in the position
of overseeing his own task of oversight.
Stoler's dual role is,at best, confusing. By excluding himself
from voting in the senate on board-related matters, however, he
can rid himself of this conflict. We urge him to do so.
