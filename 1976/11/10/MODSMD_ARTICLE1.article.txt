# Trustees close Searsville Lake
## 
### Mike Charlson 
The board of trustees voted yester
day to close Searsville Lake and adja
cent land in South San Mateo County
to public use, according to Andrew
Doty, director of community relations.
The board also approved financing
for four major academic projects, three
of which include debt financing.
The 105-acre lake, located on uni
versity land, and 215 acres of adjacent
land will be incorporated into the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. The
land will now be used solely for
academic purposes making it the
"only fully-protected lake on a college
campus in the United States," Vice
President and Provost William Miller
said.
"We have a rare and priceless oppor
tunity to create a field laboratory at the
lake and ridge that can he without
parallel in this country," Miller told
the trustees. "The land has been held
all these years to serve the university's
educational needs and we must move
in that direction."
Closing the lake to the public was
prompted by continued acts of van
dalism in the area and a dramatic in
crease in public recreational use, ac
cording to Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for university relations.
Research, not recreation
He said that when the reserve was
first opened in 1973, the university
had hoped that research and recreation
at the site could coexist. However, over
the past 18 months, it became increas
ingly clear that this could not be the
case.
A large grant to the biology depart
ment about six months ago enabled the
board to buy the lease.
Rosenzweig made his comments last
night on KZSU's Campus Conference.
He added that littering, and destruc
tion of facilities and public interfer
ence with certain experiments being
conducted at the lake accelerated yes
terday's today's action. "Maybe people
and nature just don't coexist well," he
said.
Vandalism
He said the "extensive" vandalism
was an influential consideration with
the trustees. At the same time, how
ever, Rosenzweig agreed that closure
would not necessarily end acts of van
dalism.

"I don't think anyone has come up
with a way to completely eliminate
vandalism in modern times," he com
mented. Reduced traffic in the area
may reduce incidents simply because
of an absence of people, he said.
Edna Sott, chairperson of the
Searsville Committee for Education
and Recreation, vvhch opposed the
lake closure, said she was upset be
cause her organization had advocated
a "workable" dual usage proposal
which was ignored. However, she said
she had not lost hope that her proposal
may still be instituted.
"1 can understand Stanford wanting
to use Searsville Lake for educational
puposes, and we feel that regulated re
creational use is not incompatible with
educational use," she said. "We hope
Stanford will create such a program for
the benefit to the large community of
which Stanford is a part."
Limit recreational use
Sott mentioned that under their
proposal, only 200 to 400 people
would be allowed the use the facility
during the summer months plus
Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and
Labor Day. The request provided for
use 47 days out to the year, she said.
Conservation coordinator for the
local chapter of the Sierra Club Ti
Still, said, "We were very sorry to
hear about the trustees' decision to
close Searsville Lake."
The organization was particularly
disturbed that the board has not al
lowed direct public input into the de
cision through hearings. "We were
very sorry to hear that Stanford did not
bring the issue to public forum," Still
said.
Rosenzweig said that the university
had not ruled out the public educa
tional use of the area, but it was reluc
tant to advertise that fact because
"we didn't want to be in the position of
making misleading promises in order
to buy acquiescence to a decision
people don't like."
Debt financing.
In other action, the board approved
financing for the main library addi
tion, renovation of Margaret Jacks Hall
(building 460 in the quad) and renova
tion of the history corner which will all
include long term debt in their finan
cial arrangements. This is not the first

time the university has utilized this
option.
The debt will be in the form of bonds
sought through the California Educa
tional Facilities Authority (CEFA) and
will total some $H. 9 million plus in
terest.
Rosenzweig said that interest rates
will be fixed when a new CEFA issue is
made available. He mentioned that
rates are traditionally low for such
bonds, but selling them has never been
a problem.
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost for
budget and planning, confirmed that
payment of debt will be from the
operating budget, essentially tuition.
However, affect from the decision will
not be dramatically recognizable in
tuition rates, he said.
"The capacity to carry that debt was
built into the budget a year ago," Bac
chetti said. He mentioned that debt
service will account for about
$860,000 annually. The total operat
ing budget this year is about $96 mill
ion.
Using tuition
Rosenzweig said that the action rep
resents a new train of thought within
the university. In the past, debt financ
ing was considered only for revenue
generating facilities such as dor
mitories. In 1973, however, the board
concurred that top academic facilities

generate income in the form of tuition,
thus making debt financing feasible.
Rosenzweig made it clear that debt
financing was not to become a popular
nor necessarily widespread method of
financing academic projects here. "1
don't know of any projects in the near
future that would be financed in this
way," he said.
The board also heard a discussion of
admissions procedures, financial aid,
the affect of higher tuition on the uni
versity's ability to attract "highly qual
ified students," and related matters
which will lead to a setting of tuition
figures next month. No figures were
mentioned in yesterday's meeting and
no speculation on tuition costs was of
fered.
Genetic engineering
In addition, trustees heard a report
on safety precautions being employed
with recombinant DNA research.
"Stanford scientists are in the foref
ront in this area of research."
Rosenzweig said. That, combined with
its national importance and Stanford's
application on a patent for the process
of recombining DNA has resulted in
trustee interest in the subject, he said.
He explained that controversy over
the work stems from possible en
vironmental contamination by
disease-causing organisms engineered
to be genetically superior.

time the university has utilized this
option.
The debt will be in the form of bonds
sought through the California Educa
tional Facilities Authority (CEFA) and
will total some $H. 9 million plus in
terest.
Rosenzweig said that interest rates
will be fixed when a new CEFA issue is
made available. He mentioned that
rates are traditionally low for such
bonds, but selling them has never been
a problem.
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost for
budget and planning, confirmed that
payment of debt will be from the
operating budget, essentially tuition.
However, affect from the decision will
not be dramatically recognizable in
tuition rates, he said.
"The capacity to carry that debt was
built into the budget a year ago," Bac
chetti said. He mentioned that debt
service will account for about
$860,000 annually. The total operat
ing budget this year is about $96 mill
ion.
Using tuition
Rosenzweig said that the action rep
resents a new train of thought within
the university. In the past, debt financ
ing was considered only for revenue
generating facilities such as dor
mitories. In 1973, however, the board
concurred that top academic facilities

generate income in the form of tuition,
thus making debt financing feasible.
Rosenzweig made it clear that debt
financing was not to become a popular
nor necessarily widespread method of
financing academic projects here. "1
don't know of any projects in the near
future that would be financed in this
way," he said.
The board also heard a discussion of
admissions procedures, financial aid,
the affect of higher tuition on the uni
versity's ability to attract "highly qual
ified students," and related matters
which will lead to a setting of tuition
figures next month. No figures were
mentioned in yesterday's meeting and
no speculation on tuition costs was of
fered.
Genetic engineering
In addition, trustees heard a report
on safety precautions being employed
with recombinant DNA research.
"Stanford scientists are in the foref
ront in this area of research."
Rosenzweig said. That, combined with
its national importance and Stanford's
application on a patent for the process
of recombining DNA has resulted in
trustee interest in the subject, he said.
He explained that controversy over
the work stems from possible en
vironmental contamination by
disease-causing organisms engineered
to be genetically superior.
The board of trustees voted yester
day to close Searsville Lake and adja
cent land in South San Mateo County
to public use, according to Andrew
Doty, director of community relations.
The board also approved financing
for four major academic projects, three
of which include debt financing.
The 105-acre lake, located on uni
versity land, and 215 acres of adjacent
land will be incorporated into the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. The
land will now be used solely for
academic purposes making it the
"only fully-protected lake on a college
campus in the United States," Vice
President and Provost William Miller
said.
"We have a rare and priceless oppor
tunity to create a field laboratory at the
lake and ridge that can he without
parallel in this country," Miller told
the trustees. "The land has been held
all these years to serve the university's
educational needs and we must move
in that direction."
Closing the lake to the public was
prompted by continued acts of van
dalism in the area and a dramatic in
crease in public recreational use, ac
cording to Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for university relations.
Research, not recreation
He said that when the reserve was
first opened in 1973, the university
had hoped that research and recreation
at the site could coexist. However, over
the past 18 months, it became increas
ingly clear that this could not be the
case.
A large grant to the biology depart
ment about six months ago enabled the
board to buy the lease.
Rosenzweig made his comments last
night on KZSU's Campus Conference.
He added that littering, and destruc
tion of facilities and public interfer
ence with certain experiments being
conducted at the lake accelerated yes
terday's today's action. "Maybe people
and nature just don't coexist well," he
said.
Vandalism
He said the "extensive" vandalism
was an influential consideration with
the trustees. At the same time, how
ever, Rosenzweig agreed that closure
would not necessarily end acts of van
dalism.

"I don't think anyone has come up
with a way to completely eliminate
vandalism in modern times," he com
mented. Reduced traffic in the area
may reduce incidents simply because
of an absence of people, he said.
Edna Sott, chairperson of the
Searsville Committee for Education
and Recreation, vvhch opposed the
lake closure, said she was upset be
cause her organization had advocated
a "workable" dual usage proposal
which was ignored. However, she said
she had not lost hope that her proposal
may still be instituted.
"1 can understand Stanford wanting
to use Searsville Lake for educational
puposes, and we feel that regulated re
creational use is not incompatible with
educational use," she said. "We hope
Stanford will create such a program for
the benefit to the large community of
which Stanford is a part."
Limit recreational use
Sott mentioned that under their
proposal, only 200 to 400 people
would be allowed the use the facility
during the summer months plus
Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and
Labor Day. The request provided for
use 47 days out to the year, she said.
Conservation coordinator for the
local chapter of the Sierra Club Ti
Still, said, "We were very sorry to
hear about the trustees' decision to
close Searsville Lake."
The organization was particularly
disturbed that the board has not al
lowed direct public input into the de
cision through hearings. "We were
very sorry to hear that Stanford did not
bring the issue to public forum," Still
said.
Rosenzweig said that the university
had not ruled out the public educa
tional use of the area, but it was reluc
tant to advertise that fact because
"we didn't want to be in the position of
making misleading promises in order
to buy acquiescence to a decision
people don't like."
Debt financing.
In other action, the board approved
financing for the main library addi
tion, renovation of Margaret Jacks Hall
(building 460 in the quad) and renova
tion of the history corner which will all
include long term debt in their finan
cial arrangements. This is not the first

and nature just don't coexist well," he
said.
Vandalism
He said the "extensive" vandalism
was an influential consideration with
the trustees. At the same time, how
ever, Rosenzweig agreed that closure
would not necessarily end acts of van
dalism.

"I don't think anyone has come up
with a way to completely eliminate
vandalism in modern times," he com
mented. Reduced traffic in the area
may reduce incidents simply because
of an absence of people, he said.
Edna Sott, chairperson of the
Searsville Committee for Education
and Recreation, vvhch opposed the
lake closure, said she was upset be
cause her organization had advocated
a "workable" dual usage proposal
which was ignored. However, she said
she had not lost hope that her proposal
may still be instituted.
"1 can understand Stanford wanting
to use Searsville Lake for educational
puposes, and we feel that regulated re
creational use is not incompatible with
educational use," she said. "We hope
Stanford will create such a program for
the benefit to the large community of
which Stanford is a part."
Limit recreational use
Sott mentioned that under their
proposal, only 200 to 400 people
would be allowed the use the facility
during the summer months plus
Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and
Labor Day. The request provided for
use 47 days out to the year, she said.
Conservation coordinator for the
local chapter of the Sierra Club Ti
Still, said, "We were very sorry to
hear about the trustees' decision to
close Searsville Lake."
The organization was particularly
disturbed that the board has not al
lowed direct public input into the de
cision through hearings. "We were
very sorry to hear that Stanford did not
bring the issue to public forum," Still
said.
Rosenzweig said that the university
had not ruled out the public educa
tional use of the area, but it was reluc
tant to advertise that fact because
"we didn't want to be in the position of
making misleading promises in order
to buy acquiescence to a decision
people don't like."
Debt financing.
In other action, the board approved
financing for the main library addi
tion, renovation of Margaret Jacks Hall
(building 460 in the quad) and renova
tion of the history corner which will all
include long term debt in their finan
cial arrangements. This is not the first

time the university has utilized this
option.
The debt will be in the form of bonds
sought through the California Educa
tional Facilities Authority (CEFA) and
will total some $H. 9 million plus in
terest.
Rosenzweig said that interest rates
will be fixed when a new CEFA issue is
made available. He mentioned that
rates are traditionally low for such
bonds, but selling them has never been
a problem.
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost for
budget and planning, confirmed that
payment of debt will be from the
operating budget, essentially tuition.
However, affect from the decision will
not be dramatically recognizable in
tuition rates, he said.
"The capacity to carry that debt was
built into the budget a year ago," Bac
chetti said. He mentioned that debt
service will account for about
$860,000 annually. The total operat
ing budget this year is about $96 mill
ion.
Using tuition
Rosenzweig said that the action rep
resents a new train of thought within
the university. In the past, debt financ
ing was considered only for revenue
generating facilities such as dor
mitories. In 1973, however, the board
concurred that top academic facilities

generate income in the form of tuition,
thus making debt financing feasible.
Rosenzweig made it clear that debt
financing was not to become a popular
nor necessarily widespread method of
financing academic projects here. "1
don't know of any projects in the near
future that would be financed in this
way," he said.
The board also heard a discussion of
admissions procedures, financial aid,
the affect of higher tuition on the uni
versity's ability to attract "highly qual
ified students," and related matters
which will lead to a setting of tuition
figures next month. No figures were
mentioned in yesterday's meeting and
no speculation on tuition costs was of
fered.
Genetic engineering
In addition, trustees heard a report
on safety precautions being employed
with recombinant DNA research.
"Stanford scientists are in the foref
ront in this area of research."
Rosenzweig said. That, combined with
its national importance and Stanford's
application on a patent for the process
of recombining DNA has resulted in
trustee interest in the subject, he said.
He explained that controversy over
the work stems from possible en
vironmental contamination by
disease-causing organisms engineered
to be genetically superior.
The board of trustees voted yester
day to close Searsville Lake and adja
cent land in South San Mateo County
to public use, according to Andrew
Doty, director of community relations.
The board also approved financing
for four major academic projects, three
of which include debt financing.
The 105-acre lake, located on uni
versity land, and 215 acres of adjacent
land will be incorporated into the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. The
land will now be used solely for
academic purposes making it the
"only fully-protected lake on a college
campus in the United States," Vice
President and Provost William Miller
said.
"We have a rare and priceless oppor
tunity to create a field laboratory at the
lake and ridge that can he without
parallel in this country," Miller told
the trustees. "The land has been held
all these years to serve the university's
educational needs and we must move
in that direction."
Closing the lake to the public was
prompted by continued acts of van
dalism in the area and a dramatic in
crease in public recreational use, ac
cording to Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for university relations.
Research, not recreation
He said that when the reserve was
first opened in 1973, the university
had hoped that research and recreation
at the site could coexist. However, over
the past 18 months, it became increas
ingly clear that this could not be the
case.
A large grant to the biology depart
ment about six months ago enabled the
board to buy the lease.
Rosenzweig made his comments last
night on KZSU's Campus Conference.
He added that littering, and destruc
tion of facilities and public interfer
ence with certain experiments being
conducted at the lake accelerated yes
terday's today's action. "Maybe people
and nature just don't coexist well," he
said.
