# Social security tax unnecessary
## 
### 
Don't you just hate it when the government sub
tracts \ dollars from your already too small
paycheck, for "social security?"
And paying the payroll tax is especially irksome
when one reflects on where the money is going. For
social security is, by just about anyone's definition
of the word, a "boondoggle."
Social security is an ill-conceived and totally un
justified intrusion of the government into the pri
vate citizen's domain.
The basic philosophical objection to social sec
urity is, why should the government confiscate my
money and put it in "trust" for my later use, when 1
may want to spend that money now? Why should
the government tell me how best to lead my life?
Serious faults
but apart from the philosophical argument
against social security, only just now are the serious
financial faults in the system beginning to be
realized.
Social security was originally designed to pro
vide an income supplement for retired persons.
From this relatively minor role, social security has
proceeded to become the major source of income
for many of today's elderly.
One out of seven Americans now receives a
monthly social security check. Whereas only two
million people collected benefits in 1947, some
30.1 million collect benefits today.
And social security taxes now account for 23.4
per cent of federal tax revenues; that figure was a
mere four per cent in 1947.
Not insurance
Social security is not an insurance systerq, as
many people believe. Insurance systems build up
trust funds consisting of the premiums paid into
the system; by law. a private insurance fund must
hold trust funds enough to meet all its outstanding
obligations.
Social security has only a very minor trust fund
(coming into 1976. this fund held approximately
$45.9 billion, as opposed to nearly a trillion dollars
in projected obligations).
In reality, social security is a transfer of wealth
from younger workers to those retired or disabled.
The payments of today's workers are used to pay
their elders' social security benefits.
"The benefit system of social security is basically
welfare, pure and simple," states Roger Miller in
Harper's Magazine. "Those now employed transfer
income to those who are unemployed."

And the benefits a person on social security re
ceives in no way are related to what he paid into the
system in taxes. Miller points out that present-day
recipients receive from two-to-four times what they
paid in taxes.
Disparity
This disparity between taxes and benefits re
ceived is further illustrated by the fact that one

receives a constant level of benefits whether he
worked the minimum or more than the minimum of
quarters required.
Benefits are more closely related to the marital
status and number of children in one's family than
to the sum paid in taxes.
Social security can thus be compared to a giant
chain-letter: the system works just fine as long as
almost all continue to play. Hut what happens
when young workers begin to protest — and even
refuse to pay — these welfare payments?
Mass revolt against social security's hegemony
over a substantial part of workers' wages is a dis
tinct and mounting possibility. And the likelihood
of this revolt increases everyday, for the social sec
urity system is faced with two crippling problems.
First, the benefit level has been tied to the Con
sumer Price Index (CPI), providing for automatic
increases in the benefit level as the CPI increases.
Likewise, the wage level on which one pays social
security taxes (currently, the employe pays 5.85 per
cent on income under $15,000, with the employer
contributing a matching amount) increases with
inflation.
Hut what happens when inflation outstrips the
growth in wages?
Fewer affected
A boost in the wage base from $ 15,000 to $17,000,
for example, only produces income from those
making over $15,000 and none from workers mak
ing less. Since wages are increasing much less
rapidly than inflation, the number of workers af

fected by the increase in the wage base is decreas
ing.
The social security system can't raise enough
funds to cover its rising benefits. This year, benefits
will be three-to-four billion dollars larger than tax
revenues — the difference will have to come from
the system's $45.9 billion trust fund.
However, that fund can only sustain deficits for a
short period of time.
The system will be in the red by 1980, states
Robert Gray in his article "Will the Social Security
Hubble Burst?" And this will occur, states Gray,
despite two planned increases in the payroll tax
rate.
The second bugaboo threatening the system is
the decline in the birth rate.
The birth rate is now at 1.9 children per family —
below replacement level. The Senate Finance
Committee estimates that over the long term, the
birth rate will hoveraround 2.1, just enough to keep
a constant population.
Baby-boom
1 lowever, this work force is going to have to pro
vide benefits to the baby-boom generation. Fewer
and fewer workers will have to shoulder the bur
den.
The ratio of workers to beneficiaries is now about
three-to-one. By the turn of the century, Gray pre
dicts. this figure to be two-to-one.
Only by an immense increase in social security
taxes could the system meet the projected benefit
levels.
Something has to be done. Benefits must be
trimmed, taxes must skyrocket, or another source of
funds must be located if the system is to keep func
tioning in today's capacity. None of these alterna
tives seem very palatable.
A better solution is to try to phase out the system
entirely-
Social security, as it stands now, is merely a per
verse welfare system. Even if welfare is the in
tended goal, there is no reason for the government
to be doling out payments to all our elderly.
Steps should be taken to end the government's
role in a matter it should never have delved into.
Grandiose schemes for social engineering are un
workable, besides being philosophically untena
ble.
