# Letters: Bolivia, bonfire pollution
## 
### 
Bolivian jungles
As both a reader of the Daily and a
Stanford student, I want to congratu
late your newspaper (and the Stanford
Ceography Department and the As
sociated Press as well?) for your re
markable demonstrations of geog
raphic knowledge.
In the Nov. 8 issue, you published an
article on page 3 about an ancient
civilization found in the Brazilian
jungle hills that actually was found in
the Bolivian'jungles, only 45 miles
from La Paz. according to the article.
Never mind, you are probably still
tired from covering theelections, and I
forgive you for this misunderstanding.
What upsets me is that Stanford is
supposed to be one of the best univer
sities in the States, and if the students
here make this type of confusion (?),
what about the rest of Americans who
can not reach these "outstanding"
schools?
But maybe some departments, with
the help of a computer calculation, ar
rived at the conclusion that Bolivia
should be annexed to Brazil (or vice
versa) to solve both countries' prob
lems. '
Oh, well. It's not your fault that's the
way it is taught here.

Bonfire pollution
Stanford's Fall Pollution Festival,
otherwise known as the Big Game Bon
fire. will be held again on the surface of
the dry lakebed in the evening of Nov.
19. 1976. This smoggv spectacle is or
ganized each year by the Inter-
Fraternity Council with the approval
of the Stanford administration. Each of

these bonfires dumps over eight
thousand pounds of air pollutants into
our already over-burdened air supply.
If you would like to see these fires
abolished onceand forall. please write
to the Hoard of Directors. Bay Area Air
Pollution Control District (BAAPCD),
939 Ellis Street, San Francisco, Calif.,
94109 and ask them to place strict limi
tations on the size of "recreational"
fires under their jurisdiction (Regula
tion 1. Section3ool). Present BAAPCD
rules place no limits on the size of re
creational and cooking fires, except by
requiring the county fire marshal's ap

proval.

In the Doily of Nov. 8. Jack Christ
iansen is quoted as follows: "It didn't
surprise me that they passed at 41-
10. . . Of course I guess if you have a
chance to be No. 1 in the country, you
stomp on the little people."
Aside from the obvious lack of re
spect for his own team — "little
people," —quote also shows our

coach's weak understanding of the
game of football. When a team has a
41-10 lead, they can do anything they
damn well please. However, when a
team has a 10 point lead to protect with
one quarter to go and the ball on their
own 20 yard line, then they should not
pass!
As you will recall, that very same
situation faced our coach in the recent
UCLA-Stanford fiasco, and the result
ing interception turned the game
around. ,

In the Doily of Nov. 8. Jack Christ
iansen is quoted as follows: "It didn't
surprise me that they passed at 41-
10. . . Of course I guess if you have a
chance to be No. 1 in the country, you
stomp on the little people."
Aside from the obvious lack of re
spect for his own team — "little
people," —quote also shows our

coach's weak understanding of the
game of football. When a team has a
41-10 lead, they can do anything they
damn well please. However, when a
team has a 10 point lead to protect with
one quarter to go and the ball on their
own 20 yard line, then they should not
pass!
As you will recall, that very same
situation faced our coach in the recent
UCLA-Stanford fiasco, and the result
ing interception turned the game
around. ,

As both a reader of the Daily and a
Stanford student, I want to congratu
late your newspaper (and the Stanford
Ceography Department and the As
sociated Press as well?) for your re
markable demonstrations of geog
raphic knowledge.
In the Nov. 8 issue, you published an
article on page 3 about an ancient
civilization found in the Brazilian
jungle hills that actually was found in
the Bolivian'jungles, only 45 miles
from La Paz. according to the article.
Never mind, you are probably still
tired from covering theelections, and I
forgive you for this misunderstanding.
What upsets me is that Stanford is
supposed to be one of the best univer
sities in the States, and if the students
here make this type of confusion (?),
what about the rest of Americans who
can not reach these "outstanding"
schools?
But maybe some departments, with
the help of a computer calculation, ar
rived at the conclusion that Bolivia
should be annexed to Brazil (or vice
versa) to solve both countries' prob
lems. '
Oh, well. It's not your fault that's the
way it is taught here.

Bonfire pollution
Stanford's Fall Pollution Festival,
otherwise known as the Big Game Bon
fire. will be held again on the surface of
the dry lakebed in the evening of Nov.
19. 1976. This smoggv spectacle is or
ganized each year by the Inter-
Fraternity Council with the approval
of the Stanford administration. Each of

these bonfires dumps over eight
thousand pounds of air pollutants into
our already over-burdened air supply.
If you would like to see these fires
abolished onceand forall. please write
to the Hoard of Directors. Bay Area Air
Pollution Control District (BAAPCD),
939 Ellis Street, San Francisco, Calif.,
94109 and ask them to place strict limi
tations on the size of "recreational"
fires under their jurisdiction (Regula
tion 1. Section3ool). Present BAAPCD
rules place no limits on the size of re
creational and cooking fires, except by
