# Rhodesia's alternatives
## 
### 
The Washington Post

It's commonly said that the alterna
tive to negotiated majority rule in
Rhodesia is, in turn, white collapse
and black civil war. That sequence,
producing a wasted land, would he
had enough, although a case can he
made that 1) the whites of Rhodesia
long ago forfeited their claim for a
happier outcome and 2) that the blacks
of Zimbabwe are as entitled as anyone
else to have a bash at each other — after
all. we Americans did.
But there could be an even grimmer
alternative. South Africa, hearing a
Rhodesian SOS. perhaps seeing
whites die on home television screens,
might respond in force, half out of feel
ing for white kin and half out of the
calculation that the coming racial war
had best be fought .it .1 time and place
of Pretoria's own choosing.
Crazv? Perhaps. Hut not out of the

question. The Cubans, of course,
would surely come in. One hesitates to
finish writing out the likely scenarios.
They're all appalling.
Contemplation of those stark
choices would, we believe, substan
tially improve the prospects for ag
reement between the white Rhode
sia ns and the black nationalists now
negotiating under British auspices in
Geneva.
It took a minor miracle to get the
parties into the same hall in Geneva.
Lan Smith is clinging to what he.and
he alone, imagines is an American life
preserver. The nationalists are jockey
ing for position against each other;
whether any of them controls the guer
rillas. who are increasingly active, is
doubtful. The British profess to see a
ulimmer of liuht but others see onlv a

great gap on the key question of how
and when the transition to majority
rule will he made.
So great is the gap, in fact, that the
United States seems to he trying to
push Britain into accepting a more di
rect and even a physical role on the
ground to hring the transition off.
Preoccupied —to put it mildly— at
home, the British are understandably
wary. Yet the estrangement created by
black distrust of white intentions, and
white fear of black reprisal, is so over
whelming that something just that dif
ficult may have to be attempted. As we
say. the alternatives — not only civil
war but foreign involvement —areap-
I tailing.
