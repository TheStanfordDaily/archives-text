The High Temperature Gas
Thermodynamics Laboratory
here has received a grant from
the U.S. Energy Research and
Development Administration
(ERDA) for $3.4 million to inves
tigate the physics involved in
the generation of electricity
through a process involving the
principles of magnetohyd
rodynamics.
Magnetohydrodynamics
(MUD) involves the augmenta
tion of power plant output by
passing plasma (hot ionized
gases) through a tube of insula
tion material (such as mag
nesium oxide) studded with
collector-electrodes made of a

conducting material (such as
stainless steel), while a powerful
magnetic field separates the
positive and negative charged
ions to opposite sides of the tun
nel.
"Our mission." said Professor
Robert Eustis. director of the
High Temperature Gas Ther
modynamics Laboratory (HTGL)
and the research project's prin
cipal investigator, "is to investi
gate what's going on inside the
channel in these high magnetic
fields that will be necessary for
the eventual operation of the
power plants."
MUD generating plants,
which include standard steam
generating turbines which also

use the hot gases to produce
electricity, have, according to
Eustis, 50 to 55 per cent effi
ciency in transforming the
energy contained in the fuel into
electrical energy. Standard fossil
fuel-fired generating plants are
about 37 per cent efficient, he
said, and this means that MHD
plants are about one-third more
efficient.
The high efficiency has the
double advantage, according to
Eustis, of requiring less fuel to
generate a given amount of elec
tricity and of producing less heat
to disperse into the environ
ment.
About $750,000 of the grant
will be used to renovate building

570, where the superconducting
electromagnet to be used in the
research will reside. The elec
tromagnet, which is in the shape
of a cube with edges 20 feet long
(including its shielding) is being
provided by the federal govern
ment and will be built at the Na
t ional Magnet Laboratory in Bos
ton, where it is now in design
stage. The electromagnet will
weigh 500 tons, said Eustis, and
will be worth around $2 million.
The electromagnet consists of
strands of niobium and titanium
alloys running through copper
wound in coils and surrounded
by supercooled helium at 4 de
grees k. (slightly above absolute
zero). At this extremely low
temperature, the metals become
almost perfect conductors of
electricity, and it thereby be
comes possible to generate
magnetic fields of over 30,000
gauss, or 3 tesla. The elec
tromagnet that will be used here
will be capable of generating
fields of up to 7 tesla, or 70,000
gauss.
Eustis said that two-thirds of
the remaining funds (or about $2
million ) will go for salaries to
support graduate students,
technicians, research associates,
and to pay part of the faculty
salaries of individuals involved
in the research project. The re
maining funds, he said, will go
for equipment and instrumenta
tion.
Areas to investigate
"People do not yet know,"
said Eustis, "everything that
must be known about the stabil
ity of the plasma involved in
high magnetic fields in order to
build the MHD systems of the
future."
Three specific areas of inves
tigation, according to Eustis,
will be 1) the tendency of a dif
fuse ionized current to break
down into discrete arcs 2) the
Hall effect, wherein concentra
tions of current develop in
S-shaped patterns within the
tunnel and 3) breakdowns in the
ionized flow caused by sparking
between the electrodes which
could burn through the insula
ton and cause structural damage
to the MHD channel.
Eustis minimized the possibil
ity of danger involved with the
MHD system.

Magnetohydrodynamics
(MUD) involves the augmenta
tion of power plant output by
passing plasma (hot ionized
gases) through a tube of insula
tion material (such as mag
nesium oxide) studded with
collector-electrodes made of a

conducting material (such as
stainless steel), while a powerful
magnetic field separates the
positive and negative charged
ions to opposite sides of the tun
nel.
"Our mission." said Professor
Robert Eustis. director of the
High Temperature Gas Ther
modynamics Laboratory (HTGL)
and the research project's prin
cipal investigator, "is to investi
gate what's going on inside the
channel in these high magnetic
fields that will be necessary for
the eventual operation of the
power plants."
MUD generating plants,
which include standard steam
generating turbines which also

use the hot gases to produce
electricity, have, according to
Eustis, 50 to 55 per cent effi
ciency in transforming the
energy contained in the fuel into
electrical energy. Standard fossil
fuel-fired generating plants are
about 37 per cent efficient, he
said, and this means that MHD
plants are about one-third more
efficient.
The high efficiency has the
double advantage, according to
Eustis, of requiring less fuel to
generate a given amount of elec
tricity and of producing less heat
to disperse into the environ
ment.
About $750,000 of the grant
will be used to renovate building

570, where the superconducting
electromagnet to be used in the
research will reside. The elec
tromagnet, which is in the shape
of a cube with edges 20 feet long
(including its shielding) is being
provided by the federal govern
ment and will be built at the Na
t ional Magnet Laboratory in Bos
ton, where it is now in design
stage. The electromagnet will
weigh 500 tons, said Eustis, and
will be worth around $2 million.
The electromagnet consists of
strands of niobium and titanium
alloys running through copper
wound in coils and surrounded
by supercooled helium at 4 de
grees k. (slightly above absolute
zero). At this extremely low
temperature, the metals become
almost perfect conductors of
electricity, and it thereby be
comes possible to generate
magnetic fields of over 30,000
gauss, or 3 tesla. The elec
tromagnet that will be used here
will be capable of generating
fields of up to 7 tesla, or 70,000
gauss.
Eustis said that two-thirds of
the remaining funds (or about $2
million ) will go for salaries to
support graduate students,
technicians, research associates,
and to pay part of the faculty
salaries of individuals involved
in the research project. The re
maining funds, he said, will go
for equipment and instrumenta
tion.
Areas to investigate
"People do not yet know,"
said Eustis, "everything that
must be known about the stabil
ity of the plasma involved in
high magnetic fields in order to
build the MHD systems of the
future."
Three specific areas of inves
tigation, according to Eustis,
will be 1) the tendency of a dif
fuse ionized current to break
down into discrete arcs 2) the
Hall effect, wherein concentra
tions of current develop in
S-shaped patterns within the
tunnel and 3) breakdowns in the
ionized flow caused by sparking
between the electrodes which
could burn through the insula
ton and cause structural damage
to the MHD channel.
Eustis minimized the possibil
ity of danger involved with the
MHD system.
