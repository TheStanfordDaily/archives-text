"I can't imagine any conflicts of interest." Dean
of Admissions Fred Hargadon said concerning his
recent election to the post of vice-chairman for the
College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB)
board of trustees.
Elected for a two-year term, Hargadon will
serve on the executive committee, which handles
business affairs for the board of trustees. Vice
chairman Hargadon, along with the acting chair
man, will be responsible for leading both the
executive committee and the hoard of trustees of
the CEEB.
Approximately 20 men and women are cur
rently serving four-year terms as trustees for the
CEEB, according to Hargadon. The trustees are
primarily responsible for approving expenditures
and overseeing major policy decisions for the or
ganization.
Explaining the election process. Hargadon said
that officers and trustees are elected at an annual
meeting of the CEEB. To insure better constituent

representation some trustees are elected on a na
tional basis while others are elected on a regional
one.
"The College Board CEEB is far more represen
tative than it used to be," Hargadon said. About
2300 colleges, schools, school systems and as
sociations are presently included in the CEEB.
TheCEEB hoard of trustees represents nationwide
secondary and higher educational institutions.
Emphasizing the various functions of the CEEB,
Hargadon said that the "College Board is more
than what most students think it is." In addition to
the administration of such entrance examinations
as the Scholastic Aptitude Test, theCollege Board
is responsible for the College Scholarship Service,
the Advanced Placement Program and Student
Search Service.
"I look, forward to serving as vice-chairman.
The next few years will be significant ones for the
College Board because of its research into alter
nate methods of assessment and into viable alter
natives to federal domination of financial needs
analysis," he concluded.
