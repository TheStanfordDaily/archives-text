# Tsunami threat minimal

Berkeley (AP) â€” The Califor
nia coast may be spared the
havoc of massive tidal waves be
cause the San Andreas fault slips
from side to side instead of up
and down, a researcher said
yesterday.
Robert VViegel, professor of
civil engineering at the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley,
said scientists now believe that
"only certain kinds of earth
movements cause significant
tsunamis."
He said the movement has to
be vertical rather than horizon
tal. The San Andreas fault,
which runs through California,
doesn't produce tsunamis be
cause it siips sideways. VViegel
said.
He said about the worst
California can expect from
tsunamis was shown by the 1964
tidal wave that hit Crescent Citv.

That wave, set off by the great
Alaskan earthquake, caused
more than a dozen deaths along
the coast, destroyed 200 homes
and businesses and sent cars
floating down the streets.
VViegel said the combination
of factors that set off that wave
"could happen again, but we
wouldn't expect the wave to be
much worse and we would hope
to lie much more ready for it."
He explained that tsunamis,
the commonly used Japanese
term for seismic or tidal waves,
are only one or two feet high and
50 miles apart. They travel ac
ross the sea at about 400 miles an
hour, and their force is felt only
when they pile up at the
coastline.
Certain harbors "resonate,"
VViegel said. They focus the
power of the waves to make them
stronger and more destructive.

Crescent City is a harbor that re
sonates. he said, while San Fran
cisco Bay does not.
VViegel said that until scien
tists starting studying plate tec
tonics. the ways in which vari
ous sections of the earth's crust
move in relation to each other,
they based tsunami warnings
solely on the magnitude of un
derwater earthquakes.
