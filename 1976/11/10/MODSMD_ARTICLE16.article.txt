# Not a 'run-of-the-mill' bear
## Smokey the Bear, 70, dies 
### 
Washington (AP) — The orig
inal Smokey Bear,a symbol of
forest fire prevention for 25
years, died yesterday at the Na
tional Zoo of infirmities and old
age.
His age was the equivalent of
70 years in human terms.
As provided hv Congress,
Smokey's remains were being
shipped yesterday back to his
original forest home in New
Mexico. He will be buried at
Smokey Hear Historical State
Park near Capitan, N.M., within
sight ofCapitan Mountain where
he was found in 1950.
Officials said a short burial
ceremony is being planned by
the New Mexico State Park
Commission.
In 1974, with the bear suffer
ing from arthritis and other ail
ments. Congress approved a re
solution authorizing Smokey
upon death to be returned to
New Mexico "for proper disposi
tion and a permanent memo
rial."
'Great honey tree in sky'
One version of the resolution
as it was considered in theHouse
referred to Smokey one day pas
sing on to a "great honey tree in

the sky." But this was consi
dered a bit irreverent for such a
noble creature and the honey
tree line was omitted in the final
version.
Smokey officially retired as
the nation's forest fire preven
tion symbol in May 1975 and
was replaced by another bear,
now called Smokey.
But for 25 years after he was
found as a badly burned cub after
a fire in New Mexico's Lincoln
National Forest, the old Smokey
was top bear for a generation of

children and adults who came to
recognize his familiar hat and
bulky figure as the symbol of fire
prevention.
Executive zoo type
Smokey was a prime attraction
at the National Zoo but was not
the run-of-the-mill bear. His
keeper said Smokey was more of
an executive type and was not a
bear to beg for tidbits and food
from tourists.
As a cub. Smokey was rescued
by firefighters in 1950 as the se
verely burned animal clung to a
charred tree. After treatment and
recovery, Smokey was flown to
Washington, D.C. and in June
1950 was officially designated as
a living symbol of forest fire pre
vention.
In 1962. a young female
named Goldie was provided
Smokey in hopes they would
produce an offspring and bear
heir.
But Smokey and Goldie, now a
bear age of 15, maintained a cool
relationship so in 1971 another
cub from New Mexico was
selected as their foster offspring.
It was this bear, now about 6,
which became the new Smokey
last year.

Washington (AP) — The orig
inal Smokey Bear,a symbol of
forest fire prevention for 25
years, died yesterday at the Na
tional Zoo of infirmities and old
age.
His age was the equivalent of
70 years in human terms.
As provided hv Congress,
Smokey's remains were being
shipped yesterday back to his
original forest home in New
Mexico. He will be buried at
Smokey Hear Historical State
Park near Capitan, N.M., within
sight ofCapitan Mountain where
he was found in 1950.
Officials said a short burial
ceremony is being planned by
the New Mexico State Park
Commission.
In 1974, with the bear suffer
ing from arthritis and other ail
ments. Congress approved a re
solution authorizing Smokey
upon death to be returned to
New Mexico "for proper disposi
tion and a permanent memo
rial."
'Great honey tree in sky'
One version of the resolution
as it was considered in theHouse
referred to Smokey one day pas
sing on to a "great honey tree in

the sky." But this was consi
dered a bit irreverent for such a
noble creature and the honey
tree line was omitted in the final
version.
Smokey officially retired as
the nation's forest fire preven
tion symbol in May 1975 and
was replaced by another bear,
now called Smokey.
But for 25 years after he was
found as a badly burned cub after
a fire in New Mexico's Lincoln
National Forest, the old Smokey
was top bear for a generation of

children and adults who came to
recognize his familiar hat and
bulky figure as the symbol of fire
prevention.
Executive zoo type
Smokey was a prime attraction
at the National Zoo but was not
the run-of-the-mill bear. His
keeper said Smokey was more of
an executive type and was not a
bear to beg for tidbits and food
from tourists.
As a cub. Smokey was rescued
by firefighters in 1950 as the se
verely burned animal clung to a
charred tree. After treatment and
recovery, Smokey was flown to
Washington, D.C. and in June
1950 was officially designated as
a living symbol of forest fire pre
vention.
In 1962. a young female
named Goldie was provided
Smokey in hopes they would
produce an offspring and bear
heir.
But Smokey and Goldie, now a
bear age of 15, maintained a cool
relationship so in 1971 another
cub from New Mexico was
selected as their foster offspring.
It was this bear, now about 6,
which became the new Smokey
last year.
