# Mayors contemplate Cabinet posts
## 
### 
Washington (AF) â€” The names of
several big city mayors are being tos
sed around President-elect Jimmy Car
tor's camp, prompting speculation that
for the first time in 14 years one of
them may be named to a Cabinet post.
Mayors Moon Landrieu of New Or
leans and Kenneth Cibson of Newark,
N.J., are among those most often men
tioned. Henry Maier of Milwaukee is
another name in the hat. One of them
could be named secretary of housing
and urban development, health, edu
cation and welfare, transportation, or
perhaps a Cabinet-level job at the
White House.
Others mentioned, but thought to
have lesser prospects, include De
troit's Coleman Young, Atlanta's
Maynard Jackson. Los Angeles' Tom
Bradley and Harvey Sloane of Louis
ville.
The mayors as a group are actively

seeking Carter's attention, as evi
denced by their emergency meeting of
the U.S. Conference of Mayors in
Chicago this week. But individually,
that would be bad form and might well
eliminate one from consideration,
on matters of urban policy, was absent.
There was speculation in Chicago
that Maier had stayed away because he
hoped for a Cabinet job and didn't
want to appear to be pressuring Carter
on policy questions in this critical
period. The mayor officially was on
vacation.
Meantime, city council members are
already discussing succession.
Landrieu flew to Washington from
the meeting. To talk with Carter's
transition people? No, said an aide. He
attended a symposium and had no
plans to visit the Carter office. Nor had
he been contacted, the aide said.
Mayor Neil Goldschmidt of Port

land, Ore., was reported by a news
paper as high on Carter's roster of
prospects. He reacted as if he had been
named to the FBl's most-wanted list.
"I don't know a thing about it,"
Goldschmidt said. "I've had no contact
with anyone on Carter's staff. I've
never met any of the people who are on
his staff. As far as I know, they have no
idea who I am."
Maier, a regular at mayors' confer
ences and the group's chief strategist
Carter has often spoken of bringing
new talent into the federal govern
ment, and observers suggest
Goldschmidt would fit that category.
It is unclear whether the President
elect has been given any mayors'
names to consider or whether they aro
simply being floated by supporters in
side the Carter camp.
Carter's press secretary said the

president-elect is likely to make his
first choices for White House staff
within a week, setting up a "spokes of
a wheel" system in which a number of
aides have equal access to the presi
dent.
Jody Powell told reporters the
equal-access approach results in more
information coming to the chief execu
tive and also generates "increased
competition among staff members,
which keeps us all on our toes."
