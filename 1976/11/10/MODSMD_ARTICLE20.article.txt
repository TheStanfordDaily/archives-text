# Frontier lifestyle altered by ferry route in Alaska

Pelican. Aiasku (AP) â€”
Another slice of frontier life in
Alaska vanished forever in the
predawn darkness yesterday.
The gleaming state-run ferry
LeConte linked up this fishing
village deep in the misty Ale
xander Archipelago with main
land civilization.
For some, the 200-mile round
trip maiden voyage of the
LeConte from Juneau on Alas
ka's southeast coast to Pelican on
Chicago Island was a cause for
celebration.
"You can't stop progress, even
in Pelican," beamed Big Rosey,
the hefty saloon-keeper, ad hoc
banker and mother figure to the
200-odd men, women and chil
dren who make their home in

this 40-year-old cannery town.
"We've got it made now."
For others, however, the first
of the once-a-month appearance
by the 250-passenger auto ferry
represented the untimely end to
a disappearing lifestyle.
"That ferry is the ugliest thing
I've ever seen come in here."
glowered Pelican's 25-year-old
mayor, Bruce Anderson, as the
FeConte tied up to the town's
new $360,000 dock. "A lot of
people like myself came here to
escape from civilization, but a
majority of the people want it."
The majority prevailed be
cause of the unquestionable
need for low-cost transportation
and freight service to the town

where previously all supplies
must come in by barge and all
passengers by air.
Before the ferry. Pelican resi
dents had to pay up to $l(i() to
charter a plane to or from Juneau.
And it cost Rosey nearly $100 a
case to ship in beer.
In contrast, a passenger ticket
on the LeConte, the smallest of
six state ferries which ply bet
ween a dozen towns on Alaska's
Inland Passage, is $12 one-way.
The bill for the first freight load
out of Pelican, a big fork lift
bound for Seattle for repairs, was
less than $300.
Bella Hammond, the wife of
Gov. lay Hammond, headed a
party of dignitaries among the 70
or so passengers who made the
inaugural 16-hour round trip
voyage, which was marred by an
outbreak of sea sickness as the
LeConte rolled through 12-foot
seas while steaming near an
open passage to the stormy Gulf
of Alaska.
"Everything would have been
okay 1 think if I hadn't eaten the
poached salmon for lunch." said
one female passenger as she
emerged pale and shaken from a
crowded restroom.
Sharing the limelight with
Mrs. Hammond's official party
was an unofficial delegation ot
Juneau bar owners and their
friends, who spend the entire
round trip ensconced in the
LeConte's lounge.
"We may not break even in
fares to and from Pelican, but
we'll probably make up for any
losses in the bar," said one
LeConte crew member.
