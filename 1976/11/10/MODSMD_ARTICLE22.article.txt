# The 						post-election blues
## McCarthy continues battle 
### Kyra Subbotin 
Washington -Independent
presidential candidate Eugene
McCarthy openly attacked the
two-party system and the "un
constitutionality of election pro
cedures" in a post-election press
conference here Friday.
The 60-year-old former
senator focused on the legal is
sues raised by his campaign,
claiming that tin; equal timedoc
trine "means nothing" and that
the electoral college system
"clearly violates one-man, one
vote."
"Independents have no rep
resentation," McCarthy said,
"...but 40 per cent of the people
are independents. A third-party
candidate should have some ef
fect on an election."
McCarthy had lobbied for
equal television time for inde
pendent candidates. He called

the League of Women Voters
which sponsored the three pres
idential debates a "mother god
dess", and CBS, ABC, and NBC
were the "subgods" who deter
mined who would get coveted
air time.
Debates helped others
McCarthy claimed that the de
bates helped the other candi
dates and gave them an unfair
advantage over independent and
third-party challengers.
"This election represented the
greatest effort to keep someone
off the ballot in the history of
American politics," he said. De
spite numerous legal battles,
some of which are still pending,
McCarthy made the ballot in 29
states.
In California, McCarthy sup
porters needed to collect 99,000
signatures to place their candi
date on the ballot. State election

officials were five weeks late in
providing the necessary peti
tions and McCarthyites gathered
only 85,000 signatures by the
Sept. 3 deadline.
Because the delay was caused

by the state. McCarthy's commit
tee filed for additional time, but
he was denied access to the bal
lot by the California Supreme
Court. He was thus torced to run
as a write-in candidate.
