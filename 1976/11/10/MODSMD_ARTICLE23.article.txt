# Foreign oil use to continue

San Francisco (AP) — Domestic production of
America's energy needs has been on the decline
since 1970 and reliance on foreign reserves is
expected to continue for years to come, a top oil
executive said yesterday.
Maurice F. Granville, board chairman of
Texaco, told the annual meeting of the American
Petroleum Institute that foreign countries supply
40 per cent of the U.S.'s oil needs.
"There is no realistic alternative to our con
tinued heavy reliance on imported petroleum for
many years to come," he said, "Although the ex
tent of this reliance will depend on our success, or

our lack of success, in developing domestic
energy supplies."
Granville said the administration of President
elect Jimmy Carter should support 'a greatly ex
panded effort to produce petroleum within our
own borders, including our offshore areas."
He said the drop in domestic oil production
"must he arrested and, if possible, reversed."
Granville called for greater development of coal
resources and nuclear energy projects. Nuclear
power, he suggested, "should he encouraged, not
stalled as it has been."
