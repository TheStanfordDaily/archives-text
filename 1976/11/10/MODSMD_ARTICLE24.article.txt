# Physicians advise ban on use of amphetamines
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Five
physicians recommended yes
terday that the government ban
the use of amphetamines and
similar drugs as weight-loss aids
on the grounds they are unsafe
and ineffective.
Three of the five told a Senate
panel that abuse of am
phetamines — generally known
as uppers or pep pills — is so
widespread that the drug should
be prohibited altogether, even
though they are used to treat
overactive children and nar
colepsy.
The doctors cited research in
dicating amphetamines also
may be responsible for birth de
fects.
Dr. James j. Nora, professor of
pediatrics at the University of

Colorado Medical Center, com
pared questions about am
phetamines with those raised
about birth control pills.
"The point is," he said, "the
world needs 'the pill' or some
agent that can perform its func
tion equally well. I am unable to
identify a similar need for am
phetamines and related drugs."
No question
Dr. Lester Crinspoon, as
sociate professor of psychiatry at
Harvard Medical School added:
"There is no question that there
is far more harmfulness from the
use of amphetamines than be
nefits."
Dr. Thomas E. Prout, associate
professor of medicine at Johns
Hopkins University, agreed that
amphetamines and their cousins
should be banned for weight loss
but said all-out efforts to control
the drugs should be made before
they are removed from the mar
ket.
The physicians testified be
fore the Senate small business
subcommittee on monopoly,
whose chairman, Sen. Caylord
Nelson, D-Wis., advocated an
outright ban on amphetamines.
Ban advised
Two doctors, Allen S.
Coldman and Sumner J. Yasse,
both of the Children's Hospital
of Philadelphia, said the drug
should be banned for treatment
of obesity; Yasse said under

questioning that it should be
banned for all uses, if necessary.
Other experts will testify at
later hearings.
Nelson noted that 25 million
prescriptions were written last
year for amphetamines and simi
lar drugs, such as lonamin and
Tenuate. Virtually all were pre
scribed for weight loss.
Early weight loss
Grinspoon said the vast major
ity of studies on the use of am
phetamines and similar drugs by
fat persons show some slight
early weight loss occurs.
"This judgment must be qual
ified, however, because excel
lent results are obtained in the
early stages of almost all types of
treatment because of the initial
willingness of subjects to coop
erate with a new physician and
the psychological impact of a
new therapy," Crinspoon said.
Hut even when the weight loss
figures are viewed in the best
light, he added, there are
hazards.
"People who have problems
controlling their need for con
stant gratification, as indicated
by compulsive eating, find it
hard to put aside a medication
that makes them 'feel good',"
Crinspoon said.

whose chairman, Sen. Caylord
Nelson, D-Wis., advocated an
outright ban on amphetamines.
Ban advised
Two doctors, Allen S.
Coldman and Sumner J. Yasse,
both of the Children's Hospital
of Philadelphia, said the drug
should be banned for treatment
of obesity; Yasse said under

questioning that it should be
banned for all uses, if necessary.
Other experts will testify at
later hearings.
Nelson noted that 25 million
prescriptions were written last
year for amphetamines and simi
lar drugs, such as lonamin and
Tenuate. Virtually all were pre
scribed for weight loss.
Early weight loss
Grinspoon said the vast major
ity of studies on the use of am
phetamines and similar drugs by
fat persons show some slight
early weight loss occurs.
"This judgment must be qual
ified, however, because excel
lent results are obtained in the
early stages of almost all types of
treatment because of the initial
willingness of subjects to coop
erate with a new physician and
the psychological impact of a
new therapy," Crinspoon said.
Hut even when the weight loss
figures are viewed in the best
light, he added, there are
hazards.
"People who have problems
controlling their need for con
stant gratification, as indicated
by compulsive eating, find it
hard to put aside a medication
that makes them 'feel good',"
Crinspoon said.
Washington (AP) — Five
physicians recommended yes
terday that the government ban
the use of amphetamines and
similar drugs as weight-loss aids
on the grounds they are unsafe
and ineffective.
Three of the five told a Senate
panel that abuse of am
phetamines — generally known
as uppers or pep pills — is so
widespread that the drug should
be prohibited altogether, even
though they are used to treat
overactive children and nar
colepsy.
The doctors cited research in
dicating amphetamines also
may be responsible for birth de
fects.
Dr. James j. Nora, professor of
pediatrics at the University of

Colorado Medical Center, com
pared questions about am
phetamines with those raised
about birth control pills.
"The point is," he said, "the
world needs 'the pill' or some
agent that can perform its func
tion equally well. I am unable to
identify a similar need for am
phetamines and related drugs."
No question
Dr. Lester Crinspoon, as
sociate professor of psychiatry at
Harvard Medical School added:
"There is no question that there
is far more harmfulness from the
use of amphetamines than be
nefits."
Dr. Thomas E. Prout, associate
professor of medicine at Johns
Hopkins University, agreed that
amphetamines and their cousins
should be banned for weight loss
but said all-out efforts to control
the drugs should be made before
they are removed from the mar
ket.
The physicians testified be
fore the Senate small business
subcommittee on monopoly,
whose chairman, Sen. Caylord
Nelson, D-Wis., advocated an
outright ban on amphetamines.
