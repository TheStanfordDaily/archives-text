## Cardinal booter a national scoring leader Bob Geiger's 20 goals counters Stanford opponents 
### Dean Eyre 
Spearheading the Stanford attack, Bob
Geiger forms a critical part of the soccer
team's nucleus.
A key element of the Cards' "quick,
running offense," he is one ot the top
scorers in the country with 20 goals this
season.
With only eight returning lettermen
Cieiger plays a leadership role. After
picking.upthegame in high school phys
ical education classes, he played for two
years at McLean (Va.) High School.
A member of the county champion
ship team, he also participated on the
Washington D.G. National Soccer
League All-star squad.
As the senior looked back upon his
soccer career here, he noted that the play
is ;in "order of magnitude greater than in
high school." The competition at this
level sifts out inexperienced athletes and
makes opponents that much tougher, he
noted.
C.eiger luis spent five years in college,
but he's only played soccer here for four
years. He spent a year at Stanford-In-
Germanv. He called his exposure to
European soccer "a valuable experi
ence."
Cieiger noted that although European
i nd American athletes are equal in phys
ical strength, the Europeans have "their
skills more developed."
I »Mruing at an early age to "get the feel
i<il Mf ball," they have the opportunity to

"become a Pele." Americans, being ex
posed to the game almost exclusively in
high school or college (until the recent
growth of youth leagues) can become
good players but lack the background to
be super, he noted.
In summing up Stanford's past teams,
Geiger mentioned that the year he came
in (1972) there was "an extremely
talented class of soccer players." But he
said that there were many "dissident
personalities."
This is Geiger's first year under a new
head coach. He felt respect for former
coach Fred Priddle, but also saw the need
for change. Geiger remarked that tirst
year coach Nelson Lodge is "a great addi
tion" to the university staff, "especially
since he studies the sport, a rarity for
Americans."
One of the disadvantages with being a
leading scorer is that the reputation pre
cedes the player. The result in Geiger's
case is that defenses key on him. He re
plied that such tactics "sometimes gets
discouraging," but often depends on
how his teammates are playing.
When the whole group is working well
together, the pressure can be taken off of
Geiger. In describing his treatment by
such defenses, he said that opponents
can get rough. There is a "certain art of
'hacking,' " and while the opponents
"don't try to injure," they are rough
enough so that "you are not confident."
Like most athletes, Geiger feels the time

pressures put upon him by soccer. He is
working for two degrees — electrical en
gineering and German, and the sport
"takes a lot ot time." Elaborating, he said
that it isn't just a matter ol time, but it is
psychological too, because "you don't
feel like studying" before and after a
game.
Geiger's near future will center around
a naval nuclear submarine program, put
ting his engineering to good use for up to
four years.
He indicated that he wants to "con
tinue playing as long as I can." However,
he felt that it was difficult to consider a
national team possibility because "I
don't know if I could make a team like
that." Rather than aim for the center for
ward position, he said that he would
probably "try out as right wing."
Speculating on the future of soccer,
Geiger mentioned that it is "obvious
looking at the younger kids' level," that
within ten to fifteen years soccer will be a
major sport in the United States.
If given an opportunity, soccer will be
"definitely catching on. The sport still
is not a beautiful sport in America," but
in time it will display the style seen in
Europe where soccer combines "the
grace of gymnastics with the ferocity of
football."

The Stanford soccer team hosts Santa
Glara today at 3 p.m. on Harry Maloney
Field.
