# Incomparables outduel Trojan band
## USC 'ruhhar' band falls short 
### John Freed 
It's a scorching California
Saturday and 70,000 fans are
watching. Would you rather be
wearing:
—a hot, heavy uniform with
headgear resembling an inverted
red Fuller brush atop a football
helmet, or
—your pajamas?
Most would probably prefer
neither. Of course, the USC
Marching Band wore the former
outfit Saturday, while the In
comparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching
Band (known variously as the
Incomparables or LSJUMB) used
the latter in halftime perfor
mances.
Bedtime
liSC's getup seemed just as
comical to LSJUMB members as
the bedroom attire must have
appeared to Los Angeles' mar
tinets.
Although many Stanford
Band members expressed admi
ration for USC's musical ability,
the Trojans seemed more intent
on form than substance.
During their pregame show,
for example, the "rubber" band
(as the locals lovingly tagged
them) marched on to the field in
Marine Corps-like precision,
cardinal-and-gold flags waved
in the air, and batons sailed
through the sky from the hands
of both male and female twirlers.
Unfortunately, from ground
level it was clear that none of
SC's diagonals lined up straight.
If you're going to be military,
you might as well do it right.
Pep talk
Band manager Kent Blumberg
gave the Incomparables a pep
talk during the first half.

"You guys were great out
there. You're the loudest I ever
heard you. But they were louder.
"I counted 210 of them out
there, and they were a little
louder—maybe three decibels.
So 1 want you to go out there and
blow your balls off," Blumberg
shouted to the assembled mas
ses.
Impartial press box observers
agreed that Stanford outplayed
USC during halftime.
'The Wiz'
The SC halftime show con
sisted of selections from"The
Wiz." Its drum major, dressed as
a scarecrow, provided a bizarre
contrast to the military style of
the rest of the band. But then —
to the amazement of many — the
tuba players appeared to move
somewhat independently, jump
ing up and down and the like.
Some Incomparables marched
out at the fringe of the USC
phalanx and were studiously ig
nored.
Drum major Jim Jett took his
life into his own hands by lying
down on the field and pretend
ing to sleep. According to one of
the USC charts, a tuba player
should have marched on Jett's
stomach during the show. But as
one marcher approached, he
froze in terror, not knowing what
to do; Jett survived.
Heture the locals took the field,
one rubber bandsman asked if he
could march with the Incompar
ables. This was okayed, and the
visitor received the standard in
structions: stand between any
two bandsmen and play as loud
as you can.
Just as the band set up for its
first formation, however, two
USC band managers ran on to the
field and dragged away the hap
less SC player.
USC mentality
It may be hard to understand
such a mentality, but it becomes
easier after spending some time
in the USC student section.
At first glance, it looks a lot
like the Stanford section. The
band is roped off from the rest of

the students; there is not much
interaction. A closer look shows
there is no interaction.
For the Trojans had guards
posted at each end of their sec
tion to keep the rabble out.
Stupid cheers
Trojan yell leaders — in
cardinal-and-gold sweaters de
spite the heat — exhorted the
crowd over loudspeakers with
memorable cheers such as "D-D-
Defense!" Arthur C. Bartner,
USC's director, stood atop a lad
der on the track and kept an eye
on the bandsmen.
The postgame "battle of the

bands" proved a clear victory for
the Incomparable*. First, the
Trojans had no one to play to.
Second, they bad to leave early
to catch a bus. Third, they were
weak.
But hundreds of Stanford par
tisans waited into the darkness
to hear an Incomparable version
of "Yellow River." Jett toyed
with their affections, playing ev
erything except the song they
shouted for.
But, at last, t hey got 1 heir wish,
and for a moment, they could
forget the final tally still glowing
on the scoreboard.
