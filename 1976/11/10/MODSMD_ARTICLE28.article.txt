# Cards' new goal: a winning year
## 
### Chris Baker 
it's hard to believe, but Stan
ford is playing Oregon this
Saturday in Eugene and it hasn't
rained here yet. Except for IJSC's
48-24 drenching of the Cards last
week.
"There's not a lot to say about
last week's game." Stanford
coach Jack Christiansen told the
northern California football
writers yesterday. "SC is one
large extremely good football
team."
Looking ahead to next
weekend's Rose Bowl show
down between the Trojans and
Bruins Christiansen said,
"They're two different types of
teams. UCLA has got size and
quickness. It should be an out
standing game."
New goal
But after striking thornes in
the Race for the Roses last week,
the Cards' goal is to avoid their
first losing season since 1963,
when John Ralston posted a 3-7
mark in his first year on the
Farm.
The Ducks (3-6) are riding a
five-game losing streak and
some Webfoot fans have talked
of riding Oregon head coach Don
Read out of Eugene. UCLA held
the Ducks to minus two yards
rushing in its 46-0 victory over
Oregon last weekend.
The Ducks have been shut out
by USC, Notre Dame and UCLA.
But as Christiansen said, "Ore
gon always plays a good game
against us."
Emotional letdown
The Cards will have to avoid
an emotional letdown after USC.
The Oregon game is sandwiched
between last week's emotional
drain and the already soldout
Big Game next week.
"It's always been a problem
since I've been here," said Chris
tiansen. "It's hard to concen
trate. It's tough after any loss.
"But we'll try to emphasize
that we still have the opportun
ity for a winning season," added
Chris.
Oregon comeback
Last year Stanford jumped out
to a seemingly comfortable 33-3
lead over the Ducks and then had
to hang on, as quarterback Jack
Henderson threw for 283 yards,
to close the score to 33-30. Run
ning back George Bennett scored
three touchdowns against the
Cards.
"We've had a lot of close
games with them recently. It
went down to the wire last year
and they beat us up in Oregon in
1972 (15-13)," said Christiansen.
"Henderson is a very fine
quarterback. He did an outstand
ing job against us last year. Greg
Bauer is an excellent receiver.
He's one of the best in the con
ference, and he's the man they go
to in the clutch," said Chris.
Oregon stats
Henderson has completed 118
of 215 passes fo 1087 yards and
four touchdowns. Bauer has

grabbed 37 passes for 404 yards
and two touchdowns.
Stanford's injury report was
almost as bad as the score of last
Saturday's game. Six offensive
linemen were injured in the USC
contest. Captain Alex karakazoff
is probably out for the remainder
of the season with two cracked
bones (transverse processes) in
his back.
Offensive tackle Bill Hubbard,
who suffered a sprained wrist
last week, will move into
Karakozoff's guard spot.
Correction: Quarterback Guy
Benjamin's quote about his re
ceivers in Monday's Daily was
taken out of context. He didn't
mean to criticize his receivers. A
couple of words were also left
out of his quote in yesterday's
paper . . . concerning quarter
backs and coaches, Benjamin
said, "You get a lot of credit and
blame that's not rightfully
yours."

48-24 drenching of the Cards last
week.
"There's not a lot to say about
last week's game." Stanford
coach Jack Christiansen told the
northern California football
writers yesterday. "SC is one
large extremely good football
team."
Looking ahead to next
weekend's Rose Bowl show
down between the Trojans and
Bruins Christiansen said,
"They're two different types of
teams. UCLA has got size and
quickness. It should be an out
standing game."
New goal
But after striking thornes in
the Race for the Roses last week,
the Cards' goal is to avoid their
first losing season since 1963,
when John Ralston posted a 3-7
mark in his first year on the
Farm.
The Ducks (3-6) are riding a
five-game losing streak and
some Webfoot fans have talked
of riding Oregon head coach Don
Read out of Eugene. UCLA held
the Ducks to minus two yards
rushing in its 46-0 victory over
Oregon last weekend.
The Ducks have been shut out
by USC, Notre Dame and UCLA.
But as Christiansen said, "Ore
gon always plays a good game
against us."
Emotional letdown
The Cards will have to avoid
an emotional letdown after USC.
The Oregon game is sandwiched
between last week's emotional
drain and the already soldout
Big Game next week.
"It's always been a problem
since I've been here," said Chris
tiansen. "It's hard to concen
trate. It's tough after any loss.
"But we'll try to emphasize
that we still have the opportun
ity for a winning season," added
Chris.
Oregon comeback
Last year Stanford jumped out
to a seemingly comfortable 33-3
lead over the Ducks and then had
to hang on, as quarterback Jack
Henderson threw for 283 yards,
to close the score to 33-30. Run
ning back George Bennett scored
three touchdowns against the
Cards.
"We've had a lot of close
games with them recently. It
went down to the wire last year
and they beat us up in Oregon in
1972 (15-13)," said Christiansen.
"Henderson is a very fine
quarterback. He did an outstand
ing job against us last year. Greg
Bauer is an excellent receiver.
He's one of the best in the con
ference, and he's the man they go
to in the clutch," said Chris.
Oregon stats
Henderson has completed 118
of 215 passes fo 1087 yards and
four touchdowns. Bauer has

grabbed 37 passes for 404 yards
and two touchdowns.
Stanford's injury report was
almost as bad as the score of last
Saturday's game. Six offensive
linemen were injured in the USC
contest. Captain Alex karakazoff
is probably out for the remainder
of the season with two cracked
bones (transverse processes) in
his back.
Offensive tackle Bill Hubbard,
who suffered a sprained wrist
last week, will move into
Karakozoff's guard spot.
Correction: Quarterback Guy
Benjamin's quote about his re
ceivers in Monday's Daily was
taken out of context. He didn't
mean to criticize his receivers. A
couple of words were also left
out of his quote in yesterday's
paper . . . concerning quarter
backs and coaches, Benjamin
said, "You get a lot of credit and
blame that's not rightfully
yours."
