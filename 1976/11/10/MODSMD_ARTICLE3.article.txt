# Oligopoly measures attacked
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Two corporate lawyers attacked as
"arbitrary, mechanical and unflexi
ble" proposed laws that would force
the breakup of corporations that exer
cise oligopolistic control over a mar
ket.
A public interest lawyer argued that
"oligopoly is bad for consumers."
And an economist called for "a func
tional rather than a mechanistic defini
tion of concentration."
All three positions emerged during a
panel discussion of "Issues of Antit
rust and Concentration in American
Industry" held in Bishop Auditorium
yesterday, before an audience of about
300 persons.
James Atkins, a partner in the firm of
Pillsbury. Madison and Sutro (legal
counsel for Standard Oil of California),
and the project director of the Commit

tee for Industrial Organization of the
American Petroleum Institute, argued
that current levels of corporate con
centration in the oil industry do not
violate the standards of either the Neal
Report (The Report of the President's
Task Force on Concentration in Indus
try. prepared in 1968 by Phil Neal,
then the dean of the University of
Chicago Law School), or of the Con
centrated Industries Act, a proposed
law introduced in the Senate by retir
ing Michigan Sen. Philip Hart.
Big neither 'bad or good'
While admitting that "oil spills,
payoffs, and rising gasoline costs" had
given the oil industry "a bad case of
political halitosis," Atkin argued that
"bigness is neither presumptively bad
or good; oligopoly is neither presump
tively bad or good; and corporate mer
gers are neither presumptively bad or

good."
He cited a recent report by a high
official in the anti-trust division of the
Justice Department calling the pet
roleum industry "one of the least con
centrated of our major industries" and
claimed that "to legislate a per se rule
(for breakups at a certain degree of
concentration) does a disservice to
those institutions that are doing an ex
cellent job for our nation."
Mark Green, director of the Corpo
rate Accountability Research Group in
Washington, D.C., and an associate of
Ralph Nader, said that Atkin's three
time reiteration of his three-part con
demnation of automatic divertiture
standards as "rigid, inflexible and ar
bitrary" were "conclusions, not argu
ments."
Prove intent
He said that the need to prove "in
tent" on the part of oligopolistic firms
to establish joint control of a market
hindered rapid settlement of anti-trust
cases. He suggested that an automatic
standard bringing Justice Department
action when concentration reaches a
certain level would be better.
"Structure and performance are
linked,"said Green. "Concentrated
structure leads to bad performance."
Roger Nol 1, a professor of economics
at the California Institute of Technol
ogy and a visiting professor this year at
the Business School, argued that some
lawyers tended to concentrate on ques
tions of "equity, value and fairness" in
discussing anti-trust, and did not pay
enough attention to questions of
"economic efficiency and perfor
mance."
Noll, who is also Director of Studies
in the Regulation of Economic Activity
at the Brookings Institution, said that
his "bottom line" was that there
should be "some shifting of the burden
of proof (in antitrust cases) from soci
ety to the firms.
'Equalize wealth'
Casper Weinberger, legal counsel
for Bechtel Corporation and a former
U.S. Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare under Richard Nixon, ar
gued that the goal of antitrust should
not be to "equalize wealth" or to "pro
tect communities" but "to increase
competition."
"I don't think that mere bigness
should be penalized." said the corpo
rate attorney and former newspaper
columnist. "We can't secure abso
lutely perfect competition."
To do that, Weinberger said, "we
would (have to) virtually atomize
many efficient producers of goods and
services that people want and need."

All three positions emerged during a
panel discussion of "Issues of Antit
rust and Concentration in American
Industry" held in Bishop Auditorium
yesterday, before an audience of about
300 persons.
James Atkins, a partner in the firm of
Pillsbury. Madison and Sutro (legal
counsel for Standard Oil of California),
and the project director of the Commit

tee for Industrial Organization of the
American Petroleum Institute, argued
that current levels of corporate con
centration in the oil industry do not
violate the standards of either the Neal
Report (The Report of the President's
Task Force on Concentration in Indus
try. prepared in 1968 by Phil Neal,
then the dean of the University of
Chicago Law School), or of the Con
centrated Industries Act, a proposed
law introduced in the Senate by retir
ing Michigan Sen. Philip Hart.
Big neither 'bad or good'
While admitting that "oil spills,
payoffs, and rising gasoline costs" had
given the oil industry "a bad case of
political halitosis," Atkin argued that
"bigness is neither presumptively bad
or good; oligopoly is neither presump
tively bad or good; and corporate mer
gers are neither presumptively bad or

good."
He cited a recent report by a high
official in the anti-trust division of the
Justice Department calling the pet
roleum industry "one of the least con
centrated of our major industries" and
claimed that "to legislate a per se rule
(for breakups at a certain degree of
concentration) does a disservice to
those institutions that are doing an ex
cellent job for our nation."
Mark Green, director of the Corpo
rate Accountability Research Group in
Washington, D.C., and an associate of
Ralph Nader, said that Atkin's three
time reiteration of his three-part con
demnation of automatic divertiture
standards as "rigid, inflexible and ar
bitrary" were "conclusions, not argu
ments."
Prove intent
He said that the need to prove "in
tent" on the part of oligopolistic firms
to establish joint control of a market
hindered rapid settlement of anti-trust
cases. He suggested that an automatic
standard bringing Justice Department
action when concentration reaches a
certain level would be better.
"Structure and performance are
linked,"said Green. "Concentrated
structure leads to bad performance."
Roger Nol 1, a professor of economics
at the California Institute of Technol
ogy and a visiting professor this year at
the Business School, argued that some
lawyers tended to concentrate on ques
tions of "equity, value and fairness" in
discussing anti-trust, and did not pay
enough attention to questions of
"economic efficiency and perfor
mance."
Noll, who is also Director of Studies
in the Regulation of Economic Activity
at the Brookings Institution, said that
his "bottom line" was that there
should be "some shifting of the burden
of proof (in antitrust cases) from soci
ety to the firms.
'Equalize wealth'
Casper Weinberger, legal counsel
for Bechtel Corporation and a former
U.S. Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare under Richard Nixon, ar
gued that the goal of antitrust should
not be to "equalize wealth" or to "pro
tect communities" but "to increase
competition."
"I don't think that mere bigness
should be penalized." said the corpo
rate attorney and former newspaper
columnist. "We can't secure abso
lutely perfect competition."
To do that, Weinberger said, "we
would (have to) virtually atomize
many efficient producers of goods and
services that people want and need."
Two corporate lawyers attacked as
"arbitrary, mechanical and unflexi
ble" proposed laws that would force
the breakup of corporations that exer
cise oligopolistic control over a mar
ket.
A public interest lawyer argued that
"oligopoly is bad for consumers."
And an economist called for "a func
tional rather than a mechanistic defini
tion of concentration."
