## Don't fire Chris 
### Paul Bauman 
It's not surprising that the "Sack Jack"
rumors have surfaced again, just sad.
This time, the controversy seems to have
been ignited by a United Press International
story and by Stanford's 48-24 loss to USC
Saturday. UPI reported Monday that a disap
pointed group of affluent Stanford alumni
want to see Cardinal head coach Jack Christ
iansen fired at the end of the season.
Such a move is not warranted.
First of all, this is not the time to raise the
subject. With Stanford out of the Rose Bowl
race and the pressure off. it's a good time for the
Cards to have some fun playing football again
and to hopefully beat Oregon and California in
the process. And can't Christiansen at least
finish the season before his coaching job is
evaluated?
Off the handle
Apparently not. Some people flew off the
handle because Stanford got clobbered by a
great team Saturday. What they don't, or won't,
realize is that it's a bonus whenever the Cards
beat a USC or a UCLA or even a Cal.
Stanford's high admission standards pre
vent it from getting class athletes of the quan
tity seen on the other schools' rosters. USC,
UCLA and Cal can go after any athlete they
want and get him admitted. Whether he's liter
ate or not is secondary.
Fred Hargadon, dean of admissions, proba
bly has more to say about the Stanford football
team's degree of success than does Christian
sen.
In deciding whether Christiansen should
remain at Stanford, the philosophy of the foot
ball program here must be stated. If it is to
produce the winningest teams possible,
perhaps Christiansen is not the best man to
lead them. If, however, it is to field a competi
tive. money-making team and to keep the game
in its proper perspective, perhaps he is the best
man for the job. Since Stanford does not lessen
its admission standards much for athletes, I
suspect, and hope, the latter philosophy is pre
ferred.
Unfortunately, an attitude more suited to
professional football has pervaded Stanford.
The team isn't winning, so personnel changes

are needed, right? What's next, trading
players?
Fact extended
Christiansen was originally given a three
year contract in 1972. After two years. Athletic
Director Joe Ruetz awarded him a new five
year pact expiring after the 1978 season. The
remaining two years of the contract should be
honored. After that, it will probably be best to
make a coaching change.
Christiansen deserves to serve out his con
tract because of his rational approach to the
game and his coaching record to date.
In his four-plus years as head coach at Stan
ford, Christiansen has done all that could have
been expected of him. The Cards have not lost
to a northern Pacific-H team since 1972, a re
cord neither IJSC. UCLA nor Cal can match.
Stanford has also beaten Cai twice, USC once,
tied IJCLA and Michigan and played strongly
against Penn State under Chris. Civen the
school's admissions requirements, you can't
ask for much more. Only when Stanford ceases
to be competitive in the Pac-8 is it time to
panic.
Poor showing
Yet, it is true that the Cards have not played
well this year by any standards. They defeat
themselves at least as often as other teams do.
The blame can't be placed on any one person,
but Christiansen must accept some of the re
sponsibility.
Cal is also a much better team than its 4-5
record indicates. So do you fire Mike White? If
so, you lose one of the best head coaches in the
country.
If Stanford plays next season as it has this
year, the situation might then be serious. But
it's not now.
For the past three years though, the football
program has been embroiled in controversy. It
has already hurt the team and can't continue
much longer.
If any mistake has been made, it was putting
too much faith in the future and extending
Christiansen's contract for five years instead
of, say, three. But his performance has not been
so bad to justify terminating that contract pre
maturely.
