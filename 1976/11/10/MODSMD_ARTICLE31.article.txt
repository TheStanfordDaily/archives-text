Cold winter threatens fuel supply
Washington — The Federal Energy Administra
tion (FEA) reported yesterday that the nation in
general should have enough fuel to make up tor
expected natural gas shortages this winter, pro
vided the weather and the economy are normal.
Hut the agency said North Carolina may run into
fuel shortages even in a normal winter, and unusu
ally cold weather could result in shortages of
energy in that state and eight others: Georgia, Mary
land, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Ken
tucky, West Virginia and Arizona.
In scattered local areas, said an FEA draft report,
there could be shortages that might force temporary
job layoffs if alternate fuels are unavailable or can
not be used.
The biggest economic impact of natural gas shor
tages this winter, the report said, would be the cost
of alternate fuels more expensive than natural gas.
It said this might add some $550 million to $660
million to the nation's winter fuel bill.
Microwaves still strike U.S. embassy
Berlin — TheSoviet Union is continuing its mic
rowave bombardment of the American embassy in
Moscow and "we would like to see it stopped," said
tlit: former U.S. ambassador there.
Walter Stoessel, now ambassador to West Ger
many, emphasized, however, that the present level
of microwave exposure does not constitute a health
hazard. He also said a screen put in use at the
Moscow legation helps cut down the microwave
inflow, which was first reported last winter.

Stoessel was interviewed by the Associated Press
Monday at the West Berlin residence maintained
for American envoys to Bonn.
San Quentin tunnelers foiled
San Quentin — Using stolen shovels, a makeshift
telephone warning system and clean clothes to
wear after each day's work, a group of convicts
tunneled close to freedom before they were disco
vered and captured yesterday.
San Quentin state prison spokesman Bill Merkle
said three prisoners, all with prior escape attempts
on their records, surrendered quietly after a guard
happened to hear their voices behind a metal door
in a sub-basement room filled with dirt.
Three other convicts in the north cellblock,
which also houses Death Row, were placed in
maximum security for their parts in the escape at
tempt, and Merkle said as many as a dozen may
have been involved.
Prison officials said the inmates had already tun
neled their way 10 feet down and 67 feet outward
and beyond the prison wall.
Calling the plot "real Jimmy Cagney stuff,"
Merkle said it was only a guard's random check of
the basement area that turned up the scheme.
After the three diggers gave themselves up, offi
cials said, guards found a sophisticated tunnel
complete with wooden walls, electric lights, fan
and a communications system fashioned from
radio and telephone parts.
U.S., Vietnam may open relations
Washington — The United States and Vietnam
will open preliminary talks Friday in Paris on the
possibility of beginning normal relations, Ameri
can officials said yesterday.
The talks will be the first between the two coun
tries since the Paris peace agreement was signed
almost four years ago.
In a related development, Vietnamese officials
said an application by Hanoi for admission to the
United Nations will come up in the U.N. Security
Council FYiday and a vote is expected Monday.
The Ford administration has said it will veto the
Vietnamese application if there is no substantial
progress toward obtaining an accounting of the 800
Americans listed as missing in action in Vietnam.
President-elect Jimmy Carter has expressed sup
port for this position but said that the Ford ad
ministration's inability to obtain an MIA account
ing is one of its most embarrassing failures.
Bombs blast Argentine police
Buenos Aires — Two bombs exploded last night
in the police headquarters for Buenos Aires Pro
vince, wounding at least a dozen high-ranking
police commanders, security sources said.
Unconfirmed reports said three policemen were
killed by the blasts, which occurred while the offic
ers were conducting promotion examinations.
The bombs went off at the headquarters building

in La Plata, the provincial capital 35 miles south of
Buenos Aires.
Oil companies' profits increase
San Francisco — The nation's 25 largest oil com
panies earned a total of $3 billion in profits during
the third quarter of the year, the American Pet
roleum Institute disclosed yesterday.
Institute president Frank Ikard said the figure
represented a nine per cent increase over the cor
responding period in 1975.
He said the companies attributed the higher earn
ings to increased prices for crude oil and natural
gas and to improved profit margins on refining,
marketing and chemicals.
Offsetting the profits were larger expenditures
for exploration and drilling, increased taxes as a
result of elimination of percentage depletion and
changes in U.S. tax treatment of foreign earnings,
Ikard said. No figures were released in those areas,
however.
Ikard said 13 of the 25 major oil companies re
ported capital and exploration expenditures total
ing $13.6 billion during the first nine months of the
year while their net income during the same period
was $7.1 billion.

Bombs blast Argentine police
Buenos Aires — Two bombs exploded last night
in the police headquarters for Buenos Aires Pro
vince, wounding at least a dozen high-ranking
police commanders, security sources said.
Unconfirmed reports said three policemen were
killed by the blasts, which occurred while the offic
ers were conducting promotion examinations.
The bombs went off at the headquarters building

in La Plata, the provincial capital 35 miles south of
Buenos Aires.
Oil companies' profits increase
San Francisco — The nation's 25 largest oil com
panies earned a total of $3 billion in profits during
the third quarter of the year, the American Pet
roleum Institute disclosed yesterday.
Institute president Frank Ikard said the figure
represented a nine per cent increase over the cor
responding period in 1975.
He said the companies attributed the higher earn
ings to increased prices for crude oil and natural
gas and to improved profit margins on refining,
marketing and chemicals.
Offsetting the profits were larger expenditures
for exploration and drilling, increased taxes as a
result of elimination of percentage depletion and
changes in U.S. tax treatment of foreign earnings,
Ikard said. No figures were released in those areas,
however.
Ikard said 13 of the 25 major oil companies re
ported capital and exploration expenditures total
ing $13.6 billion during the first nine months of the
year while their net income during the same period
was $7.1 billion.

Cold winter threatens fuel supply
Washington — The Federal Energy Administra
tion (FEA) reported yesterday that the nation in
general should have enough fuel to make up tor
expected natural gas shortages this winter, pro
vided the weather and the economy are normal.
Hut the agency said North Carolina may run into
fuel shortages even in a normal winter, and unusu
ally cold weather could result in shortages of
energy in that state and eight others: Georgia, Mary
land, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Ken
tucky, West Virginia and Arizona.
In scattered local areas, said an FEA draft report,
there could be shortages that might force temporary
job layoffs if alternate fuels are unavailable or can
not be used.
The biggest economic impact of natural gas shor
tages this winter, the report said, would be the cost
of alternate fuels more expensive than natural gas.
It said this might add some $550 million to $660
million to the nation's winter fuel bill.
Microwaves still strike U.S. embassy
Berlin — TheSoviet Union is continuing its mic

Moscow and "we would like to see it stopped," said
tlit: former U.S. ambassador there.
Walter Stoessel, now ambassador to West Ger
many, emphasized, however, that the present level
of microwave exposure does not constitute a health
hazard. He also said a screen put in use at the
Moscow legation helps cut down the microwave
inflow, which was first reported last winter.

Stoessel was interviewed by the Associated Press
Monday at the West Berlin residence maintained
for American envoys to Bonn.
San Quentin tunnelers foiled
San Quentin — Using stolen shovels, a makeshift
telephone warning system and clean clothes to
wear after each day's work, a group of convicts
tunneled close to freedom before they were disco
vered and captured yesterday.
San Quentin state prison spokesman Bill Merkle
said three prisoners, all with prior escape attempts
on their records, surrendered quietly after a guard
happened to hear their voices behind a metal door
in a sub-basement room filled with dirt.
Three other convicts in the north cellblock,
which also houses Death Row, were placed in
maximum security for their parts in the escape at
tempt, and Merkle said as many as a dozen may
have been involved.
Prison officials said the inmates had already tun
neled their way 10 feet down and 67 feet outward
and beyond the prison wall.
Calling the plot "real Jimmy Cagney stuff,"
Merkle said it was only a guard's random check of
the basement area that turned up the scheme.
After the three diggers gave themselves up, offi
cials said, guards found a sophisticated tunnel
complete with wooden walls, electric lights, fan
and a communications system fashioned from
radio and telephone parts.
U.S., Vietnam may open relations
Washington — The United States and Vietnam

In scattered local areas, said an FEA draft report,
there could be shortages that might force temporary
job layoffs if alternate fuels are unavailable or can
not be used.
The biggest economic impact of natural gas shor
tages this winter, the report said, would be the cost
of alternate fuels more expensive than natural gas.
It said this might add some $550 million to $660
million to the nation's winter fuel bill.
Microwaves still strike U.S. embassy
Berlin — TheSoviet Union is continuing its mic
rowave bombardment of the American embassy in
Moscow and "we would like to see it stopped," said
tlit: former U.S. ambassador there.
Walter Stoessel, now ambassador to West Ger
many, emphasized, however, that the present level
of microwave exposure does not constitute a health
hazard. He also said a screen put in use at the
Moscow legation helps cut down the microwave
inflow, which was first reported last winter.

Stoessel was interviewed by the Associated Press
Monday at the West Berlin residence maintained
for American envoys to Bonn.
San Quentin tunnelers foiled
San Quentin — Using stolen shovels, a makeshift
telephone warning system and clean clothes to
wear after each day's work, a group of convicts
tunneled close to freedom before they were disco
vered and captured yesterday.
San Quentin state prison spokesman Bill Merkle
said three prisoners, all with prior escape attempts
on their records, surrendered quietly after a guard
happened to hear their voices behind a metal door
in a sub-basement room filled with dirt.
Three other convicts in the north cellblock,
which also houses Death Row, were placed in
maximum security for their parts in the escape at
tempt, and Merkle said as many as a dozen may
have been involved.
Prison officials said the inmates had already tun
neled their way 10 feet down and 67 feet outward
and beyond the prison wall.
Calling the plot "real Jimmy Cagney stuff,"
Merkle said it was only a guard's random check of
the basement area that turned up the scheme.
After the three diggers gave themselves up, offi
cials said, guards found a sophisticated tunnel
complete with wooden walls, electric lights, fan
and a communications system fashioned from
radio and telephone parts.
U.S., Vietnam may open relations
Washington — The United States and Vietnam
will open preliminary talks Friday in Paris on the
possibility of beginning normal relations, Ameri
can officials said yesterday.
The talks will be the first between the two coun
tries since the Paris peace agreement was signed
almost four years ago.
In a related development, Vietnamese officials
said an application by Hanoi for admission to the
United Nations will come up in the U.N. Security
Council FYiday and a vote is expected Monday.
The Ford administration has said it will veto the
Vietnamese application if there is no substantial
progress toward obtaining an accounting of the 800
Americans listed as missing in action in Vietnam.
President-elect Jimmy Carter has expressed sup
port for this position but said that the Ford ad
ministration's inability to obtain an MIA account
ing is one of its most embarrassing failures.
Bombs blast Argentine police
Buenos Aires — Two bombs exploded last night
in the police headquarters for Buenos Aires Pro
vince, wounding at least a dozen high-ranking
police commanders, security sources said.
Unconfirmed reports said three policemen were
killed by the blasts, which occurred while the offic
ers were conducting promotion examinations.
The bombs went off at the headquarters building

in La Plata, the provincial capital 35 miles south of
Buenos Aires.
Oil companies' profits increase
San Francisco — The nation's 25 largest oil com
panies earned a total of $3 billion in profits during
the third quarter of the year, the American Pet
roleum Institute disclosed yesterday.
Institute president Frank Ikard said the figure
represented a nine per cent increase over the cor
responding period in 1975.
He said the companies attributed the higher earn
ings to increased prices for crude oil and natural
gas and to improved profit margins on refining,
marketing and chemicals.
Offsetting the profits were larger expenditures
for exploration and drilling, increased taxes as a
result of elimination of percentage depletion and
changes in U.S. tax treatment of foreign earnings,
Ikard said. No figures were released in those areas,
however.
Ikard said 13 of the 25 major oil companies re
ported capital and exploration expenditures total
ing $13.6 billion during the first nine months of the
year while their net income during the same period
was $7.1 billion.

Cold winter threatens fuel supply
Washington — The Federal Energy Administra
tion (FEA) reported yesterday that the nation in
general should have enough fuel to make up tor
expected natural gas shortages this winter, pro
vided the weather and the economy are normal.
Hut the agency said North Carolina may run into
fuel shortages even in a normal winter, and unusu
ally cold weather could result in shortages of
energy in that state and eight others: Georgia, Mary
land, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Ken
tucky, West Virginia and Arizona.
