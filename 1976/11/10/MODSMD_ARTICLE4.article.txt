Dean Aaron Wildavsky outlined the
difference between a "prophylactic
presidency" and a "positive presi
dency," in a speech before 60 persons
yesterday in Annenberg Auditorium.
He criticized the call for presidential
planning, which he said resulted in a
preventative or "prophylactic" post
ure. He indicated that while planning
attempts to anticipate the problems of
the future, it also leads to coercion and
politics.
An alternative would be a "positive
presidency." which initiates action
now to secure things later. In this sys
tem. planning exists, but "is equally
connected, one item of the system,
tightly linked. This system is con
nected and coherent, but highly dif
ferentiated and mutually exclusive."
Wildavsky explained.
"Planning (in the prophylactic pres
idency) assumes power, and is a form
of politics. It involves coordination,
which is a synonym for coercion," he
said.
He said that anticipatory planning is
reminiscent of Cassandra, who made
prophecies of doom and labeled this
tendency the "Cassandra-complex."
Citi/.ens lose out
"Anticipatory planning needs a
prophylactic presidency. The presi
dent would be named the Creat An
ticipator." hn said.
He stated, however, that the humor

in this was at the people's expense.
"There are too many movements
which attempt to take risk out of life,"
he said.
He cited insurance, health care, var
ious regulatory programs, the domino
theory and the ideology of the Cold
War as reflecting this preventative at
titude.
"Anticipatory planners have a lot of
imagination," he said.
In foreign policy, the Republicans
have been great planners; while in
domestic policy, it has been the Demo
crats, he stated.
He indicated that government pol
icy, as preventative medicine, is "a
middle-class operation, whose clients
have much to lose and consequently
seek to protect it."
On the other hand, proponents of a
"positive presidency" are generally
underprivileged or deprived, he said.
Leaving nothing to chance
Wildavsky called President-elect
Carter "an untested quantity," and
proposed that Americans have ended
up with "a guy we don't know" be
cause the original system of election
has been so regulated.
"We no longer want a messy politi
cal system, and have eliminated the
convention system for the primary sys
tem," he said.
He concluded that while both the
positive and prophylactic approaches
contain planning, it is useful to care
fully compare the two options.
