# Too much traffic
## Palo Alto may ban autos 
### Lonnie Rosenwald 
Rapidly increasing traffic may even
tually force Palo Alto to curb au
tomobile use, and the city planners
fear the Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan
does not address this issue adequately,
according to Asst. Planning Director
Ken Schreiber.
The City Planning Commission's
final recommendations regarding the
plan reassert an anti-automobile pol
icy which the planners feel the City
Council has abandoned in its modifi
cations of the plan.
The Commission's recommenda
tions would restore bicycle programs,
limit a carpool incentive plan for
employers, and restore much of the
original language of the plan's trans
portation sections, all of which have
been deleted or diluted by the Council
during its three-month review of the
plan.
After a final public hearing tonight,
the commission will forward its report
to the council, which will have 40 days
to consider the recommendations be
fore approving the plan.
Reduce auto dependence
The most significant change the
commission seeks is reinstatement of a
goal "to reduce dependence on the au
tomobile," which the council had re
placed with "to increase efficient use
of the automobile."
The commission also wants to limit

an incentive plan to employers to en
courage carpools in exchange for more
lenient development requirements.
The council wants to grant relaxation
of parking space minimum standards,
as well as an increase in allowable
building coverage space to companies
whose employes form commuter car
pools.
Because of the uncertainty of the ac
tual impact of these incentives, the
commission had originally favored in
stead a penalty tax to companies based
upon worker-to-car ratio basis.
The council strongly opposed the
tax plan, claiming some positive in
centive is needed.
"You need some incentive,"
Schreiber conceded. "To appeal to
their civic duty isn't going to work
very well."
Compromise
The compromise which the com
mission is offering will reduce parking
space minimums, provided space for
future parking needs is set aside either
vacant or as landscaping. "We're try
ing to reduce the amount of concrete
and asphalt," said Schreiber.
The bicycle measures which the
planners want to restore to the plan
call for better bicycle facilities and
more bicycle parking. Palo Alto resi
dent and bicycle enthusiast Ellen
Fletcher said she was encouraged by
"the unanimous votes for the bicycle

programs."
She hopes the commission's report
will offset "the thrust the council is
trying to give the car."
The plan also calls for action to dis
courage through traffic from residen
tial zones by using "diverters, chokers,
and stop signs." One such detour sys
tem has already been installed in Col
lege Terrace.
Monitoring moves
Schreiber was optimistic that the
council would adopt the recommenda
tions, including those which would
restore the council's deletions.

The Thinker
George Bach, Frank E. Buck Professor of Economics and Public Policy at
the Business School, contemplates an incisive point dealing with oligopoly
and antitrust during a discussion on these subjects yesterday afternoon in
Bishop Auditorium. Someone in the audience, presumably a business
student, pointed out to intensive laughter that "There is no such thing as a
free lunch."
