# Graduation speakers considered
## 
### Kath Scanlon 
A tentative list of commencement
speaker candidates for the 1977 gradu
ation exercises was released yesterday
by senior class officers Mike Dorsey,
Jamie Grodsky, Risa Shimoda and
Dave Treinis.
Those being considered include (in
alphabetical order): Isaac Asimov,
Leonard Bernstein, Willie Brandt,
Alistair Cooke. Jacques Cousteau, John
Hope Franklin, Theodore Hesburgh,
Orson Wells and Elie Wiesel. The of
ficers emphasized that this was not
necessarily an exhaustive list.
The names were compiled from
questionnaires distributed on registra
tion day, names solicited from
graduate students and professors, and
suggestions in response to an ad in the
Daily . According to the officers, their
main criteria are that the person cho
sen be able to speak well and prefera
bly not hold a political office, since
this might limit what he or she could
say.
The officers who will decide which
candidate to invite as a speaker will
base their decision on those prefer
ences expressed by the seniors.
Suggestions, ideas or opinions are
welcome, they said. Persons may con
tact them in theloftat the ASSU office.
Grodsky said her idea for an alumni
hospitality service was received favor
ably at the alumni executive board
meeting last month.
The service would allow traveling
Stanford students to stay with alumni
across the country and would be coor
dinated through the alumni clubs. A
list of alumni would be available at
Bowman Alumni House and all neces
sary arrangements would be made be
fore each trip, she said.
"This would be a helpful thing for
students and make alumni feel they
haven't lost contact with the Stanford
student body." said Grodsky.
