# Understanding libertarianism

Opinions on "libertarianism" have
surfaced frequently in the last few
weeks. This visibility should encour
age proponents of that perennially
controversial political orientation, and
it should result in increased under
standing of the various assertions, for
and against.
It should, but there is reason for
doubt.
Who is the audience? In the modern
sense, a debate is held between the ad
vocates of several views, advocates
who normally have no intention of
being persuaded by the opposition,
and their assertions are directed at an
audience which is presumably free
and willing to select any of the views
presented, depending on the content
and manner of presentation.
It may be useful to temporarily ig
nore the active participants in the
controversy while focusing on the au
dience, the passive participants.
first there are those who are rela
tively unfamiliar with both the asser
tions and the evidence. This group,
very loosely speaking, does not react to
the word "libertarianism." In other
words, if you were to walk up to one
and say. "I'm a libertarian." s/he might
reply, "What's a libertarian?" or "So
what?"
Reaction
The second group comprises those
individuals who do know enough, at
least about the assertions, to have a
reaction to certain words and phrases
(or in rational terms, to "evaluate").
The introduction postulated above
might be answered with "You beast!"
or "Hey, that's great!" to give extreme
examples.
The thi rd and last group considered,
apart from the debaters themselves,
includes people who are mure or less
familiar with the issues yet who refrain
Irom identification with any of the
"sides" in the controversy. A member
of this group might also answer "so
what," but a likely reply could be
"That's interesting. Tell me about it."
I've made these distinctions for
purely heuristic purposes, that is, to
illustrate one interpretation of the
libertarian controversy which, I think,
deserves analysis and, more impor
tantly. application.
What is the function of the debate?
What result is sought by the debaters?
Let's assume they wish to persuade
members of all groups to recognize the
superiority of their claims. We might
•suppose that they wish to antagonize,
to open a new window on reality, or to
obtain any of several equally conceiv
able results. Hut in keeping with the
debate format, let's assume persua
sion.
Two alternatives
Then, in general, two alternatives
are open to the debaters, within the
field of media debate. They can, for
universality, employ terms outside the
domain of "libertarianism" to which
almost everyone will react predictably
and uniformly. Gommonlv known as
rhetoric, this is an art familiar to poets
and politicians.
Terms like "liberty." "civil rights."
"big business." and "poor people"
have come to assume a nonrational
form through the historical accumula
tion of connotations. It is possible to
react to such words unthinkingly, see
ing only the images which they
evoke.
In a more indirect manner, the
speaker/writer may solicit a response
by constructing metaphors, analogue
descriptions of controversial subjects
or objects. Those who react to his/her
statements are then reacting to the
metaphor rather than its referent.
Hut. alternative! v. a debater mav be a

teacher. We rarely feel that we have
been "persuaded" of the validity of the
Pythagorean Theorem, or of mass
energy equivalence, or of the occur
ence of the Renaissance. Yet none of
these theoretical results are self
evident or even logically valid in all
theoretical systems and under all
logics.
Avoid confusion
And a teacher does many things
which might be useful in a debate.
S/he explicates theory (assertions) by a
combination of logical means and
analogies, attempting to instruct
rather than convince. S/he takes great
pains, in most cases, to avoid confu
sion by employing either all possible
connotations or (if such is possible) frw
no connotations.
As far as possible, the teacher will
support assertions with evidence, or
will indicate how his "claims" may be
tested. At the end, the student will un
derstand the subject better and the
teacher/debater will have succeeded in
"teaching" his beliefs — which, in a
way, is the same as proving or persuad
ing, and which provides a much less
arbitrary or variable basis for choice
than rhetoric.
To assess the possible result of the
rhetorical method, let's examine a
statement from David W. Brown's arti
cle (Daily, Oct. 1H) referring to the lack
of legal protection for consumers
under a libertarian government: "Con
sumers are fair game to hucksters who
deceive the buying public by any
means short of bare-faced fraud."
Group l's reaction: "Sounds like the
sellers are really out to get the buyers.
Under libertarianism there would be
nothing to stop them." ('.roup 2, pro:
"Let them watch out for themselves."
Group 2. con: "Yeah, think of the
people who don't know penicillin
from talcum powder. What are they
going to do?"
Related analogy
Group 3 might ask the following
questions: Is this the only interpreta
tion of buying conditions under liber
tarianism? More pertinently, does this
analogy relate to existing evidence?
Perhaps those potential hucksters are
consumers, too. Or perhaps, due to its
connotations, "consumers" is a poor
word choice.
Another statement illustrates the
polarizing effect of rhetoric. Hill Evers.
in the Oct. 12 Daily, says "To help
interested persons decide who is right
— Oakley or Libertarians — Oakley
should. . Group 2 needs such an
either-or choice. And, while Group 1 is
supposedly being informed of the
choices available, it's important to
recognize that they are being asked to
make a choice rather than merely to
analyze. Rhetoric leads to polarity. In
fact, it thrives on it. Put Group 3 might
ask, at this point. "Is it possible that
neither is right? Or both? Perhaps the
question of right or wrong really re
lates to the success of a particular ap
proach. and if so, it may be the wrong
question to ask, since the approach in
question (libertarianism) has not been
tested in the 'field' (American soci
ety)."
This is not to say that polarities and
conflicts are useless or destructive. A
dynamic view of general cultural de
velopment includes both stability and
polarity — stability to ensure com
munication and polarity to motivate
change. The interpretations of liber
tarianism deserve to be communi
cated, not necessarily for a solution of
the controversy, but for understanding
of a problem often reacted to rather
than analyzed.
