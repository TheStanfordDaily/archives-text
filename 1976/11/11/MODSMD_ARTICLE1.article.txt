# Medical School may refuse 'restrictive' federal funding
## 
### Elizabeth Pollock Staff writer 
The Medical School may refuse to
accept an estimated $800,000 in capi
tation funds and a new student loan
program because the law which estab
lishes these programs contains provi
sions which would abridge academic
freedom.
The capitation funds are awarded to
the school based upon the number of
students enrolled.
"This (law) compromises two fun
damental academic decisions, the
criteria for admission and selection of
students," said Clayton Rich, vice
president for medical affairs and dean
of the school in a letter to medical
school faculty and students.
"1 believe we should not accept
these provisions," Rich wrote. Initial
faculty reaction has been in agreement
with him, he said.
The Health Professions Educational
Assistance Act of 197H says that in
order to receive the funds (an au
thorized $2000 per year per student
enrolled in the school), a medical
school must provide places for Ameri

cans who are now studying medicine
abroad if they have completed two
years of study and have passed part
one of the national boards.
"The school cannot reject (the stu
dents) on academic grounds so long as
they pass the boards," Rich said. The
Secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare would apportion the students
among the nation's medical schools
with Stanford taking "somewhere be
tween three and seven or eight stu
dents," Rich said.
Class space is most constrained at
the third and fourth year levels, where
the students would presumably enter.
However, the controversial decisive
issue for the medical school is the idea
that the government would set the
standards of admission, Rich said.
Another of the law's provisions
would control the number of residen
cies available in a particular field at
medical schools accepting the funds.
During the first year of the program, 35
per cent of residencies would be in
primary care; 40 percent in the second
year and 50 per cent of all residencies
would be in primary care thereafter.

Primary care specialties are general
internal medicine, pediatrics and fam
ily medicine. Presently, about 20 per
cent of Stanford's residencies are in
primary care.
Rich wrote that he has reservations
about the government's designating
the number of primary care residen
cies, as a condition of providing capi-,
tation funds. However, the university
would not reject this provision on
grounds of academic interference, be
cause residents are not matriculating
students, he said.
"There is a strong public need for
doctors in primary care," he said in an
interview last night.
The Medical School has not in
cluded the capitation funds as part of
its budget forecasts. "This allows us to
think of doing without the money,"
Rich explained.
The medical students would be af
fected by the law's loan provisions,
which offer Federally Insured Student
Loans (FISLs) at better terms than the
present program, he said.
A final decision will not be made
until HEW issues its regulations and
their effect on the admissions process
is clear. This could take several
months, Rich said.
"(Meanwhile), we will be doing our
best (to have the law amended)," Rich
said, "but the pressure in Congress
against amendment is very real.''
Some individuals in Congress "esti
mate that the money is so important to
the universities that they'll take it ir
respective of academic considera
tions." Rich said.
Rich plans to raise the matter of the
government's involvement in the ad
missions process at the annual meet
ing of the Council of Deans of the As
sociation of American Medical Col
leges which starts today in San Fran
cisco.
