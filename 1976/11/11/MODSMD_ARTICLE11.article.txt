# On the Horn of a dilemma
## 
### 
No class strikes so much terror in the hearts of
Stanford students than Prof. Horn's Constitutional
Law class. The students tremble at Horn's use of the
infamous Socratic method to conduct his class dis
cussions, a la The Paper Chase.
When Prof. Horn trudges through the door
clutching his law books and puffing his cigarette,
the once joyful and happy classroom quickly be
comes paralyzed and silent. As Horn sits down, the
quivering students array themselves before him in
assigned seats, their legal briefs and law volumes to
fortress them against his every question.
Horn, sitting like an imposing Buddha, perches
his half-moon glasses on his nose and begins speak
ing.
—Horn: The first case on the docket today is Missis
sippi against Johnson. What are the issues that the
court decided in this case: (Horn consults seating
chart. All life ceases in classroom). Mr. Childress?
(Collective sigh of relief from class; Childress prays
— a foxhole conversion).
—Chil:Uh, the issue the court decided was whether
the president can be enjoyed by injunction from
carrying into effect an act of Congress alleged to be
unconstitutional.
—Horn: Very good, Mr. Childress. (Horn calls
everyone"Mr.,"even thegirls). Let me pose to you a
hypothetical situation. Suppose the Court's deci
sion is not obeyed. As is apparent from this case, the
courts have no external means of enforcing their
decisions. Maybe we should give the courts some
power, say, the 82nd Airborne Division? Would
this solve the problem. Mr. Childress?
—Chil: (Sensing impending doom) Er, uh, I don't
know sir.
—Horn: Well, why don't you check your briefs?
—Chil: I didn't wear any this morning. (Muffled
chortles and guffaws from class).
—Horn: Can you help him, Mr. Perkins?

—Perk: I think Mr. Childress is beyond help.
—Horn: Well, at least that's an honest answer. What
about you, Mr. Bedecarre?
—Bed: (Waking up from ten minute nap that Horn
has undoubtedly noticed) Whaaa? Would you
please repeat the question? ("Poor hearing" is a
favorite stalling tactic).

—Horn: What if we gave the 82nd Airborne to the
Supreme Court to help it enforce its decisions?
—Bed: (Incoherent mumble followed by an ex
cruciatingly long pause).
—Bed: (pentitently) Not prepared, sir. (The unpar
donable sin. The class gasps in horror).
(Horn chuckles softly and stomps his cfgarette
out in the ashtray. He folds his hands and leans
forward ominously).
—Horn: Not prepared, eh? Do you see any problems
with that answer?
—Bed: (Hoping for a quick death) Uh, er, (gulp) no
sir, I don't.
—Horn: Well then, may I suggest one to you? If you
continue on this present course of action, or should
I say, nonaction, you may fail to receive a respecta
ble amount of credit for this class. Do you catch my
drift, Mr. Bedecarre?
—Bed: Yes sir. I repent for my evil. (Buries head on
desk to muffle sobs).

—Horn: Very good. I would still like an answer to
my question. (Horn peruses seating chart. Entire
class turns purple). Mr. Livingston?
(Livingston, a redhot bound for Harvard Law
School, hops to his feet and shoves his thumbs into
the vest pockets of his three-piece suit).
—Liv: I'rof. Horn, distinguished members of the
class. This case today, on the surface, deals with a
question of constitutional law. But this is only on
the surface. What is actually on trial here today is
not a constitutional question, oh no, but the very
law itself. Each and every one of us must ask our
selves hard, difficult questions, just as Prof. Horn has
asked me. Can we, as freedom-loving Americans
living in this great and glorious land, allow such
injustice to continue? I daresay not.
As Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in his now famous
dissent in Foilg Su Wong v. Algonquin, "Freedom
is like candy, you never get tired of it and it doesn't
rot your teeth." With that in mind, we cannot close
our hearts to such ignominious evil and heinous
calumny and still be able to look ourselves in the
mirror each morning and say, 'I'm a good guy.'
These wrongs must be righted. The voices of the
oppressed must not go unheeded. The question is
there. The decision is yours. 1 rest my case. (Riotous
applause from class. Some students wipe tears from
eyes).
—Horn: Very good, Mr. Livingston. I might nomi
nate you for an Academy Award, but definitely not
to the Supreme Court. Well, I see that our time is up
for today and I still don't have an answer to my
question. Maybe we'll have better luck tomorrow.
Class is adjourned.
(Prof. Horn bangs his gavel on ths desk. The class
rises as he exits).
