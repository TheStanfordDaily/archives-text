# Letters: Southern prestige, Food Day

### 
Southern prestige
Having spent the last two summers
in Georgia, I realize that Jimmy Carter,
when his term ended, was not exactly
the most popular governor the state
had ever had. In fact, evidence is that
his occasional anti-segregation stands
cost him support at that time through
out the Deep South.
But come election day 1976, and the
Solid South was reconstituted for the
first time in many a year. Old divisions
were forgotten in the drive to put a
Southerner back in the White House.
There was some talk during the
campaign of anti-Southern sentiment
in the rest of the nation. (For example,
Alex Alben's column, Oct. 22 Daily.)
Such sentiment has always provoked a
great deal of resentment among South
erners.
Southern reporters, for example, al
ways feel snubbed by the establish
ment media. A few years ago, a South
ern reporter broke a rather important
story in Washington after a good deal
of investigative reporting — and none
of the more established papers put
enough credence in theSouthern press
to look into it for several months.
As a result, the Southern press, like
the rest of the South, undoubtedly saw
this election as a chance to quiet the
jokes and the insults. This last sum
mer, while I was working at the At
lanta Journal, a reporter returned from
a campaign swing with Carter to report
yet another anti-Southern joke. Hut
one of his colleagues quickly reas
sured him: "That's okay. For the next
eight years, we're gonna be so fucking
in, it's gonna get pissy."
That admittedly crude comment
probably sums up the feelings with
which much of the Deep South went to
the polls. Ford's platform may have
been closer to what many Southerners
wanted, but only Jimmy Carter could
bring them prestige.

Day of Fasting
Nov. 17 will make the difference be
tween life and death for starving
people around the world. The Dav of

Fasting has two objectives.
First is to increase our own aware
ness of a hunger problem which we are
vastly separated from.
Second is to raise funds to aid those
members of the world who are without
food or the means to provide food for
themselves.
The University Food Service is giv
ing rebates for each food service patron
who will be fasting. Many indepen
dent houses and fraternities have
pledged money intended for the Day of
Fasting's meals. All groups and indi
viduals are able to decide where their

aid is going.
Aid is needed in so many locations;
from Palo Alto to Asia or Africa or . . .
The problem is extensive. I urge you to
actively participate in the Day of Fast
ing.
There will be events and organiza
tion information at noon in White
Plaza. During the evening a film will
be shown, and there will be a panel
discussion. The solution begins at
home.

Public abortion funds
Proponents of Medicaid abortions
cite the 1973 Supreme Court ruling
that abortion is entirely a woman's
"private, personal choice." In that case
she has no right to voluntarily col
lect public funds to pay for an opera
tion which the Supreme Court itself
acknowledges is optional.
When a woman demands indepen
dent "control of her own body" and
then demands public bail-out for the
consequences, she is exercising no
control at all. Glenn Rice

of investigative reporting — and none
of the more established papers put
enough credence in theSouthern press
to look into it for several months.
As a result, the Southern press, like
the rest of the South, undoubtedly saw
this election as a chance to quiet the
jokes and the insults. This last sum
mer, while I was working at the At
lanta Journal, a reporter returned from
a campaign swing with Carter to report
yet another anti-Southern joke. Hut
one of his colleagues quickly reas
sured him: "That's okay. For the next
eight years, we're gonna be so fucking
in, it's gonna get pissy."
That admittedly crude comment
probably sums up the feelings with
which much of the Deep South went to
the polls. Ford's platform may have
been closer to what many Southerners
wanted, but only Jimmy Carter could
bring them prestige.

Day of Fasting
Nov. 17 will make the difference be
tween life and death for starving
people around the world. The Dav of

Fasting has two objectives.
First is to increase our own aware
ness of a hunger problem which we are
vastly separated from.
Second is to raise funds to aid those
members of the world who are without
food or the means to provide food for
themselves.
The University Food Service is giv
ing rebates for each food service patron
who will be fasting. Many indepen
dent houses and fraternities have
pledged money intended for the Day of
Fasting's meals. All groups and indi
viduals are able to decide where their

aid is going.
Aid is needed in so many locations;
from Palo Alto to Asia or Africa or . . .
The problem is extensive. I urge you to
actively participate in the Day of Fast
ing.
There will be events and organiza
tion information at noon in White
Plaza. During the evening a film will
be shown, and there will be a panel
discussion. The solution begins at
home.

Public abortion funds
Proponents of Medicaid abortions
cite the 1973 Supreme Court ruling
that abortion is entirely a woman's
"private, personal choice." In that case
she has no right to voluntarily col
lect public funds to pay for an opera
tion which the Supreme Court itself
acknowledges is optional.
When a woman demands indepen
dent "control of her own body" and
then demands public bail-out for the
consequences, she is exercising no
control at all. Glenn Rice

Southern prestige
Having spent the last two summers
in Georgia, I realize that Jimmy Carter,
when his term ended, was not exactly
the most popular governor the state
had ever had. In fact, evidence is that
his occasional anti-segregation stands
cost him support at that time through
out the Deep South.
But come election day 1976, and the
Solid South was reconstituted for the
first time in many a year. Old divisions
were forgotten in the drive to put a
Southerner back in the White House.
There was some talk during the
campaign of anti-Southern sentiment
in the rest of the nation. (For example,
Alex Alben's column, Oct. 22 Daily.)
Such sentiment has always provoked a
great deal of resentment among South
erners.
Southern reporters, for example, al
ways feel snubbed by the establish
ment media. A few years ago, a South
ern reporter broke a rather important
story in Washington after a good deal
of investigative reporting — and none
of the more established papers put
enough credence in theSouthern press
to look into it for several months.
