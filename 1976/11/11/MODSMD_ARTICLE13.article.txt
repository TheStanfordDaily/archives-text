# Misdeeds forgiven too fast

The Wall Street Journal

Not too many years ago divorce was
considered a heavy burden for candi
dates seeking public office. But last
week's election results indicate that
today voters are willing to go to con
siderable lengths to separate the pri
vate and public lives of their politi
cians.
Of 21 incumbent congressmen pub
licly linked by judicial bodies or the
press with political wrongdoing or
personal scandal, 19 were re-elected.
The exceptions were Rep. Allan Howe
(D-Utah), convicted of soliciting ser
vices of two decoy cops he thought
were prostitutes, and Rep. Henry
Helstoski (R-N.J.), who faces trial on
charges of taking payoffs in return for
helping illegal aliens remain in the
United States.
Revelations
Elsewhere, however. Rep. Donald
Riegle (D-Mich.) was elected to the,
U.S. Senate despite revelations of his'
extra-marital affair with an unpaid
staff aide. And Rep. Robert beggett
(D-Calif.) was re-elected despite hav
ing acknowledged two children by a
Capitol Hill secretary and forging his
wife's name to a deed to buy a house
for his mistress.
Moreover, voters returner! to Con
gress an incumbent who was fined for

not reporting a corporate campaign
contribution, another who was de
tained by the District of Columbia
police for soliciting a policewoman
disguised as a prostitute, and one who
repaid travel expenses after the Wall
Street Journal revealed that he had
overcharged the government.
Conflict of interest
Rep. Robert Sikes (D-Florida) even
survived a reprimand by House col
leagues for conflict of interest.
This apparent tolerance for what
used to be considered immoral be
havior might appear paradoxical in
view of the recent talk about morality
in government. Clearly, the electorate
has grown adept at sorting out the
proven from the alleged and the
deeply serious from the less serious.

insofar as it means the public views
politicians as ordinary mortals, with
human frailties, rather than a class
apart.
Worth reflecting
Still, we wonder if it isn't worth ask
ing whether qualifications for public
office should be compartmentalized
quite th.it neatlv. We wonder it it isn't

worth reflecting upon whether the in
cidents cited above don't have some
hearing on political judgment, if not
rectitude.
Can political service be conducted
in an ethical and moral vacuum where
the only important consideration is
one's Americans for Democratic Ac
tion (ADA) and Americans for Con
stitutional Action (ACA) ratings? Or is
there something to the moral tone of
government that embraces both the
political and the personal?
A good part of the problem here is
simply that, under the guise of cam
paign financing and other "reforms."
our election laws have been rigged so
thoroughly against challengers that it
is practically impossible to defeat an
incumbent congressman, whatever his
or her sins either personal or political.

days when divorce was a barrier to
election, we do think voters ought to
be more concerned about personal
morality than they seemed to be last
week.
