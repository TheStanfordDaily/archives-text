# Students complain but pay at The Store

Complaints about prices.
'Complaints about selection.
Complaints. More complaints.
Cary Ding, manager of the
Tresidder Store, puts up with a
lot of complaints. "Students al
wavs say we're ripping them off
because they're on campus," he
says.
Are students' attitudes jus
tit ied? Would they do better to
bike into Palo Alto for items they
need? A study of local grocery
stores shows that it depends on
what they want and where they
go for it.
The Store's prices are lower
than two other Palo Alto
groceries, higher than two, and
virtually the same as one, ac
cording to to a survey which
tabulated the total cost of 10
items in each of five downtown
stores.
The items — brownie mix,
cheese. Oreo cookies. Ritz crac
kers, coffee, cola, deodorant,
shampoo, soap, tissues and
toothpaste — totaled $9.31 in
The Store. Totals ranged from 82
cents less to 84 cents more in the
other markets.
No brand names
With the exception of the
cookies and crackers, the survey
disregarded brand names, so
th.it the statistics reflect each
store's lowest price for each
i torn.
A 62-cent difference in the
cost of groceries caused the price
tally at Norm's Starlight Super,

248 Lytton Ave., to be consider
ably above that of The Store.
Although prices at Norm's
were not consistently higher
than those of the university's
grocery, they were pushed up
significantly by a 39-cent differ
ence in the price of cheese and a
35-cent difference on coffee.
Coffee prices also affected the
total for Food Mart. 560 Waver
ley, where prices were 65 cents
higher than The Store's. A six
ounce jar of instant coffee was 29
cents more there than in theTre
sidder establishment.
Food Mart priced six of the 10
items higher than The Store did.
It charged more for three of the
four sundry items, resulting in a
39-cent total difference on those
items.
Lower sundry prices
Lower sundry prices were the
primary reason that two markets
had lower totals than The Store,
although grocery items reduced
the tally somewhat, too.
Toothpaste was sold for sig
nificantly less at both Purity
Friendly Supermarket, 144 Stan
ford Shopping Center, and the
Co-op Supermarket, 164 S.
California Ave. Purity charged
30 cents less while the Co-op
undersold The Store by 54 cents.
The Co-op had the lowest total
of the five markets: $8.49. Its
sundry items added up to 57
cents less than those of The
Store, while its grocery goods
were 25 cents less. The Co-op's
prices were lower on eight of the

10 items.
Purity's sundries were 30
cents less than The Store's, its
groceries 21 cents less.
Equal prices
At Town and Country Market,
116 Town and Country Village,
total prices for the 10 items were
the same as at The Store, but sig
nificant differences could be
seen in prices ot individual
items.

Town and Country's total was
raised by a 30-cent difference in
the price of deodorant. However,
coffee prices at the university's
grocery were 41 cents more.
Town and Country was higher
on three of the four sundry goods
and lower on tour of the six groc
ery items.
It is not surprising to Ding that
some markets are able to under
sell The Store. He says that The

Store is not competitive with
many of the markets in Palo Alto
because it is not intended to be a
full-size grocery, but a conveni
ence store, "a limited Seven-
Eleven."
Yet more than its limited size
keeps The Store from competing
with larger markets, for it is run
very differently from a Seven-
Eleven. Because The Store is a
part of Stanford University and

Tresidder Union, prices have to
be kept high to ensure profits,
according to Tresidder's direc
tor, Dan Williams.
"It's kind of a socialistic ap
proach." says Williams, relating
how The Store generates income
for Tresidder.
According to Williams. Tre
sidder operates as a single unit
so that each entity within the
Union contributes to tin: operat
ing and overhead expenses oi
the entire building. The Univer
sity pays tor those operations
that do not provide an income,
such as the reading rooms.
That arrangement is why "1
can't try to make The Store have
a discount image." Ding says.
"The Store is making the money,
so that's where they look to. It it
weren't making the money, the
attitude would be different."
Highest possible
To keep making the money.
Ding says that he has to charge
the highest retail price possible
on sundries. "We don't do the
volume in sundries."
However, he claims that in
candy purchasing. "I have the
best cost in Santa Clara county."
Grocery items are bought from
the Stanford commissary at 10
percent above cost. The Store
then adds another lit) per cent.
Ding says that he buys from the
commissary because he cannot
purchase large enough quan
tities to do business with a regu
lar wholesaler.
Some students who want to

beat The Store's buying and pric
ing systems have suggested a
campus cooperative market. But
according to people in tin; gro
cery field, it is more likely that
the alternatives lie in either pav
ing I'he Store's prices or going
into Palo Alto.
'Difficult'
J.M. Reeves, operations co
ordinator ot the Co-op Super
markets. says that starting a
co-op at Stanford would be dif
ficult because of the transient na
ture of a college campus. "It
takes large capital outlay to set
up a market to serve the student
community." and students who
plan to live in an area for only
tour years would be unlikely to
contribute.
Many Stanford students do
appear to consider it worth the
time to go downtown for grocery
and sundry items. Reeves says
tli.it students provide 'quite a
tollowing at the Co-op."
Those who do go into I'alo
Alto will find lower prices in
two groceries. Yet not everyone
is price-conscious enough to go
downtown for only a few items,
and that is where The Store gets
its following, says Ding.
Since The Store does more
than its share to help support
Tresidder, it is likely that the
convenience of having a grocery
nearby wins out over a sense of
injustice. Students complain,
but they pay.

Prices too high?
Many students complain about the prices at the Tresidder Store, but they have to be kept high to
ensure profits, according to Tresidder director Dan Williams.
