# Students unable to find work
## 
### 
(CPS) Ten p.m., University of
Minnesota: The doors don't even
open till 7 a.m. the next morning
hut already students are milling
ahout. A janitor shows them the
door but they sneak back in.
Other students begin gathering
outside in the cold, dark hours
before the dawn. "1 fell I ike I was
getting into my car with my hus
band in the middle of the night
to go have .1 baby or soinethi ng."
said one student as she joined
the early morning throng. Fi
nally 7 a.m. rolls around, the
doors are unlocked and the stu
dents pour in. Before long, ev
erything is taken.
That was not the scene in front
of a ticket booth but rather the
bi/.arre spectacle of job-hungry
students arriving at 2:45 a.m. at
the University's Business School
placement office. The students
were jockeying for positions for
the chance to sign up for inter
views with prospective
employers. These students don't
want tickets, thev want work.

Work. Many students are ob
sessed with the idea of work
these days mainly because they
can't find any. Guidance
counselors report many students
at wit's end at the thought of
graduation and the dismal job
market that goes with it. Tales
abound of students dashing off
hundreds of resumes only to re
ceive zilch in return. The Daily
Nebraskan student newspaper
devotes an entire issue of its
weekly magazine to work, wryly
placing on the cover a gem that
once sputtered from the lips of
Henry Ford: "There will never
be a system invented," the ear
liest model Ford crowed,
"which will do away with the
necessity for. work."
All this points to the fact that
thousands of former students
armed even with master's de
grees are unplugging sewers for
a living, if they are lucky enough
to find even those jobs.
Things are certainly bad now
in the job market and the future

appears grim at best, once one
wades through the job jabber
wocky spewed forth by
economic cheerleaders like
political candidates and place
ment officers.
Unemployment 7.8 per cent
Currently, unemployment is
hovering at the 7.8 per cent level
overall; it's 12.7 per cent for
blacks, 18.6 per cent for teena
gers and 40 per cent for black
teenagers in cities. Those figures
are the highest since the Depres
sion and one should keep in
mind those are the government's
figures.
The basic reason for this job
less mess is simple, economists
agree: the economy is just not
able to generate enough work for
everyone who wants a job. It's
true that there are more people
working than ever before, but at
the same time there are also
many more people not working
who want or need a job. One
major reason is that women have
entered the work force in huge

numbers in the past couple years
— 29 per cent of U.S. women
worked in 1956 while 36 per
cent work now — and the
number of available jobs has not
expanded accordingly.
But won't things get better like
they always do? Some people,
like the congressional sponsors
of jobless legislation and other
eternal optimists, say yes. But
increasingly, many usually con
servative voices are agreeing
there has been a corner turned in
the American economy, and al
though they aren't exactly sure
what it is, they are coming out
and saying the future is really
not all that bright.
No simple solution
"The next president, whoever
he is, may not find the solution
simple," warned The Wall Street
Journal in a front page article on
unemployment this fall. "The
years ahead may find that pro
viding a payroll spot for every
male or female who 'wants' one
may be a very big order — for any
president, any congress, any
government," The Journal ad
ded.
The U.S. Labor Department's
1976-77 Occupational Outlook
Handbook states an "over
whelming" majority of job open
ings in the next decade will not
call for four year degrees. Those
jobs that demand college de
grees will favor candidates from
top schools like Stanford, whose
high-flying Business School re
ports a great year for placing its
grads with top firms. "You're not
buying four years of school and
then a good job anymore," says
Harvard job expert Richard
Freeman. "You're now buying
four years of school and three
years of fluffing around."
