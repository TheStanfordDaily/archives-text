# Hot dogs and landscapes shown by Hungarian artist

Chicago (AP) — Gustav Kron,
who studied painting in his na
tive Budapest. Hungary, and
dreamed of perhaps becoming a
great artist, now has hundreds of
his paintings displayed — all 0/
hot dogs.
korn. 62. came to this country
20 years ago and went to work
lor a sausage company curing
corned beef. In his spare time he
painted landscapes.
Two years ago one of his bos
ses noticed korn's paintings at
an art show.

"And the next day 1 had a new
job with the company, a sign
painter," said korn. "I paint hot
dogs with and without mustard;
or with relish and mustard, or
with onions, relish and mustard,
most often in a bun.
"But sometimes I paint just the
naked weiner or sausage. The
colors can be just as exciting as
those in a landscape."
He says no two hot dogs are
alike. There are variations in
their curve, shape and color.

"Each one is a new challenge. I
have as much fun painting hot
dogs as I do painting land
scapes," he said.
korn said his weekly produc
tion may be as many as a dozen
signs, 2-by-3 feet in size. "It's not
a job I can rush or be pushed. For
instance, Polish sausages are 20
inches long and are cut in half.
My paintings show the cut and
it takes time to get it right," he
said.
The signs are distributed by
the company in a seven-state
area for use at hot dog stands,
restaurants and delicatessens.
korn said when he retires in
another three years he will de
vote full time to his hobby of
painting landscapes. Herecently
sold three of these paintings at
an art club exibit.
korn said that he never gets
tired of looking at a hot dog. "My
wife and I both like to eat them,
but Hungarian goulash is still
our favorite," he said.
