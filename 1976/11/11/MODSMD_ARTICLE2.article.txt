# Gerry calls Congress inactive on civil rights
## 
### Alex Alben Staff writer 
The nation's lawmaking bodies
often hinder rather than facilitate pas
sage and enforcement of civil rights
legislation, according to the director of
the office of civil rights for the De
partment of Health, Education and
Welfare.
"The Congress isn't making laws at
all. They're just sitting out there and
thinking up nice ideas." said Martin
Gerry in an informal address yesterday
at the Law School.
He criticized bureaucratic distor
tions of the concept of separation of
powers saying, "The Executive branch
is making the law. not the policies.
Congress is passing increasingly sort
of 'nice' statutes like 'Don't discrimi
nate against:' and then they just fill in
the category. So what happens is that
tho regulation rank, the policy making,
becomes the law making."
Irony
A specific example Gerry cited was a
bill on education which allowed Con
gress to veto certain provisions of their
own legislation. Gerry termed this
"the ultimate constitutional irony."
Gerry also gave an analysis of how
bureaucratic regulations thwart en
forcement of policies such as affirma
tive action plans.
Referring to a study UC-Berkeley

was forced to undertake because the
Labor Department decided to "flex its
muscles." Gerry said that the univer
sity had to spend approximately
$750,000 over an 18 month period
studying obscure subjects such as a
qualitative training analysis on com
parative job advancement of sec
retaries with dictation skills as op
posed to secretaries who had taken
courses in automative data processing.
Government reorganization
On the subject of governmental
reorganization under the Carter ad
ministration. the director was not op
timistic.
He said that many congressmen seek
to create new appropriation commit
tees in order to disburse funds in their
home districts.
If Carter, who said he plans to reor
ganize the federal government, de
cides to consolidate agencies within
the Executive branch which have cor
responding committees in Congress,
congressmen would lose one of their
major political interests, heexplained.
because any consolidation of agen
cies would translate into a correspond
ing decrease in such chairmanships,
he believes that reorganization —
which he said he favors — will not
come about as long as the seniority and
power systems in the Legislative
branch are maintained.
