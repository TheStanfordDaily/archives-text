Who was the red-hot neanderthal who led that
gross exercise in noise pollution by the LS/l/MB
on rhursday night, November 4, during mid-term
season? Aren't Friday and Saturday (28 per cent
of le time) enough for athletic chauvinism? Let's
heur it for school night quiet rights!
-G.F.F.
Mellow out. G.F.. apparently somebody liked
the Band's "concert." Assistant Band Manager
Rich Johnson reports that "there were always at
least 100 peoplefollowing (theband) around."On
some parts of the campus, like at Stern Hall,
Johnson says there were about 300 onlookers.
That "exercise in noise pollution" you heard
was part of the activities surrounding the I JSC'
game. Johnson says that since that game is one of
the major events of football season, the band holds
an "all-campus rally."
Why on a school night? Johnson says that rallies
are held on Thursday night because Fridays are
usually booked up with alumni reunions."
Johnson says that last Thursday night's
serenade was about the longest they've had in
years, lasting about three hours."But that was be
cause everybody was really keyed." he added.
The article "University establishes campus
energy office" in the Nov. 1 Daily is re
ally ludicrous considering the number of build
ings on campus which have lights blazing 24
hours a day. Since Dan DeYoung said, "Every
body here can play a part in it -all of us have the
ability to make an effect," referring to cutting
down of the energy waste factor, why in the world
doesn't the University administration do some
thing about this excess use of electricity?
I've heard such excuses as security and safety
used. What about reducing the number of lights in
a hall, floor, building by half? The comments in
the article made by DeYoung, assumedly speak
ing for Stanford's administration, are a little of
pots calling kettles black.
I talked to Dan DeYoung, who said that over the

last three years, the University has taken some
very significant steps toward saving energy.
These include going through buildings with a
light meter and removing all unnecessary fluores
cent lights, then replacing the remaining 40 watt
lights with 35 watt tubes.
DeYoung said there are now also time controls
in some parking lots (e.g., Encina) where the
lights go off at midnight. The lights at Maples are
on only when the Pavilion is in use. And except
for in the classrooms, janitorial services have been
switched from night to day.
Hut there is still the problem of security.
DeYoung said he recently talked with a women's
group in which many of the women were afraid to
walk through the campus at night because it's so
dark. DeYoung reminded that "we still have four
unsolved murders," and"the Police Department
is just as reluctant to turn (lights) off because of
security as we are willing, because of saving
energy."
DeYoung says they want to increase awareness
and get people to turn off those lights that don't
add to security. It's a psychological battle, he says,
because when they lower the lights in a building,
people buy desk lamps. And when people leave
classrooms at night, they forget to turn the lights
off.
How old is Barbara Walters? My friend thinks
she's some sort of spring chicken, but I maintain
she is at least 50. Who's right?
-still watching Walters
Well, now, it depends on your definition of a
spring chicken, I guess. ABC news in New York
lists her age as 42. When I asked if that was give or
take ten years, the reply was "No, more like give or
take two years." The spokesman said, "Unoffi
cially, though, she's 43."
Thinking that, perhaps, only her hairdresser
knows the real story, 1 asked who did her hair. The
voice on the other end, however, didn't know, and
said only, "It does look prettv windblown, doesn't
it?"
