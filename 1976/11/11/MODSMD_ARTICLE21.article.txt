# French author Robbe-Grillet has 'nothing to say' in a novel
##

"When 1 write a novel," Alain Robbe-Grillet
announced on Monday, "1 have nothing to say."
The dean of French "new novelists" was not
speaking of interviews or conversation habits,
however. "A journalist, an essayist knows what
he is going to say even before he begins," Robbe-
Grillet explained in French to an overflow En
gineering Corner crowd.
"But what I have to say is not a 'something.' I
have nothing to describe. Instead 1 am a creator:
my work is to make something out of nothing."
Robbe-Grillet, who was recognized as a major
writer with the publication of his first novel, The
Erasers, in 1953, said he saw a "premonition" of
the contemporary novelist's style in the works of
Geline and Camus.
"Everything in Camus is tinged with uncer
tainty," he said. "The elements of the work are no
longer linked by causality. In the 19th-century
novel, time was essential, but Camus broke up
time. One still hears critics talk of novels in terms
of time, but in the contemporary novel it has al
most disappeared.
"My novels are stationary; it is space that I am
concerned with," he said. "I am fascinated by the
sorts of places that are found in dreams: small
places which nestle in larger ones, places which

expand and turn inside out. The contemporary
novelist is above all a creator of spaces."
He described bis first work as "a detective story,
a murder mystery, which is a conventional
enough narrative except that the murder does not
exist." Of his second novel, The Voyeur, he said,
"It centers around a moment in which something
might have happened. Unfortunately it is that
very moment which is missing from the text."
Robbe-Grillet collaborated with French director
Alain Resnais on the film Last Yeoraf Marienbad.
"I wanted to make a film without memory, in
which there could be no last year and no previous
Marienbad." he said. "But 1 think Resnais' idea
was different.
"It was a curious collaboration," he said. "We
were two men born on the same day of the same
year, both in Brittany. We were both named Alain,
our surnames both began with 'R'. . . it was very
disturbing.
"However," he announced in mock triumph,
"there was a distinction: Resnais always attended
Mass as a child, and I never did."
Robbe-Grillet added that the film's subsequent
misadventures included a series of disputes with
film technicians ("the guard dogs of the conven
tional ideology").
"In all." he said, "the film enjoyed a great suc
cess."

"When 1 write a novel," Alain Robbe-Grillet
announced on Monday, "1 have nothing to say."
The dean of French "new novelists" was not
speaking of interviews or conversation habits,
however. "A journalist, an essayist knows what
he is going to say even before he begins," Robbe-
Grillet explained in French to an overflow En
gineering Corner crowd.
"But what I have to say is not a 'something.' I
have nothing to describe. Instead 1 am a creator:
my work is to make something out of nothing."
Robbe-Grillet, who was recognized as a major
writer with the publication of his first novel, The
Erasers, in 1953, said he saw a "premonition" of
the contemporary novelist's style in the works of
Geline and Camus.
"Everything in Camus is tinged with uncer
tainty," he said. "The elements of the work are no
longer linked by causality. In the 19th-century
novel, time was essential, but Camus broke up
time. One still hears critics talk of novels in terms
of time, but in the contemporary novel it has al
most disappeared.
"My novels are stationary; it is space that I am
concerned with," he said. "I am fascinated by the
sorts of places that are found in dreams: small
places which nestle in larger ones, places which

expand and turn inside out. The contemporary
novelist is above all a creator of spaces."
He described bis first work as "a detective story,
a murder mystery, which is a conventional
enough narrative except that the murder does not
exist." Of his second novel, The Voyeur, he said,
"It centers around a moment in which something
might have happened. Unfortunately it is that
very moment which is missing from the text."
Robbe-Grillet collaborated with French director
Alain Resnais on the film Last Yeoraf Marienbad.
"I wanted to make a film without memory, in
which there could be no last year and no previous
Marienbad." he said. "But 1 think Resnais' idea
was different.
"It was a curious collaboration," he said. "We
were two men born on the same day of the same
year, both in Brittany. We were both named Alain,
our surnames both began with 'R'. . . it was very
disturbing.
"However," he announced in mock triumph,
"there was a distinction: Resnais always attended
Mass as a child, and I never did."
Robbe-Grillet added that the film's subsequent
misadventures included a series of disputes with
film technicians ("the guard dogs of the conven
tional ideology").
"In all." he said, "the film enjoyed a great suc
cess."
