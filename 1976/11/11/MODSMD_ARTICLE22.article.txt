### Cecily Deegan 
Leaves of the Living is a
multi-media production which
utilizes dance, drama, song,
lights, and slides to enhance dif
ferent moods evoked by the
poetry of Sam Ambler. Per
formed by the Bureau of Western
Mythology, a year-old Palo
AI to-based group that creates
experimental pieces for group
performance, Tresidder's Large
Lounge is transformed, refig
gured into many spaces by plat
forms. bleachers and small
ramps. The 10 players weave
through the audience which is
itself able to change seats during

the production.
Roughly two hours is divided
into seven parts, incorporating
about seven poems, leading from
Birth, Wind, Being, to Rebirth.
Light, Becoming. The cycle starts
with a poem, the player I, and
ends with the player 111, signal
ling the transformation of the
unique player as well as the
group.
As a multi-dimensional ex
perience, the performance con
centrates more on transitions
and moods than on moments.
The players are individuals, not
characters. It is hard to discern
why one poem should stand out
more than another, for the tempo
and delivery of the lines is uni
iform for the most part. Lacking a
clear sense of dynamics and
structure, the performance was
occasionally mesmerizing.
But observation without a
point of view which plot tradi
tionally develops is a posture
that the performance and the
players encourage.

The performance may sound
terribly serious, but there is
comedy as well. .At the Bottom is
a meeting of two knights-errant
who indulge in a little verbal and
physical jousting.
During the Pimp's lament, one
of the few dramatically intense
moments in the evening, the
players slip on satin vests or
studded dresses over their
leotards, and slink around the
audience soliciting them mar
velously.
Although individuals gener
ally deliver their lines or chants
at a similar level of intensity,
Wiek kruitwagen's Sway Me
and Camel's h'luivers are out
standing.
Leaves of the Living is unusual
and demands special attention
and involvement from the audi
ence. So relax your critical facul
ties for a few hours and give it a
try. The performances will con
tinue tonight through Sunday at
7:30. and tickets are available at
the Tresidder Box Office.

ling the transformation of the
unique player as well as the
group.
As a multi-dimensional ex
perience, the performance con
centrates more on transitions
and moods than on moments.
The players are individuals, not
characters. It is hard to discern
why one poem should stand out
more than another, for the tempo
and delivery of the lines is uni
iform for the most part. Lacking a
clear sense of dynamics and
structure, the performance was
occasionally mesmerizing.
But observation without a
point of view which plot tradi
tionally develops is a posture
that the performance and the
players encourage.

The performance may sound
terribly serious, but there is
comedy as well. .At the Bottom is
a meeting of two knights-errant
who indulge in a little verbal and
physical jousting.
During the Pimp's lament, one
of the few dramatically intense
moments in the evening, the
players slip on satin vests or
studded dresses over their
leotards, and slink around the
audience soliciting them mar
velously.
Although individuals gener
ally deliver their lines or chants
at a similar level of intensity,
Wiek kruitwagen's Sway Me
and Camel's h'luivers are out
standing.
Leaves of the Living is unusual
and demands special attention
and involvement from the audi
ence. So relax your critical facul
ties for a few hours and give it a
try. The performances will con
tinue tonight through Sunday at
7:30. and tickets are available at
the Tresidder Box Office.
