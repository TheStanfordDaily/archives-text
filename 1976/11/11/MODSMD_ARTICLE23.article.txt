# Bassist Carter jazzes it up
## 
### David L. Miller 
The classical double bassist
has traditionally been confined
to playing background bass
lines. Jazz has made the bassist
an equal. Ron Carter has brought
the bassist out front as primary
soloist.
Bassist Ron Carter, often refer
red to as "t he workhorse of jazz,"
appeared recently at keystone
korner in San Francisco with
Buster Williams also on bass,
kenny Barron on piano, and Ben
Riley on drums. The two-bass
combination created sensitive
and unique interactions of
acoustic sounds that em
phasized the deep timbre of the
bass, and the musical changes
and solos.
Coaxing sounds that one
would never expect from a dou
ble bass. Carter was the main
soloist, using Buster William's
strong fast bass lines as contra
puntal points of departure.
Images evoked
Solid and rhythmic, kenny
Barron's piano playing ranged
from the classical to the blues to
the highly abstract. His off-beat
dissonant chords set against Ben
Riley's tasteful drumming
evokes images of Thelonious
Monk. Riley, who was Monk's
drummer for many years, shi ned
I.ist night as always, playing
every inch of his drums with his
hands, sticks and brushes.
The group started Saturday
night's performance with a
Miles Davis composition enti
tled So What. Carter soloed with
his bow. stringing out har
monics in a succession of as
cending and descending scales.
The song ended with a quiet,
highly complex musical conver
sation between the two bassists.
Fach number lasted thirty to
forty-five minutes, sometimes
digressing into musical acroba
tics. hut always exciting. Vibrat
ing wailing sounds emanating
from his bass, Carter led the
group through Milt Jackson's
Bags Croove. Oscar Pettiford's
l.uverne Walk, and a melodic
Brazilian flavored original. Long
improvistional passages by all
lour musicians combined
throughout the evening into a
perfectly textured whole.
This was jazz at its best.
