# Young plays his best for NorCal
## 
### Bruce Kaminski 
Before a crowd of perhaps rock
music's most loyal fans. Neil
Young gave a concert on
November 2 which was truly
awe-inspiring. The only com
plaint heard in the auditorium
later was that he should have
played longer.
Undoubtedly. northern
California holds Neil Young's
most devoted followers. This
was evident as hundreds of
people could be seen outside the
theatre offering as much as $50 a
ticket to anyone who had any ex
tras. This isn't surprising be
cause these fanatics had waited

over live years to see their favo
rite musician.
Young came on stage alone
and immediately set the tone of
the show when he sang his
brand-new Stringmcin, accom
panying hi nisei 112 with an acous
tic guitar. During the perfor
mance, he wenl on to play
numerous new songs which the
several thousand fans received
enthusiastically. Before he left
for intermission he treated the
crowd to such favorites as Old
Man and Sugar Mountain on
guitar and After the Gold Hush
on piano.
Electric set
Crazy Horse, Neil Young's in
comparable hand. joined him in
the spotlight for his electric set.
Again he struck up two more
new songs Hurricane and Bite
the Bullet. He then sent the mob
into hysterics with Cowgirl in
the Sand, his forceful lead guitar
being reminiscent of the Crosby,
Stills, Nash and Young days.
After performing Don 't Cry No
Tears and Drive Back, two songs
from their Zuma I,l', Neil Young
and Crazy Horse left stage leav
ing the multitudes screaming for
more. Young wasn't about to let
his thundering followers down,
so he came back to lead Crazy
Horse in Cinnamon Girl and Cor
tex the Killer, again emphasizing
his lead guitar work.
After the show, everyone ag
reed that this concert was worth
the five-year wait because Neil
Young really played his heart
out to his most avid fans. Hope
fully. he won't wait another five
years before performing again in
the Bay Area.
