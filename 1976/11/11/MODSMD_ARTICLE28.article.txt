# Blacklisting era returns
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
For those of you who have
been intensely studying for
mid-terms, blacklisting is 'in'
this autumn. In his latest hit.
Woody Allen plays Howard
Prince, a front for blacklisted
television writers. In Memorial
Auditorium last week, Are You
Now Or Have You Ever Been?, a
play taken from the transcripts of
the House Un-Arrjerican Ac
tivities hearings (HUAC), played
to receptive capacity crowds.
The renewed interest in the
blacklistings comes about natur
ally, I suppose, as we step back
year by year, carefully destroy
ing both our heroes and our
pariahs in the wake of the tidal
wave of Watergate. Now that
we've torn apart the Kennedy
Administration, making him a
lecher in the bedroom, the time
has come to move onto the '50s
and bigger and better things
(Churchill and Eisenhower fol
low in the sprfngtime)
While both The Front and Are
You Now Or Have You Ever
Been? provide telescopic views
of the hysteria that gripped the
nation, David Halpern. (r.'s
documentary Hollywood On
Trial provides a brilliant over
view of the era. from the time its
seeds were sown during the
I loover Administration until the
harvest was reaped (if such an
association of productivity is
appropriate) in the 19505.
Not to say that the witch hunts
ended in the 19505. In a chilling
epilogue, narrator John Huston
intones that even today, twenty
years later, children of
blacklisted personnel are being
refused work, and that some
people refused to participate in
the making of the film for fear of
repercussions.
And the late Dalton Trumbo.
who won a screenwriting Oscar
under an assumed name, asserts
in the film that that is indeed
true, except that he believes that
those on the right wing side of
the blacklistings are having
trouble finding employment.
This revelation is unintention
ally underscored by a shift to the
next interview, in which former
Covernor Ronald Reagan speaks
about his role in the proceedings
as a representative of the Screen
Actors Cuild.
Halpern skillfully edited to
gether historical footage from
the 1920s and 19305, weaving it
with newsreel coverage of the
HUAC hearings and contempor
ary interviews.

The documentary is helpful in
pointing out that there were ac
tually two peaks of the witch
hunts — those in the late '40s
(also touched upon in The Way
We Were during which writers
who refused to comply with the
HUAC were imprisoned) and
those in the early '50s. during
which Senator Joseph McCarthy
pursued the menace most voc
iferously.
Those testifying in the film in
clude actors Cary Cooper and

Larry Parks (whose career was
subsequently demolished):
studio chiefs Louis B. Mayer,
Jack Warner and Walt Disney;
director Sam Wood and FBI
chief ). Edgar Hoover.
Screen personalities inter
viewed in the past two years in
clude Otto Preminger, C.ale Son
dergaard (winner of the first Best
Supporting Actress Oscar), Ring
Lardner, Jr. (author of
M*A*S*H), Edward Dmytryk

(director of The Qiine Mutiny),
Walter Bernstein (author of The
Front), Martin Kitt (director of
The Front) and Zero Mostel,
among others.
With its comprehensive
analytical view, Hollywood On
Trial is an important, worth
while film whose contribution to
history cannot he denied.
