SATURDAY. NOV. 13: I'm a firm believer that a
film should be; considered as an artwork, inde
pendent of its original literary source, and there
fore I won't mention that Milos Forman's film.
One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, is a vile,
wretched, blasphemous, and thoroughly debas
ing rendition of Ken Kesey's novel. To be fair,
nonetheless, it does stand as <1 very powerful film,
effective and engrossing. It also contains some of
the finest acting in several years, especially

among the supporting players, i must admit, it's a
modern classic. 7 & 9:30, Mem Aud. $1 . . .

Lively Arts series is the Guarneri Beethoven Cy
cle, performed in six concerts, the first of which is

TUESDAY, NOV. 16: Pasolini's bawdy and frolic
some film, The Decameron, is a personal transla
tion of eight Boccacio stories set in the Middle
Ages. The director's obsession with sexual frivol
ity tends to obliterate any profounder substance,
but does make for entertainment. Pasolini's
cameo appearance as the Italian artist, Giotto, is a
pleasant touch. 7 & 9:30, Kresge. $1 . . .
WEDNESDAY. NOV. 17: (1 hope they don't forget
to print you again. Wednesday . . . ) The controv
ersial, but generally detested, Bertrand Mlier film,
