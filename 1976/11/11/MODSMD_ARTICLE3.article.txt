# Visiting scholar's analysis
## African situation 'revolutionary' 
### Karen Knowles 
Southern Africa represents a re
volutionary situation exacerbated by
numerous conflicts, said black activist
and visiting scholar F'rof. Walter Rod
ney yesterday afternoon in Meyer
Forum Room.
Analyzing the Southern Africa situ
ation, Rodney noted that racial con
frontation and white domination came
about as a result of capital and said that
racism and colonialism are outdated.
Analysis of Southern Africa is not
simple, he said. Every contradiction is

represented there.
The first conflict is that between the
white colonizers and the colonized
blacks who are uprising and reclaim
ing their land from the white settlers.
Rodney described the Republic of
South Africa as a "subimperialism,"
an international island which serves
imperialism while defending white
social classes.
According to Rodney, the depen
dence on exploited mine, farm and rail
workers for the creation of capital rep
resents a class contradiction.

When one grasps the contradictions
as a totality, Southern Africa is au
tomatically a revolutionary situation,
asserted Rodney. Each conflict is suffi
cient cause for revolution, but to
gether, they are explosive.
He compared the situation to the
overthrow of czarist Russia.
Rodney said the enemy in Southern
Africa is exploiting, oppressive im
perialism which can not justify its own
existence. Colonialism breeds
nationalism as masses struggleagainst
their oppressors, creating nationalistic
feelings, he said.
Rodney contended that racism is an
integral part of the imperialist, colo
nial state and that it decides who has
access to surplus, who works where
and who can rise. Progressive, Marxist
writers say that transnational corpo
rations are at the helm of exploitation,
but, unlike Rodney, they do not cite
them as the most important problem or
the basis of exploitation.
U.S. involvement
Rodney claims that the U.S. stepped
into Africa as a "neo-colonist" police
force, ensuring the continuation of
colonialism when European im
perialists were unable to do so. The
U.S. acts as a broker trying to resolve
the confrontation, he said. However,
colonialism does not end when one
colonist withdraws and tries to hand
power over to a "neo-colonist," Rod
ney added.
People,of the third world recognize
that the struggle against colonialism
and "neo-colonialism" are insepara
ble. They cannot fight one. then the
other, he said.
Rodney offered two views of foreign
intervention popular with many Afri
cans. First, the nationalistic Pan-
Africans want to keep both the U.S.
and the U.S.S.R. out of Africa and let
the Africans do it themselves. Mean
while, the International Marxists fear
both capitalistic and Soviet im

perialism and believe the latter is the
greater threat.

Rodney disagreed with both views.
He asserted that the Pan-African view
contradicts its premises. The U.S. is
already entrenched in Africa and can
only be removed with the aid of non
capitalistic countries and their arms.
The second view is incorrect, said
Rodney, because it makes absolutes of
relative features, making dogmatic
situations from those that depend on
