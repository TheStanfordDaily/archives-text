Court grants execution request
Salt Lake City — The Utah Supreme Court re
versed itself yesterday and granted the request of
convicted murderer Clary Gilmore that he be al
lowed to face a firing squad next Monday rather
than spend the rest of his life in prison.
The court acted on a 4-1 decision after a hearing
in which Gilmore appeared personally to ask that
he be allowed to die "like a man."
The justices on Monday stayed Gilmore's execu
tion by a :j-2 decision. Their two-paragraph deci
sion yesterday granted a motion by Gilmore's new
attorney to withdraw the appeal filed by two
court-appointed attorneys Gilmore had fired.
"The stay of execution heretofore granted is
withdrawn and vacated and any appeal filed on
behalf of Gary Gilmore is dismissed forthwith," the
court said.
In a dissenting opinion, Justice P. Frank Wilkins
said legal problems remain to be resolved.
I lowever, there remained the possibility of inter
vention by other parties in attempts to halt the
execution.
The American Givil Liberties Union of Utah has
indicated it might take court action, if necessary, to
stop the execution.
Court observers said it was the first time in mem
ory a defendant has been allowed to plead before
the court, rather than have attorneys make the ap
pearance.
No one has been executed in the United States
since 1967.
Carter preparing for White House
St. Simons Island, Ga. — President-elect Jimmv
Carter neared the end of his study-and-play vaca
tion here with a flurry of announcements that in
cluded the names of 11 members of his transition
team staff, who probably will eventually land jobs
in the new administration.
In other moves connected with the impending
change in government, it was announced that Car
ter will have daily intelligence briefings from the
Central Intelligence Agency, that he will meet with
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and that a U.S.
Signal Corps communications center is being set
up at his home in Plains, Ga.
Carter and his family are to leave the secluded
island estate where they have been vacationing and
return to Plains today. In a talk with reporters, Car
ter said the post-election escape had been satisfac
tory.
Study of staff-written notebooks on foreign and
defense policy have proved useful, he said, for pre
paring to meet with kissingerand also with Ford. It
was the first time he confirmed plans to meet with

the secretary of state, whose policies he criticized
during the campaign. No date tor either meeting
has been chosen.
Syrians take over Beirut unopposed
Beirut. Lebanon — Syrian tanks and troops de
scended on embattled Beirut from three directions
yesterday in a swift occupation designed to extin
guish the 19-month civil war. Housewives and
shopkeepers waved from balconies and cheered
from open windows.
Shelling between the Moslem and Christian sec
tions of the city continued right up until the arrival
of the Syrians, now acting as the vanguard of pan-
Arab peacekeeping forces.
The Syrians swept through east, north and south
Beirut, but left Moslem and Christian militias and
Palestinian guerrillas still face-to-face along tin:
central Beirut front.
Lebanese military sources working as liaison
with the Syrians estimated 5000 Syrian soldiers
took part in the move on Beirut, with at least 100
tanks and an equal number of armored personnel
carriers.
The unopposed Syrian takeover of Beirut marked
the first time the Lebanese capital has been oc
cupied by a foreign power since U.S. Marines
landed here in 1958 to stop another civil war.
Accident creates ethical dilemma
Denver — Linda Culbertson, whose brain stop
ped two days ago, died yesterday and so did her
unborn baby that doctors had tried to save.
The doctors had agreed that to continue life
support efforts was unwarranted but a hospital
spokesman, Kric Munson, said the fetal heartbeat
ceased before life support equipment was discon
nected.
Culbertson, whose brain died in a two-car acci
dent Monday, was put on life-support machinery
which sustained her other bodily functions.
Doctors studied the legal, ethical, moral and
medical questions of trying to save the life of her
15-week-old fetus by keeping the 29-year-old wo
man's body functioning for five more weeks, until
the baby could be delivered.
Doctors originally received Culbertson at Col
orado General Hospital as a potential organ donor,
but the life-support measures were undertaken
after the fetal heartbeat was detected.
Rhodesian compromise foreseen
Geneva, Switzerland — Rhodesian black
nationalists declared yesterday that they would
continue to insist upon achieving full indepen
dence! under black majority rule within 12 months.

But diplomatic sources in Washington said most
of the black leaders privately are prepared to accept
a transition period of 18 months as a compromise to
break the current deadlock in the Geneva confer
ence.
The Washington sources, who have behind-the
scenes contact with both white and black Rhode
sian negotiators, said neither side wishes to see the
conference fail, leading to stepped-up fighting in
Rhodesia.
Robert Mugabe, leader of the largest group of
black Rhodesian guerrillas based on Mozambique,
was asked whether he and Joshua Nkomo said they
were willing to shelve the independence dateques
tion at least temporarily and move on to some other
issue.
"You mean postponing our independence?
Nada, nada, camarada (nothing doing, comrade),"
Mugabe replied, partly in Portuguese.
In Washington, U.S. officials and diplomatic
sources privately indicated considerable optimism
about prospects for movement in the Geneva con
ference.
They suggested that a date for independence can
be worked out through the British and that once it is
accepted the other items on the agenda can be taken
up with less discord.
Moroccans seek return of Jews
Rabat, Morocco — The Moroccan government —
acting alone in the entire Arab world — has em
barked on a campaign to persuade some 230,000
Moroccan-born Jews to return from Israel, France,
the United States and other countries to share in the
future prosperity of their "real homeland."
Officials said about 1000 Jews have returned this
year and several hundred more are expected early
in the New Year.
Morocco has no antidiscrimination laws and
Islam is the official state religion. But Moroccan
officials say that a Jewish minority has lived in
peace and harmony among the Moroccan popula
tion since biblical times and was never subject to
persecution. Tensions between the communities
arose only when newly independent Morocco
joined the Arab front against Israel.
Moroccan officials say they are encouraged by
the small but growing response to the king's invita
tion. They try to give the returning Jews a particu
larly friendly welcome in the hope that they will
encourage friends and relatives to follow them.
