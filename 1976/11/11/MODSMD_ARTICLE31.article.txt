# 'Human rights key to foreign policy'
## 
### Tim Reagan 
Human rights play an important, al
though not dominant, role in. U.S.
foreign policy in Latin America, ac
cording to William Luers, assistant
secretary of state for inter-American af
fairs.
Luers spoke of the state depart
ment's efforts to increase human rights
considerations in foreign policy to
about 40 persons in Jordan Hall last
night.
Luers referred to three U.S. laws
which define the human rights role in
its foreign policy. The first forbids the
U.S. to offer military assistance to
"countries demonstrating gross viola
tions of human rights."
Two others establish the position
that economic aid should go to coun
tries guilty of human rights violations
only if such aid would serve to remedy
the violations. The U.S. is required to
vote accordingly on al 1 Inter-American
Development Bank loans in com
pliance with the new Hawkins
Amendment.
"The U.S. should place in the fore
front of its foreign policy values ad
vocating human rights," said Luers.
Public: opinion and congressional in
terest are pushing the state department
toward this philosophy, he said.
"Now, 20 per cent to 30 per cent of
my time is spent on issues related to
human rights."
There has been an addition of a
coordinator for human rights (Jim Wil
son) in the state department and

human rights officers have been added
to each of five of the nation's regional
bureaus. Ambassadors are encouraged
to devote attention to individual cases
as well as general ones.
In an attempt to explain why the
state department is not doing more to
promote human rights in Latin
America, Luers cited the growing pol
icy of non-intervention with regard to
Latin America.
"There is a limited degree to which
we as a nation can bring about change
in other nations." he said.
"Less than four per cent of our GNP
is allocated to foreign aid. I'm worried
that we may be entering a new era of
moralization when the world needs
our resources rather than our ideas."
