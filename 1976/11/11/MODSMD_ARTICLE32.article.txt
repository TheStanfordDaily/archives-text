Fund raiser to leave
Long time administrator Kenneth
Cuthbertson will be leaving the uni
versity at the end of the current
academic year, he confirmed yester
day.
Cuthbertson, vice president for de
velopment, has worked with fund rais
ing here for 18 years. He is resigning in
favor of a lower pressure position. He
is presently engaged in a university

campaign to raise $300 million for cap
ital projects.
Correction
In yesterday's Daily, the story titled
"Trustees Close Searsville Lake"
should have read, "This is the first
time the university has used this op
tion," referring to the use of debt
financing to finance the renovation of
the history corner.
