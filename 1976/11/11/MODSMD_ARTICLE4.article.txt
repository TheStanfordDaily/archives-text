## Frats search for bonfire bucks 
### Arlene Kishi Staff writer 
The annual pre-Big Game Bonfire
will brighten the night sky on Nov. 19
if the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
can raise the necessary funds within
two days, said IFC President Jordan
Schwartz yesterday.
"We are organizing a late but inten
sive fund drive directed toward any
one who might possibly be interested
in supporting the bonfire — alumni
groups, local businesses," Schwartz
explained. "The difference between
what we've got and what we need is
substantial."

The bonfire itself, and its proposed
budget of $1200, was approved by the
IFC by a vote of 11-1, with one
house abstaining. The budget figure is
double the amount spent last year be
cause the IFC is receiving almost no
thing as far as free services. The tele
phone poles used for the fire must be
purchased this year since the tele
phone company has none to give away
as they did last year.
Tightened security will entail hiring
eight to nine policemen.
Volunteer fraternity members will
also police the area.
"It's tough to get something of this

scale going so late," said Schwartz.
"We're setting a deadline for final de
termination of the bonfire for Friday.
It's going to be tight, and it's just my
hope we can pull it off."
Nevertheless, thtj fraternities are
planning to guard White Plaza for a
couple of days before the game to keep
an eye on Cal vandals who are plan
ning to deface the area.
"We'll set up a couple of kegs in
White Plaza and get some frat mem
bers to keep the Cal people from get
ting out of hand." said Schwartz.
Meanwhile, ecologists were voicing
their dissension. "I feel that the bonfire
is an anachronism, a past tradition
that's worn out by now. It's a symbol of
an ecological arrogance," said James
Sayre, former Stanford graduate stu
dent in engineering and head of Ecol
ogy Action of Menlo Park.
He added that they have not been
able to prevent the fire in their deal
ings with the IFC.
He suggested an alternate activity
such as a rock concert in the lakebed,
which would be an "equally impres
sive thing: just an all-night party be
fore the Big Game."
Sayre claimed a 1972 study by a Palo
Alto engineering firm revealed that the
bonfire released "4.H tons of air pollut
ants, particulant matter (dust and car
bon), organics (partially burned hyd
rocarbons) and carbon monoxide."

Although this year's bonfire will
consume only clean-burning wood,
"it's only a marginal difference,"
Sayre said.
"We will have a cleaner fire this year
and we're trying to take in the con
cerns of environmentalists," Schwartz
maintained. "The bonfire itself is not
that much of a pollutant, but it is a
symbol of pollution and it is from that
that the opposition stems. We can re
duce its pollution effect and we are
trying to do that this year."

He added that they have not been
able to prevent the fire in their deal
ings with the IFC.
He suggested an alternate activity
such as a rock concert in the lakebed,
which would be an "equally impres
sive thing: just an all-night party be
fore the Big Game."
Sayre claimed a 1972 study by a Palo
Alto engineering firm revealed that the
bonfire released "4.H tons of air pollut
ants, particulant matter (dust and car
bon), organics (partially burned hyd
rocarbons) and carbon monoxide."

Although this year's bonfire will
consume only clean-burning wood,
"it's only a marginal difference,"
Sayre said.
"We will have a cleaner fire this year
and we're trying to take in the con
cerns of environmentalists," Schwartz
maintained. "The bonfire itself is not
that much of a pollutant, but it is a
symbol of pollution and it is from that
that the opposition stems. We can re
duce its pollution effect and we are
trying to do that this year."


Big fire
Back in the days before smog and pollution (when kids
could be kids), Big Game bonfires were of epic propor-

tions — like this one in the fall of 1971. Of course,
those were also the days when Stanford went to the
Rose Bowl. Oh well.
The annual pre-Big Game Bonfire
will brighten the night sky on Nov. 19
if the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
can raise the necessary funds within
two days, said IFC President Jordan
Schwartz yesterday.
"We are organizing a late but inten
sive fund drive directed toward any
one who might possibly be interested
in supporting the bonfire — alumni
groups, local businesses," Schwartz
explained. "The difference between
what we've got and what we need is
substantial."

The bonfire itself, and its proposed
budget of $1200, was approved by the
IFC by a vote of 11-1, with one
house abstaining. The budget figure is
double the amount spent last year be
cause the IFC is receiving almost no
thing as far as free services. The tele
phone poles used for the fire must be
purchased this year since the tele
phone company has none to give away
as they did last year.
Tightened security will entail hiring
eight to nine policemen.
Volunteer fraternity members will
also police the area.
"It's tough to get something of this

scale going so late," said Schwartz.
"We're setting a deadline for final de
termination of the bonfire for Friday.
It's going to be tight, and it's just my
hope we can pull it off."
Nevertheless, thtj fraternities are
planning to guard White Plaza for a
couple of days before the game to keep
an eye on Cal vandals who are plan
ning to deface the area.
"We'll set up a couple of kegs in
White Plaza and get some frat mem
bers to keep the Cal people from get
ting out of hand." said Schwartz.
Meanwhile, ecologists were voicing
their dissension. "I feel that the bonfire
is an anachronism, a past tradition
that's worn out by now. It's a symbol of
an ecological arrogance," said James
Sayre, former Stanford graduate stu
dent in engineering and head of Ecol
ogy Action of Menlo Park.
