# Udall seeks passage of vetoed bills

Washington (AP) â€” Rep. Morris
Udall says Jimmy Carter could get off
to a quick start in the presidency by
pushing for passage of some of the bills
that were never enacted or fell victim
to President Gerald Ford's vetoes.
"If I were he," Udall said, "I would
take the half-dozen most outrageous
Ford vetoes of bills that have been de
bated and finely honed and say let's do
these in February and March. Pick
something that has been pawed over
and is finely tuned and is ready to roll
and put it on the road and move it.
Udall, who was runner-up to Carter
in t he race for the Democratic nomi na
tion, said Carter's relationship with
Congress is not yet clear.
"Carter to the very end was not all
that specific on the issues," the
Arizona Democrat said.
"I suspect that by the middle of next
year there are going to be some loud
yells and some complaints."
The consumer groups believe he is
on their side and many business
people supported him because they
believed he would back their side,
Udall said.
But Carter starts off with a big advan
tage, he said.
"We've got a president of our party
in the White House. There's a strong
disposition to work with him, a dis
position to give him the benefit of the
doubt, a disposition to help him out
wherever we can and make his presi
dency a success."
Udall said he believed initial reports
that Carter would have trouble with
Congress were overblown. Whatever
fault there was, he said, was because of
inexperience and an Atlanta-based
campaign which took pride in not
being in Washington.
But he said Carter will need people
who know about Congress and the in
fluence of special interst groups if he is
to avoid big mistakes.
