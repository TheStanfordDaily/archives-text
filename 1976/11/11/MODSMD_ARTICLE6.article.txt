# Commune residents want court hearing
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Two residents of The Land will ask
the Santa Clara Superior Court tomor
row to stay or vacate its decision to
grant police protection to landowner
Alyce Burns when she decides to de
molish their homes.
Mark Schneider and Rohyn Wesley,
long-time residents of the commune
located on Page Mill Road near
Skyline Drive, have filed a memoran
dum with the court listing five reasons
why it should hold a hearing concern
ing the status of The I,and. which has
been the focus of a long-standing own
ership dispute between businessman
Donald Eldridge of Atherton and
Burns.
The residents, who were originally
not a party to the suit against Palo Alto
brought by Burns' attorneys last week,
were allowed to intervene in this case
because they said they would be "ir
reparably harmed" by the court's deci
sion.
Last week's court decision found
that the commune's homes, which
house approximately 50 residents,
were in violation of the city's building

code and stated that police protection
would he given to Burns when she de
cides to demolish the homes.
Arguments
The residents will argue that:
—they have a right to intervene in
the case because they would be "ir
reparably harmed" by the demolition.
—they had been denied due process,
involving th? right to notice and a
hearing.
—they were, in effect, being evicted
without a jury trial to which they con
sider themselves entitled.
—the court had no right to order an
action affecting them without their
participation in the case, and
—there has been alleged collusion
between Burns and the city to reach
the decision that was made in court
last week.
Schneider said he thought it was
"very likely" that the judge would at
least order a stay of the demolition to
morrow. He added that curiosity on
the part of citizens about The band's
lifestyles may make the holding of a
hearing more likf'lv
Frank Cliff. Fldridge's attorney, was
critical of Burns' suit Against the city,
calling it "a rather obvious attempt to
bypass the other two litigations."
The litigations are a suit Eldridge
brought against the city asking com
pensation for the damages he claims
he suffered as a result of rezoning of
the property to an open space classifi
cation in 1972 and a suit between El
dridge and Burns over ownership of
the property.
Cliff remarked that "Eldridge is not
involved in the Friday proceeding,
and he doesn't plan to enter it."

critical of Burns' suit Against the city,
calling it "a rather obvious attempt to

The litigations are a suit Eldridge
brought against the city asking com

Two residents of The Land will ask
the Santa Clara Superior Court tomor
row to stay or vacate its decision to
grant police protection to landowner
Alyce Burns when she decides to de
molish their homes.
Mark Schneider and Rohyn Wesley,
long-time residents of the commune
located on Page Mill Road near
Skyline Drive, have filed a memoran
dum with the court listing five reasons
why it should hold a hearing concern
ing the status of The I,and. which has
been the focus of a long-standing own
ership dispute between businessman
Donald Eldridge of Atherton and
Burns.
The residents, who were originally
not a party to the suit against Palo Alto
brought by Burns' attorneys last week,
were allowed to intervene in this case
because they said they would be "ir
reparably harmed" by the court's deci
sion.
Last week's court decision found
that the commune's homes, which
house approximately 50 residents,
were in violation of the city's building

code and stated that police protection
would he given to Burns when she de
cides to demolish the homes.
Arguments
The residents will argue that:
—they have a right to intervene in
the case because they would be "ir
reparably harmed" by the demolition.
—they had been denied due process,
involving th? right to notice and a
hearing.
—they were, in effect, being evicted
without a jury trial to which they con
sider themselves entitled.
—the court had no right to order an
action affecting them without their
participation in the case, and
—there has been alleged collusion
between Burns and the city to reach
the decision that was made in court
last week.
Schneider said he thought it was
"very likely" that the judge would at
least order a stay of the demolition to
morrow. He added that curiosity on
the part of citizens about The band's
lifestyles may make the holding of a
