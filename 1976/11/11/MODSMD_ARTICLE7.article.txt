# Move capital to mountains

There are several good reasons for
moving the capital of the United States
to Colorado, or to some other relatively
isolated and picturesque place in the
Rocky Mountains, perhaps Wyoming
or Montana.
First, it would put the capital closer
to more people. It would mean that
congressmen and senators as a group
would have less traveling to do, which
would save them time and save us tax
|)ayers money. It would also mean that
constituents (pleased or irate) could
more easily visit their representatives
in order to express their pleasure or
displeasure with their behavior and
other important issues.
Secondly, we could make the new
capital, which could be called Colum
bia. much smaller than the old one.
This would help eliminate hundreds
of thousands of unnecessary bureau
crats who now do useless things and
worse at taxpayers' expense.
The massive government buildings
in the eastern city now serving as the
national capital could be converted
into residences for the people who are
now wretchedly housed in the slums
of that city and in numerous other
dreadful slums back east.
Emotional pollution
A third, and perhaps the most im
portant, consideration is that govern
ment officials who liveand work in the
Rockies, surrounded by lots of trees
.indmountains,would develop and ex
press in their governance a totally dif
ferent set of principles than city folk
trapped in the decaying ruins of an
urban civilization collapsing under
the weight of its crowding, traditional
stuffiness and physical and emotional
pollution.
It would be a fresh start tor Ameri
ca's third century, :r. ! it would be a
fresh start begun in fresh an.
Finally, relocating the n«.i.onal capi
tal would provide the '.ppoitunity for
architectural innovations in the design
and construction of new public build
ings. New departures in monumental
architecture would be possible, or
perhaps, in accordance with the prin
ciple of "small is beautiful." the new,
smaller government could shelter its
more efficiently organized personnel
«ind policies in a scattering of attrac
tive geodesic domes, zomes.yurts and
other ecologically pleasing structures.
Moving a capital is not without pre-

cedent, and in fact has happened often
in the history of this and other coun
tries, as a geographic compromise oras
a sign and effect of shifting popula
tions, wealth and influence. King
David of ancient Israel established his
new capital in centrally located
Jerusalem to satisfy contending north
ern and southern factions who wanted
it built in their own areas. Philadel
phia and then New York were capitals
of the United States in its early days,
until 1800, when the District of Col
umbia (made up of swampy land con
tributed by Maryland and Virginia),
was established as the new capital in
the untamed wilderness, like
Jerusalem, to give equal priority and
access to all of the newly uni ted states.
The District of Columbia then lay at
the center of the nation. That nation
now extends 3000 miles to the West of
that original territory, and its (geo
graphic, economic, demographic and
cultural) center now lies closer to the
Continental Divide than it does to the
Atlantic Ocean.
Bicentennial move
It would be exceedingly approp
riate, in this bicentennial year, to begin
thinking seriously about moving the
administrative and governmental cap
ital west, along with the population,
the wealth, the culture and the energy
that have already moved toward the
Pacific.
If Brazil can build a capital out of
nothing in the wilderness at Brasilia,
and if Alaska can relocate its capital
from Juneau, which once stood at the
center of its commerce and social life
(during the gold rushes to the Yukon
around the turn of the century), to Wil
low, which now lies at the center of its
recent, more northerly growth and
prosperity, then certainly a conscious
and thoughtful United States can
move its government and administra
tive capital to a location more central
to its people, its mission and its hopes
in the last fourth of the 20th century.
President-elect Jimmy Carter has
spoken much of reorganizing the fed
eral government. What better way to
do it then by setting it up in a new
place, where what is unnecessary can
be left behind, and what is new, best,
and most effective can take root in
fresh soil?
