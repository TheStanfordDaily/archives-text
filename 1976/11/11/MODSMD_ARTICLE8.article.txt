# Racial policies

Before Henry Organ subjects us to
any more of his vacuous harangue on
minority admissions ("Minority Ad
missions." Daily Nov. 8), I suggest that
he actually think about the complex
moral and legal issues raised by "be
nign discrimination."
James Nickel's "Preferential
Policies in Hiring and Admissions: A
Jurisprudential Approach" (Columbia
Law Review. April 1975, pp. 5.34-558)
provides a useful moral framework
with which to begin one's analysis of
this highly emotional and controver
sial problem.
Disregarding Organ's ad hoc legal
history, emotionalism and his statisti
cal speculation, the only relevant
reason he gives for continuing prefe
rential racial policies is that of social
utility: "Minority students would have
been of greater social utility to minor
ity communities than those white to
society in general who are admitted by
the defeat of minority programs."
But this is only a claim, not an argu
ment. Perhaps Organ hopes that the
mere mention on "social utility" will
conjure up the strong altruist senti-

merits of Millian utilitariansim. But
even if aroused, such sentiments can
not provide a sufficient justification in
light of pervasive modern criticism
leveled against the notion of social
utility as a conception of social justice.
From the liberal point of view, John
Rawls' A Theory of Justice sufficiently
demonstrates the inadequacies of
utilitarianism. From the libertarian
point of view, Robert Nozick has de
vastated all collectivist conceptions of
social justiceâ€”of which utilitarianism
is just one (Anarchy, State, and
Utopia, Ch. 7, "Distributive Justice").
Thus I suggest that Organ think twice
before he uncritically dredges up this
dated nineteenth century notion
again.
DeFunis and Bcikke present serious
questions about the justice of our in
stitutions. but we cannot hope to get
clear on these complex issues, let
alone solve them, if we resort to the
inveterate sophistries provided by the
likes of Organ. Hopefully, the Daily
will seek more cogent discussions of
these issues in the future.
