# 'Mac's' moves on campus, but without golden arches
## 
### Lonnie Rosenwald 
Come spring, the aroma of Big Macs and quarterpoun
ders will waft throughout the campus.
Twenty thousand empty bellies grumble in anticipation of
the grand opening of but another McDonald's restaurant,
at the Stanford Shopping Center.
The Bay Area division of McDonald's hopes to open the
doors of its new location, on the walkway behind the
Emporium, in March 1977. Because of its proximity to the
campus, McDonald's expects to attract many diners from
the university community.
"We will strive to get the student trade," declared Mike
Kinkaid, senior supervisor of McDonald's Bay Area Cor
poration. Kinkaid added that the company intends "to get
involved as much as possible" with the university.
He foresees the possibility of "promotional" free meals
for university athletic teams, and mentioned football,
swimming, and water polo teams as areas of interest.
Swimming coach Jim Gaughran said he had not re
ceived such offers from any McDonald's restaurant.
The new McDonald's is being designed by the Los
Angeles architectural firm of J. Paul Dodd, and it will
forego the traditional golden arches and brick motifs to
conform to the design theme of the shopping center. A
"free design, not following the plan of a normal
McDonald's," will be applied to the interior, which will

accomodate about 150 people.
According to national college surveys conducted for
McDonald's, the typical student order at McDonald's con
sists of a quarter pounder or a Big Mac and fries.
McDonald's has never surveyed the character of the mar
ket here, but kincaid says their advertisers are working on
it.
With shoppers and employes of the shopping center as
"the main thrust" of the intended market, kincaid said the
company would nevertheless advertise heavily in campus
publications. He hopes the student population will con
sume a significant portion of the 2000 hamburgers an
average McDonald's operation turns out daily.
Around campus, reaction to the news of the future
McDonald's was mixed.
"If it was a 24-hour place, it would be a godsend." said
one late-nighter.
Others, however, were not pleased. "There's enough
junky food on El Camino already," complained one stu
dent.
Ed Birmingham, assistant manager of Tresidder's
Transition, was not concerned about competition from the
new McDonald's.
"People would have to get in their cars and drive there,"
he said. "Most of our business is from students on cam
pus."

McDonald's has never surveyed the character of the mar
ket here, but kincaid says their advertisers are working on
it.
With shoppers and employes of the shopping center as
"the main thrust" of the intended market, kincaid said the
company would nevertheless advertise heavily in campus
publications. He hopes the student population will con

average McDonald's operation turns out daily.
Around campus, reaction to the news of the future
McDonald's was mixed.
"If it was a 24-hour place, it would be a godsend." said
one late-nighter.
Others, however, were not pleased. "There's enough
junky food on El Camino already," complained one stu

Ed Birmingham, assistant manager of Tresidder's
Transition, was not concerned about competition from the
new McDonald's.
"People would have to get in their cars and drive there,"
he said. "Most of our business is from students on cam

Stanford Shopping Center is slated to have its very
own McDonald s, which will open in March 1977. This will be situated behind the Emporium. However, this
McDonald s is planned to have a capacity of 150, and McDonald's will be without the familiar golden arches.
Come spring, the aroma of Big Macs and quarterpoun
ders will waft throughout the campus.
Twenty thousand empty bellies grumble in anticipation of
the grand opening of but another McDonald's restaurant,
at the Stanford Shopping Center.
The Bay Area division of McDonald's hopes to open the
doors of its new location, on the walkway behind the
Emporium, in March 1977. Because of its proximity to the
campus, McDonald's expects to attract many diners from
the university community.
"We will strive to get the student trade," declared Mike
Kinkaid, senior supervisor of McDonald's Bay Area Cor
poration. Kinkaid added that the company intends "to get
involved as much as possible" with the university.
He foresees the possibility of "promotional" free meals
for university athletic teams, and mentioned football,
swimming, and water polo teams as areas of interest.
Swimming coach Jim Gaughran said he had not re
ceived such offers from any McDonald's restaurant.
The new McDonald's is being designed by the Los
Angeles architectural firm of J. Paul Dodd, and it will
forego the traditional golden arches and brick motifs to
conform to the design theme of the shopping center. A
"free design, not following the plan of a normal
McDonald's," will be applied to the interior, which will

accomodate about 150 people.
