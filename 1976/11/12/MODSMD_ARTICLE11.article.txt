On Feb. 14, 1976, a symposium was
held here on the "crisis in Angola."
Though speakers with leftist and
nationalist perspectives were clearly
under-represented, the viewpoints
aired in this forum were rather broad.
Perhaps even more interesting than
the symposium was the write-up it re
ceived on the front page of the Daily
(Feb. 17). The Daily article — totally
biased — focused almost solely on the
speech made by William Schaufele,
assistant secretary of state for African
affairs.
In doing this, the story further prop
agated State Department propaganda,
in regard both to the nature of the An
golan conflict and of U.S. involvement
in Angola. It lent legitimacy to the
most reactionary statement made at
the forum.
No aspirations
For example, Schaufele said, "the
U.S. has no aspirations in Angola" —
when, in fact, U.S. multinational cor
porations, the State Department and
the military all had aspirations there —
and the Daily reported it as if it were
truth.
Similarly, he said that the struggle
between the various "liberation
movements" in Angola was an ethnic
struggle, or "tribal war" (one is to as
sume the racist myth: blacks under
stand neither politics nor economics),
and the Daily reported it as truth.
Finally, he claimed that the United
States did not get involved in Angola
until January 1975, after the Soviet
buildup (as if. for example, Roberto
Holden, head of the U.S.-backed
F.N.L.A., hadn't been on the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) payroll for
15 years), and, again, the Daily article
implied this was gospel.
'Rhodesia'
This is like taking lan Smith's word
on "Rhodesia."
I give this example from "close to
home" because it helps to illuminate a
major point: that whatever good the
"mainstream" press in the United
States does (e.g., uncovering Water
gate), in its reporting of "news" in
"third world" countries, it generally

serves the interests of the ruling politi
cal and economic group(s).
To grasp the full implications of this
assertion, one must understand that
today, for the first time in human his
tory, the various people of the world
are, in a fundamental sense, united —
united via the world capitalist system
(even the socialist countries form part
of this network, for they are part of the
world capitalist market).
Not equal partners
Also, we must understand that all
the world's nations (and sectors within
nations) are not equal partners in this
network. There is the dominating
"center" (the United States and
Canada, Western Europe, Japan, etc.)
and there is the dominated
"periphery" (including the great
majority of the peoples of non
communist Asia, Latin America and
Africa).
An interesting question has to do
with how the asymmetrical relations
within the world capitalist system are
maintained.
Ultimately, such relations are re
produced by force, and, conversely, it
is generally only force that can break
them asunder. This is no secret. Every
body knows it — from the most con
servative (e.g., Reagan) to the most rad
ical (e.g., Mao).
Manipulating consensus
But these relations are also main
tained via the use of ideology, via the
manipulation — as Marcuse would put
it — of consensus, via the social con
struction of reality, via the "coopera
tion" of the press.
Now, normally this is not ac
complished by way of some "conspi
racy among the ruling classes," as
naive, dogmatic "Marxists" suppose.
Rather, and 1 do not have space to
elaborate on this, it ultimately derives
from the fact that the very structure
and dynamics of the capitalist social
formation mystifies and distorts the
capital-labor relation, in a way similar
to the mystification and distortion
Marx attributes to the capitalist mode
in his classic work, Dus Kapital.
And then, there is that added di
mension: racism.
Vietnam reports
One is reminded of the news reports
concerning the war in Vietnam, espe
cially those preceding the anti-war
movement. I remember thinking, as a
teenager, that, if the casualty figures
reported by the press were true, every
"commie" in Vietnam was being kil
led twice over, while heroic Ameri
cans were managing to dodge nearly
every bullet.
The current reports in the
"mainstream" U.S. press on the
"Rhodesian" (i.e., Zimbabwean) situa
tion are almost equally interesting in
terms of their ideological content. We

are told that government in Zimbabwe
is being given to the black citizens of
that country — the only problem being
that of working out the arrangements
for the transfer of power.
Nothing without struggle
The truth is that nothing is being
conceded that has not been won
through struggle.
We are also supposed to believe that
the most salient issue in Zimbabwe
(Rhodesia), has to do with something
Kissinger keeps calling "majority
rule." The real issue is simple: will the
oppressed peoples of Zimbabwe
achieve economic and political inde
pendence, or will they be subjected to
further strangulation via neo
colonialism?
Not insignificantly, the "Kissinger
plan" — which the press keeps laud
ing — would, if adopted, virtually as
sure such strangulation.
Another interesting example of the
role of U.S. "mainstream" press in re
producing the distorted portrayal of
events (especially, those of a "progres
sive" nature) in the "third world," is
its recent coverage of the Chinese situ
ation after Mao's death. Still another
was their portrayal of events in Chile,
during and after Allende.
Equally guilty
Incidentally, such reproduction of
ideology is not confined to the Ameri-

can press, but is characteristic of the
press in the "center." For example, the
British press is equally guilty.
But none of this discussed here is
new news. When, on inner-city streets
— streets themselves reflecting the
uneven development of the capitalist
world system even within its core —
U.S. blacks rebelled against racial and
class oppression during the 19605, the
bourgeois press called them "rioters"
and "vandals,"and frequently implied
that their actions were instigated by
"outside agitators," by "communists."
The bourgeois press in South Af
rica recently similarly characterized
black rebellion in that nation.
In terms of the propagation of ideol
ogy, one of the prime functions of the
"mainstream" press is that of attribut
ing to external causes the impetus for
rebellion of internal con
tradictions. If no external cause can be
conjured up, a fictitious internal cause
(genes for rioting?) may do just as well.
But don't take my word on anything
stated here. Read newspapers from
other parts of the world, including
some from socialist countries. Travel.
Open your eyes. Step outside the
social-construction-of-reality via
the-press.

ical (e.g., Mao).
Manipulating consensus
But these relations are also main
tained via the use of ideology, via the
manipulation — as Marcuse would put
it — of consensus, via the social con
struction of reality, via the "coopera
tion" of the press.
Now, normally this is not ac
complished by way of some "conspi
racy among the ruling classes," as
naive, dogmatic "Marxists" suppose.
Rather, and 1 do not have space to
elaborate on this, it ultimately derives
from the fact that the very structure
and dynamics of the capitalist social
formation mystifies and distorts the
capital-labor relation, in a way similar
to the mystification and distortion
Marx attributes to the capitalist mode
in his classic work, Dus Kapital.
And then, there is that added di
mension: racism.
Vietnam reports
One is reminded of the news reports
concerning the war in Vietnam, espe
cially those preceding the anti-war
movement. I remember thinking, as a
teenager, that, if the casualty figures
reported by the press were true, every
"commie" in Vietnam was being kil
led twice over, while heroic Ameri
cans were managing to dodge nearly
every bullet.
The current reports in the
"mainstream" U.S. press on the
"Rhodesian" (i.e., Zimbabwean) situa
tion are almost equally interesting in
terms of their ideological content. We

are told that government in Zimbabwe
is being given to the black citizens of
that country — the only problem being
that of working out the arrangements
for the transfer of power.
Nothing without struggle
The truth is that nothing is being
conceded that has not been won
through struggle.
We are also supposed to believe that
the most salient issue in Zimbabwe
(Rhodesia), has to do with something
Kissinger keeps calling "majority
rule." The real issue is simple: will the
oppressed peoples of Zimbabwe
achieve economic and political inde
pendence, or will they be subjected to
further strangulation via neo
colonialism?
Not insignificantly, the "Kissinger
plan" — which the press keeps laud
ing — would, if adopted, virtually as
sure such strangulation.
Another interesting example of the
role of U.S. "mainstream" press in re
producing the distorted portrayal of
events (especially, those of a "progres
sive" nature) in the "third world," is
its recent coverage of the Chinese situ
ation after Mao's death. Still another
was their portrayal of events in Chile,
during and after Allende.
Equally guilty
Incidentally, such reproduction of
ideology is not confined to the Ameri-

can press, but is characteristic of the
press in the "center." For example, the
British press is equally guilty.
But none of this discussed here is
new news. When, on inner-city streets
— streets themselves reflecting the
uneven development of the capitalist
world system even within its core —
U.S. blacks rebelled against racial and
class oppression during the 19605, the
bourgeois press called them "rioters"
and "vandals,"and frequently implied
that their actions were instigated by
"outside agitators," by "communists."
The bourgeois press in South Af
rica recently similarly characterized
black rebellion in that nation.
In terms of the propagation of ideol
ogy, one of the prime functions of the
"mainstream" press is that of attribut
ing to external causes the impetus for
rebellion of internal con
tradictions. If no external cause can be
conjured up, a fictitious internal cause
(genes for rioting?) may do just as well.
But don't take my word on anything
stated here. Read newspapers from
other parts of the world, including
some from socialist countries. Travel.
Open your eyes. Step outside the
social-construction-of-reality via
the-press.

On Feb. 14, 1976, a symposium was
held here on the "crisis in Angola."
Though speakers with leftist and
nationalist perspectives were clearly
under-represented, the viewpoints
aired in this forum were rather broad.
Perhaps even more interesting than
the symposium was the write-up it re
ceived on the front page of the Daily
(Feb. 17). The Daily article — totally
biased — focused almost solely on the
speech made by William Schaufele,
assistant secretary of state for African
affairs.
In doing this, the story further prop
agated State Department propaganda,
in regard both to the nature of the An
golan conflict and of U.S. involvement
in Angola. It lent legitimacy to the
most reactionary statement made at
the forum.
No aspirations
For example, Schaufele said, "the
U.S. has no aspirations in Angola" —
when, in fact, U.S. multinational cor
porations, the State Department and
the military all had aspirations there —
and the Daily reported it as if it were
truth.
Similarly, he said that the struggle
between the various "liberation
movements" in Angola was an ethnic
struggle, or "tribal war" (one is to as
sume the racist myth: blacks under
stand neither politics nor economics),
and the Daily reported it as truth.
Finally, he claimed that the United
States did not get involved in Angola
until January 1975, after the Soviet
buildup (as if. for example, Roberto
Holden, head of the U.S.-backed
F.N.L.A., hadn't been on the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) payroll for
15 years), and, again, the Daily article
implied this was gospel.
'Rhodesia'
This is like taking lan Smith's word
on "Rhodesia."
I give this example from "close to
home" because it helps to illuminate a
major point: that whatever good the
"mainstream" press in the United
States does (e.g., uncovering Water
gate), in its reporting of "news" in
"third world" countries, it generally

serves the interests of the ruling politi
cal and economic group(s).
To grasp the full implications of this
assertion, one must understand that
today, for the first time in human his
tory, the various people of the world
are, in a fundamental sense, united —
united via the world capitalist system
(even the socialist countries form part
of this network, for they are part of the
world capitalist market).
Not equal partners
Also, we must understand that all
the world's nations (and sectors within
nations) are not equal partners in this
network. There is the dominating
"center" (the United States and
Canada, Western Europe, Japan, etc.)
and there is the dominated
"periphery" (including the great
majority of the peoples of non
communist Asia, Latin America and
Africa).
An interesting question has to do
with how the asymmetrical relations
within the world capitalist system are
maintained.
Ultimately, such relations are re
produced by force, and, conversely, it
is generally only force that can break
them asunder. This is no secret. Every
body knows it — from the most con
servative (e.g., Reagan) to the most rad
ical (e.g., Mao).
Manipulating consensus

On Feb. 14, 1976, a symposium was
held here on the "crisis in Angola."
Though speakers with leftist and
nationalist perspectives were clearly
under-represented, the viewpoints
aired in this forum were rather broad.
Perhaps even more interesting than
the symposium was the write-up it re
ceived on the front page of the Daily
(Feb. 17). The Daily article — totally
biased — focused almost solely on the
speech made by William Schaufele,
assistant secretary of state for African
affairs.
In doing this, the story further prop
agated State Department propaganda,
in regard both to the nature of the An
golan conflict and of U.S. involvement
in Angola. It lent legitimacy to the
most reactionary statement made at
the forum.
No aspirations
For example, Schaufele said, "the
U.S. has no aspirations in Angola" —
when, in fact, U.S. multinational cor
porations, the State Department and
the military all had aspirations there —
and the Daily reported it as if it were
truth.
Similarly, he said that the struggle
between the various "liberation
movements" in Angola was an ethnic
struggle, or "tribal war" (one is to as
sume the racist myth: blacks under
stand neither politics nor economics),
and the Daily reported it as truth.
Finally, he claimed that the United
States did not get involved in Angola
until January 1975, after the Soviet
buildup (as if. for example, Roberto
Holden, head of the U.S.-backed
F.N.L.A., hadn't been on the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) payroll for
15 years), and, again, the Daily article
implied this was gospel.
'Rhodesia'
This is like taking lan Smith's word
on "Rhodesia."
I give this example from "close to
home" because it helps to illuminate a
major point: that whatever good the
"mainstream" press in the United
States does (e.g., uncovering Water
gate), in its reporting of "news" in
"third world" countries, it generally

serves the interests of the ruling politi
cal and economic group(s).
To grasp the full implications of this
assertion, one must understand that
today, for the first time in human his
tory, the various people of the world
are, in a fundamental sense, united —
united via the world capitalist system
(even the socialist countries form part
of this network, for they are part of the
world capitalist market).
Not equal partners
Also, we must understand that all
the world's nations (and sectors within
nations) are not equal partners in this
network. There is the dominating
"center" (the United States and
Canada, Western Europe, Japan, etc.)
and there is the dominated
"periphery" (including the great
majority of the peoples of non
communist Asia, Latin America and
Africa).
An interesting question has to do
with how the asymmetrical relations
within the world capitalist system are
maintained.
Ultimately, such relations are re
produced by force, and, conversely, it
is generally only force that can break
them asunder. This is no secret. Every
body knows it — from the most con
servative (e.g., Reagan) to the most rad
ical (e.g., Mao).
Manipulating consensus
But these relations are also main
tained via the use of ideology, via the
manipulation — as Marcuse would put
it — of consensus, via the social con
struction of reality, via the "coopera
tion" of the press.
Now, normally this is not ac
complished by way of some "conspi
racy among the ruling classes," as
naive, dogmatic "Marxists" suppose.
Rather, and 1 do not have space to
elaborate on this, it ultimately derives
from the fact that the very structure
and dynamics of the capitalist social
formation mystifies and distorts the
capital-labor relation, in a way similar
to the mystification and distortion
Marx attributes to the capitalist mode
in his classic work, Dus Kapital.
And then, there is that added di
mension: racism.
Vietnam reports
One is reminded of the news reports
concerning the war in Vietnam, espe
cially those preceding the anti-war
movement. I remember thinking, as a
teenager, that, if the casualty figures
reported by the press were true, every
"commie" in Vietnam was being kil
led twice over, while heroic Ameri
cans were managing to dodge nearly
every bullet.
The current reports in the
"mainstream" U.S. press on the
"Rhodesian" (i.e., Zimbabwean) situa
tion are almost equally interesting in
terms of their ideological content. We

are told that government in Zimbabwe
is being given to the black citizens of
that country — the only problem being
that of working out the arrangements
for the transfer of power.
Nothing without struggle
The truth is that nothing is being
conceded that has not been won
through struggle.
We are also supposed to believe that
the most salient issue in Zimbabwe
(Rhodesia), has to do with something
Kissinger keeps calling "majority
rule." The real issue is simple: will the
oppressed peoples of Zimbabwe
achieve economic and political inde
pendence, or will they be subjected to
further strangulation via neo
colonialism?
Not insignificantly, the "Kissinger
plan" — which the press keeps laud
ing — would, if adopted, virtually as
sure such strangulation.
Another interesting example of the
role of U.S. "mainstream" press in re
producing the distorted portrayal of
events (especially, those of a "progres
sive" nature) in the "third world," is
its recent coverage of the Chinese situ
ation after Mao's death. Still another
was their portrayal of events in Chile,
during and after Allende.
Equally guilty
Incidentally, such reproduction of
ideology is not confined to the Ameri-

can press, but is characteristic of the
press in the "center." For example, the
British press is equally guilty.
But none of this discussed here is
new news. When, on inner-city streets
— streets themselves reflecting the
uneven development of the capitalist
world system even within its core —
U.S. blacks rebelled against racial and
class oppression during the 19605, the
bourgeois press called them "rioters"
and "vandals,"and frequently implied
that their actions were instigated by
"outside agitators," by "communists."
The bourgeois press in South Af
rica recently similarly characterized
black rebellion in that nation.
In terms of the propagation of ideol
ogy, one of the prime functions of the
"mainstream" press is that of attribut
ing to external causes the impetus for

tradictions. If no external cause can be

network. There is the dominating
"center" (the United States and
Canada, Western Europe, Japan, etc.)
and there is the dominated
"periphery" (including the great
majority of the peoples of non
communist Asia, Latin America and
Africa).
An interesting question has to do
with how the asymmetrical relations
within the world capitalist system are
maintained.
Ultimately, such relations are re
produced by force, and, conversely, it
is generally only force that can break
them asunder. This is no secret. Every
body knows it — from the most con
servative (e.g., Reagan) to the most rad
ical (e.g., Mao).
Manipulating consensus
But these relations are also main
tained via the use of ideology, via the
manipulation — as Marcuse would put
it — of consensus, via the social con
struction of reality, via the "coopera
tion" of the press.
Now, normally this is not ac
complished by way of some "conspi
racy among the ruling classes," as
naive, dogmatic "Marxists" suppose.
Rather, and 1 do not have space to
elaborate on this, it ultimately derives
from the fact that the very structure
and dynamics of the capitalist social
formation mystifies and distorts the
capital-labor relation, in a way similar
to the mystification and distortion
Marx attributes to the capitalist mode
in his classic work, Dus Kapital.
And then, there is that added di
mension: racism.
Vietnam reports
One is reminded of the news reports
concerning the war in Vietnam, espe
cially those preceding the anti-war
movement. I remember thinking, as a
teenager, that, if the casualty figures
reported by the press were true, every
"commie" in Vietnam was being kil
led twice over, while heroic Ameri
cans were managing to dodge nearly
every bullet.
The current reports in the
"mainstream" U.S. press on the
"Rhodesian" (i.e., Zimbabwean) situa
tion are almost equally interesting in
terms of their ideological content. We

are told that government in Zimbabwe
is being given to the black citizens of
that country — the only problem being
that of working out the arrangements
for the transfer of power.
Nothing without struggle
The truth is that nothing is being
conceded that has not been won
through struggle.
We are also supposed to believe that
the most salient issue in Zimbabwe
(Rhodesia), has to do with something
Kissinger keeps calling "majority
rule." The real issue is simple: will the
oppressed peoples of Zimbabwe
achieve economic and political inde
pendence, or will they be subjected to
further strangulation via neo
colonialism?
Not insignificantly, the "Kissinger
plan" — which the press keeps laud
ing — would, if adopted, virtually as
sure such strangulation.
Another interesting example of the
role of U.S. "mainstream" press in re
producing the distorted portrayal of
events (especially, those of a "progres
sive" nature) in the "third world," is
its recent coverage of the Chinese situ
ation after Mao's death. Still another
was their portrayal of events in Chile,
during and after Allende.
Equally guilty
Incidentally, such reproduction of
ideology is not confined to the Ameri-

can press, but is characteristic of the
press in the "center." For example, the
British press is equally guilty.
But none of this discussed here is
new news. When, on inner-city streets
— streets themselves reflecting the
uneven development of the capitalist
world system even within its core —
U.S. blacks rebelled against racial and
class oppression during the 19605, the
bourgeois press called them "rioters"
and "vandals,"and frequently implied
that their actions were instigated by
"outside agitators," by "communists."
The bourgeois press in South Af
rica recently similarly characterized
black rebellion in that nation.
In terms of the propagation of ideol
ogy, one of the prime functions of the
"mainstream" press is that of attribut
ing to external causes the impetus for
rebellion of internal con
tradictions. If no external cause can be
conjured up, a fictitious internal cause
(genes for rioting?) may do just as well.
But don't take my word on anything
stated here. Read newspapers from
other parts of the world, including
some from socialist countries. Travel.
Open your eyes. Step outside the
social-construction-of-reality via
the-press.
