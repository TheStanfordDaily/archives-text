# Patty Hearst asks for transfer
## 
### 
San Diego (AP) â€” Patricia
Hearst was quoted Thursday as
saying she asked to leave the
Pleasanton Federal Correctional
Institution to escape heroine
worshipping younger inmates.
The San Diego Union reported
that the newspaper heiress com
plained that male inmates, pro
fessing support for the Sym
bionese Liberation Army, tried
to rally behi nd her at Pleasanton.
Miss Hearst, serving a seven
year sentence for bank robbery,
was taken Tuesday from the
Northern California prison to
San Diego's top-security Met
ropolitan Correctional Center.
The Union said she talked
about the transfer to a man who
asked that he not be identified in
the newspaper.
"She wanted nothing to do
with the young inmates' cause,"

the source said. "For that reason,
she wanted to be isolated from
them.
"She was a heroine to the kids
because of her SLA background.
She just wanted to be left alone
to do her time, that's all."
The 22-year-old heiress told
him, he said, that she was unable
to convince prison authorities to
isolate her from the admirers.
Thus, he said, she began trying
to accumulate enough discipli
nary reports so they would have
to put her in segregated status or
in an administrative detention
status.
On four occasions, the source
said Miss Hearst told him, she
was reported for refusing to per
form work assignments." Au
thorities said she had been as
signed janitorial duties in her
dormitory.
In Los Angeles, attorney Al-

Bert Johnson said Wednesday
that his client asked to be trans
ferred because of numerous
death threats and was "upset to
the point where she was dis
traught."
Prison officials in San Diego
say only that she requested the
transfer from Pleasanton, where
she was taken after her sentenc
ing Sept. 24. She was convicted
March 20 of armed bank robbery
committed while she was in the
SLA, the group that kidnapped
her.
In San Diego, Miss Hearst has
been assigned such duties as
cleaning her room and helping
other inmates in the common
room and kitchen. Associate
Warden George Rodgers said.
Her room is on the same hospi
tal floor in which she was held
for psychiatric examinations be
fore her sentencing in San Fran

cisco.
Rodgers said Miss Hearst was
not in isolation and has normal
access to the corridor and
kitchen on her floor. No special
precautions have been taken for
her safety, he said.
The only other prisoner well
known to the public is Lynette
"Squeaky" Fromme, the Charles
Manson family member serving
a life sentence for attempting to
assassinate President Ford in
Sacramento on Sept. 5, 1975.
Rodgers said she is being held on
a different floor from Miss
Hearst.
