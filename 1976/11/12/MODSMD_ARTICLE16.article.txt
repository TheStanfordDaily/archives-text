## 
### Marc Strassman 
The head of the California
chapter of the American Cancer
Society has called smoking "the
number one public health
hazard in the world" and has cal
led for immediate and long
range steps to reduce its inci
dence.
Robert Jamplis, a clinical pro
fessor of surgery at the Med
Center and the head of the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic, called at
tention in an interview yester
day to the plans of the society's
California chapter for "TheCreat
American Smokeout" to be held
on November 18. 1976. The goal
of the "smokeout" is to persuade
at least one million of the five
million cigaret smokers in
California to give up their habit
for at least one day.
"Not many will give it up
permanently," said Jamplis,
"but it will point out to those
who don't stop the real monkey
on their backs."
He also mentioned efforts by a
National Task Force of the
American Cancer Society in its
"Target 5" program to achieve
three major anti-smoking goals:
—to reduce adult smoking by 25
per cent (from 50 million
nationwide to 37.5 million):
—to reduce teenage smoking by
50 per cent (from 9 million
nationwide to 4.5 million),
—to reduce by 50 per cent the
tar, nicotine, and other toxic
agents in cigarettes.
Jamplis, who as a chest sur
geon sometimes operates on
cancer-diseased lungs,
amplified his statement that
smoking is the world's leading
health hazard by listing in the
order of their frequency the let
hal diseases caused by this self
destructive behavior. The dis
eases are
—heart attacks

—emphysema
—lung cancer (battling for sec
ond place with emphysema)
—other cancers (including those
of the mouth, esophagus, and
pancreas)
Jamplis said that the tobacco
was "worried about" efforts to
ban smoking in public spaces,
but that it had $300 million to

spend annually on advertising,
while the American Cancer Soc
iety has "only a couple of
hundred thousand dollars, cer
tainly less than one million."
He also stressed the impor
tance of reaching down as iar as
the kindergarten level to indoc
trinate children with anti
smoking attutudes.

three major anti-smoking goals:
—to reduce adult smoking by 25
per cent (from 50 million
nationwide to 37.5 million):
—to reduce teenage smoking by
50 per cent (from 9 million
nationwide to 4.5 million),
—to reduce by 50 per cent the
tar, nicotine, and other toxic
agents in cigarettes.
Jamplis, who as a chest sur
geon sometimes operates on
cancer-diseased lungs,
amplified his statement that
smoking is the world's leading
health hazard by listing in the
order of their frequency the let
hal diseases caused by this self
destructive behavior. The dis
eases are
—heart attacks

—emphysema
—lung cancer (battling for sec
ond place with emphysema)
—other cancers (including those
of the mouth, esophagus, and
pancreas)
Jamplis said that the tobacco
was "worried about" efforts to
ban smoking in public spaces,
but that it had $300 million to

spend annually on advertising,
while the American Cancer Soc
iety has "only a couple of
hundred thousand dollars, cer
tainly less than one million."
He also stressed the impor
tance of reaching down as iar as
the kindergarten level to indoc
trinate children with anti
smoking attutudes.
