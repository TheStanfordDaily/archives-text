# NBC not to appeal 'family hour' ruling
## 
### 
New York (AP) — In a major split in the legal battle over televi
sion's "family hour" policy, NBC said yesterday it won't appeal a
federal court decision that declares the policy unlawful as part of
the National Association of Broadcasters' code of standards.
CBS, which pushed for adoption of the policy by the industry,
and ABC last week each said they'd appeal the Nov. 4 decision on
"family viewing" by U.S. District Court Judge Warren J. Ferguson
in Los Angeles.
There was no immediate comment from CBS or ABC on NBC's
decision against joining them in an appeal against Ferguson's
ruling.
The ruling doesn't ban a ' family viewing" policy by broadcas
ters, only its use as an industry-wide requirement for membership
in the NAB, to which the three networds and over 400 TV stations
belong.
Ferguson ruled that the networks and the NAB violated the First
Amendment in adopting the "family viewing" policy and did so
under pressure from the Federal Communications Commission.
NBC, in a statement here, said Ferguson's decision "is a clear and
strong prohibition against government interference with broadcast
program scheduling.
"NBC agrees with this principle and will not seek reversal of that
ruling."
It said the decision "also emphasizes the right and duty of broad
casters to exercise independent judgement in determining the
suitability of programs for particular time periods.
"We regard this as a reaffirmation of broadcasters' independence
to make program determinations on the basis of their own respon
sibility."
The NAB's "family viewing" policy says programs deemed in
appropriate for viewing by a general audience shouldn't be aired
early at night by networks and local stations.
It applies to shows aired by networks in the first prime time hour
each night and the immediately preceding local hour.
