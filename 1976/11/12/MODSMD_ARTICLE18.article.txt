# New concepts in technology, science
## Wind vehicle to open new era? 
### Marc Strassman 
A Sevastopol inventor and so
cial theorist has developed a
solar-and-wind powered land
vehicle which he claims can at
tain speeds of 55 mph in a
12-mph crosswind and which he
expects will be available in a
tour-passenger model costing
around $4,500 by the middle of
1977.
He hopes to produce in accor
dance with economic concepts
developed by his partner which
he thinks will make possible a
resolution of the long-lamented
conflict between unemployment
and inflation and a transcen
dance of apparent conflicts bet
ween capitalism and socialism.
Mark Goldes, investor of the
vehicle and the president of
Sunwind Limited, which holds
the patents on it, said his firm
has signed an agreement in prin
ciple with the Great Outdoor
Boat Gompany of San Rafael to
produce the conveyance under
license from Sunwind.
Goldes said that there are no
major technical problems stand
ing in the way of producing the
vehicle, which is featured on the
cover of this month's Popular
Science, but that there are finan
cial ones. "We've been looking
everywhere to find money," he
said.
Negotiations are now going on
with one other company in the
United States, as well as two
each in Ganada. Sweden, and

Australia, and five in England.
He also said he is "aiming at
(producing) a motorized tricy
cle" employing the sunwind
principles that will cost $1,000
in kit form and have a cruising
speed of 30 mph.
He said that the sunwind veh
icle will eventually be available
in "kit form, completed form, or
as plans," from which individu
als can construct and modify the
streamlined conveyances. He
said he expected that many of
the completed vehicles will be
"team-built," according to a sys
tem developed in Sweden which
seems to reduce feelings of alie
nation among workers who
would otherwise work as part ot
an assembly line.
Goldes said that he hoped
production of the vehicle would
employ some of the
"philosophic positions" about
economics developed by him
and his co-worker, economist
Bob Edmonds. Edmonds'
analysis, according to Goldes,
has shown that the concentra
tion of ownership of productive
facilities "is not primarily an
ethical problem, but an
economic problem."
Edmonds' studies, said
Goldes, showed that concentra
tion of ownership is a principle
cause of unemployment, and
suggests as a remedy the spread
ing of ownership to a firm's
workers, under a program such
as the Employee Stock Owner

ship Plan (ESOF) proposed by
San Francisco lawyer Louis
Kelso.
Goldes also said that Edmonds
recommends insured bank loans
up to a high proportion of a
worker's salary, in order to allow
employes to buy substantial
amounts ot stock in the com
panies they work for. Under
such a system, individual work
ers could eventually own up to
$50,000 worth of stock by the
time they were 50 years old (with
a couple therefore owning
$100,000). This would allow at
least half of their income at this
point to come from the stock,
and would, according to Goldes,
allow them to spend more of
their time in the freely-chosen
play that Herbert Marcuse, a
teacher of Goldes at Brandeis,
differentiated from toil in his
book Eros and Civilization.
Goldes also said he is submit
ting to Washington, D.G., tor
consideration by the new Garter
Administration proposal to
parallel and then replace the
existing "big tax credit for capi
tal investment" with an
employment credit.
Goldes also said that Ed
monds' work had been closely
paralleled by research by the
Czechoslovakian theoretician
Ota Sik and the Israeli Abraham
Zamir, all of which were describ
ing a global evolution towards
post-capitalist, post-socialist

stage of economic development
that involves the concept of
worker control of the corpora
tion. This "new stage" of
economic evolution, said
Goldes, can be called either "dis
tributive capitalism" or "pro
ductive socialism." This con
vergence and transcendance of
existing forms of economic or
ganization, says the inventor,
more accurately reflects the
"real world situation" than the
superficial "areas of disagree
ment" now dividing East and
West.
Goldes is hoping that a sig
nificant impetus towards this
evolution will come from wide
spread use of his wind vehicle
which, he points out, doesn't use
any energy that has to be paid
for, and can be paid for "from the
money you save on gas."
