# Budget-cutting goal in sight: Bacchetti
## 
### Bill Sing Staff writer 
It appears that the university will
achieve its goal of financial equilib
rium during the next two years of the
Budget Equilibrium Program, accord
ing to Raymond Bacchetti, vice pro
vost for budget and planning.
Because of this success, said Bac
chetti, "there is no cause for believing
that we need to cut budgets further for
1977-78."
The Budget Equilibrium Program
was initiated in October 1974 to
achieve a budget balance between the
rate of expenditure increases (such as
salaries, library acquisitions, operat
ing costs), and the rate of income in
creases (such as tuition, endowments,
gifts). An amount of $10,000,000, cal
led the "gap," was set up as a target for
cumulative income increases and ex
pense reductions.
Unexpected increases in utilities
and other costs have raised the gap to
$10,525,000, said Bacchetti. The uni
versity expects to achieve $10,390,000
of tins, "enough to come sufficiently
close to that gap that we are within the
range of estimation error," said Bac
chetti.
'Quite extraordinary'
"It's fair to say that we have ac
complished something quite extraor
dinary," Bacchetti told the Faculty Se
nate yesterday. "There is still un
finished business in closing the gap,
and I don't want to let our success to
date obscure the fact there is still un
finished business.
"On the other hand," continued
Bacchetti, "1 don't want the fact that
there's still unfinished business take
away from the fact that we ought to
take considerable pride" in bringing
this institution to a position of "con
siderably greater financial stability
than six or seven years ago."
But among the university's long
range financial assumptions is a con
tinued growth in tuition rates, said
Provost William Miller.
The university is assuming an in
crease in the real growth rate of tuition
of 4.2 per cent, according to Miller.
When added to the assumed inflation
rate factor of six percent, this means an
actual increase of 10.2 per cent annu
ally.
Other assumptions
Other assumptions include a total
return on endowments of 5.3 per cent

added to inflation (11.>3 per cent) an
nually for the next five years, and an
nual increases in faculty salaries start
ing at 6Vz per cent annually for next
year, leveling off at six per cent for the
subsequent two years, and increasing
to eight per cent annually for 1980-81
and 1981-82.
These assumptions are used in mak
ing long-range calculations, said Mil
ler, and one should not draw too sharp
conclusions from them.
These assumptions form the basics
for identifying "key problems" which
could "push us out of equilibrium,"
said Miller.
Tuition increases
Tuition increases are one such prob
lem, he said.
"We recognize that a real growth in
tuition of 4.2 per cent above inflation is
not likely to hold up for a very long
period of time," said Miller.
It is clear that we will have to slow
the rate of growth of tuition in the
years ahead, said Miller, especially to
compete with other private institu
tions.
President Richard Lyman pointed
out that tuition is the only real source
of income that the university can con
trol by its own decisions.
The university can't just "decide" to
get more gift money, said Lyman. Tui
tion thus "tends to bear an ever-larger
proportion of costs" to the university,
he added.
"There is a competition between
growth rates in tuition and growth
rates in salaries, and the enhancement
and improvement of academic prog
rams," said Miller. "We don't know
how it's going to come out."
"We do know that we have to be
diligent in our efforts to operate more
efficiently and take advantage of the
resources we have," he added.
Energy costs
Increasing energy costs present
another key problem, said Miller.
Projected increases for utilities costs
are estimated at 35 per cent for 1977-
78, said Miller. As a result of this rapid
increase, some new energy measures
will be taken in the coming year, he
indicated.
Another key problem is the high rate
of library acquisitions, which the uni
versity must maintain to keep up with
the growth in newly-published mate
rials.
