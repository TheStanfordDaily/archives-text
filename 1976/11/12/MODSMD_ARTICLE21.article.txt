# New trend in accuracy hits college catalogs
## 
### 
Lake Forest, 111. (AH) — Tui
tion will go up. the social life
isn't the best and neither is the
library. Transportation is a prob
lem and the history department
offers only bare bones courses
for a major.
This is what Barat College, a
four-year Catholic women's in
stitution, has begun telling
prospective students in an at
tempt to make its catalog more
accurate.
Funded by a $23,000 grant
from the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare, Barat
produced what it tells applicants
is "a new, experimental way of
presenting the complete and ac

curate information you need to
choose a college."
It promises to bare all, good as
well as bad, and it tells applic
ants its accuracy was audited by
three higher education
specialists from Syracuse Uni
versity.
Her is a sampling:
—Library: "The on-campus book
collection isn't the
greatest. . . Aesthetically the lib
rary is a beautiful place, but as a
place to study or do research it
has shortcomings."
—History: "Lamentable de
cline of interest in historical
studies experienced at
Barat;. . . department retains

bare bones of major while intro
ducing survey courses for non
majors."
—Music Department: ". . . Major
itself will soon be phased out.
Cood courses for nonmajors."
— Biology: "Two-person de
partment offering traditional
major . . .Courses reported to be
tough. . . Lab facilities good,
equipment holdings rated fair."
—Social Life: "Regarded as a
weakness. . . Some students feel
they don't get out, meet men and
date enough here; they note Fri
day night events tend to be up
and down in quality. . . 'Barat
isn't the best place around to
meet Mr. Wonderful.' one stu

dent remarked."
Theodore Marchese, Barat's
director ot institutional research
and project director for the new
catalog, said the prospectus rep
resents the latest development in
the "consumer-protection
movement."
It is designed, he said, to "tell
students as much about Barat as
we ask them to tell Barat about
themselves."
"Our assumption is that the
potential student is a mature
adult who wants relevant facts
and opinions about a college be
fore making the important deci
sion to enroll." Marchese said.
In addition to listing potential

drawbacks of the institution, the
prospectus details financial in
formation that goes beyond list
ing only tuition and fees, which
at Barat, are $2,410.
Totaling up all costs, includ
ing "dance students who must
have leotards and shoes," year
long expenses for 1976-1977 for
most full-time resident students
will be about $4,700. the pros
pectus says.
The prospectus also includes
critical excerpts from the review
committee of the North Central
Association of Colleges and Sec
ondary Schools, the Midwest's
main accrediting agency, and
invites anyone to inspect the full
report at the student library.
The prospectus also lists stu
dents' best- and least-liked fea
tures of the college.

tions that received the HEW
grants and one of two which so
far has completed the project.
