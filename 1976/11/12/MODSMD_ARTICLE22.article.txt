# New IRS forms to be more difficult
## 
### 
Washington (AF) — It you
thought it was tough filling out
your income tax form last year,
wait until you see the new 1040.
The Internal Revenue Service
released copies of the new tax
form Thursday with a message
from IRS Commissioner Donald
C. Alexander that "completing
your return this year could be
more difficult."
The new 1040 has about half a
dozen differences from the 1975
form with the major change re
quiring all taxpayers to turn to
mathematical skills to compute
taxable income. This one change
alone has IRS preparing to look
for more arithmetic mistakes by
taxpayers than last year, accord
ing to an IRS spokesman.
There were a number of
changes also in the short form,
1040 A, released several weeks
ago.
In the past, many taxpayers
using form 1040 had only to to
tal up all of their income to ar
rive at an adjusted gross income
figure and then refer to special
tables to read their tax bills.
But the 1976 Tax Reform Act
has replaced that system with
one that requires all taxpayers to
find their adjusted gross in
comes in one of several steps.

Then they subtract either stan
dard or itemized decutions, and
personal exemptions, to find
what is known as taxable income
before determining what the tax
bill is.
A second complicating
change on the new form involves
the credit for personal exemp
tions. For 1975 this was a
straight $30 subtraction oft taxes
for each taxpayer and depen
dent.
This year, however, the credit
is raised to $35 and to calculate
which is greater: the $35-per
person or 2 per cent of taxable
income up to a maximum of

$180 for most taxpayers, and $90
for those who are married but t i 1«;
separately.
This calculation alone has
added two lines to the 1040.
Taxpayers can expect to re
ceive their forms in the mail a
couple of weeks later than usual
because of late passage of the
Tax Reform Act. Alexander said
the IRS is aiming for a mid-
January postal delivery date for
the forms, which generally have
been in home mailboxes in past
years shortly after Jan. 1.
Among other changes found
on the basic 1040 form:
—Deletion of the sick pay in

come exclusion, which has been
replaced by a more restrictive
disability income exclusion.
—A line for a credit for child care
expenses.
—Simplication and broadening
of the tax credit allowed for tax
payers 65 years or older. The
new credit replaces the often
confusing retirement income
credit computation.
As usual, in his opening mes
sage, Alexander has advised all
taxpayers that if the forms prove
too complex to work out. tax
payers can receive free advice
and help from anv office of the
IRS.
