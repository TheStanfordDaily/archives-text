Sacramento (AP) — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said Thursday he
made a rare appearance at a ceremonial event — a Veterans' Day
gathering — because the day "recalls sacrifices" made in the past.
Brown said in the future the country might be called to make
further sacrifices — a frequent theme of his "era of limits" speeches
— but he was not specific about what he meant.
But the 38-year-old governor said the United States always man
ages to surmount these problems with the armed forces "on the
forefront" in defense of the "mighty" country.
After Brown's speech, B.T. Collins, Brown's lobbyist in the state
Senate who lost a hand and leg in the Vietnam War, read a selection
from war correspondent Ernie Fyle on death during war.
"The tragic thing we all remember on Veterans' Day that there
was one portion of America that decided to go and do that which
had to be done," Collins said.
When Brown was asked later by reporters why he agreed to
attend the kind of ceremonial event he usually spurns, he said: "I
think it's important to recognize Veterans' Day. It is a ceremony
that has meaning to a number of people."
