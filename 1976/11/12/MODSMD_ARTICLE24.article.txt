## Cross country, field hockey regionals begin here Harriers host Pac-8s 
### Bruce Anderson 
An assortment of Olympians,
All-Americans and
international-caliber freshmen
will assemble at the second tee
on the Stanford Golf Course to
morrow at 11 a.m. for the NCAA
District-8 Cross Country Qual
ifying meet.
Saturday's top four teams
qualify for the NCAA Cross
Country Championships Nov. 22
at North Texas State in Denton,
Tex. In addition, the top eight
finishers not running for one of
those four teams will receive at
large berths in the NCAA meet.
The 10,()()()-meter race tomor
row will also serve as the confer
ence title meet for the Pacific-8
and the Pacific Coast Athletic
Association.
Washington State, the defend
ing Pac-8 champion, and Ore
gon, which defeated WSU two
weeks ago in the Pac-8 Northern
Division meet, are favored to
fight for the District-8 title. But
their battle is not just one of
competing runners. It is one of
competing philosophies about
t he recruiting of foreign athletes.
Kenyan trio
Washington State's Kenyan
trio of Henry Rono, Joshua
Kimetoand Samson Kimombwa
ran off with the first three places
at the division meet. But Oregon
freshmen Alberto Salazar and
Rudy Chapa led the Ducks' con
tingent of All-Americans Dave
Taylor and Terry Williams,
sophomore Don Clary and U.S.
Olympian Matt Centrowitz, to a

sweep of six of the next seven
places. The Ducks edged VVSU's
"Afrika Korps,"
Despite the Oregon victory,
Duck coach Bill Dellinger com
plained two days later that older
foreign runners were dominat
ing American collegiate dis
tance running competition.
"I'm not opposed to foreign
runners; we've had our share
here at Oregon," Dellinger was
quoted as saying. (Pete Spir, a
top Oregon runner, is Canadian.)
"Hut what's happening now is
that older athletes are given a
scholarship for what amounts to
a vacation in the United States.
They are dominating things
now."
Nothing new
WSII coach John Chaplin said,
"The traditional track powers
have always used foreigners, but
when schools like East Tennes
see State and Western Kentucky
became distance running pow
ers by importing whole teams
from Ireland and Creat Britain it
began to gnaw on the guys who
were on top already."
Dellinger, whose Oregon
teams won national collegiate
cross country titles in 1973 and
1974, directed his comments at
the large number of Kenyans
running in the United States.
The "Afrika Korps" won the
Pac-8 title last year. At theNCAA
meet, however, the Cougars
were runnerups to Texas-El
Paso, whose Kenyan imports
were faster than Washington
State's.
Ail-American
Two weeks ago the Cougars
ran without All-American Kurt
Beckman. His presence could
play a large part in determining
the outcome of tomorrow's race.
Stanford's hopes lie with cap
tain Jeff Norton, who has been
the team's only consistent per
former. His most recent finish
was a fifth-place effort in the
Pac-8 Southern Division meet.
Seniors Frank Boutin and Jeff
Parietti run their last cross coun
try race for the Cardinals tomor
row. Coach Marshall Clark will
probably round out his line-up
with sophomore Jerry Emory,
junior Stacy Geiken, junior Greg
Eger and freshman Bill Halde
man.

and the Pacific Coast Athletic
Association.
Washington State, the defend
ing Pac-8 champion, and Ore
gon, which defeated WSU two
weeks ago in the Pac-8 Northern
Division meet, are favored to
fight for the District-8 title. But
their battle is not just one of
competing runners. It is one of
competing philosophies about
t he recruiting of foreign athletes.
Kenyan trio
Washington State's Kenyan
trio of Henry Rono, Joshua
Kimetoand Samson Kimombwa
ran off with the first three places
at the division meet. But Oregon
freshmen Alberto Salazar and
Rudy Chapa led the Ducks' con
tingent of All-Americans Dave
Taylor and Terry Williams,
sophomore Don Clary and U.S.
Olympian Matt Centrowitz, to a

sweep of six of the next seven
places. The Ducks edged VVSU's
"Afrika Korps,"
Despite the Oregon victory,
Duck coach Bill Dellinger com
plained two days later that older
foreign runners were dominat
ing American collegiate dis
tance running competition.
"I'm not opposed to foreign
runners; we've had our share
here at Oregon," Dellinger was
quoted as saying. (Pete Spir, a
top Oregon runner, is Canadian.)
"Hut what's happening now is
that older athletes are given a
scholarship for what amounts to
a vacation in the United States.
They are dominating things
now."
Nothing new
WSII coach John Chaplin said,
"The traditional track powers
have always used foreigners, but
when schools like East Tennes
see State and Western Kentucky
became distance running pow
ers by importing whole teams
from Ireland and Creat Britain it
began to gnaw on the guys who
were on top already."
Dellinger, whose Oregon
teams won national collegiate
cross country titles in 1973 and
1974, directed his comments at
the large number of Kenyans
running in the United States.
The "Afrika Korps" won the
Pac-8 title last year. At theNCAA
meet, however, the Cougars
were runnerups to Texas-El
Paso, whose Kenyan imports
were faster than Washington
State's.
Ail-American
Two weeks ago the Cougars
ran without All-American Kurt
Beckman. His presence could
play a large part in determining
the outcome of tomorrow's race.
Stanford's hopes lie with cap
tain Jeff Norton, who has been
the team's only consistent per
former. His most recent finish
was a fifth-place effort in the
Pac-8 Southern Division meet.
Seniors Frank Boutin and Jeff
Parietti run their last cross coun
try race for the Cardinals tomor
row. Coach Marshall Clark will
probably round out his line-up
with sophomore Jerry Emory,
junior Stacy Geiken, junior Greg
Eger and freshman Bill Halde
man.
