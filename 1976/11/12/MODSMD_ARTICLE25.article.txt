# Swimmers win opener

Stanford's women's swim
team opened its season yester
day in a double-dual meet
against University of the Pacific
(LJOP) and San Francisco State,
overpowering its opponents and
qualifying three women for
A.I.A.W. National competition.
Stanford downed UOP 110-35,
and beat S.F. State 130-15.
Coach Debbie Meyer had
termed the meet "a walkaway"
even before the Cards got in the
water, and right she was. The
purpose of the competition was
to determine the effectiveness of
training thus far this season.
The meet produced some re
markably good times by the fol
lowing women, all of whom
placed first and qualified for
bids in the Nationals this spring:
Anne Brodell (500 free —
5:06.8). Judy Hudson (200 indi
vidual medley — 2:12.7) and
Kim Peyton (200 free — 1:56.3).
Meyer was happy with the
team's performance because col
legiate swimmers don't usually
reach National qualifying times
until February.
Diver Anne Carey also turned
in a performance that has her
halfway on the road to the Na
tionals. She placed first in one
meter diving Competition, scor
ing 232.5 points. Carey needs
another good performance like
yesterday's to qualify.
Other first-place finishes in
cluded: Yicki Hays (50 breast,
100 1M), Barb Beck (50 fly).
Brodell (50 back). Peyton (100
back) and Hudson (100 breast).
All four relays also garnered first
places.
