# Thrupp in Nationals
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
Stanford sophomore Ann Thrupp culminates her cross
country season with an appearance tomorrow in the Associa
tion for Inter-collegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) National
Championships in Madison, Wis. The harrier from Santa Ana
is the first woman to represent Stanford at the AIAW meet.
Thrupp, who has won six of seven races this fall, has had
little trouble with any of her foes or any of the courses on which
she has run this season. But the three-mile course in Madison
may present her with obstacles she has not had to encounter
this year: snow and bad weather.
Weather reports indicate that the highs tomorrow might
reach the low 40s. But Thrupp and women's coach Jack Bellah
have prepared for inclement weather.
"I'm taking all sorts of clothes: long underwear, mittens
and . . . I'm not sure yet . . . some kind of head gear," Thrupp
said. "The main thing forme is to get a good warmup while I'm
wearing lots of clothes."
Weather aside, Thrupp faces another problem. One hundred
of the nation's best collegiate women runners will be on hand
for the race tomorrow.
"She will probably go out hard from the first of the race and
go with the leaders," Bellah said.
It's worked before, there is no reason to believe it will not
work again.
