# Scotchers eye Spartans
## 
### Debbie Carlton 
Seventy minutes just weren't
enough for the Stanford scotch
ers to score against a determined
San lose State team, as they lost
Tuesday's fast-paced grudge
match, 1-0.
Dropping the game to the un
defeated Spartans has left the
Cardinals slightly in the red for
the Western Association of In
tercollegiate Athletics for
Women (WAIAW) Regional
Tournament, beginning today at
Harry Maloney Field. Stanford is
still in strong contention for the
top berth, which would qualify it
for the Nationals over
Thanksgiving.
If Stanford conquers its mis
takes in Tuesday's game, tomor
row's re-match with the Spar
tans should be interesting. Al
though Stanford actually en
gineered more opportunities to
score by consistently penetrat
ing Spartan territory, San Jose
State followed a "quality not
quantity" strategy by capitaliz
ing on what few chances they
had.
Stanford also had ample op
portunity to score off penalty
points with Onnie Killefer's
hard drives, only to be thwarted
by a fearless Spartan defense.
Over-anxious shots and passing
also damaged the Cards' scoring
capacity.
Coach Shirley Schoof felt that
Stanford "outplayed" San Jose
State, commenting, "We were in
control of the game." However,
she faulted the team on a shor
tage of alert, aggressive team
work at critical moments.
"We've got to get more shots
off," she stated.
Late transition
The assistant coaches said the
scotchers did not make the men
tal transition from defense to an
"attack mentality" fast enough.
This held them back from put
ting out crucial extra effort.
Goalie Buffie Berger admitted
that Stanford "diddled too
much." She translated, "We
didn't initiate passes fast
enough. We hesitated, waiting to
figure out what to do with the
ball when we should have
known automatically."
Summing up team sentiment,
Berger said, "It was frustrating."

As individuals, the scotchers
played a superb game. Kudos be
long to right wing Helen Hunt
for exceptional hustle and
halfback Jane Soyster for consis
tently scrappy tackling.
Halfback Nancy White made
some beautiful passes and did a
commendable job of stealing the
ball. Onnie Killefer's solid hits
and footwork provided the Red
and White with much of their
downfield momentum.
Good potential
If they can put it all together,
the scotchers have the best
chance of anyone to come out on
top of the regionals.

The stakes of the regionals are
high: the winner of the round
robin tournament will qualify
for the Nationals in Philadel
phia. Colorfully kilted, deter
mined and talented athletes rep
resenting seven California teams
will liven Maloney Field in what
promises to be an exceptional
display of the skill, speed and
intelligence.
'Evenly matched'
Those wishing to place bets
had better beware, for as Schoof
warns, "These teams are very
evenly matched. /Anything can
happen â€” its going to be any
body's ball game."
Stanford, after losing to Chico
State and San Jose State, is ready
for revenge. The unanimous
