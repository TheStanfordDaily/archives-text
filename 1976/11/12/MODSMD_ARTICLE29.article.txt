Booters lose
The Card soccer team, host to
the Santa Clara Broncos, had a
disappointing afternoon yester
day as it suffered a 3-0 loss.
Coach Nelson Lodge de
scribed the game as "one of the
poorer ones played by the team
this year." He remarked that
"this game indicated that we
have a ways to go before reach
ing our potential in functioning
as a unit on the field."
Lodge elaborated, saying "We
have to run-off the ball, rather
than play around the ball â€” we
were not utilizing the field." The
Cards were plagued by goals
scored on them early in the
game, which affected their at
titudes. The team allowed two
easy goals, and then another goal
on a fine shot by the Broncos.
Stanford let up after falling
behind and problems developed
in the first half as the team
bunched up on plays. A lack of
communication hurt the team in
maintaining its usually effective
formations. The Broncos exhi
bited good communication
throughout the game.
