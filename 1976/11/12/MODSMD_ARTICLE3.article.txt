# Carter transition team picked soon; Lake to handle foreign policy chores
## 
### 
Washington(AP)—President-elect
Jimmy Carter's transition manager told
a White House meeting this week that
Carter representatives will be chosen
and assigned to each department and
agency by Monday, says an administ
ration source.
Meanwhile, it has been announced
that W. Anthony Lake, who quit his job
under Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer in 1970 to protest the Cambo
dian incursion, will handle the transi
tion in foreign policy for Carter.
The source, who attended the White
House meeting last Tuesday, said the
agencies of President Gerald Ford's

administration already have picked
their transition representatives and
sent them to meet with Jack Watson Jr.,
Carter's transition chief, and help the
incoming team "get off to a running
start."
The State Department said yesterday
it has been notified of Lake's appoint
ment and that he would meet with
Lawrence Eagleburger, a Kissinger
aide designated to represent the de
partment in the transition.
Robert Funseth, the department
spokesman, said Lake would see Kis
singer next week.
The Carter transition representa

tives probably would work out of of
fices set aside for them at the Depart
ment of Health, Education and Wel
fare, rather than use quarters within
the individual agencies, the administ
ration source quoted Watson as saying.
Publicly named
About a dozen persons have been
named publicly in the last two days to
the staff led by Watson, a 37-year-old
Atlanta lawyer, to manage Carter's as
sumption of the presidency.
But more are to be named, and offi
cials in such agencies as the Interior
Department and the Environmental
Protection Agency said they still did

not know with whom they would be
dealing.
Although most of Carter's represen
tatives have not yet arrived in
Washington from post-election vaca
tions, the team's preparations to take
command of the government had
begun weeks before the election was
decided.
Lake, 37, served as an adviser to Car
ter during the campaign.
Kissinger chose Lake as an assistant
when he joined the Nixon administra
tion as national security adviser. Lake
resigned from the National Security
Council staff April 29,1970, protesting
the decision to send combat troops
into Cambodia.
Suit against Nixon, Kissinger
In 1974, he filed a suit against Presi
dent Nixon, Kissinger and others
claiming his home telephone was tap
ped for nine months after he resigned
from the security council staff.
The suit claimed "unauthorized
overhearing and surveillance of ...
intimate personal and private conver
sations" violating the privacy rights of
Lake and his wife.
In the suit. Lake's lawyerargued that
the tape were based only on suspicion
that Lake had disagreed with the
foreign policy objectives of the Nixon
administration.
At a news briefing yesterday, Car
ter's press secretary Jody Powell said
the President-elect "does not believe it
would be productive or proper" to
comment at this time on a proposal
from several senators that Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger be retained in a
Carter administration as a special dip
lomatic envoy to deal with the prob
lems of the Mideast.

sent them to meet with Jack Watson Jr.,
Carter's transition chief, and help the
incoming team "get off to a running
start."
The State Department said yesterday
it has been notified of Lake's appoint
ment and that he would meet with
Lawrence Eagleburger, a Kissinger
aide designated to represent the de
partment in the transition.
Robert Funseth, the department
spokesman, said Lake would see Kis
singer next week.
The Carter transition representa

tives probably would work out of of
fices set aside for them at the Depart
ment of Health, Education and Wel
fare, rather than use quarters within
the individual agencies, the administ
ration source quoted Watson as saying.
Publicly named
About a dozen persons have been
named publicly in the last two days to
the staff led by Watson, a 37-year-old
Atlanta lawyer, to manage Carter's as
sumption of the presidency.
But more are to be named, and offi
cials in such agencies as the Interior
Department and the Environmental
Protection Agency said they still did

not know with whom they would be
dealing.
Although most of Carter's represen
tatives have not yet arrived in
Washington from post-election vaca
tions, the team's preparations to take
command of the government had
begun weeks before the election was
decided.
Lake, 37, served as an adviser to Car
ter during the campaign.
Kissinger chose Lake as an assistant
when he joined the Nixon administra
tion as national security adviser. Lake
resigned from the National Security
Council staff April 29,1970, protesting
the decision to send combat troops
into Cambodia.
Suit against Nixon, Kissinger
In 1974, he filed a suit against Presi
dent Nixon, Kissinger and others
claiming his home telephone was tap
ped for nine months after he resigned
from the security council staff.
The suit claimed "unauthorized
overhearing and surveillance of ...
intimate personal and private conver
sations" violating the privacy rights of
Lake and his wife.
In the suit. Lake's lawyerargued that
the tape were based only on suspicion
that Lake had disagreed with the
foreign policy objectives of the Nixon
administration.
At a news briefing yesterday, Car
ter's press secretary Jody Powell said
the President-elect "does not believe it
would be productive or proper" to
comment at this time on a proposal
from several senators that Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger be retained in a
Carter administration as a special dip
lomatic envoy to deal with the prob
lems of the Mideast.
Washington(AP)—President-elect
Jimmy Carter's transition manager told
a White House meeting this week that
Carter representatives will be chosen
and assigned to each department and
agency by Monday, says an administ
ration source.
Meanwhile, it has been announced
that W. Anthony Lake, who quit his job
under Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer in 1970 to protest the Cambo
dian incursion, will handle the transi
tion in foreign policy for Carter.
The source, who attended the White
House meeting last Tuesday, said the
agencies of President Gerald Ford's

administration already have picked
their transition representatives and
sent them to meet with Jack Watson Jr.,
Carter's transition chief, and help the
incoming team "get off to a running
