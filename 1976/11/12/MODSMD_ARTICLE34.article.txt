# Homecoming for some
## Cards face lean Ducks 
### David Georgette 
Motivation — that is what the
Stanford Cardinals might be
looking for when they face the
Oregon Ducks tomorrow at 1:15
(KSFO 560-AM) at Autzen
Stadium in Eugene. Post-season
possibilities are beyond consid
eration for the Cards while the
Ducks have never really inspired
the dislike of the Stanford fans
and alumni. So what is at stake?
For starters, the Ducks sure
would like to win their first
Pacific-8 game of the year. After
winning their first three non
conference games, the Ducks
came close against Washington
and Washington State. The lack
of a conference triumph, though,
has some Duck rooters out to
cook the goose of third-year head
coach Don Read.
Before the season, Read said,
"We have a chance to be a very
explosive football team. If we do
stay healthy, we will be one of
the good teams in the confer
ence." However, the Ducks' 3-6
record has turned Read's early
season optimism into disap
pointment. "We haven't been a

very successful team by any
stretch of the imagination," he
said.
For the Cards (4-5), a winning
season is on the line, and that is
what head coach Jack Christian
sen said he has been stressing to
the players this week. "When
you play in one of your bigger
games of the year and lose,
everyone is disappointed,"
Christiansen said. "Hut we'll
have to bounce back. We've got
to real ize we've got a chance for a
winning record."
Chris cautious
Even though Oregon has iit
times performed like ducks
waddling in oil, Christiansen
warned against predictions of an
easy game.
"Oregon will probably ap
proach our game like all the
northwest teams do," said Chris.
"They feel they have a good
chance to win if they can out-hit
us or beat us on emotion. They
have a bunch of tough of kids
who run around and hit. Outside
of USC and UCLA, the other six
schools are pretty close, a lot
closer than people think."

If the Ducks hope to win, the
key man will most likely be
junior quarterback Jack Hender
son (ti-foot-1, 190). In last year's
game against Stanford he passed
for 283 yards.
"Jack's having a good year,"
said Read. Henderson has
thrown for 1087 yards this sea
son while completing 55 per
cent of his passes.
"They have tried this year to
be a passing team with Hender
son and play like us," said Chris
tiansen. "But when the other
teams realize this, they use dou
ble coverage on the receivers.
That's what we'll do."
The man the Cards, and Hen
derson, will be watching is
senior split end Creg Bauer (5-9.
179). Bauer has caught 38 passes
this year, good for third in the
conference. Stanford defensive
back Larry Reynolds said, "He's
a good receiver. 1 don't really
know if he's that fast, but he's
quick and he gets open."
Reynolds is one of six Cardi
nals who prepped in Oregon. I le
said "it'll be fun" playing in
front of his friends and family.
Wide receiver John Fyle, who
played all his home games as a
senior in Autzen Stadium, said,
"This is the biggest game of the
year for me."
Kellar keyed
Wide receiver Bill Kellar said
he is "all psyched up to play be
fore the people I used to play in
front of in high school. I'm
keyed."
Commenting on the trip home
for the Card Oregonians, Christ
iansen said. "I think it's a lot like
when we go to Los Angeles.
They've got a lot of friends there
anil they 1 ike to play their best."
Oregon and rain are
synonymous. John Pigott,
another Stanford performer from
Oregon, said, "I hope it's good
weather. I've played in the rain
long enough to know what it's
like. 1 don't like it."
And the Ducks know what los
ing is like, and they don't like it,
either.

you play in one of your bigger
games of the year and lose,
everyone is disappointed,"
Christiansen said. "Hut we'll
have to bounce back. We've got
to real ize we've got a chance for a
winning record."
Chris cautious
Even though Oregon has iit
times performed like ducks
waddling in oil, Christiansen
warned against predictions of an
easy game.
"Oregon will probably ap
proach our game like all the
northwest teams do," said Chris.
"They feel they have a good
chance to win if they can out-hit
us or beat us on emotion. They
have a bunch of tough of kids
who run around and hit. Outside
of USC and UCLA, the other six
schools are pretty close, a lot
closer than people think."

If the Ducks hope to win, the
key man will most likely be
junior quarterback Jack Hender
son (ti-foot-1, 190). In last year's
game against Stanford he passed
for 283 yards.
"Jack's having a good year,"
said Read. Henderson has
thrown for 1087 yards this sea
son while completing 55 per
cent of his passes.
"They have tried this year to
be a passing team with Hender
son and play like us," said Chris
tiansen. "But when the other
teams realize this, they use dou
ble coverage on the receivers.
That's what we'll do."
The man the Cards, and Hen
derson, will be watching is
senior split end Creg Bauer (5-9.
179). Bauer has caught 38 passes
this year, good for third in the
conference. Stanford defensive
back Larry Reynolds said, "He's
a good receiver. 1 don't really
know if he's that fast, but he's
quick and he gets open."
Reynolds is one of six Cardi
nals who prepped in Oregon. I le
said "it'll be fun" playing in
front of his friends and family.
Wide receiver John Fyle, who
played all his home games as a
senior in Autzen Stadium, said,
"This is the biggest game of the
year for me."
Kellar keyed
Wide receiver Bill Kellar said
he is "all psyched up to play be
fore the people I used to play in
front of in high school. I'm
keyed."
Commenting on the trip home
for the Card Oregonians, Christ
iansen said. "I think it's a lot like
when we go to Los Angeles.
They've got a lot of friends there
anil they 1 ike to play their best."
Oregon and rain are
synonymous. John Pigott,
another Stanford performer from
Oregon, said, "I hope it's good
weather. I've played in the rain
long enough to know what it's
like. 1 don't like it."
And the Ducks know what los
ing is like, and they don't like it,
either.
Motivation — that is what the
Stanford Cardinals might be
looking for when they face the
Oregon Ducks tomorrow at 1:15
(KSFO 560-AM) at Autzen
Stadium in Eugene. Post-season
possibilities are beyond consid
eration for the Cards while the
Ducks have never really inspired
the dislike of the Stanford fans
and alumni. So what is at stake?
For starters, the Ducks sure
would like to win their first
Pacific-8 game of the year. After
winning their first three non
conference games, the Ducks
came close against Washington
and Washington State. The lack
of a conference triumph, though,
has some Duck rooters out to
cook the goose of third-year head
coach Don Read.
Before the season, Read said,
"We have a chance to be a very
explosive football team. If we do
stay healthy, we will be one of
the good teams in the confer
ence." However, the Ducks' 3-6
record has turned Read's early
season optimism into disap
pointment. "We haven't been a

very successful team by any
stretch of the imagination," he
said.
For the Cards (4-5), a winning
season is on the line, and that is
what head coach Jack Christian
sen said he has been stressing to
the players this week. "When
you play in one of your bigger
games of the year and lose,
everyone is disappointed,"
Christiansen said. "Hut we'll
