# Confused about parking changes? Herrington offers basic Q & A
## 
### 
Since the beginning of this fall quarter, several changes in
the parking system have been instituted in order to adjust
parking availability and thereby to achieve greater equity
among users of the system.
Many of these changes have had the desired effect, but
some have been counterproductive. The purpose of the fol
lowing questions and answers is to explain why many of
these actions were taken, and to assure members of the
community that all such changes, especially redesignations,
were made in a sincere effort to improve parking availability.
Our efforts are made in conformance with the letter and
the spirit of a relatively new system which has evolved rather
rapidly and has been adopted after great deliberation by
representatives of all segments of the community.
We propose to attempt continually to assess parking
usage, to institute changes that appear necessary —including
reversal of changes instituted toward that end but with un
expectedly opposite results-and generally to adjust the park
ing regulations within the framework of the system that has
been adopted.
The Committee on Parking and Transportation (C-PT) is
charged with recommending policy relating to parking on the
campus, and several of the recommendations of last year's
committee were approved by the president and vice-presi
dents last June for implementation this year.
Many inquiries have been received by the Police Depart
ment regarding changes in the parking program on campus
and their implementation. We offer the following representa
tive questions and answers to clarify the situation, and hope
that it will be easier to understand individual changes in the
context of the whole system.
Q. I decided to buy a B sticker after determining from the
parking lot map that there is a B lot near my work. Now
the lot has been changed to A and I can't find a place
nearby. Isn't the University guilty of misrepresentation?
A No The General Provisions explain and the parking lot
map carries the legend that "All conditions, regulations,
and parking-area designations shown on this map are
subiect to change at any time. WARNING: Check sign
designations before parking." We hope to minimize the
frequency of changes, but some changes will be necessary.
Q. Why have some areas been changed from B to A or C to
B? Or from B to C?
A. With the change instituted this year of opening the pur
chase of permits to a much larger group, i.e., with fewer
restrictions, there was an unexpectedly large sale of A

permits especially. For example, at the end of the '75-'76
year, 582 "Reserve" and 2,319 "Staff" permits were sold
for first vehicles, while by mid- October, 1976, sales of
the comparable stickers were 1,269 and 1,348, respec
tively (A and B permits). It was impossible to predict
accurately the demand for each category of permit. We
are now attempting to reach a balance between the num
ber of A or B permits sold and the number of A, B, or C
spaces designated and available.
Q. I bought an A permit expecting to park near my office.
Why can't I find an A space?
A. Although we can regulate the total number of spaces in
each category, the distribution of spaces is fixed by lot
location and si?e There are areas on the campus that have
very little parking space of any kind in relationship to the
demand, and this shortage is further compounded by new
building construction which preempts space presently or
formerly used for parking. While we can assure you a
space, the proximity of that space to your office depends
on the particular demand in your area.
Q. Why are there so may time zone spaces in the lot adjacent
to the Law School?
A. The Bookstore-Post Office lot was eliminated by con
struction. We therefore allocated the same number of
spaces as last year for users of those facilities, in the lot
near the Law School, (Lot J.). We were told by several
people that many of the newly allocated spaces have not
been used, and after confirming this by observation we
have now reduced the number of spaces designated as
time zones. We could not have made that determination
without sufficient experience of the real needs in the new
location.
Q. There are many vacant A or B spaces in my area. Why
can't they be changed to my category?
A. In some cases the answer is the same as the Bookstore lot
question, i.e., we need more experience before changing.
In other cases we are trying to maintain the balance
between permits sold in a particular category and spaces
available campus wide. Clearly, the difficulty in reaching
the proper balance is compounded by having to adjust the
campus-wide balance to local needs.
Q. Why were the new 50c pay lots created?
A. These lots were created to replace the old visitor zone
spaces. The visitor spaces were violated by faculty, staff,
and students alike to the point that legitimate visitors
could not find a legal place to park. The pay lots provide

relatively easy access for visitors and are located in places
that can be found by visitors who are unfamiliar with our
campus. The pay lots also provide fairly convenient
parking, for a fee, to faculty, staff, and students who need
to bring a car on campus occasionally but normally do
not drive.
Q. Why can't resident students park in C zones?
A. Resident students are assigned specific lots near their
residences. Faculty and staff are not permitted to park tn
those lots. To permit resident students to park in C zones
would effectively tie up two daytime spaces instead of
one.
Q. Why can't I park under the trees along Campus Drive?
A. Constant parking in the landscaped areas along Campus
Drive will damage and destroy trees and other vegetation
by compacting the soil and directing engine exhaust on
the plants.
Q. Why must we show proof of vehicle ownership for an
alternate vehicle permit?
A. Because we are trying to ensure that only one car is on
campus for each permit that is sold.
Q. I have a parking problem and wish to register a complaint.
To whom should I appeal?
A. For the most immediate action, complaints or suggestions
should be submitted in writing to the Department of
Public Safety (Police Department) or the Planning Depart
ment, simply because those departments are responsible
for implementing the parking system. Letters may also be
sent to the C-PT, which is in close contact with the Police
Department but which can only make recommendations.
C-PT does not have the authority to direct specific acti
ons. Copies of all letters sent to the C-PT will be tefened
to the Police Department for possible action.
Q. Does the Committee on Parking and Transportation make
all the decisions regarding parking at Stanford?
A. No. C-PT is charged with reviewing the parking and trans
portation system and making recommendations to the
President. Maior decisions relating to any such recommen
dations are made by him with the advice and concurrence
of the vice-presidents.

should be submitted in writing to the Department of
Public Safety (Police Department) or the Planning Depart
ment, simply because those departments are responsible
for implementing the parking system. Letters may also be
sent to the C-PT, which is in close contact with the Police
Department but which can only make recommendations.
C-PT does not have the authority to direct specific acti
ons. Copies of all letters sent to the C-PT will be tefened
to the Police Department for possible action.
Q. Does the Committee on Parking and Transportation make
all the decisions regarding parking at Stanford?
A. No. C-PT is charged with reviewing the parking and trans
portation system and making recommendations to the
President. Maior decisions relating to any such recommen
dations are made by him with the advice and concurrence
of the vice-presidents.
Marvin Herrington
Director of Public Safety.
Since the beginning of this fall quarter, several changes in
the parking system have been instituted in order to adjust
parking availability and thereby to achieve greater equity
among users of the system.
Many of these changes have had the desired effect, but
some have been counterproductive. The purpose of the fol
lowing questions and answers is to explain why many of
these actions were taken, and to assure members of the
community that all such changes, especially redesignations,
were made in a sincere effort to improve parking availability.
Our efforts are made in conformance with the letter and
the spirit of a relatively new system which has evolved rather
rapidly and has been adopted after great deliberation by
representatives of all segments of the community.
We propose to attempt continually to assess parking
usage, to institute changes that appear necessary —including
reversal of changes instituted toward that end but with un
expectedly opposite results-and generally to adjust the park
ing regulations within the framework of the system that has
been adopted.
The Committee on Parking and Transportation (C-PT) is
charged with recommending policy relating to parking on the
campus, and several of the recommendations of last year's
committee were approved by the president and vice-presi
dents last June for implementation this year.
Many inquiries have been received by the Police Depart
ment regarding changes in the parking program on campus
and their implementation. We offer the following representa
tive questions and answers to clarify the situation, and hope
that it will be easier to understand individual changes in the
context of the whole system.
Q. I decided to buy a B sticker after determining from the
parking lot map that there is a B lot near my work. Now
the lot has been changed to A and I can't find a place
nearby. Isn't the University guilty of misrepresentation?
A No The General Provisions explain and the parking lot
map carries the legend that "All conditions, regulations,
and parking-area designations shown on this map are
subiect to change at any time. WARNING: Check sign
designations before parking." We hope to minimize the
frequency of changes, but some changes will be necessary.
Q. Why have some areas been changed from B to A or C to
B? Or from B to C?
A. With the change instituted this year of opening the pur
chase of permits to a much larger group, i.e., with fewer
restrictions, there was an unexpectedly large sale of A

permits especially. For example, at the end of the '75-'76
year, 582 "Reserve" and 2,319 "Staff" permits were sold
for first vehicles, while by mid- October, 1976, sales of
the comparable stickers were 1,269 and 1,348, respec
tively (A and B permits). It was impossible to predict
accurately the demand for each category of permit. We
are now attempting to reach a balance between the num
ber of A or B permits sold and the number of A, B, or C
spaces designated and available.
Q. I bought an A permit expecting to park near my office.
Why can't I find an A space?
A. Although we can regulate the total number of spaces in
each category, the distribution of spaces is fixed by lot
location and si?e There are areas on the campus that have
very little parking space of any kind in relationship to the
demand, and this shortage is further compounded by new
building construction which preempts space presently or
formerly used for parking. While we can assure you a
space, the proximity of that space to your office depends
on the particular demand in your area.
Q. Why are there so may time zone spaces in the lot adjacent
to the Law School?
A. The Bookstore-Post Office lot was eliminated by con
struction. We therefore allocated the same number of
spaces as last year for users of those facilities, in the lot
near the Law School, (Lot J.). We were told by several
people that many of the newly allocated spaces have not
been used, and after confirming this by observation we
have now reduced the number of spaces designated as
time zones. We could not have made that determination
without sufficient experience of the real needs in the new
location.
Q. There are many vacant A or B spaces in my area. Why
can't they be changed to my category?
A. In some cases the answer is the same as the Bookstore lot
question, i.e., we need more experience before changing.
In other cases we are trying to maintain the balance
between permits sold in a particular category and spaces
available campus wide. Clearly, the difficulty in reaching
the proper balance is compounded by having to adjust the
campus-wide balance to local needs.
Q. Why were the new 50c pay lots created?
A. These lots were created to replace the old visitor zone
spaces. The visitor spaces were violated by faculty, staff,
and students alike to the point that legitimate visitors
could not find a legal place to park. The pay lots provide

relatively easy access for visitors and are located in places
that can be found by visitors who are unfamiliar with our
campus. The pay lots also provide fairly convenient
parking, for a fee, to faculty, staff, and students who need
to bring a car on campus occasionally but normally do
not drive.
Q. Why can't resident students park in C zones?
A. Resident students are assigned specific lots near their
residences. Faculty and staff are not permitted to park tn
those lots. To permit resident students to park in C zones
would effectively tie up two daytime spaces instead of
one.
Q. Why can't I park under the trees along Campus Drive?
A. Constant parking in the landscaped areas along Campus
Drive will damage and destroy trees and other vegetation
by compacting the soil and directing engine exhaust on
the plants.
Q. Why must we show proof of vehicle ownership for an
alternate vehicle permit?
A. Because we are trying to ensure that only one car is on
campus for each permit that is sold.
Q. I have a parking problem and wish to register a complaint.
To whom should I appeal?
A. For the most immediate action, complaints or suggestions
should be submitted in writing to the Department of
Public Safety (Police Department) or the Planning Depart
ment, simply because those departments are responsible
for implementing the parking system. Letters may also be
sent to the C-PT, which is in close contact with the Police
Department but which can only make recommendations.

Q. Why can't resident students park in C zones?
A. Resident students are assigned specific lots near their
residences. Faculty and staff are not permitted to park tn
those lots. To permit resident students to park in C zones
would effectively tie up two daytime spaces instead of
one.
Q. Why can't I park under the trees along Campus Drive?
A. Constant parking in the landscaped areas along Campus
Drive will damage and destroy trees and other vegetation
by compacting the soil and directing engine exhaust on
the plants.
Q. Why must we show proof of vehicle ownership for an
alternate vehicle permit?
A. Because we are trying to ensure that only one car is on
campus for each permit that is sold.
Q. I have a parking problem and wish to register a complaint.
To whom should I appeal?
A. For the most immediate action, complaints or suggestions
should be submitted in writing to the Department of
Public Safety (Police Department) or the Planning Depart
ment, simply because those departments are responsible
for implementing the parking system. Letters may also be
sent to the C-PT, which is in close contact with the Police
Department but which can only make recommendations.
C-PT does not have the authority to direct specific acti
ons. Copies of all letters sent to the C-PT will be tefened
to the Police Department for possible action.
Q. Does the Committee on Parking and Transportation make
all the decisions regarding parking at Stanford?
A. No. C-PT is charged with reviewing the parking and trans
portation system and making recommendations to the
President. Maior decisions relating to any such recommen
dations are made by him with the advice and concurrence
of the vice-presidents.
Marvin Herrington
Director of Public Safety.
Since the beginning of this fall quarter, several changes in
the parking system have been instituted in order to adjust
parking availability and thereby to achieve greater equity
among users of the system.
Many of these changes have had the desired effect, but
some have been counterproductive. The purpose of the fol
lowing questions and answers is to explain why many of
these actions were taken, and to assure members of the
community that all such changes, especially redesignations,
were made in a sincere effort to improve parking availability.
Our efforts are made in conformance with the letter and
the spirit of a relatively new system which has evolved rather
rapidly and has been adopted after great deliberation by
representatives of all segments of the community.
We propose to attempt continually to assess parking
usage, to institute changes that appear necessary —including
reversal of changes instituted toward that end but with un
expectedly opposite results-and generally to adjust the park
ing regulations within the framework of the system that has
been adopted.
The Committee on Parking and Transportation (C-PT) is
charged with recommending policy relating to parking on the
campus, and several of the recommendations of last year's
committee were approved by the president and vice-presi
dents last June for implementation this year.
Many inquiries have been received by the Police Depart
ment regarding changes in the parking program on campus
and their implementation. We offer the following representa
tive questions and answers to clarify the situation, and hope
that it will be easier to understand individual changes in the
context of the whole system.
Q. I decided to buy a B sticker after determining from the
parking lot map that there is a B lot near my work. Now
the lot has been changed to A and I can't find a place
nearby. Isn't the University guilty of misrepresentation?
A No The General Provisions explain and the parking lot
map carries the legend that "All conditions, regulations,
and parking-area designations shown on this map are
subiect to change at any time. WARNING: Check sign
designations before parking." We hope to minimize the
frequency of changes, but some changes will be necessary.
Q. Why have some areas been changed from B to A or C to
B? Or from B to C?
A. With the change instituted this year of opening the pur
chase of permits to a much larger group, i.e., with fewer
restrictions, there was an unexpectedly large sale of A

permits especially. For example, at the end of the '75-'76
year, 582 "Reserve" and 2,319 "Staff" permits were sold
for first vehicles, while by mid- October, 1976, sales of
the comparable stickers were 1,269 and 1,348, respec
tively (A and B permits). It was impossible to predict
accurately the demand for each category of permit. We
are now attempting to reach a balance between the num
ber of A or B permits sold and the number of A, B, or C
spaces designated and available.
Q. I bought an A permit expecting to park near my office.
Why can't I find an A space?
A. Although we can regulate the total number of spaces in
each category, the distribution of spaces is fixed by lot
location and si?e There are areas on the campus that have
very little parking space of any kind in relationship to the
demand, and this shortage is further compounded by new
building construction which preempts space presently or
formerly used for parking. While we can assure you a
space, the proximity of that space to your office depends
on the particular demand in your area.
Q. Why are there so may time zone spaces in the lot adjacent
to the Law School?
A. The Bookstore-Post Office lot was eliminated by con
struction. We therefore allocated the same number of
spaces as last year for users of those facilities, in the lot
near the Law School, (Lot J.). We were told by several
people that many of the newly allocated spaces have not
been used, and after confirming this by observation we
have now reduced the number of spaces designated as
time zones. We could not have made that determination
without sufficient experience of the real needs in the new
location.
Q. There are many vacant A or B spaces in my area. Why
can't they be changed to my category?
A. In some cases the answer is the same as the Bookstore lot
question, i.e., we need more experience before changing.
In other cases we are trying to maintain the balance
between permits sold in a particular category and spaces
available campus wide. Clearly, the difficulty in reaching
the proper balance is compounded by having to adjust the
campus-wide balance to local needs.
Q. Why were the new 50c pay lots created?
A. These lots were created to replace the old visitor zone
spaces. The visitor spaces were violated by faculty, staff,
and students alike to the point that legitimate visitors
could not find a legal place to park. The pay lots provide

relatively easy access for visitors and are located in places
that can be found by visitors who are unfamiliar with our
campus. The pay lots also provide fairly convenient
parking, for a fee, to faculty, staff, and students who need
to bring a car on campus occasionally but normally do
not drive.
Q. Why can't resident students park in C zones?
A. Resident students are assigned specific lots near their
residences. Faculty and staff are not permitted to park tn
those lots. To permit resident students to park in C zones
would effectively tie up two daytime spaces instead of
