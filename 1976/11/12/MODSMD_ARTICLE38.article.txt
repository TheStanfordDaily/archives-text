U.S. joins U.N. censure of Israel
United Nations, N.Y. — The I Jnited States joined
in ii consensus Security Council statement yester
day that "strongly deplored" Israeli policies in oc
( iipied Arab territories as "an obstacle to peace."
Israeli Ambassador Chaim Herzog accused the
council of "anti-Semitic innuendos" and rejected
the statement as one-sided.
The statement specifically cited construction of
Israeli settlements in Arab lands occupied in the
1967 Mideast war and expropriation of land and
"transfer of populations" in Jerusalem.
It was the first time in five years the United
States, the Israelis' best friend in the United Na
tions. joined in a declaration so critical of Israel.
Hut the statement echoed portions of a tough
speech against Israeli occupation policies made by
U.S. Ambassador William Scranton last March.
That statement infuriated Israelis, and U.N. ob
servers predicted another outburst of anti-
American sentiment in Israel this time.
Yesterday's consensus statement, read by Coun
cil President Jorge Illueca ofPanama on behalf of all
lfj council members, expressed "grave anxiety and
concern over the present serious situation" in the
occupied Arab territories.
It called on Israel to "refrain from any measures"
that violate theCeneva Convention governing ad
ministration of occupied territories.
"In this regard the measures taken by Israel in the
occupied Arab territories that alter their demog
raphic composition or geographical nature and par
ticularly the establishment of settlements are ac
cordingly strongly deplored," the council de
clared.
Gandhi's government strengthened
New Delhi, India — The Indian parliament yes
terday completed passage of an historic constitu
tional amendment strengthening the executive
power of Prime Minister Indira Candhi's govern
ment.
With about a dozen opposition members sitting
out in protest, the upper house voted 191-0 to give
the government the sweeping new authority it had
requested to rule this nation of 610 million people.
The amendment will become law after receiving
t he anticipated endorsement of a majority of India's
22 state assemblies.
One provision of the amendment empowers the
government to ban any activity or organization it
deems "anti-national."
The amendment also bars the courts from review
ing either the substance or procedure of constitu
tional amendments and requires a two-thirds

majority to overturn ordinary legislation. It em
powers the supreme court to shift a case from one
high court to another or to take jurisdiction itself.
U.S. tries to avoid oil price hike
Washington — The United States is consulting
urgently with other industrialized countries on
ways to head off an anticipated oil price increase
next month, a State Department spokesman said
yesterday.
Some oil cartel countries favor an increase of 10
per cent or more but spokesman Robert Funseth
said any price hike would hurt exporting countries
as well as imports.
"They are part of the world economy as well,"
Funseth said.
He said the United States has been in close con
sultation with Japan and the Western European
countries on ways to persuade the oil countries to
forego a price hike when they meet in Qatar.
These countries have cited international infla
tion to justify an increase but Funseth said the four
fold increase imposed by the cartel since 1973 more
than compensates for the higher import costs to
them.
Proxmire warns 'Fed'
Washington — The Federal Reserve Board could
find its independence sharply curtailed if it fails to
cooperate with the Carter administration and Con
gress in creating jobs and expanding the economy,
Sen. William Proxmire said yesterday.
The Wisconsin Democrat addressed his warning
to Fed Chairman Arthur Burns after the two disag
reed over whether the powerful Fed was relaxing or
maintaining its firm grip on the nation's money
supply and interest rates.
Burns, whose term as chairman does not expire
until 1978, told the Senate Banking Committee that
the Fed has eased its policies in recent weeks and
would relax them further if the economy needs it.
But Proxmire, the committee chairman, said the
Fed's money growth targets for next year do not
show an easing of money policies. Burns had said
the Fed's targets are for growth in the nation's basic
money supply of from 4.5 to 6.5 per cent, down
slightly from the old targets of 4.5 to seven percent.
Burns made clear his prime concern is fear of
setting off a new round of inflation, which in turn
could bring on a new recession.
"Lasting prosperity will not be achieved until
our country solves its chronic problem of infla
tion," he said.

Burns said there is "a clear need" to expand
economies of both industrial and underdeveloped
nations, but said that the resort to traditional
economic stimulation policies might set off new
inflation and make matters worse.
Although Burns did not mention them, the tradi
tional policies governments follow include tax re
ductions.
Said Proxmire: "You're a very convincing man,
but what you are trying to convince me of is that
down is really up. . . . It's hard to adjust to the idea
that 6.5 per cent is higher than seven per cent."
Burns argued there is considerable flexibility in
the money targets. He noted that the basic money
supply grew 4.4 percent during the past 12 months.
British role suggested in Rhodesia
Dares Salaam, Tanzania — President Julius
Nyerere has called on Britain to assume more direct
responsibility for Rhodesia's changeover to black
majority rule by naming Britons to serve as minis
ters of defense and foreign affairs in the interim
period.
Nyerere said in an interview that this would set
tle one of the toughest problems facing the Geneva
conference on Rhodesia — control of the Rhodesian
army.
The Tanzanian president said Britain, as the legal
colonial power in Rhodesia, also should provide
the two ministers until the transition period is
completed.
But "internal affairs" — meaning control of the
police — "would, of course, be the responsibility of
the local, the interim government," Nyerere de
clared in the interview Wednesday.
Rhodesian Prime Minister lan Smith has insisted
that both the army and the police be controlled by
white Rhodesians during the interim period.
Nyerere, speaking on the porch of his modest
beachfront home outside Dares Salaam, said: "The
problem of Britain's role hinges on her acceptance
during the transitional government period of her
responsibilities."
If Britain fails to assume its full burden, he said,
"the British must bear the responsibility for the
continuation of the war in Rhodesia."
