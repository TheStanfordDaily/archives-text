# Few swine flu shots given on campus
## 
### 
Fewer than 2000 persons have been
inoculated against swine flu here in a
program that originally expected to
vaccinate five times that number.
A spokesman for the Swine Flu Im
munization Program of Santa Clara
County gave the exact figures for the
university as 1617 monovalent (swine
flu inoculations) and 362 bivalent
(swine flu and A-Victoria flu inocula
tions), as of the end of the day Wed
nesday.
The'low turnout on campus was typ
ical of the county. Bruce Overoye, co
ordinator of the Swine Flu Immuniza
tion Program of Santa Clara County,
said that while 120,000 immuniza
tions (50,000 bivalent and 70.000
monovalent) had been given, 600,000
doses of the vaccine were available to
vaccinate the 800,000 eligible persons
in the county.

James McClenahan, director of
Cowell Student Health Center, said the
low turnout was "perfectly puzzling."
but did suggest that it was perhaps
partly caused by "uncertainty as to
whether we'll have a swine flu
epidemic," since there had been no
outbreaks of the disease since last
winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
Harvey Hall, former university re
gistrar and co-ordinator of the im
munization program here, issued a
final appeal for students, faculty and
staff to come in and get their shots,
saying, "The last opportunity to get it
at a place that is convenient is today."
Marilyn Dauffenbach, a nurse at
Cowell, said individuals who decide
after today to get swine flu immuniza
tions can receive them at the Stanford
Shopping Center either this weekend
or the next, 1-5 p.m. Fridays, 9 a.m.-5
p.m. Saturdays and 1-5 p.m. Sundays.
