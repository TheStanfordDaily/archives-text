# KZSU loses most money
## Fee assessment refunds rise 
### Kathy Trafton Staff writer 
The tallying of ASSU fee assessment
refunds for autumn quarter shows that
the Legal Counseling Office (LCO) has
received the most money and KZSU
has received the least money of the six
organizations getting money from as
sessments, as refunds increased.
Only 1112 students asked for their
$1 back from the LCO. This is a mar
kedly lower number than the students
who requested their $1 refund from the
Daily assessment, the next highest
money getter.
Mary Taxiera, secretary in the ASSU
office, said many students did not ask
for a refund for the LCO assessment
because they would be giving up the
right to take advantage of the legal ser
vices provided by the organization.
"We had a waiver form to sign. You
can't use Legal Counseling for the
quarter if you receive refunds." Taxi
era said.
The demand for refunds has in
creased slightly over the past year. An
average of 42 more people than last
year has requested refunds per organi
zation this year, with the exception of
the Stanford Band. Eighteen fewer
people asked for a refund on their
Band money this year.
The Program Fee assessment is al
locating about one-tenth of its funds to
the Publications Board. But Pub Board
chairman Jeff Stoler says "that money
has strings attached to it. We can't give
it out to anything but news letters. It
really doesn't go to the Pub Board."
