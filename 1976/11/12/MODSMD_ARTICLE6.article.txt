### Ted Hamiton 
The Main Library addition will be
come one corner of another quad, with
Meyer Library, the Main Library and
the Cubberley (School of Education)
Building to be the other three corners.
The Board of Trustees approved a
start to the construction of the $20
million addition at their Nov. 9 meet
ing.
The university will open competi
tive bidding for construction of the
1 HO.OOO gross square foot library ex
tension in mid-January, which will
take approximately two years to com
plete. Cairns said.
More than $15 million in gifts and
pledges have already been received for
the new library and the remainder will
In? sought during construction, accord
ing to Cairns.
Cairns said the new library, which
will have three stories above ground
and one below, will be built on the
present site of the toll parking lot on
Calvez Street between Meyer Under
graduate Library and the existing
Main Library.
"The parking lot will be relocated,"
Cairns said, adding that its new loca
tion is still under study.
Connected with other libraries
Cairns explained that the new lib
rary will be connected at all levels with
the present Main Library, and will also
have an underground connection to

the Meyer Library basement.
"We will be creating a new library
quad," Cairns said. A landscape court
yard will serve as a focal point for
students coming to the quadrangle, he
added.
According to Building Projects
Manager Philip Leighton, the new lib
rary will house approximately one
million volumes — primarily research
collections in the humanities and so
cial sciences — and is intended to be
used by both graduates and under
graduates.
Study offices
Leighton noted that the new library
will contain approximately 200 indi
vidual study offices for use by faculty,
graduate students or undergraduates
doing advanced research study.
Leighton also said the new library
will have a higher carrel-to-table ra
tion than Meyer library.
"Roughly 75 per cent of the study
facilities will be large study carrels,"
Leighton said.
According to Cairns, normal traffic
flow should not be interrupted by con
struction of the new library.
"We don't anticipate any further de
struction of Calvez Street," Cairns
said.
The architectural firm for the new
building is Hellmuth, Obata, and Kas
sabaum, Inc. of San Francisco and St.
Louis, Cairns said.

Leighton also said the new library
will have a higher carrel-to-table ra
tion than Meyer library.
"Roughly 75 per cent of the study
facilities will be large study carrels,"
Leighton said.
According to Cairns, normal traffic
flow should not be interrupted by con
struction of the new library.
"We don't anticipate any further de
struction of Calvez Street," Cairns
said.
The architectural firm for the new
building is Hellmuth, Obata, and Kas
sabaum, Inc. of San Francisco and St.
Louis, Cairns said.

Cairns said the new library, which
will have three stories above ground
and one below, will be built on the
present site of the toll parking lot on
Calvez Street between Meyer Under
graduate Library and the existing
Main Library.
"The parking lot will be relocated,"
Cairns said, adding that its new loca
tion is still under study.
Connected with other libraries
Cairns explained that the new lib
rary will be connected at all levels with
the present Main Library, and will also
have an underground connection to

the Meyer Library basement.
"We will be creating a new library
quad," Cairns said. A landscape court
yard will serve as a focal point for
students coming to the quadrangle, he
added.
According to Building Projects
Manager Philip Leighton, the new lib
rary will house approximately one
million volumes — primarily research
collections in the humanities and so
cial sciences — and is intended to be
used by both graduates and under
graduates.
Study offices
Leighton noted that the new library
will contain approximately 200 indi
vidual study offices for use by faculty,
graduate students or undergraduates
doing advanced research study.
Leighton also said the new library
will have a higher carrel-to-table ra
tion than Meyer library.
