## Faculty column misstates record

Dittenhofer et al.

On Friday, Nov. 5, the Daily pub
lished a column signed by 10
Economics Department faculty charg
ing there had been a "blatant distor
t ion of the facts" concerning the recent
struggle in the department over the
study of Marxian economics.
The Stanford chapter of the Union
for Radical Political Economics
(IJRPE) is responding to the faculty
column in order to clarify who is en
gaging in a "blatant distortion of the
facts."
The faculty column presents itself as
an attempt to refute the notion that
"there is a campaign in the Economics
Department to suppress the teaching
of radical economics." The column
cites the presence of faculty and
courses in Marxian economics as evi
dence against such a campaign.
The column creates the impression
that the department has welcomed the
strengthening of the program in
Marxian economics, but the history of
the program demonstrates that the
contrary is true.
Active opposition
While individual faculty members
have supported the program at various
times, many others have actively op
posed it all along, and such opposition
has been sufficient to impede change.
The program in Marxian economics
would be much weaker than it is today
l' had it not been for massive student
» efforts in the form of petitions, open
i meetings, and extensive lobbying of
individual faculty members.
In particular, the faculty column
suggests that the presence of Marxian
economists in the department and the
recent expansion of course offerings in
Marxian economics reflects a friendly
departmental attitude toward the
J program. The column fails to mention
i that it was only after a divisive one and
i one-half year struggle that the oppos
l ing elements in the department gave
: into student pressure and conceded to
' the appointment of Prof. Donald Har
i ris.
Student struggle
j Thus the presence of Marxian
j economists here simply indicates the
; success of the student struggle. The
! uniform lack of Marxists at other major
. universities only reflects the perva
• siveness of discrimination against
, Marxists throughout the American
: economics profession.
| The recent addition of course offer
; ings in Marxian economics is again a
direct result of student pressure, not
departmental benevolence. There was
especially strong resistance by the de
i partment to establishing a graduate
' field having equal status with eaiji of
the 13 traditional fields.
Latest episode
The dumping of Assoc. Prof. Duncan
; Foley is the latest episode in the de
t partment's campaign against Marxian
> economics. His research in tradi
tional theory has established him as
, one of the leading young theorists in
' the country on top of which he has an
outstanding reputation as a teacher.
I I3ut because he lias recently developed
■in interest in Marxian approaches to
. monetary theory, the department has
decided to dump him.
Perhaps the most "blatant distortion
. of the facts" is the faculty column's
' attempt to imply that student interest
' in Marxian economics is relatively
, weak. They state. "The number of
graduate students offering Alternative
Approaches to Economics as a field for
| their Ph.D. in the last two years was
substantially fewer than the number

taking many of the major applied sub
fields."
Out of context
This fact has been completely torn
out of context. Two years ago, two of
the three courses in the field were
taught by a visiting faculty member
who, because of the temporary nature
of his appointment, was severely li
mited in his ability to attract students
into the field. This observation was
previously made by one of the signers
of the faculty letter.
Large numbers of first and second
year students have taken and are tak
ing courses in the field, and many will
be taking the comprehensive this year
(including some second year students
who did the coursework last year but
delayed the exam).
Further, the column ignores the fact
that among advanced students, there
are a large number of people doing re
search in the Alternative Approaches
seminar, and many are pursuing dis
sertations in the field.
No denial
Finally, the faculty claim that the
notion that they share a "common
ideology is at best erroneous, at worst
ridiculous." We do not deny that the
faculty have a diversity of views, rang
ing from "extremely conservative to
quite liberal" on the issues raised by
neoclassical economics.
But there is general agreement
among the faculty over what those is
sues are. Within the neoclassical
paradigm, only certain kinds of ques
tions can be asked, only certain
abstractions of economic relationshi ps
into theory are believed appropriate,
only certain methodological ap
proaches are deemed valid.
Marxian economics represents a
fundamental alternative. The di
vergence between Marxian economics
and neoclassical economics is far grea
ter than the divergence within neo
classical economics.
To sum up: In response to I JRPE's
charges, the faculty column's denial of
the existence of political discrimina
tion is the real "blatant distortion of
the facts." The only adequate response
the faculty can make is to end that dis
crimination. A tenure offer to P'oley
would be an appropriate first step in
that direction.

On Friday, Nov. 5, the Daily pub
lished a column signed by 10
Economics Department faculty charg
ing there had been a "blatant distor
t ion of the facts" concerning the recent
struggle in the department over the
study of Marxian economics.
The Stanford chapter of the Union
for Radical Political Economics
(IJRPE) is responding to the faculty
column in order to clarify who is en
gaging in a "blatant distortion of the
facts."
The faculty column presents itself as
an attempt to refute the notion that
"there is a campaign in the Economics
Department to suppress the teaching
of radical economics." The column
cites the presence of faculty and
courses in Marxian economics as evi
dence against such a campaign.
The column creates the impression
that the department has welcomed the
strengthening of the program in
Marxian economics, but the history of
the program demonstrates that the
contrary is true.
Active opposition
While individual faculty members
have supported the program at various
times, many others have actively op
posed it all along, and such opposition
has been sufficient to impede change.
The program in Marxian economics
would be much weaker than it is today
l' had it not been for massive student
» efforts in the form of petitions, open
i meetings, and extensive lobbying of
individual faculty members.
In particular, the faculty column
suggests that the presence of Marxian
economists in the department and the
recent expansion of course offerings in
Marxian economics reflects a friendly
departmental attitude toward the
J program. The column fails to mention
i that it was only after a divisive one and
i one-half year struggle that the oppos
l ing elements in the department gave
: into student pressure and conceded to
' the appointment of Prof. Donald Har
i ris.
Student struggle
j Thus the presence of Marxian
j economists here simply indicates the
; success of the student struggle. The
! uniform lack of Marxists at other major
. universities only reflects the perva
• siveness of discrimination against
, Marxists throughout the American
: economics profession.
| The recent addition of course offer
; ings in Marxian economics is again a
direct result of student pressure, not
departmental benevolence. There was
especially strong resistance by the de
i partment to establishing a graduate
' field having equal status with eaiji of
the 13 traditional fields.
Latest episode
The dumping of Assoc. Prof. Duncan
; Foley is the latest episode in the de
t partment's campaign against Marxian
> economics. His research in tradi
tional theory has established him as
, one of the leading young theorists in
' the country on top of which he has an
outstanding reputation as a teacher.
I I3ut because he lias recently developed
■in interest in Marxian approaches to
. monetary theory, the department has
decided to dump him.
Perhaps the most "blatant distortion
. of the facts" is the faculty column's
' attempt to imply that student interest
' in Marxian economics is relatively
, weak. They state. "The number of
graduate students offering Alternative
Approaches to Economics as a field for
| their Ph.D. in the last two years was
substantially fewer than the number

taking many of the major applied sub
fields."
Out of context
This fact has been completely torn
out of context. Two years ago, two of
the three courses in the field were
taught by a visiting faculty member
who, because of the temporary nature
of his appointment, was severely li
mited in his ability to attract students
into the field. This observation was
previously made by one of the signers
of the faculty letter.
Large numbers of first and second
year students have taken and are tak
ing courses in the field, and many will
be taking the comprehensive this year
(including some second year students
who did the coursework last year but
delayed the exam).
Further, the column ignores the fact
that among advanced students, there
are a large number of people doing re
search in the Alternative Approaches
seminar, and many are pursuing dis
sertations in the field.
No denial
Finally, the faculty claim that the
notion that they share a "common
ideology is at best erroneous, at worst
ridiculous." We do not deny that the
faculty have a diversity of views, rang
ing from "extremely conservative to
quite liberal" on the issues raised by
neoclassical economics.
But there is general agreement
among the faculty over what those is
sues are. Within the neoclassical
paradigm, only certain kinds of ques
tions can be asked, only certain
abstractions of economic relationshi ps
into theory are believed appropriate,
only certain methodological ap
proaches are deemed valid.
Marxian economics represents a
fundamental alternative. The di
vergence between Marxian economics
and neoclassical economics is far grea
ter than the divergence within neo
classical economics.
To sum up: In response to I JRPE's
charges, the faculty column's denial of
the existence of political discrimina
tion is the real "blatant distortion of
the facts." The only adequate response
the faculty can make is to end that dis
crimination. A tenure offer to P'oley
would be an appropriate first step in
that direction.

and neoclassical economics is far grea
ter than the divergence within neo
classical economics.
To sum up: In response to I JRPE's
charges, the faculty column's denial of
the existence of political discrimina
tion is the real "blatant distortion of
the facts." The only adequate response
the faculty can make is to end that dis
crimination. A tenure offer to P'oley
would be an appropriate first step in
that direction.

On Friday, Nov. 5, the Daily pub
lished a column signed by 10
Economics Department faculty charg
ing there had been a "blatant distor
t ion of the facts" concerning the recent
struggle in the department over the
study of Marxian economics.
The Stanford chapter of the Union
for Radical Political Economics
(IJRPE) is responding to the faculty
column in order to clarify who is en
gaging in a "blatant distortion of the
facts."
The faculty column presents itself as
an attempt to refute the notion that
"there is a campaign in the Economics
Department to suppress the teaching
of radical economics." The column
cites the presence of faculty and
courses in Marxian economics as evi
dence against such a campaign.
The column creates the impression
that the department has welcomed the
strengthening of the program in
Marxian economics, but the history of
the program demonstrates that the
contrary is true.
Active opposition
While individual faculty members
have supported the program at various
times, many others have actively op
posed it all along, and such opposition
has been sufficient to impede change.
The program in Marxian economics
would be much weaker than it is today
l' had it not been for massive student
» efforts in the form of petitions, open
i meetings, and extensive lobbying of
individual faculty members.
In particular, the faculty column
suggests that the presence of Marxian
economists in the department and the
recent expansion of course offerings in
Marxian economics reflects a friendly
departmental attitude toward the
J program. The column fails to mention
i that it was only after a divisive one and
i one-half year struggle that the oppos
l ing elements in the department gave
: into student pressure and conceded to
' the appointment of Prof. Donald Har
i ris.
Student struggle
j Thus the presence of Marxian
j economists here simply indicates the
; success of the student struggle. The
! uniform lack of Marxists at other major
. universities only reflects the perva
• siveness of discrimination against
, Marxists throughout the American
: economics profession.
| The recent addition of course offer
; ings in Marxian economics is again a
direct result of student pressure, not
departmental benevolence. There was
especially strong resistance by the de
i partment to establishing a graduate
' field having equal status with eaiji of
the 13 traditional fields.
Latest episode
The dumping of Assoc. Prof. Duncan
; Foley is the latest episode in the de
t partment's campaign against Marxian
> economics. His research in tradi
tional theory has established him as
, one of the leading young theorists in
' the country on top of which he has an
outstanding reputation as a teacher.
I I3ut because he lias recently developed
■in interest in Marxian approaches to
. monetary theory, the department has
decided to dump him.
Perhaps the most "blatant distortion
. of the facts" is the faculty column's
' attempt to imply that student interest
' in Marxian economics is relatively
, weak. They state. "The number of
graduate students offering Alternative
Approaches to Economics as a field for
| their Ph.D. in the last two years was
substantially fewer than the number

taking many of the major applied sub
fields."
Out of context
This fact has been completely torn
out of context. Two years ago, two of
the three courses in the field were
taught by a visiting faculty member
who, because of the temporary nature
of his appointment, was severely li
mited in his ability to attract students
into the field. This observation was
previously made by one of the signers
of the faculty letter.
Large numbers of first and second
year students have taken and are tak
ing courses in the field, and many will
be taking the comprehensive this year
(including some second year students
who did the coursework last year but
delayed the exam).
Further, the column ignores the fact
that among advanced students, there
are a large number of people doing re
search in the Alternative Approaches
seminar, and many are pursuing dis
sertations in the field.
No denial
Finally, the faculty claim that the
notion that they share a "common
ideology is at best erroneous, at worst
ridiculous." We do not deny that the
faculty have a diversity of views, rang
ing from "extremely conservative to
quite liberal" on the issues raised by
neoclassical economics.
But there is general agreement
among the faculty over what those is
sues are. Within the neoclassical
paradigm, only certain kinds of ques
tions can be asked, only certain
abstractions of economic relationshi ps
into theory are believed appropriate,
only certain methodological ap
proaches are deemed valid.
Marxian economics represents a
fundamental alternative. The di
vergence between Marxian economics
and neoclassical economics is far grea
ter than the divergence within neo
classical economics.
