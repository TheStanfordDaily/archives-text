'Vulgarity'
Hooray for Olivia de Havilland's
forceful objection to commercial inter
ruptions of "Gone With the Wind" on
television!
I will never forget Arthur Rubens
tein's being interrupted in mid
conversation half a dozen times on
Dick Cavett's talk show for commer
cials for a furniture store. In everv case,

the train of thought was completely
lost and Cavette failed even to attempt
its retrieval.
I also remember Princess Anne's
wedding in Westminster Abbey
switching straight from a live shot of
the cathedral apse to a can of soup.
Down with such absolute vulgarity.
