# Carter's advisers, beliefs considered
## 
### 
Having already considered, in the
Sept. 27 Daily, many ofPresident-elect
Jimmy Carter's stands on the issues, I
wish only to detail here the lessons
drawn from Vietnam by Carter's
foreign policy advisers, the effect of
Carter's religion on his foreign policy,
and the particulars of Carter's pro
posed pardon for draft refusers.
On the whole, the only lesson drawn
by Carter's foreign policy advisers
(Zbigniew Brzezinski, James
Schlesinger, George Ball, Cyrus
Vance, Paul Nitze, and others) in their
published writings is that U.S. in
volvement in Vietnam was at worst a
mistake. At most a very specific lesson
is drawn: intervention in Vietnam was
the wrong thing in the wrong place at
the wrong time. Never is the more gen
eral lesson drawn that military inter
vention abroad is morally and practi
cally wrong.
Possible exceptions
Two possible exceptions are Paul
Warnke and Anthony Lake. Lake, who
resigned from Kissinger's National
Security Council in protest over the
pending invasion of Cambodia, is
viewed by Carter as a quitter, accord
ing to columnists Evans and Novak,
but may still land a minor post in the
Agency for international Development
or in some human rights-related arena.
Emerging from the Vietnam era with
what one of his colleagues described
as the mentality of a bishop, Lake is
one of the best examples in the Carter
circle of someone obsessed with
Woodrow Wilson's crusading notion
that no one should cry "peace" in the
world until sin and wrong have been
eliminated everywhere.
Warnke is much more of a princi
pled noninterventionist. He seems to
believe that the world can no longer be
controlled by the great powers.
Warnke now maintains that foreign
peoples should work out their own
destinies.
Memo to Johnson
But it should not be forgotten that
Warnke helped draft the famous
; post-Tet Pentagon memo to President
i Johnson that suggested more troops
and bombing and made no reference to
peace negotiations. This memo was
drafted at a time when negotiations
and withdrawal were frequently

examined options outside the Johnson
administration, for it was written after
Eugene McCarthy's challenge of
Johnson in the 1968 New Hampshire
primary.
With the possible exception of
Warnke, Carter's advisers seem to be

Cold Warriors upset with detente anil
Wilsonian idealists who want to im
pose parliamentary welfare states on
the peoples of the world. Columnist
Anthony Lewis writes: "Consider the
question of morality in foreign policy.
Vietnam teaches the danger of trying
to imposean American vision of lifeon
other countries by force."
This is precisely the teaching that
Carter and his advisers refuse to learn.
Carter's religion
It is often said in a tone of nervous
self-reassurance that Carter's Southern
Baptist beliefs will not affect his posi
tions on public policy. But Carter's re
ligious convictions apparently have
made him an opponent of abortion. It
seems that religion may affect foreign
policy as well.
Biblical revelation may now become
the basis of U.S. policy in the Mideast.
On Aug. 30, Carter told a group of
pro-Zionist Jewish leaders: "As a
Christian myself, I think that the ful
fillment of Israel, the coming of that
nation, is a fulfillment of Biblical
prophecy."
A similar quotation from Carter ap
peared on the cover of an official
Carter-Mondale campaign leaflet di
rected at urban Jewish voters. In it. Car
ter says:"It is written that the Jewish
people will have their own place on
this earth given to them from God for
time immemorial. The promise has
been made. America's next President

must see it is kept." Apparently the
American president is the anointed
wielder of God's terrible swift sword.
Complete pardon?
What will be the policy of the future
Carter administration toward
Vietnam-era deserters from the milit
ary and toward persons who were
given less-than-honorable dis
charges? The 1976 Democratic plat
form calls for "a full and complete
pardon for those who are in legal or
financial jeopardy because of their
peaceful opposition to the Vietnam
war, with deserters to be considered on
a case-by-case basis."
The wording of the platform plank
sounds as if it covers a pardon for those
with bad discharges, civilian antiwar
protesters with criminal records for
nonviolent acts, draft nonregistrants,
and antiwar and antidraft protesters
now abroad who are barred by immig
ration restrictions from visiting the
U.S.

But it turns out they are not going to
be covered by pardon.
To ascertain what Carter's policy
would be on draft resisters and milit
ary deserters, AME.\'*-Ccinudo, a
magazine published for American
exiles in Canada, recently interviewed
Stuart Eizenstat, Carter's director of is
sues and policy.
Eizenstat's response shows that de
spite the broad coverage of the plat
form plank, Carter intends to stick to
his personal position of a pardon only
for draft-resisters. Carter and his staff,
according to Eizenstat, have given no
consideration to veterans with bad
discharge papers, draft nonregistrants,
or civilian antiwar protesters.
Furthermore. Eizenstat doubted that
deserters who survived the proposed
tough reviews of their cases would re
ceive honorable discharges.
