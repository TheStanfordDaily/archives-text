Bonn, West Germany (AF) — The controversial
dismissal of two Luftwaffe generals dramatizes
West Germany's continued difficulty in coming to
terms with World War 11. 31 years after Hitler's
defeat.
"Many members of the older generation would
like to cancel out the entire war retroactively and
act as though it never took place." observed a
Bonn source with close ties to the military.
"The younger ones have little conception of the
past and say, 'Germany is soccer world champion,
so why bother us with Hitler. Sure Germany once
had concentration camps, but look at what the
Americans did in Vietnam.' The thinking within
the Bundeswehr (West Germany's 495,000-
member armed forces) reflects that of society as a
whole."
The controversy was stirred up with retired Col.
Hans-lJlrich Rudel. Hitler's most decorated air
ace and a postwar supporter of neo-Nazi causes,
was allowed to take part in a gathering of his old
Stuka dive-bomber squadron at Bremgarten Air
Base on Oct. 23.
The dismissed generals — Lt. Gen. Walter
krupinski, commander of West Germany's tacti
cal air force, and Maj. Gen. karl-Heinz Franke, his
deputy — had defended the invitation by compar
ing Rudel with Herbert Wehner, a 70-year-old
ex-Communist who now is the leader of Chancel
lor Helmut Schmidt's Social Democratic party in
parliament.
Leftists in parliament
Rudel's participation. Franke told reporters,
could not be condemned so long as "leftist ex
tremists and Communists" were sitting in parlia

ment. Franke singled out Wehner, who spent part
of the Nazi era in Moscow but later renounced
communism.
Schmidt's government tends to regard the cur
rent furor as a psychological extension of West
Germany's recent election campaign. The conser
vative opposition almost won with an emotional
appeal to nationalism and fears of communism.
The conservative Christian Democratic Union
now has lined up against Schmidt's defense
minister, Georg Leber, for firing the generals be
cause he felt their remarks overstepped the con
stitutional line barring military interference in
politics. Leber also accused them of insubordina
tion in permitting the Bremgarten reunion.
Measure against Leber
A conservative censure motion is pending
against Leber in parliament. A debate on the mo
tion was cancelled last Wednesday when the de
fense minister was hospitalized for acute appen
dicitis.
"The disturbing thing," a government source
said, "is that the same people who are willing to
see in Rudel only the brave soldier are ready to
dismiss Wehner as a Communist." What they ig
nore, he added, is that Rudel has not changed his
views, while Wehner has demonstrated for more
than 25 years his commitment to parliamentary
democracy.
A public opinion poll showed that 55 per cent
of West Germans queried deplored the generals'
comparison of Rudel and Wehner. But 46 percent
said Leber had been too harsh in firing them,
while 30 per cent supported the defense minister
and 24 per cent were undecided.
