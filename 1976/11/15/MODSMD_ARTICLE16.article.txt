# Rocky, Reagan clash on GOP
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Vice Pres
ident Nelson Rockefeller says in
a newly published magazine in
terview that a "moderate, prog
ressive Republican party will
emerge" from internal struggles.
But former California Gov.
Ronald Reagan said in a com
panion copyrighted interview
with U.S. News Br World Report
that "we need to erect a banner
. .. of bold colors — no pastel
shades."
Reagan, who lost the COP
presidential nomination to Pres
ident Gerald Ford, said that his
choice for such a banner would
be the party's 1976 platform
adopted at the Kansas City con
vention.
"It was the rank and file that
wrote that platform in what was
literally a revolution against the
document handed down by the
party hierarchy. It deals in
specifics, in conservative prin
ciples — no hedging on where
we stand," Reagan said.
Rockefeller put it differently:
"Conservative forces pushed
through a platform . . . that took
positions that were far more con
servative in certain areas than
the majority of the party would
have reflected."
The vice president, former
four-term governor of New York,
said the party "is going to con
tinue to be a vibrant force in this
country" despite its loss of the
White House after eight years
and its failure to gain seats in

Congress.
Reagan agreed that the HOP is
still a healthy political organiza
tion but added that it is "long
overdue for a reassessment of it
selt.
He commented. "The real
story of this election is not in
what gave Carter his squeak
through victory. The real story
is: How did he almost lose an
election when his party out
numbers ours two to one or bet
ter? The Republican party, with
less than a fifth of the registered
voters in this country, got almost
50 per cent of the vote;."
The two men agreed that the
party should aim its appeal <it
independent voters. Reagan said
they won't be attracted without .1
strong statement of common
philosophy, while Rockefeller
called for able candidates
backed by a good organization.
Reagan declined to suggest
possible new party leaders, but
Rockefeller listed Illinois
(iovernor-elect Jim Thompson.
Delaware Governor-elect Pierre
du Pont. Sens. Howard Maker of
Tennessee and Charles Percy ol
Illinois and incoming senators
Richard Lugar of Indiana and
John Heinz of Pennsylvania.
