## Shuffling the Cards Oregon belongs in Pac-8 
### Chris Baker 
Eugene. Ore. — The Stanford
football team would probably
qualify for membership in Trans
World Airlines ambassador's
club.
The Cardinals have flown over
20,000 miles this year. Saturday,
their long road odyssey came to
an end. Although the 79th Big
Came (Winning Season Bowl)
will be contested in Strawberry
Canyon, Stanford won't have to
board an airplane, unless the
players want to beat the giant
traffic jam which is sure to clog
the Berkeley streets.
When Stanford visited Penn
State and Michigan, in its first
two games, both towns were
buzzing with anticipation. In
University Park. Pa., I got into a
taxi cab and the driver, seeing
my Stanford jacket, asked if I had
any extra tickets to the sold out
game.
Oregon apathy
Friday evening I was in
another taxi cab. "Football?"
asked the driver. "I didn't know
Oregon had a football team. Well
the only thing 1 like about Uni
versity of Oregon football is
watching the coach try to exp
lain why he lost 50-0 on his Sun
day television show."
The Oregon publicity depart
ment worked overtime this sea
son. A giant sign just outside Au
tzen Stadium proclaims this
tootball edifice as the home of
the "Wide Open Came."
Oregon head coach Don Read,
who writes football books in the
off season, almost became a
fulltime author last year after he
led his Ducks to a 3-8 record.
But university President Wil
liam Boyd gave Read a two-year
contract to "finish what he
started." Read conducted an ex
tensive search for good running
backs and found what he was
looking for in tailback Creg Gil
christ.
Good crowds
The team captured the atten
tion of Eugene, usually reserved

for basketball and track. After
the first three weeks of the sea
son the Ducks were among the
Pacific-8 attendance leaders.
But then an old alum came
back to visit.
First-year USC head coach
John Robinson, class of 1958, kil
led the Ducks 53-0. Over 40,000
people, largest Autzen Stadium
crowd since the stadium was
opened in 1967, witnessed the
early opening of Duck hunting
season.
Oregon won two in a row after
that, beating Utah and Utah
State, but they've now lost six in

a row.
Watching Oregon play foot
ball is like seeing the living
death of college football right be
fore your very eyes.
'Northwest Nothings'
In the last few years there has
been a lot of talk about kicking
the "Northwest Nothings" out of
the Pac-8. But Oregon has a large
stadium and with some im
ported talent and the right
coaching staff, the Ducks could
probably be competitive.
Oregon is down and it might
be easy to justify kicking them

out of the conference. Stanford
took home its worst pay check of
the year after the game.
But that only leaves Oregon to
die a fast death. Kicking Oregon
out of the conference may solve
some immediate problems, but
the NCAA, athletic directors and
conferences must learn that the
same thing could happen to
every school except the Michi
gans and Nebraskas.
As one Duck fan said after the
game, "Things won't get much
better during basketball season."
Anybody for kicking Oregon's
cage squad out of the Pac-8?


Plenty of time

passes for 277 yards Saturday, steps into the pocket to spot

one of his receivers. The junior from Menlo Park threw four
interceptions against the Cards.
