# Poloists win Pac-8 title
## 
### Chris Kamel 
Stanford's varsity water polo team is
Pacific-H champion, ending the weekend with an
undefeated 5-0 conference record. And the Cards
earned it like champions.
To do it. they had to beat the UCLA Bruins at
home this weekend, and any Pac-8 coach will tell
you that is no easy task.
"Every team they play goes into their match
with the Bruins automatically ahead by three
goals," said Stanford water polo coach Art Lambert,
referring to UCLA's tremendous home advantage.
Cards snap jinx
The Cards played like they were three goals
behind, working extra hard on offense and de
fense to wear down the Bruins. It payed off as
Stanford did the near-impossible, beating the
Bruins at home, 15-9.
"We just played an excellent, heads-up game,"
Lambert said. "We just did everything right."
Indeed. Stanford resembled nothing less than a
machine, as the Cards played with very little flaw
on offense and defense. Passes were accurate,
drives to the goal were sharp and, what it all
comes down to, shots on goal were right on target.
Defense keys win
The defense complemented the offense, as
Stanford's pressing defense forced numerous
Bruin turnovers. UCLA seemed frustrated by the
Cards' motivated play.
Once again, goalie Chris Dorst keyed the de
fense. The senior, who Lambert refers to as "one of
the best goalies in the world," blocked two pen
alty shots and forced another to sail high over the
net.

From the opening face-off, the Cards just kept
on adding and adding to their lead. Stanford
mounted an 8-3 halftime margin and later in
creased that to its largest lead of the game, at 10-4
in the third quarter. Lambert substituted quite
freely in the second half.
'Super game'
"Tom Angelo played a super game on both of
fense and defense," said Lambert. Angelo, along
with teammate Doug Burke, led the Card scoring
with four goals.
The only thing that stopped the offensive out
put of the sophomore from Santa Clara was a bro
ken nose he sustained at the end of the third quar
ter, which forced Lambert to pull him from the
game. Angelo's injury is not serious enough to
keep him from Stanford's final match of the regu
lar season at Cal next Saturday at 10:45 a.m.
Stanford's win over UCLA marks the first time
since 1963 that the Bruins have not enjoyed at
least a share of the Pac-8 crown. The victory au
tomatically gives the Cards an invitation to the
NCAA championships at Belmont Plaza Pools in
Long Beach in December.
'First-round seed'
"It places us as a first-round seed." said Lam
bert. "But right now what I am most happy about
is that the Pac-8 championship is ours, we don't
have to share it with anybody." Last year the
Cards ended up in a three-way tie for the crown
with Cal and UCLA.
The victory over the Bruins at home was the
highlight of Stanford's three-game weekend
sweep, as the Cards also took wins over USC,
20-11, and Pepperdine, 19-10. Both wins were
never in doubt.

referring to UCLA's tremendous home advantage.
Cards snap jinx
The Cards played like they were three goals
behind, working extra hard on offense and de
fense to wear down the Bruins. It payed off as
Stanford did the near-impossible, beating the
Bruins at home, 15-9.
"We just played an excellent, heads-up game,"
Lambert said. "We just did everything right."
Indeed. Stanford resembled nothing less than a
machine, as the Cards played with very little flaw
on offense and defense. Passes were accurate,
drives to the goal were sharp and, what it all
comes down to, shots on goal were right on target.
Defense keys win
The defense complemented the offense, as
Stanford's pressing defense forced numerous
Bruin turnovers. UCLA seemed frustrated by the
Cards' motivated play.
Once again, goalie Chris Dorst keyed the de
fense. The senior, who Lambert refers to as "one of
the best goalies in the world," blocked two pen
alty shots and forced another to sail high over the
net.

From the opening face-off, the Cards just kept
on adding and adding to their lead. Stanford
mounted an 8-3 halftime margin and later in
creased that to its largest lead of the game, at 10-4
in the third quarter. Lambert substituted quite
freely in the second half.
'Super game'
"Tom Angelo played a super game on both of
fense and defense," said Lambert. Angelo, along
with teammate Doug Burke, led the Card scoring
with four goals.
The only thing that stopped the offensive out
put of the sophomore from Santa Clara was a bro
ken nose he sustained at the end of the third quar
ter, which forced Lambert to pull him from the
game. Angelo's injury is not serious enough to
keep him from Stanford's final match of the regu
lar season at Cal next Saturday at 10:45 a.m.
Stanford's win over UCLA marks the first time
since 1963 that the Bruins have not enjoyed at
least a share of the Pac-8 crown. The victory au
tomatically gives the Cards an invitation to the
NCAA championships at Belmont Plaza Pools in
Long Beach in December.
'First-round seed'
"It places us as a first-round seed." said Lam
bert. "But right now what I am most happy about
is that the Pac-8 championship is ours, we don't
have to share it with anybody." Last year the
Cards ended up in a three-way tie for the crown
with Cal and UCLA.
The victory over the Bruins at home was the
highlight of Stanford's three-game weekend
sweep, as the Cards also took wins over USC,
20-11, and Pepperdine, 19-10. Both wins were
never in doubt.
Stanford's varsity water polo team is
Pacific-H champion, ending the weekend with an
undefeated 5-0 conference record. And the Cards
earned it like champions.
To do it. they had to beat the UCLA Bruins at
home this weekend, and any Pac-8 coach will tell
you that is no easy task.
"Every team they play goes into their match
with the Bruins automatically ahead by three
goals," said Stanford water polo coach Art Lambert,
referring to UCLA's tremendous home advantage.
