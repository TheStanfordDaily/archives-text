# Defense keys 28-17 win
## Cards down Oregon 
### Jill Lieber 
Eugene, Ore. — Bright green
and yellow Oregon football pub
licity posters this year heralded
the Duck offense as "Wide
Open." But the only thing "Wide
Open" Saturday was Duck head
coach Don Read's mouth.
An Autzen Stadium crowd of
18,000 watched as a hungry
Stanford defense delt Oregon its
sixth consecutive loss, 28-17.
The first Card score came with
just 4:01 gone in the game, when
senior safety Rich Waters inter
cepted a pass from Duck quar
terback Jack Henderson in
tended for Oregon's top receiver
Greg Bauer. Waters turned on his
speed and raced 48 yards down
the right sideline to put the first
six points on the scoreboard for
Stanford.
Five interceptions
Waters' interception was the
first of two and the first of five
the Cards had against the Ducks.
A little over a minute after
Waters' touchdown, middle
linebacker Gordy Ceresino in
tercepted another Henderson
pass at the Oregon 43 and"the
Bear" took the ball 17 yards up
the left sideline to set up the
Cards' second score.
Stanford quarterback Guy
Benjamin came in and unloaded
a 26-yard pass deep over the
middle to flanker Tony Hill, on
the first play after the steal.
On the ensuing series, the
tough Stanford defense kept the
Ducks contained within their
own 48-yard line — letting them
move the ball only 21 yards.
Here's how it went.
Defense tough
Ceresino deflected a Hender
son pass right into the hands of
Bauer for 11 yards. Then Ca-d
defensive end Chuck Evans, in
censed by the first down the
Ducks made on the tip by Cere
sino, crashed through the Ore
gon offensive line, got his arms
around running back George
Bennett just after he had taken
the handoff from Henderson,
and threw Bennett for a two-yard
loss.
On a run up the middle, Hen
derson was met immediately by
Stanford linebacker Jeff Barton
and tackle Steve Howe, and the
Ducks knew the Card defense
meant business and were forced

to punt.
Stanford put together its best
drive of the afternoon on the next
series, with running back Ron
Inge leading the way. Inge took
the ball on the tirst play for a
22-yard run up the middle.
After a short run by fullback
Don Stevenson and an incom
plete pass to end Bill kellar, Inge
carried the ball three consecu
tive times for another first down.
Inge's largest gain — five yards
— came with a little help from
offensive tackle Cordy King,
who prevented Inge from getting
tripped up early by picking him
up and throwing him ahead of a
pileup for three more yards.
Hill's second TD
Benjamin fired a 12-yard
touchdown pass to Hill in the
right corner of the end zone to
cap the 83-yard scoring march
and give the Cards a 21-0 lead.
Oregon was able to put only
three points on the board in the
tirst half. The Ducks put together
their only real scoring march of
thefirst half but theCard defense
shut down the Oregon ground
game.
After Evans deflected a Hen
derson pass, intended for Bauer,
the Ducks brought in Roy Geiger
to kick a 42-yard field goal.
Official's gift
The rest of the half saw no at
tempts at scoring until no time
was left. Stanford controlled the
ball on the final series of the half
and on the last play of the quarter
an Oregon player committed a
personal foul.
Stanford got a first down and
Mike Michel was called in to
kick a 51-yard field goal.
Michel's boot was short, but the
Ducks were guilty of holding
and Michel got another shot
from 15 yards closer. This time
his 36-yard field goal was wide
right.
The Oregon rushing game
opened up in the second half
against the pass-minded Card
defense. With 3:57 left in the
third quarter, Henderson hit
running back Jim Johnson on a
swing pass for 30 yards and a TD.
Henderson's two point conver
sion pass failed and the score
stood at 21-9.
Stanford got a break after an
unsuccessful series which

forced Michel to punt. Oregon
fumbled the punt and the Cards'
John Olenchalk fell on the ball.
The Cards got another gift when
the Ducks were penalized for a
foul, so Benjamin took over from
the Oregon 13. Running back
Phil Francis got the ball into the
end zone on a 10-yard run
around the left side.
Scoring drought
The Ducks tried to surpass
their season high game of 22
points, with the game out of
reach in the fourth quarter. The
Cards played just hard enough to
keep Oregon from scoring more
than one touchdown.
After Benjamin fumbled a
snapat thebeginning of the final
quarter, Oregon recovered the
ball but only got far enough to
attempt a 58-yard field goal,
thanks to an 11-yard quarterback
sack by Jeff Barton.
The Ducks did score however
with 1:22 left in the game on a
pitch inside to Johnson who
needed only a yard for the
touchdown. Oregon added two
more points on a run by reserve
quarterback Jerry Jurich. The
Ducks went 77 yards in 12 plays
and made the final score, 28-17.
Stanford has given away a lot
of its ball games this season but
Saturday they were on the re
ceiving end. Head coach Jack
Christiansen said after the game.
"I think getting the breaks early
in the game, like that intercep
tion (Waters' 48-yard TD) is what
we needed to win.
"1 think if we would have had
more of those this season, we
wouldn't be in the situation we
are now — fighting to have a
winning season."
Pressure
"We really wanted to win this
game," said Evans. "We want a
winning season and we wanted
to win it for Coach Chris. He's
gotten so many hassles from tin;
alumni and press about his job."
In the Oregon locker room, a
frustrated and teary-eyed Read
realized he had probably just
coached his last game in Autzen
Stadium. The third-year coach
has been on the hot seat all year.
Read was still stunned by Wat
ers' 48-vard interception.
"Our play was designed to
beat their coverage. I'm not sure
whether Henderson threw the
ball early or just what hap
pened."
'Defense the key'
"The key to our win was de
fense," said Christiansen.
"We weren't quite sure what
Oregon was going to do before
we got out there because they
can run and pass," Evans said.
"We just knew we had to try to
keep them from getting points
on the board."
Evans and Ceresino said that
Waters' interception sparked the
Card defense. "From that point
on," Ceresino said, "we were
very confident. I wish the breaks
would've come earlier in the
season for us."

touchdown pass to Hill in the
right corner of the end zone to
cap the 83-yard scoring march
and give the Cards a 21-0 lead.
Oregon was able to put only
three points on the board in the
tirst half. The Ducks put together
their only real scoring march of
thefirst half but theCard defense
shut down the Oregon ground
game.
After Evans deflected a Hen
derson pass, intended for Bauer,
the Ducks brought in Roy Geiger
to kick a 42-yard field goal.
Official's gift
The rest of the half saw no at
tempts at scoring until no time
was left. Stanford controlled the
ball on the final series of the half
and on the last play of the quarter
an Oregon player committed a
personal foul.
Stanford got a first down and
Mike Michel was called in to
kick a 51-yard field goal.
Michel's boot was short, but the
Ducks were guilty of holding
and Michel got another shot
from 15 yards closer. This time
his 36-yard field goal was wide
right.
The Oregon rushing game
opened up in the second half
against the pass-minded Card
defense. With 3:57 left in the
third quarter, Henderson hit
running back Jim Johnson on a
swing pass for 30 yards and a TD.
Henderson's two point conver
sion pass failed and the score
stood at 21-9.
Stanford got a break after an
unsuccessful series which

forced Michel to punt. Oregon
fumbled the punt and the Cards'
John Olenchalk fell on the ball.
The Cards got another gift when
the Ducks were penalized for a
foul, so Benjamin took over from
the Oregon 13. Running back
Phil Francis got the ball into the
end zone on a 10-yard run
around the left side.
Scoring drought
The Ducks tried to surpass
their season high game of 22
points, with the game out of
reach in the fourth quarter. The
Cards played just hard enough to
keep Oregon from scoring more
than one touchdown.
After Benjamin fumbled a
snapat thebeginning of the final
quarter, Oregon recovered the
ball but only got far enough to
attempt a 58-yard field goal,
thanks to an 11-yard quarterback
sack by Jeff Barton.
The Ducks did score however
with 1:22 left in the game on a
pitch inside to Johnson who
needed only a yard for the
touchdown. Oregon added two
more points on a run by reserve
quarterback Jerry Jurich. The
Ducks went 77 yards in 12 plays
and made the final score, 28-17.
Stanford has given away a lot
of its ball games this season but
Saturday they were on the re
ceiving end. Head coach Jack
Christiansen said after the game.
"I think getting the breaks early
in the game, like that intercep
tion (Waters' 48-yard TD) is what
we needed to win.
"1 think if we would have had
more of those this season, we
wouldn't be in the situation we
are now — fighting to have a
winning season."
Pressure
"We really wanted to win this
game," said Evans. "We want a
winning season and we wanted
to win it for Coach Chris. He's
gotten so many hassles from tin;
alumni and press about his job."
In the Oregon locker room, a
frustrated and teary-eyed Read
realized he had probably just
coached his last game in Autzen
Stadium. The third-year coach
has been on the hot seat all year.
Read was still stunned by Wat
ers' 48-vard interception.
"Our play was designed to
beat their coverage. I'm not sure
whether Henderson threw the
ball early or just what hap
pened."
'Defense the key'
"The key to our win was de
fense," said Christiansen.
"We weren't quite sure what
Oregon was going to do before
we got out there because they
can run and pass," Evans said.
"We just knew we had to try to
keep them from getting points
on the board."
Evans and Ceresino said that
Waters' interception sparked the
Card defense. "From that point
on," Ceresino said, "we were
very confident. I wish the breaks
would've come earlier in the
season for us."
Eugene, Ore. — Bright green
and yellow Oregon football pub
licity posters this year heralded
the Duck offense as "Wide
Open." But the only thing "Wide
Open" Saturday was Duck head
coach Don Read's mouth.
An Autzen Stadium crowd of
18,000 watched as a hungry
Stanford defense delt Oregon its
sixth consecutive loss, 28-17.
The first Card score came with
just 4:01 gone in the game, when
senior safety Rich Waters inter
cepted a pass from Duck quar
terback Jack Henderson in
tended for Oregon's top receiver
Greg Bauer. Waters turned on his
speed and raced 48 yards down
the right sideline to put the first
six points on the scoreboard for
Stanford.
Five interceptions
Waters' interception was the
first of two and the first of five
the Cards had against the Ducks.
A little over a minute after
Waters' touchdown, middle
linebacker Gordy Ceresino in
tercepted another Henderson
pass at the Oregon 43 and"the
Bear" took the ball 17 yards up
the left sideline to set up the
Cards' second score.
Stanford quarterback Guy
Benjamin came in and unloaded
a 26-yard pass deep over the
middle to flanker Tony Hill, on
the first play after the steal.
On the ensuing series, the
tough Stanford defense kept the
Ducks contained within their
own 48-yard line — letting them
move the ball only 21 yards.
Here's how it went.
Defense tough
Ceresino deflected a Hender
son pass right into the hands of
Bauer for 11 yards. Then Ca-d
defensive end Chuck Evans, in
censed by the first down the
Ducks made on the tip by Cere
sino, crashed through the Ore
gon offensive line, got his arms
around running back George
Bennett just after he had taken
the handoff from Henderson,
and threw Bennett for a two-yard
loss.
On a run up the middle, Hen
derson was met immediately by
Stanford linebacker Jeff Barton
and tackle Steve Howe, and the
Ducks knew the Card defense
meant business and were forced

to punt.
Stanford put together its best
drive of the afternoon on the next
series, with running back Ron
Inge leading the way. Inge took
the ball on the tirst play for a
22-yard run up the middle.
After a short run by fullback
Don Stevenson and an incom
plete pass to end Bill kellar, Inge
carried the ball three consecu
tive times for another first down.
Inge's largest gain — five yards
— came with a little help from
offensive tackle Cordy King,
who prevented Inge from getting
tripped up early by picking him
up and throwing him ahead of a
pileup for three more yards.

Read was still stunned by Wat

"Our play was designed to
beat their coverage. I'm not sure
whether Henderson threw the
ball early or just what hap
pened."
'Defense the key'
"The key to our win was de

"We weren't quite sure what
Oregon was going to do before
we got out there because they
can run and pass," Evans said.
"We just knew we had to try to

Eugene, Ore. — Bright green
and yellow Oregon football pub
licity posters this year heralded
the Duck offense as "Wide
Open." But the only thing "Wide
Open" Saturday was Duck head
coach Don Read's mouth.
An Autzen Stadium crowd of
18,000 watched as a hungry
Stanford defense delt Oregon its
sixth consecutive loss, 28-17.
The first Card score came with
just 4:01 gone in the game, when
senior safety Rich Waters inter
cepted a pass from Duck quar
terback Jack Henderson in
tended for Oregon's top receiver
Greg Bauer. Waters turned on his
speed and raced 48 yards down
the right sideline to put the first
six points on the scoreboard for
Stanford.
Five interceptions
Waters' interception was the
first of two and the first of five
the Cards had against the Ducks.
A little over a minute after
Waters' touchdown, middle
linebacker Gordy Ceresino in
tercepted another Henderson
pass at the Oregon 43 and"the
Bear" took the ball 17 yards up
the left sideline to set up the
Cards' second score.
Stanford quarterback Guy
Benjamin came in and unloaded
a 26-yard pass deep over the
middle to flanker Tony Hill, on
the first play after the steal.
On the ensuing series, the
tough Stanford defense kept the
Ducks contained within their
own 48-yard line — letting them
move the ball only 21 yards.
Here's how it went.
Defense tough
Ceresino deflected a Hender
son pass right into the hands of
Bauer for 11 yards. Then Ca-d
defensive end Chuck Evans, in
censed by the first down the
Ducks made on the tip by Cere
sino, crashed through the Ore
gon offensive line, got his arms
around running back George
Bennett just after he had taken
the handoff from Henderson,
and threw Bennett for a two-yard
loss.
On a run up the middle, Hen
derson was met immediately by
Stanford linebacker Jeff Barton
and tackle Steve Howe, and the
Ducks knew the Card defense
meant business and were forced

to punt.
Stanford put together its best
drive of the afternoon on the next
series, with running back Ron
Inge leading the way. Inge took
the ball on the tirst play for a
22-yard run up the middle.
After a short run by fullback
Don Stevenson and an incom
plete pass to end Bill kellar, Inge
carried the ball three consecu
tive times for another first down.
Inge's largest gain — five yards
— came with a little help from
offensive tackle Cordy King,
who prevented Inge from getting
tripped up early by picking him
up and throwing him ahead of a
pileup for three more yards.
Hill's second TD
Benjamin fired a 12-yard
touchdown pass to Hill in the
right corner of the end zone to
cap the 83-yard scoring march
and give the Cards a 21-0 lead.
Oregon was able to put only
three points on the board in the
tirst half. The Ducks put together
their only real scoring march of
thefirst half but theCard defense
shut down the Oregon ground
game.
After Evans deflected a Hen
derson pass, intended for Bauer,
the Ducks brought in Roy Geiger
to kick a 42-yard field goal.
Official's gift
The rest of the half saw no at
tempts at scoring until no time
was left. Stanford controlled the
ball on the final series of the half
and on the last play of the quarter
an Oregon player committed a
personal foul.
Stanford got a first down and
Mike Michel was called in to
kick a 51-yard field goal.
Michel's boot was short, but the
Ducks were guilty of holding
and Michel got another shot
from 15 yards closer. This time
his 36-yard field goal was wide
right.
The Oregon rushing game
opened up in the second half
against the pass-minded Card
defense. With 3:57 left in the
third quarter, Henderson hit
running back Jim Johnson on a
swing pass for 30 yards and a TD.
Henderson's two point conver
sion pass failed and the score
stood at 21-9.
Stanford got a break after an
unsuccessful series which

forced Michel to punt. Oregon
fumbled the punt and the Cards'
John Olenchalk fell on the ball.
The Cards got another gift when
the Ducks were penalized for a
foul, so Benjamin took over from
the Oregon 13. Running back
Phil Francis got the ball into the
end zone on a 10-yard run
around the left side.
Scoring drought
The Ducks tried to surpass
their season high game of 22
points, with the game out of
reach in the fourth quarter. The
Cards played just hard enough to
keep Oregon from scoring more
than one touchdown.
After Benjamin fumbled a
snapat thebeginning of the final
quarter, Oregon recovered the
ball but only got far enough to
attempt a 58-yard field goal,
thanks to an 11-yard quarterback
sack by Jeff Barton.
The Ducks did score however
with 1:22 left in the game on a
pitch inside to Johnson who
needed only a yard for the
touchdown. Oregon added two
more points on a run by reserve
quarterback Jerry Jurich. The
Ducks went 77 yards in 12 plays
and made the final score, 28-17.
Stanford has given away a lot

own 48-yard line — letting them
move the ball only 21 yards.
Here's how it went.
Defense tough
Ceresino deflected a Hender
son pass right into the hands of
Bauer for 11 yards. Then Ca-d
defensive end Chuck Evans, in
censed by the first down the
Ducks made on the tip by Cere
sino, crashed through the Ore
gon offensive line, got his arms
around running back George
Bennett just after he had taken
the handoff from Henderson,
and threw Bennett for a two-yard
loss.
On a run up the middle, Hen
derson was met immediately by
Stanford linebacker Jeff Barton
and tackle Steve Howe, and the
Ducks knew the Card defense
meant business and were forced

to punt.
Stanford put together its best
drive of the afternoon on the next
series, with running back Ron
Inge leading the way. Inge took
the ball on the tirst play for a
22-yard run up the middle.
After a short run by fullback
Don Stevenson and an incom
plete pass to end Bill kellar, Inge
carried the ball three consecu
tive times for another first down.
Inge's largest gain — five yards
— came with a little help from
offensive tackle Cordy King,
who prevented Inge from getting
tripped up early by picking him
up and throwing him ahead of a
pileup for three more yards.
Hill's second TD
Benjamin fired a 12-yard
touchdown pass to Hill in the
right corner of the end zone to
cap the 83-yard scoring march
and give the Cards a 21-0 lead.
Oregon was able to put only
three points on the board in the
tirst half. The Ducks put together
their only real scoring march of
thefirst half but theCard defense
shut down the Oregon ground
game.
After Evans deflected a Hen
derson pass, intended for Bauer,
the Ducks brought in Roy Geiger
to kick a 42-yard field goal.
Official's gift
The rest of the half saw no at
tempts at scoring until no time
was left. Stanford controlled the
ball on the final series of the half
and on the last play of the quarter
an Oregon player committed a
personal foul.
Stanford got a first down and
Mike Michel was called in to
kick a 51-yard field goal.
Michel's boot was short, but the
Ducks were guilty of holding
and Michel got another shot
from 15 yards closer. This time
his 36-yard field goal was wide
right.
The Oregon rushing game
opened up in the second half
against the pass-minded Card
defense. With 3:57 left in the
third quarter, Henderson hit
running back Jim Johnson on a
swing pass for 30 yards and a TD.
Henderson's two point conver
sion pass failed and the score
stood at 21-9.
Stanford got a break after an
unsuccessful series which

forced Michel to punt. Oregon
fumbled the punt and the Cards'
John Olenchalk fell on the ball.
The Cards got another gift when
the Ducks were penalized for a
foul, so Benjamin took over from
the Oregon 13. Running back
Phil Francis got the ball into the
end zone on a 10-yard run
around the left side.
Scoring drought
The Ducks tried to surpass
their season high game of 22
points, with the game out of
reach in the fourth quarter. The
Cards played just hard enough to
keep Oregon from scoring more
than one touchdown.
After Benjamin fumbled a
snapat thebeginning of the final
quarter, Oregon recovered the
ball but only got far enough to
attempt a 58-yard field goal,
thanks to an 11-yard quarterback
sack by Jeff Barton.
The Ducks did score however
with 1:22 left in the game on a
pitch inside to Johnson who
needed only a yard for the
touchdown. Oregon added two
more points on a run by reserve
quarterback Jerry Jurich. The
Ducks went 77 yards in 12 plays
and made the final score, 28-17.
Stanford has given away a lot
of its ball games this season but
Saturday they were on the re
ceiving end. Head coach Jack
Christiansen said after the game.
"I think getting the breaks early
in the game, like that intercep
tion (Waters' 48-yard TD) is what
we needed to win.
"1 think if we would have had
more of those this season, we
wouldn't be in the situation we
are now — fighting to have a
winning season."
Pressure
"We really wanted to win this
game," said Evans. "We want a
winning season and we wanted
to win it for Coach Chris. He's
gotten so many hassles from tin;
alumni and press about his job."
In the Oregon locker room, a
frustrated and teary-eyed Read
realized he had probably just
coached his last game in Autzen
Stadium. The third-year coach
has been on the hot seat all year.
Read was still stunned by Wat
ers' 48-vard interception.
"Our play was designed to
beat their coverage. I'm not sure
whether Henderson threw the
ball early or just what hap
pened."
'Defense the key'
"The key to our win was de
fense," said Christiansen.
"We weren't quite sure what
Oregon was going to do before
we got out there because they
can run and pass," Evans said.
"We just knew we had to try to
keep them from getting points
on the board."
Evans and Ceresino said that
Waters' interception sparked the
Card defense. "From that point
on," Ceresino said, "we were
very confident. I wish the breaks
would've come earlier in the
season for us."
