### Arlene Kishi Staff writer 
An anonymous supporter of univer
sity athletics has donated $1000 in
order to make the annual pre-BigGame
Bonfire possible Friday night, accord
ing to Jordan Schwartz. Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC) president.
A shortage of funds threatened to
cancel the bonfire, but the necessary
balance was raised in time for last Fri
day's IFC] meeting when the members
re-voted 15-4 in its favor, with two
houses abstaining.
The check was donated to a fund
drive run by the IFC to finance the bon
fire. but Delta Tau Delta member Steve
Schwartz, who was working as a fun
draiser, would not name the source.
"The money is an extension to us.
It's on a condition that we will try to
raise the funds ourselves. So we want
to pay him back later in full," said
Schwartz.
Schwartz said the donor would fi
nance the Bonfire if the IFC were un
able to raise the necessarv funds.
As of Friday, the minimum estimate
for the bonfire cost was $1650 and the
maximum $2234, according to Bonfire
Chairman Ken Remson. This figure in
cludes approximately $450 for police
protection, $336 for the P.A. system
and $296 for telephone poles, among
other expenses.
"On Wednesday it looked like we
would be $1500 under budget, but due
to generous contributions and support

from alumni, it now appears like it is
again feasible," Remson said. IFC pres
ident Schwartz added, "There's an
enormous task ahead. Hut it's one that
we'll be easily able to handle provided
we get the active support of all the
fraternities. And 1 think that when you
see the great bonfire we're going to
have next Friday night, you'll know
that we had full support and coopera
tion."
Work on the bonfire will begin today
with bulldozing of Lake Lagunita, de
livery of the telephone poles and col
lection of the wood from Hurlingame,
according to Remson. This year, over
five truckloads of clean-burning wood
will be used.
Actual construction starts tomorrow
vvi th fraternity members si nking t he 30
foot telephone poles by hand. The
structure will be circular and as hol
low as possible. Heginning early
Thursday, people will be working
around the clock finishing the 25 loot
high. 20 foot wide conglomeration.
Meanwhile, other fraternity mem
bers will be on guard at White Plaza
starting tomorrow or Wednesday night
trying to prevent any Cal infiltration.
IFC President Schwartz is attempt
ing to organize a rally to accompany
the bonfire. The rally is expected to
begin at 6:3oand Schwartz has invited
former Stanford football players Jim
Plunkett and Gene Washington to
speak at the rally, and is currently
awaiting their responses. The Band is
also expected to make an appearance.
