Champagne showers provided the only
dampening effect on Stanford's field hoc
key team this weekend, as the triumphant
scotchers celebrated their sweep of the
WAIAW Regional Tournament and anau
tomatic invitation to the Nationals next
week in Philadelphia.
After overcoming the pressure in two
hard-fought victories against Cal-Poly
Pomona (2-0) and San Diego State (2-0) on
Friday. Stanford was ready for its final
revenge in the title-clinching game
against San lose State Saturday.
The gritty Spartans, who beat the Cards
1-0 last week, were equally psyched. In a
tense game for players and spectators
.ilike. both teams battled for critical
penetration time and the crucial "Golden
Coal."
Tough defense
Stanford out-played San Jose during
the first half, keeping the ball on their
scoring side of the 25-yard line. Despite
repeated, well-executed attempts to
score, the Cards were unable to drill the
ball past a stubborn Spartan defense.
The only score of the game was pushed
in by senior forward kathy Levinson.
Celebrating her last home Stanford hoc
key game in style, she followed up a pen
alty shot by Onnie Killefer. brilliantly

The Spartans took control of the second

half, gaining in penetration time and re
peatedly attacking the goal. If San Jose
was operating on its second wind, the
Cards were visibly beginning to wind
down, and were forced to call upon all
their defensive resources to prevent a
Spartan goal.
Long half
"That second half was the longest 35
minutes I've ever experienced in my life."
said coach Shirley Schoof.
Admitting that San Jose State "out
played us" the second half, she added.
"We didn't play our best. We were too
keyed, too anxious and weren't able to
concentrate."
killefer, who displayed cool, masterful
stickwork throughout the tournament,
felt that it was "really an emotional game
for both teams. We were all a little
scared."
Nancy White, who was instrumental in
driving the ball downfield with her insis
tent tacking, said. "San Jose's known for
its second half comebacks. We knew that
and thought about it and got scared." She
added, "We were getting tired. But our
teamwork was pretty good. At least you
knew someone was always there to pass
to."
In contrast to the San Jose State game,
the Cards played what Schoof called "our
best game of the season" against Cal-Poly
Pomona in their Regional opener.
The game followed two losses to Chico

State and San Jose State, and as Schoof
put it, "There was no way we were going
to lose a third."
Scotchers saved
Indeed, the scotchers redeemed them
selves in a beautifully executed game,
displaying the hustle, helpful chatter,
confidence, and aggressive teamwork
which were sorely lacking in their previ
ous games.
Sophomore wing Alison King scored
the first point for the Cards by driving
through heavy defensive congestion in
the circle. Kiliefer brought the score to 2-0
with a characteristically solid whack ort a
penalty shot.
Other stellar performances include
Mandy Read and Sukie lackson for ad
mirable hustle and always "being in the
right place at the right time." and Jane
Soyster and Levinson for feisty, intelli
gent stic.kwork. Sophomore link Jessie
C.errard also played a superb game.
Mandy Read and Ki liefer scored for the
Cards against San Diego State in a less
inspired but well-played game.
The scotchers leave next Monday for
Philadelphia to compete for the national
title. The Athletic Department will fi
nance the team through a special budget
for national tournaments. Stanford is one
of IB teams in the four-year collegiate di
vision of the tournament The Cards must
lose no more than three games to ward off
the threat of elimination.
