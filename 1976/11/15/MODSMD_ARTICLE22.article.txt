Oregon. turning back
Washington State's bid to cap
ture a second consecutive
Pacific-8 cross country title, won
the NCAA District-8 qualifying
meet Saturday at the Stanford
Coif Course.
Henry Rono, a Kenyan soldier
running as a freshman for WSU,
won the battle for individual
laurels by covering the 10,000-
meter circuit in a course record
of 29:18.6, more than half a mi
nute ahead of runnerup Terry
Williams ot Oregon.
In addition to Oregon and
Washington State, Washington
and San Diego State, which
claimed the Pacific Coast Athle
tic Association crown at Satur
day's meet, qualified teams for
the NCAA Championships Nov.
22 at North Texas State in De
nton, Tex.
Card duo qualifies
The top eight finishers from
non-qualifying teams also re
ceived berths in the NCAA meet.
Senior Frank Boutin and
sophomore Jerry Emory of Stan
ford qualified for the intercol
legiate championships as they
finished 18th and 19th, respec
tively.
WSlJ's Kenyan trio of Rono.
Joshua Kimeto and Samson
Komombwa took the field out
with a quick early pace the
Cougar threesome coming by the
first-mile mark at 4:33.
Rono and Kimeto had a com
fortable lead by the three-mile
post, with Oregon's Williams

running third, Kimombwa
fourth, and Oregon freshmen
Rudy Chapa and Alberto Salazar
together in fifth and sixth. The
rest of the field lagged far be
hind.
By the five-mile mark Rono
had a six-second margin over
teammate Kimeto. Williams and
Kimombwa trailed in third and
fourth. But strange things hap
pened in the last mile.
Kimombwa hurt
Kimombwa's leg caught Wil
liams for a second and the Ke
nyan dropped off to leave Wil
liams uncontested. Then, sev
eral hundred yards from the
finish line, Kimeto. the defend
ing Pac-8 champion, came to a
complete stop. He waited for
Williams to pass him, and then
continued unceremoniously to
the finish line.
"A couple of weeks ago we ran
into each other at the (Pac-8)
Northern Division meet," Wil
liams said. "Today he said, 'I'll
make it up to you.' He just stop
ped and let me pass him and
then he started jogging to the
finish."
Oregon, which placed five
runners among the top 10 Pac-8
finishers, won the conference
title with a score of 31.
Washington State finished with
45. San Diego State won the
PCAA crown led by Ceorge Pul
len, who finished seventh over
all and first among conference
runners.
Oregon won the NCAA title in
1973 and 1974 before relinquish

ing it to Texas-El Paso last year.
With a healthy Dave Taylor, a
former Ail-American who sat
out the race Saturday with a
twinge in his hamstring, Oregon
stands a good chance to regain
its lost crown.
"We'll run away with it (the
NCAA meet)," Williams said.
"We've got it easy. I can see no
one coming close to us."
While the Ducks basked in
their victory and dreamed of
greater triumphs, the host Car
dinals were also enjoying a
modest amount of success with
the performances of Boutin and
Emory.
"It was one of our happier
Pac-8 meets." coach Marshall
Clark said. "The team had a solid
performance and everyone ran a
sensible race."

Kimombwa hurt
Kimombwa's leg caught Wil

finish line, Kimeto. the defend

complete stop. He waited for
Williams to pass him, and then
continued unceremoniously to
the finish line.
"A couple of weeks ago we ran
into each other at the (Pac-8)
Northern Division meet," Wil
liams said. "Today he said, 'I'll
make it up to you.' He just stop

then he started jogging to the
finish."
Oregon, which placed five
runners among the top 10 Pac-8
finishers, won the conference
title with a score of 31.
Washington State finished with

Oregon won the NCAA title in
1973 and 1974 before relinquish

With a healthy Dave Taylor, a
former Ail-American who sat
out the race Saturday with a
twinge in his hamstring, Oregon
stands a good chance to regain
its lost crown.
"We'll run away with it (the
NCAA meet)," Williams said.
"We've got it easy. I can see no
one coming close to us."
While the Ducks basked in
their victory and dreamed of
greater triumphs, the host Car

Emory.
"It was one of our happier
