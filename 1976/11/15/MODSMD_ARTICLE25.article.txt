# JV gridders humiliate Cal
## 
### 
The rain let up most of Friday
afternoon but the Cardinal JV's
poured it on in Stanford Stadium
before several hundred people,
drowning the California JV's
49-17 to end the season.
Coach Don I'rease was more
than pleased with his team's big
ettort. He praised the hard
hitting defense, led by Redmond
Burke's "almost a thousand tack
les." as wel I as the wel l-halanced
offense, which rolled up 255
yards on the turf and 2 Mi more in
the air.
Mark Lightfoot led the Stan
ford rushers with 80 yards. Joe
Rominger and Jack Buncecalled
the signals for the Cards, and the
two combined for a <i(i per cent
completion mark.
Ironically enough. Cal opened
up the scoring with a 40-yard
pass from Joe Harris, who com
pleted just nine of 22 passes, to
Bill Kemp. With just live mi
nutes gone, the scoreboard
showed 7-0.
TheCards crossed thegoal just
three minutes later on a 14-yard
floater from Rominger to Rick
Parker.
Two first half field goals by
Rick Baum were complemented
by a one-yard plunge from Gor
die Banks to give Stanford a 19-7
ha 1 fti me edge.
Baum dropped the ball
through a third time to open the
second half of action, which
found Cal fumbling and bumbl
ing itself into even hotter water.
