Plains church relents on racial ban
Plains, Cia. — The members of President-elect Jimmy Carter's
Uaptist Church voted yesterday to end racial barriers to church
membership — a move long backed by Carter.
Carter, leaving Plains Baptist Church, stood in the rain and
said: "I was proud of my church."
"The sun is shining on the South again," said the Rev. Clennon
King, the black minister from Albany, Ca.. who stirred the con
troversy anew a month ago when he announced he would seek
membership in the church.
"They may growl and grimace, but they're the sweetest white
lolks on earth," King added.
King, who awaited the verdict while standing in a chilly rain,
can now return to Plains next Sunday and apply for church
membership.
Carter emerged from the Pains Baptist Church altera three-hour
closed meeting to report that his fellow church members also had
voted not to fire their pastor, the Rev. Bruce Edwards. He said they
had decided to set up a "watch care" committee to judge the
qualifications of any person desiring to join the church.
Asked whether he exerted any influence over the congregation,
he said "I was just one of the church members. I'm completely
satisfied with the church. The pastor is pleased. There will be no
exclusion based on race."
Syrian troops descend on Lebanese capital
Beirut, Lebanon — The commander of the Arab peacekeeping
force in Lebanon ordered civilians and combatants to clear the
streets of Beirut today to make way for Syrian froops descending
on the capital.
"I wish to advise the population that failure to cooperate with
the Arab deterrent forces will be dealt with hy violence," said Col.
Ahmed el-Haj, the Lebanese commander of the force. His order
took effect yesterday.
Palestinian guerrilla sources said their chieftain, Yasir Arafat,
ordered his security offices in Moslem-held West Beirut to close
down, leaving only a skeleton staff to await the Syrian assump
tion of security duties.
But occasional shelling and volleys of machine gun fire could
still be heard last night in the downtown commercial district.
Hospital sources in Beirut reported 10 persons killed in the last
24-hour period.
Leftist-held Beirut Radio announced that the pan-Arab peace
force, almost entirely Syrian, would take over the battle zones in
the heart of the city at dawn today in a new attempt to end the
fighting.
IRS investigates South Korean kickbacks
Chicago — The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is investigating
allegations that congressmen suspected of receiving kickbacks or
bribes from South Korean agents had deposited them in Baha
mian banks, the Chicago Tribune said yesterday.
The investigation amounts to a revival of an IRS probe code
named Operation Haven, begun in 1973 to determine whether
Americans used banks in the Bahamas as tax shelters, the Tribune

said.
Operation Haven, which agents believed could have resulted in
one of the largest tax recoveries ever, was dropped after reports
that some government investigators used questionable methods,
including stealing a bank official's briefcase, the newspaper said.
The Tribune said an IRS spokesman confirmed Friday its inves
tigators are in the Bahamas, justice Department agents also were
sent to the Bahamas in recent months to aid the IRS probe, the
report said.
The FBI has been looking into records of eight House members
and two former members in connection with the alleged bribery,
the Tribune added.
A former South Korean embassy official, Jai Mvon Lee, was
quoted by the newspaper as saying that in 1973 the embassy
formulated a plan to "mute criticism" of the regime of President
Park Chung Kee of South Korea "and to buy off supporters in the
United States."
FDA to charge research labs
Washington — A wide-ranging Food and Drug Administration
investigation will result in criminal charges against research
laboratories that deliberately falsified safety test data on new
drugs and food additives, says outgoing Commissioner Alexan
der Schmidt.
The poor quality of some toxicological and drug research test
ing on animals, which the FDA relies upon to assure that new
products will not harm humans, is "one of the most disturbing
things but not one of the most surprising," Schmidt said he
learned during his three and one-half years as commissioner.
"What's been most disturbing is the frank falsification of data.
We have found that too often," he said in an interview.
"In the next three or four months, we will complete our survey
of 40 laboratories — university, pharmaceutical and contract —
and at the end of that time we will have a much better idea about
the kind of research in this country. We will have criminal cases
coming out of our investigations," Schmidt said.
Schmidt did not identify the firms that might face criminal
prosecution.
Convict Gilmore wants prompt death

questions can be first resolved said yesterday future legal efforts
will depend on the board's decision.
Attorney V. (inks Dabney of the American Civil Liberties Union

execution could set precedents damaging to his clients' appeals.
