## 
### Kathy Trafton Staff writer 
An ASS I) Senate committee researching the Committee of 15
(C-l5) will recommend to the senate tonight that the C-15 be
reconvened to judge such matters as the composition of the Stu
dent judicial Council and the workings of the Honor Code, ac
cording to senate chairman Pat Hall.
I'he senate will meet in the Junipero-Madera dining room of
Wilbur Hall at 7::U). The senate voted to meet in student dor
mitories two weeks ago to encourage public attendance.
The senate will also discuss fee assessment reforms, according
to Hall. The senate may pass a resolution stating that any organi
zation that asks for a fee assessment may have its books audited,
and that "organizations that have received assessments in the
past may be required to present a detailed accounting of where
their money went," said Hall.
An "anti-benign neglect resolution" intended to strengthen
student organizations will be discussed, said Sen. Jeff Stoler. The
resolution would encourage more liberal provisions of the half
workload status for students highly active in student activities,
would call for lessening of restrictions on solicitations of alumni
support, and would call for greater university funding for student
organizations, Stoler said.
The bylaws committee will recommend that two faculty mem
bers be added to the Course Cuide Hoard. The board is presently
comprised of two ASSU Senators, two students and one member
of the Council of Presidents. "We think it'll make it (the board)
more balanced. It'll give a better image as being fair to both
students and faculty. Of course, the faculty won't have a major
ity," said Sen. Jon Barth.
