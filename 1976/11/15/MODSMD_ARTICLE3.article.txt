## 
### Robert Mauro Staff writer 
A compromise bomb search contract
was signed late last week by university
vice president Robert Augsburger and
Stanford Police Officers' Association
president Herman Williams after
months ot negotiations.
According to Marvi 11 Herrington, di
rector of the Department of Public
Safety, all community service officers
and deputized police officers may be
i ailed upon to search buildings in the
event of a bomb threat. I Inder the con
tra < t. additional insurance coverage is
provided for all Department of Public
Safety personnel involved in the
searches.
A $100,000 accidental death and
dismemberment policy, a major part of
the contract signed last Thursday, will
be provided by the university for all
police personnel. The injury need not
be incurred during a bomb search in
order lor the policy to apply, said Her
rington.
According to Herrington, in addi
tion to the death and dismemberment
policy, present coverage for commun
ity service officers will be extended to
include injuries related to bomb
searches.
(Community Services Officers are re
sponsible for building security and
parking control. Most law enforce
ment functions are performed by de
putized police officers who are reserve
deputy sheriffs.
Immediate coverage
"In t li«? event a bomb went off,
(overage would take effect im
mediately. It provides day-one cover
age if someone is injured as a result of a
bomb blast, like a cornice falling from
a building," said Herrington.
Herrington said the previous policy
took effect 45 days after the injury oc
curred, at which time the officer was
entitled to receive an amount equal to
00- 1 per cent of his regular pay until
able to return to duty. Sick leave and
vacation pay usually were used to sus
tain tlie individual in the intervening
period before the coverage took effect.
Under the new contract, dav-one
< overage for community services is
provided lor unusual accidents related
to bomb searches.
Unusual events
"(The coverage) is limited to some
thing unusual. <1 fall from heights, a
steam pipe bursting, not just walking
down the hallway . . . doing some
thing they ordinarily would not be cal
led upon to do," said Herrington.
According to Herrington, deputized
police officers are not included under
this phase of the contract since they

can be called upon to search for evi
dence and suspects in the course of
their normal duties.
Williams had previously charged
that the university's position was un
acceptable, but he said he was satisfied
with the final contract.
'We're satisfied'
"It's a lot better than their (the uni
versity's) first terms. We sat down and
talked. . . . We didn't get all what we
wanted, but we're satisfied," he said.
Since the Oct. 1 merger of the uni
versity's and Palo Alto's fire depart
ments, and the subsequent transfer
ence of bomb deactivation and search
duties to the Department of Public
Safety, there has been no bomb squad
here.
Although search duties will be
handled by both community service
officers and deputized police officers
under the new contract, plans for a
bomb deactivation team have not been
made final.
All deputized police officers un
dergo bomb search instruction in their
police academy training. In addition,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation
presented a refresher course on bomb
search procedures and bomb recogni
tion to police personnel here two
months ago, according to Herrington.
Chief Herrington and two police
captains attended an extensive three
day course in bomb search, recogni
tion, and after-explosion investigation
presented by the Treasury Department
two weeks ago.

with the final contract.
'We're satisfied'
"It's a lot better than their (the uni
versity's) first terms. We sat down and
talked. . . . We didn't get all what we
wanted, but we're satisfied," he said.
Since the Oct. 1 merger of the uni
versity's and Palo Alto's fire depart
ments, and the subsequent transfer
ence of bomb deactivation and search
duties to the Department of Public
Safety, there has been no bomb squad
here.
Although search duties will be
handled by both community service
officers and deputized police officers
under the new contract, plans for a
bomb deactivation team have not been
made final.
All deputized police officers un
dergo bomb search instruction in their
police academy training. In addition,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation
presented a refresher course on bomb
search procedures and bomb recogni
tion to police personnel here two
months ago, according to Herrington.
Chief Herrington and two police
captains attended an extensive three
day course in bomb search, recogni
tion, and after-explosion investigation
presented by the Treasury Department
two weeks ago.
A compromise bomb search contract
was signed late last week by university
vice president Robert Augsburger and
Stanford Police Officers' Association
president Herman Williams after
months ot negotiations.
According to Marvi 11 Herrington, di
rector of the Department of Public
Safety, all community service officers
and deputized police officers may be
i ailed upon to search buildings in the
event of a bomb threat. I Inder the con
tra < t. additional insurance coverage is
provided for all Department of Public
Safety personnel involved in the
searches.
A $100,000 accidental death and
dismemberment policy, a major part of
the contract signed last Thursday, will
be provided by the university for all
police personnel. The injury need not
be incurred during a bomb search in
order lor the policy to apply, said Her
rington.
According to Herrington, in addi
tion to the death and dismemberment
policy, present coverage for commun
ity service officers will be extended to
include injuries related to bomb
searches.
(Community Services Officers are re
sponsible for building security and
parking control. Most law enforce
ment functions are performed by de
putized police officers who are reserve
deputy sheriffs.
Immediate coverage
"In t li«? event a bomb went off,
(overage would take effect im
mediately. It provides day-one cover
age if someone is injured as a result of a
bomb blast, like a cornice falling from
a building," said Herrington.
Herrington said the previous policy
took effect 45 days after the injury oc
curred, at which time the officer was
entitled to receive an amount equal to
00- 1 per cent of his regular pay until
able to return to duty. Sick leave and
vacation pay usually were used to sus
tain tlie individual in the intervening
period before the coverage took effect.
Under the new contract, dav-one
< overage for community services is
provided lor unusual accidents related
to bomb searches.
Unusual events
"(The coverage) is limited to some
thing unusual. <1 fall from heights, a
steam pipe bursting, not just walking
down the hallway . . . doing some
thing they ordinarily would not be cal
led upon to do," said Herrington.
According to Herrington, deputized
police officers are not included under
this phase of the contract since they

can be called upon to search for evi
dence and suspects in the course of
their normal duties.
Williams had previously charged
that the university's position was un
acceptable, but he said he was satisfied
with the final contract.
