## Tight controls stalled 
### Bob Svikhart Staff writer 
The California Public Broadcasting
Commission postponed a decision on
,i proposal from the Committee to Save
k(JKI) that would have placed stricter
guidelines on public broadcasting sta
tions during a meeting Friday at Tre
sidder I 'nion.
The committee's proposal would re
<pllr»» .ill public broadcasting stations
receiving funds from the commission
to conduct all their business in public,
provide public access to their files and
records and provide 60 minutes per
week of "opportunities for extended
disi ussion" at the station's expense.
The staff of the commission is op
posed to this proposal, stating that
"this commission is a urant-makinu

body, not a regulatory agency . . . that
the Committee to Save KQED is asking
the commission to do for it, by general
regulation, that which the courts and
the legislature until now have refused
to do," and that forcing stations to give
away air time would be "unpre
cedented regulation."
The commission, which has approx
imately $165,000 to distribute to pub
lic broadcasting. postponed a decision
in order to assess its overall financial
picture. The commission wants to es
tablish a Sacramento bureau for public
broadcasting, but has no estimate of
what the cost for this project would be.
Therefore, the commission wants to
receive a cost proposal at its next meet
ing for the Sacramento bureau before

making decisions on the allocation of
funds to local stations.
KQED. a San Francisco-based sta
tion. is asking for $55,000, while KPBS
(San Diego) is asking for $27,000.
The commission agreed to grant
$ 15.000 to independent video and film
producers for a demonstration project
of low-cost video or film production.
In another matter. Commission
Chairman Frederick Nicholaus post
poned the announcement of a Citizens'
Advisory Committee for the commis
sion. Nicholaus said that he is still ac
cepting applications for the commit
tee. and that the members of the advis
ory council will be named next montfl
The commission will convene again
Dec. 3 in Los Anaeles.
