# Computer service due

### Martin Kernberg Staff writer 
A new computer complex which
will provide free service for teaching,
unsponsored research and general
computing is expected to be available
by January 3, 1977, according to Man
ager Ralph Gorin.
The computer facility, I.OTS (Low
Overhead Time-Sharing), will be open
to all students and faculty here.
The $400.000 computer complex,
comprised of a Digital Equipment
Corporation (DEC) 2040 computer,
printers, and 4H terminals, will be lo
cated in rooms 105 and 128 of the Stan
ford Center for Research and De
velopment in Teaching (SCRDT), ad
jacent to the law school.
Additional terminal clusters and
printers will be set up in the Engineer

ing Corner of the o»i<id. room 303, and
in Cedar Hall.
In earlier stages, Cedar Hall was
proposed as the main site for the new
facility. Because of the $75,000 cost for
remodeling and air conditioning of
Cedar, the administration decided to
place the computer in SCRDT where
the planning office has undertaken the
necessary, but less expensive, remod
eling.
Free to students
The use of LOTS, funded by
$225,000 per year to be drawn from the
academic computing reserve, will he
free to all students and faculty. Priority
will be given by the I ,OTS office (Room
105, SCRDT) to applications involving
course work in engineering, computer
science, social science and other
academic disciplines.

Gorin expects a substantive transfer
of university courses to LOTS from
those now using the IBM computer
model 370/168 at Stanford Center for
Computer Processing (SCIP),a $4 mill
ion workhorse located in Encina Hall.
These transfers should be completed
by fall. 1977, added Gorin.
Preparatory work in room modifica
tions within SCRDT, installation of the
DEC 2040, and building of the video
terminals is under way.
Computer languages
The LOTS system, once completed,
will have the following computer lan
guages. FORTRAN. LISP, SAIL dialect
of ALGOL. BASIC, PDP-10 assembly
language, and SPSS. LOTS employs an
on-line system which permits direct
interaction with the computer in writ
ing and correcting programs as op
posed to batch processing in which
data and programs are punched on
cards and processed by a card reader.
LOTS, according to Professor John
McCarthy of the Computer Science
Department, will have a staff of only
four people in order to reduce over
head costs: a manager, a student co
ordinator, a systems programmer, and
an administrative assistant.
Unlike SCIP, which offers extensive
and expensive assistance to graduate
students and faculty. LOTS will not
offer consultation services to its users.
New users will have to rely on prog
ramming manuals available at the
Stanford Bookstore, error messages
from the computer itself, aid from
more experienced users, and. for those
in formal courses, direction from the
teaching assistants. Moreover. LOTS
will depend on student volunteers.
"Besides informal help, we expect a
free market in programming and con
sulting for researchers to develop."
notes McCarthy.
Users, after brief training, will pai
ticipate directly in maintaining i oin
puter services: they will tear off their
own printer listings, load paper, and
restart the system after "crashes"
(computer breakdowns) according to
David Roode, student coordinator ot
LOTS.
C.orin has set as a goal 24-hour ser
vice, seven days a week, but he expe< ts
that in actual practice LOTS will pro
vide service 92 to 95 per cent of the
time throughout the week. SCIP pre
sently provides service Hf> per cent ol
the week, according to C.orin.

Free to students
The use of LOTS, funded by
$225,000 per year to be drawn from the
academic computing reserve, will he
free to all students and faculty. Priority
will be given by the I ,OTS office (Room
105, SCRDT) to applications involving
course work in engineering, computer
science, social science and other
academic disciplines.

Gorin expects a substantive transfer
of university courses to LOTS from
those now using the IBM computer
model 370/168 at Stanford Center for
Computer Processing (SCIP),a $4 mill
ion workhorse located in Encina Hall.
These transfers should be completed
by fall. 1977, added Gorin.
Preparatory work in room modifica
tions within SCRDT, installation of the
DEC 2040, and building of the video
terminals is under way.
Computer languages
The LOTS system, once completed,
will have the following computer lan
guages. FORTRAN. LISP, SAIL dialect
of ALGOL. BASIC, PDP-10 assembly
language, and SPSS. LOTS employs an
on-line system which permits direct
interaction with the computer in writ
ing and correcting programs as op
posed to batch processing in which
data and programs are punched on
cards and processed by a card reader.
LOTS, according to Professor John
McCarthy of the Computer Science
Department, will have a staff of only
four people in order to reduce over
head costs: a manager, a student co
ordinator, a systems programmer, and
an administrative assistant.
Unlike SCIP, which offers extensive
and expensive assistance to graduate
students and faculty. LOTS will not
offer consultation services to its users.
New users will have to rely on prog
ramming manuals available at the
Stanford Bookstore, error messages
from the computer itself, aid from
more experienced users, and. for those
in formal courses, direction from the
teaching assistants. Moreover. LOTS
will depend on student volunteers.
"Besides informal help, we expect a
free market in programming and con
sulting for researchers to develop."
notes McCarthy.
Users, after brief training, will pai
ticipate directly in maintaining i oin
puter services: they will tear off their
own printer listings, load paper, and
restart the system after "crashes"
(computer breakdowns) according to
David Roode, student coordinator ot
LOTS.
C.orin has set as a goal 24-hour ser
vice, seven days a week, but he expe< ts
that in actual practice LOTS will pro
vide service 92 to 95 per cent of the
time throughout the week. SCIP pre
sently provides service Hf> per cent ol
the week, according to C.orin.
A new computer complex which
will provide free service for teaching,
unsponsored research and general
computing is expected to be available
by January 3, 1977, according to Man
ager Ralph Gorin.
The computer facility, I.OTS (Low
Overhead Time-Sharing), will be open
to all students and faculty here.
The $400.000 computer complex,
comprised of a Digital Equipment
Corporation (DEC) 2040 computer,
printers, and 4H terminals, will be lo
cated in rooms 105 and 128 of the Stan
ford Center for Research and De
velopment in Teaching (SCRDT), ad
jacent to the law school.
Additional terminal clusters and
printers will be set up in the Engineer

ing Corner of the o»i<id. room 303, and
in Cedar Hall.
In earlier stages, Cedar Hall was
proposed as the main site for the new
facility. Because of the $75,000 cost for
remodeling and air conditioning of
Cedar, the administration decided to
place the computer in SCRDT where
the planning office has undertaken the
necessary, but less expensive, remod
eling.
