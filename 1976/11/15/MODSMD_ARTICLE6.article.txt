"'mi v uooi i iai i
Residents of The Land, a community
of about 50 people living near Skyline
Drive, won a stay Friday of an order
which would have authorized demoli
tion of their houses.
Judge Peter Anello, after hearing ar
guments in Santa Clara County
SuperiorCourt from both sides, said he
had a number of briefs to consider in
the case and stated that "the court will
take the case under submission."
Norton Tooby, an attorney for the
residents of The Land, pointed out to
the court that the 10-day notice period
authorized in the judge's Nov. 2 order
granting plaintiff Alyce Burns police
protection in demolishing the houses
on the property would run out yester
day or today. He asked the judge if he
would be '"amenable to staying the
order."
Anello said "the court necessarily
has to stay the order" until a decision
can be made whether to completely
revoke the demolition order.
Tooby cited a previous claim of
Burns' attorney Frank Crist that Burns
had been prevented from demolishing
the structures with a bulldozer on Oc
tober 15. Tooby called this attempt "il
legal self-help."
No adequate legal remedy
Tooby argued that in order to justify
the issuance of an extraordinary writ,
like the one authorizing the demoli
tion, "the petitioner must plead and
prove that there is no adequate remedy

at law. This hasn't been pleaded, and it
couldn't be proved," he said.
added that Burns Was already
seeking to evict the residents through a
suit of unlawful detainer (eviction)
and that Grist's claim made during the
previous proceedings that his client
was without adequate remedy at law.
was untrue.
Tooby also accused Crist of simul
taneously saying that "the order
doesn't deprive you of your rights; it
just allows us to bulldoze your
homes."
'The safety of the people'
Crist argued against staying the or
der. saying "We find no authority
where a party can come in after a
judgment." He also claimed that "the
buildings are violative of every ordi
nance there is." He added that his
principle concern was "for the safety
of the people in the houses."
Palo Alto city attorney Robert
Booth, representing the city, which is
the defendant, said that "the city has
been very indulgent" in the case and
called the residents' defense of their
homes "an effort to stall the inevita
ble."
On the other hand, Anello said that
the residents were worried that "the
bulldozers will be there before the un
lawful detainer suit is settled" and ex
pressed doubt about Crist's contention
on behalf of Burns that the residents
wen? "trfisnassfirs."


He won
Norton Tooby, attorney for residents of The Land, argued in Santa Clara
Superior Court on Friday that his clients had been denied their rights by a
court order authorizing the demolition of their homes. He asked the judge
to block the demolition until a hearing could be held on the merits of the
case.


He lost
Frank Crist, attorney for Alyce Burns, told the Santa Clara Superior Court
that residents of The Land were living in houses that were "violative of
every ordinance there is' and that the houses should be torn down. He
asked the judge on Friday not to block the demolition order he had
approved November 2.
"Assuming their original entry was
leg.il," Anello posed tlie question for
Crist. "at what point did they be<nine
trespassers?"
Crist then claimed that "except for
possibly one or two," none of the resi
dents on The Land even had permis
sion to be there from Atherton
businessman Donald Eldridge, who is
disputing ownership of the land with
Burns. Residents in the audience ex
pressed disagreement with this con
tention.
Residents have until Nov. 24 to ans
wer the suit of unlawful detainer
which seeks to evict them, and then,
said Crist, a hearing would be
scheduled for a week or so after that

Residents of The Land, a community
of about 50 people living near Skyline
Drive, won a stay Friday of an order
which would have authorized demoli
tion of their houses.
Judge Peter Anello, after hearing ar
guments in Santa Clara County
SuperiorCourt from both sides, said he
had a number of briefs to consider in
the case and stated that "the court will
take the case under submission."
Norton Tooby, an attorney for the
residents of The Land, pointed out to
the court that the 10-day notice period
authorized in the judge's Nov. 2 order
granting plaintiff Alyce Burns police
protection in demolishing the houses
on the property would run out yester
day or today. He asked the judge if he
would be '"amenable to staying the
order."
Anello said "the court necessarily
has to stay the order" until a decision
can be made whether to completely
revoke the demolition order.
Tooby cited a previous claim of
Burns' attorney Frank Crist that Burns
had been prevented from demolishing
the structures with a bulldozer on Oc
tober 15. Tooby called this attempt "il
legal self-help."
No adequate legal remedy
Tooby argued that in order to justify
the issuance of an extraordinary writ,
like the one authorizing the demoli
tion, "the petitioner must plead and
prove that there is no adequate remedy

at law. This hasn't been pleaded, and it
couldn't be proved," he said.
added that Burns Was already
seeking to evict the residents through a
suit of unlawful detainer (eviction)
and that Grist's claim made during the
previous proceedings that his client
was without adequate remedy at law.
was untrue.
Tooby also accused Crist of simul
taneously saying that "the order
doesn't deprive you of your rights; it
just allows us to bulldoze your
homes."
'The safety of the people'
Crist argued against staying the or
der. saying "We find no authority
where a party can come in after a
judgment." He also claimed that "the
buildings are violative of every ordi
nance there is." He added that his
principle concern was "for the safety
of the people in the houses."
Palo Alto city attorney Robert
Booth, representing the city, which is
the defendant, said that "the city has
been very indulgent" in the case and
called the residents' defense of their
homes "an effort to stall the inevita
ble."
On the other hand, Anello said that
the residents were worried that "the
bulldozers will be there before the un
lawful detainer suit is settled" and ex
pressed doubt about Crist's contention
on behalf of Burns that the residents
wen? "trfisnassfirs."

Norton Tooby, attorney for residents of The Land, argued in Santa Clara
Superior Court on Friday that his clients had been denied their rights by a
court order authorizing the demolition of their homes. He asked the judge
to block the demolition until a hearing could be held on the merits of the
case.

Frank Crist, attorney for Alyce Burns, told the Santa Clara Superior Court
that residents of The Land were living in houses that were "violative of
every ordinance there is' and that the houses should be torn down. He
asked the judge on Friday not to block the demolition order he had
approved November 2.
"Assuming their original entry was
leg.il," Anello posed tlie question for
Crist. "at what point did they be<nine
trespassers?"
Crist then claimed that "except for
possibly one or two," none of the resi
dents on The Land even had permis

businessman Donald Eldridge, who is
disputing ownership of the land with
Burns. Residents in the audience ex
