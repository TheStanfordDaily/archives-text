## Viewpoint No Oliphant? 
### 
Starting today, the Daily's opinions page will feature the
editorial cartoons of Paul Conrad, replacing Pat Oliphant.
This was not done by choice.
The San Francisco Chronicle, we have been told, has held
exclusive Bay Area rights to Oliphant since 1971. Thus, accord
ing to the syndicate which distributes Oliphant, theDaiJy can no
longer use those cartoons.
We are using Conrad on an interim basis, and we would
appreciate community input on this change.
For those who have repeatedly asked us why we do not pub
lish Doonesbury and Peanuts, the answer is the same. The
Chronicle has consistently and adamantly refused to let us run
either of those comic strips. Now they are doing the same with
Olpihant.
We find this unfortunate, especially in light ot the cooperation
we receive from other area newspapers. Just recently, the San
Francisco Examiner allowed us to publish Andy Capp, waiving
their exclusive rights. We have valued whatever help, coopera
tion and friendship we receive from other papers, and make
every effort to reciprocate.
The Chron is a different story. But then, isn't it always?
