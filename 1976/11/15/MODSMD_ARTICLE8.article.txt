Under the contract signed by United
Stanford Employees and Stanford
University, the union gave up the
modified union shop provided in its
previous contract by including a sepa
rate memorandum establishing an
agency shop. In doing so, the union
weakened its bargaining power and
â– 4>,ave the university a major victory.
The new agreement allows every
worker to decide for him/herself
whether to join the union. It requires
only that all workers in the bargaining
unit pay the union an agency fee for
benefits accrued from the contract.
All employers willingly grant sub
stantial wage increases and other ben
efits to avoid signing a union shop
agreement. We sold ourselves short by
accepting an agency shop without re
ceiving major concessions from the
university in exchange.
Because of the large turnover of
workers here, the modified union se
curity shop we formerly had would
have, over the years, resulted in a
complete union shop. As the agree
ment apparently stands, the large turn
over now works against our organiza
tion and may result in dissolution of
our union over the years. This is det
rimental to the interests of the major
ity of workers in and out of the bargain
ing unit by weakening our bargaining
power.
Throughout history, labor's only
economic power to improve its work
ing conditions stemmed from its col
lective ability to withhold its labor
using a strike only as a last resort
against the overwhelming economic
power of the employer. Many union
members voted against a strike for fear
that non-union workers within the
bargaining unit would be able to go to
work without being penalized while
workers on the picket line would be

giving up their wages in the interests
of all workers.
Non-union workers do not under
stand that they are riding on the backs
of their fellow workers in the union.
Inasmuch as an agency shop may in
crease the number of non-union work
ers, the collective action of the union
in protecting the interests of all work
ers is handicapped and may be ren
dered ineffective.
Was a strike necessary to retain a
modified union shop? Not necessarily
so. Four hundred workers showed
their anger and their frustration with
the progress of negotiations when they
spontaneously organized local dem
onstrations on the jobs in various
parts of the campus. As a result, con
cessions were wrested from the uni
versity without a strike.
In the 1973 negotiations, representa
tives from our International .Service
Employes' International Union and
the Central Labor Council helped us
with their advice, experience and sup
port. With the power of the AFL-CIO
behind us, we made substantial
economic gains and won the security
of a modified union shop agreement.
Had we brought in these representa
tives, we may have avoided the decer
tification move which forced us to sign
an unsatisfactory contract under
duress.
We can, however, overcome the
limitations forced on us by the agency
shop. While taking precautions
against increasing the resistance of
workers by antagonistic tactics, we
can. with persuasive constant pres
sure. induce them to do their fair share
in promoting the interest of all workers
in the community by becoming full
voting members of the union.
