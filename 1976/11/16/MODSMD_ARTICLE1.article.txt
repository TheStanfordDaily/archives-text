# Devlin calls for British withdrawal
## 
### Mark Funk 
Arguing that peace cannot come to
Northern Ireland until British soldiers
are withdrawn, one of the most con
troversial figures to gain prominence
in the strife-torn province during the
l!)60s called for consolidation of
Catholic and Protestant working class
interests in Ulster.
Bernadette Devlin, a former leader
in the Catholic civil rights movement
in Ulster and a member of Parliament
at age 21, spoke to an overflow crowd
in Tresidder Large Lounge last night.
Claiming that the only group capa
ble of ending sectarian violence in Uls
ter were workers, Devlin, a socialist,
said, "The problem is British domina
tion of Ireland. You can't fight a war
(against terrorism) on behalf of the
working class. The working class must
fight that itself."
Women in peace ranks
Devlin predicted that "ultimately,"
the working class in the province
would wield enough power to force
the British out of the north.
The latest peace movement in
Northern Ireland — the so-called
"women's peace movement" which
started during the summer — was
criticized by Devlin. Comparing it to
peace movements in America during
the Vietnam war, she said there was a
"basic, fundamental difference bet
ween the two."
"The women's peace movement is
based in thecountry of theoppressed,"
Devlin said, pointing out that this was
not the case in Vietnam. America was
the "aggressor" during the Vietnam
war and its peace movement origi
nated from a different perspective, she
said.
"This (women's) movement is peace
.it the price of subsurvience," Devlin
continued. She stated that the peace
the women's movement aspired to
could only be regarded as tacit accep
tance of the status quo by established
interests in Ulster.
Real political change and removal of
religious barriers would be slowed,
she said.
Class clash
Devlin also lashed out at political
developments in the Republic of Ire
land. Stating that the country had al
ready spawned its own "Irish upper
class" bent on exploiting "native Irish
capital interests." she decried the
"emergency" suspension of civil liber
ties to combat elements of the provi
sional Irish Republican Army in the
south.
During most of her talk, Devlin gave
>i historical perspective on the Irish
situation starting with the plantation
of Protestants in the north during the
17th century regime of Oliver Crom
well.
The original civil rights movement
in the North, according to Devlin, was
influenced by America. "We began to
hear Malcolm X and Martin Luther
King," she said. "We heard black
people in America speaking up for the
same things we wanted."

During most of her talk, Devlin gave

situation starting with the plantation
of Protestants in the north during the
17th century regime of Oliver Crom
well.
The original civil rights movement
in the North, according to Devlin, was
influenced by America. "We began to
hear Malcolm X and Martin Luther
King," she said. "We heard black
people in America speaking up for the
same things we wanted."

Bernadette Devlin, a former leader in the Catholic civil rights movement in
Northern Ireland and a member of Parliament at age 21, spoke at Tresid
der Large Lounge last night. She said that the first steps toward peace in
Ulster could only be taken when British troops are withdrawn from the
province.
Arguing that peace cannot come to
Northern Ireland until British soldiers
are withdrawn, one of the most con
troversial figures to gain prominence
in the strife-torn province during the
l!)60s called for consolidation of
Catholic and Protestant working class
interests in Ulster.
Bernadette Devlin, a former leader
in the Catholic civil rights movement
in Ulster and a member of Parliament
at age 21, spoke to an overflow crowd
in Tresidder Large Lounge last night.
Claiming that the only group capa
ble of ending sectarian violence in Uls
ter were workers, Devlin, a socialist,
said, "The problem is British domina
tion of Ireland. You can't fight a war
(against terrorism) on behalf of the
working class. The working class must
fight that itself."
Women in peace ranks
Devlin predicted that "ultimately,"
the working class in the province
would wield enough power to force
the British out of the north.
The latest peace movement in
Northern Ireland — the so-called
"women's peace movement" which
started during the summer — was
criticized by Devlin. Comparing it to
peace movements in America during
the Vietnam war, she said there was a
"basic, fundamental difference bet
ween the two."
"The women's peace movement is
based in thecountry of theoppressed,"
Devlin said, pointing out that this was
not the case in Vietnam. America was
the "aggressor" during the Vietnam
war and its peace movement origi
nated from a different perspective, she
said.
"This (women's) movement is peace
.it the price of subsurvience," Devlin
continued. She stated that the peace
the women's movement aspired to
could only be regarded as tacit accep
tance of the status quo by established
interests in Ulster.
Real political change and removal of
religious barriers would be slowed,
she said.
Class clash
Devlin also lashed out at political
developments in the Republic of Ire
land. Stating that the country had al
ready spawned its own "Irish upper
class" bent on exploiting "native Irish
capital interests." she decried the
"emergency" suspension of civil liber
ties to combat elements of the provi
sional Irish Republican Army in the
south.
