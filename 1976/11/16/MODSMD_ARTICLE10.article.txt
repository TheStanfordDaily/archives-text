# Letter: Andy Capp furthers stereotype
## 
### 
'Junk'
In the Nov. 9 Daily, the Andy Capp
comic strip showed Andy asking a
friend to save the evening for a dart
game, whereupon a woman in a bridal
gown appears and tells Andy that the
man has other obligations on this, his
wedding night.
In the next frame, the man. being
dragged off by the woman apologizes to
Andy: "But you know what brides are
like, eh?". This leaves Andy to say, "I
know what they're like, alright! Once
they've landed the poor fish they im
mediately proceed to take the
backbone out of 'im!"
In the Nov. 10Daily. Andy tantalizes
his wife Flo with a hint of more house
keeping money (she keeps their
hours), followed by a sarcastic and
negative rebuke as he walks away.
The usual content of the strip in
volves Andy in a pub eyeing short
skirted voung women. Flo is generally

seen leaving him in disgust., but al
ways returning out of compassion for
her alcoholic! husband's helplessness
at feeding and caring for himself.
As the undersigned have two ques
tions for Daily decision-makers:
1. If this paper is meant to serve an
institution of "higher learning," why
do you choose a comi6 strip that prop
ogates out-of-date, offensively anti
women stereotypes?
2. In the admirable search for humor
in the Daily, why choose a strip that
not only insults many readers, hut re
volves around the pathetically un
funny relationship of a drunken
philanderer and his abused wife?
Perhaps the joke is that the Daily
should print this junk at all!
