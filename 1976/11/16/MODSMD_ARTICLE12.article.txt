# Is the 'Daily' worth your dollar?
## 
### 
As one who's paying a dollar to the
Daily this quarter, I think I'm entitled
to a few comments on where the paper
is going. These words would best be
suited for a campus press review, but
no such forum exists.
I've noticed a dearth of letters criti
cal of the Daily this year. Unless such
letters are being received but are not
appearing, this lack indicates that the
paper is making fewer mistakes and
offending fewer people. The former is
good news, the latter bad. A news
paper that is not making enemies is not
doing its job.
Any investigation must focus im
meditely on news coverage, the heart
of any paper. As most aware jour
nalists now realize, "news" includes
sports and many types of feature

stories which in other times were not
so impactive on everyday life.
Three ways
Readers should be alerted as to just
how news stories come to appear in the

Daily. Essentially, there are three
ways.
The first is the media event: a public
meeting, speech or game which a re
porter observes and then transcribes.

The second is the press release,
which comes in many forms. There is
wire copy, which is printed verbatim;
the University News Service, whose
stories are essentially rewritten (com
pare Campus Heport and you'll see);
and the "interested party" release, in
which contestants in a dispute seek to
direct media coverage. (The string of
stories in the Duncan Foley tenure case
can be traced to this type of coverage).
Finally, there is reported-generated
copy. These stories, which owe to a
writer's initiative in following up his I
her suspicions and creativity, are the
mark of a fine newspaper.
A look at the Dailies of this quarter
shows the paper rather deficient in this
regard.
Overabundance
What stands out most is the over
abundance of political news. Most of it
is national wire stories, but the Daily
has employed its own writers to churn
out a good portion of the analyses on
everything from the presidential de
bates to congressional "hit lists."
Maybe we should thank the Daily for
making it unnecessary that we read
more perceptive stories on these same
topics in our copies of Time, News
iveek, U.S. News, N.Y. Times, Wall
Street Journul, Chronicle, Examiner,
et. al. But we read some of those publi
cations anyway, and we look to the
Daily for something they can't give us;
local coverage.
The Daily did devote much space to
the local congressional race, but
stories consisted of transcriptions of
debates, an inexplicable fascination
with a quixotic third party candidate
and a sympathetic biography of David
Harris.
Missing stories
Nowhere were there stories on who
was bankrolling whom, on how the
necessities of politics forced Stanford
leftists into an unholy alliance with
the Democratic party organization, or
on why Harris lost so badly.
It must be pointed out that sinister
omission is not to blame for the lack of
investigative reporting. Rather, it is
that good reporting is the toughest re
porting â€” sources are reticent if not
unfriendly, much time is wasted on
false leads, and mistakes in stories are
always noticed and rarely forgiven.
Nowhere does this problem man
ifest itself more than in the hegemony

the Athletic Department exercises over
the sports staff. The reason we never
see a story challenging Fortress Galvez
is because the people who write about
the games we play do so because they
love sports; their only reward is the
exposure to the sports world they get
courtesy of the Athletic Department.
Top-heavy
Thus it's no surprise that meagerly
rewarded Daily reporters shy away
from investigative projects. But of no
help is the fact the Daily continues to
maintain a top-heavy editorial hierar
chy which drains much of its best per
sonnel from the reporting ranks.
Nevertheless, we've seen some ex
cellent work in the Daily this quarter.
Martin Kernberg's full-page study of
student attitudes was perhaps the best
thing I've read in the paper in four
years. Lonnie Rosenwald's stories
have been the focal point of improved
coverage of surrounding areas (cover
age which has been pushed to an ex
treme in the ridiculous series on the
troubles of some obscure commune).
And Elizabeth Pollock has followed
the professional school admissions
problem with diligence.
But the Daily is suffering in features.
Except in sports (where we see a heal
thy number of well-packaged, though
unfortunately traditional, personality
profiles) Daily features have consisted
of little more than the annual profiles
of Leah Kaplan and the student assis
tants to the ombudsman.
The most crying need, however, re
mains in investigative reporting. The
Daily might look into why the Univer
sity is spending $100,000 to tell people
to turn off lights, why it is using tuition
money to help finance the biggest
building spree since The Earthquake,
why so many junior professors ignor
ant of the Honor Code, what's the real
story in the Economics Department
squabble, or what's happening in the
university committee system, where
decisions which will shape Stanford's
future are being made.
Perhaps the Daily will assign a few
of its editors to look into the real stories
around them. In the meantime, we can
be thankful for the decreased number
of mushminded staff editorials. That
itself is worth the dollar.
