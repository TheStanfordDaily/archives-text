# First campus event
## Balloonists stage landing 
### 
It was like a scene from
another era. Two giant balloons
drifted into view over the sleep
ing campus and gently settled on
the field between Stern and Wil
bur Halls. Students in those
dorms awoke to find the mul
ticolored fantasy-craft tethered
in the field, with free rides for
all, and an early morning atmos
phere reminiscent of Saturdays
before college had taken its toll.
Almost like another age, another
world.
But according to Art Coleman,
president of the Stanford Hot Ail
Balloon Club (SHABC), the sport
of ballooning is not a bit archaic.
"Ballooning didn't really be
come feasible until the '605," he
said.
According to Coleman, the
real holdup in the development
of sport ballooning was the lack
of a successful technology. But
with the development of nylon,
used in the body or envelope of
the balloon; the refining of prop
ane, used as fuel for the hot air
burners; and a parachute top
held in place by velcro; the sport
has boomed.
In 1960 there were only 20 cer
tified balloonists in the United
States.Txlay thereare over 1600.
The technology of ballooning

is intricate indeed. The balloons
have a grace and organic purity
which can only be found in the
local Serria Designs outlet —
pure wicker used in the basket or
gondola, virgin stretches of
coated ripstop nylon in the en
velope and plenty of rope — al
ways an aesthetic pleasure for
the outdoor person.
But back to the details of
Saturday's landing. The event
was sponsored by SHABC in
conjunction with two local bal
loonists, Deke Sonnichson and
Mick Viae. The event was or
ganized by Coleman in order to
publicize the Stanford club,
which is trying to get funds from
the university "by any means
available," Coleman said.
The idea, according to Col
eman, is that the university
would help fund the purchase of
at least one balloon — to the tune
of about $8000. In return, this
balloon would be designed with
Stanford in mind — red and
white — and could be flown in
during athletic events and
around campus at various times.
The club would get the useof the
balloon, and would also make
additional purchases as the
campus popularity of the sport
grew. Dues for the club are now
set at $25 per year.

The club would then begin
training students to use the bal
loon, which takes some 24 hours
of instruction. Ballooning is
sanctioned by the Balloon Fed
eration of America, which also
licenses and authorizes instruc
tors.
Until a balloon can be purch
ased, SHABC will use the bal
loons of local owners. The club
will attend a rally in Paso Robles
this weekend. This event, or
ganized by Sonnichson, is billed
as the Great Whammo-Bash.
Sign-up sheets for the trip are
located in the ASSU office, and
ground crew workers are still
needed. No experience needed.

the club, contact Art Coleman at

Watch that flame
Mick Viae, another local ballooning enthusiast also landed his craft, the Rainbow Rider. Viae is
shown here draining his propane tank, backed by an overturned gondola.


Down she goes
Part of Saturday's program included a demonstration of the complete workings of the balloons
— from touch down to takedown. Here Deke Sonnichson's Libra 111 is being deflated.



Landing
Ballooning was the order of the day Saturday at the Wilbur field.

Here the big balloons ride up and down on tether lines, giving
passersby aerial views of the campus.
