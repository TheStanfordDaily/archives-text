# Jobs for women remain scarce
## 
### 
(CPS) â€” The more things change in the women's job market, the
more they stay the same. While an encouraging 37.5 million
women are currently working fulltime, the bad news is that they are
working at low-paying, low-skill jobs.
Though women accounted for the entire 1.7 million-worker in
crease in the U.S. labor force since 1974, a recent U.S. Department
of Labor report noted that underpay and underemployment for
women are as severe as they've ever been. In fact, the average
female college graduate can look forward to earning less than the
average male high-school dropout. In 1975, women on the median
earned $6957 compared to $12,152 for men.
Women on campuses are trying to combat the dismal employ
ment situation through career development organizations. At
Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, the Women's Career De
velopment Center sponsors career counseling, literature and an
internship program in which qualified applicants are given
specific worV projects to complete for some business corporations.
The Center also provides scholarships and loan programs for
women wishing to pursue further education.
The Center at Wright State has much to work with on its own
campus. A class action suit was recently filed against the university
by seven former instructors in the English department charging
discriminatory tenure practices against women. The suit, which
may be the first on this issue, was filed in federal district court and
seeks $4 million in damages. Named as defendants are current and
former members of the university's Board of Trustees and English
department faculty.
Women have been able to infiltrate the ranks of male-dominated
jobs in such areas as law and medicine. Since 1962, the number of
women lawyers has more than tripled to 25,000 and the number of
women doctors has increased two and a half times to 34,000. But in
more traditional fields for women there is a surprising rise in the
number of women working as a clerk or waitress. The Labor De
partment reports that today 60 out of every 100 women workers are
saleswomen, waitresses, hairdressers or clerks while the ratio was
52 of every 100 in 1962.
In Berkeley, the Refuse Collection Department has just hired a
woman as trash collector for the first time, under the Compensatory
Employees Training Act (CETA) in January. Coral Reiff, 25, had to
take the same test as the men. This meant picking up a 100-pound
bag of cement and lifting it to different levels.
