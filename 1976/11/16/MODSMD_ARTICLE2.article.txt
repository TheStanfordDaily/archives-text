# Brezhnev promises Tito...
## Moscow won't interfere 
### 
Belgrade. Yugoslavia (AP) — Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev renewed a
pledge to President Tito yesterday that
Moscow will not interfere in Yugos
lavia's internal affairs, and accused the
West of spreading "fairy tales" to spoil
Yugoslav-Soviet relations.
The promise, made in a toast at a
formal dinner, was one of the conces
sions the 84-year-old Yugoslav leader
had hoped to win in the three-day talks
with Brezhnev.
Referring to the discussion during
the American presidential campaign
of a possible Soviet invasion of Yugos
lavia after Tito dies, and the American
reaction to such an invasion. Brezhnev
said:
"It became recently fashionable in
the West to cast shadows on our mutu
ally good relations and to spread about
it most absurd fabrications.
"Authors of such fairy tales try to
present Yugoslavia as a helpless Little
Red Riding Hood which the terrible
and blood-thirsty wolf — the aggres
sive Soviet Union — is preparing to
dismember and devour." Brezhnev
said.
"The Soviet Union firmly abides by
endeavors to strengthen and develop
with Yugoslavia friendly relations
based on complete equality, mutual
respect and trust and absolute non
interference in interior affairs." he
said.
Karlier, Tito greeted Brezhnev with
bear hugs and kisses, then presented
him with a high Yugoslav decoration
for "services in the struggle against
our common enemy, fascism" in
World War 11.
The pledge of noninterference by
Brezhnev reaffirms a promise made in

1955 to reassure Yugoslavs. Many of
them fear the Soviets will try to domi
nate the country after Tito dies. The
popular World War II hero has man
aged to keep his country independent
of the Soviets for 30 years, but those
who follow him may not be as strong.
Belgrade officials never say publicly
they believe the Soviets might send
tanks into Yugoslavia, as they did in
Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Hungary
in 1956.
Most analysts agree that is not likely
here. They point to the accomplish

ments of the Belgrade government,
which has raised the standard of living
and kept shops full of consumer items,
and the highly trained Yugoslav
armed forces, equipped with some
American weapons.
But the Yugoslavs are nervous about
the vast Soviet military installations
and troop concentrations just across
the Hungarian border to the east. And
travelers who cross the border tell of
"the large roads that seem to have no
use and lead toward Yugoslavia, end
ing abruptly near the border."

Belgrade. Yugoslavia (AP) — Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev renewed a
pledge to President Tito yesterday that
Moscow will not interfere in Yugos
lavia's internal affairs, and accused the
West of spreading "fairy tales" to spoil
Yugoslav-Soviet relations.
The promise, made in a toast at a
formal dinner, was one of the conces
sions the 84-year-old Yugoslav leader
had hoped to win in the three-day talks
with Brezhnev.
Referring to the discussion during
the American presidential campaign
of a possible Soviet invasion of Yugos
lavia after Tito dies, and the American
reaction to such an invasion. Brezhnev
said:
"It became recently fashionable in
the West to cast shadows on our mutu
ally good relations and to spread about
it most absurd fabrications.
"Authors of such fairy tales try to
present Yugoslavia as a helpless Little
Red Riding Hood which the terrible
and blood-thirsty wolf — the aggres
sive Soviet Union — is preparing to
dismember and devour." Brezhnev
said.
"The Soviet Union firmly abides by
endeavors to strengthen and develop
with Yugoslavia friendly relations
based on complete equality, mutual
respect and trust and absolute non
interference in interior affairs." he
said.
Karlier, Tito greeted Brezhnev with
bear hugs and kisses, then presented
him with a high Yugoslav decoration
for "services in the struggle against
our common enemy, fascism" in
World War 11.
The pledge of noninterference by
Brezhnev reaffirms a promise made in

1955 to reassure Yugoslavs. Many of
them fear the Soviets will try to domi
nate the country after Tito dies. The
popular World War II hero has man
aged to keep his country independent
of the Soviets for 30 years, but those
who follow him may not be as strong.
