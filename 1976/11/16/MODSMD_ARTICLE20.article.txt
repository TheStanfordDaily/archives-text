# Marlboro ensemble performs classics
## 
### Cecily Deegan 
Six outstanding soloists from
the Marlboro Music Festival
played together in a chamber en
semble last Tuesday as a part of
The Lively Arts at Stanford
series. Represented were works
of Boccherini, Mozart, and
Brahms, which were arranged
for violins, violas and cellos.
The artists belong to a larger
group of musicians who con
vene in Vermont each summer to
perform, converse and relax in
the Green Mountains. Pianist
Rudolph Serkin is the general ar
tistic director for the Marlboro
Festival which he has been guid
ing since 1950.
Pina Carmirelli, a dextrous
and bold violinist, seemed on
the leading edge of the group,
encouraging the tempo, em
phasizing the tone. Her concise
bowing in the first piece, the
String Quartet in C Major, Op.
25, by Boccherini, established
the predominant phrase which
her partners echoed in altered
form.
Driving sound
While her sound was driving,
it avoided brashness. Cellists
Jerry Grossman and Marcy
Rosen weighted her notes with a
sonorous base line. This
technique was effective espe
cially in the Lurghetto move
ment. The Minuetto-Allegro was
enlivened by crescendos and
codas. Passages tumbled grace
fully one over another, conclud
ing this short, charming com
position.

Mozart, however, was posi
tively elusive. The String Quar
tet in E Flut Major was architec
turally defined by layers of intri
cate passages, but lacked intense
foci. Naoko Tanaka's slender
fingers held innumerable stac
cato notes on the violin, and
Fhilipp Naegele's cello work
was expansive, but the group
never seemed to clinch the
piece.
But moments like Doris Le
derer's passage at the end of the
Andante were exquisite. Here
the viola has the distinctiveness
of a tom-tom and the texture of
an alto saxophone.
Finest talent
In the final selection, Brahms'
String Sextet in G Major, Op. 36,
the group displayed their finest
talent. During the lengthy open
ing movement, Pina Carmirelli
held one note while both pairs of
cellos and violas built harmoni
ously around it. This fusing of
new sounds created initial ten
sions which were eventually re
solved into a molded unity.
The Scherzo was animated
and open, allowing the musi
cians to travel diverging paths.
In contrast, the final move
ment was dense. Its thematic
four note phrase spread across a
surface of modulated notes. The
cello and viola parts prepared for
the imposing violin, breaking in
its path. Ms. Carmirelli re
sponded, and her infectious de
cisiveness unified the ensemble,
which closed triumphantly.
