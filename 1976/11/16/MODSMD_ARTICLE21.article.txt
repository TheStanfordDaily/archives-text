# 'Angle of Repose' premieres in City
## 
### Nan Thompson 
The Nov. 6 world premiere
performance of Angle of Repose
at the War Memorial Opera
House in San Francisco was an
intriguing musical blend of past
and present. Commissioned for
the American Bicentennial by
the San Francisco Opera Com
pany, composer Andrew Imbrie
and librettist Oakley Hall took,
on the problem of telling Wal
lace Stegner's complex Pulitzer
prize winning novel with a
modern interpretation, using the
romantic medium of opera.
The curtain rises on Lyman
Ward, a crippled historian who
sits in front of an imposing por
trait of his grandmother Susan
Ward. He is in the midst of a gar
den of roses which she once
planted.
Chester Ludgin, who com
mands the role of Lyman Ward
well, is surprised by the arrival
of his daughter. Shelly, a college
student who is bitter about the
lover she has just left. Her father
begins to tell Shelly the story of
his grandmother, a young
Ouaker girl from the East who
married an engineer and fol
lowed him West.
Drunken and Filthy
As the action moves upstage,
che audience sees her arrival in
New Almaden, California. Susan
Ward, sung beautifully by Nancy
Shade, is greeted by the miners
employed by her husband. She is
offended by their drunken and
filthy revelry.
The miner's choral interludes
were the musical highlights of
the opera. They sing "My
Sweatheart is a Burro named
Lou" to Imbrie's version of a toe
tapping miner's jig.
William Lewis delivered the
evening's finest vocal perfor
mance as Frank Sargent, Oliver
Ward's mine manager. He is in
troduced to Susan Ward, who
then persuades him to allow her
to enter the mine. A miner is kil
led in an accident and his co
workers sing a magnificent

modern rendition of a Cornish
folksong. Susan convinces
Frank and her husband. Oliver,
to resign from the brutal mining
business and the three of them
journey to San Francisco.
Nob Hill ballroom
Andrew Imbrie musically
changes direction again when
the curtain rises on a Nob Hill
ballroom. Dancers waltz to a dis
tinctly Vienesse melody. A poet
who is at the party warns Susan,
who is ecstatic to ije back
amongst the cultured, that her
husband is a man of the frontier.
He predicts that she will have to
follow him to the wilderness
again soon.
At the end of the first act, the
only thing the audience could
agree on was the aesthetic value
of the rose lace curtain. The idea
of using musical variations to
portray the shifts in time is com
mendable, but Imbrie's transi
tions were often so harsh that
some left the Opera House after
the first act complaining of
headaches.
The second act opens with
Shelly bitterly indicting all un
faithful lovers and husbands.
The part was well sung, but
overacted by Susanne Marsee.
Shelly turns to her father, who
continues with his story about
Susan Ward, now living with her
husband in Leadville, Colorado.
The coarseness of the Western
life is driving Susan close to
Frank Sargent. He is an Eastern
man, and thus sympathetic to
her desires for a life of comfort
and culture.
Lynching party
Frank becomes involved in a
lynching party seeking revenge
on a claim jumper. Oliver
chooses to continue their friend
ship despite his disapproval of
the Western system of justice.
Oliver is offered the job of his
dreams, with the U.S. Geological
Survey, but he turns down the
opportunity so that he and Susan
can remain together. They move
to Idaho where he begins the

construction of the Susan Canal.
The scene shifts again to the
present and Shelly guesses that
her grandmother will be unfaith
ful. She realizes that Susan
could never overcome her revul
sion of the untamed West and
would never adapt herself to its
lifestyle.
Many years later
In the third act, we see Oliver
and Susan many years later after
the birth of two children. As the
Susan Canal is about to open,
Susan is off talking to Frank,
who has just returned from San
Francisco. He begs her to return
there with him. As they embrace,
Susan's daughtt r falls into the
river and drowns. Frank feels re
sponsible for the tragic incident
and commits suicide.
In the most dramatic scene of

the opera, Oliver realizes what
has happened and begins a 5U
year vigil of unforgiving silence.
The unnerving tones of the
music reflect composer Imbrie's
feelings about Susan and
Oliver's relationship and the
possibility of Lyman Ward and
his wife settling into the same
pattern. It is from these relation
ships of tortured co-existence
that the name of the opera is de
rived. Angel of Repose is a
geologic term which describes
the position in which a falling
object comes to rest.
Echoes
In the final scene, the action in
the present echoes the past when
Lyman's wife comes to visit him
and begs to be forgiven for walk
ing out on him during his ill
ness. Daughter Shelly pleads

with her father to learn from her
grandmother's mistakes. The
opera ends with Lyman Ward's
reconciliation with his wife,
signifying hope for the future by
attending to the lessons of the
past, a fitting theme for a Bicen
tennial opera.
Angle of Repose, with two per
formances remaining on Nov. 18
and 26, is well worth seeing. The
overall excellent quality of the
performance was enhanced by
Gerald Freedman's creative
stage design. The all-California
team of Andrew Imbrie from
UC-Berkeley, Oakley Hall from
UC-Irvine and Wallace Stegner
from Stanford coordinated their
efforts to propose an entertain
ing solution to the problem of
modern opera.

some left the Opera House after
the first act complaining of
headaches.
The second act opens with
Shelly bitterly indicting all un
faithful lovers and husbands.
The part was well sung, but
overacted by Susanne Marsee.
Shelly turns to her father, who
continues with his story about
Susan Ward, now living with her
husband in Leadville, Colorado.
The coarseness of the Western
life is driving Susan close to
Frank Sargent. He is an Eastern
man, and thus sympathetic to
her desires for a life of comfort
and culture.
Lynching party
Frank becomes involved in a
lynching party seeking revenge
on a claim jumper. Oliver
chooses to continue their friend
ship despite his disapproval of
the Western system of justice.
Oliver is offered the job of his
dreams, with the U.S. Geological
Survey, but he turns down the
opportunity so that he and Susan
can remain together. They move
to Idaho where he begins the

construction of the Susan Canal.
The scene shifts again to the
present and Shelly guesses that
her grandmother will be unfaith
ful. She realizes that Susan
could never overcome her revul
sion of the untamed West and
would never adapt herself to its
lifestyle.
Many years later
In the third act, we see Oliver
and Susan many years later after
the birth of two children. As the
Susan Canal is about to open,
Susan is off talking to Frank,
who has just returned from San
Francisco. He begs her to return
there with him. As they embrace,
Susan's daughtt r falls into the
river and drowns. Frank feels re
sponsible for the tragic incident
and commits suicide.
In the most dramatic scene of

the opera, Oliver realizes what
has happened and begins a 5U
year vigil of unforgiving silence.
The unnerving tones of the
music reflect composer Imbrie's
feelings about Susan and
Oliver's relationship and the
possibility of Lyman Ward and
his wife settling into the same
pattern. It is from these relation
ships of tortured co-existence
that the name of the opera is de
rived. Angel of Repose is a
geologic term which describes
the position in which a falling
object comes to rest.
Echoes
In the final scene, the action in
the present echoes the past when
Lyman's wife comes to visit him
and begs to be forgiven for walk
ing out on him during his ill
ness. Daughter Shelly pleads

with her father to learn from her
grandmother's mistakes. The
opera ends with Lyman Ward's
reconciliation with his wife,
signifying hope for the future by
attending to the lessons of the
past, a fitting theme for a Bicen
tennial opera.
Angle of Repose, with two per
formances remaining on Nov. 18
and 26, is well worth seeing. The
overall excellent quality of the
performance was enhanced by
Gerald Freedman's creative
stage design. The all-California
team of Andrew Imbrie from
UC-Berkeley, Oakley Hall from
UC-Irvine and Wallace Stegner
from Stanford coordinated their
efforts to propose an entertain
ing solution to the problem of
modern opera.
The Nov. 6 world premiere
performance of Angle of Repose
at the War Memorial Opera
House in San Francisco was an
intriguing musical blend of past
and present. Commissioned for
the American Bicentennial by
the San Francisco Opera Com
pany, composer Andrew Imbrie
and librettist Oakley Hall took,
on the problem of telling Wal
lace Stegner's complex Pulitzer
prize winning novel with a
modern interpretation, using the
romantic medium of opera.
The curtain rises on Lyman
Ward, a crippled historian who
sits in front of an imposing por
trait of his grandmother Susan
Ward. He is in the midst of a gar
den of roses which she once
planted.
Chester Ludgin, who com
mands the role of Lyman Ward
well, is surprised by the arrival
of his daughter. Shelly, a college
student who is bitter about the
lover she has just left. Her father
begins to tell Shelly the story of
his grandmother, a young
Ouaker girl from the East who
married an engineer and fol
lowed him West.
Drunken and Filthy
As the action moves upstage,
che audience sees her arrival in
New Almaden, California. Susan
Ward, sung beautifully by Nancy
Shade, is greeted by the miners
employed by her husband. She is
offended by their drunken and
filthy revelry.
The miner's choral interludes
were the musical highlights of
the opera. They sing "My
Sweatheart is a Burro named
Lou" to Imbrie's version of a toe
tapping miner's jig.
William Lewis delivered the
evening's finest vocal perfor
mance as Frank Sargent, Oliver
Ward's mine manager. He is in
troduced to Susan Ward, who
then persuades him to allow her
to enter the mine. A miner is kil
led in an accident and his co
workers sing a magnificent

modern rendition of a Cornish
folksong. Susan convinces
Frank and her husband. Oliver,
to resign from the brutal mining
business and the three of them
journey to San Francisco.
Nob Hill ballroom
Andrew Imbrie musically
changes direction again when
the curtain rises on a Nob Hill
ballroom. Dancers waltz to a dis
tinctly Vienesse melody. A poet
who is at the party warns Susan,
who is ecstatic to ije back
amongst the cultured, that her
husband is a man of the frontier.
He predicts that she will have to
follow him to the wilderness
again soon.
At the end of the first act, the
only thing the audience could
agree on was the aesthetic value
of the rose lace curtain. The idea
of using musical variations to
portray the shifts in time is com
mendable, but Imbrie's transi
tions were often so harsh that
some left the Opera House after
the first act complaining of
headaches.
The second act opens with
Shelly bitterly indicting all un

Angle of Repose, with two per
formances remaining on Nov. 18
and 26, is well worth seeing. The
overall excellent quality of the
performance was enhanced by
Gerald Freedman's creative
stage design. The all-California
team of Andrew Imbrie from
UC-Berkeley, Oakley Hall from
UC-Irvine and Wallace Stegner
from Stanford coordinated their
efforts to propose an entertain
ing solution to the problem of
modern opera.
The Nov. 6 world premiere
performance of Angle of Repose
at the War Memorial Opera
House in San Francisco was an
intriguing musical blend of past
and present. Commissioned for
the American Bicentennial by
the San Francisco Opera Com
pany, composer Andrew Imbrie
and librettist Oakley Hall took,
on the problem of telling Wal
lace Stegner's complex Pulitzer
prize winning novel with a
modern interpretation, using the
romantic medium of opera.
The curtain rises on Lyman
Ward, a crippled historian who
sits in front of an imposing por
trait of his grandmother Susan
Ward. He is in the midst of a gar
den of roses which she once
planted.
Chester Ludgin, who com
mands the role of Lyman Ward
well, is surprised by the arrival
of his daughter. Shelly, a college
student who is bitter about the
lover she has just left. Her father
begins to tell Shelly the story of
his grandmother, a young
Ouaker girl from the East who
married an engineer and fol
lowed him West.
Drunken and Filthy
As the action moves upstage,
che audience sees her arrival in
New Almaden, California. Susan
Ward, sung beautifully by Nancy
Shade, is greeted by the miners
employed by her husband. She is
offended by their drunken and
filthy revelry.
The miner's choral interludes
were the musical highlights of
the opera. They sing "My
Sweatheart is a Burro named
Lou" to Imbrie's version of a toe
tapping miner's jig.
William Lewis delivered the
evening's finest vocal perfor
mance as Frank Sargent, Oliver
Ward's mine manager. He is in
troduced to Susan Ward, who
then persuades him to allow her
to enter the mine. A miner is kil
led in an accident and his co
workers sing a magnificent

modern rendition of a Cornish
folksong. Susan convinces
Frank and her husband. Oliver,
to resign from the brutal mining
business and the three of them
journey to San Francisco.
Nob Hill ballroom
Andrew Imbrie musically
changes direction again when
the curtain rises on a Nob Hill
ballroom. Dancers waltz to a dis
tinctly Vienesse melody. A poet
who is at the party warns Susan,
who is ecstatic to ije back
amongst the cultured, that her
husband is a man of the frontier.
He predicts that she will have to
follow him to the wilderness
again soon.
At the end of the first act, the
only thing the audience could
agree on was the aesthetic value
of the rose lace curtain. The idea
of using musical variations to
portray the shifts in time is com
mendable, but Imbrie's transi
tions were often so harsh that
some left the Opera House after
the first act complaining of
headaches.
The second act opens with
Shelly bitterly indicting all un
faithful lovers and husbands.
The part was well sung, but
overacted by Susanne Marsee.
Shelly turns to her father, who
continues with his story about
Susan Ward, now living with her
husband in Leadville, Colorado.
The coarseness of the Western
life is driving Susan close to
Frank Sargent. He is an Eastern
man, and thus sympathetic to
her desires for a life of comfort
and culture.
Lynching party
Frank becomes involved in a
lynching party seeking revenge
on a claim jumper. Oliver
chooses to continue their friend
ship despite his disapproval of
the Western system of justice.
Oliver is offered the job of his
dreams, with the U.S. Geological
Survey, but he turns down the
opportunity so that he and Susan
can remain together. They move
to Idaho where he begins the

construction of the Susan Canal.
The scene shifts again to the
present and Shelly guesses that
her grandmother will be unfaith
ful. She realizes that Susan
could never overcome her revul
sion of the untamed West and
would never adapt herself to its
lifestyle.
Many years later
In the third act, we see Oliver
and Susan many years later after
the birth of two children. As the
Susan Canal is about to open,
Susan is off talking to Frank,
who has just returned from San
Francisco. He begs her to return
there with him. As they embrace,
Susan's daughtt r falls into the
river and drowns. Frank feels re
sponsible for the tragic incident
and commits suicide.
In the most dramatic scene of

the opera, Oliver realizes what
has happened and begins a 5U
year vigil of unforgiving silence.
The unnerving tones of the
music reflect composer Imbrie's
feelings about Susan and
Oliver's relationship and the
possibility of Lyman Ward and
his wife settling into the same
pattern. It is from these relation
ships of tortured co-existence
that the name of the opera is de
rived. Angel of Repose is a
geologic term which describes
the position in which a falling
object comes to rest.
Echoes
In the final scene, the action in
the present echoes the past when
Lyman's wife comes to visit him
and begs to be forgiven for walk
ing out on him during his ill
ness. Daughter Shelly pleads

with her father to learn from her
grandmother's mistakes. The
opera ends with Lyman Ward's
reconciliation with his wife,
signifying hope for the future by
attending to the lessons of the
past, a fitting theme for a Bicen
tennial opera.
