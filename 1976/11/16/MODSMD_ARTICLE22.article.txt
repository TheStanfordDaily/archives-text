# A 						new opera that shows its age
## 
### Lois Carroll 
An opera about a woman more than three
hundred years old? Yes, such a creation
does exist — at the San Francisco Opera
House this season. It is Leos Janacek's The
Makropulos Case.
San Francisco's production was very in
teresting, but major flaws did exist. The set
seemed wrong. The stationary columns and
huge female statue were, to say the least,
inappropriate in the first and third acts
where the settings were supposed to be a
lawyer's office and a hotel suite.
Only in the second act were they some
what suited to the setting, this time a stage.
In addition, the set seemed dreary and dark.
Although the second act set, with the added
color of the throne, was a slight improve
ment in this respect, some added visual at
traction was needed even then.
Part of the difficulty in producing The
Mukropuios Case convincingly lies, of
course, in the libretto, adapted from (but
fairly close to) Karel Capek's 1922 play. For
instance, the central character, Emilia
Marty, is supposedly a cool-headed,

worldly woman trying to hide her age. Yet
she is continually given lines like "Nobody
ever told me he died," about someone she
had known a hundred years before.
Cast quality
Cast quality varied in The Mokropulos
Case, but acting was on an all-around high
level. Joshua Hecht as Lawyer Kolenatv and
Raymond Manton as the clerk Vitek had
rather weak voices and were hard to hear
over thp orchestra. William Lewis (Cregor),
Pamela South (Vitek's young, star-struck
daughter), and Ceraint Evans (Jaroslav
Prus), sang and acted quite well. Their ap
pearance and vocal color were suited to
their respective roles.
It was soprano Anja Silja as Marty who
stole the show. She seemed totally relaxed
in her part. At times, she seemed indeed too
relaxed, by overdoing somewhat a sort of
vamp act that went along with her distract
ing (to the point of laughability) costumes.
For the most part, however, her acting was
excellent — quite an unusual accomplish
ment for an opera star.

The only difficulties of her performance
were technical. In Act 11, especially, she had
some troubles: occasional inaccurate into
nation and oily slurs. And throughout the
opera (but especially in Acts II and III), in
marked contrast to her clearly-enunciating
colleagues in the show, she had a severe
diction problem. Although the opera was
performed in English, one would hardly
have guessed it when listening to her. Most
words coming from her mouth were unre
cognizable. Yet all the same, she sang very
well and her stage presence is riveting.
The orchestra, under the direction of
Christoph von Dohnanyi, started out lamely
with overall ragged attacks plus a lot of
cracked notes in the trumpet choir. But it
soon improved to become an effective com
ponent of the whole work. Janacek's score is
often very moving, and the orchestra's ren
dition. once past the beginning, was truly
gorgeous at times.
It is a pity that the opera, warts and all. is
not more widely known. Despite its bizarre
libretto, listening to it is real pleasure.
