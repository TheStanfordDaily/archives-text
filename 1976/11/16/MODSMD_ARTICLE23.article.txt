# Child prodigy or not...
## Pianist has ups, downs 
### Michele Hannoosh 
Had we all not been barraged
beforehand with this absurd
publicity about the "child pro
digy," perhaps I would have an
ticipated less from the piano
concert by Jeffrey Swann given
at kresge Auditorium last Friday
evening. As it turned out, the
performance was a fairly good
one and even had some out
standing moments, but the pur
ported "boy wonder" revealed
some rough spots and weaknes
ses which were disappointing.
The program began with
Beethoven's Sunuta in E major
(Opus 14, no. 1), in which
Swann demonstrated consider
able skill in technique, espe
cially by his unfaltering preci
sion in rendering the many em
bellishments. Certain theme
notes, however, had a rather un
pleasant click to them, which a
lighter but more sure touch

would have remedied.
1 would have preferred that he
be more sensitive in his expres
sion in the second movement, so
as to add color to the almost
banal melody of this portion of
the sonata. Swann improved
markedly with the third move
ment, when he showed that his
real strengths lay in executing
dramatic and technically com
manding music, rather than
playing more expressive pieces.
Novel work
The next selection was
Wuorinen's Second Sonata for
Piano, commissioned by Swann
to be written expressly for him. It
was certainly a novel work,
modernistic, with sound ex
tremes that were sometimes
gawky, sometimes gentle. It was
also unfortunately long, which
caused the less persevering
members of the audience to doze
off.

But Svvann obviously under
stood this piece, and he made the
piano hammers work for him '1
appropriately enough so that in
spite of my usual lack of en- "
thusiasm for this type of music, 1 .'
was persuaded to enjoy it. At any
rate, it was remarkable that such
seemingly discordant sounds
could create such an impression
of delicacy.
M
The second half of the prog
ram was more likable than the
first, although it also started ;»
rather weakly before improving.
Ravel's Guspurd de la nuit, a J
piece in three parts, was the I
opening number, and here again *
Swann proved his mastery of the *
more dramatic sections, regrett-£
ably at the expense of the morel*
emotive ones. In the "Ondine,""-
for example, a few missed notes
here and there created gaps in a •
piece that should have reflected
the fluidity that its name im
plies. Hut the other two parts to
the piece were excellent as
Swann not only played with
clarity but also succeeded in
making the type of fine contrasts
that are so essential to Ravel.
Final two
Swann commendably chose
two works by Liszt as his final •
pieces; Swann handles well
more flamboyant music like that
of Liszt. He had the precision
and the authority necessary for a
good performance of A ux Cypres
de la villa d'Este. However, the
"Mephisto Waltz" (no. 1) was ,
garbled in parts, almost sloppy.
As the piece continued, he did
bring out the melody well and
gave overall what could be cal
led a thrilling rendition, coming
to a crashing finish which liter
ally sprang him from the piano
bench.
The audience was obviously
satisfied, and Swann obliged by
offering as an encore a Chopin
etude (F major, Opus 10, no. 8),
which he performed impres
sively with ease and accuracy.
