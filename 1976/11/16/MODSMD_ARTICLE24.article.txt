# Paul Williams scores hit with 'Bugsy Malone'
## 12-year old thugs take you back... 
### Howard Baldwin 
A dark city street, slick
with rain. A lone figure
eludes his pursuers. The griz
zled narrator informs us of his
predicament—"Someone
once said that if it were rain
ing brains, Roxy Robinson
wouldn't get wet." Roxy tries
to escape down a dark alley A
dead end.
His pursuers corner him.
His time has come. He is un
ceremoniously plastered
with a splurge gun.
And so begins Bugsy
Malone, a film of unequaled
imagination and originality
that exists on three strangely
harmonious levels.
On one level it's a parody of
the late-night gangster movie,
with characters like Fat Sam
ordering one of his flunkies.
"Don't crack your knuckles.
Knuckles," and Knuckles re
plying. "But that's how I got
my name. Boss," to which Fat
Sam replies, "Either stop
cracking your knuckles or get
yourself a new name!"
It's a musical
Secondly, it's a musical.
Fat Sam owns a speakeasy
hidden behind a bookstore,
complete with dancing girls,
ambitious dancing janitors
and the typical assortment of
dancing guys and dolls.
But the big twist—as if a
musical Untouchables we
ren't enough—is that all the
actors are children, their av
erage age being twelve. They
drive foot-pedaled
limousines, and their splurge
guns mercilessly launch cus

tard pies.
The sets are scaled down to
create a fantasy image of a
world we all entered once
upon a time. In sheer terms of
audience identification,
Bugsy Malone is a winner,
representing the very peak of
nostalgia.
Gang war
The story of Bugsy Malone
concerns a gang war between
Fat Sam (John Gassisi) and
Dandy Dan, a well-mannered
hood whose romantic and
courteous ways bring laugh
ter like cars bring pollution.
Dan is impinging on Fat
Sam's territory, rampaging
first through his brewery and
then his grocery, plotting all
the time against the prime
target. Sam's speakeasy.
Between the gang war
eruptions. Bugsy Malone
(Scott Baio) tangles romanti
cally with his jaded ex . Tal
lulah (Jodie Foster), and his
present star-struck girlfriend.
Blousev (Florrie Dugger), both
of whom are singers in Fat
Sam's cabaret.
As the wisecracking Tal
lulah, Jodie Foster steals the
show, and by all rights should
have had Blousey's more im
portant part. The others,
without being coy. present a
sensational image of innocent
corruption. Goaxing realistic
performances out of 200 kids
probably produced intermin
able headaches for writer
director Alan Parker, but the
end product was well worth
it. While each performance is
good, some sparkle like rare

gems.
Bugsy Malone, rated G and
everything, is cute without
being precocious, sweet
without being saccharine,
and happy without being
cloying. It may be that rare
movie from which you exit
smiling.
On the other hand, it has no
Nazi dentists so it'll probably
end up a box-office failure.
I Bugsy Malone is now playing
at the Fine Arts Theatre in
Palo Alto.)
