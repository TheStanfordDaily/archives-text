# He's not exactly normal, but he sure is talented

### Howard Baldwin 
To have lunch with
composer/screen writer/si ng
er/actor Paul Williams, you
need a banquet table, and not
just because of all his occupa
tions. Sit down with Paul
Williams (or "someone who
just thinks he's Paul Wil
liams," as he blithely put it)
and you can alternately find
vourself conversing with a
financially-inclined busi
ness man, a Barbra Streisand
fan, a perverse huckster.

Baretta, or Dr. Strangelove.
Williams was in San Fran
cisco recently, having been
assigned by process of elimi
nation the task of promoting
Bugsy Malone (the director is
in England, and the actors,
averaging age 12, are all too
young for the promo circuit).
Wired and hyper. Wiliams
charmingly explained to re
porters how Bugsy Malone
was created and intermit
tently screamed, "I GAN
WALK, MEIN FIJHRER!" to

the wine steward.
Williams calls Bugsy
Malone a gangster musical set
in 1929 New York Gity, a
"labor of love". The idea orig
inally came from director
Alan Parker telling his kids
bedtime stories about child
gangsters and molls. The
composer/lyricist admitted to
originally hoping that the
film would be as good as his
songs—until he saw the first
rushes and immediately
wondered if his songs would
be as good as the film (they
are). The most rewarding
thing, he says, was scoring
the entire film, rather than
just writing the music and
lyrics.
Perverse
Someone once asked him.
what with all the eleven
year-old dancing girls parad
ing onstage in sequined hot
pants, if Bugsy Malone wasn't
a tremendously perverse
movie, to which Williams re
plied, "Of course. Why the
hell do you think I did the
picture?"
He admitted. "I think
Bugsy is a tremendously ero
tic picture. We're getting a lot
of the raincoat crowd." The
word "perverse" was the one
that most often described the
film in recent conversations.
As if to prove it. Williams
cracked. "We're merchandis
ing everything—you can
even have Dandy Dan (one of
the gangsters) for a night."
He spoke of late-night ses
sions in the scoring chambers
rife with suggestions of "let's

look at that reel a few
hundred more times." But he
quickly quoted Charles
Champlin's review in the Los
Angeles Times —"Anyone
who doesn't see the goodness
in Bugsy Malone must he
looking at the world through
morose-colored glasses,"—
just to prove that the film's
innate purity overcame its
innate sexuality...barely.
Dressed in a three-piece
denim suit, high-top black
sneakers and a Bugsy Malone
button. Williams modestly
shrugged off his success and
smiled. "At least I'm keeping
busy," he said, understating
himself. He neglected to men
tion the difference between
him and other busy people in
Hollywood. He's keeping
busy creatively, producing
material with intelligence
and charm, while so many
others just seem to be spin
ning their wheels.
This is the man to whom
Mel Brooks once said.
"Your're a warped person.
You should be writing
screenplays." This is the man
who. after reading Rex Heed's
review of Phantom Of The
Paradise (in which he acted),
admits to an initial reaction of
wanting to shoot Reed's
kneecaps off. This is the man
who credits Harry Nilsson
and I 'kelele Ike as his biggest
musical influences.
This man is not normal. Hut
he is brilliant. And since bril
liance and being normal are
mutually exclusive, he's not
disadvantaged in the least.
