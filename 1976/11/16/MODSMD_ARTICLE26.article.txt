U.S. vetoes U.N. seat for Vietnam
United Nations, N.Y. — The United States vetoed
Vietnam's application for U.N. membership yes
terday, casting the only negative vote in the Sec
urity Council.
The council voted 14-1 in favor of a resolution
recommending that the Ceneral Assembly admit
Vietnam to the United Nations. But the negative
vote by the United States, one of the council's five
veto-holding permanent members, killed the resol
ution.
U.S. Ambassador William Scranton said he cast
the veto because Vietnam had "failed, despite the
information available to it, to account satisfactor
ily" for some 800 Americans still missing in action
from the Vietnamese war.
Vietnam Ambassador Dinh Ba Thi, addressing
the council after the vote, hinted that a friendlier
U.S. attitude might produce more information on
the missing men.
Thi, Vietnam's U.N. observer, said the U.S. veto
policy "will only serve to continue the days of
waiting of American families whose children have
been listed as missing in action."
Scranton said Vietnam's "failure to provide a
fuller accounting" of the missing in action (MIA)
indicated a lack of humanitarian concern. This, he
said, led the United States to doubt if Vietnam met
the qualifications for membership under the U.N.
charter calling for willingness to carry out charter
obligations.
Thi insisted the MIA issue was "part of the bilat
eral relations between the two countries" and had
nothing to do with the charter.
It was the fifth time in about 14 months that
America vetoed Vietnamese applications for mem
bership. The other four vetoes were cast on two
occasions on separate applications for membership
by North and South Vietnam before they were offi
cially united.
Separtists gain seats in Quebec
Montreal — The Parti Quebecois, which wants
independence for Quebec and its French-speaking
majority, upset the Liberal government of Premier
Robert Bourassa in provincial elections yesterday.
The separtist party had only six seats in the last
legislature, but less than three hours after voting
ended at 7 p.m. EST the Parti Quebecois had won 52
of the 110 seats and was leading for 19 others. It has
promised a referendum to determine if Quebec
should remain part of Canada.
The key decision for voters is whether to go for
five more years with Bourassa, 43 — whose ad
ministration has been plagued by a sagging
economy and charges of corruption — or to risk a
plunge into the unknown with Rene Levesque and
his goal of an independent Quebec.
Levesque, 54, has attacked Bourassa for Quebec's
rampant strikes, high unemployment and inflation.
Levesque's Pequistes have tried to keep the cam
paign focus off separtism, saying they won't split
Quebec from Canada's nine other, predominantly
English-speaking provinces unless they get a man
date from a referendum. Polls show that despite
swelling French Canadian nationalism, only about
20 percent of Quebec residents are hard-core separ
tists.
Syrian troops occupy Beirut
Beirut, Lebanon — Syrian tanks and troops si
lenced the guns of Beirut yesterday in a massive
occupation that handed Lebanon its first real
chance for peace in 19 months of civil war.
Joyful Moslems slaughtered sheep in a tradi
tional Arab gesture of welcome. Women sent up
Arab cries of joy and dowsed Syrian soldiers with
rose water and rice as columns of T62 and T54 tanks
swept over the city from three directions.
"Allah is great," shouted bystanders as the
camouflage painted tanks clanked by. "Arabs will
be victorious."
The welcome was subdued in Christian quarters,

where rightist militiamen ordered civilians to stay
off the streets. Christian leaders seemed to feel more
strongly the sting of Beirut's first foreign occupa
tion since U.S. Marines landed to stop an earlier
war in 1958.
Only a few instances of resistance were reported
as the 6000 troops and 400 tanks took over, all in
Moslem and Palestinian-controlled areas. The Sy
rians fired only a half dozen grenades and a few
rounds of submachine gun fire in a six-hour sweep
that began with the first light of dawn.
By nightfall, they had established control over
Beirut's battle zones, Palestinian refugee camps,
radio stations, government buildings, the airport
and key intersections. The sound of gunfire died
away for the first time since an earlier ceasefire
more than nine months ago.
"That's it. The war is over," exulted a Moslem
Lebanese after driving the length of the front-line
where thousands of his countrymen have been kil
led.
But observers noted that the religious, social and
political divisions that exploded this tiny Arab
country remained unsolved. The Syrian occupa
tion provided only the force to prevent further
fighting, they said, leaving solution of the problems
for the future.
The intervention force, now numbering nearly
30,000, is the striking fist of an Arab League peace
contingent ordered and financed by Arab kings and
presidents in two summit conferences last month.
Committee subpoenas FBI memo
Washington — The House Committee on Assas
sinations will subpoena an FBI memorandum indi
cating Lee Harvey Oswald told Cuban officials he
planned to kill President John Kennedy, chairman
Thomas Downing (D-Va.), said yesterday.
Meanwhile, the 12-member committee made
plans to hire one of the largest congressional staffs
ever, to conduct simultaneous investigations into
the Kennedy assassination and the slaying of Mar
tin Luther King.
Chief counsel Richard Sprague said he would
hire 170 staff members.
Downing said he was aware of the memorandum
only through news reports.
Court to review religion-on-the-job
Washington — How far an employer must bend
to accommodate an employe's religious convic
tions, an issue that caused a Supreme Court dead
lock earlier this month, was granted review once
again yesterday.
The justices also set the stage for a possible ruling
on whether affirmative action programs benefiting
minorities discriminate against whites.
Larry Hardison filed suit in 1969 claiming religi
ous discrimination after he was fired from his job as
a Trans World Airline repairman in Kansas City.
The Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed
with Hardison that TWA was guilty of religious
discrimination, ruling that tlie airline did not make
sufficient attempts to work out the scheduling
problems caused by Hardison's religious beliefs.
TWA appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing
that it had tried to accommodate Hardison short of
infringing on the collective bargaining rights of
other employers.
On Nov. 2, the high court split 4-4 in upholding a
Sixth U.S. Circujt of Appeals ruling that Kentucky
firm was guilty of religious discrimination for fir
ing an employe under similar circumstances. Jus
tice John Paul Stevens did not participate in the
decision.
The Supreme Court deadlock automatically up
held the lower court's decision but left some ques
tion as to exactly what is the "law ot the land."
If Stevens participates in Hardison's case, and the
other justices vote as they did earlier this month, a
new court majority could rule that such accommo
dations are not necessary.
The Justices set aside temporarily an order by the
California Supreme Court striking down an affir

mative action program at the University of Califor
nia at Davis Medical School which gives admission
preference to racial minorities.
The Supreme Court's action holds in abeyance
any enforcement of the state court's order to dis
mantle the program pending formal appeal. The
justices gave the university's regents 30 days to
appeal the state court's decision.
Donald Reidhar, attorney for the university, said
the regents will consider in meetings Thursday and
Friday whether to file a formal appeal with the
Supreme Court.
U.S. defends Israeli education policy
Nairobi, Kenya — The United States attacked as
"conviction without trial" yesterday a proposal
that a U.N. conference condemn Israeli educational
and cultural policies in occupied Arab areas.
The American defense of Israel came only four
days after the United States supported a declaration
of the U.N. Security Council branding as illegal and
"an obstacle to peace" Israeli settlements in the
territories captured in the 1967 war and any action
"which tends to change the status" of Jerusalem.
U.S. delegation sources cautioned that it would
be a "disservice" to interpret the American stand
before the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) as designed to counterba
lance its support of the Security Council declara
tion, which brought angry protests by Israel and
American Jews.
The resolution proposed by 30 Arab and African
states at UNESCO accuses Israel of violating "the
rights of the populations living in all the Arab oc
cupied territories to national educational and cul
tural life, and particularly the systematic Judaiza
tion of educational and cultural life."
Peking hit by another earthquake
Tokyo — A strong earthquake jolted Peking yes
terday, swaying high-rise buildings and reviving
grim memories of the killer quake four months ago,
Japanese reports said.
Foreigners based in the Chinese capital, reached
by telephone from Hong Kong, said there was "no
visible damage" and there were no immediate re
ports of casualties.
Earthquake monitoring stations around the
world said the quake struck at about 9:54 p.m. (8:54
a.m. EST) and measured between 6.5 and 6.8 on the
Richter scale. That would indicate a quake capable
of extensive damage, but considerably weaker than
the massive earthquake in northeast China last July
28.
Foreign monitors said yesterday's tremor was
centered in northern Hopei province, same as the
July quake, indicating that Monday's jolt was prob
ably an aftershock of the July quake.
Officials order halt to hand weeding
San Francisco — State officials have ordered
farmers to halt weed pulling and crop thinning by
hand, saying it is the same kind harmful stoop labor
outlawed last year with short-handled hoes.
A special order was issued against hand weeding
and crop thinning at the Herbert Ranch in Hollister
based on a physician's report that the stoop labor
causes serious back injuries, Deputy Chief Michael
Schneider of the state Division of Industrial Safety
said yesterday.
The order was issued Sept. 16 after Dr. Ira
Monosson went to the tomato farm and observed
employes weeding crops by hand, requiring them
to stoop over almost continuously for 10 hours a
day, Schneider said.
"We contend there are adequate alternatives to
hand weeding and thinning, namely the long
handled hoe," Schneider said.
Today's weather
Low overcast with local fog night and morning
clearing partly afternoons through tomorrow. Little
temperature change. Lows both nights in the mid
40s to mid 50s. Highs tomorrow in the 60s to low
70s.
