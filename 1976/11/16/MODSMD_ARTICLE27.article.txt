# Committee sparks East-West relations
## 
### Elizabeth Pollock Staff writer 
Palo Alto and Tokyo have at least
one thing in commonâ€”they are both
scenes of an annual student exchange
organized, in part, by the Keio Com
mittee here.
The Keio Committee (KC), which
held its second meeting of the year at
Bechtel International Center last night,
was initiated by Stanford students in
1956.
The KC, in coordination with To
kyo's prestigious Keio University, ar
ranges housing and activities for 10
Japanese students who arrive here
each March to live a "Stanford life" for
two months.
The Japanese students are members
of the Institute of International Rela
tions and must take a competitive En
glish examination in order to be
selected as cultural exchange stu
dents. They arrive here in early March
and stay with local families until after
spring break.
The students move into dormitories
on campus in early May. Dorms may
volunteer to take Japanese students.
"The guys tend to be econ majors;

the girls tend to be English majors."
said Carolyn Wasser, KC co
chairwoman.
The biggest problem for KC is trans
porting the Japanese students while
they are living off campus.
"Transportation over there (in Ja
pan) is really efficient, whereas over
here, it's a lot harder for the students to
do things on their own," said Keith
Nakada, who went to Japan last year.
The KC arranges field trips to San
Francisco, Yosemite and Creat
America Amusement Park, in San Jose
and invites the students to various ac
tivities on campus.
A group of 10 American students,
primarily from Stanford, fly to Tokyo
in late June to stay in homes in and
around Tokyo for two months. Candi
dates for this June's group are now
being sought, said Wasser.
Stanford students do not have to
know how to read or speak Japanese to
participate in the Keio exchange. But if
they can do neither, the Japanese stu
dents have to write out all instructions
in English for them, a former particip
ant explained.
Also, Stanford students must pay
round trip air fare, a $50 fee to the KC
"to keep it going in future years" and
about $70 for field trips sponsored by
the KC's Japanese counterpart, said
Wasser.
In exchange, students are given a
host family in or near Tokyo, have an
opportunity to spend some time with a
Japanese farmer and attend Keio Uni
versity.
"It's a good way to see Japan," said
Willy Lew, also a former participant.
All students and staff are welcome to
participate in KC events, Wasser said.
The committee is looking for two
more host families willing to take male
Keio students, she added. Anyone de
siring more information can call her at
328-5825.
