### Lonnie Rosenwald Staff writer 
A public hearing will be held in Palo
Alto tonight to review applications for
Community Development grants
which have been submitted by the
university and nine other community
developers.
The city's Finance and Public Works
Committee will hear public testimony
and review a report from the Palo Alto
city attorneys before allocating the
$558,000 in federal funds which will
be available in 1977-78 through the
Community Development Program.
The university is requesting $40,000
for a program to add access ramps and
curbc.uts at buildings subject to public
use. such as the post office. Bookstore.
Memorial Auditorium and Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. These modifications will
facilitate mobility of elderlv and hand

icapped persons, according to the ap
plication.
Two separate proposals were sub
mitted for use of the funds available to
the university, which is classified by
the Community Development (CD)
Program as "unincorporated land."
The city attorney's report endorses
the first proposal which is to install
curbcuts and ramps on campus. It did
not favor the second — addition of
curbs, gutters and a fence on Peter
Coutts Road in the College Terrace
neighborhood — proposed by the Col
lege Terrace Residents Association.
"It was difficult to justify using CD
funds for this purpose on Peter Coutts
Road, which is in a higher income area
of the campus." the report said.
In order to qualify for CD funds,
community development projects

tion, and community services princi
pally for persons of low or middle in
come.
The proposal, submitted by univer
sity Master Planner Oscar Nelson, lists
two objectives of the plan which
would qualify it as an "eligible activ
ity," as defined by the federal govern
ment.
These objectives, as stated by the
application, are "the installation of
public works such as . . . street im
provements," and removal of "ar
chitectural barriers restricting mobili
zation of the elderly and handicap
ped."
The scope of the university's final
plan would be based on the amount of
funds it receives. No additional uni
versity money will be allocated for the
project, the application stated.
