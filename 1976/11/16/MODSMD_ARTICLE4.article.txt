# Carter foresees possible rebates, more spending, 'open' inauguration
## 
### 
Plains, Ga. (AP) — President-elect
Jimmy Carter said yesterday that tax
rebates and increased government
spending may be needed to spur the
nation's economy, and he discounted
the likelihood of wage and price con
trols.
Carter said at a news conference that
he believes that unemployment can be
reduced to between four and 4.5 per
cent over a long period of time, which
he said would be equivalent to three
per cent of all adults over 20 in the
jobless ranks. He said this would take
two to four years.
Current unemployment has reached
7.9 per cent.
The president-elect also repeated
his belief that inflation can be held
down by applying federal programs to
areas of highest unemployment rather
than through a uniform national prog
ram.
No details
Carter said he cannot at this point be
specific on details of his plans to de
crease unemployment or the possibil
ity that he might call for a general tax
reduction or one-time tax rebate.
But he said that his possibilities for
increasing the money supply include
"tax rebates and spending."
Carter, at his second news confer
ence since his election, announced he
will fly to Washington next week to
meet with Federal Reserve Chairman
Arthur Burns and some of the present
cabinet members, possibly including
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
Carter also announced that Jody

Powell, his press secretary as governor
of Georgia and during his presidential
campaign, will he White House press
secretary.
Deliberate choices
In a three-minute statement preced
ing the question-and-answer period
Carter said his selection of cabinet
members and other top government of
ficials will be slow, careful, cautious
and deliberate and that he personally
will interview top contenders for each
choice.
He said those who are not selected
for cabinet rank may well be in line for
other top government positions in
cluding ambassadorships abroad.
"I have not made a decision up to
this point on any one of the appoint
ments." Carter said.
Congressional meetings
He noted that he plans a meeting
soon with leading members of Con
gress and business and labor leaders in
which he expects to discuss jobs and
taxes among other subjects.
Carter said he sees no incompatibil
ity between goals of lowering un
employment and inflation while "pur
suing aggressively the promises I have
made to the American people."
He mentioned most prominently
welfare and tax reform and the institu
tion of a comprehensive health care
program for all Americans.
Price controls
In response to a question, the
president-elect said that only some
sort of economic disaster would
prompt him to call for wage and price

controls.
"But under normal circumstances —
barringany kind of calamity — I would
think we can avoid mandatory wage
and price controls," he said.
In related transition plans, a
"peoples' inaugural" has been re
vealed for Carter's Jan. 20 oath-taking.
"The greatest concern of the
president-elect is that we reach the
maximum number of people possible
and involve the whole country in the
inauguration," said Bardyl Tirana,
co-chairman of Carter's inaugural

committee. "He wants to receive any
one who comes to Washington for the
inauguration. He wants an open inau
guration."
For the swearing-in ceremony Carter
will don a business suit instead of the
traditional morning coat and top hat
worn by many of his predecessors.
And his wife, Rosalynn, has said that
for the evening activities she'll wear
the same dress she wore for Carter's
installation as governor of Georgia five
years ago.
"We're planning an inauguration
which is traditional but modest in
tone, not extravagant," said Tirana.
Tirana said the morning of the
swearing-in Carter will attend Baptist
church services in Washington then
proceed to the Capitol to take the oath
of office.
"Afterwards there'll be the tradi
tional parade and we hope everyone
will come," Tirana said.
Invitations will soon go out to some
300,000 to 400,000 Carter campaign
workers for what the Carter administ
ration hopes will be a presidential in
augural reminiscent of Andrew
Jackson's celebration 148 years ago.
"The invitations will not entitle the
invitee to any special function any
member of the public couldn't attend,
but they will serve as acknowledge
ment of the role the invitee played in
electing Cov. Carter and Sen. Mon
dale," Tirana said.

ity that he might call for a general tax
reduction or one-time tax rebate.
But he said that his possibilities for
increasing the money supply include
"tax rebates and spending."
Carter, at his second news confer
ence since his election, announced he
will fly to Washington next week to
meet with Federal Reserve Chairman
Arthur Burns and some of the present
cabinet members, possibly including
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
Carter also announced that Jody

Powell, his press secretary as governor
of Georgia and during his presidential
campaign, will he White House press
secretary.
Deliberate choices
In a three-minute statement preced
ing the question-and-answer period
Carter said his selection of cabinet
members and other top government of
ficials will be slow, careful, cautious
and deliberate and that he personally
will interview top contenders for each
choice.
He said those who are not selected
for cabinet rank may well be in line for
other top government positions in
cluding ambassadorships abroad.
"I have not made a decision up to
this point on any one of the appoint
ments." Carter said.
Congressional meetings
He noted that he plans a meeting
soon with leading members of Con
gress and business and labor leaders in
which he expects to discuss jobs and
taxes among other subjects.
Carter said he sees no incompatibil
ity between goals of lowering un
employment and inflation while "pur
suing aggressively the promises I have
made to the American people."
He mentioned most prominently
welfare and tax reform and the institu
tion of a comprehensive health care
program for all Americans.
Price controls
In response to a question, the
president-elect said that only some
sort of economic disaster would
prompt him to call for wage and price

controls.
"But under normal circumstances —
barringany kind of calamity — I would
think we can avoid mandatory wage
and price controls," he said.
In related transition plans, a
"peoples' inaugural" has been re
vealed for Carter's Jan. 20 oath-taking.
"The greatest concern of the
president-elect is that we reach the
maximum number of people possible
and involve the whole country in the
inauguration," said Bardyl Tirana,
co-chairman of Carter's inaugural

committee. "He wants to receive any
one who comes to Washington for the
inauguration. He wants an open inau
guration."
For the swearing-in ceremony Carter
will don a business suit instead of the
traditional morning coat and top hat
worn by many of his predecessors.
And his wife, Rosalynn, has said that
for the evening activities she'll wear
the same dress she wore for Carter's
installation as governor of Georgia five
years ago.
"We're planning an inauguration
which is traditional but modest in
tone, not extravagant," said Tirana.
Tirana said the morning of the
swearing-in Carter will attend Baptist
church services in Washington then
proceed to the Capitol to take the oath
of office.
"Afterwards there'll be the tradi
tional parade and we hope everyone
will come," Tirana said.
Invitations will soon go out to some
300,000 to 400,000 Carter campaign
workers for what the Carter administ
ration hopes will be a presidential in
augural reminiscent of Andrew
Jackson's celebration 148 years ago.
"The invitations will not entitle the
invitee to any special function any
member of the public couldn't attend,
but they will serve as acknowledge
ment of the role the invitee played in
electing Cov. Carter and Sen. Mon
dale," Tirana said.
Plains, Ga. (AP) — President-elect
Jimmy Carter said yesterday that tax
rebates and increased government
spending may be needed to spur the
nation's economy, and he discounted
the likelihood of wage and price con
trols.
Carter said at a news conference that
he believes that unemployment can be
reduced to between four and 4.5 per
cent over a long period of time, which
he said would be equivalent to three
per cent of all adults over 20 in the
jobless ranks. He said this would take
two to four years.
Current unemployment has reached
7.9 per cent.
The president-elect also repeated
his belief that inflation can be held
down by applying federal programs to
areas of highest unemployment rather
than through a uniform national prog
ram.
No details
Carter said he cannot at this point be
specific on details of his plans to de
crease unemployment or the possibil
ity that he might call for a general tax
reduction or one-time tax rebate.
