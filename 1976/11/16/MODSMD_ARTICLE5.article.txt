# Senate votes to support reconvening of C-15
## 
### Kathy Trafton Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate decided last night
to support the reconvening ot the
Committee of 15 (C-15) by a vote of 12
to 5 despite recent disapproval of such
a move by university officials.
The C-15 is a university-wide judf
cial body which proposes amend
ments to the Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968.
A special senate committee to inves
tigate the C-15 advised the senate that
it believed the C-15 should reconvene
to explore seven basic issues. The
commitee report, submitted by Sen.
Brad krevoy, stressed that it "merely
recommends these views ... be
explored, and that no position, posi
tive or negative, was taken on these
issues (by the committee)."
The first issue concerned a re
evaluation of the selection process of
student members of the Stanford Judi
cial Council (SJC). The SJC is now
composed of three students selected
on a random basis and three faculty
members chosen by the Academic Se

nate. ASSU President Vic Petroff
stated at t he last senate meeting t hat he
felt the "random selection procedure
(of selecting the students was) unfair."
Honor code
The second issue that the senate felt
the C-15 should consider is "honor
code violations by professors." The
committee report pointed out that pro
fessors who proctor examinations
often "unknowingly" violate the
Honor code.
The third issue concerns establish
ing a "student option on public or pri
vate hearing" with the SJC. The fourth
and fifth issues call upon the C-15 to
consider the advantages of allowing
undergraduate and graduate student
input in the selection process of the
chairperson of the Honor Code Viola
tions committee, and would establish
a "formal body ... for educating the
Stanford community on honor code
procedures." Currently, the chairper
son of Honor Code Violations is a law
student selected by the president.
The senate recommended that the
C-l 5 consider as a sixth issue the "au

tomatic yearly meeting" of the C-15.
Currently, the C-15 can only be con
vened by President Lyman, the SJC or
the Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC), a student body peti
tion or a special campus referendum.
The senate decided to follow these
prescribed channels as listed in order
of priority in its attempt to reconvene
the C-15.
Not guilty
The final C-15 issue would allow the
"option (for an accused student) to
plead (his or her) case to the dean
without admitting guilt." Any student
whose case is now heard by the Dean of
Student Affairs must admit guilt be
fore the penalty is applied. '
Legal Adviser to the President James
Siena spoke to the senate two weeks
ago in an attempt to discourage it from
taking action to reconvene the C-15
this year.
According to Siena, the administra
tion is "fundamentally satisfied with
the rules and regulations (as they now
stand)."
In other senate business, an "Anti-
Benign Neglect" resolution intended
to strengthen student organizations
was presented by Sen. Jeff Stoler for
the Hammer and Coffin slate and was
passed by a senate vote of 14 to 0. A
special committee was formed to work
toward "increasing the availability of
the 'Half-load' option to more students
who are particularly active in volun
tary organizations . . . (and) increasing
the availability of funds to voluntary
organizations through either direct
grants from the university or an easing
of the restrictions on groups soliciting
alumni support."
The senate approved two resolu
tions proposed by the Bylaws Commit
tee. The Course Cuide Policy Board
amendment provided that two faculty
members be added to the Course Guide
Board. The board was previously
composed of two ASSU senators, two
students and one member of the Coun
cil of Presidents.
