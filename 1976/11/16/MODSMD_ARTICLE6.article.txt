# Society to survey classes

A mandatory course survey and
teacher evaluation will be adminis
tered at the School of Engineering this
year by Tau Beta Pi, an honorary en
gineering society, according to a soci
ety officer.
"There's been a movement to im
prove teaching in the school. This
(survey) is one way to get feedback,"
said Charlote Mason, the society's re
cording seretary.
The survey was conducted last year
by the society and paid for by the
School of Engineering. Tau Beta Pi has
administered the survey every five
years for the past 15 years, said Mason.
"The Undergraduate Council of En
gineering voted to ask Tau Beta Pi to
administer the survey again this year
so that we might have further evalua
tion of teacher effectiveness," said
Lauress Wise, associate dean at the
School of Engineering.
The survey evaluates the instruc
tor's organization of course material,
teaching skills, enthusiasm and over
all effectiveness. Professors may use

the evaluations to help them improve
the teaching environment, said Ma
son.
Total evaluation
Students are also asked to comment
on the content, presentation and
mechanics of particular courses and to
summarize their satisfaction level, she
said.
"For students, the results help in the
selection of courses. Sometimes it puts
subtle pressure on the professors to
improve course content or material,"
Mason said.
While part of the survey involves
multiple-choice type responses, the
second section provides an essay for
mat where students may elaborate on
the strong and weak points of a par
ticular instructor and may suggest
possible changes necessary in the de
partment, she added.
The survey will be administered to
roughly 150 classes each quarter by the
55 Tau Beta Pi members.
"It's tremendously time-consuming.
Hopefully members will tally the clas
ses they survey," Mason said.
The results will be compiled by

Mason and Bruce Davis, president of
Tau Beta Pi.
Disgruntled professors
While most of the faculty approve of
the mandatory survey, some profes
sors do not, said Masqn.
"We're having trouble with some of
the faculty members. One of the most
important things we're striving for is
to improve communications between
professors and students and that's why
we're trying to keep the survey going,"
she said.
Last winter's survey results will be
published next week and will be avail
able in the engineering department
and at most libraries, according to Ma
son. The society plans to publish each
quarter's survey results prior to the
corresponding quarter the next
academic year, she said.
Results of the survey may be useful
to students interested in specific
courses in a particular major or minor.
Other parts of the survey are seen only
by the particular instructors. All stu
dent comments are anonymous.
