# Stanford Daily Opinions
## Penalty by rank at Stanford? 
### 
Barbara Honegger

Frankly I was struck, as was Presi
dent Richard Lyman, to hear of an al
leged physical attack by a member of
this campus community upon another.
I agree the act was accurately de
scribed as dangerous, with potential
for far more serious harm than was
done that evening.
I concur such behavior is extremely
serious and completely beyond the
bounds of tolerable behavior for our
community — as it would be in any
—and applaud Lyman's decision that
such gross violation of human rights
and dignity be met with immediate or
protracted separation from the univer
sity.
Unfortunately I cannot agree with
his assurance "it will be clear from this
(the Delt) case that behaviorof the kind
exhibited by the defendants herein
will he met with meaningful penalties
at Stanford" (Daily, Oct. 4).
I cannot agree because 1 have not
been speaking of the alleged campus
attack of a member of the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity upon a member of the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity. I have been
speaking of the alleged campus attack
of a tenured faculty member upon his
employe.
As alleged in civil suit No. P29567
filed in Santa Clara County Superior
Court, the professor, on Oct. 29, 1975,
"went into a violent fit of anger and
willfully, intentionally and malici
ously assaulted, beat and struck plain
tiff in and about the head, face and
upper body."
Ironically, many of us expected then
precisely the outrage Lyman expres
sed so forcefully towards the Delt de
fendants only months later. Is it possi
ble our most responsible official and
highest judge considered the situa

tions of unequal danger? Is it possible
he did not consider both situations ex
tremely serious and completely
beyond bounds tolerable for our com
munity?
Is it possible he did not consider
both situations gross violations of
human rights and dignity to be met
equally with immediate or protracted
separation from the university?
Phenomenally, the facts argue that he
did not.
The professor, tenured in two de
partments of this university, was
neither suspended nor subjected to
"immediate or protracted separation
from the university" (to quote once
again from Lyman's Delt decision), but
settled the matter by agreement with
Lyman, accepting instead Lyman's re
lative near-pardon penalty of a one
time reduction in pay and two years'
probation before any charges were
lodged against him before the faculty
Advisory Board.
After a year and especially following
the magnitude of the Delt decision, 1
must say I still do not find the terms of
this probation particularly "meaning
ful." "If during the period of his proba
tion," the professor was told, "there is
a finding (the professor) has struck a
member of the University, or anyone
on campus, it might be cause for his
dismissal."
My critical faculties remain
paralyzed at the disparity of Lyman's
responses. I cannot imagine the Delt
defendant being told he might be dis
missed should he strike someone else.
Less do I comprehend the immunity of
the professor to immediate or prot
racted separation from the university.
Least of all am I able to fathom sus-

pension of an entire fraternity for the
alleged actions of a few of its members.
Why Lyman chose not to exercise this
same logic and close two departments
for three years for the alleged actions of
one of its members remains a mystery.
If there is reason behind these ac
tions, it escapes me. It is not a question
of severity of the supposed offenses.
As Lyman knows, it is not a question of
"evidence."
What, then, is it a question of? As
only he can answer this question for
us, 1 call upon Lyman to support his
difference in disposition of the two
cases to the Daily or leave us each with
the inevitable conclusion Stanford not
only condones penalty through guilt
by association but an equally unjust
and Precambrian system of penalty by
rank.

Frankly I was struck, as was Presi
dent Richard Lyman, to hear of an al
leged physical attack by a member of
this campus community upon another.
I agree the act was accurately de
scribed as dangerous, with potential
for far more serious harm than was
done that evening.
I concur such behavior is extremely
serious and completely beyond the
bounds of tolerable behavior for our
community — as it would be in any
—and applaud Lyman's decision that
such gross violation of human rights
and dignity be met with immediate or
protracted separation from the univer
sity.
Unfortunately I cannot agree with
his assurance "it will be clear from this
(the Delt) case that behaviorof the kind
exhibited by the defendants herein
will he met with meaningful penalties
at Stanford" (Daily, Oct. 4).
I cannot agree because 1 have not
been speaking of the alleged campus
attack of a member of the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity upon a member of the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity. I have been
speaking of the alleged campus attack
of a tenured faculty member upon his
employe.
As alleged in civil suit No. P29567
filed in Santa Clara County Superior
Court, the professor, on Oct. 29, 1975,
"went into a violent fit of anger and
willfully, intentionally and malici
ously assaulted, beat and struck plain
tiff in and about the head, face and
upper body."
Ironically, many of us expected then
precisely the outrage Lyman expres
sed so forcefully towards the Delt de
fendants only months later. Is it possi
ble our most responsible official and
highest judge considered the situa

tions of unequal danger? Is it possible
he did not consider both situations ex
tremely serious and completely
beyond bounds tolerable for our com
munity?
Is it possible he did not consider
both situations gross violations of
human rights and dignity to be met
equally with immediate or protracted
separation from the university?
Phenomenally, the facts argue that he
did not.
The professor, tenured in two de
partments of this university, was
neither suspended nor subjected to
"immediate or protracted separation
from the university" (to quote once
again from Lyman's Delt decision), but
settled the matter by agreement with
Lyman, accepting instead Lyman's re
lative near-pardon penalty of a one
time reduction in pay and two years'
probation before any charges were
lodged against him before the faculty
Advisory Board.
After a year and especially following
the magnitude of the Delt decision, 1
must say I still do not find the terms of
this probation particularly "meaning
ful." "If during the period of his proba
tion," the professor was told, "there is
a finding (the professor) has struck a
member of the University, or anyone
on campus, it might be cause for his
dismissal."
My critical faculties remain
paralyzed at the disparity of Lyman's
responses. I cannot imagine the Delt
defendant being told he might be dis
missed should he strike someone else.
Less do I comprehend the immunity of
the professor to immediate or prot
racted separation from the university.
Least of all am I able to fathom sus-

pension of an entire fraternity for the
alleged actions of a few of its members.
Why Lyman chose not to exercise this
same logic and close two departments
for three years for the alleged actions of
one of its members remains a mystery.
If there is reason behind these ac
tions, it escapes me. It is not a question
of severity of the supposed offenses.
As Lyman knows, it is not a question of
"evidence."
What, then, is it a question of? As
only he can answer this question for
