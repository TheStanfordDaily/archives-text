# Royden investigation of Foley case faulty

Behn et al

Last June, the Economics Student
Unison Committee filed a student
grievance with Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Halsey Royden ques
tioning the merits of the economics fa
culty decision to postpone a tenure re
gymmendation on Asst. Prof. Duncan
Foley.
On Wednesday, Nov. 3, Royden re
ported his findings in a letter addres
sed to the Liaison Committee with a
copy to the Economics Department.
The Liaison Committee had antici
pated meeting with the dean to discuss
the adequacy of his investigation be
fore releasing his letter and comment
ing publicly.
But because the Economics Depart
ment promptly released the letter with
the dean's permission, we are raising
our criticism in public as we believe
the letter is being improperly used to
validate the Foley tenure decision.
Inconsistent language
While Royden met formally with us
four times for discussion of the grie
vance. he failed to investigate sys
tematically the questions posed in the
grievance. Further, the language of the
dean's formal response to the Liaison
Committee is inconsistent with state
ments he made to us, and incorrectly
implies the evidence examined was
sufficient to draw conclusions about
the questions students raised about the
decision.
The letter has two principal parag
raphs. The first explains that following
the initial department decision to
postpone a tenure recommendation.
(December 1975). the dean examined
the records of the decision and made
further inquiries outside the univer
sity.
Charges
The letter stated his conclusion was
that the "Department's decision was
an eminently reasonable one." When
we first met with Royden to file our
grievance, his account of these events
was significantly different. He said he
was quite concerned by the depart
ment's decision because he had heard
very good things about Foley-
As a result, he decided on his own to
review the decision and made in
quiries of people outside Stanford. His
conclusion at that time, as stated to us
in June, was that the decision was a
"judgment call" which could have
gone either way. Recall this response
was before he undertook to examine
any of the questions we raised.
Now the dean publicly frames the
conclusion of his initial inquiries very
differently. A close judgment call is
now referred to as a "eminently

reasonable" decision.
The second paragraph of the dean's
letter represents his response to the
student grievance. Here the dean im
plies that he systematically
reexamined the most important evi
dence available and this evidence was
sufficient to conclude that the decision
was reasonable and proper.
Royden told us when first agreeing
to investigate our grievance that he
startedfrom theassumption that politi
cal discrimination did not occur be
cause it was such a serious charge. His
comments to us as the months passed
clearly left us with the impression that
he was narrowing his investigation so
as not to challenge this assumption.
In response to this we explicitly
stated what we believed to be the
minimum requirements of a meaning
ful investigation of the serious ques
tions of political discrimination. Since
we know for a fact that the dean failed
to examine important aspects of this
evidence we assert his conclusions on
political bias are ill-founded.
Difficult to identify
Political discrimination in ap
pointment decisions is difficult to un
derstand or identify except histori
cally. Because of extensive discussion
of this problem in economics in recent
years, faculty members are unlikely to
suggest in tenure deliberations or to
the dean that their actions are based on
political bias.
But evidence strongly suggests this
is the case. Individual faculty in the
department have demonstrated persis
tent patterns of political discrimina
tion. They have publicly stated they
find Marxian economics scientifically
flawed, decline to explain the
academic basis for their judgment to
students, and yet they actively oppose
appointment of faculty who have used
Marxian analytic methods.
Student discussions with all faculty
members over the past several years
indicate there is a significant overlap
of faculty who vigorously opposed the
appointment of Prof. Donald Harris (a
Marxian economist) between 1973 and
1975, and faculty who now vigorously
oppose the tenured appointment of
Foley.
Failed to object
Those faculty who opposed Foley's
appointment failed to raise their objec
tions on Foley's record for careful re
view by the department's evaluation
committee which unanimously re
commended Foley for tenure and ap
pointment to full professor.
It was not until the senior facultv

met as a group to reach a tenure re
commendation that most of the faculty
became privy to certain questions re
garding interpretation of Foley's re
search record. Based on these objec
tions, which had not been subject to
verification, the faculty voted to post
pone Â£ tenure recommendation and
reappointed Foley for three years.
It appears Foley's recent research on
Marxist monetary theory changed fa
culty attitudes towards his work, even
his past research.
Explain roles
A proper investigation of the Foley
decision should not be based on a sim
ple polling of a few faculty on whether
or not they "believed there was evi
dence of improper consideration or
political bias." Instead, the dean
should have asked individual faculty
members to explain their role in past
tenure decisions which are pertinent
to considerations of political dis
crimination and the consistency of
standards applied in the Foley case.
The fact that we know the dean
failed to do this in important instances
leads us to conclude he gathered insuf
ficient evidence on which to respond
to the student grievance or seriously
question his original assumptions that
political discrimination did not occur.
The serious possibility of political
bias in the Foley case is not the onlv

important unanswered question fol
lowing the dean's response. Other
questions unexplained are: Why
didn't the economics faculty honor
their promise to Foley to reach a tenure
decision, and why was teaching excel
lence again unrewarded at Stanford?
No explanation
We have received no explanation
from the dean or the Economics De
partment that give us any confidence
that procedures exist to insure teach
ing and research are treated symmetri
cally in tenure decisions consistent
with university policies.
It appears bad teaching is simply
embarrassing and good teaching is
simply commendable. Tenure deci
sions are largely unaffected by teach
ing performance.
We were encouraged when Royden
told us at our last meeting, prior to his
report, that he would be alert to future
problems of political discrimination in
the department, but problems of polit
ical bias are present today. Over 600
students recently signed the student
petition supporting a tenure decision
for Foley. The Foley case cannot be
filed away.
