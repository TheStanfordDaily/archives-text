### 
Washington (AP) — President-elect
Jimmy Carter's new chief talent scout
said yesterday he is sure some Repub
licans or independents will be in the
Carter cabinet, although no special ef
fort is being made to recruit them.
Hamilton Jordan, who managed Car
ter's Democratic presidential cam
paign and was named Monday to lead
the search for the new administration,
said his job is to help Carter "find the
best people" and that there is no com
mitment to form a bipartisan cabinet.
"I'm sure it's inevitable," he added,
"that there will be some Republicans
or independents in there, as well as
Democrats."
Meanwhile, the White House an
nounced that as a result of a telephone
call between Carter and President
Cerald Ford arrangements are being
made for the two men to confer in
Washington next week. No date has
been set for the meeting, their first
since the final televised campaign de
bate.
It was also announced yesterday that
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger will
fly to Carter's Plains, Ga., home Satur
day to brief the President-elect on
foreign policy. CIA Director George
Bush briefs Carter on Friday. Vice
President-elect Walter Mondale will
attend both briefings.
Presidential Press Secretary Ron
Nessen said Ford and Carter spoke by
telephone Monday night in what was
described as a cordial and businesslike
conversation.
As the Carter transition team was
formally moving into its new quarters
at the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, the President-elect's first
White House appointee. Press Secret
ary Jody Powell, was meeting in the
White House with Nessen.
Carter's appointment of Jordan to
run the recruiting drive reduced the
authority of transition coordinator
Jack Watson Jr., who had been in
charge of what was called a "talent
inventory" staff.
That staff, according to a spokesman
for the transition team, has been trans
ferred to Jordan's control, leaving Wat
son in charge of budget planning, pol
icy and liaison with federal agencies.
Key Carter aides Stuart Eizenstat
and Bowman Cutter will be working
with Watson on transition operations.
Jordan, at an impromptu news con
ference in a hallway outside the transi
tion offices, said he would be sur
prised if any cabinet appointments are
announced soon.
Jordan said his team has defined the
personal qualities needed to fill each
cabinet post and is calling people
around the country for recommenda
tions.

said his job is to help Carter "find the
best people" and that there is no com
mitment to form a bipartisan cabinet.
"I'm sure it's inevitable," he added,
"that there will be some Republicans
or independents in there, as well as
Democrats."
Meanwhile, the White House an
nounced that as a result of a telephone
call between Carter and President
Cerald Ford arrangements are being
made for the two men to confer in
Washington next week. No date has
been set for the meeting, their first
since the final televised campaign de
bate.
It was also announced yesterday that
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger will
fly to Carter's Plains, Ga., home Satur
day to brief the President-elect on
foreign policy. CIA Director George
Bush briefs Carter on Friday. Vice
President-elect Walter Mondale will
attend both briefings.
Presidential Press Secretary Ron
Nessen said Ford and Carter spoke by
telephone Monday night in what was
described as a cordial and businesslike
conversation.
As the Carter transition team was
formally moving into its new quarters
at the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, the President-elect's first
White House appointee. Press Secret
ary Jody Powell, was meeting in the
White House with Nessen.
Carter's appointment of Jordan to
run the recruiting drive reduced the
authority of transition coordinator
Jack Watson Jr., who had been in
charge of what was called a "talent
inventory" staff.
That staff, according to a spokesman
for the transition team, has been trans
ferred to Jordan's control, leaving Wat
son in charge of budget planning, pol
icy and liaison with federal agencies.
Key Carter aides Stuart Eizenstat
and Bowman Cutter will be working
with Watson on transition operations.
Jordan, at an impromptu news con
ference in a hallway outside the transi
tion offices, said he would be sur
prised if any cabinet appointments are
announced soon.
Jordan said his team has defined the
personal qualities needed to fill each
cabinet post and is calling people
around the country for recommenda
tions.
