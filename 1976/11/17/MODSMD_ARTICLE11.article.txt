# Who will catch the falling GOP flag?
## 
### 
In the end, being a nice guy wasn't
enough. The old Leo Durocher quip
that "Nice guys finish last" held true
as Jerry Ford, a man who restored the
faith and confidence of the American
people in the presidency, could not
overcome the Democratic coalition
that the former governor of Georgia
had come from out of nowhere to pro
duce.
The Republicans lost the White
House by the narrowest of margins—
the closest electoral vote total since
1916. A switch of only 7500 votes in
Hawaii and Ohio would have left Ford
in the White House. Though the Grand
Old Party had a few bright spots on
election day, it is now left in worse
position than after the 1964 Democra

tic landslide, and with no clear leader
for the future.
Who will catch the falling GOP flag?
Speculation at this early point is not

worth making, but we can make
reasonable inferences by examining
the mood of the country.
A summation of our thesis is this:

the nation is essentially conservative,
yet decidedly anti-Republican. A Gal
lup poll taken in May of this year
shows a full 51 per cent of all Ameri
cans call themselves "conservatives,"
12 per cent are "middle-of-the-road"
and 37 per cent lean to the left.
It is interesting to note that when
this poll was taken in May, Carter had
nearly a 30-point lead over Ford at the
same time that 53 percent of the public
saw him as a "conservative" and only
26 per cent called him a "liberal".
Lean to the left
As Carter shifted to the left, his sup
port dwindled. In early fall, he was
seen as "liberal" by 48 per cent of the
public as opposed to 46 per cent who
saw him leaning to the right. By elec
tion day when he won by only 2 per
centage points, he was clearly viewed
as a liberal, by a margin of 60 per cent
to 32 per cent.
Carter was thus able to win by being
all things to all people, as he shifted
from being the conservative alterna
tive to George Wallace in January to
the liberal "running-mate of Walter
Mondale" in November.
Surely this helped to hold his coali
tion together in the liberal Northeast,
as he relied on his southern accent to
create a modern "regional jingoism"
and carry the normally conservative
South.
But the 30 point slide in the polls
cannot be ignored and is significant in
view of the patchwork victory he wove
in the face of solid West and Midwest
ern opposition to him.
The problem
Returning then to the problem: since
it is generally accepted that the GOP
lies somewhere to the right of the
Democrats, why do 51 per cent of all
Americans call themselves "conserva
tives" yet only 22 per cent will admit
to being Republicans? Why haven't
traditional Republican leaders been
able to forge a majority party from
these figures? The answer is three
fold.
First, American parties by their na
ture have been coalitional, not

ideological. Wallace is every bit as
much a Democrat as George
McGovern; Barry Goldwater sits on the
same side of the aisle as Charles Percy.
Thus party label must play a signific
ant role in American politics, as we
consider the problem a voter faces in
choosing between a conservative
Democrat and a liberal Republican.
Different definitions
Second, the Americans polled in the
Gallup surveys each have different de
finitions of what is "conservative" and
what is "liberal"—the terms are ex
tremely vague. Today's conservative
espouses similar views to the 19th cen
tury liberal or even the 18th century
radical.
Is it conservative or liberal to sup
port Israel in the Middle East? To op
pose big government? To favor a nega
tive income tax? Many liberals and
conservatives will claim these issues
as their own, and the voter may easily
confuse his own support of these posi
tions as making him a member of the
left or the right.
But the major problem the GOP has
is not its ideology but its image. De
spite a platform which likely reflected
the feelings of a majority of Americans
this year, it is viewed as the party of big
business, of Richard Nixon and Spiro
Agnew and of preserving the status
quo These negative images all but
erase the coalitional benefits a party
should have when it blesses a Goldwa
ter and a Percy with a common name.
One thing is clear: if the GOP is to
regain its posture as a national force it
must reach out to the vast number of
independents and Democrats who call
themselves conservatives. It must do
so in a bold and straightforward way,
undiluted by special interests and be
coming clearly once again "the party
of the 'little man'."
Only a man-who holds these views
can lead the wounded GOP back.
Otherwise, the party may have to be
content to sit as the "loyal opposition"
for many decades to come.
