Washington (AP} — Can a
medical school reject a white
student with test scores higher
than minority students admitted
under a special program? Or is
that racial discrimination in re
verse?
The Supreme Court may agree
to wrestle with that question. It it
does, its answer could carry
great consequences for affirma
tive action programs in educa
tion and business throughout
the nation.
The justices on Monday tem
porarily set aside an order by the
California Supreme Court strik
ing down a program at the Uni
versity of California-Davis Med
ical School that gives admission
preference to minority students.
'Into the mainstream'
While not denying the racial
and ethnic aspect of its program
at Davis and other IJC campuses,
the university's regents said they
were attempting "to bring his

torically under-represented
minorities and ethnic groups
into the mainstream of our coun
try's educational and profes
sional life."
The charge of "reverse dis
crimination" was made by Allan
Bakke, an 36-year-old white civil
engineer who twice was turned
down for admission to the medi
cal school.
Me charged that he was dis
criminated against because
IJC-Davis admitted 1H lower
rated students, all minority
members.
The Supreme Court gave the
UC regents 30 days to appeal the
statecourt's ruling, saying it will
hold in abeyance the order dis
mantling the affirmative action
program pending the appeal.
Drop the case
Many civil rights groups—
including the NAACP, the Mex
ican American Legal Defense
Fund and the National Confer

ence of Black Lawyers—have
urged the regents to drop the
case. They fear an adverse ruling
could jeopardize affirmative ac
tion programs in schools as well
as in working places.
The court on Monday also:
—Agreed to hear arguments in
a case where a worker alleges
that he lost his job because of
religious discrimination
—Refused to consider an ap
peal by Fairfax County, Va., and
Nassau County, N.Y., authorities
seeking to void federal approval
of landing rights the supersonic
Concorde jetliner at airports
within their confines.
—Refused to consider the con
stitutionality of a curfew im
posed by Middletown, Pa.,
which prohibits persons under
18 from being away from their
homes at night when unescorted
or without prior approval. About
3000 U.S. cities and towns have
similar curfews.

Washington (AP} — Can a
medical school reject a white
student with test scores higher
than minority students admitted
under a special program? Or is
that racial discrimination in re
verse?
The Supreme Court may agree
to wrestle with that question. It it
does, its answer could carry
great consequences for affirma
tive action programs in educa
tion and business throughout
the nation.
The justices on Monday tem
porarily set aside an order by the
California Supreme Court strik
ing down a program at the Uni
versity of California-Davis Med
ical School that gives admission
preference to minority students.
'Into the mainstream'
While not denying the racial
and ethnic aspect of its program
at Davis and other IJC campuses,
the university's regents said they
were attempting "to bring his

torically under-represented
minorities and ethnic groups
into the mainstream of our coun
try's educational and profes
sional life."
The charge of "reverse dis
crimination" was made by Allan
Bakke, an 36-year-old white civil
engineer who twice was turned
down for admission to the medi
cal school.
Me charged that he was dis
criminated against because
IJC-Davis admitted 1H lower
rated students, all minority
members.
The Supreme Court gave the
UC regents 30 days to appeal the
statecourt's ruling, saying it will
hold in abeyance the order dis
mantling the affirmative action
program pending the appeal.
Drop the case
Many civil rights groups—
including the NAACP, the Mex
ican American Legal Defense
Fund and the National Confer

ence of Black Lawyers—have
urged the regents to drop the
case. They fear an adverse ruling
could jeopardize affirmative ac
tion programs in schools as well
as in working places.
The court on Monday also:
—Agreed to hear arguments in
a case where a worker alleges
that he lost his job because of
religious discrimination
—Refused to consider an ap
peal by Fairfax County, Va., and
Nassau County, N.Y., authorities
