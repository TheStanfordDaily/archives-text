# Western civ standards discussed
## 
### Bob Svikhart Staff writer 
, Following discussion r>bout
tht! reinstatement of the western
civilization requirement in last
week's meeting of the Faculty
Senate, President Richart Lyman
appeared on KZSU's Campus
Conference Tuesday night to
discuss the proposed require
ment.
Lyman said that he is "not at
all confident that the western
civilization requirement is going
to be approved (by the Faculty
Senate, which has the responsi
bility for deciding whether the
requirement will be reinstated)."
"My hope," said Lyman, "is
that there is debate about it and
my principal hope is that the de
bate may be useful and construc
tive."
The debate about a western
civilization requirement, which
was dropped from the universi
ty's list of requirements in the
late; 19fi()s, was prompted when
a committee in the School of
Humanities and Sciences prop
osed the reinstatement of there

quiement. The proposal was sent
to the Committee on Under
graduate Studies before it was
initially debated in the Senate.
"It is impossible to predict
which way it (the decision on the
requirement) will go," Lyman
added. "The Faculty Senate is
meeting again on Dec. 2. and at
that time, there can be resolu
tions (in the senate) for voting on
the matter."
When asked why there is such
a drive to reinstate a mandatory
western civilization program
after its abolishment in the 60s,
Lyman said that the course was
"a target of a general move
against academic require
ments." Lyman also said that
there is a fear in the university
community that supposedly
educated people are emerging
from Stanford without "a basic
knowledge of their own cul
ture."
The original western civiliza
tion class had deteriorated, and
this was also part of the reason
for its removal as a requirement,
Lyman added. The new proposal

would differ from the old
method, as it would offer stu
dents a choice from several
sequences of courses, instead of
the single course that had oper
ated in the past.
One of the major objections to
required courses is that the
"dead weight." or students that
are not interested, hinder the
progress of pupils truly in
terested in the material. "This is
quite possibly the most potent
argument against require
ments," Lyman said.
The president was also asked
to discuss his views on the re
convening of the Committee of
15 (which was proposed by the
ASSU Senate at its Monday
night meeting). Lyman said: "I
think that people on the faculty
and administration side are
fairly well convinced that they

have seen or heard all of the ar
guments that are likely to come
forth on that issue, and they
don't find them terribly persua
sive. So 1 have been reluctant to
ask people to waste a whole lot of
timegoing over familiar grounds
as far as nominations and ap
pointments, to the SJC (Student
Judicial Council) are con
cerned."
Lyman was also asked to
comment on the survey pub
lished in Campus Heport about
the honor code. The survey indi
cated a low faculty awareness.
"Faculty should abide by the
Honor Code (by not proctoring
exams). It should be feasible to
bring grievances against the fa
culty for not abiding by the
Honor Code. If the Honor Code is
going to work, it has to be a
two-way street."

meeting again on Dec. 2. and at
that time, there can be resolu
tions (in the senate) for voting on
the matter."
When asked why there is such
a drive to reinstate a mandatory
western civilization program
after its abolishment in the 60s,
Lyman said that the course was
"a target of a general move
against academic require
ments." Lyman also said that
there is a fear in the university
community that supposedly
educated people are emerging
from Stanford without "a basic
knowledge of their own cul
ture."
The original western civiliza
tion class had deteriorated, and
this was also part of the reason
for its removal as a requirement,
Lyman added. The new proposal

would differ from the old
method, as it would offer stu
dents a choice from several
sequences of courses, instead of
the single course that had oper
ated in the past.
One of the major objections to
required courses is that the
"dead weight." or students that
are not interested, hinder the
progress of pupils truly in
terested in the material. "This is
quite possibly the most potent
argument against require
ments," Lyman said.
The president was also asked
to discuss his views on the re
convening of the Committee of
15 (which was proposed by the
ASSU Senate at its Monday
night meeting). Lyman said: "I
think that people on the faculty
and administration side are
fairly well convinced that they

have seen or heard all of the ar
guments that are likely to come
forth on that issue, and they
don't find them terribly persua
sive. So 1 have been reluctant to
ask people to waste a whole lot of
timegoing over familiar grounds
as far as nominations and ap
pointments, to the SJC (Student
Judicial Council) are con
cerned."
Lyman was also asked to
comment on the survey pub
lished in Campus Heport about
the honor code. The survey indi
cated a low faculty awareness.
"Faculty should abide by the
Honor Code (by not proctoring
exams). It should be feasible to
bring grievances against the fa
culty for not abiding by the
Honor Code. If the Honor Code is
going to work, it has to be a
two-way street."
, Following discussion r>bout
tht! reinstatement of the western
civilization requirement in last
week's meeting of the Faculty
Senate, President Richart Lyman
appeared on KZSU's Campus
Conference Tuesday night to
discuss the proposed require
ment.
Lyman said that he is "not at
all confident that the western
civilization requirement is going
to be approved (by the Faculty
Senate, which has the responsi
bility for deciding whether the
requirement will be reinstated)."
"My hope," said Lyman, "is
that there is debate about it and
my principal hope is that the de
bate may be useful and construc
tive."
The debate about a western
civilization requirement, which
was dropped from the universi
ty's list of requirements in the
late; 19fi()s, was prompted when
a committee in the School of
Humanities and Sciences prop
osed the reinstatement of there

quiement. The proposal was sent
to the Committee on Under
graduate Studies before it was
initially debated in the Senate.
"It is impossible to predict
which way it (the decision on the
requirement) will go," Lyman
added. "The Faculty Senate is
meeting again on Dec. 2. and at
that time, there can be resolu
tions (in the senate) for voting on
the matter."
