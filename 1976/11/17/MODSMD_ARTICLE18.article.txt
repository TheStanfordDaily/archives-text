Sacramento (AP) — Califor
nia's population grow by almost
1.5 million in the last six years,
increased by large influxes of
people including thousands of
Vietnamese refugees, the state
said Tuesday.
On July 1, there were
21,520,000 Californians, up
from 20,026,000 on July 1,1970,
according to state estimates.
In the last three years, net mig
ration into the state increased
significantly from a low point in
1971 and 1972, the state De
partment of Finance's popula
tion research unit said in a re
port.
Orange County— once a rural
area dotted with orange
groves—led all other counties in
number of additional residents
with a 328,700 increase to
1,749,900 up 23.1 per cent from
six years age.
Mono County in Northern

California had the largest per
centage increase, up 82.2 per
cent in six years, and Santa Cruz
County led all counties above
100,000 population with a 31.4
per cent jump.
Angeles and San Fran
cisco were the only counties to
show a population drop during
the six years, but Los Angeles
has been making a gradual come
back in recent years after an early
1970s lag.
Migration figures included
50,000 Indochinese in the last
two years, and state officials said
at least 90 per cent of them were
Vietnamese refugees who came
here at the end of the Vietnam
War.
There were 322,000 births in
the most recent year, up from
lower totals in the early 19705,
but state officials said that might
only reflect the fact some

couples waited longer to have
children.
"There's been a rather surpris
ing recovery in migration." said
Walter Hollman, chief of the
population research unit, in an
interview.
"It's certainly less than our
heyday in the late 1950s and
early 19605. That heyday proba
bly had to do with the fact that
California was the land of oppor
tunity. Life magazine ran whole
issues about us.
"Then the bloom wore off the
rose when people started talking
about the smog and environmen
tal degradation, and it got
crowded." Hollmann added.
Net migration figures —
calculated on the basis of people
leaving and entering the
state—were 107,000. 185,000
and 175,000 for the last three
years, compared to 60,000 in
both 1971 and 1972.

Orange County— once a rural
area dotted with orange
groves—led all other counties in
number of additional residents
with a 328,700 increase to
1,749,900 up 23.1 per cent from
six years age.
Mono County in Northern

California had the largest per
centage increase, up 82.2 per

County led all counties above
100,000 population with a 31.4
per cent jump.
Angeles and San Fran
cisco were the only counties to
show a population drop during
the six years, but Los Angeles
has been making a gradual come
back in recent years after an early
1970s lag.
Migration figures included
50,000 Indochinese in the last
two years, and state officials said
at least 90 per cent of them were
Vietnamese refugees who came
here at the end of the Vietnam
War.
There were 322,000 births in
the most recent year, up from
lower totals in the early 19705,

only reflect the fact some

couples waited longer to have
children.
"There's been a rather surpris
ing recovery in migration." said

interview.
"It's certainly less than our
heyday in the late 1950s and
early 19605. That heyday proba

issues about us.
"Then the bloom wore off the
rose when people started talking
about the smog and environmen
tal degradation, and it got
crowded." Hollmann added.
Net migration figures —
calculated on the basis of people
leaving and entering the
state—were 107,000. 185,000
