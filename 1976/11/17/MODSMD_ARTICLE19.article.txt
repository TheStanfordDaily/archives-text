# 'Perfect Master' hits hard times

Denver (AP) — His organiza
tion claimed six million follow
ers when Guru Maharaj Ji was
15. Devotees clambered over one
another to prostrate themselves
at his feet as he dispensed what
they called The Knowledge.
That was four years ago. Times
have changed.
The faithful now number 1.2
million, according to a spokes
man for his Divine Light Mis
sion.
Donations have fallen off and

the church is retrenching. Its
printing business is gone and
some of the property in Denver
and other American cities has
been sold. The lease has been
dropped on the computer that
once kept track of the pudgy
teenager's following.
Some of the more extravagant
claims tabut the guru's divinity
also have been dropped. Once,
Maharaj Ji was known as "Lord
of the Universe" and "Perfect
Master" to his devotees. Now,

spokesman for the guru, de
scribes his as "thi! point of inspi
ration for all of us."
The Indian guru did away
with foot-kissing and prostra
tion, Eastern customs "that
didn't go over very well in the
West," said Anctil.
The guru still preaches medi
tation, selfless serving and shar
ing, but his recruiters have toned
down their style.
For the first time Americans as
well as Indians are permitted to
initiate members and they and
their Eastern counterparts now
rely on discussion groups for re
cruiting instead of taking ag
gressively to the streets.

grab people because that really
doesn't work. We're really just
offering this," said Robert Mish

American division.

longer live in ascetic church
owned buildings known as ash
rams.
As devotees moved out of as
hrams, their weekly paychecks,
previously turned over to the
guru's treasury, were missed.

$100,000 a month to 70 per cent
of that, although Anctil said

declining income forced a deci
