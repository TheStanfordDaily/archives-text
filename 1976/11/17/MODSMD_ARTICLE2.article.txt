# Quebec secession feared
## Speculation sweeps Canada 
### 
Montreal (AP) — Speculation and
concern about the future of Canada
swept the country yesterday after the
election victory of the pro-separatist
Parti Quebecois in Quebec provincial
elections.
A number of politicians and busi
ness leaders called for a quick referen
dum on independence for the French

speaking province to get the question
settled.
Prime Minister Pierre Elliott
Trudeau told the Parliament in Ottawa
that the federal government will not
negotiate any form of separation with
Quebec or any other province but of
fered to have an early meeting with
Rene Levesque, the 54-year-old Parti

Quebecois leader and future premier.
"We have only one mandate,"
Trudeau declared. "That is to govern
the whole country."
Secession referendum
Levesque has promised a referen
dum on secession within two years.
Though once considered a radical,
Levesque assured Canadians that there
will be "no Berlin Wall on the Ottawa
River".
When vote counting ended Monday
night, the Parti Quebecois, or
Pequistes, had won 66 of the 110 seats
in the National Assembly—the Quebec
legislature—and was leading for three
others. The Liberals had 27 seats and
were leading for one more. In the last
assembly there were 102 Liberals and
six Pequistes.
The Union Nationale party, which
ruled Quebec form 1944 to 1970,
staged a resurgence and won 11 seats.
The Creditiste and Popular National
parties won one seat each.
The Parti Quebecois received about
41 per cent of the popular vote; the
Liberals got 34 per cent; Union
Nationale took 18 per cent; and minor
parties got the rest.
Many against separation
This meant 59 per cent of the popu
lar vote went to antiseparatist parties,
and opinion polls before the election
indicated only about 20 per cent of the
voters were diehard separatists.
But to the crowds of Pequistes who
celebrated in the Montreal streets and
mobbed Levesque at party headquar
ters early yesterday, their victory
seemed complete.
"We shall have the Quebec of which
our ancestors dreamed," declared one
jubilant rally speaker, referring to New
France's defeat by the British some 200
years ago.
Levesque, a former broadcast jour
nalist who quit the Liberal party in
1967 to campaign for Quebec inde
pendence. said he hoped Quebec
would become an "adult society" by
voting for independence.
