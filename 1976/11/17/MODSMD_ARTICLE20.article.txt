# Secret police seek out Iranian college students

From Ihe College Press Service
"I was imprisoned for writing about repression in Iran...The
torture on the second day of my arrest consisted of seventy five
blows with a plaited whip at the soles of my feet. I was whipped on
my hands as well, and the head torturer took the small finger on my
hand and broke it, saying that he was going to break my fingers one
by one, one each day."
-Iranian poet Reza Baraheni
And that's just for starters. The electrical prods, injection of air
bubbles and teeth-pulling comes later.
According to Baraheni, Iran's dreated secret police SAVAK
knows no limits in tracking down and torturing Iranians who
oppose the fascistic monarchy of the Shah.
Since the Shah's takeover in 1953, a coup engineered by the CIA,
more than 300,000 people have been in and out of Iranian prisons,
all at the mercy of ruthless SAVAK officers. Amnesty International
approximates between 25,000 and 100,000 people are currently
political prisoners in Iran.
But there's a new twist in SAVAK's operation. The government
of Iran is now exporting its domestic terrorism to all points of the
globe in order to sniff out and eliminate Iranian dissidents.
Agents in U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Alfred Atherton confirmed last
month that SAVAK agents are in the United' States, monitoring the
activities of insurgent Iranian students and intellectuals. In an
interview with CBS correspondent Mike Wallace, the Shah himself
acknowledged that SAVAK personnel are presently hunting down
enemies of his regime in the U.S.
And moreSAVAK squadrons arearriving intheU.S. all the time.
Last August, Prof. Richard Cottam, of the University of Pittsburgh,
was told by a State Department official that SAVAK agents were
planning to exploit the cooperation of Mafia elements to snuff out
Iranians disloyal to the Shah.
"These men," the professor said, "will appear as ordinary mug
gersand kill the Iranians oneby one." Cottam warned Baraheni that
he may be at the top of the SAVAK hit list.
Students
Columnist Jack Anderson recently reported that most of
SAVAK's dirty tricks are aimed towards the growing number of
Iranian students in the U.S. who oppose the Shah's imperial re
gime. One secret SAVAK document that Anderson uncovered
states, "all branches should send information regarding demon
strations of dissident Iranians, strikes, suspicious traffic, holdings
of meetings, publishing of publications and conventions and
seminars."
The Iranian government is spending millions of dollars on

American universities, says Baraheni. with one aim in mind to
keep Iranian dissidents out of these universities.
In the past year, SAVAK agents have repeatedly cropped up on
college campuses. At Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore ear
lier this year, members of the Iranian Students Association (ISA)
who were protesting Hopkins' conferral of an honorary degree
upon the Shah's sister were quickly whisked away and brutalized
by SAVAK agents posing a.s news reporters. While Baltimore City
Police carried out the actual arrests, SAVAK was given free reign by
the university to patrol the proceedings.
Next Vietnam
The ISA believes the United States' key involvement in the
internal affairs of Iran will trigger the next Vietnam. The suddenly
oil-rich nation, which Amnesty International says has "the worst
record of human rights in the world." currently hosts 25,000 U.S.
military advisers, a number which is expected to climb past 80,000
in the next few years. The U.S. has also sold billions of dollars of
arms to the Shah's tyrannical government, making Iran "unable to
wage war without the assistance of the U. 5.," according to a Senate
finding.
"If Iran becomes another Vietnam, we can be sure that it was the
inhumane and irresponsible policies of the U.S. government, and
the excessive greed of American arms corporations that led to the
crisis," asserted Baraheni.
The ISA reports that the murder of three Americans in Teheran
last August was no freak slaying. The men were working for
Rockwell International on a multi-million dollar surveillance unit
designed to facilitate U.S. espionage in the Persian Gulf, as well as
detect dissidents in Iran.
"The revolutionary execution of these U.S. agents is a clear
example of the growing intensity of the Iranian peoples' struggle
against foreign interference," exhorted a national ISA release.
U.S. officials are keeping mum about the infiltration of foreign
police agencies in this country and are discouraging inquiries into
alleged illegal activities. Atherton claims that sensitive diplomatic
relations could be harmed by too much probing.
But as was shown by the recent death of Orlando Letelier, the
former Chilean ambassador who was knocked off by DINA, Chile's
secret police, there iron-hand agencies aren't just watching their
country's self-exiles.
So pay heed to that sunglassed man in the dark, ill-fitting busi
ness suit standing for hours by the campus pub. He may be some
rattling eccentric, but remember, the evil eye of SAVAK knows no
limits.

has sent SAVAK, Iranian police, to seek them
out.
