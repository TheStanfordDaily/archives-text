## Meet Taiwan Cagers open season 
### Chris Baker 
It's Big Game week.
So what.
Stanford fans will get their first look at the
1976-77 edition of the Cardinal basketball squad
when Stanford hosts Taiwan in an international
cage contest in Maples Pavilion tomorrow night at
8.
Card coach Dick Dißiaso guided Stanford to a
9-18 mark in his first season on the Farm last year.
He won Pacific-8 co-Coach of the Year honors.
Dißiaso said Stanford is approaching this con
test, nine days before its intercollegiate opener
against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo Nov. 27, the
same way the Cards prepared their international
exhibition against Australia last season.
'Learning experience'
"It's a chance to play against different people
and in front of a crowd. It should be a learning
experience," said Dißiaso.
Stanford will be playing against the Taiwan
national cage squad which was ousted from the
Summer Olympics. The tallest player on the
squad is 6-foot-4 center Fang Tien-kang.
Monday night Denver University crushed the
Chinese 108-62, despite a 28-point performance
by guard Hung Chun-Che (5-9). He is a 25-year
old serviceman of the Chinese Marine Corps.
Returning starters
Two Card starters — forward Ed Schweitzer, the
team's leading scorer and center Tim Patterson —
have graduated. But Dißiaso will welcome back
three starters — forward George Schader (6-7,
220), senior guard Mike Bratz and sophomore

guard Wolfe Perry.
Three top reserves from last year — junior
swi ngman Jay Carter, forward-center JeffMcHugh
and sophomore guard Paul Giovacchini — should
give Stanford better depth than last year.
Dißiaso and assistants Bob Frederick and Tom
McLaughlin conducted a nationwide talent
search and found a trio of recruits. Forward Kim
berly Belton (6-7), center Tom Schmalzried and
guard Doug Barnes should provide fans with
some excitement over the next four years.
Front line
Tomorrow night the Cards figure to open with a
front line of Schader, Belton and McHugh. Bratz
and Perry will start in the backcourt.
Carter and Giovacchini, who is coming back
from a knee injury suffered in mid-season last
year, will be the first two men off the bench.
"I think we're better at this point of the season
than we were last year," said Dißiaso.
Schader averaged 13.7 points and seven re
bounds per game, despite being hampered by a
sprained Achilles tendon.
Field general
Bratz, who quarterbacked the Cards last year,
averaged 12.1 points and 4.8 assists last year. The
senior guard and Schader have been elected co
captains by their teammates.
Perry, one of four freshmen to start in the Pac-8,
averaged 8.8 on the seasonand 11.8 after breaking
into the starting lineup.
Belton, described by Dißiaso as "The best prep
player in New York last year," averaged 20 points
and 17 rebounds per contest.
