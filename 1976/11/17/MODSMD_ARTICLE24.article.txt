# McColl, Hill NorCal Players of Year

### Paul Bauman 
The northern California foot
ball writers faced a bit of a di
lemma yesterday at their lunc
heon in Berkeley.
They had to pick a 1976 Nor-
Cal Offensive and Defensive
Player of the Year and Coach of
the Year from a group of teams
that have generally had rotten
seasons.
As Chester Caddas, head
coach at the University of the
Pacific, said when asked to give
his team's nominees, "Consider
ing the season we've had, I just
came here to order (lunch)."

The writers had little trouble
in tabbing Stanford's Tony Hill
for offensive honors, but picking
the defensive player and coach
posed some problems.
Tough decision
Choosing between San Jose
State's Wilson Faumina and
Duncan McColl of Stanford for
the defensive star proved to be as
tough as deciding whether to go
with the crab louie or the shrimp
louie. In the end, McColl edged
Faumina by one vote.
Hill and McColl were also
named this week to play in the
52nd Shrine East-West game at

Stanford Stadium, Sunday, Jan.
2.
Hill has caught more passes
for more yards and more
touchdowns than anyone in
Stanford history. This year, he is
tied for fifth in the Pacific-8 with
36 receptions, seven of them
touchdowns.
McColl is second on Stanford
in tackles, but has over twice as
many tackles for losses as any
other Card and three times as
many sacks.
Up for grabs
The Coach of the Year award
was totally up for grabs. Should
it have gone to San Jose State's
Lynn Stiles, who has led his
team to a 7-4 record and losses to
Stanford and California? Could
it have gone to Mike White of
California or the Cards' Jack
Christiansen, both with 5-5 re
cords? How about Vic Rowen at
San Francisco State? How about
the guy over at Gunn High? Any
good intramural coaches
arou nd ?
In reality, the writers looked
all the way up to UC-Davis for
their Coach of the Year, Jim
Sochor.
Cal kicker Jim Breech, who has
converted 21 of 22 extra points

and 15 of 22 field goals this sea
son, was named the Special
Teams Player of the Year. Mike
Michel of Stanford was second
in a field of two nominees.
After the balloting ended, at
tention centered on Christiansen
and White, whose teams will
meet in the 79th Big Game at
Berkeley Saturday.
Motivation
In one sense, Chris has less to
worry about against Cal than he
did when the Cards played Ore
gon last week. He won't, or
shouldn't have to, be concerned
about motivating his players.
"It's difficult to play Oregon
emotionally after USC and be
fore Cal," Chris said.
Stanford led 21-0 after the first
quarter in the Duck game, but
was outplayed by Oregon the
last three periods.
"We got a pretty good start and
then in the second quarter, I
looked around and saw some
card games and players talking
with friends," Chris said.
"People were already starting to
leave the stadium.
"We tell the players 'Oregon
can really hit,' and they say
'Yeah, we've heard that since
high school.' They turn you on

and off whenever they want to. 1
hope they're turned on this
week. Cal is an excellent team."
Christiansen said people tend
to take the Big Game very seri
ously, whether or not a bowl is at
stake.
"1 went to an alumni party
after the game two years ago
(when Stanford won) and 150
people were there," Chris said.
"Last year (when Stanford lost),
there were 40. That's how people
react." *
If the Cards lose Saturday, giv
ing them their first losing season
since 1963, Christiansen might
be tempted to skip this year's fes
tivities.
