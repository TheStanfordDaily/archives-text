# Angelo gains confidence, poloists gain Pac-8 crown
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Art Lambert called it right on
the nose.
Earlier this year, Lambert,
Stanford's head water polo
coach, said Tom Angelo didn't
have enough confidence until
around mid-season, when he
"came on like gangbusters."
Apparently so. The Cards are
now the 1976 Pacific-8 champ
ions and Angelo is a major
reason why. The sophomore,
along with Doug Burke, led
Stanford with four goals in the
Cards' title-winning 15-9 victory
over UCLA Saturday.
Lambert characterized Angelo
as "one hell of a person and one
hell of an athlete. He's the kind
of player a coach wishes he had
5000 of."

The coach summarized
Angelo's current play by stating
that the "light goes on, and Tom
is in a whole new world, de
monstrating efficient utilization
of all abilities and talents."
Rick Johannsen, a junior with
two years of experience on Card
teams, plays the role of two
meter man with Angelo feeding
the ball to him. He described
Angelo as "one of the quickest
drivers" and a "very strong mov
ing player for an inside man."
Angelo's aquatic career began
on the Santa Clara High School
swimming team. He specialized
in swimming until his senior
year, when he started to "turn on
to water polo."
Lambert, considered to be one
of the best water polo coaches in

the world, recruited Angelo for
the Cards. Angelo was offered
swimming scholarships by Ber
keley and USC, but preferred to
remain involved in water polo.
Big jump
As he begins his second year
on the squad, Angelo contrasted
high school and college compet
ition. He said that the college
game is "more brutal" and in
cludes a "higher caliber of
player." Angelo added that team
members are "a lot bigger," and
that there is more pressure to
make the No. 1 ranking.
Angelo said high school water
polo consisted of "relatively lit
tle coaching," and that there was
"a lot to learn" upon joining the
university team. Angelo believes
that Lambert has done "an excel
lent job."
Angelo hopes to continue
playing for another five years
with a goal of making a national
team, a feat which he believes is
possible for every member of the
team. Considering Stanford's in
ternationally recognized coach,
its strong and experienced nuc
leus of players and their desire to
excel. Angelo may be right.
