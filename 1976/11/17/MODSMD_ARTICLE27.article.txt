# Card safety adjusts to new role
## Siemens' career: a long four years 
### Jill Lieber 
Senior safety J eft Siemens'
football career at Stanford is a
riches to rags story.
Siemens has gone from a star
ter and game hero to a bench
warmer. He is one of 27 Stanford
players whose college careers
will end Saturday when the
Cards complete their season
against California.
Siemens was first recruited as
a quarterback out of high school,
where he was a standout player:
first team All-Orange County,
first team All-CIF, Orange
County back of the year, and a
member of the Shrine and
Orange County All-Star teams.
The Pacific-8 schools wanted
him. Harvard and Arizona State
recruited him. Even football
powerhouse Nebraska was in
terested.
A Westminster native,
Siemens decided that the added
travel expenses of going to
school out-of-state and playing
for a football "factory" like Neb
raska did not outweigh his need
for a quality college education.
Therefore, he chose Stanford to
mold his intellectual and physi
cal talents.
Former QB
In his freshman year, Siemens
led the Card frosh team to an un
defeated season and planned to
be a vital member of the varsity
squad as a QB his sophomore
year.
But before his soph year,

Siemens was dealt with the first
in a series of mental blows in his
Stanford football career. An
overabundance of quarterbacks
(six)and a minimal supplyof de
fensive backs brought about a
shift to safety. And what had
looked to be a productive year as
an offensive signal caller turned
into a dismal year spent on the
sidelines redshirting.
Siemens learned the safety
position well and the following
year (1974), he started in six var
sity games. He was one of the
heroes of Stanford's come
from-behind win over Cal in the
1974 Big Game. Siemens made a
key interception and also reco
vered a fumble to set up a Stan
ford touchdown and a 22-20 vic
tory over the Bears in the closing
moments of the game.
Time out
Siemens saw 159 minutes of
playing time in '74 and that was
almost cut in half the next year
when he played only 85 mi
nutes. Last season Siemens
started in the first two games,
Penn State and Michigan, and
after some "mistakes," he lost
his position to Gerald Wilson.
Ralph Phillips moved into the
No. 2 position behind Wilson
and then Rich Waters moved
from cornerback to strong safety
for the final three games.
And now this season,
Siemens' action has been limited
to "junk time" after the game's
outcome has been decided.
Through all the disappoint

ments, Siemens hasn't com
plained much, even to his close
friends.
"Jeff didn't really talk about
his frustrations until after the
Michigan game when we were
behind 51-0 and he still didn't
get in," said Mike Connor,
Siemens' roommate on road
trips and at Rickey's Hyatt House
when the Cards are at home. "I
really respect Jeff because he
doesn't let not playing on Satur
days bother him. He puts every
thing he has into practices even
though he knows he probably
won't get in the games."
Lack of speed
But all the enthusiasm and
dedication won't make up for
Siemens' lack of speed, which,
according to head coach Christ
iansen, is keeping Siemens from
starting. The fact is, Siemens is
almost a half a second slower in
the 40-yard dash than starting
safety Rich Waters.
Christiansen said, "We
evaluate all our players fairly. If
players are close ability-wise
and one player is faster than the
other, we play him. The faster
player in the defensive secon
dary can run down his mental
mistakes, but there is no way a
slow player can if he misses a
key. Not only is it embarrassing
to get outrun to the player him
self, but it is embarrassing and
detrimental to the rest of the
team."
Siemens devoted his training
last summer to increasing his

speed. "1 pushed myself as hard
as I could and I've just come to
realize that 1 was not built to be
fast. After a certain point there's
nothing I can do about it."
Less excitement
Inactivity hasn't caused
Siemens to lose his love for the
game, but it has diminished the
excitement and thrill he once
felt.
"The real excitement of foot
ball is being out on the field and I
don't care how enthusiastic a
guy you are, unless you're play
ing in a game, practices get old.
1 think that I'm an expert at how
to practice and how to 'rah' on
the sidelines. But it's been so
long since I've been out on the
field that I've forgotten what it's
like to be out there."
Another result of Siemens'
status demise on the team over
the years has been a reevaluation
of the importance of football.
"When I came here as a
freshman I set myself above
others because I was a football
player. I thought I was better
than everyone else. That was
such a high school kind of at
titude. Flaying football is a talent
just as art or music and it's no
greater."
"I have come to realize that
football is definitely not the most
important thing in life. Football
is going to come to an end and I
can enjoy it on Saturdays and
during practices, but there are so
many things in life that are more
important and long lasting."

Moment of glory

few opportunities to see the ball this year, much less touch it. John Pigott (24) is in the
