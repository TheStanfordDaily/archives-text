Argentine guerrillas storm police
Buenos Aires, Argentina — About 40 suspected
left-wing guerrillas stormed a police station near La
Plata before dawn yesterday and nine of them died
in the ensuing battle with police and army troops,
security sources said. Four policemen were re
ported wounded.
The reported assault, launched in the face of a
determined effort by the military government to
wipe out leftist guerrillas, indicates the guerrillas
are still far from liquidated.
The sources said the attackers drove in an auto
caravan to the station in the Arana community 30
miles south of Buenos Aires, shot and wounded
two police guards, then stormed inside. A dozen or
so men there held off the attackers until about 100
reinforcements arrived and killed nine suspected
guerrillas, they said. Two police were reported
wounded in the fighting inside. The surviving at
tackers fled.
The latest killings brought to 1252 the reported
death toll so far this year in Argentina's continuing
political violence.
Security officials say more than half of the dead
were suspected of being guerrillas of two extreme
leftist groups — the People's Revolutionary Army,
a Marxist band known by its Spanish initials ERP;
or the Montoneros, supporters of former strongman
Juan Peron, who died of a heart attack in 1974,
while president.
Datsun sued for price fixing
Miami — The importers of Datsun cars and
trucks are accused in a lawsuit here of trying to
prevent price-cutting and other competition bet
ween their dealers. The outcome could affect nearly
900,000 car owners throughout the country.
The lawsuit charges that Nissan Motor Corp.
USA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nissan Motor
Ltd. of Tokyo, tried to make dealers maintain profit
margins near or above those it set.
Burt Arkin, a Miami businessman, filed suit in
1974 after three Datsun dealers quoted him identi
cal prices on a 240Z, a Datsun sports car.
To determine what evidence will be allowed in
similar suits in 19 states, Arkin's action in U.S.
District Court has been consolidated with the other
suits. Four thousand Datsun buyers in Dade County
could be granted partial refunds if Arkin wins.
Because this is the first trial of the civil antitrust
suits against Nissan, the verdict will potentially
affect about 898,000 Datsun buyers. Most of those
who bought Datsuns between July 1968 and July

1972 are covered by the class action lawsuits, al
though only a few have sued.
Arkins' lawyers have shown the jury letters from
Datsun sales representatives that told superiors that
they had ordered or urged dealers to stop price
cutting or cancel advertisements which cited low
prices or which ran in papers close to other dealers.
But in a statement for the defense, Robert Link,
Nissan USA vice-president, said, "Nissan does not
enforce, affect or supervise the retail price at which
automobiles are sold."
Pilots, Continental settle strike
Los Angeles — Continental Airlines will resume
partial service today following settlement of the
23-day-old pilots strike.
A Continental spokesman said the airline would
resume flying today, but full service will not be
restored until next month. Continental normally
carries 21,000 passengers a day to 31 cities in the
Southwest, central states, and Hawaii.
A tentative settlement to the strike was an

nounced last week, but both sides have been work
ing on minor details since then. The settlement
terms have not been released. A major problem was
the back-to-work agreement detailing when and
how the pilots were to be recalled to work.
Ed Malone, a spokesman for the Airline Pilots
Association, said the large increase would only
bring the pilots back into line with pay scales in the
rest of the industry. The pilots had contended they
were paid less than pilots for other airlines.
Continental pilots currently earn from $27,950 to
$58,000 a year.
Mental hospital abuses revealed
Sacramento — More than 50 state mental hospi
tal employes have been fired in the last two years
for offenses ranging from kidnaping and robbing a
patient to cutting down trees, state records show.
The deaths of two patients at Metropolitan State
Hospital in Norwalk are under investigation by
local homicide detectives, and the state is looking
into reports of staff members threatening other staff
to coverup abuses.
At Camarillo State Hospital, the Ventura County
Grand Jury is investigating 55 patient deaths.
Not all patient abuses result in dismissals. At
Sonoma, a psychiatric technician would up with a
nine work-day suspension for sexually abusing a
patient. No details of the case were provided.
At Patton State Hospital, "unnecessary rough
ness" of a patient by a psychiatric technician
brought a 10-day suspension.
Psychiatric patients deliver baby
Napa — Mother and baby were healthy, and the
midwives were happy. But embarrassed state men
tal hospital officials were trying to determine yes
terday why four patients — and not staff members
— delivered another patient's baby in the acute
psychiatric ward.
"We're taking it very seriously," said Dwayne
DeLong, assistant to the medical director at Napa
State Hospital. "We run a clean hospital and when
there's a breakdown like this, it makes us look bad.
"One of the patients is very elated that he deli
vered the baby," DeLong said. "It's not often that
you have a chance like that in a mental hospital."
Today's weather
Low overcast and local dense fog mornings but
mostly sunny afternoons through tomorrow. Little
temperature change. Lows tonight in the mid 40s to
mid 50s. Highs both days in the 60s to low 70s.
