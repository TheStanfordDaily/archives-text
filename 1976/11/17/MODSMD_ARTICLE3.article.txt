# Quebecois' success due to social platform
## 
### Steve Sulmeyer Staff writer 
The success of the Parti Quebecois
in Quebec's provincial elections Mon
day was due more to its social platform
than its separatist proposals, accord
ing to Francois Beaulne, a professor at
Columbia University and the Univer
sity of Ottawa.
Speaking at Bechtel International
Center yesterday to an audience of 75
persons, Beaulne said that the citizens
of Quebec have been worried by ram
pant strikes, high unemployment, in
flation and alleged corruption in the
government of liberal party leader
Robert Bourassa.
Although the Parti Quebecois re
ceived 43 per cent of the popular vote,
only 17 per cent of the voters actually
support Quebec's secession from
Canada, Beaulne said.
With everything seemingly going
against him, Bourassa called for elec
tions last month, two years before his
five-year term would have ended. He
claimed he needed a mandate of sup
port from the people, even though he
had won 102 of 110 seats in the last
election in 1973,
Need for a mandate
Beaulne speculated that the liberals
wanted to silence the allegations of
corruption and were worried that the
economic stagnation could have

forced them to raise taxes later. Thus,
the liberals decided to stage an elec
tion now.
Parti Quebecois leader Rene Leves
que promised a referendum on seces
sion within two years. If the measure
were defeated, however. Levesque
said his government would not resign,
but continue to carry out its other
promises of reform, Beaulne said.
Some Canadians have voiced con
cern that if Quebec is allowed to se
cede, the nation would disintegrate
and all of Canada would be absorbed
by the U.S.
Historic trends
Beaulne said he does not foresee
total independence for Quebec in the
near future, if at all. The cautious lead
ers of the Parti Quebecois felt that the
influence of the American multi
national corporations could make an
independent Quebec a "banana repub
lic," he said.
Beaulne sees a revised constitiution,
a looser political association and an
organization similar to the European
Common Market as forces uniting the
Canadian provinces in the near future.
Canada does not face anarchy or a
Civil War. but is merely following a
trend which has existed for some time,
Beaulne explained.
