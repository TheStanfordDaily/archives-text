# SCLC holds hearings on honor code's future
## 
### Mike Charlson Staff writer 
Students and faculty will have an
opportunity to air their views on the
honor code, its effectiveness and po
tential changes in its structure during
two open hearings of the Student Con
duct Legislative Council (SCLC) to
night and Tuesday night.
Both meetings will be at 7:30 in the
Meyer Library Forum Room.
The SCLC is considering changing
the honor code because of its alleged
ineffectiveness as a deterrent to cheat
ing. However, the council wanted
input from the Stanford community
before making any decisions, accord
ing to SCLC Chairman Philip Rhine
lander.
SCLC. members said they hope to
hear testimony from concerned stu
dents and faculty on questions of
whether or not the honor code should
be retained in its present form. If
changes are recommended, the coun
cil hopes to discuss how to implement
the changes, Rhidelander said.
According to an SCLC announce
ment, the council will also consider
ways of encouraging compliance with
the code if it were not altered.
The hearings are to supplement in
formation from a survey by the SCLC of
faculty and students last spring on the
honor code.
The survey was performed at the re
quest of President Richard Lyman and
the ASSU Council of Presidents.
Among the findings of the survey, it
was noted that some 26 per cent of the
faculty favored alteration or abolish
ment of the honor code with another
16 per cent listing no opinion. Only 15
per cent of the faculty strongly favored
the present system with 43 per cent
calling it "a good idea."
"My impression is that we would all
like to keep the honor code in its pre
sent form if this can be done," Rhine
lander said. "As I see it, one of the
main problems is in the area of en
forcement."
He mentioned that problems arise
particularly with the provision of the
code which binds students to report
students who cheat during tests. The

chairman noted that the provision was
originally a student innovation.
Paradoxically. Rhidelander noted,
"If there is cheating, the people who
suffer is not the faculty but honorable
students."
He said the committee would con
sider removal of this portion of the
code, but that this action would re
quire a number of other alterations as
well, were it to be approved.
