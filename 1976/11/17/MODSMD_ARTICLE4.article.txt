# Hospital wing costs underestimated; University seeks construction rebate
## 
### Bill Snyder Staff writer 
The university is claiming back
charges from the architectural firm
which designed the new Stanford
University Hospital wing for costs in
curred from code violations, construc
tion delays, inaccurate cost estimates
and design errors, according to a staff
counsel to vice president for business
and finance Robert Augsburger.
In an interview last week, Cassius
Kirk declined to say how much the
university is claiming, although he
said, "We claim more than we expect
to recover."
The university has claimed a final
construciton cost for the wing of
$13,351,215, which is $130,000 more
than the architect's estimate, accord
ing to Harry Patterson, general counsel
for the Houston-based architectural
firm of Caudill, Rowlett and Scott.
Kirk said that the university met
with the architects and their attorney
on October 21, but that no agreement

was reached.
"We'll probably commence an arbit
ration with the architects to determine
how much, if any, they should pay,"
he said. "The parties could agree to go
to court."
Kirk said that the university will de
cide what action to take "within the
next several weeks."
Stanford claim denied
"We're denying all claims," said
Patterson. "We contend that Stanford
substantially has a $12.6 million
building. They've got their money's
worth."
The original construction project
cost arrived at by the architect and
university staff was $9.1 million. That
figure was raised to $12.6 million in
1974 to cover the additional costs re
quired to meet the provisions of the ear
thquake safety act, Senate Bill 519.
The bill, which became law in
November 1972, requires that hospi
tals "shall be designed and con
structed to resist...the forces generated

by earthquakes, gravity, and wind."
The final construction cost should
not exceed $13,230,000 even with
code compliance, according to the
university Planning Office.
Delayed opening
Because of construction delays, the
project, which originally was to be
completed in May 1975, may not be
ready to accept patients until February
or March 1977.
Philip Williams, director of plan
ning, expects basic construction, with
the exception of some minor clean-up
items, to be completed by December 1.
Placement of equipment and other
work done by hospital staff to prepare
the wing for occupancy will probably
take 60 to 90 days after that, he said.
The university contends that sub
stantial delay resulted from code viola
tions discovered by state and local in
spectors in both the design and con
struction phases of the project. "The
architect is responsible for meeting the
code," said Williams.
Earthquake-proofing unavoidable
But, with regards to Senate Bill 519,
code violations were unavoidable, ac
cording to Patterson. "All the
guidelines and building requirements
came later, during the construction of
the building," he said. As a result,
numerous changes had to be made in
the design as the building progressed,
he added.
According to Bob Presley, construc
tion manager of the project, the struc
tural documents were complete and
the job had gone to bid two months
before the State Department of Ar
chitecture and Construction estab
lished code compliance criteria in
September 1973.
"We had contracts, we were about to
start work...and that's the point that
the drawings were called back for re
view," he said. "We lost several

months here while the structural
drawings were being redesigned."
Then in April 1976, inspections by
the Department of Health and state and
local fire marshalls revealed numerous
code violations in the building's con
struction. These ranged from in-'
adequacies in the fire alarm system to
insufficient clearance between toilet
fixtures.
Code compliance work extended


Over budget
The new wing on the hospital should be completely finished by Dec. 1,
according to university officials, and the architectural firm which designed

construction until late October 1976
and cost an estimated $640,000 ac
cording to the Planning Office.
University officials feel that the ar
chitects failed to anticipate the re
quirements of the Senate Bill 519
when they designed the wing and as a
result they underestimated the cost of
construction. "They misled Stanford,"
said Kirk.
"My belief is that there are no codes
enacted in any state including Califor
nia that are not discussed in the pro
fessional trade associations," said
James McNally, hospital director of
facilities. "The information is gener
ally available. Itshould have been re
flected in (the wing's) design."
