# Court denies Land group 'stay' request

### Marc Strassman 
The homes of approximately 50 re
sidents of The Land are one step closer
to the bulldozer after a Santa Clara
Superior Court yesterday denied the
residents' motion to nullify an earlier
order authorizing the demolition of
the houses.
Judge Peter Anello also removed
and dissolved the stay order that has
up until now prevented the demolition
of the houses.
Anello said that he was deciding the
case on the basis of whether the build
ings were in violation of the Palo Alto
Municipal Code titles dealing with
fire, building, housing and zoning vio
lations and whether the structures
"constitute a public health hazard to
the residents of the property as well as
the general public."
Violation
Anello said according to evidence
presented on June 7, 1974, the build
ings were shown lacking sewage dis
posal systems. "In lieu thereof they
have open pit privies in the ground.
All of this is in violation of state and
local health codes," Anello wrote.
The judge continued, "These viola
tions can create a serious public health
hazard in that said raw sewage can eas
ily cause contaminated water and food
supplies which in turn can result in
typhoid fever, cholera, shigellosis,
amoebic dysentery, hepatitis and other
parasitic infections. It is well known
that these diseases could spread
beyond the confines of the subject
property if any infected intervener
mingles with the general public."
Anello also said that drinking water
had not been able to meet United
States Health Services Drinking Water
Standards.
Landowner's responsibility
The judge ruled that the status of the
residents as tenants or trespassers was
irrelevant to the case and wrote that
landowner Alyce Burns, who brought
the original suit against the City of
. Palo Alto "is required by law to abate
any and all public nuisances and pub
lic health hazards that may exist on her
property."
Anello rejected the argument of the
