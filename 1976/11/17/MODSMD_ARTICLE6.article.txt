# Mozambique reports Rhodesian aggression
## 
### 
Dares Salaam, Tanzania (AP) —
Mozambique claimed yesterday that
guerilla-hunting Rhodesian forces
using jets, bombers and helicopters
had crossed the border and attacked an
army base. There was no comment on
the report from Rhodesian officials.
Rhodesia has acknowledged making
at least three previous raids across the
border to attack the camps of black
nationalist guerrillas who are fighting
to topple the white minority regime in
Salisbury. Mozambique, along with
several other black African nations,
provide refuge and aid to the guerril
las.
A communique from the Mozam
bique Information Agency (AIM) is
sued here said the attack on the base
near the Rhodesian border began last
Thursday. The agency said the Rhode
sians quickly occupied the base, but
that fighting continued until Monday,
when the government last received a
report from the area.
AIM said that "a total of 20 aircraft
took part, attacking from four direc
tions.

"After prolonged bombing the
enemy dropped paratroopers and
heliborne troops, some of whom were
hit in the air by the Mozambican
People's Liberation Forces," the
agency said. It claimed seven Rhode
sian planes were shot down.
"After four hours of fighting the
forces of the racist regime of lan Smith
occupied the camp at Mavue," the re
port said. Mavue was not listed on
maps of Mozambique, but a town
named Mogue was shown on the Zam
bezi River in northern Mozambique,
about 25 miles north of the Rhodesian
border.
Last August, Rhodesia staged a
major helicopter assault on a camp
three miles inside Mozambique.
Rhodesia claimed it killed 300 guerril
las, 30 Mozambican soldiers and 10
civilians in that attack.
Rhodesian and Mozambican forces
have traded artillery and small arms
fire across the border and Salisbury
claims regular Mozambique army sol
diers have laid mines several hundred
yards inside Rhodesia.
