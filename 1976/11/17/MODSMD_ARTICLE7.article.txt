"If a man, woman, or child dies be
cause we withhold food or technology
or because we consume more re
sources than we ought, is not that life
our responsibility?"
-Vern Preheim
Each of us is condemned to the free
dom to choose how much time and
energy we will devote toward reduc
ing the agony of other humans.
Furthermore, anyone refusing to act
upon his/her convictions because of
the remoteness of mankind's afflic
tions from everyday life is acting in
bad faith, and is leading a hypocritical
existence.
For those of us who feel that the re
duction of human misery is an impor
tant goal, there can be no hiding be
hind the pretense that our efforts are so
negligible as to be meaningless.
Among the worldwide sources of
human misery, including political and
religious injustice and oppression,
and war, the most severe by far is that
of hunger. The inability of diverse
peoples to fulfill their basic biological
need results in greater pain and in a
greater deterioration of human poten
tials and enthusiasms than any other
problem we should seek to solve.
No argument
There can be no argument over the
magnitude of the statistics of hunger.
An average Asian consumes 2100
calories per day while an adequate
daily requirement would be about
2800. Meanwhile, the average North
American consumes about 3100
calories per day.
From these averages, it can be
clearly deduced that the majority of
the people of underdeveloped nations
exist somewhere between slight un
dernourishment and death from star
vation.
Understanding the nature of hunger
and its roots are crucial for attempts at
solution, but academic quibbling over
the precise numbers (which will never
be known) is pointless since all of our
individual efforts are not likely to
overshoot the problem.

At all costs, we must not let our
political/ideological belief/goals oc
cupy a more primary place in our ef
forts than our more fundamental moral
concerns. Reactionaries and radicals,
capitalists and Marxists must all
surely see that a reduction in human
misery can be most directly affected by
encouraging development and in
creasing the standards of living of
those peoples who, through their full
efforts, can barely survive.
Whether or not we favor revamping
the political systems in other countries
or our own, or whether we recognize
the pressing urgency for a new
economic order, there are vastly more
effective efforts which we can pursue
right now. Sending economic or
technological aid to needy areas is the
premise of innumerable organizations
such as OxFam-America, CROP, UN
ICEF, and others which stress self-help
methods of aid.
Economic aid
Perhaps sending guns abroad is a
solution, perhaps sending bulk food is
a solution, but both are debatable.
There is no valid argument, however,
against sending economic aid, with no
strings attached, for the purpose of
providing the low level technology
necessary for people to provide for
themselves.
In principle, every American has the
immediate ability to provide, through
their own economic sacrifice, the
means of survival and happiness for
perhaps dozens of workers in, say, In
dia, who earn less in a year than an
average American earns in an eight
hour day.
To say that the money would never
get where it is needed is to deny the
opportunity each of us has to investi
gate all of the various organizations
which do exist and which do reflect a
variety of strategies.
Underfed will increase
The feeling of helplessness is the
most important misconception which
I wish to dispel here. In the course of
our lifetimes, it's true, the number of

underfed will increase by a nu r
the order of magnitude of billi
Nevertheless, the results of our.
vidual efforts do exist. It is a mistake to
believe that because our energies are
incremental they then have no mean
ing.
Therefore, the enormity of the suf
fering in underdeveloped countries
and the bleakness of the future for
these same areas do not justify our
turning our backs on the marginal few
each of us, with our marginal energies,
can help.
After the fast is over, the panel dis
cussion has ended, and the donation
booths have left White Plaza, most of
us will forget about those other people
who need out help. It's especially easy
since we are surrounded by people
who also forget.
Please don't forget.
