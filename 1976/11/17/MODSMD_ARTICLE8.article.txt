# 'Bakke' affirmative action ruling just

R. Hunter Summers

Henry Organ's vitriolic attack
(Daily, Nov. 8) on the recent California
Supreme Court decision (Bakke v.
Board of Regents] outlawing minority
quotas in professional school admis
sions deserves considerable comment
which it will no doubt receive.
As those who have no reasoned ar
guments are wont to do, Organ begins
his article with an ad hominem attack
on those who question the constitu
tionality of preferential admissions
policies based upon race.
He asserts that a person such as
Bakke who files suit challenging a
minority admissions program should
be ashamed because the only way he
was able to get into professional school
was by attacking the School's use of
minority quotas.

But what of those minority group
members who owe their admissions to
a quota system? To what may they
point with pride? Bakke has his
academic qualifications to stand upon;
some of those admitted under a quota
system have only their race.
In fact, implicit in every minority
admissions policy like that adminis
tered by the University of Californa is
the assumption that the minority
applicants would not have been ac
cepted but for the use of quotas, and
this assumption does a tremendous in
justice to minority group members.
As Justice Douglas aptly pointed
out in his dissent in De Funis v.
Odegarrd, "A segregated admissions
process creates suggestions of stigma
and caste. . . and in the end it may

produce that result despite its contrary
intentions."
Not proscribed
Organ proceeds to equate preferen
tial admissions polices based upon
race with those based upon athletic
ability, relation to a faculty member
and age. While the wisdom of these
latter policies may be questioned, one
thing is clear: they are not constitu
tionally proscribed.
Nonetheless, Organ asks why such
policies have not been opposed with
equal ardor by those who attack
minority admissions programs. He
answers his own question by inferring
that those who question the legality of
racially based admissions are moti
vated by racism.
It is an interesting turn of events

when those who demand that race be
considered are not.
Lack of understanding
Organ's comments on the role of the
judicial system display a singular lack
of understanding of what the fcourts
have done in this area and, indeed, a
lack of understanding of the constitu
tional values underlying the deci
sions.
Organ contrasts the slow progress of
the courts in outlawing segregation in
public schools with the supposedly
rapid condemnation of reverse dis
crimination.
What he fails to understand is that
decisions such as Bakke rest on the
same principles that underlie deci
sions such as Brown v. Board of Educa
tion. Bakke builds upon that which
went before.
To say that reverse discrimination is
a new problem that was handled
quickly is absurd. The problem is ra
cial discrimination and it has been
with us for too long.
No separation
The problem of racial discrimina
tion in favor of minority gorups cannot
be analyzed separately from the prob
lem of racial discrimination against
minority groups. The Fourteenth
Amendment's equal protection clause
applies to both; this is what the
California Supreme Court held in
Bnkke.
The tenor of Organ's article suggests
he would rewrite the equal protection
clause to read, "nor shall any State . . .
deny to any minority person . . . the
equal protection of the laws." Fortu
nately, Organ is not a jurist.
The protections afforded us by the
equal protection clause are not depen
dent upon considerations such as race.
The California court's decision in
Bakke demonstrates the accuracy of
Justice Harlan's statement in Plessy v.
Ferguson, "Our Constitution is color
blind. . . ."

Nonetheless, Organ asks why such
policies have not been opposed with
equal ardor by those who attack
minority admissions programs. He
answers his own question by inferring
that those who question the legality of
racially based admissions are moti
vated by racism.
It is an interesting turn of events

when those who demand that race be
considered are not.
Lack of understanding
Organ's comments on the role of the
judicial system display a singular lack
of understanding of what the fcourts
have done in this area and, indeed, a
lack of understanding of the constitu
tional values underlying the deci
sions.
Organ contrasts the slow progress of
the courts in outlawing segregation in
public schools with the supposedly
rapid condemnation of reverse dis
crimination.
What he fails to understand is that
decisions such as Bakke rest on the
same principles that underlie deci
sions such as Brown v. Board of Educa
tion. Bakke builds upon that which
went before.
To say that reverse discrimination is
a new problem that was handled
quickly is absurd. The problem is ra
cial discrimination and it has been
with us for too long.
No separation
The problem of racial discrimina
tion in favor of minority gorups cannot
be analyzed separately from the prob
lem of racial discrimination against
minority groups. The Fourteenth
Amendment's equal protection clause
applies to both; this is what the
California Supreme Court held in
Bnkke.
The tenor of Organ's article suggests
he would rewrite the equal protection
clause to read, "nor shall any State . . .
deny to any minority person . . . the
equal protection of the laws." Fortu
nately, Organ is not a jurist.
The protections afforded us by the
equal protection clause are not depen
dent upon considerations such as race.
The California court's decision in
Bakke demonstrates the accuracy of
Justice Harlan's statement in Plessy v.
Ferguson, "Our Constitution is color
blind. . . ."

Henry Organ's vitriolic attack
(Daily, Nov. 8) on the recent California
Supreme Court decision (Bakke v.
Board of Regents] outlawing minority
quotas in professional school admis
sions deserves considerable comment
which it will no doubt receive.
As those who have no reasoned ar
guments are wont to do, Organ begins
his article with an ad hominem attack
on those who question the constitu
tionality of preferential admissions
policies based upon race.
He asserts that a person such as
Bakke who files suit challenging a
minority admissions program should
be ashamed because the only way he
was able to get into professional school
was by attacking the School's use of
minority quotas.

But what of those minority group
members who owe their admissions to
a quota system? To what may they
point with pride? Bakke has his
academic qualifications to stand upon;
some of those admitted under a quota
system have only their race.
In fact, implicit in every minority
admissions policy like that adminis
tered by the University of Californa is
the assumption that the minority
applicants would not have been ac
cepted but for the use of quotas, and
this assumption does a tremendous in
justice to minority group members.
As Justice Douglas aptly pointed
out in his dissent in De Funis v.
Odegarrd, "A segregated admissions
process creates suggestions of stigma
and caste. . . and in the end it may

produce that result despite its contrary
intentions."
Not proscribed
Organ proceeds to equate preferen
tial admissions polices based upon
race with those based upon athletic
ability, relation to a faculty member
and age. While the wisdom of these
latter policies may be questioned, one
thing is clear: they are not constitu
tionally proscribed.
Nonetheless, Organ asks why such
policies have not been opposed with
equal ardor by those who attack
minority admissions programs. He
answers his own question by inferring
that those who question the legality of
