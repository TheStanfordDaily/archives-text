# Titles can be important

As all we real-world-bound seniors
are discovering, job hunting is a very
scary process. Probably the most ter
rifying aspect is seeing the last four
years of your life reduced to two sheets
of paper: your resume and your trans
cript.
Looking at those two neat lists, you
begin to realize that prospective
employers are not really evaluating
what you've learned; they simply are
reading a list of titles.
They have no way of knowing that
the course with the impressive title
and good grade was a mick course that
was so worthless you skipped it half
the time. They have no way of know
ing that under the humble title
"Frycook, Summer, 1974" lies hard
gained knowledge about management,
personnel, and withstanding tedium
(along with the best three-minute
hamburger in the business).
However, the university environ
ment fortunately offers a respite from
that bureaucratic love of titles one will
face in the real world. After all, a uni
versity's aim is to foster individual in
itiative and individual accomplish
ment — not merely couple the proper
titles.
Or is it?
Alas. no. Bureaucracy lives on even
in this supposed bastion of indi
vidualism. You can get education here
that will satisfy you, but it had better
satisfy those titles too. If you want to
learn something that lacks the approp
riate title, v<>u will have to do it on your

own time and for your own satisfac
tion.
1 discovered this to my chagrin
when I was prevented from graduating
this quarter because I lacked the one
course needed to fulfill my history
major. I am taking a course that would
have fulfilled the requirement — if the
course had had the proper title of "His
tory Department Course" or had a
"History Department Professor."
In my case, while one of the instruc
tors was a fifth year senior student, the
other had taught history at a graduate
and undergraduate level (at two other
colleges) for six years. Interestingly,
after I pointed out these facts, the de
partment changed its policy and al
lowed outside courses not taught by a
History Department professor to be
considered for history credit if they
were sponsored by a professor in the
department.
Unfortunately, the new policy also
said that such outside courses had to
be submitted for consideration a quar
ter in advance. Thus the policy did not
apply to my particular case.
Eventually, I discovered that the
course had been sponsored all along
by a History Department professor. Al
though the new policy was not retroac
tive. I thought I could at least persuade
the department that the outside course
would be sufficiently validated and
deserving of an official history title if I
wrote an extra paper for the sponsor
ing History Department prof.
No such luck. Such a private ar

rangement falls under the title of "Di
rected Reading," which by Depart
ment policy, cannot meet a history
major requirement.
So, after four weeks of bureaucratic
battling, I did not get history credit and
thus could not get the official title of
"graduate" that would have enabled
me to go on a half-tuition basis next
quarter.
It does not matter that I will have to
shell out $800 more to get a history
course next quarter with the proper ti
tle. It does not matter that I am in
terested in Mideastern history, while
the sole course offered in that area
happens to fall outside the History De
partment.
It does not matter that, in a similar
case involving southern African his
tory, I again found the only course of
fered was outside the department and
for that reason I again did not get his
tory credit.
No, as far as the university and the
History Department are concerned, it
really does not matter what I feel I
should learn or how well I learn it. It
only matters that my courses have offi
cially validated titles, so that I can get
an officially validated title of "Stan
ford graduate".
I just hope the title will have some
meaning.

It does not matter that I will have to
shell out $800 more to get a history
course next quarter with the proper ti
tle. It does not matter that I am in
terested in Mideastern history, while
the sole course offered in that area
happens to fall outside the History De
partment.
It does not matter that, in a similar
case involving southern African his
tory, I again found the only course of
fered was outside the department and
for that reason I again did not get his
tory credit.
No, as far as the university and the
History Department are concerned, it
really does not matter what I feel I
should learn or how well I learn it. It
only matters that my courses have offi
cially validated titles, so that I can get
an officially validated title of "Stan
ford graduate".
I just hope the title will have some
meaning.

As all we real-world-bound seniors
are discovering, job hunting is a very
scary process. Probably the most ter
rifying aspect is seeing the last four
years of your life reduced to two sheets
of paper: your resume and your trans
cript.
Looking at those two neat lists, you
begin to realize that prospective
employers are not really evaluating
what you've learned; they simply are
reading a list of titles.
They have no way of knowing that
the course with the impressive title
and good grade was a mick course that
was so worthless you skipped it half
the time. They have no way of know
ing that under the humble title
"Frycook, Summer, 1974" lies hard
gained knowledge about management,
personnel, and withstanding tedium
(along with the best three-minute
hamburger in the business).
However, the university environ
ment fortunately offers a respite from
that bureaucratic love of titles one will
face in the real world. After all, a uni
versity's aim is to foster individual in
itiative and individual accomplish
ment — not merely couple the proper
titles.
Or is it?
Alas. no. Bureaucracy lives on even
in this supposed bastion of indi
vidualism. You can get education here
that will satisfy you, but it had better
satisfy those titles too. If you want to
learn something that lacks the approp
riate title, v<>u will have to do it on your

own time and for your own satisfac
tion.
1 discovered this to my chagrin
when I was prevented from graduating
this quarter because I lacked the one
course needed to fulfill my history
major. I am taking a course that would
have fulfilled the requirement — if the
course had had the proper title of "His
tory Department Course" or had a
"History Department Professor."
In my case, while one of the instruc
tors was a fifth year senior student, the
other had taught history at a graduate
and undergraduate level (at two other
colleges) for six years. Interestingly,
after I pointed out these facts, the de
partment changed its policy and al
lowed outside courses not taught by a
History Department professor to be
considered for history credit if they
were sponsored by a professor in the
department.
Unfortunately, the new policy also
said that such outside courses had to
be submitted for consideration a quar
ter in advance. Thus the policy did not
apply to my particular case.
Eventually, I discovered that the
course had been sponsored all along
by a History Department professor. Al
though the new policy was not retroac
tive. I thought I could at least persuade
the department that the outside course
would be sufficiently validated and
deserving of an official history title if I
wrote an extra paper for the sponsor
ing History Department prof.
No such luck. Such a private ar

rangement falls under the title of "Di
rected Reading," which by Depart
ment policy, cannot meet a history
major requirement.
So, after four weeks of bureaucratic
battling, I did not get history credit and
thus could not get the official title of
"graduate" that would have enabled
me to go on a half-tuition basis next
quarter.
