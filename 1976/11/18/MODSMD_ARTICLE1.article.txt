# Food Day raises more than $2500
## 
### Louise Anderson 
Speakers and skits were the order for
the day and students here raised more
than $2500 as part of yesterday's Stan
ford Day of Fasting.
According to Food Service Manager
Maxine Anderson, 1247 students
turned in their meal cards, raising
$2628.80 The donations, collected
from food service rebates, will be dis
tributed to various local and interna
tional hunger relief organizations by
the Stanford Committee on Hunger
and the Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC), co-sponsors of the activity.
The Food Service is "interested in
the world food shortage and we think
the efforts of the students to solve this
problem are tremendous," said Ander
son, who indicated that a check will be
made out by the Food Service to the
Stanford Committee on Hunger today.
ARC member David Hawes gave the
opening speech at the noon rally in
White Plaza.
Fasting not the solution
"I think that it's very important that
students be aware that there are hun
gry people around the world including
in the United States," he said. "But it
(being aware) isn't enough. Conserva
tives and cynics are right on this point.
We don't accomplish much by not eat
ing for one day in terms of actually

putting a lot of food into the mouths of
people of the third world."
Hawes emphasized that the purpose
of the fast was to accomplish
consciousness-raising.
"But we must go beyond, searching
tor reasons why people are hungry,
why there isn't enough to eat in the
world and what we need to do to bring
(about change)," he said.
The Stanford Political Players
(Guerrilla Theater) enacted vignettes
among the crowd to dramatize the
hunger crisis.
One actor in tattered clothes sat on
the ground with a fork and empty plate
and proceeded to eat as a thoughtful
crowd of about 70 persons looked on.
Food and politics
Political Science Prof. Charles
Drekmeier spoke on the economics of
hunger in the world.
"The National Security Council has
insisted that about half of the billion
dollars' worth of food that is shipped
abroad under the Food for Peace prog
ram would go to bolster the military
strength of our friends such as Cam
bodia and South Vietnam," Drekmeier
said.
"Lon Nol in Cambodia was given
permission to use 83 per cent of the
proceeds of this food for what was de
scribed as 'the common defense' for
internal security," he said. "TheThieu
regime in South Korea was able to
spend 100 per cent of its proceeds on
military buildup."
Monopolies
Drekmeier described the world food
situation as "somewhat comparable to
the problem of the near monopolies of
oil. The six local grain giants have a
position comparable to the so-called
'Seven Sisters,' the huge petroleum
companies."
"Most of them operate anonymously
because they are not directly involved
in the market but work indirectly." he
said.
"With the exception of disaster and
famine relief, the United States does
not now have and never has had a food
aid policy built around the needy
people of the world and the nature of
those needs." Drekmeier said.

students be aware that there are hun
gry people around the world including
in the United States," he said. "But it
(being aware) isn't enough. Conserva
tives and cynics are right on this point.
We don't accomplish much by not eat
ing for one day in terms of actually

putting a lot of food into the mouths of
people of the third world."
Hawes emphasized that the purpose
of the fast was to accomplish
consciousness-raising.
"But we must go beyond, searching
tor reasons why people are hungry,
why there isn't enough to eat in the
world and what we need to do to bring
(about change)," he said.
The Stanford Political Players
(Guerrilla Theater) enacted vignettes
among the crowd to dramatize the
hunger crisis.
One actor in tattered clothes sat on
the ground with a fork and empty plate
and proceeded to eat as a thoughtful
crowd of about 70 persons looked on.
Food and politics
Political Science Prof. Charles
Drekmeier spoke on the economics of
hunger in the world.
"The National Security Council has
insisted that about half of the billion
dollars' worth of food that is shipped
abroad under the Food for Peace prog
ram would go to bolster the military
strength of our friends such as Cam
bodia and South Vietnam," Drekmeier
said.
"Lon Nol in Cambodia was given
permission to use 83 per cent of the
proceeds of this food for what was de
scribed as 'the common defense' for
internal security," he said. "TheThieu
regime in South Korea was able to
spend 100 per cent of its proceeds on
military buildup."
Monopolies
Drekmeier described the world food
situation as "somewhat comparable to
the problem of the near monopolies of
oil. The six local grain giants have a
position comparable to the so-called
'Seven Sisters,' the huge petroleum
companies."
"Most of them operate anonymously
because they are not directly involved
in the market but work indirectly." he
said.
"With the exception of disaster and
famine relief, the United States does
not now have and never has had a food
aid policy built around the needy
people of the world and the nature of
those needs." Drekmeier said.

War against hunger
This was part of the scene yesterday at a noon rally in White Plaza, part of
the Food Day observance. The skits were staged by the Guerrilla Theater,
part of the Stanford Political Players. No one was injured by this shot.
Speakers and skits were the order for
the day and students here raised more
than $2500 as part of yesterday's Stan
ford Day of Fasting.
According to Food Service Manager
Maxine Anderson, 1247 students
turned in their meal cards, raising
$2628.80 The donations, collected
from food service rebates, will be dis
tributed to various local and interna
tional hunger relief organizations by
the Stanford Committee on Hunger
and the Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC), co-sponsors of the activity.
The Food Service is "interested in
the world food shortage and we think
the efforts of the students to solve this
problem are tremendous," said Ander
son, who indicated that a check will be
made out by the Food Service to the
Stanford Committee on Hunger today.
ARC member David Hawes gave the
opening speech at the noon rally in
White Plaza.
Fasting not the solution
"I think that it's very important that
students be aware that there are hun
gry people around the world including
in the United States," he said. "But it
