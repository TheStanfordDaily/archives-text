# America going straight back in time
## 
### 
Abbie Hoffman has a nose job and a
new wife.
We have an ex-California governor
who almost won the Republican pres
idential nomination by preaching con
tinued white imperialism in Rhodesia
and Panama.
We have a "born again" Christian
President-elect who has re-introduced

the word "lust" into the American
vocabulary.
Soon, dear reader, we may even have
Cod, Mom and apple pie once again.

It is now the decade of the '70s, and
nostalgia for the "Happy Days" of the
glorified '50s is sweeping the nation.
Social awareness gone
Gone are the student demonstra
tions against racism and war
mongering. Gone is the social aware
ness which a concerned generation
forced upon the American public.
The nation has returned to its dream
of peacefulness. It has divorced itself
from the humanist policies it de
veloped in response to the demands
made upon it by the disillusioned
youth of the '60s.
College students are once again con
cerned with grades and getting into
mainstream American business.
Politicians are busy trying to re
establish "fiscal responsibility."
Middle-aged Americans are hoping
for a return to the "decency" they
selectively remember from the 19505.
The military is still receiving huge
quantities of tax dollars, but somehow
that does not seem as wrong as it did 10
years ago.
Opposition mounting
Opposition to abortion, de
segregation, women's rights and free

dom of speech and press is mounting
and catching the imagination of large
segments of the American population.
The issue of racial equality has
largely been dropped by the media and
the government.
Affirmative action in college admis
sions and employment is coming
under fierce attack from determined
individuals and organizations who are
enjoying a growing court victory rate.
The Nixon years have left their mark
on the American people. Nixon's ad
ministration fostered the simplistic
views so popular in the'iOs, when
people were seen as either good orbad,
worthy or unworthy, important or in
significant.
Nixon's hand-picked successor has
retained most of Nixon's appointees
and continues to carry out Nixon
policies.
Nixon himself, disgraced from the
highest office in the land for criminal
activities, still enjoys substantial
support from millions of Americans
who either refuse to believe in his mis
conduct or see not hi ng wrong with his
actions. They will continue to support
him when he returns, as he has prom
ised, to public life.
Archie Bunker
Today's heroes are Fonzie, LaVerne
and Shirley and, inadvertently, Archie
Bunker. The majority of viewers of
"All in the Family" hail Archie
Bunker as its spokesman, according
to several studies of the program audi
ence.
Theambiguities, hypocrisies and in
justices pointed out by the rebels of the
'60s have no place in the '70s. As in the
'50s, such problems are best left ig
nored. To consider them is to have to
think independently, an activity
which is rapidly losing popularity.
Population changes inspired by ra
cism continue to make segregation an

ugly fact of American existence.
The love preached by the movers
and shakers of the '60s has withered
under the national preoccupation with
the commission and cinematic enjoy
ment of brutality and violence.
Equal rights for women are being
opposed with every distortion and
fraudulent statement imaginable. The
myths of woman's inferiority are rein
forced by the likes of LaVerne and
Shirley and Edith Bunker. Eemale
nudity, once the specialty of Playboy,
now enhances the sales of Time and
Newsweek.
Back in time
It is not difficult to see where
America is going. It is going straight
back in time. What is problematic and
hard to understand is why America is
taking that direction.
Are the American people so timid
that they cannot endure the crucial
and complicated issues that confront
the nation? Are we so unimaginative
that we can only accept simplistic
answers to baffling questions? Have
we so disassociated ourselves from a
national conscience that we can re
main unmoved by the plight of unde
veloped nations and by the social in
equities that exist in the daily lives of
large numbers of our own citizens?
Technology, population pressures,
an increasingly smaller world and the
destruction of its environment are
thorny problems that will not go away
simply because we wish them to.
It is time to reverse the trend away
from social and planetary responsibil
ity. It is time to admit the problems of
this decade, and not try to avoid them
bv reliving a decade in the past.
Life in the '70s is not easy, but we
should have the courage to confront it.
