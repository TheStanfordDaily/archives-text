Misrepresentation of China
A Taiwan basketball team due to
play against Stanford on Nov. 18 is
advertised as being from"The Repub
lic of China." The prominent sign out
side Stanford Stadium at Embarcadero
and El Camino is particularly offen
sive.
This deplorable misrepresentation,
whether a result of oversight or of
forethought, should not be condoned.
Apart from misleading a sizeable por
tion of the American public, which is
under the impression that "the
Chinese team" is playing, this practice
reinforces the climate of ignorance and
indifference to vital issues in which
the "Two China Policy" in its various
forms will continue to flourish.
That Taiwan is not a separate coun
try but a province integral to China is a
fact recognized on both sides of the
Taiwan Straight, and the Shanghai
Communique of 1972 has explicitly
stated that "the U.S. Government
does not challenge (the) posi
tion" that "there is but one China."
Even sponsors of athletic events
should not be exempt from political
sensitivity.
