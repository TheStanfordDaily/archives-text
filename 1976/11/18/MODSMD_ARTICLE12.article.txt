# At the Stanford Museum
## Imogen Cunningham: A Celebration 
### Katherine Draznin 
"A Celebration" is the most
appropriate title for the exhibit of
the late Imogen Cunningham's
photographs currently at the
Stanford Museum. Her works
span more than half the history
of photography, yet the contem
poraneity of her vision, her sense
of humor and humanity provide
a true celebration of life.
Well-known to the Bay Area
artist's community, Imogen, as
she was called by both new ac
quaintances and old friends, was
born in Portland, Oregon in
lMHij. She spent her childhood in
Seattle. As a child, she was in
terested in drawing, and espe
cially in drawing her classmates.
During an interview in 1960, she
said of her passion for portrai
ture, "People began to interest
me very early. I don't know why.
Perhaps there is the interest be
cause there are no duplicates.
People are always different; they
are different every second."
"From the time she saw a re
production of a Gertrude
Kasebier print in 1900 until her
death last spring, Imogen
tirelessly persued her craft, sup
porting herself most of her lifeas
a portrait photographer.
Despite her father's distaste
tor "dirty photographers", Im
ogen, vowing to someday pro
duce work as splendid as
Kasebier's, invested in a corres
pondence photography course
in 1901. Her father built her a
darkroom in their woodshed,
and, with her $15 4x5 view cam
era, a book of instructions, and a
box to return the glass negatives
for criticism, she began to
photograph.
Documentary work
Imogen was the only one of ten
children in her family to attend
college. Although her father
hoped she would be a teacher,
she studied chemistry at the
University of Washington,
which had no art department at
that time. Upon graduation in
1907, Imogen spent two years
working for Edwards Curtis, the
renowned documentary photo
grapher of American Indians.
While at (lurtis' Seattle Studios,
she learned the platinum print
ing process, now a prohibitively
expensive technique, while at
Curtis' Seattle studios.
With the aid of a scholarship.
Imogen left for Dresden. Ger
many in 1909 to study at the
Technische Hochschule where
there was an outstanding
photo-chemistry program. She
developed an emulsion of cheap
salts of lead which could replace
the platinum process, and an ar
ticle on this technique was pub
lished in a German technical
journal. However, Imogen never
lost sight of her interest in art.
She took every opportunity to
study original art works in the
museums which she had only
previously been able to see in

miniature reproductions.
During one of her rare oppor
tunities to photograph while in
Europe, Imogen gained an in
sight which she often used in her
professional work. Her adviser,
Robert Luter, told her that he
would think of a mathematical
problem, and that she should
photograph him when she felt
that he had reached the greatest
intensity of concentration.
Do something
This print is included in the
show, and Luter is indeed en
grossed in his thoughts. She
would often put people at ease
by asking them to think of the
most pleasant thing that they
could. She enjoyed working
with young children because she
could get them to "do some
thing" and would follow them
around, often on her knees to get
down to "their level". A series of
these fresh and spontaneous
prints are in the museum dis
play.
This individual moment
of the subject is present
in all her work. Dorothea
Lange, well-known for her De
pression era portraits sup
posedly said, "You aren't close
enough to someone unless you
can smell them." A successful
portrait is one where the viewer
also can "smell" the subject. Im
ogen said of portraiture, "A por
trait has to render something
that comes from the person him
self." In her work there is always
a sense of the importance of the
individual. She did not shoot
crowds or empty buildings or
landscapes but individual peo
ple or objects.
She did not find it easy to
photograph many people be
cause "so many people hate to
see themselves as they really
are." Often, her portraits of un
known people are the most com
pelling. The portrait of Mme.
Ozenfant is intriguing, while
that of her husband, a painter
and critic (not in the show) was
less successful. A sharp light
cuts across Mme. Ozenfant's
face, echoing her angular pro
file. Yet this powerful image is
offset by an ironic detail. In the
dark lower corner, she holds her
husband's hand tightly.
Hoover
Works on display include a
stout and smiling Herbert
Hoover, an almost fierce straight
forward Gertrude Stein, and a
lionesque portrait of Alfred
Stieglitz, cloaked in a heavy
black cape. She photographed
Stieglitz in his New York studio
despite the difficulty of working
his large and worn camera.
Stieglitz's glance is icy and
powerful, true to the man
acknowledged as the prime
mover behind early 20th century
American photography. It was in
great part because of Stieglitz's
attempts to present photography
as a serious art form that photo

"pictorialism" emerged.
Imogen, as well as all photo
graphers of that era, worked in
the soft focus, romantic narrative
style called pictorialism during
the 1910's. Ironically, one of the
earliest examples of "West
Coast" photography comes right
in the middle of her soft focus
work. The sharp and abstract
1915 "Hands of Roi Partridge,
Etcher" predates the 1917 study
of Partridge (whom she had mar
ried in 1915) that is soft and lyri
cal.
Unlike Edwards Weston or
Ansel Adams, Imogen never set
strict rules of technique for her
self. Although all three artists
were members of the f/64 group,
considered the founders of tbe
purist West Coast school, Im
ogen never hesitated to take ad
vantage of accidents, or to exper
iment. She insisted upon integ
rity of the image. She said of the
1972 Self-portrait, a double ex
posure, "Let people worry about
it. They need something to
worry about."
Move to Oakland
Upon returning from Europe
in 1910, Imogen set up a portrait
studio in Seattle where she
worked until 1917 when Par
tridge moved to San Francisco.
In 1920, they moved to Oakland
where Partridge began to teach
at Mills College. The vast bulk of
her Seattle work had been de
stroyed — she broke the glass
negatives over a trash can and
threw them out.
However, a few negatives sur
vived. including the playful and
poetic studies of her friends
dressed as characters in William
Morris poems, and a rare 1915
landscape of Mt. Ranier. This is a
doubly rare print, for she seldom
did a landscape without a figure,
and the negative survived quite
by accident. This landscape was
taken along with a series of
nudes of Partridge on Mt. Ranier
that, at the time of their publica
tion, caused quite a scandal They
were not shown again until
nearly 60 years later.
During the 1920'5, Imogen's
work was limited by the de
mands of raising three sons, but
she took every opportunity she
could to start on a new study
plant "portraiture". She simply
concentrated on what she could
find in her backyard.
Plant works
The most stunning of her plant
works are in this exhibit, and in
and of themselves comprise a
masterful display of vision. They
are striking as abstractions, yet
are also as charged with person
ality and vitality as her human
portraits.
One cannot categorize her
style as simply portraiture and
plants, although these predomi
nate. In a U.S. Camera interview
with Ansel Adams and Dorothea
Lange, Imogen spoke of "typ
ing" her work; "People have for
gotten that I ever did plant
forms. You know, I've tried to
sell people on the idea that I
photograph anything that can be
exposed to light." This includes
the studies of refinery tanks, re
flections inarain puddle, a study
of a wooden head carved by
Robert Howard (1928), but
primarily portraits of people,
often dancers and artists at work,
and children at play.
She also loved to make self
portraits, most of them quite
humorous. One of the funniest
images in the show is the 1960
reflection in a Copenhagen shop
window of Imogen, wearing her
characteristic black cape, hud
dled over her camera in front of a
display of "Youthcraft" girdles.
Divorce
After her divorce from Par
tridge in 1934, Imogen con
tinued to live and work in Oak

land until 1947 when she moved
to San Francisco where she lived
for the rest of her life. From 1912
on, she showed her work fre
quently in one-man and group
shows, including the controver
sial 1932 "Group f/64" show
(which was rehung last year) at
the San Francisco Museum of
Art. Just as this informal and un
pretentious group of serious
photographers gained a reputa
tion as the founders o» the West
Coast school of photography, so
Imogen, who worked in her
studio and her garden, and
taught and lectured in the Bay
Area, gained a large following of
students and admirers.
In celebration of her 90th
birthday in 1973, a show of over
a hundred "Images of Imogen,
1903-1973" was put together in
San Francisco, the majority of
prints by students and friends.
Imogen showed her prints in
over 50 major museum and gal
lery shows during her lifetime.
The first monograph of her
prints was published in 1970 by
the University of Washington. In
April, 1970, she received a
Guggenheim Grant which ena
bled her to print negatives she
had never had time for, includ
ing the surviving glass nega
tives. Her second book, pub
lished in 1973, concurrent with
her birthday celebrations and a
retrospective show, included
these "new" works.
She received the honorary de
gree of Doctor of Fine Arts from
the College of Arts and Crafts in
Oakland in 1968, and the Uni
versity of Washington's Alum
nus Summa Laude Dignatus
award in 1974. She appeared in
James Broughton's humorous
film "The Bed", and was the sub
ject of at least three recent biog
raphical films, including Ann
Hershey's excellent work,
"Never Give Up; Imogen Cun
ningham." Imogen was able to
complete work on her last pro
ject, a book on older people titled
"After 90". This book is ex
pected to appear next spring.
Never satisfied
Yet Imogen was never self
satisfied. She felt her best work
was still to be done. She often
voiced consternation at the at
tention she gained for her long
productive life and lively spirit.
Speaking to artist Margary
Mann, who wrote the introduc
tions to Imogen's first two books,
she said, "I suppose that by the
time most people are my age,
they have it made. People often
marvel at me. 'I don't know how
you keep so busy,' they say. Keep
busy. I don't keep busy. I am
busy."
Her notoriety, as she called it,
and her ability to create a strong
portrait went hand in hand. Her
shey wrote of Imogen, "It was
really Imogen's gift to bridge the
generation gap — a rare energy
enabled her to move within the
years and claim al 1 of us as peers.
She could be obstinate, abrasive
and sarcastic, and just as often,
warm and kind — even vulnera
ble. Like the lens of her Rollei,
she caught the light and focused
down to the truth and snapped.
Sometimes her truth bothered
people."
Complement
Imogen's personality, her
pioneer spirit and insatiable
curiosity, did not overpower
the strength and integrity of her
artistic vision. Rather, they
seemed to complement each
other. A comment about her
philosophy of work appeared in
a 1914 photo magazine article,
and it expresses her attitude and
her success as a photographer
and as a humanist. "One must be
able to gain an understanding at
short notice, and at close range,
of the beauties of character, in

tellect, and spirit, so as to be able
to draw out the best qualities and
make them show in the outer as
pects of what constitutes beauty
in the external, and above all
must not worship it. To worship
beauty for its own sake is narrow
and one surely cannot derive
from it that aesthetic pleasure
which comes from finding
beauty in the commonest
things."
Whether she portrayed a rum
pled bed with hair pins scattered
on the edge — a tongue-in-cheek
"Exercise" for a class taught by
Dorothea Lange—or a reflection
in a puddle, or the sensuous
curves of a magnolia blossom, or
the spiky claws of an agave, Im
ogen held to her view of beauty
and aesthetics for 75 years
as a producing artist. Her work
shows a consistent anti
thesis between romanticism
and realism, but this "split vis
ion" never seemed to bother her.

She said to Hershey, "Why is it
people think anyone else has the
secret? There is no such thing as
a secret — you just have to work
and find your own way, and
everybody can do it. If I can do it.
everybody can."
This exhibit, the first major re
trospective since Imogen Cun
ningham's death, covers an ex
ceptional career. The exhibit
was made possible by a generous
loan of vintage prints from the
Imogen Cunningham Trust of
San Francisco, and includes
prints from the Stanford collec
tion as well as from private col
lections in the Bay Area. It is a
comprehensive show, including
works as early as the 1906 por
traits of Imogen's parents, an
example of Curtis' and
Kasebier's works, the major
landmark prints of Imogen's
career, as well as a most as
tonishing number of previously
unshown and relatively un

known works. Stanford Photo
graphy Curator Anita Mozley
has assembled an impressive tri
bute to an extraordinary artist
and woman.
The exhibit is now on display
in the second floor balcony of the
Stanford Museum and will re
main through January 23, 1977.
The Museum is open Tuesday
through Friday from 10 a.m. to
4:45 p.m. and on weekends from
1 t04:45 p.m. Admission is free.
