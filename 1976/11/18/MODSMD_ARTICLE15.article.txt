I am a Stanford University Staff member,
and recent junk mailings received at my
home address make it clear that Stanford
has been giving away (or selling) lists of
employe addresses.
I realize that by having my name and
address appear in the Faculty-Staff Direc
tory I'm leaving myself open to this sort of
thing, but the mailings have been too con
certed to be entirely due to some organiza
tion manually extracting information from
a directory.
How can I prevent my name from being
on lists of addresses which Stanford may be
giving out?
S.J.
Personally, I've always felt that junk mail
is better than no mail (don't you wanna win
the Reader's Digest Sweepstakes?) but sir
you don't, the solution is simple: don't in
clude your home address or phone number
in the directory.
Although sympathetic — "I get a lot of
junk mail, too" — Personnel Records
Supervisor Judy Andrews categorically de
nies that the University sells mailing lists.
Andrews pointed out that the directories are
sold at the Bookstore, and "anyone can buy
them."
"There is a University mailing list," said
Andrews, "but nobody except certain Uni
versity employees has access to (the list)."
By the way the deadline for specifying an
unlisted address was two weeks ago. So if
you've missed it, better brace yourself for
another mailing season of free coupons and

K-mart ads.
After every home game the area around
the stadium and the arboretum resembles a
gigantic garbage dump. The trash and bro
ken glass remain for days, a hazard to bicyc
lists, a visual disgrace, and probably a
health hazard.
Why can the University afford to plant
instant grass when President Ford comes to
make a speech but lacks the funds to clean
up after a football game? For that matter,
why aren't trash containers placed in the
area in the first place?
-M.L.
It turns out that the trash situation you're
writing about has little to do with a lack of
University funds, since it's up to the Athle
tic Department to clean up after the football
games. According to Assistant Athletic Di
rector Ray Young, the funds come out of
game expenses.
Manpower for the clean-up comes mostly
from student athletes on a "work-aid prog
ram," whereby the students help pay for
their room and board, says Young. That's
partly the problem, since it's often hard to
find time to work between classes and prac
tice—especially during mid-terms. In a one
week period, notes Young, the work force
numbers between 20 and 30.
There are trash barrels throughout the
area. But Young says 'many times people
either choose to ignore them, or park next to
one and claim exclusive rights to it.
As for a possible solution, Young says

they're considering installing large
dumpsters around the stadium, and hand
ing out maps showing where they're lo
cated.
My favorite pieces of sculpture on cam
pus have disappeared. They are the large
metal sculpture, which was in front of the
Art Museum, and the orbiting rings, for
merly in the Art Department courtyard.
Where are they? And who chooses that
other garbage that passes for sculpture
around campus?
-XY
Although both pieces you mentioned
were on campus for many years, Joan Cop
pock of the Art Department tells me the
sculptures were on loan to the University,
and have since been returned.
The sculpture with "orbiting rings," cal
led "Space Churn," was in the Art Depart
ment courtyard from 1973 until earlier this
year, when it was given back to private col
lector George Rickey. The other piece of
sculpture, here from 1968 until 1975, went
back to artist Gerald Walburg, who (I think)
is based in Sacramento.
Coppock says there is an "Outdoor
Sculpture Committee" that does the decid
ing on what piece of sculpture goes where.
The committee, says Coppock, consists of
instructors in the Art Department as well as
other administrators. ... So if you think
they're choosing a lot of "garbage," I'm
SURE they'll be tickled bananas to hear
from you.

My favorite pieces of sculpture on cam

metal sculpture, which was in front of the
Art Museum, and the orbiting rings, for
merly in the Art Department courtyard.
Where are they? And who chooses that
other garbage that passes for sculpture
around campus?
-XY
Although both pieces you mentioned
were on campus for many years, Joan Cop
pock of the Art Department tells me the
sculptures were on loan to the University,
and have since been returned.
The sculpture with "orbiting rings," cal
led "Space Churn," was in the Art Depart
ment courtyard from 1973 until earlier this
year, when it was given back to private col
lector George Rickey. The other piece of
sculpture, here from 1968 until 1975, went
back to artist Gerald Walburg, who (I think)
is based in Sacramento.
Coppock says there is an "Outdoor
Sculpture Committee" that does the decid
ing on what piece of sculpture goes where.
The committee, says Coppock, consists of
instructors in the Art Department as well as
other administrators. ... So if you think
they're choosing a lot of "garbage," I'm
SURE they'll be tickled bananas to hear
from you.

I am a Stanford University Staff member,
and recent junk mailings received at my
home address make it clear that Stanford
has been giving away (or selling) lists of
employe addresses.
I realize that by having my name and
address appear in the Faculty-Staff Direc
tory I'm leaving myself open to this sort of
thing, but the mailings have been too con
certed to be entirely due to some organiza
tion manually extracting information from
a directory.
How can I prevent my name from being
on lists of addresses which Stanford may be
giving out?
S.J.
Personally, I've always felt that junk mail
is better than no mail (don't you wanna win
the Reader's Digest Sweepstakes?) but sir
you don't, the solution is simple: don't in
clude your home address or phone number
in the directory.
Although sympathetic — "I get a lot of
junk mail, too" — Personnel Records
Supervisor Judy Andrews categorically de
nies that the University sells mailing lists.
Andrews pointed out that the directories are
sold at the Bookstore, and "anyone can buy
them."
"There is a University mailing list," said
Andrews, "but nobody except certain Uni
versity employees has access to (the list)."
By the way the deadline for specifying an
unlisted address was two weeks ago. So if
you've missed it, better brace yourself for
another mailing season of free coupons and

K-mart ads.
After every home game the area around
the stadium and the arboretum resembles a
gigantic garbage dump. The trash and bro
ken glass remain for days, a hazard to bicyc
lists, a visual disgrace, and probably a
health hazard.
Why can the University afford to plant
instant grass when President Ford comes to
make a speech but lacks the funds to clean
up after a football game? For that matter,
why aren't trash containers placed in the
area in the first place?
-M.L.
It turns out that the trash situation you're
writing about has little to do with a lack of
University funds, since it's up to the Athle
tic Department to clean up after the football
games. According to Assistant Athletic Di
rector Ray Young, the funds come out of
game expenses.
Manpower for the clean-up comes mostly
from student athletes on a "work-aid prog
ram," whereby the students help pay for
their room and board, says Young. That's
partly the problem, since it's often hard to
find time to work between classes and prac
tice—especially during mid-terms. In a one
week period, notes Young, the work force
numbers between 20 and 30.
There are trash barrels throughout the
area. But Young says 'many times people
either choose to ignore them, or park next to
one and claim exclusive rights to it.

they're considering installing large
