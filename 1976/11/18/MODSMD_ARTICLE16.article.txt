# TO STRENGTHEN UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION
## 
### 
I
For approximately one year, a group o
humanities faculty members, gathering together tc
discuss issues of mutual concern, has debated the
merits of the present structure of the undergraduate
curriculum at Stanford. Events both local and na
tional have encouraged this sustained debate. The
group has had, moreover, the opportunity to hear, al
its informal sessions, the opinions of some of the
' officers of the University who could be expected to
play key roles in the elaboration of the under
graduate curnculum in future years. Among these
officers have been the President, the Dean ol
Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Under
gracfcjate Studies, and the Dean of Admissions.
What herewith follows is not necessarily a reflec
tion of the attitudes of any one of these officers, nor
of any one faculty member Rather, the group as a
whole would now like to offer to the campus com
munity a statement bearing on the design of that
curnculum. The group recognizes that it possesses
neither final wisdom nor institutional authority in
matters such as these; it also recognizes that exten
sive planning remains to be done before revisions in
the curriculum can be addopted
The group speaks, however, with a sense ol
urgency. It is satisfied neither with the quality of the
intellectual life, nor with the goals and standards of
the undergraduate program. It believes, moreover,
that dissatisfaction, at times expressed and at other
times muted, is a sentiment shared by many faculty
members at Stanford. Nor is such a condition
merely local. Discussion within the group has been
enlivened in the past year by the clear recognition
that the problems Stanford now faces (and must
rigorously attempt to resolve) are problems affect
ing every prestigious institution of higher learning.
That the problems are national in their dimensions is
indicated by, among other things, the special
1974-75 issues of Daedalus (Journal of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences) wherein
eighty-four distinguished educators, including sev
eral from Stanford, speak to the conditions now
defining academic life. Differences among these
educators are certainly present, but all are
frightened, as the editor says, "by what they see as
a lack of concern for intellectual values, others worry
about what they think to be a reduced social con
sciousness." The perspective in which this deep
concern, on both the national level and the local
level, takes place is more serious, of course, than
the question of which course or courses must be
required of the undergraduate. It is more serious
than any particular detail. But details and particulars
will, at the appropriate moment, play their crucial
part when revisions in the curriculum are proposed
and then established. The editor of Daedalus de
scribes the newly emergent situation not as "a re
petition of the discussion that occurred in the middle
of the nineteenth century when a rigid, classically
oriented college curriculum was challenged by the
new theoretical and applied sciences. Much more is
at stake today; the continued viability of the concept
of the liberally-educated person is involved."
About the continued viability the Stanford com
munity has the deepest obligation to be concerned.
In the immediate past, that concern has been ex
pressed by the Report of the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stan
ford. The spirit of that Report, in which a clear com
mitment to a requirement in Western Culture is af
firmed, must be sustained and nourished. Hence
the informal Humanities and Sciences group is
happy to note that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has recently, and unanimously, also en
dorsed "the principle that studies in Western Culture
should be part of each student's education."
Discussions within the group have also been in
vigorated by the understanding that the problems
Stanford now faces are not purely national but are
Stanford's own This university must fulfill the spe
cial obligations it has as a private institution, of great
prestige, within a state and a geography dominated
by non-private institutions Its mission has been,
and is, special; so can be the quality of its under
graduate education. To this obligation President
Richard W. Lyman has often spoken, and most tel
lingly speaks in the pages of Daedalus, where he
says
We who are responsible for the continuing
health of our "little platoons" — and even
the greatest of the private universities are
"little platoons" when matched against the
dimensions of state-supported higher edu
cation — we have our work cut out for us...
one virture that ought to be within the reach
of independent institutions, be they old or
new, famous or obscure, is that of rigorous
self-definition.
It is to that rigor arte 1 that self-definition that Stan
ford's attention must now turn Prompted, then, by
both the national anxiety and concern, and opposed
to the idle, helpless notion that little can be done in
the face of curricular and intellectual complexity, this
statement is offered to the Stanford community It is
hoped that it will play some effective part in discus
sions within the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
and the Academic Senate.
The pnnciples underlying the 1968 Study of Edu
cation at Stanford are treated here first. That Study
predates the Report of the Committee on the Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
and by virtue of the seriousness and thoughtfulness
with which it was undertaken, has achieved a con
siderable weight in later discussions of curricular
reform But as the Study itself observes, its spirit
was one of "self-examination and self-renewal." It
further observes that "the study of education must
become a process rather than event." Eight years
have since passed: changes now seem wholly
proper and necessary In the light, then, of such
changes to be made, a second matter for discussion
follows the first It is a consideration of the newly
formulated system of distnbution requirements. Al
though that system is the product of much labor on
the part of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, it does not coherently and directly address
the fundamental inadequacies of the present cur
ncular program for the undergraduate student, it is a
system that is too diffuse and too loosely monitored
to be able to do so Only by a program that is more
coherently structured can the mtellecuual life of the
Stanford student be made more challenging, in
tense, and rewarding
II
The basic philosophy of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). published in 1968-69, was that of
educational laissez fairs This is reflected in two
parallel pronouncements, the first of which ap
peared in the general introductory section of the
report and the second in the section on under
graduate education
"Let fie objectrve of curncular planning be
to encourage the faculty member to teach
what he likes to teach and the student to
learn what seems vital to him — the Intellec
tual History of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century rather than the History of Western
Civilization Modern Consciousness rather
than Freshman English. Organizational Be
havior rather than Introduction to Sociology
— and from this common freedom may
emerge a form of general education far bet
ter suited to the cftaractennbcs of a umver
slty than that to which we pay lip service

now." (Vol. I, p. 14)
And again:
"The objective toward which curriculum
planning should strive is, to the extent pos
sible, to let the teacher teach what he wants
to teach and the student learn what he
wants to learn." (Vol. II, p. 12)
Now philosophies of laissez faire can be arrived at
in different ways and supported or defended on
different grounds. Having in mind Isaiah Berlin's
significant distinction between positive and negative
conceptions of freedom — possitive freedom being
freedom for the achievement of some end deemed
desirable, negative freedom being freedom from
restraint on the assumption that restraint is wrong in
itself 1 — we can roughly distinguish between posi
tive and negative philosophies of laissez faire.
Adam Smith's views concerning economic be
havior were positive in this sense, not because they
were necessarily correct, but because they were
based on extensive inquiries into the nature of
wealth, the nature of human motivation and be
havior, and a clear belief in the desirability of the
conditions to which he thought a free market
economy would contribute. One may, of course,
quarrel with his views, but the fact remains that he
had a carefully worked out theory of social welfare
and advocated free enterprise as the best means of
achieving it. It is not inconceivable that a positive
doctrine of educational laissez faire might be simi
larly grounded on some carefully worked out and
coherent theory of the objectives, functions, and
social impact of higher education. But SES failed to
provide any such theory Instead it provided a nega
tive philosophy of laissez faire based on the view
that in higher education, restraints of any kind are
inherently bad. Moreover, this view was itself based
on a curiously narrow and dubious line of argument
which calls for special attention and comment.
The SES committee took the position that it ought
to base its "proposed reponses to the problems of
education at Stanford on careful consideration of
the meaning of education for individual teacher and
student and of the nature of the university" (Vol. I, p.
8). So far, so good. But it then proceeded to deal
with these questions, not by considering the general
objectives, functions and possible impact of higher
education in and on today's society, nor by consider
ing the important "new dimensions" which it had
cited in the opening sentence of its report as having
been introduced by the student unrest of the 1960's.
Instead, the Committee attempted to deal with all
these questions by the simple expedient of examin
ing the etymology of the single world, education '
The Committee established its "basic premises" i

as follows:
To establish our basic premises we must
begin with our conceptions of education and
of a university. The world 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educere meaning to
lead forth.' To lead does not mean to com
pel, or to push, or to pull. It means quite
simply what it says.. (1,10)
On this foundation it was immediately concluded
(among other things) that education "can never be
compelled nor can knowledge be impressed on a
mind unwilling to learn if it is to be more than indoc
trination'' (I, 10). It was also inferred (without any
corresponding concern for the etymology of the
word "university") that "the University can nevei
educate in the true sense of the word, but it can
supply the environment and the means necessary
to insure that those who came here may educate
each other and themselves'' (I, 10). In short, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, the weight of the
whole report seems to have rested upon the pre
sumed etymology of the word educate.'
The deficiences of this approach are obvious:
1 Words change their meanings. Hence even i
this particular etymology were adequately stated, i
could give no more than a tentative and partial hin
as to the present meaning of the word "education."
2. Given a complex enterprise like that of moderr
education, many different words are involved. If we
are to rely on etymology, we ought surely to con
sider also the etymologies of a variety of other En
glish words which are relevant to education, such as
learning, training, study, scholarship, instruction,
teaching, tutoring, lecturing, research, etc. These
would yield different results, reflecting the simple
fact that education has many facets, and dimen
sions, which cannot be captured by looking at any
simplified etymology of any single word.
3. On the Latin side, we should note first that in
addition to the verb educere (3rd conjugation) on
which the SES committee chose to rely, there was
another related Latin verb, educare (Ist conjuga
tion) meaning 'to train, to rear, to bring up ' It is from
the latter (and its nouneducatfo) that our word edu
cation' is most immediately derived. Secondly, the
Romans had several other verbs which they applied
to the process of education, including instituere,
instruere, and erudire. None of these suggests to
lead forth ; the first two suggested the idea of estab
lishing,' constructing' or setting in order, while the
last implied making smooth.'
Thus the committee's central line of argument —
the first among its "basic premises" — must be
rejected as wholly misconceived This fact does not,
of course, necessarily refute the laissez faire
philosophy which the committee derived from it; as
previously observed, that philosophy might con
ceivably be supported on other grounds. However,
since no other basis was supplied, the committee's
general conclusion stands unsupported. We are left
with, at best, a negative theory of laissez faire — a
theory which might as well have been adopted out of
sheer inertia or even from an impulse to deflate
student po'itical demands by making educational
concessions 2 On this view, educational restraints
are wrong primarily because they are burdensome
and because they are disliked. Eliminating require
ments is good because freedom is good, in and of
itself If teachers are free to teach what they want to
teach and students are free to learn what they want
to leam, we may trust that everybody will benefit and
that the proper interests of society will be served
111
The question now is whether that trust has been
vindicated or discredited The indications are
mounting that it has been discredited — that the kind
of educational laissez faire recommended by the
SES report has already been found seriously defi
cient Several emerging difficulties call for particular
attention.
1 The problem of standards
Derek Bok, President of Harvard University (and
a Stanford alumnus) began a recent article "On the
Purposes of Undergraduate Education' (Daedalus.
Fall, 1974, pp 159-172) as follows
"Scholars who study the behavior of
human organizations constantly stress the
importance of defining institutional goals
Without dear objectives, it is said, an mstitu
tion cannot evaluate how well it is perform
ing, decide how to allocate its resources
wisely, plan for future growth, motivate its
members, or justify its existence to the
larger public
"Despite these admonitions, our colleges
seem to exist without making much of an
effort to define their aims In the thick reports
on undergraduate education that many col
leges have produced in recent years, there
is little discuMion of what it is that a liberal
arts education should provide for me stu-

dent. The prevailing sentiment is captured
by the statement of a curriculum committee
in one of our most distinguished univer
sities: The objective toward which cur
riculum planning should strive is, to the ex
tent possible, to let the teacher teach what
he wants to teach and the student learn
t what he wants to learn.' "
It should be noted lhat the concluding sentence,
cited as exemplifying a prevalent defiaency, is bor
rowed from the SES report; it is the second of the
two excerpts quoted at the beginning of this paper
Bok's point is that the SES philosophy of laissez
faire provides no standards for directing or evaluat
ing any aspect of the academic enterprise, or judg
ing academic performance. If the controlling objec
tive is to allow teachers and students to do whatever
they prefer, why should the university not provide
instruction in basketweaving? If it be replied that
accepted standards of academic excellence and
competence are assumed, the question arises
where such standards originate and how they are
maintained. To the extent that they are needed, the
laissez faire philosophy is thereby shown to be in
adequate
It is one thing to maintain that teachers should
enjoy teaching and that students should enjoy learn
ing, but it is something else to say that immediate
enjoyment — which can vary according to the fash
ions of the day — is to be taken as the primary
measure of academic success. It is perhaps worth
remarking that while the SES report relied on Alfred
North Whitehead's observation that the University's
justification is to preserve "the connection between
knowledge and the zest of life, by uniting the young
and the old in the imaginative consideration of learn
ing" (SES, I, 10) it failed to note that in the same
essay (as well as elsewhere in his writings on edu
cation) Whitehead stressed the need for a "discip
line of imagination" so that the superior vigor of the
young should be tempered by the superior experi
ence of the elders. The persistent problem of educa
tion, in Whitehead's view, is to combine discipline
and imagination so that neither destroys the other.
In his words, "qualities essential at a later stage of a
career are apt to be stamped out in an earlier stage
This is only an instance of the more general fact, that
technical excellence can only be acquired by a train
ing which is apt to damage those energies of mind
which should direct the technical skill. This is the key
fact in education, and the reason for most of its
difficulties." 3
2. Problems of specialization and vocationalism
The Harvard report of 1945, General Education in
a Free Society, probably the most widely influential t
report on higher issued in the decadea
immediate following World War II, devoted most of
its attention to a discussion of the purposes and
functions of education in a free society, "It is fruit
less," the Harvard committee wrote, "to think about
any such practical step as a curriculum without hav
ing in mind specifications or points of reference, in
this case the ends toward which the curriculum
should look and the students for whom it is in
tended." 4
The main problems of education were there attri
buted to three sources: first, the progressive expan
sion of knowledge with the attendant multiplication
of specialisms and sub-specialisms in all areas;
second, the great increase in the number of college
students as opportunities for education beyond the
high-school were extended from the privileged few
and made available to young people at large; and
third, to the increasing complexity of modern society
itself. To cope with these problems, the Harvard
committee felt that education at the college level
ought to perform a dual role. It must, on the one
hand, fully recognize the need for increasing
specialization and provide a foundation for students
going on to careers or vocations requiring particular
skills in diverse areas. But it must at the same time
seek to balance the fragmentation and atomization
threatened by the multiplication of specialties by
finding some unifying dimension or dimensions. It
was concluded that the latter function required re
newed stress on the sort of education that had been
traditionally called "liberal education," specifically
the kind of education designed to develop the
natural capacities of the student as a human being
regardless of the particular social role which he or
she might subsequently fill. "Our conclusion, then,"
wrote the Harvard committee in 1945," is that the
aim of education should be to prepare an individual
to become an expert both in some particular voca
tion or art and in the general art of the free man and
the citizen. Thus the two kinds of education once
given separately to different social classes must be
given to all alike." 5
These views are cited not to suggest that the
curricular innovations recommended by the Har
vard committee in 1945 accomplished their purpose
(which is open to serious debate) but to show that
the committee identified — and tried to meet —
three problems which became more and more pres
sing in the ensuing years Among these, the con
tinued multiplication of specialisms with spreading
emphasis on the importance to the student of de
veloping marketable skills, at a high level of sophis
tication, has proved perhaps the most intractable
One way to deal with this problem is, of course, to do
nothing — to drift with the prevailing current rather
than attempt to swim against it. The SES report, with
its philosophy of laissez faire, does exactly that
Since increasing specialism is the order of the day.
and since competent scholars are specialists, it can
be claimed, "realism" dictates that we accept that
fact, adapting our education to it and letting
threatened dangers take care of themselves But
some of those threatened dangers have already
become actual.

(i) As the opinion spreads that the main function of
higher education is to develop in the student mar
ketable skills — what Steven Miller, President of
Johns Hopkins, calls "higher skilling" as opposed to
higher education 8 — for a job market which is al
ready oversaturated, the value of a college educa
tion is necessanly depreciated. If it were recog
nized, however, that the chief function of a college
education is to develop the human potential of the
student without regard to the particular job he or she
might eventually hold or the particular social role he
or she might occupy, the result would be otherwise
Success or failure in the job market would not be
considered so crucial There is here an illustration of
the point made before, that the objectives (or sup
posed objectives) of education always provide the
criteria for evaluating success or failure
(ii) In regard to the nature and status if knowledge,
Steven Muller, in the article just mentioned, asked
the pregnant question If all our scholars are stand
ing at the frontiers of knowledge, who is standing at
the center? Is there today any center? If not, how
can there be any community of scholars in the tradi
tional sense?
Under present conditions, there is no genuine
community of teachers or students in any college or
university, but rather an aggregate of specialists
and students, each pursuing his or her own sepa
rate interests in geographical proximity, with little or
no basis for cross-disciplinary communication or
understanding One consequence is that most scho
lars feel more affinity with, and more respect for,
their professional colleagues in other universities
than for members of other departments in their own
And there is no longer any unity of knowledge, but
only a collocation of separate knowledges Such a
situation may. perhaps, be defended certainly it is
preferable to an ideological uniformity arbitrarily im
posed But surety there is a middle ground between

these extremes. Muller considers that some return
to general education, with universal requirements
for English, for a second language, for cultural his
tory, and for science, is necessary to restore the
un 'ty of genuine education.
What all our scholars in different disciplines have
in common is that they are all human beings, that
they all share the same cultural inheritance, and that
they are all engaged (or should be) in the same
quest — the quest for greater knowledge and wider
understanding. And we do well, we believe, to recall
the observation of Arthur Lovejoy that he who knows
only his own special field may not know what is most
worth looking lor in his special field. 7
#ii) An extensive investigation recently conducted
byktwo ecfcjcation reporters of the Los Angeles
Tunes into the concurrent phenomena of progres
sive grade inflation along with progressive decline in
the average level of students' proficiency has been
the widespread substitution of new elective
oourses, sometimes lacking in academic rigor, for
the kind of basic courses which used to be required
for all students. 8 Though the demonstration is not
conclusive, it is at least persuasively documented
As against suggestions that the decline in test
scores is due to other causes — such as altered
family structures, the increased number of less qual
ified students, regional factors, or the unreliability of
test scores — the authors of the report point out that
the two areas where test scores have not declined
but held steady or advanced are the areas in which
basic requirements have been largely retained, i.e.,
in the first three primary grades in school and in the
sciences at post-secondary level. These investiga
tions, which are too long to summanze, are worth
senous attention. At least, they cannot be ignored,
despite the attempts of some educators to dismiss
or discount them.
(iv) There is clear evidence that college students
today resent the increasingly competitive atmos
phere of post-secondary education. 9 It seems to be
a fair inference that the competitive aspect reflects
the increasing emphasis in higher education upon
the development of marketable skills. When stu
dents are competing for entrance to professional
schools or for jobs requiring technical proficiency,
and when good grades are seen as important for
Stich purposes, the process of college education
naturally comes to be seen as a struggle of each
against all; for admission to a limited number of
'ftllure positions. But liberal education, in the tradi
tional sense, has a different character. The
philosopher Spinoza pointed out that intellectual
goods sought for their own sake are non-
C9mpetitive. If one person achieves wisdom or in
creased insight, he is not threatened but reinforced
if his neighbors do likewise. Here is one major dif
ference between virtues of character and technical
skills, at least where the latter determine job oppor
tunities. Nothing is so useful or agreeable to the
virtuous man, Spinoza wrote, as the company of
others who are like-minded. Where self-realization
or self-improvement is the aim rather than voca
tional proficiency — as is the case with liberal edu
cation — emulation can be a spur without being a
threat. And the community of scholars, for teachers
and students alike, rests upon such a foundation
Thef search for "higher skilling" is centrifugal; the
search for liberal education is centripetal. A student
whose aim is self-development or self-improvement
as a human being values grades only as indications
of his own progress, not for any advantage they may
give over others.

(v) As our society becomes increasingly complex,
as specialisms multiply, and as it becomes increas
ingly apparent that the most serious problems ex
tend over many diciplines, it follows, as Professor
Gabriel Almond has observed, that "only higher
order philosophical syntheses can spell out the big
issues and formulate alternative solutions." 10 At the
same time, our society is becoming more and more
susceptible at all levels to the pull of simplistic slo
gans, catchwords, images, stereotypes and
counter-stereotypes. In this situation the need for
critical intelligence and balanced judgment is be
coming more and more acute, yet this need is not
likely to be apparent to the beginning student, par
ticularly if he is bent on acquiring some particular
skill. The SES report quoted approvingly an obser
vation of Professor Edwin M. Good to the effect that
the important simplicities are those which lie "on the
other side of complexity" (Vol. I, p. 11). Surely the
proper inference is that today's student, seeking tp
pick his way through the growing thicket of com
plexities towards some thoughtful and balanced
overview — as opposed to the delusive simplicities
offered by catchwords and fashionable stereotypes
— needs more guidance and direction than ever
before. The claim of the SES committee that today's
student is in a better position than anybody else to
choose the academic path he will take (Vol. I. p. 15)
seems like saying that the thicker the forest be
comes, the less need there is to require would-be
travellers to take a guide.
IV
Recommendations for achieving the aims of lib
eral education generally envisage imposed re
quirements covenng, in addition to courses in En
glish and in a foreign language, a required course or
courses in Western culture or the history of ideas
We are not concerned here with particular prog
rams, but with the sort of objections most commonly
raised against imposing such requirements.
1. It is often claimed that a required course in
Western culture or the history of ideas in the West is
chauvinistic, since it implies the superiority of the
Western tradition above other traditions The objec
tion is misconceived The purpose of studying the
Western tradition is not to celebrate it but to under
stand It — for good or ill. To evaluate Western
culture, or any other culture, without first making the
effort to understand it is to judge irrationally without
adequate evidence Many people make this very
mistake, but the fact that the mistake is common
affords a good reason for trying to correct it.
2. It is often claimed that requiring students to
study any particular subject is arbitrary because no
particular subject is intrinsically more important than
any other One might, so the argument goes, make
as good a case for general requirement in, say,
psychology or the scientific study of human be
havior The answer here is that all heirs of the West
ern tradition — whether specialists or generalists,
students or faculty, regardless of their special in
terests and capacities — are themselves con
ditioned by Western culture The same is true of all
the specialized disciplines which have developed in
the West they all reflect distinctively Western con
ceptions of rationality and the role of systematic
inquiry '' (Xir heritage affects our preconceptions
about the nature and function of scientific know
ledge as well as our preconceptions about values
and norms It is not too much to say that no person
can hope to understand who he or she is without
some understanding of the cultural context, handed
down from prior generations, in which he or she
presently exists Nobody lives, thinks, or talks in a
cultural void Nobody is exempt from cultural influ
ences Hence the peculiar importance of a general
requirement that students systematically examine
the cultural background which they all share
3 It is sometimes objected that a cultural re
quirement would put a premium on conformity to
accepted values We would suggest that the oppo
site is true The dangerous conformities are those
which are blind, unconscious, and uncritical Most
cultures breed rebels as well as conformists, as our

culture has. If a required course in Western culture
is designed (as above noted) to promote the accu
rate understanding of the Western orientation, the
result should be to make both rebels and confor
mists more dearly aware of what it is that they are
rejecting or accepting.
4. It has been objected that there is no reliable
evidence by which we can evaluate the effective
ness of general courses of the kind here envisaged;
hence they should not be required. We grant the
premise but reject the conclusion. The difficulty of
evaluation arises principally, we think, from the fact
that a good educational program has, or should
have, a long-term impact upon the student, and
such impacts are not precisely identifiable or quanti
fiable. To insist too much on precise evaluations
tends to put the emphasis on those short-term be
nefits and immediate satisfaction which can be as
certained, at the expense of the lasting benefits
which can be recognized, if at all, only in retrospect.
However this may be, the present objection cuts
both ways. If we cannot measure in advance the
precise effectiveness of a proposed requirement,
we cannot measure the relative effectiveness of a
program from which such requirements are omitted.
5. It has been claimed that students cannot be
made to learn what they do not wish to learn, or, as
last year s Council of ASSU Presidents put it, "You
can lead a student to a class but you can't make one
think." This position calls for clarification, because it
is highly ambiguous.
Much of what we learn from everyday experience
is not chosen, but forced upon us, often against our
wills, like learning that hot stoves can burn or that
careless driving invites serious accidents. With re
gard to required courses, the evidence is that many
generations of Stanford graduates found value in,
and claim to have profited from, the old course in
Western Civilization despite its having been pre
scribed. Many required courses in other colleges
and universities seem to have had substantial suc
cess. It is evident that the present objection is over
stated.
Perhaps we should interpret it to mean that stu
dents learn better when they study subjects which
they enjoy. There is some truth in this, but there is
also room for a serious confusion. One may enjoy
the process of studying a subject without liking or
approving the subject under study. A medical stu
dent, for example, does not normally enjoy or ap
prove of diseases A student of criminal behavior
does not normally enjoy or approve of crime. Such
students take satisfaction in learning how to cope
with the problems created by disease and crime. So
also a student of Western culture need not like or
approve of Western culture as such in order to find
satisfaction in making a study of it. If this distinction
is kept in mind, a further point emerges, namely, that
nobody can judge whether studying a given subject
will yield satisfaction or prove valuable to him until
after he has engaged in it. Students who view all
required courses as an infringement upon their
freedom of choice sometimes forget that freedom to
make informed choices is not the same as freedom
to make uninformed choices.
It used to be taken lor granted that if students
came to college, it was because they wished to be
made to think, this being accepted as an essential
part of a college education. The present argument,
however, introduces a distinction, as if students
were now saying: "Please give us an education, but
don't make us Slink — or at least, don't make us
think any more than we like or about topics we don't
like." Such a position, if taken seriously, would make
disciplined thinking peripheral rather than central to
the educational process, since disciplined thinking
is usually laborious and the habit of disciplined think
ing can only be acquired, like other skills, by sus
tained practice and fatiguing application.
Finally, it should be noted that when autonomy is
equated with negative freedom in Berlin's sense —
that is to say with freedom from restraints — and
when freedom from restraints is conceived as imply
ing freedom from any imposed norms or standards,
autonomy loses its value As Sartre showed in
Being and Nothingness, freedom without
guidelines is a burden; it is the freedom of the travel
ler lost in the jungle without a map, who can move in
any direction he wishes but has no basis for choos
ing one direction rather than another. From the
psychological point of view, this kind of freedom
results either in existential despair or in a kind of
narcissism which, valuing only sensations and ple
asures of the moment, and fearing the restraint of
any firm commitments, ends by trivalizing the very
pleasures it claims to prize. l 2 It also serves to de
stroy community with others; cooperation among
individuals is impossible where there are no com
monly accepted standards of acceptable and unac
ceptable behavior, because nobody can count on
what others will do. And even the ideal of universal
brotherhood is weakened if it is taken to imply free
dom from any concrete responsibilities to any par
ticular human beings 13
In a society where catchwords tend to replace
critical inquiry, words like freedom' and autonomy
take on a life of their own and acquire a special
emotional force, as if they represented absolute
goods. If autonomy is valuable, we easily assume
that the more autonomy we have the better off we
are, and that a condition of unlimited autonomy must
be best of all But such is not the case Individual
freedom and autonomy are vitally important as in
strumental goods, but to convert them into absolute
goods is to destroy their function.
V
In the foregoing section we have argued that re
quirements, far from being an evil, are, in fact,
necessary for the purposes of a liberal education
Here we may be more specific about requirements
at Stanford.
The Stanford undergraduate curriculum currentty
includes two requirements One is that of the Major,
based on the pnnciple of study in depth This re
quirement was re-examined and reaffirmed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (Campus
Report, 130ct. 1976, p.B). The other is the recently
redefined Distnbution Requirement wtiich aims to
provide the breadth of study necessary for a liberal
eAjcation to yield "a richer personal life through the
development of spaciousness of mind and spirit
The Distribution Requirements exist to ensure ex
posure to different ideas and different ways of think
ing They should enable (one) to understand better
the major ways of knowing,' to assess their
strengths and limitations, to appreciate their un
iqueness, and no less importantly to discern what
they have in common" (DRAT, p 21).
Under the present system, work in the three re
quired areas entails the study of certain works of
creative imagination in their cultural and histoncal
contexts, or of certain problems of philosophy and
belief (Humanities); the study of society, social in
stitutions. and human behavior (Social Saences);
and the study of natural phenomena, technology,
and math (NS/M/T) The stress in each area is upon
approaches, scholarly methods, and the general
human significance of the vanous kinds of study In
addition, for each area, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommends development of
groups of correlated courses; in Humanities the
courses chosen to fulfil the requirement must form a
group which can be certified" by the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (directly approved by the Dean
if the group is chosen by a student, indirectly, if set
up by a department)
The pnnaple of breadth is thus fulfilled by requir

ing a certain amount of study in the three areas into
which human knowledge has been conveniently di
vided. Vet, within each area, a different principle of
order is invoked, and a broad, comprehensive out
look is neither required nor encouraged Moreover,
no principles are stated for the organization of cor re
lated groups or "sequences" within the areas. Nor
has advice been given to departments on the ways
in which they should, in practice, "group" their own
courses or correlate them with courses in other de
partments
In addition, students have not been advised about
the designing of a Humanities program which might
be acceptable to the Doan. Much of the "freedom"
prescribed by SES was predicated on the assump
tion that undergraduate advising, especially for un
declared majors (freshman and sophomore years),
would be vigorous and that the "strongly recom
mended" alternatives and choices would be made
under vigilant academic guidance. Unfortunately,
the faculty, as advisors, cannot peiform the neces
sary academic surveillance given the laissoz fain)
philosophy of the present system.
This loosely structured program may have some
merit in that it recognizes the validity of both syn
chronic and diachronic methods of study, however,
it is impractical and unwittingly misleading. A stu
dent can easily justify the coherence of a group of
three courses, on say, the liteiature, art and society
of fifth-century Athens, or that of a group embracing
the three story-tellers Homer, Dorothy Richardson
and Dostoyevsky, or even that of any three courses
taught by an individual professor.
Are these two requirements — Major and Dis
tribution — an adequate foundation for a liberal
education? We feel that they are not. The student
certainly needs the intellectual methods proper to
the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences which the Distribution Requirement is
supposed to provide. But a good liberal education
has to be more comprehensive. It must include
some systematic study of the fundamental nature
and development of the culture and civilization
within which the student is living and to which he will
someday contribute. It must also provide basic in
formation about the complexities of modern society,
the means to analyse and evaluate that society, and
the perspective necessary to judge it on a compara
tive basis. In addition, the student should have some
knowledge of a culture remote from his own — a
culture outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition, suc h
as Greek or Asian — which will confront him with
ideas that challenge his unconscious assumptions
about his own time and place.
Many who agree in principle with such educa
tional ideals feel that they cannot be achieved. We
disagree. This is a university rich in teaching re
sources which has demonstrated on other occa
sions an ability to make sensible and worthwhile
educational innovations when they have been
needed. They are needed now. Departments and
individual instructors are well-equipped to deal with
the task at hand, and we should certainly draw on
our excellent teaching resources.
The Report of the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford has
suggested certain specific ways in which, through a
program of "tracks," undergraduate education
could achieve the strength and the focus it lacks at
the moment. The Report also mentions the desira
bility of historical and comparative studies whereby
modern Western culture can be confr onted not only
with past stages of its development, but also with
manifestations of other cultures. The program en
visioned by the Report is based partly on existing
courses covering the Western tradition. This prog
ram would allow the student to choose among four
approaches — literature and language; history; re
ligion and philosophy, or the creative and perform
ing arts — all leading to the same goal. This ap
proach would give to each student an educational
program more coherent than the present one.
The appropriate authorities — the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, the Doan of Undar
graduate Studies, the Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (where most under
graduate teaching takes place) — must now de
velop a plan for providing, either through new
courses or through the adaptation of existing
courses, a method for satisfying the educational
needs we have outlined. Those authorities should
also consider how that plan, when in operation,
could be monitored effectively T he responsibility
our University has to its undergraduates and the
obligation it has to its reputation demands that such
action be taken promptly.
Having outlined our views in this general stato
ment, we intend to publish in the next few months a
series of position papers suggesting concrete im
provements to undergraduate education at Stan
ford.

For approximately one year, a group o
humanities faculty members, gathering together tc
discuss issues of mutual concern, has debated the
merits of the present structure of the undergraduate
curriculum at Stanford. Events both local and na
tional have encouraged this sustained debate. The
group has had, moreover, the opportunity to hear, al
its informal sessions, the opinions of some of the
' officers of the University who could be expected to
play key roles in the elaboration of the under
graduate curnculum in future years. Among these
officers have been the President, the Dean ol
Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Under
gracfcjate Studies, and the Dean of Admissions.
What herewith follows is not necessarily a reflec
tion of the attitudes of any one of these officers, nor
of any one faculty member Rather, the group as a
whole would now like to offer to the campus com
munity a statement bearing on the design of that
curnculum. The group recognizes that it possesses
neither final wisdom nor institutional authority in
matters such as these; it also recognizes that exten
sive planning remains to be done before revisions in
the curriculum can be addopted
The group speaks, however, with a sense ol
urgency. It is satisfied neither with the quality of the
intellectual life, nor with the goals and standards of
the undergraduate program. It believes, moreover,
that dissatisfaction, at times expressed and at other
times muted, is a sentiment shared by many faculty
members at Stanford. Nor is such a condition
merely local. Discussion within the group has been
enlivened in the past year by the clear recognition
that the problems Stanford now faces (and must
rigorously attempt to resolve) are problems affect
ing every prestigious institution of higher learning.
That the problems are national in their dimensions is
indicated by, among other things, the special
1974-75 issues of Daedalus (Journal of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences) wherein
eighty-four distinguished educators, including sev
eral from Stanford, speak to the conditions now
defining academic life. Differences among these
educators are certainly present, but all are
frightened, as the editor says, "by what they see as
a lack of concern for intellectual values, others worry
about what they think to be a reduced social con
sciousness." The perspective in which this deep
concern, on both the national level and the local
level, takes place is more serious, of course, than
the question of which course or courses must be
required of the undergraduate. It is more serious
than any particular detail. But details and particulars
will, at the appropriate moment, play their crucial
part when revisions in the curriculum are proposed
and then established. The editor of Daedalus de
scribes the newly emergent situation not as "a re
petition of the discussion that occurred in the middle
of the nineteenth century when a rigid, classically
oriented college curriculum was challenged by the
new theoretical and applied sciences. Much more is
at stake today; the continued viability of the concept
of the liberally-educated person is involved."
About the continued viability the Stanford com
munity has the deepest obligation to be concerned.
In the immediate past, that concern has been ex
pressed by the Report of the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stan
ford. The spirit of that Report, in which a clear com
mitment to a requirement in Western Culture is af
firmed, must be sustained and nourished. Hence
the informal Humanities and Sciences group is
happy to note that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has recently, and unanimously, also en
dorsed "the principle that studies in Western Culture
should be part of each student's education."
Discussions within the group have also been in
vigorated by the understanding that the problems
Stanford now faces are not purely national but are
Stanford's own This university must fulfill the spe
cial obligations it has as a private institution, of great
prestige, within a state and a geography dominated
by non-private institutions Its mission has been,
and is, special; so can be the quality of its under
graduate education. To this obligation President
Richard W. Lyman has often spoken, and most tel
lingly speaks in the pages of Daedalus, where he
says
We who are responsible for the continuing
health of our "little platoons" — and even
the greatest of the private universities are
"little platoons" when matched against the
dimensions of state-supported higher edu
cation — we have our work cut out for us...
one virture that ought to be within the reach
of independent institutions, be they old or
new, famous or obscure, is that of rigorous
self-definition.
It is to that rigor arte 1 that self-definition that Stan
ford's attention must now turn Prompted, then, by
both the national anxiety and concern, and opposed
to the idle, helpless notion that little can be done in
the face of curricular and intellectual complexity, this
statement is offered to the Stanford community It is
hoped that it will play some effective part in discus
sions within the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
and the Academic Senate.
The pnnciples underlying the 1968 Study of Edu
cation at Stanford are treated here first. That Study
predates the Report of the Committee on the Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
and by virtue of the seriousness and thoughtfulness
with which it was undertaken, has achieved a con
siderable weight in later discussions of curricular
reform But as the Study itself observes, its spirit
was one of "self-examination and self-renewal." It
further observes that "the study of education must
become a process rather than event." Eight years
have since passed: changes now seem wholly
proper and necessary In the light, then, of such
changes to be made, a second matter for discussion
follows the first It is a consideration of the newly
formulated system of distnbution requirements. Al
though that system is the product of much labor on
the part of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, it does not coherently and directly address
the fundamental inadequacies of the present cur
ncular program for the undergraduate student, it is a
system that is too diffuse and too loosely monitored
to be able to do so Only by a program that is more
coherently structured can the mtellecuual life of the
Stanford student be made more challenging, in
tense, and rewarding
II
The basic philosophy of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). published in 1968-69, was that of
educational laissez fairs This is reflected in two
parallel pronouncements, the first of which ap
peared in the general introductory section of the
report and the second in the section on under
graduate education
"Let fie objectrve of curncular planning be
to encourage the faculty member to teach
what he likes to teach and the student to
learn what seems vital to him — the Intellec
tual History of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century rather than the History of Western
Civilization Modern Consciousness rather
than Freshman English. Organizational Be
havior rather than Introduction to Sociology
— and from this common freedom may
emerge a form of general education far bet
ter suited to the cftaractennbcs of a umver
slty than that to which we pay lip service

now." (Vol. I, p. 14)
And again:
"The objective toward which curriculum
planning should strive is, to the extent pos
sible, to let the teacher teach what he wants
to teach and the student learn what he
wants to learn." (Vol. II, p. 12)
Now philosophies of laissez faire can be arrived at
in different ways and supported or defended on
different grounds. Having in mind Isaiah Berlin's
significant distinction between positive and negative
conceptions of freedom — possitive freedom being
freedom for the achievement of some end deemed
desirable, negative freedom being freedom from
restraint on the assumption that restraint is wrong in
itself 1 — we can roughly distinguish between posi
tive and negative philosophies of laissez faire.
Adam Smith's views concerning economic be
havior were positive in this sense, not because they
were necessarily correct, but because they were
based on extensive inquiries into the nature of
wealth, the nature of human motivation and be
havior, and a clear belief in the desirability of the
conditions to which he thought a free market
economy would contribute. One may, of course,
quarrel with his views, but the fact remains that he
had a carefully worked out theory of social welfare
and advocated free enterprise as the best means of
achieving it. It is not inconceivable that a positive
doctrine of educational laissez faire might be simi
larly grounded on some carefully worked out and
coherent theory of the objectives, functions, and
social impact of higher education. But SES failed to
provide any such theory Instead it provided a nega
tive philosophy of laissez faire based on the view
that in higher education, restraints of any kind are
inherently bad. Moreover, this view was itself based
on a curiously narrow and dubious line of argument
which calls for special attention and comment.
The SES committee took the position that it ought
to base its "proposed reponses to the problems of
education at Stanford on careful consideration of
the meaning of education for individual teacher and
student and of the nature of the university" (Vol. I, p.
8). So far, so good. But it then proceeded to deal
with these questions, not by considering the general
objectives, functions and possible impact of higher
education in and on today's society, nor by consider
ing the important "new dimensions" which it had
cited in the opening sentence of its report as having
been introduced by the student unrest of the 1960's.
Instead, the Committee attempted to deal with all
these questions by the simple expedient of examin
ing the etymology of the single world, education '
The Committee established its "basic premises" i

as follows:
To establish our basic premises we must
begin with our conceptions of education and
of a university. The world 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educere meaning to
lead forth.' To lead does not mean to com
pel, or to push, or to pull. It means quite
simply what it says.. (1,10)
On this foundation it was immediately concluded
(among other things) that education "can never be
compelled nor can knowledge be impressed on a
mind unwilling to learn if it is to be more than indoc
trination'' (I, 10). It was also inferred (without any
corresponding concern for the etymology of the
word "university") that "the University can nevei
educate in the true sense of the word, but it can
supply the environment and the means necessary
to insure that those who came here may educate
each other and themselves'' (I, 10). In short, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, the weight of the
whole report seems to have rested upon the pre
sumed etymology of the word educate.'
The deficiences of this approach are obvious:
1 Words change their meanings. Hence even i
this particular etymology were adequately stated, i
could give no more than a tentative and partial hin
as to the present meaning of the word "education."
2. Given a complex enterprise like that of moderr
education, many different words are involved. If we
are to rely on etymology, we ought surely to con
sider also the etymologies of a variety of other En
glish words which are relevant to education, such as
learning, training, study, scholarship, instruction,
teaching, tutoring, lecturing, research, etc. These
would yield different results, reflecting the simple
fact that education has many facets, and dimen
sions, which cannot be captured by looking at any
simplified etymology of any single word.
3. On the Latin side, we should note first that in
addition to the verb educere (3rd conjugation) on
which the SES committee chose to rely, there was
another related Latin verb, educare (Ist conjuga
tion) meaning 'to train, to rear, to bring up ' It is from
the latter (and its nouneducatfo) that our word edu
cation' is most immediately derived. Secondly, the
Romans had several other verbs which they applied
to the process of education, including instituere,
instruere, and erudire. None of these suggests to
lead forth ; the first two suggested the idea of estab
lishing,' constructing' or setting in order, while the
last implied making smooth.'
Thus the committee's central line of argument —
the first among its "basic premises" — must be
rejected as wholly misconceived This fact does not,
of course, necessarily refute the laissez faire
philosophy which the committee derived from it; as
previously observed, that philosophy might con
ceivably be supported on other grounds. However,
since no other basis was supplied, the committee's
general conclusion stands unsupported. We are left
with, at best, a negative theory of laissez faire — a
theory which might as well have been adopted out of
sheer inertia or even from an impulse to deflate
student po'itical demands by making educational
concessions 2 On this view, educational restraints
are wrong primarily because they are burdensome
and because they are disliked. Eliminating require
ments is good because freedom is good, in and of
itself If teachers are free to teach what they want to
teach and students are free to learn what they want
to leam, we may trust that everybody will benefit and
that the proper interests of society will be served
111
The question now is whether that trust has been
vindicated or discredited The indications are
mounting that it has been discredited — that the kind
of educational laissez faire recommended by the
SES report has already been found seriously defi
cient Several emerging difficulties call for particular
attention.
1 The problem of standards
Derek Bok, President of Harvard University (and
a Stanford alumnus) began a recent article "On the
Purposes of Undergraduate Education' (Daedalus.
Fall, 1974, pp 159-172) as follows
"Scholars who study the behavior of
human organizations constantly stress the
importance of defining institutional goals
Without dear objectives, it is said, an mstitu
tion cannot evaluate how well it is perform
ing, decide how to allocate its resources
wisely, plan for future growth, motivate its
members, or justify its existence to the
larger public
"Despite these admonitions, our colleges
seem to exist without making much of an
effort to define their aims In the thick reports
on undergraduate education that many col
leges have produced in recent years, there
is little discuMion of what it is that a liberal
arts education should provide for me stu-

dent. The prevailing sentiment is captured
by the statement of a curriculum committee
in one of our most distinguished univer
sities: The objective toward which cur
riculum planning should strive is, to the ex
tent possible, to let the teacher teach what
he wants to teach and the student learn
t what he wants to learn.' "
It should be noted lhat the concluding sentence,
cited as exemplifying a prevalent defiaency, is bor
rowed from the SES report; it is the second of the
two excerpts quoted at the beginning of this paper
Bok's point is that the SES philosophy of laissez
faire provides no standards for directing or evaluat
ing any aspect of the academic enterprise, or judg
ing academic performance. If the controlling objec
tive is to allow teachers and students to do whatever
they prefer, why should the university not provide
instruction in basketweaving? If it be replied that
accepted standards of academic excellence and
competence are assumed, the question arises
where such standards originate and how they are
maintained. To the extent that they are needed, the
laissez faire philosophy is thereby shown to be in
adequate
It is one thing to maintain that teachers should
enjoy teaching and that students should enjoy learn
ing, but it is something else to say that immediate
enjoyment — which can vary according to the fash
ions of the day — is to be taken as the primary
measure of academic success. It is perhaps worth
remarking that while the SES report relied on Alfred
North Whitehead's observation that the University's
justification is to preserve "the connection between
knowledge and the zest of life, by uniting the young
and the old in the imaginative consideration of learn
ing" (SES, I, 10) it failed to note that in the same
essay (as well as elsewhere in his writings on edu
cation) Whitehead stressed the need for a "discip
line of imagination" so that the superior vigor of the
young should be tempered by the superior experi
ence of the elders. The persistent problem of educa
tion, in Whitehead's view, is to combine discipline
and imagination so that neither destroys the other.
In his words, "qualities essential at a later stage of a
career are apt to be stamped out in an earlier stage
This is only an instance of the more general fact, that
technical excellence can only be acquired by a train
ing which is apt to damage those energies of mind
which should direct the technical skill. This is the key
fact in education, and the reason for most of its
difficulties." 3
2. Problems of specialization and vocationalism
The Harvard report of 1945, General Education in
a Free Society, probably the most widely influential t
report on higher issued in the decadea
immediate following World War II, devoted most of
its attention to a discussion of the purposes and
functions of education in a free society, "It is fruit
less," the Harvard committee wrote, "to think about
any such practical step as a curriculum without hav
ing in mind specifications or points of reference, in
this case the ends toward which the curriculum
should look and the students for whom it is in
tended." 4
The main problems of education were there attri
buted to three sources: first, the progressive expan
sion of knowledge with the attendant multiplication
of specialisms and sub-specialisms in all areas;
second, the great increase in the number of college
students as opportunities for education beyond the
high-school were extended from the privileged few
and made available to young people at large; and
third, to the increasing complexity of modern society
itself. To cope with these problems, the Harvard
committee felt that education at the college level
ought to perform a dual role. It must, on the one
hand, fully recognize the need for increasing
specialization and provide a foundation for students
going on to careers or vocations requiring particular
skills in diverse areas. But it must at the same time
seek to balance the fragmentation and atomization
threatened by the multiplication of specialties by
finding some unifying dimension or dimensions. It
was concluded that the latter function required re
newed stress on the sort of education that had been
traditionally called "liberal education," specifically
the kind of education designed to develop the
natural capacities of the student as a human being
regardless of the particular social role which he or
she might subsequently fill. "Our conclusion, then,"
wrote the Harvard committee in 1945," is that the
aim of education should be to prepare an individual
to become an expert both in some particular voca
tion or art and in the general art of the free man and
the citizen. Thus the two kinds of education once
given separately to different social classes must be
given to all alike." 5
These views are cited not to suggest that the
curricular innovations recommended by the Har
vard committee in 1945 accomplished their purpose
(which is open to serious debate) but to show that
the committee identified — and tried to meet —
three problems which became more and more pres
sing in the ensuing years Among these, the con
tinued multiplication of specialisms with spreading
emphasis on the importance to the student of de
veloping marketable skills, at a high level of sophis
tication, has proved perhaps the most intractable
One way to deal with this problem is, of course, to do
nothing — to drift with the prevailing current rather
than attempt to swim against it. The SES report, with
its philosophy of laissez faire, does exactly that
Since increasing specialism is the order of the day.
and since competent scholars are specialists, it can
be claimed, "realism" dictates that we accept that
fact, adapting our education to it and letting
threatened dangers take care of themselves But
some of those threatened dangers have already
become actual.

(i) As the opinion spreads that the main function of
higher education is to develop in the student mar
ketable skills — what Steven Miller, President of
Johns Hopkins, calls "higher skilling" as opposed to
higher education 8 — for a job market which is al
ready oversaturated, the value of a college educa
tion is necessanly depreciated. If it were recog
nized, however, that the chief function of a college
education is to develop the human potential of the
student without regard to the particular job he or she
might eventually hold or the particular social role he
or she might occupy, the result would be otherwise
Success or failure in the job market would not be
considered so crucial There is here an illustration of
the point made before, that the objectives (or sup
posed objectives) of education always provide the
criteria for evaluating success or failure
(ii) In regard to the nature and status if knowledge,
Steven Muller, in the article just mentioned, asked
the pregnant question If all our scholars are stand
ing at the frontiers of knowledge, who is standing at
the center? Is there today any center? If not, how
can there be any community of scholars in the tradi
tional sense?
Under present conditions, there is no genuine
community of teachers or students in any college or
university, but rather an aggregate of specialists
and students, each pursuing his or her own sepa
rate interests in geographical proximity, with little or
no basis for cross-disciplinary communication or
understanding One consequence is that most scho
lars feel more affinity with, and more respect for,
their professional colleagues in other universities
than for members of other departments in their own
And there is no longer any unity of knowledge, but
only a collocation of separate knowledges Such a
situation may. perhaps, be defended certainly it is
preferable to an ideological uniformity arbitrarily im
posed But surety there is a middle ground between

these extremes. Muller considers that some return
to general education, with universal requirements
for English, for a second language, for cultural his
tory, and for science, is necessary to restore the
un 'ty of genuine education.
What all our scholars in different disciplines have
in common is that they are all human beings, that
they all share the same cultural inheritance, and that
they are all engaged (or should be) in the same
quest — the quest for greater knowledge and wider
understanding. And we do well, we believe, to recall
the observation of Arthur Lovejoy that he who knows
only his own special field may not know what is most
worth looking lor in his special field. 7
#ii) An extensive investigation recently conducted
byktwo ecfcjcation reporters of the Los Angeles
Tunes into the concurrent phenomena of progres
sive grade inflation along with progressive decline in
the average level of students' proficiency has been
the widespread substitution of new elective
oourses, sometimes lacking in academic rigor, for
the kind of basic courses which used to be required
for all students. 8 Though the demonstration is not
conclusive, it is at least persuasively documented
As against suggestions that the decline in test
scores is due to other causes — such as altered
family structures, the increased number of less qual
ified students, regional factors, or the unreliability of
test scores — the authors of the report point out that
the two areas where test scores have not declined
but held steady or advanced are the areas in which
basic requirements have been largely retained, i.e.,
in the first three primary grades in school and in the
sciences at post-secondary level. These investiga
tions, which are too long to summanze, are worth
senous attention. At least, they cannot be ignored,
despite the attempts of some educators to dismiss
or discount them.
(iv) There is clear evidence that college students
today resent the increasingly competitive atmos
phere of post-secondary education. 9 It seems to be
a fair inference that the competitive aspect reflects
the increasing emphasis in higher education upon
the development of marketable skills. When stu
dents are competing for entrance to professional
schools or for jobs requiring technical proficiency,
and when good grades are seen as important for
Stich purposes, the process of college education
naturally comes to be seen as a struggle of each
against all; for admission to a limited number of
'ftllure positions. But liberal education, in the tradi
tional sense, has a different character. The
philosopher Spinoza pointed out that intellectual
goods sought for their own sake are non-
C9mpetitive. If one person achieves wisdom or in
creased insight, he is not threatened but reinforced
if his neighbors do likewise. Here is one major dif
ference between virtues of character and technical
skills, at least where the latter determine job oppor
tunities. Nothing is so useful or agreeable to the
virtuous man, Spinoza wrote, as the company of
others who are like-minded. Where self-realization
or self-improvement is the aim rather than voca
tional proficiency — as is the case with liberal edu
cation — emulation can be a spur without being a
threat. And the community of scholars, for teachers
and students alike, rests upon such a foundation
Thef search for "higher skilling" is centrifugal; the
search for liberal education is centripetal. A student
whose aim is self-development or self-improvement
as a human being values grades only as indications
of his own progress, not for any advantage they may
give over others.

(v) As our society becomes increasingly complex,
as specialisms multiply, and as it becomes increas
ingly apparent that the most serious problems ex
tend over many diciplines, it follows, as Professor
Gabriel Almond has observed, that "only higher
order philosophical syntheses can spell out the big
issues and formulate alternative solutions." 10 At the
same time, our society is becoming more and more
susceptible at all levels to the pull of simplistic slo
gans, catchwords, images, stereotypes and
counter-stereotypes. In this situation the need for
critical intelligence and balanced judgment is be
coming more and more acute, yet this need is not
likely to be apparent to the beginning student, par
ticularly if he is bent on acquiring some particular
skill. The SES report quoted approvingly an obser
vation of Professor Edwin M. Good to the effect that
the important simplicities are those which lie "on the
other side of complexity" (Vol. I, p. 11). Surely the
proper inference is that today's student, seeking tp
pick his way through the growing thicket of com
plexities towards some thoughtful and balanced
overview — as opposed to the delusive simplicities
offered by catchwords and fashionable stereotypes
— needs more guidance and direction than ever
before. The claim of the SES committee that today's
student is in a better position than anybody else to
choose the academic path he will take (Vol. I. p. 15)
seems like saying that the thicker the forest be
comes, the less need there is to require would-be
travellers to take a guide.
IV
Recommendations for achieving the aims of lib
eral education generally envisage imposed re
quirements covenng, in addition to courses in En
glish and in a foreign language, a required course or
courses in Western culture or the history of ideas
We are not concerned here with particular prog
rams, but with the sort of objections most commonly
raised against imposing such requirements.
1. It is often claimed that a required course in
Western culture or the history of ideas in the West is
chauvinistic, since it implies the superiority of the
Western tradition above other traditions The objec
tion is misconceived The purpose of studying the
Western tradition is not to celebrate it but to under
stand It — for good or ill. To evaluate Western
culture, or any other culture, without first making the
effort to understand it is to judge irrationally without
adequate evidence Many people make this very
mistake, but the fact that the mistake is common
affords a good reason for trying to correct it.
2. It is often claimed that requiring students to
study any particular subject is arbitrary because no
particular subject is intrinsically more important than
any other One might, so the argument goes, make
as good a case for general requirement in, say,
psychology or the scientific study of human be
havior The answer here is that all heirs of the West
ern tradition — whether specialists or generalists,
students or faculty, regardless of their special in
terests and capacities — are themselves con
ditioned by Western culture The same is true of all
the specialized disciplines which have developed in
the West they all reflect distinctively Western con
ceptions of rationality and the role of systematic
inquiry '' (Xir heritage affects our preconceptions
about the nature and function of scientific know
ledge as well as our preconceptions about values
and norms It is not too much to say that no person
can hope to understand who he or she is without
some understanding of the cultural context, handed
down from prior generations, in which he or she
presently exists Nobody lives, thinks, or talks in a
cultural void Nobody is exempt from cultural influ
ences Hence the peculiar importance of a general
requirement that students systematically examine
the cultural background which they all share
3 It is sometimes objected that a cultural re
quirement would put a premium on conformity to
accepted values We would suggest that the oppo
site is true The dangerous conformities are those
which are blind, unconscious, and uncritical Most
cultures breed rebels as well as conformists, as our

culture has. If a required course in Western culture
is designed (as above noted) to promote the accu
rate understanding of the Western orientation, the
result should be to make both rebels and confor
mists more dearly aware of what it is that they are
rejecting or accepting.
4. It has been objected that there is no reliable
evidence by which we can evaluate the effective
ness of general courses of the kind here envisaged;
hence they should not be required. We grant the
premise but reject the conclusion. The difficulty of
evaluation arises principally, we think, from the fact
that a good educational program has, or should
have, a long-term impact upon the student, and
such impacts are not precisely identifiable or quanti
fiable. To insist too much on precise evaluations
tends to put the emphasis on those short-term be
nefits and immediate satisfaction which can be as
certained, at the expense of the lasting benefits
which can be recognized, if at all, only in retrospect.
However this may be, the present objection cuts
both ways. If we cannot measure in advance the
precise effectiveness of a proposed requirement,
we cannot measure the relative effectiveness of a
program from which such requirements are omitted.
5. It has been claimed that students cannot be
made to learn what they do not wish to learn, or, as
last year s Council of ASSU Presidents put it, "You
can lead a student to a class but you can't make one
think." This position calls for clarification, because it
is highly ambiguous.
Much of what we learn from everyday experience
is not chosen, but forced upon us, often against our
wills, like learning that hot stoves can burn or that
careless driving invites serious accidents. With re
gard to required courses, the evidence is that many
generations of Stanford graduates found value in,
and claim to have profited from, the old course in
Western Civilization despite its having been pre
scribed. Many required courses in other colleges
and universities seem to have had substantial suc
cess. It is evident that the present objection is over
stated.
Perhaps we should interpret it to mean that stu
dents learn better when they study subjects which
they enjoy. There is some truth in this, but there is
also room for a serious confusion. One may enjoy
the process of studying a subject without liking or
approving the subject under study. A medical stu
dent, for example, does not normally enjoy or ap
prove of diseases A student of criminal behavior
does not normally enjoy or approve of crime. Such
students take satisfaction in learning how to cope
with the problems created by disease and crime. So
also a student of Western culture need not like or
approve of Western culture as such in order to find
satisfaction in making a study of it. If this distinction
is kept in mind, a further point emerges, namely, that
nobody can judge whether studying a given subject
will yield satisfaction or prove valuable to him until
after he has engaged in it. Students who view all
required courses as an infringement upon their
freedom of choice sometimes forget that freedom to
make informed choices is not the same as freedom
to make uninformed choices.
It used to be taken lor granted that if students
came to college, it was because they wished to be
made to think, this being accepted as an essential
part of a college education. The present argument,
however, introduces a distinction, as if students
were now saying: "Please give us an education, but
don't make us Slink — or at least, don't make us
think any more than we like or about topics we don't
like." Such a position, if taken seriously, would make
disciplined thinking peripheral rather than central to
the educational process, since disciplined thinking
is usually laborious and the habit of disciplined think
ing can only be acquired, like other skills, by sus
tained practice and fatiguing application.
Finally, it should be noted that when autonomy is
equated with negative freedom in Berlin's sense —
that is to say with freedom from restraints — and
when freedom from restraints is conceived as imply
ing freedom from any imposed norms or standards,
autonomy loses its value As Sartre showed in
Being and Nothingness, freedom without
guidelines is a burden; it is the freedom of the travel
ler lost in the jungle without a map, who can move in
any direction he wishes but has no basis for choos
ing one direction rather than another. From the
psychological point of view, this kind of freedom
results either in existential despair or in a kind of
narcissism which, valuing only sensations and ple
asures of the moment, and fearing the restraint of
any firm commitments, ends by trivalizing the very
pleasures it claims to prize. l 2 It also serves to de
stroy community with others; cooperation among
individuals is impossible where there are no com
monly accepted standards of acceptable and unac
ceptable behavior, because nobody can count on
what others will do. And even the ideal of universal
brotherhood is weakened if it is taken to imply free
dom from any concrete responsibilities to any par
ticular human beings 13
In a society where catchwords tend to replace
critical inquiry, words like freedom' and autonomy
take on a life of their own and acquire a special
emotional force, as if they represented absolute
goods. If autonomy is valuable, we easily assume
that the more autonomy we have the better off we
are, and that a condition of unlimited autonomy must
be best of all But such is not the case Individual
freedom and autonomy are vitally important as in
strumental goods, but to convert them into absolute
goods is to destroy their function.
V
In the foregoing section we have argued that re
quirements, far from being an evil, are, in fact,
necessary for the purposes of a liberal education
Here we may be more specific about requirements
at Stanford.
The Stanford undergraduate curriculum currentty
includes two requirements One is that of the Major,
based on the pnnciple of study in depth This re
quirement was re-examined and reaffirmed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (Campus
Report, 130ct. 1976, p.B). The other is the recently
redefined Distnbution Requirement wtiich aims to
provide the breadth of study necessary for a liberal
eAjcation to yield "a richer personal life through the
development of spaciousness of mind and spirit
The Distribution Requirements exist to ensure ex
posure to different ideas and different ways of think
ing They should enable (one) to understand better
the major ways of knowing,' to assess their
strengths and limitations, to appreciate their un
iqueness, and no less importantly to discern what
they have in common" (DRAT, p 21).
Under the present system, work in the three re
quired areas entails the study of certain works of
creative imagination in their cultural and histoncal
contexts, or of certain problems of philosophy and
belief (Humanities); the study of society, social in
stitutions. and human behavior (Social Saences);
and the study of natural phenomena, technology,
and math (NS/M/T) The stress in each area is upon
approaches, scholarly methods, and the general
human significance of the vanous kinds of study In
addition, for each area, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommends development of
groups of correlated courses; in Humanities the
courses chosen to fulfil the requirement must form a
group which can be certified" by the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (directly approved by the Dean
if the group is chosen by a student, indirectly, if set
up by a department)
The pnnaple of breadth is thus fulfilled by requir

ing a certain amount of study in the three areas into
which human knowledge has been conveniently di
vided. Vet, within each area, a different principle of
order is invoked, and a broad, comprehensive out
look is neither required nor encouraged Moreover,
no principles are stated for the organization of cor re
lated groups or "sequences" within the areas. Nor
has advice been given to departments on the ways
in which they should, in practice, "group" their own
courses or correlate them with courses in other de
partments
In addition, students have not been advised about
the designing of a Humanities program which might
be acceptable to the Doan. Much of the "freedom"
prescribed by SES was predicated on the assump
tion that undergraduate advising, especially for un
declared majors (freshman and sophomore years),
would be vigorous and that the "strongly recom
mended" alternatives and choices would be made
under vigilant academic guidance. Unfortunately,
the faculty, as advisors, cannot peiform the neces
sary academic surveillance given the laissoz fain)
philosophy of the present system.
This loosely structured program may have some
merit in that it recognizes the validity of both syn
chronic and diachronic methods of study, however,
it is impractical and unwittingly misleading. A stu
dent can easily justify the coherence of a group of
three courses, on say, the liteiature, art and society
of fifth-century Athens, or that of a group embracing
the three story-tellers Homer, Dorothy Richardson
and Dostoyevsky, or even that of any three courses
taught by an individual professor.
Are these two requirements — Major and Dis
tribution — an adequate foundation for a liberal
education? We feel that they are not. The student
certainly needs the intellectual methods proper to
the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences which the Distribution Requirement is
supposed to provide. But a good liberal education
has to be more comprehensive. It must include
some systematic study of the fundamental nature
and development of the culture and civilization
within which the student is living and to which he will
someday contribute. It must also provide basic in
formation about the complexities of modern society,
the means to analyse and evaluate that society, and
the perspective necessary to judge it on a compara
tive basis. In addition, the student should have some
knowledge of a culture remote from his own — a
culture outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition, suc h
as Greek or Asian — which will confront him with
ideas that challenge his unconscious assumptions
about his own time and place.
Many who agree in principle with such educa
tional ideals feel that they cannot be achieved. We
disagree. This is a university rich in teaching re
sources which has demonstrated on other occa
sions an ability to make sensible and worthwhile
educational innovations when they have been
needed. They are needed now. Departments and
individual instructors are well-equipped to deal with
the task at hand, and we should certainly draw on
our excellent teaching resources.
The Report of the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford has
suggested certain specific ways in which, through a
program of "tracks," undergraduate education
could achieve the strength and the focus it lacks at
the moment. The Report also mentions the desira
bility of historical and comparative studies whereby
modern Western culture can be confr onted not only
with past stages of its development, but also with
manifestations of other cultures. The program en
visioned by the Report is based partly on existing
courses covering the Western tradition. This prog
ram would allow the student to choose among four
approaches — literature and language; history; re
ligion and philosophy, or the creative and perform
ing arts — all leading to the same goal. This ap
proach would give to each student an educational
program more coherent than the present one.
The appropriate authorities — the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, the Doan of Undar
graduate Studies, the Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (where most under
graduate teaching takes place) — must now de
velop a plan for providing, either through new
courses or through the adaptation of existing
courses, a method for satisfying the educational
needs we have outlined. Those authorities should
also consider how that plan, when in operation,
could be monitored effectively T he responsibility
our University has to its undergraduates and the
obligation it has to its reputation demands that such
action be taken promptly.
Having outlined our views in this general stato
ment, we intend to publish in the next few months a
series of position papers suggesting concrete im
provements to undergraduate education at Stan
ford.

For approximately one year, a group o
humanities faculty members, gathering together tc
discuss issues of mutual concern, has debated the
merits of the present structure of the undergraduate
curriculum at Stanford. Events both local and na
tional have encouraged this sustained debate. The
group has had, moreover, the opportunity to hear, al
its informal sessions, the opinions of some of the
' officers of the University who could be expected to
play key roles in the elaboration of the under
graduate curnculum in future years. Among these
officers have been the President, the Dean ol
Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Under
gracfcjate Studies, and the Dean of Admissions.
What herewith follows is not necessarily a reflec
tion of the attitudes of any one of these officers, nor
of any one faculty member Rather, the group as a
whole would now like to offer to the campus com
munity a statement bearing on the design of that
curnculum. The group recognizes that it possesses
neither final wisdom nor institutional authority in
matters such as these; it also recognizes that exten
sive planning remains to be done before revisions in
the curriculum can be addopted
The group speaks, however, with a sense ol
urgency. It is satisfied neither with the quality of the
intellectual life, nor with the goals and standards of
the undergraduate program. It believes, moreover,
that dissatisfaction, at times expressed and at other
times muted, is a sentiment shared by many faculty
members at Stanford. Nor is such a condition
merely local. Discussion within the group has been
enlivened in the past year by the clear recognition
that the problems Stanford now faces (and must
rigorously attempt to resolve) are problems affect
ing every prestigious institution of higher learning.
That the problems are national in their dimensions is
indicated by, among other things, the special
1974-75 issues of Daedalus (Journal of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences) wherein
eighty-four distinguished educators, including sev
eral from Stanford, speak to the conditions now
defining academic life. Differences among these
educators are certainly present, but all are
frightened, as the editor says, "by what they see as
a lack of concern for intellectual values, others worry
about what they think to be a reduced social con
sciousness." The perspective in which this deep
concern, on both the national level and the local
level, takes place is more serious, of course, than
the question of which course or courses must be
required of the undergraduate. It is more serious
than any particular detail. But details and particulars
will, at the appropriate moment, play their crucial
part when revisions in the curriculum are proposed
and then established. The editor of Daedalus de
scribes the newly emergent situation not as "a re
petition of the discussion that occurred in the middle
of the nineteenth century when a rigid, classically
oriented college curriculum was challenged by the
new theoretical and applied sciences. Much more is
at stake today; the continued viability of the concept
of the liberally-educated person is involved."
About the continued viability the Stanford com
munity has the deepest obligation to be concerned.
In the immediate past, that concern has been ex
pressed by the Report of the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stan
ford. The spirit of that Report, in which a clear com
mitment to a requirement in Western Culture is af
firmed, must be sustained and nourished. Hence
the informal Humanities and Sciences group is
happy to note that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has recently, and unanimously, also en
dorsed "the principle that studies in Western Culture
should be part of each student's education."
Discussions within the group have also been in
vigorated by the understanding that the problems
Stanford now faces are not purely national but are
Stanford's own This university must fulfill the spe
cial obligations it has as a private institution, of great
prestige, within a state and a geography dominated
by non-private institutions Its mission has been,
and is, special; so can be the quality of its under
graduate education. To this obligation President
Richard W. Lyman has often spoken, and most tel
lingly speaks in the pages of Daedalus, where he
says
We who are responsible for the continuing
health of our "little platoons" — and even
the greatest of the private universities are
"little platoons" when matched against the
dimensions of state-supported higher edu
cation — we have our work cut out for us...
one virture that ought to be within the reach
of independent institutions, be they old or
new, famous or obscure, is that of rigorous
self-definition.
It is to that rigor arte 1 that self-definition that Stan
ford's attention must now turn Prompted, then, by
both the national anxiety and concern, and opposed
to the idle, helpless notion that little can be done in
the face of curricular and intellectual complexity, this
statement is offered to the Stanford community It is
hoped that it will play some effective part in discus
sions within the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
and the Academic Senate.
The pnnciples underlying the 1968 Study of Edu
cation at Stanford are treated here first. That Study
predates the Report of the Committee on the Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
and by virtue of the seriousness and thoughtfulness
with which it was undertaken, has achieved a con
siderable weight in later discussions of curricular
reform But as the Study itself observes, its spirit
was one of "self-examination and self-renewal." It
further observes that "the study of education must
become a process rather than event." Eight years
have since passed: changes now seem wholly
proper and necessary In the light, then, of such
changes to be made, a second matter for discussion
follows the first It is a consideration of the newly
formulated system of distnbution requirements. Al
though that system is the product of much labor on
the part of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, it does not coherently and directly address
the fundamental inadequacies of the present cur
ncular program for the undergraduate student, it is a
system that is too diffuse and too loosely monitored
to be able to do so Only by a program that is more
coherently structured can the mtellecuual life of the
Stanford student be made more challenging, in
tense, and rewarding
II
The basic philosophy of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). published in 1968-69, was that of
educational laissez fairs This is reflected in two
parallel pronouncements, the first of which ap
peared in the general introductory section of the
report and the second in the section on under
graduate education
"Let fie objectrve of curncular planning be
to encourage the faculty member to teach
what he likes to teach and the student to
learn what seems vital to him — the Intellec
tual History of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century rather than the History of Western
Civilization Modern Consciousness rather
than Freshman English. Organizational Be
havior rather than Introduction to Sociology
— and from this common freedom may
emerge a form of general education far bet
ter suited to the cftaractennbcs of a umver
slty than that to which we pay lip service

now." (Vol. I, p. 14)
And again:
"The objective toward which curriculum
planning should strive is, to the extent pos
sible, to let the teacher teach what he wants
to teach and the student learn what he
wants to learn." (Vol. II, p. 12)
Now philosophies of laissez faire can be arrived at
in different ways and supported or defended on
different grounds. Having in mind Isaiah Berlin's
significant distinction between positive and negative
conceptions of freedom — possitive freedom being
freedom for the achievement of some end deemed
desirable, negative freedom being freedom from
restraint on the assumption that restraint is wrong in
itself 1 — we can roughly distinguish between posi
tive and negative philosophies of laissez faire.
Adam Smith's views concerning economic be
havior were positive in this sense, not because they
were necessarily correct, but because they were
based on extensive inquiries into the nature of
wealth, the nature of human motivation and be
havior, and a clear belief in the desirability of the
conditions to which he thought a free market
economy would contribute. One may, of course,
quarrel with his views, but the fact remains that he
had a carefully worked out theory of social welfare
and advocated free enterprise as the best means of
achieving it. It is not inconceivable that a positive
doctrine of educational laissez faire might be simi
larly grounded on some carefully worked out and
coherent theory of the objectives, functions, and
social impact of higher education. But SES failed to
provide any such theory Instead it provided a nega
tive philosophy of laissez faire based on the view
that in higher education, restraints of any kind are
inherently bad. Moreover, this view was itself based
on a curiously narrow and dubious line of argument
which calls for special attention and comment.
The SES committee took the position that it ought
to base its "proposed reponses to the problems of
education at Stanford on careful consideration of
the meaning of education for individual teacher and
student and of the nature of the university" (Vol. I, p.
8). So far, so good. But it then proceeded to deal
with these questions, not by considering the general
objectives, functions and possible impact of higher
education in and on today's society, nor by consider
ing the important "new dimensions" which it had
cited in the opening sentence of its report as having
been introduced by the student unrest of the 1960's.
Instead, the Committee attempted to deal with all
these questions by the simple expedient of examin
ing the etymology of the single world, education '
The Committee established its "basic premises" i

as follows:
To establish our basic premises we must
begin with our conceptions of education and
of a university. The world 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educere meaning to
lead forth.' To lead does not mean to com
pel, or to push, or to pull. It means quite
simply what it says.. (1,10)
On this foundation it was immediately concluded
(among other things) that education "can never be
compelled nor can knowledge be impressed on a
mind unwilling to learn if it is to be more than indoc
trination'' (I, 10). It was also inferred (without any
corresponding concern for the etymology of the
word "university") that "the University can nevei
educate in the true sense of the word, but it can
supply the environment and the means necessary
to insure that those who came here may educate
each other and themselves'' (I, 10). In short, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, the weight of the
whole report seems to have rested upon the pre
sumed etymology of the word educate.'
The deficiences of this approach are obvious:
1 Words change their meanings. Hence even i
this particular etymology were adequately stated, i
could give no more than a tentative and partial hin
as to the present meaning of the word "education."
2. Given a complex enterprise like that of moderr
education, many different words are involved. If we
are to rely on etymology, we ought surely to con
sider also the etymologies of a variety of other En
glish words which are relevant to education, such as
learning, training, study, scholarship, instruction,
teaching, tutoring, lecturing, research, etc. These
would yield different results, reflecting the simple
fact that education has many facets, and dimen
sions, which cannot be captured by looking at any
simplified etymology of any single word.
3. On the Latin side, we should note first that in
addition to the verb educere (3rd conjugation) on
which the SES committee chose to rely, there was
another related Latin verb, educare (Ist conjuga
tion) meaning 'to train, to rear, to bring up ' It is from
the latter (and its nouneducatfo) that our word edu
cation' is most immediately derived. Secondly, the
Romans had several other verbs which they applied
to the process of education, including instituere,
instruere, and erudire. None of these suggests to
lead forth ; the first two suggested the idea of estab
lishing,' constructing' or setting in order, while the
last implied making smooth.'
Thus the committee's central line of argument —
the first among its "basic premises" — must be
rejected as wholly misconceived This fact does not,
of course, necessarily refute the laissez faire
philosophy which the committee derived from it; as
previously observed, that philosophy might con
ceivably be supported on other grounds. However,
since no other basis was supplied, the committee's
general conclusion stands unsupported. We are left
with, at best, a negative theory of laissez faire — a
theory which might as well have been adopted out of
sheer inertia or even from an impulse to deflate
student po'itical demands by making educational
concessions 2 On this view, educational restraints
are wrong primarily because they are burdensome
and because they are disliked. Eliminating require
ments is good because freedom is good, in and of
itself If teachers are free to teach what they want to
teach and students are free to learn what they want
to leam, we may trust that everybody will benefit and
that the proper interests of society will be served
111
The question now is whether that trust has been
vindicated or discredited The indications are
mounting that it has been discredited — that the kind
of educational laissez faire recommended by the
SES report has already been found seriously defi
cient Several emerging difficulties call for particular
attention.
1 The problem of standards
Derek Bok, President of Harvard University (and
a Stanford alumnus) began a recent article "On the
Purposes of Undergraduate Education' (Daedalus.
Fall, 1974, pp 159-172) as follows
"Scholars who study the behavior of
human organizations constantly stress the
importance of defining institutional goals
Without dear objectives, it is said, an mstitu
tion cannot evaluate how well it is perform
ing, decide how to allocate its resources
wisely, plan for future growth, motivate its
members, or justify its existence to the
larger public
"Despite these admonitions, our colleges
seem to exist without making much of an
effort to define their aims In the thick reports
on undergraduate education that many col
leges have produced in recent years, there
is little discuMion of what it is that a liberal
arts education should provide for me stu-

dent. The prevailing sentiment is captured
by the statement of a curriculum committee
in one of our most distinguished univer
sities: The objective toward which cur
riculum planning should strive is, to the ex
tent possible, to let the teacher teach what
he wants to teach and the student learn
t what he wants to learn.' "
It should be noted lhat the concluding sentence,
cited as exemplifying a prevalent defiaency, is bor
rowed from the SES report; it is the second of the
two excerpts quoted at the beginning of this paper
Bok's point is that the SES philosophy of laissez
faire provides no standards for directing or evaluat
ing any aspect of the academic enterprise, or judg
ing academic performance. If the controlling objec
tive is to allow teachers and students to do whatever
they prefer, why should the university not provide
instruction in basketweaving? If it be replied that
accepted standards of academic excellence and
competence are assumed, the question arises
where such standards originate and how they are
maintained. To the extent that they are needed, the
laissez faire philosophy is thereby shown to be in
adequate
It is one thing to maintain that teachers should
enjoy teaching and that students should enjoy learn
ing, but it is something else to say that immediate
enjoyment — which can vary according to the fash
ions of the day — is to be taken as the primary
measure of academic success. It is perhaps worth
remarking that while the SES report relied on Alfred
North Whitehead's observation that the University's
justification is to preserve "the connection between
knowledge and the zest of life, by uniting the young
and the old in the imaginative consideration of learn
ing" (SES, I, 10) it failed to note that in the same
essay (as well as elsewhere in his writings on edu
cation) Whitehead stressed the need for a "discip
line of imagination" so that the superior vigor of the
young should be tempered by the superior experi
ence of the elders. The persistent problem of educa
tion, in Whitehead's view, is to combine discipline
and imagination so that neither destroys the other.
In his words, "qualities essential at a later stage of a
career are apt to be stamped out in an earlier stage
This is only an instance of the more general fact, that
technical excellence can only be acquired by a train
ing which is apt to damage those energies of mind
which should direct the technical skill. This is the key
fact in education, and the reason for most of its
difficulties." 3
2. Problems of specialization and vocationalism
The Harvard report of 1945, General Education in
a Free Society, probably the most widely influential t
report on higher issued in the decadea
immediate following World War II, devoted most of
its attention to a discussion of the purposes and
functions of education in a free society, "It is fruit
less," the Harvard committee wrote, "to think about
any such practical step as a curriculum without hav
ing in mind specifications or points of reference, in
this case the ends toward which the curriculum
should look and the students for whom it is in
tended." 4
The main problems of education were there attri
buted to three sources: first, the progressive expan
sion of knowledge with the attendant multiplication
of specialisms and sub-specialisms in all areas;
second, the great increase in the number of college
students as opportunities for education beyond the
high-school were extended from the privileged few
and made available to young people at large; and
third, to the increasing complexity of modern society
itself. To cope with these problems, the Harvard
committee felt that education at the college level
ought to perform a dual role. It must, on the one
hand, fully recognize the need for increasing
specialization and provide a foundation for students
going on to careers or vocations requiring particular
skills in diverse areas. But it must at the same time
seek to balance the fragmentation and atomization
threatened by the multiplication of specialties by
finding some unifying dimension or dimensions. It
was concluded that the latter function required re
newed stress on the sort of education that had been
traditionally called "liberal education," specifically
the kind of education designed to develop the
natural capacities of the student as a human being
regardless of the particular social role which he or
she might subsequently fill. "Our conclusion, then,"
wrote the Harvard committee in 1945," is that the
aim of education should be to prepare an individual
to become an expert both in some particular voca
tion or art and in the general art of the free man and
the citizen. Thus the two kinds of education once
given separately to different social classes must be
given to all alike." 5
These views are cited not to suggest that the
curricular innovations recommended by the Har
vard committee in 1945 accomplished their purpose
(which is open to serious debate) but to show that
the committee identified — and tried to meet —
three problems which became more and more pres
sing in the ensuing years Among these, the con
tinued multiplication of specialisms with spreading
emphasis on the importance to the student of de
veloping marketable skills, at a high level of sophis
tication, has proved perhaps the most intractable
One way to deal with this problem is, of course, to do
nothing — to drift with the prevailing current rather
than attempt to swim against it. The SES report, with
its philosophy of laissez faire, does exactly that
Since increasing specialism is the order of the day.
and since competent scholars are specialists, it can
be claimed, "realism" dictates that we accept that
fact, adapting our education to it and letting
threatened dangers take care of themselves But
some of those threatened dangers have already
become actual.

(i) As the opinion spreads that the main function of
higher education is to develop in the student mar
ketable skills — what Steven Miller, President of
Johns Hopkins, calls "higher skilling" as opposed to
higher education 8 — for a job market which is al
ready oversaturated, the value of a college educa
tion is necessanly depreciated. If it were recog
nized, however, that the chief function of a college
education is to develop the human potential of the
student without regard to the particular job he or she
might eventually hold or the particular social role he
or she might occupy, the result would be otherwise
Success or failure in the job market would not be
considered so crucial There is here an illustration of
the point made before, that the objectives (or sup
posed objectives) of education always provide the
criteria for evaluating success or failure
(ii) In regard to the nature and status if knowledge,
Steven Muller, in the article just mentioned, asked
the pregnant question If all our scholars are stand
ing at the frontiers of knowledge, who is standing at
the center? Is there today any center? If not, how
can there be any community of scholars in the tradi
tional sense?
Under present conditions, there is no genuine
community of teachers or students in any college or
university, but rather an aggregate of specialists
and students, each pursuing his or her own sepa
rate interests in geographical proximity, with little or
no basis for cross-disciplinary communication or
understanding One consequence is that most scho
lars feel more affinity with, and more respect for,
their professional colleagues in other universities
than for members of other departments in their own
And there is no longer any unity of knowledge, but
only a collocation of separate knowledges Such a
situation may. perhaps, be defended certainly it is
preferable to an ideological uniformity arbitrarily im
posed But surety there is a middle ground between

these extremes. Muller considers that some return
to general education, with universal requirements
for English, for a second language, for cultural his
tory, and for science, is necessary to restore the
un 'ty of genuine education.
What all our scholars in different disciplines have
in common is that they are all human beings, that
they all share the same cultural inheritance, and that
they are all engaged (or should be) in the same
quest — the quest for greater knowledge and wider
understanding. And we do well, we believe, to recall
the observation of Arthur Lovejoy that he who knows
only his own special field may not know what is most
worth looking lor in his special field. 7
#ii) An extensive investigation recently conducted
byktwo ecfcjcation reporters of the Los Angeles
Tunes into the concurrent phenomena of progres
sive grade inflation along with progressive decline in
the average level of students' proficiency has been
the widespread substitution of new elective
oourses, sometimes lacking in academic rigor, for
the kind of basic courses which used to be required
for all students. 8 Though the demonstration is not
conclusive, it is at least persuasively documented
As against suggestions that the decline in test
scores is due to other causes — such as altered
family structures, the increased number of less qual
ified students, regional factors, or the unreliability of
test scores — the authors of the report point out that
the two areas where test scores have not declined
but held steady or advanced are the areas in which
basic requirements have been largely retained, i.e.,
in the first three primary grades in school and in the
sciences at post-secondary level. These investiga
tions, which are too long to summanze, are worth
senous attention. At least, they cannot be ignored,
despite the attempts of some educators to dismiss
or discount them.
(iv) There is clear evidence that college students
today resent the increasingly competitive atmos
phere of post-secondary education. 9 It seems to be
a fair inference that the competitive aspect reflects
the increasing emphasis in higher education upon
the development of marketable skills. When stu
dents are competing for entrance to professional
schools or for jobs requiring technical proficiency,
and when good grades are seen as important for
Stich purposes, the process of college education
naturally comes to be seen as a struggle of each
against all; for admission to a limited number of
'ftllure positions. But liberal education, in the tradi
tional sense, has a different character. The
philosopher Spinoza pointed out that intellectual
goods sought for their own sake are non-
C9mpetitive. If one person achieves wisdom or in
creased insight, he is not threatened but reinforced
if his neighbors do likewise. Here is one major dif
ference between virtues of character and technical
skills, at least where the latter determine job oppor
tunities. Nothing is so useful or agreeable to the
virtuous man, Spinoza wrote, as the company of
others who are like-minded. Where self-realization
or self-improvement is the aim rather than voca
tional proficiency — as is the case with liberal edu
cation — emulation can be a spur without being a
threat. And the community of scholars, for teachers
and students alike, rests upon such a foundation
Thef search for "higher skilling" is centrifugal; the
search for liberal education is centripetal. A student
whose aim is self-development or self-improvement
as a human being values grades only as indications
of his own progress, not for any advantage they may
give over others.

(v) As our society becomes increasingly complex,
as specialisms multiply, and as it becomes increas
ingly apparent that the most serious problems ex
tend over many diciplines, it follows, as Professor
Gabriel Almond has observed, that "only higher
order philosophical syntheses can spell out the big
issues and formulate alternative solutions." 10 At the
same time, our society is becoming more and more
susceptible at all levels to the pull of simplistic slo
gans, catchwords, images, stereotypes and
counter-stereotypes. In this situation the need for
critical intelligence and balanced judgment is be
coming more and more acute, yet this need is not
likely to be apparent to the beginning student, par
ticularly if he is bent on acquiring some particular
skill. The SES report quoted approvingly an obser
vation of Professor Edwin M. Good to the effect that
the important simplicities are those which lie "on the
other side of complexity" (Vol. I, p. 11). Surely the
proper inference is that today's student, seeking tp
pick his way through the growing thicket of com
plexities towards some thoughtful and balanced
overview — as opposed to the delusive simplicities
offered by catchwords and fashionable stereotypes
— needs more guidance and direction than ever
before. The claim of the SES committee that today's
student is in a better position than anybody else to
choose the academic path he will take (Vol. I. p. 15)
seems like saying that the thicker the forest be
comes, the less need there is to require would-be
travellers to take a guide.
IV
Recommendations for achieving the aims of lib
eral education generally envisage imposed re
quirements covenng, in addition to courses in En
glish and in a foreign language, a required course or
courses in Western culture or the history of ideas
We are not concerned here with particular prog
rams, but with the sort of objections most commonly
raised against imposing such requirements.
1. It is often claimed that a required course in
Western culture or the history of ideas in the West is
chauvinistic, since it implies the superiority of the
Western tradition above other traditions The objec
tion is misconceived The purpose of studying the
Western tradition is not to celebrate it but to under
stand It — for good or ill. To evaluate Western
culture, or any other culture, without first making the
effort to understand it is to judge irrationally without
adequate evidence Many people make this very
mistake, but the fact that the mistake is common
affords a good reason for trying to correct it.
2. It is often claimed that requiring students to
study any particular subject is arbitrary because no
particular subject is intrinsically more important than
any other One might, so the argument goes, make
as good a case for general requirement in, say,
psychology or the scientific study of human be
havior The answer here is that all heirs of the West
ern tradition — whether specialists or generalists,
students or faculty, regardless of their special in
terests and capacities — are themselves con
ditioned by Western culture The same is true of all
the specialized disciplines which have developed in
the West they all reflect distinctively Western con
ceptions of rationality and the role of systematic
inquiry '' (Xir heritage affects our preconceptions
about the nature and function of scientific know
ledge as well as our preconceptions about values
and norms It is not too much to say that no person
can hope to understand who he or she is without
some understanding of the cultural context, handed
down from prior generations, in which he or she
presently exists Nobody lives, thinks, or talks in a
cultural void Nobody is exempt from cultural influ
ences Hence the peculiar importance of a general
requirement that students systematically examine
the cultural background which they all share
3 It is sometimes objected that a cultural re
quirement would put a premium on conformity to
accepted values We would suggest that the oppo
site is true The dangerous conformities are those
which are blind, unconscious, and uncritical Most
cultures breed rebels as well as conformists, as our

culture has. If a required course in Western culture
is designed (as above noted) to promote the accu
rate understanding of the Western orientation, the
result should be to make both rebels and confor
mists more dearly aware of what it is that they are
rejecting or accepting.
4. It has been objected that there is no reliable
evidence by which we can evaluate the effective
ness of general courses of the kind here envisaged;
hence they should not be required. We grant the
premise but reject the conclusion. The difficulty of
evaluation arises principally, we think, from the fact
that a good educational program has, or should
have, a long-term impact upon the student, and
such impacts are not precisely identifiable or quanti
fiable. To insist too much on precise evaluations
tends to put the emphasis on those short-term be
nefits and immediate satisfaction which can be as
certained, at the expense of the lasting benefits
which can be recognized, if at all, only in retrospect.
However this may be, the present objection cuts
both ways. If we cannot measure in advance the
precise effectiveness of a proposed requirement,
we cannot measure the relative effectiveness of a
program from which such requirements are omitted.
5. It has been claimed that students cannot be
made to learn what they do not wish to learn, or, as
last year s Council of ASSU Presidents put it, "You
can lead a student to a class but you can't make one
think." This position calls for clarification, because it
is highly ambiguous.
Much of what we learn from everyday experience
is not chosen, but forced upon us, often against our
wills, like learning that hot stoves can burn or that
careless driving invites serious accidents. With re
gard to required courses, the evidence is that many
generations of Stanford graduates found value in,
and claim to have profited from, the old course in
Western Civilization despite its having been pre
scribed. Many required courses in other colleges
and universities seem to have had substantial suc
cess. It is evident that the present objection is over
stated.
Perhaps we should interpret it to mean that stu
dents learn better when they study subjects which
they enjoy. There is some truth in this, but there is
also room for a serious confusion. One may enjoy
the process of studying a subject without liking or
approving the subject under study. A medical stu
dent, for example, does not normally enjoy or ap
prove of diseases A student of criminal behavior
does not normally enjoy or approve of crime. Such
students take satisfaction in learning how to cope
with the problems created by disease and crime. So
also a student of Western culture need not like or
approve of Western culture as such in order to find
satisfaction in making a study of it. If this distinction
is kept in mind, a further point emerges, namely, that
nobody can judge whether studying a given subject
will yield satisfaction or prove valuable to him until
after he has engaged in it. Students who view all
required courses as an infringement upon their
freedom of choice sometimes forget that freedom to
make informed choices is not the same as freedom
to make uninformed choices.
It used to be taken lor granted that if students
came to college, it was because they wished to be
made to think, this being accepted as an essential
part of a college education. The present argument,
however, introduces a distinction, as if students
were now saying: "Please give us an education, but
don't make us Slink — or at least, don't make us
think any more than we like or about topics we don't
like." Such a position, if taken seriously, would make
disciplined thinking peripheral rather than central to
the educational process, since disciplined thinking
is usually laborious and the habit of disciplined think
ing can only be acquired, like other skills, by sus
tained practice and fatiguing application.
Finally, it should be noted that when autonomy is
equated with negative freedom in Berlin's sense —
that is to say with freedom from restraints — and
when freedom from restraints is conceived as imply
ing freedom from any imposed norms or standards,
autonomy loses its value As Sartre showed in
Being and Nothingness, freedom without
guidelines is a burden; it is the freedom of the travel
ler lost in the jungle without a map, who can move in
any direction he wishes but has no basis for choos
ing one direction rather than another. From the
psychological point of view, this kind of freedom
results either in existential despair or in a kind of
narcissism which, valuing only sensations and ple
asures of the moment, and fearing the restraint of
any firm commitments, ends by trivalizing the very
pleasures it claims to prize. l 2 It also serves to de
stroy community with others; cooperation among
individuals is impossible where there are no com
monly accepted standards of acceptable and unac
ceptable behavior, because nobody can count on
what others will do. And even the ideal of universal
brotherhood is weakened if it is taken to imply free
dom from any concrete responsibilities to any par
ticular human beings 13
In a society where catchwords tend to replace
critical inquiry, words like freedom' and autonomy
take on a life of their own and acquire a special
emotional force, as if they represented absolute
goods. If autonomy is valuable, we easily assume
that the more autonomy we have the better off we
are, and that a condition of unlimited autonomy must
be best of all But such is not the case Individual
freedom and autonomy are vitally important as in
strumental goods, but to convert them into absolute
goods is to destroy their function.
V
In the foregoing section we have argued that re
quirements, far from being an evil, are, in fact,
necessary for the purposes of a liberal education
Here we may be more specific about requirements
at Stanford.
The Stanford undergraduate curriculum currentty
includes two requirements One is that of the Major,
based on the pnnciple of study in depth This re
quirement was re-examined and reaffirmed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (Campus
Report, 130ct. 1976, p.B). The other is the recently
redefined Distnbution Requirement wtiich aims to
provide the breadth of study necessary for a liberal
eAjcation to yield "a richer personal life through the
development of spaciousness of mind and spirit
The Distribution Requirements exist to ensure ex
posure to different ideas and different ways of think
ing They should enable (one) to understand better
the major ways of knowing,' to assess their
strengths and limitations, to appreciate their un
iqueness, and no less importantly to discern what
they have in common" (DRAT, p 21).
Under the present system, work in the three re
quired areas entails the study of certain works of
creative imagination in their cultural and histoncal
contexts, or of certain problems of philosophy and
belief (Humanities); the study of society, social in
stitutions. and human behavior (Social Saences);
and the study of natural phenomena, technology,
and math (NS/M/T) The stress in each area is upon
approaches, scholarly methods, and the general
human significance of the vanous kinds of study In
addition, for each area, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommends development of
groups of correlated courses; in Humanities the
courses chosen to fulfil the requirement must form a
group which can be certified" by the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (directly approved by the Dean
if the group is chosen by a student, indirectly, if set
up by a department)
The pnnaple of breadth is thus fulfilled by requir

ing a certain amount of study in the three areas into
which human knowledge has been conveniently di
vided. Vet, within each area, a different principle of
order is invoked, and a broad, comprehensive out
look is neither required nor encouraged Moreover,
no principles are stated for the organization of cor re
lated groups or "sequences" within the areas. Nor
has advice been given to departments on the ways
in which they should, in practice, "group" their own
courses or correlate them with courses in other de
partments
In addition, students have not been advised about
the designing of a Humanities program which might
be acceptable to the Doan. Much of the "freedom"
prescribed by SES was predicated on the assump
tion that undergraduate advising, especially for un
declared majors (freshman and sophomore years),
would be vigorous and that the "strongly recom
mended" alternatives and choices would be made
under vigilant academic guidance. Unfortunately,
the faculty, as advisors, cannot peiform the neces
sary academic surveillance given the laissoz fain)
philosophy of the present system.
This loosely structured program may have some
merit in that it recognizes the validity of both syn
chronic and diachronic methods of study, however,
it is impractical and unwittingly misleading. A stu
dent can easily justify the coherence of a group of
three courses, on say, the liteiature, art and society
of fifth-century Athens, or that of a group embracing
the three story-tellers Homer, Dorothy Richardson
and Dostoyevsky, or even that of any three courses
taught by an individual professor.
Are these two requirements — Major and Dis
tribution — an adequate foundation for a liberal
education? We feel that they are not. The student
certainly needs the intellectual methods proper to
the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences which the Distribution Requirement is
supposed to provide. But a good liberal education
has to be more comprehensive. It must include
some systematic study of the fundamental nature
and development of the culture and civilization
within which the student is living and to which he will
someday contribute. It must also provide basic in
formation about the complexities of modern society,
the means to analyse and evaluate that society, and
the perspective necessary to judge it on a compara
tive basis. In addition, the student should have some
knowledge of a culture remote from his own — a
culture outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition, suc h
as Greek or Asian — which will confront him with
ideas that challenge his unconscious assumptions
about his own time and place.
Many who agree in principle with such educa
tional ideals feel that they cannot be achieved. We
disagree. This is a university rich in teaching re
sources which has demonstrated on other occa
sions an ability to make sensible and worthwhile
educational innovations when they have been
needed. They are needed now. Departments and
individual instructors are well-equipped to deal with
the task at hand, and we should certainly draw on
our excellent teaching resources.
The Report of the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford has
suggested certain specific ways in which, through a
program of "tracks," undergraduate education
could achieve the strength and the focus it lacks at
the moment. The Report also mentions the desira
bility of historical and comparative studies whereby
modern Western culture can be confr onted not only
with past stages of its development, but also with
manifestations of other cultures. The program en
visioned by the Report is based partly on existing
courses covering the Western tradition. This prog
ram would allow the student to choose among four
approaches — literature and language; history; re
ligion and philosophy, or the creative and perform
ing arts — all leading to the same goal. This ap
proach would give to each student an educational
program more coherent than the present one.
The appropriate authorities — the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, the Doan of Undar
graduate Studies, the Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (where most under
graduate teaching takes place) — must now de
velop a plan for providing, either through new
courses or through the adaptation of existing
courses, a method for satisfying the educational
needs we have outlined. Those authorities should
also consider how that plan, when in operation,
could be monitored effectively T he responsibility
our University has to its undergraduates and the
obligation it has to its reputation demands that such
action be taken promptly.
Having outlined our views in this general stato
ment, we intend to publish in the next few months a
series of position papers suggesting concrete im
provements to undergraduate education at Stan
ford.

For approximately one year, a group o
humanities faculty members, gathering together tc
discuss issues of mutual concern, has debated the
merits of the present structure of the undergraduate
curriculum at Stanford. Events both local and na
tional have encouraged this sustained debate. The
group has had, moreover, the opportunity to hear, al
its informal sessions, the opinions of some of the
' officers of the University who could be expected to
play key roles in the elaboration of the under
graduate curnculum in future years. Among these
officers have been the President, the Dean ol
Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Under
gracfcjate Studies, and the Dean of Admissions.
What herewith follows is not necessarily a reflec
tion of the attitudes of any one of these officers, nor
of any one faculty member Rather, the group as a
whole would now like to offer to the campus com
munity a statement bearing on the design of that
curnculum. The group recognizes that it possesses
neither final wisdom nor institutional authority in
matters such as these; it also recognizes that exten
sive planning remains to be done before revisions in
the curriculum can be addopted
The group speaks, however, with a sense ol
urgency. It is satisfied neither with the quality of the
intellectual life, nor with the goals and standards of
the undergraduate program. It believes, moreover,
that dissatisfaction, at times expressed and at other
times muted, is a sentiment shared by many faculty
members at Stanford. Nor is such a condition
merely local. Discussion within the group has been
enlivened in the past year by the clear recognition
that the problems Stanford now faces (and must
rigorously attempt to resolve) are problems affect
ing every prestigious institution of higher learning.
That the problems are national in their dimensions is
indicated by, among other things, the special
1974-75 issues of Daedalus (Journal of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences) wherein
eighty-four distinguished educators, including sev
eral from Stanford, speak to the conditions now
defining academic life. Differences among these
educators are certainly present, but all are
frightened, as the editor says, "by what they see as
a lack of concern for intellectual values, others worry
about what they think to be a reduced social con
sciousness." The perspective in which this deep
concern, on both the national level and the local
level, takes place is more serious, of course, than
the question of which course or courses must be
required of the undergraduate. It is more serious
than any particular detail. But details and particulars
will, at the appropriate moment, play their crucial
part when revisions in the curriculum are proposed
and then established. The editor of Daedalus de
scribes the newly emergent situation not as "a re
petition of the discussion that occurred in the middle
of the nineteenth century when a rigid, classically
oriented college curriculum was challenged by the
new theoretical and applied sciences. Much more is
at stake today; the continued viability of the concept
of the liberally-educated person is involved."
About the continued viability the Stanford com
munity has the deepest obligation to be concerned.
In the immediate past, that concern has been ex
pressed by the Report of the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stan
ford. The spirit of that Report, in which a clear com
mitment to a requirement in Western Culture is af
firmed, must be sustained and nourished. Hence
the informal Humanities and Sciences group is
happy to note that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has recently, and unanimously, also en
dorsed "the principle that studies in Western Culture
should be part of each student's education."
Discussions within the group have also been in
vigorated by the understanding that the problems
Stanford now faces are not purely national but are
Stanford's own This university must fulfill the spe
cial obligations it has as a private institution, of great
prestige, within a state and a geography dominated
by non-private institutions Its mission has been,
and is, special; so can be the quality of its under
graduate education. To this obligation President
Richard W. Lyman has often spoken, and most tel
lingly speaks in the pages of Daedalus, where he
says
We who are responsible for the continuing
health of our "little platoons" — and even
the greatest of the private universities are
"little platoons" when matched against the
dimensions of state-supported higher edu
cation — we have our work cut out for us...
one virture that ought to be within the reach
of independent institutions, be they old or
new, famous or obscure, is that of rigorous
self-definition.
It is to that rigor arte 1 that self-definition that Stan
ford's attention must now turn Prompted, then, by
both the national anxiety and concern, and opposed
to the idle, helpless notion that little can be done in
the face of curricular and intellectual complexity, this
statement is offered to the Stanford community It is
hoped that it will play some effective part in discus
sions within the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
and the Academic Senate.
The pnnciples underlying the 1968 Study of Edu
cation at Stanford are treated here first. That Study
predates the Report of the Committee on the Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
and by virtue of the seriousness and thoughtfulness
with which it was undertaken, has achieved a con
siderable weight in later discussions of curricular
reform But as the Study itself observes, its spirit
was one of "self-examination and self-renewal." It
further observes that "the study of education must
become a process rather than event." Eight years
have since passed: changes now seem wholly
proper and necessary In the light, then, of such
changes to be made, a second matter for discussion
follows the first It is a consideration of the newly
formulated system of distnbution requirements. Al
though that system is the product of much labor on
the part of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, it does not coherently and directly address
the fundamental inadequacies of the present cur
ncular program for the undergraduate student, it is a
system that is too diffuse and too loosely monitored
to be able to do so Only by a program that is more
coherently structured can the mtellecuual life of the
Stanford student be made more challenging, in
tense, and rewarding
II
The basic philosophy of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). published in 1968-69, was that of
educational laissez fairs This is reflected in two
parallel pronouncements, the first of which ap
peared in the general introductory section of the
report and the second in the section on under
graduate education
"Let fie objectrve of curncular planning be
to encourage the faculty member to teach
what he likes to teach and the student to
learn what seems vital to him — the Intellec
tual History of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century rather than the History of Western
Civilization Modern Consciousness rather
than Freshman English. Organizational Be
havior rather than Introduction to Sociology
— and from this common freedom may
emerge a form of general education far bet
ter suited to the cftaractennbcs of a umver
slty than that to which we pay lip service

now." (Vol. I, p. 14)
And again:
"The objective toward which curriculum
planning should strive is, to the extent pos
sible, to let the teacher teach what he wants
to teach and the student learn what he
wants to learn." (Vol. II, p. 12)
Now philosophies of laissez faire can be arrived at
in different ways and supported or defended on
different grounds. Having in mind Isaiah Berlin's
significant distinction between positive and negative
conceptions of freedom — possitive freedom being
freedom for the achievement of some end deemed
desirable, negative freedom being freedom from
restraint on the assumption that restraint is wrong in
itself 1 — we can roughly distinguish between posi
tive and negative philosophies of laissez faire.
Adam Smith's views concerning economic be
havior were positive in this sense, not because they
were necessarily correct, but because they were
based on extensive inquiries into the nature of
wealth, the nature of human motivation and be
havior, and a clear belief in the desirability of the
conditions to which he thought a free market
economy would contribute. One may, of course,
quarrel with his views, but the fact remains that he
had a carefully worked out theory of social welfare
and advocated free enterprise as the best means of
achieving it. It is not inconceivable that a positive
doctrine of educational laissez faire might be simi
larly grounded on some carefully worked out and
coherent theory of the objectives, functions, and
social impact of higher education. But SES failed to
provide any such theory Instead it provided a nega
tive philosophy of laissez faire based on the view
that in higher education, restraints of any kind are
inherently bad. Moreover, this view was itself based
on a curiously narrow and dubious line of argument
which calls for special attention and comment.
The SES committee took the position that it ought
to base its "proposed reponses to the problems of
education at Stanford on careful consideration of
the meaning of education for individual teacher and
student and of the nature of the university" (Vol. I, p.
8). So far, so good. But it then proceeded to deal
with these questions, not by considering the general
objectives, functions and possible impact of higher
education in and on today's society, nor by consider
ing the important "new dimensions" which it had
cited in the opening sentence of its report as having
been introduced by the student unrest of the 1960's.
Instead, the Committee attempted to deal with all
these questions by the simple expedient of examin
ing the etymology of the single world, education '
The Committee established its "basic premises" i

as follows:
To establish our basic premises we must
begin with our conceptions of education and
of a university. The world 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educere meaning to
lead forth.' To lead does not mean to com
pel, or to push, or to pull. It means quite
simply what it says.. (1,10)
On this foundation it was immediately concluded
(among other things) that education "can never be
compelled nor can knowledge be impressed on a
mind unwilling to learn if it is to be more than indoc
trination'' (I, 10). It was also inferred (without any
corresponding concern for the etymology of the
word "university") that "the University can nevei
educate in the true sense of the word, but it can
supply the environment and the means necessary
to insure that those who came here may educate
each other and themselves'' (I, 10). In short, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, the weight of the
whole report seems to have rested upon the pre
sumed etymology of the word educate.'
The deficiences of this approach are obvious:
1 Words change their meanings. Hence even i
this particular etymology were adequately stated, i
could give no more than a tentative and partial hin
as to the present meaning of the word "education."
2. Given a complex enterprise like that of moderr
education, many different words are involved. If we
are to rely on etymology, we ought surely to con
sider also the etymologies of a variety of other En
glish words which are relevant to education, such as
learning, training, study, scholarship, instruction,
teaching, tutoring, lecturing, research, etc. These
would yield different results, reflecting the simple
fact that education has many facets, and dimen
sions, which cannot be captured by looking at any
simplified etymology of any single word.
3. On the Latin side, we should note first that in
addition to the verb educere (3rd conjugation) on
which the SES committee chose to rely, there was
another related Latin verb, educare (Ist conjuga
tion) meaning 'to train, to rear, to bring up ' It is from
the latter (and its nouneducatfo) that our word edu
cation' is most immediately derived. Secondly, the
Romans had several other verbs which they applied
to the process of education, including instituere,
instruere, and erudire. None of these suggests to
lead forth ; the first two suggested the idea of estab
lishing,' constructing' or setting in order, while the
last implied making smooth.'
Thus the committee's central line of argument —
the first among its "basic premises" — must be
rejected as wholly misconceived This fact does not,
of course, necessarily refute the laissez faire
philosophy which the committee derived from it; as
previously observed, that philosophy might con
ceivably be supported on other grounds. However,
since no other basis was supplied, the committee's
general conclusion stands unsupported. We are left
with, at best, a negative theory of laissez faire — a
theory which might as well have been adopted out of
sheer inertia or even from an impulse to deflate
student po'itical demands by making educational
concessions 2 On this view, educational restraints
are wrong primarily because they are burdensome
and because they are disliked. Eliminating require
ments is good because freedom is good, in and of
itself If teachers are free to teach what they want to
teach and students are free to learn what they want
to leam, we may trust that everybody will benefit and
that the proper interests of society will be served
111
The question now is whether that trust has been
vindicated or discredited The indications are
mounting that it has been discredited — that the kind
of educational laissez faire recommended by the
SES report has already been found seriously defi
cient Several emerging difficulties call for particular
attention.
1 The problem of standards
Derek Bok, President of Harvard University (and
a Stanford alumnus) began a recent article "On the
Purposes of Undergraduate Education' (Daedalus.
Fall, 1974, pp 159-172) as follows
"Scholars who study the behavior of
human organizations constantly stress the
importance of defining institutional goals
Without dear objectives, it is said, an mstitu
tion cannot evaluate how well it is perform
ing, decide how to allocate its resources
wisely, plan for future growth, motivate its
members, or justify its existence to the
larger public
"Despite these admonitions, our colleges
seem to exist without making much of an
effort to define their aims In the thick reports
on undergraduate education that many col
leges have produced in recent years, there
is little discuMion of what it is that a liberal
arts education should provide for me stu-

dent. The prevailing sentiment is captured
by the statement of a curriculum committee
in one of our most distinguished univer
sities: The objective toward which cur
riculum planning should strive is, to the ex
tent possible, to let the teacher teach what
he wants to teach and the student learn
t what he wants to learn.' "
It should be noted lhat the concluding sentence,
cited as exemplifying a prevalent defiaency, is bor
rowed from the SES report; it is the second of the
two excerpts quoted at the beginning of this paper
Bok's point is that the SES philosophy of laissez
faire provides no standards for directing or evaluat
ing any aspect of the academic enterprise, or judg
ing academic performance. If the controlling objec
tive is to allow teachers and students to do whatever
they prefer, why should the university not provide
instruction in basketweaving? If it be replied that
accepted standards of academic excellence and
competence are assumed, the question arises
where such standards originate and how they are
maintained. To the extent that they are needed, the
laissez faire philosophy is thereby shown to be in
adequate
It is one thing to maintain that teachers should
enjoy teaching and that students should enjoy learn
ing, but it is something else to say that immediate
enjoyment — which can vary according to the fash
ions of the day — is to be taken as the primary
measure of academic success. It is perhaps worth
remarking that while the SES report relied on Alfred
North Whitehead's observation that the University's
justification is to preserve "the connection between
knowledge and the zest of life, by uniting the young
and the old in the imaginative consideration of learn
ing" (SES, I, 10) it failed to note that in the same
essay (as well as elsewhere in his writings on edu
cation) Whitehead stressed the need for a "discip
line of imagination" so that the superior vigor of the
young should be tempered by the superior experi
ence of the elders. The persistent problem of educa
tion, in Whitehead's view, is to combine discipline
and imagination so that neither destroys the other.
In his words, "qualities essential at a later stage of a
career are apt to be stamped out in an earlier stage
This is only an instance of the more general fact, that
technical excellence can only be acquired by a train
ing which is apt to damage those energies of mind
which should direct the technical skill. This is the key
fact in education, and the reason for most of its
difficulties." 3
2. Problems of specialization and vocationalism
The Harvard report of 1945, General Education in
a Free Society, probably the most widely influential t
report on higher issued in the decadea
immediate following World War II, devoted most of
its attention to a discussion of the purposes and
functions of education in a free society, "It is fruit
less," the Harvard committee wrote, "to think about
any such practical step as a curriculum without hav
ing in mind specifications or points of reference, in
this case the ends toward which the curriculum
should look and the students for whom it is in
tended." 4
The main problems of education were there attri
buted to three sources: first, the progressive expan
sion of knowledge with the attendant multiplication
of specialisms and sub-specialisms in all areas;
second, the great increase in the number of college
students as opportunities for education beyond the
high-school were extended from the privileged few
and made available to young people at large; and
third, to the increasing complexity of modern society
itself. To cope with these problems, the Harvard
committee felt that education at the college level
ought to perform a dual role. It must, on the one
hand, fully recognize the need for increasing
specialization and provide a foundation for students
going on to careers or vocations requiring particular
skills in diverse areas. But it must at the same time
seek to balance the fragmentation and atomization
threatened by the multiplication of specialties by
finding some unifying dimension or dimensions. It
was concluded that the latter function required re
newed stress on the sort of education that had been
traditionally called "liberal education," specifically
the kind of education designed to develop the
natural capacities of the student as a human being
regardless of the particular social role which he or
she might subsequently fill. "Our conclusion, then,"
wrote the Harvard committee in 1945," is that the
aim of education should be to prepare an individual
to become an expert both in some particular voca
tion or art and in the general art of the free man and
the citizen. Thus the two kinds of education once
given separately to different social classes must be
given to all alike." 5
These views are cited not to suggest that the
curricular innovations recommended by the Har
vard committee in 1945 accomplished their purpose
(which is open to serious debate) but to show that
the committee identified — and tried to meet —
three problems which became more and more pres
sing in the ensuing years Among these, the con
tinued multiplication of specialisms with spreading
emphasis on the importance to the student of de
veloping marketable skills, at a high level of sophis
tication, has proved perhaps the most intractable
One way to deal with this problem is, of course, to do
nothing — to drift with the prevailing current rather
than attempt to swim against it. The SES report, with
its philosophy of laissez faire, does exactly that
Since increasing specialism is the order of the day.
and since competent scholars are specialists, it can
be claimed, "realism" dictates that we accept that
fact, adapting our education to it and letting
threatened dangers take care of themselves But
some of those threatened dangers have already
become actual.

(i) As the opinion spreads that the main function of
higher education is to develop in the student mar
ketable skills — what Steven Miller, President of
Johns Hopkins, calls "higher skilling" as opposed to
higher education 8 — for a job market which is al
ready oversaturated, the value of a college educa
tion is necessanly depreciated. If it were recog
nized, however, that the chief function of a college
education is to develop the human potential of the
student without regard to the particular job he or she
might eventually hold or the particular social role he
or she might occupy, the result would be otherwise
Success or failure in the job market would not be
considered so crucial There is here an illustration of
the point made before, that the objectives (or sup
posed objectives) of education always provide the
criteria for evaluating success or failure
(ii) In regard to the nature and status if knowledge,
Steven Muller, in the article just mentioned, asked
the pregnant question If all our scholars are stand
ing at the frontiers of knowledge, who is standing at
the center? Is there today any center? If not, how
can there be any community of scholars in the tradi
tional sense?
Under present conditions, there is no genuine
community of teachers or students in any college or
university, but rather an aggregate of specialists
and students, each pursuing his or her own sepa
rate interests in geographical proximity, with little or
no basis for cross-disciplinary communication or
understanding One consequence is that most scho
lars feel more affinity with, and more respect for,
their professional colleagues in other universities
than for members of other departments in their own
And there is no longer any unity of knowledge, but
only a collocation of separate knowledges Such a
situation may. perhaps, be defended certainly it is
preferable to an ideological uniformity arbitrarily im
posed But surety there is a middle ground between

these extremes. Muller considers that some return
to general education, with universal requirements
for English, for a second language, for cultural his
tory, and for science, is necessary to restore the
un 'ty of genuine education.
What all our scholars in different disciplines have
in common is that they are all human beings, that
they all share the same cultural inheritance, and that
they are all engaged (or should be) in the same
quest — the quest for greater knowledge and wider
understanding. And we do well, we believe, to recall
the observation of Arthur Lovejoy that he who knows
only his own special field may not know what is most
worth looking lor in his special field. 7
#ii) An extensive investigation recently conducted
byktwo ecfcjcation reporters of the Los Angeles
Tunes into the concurrent phenomena of progres
sive grade inflation along with progressive decline in
the average level of students' proficiency has been
the widespread substitution of new elective
oourses, sometimes lacking in academic rigor, for
the kind of basic courses which used to be required
for all students. 8 Though the demonstration is not
conclusive, it is at least persuasively documented
As against suggestions that the decline in test
scores is due to other causes — such as altered
family structures, the increased number of less qual
ified students, regional factors, or the unreliability of
test scores — the authors of the report point out that
the two areas where test scores have not declined
but held steady or advanced are the areas in which
basic requirements have been largely retained, i.e.,
in the first three primary grades in school and in the
sciences at post-secondary level. These investiga
tions, which are too long to summanze, are worth
senous attention. At least, they cannot be ignored,
despite the attempts of some educators to dismiss
or discount them.
(iv) There is clear evidence that college students
today resent the increasingly competitive atmos
phere of post-secondary education. 9 It seems to be
a fair inference that the competitive aspect reflects
the increasing emphasis in higher education upon
the development of marketable skills. When stu
dents are competing for entrance to professional
schools or for jobs requiring technical proficiency,
and when good grades are seen as important for
Stich purposes, the process of college education
naturally comes to be seen as a struggle of each
against all; for admission to a limited number of
'ftllure positions. But liberal education, in the tradi
tional sense, has a different character. The
philosopher Spinoza pointed out that intellectual
goods sought for their own sake are non-
C9mpetitive. If one person achieves wisdom or in
creased insight, he is not threatened but reinforced
if his neighbors do likewise. Here is one major dif
ference between virtues of character and technical
skills, at least where the latter determine job oppor
tunities. Nothing is so useful or agreeable to the
virtuous man, Spinoza wrote, as the company of
others who are like-minded. Where self-realization
or self-improvement is the aim rather than voca
tional proficiency — as is the case with liberal edu
cation — emulation can be a spur without being a
threat. And the community of scholars, for teachers
and students alike, rests upon such a foundation
Thef search for "higher skilling" is centrifugal; the
search for liberal education is centripetal. A student
whose aim is self-development or self-improvement
as a human being values grades only as indications
of his own progress, not for any advantage they may
give over others.

(v) As our society becomes increasingly complex,
as specialisms multiply, and as it becomes increas
ingly apparent that the most serious problems ex
tend over many diciplines, it follows, as Professor
Gabriel Almond has observed, that "only higher
order philosophical syntheses can spell out the big
issues and formulate alternative solutions." 10 At the
same time, our society is becoming more and more
susceptible at all levels to the pull of simplistic slo
gans, catchwords, images, stereotypes and
counter-stereotypes. In this situation the need for
critical intelligence and balanced judgment is be
coming more and more acute, yet this need is not
likely to be apparent to the beginning student, par
ticularly if he is bent on acquiring some particular
skill. The SES report quoted approvingly an obser
vation of Professor Edwin M. Good to the effect that
the important simplicities are those which lie "on the
other side of complexity" (Vol. I, p. 11). Surely the
proper inference is that today's student, seeking tp
pick his way through the growing thicket of com
plexities towards some thoughtful and balanced
overview — as opposed to the delusive simplicities
offered by catchwords and fashionable stereotypes
— needs more guidance and direction than ever
before. The claim of the SES committee that today's
student is in a better position than anybody else to
choose the academic path he will take (Vol. I. p. 15)
seems like saying that the thicker the forest be
comes, the less need there is to require would-be
travellers to take a guide.
IV
Recommendations for achieving the aims of lib
eral education generally envisage imposed re
quirements covenng, in addition to courses in En
glish and in a foreign language, a required course or
courses in Western culture or the history of ideas
We are not concerned here with particular prog
rams, but with the sort of objections most commonly
raised against imposing such requirements.
1. It is often claimed that a required course in
Western culture or the history of ideas in the West is
chauvinistic, since it implies the superiority of the
Western tradition above other traditions The objec
tion is misconceived The purpose of studying the
Western tradition is not to celebrate it but to under
stand It — for good or ill. To evaluate Western
culture, or any other culture, without first making the
effort to understand it is to judge irrationally without
adequate evidence Many people make this very
mistake, but the fact that the mistake is common
affords a good reason for trying to correct it.
2. It is often claimed that requiring students to
study any particular subject is arbitrary because no
particular subject is intrinsically more important than
any other One might, so the argument goes, make
as good a case for general requirement in, say,
psychology or the scientific study of human be
havior The answer here is that all heirs of the West
ern tradition — whether specialists or generalists,
students or faculty, regardless of their special in
terests and capacities — are themselves con
ditioned by Western culture The same is true of all
the specialized disciplines which have developed in
the West they all reflect distinctively Western con
ceptions of rationality and the role of systematic
inquiry '' (Xir heritage affects our preconceptions
about the nature and function of scientific know
ledge as well as our preconceptions about values
and norms It is not too much to say that no person
can hope to understand who he or she is without
some understanding of the cultural context, handed
down from prior generations, in which he or she
presently exists Nobody lives, thinks, or talks in a
cultural void Nobody is exempt from cultural influ
ences Hence the peculiar importance of a general
requirement that students systematically examine
the cultural background which they all share
3 It is sometimes objected that a cultural re
quirement would put a premium on conformity to
accepted values We would suggest that the oppo
site is true The dangerous conformities are those
which are blind, unconscious, and uncritical Most
cultures breed rebels as well as conformists, as our

culture has. If a required course in Western culture
is designed (as above noted) to promote the accu
rate understanding of the Western orientation, the
result should be to make both rebels and confor
mists more dearly aware of what it is that they are
rejecting or accepting.
4. It has been objected that there is no reliable
evidence by which we can evaluate the effective
ness of general courses of the kind here envisaged;
hence they should not be required. We grant the
premise but reject the conclusion. The difficulty of
evaluation arises principally, we think, from the fact
that a good educational program has, or should
have, a long-term impact upon the student, and
such impacts are not precisely identifiable or quanti
fiable. To insist too much on precise evaluations
tends to put the emphasis on those short-term be
nefits and immediate satisfaction which can be as
certained, at the expense of the lasting benefits
which can be recognized, if at all, only in retrospect.
However this may be, the present objection cuts
both ways. If we cannot measure in advance the
precise effectiveness of a proposed requirement,
we cannot measure the relative effectiveness of a
program from which such requirements are omitted.
5. It has been claimed that students cannot be
made to learn what they do not wish to learn, or, as
last year s Council of ASSU Presidents put it, "You
can lead a student to a class but you can't make one
think." This position calls for clarification, because it
is highly ambiguous.
Much of what we learn from everyday experience
is not chosen, but forced upon us, often against our
wills, like learning that hot stoves can burn or that
careless driving invites serious accidents. With re
gard to required courses, the evidence is that many
generations of Stanford graduates found value in,
and claim to have profited from, the old course in
Western Civilization despite its having been pre
scribed. Many required courses in other colleges
and universities seem to have had substantial suc
cess. It is evident that the present objection is over
stated.
Perhaps we should interpret it to mean that stu
dents learn better when they study subjects which
they enjoy. There is some truth in this, but there is
also room for a serious confusion. One may enjoy
the process of studying a subject without liking or
approving the subject under study. A medical stu
dent, for example, does not normally enjoy or ap
prove of diseases A student of criminal behavior
does not normally enjoy or approve of crime. Such
students take satisfaction in learning how to cope
with the problems created by disease and crime. So
also a student of Western culture need not like or
approve of Western culture as such in order to find
satisfaction in making a study of it. If this distinction
is kept in mind, a further point emerges, namely, that
nobody can judge whether studying a given subject
will yield satisfaction or prove valuable to him until
after he has engaged in it. Students who view all
required courses as an infringement upon their
freedom of choice sometimes forget that freedom to
make informed choices is not the same as freedom
to make uninformed choices.
It used to be taken lor granted that if students
came to college, it was because they wished to be
made to think, this being accepted as an essential
part of a college education. The present argument,
however, introduces a distinction, as if students
were now saying: "Please give us an education, but
don't make us Slink — or at least, don't make us
think any more than we like or about topics we don't
like." Such a position, if taken seriously, would make
disciplined thinking peripheral rather than central to
the educational process, since disciplined thinking
is usually laborious and the habit of disciplined think
ing can only be acquired, like other skills, by sus
tained practice and fatiguing application.
Finally, it should be noted that when autonomy is
equated with negative freedom in Berlin's sense —
that is to say with freedom from restraints — and
when freedom from restraints is conceived as imply
ing freedom from any imposed norms or standards,
autonomy loses its value As Sartre showed in
Being and Nothingness, freedom without
guidelines is a burden; it is the freedom of the travel
ler lost in the jungle without a map, who can move in
any direction he wishes but has no basis for choos
ing one direction rather than another. From the
psychological point of view, this kind of freedom
results either in existential despair or in a kind of
narcissism which, valuing only sensations and ple
asures of the moment, and fearing the restraint of
any firm commitments, ends by trivalizing the very
pleasures it claims to prize. l 2 It also serves to de
stroy community with others; cooperation among
individuals is impossible where there are no com
monly accepted standards of acceptable and unac
ceptable behavior, because nobody can count on
what others will do. And even the ideal of universal
brotherhood is weakened if it is taken to imply free
dom from any concrete responsibilities to any par
ticular human beings 13
In a society where catchwords tend to replace
critical inquiry, words like freedom' and autonomy
take on a life of their own and acquire a special
emotional force, as if they represented absolute
goods. If autonomy is valuable, we easily assume
that the more autonomy we have the better off we
are, and that a condition of unlimited autonomy must
be best of all But such is not the case Individual
freedom and autonomy are vitally important as in
strumental goods, but to convert them into absolute
goods is to destroy their function.
V
In the foregoing section we have argued that re
quirements, far from being an evil, are, in fact,
necessary for the purposes of a liberal education
Here we may be more specific about requirements
at Stanford.
The Stanford undergraduate curriculum currentty
includes two requirements One is that of the Major,
based on the pnnciple of study in depth This re
quirement was re-examined and reaffirmed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (Campus
Report, 130ct. 1976, p.B). The other is the recently
redefined Distnbution Requirement wtiich aims to
provide the breadth of study necessary for a liberal
eAjcation to yield "a richer personal life through the
development of spaciousness of mind and spirit
The Distribution Requirements exist to ensure ex
posure to different ideas and different ways of think
ing They should enable (one) to understand better
the major ways of knowing,' to assess their
strengths and limitations, to appreciate their un
iqueness, and no less importantly to discern what
they have in common" (DRAT, p 21).
Under the present system, work in the three re
quired areas entails the study of certain works of
creative imagination in their cultural and histoncal
contexts, or of certain problems of philosophy and
belief (Humanities); the study of society, social in
stitutions. and human behavior (Social Saences);
and the study of natural phenomena, technology,
and math (NS/M/T) The stress in each area is upon
approaches, scholarly methods, and the general
human significance of the vanous kinds of study In
addition, for each area, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommends development of
groups of correlated courses; in Humanities the
courses chosen to fulfil the requirement must form a
group which can be certified" by the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (directly approved by the Dean
if the group is chosen by a student, indirectly, if set
up by a department)
The pnnaple of breadth is thus fulfilled by requir

ing a certain amount of study in the three areas into
which human knowledge has been conveniently di
vided. Vet, within each area, a different principle of
order is invoked, and a broad, comprehensive out
look is neither required nor encouraged Moreover,
no principles are stated for the organization of cor re
lated groups or "sequences" within the areas. Nor
has advice been given to departments on the ways
in which they should, in practice, "group" their own
courses or correlate them with courses in other de
partments
In addition, students have not been advised about
the designing of a Humanities program which might
be acceptable to the Doan. Much of the "freedom"
prescribed by SES was predicated on the assump
tion that undergraduate advising, especially for un
declared majors (freshman and sophomore years),
would be vigorous and that the "strongly recom
mended" alternatives and choices would be made
under vigilant academic guidance. Unfortunately,
the faculty, as advisors, cannot peiform the neces
sary academic surveillance given the laissoz fain)
philosophy of the present system.
This loosely structured program may have some
merit in that it recognizes the validity of both syn
chronic and diachronic methods of study, however,
it is impractical and unwittingly misleading. A stu
dent can easily justify the coherence of a group of
three courses, on say, the liteiature, art and society
of fifth-century Athens, or that of a group embracing
the three story-tellers Homer, Dorothy Richardson
and Dostoyevsky, or even that of any three courses
taught by an individual professor.
Are these two requirements — Major and Dis
tribution — an adequate foundation for a liberal
education? We feel that they are not. The student
certainly needs the intellectual methods proper to
the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences which the Distribution Requirement is
supposed to provide. But a good liberal education
has to be more comprehensive. It must include
some systematic study of the fundamental nature
and development of the culture and civilization
within which the student is living and to which he will
someday contribute. It must also provide basic in
formation about the complexities of modern society,
the means to analyse and evaluate that society, and
the perspective necessary to judge it on a compara
tive basis. In addition, the student should have some
knowledge of a culture remote from his own — a
culture outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition, suc h
as Greek or Asian — which will confront him with
ideas that challenge his unconscious assumptions
about his own time and place.
Many who agree in principle with such educa
tional ideals feel that they cannot be achieved. We
disagree. This is a university rich in teaching re
sources which has demonstrated on other occa
sions an ability to make sensible and worthwhile
educational innovations when they have been
needed. They are needed now. Departments and
individual instructors are well-equipped to deal with
the task at hand, and we should certainly draw on
our excellent teaching resources.
The Report of the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford has
suggested certain specific ways in which, through a
program of "tracks," undergraduate education
could achieve the strength and the focus it lacks at
the moment. The Report also mentions the desira
bility of historical and comparative studies whereby
modern Western culture can be confr onted not only
with past stages of its development, but also with
manifestations of other cultures. The program en
visioned by the Report is based partly on existing
courses covering the Western tradition. This prog
ram would allow the student to choose among four
approaches — literature and language; history; re
ligion and philosophy, or the creative and perform
ing arts — all leading to the same goal. This ap
proach would give to each student an educational
program more coherent than the present one.
The appropriate authorities — the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, the Doan of Undar
graduate Studies, the Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (where most under
graduate teaching takes place) — must now de
velop a plan for providing, either through new
courses or through the adaptation of existing
courses, a method for satisfying the educational
needs we have outlined. Those authorities should
also consider how that plan, when in operation,
could be monitored effectively T he responsibility
our University has to its undergraduates and the
obligation it has to its reputation demands that such
action be taken promptly.
Having outlined our views in this general stato
ment, we intend to publish in the next few months a
series of position papers suggesting concrete im
provements to undergraduate education at Stan
ford.

For approximately one year, a group o
humanities faculty members, gathering together tc
discuss issues of mutual concern, has debated the
merits of the present structure of the undergraduate
curriculum at Stanford. Events both local and na
tional have encouraged this sustained debate. The
group has had, moreover, the opportunity to hear, al
its informal sessions, the opinions of some of the
' officers of the University who could be expected to
play key roles in the elaboration of the under
graduate curnculum in future years. Among these
officers have been the President, the Dean ol
Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Under
gracfcjate Studies, and the Dean of Admissions.
What herewith follows is not necessarily a reflec
tion of the attitudes of any one of these officers, nor
of any one faculty member Rather, the group as a
whole would now like to offer to the campus com
munity a statement bearing on the design of that
curnculum. The group recognizes that it possesses
neither final wisdom nor institutional authority in
matters such as these; it also recognizes that exten
sive planning remains to be done before revisions in
the curriculum can be addopted
The group speaks, however, with a sense ol
urgency. It is satisfied neither with the quality of the
intellectual life, nor with the goals and standards of
the undergraduate program. It believes, moreover,
that dissatisfaction, at times expressed and at other
times muted, is a sentiment shared by many faculty
members at Stanford. Nor is such a condition
merely local. Discussion within the group has been
enlivened in the past year by the clear recognition
that the problems Stanford now faces (and must
rigorously attempt to resolve) are problems affect
ing every prestigious institution of higher learning.
That the problems are national in their dimensions is
indicated by, among other things, the special
1974-75 issues of Daedalus (Journal of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences) wherein
eighty-four distinguished educators, including sev
eral from Stanford, speak to the conditions now
defining academic life. Differences among these
educators are certainly present, but all are
frightened, as the editor says, "by what they see as
a lack of concern for intellectual values, others worry
about what they think to be a reduced social con
sciousness." The perspective in which this deep
concern, on both the national level and the local
level, takes place is more serious, of course, than
the question of which course or courses must be
required of the undergraduate. It is more serious
than any particular detail. But details and particulars
will, at the appropriate moment, play their crucial
part when revisions in the curriculum are proposed
and then established. The editor of Daedalus de
scribes the newly emergent situation not as "a re
petition of the discussion that occurred in the middle
of the nineteenth century when a rigid, classically
oriented college curriculum was challenged by the
new theoretical and applied sciences. Much more is
at stake today; the continued viability of the concept
of the liberally-educated person is involved."
About the continued viability the Stanford com
munity has the deepest obligation to be concerned.
In the immediate past, that concern has been ex
pressed by the Report of the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stan
ford. The spirit of that Report, in which a clear com
mitment to a requirement in Western Culture is af
firmed, must be sustained and nourished. Hence
the informal Humanities and Sciences group is
happy to note that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has recently, and unanimously, also en
dorsed "the principle that studies in Western Culture
should be part of each student's education."
Discussions within the group have also been in
vigorated by the understanding that the problems
Stanford now faces are not purely national but are
Stanford's own This university must fulfill the spe
cial obligations it has as a private institution, of great
prestige, within a state and a geography dominated
by non-private institutions Its mission has been,
and is, special; so can be the quality of its under
graduate education. To this obligation President
Richard W. Lyman has often spoken, and most tel
lingly speaks in the pages of Daedalus, where he
says
We who are responsible for the continuing
health of our "little platoons" — and even
the greatest of the private universities are
"little platoons" when matched against the
dimensions of state-supported higher edu
cation — we have our work cut out for us...
one virture that ought to be within the reach
of independent institutions, be they old or
new, famous or obscure, is that of rigorous
self-definition.
It is to that rigor arte 1 that self-definition that Stan
ford's attention must now turn Prompted, then, by
both the national anxiety and concern, and opposed
to the idle, helpless notion that little can be done in
the face of curricular and intellectual complexity, this
statement is offered to the Stanford community It is
hoped that it will play some effective part in discus
sions within the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
and the Academic Senate.
The pnnciples underlying the 1968 Study of Edu
cation at Stanford are treated here first. That Study
predates the Report of the Committee on the Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
and by virtue of the seriousness and thoughtfulness
with which it was undertaken, has achieved a con
siderable weight in later discussions of curricular
reform But as the Study itself observes, its spirit
was one of "self-examination and self-renewal." It
further observes that "the study of education must
become a process rather than event." Eight years
have since passed: changes now seem wholly
proper and necessary In the light, then, of such
changes to be made, a second matter for discussion
follows the first It is a consideration of the newly
formulated system of distnbution requirements. Al
though that system is the product of much labor on
the part of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, it does not coherently and directly address
the fundamental inadequacies of the present cur
ncular program for the undergraduate student, it is a
system that is too diffuse and too loosely monitored
to be able to do so Only by a program that is more
coherently structured can the mtellecuual life of the
Stanford student be made more challenging, in
tense, and rewarding
II
The basic philosophy of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). published in 1968-69, was that of
educational laissez fairs This is reflected in two
parallel pronouncements, the first of which ap
peared in the general introductory section of the
report and the second in the section on under
graduate education
"Let fie objectrve of curncular planning be
to encourage the faculty member to teach
what he likes to teach and the student to
learn what seems vital to him — the Intellec
tual History of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century rather than the History of Western
Civilization Modern Consciousness rather
than Freshman English. Organizational Be
havior rather than Introduction to Sociology
— and from this common freedom may
emerge a form of general education far bet
ter suited to the cftaractennbcs of a umver
slty than that to which we pay lip service

now." (Vol. I, p. 14)
And again:
"The objective toward which curriculum
planning should strive is, to the extent pos
sible, to let the teacher teach what he wants
to teach and the student learn what he
wants to learn." (Vol. II, p. 12)
Now philosophies of laissez faire can be arrived at
in different ways and supported or defended on
different grounds. Having in mind Isaiah Berlin's
significant distinction between positive and negative
conceptions of freedom — possitive freedom being
freedom for the achievement of some end deemed
desirable, negative freedom being freedom from
restraint on the assumption that restraint is wrong in
itself 1 — we can roughly distinguish between posi
tive and negative philosophies of laissez faire.
Adam Smith's views concerning economic be
havior were positive in this sense, not because they
were necessarily correct, but because they were
based on extensive inquiries into the nature of
wealth, the nature of human motivation and be
havior, and a clear belief in the desirability of the
conditions to which he thought a free market
economy would contribute. One may, of course,
quarrel with his views, but the fact remains that he
had a carefully worked out theory of social welfare
and advocated free enterprise as the best means of
achieving it. It is not inconceivable that a positive
doctrine of educational laissez faire might be simi
larly grounded on some carefully worked out and
coherent theory of the objectives, functions, and
social impact of higher education. But SES failed to
provide any such theory Instead it provided a nega
tive philosophy of laissez faire based on the view
that in higher education, restraints of any kind are
inherently bad. Moreover, this view was itself based
on a curiously narrow and dubious line of argument
which calls for special attention and comment.
The SES committee took the position that it ought
to base its "proposed reponses to the problems of
education at Stanford on careful consideration of
the meaning of education for individual teacher and
student and of the nature of the university" (Vol. I, p.
8). So far, so good. But it then proceeded to deal
with these questions, not by considering the general
objectives, functions and possible impact of higher
education in and on today's society, nor by consider
ing the important "new dimensions" which it had
cited in the opening sentence of its report as having
been introduced by the student unrest of the 1960's.
Instead, the Committee attempted to deal with all
these questions by the simple expedient of examin
ing the etymology of the single world, education '
The Committee established its "basic premises" i

as follows:
To establish our basic premises we must
begin with our conceptions of education and
of a university. The world 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educere meaning to
lead forth.' To lead does not mean to com
pel, or to push, or to pull. It means quite
simply what it says.. (1,10)
On this foundation it was immediately concluded
(among other things) that education "can never be
compelled nor can knowledge be impressed on a
mind unwilling to learn if it is to be more than indoc
trination'' (I, 10). It was also inferred (without any
corresponding concern for the etymology of the
word "university") that "the University can nevei
educate in the true sense of the word, but it can
supply the environment and the means necessary
to insure that those who came here may educate
each other and themselves'' (I, 10). In short, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, the weight of the
whole report seems to have rested upon the pre
sumed etymology of the word educate.'
The deficiences of this approach are obvious:
1 Words change their meanings. Hence even i
this particular etymology were adequately stated, i
could give no more than a tentative and partial hin
as to the present meaning of the word "education."
2. Given a complex enterprise like that of moderr
education, many different words are involved. If we
are to rely on etymology, we ought surely to con
sider also the etymologies of a variety of other En
glish words which are relevant to education, such as
learning, training, study, scholarship, instruction,
teaching, tutoring, lecturing, research, etc. These
would yield different results, reflecting the simple
fact that education has many facets, and dimen
sions, which cannot be captured by looking at any
simplified etymology of any single word.
3. On the Latin side, we should note first that in
addition to the verb educere (3rd conjugation) on
which the SES committee chose to rely, there was
another related Latin verb, educare (Ist conjuga
tion) meaning 'to train, to rear, to bring up ' It is from
the latter (and its nouneducatfo) that our word edu
cation' is most immediately derived. Secondly, the
Romans had several other verbs which they applied
to the process of education, including instituere,
instruere, and erudire. None of these suggests to
lead forth ; the first two suggested the idea of estab
lishing,' constructing' or setting in order, while the
last implied making smooth.'
Thus the committee's central line of argument —
the first among its "basic premises" — must be
rejected as wholly misconceived This fact does not,
of course, necessarily refute the laissez faire
philosophy which the committee derived from it; as
previously observed, that philosophy might con
ceivably be supported on other grounds. However,
since no other basis was supplied, the committee's
general conclusion stands unsupported. We are left
with, at best, a negative theory of laissez faire — a
theory which might as well have been adopted out of
sheer inertia or even from an impulse to deflate
student po'itical demands by making educational
concessions 2 On this view, educational restraints
are wrong primarily because they are burdensome
and because they are disliked. Eliminating require
ments is good because freedom is good, in and of
itself If teachers are free to teach what they want to
teach and students are free to learn what they want
to leam, we may trust that everybody will benefit and
that the proper interests of society will be served
111
The question now is whether that trust has been
vindicated or discredited The indications are
mounting that it has been discredited — that the kind
of educational laissez faire recommended by the
SES report has already been found seriously defi
cient Several emerging difficulties call for particular
attention.
1 The problem of standards
Derek Bok, President of Harvard University (and
a Stanford alumnus) began a recent article "On the
Purposes of Undergraduate Education' (Daedalus.
Fall, 1974, pp 159-172) as follows
"Scholars who study the behavior of
human organizations constantly stress the
importance of defining institutional goals
Without dear objectives, it is said, an mstitu
tion cannot evaluate how well it is perform
ing, decide how to allocate its resources
wisely, plan for future growth, motivate its
members, or justify its existence to the
larger public
"Despite these admonitions, our colleges
seem to exist without making much of an
effort to define their aims In the thick reports
on undergraduate education that many col
leges have produced in recent years, there
is little discuMion of what it is that a liberal
arts education should provide for me stu-

dent. The prevailing sentiment is captured
by the statement of a curriculum committee
in one of our most distinguished univer
sities: The objective toward which cur
riculum planning should strive is, to the ex
tent possible, to let the teacher teach what
he wants to teach and the student learn
t what he wants to learn.' "
It should be noted lhat the concluding sentence,
cited as exemplifying a prevalent defiaency, is bor
rowed from the SES report; it is the second of the
two excerpts quoted at the beginning of this paper
Bok's point is that the SES philosophy of laissez
faire provides no standards for directing or evaluat
ing any aspect of the academic enterprise, or judg
ing academic performance. If the controlling objec
tive is to allow teachers and students to do whatever
they prefer, why should the university not provide
instruction in basketweaving? If it be replied that
accepted standards of academic excellence and
competence are assumed, the question arises
where such standards originate and how they are
maintained. To the extent that they are needed, the
laissez faire philosophy is thereby shown to be in
adequate
It is one thing to maintain that teachers should
enjoy teaching and that students should enjoy learn
ing, but it is something else to say that immediate
enjoyment — which can vary according to the fash
ions of the day — is to be taken as the primary
measure of academic success. It is perhaps worth
remarking that while the SES report relied on Alfred
North Whitehead's observation that the University's
justification is to preserve "the connection between
knowledge and the zest of life, by uniting the young
and the old in the imaginative consideration of learn
ing" (SES, I, 10) it failed to note that in the same
essay (as well as elsewhere in his writings on edu
cation) Whitehead stressed the need for a "discip
line of imagination" so that the superior vigor of the
young should be tempered by the superior experi
ence of the elders. The persistent problem of educa
tion, in Whitehead's view, is to combine discipline
and imagination so that neither destroys the other.
In his words, "qualities essential at a later stage of a
career are apt to be stamped out in an earlier stage
This is only an instance of the more general fact, that
technical excellence can only be acquired by a train
ing which is apt to damage those energies of mind
which should direct the technical skill. This is the key
fact in education, and the reason for most of its
difficulties." 3
2. Problems of specialization and vocationalism
The Harvard report of 1945, General Education in
a Free Society, probably the most widely influential t
report on higher issued in the decadea
immediate following World War II, devoted most of
its attention to a discussion of the purposes and
functions of education in a free society, "It is fruit
less," the Harvard committee wrote, "to think about
any such practical step as a curriculum without hav
ing in mind specifications or points of reference, in
this case the ends toward which the curriculum
should look and the students for whom it is in
tended." 4
The main problems of education were there attri
buted to three sources: first, the progressive expan
sion of knowledge with the attendant multiplication
of specialisms and sub-specialisms in all areas;
second, the great increase in the number of college
students as opportunities for education beyond the
high-school were extended from the privileged few
and made available to young people at large; and
third, to the increasing complexity of modern society
itself. To cope with these problems, the Harvard
committee felt that education at the college level
ought to perform a dual role. It must, on the one
hand, fully recognize the need for increasing
specialization and provide a foundation for students
going on to careers or vocations requiring particular
skills in diverse areas. But it must at the same time
seek to balance the fragmentation and atomization
threatened by the multiplication of specialties by
finding some unifying dimension or dimensions. It
was concluded that the latter function required re
newed stress on the sort of education that had been
traditionally called "liberal education," specifically
the kind of education designed to develop the
natural capacities of the student as a human being
regardless of the particular social role which he or
she might subsequently fill. "Our conclusion, then,"
wrote the Harvard committee in 1945," is that the
aim of education should be to prepare an individual
to become an expert both in some particular voca
tion or art and in the general art of the free man and
the citizen. Thus the two kinds of education once
given separately to different social classes must be
given to all alike." 5
These views are cited not to suggest that the
curricular innovations recommended by the Har
vard committee in 1945 accomplished their purpose
(which is open to serious debate) but to show that
the committee identified — and tried to meet —
three problems which became more and more pres
sing in the ensuing years Among these, the con
tinued multiplication of specialisms with spreading
emphasis on the importance to the student of de
veloping marketable skills, at a high level of sophis
tication, has proved perhaps the most intractable
One way to deal with this problem is, of course, to do
nothing — to drift with the prevailing current rather
than attempt to swim against it. The SES report, with
its philosophy of laissez faire, does exactly that
Since increasing specialism is the order of the day.
and since competent scholars are specialists, it can
be claimed, "realism" dictates that we accept that
fact, adapting our education to it and letting
threatened dangers take care of themselves But
some of those threatened dangers have already
become actual.

(i) As the opinion spreads that the main function of
higher education is to develop in the student mar
ketable skills — what Steven Miller, President of
Johns Hopkins, calls "higher skilling" as opposed to
higher education 8 — for a job market which is al
ready oversaturated, the value of a college educa
tion is necessanly depreciated. If it were recog
nized, however, that the chief function of a college
education is to develop the human potential of the
student without regard to the particular job he or she
might eventually hold or the particular social role he
or she might occupy, the result would be otherwise
Success or failure in the job market would not be
considered so crucial There is here an illustration of
the point made before, that the objectives (or sup
posed objectives) of education always provide the
criteria for evaluating success or failure
(ii) In regard to the nature and status if knowledge,
Steven Muller, in the article just mentioned, asked
the pregnant question If all our scholars are stand
ing at the frontiers of knowledge, who is standing at
the center? Is there today any center? If not, how
can there be any community of scholars in the tradi
tional sense?
Under present conditions, there is no genuine
community of teachers or students in any college or
university, but rather an aggregate of specialists
and students, each pursuing his or her own sepa
rate interests in geographical proximity, with little or
no basis for cross-disciplinary communication or
understanding One consequence is that most scho
lars feel more affinity with, and more respect for,
their professional colleagues in other universities
than for members of other departments in their own
And there is no longer any unity of knowledge, but
only a collocation of separate knowledges Such a
situation may. perhaps, be defended certainly it is
preferable to an ideological uniformity arbitrarily im
posed But surety there is a middle ground between

these extremes. Muller considers that some return
to general education, with universal requirements
for English, for a second language, for cultural his
tory, and for science, is necessary to restore the
un 'ty of genuine education.
What all our scholars in different disciplines have
in common is that they are all human beings, that
they all share the same cultural inheritance, and that
they are all engaged (or should be) in the same
quest — the quest for greater knowledge and wider
understanding. And we do well, we believe, to recall
the observation of Arthur Lovejoy that he who knows
only his own special field may not know what is most
worth looking lor in his special field. 7
#ii) An extensive investigation recently conducted
byktwo ecfcjcation reporters of the Los Angeles
Tunes into the concurrent phenomena of progres
sive grade inflation along with progressive decline in
the average level of students' proficiency has been
the widespread substitution of new elective
oourses, sometimes lacking in academic rigor, for
the kind of basic courses which used to be required
for all students. 8 Though the demonstration is not
conclusive, it is at least persuasively documented
As against suggestions that the decline in test
scores is due to other causes — such as altered
family structures, the increased number of less qual
ified students, regional factors, or the unreliability of
test scores — the authors of the report point out that
the two areas where test scores have not declined
but held steady or advanced are the areas in which
basic requirements have been largely retained, i.e.,
in the first three primary grades in school and in the
sciences at post-secondary level. These investiga
tions, which are too long to summanze, are worth
senous attention. At least, they cannot be ignored,
despite the attempts of some educators to dismiss
or discount them.
(iv) There is clear evidence that college students
today resent the increasingly competitive atmos
phere of post-secondary education. 9 It seems to be
a fair inference that the competitive aspect reflects
the increasing emphasis in higher education upon
the development of marketable skills. When stu
dents are competing for entrance to professional
schools or for jobs requiring technical proficiency,
and when good grades are seen as important for
Stich purposes, the process of college education
naturally comes to be seen as a struggle of each
against all; for admission to a limited number of
'ftllure positions. But liberal education, in the tradi
tional sense, has a different character. The
philosopher Spinoza pointed out that intellectual
goods sought for their own sake are non-
C9mpetitive. If one person achieves wisdom or in
creased insight, he is not threatened but reinforced
if his neighbors do likewise. Here is one major dif
ference between virtues of character and technical
skills, at least where the latter determine job oppor
tunities. Nothing is so useful or agreeable to the
virtuous man, Spinoza wrote, as the company of
others who are like-minded. Where self-realization
or self-improvement is the aim rather than voca
tional proficiency — as is the case with liberal edu
cation — emulation can be a spur without being a
threat. And the community of scholars, for teachers
and students alike, rests upon such a foundation
Thef search for "higher skilling" is centrifugal; the
search for liberal education is centripetal. A student
whose aim is self-development or self-improvement
as a human being values grades only as indications
of his own progress, not for any advantage they may
give over others.

(v) As our society becomes increasingly complex,
as specialisms multiply, and as it becomes increas
ingly apparent that the most serious problems ex
tend over many diciplines, it follows, as Professor
Gabriel Almond has observed, that "only higher
order philosophical syntheses can spell out the big
issues and formulate alternative solutions." 10 At the
same time, our society is becoming more and more
susceptible at all levels to the pull of simplistic slo
gans, catchwords, images, stereotypes and
counter-stereotypes. In this situation the need for
critical intelligence and balanced judgment is be
coming more and more acute, yet this need is not
likely to be apparent to the beginning student, par
ticularly if he is bent on acquiring some particular
skill. The SES report quoted approvingly an obser
vation of Professor Edwin M. Good to the effect that
the important simplicities are those which lie "on the
other side of complexity" (Vol. I, p. 11). Surely the
proper inference is that today's student, seeking tp
pick his way through the growing thicket of com
plexities towards some thoughtful and balanced
overview — as opposed to the delusive simplicities
offered by catchwords and fashionable stereotypes
— needs more guidance and direction than ever
before. The claim of the SES committee that today's
student is in a better position than anybody else to
choose the academic path he will take (Vol. I. p. 15)
seems like saying that the thicker the forest be
comes, the less need there is to require would-be
travellers to take a guide.

Recommendations for achieving the aims of lib
eral education generally envisage imposed re
quirements covenng, in addition to courses in En
glish and in a foreign language, a required course or
courses in Western culture or the history of ideas
We are not concerned here with particular prog
rams, but with the sort of objections most commonly
raised against imposing such requirements.
1. It is often claimed that a required course in
Western culture or the history of ideas in the West is
chauvinistic, since it implies the superiority of the
Western tradition above other traditions The objec
tion is misconceived The purpose of studying the
Western tradition is not to celebrate it but to under
stand It — for good or ill. To evaluate Western
culture, or any other culture, without first making the
effort to understand it is to judge irrationally without
adequate evidence Many people make this very
mistake, but the fact that the mistake is common
affords a good reason for trying to correct it.
2. It is often claimed that requiring students to
study any particular subject is arbitrary because no
particular subject is intrinsically more important than
any other One might, so the argument goes, make
as good a case for general requirement in, say,
psychology or the scientific study of human be
havior The answer here is that all heirs of the West
ern tradition — whether specialists or generalists,
students or faculty, regardless of their special in
terests and capacities — are themselves con
ditioned by Western culture The same is true of all
the specialized disciplines which have developed in
the West they all reflect distinctively Western con
ceptions of rationality and the role of systematic
inquiry '' (Xir heritage affects our preconceptions
about the nature and function of scientific know
ledge as well as our preconceptions about values
and norms It is not too much to say that no person
can hope to understand who he or she is without
some understanding of the cultural context, handed
down from prior generations, in which he or she
presently exists Nobody lives, thinks, or talks in a
cultural void Nobody is exempt from cultural influ
ences Hence the peculiar importance of a general
requirement that students systematically examine
the cultural background which they all share
3 It is sometimes objected that a cultural re
quirement would put a premium on conformity to
accepted values We would suggest that the oppo
site is true The dangerous conformities are those
which are blind, unconscious, and uncritical Most
cultures breed rebels as well as conformists, as our

culture has. If a required course in Western culture
is designed (as above noted) to promote the accu
rate understanding of the Western orientation, the
result should be to make both rebels and confor
mists more dearly aware of what it is that they are
rejecting or accepting.
4. It has been objected that there is no reliable
evidence by which we can evaluate the effective
ness of general courses of the kind here envisaged;
hence they should not be required. We grant the
premise but reject the conclusion. The difficulty of
evaluation arises principally, we think, from the fact
that a good educational program has, or should
have, a long-term impact upon the student, and
such impacts are not precisely identifiable or quanti
fiable. To insist too much on precise evaluations
tends to put the emphasis on those short-term be
nefits and immediate satisfaction which can be as
certained, at the expense of the lasting benefits
which can be recognized, if at all, only in retrospect.
However this may be, the present objection cuts
both ways. If we cannot measure in advance the
precise effectiveness of a proposed requirement,
we cannot measure the relative effectiveness of a
program from which such requirements are omitted.
5. It has been claimed that students cannot be
made to learn what they do not wish to learn, or, as
last year s Council of ASSU Presidents put it, "You
can lead a student to a class but you can't make one
think." This position calls for clarification, because it
is highly ambiguous.
Much of what we learn from everyday experience
is not chosen, but forced upon us, often against our
wills, like learning that hot stoves can burn or that
careless driving invites serious accidents. With re
gard to required courses, the evidence is that many
generations of Stanford graduates found value in,
and claim to have profited from, the old course in
Western Civilization despite its having been pre
scribed. Many required courses in other colleges
and universities seem to have had substantial suc
cess. It is evident that the present objection is over
stated.
Perhaps we should interpret it to mean that stu
dents learn better when they study subjects which
they enjoy. There is some truth in this, but there is
also room for a serious confusion. One may enjoy
the process of studying a subject without liking or
approving the subject under study. A medical stu
dent, for example, does not normally enjoy or ap
prove of diseases A student of criminal behavior
does not normally enjoy or approve of crime. Such
students take satisfaction in learning how to cope
with the problems created by disease and crime. So
also a student of Western culture need not like or
approve of Western culture as such in order to find
satisfaction in making a study of it. If this distinction
is kept in mind, a further point emerges, namely, that
nobody can judge whether studying a given subject
will yield satisfaction or prove valuable to him until
after he has engaged in it. Students who view all
required courses as an infringement upon their
freedom of choice sometimes forget that freedom to
make informed choices is not the same as freedom
to make uninformed choices.
It used to be taken lor granted that if students
came to college, it was because they wished to be
made to think, this being accepted as an essential
part of a college education. The present argument,
however, introduces a distinction, as if students
were now saying: "Please give us an education, but
don't make us Slink — or at least, don't make us
think any more than we like or about topics we don't
like." Such a position, if taken seriously, would make
disciplined thinking peripheral rather than central to
the educational process, since disciplined thinking
is usually laborious and the habit of disciplined think
ing can only be acquired, like other skills, by sus
tained practice and fatiguing application.
Finally, it should be noted that when autonomy is
equated with negative freedom in Berlin's sense —
that is to say with freedom from restraints — and
when freedom from restraints is conceived as imply
ing freedom from any imposed norms or standards,
autonomy loses its value As Sartre showed in
Being and Nothingness, freedom without
guidelines is a burden; it is the freedom of the travel
ler lost in the jungle without a map, who can move in
any direction he wishes but has no basis for choos
ing one direction rather than another. From the
psychological point of view, this kind of freedom
results either in existential despair or in a kind of
narcissism which, valuing only sensations and ple
asures of the moment, and fearing the restraint of
any firm commitments, ends by trivalizing the very
pleasures it claims to prize. l 2 It also serves to de
stroy community with others; cooperation among
individuals is impossible where there are no com
monly accepted standards of acceptable and unac
ceptable behavior, because nobody can count on
what others will do. And even the ideal of universal
brotherhood is weakened if it is taken to imply free
dom from any concrete responsibilities to any par
ticular human beings 13
In a society where catchwords tend to replace
critical inquiry, words like freedom' and autonomy
take on a life of their own and acquire a special
emotional force, as if they represented absolute
goods. If autonomy is valuable, we easily assume
that the more autonomy we have the better off we
are, and that a condition of unlimited autonomy must
be best of all But such is not the case Individual
freedom and autonomy are vitally important as in
strumental goods, but to convert them into absolute
goods is to destroy their function.
V
In the foregoing section we have argued that re
quirements, far from being an evil, are, in fact,
necessary for the purposes of a liberal education
Here we may be more specific about requirements
at Stanford.
The Stanford undergraduate curriculum currentty
includes two requirements One is that of the Major,
based on the pnnciple of study in depth This re
quirement was re-examined and reaffirmed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (Campus
Report, 130ct. 1976, p.B). The other is the recently
redefined Distnbution Requirement wtiich aims to
provide the breadth of study necessary for a liberal
eAjcation to yield "a richer personal life through the
development of spaciousness of mind and spirit
The Distribution Requirements exist to ensure ex
posure to different ideas and different ways of think
ing They should enable (one) to understand better
the major ways of knowing,' to assess their
strengths and limitations, to appreciate their un
iqueness, and no less importantly to discern what
they have in common" (DRAT, p 21).
Under the present system, work in the three re
quired areas entails the study of certain works of
creative imagination in their cultural and histoncal
contexts, or of certain problems of philosophy and
belief (Humanities); the study of society, social in
stitutions. and human behavior (Social Saences);
and the study of natural phenomena, technology,
and math (NS/M/T) The stress in each area is upon
approaches, scholarly methods, and the general
human significance of the vanous kinds of study In
addition, for each area, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommends development of
groups of correlated courses; in Humanities the
courses chosen to fulfil the requirement must form a
group which can be certified" by the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (directly approved by the Dean
if the group is chosen by a student, indirectly, if set
up by a department)
The pnnaple of breadth is thus fulfilled by requir

ing a certain amount of study in the three areas into
which human knowledge has been conveniently di
vided. Vet, within each area, a different principle of
order is invoked, and a broad, comprehensive out
look is neither required nor encouraged Moreover,
no principles are stated for the organization of cor re
lated groups or "sequences" within the areas. Nor
has advice been given to departments on the ways
in which they should, in practice, "group" their own
courses or correlate them with courses in other de
partments
In addition, students have not been advised about
the designing of a Humanities program which might
be acceptable to the Doan. Much of the "freedom"
prescribed by SES was predicated on the assump
tion that undergraduate advising, especially for un
declared majors (freshman and sophomore years),
would be vigorous and that the "strongly recom
mended" alternatives and choices would be made
under vigilant academic guidance. Unfortunately,
the faculty, as advisors, cannot peiform the neces
sary academic surveillance given the laissoz fain)
philosophy of the present system.
This loosely structured program may have some
merit in that it recognizes the validity of both syn
chronic and diachronic methods of study, however,
it is impractical and unwittingly misleading. A stu
dent can easily justify the coherence of a group of
three courses, on say, the liteiature, art and society
of fifth-century Athens, or that of a group embracing
the three story-tellers Homer, Dorothy Richardson
and Dostoyevsky, or even that of any three courses
taught by an individual professor.
Are these two requirements — Major and Dis
tribution — an adequate foundation for a liberal
education? We feel that they are not. The student
certainly needs the intellectual methods proper to
the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences which the Distribution Requirement is
supposed to provide. But a good liberal education
has to be more comprehensive. It must include
some systematic study of the fundamental nature
and development of the culture and civilization
within which the student is living and to which he will
someday contribute. It must also provide basic in
formation about the complexities of modern society,
the means to analyse and evaluate that society, and
the perspective necessary to judge it on a compara
tive basis. In addition, the student should have some
knowledge of a culture remote from his own — a
culture outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition, suc h
as Greek or Asian — which will confront him with
ideas that challenge his unconscious assumptions
about his own time and place.
Many who agree in principle with such educa
tional ideals feel that they cannot be achieved. We
disagree. This is a university rich in teaching re
sources which has demonstrated on other occa
sions an ability to make sensible and worthwhile
educational innovations when they have been
needed. They are needed now. Departments and
individual instructors are well-equipped to deal with
the task at hand, and we should certainly draw on
our excellent teaching resources.
The Report of the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford has
suggested certain specific ways in which, through a
program of "tracks," undergraduate education
could achieve the strength and the focus it lacks at
the moment. The Report also mentions the desira
bility of historical and comparative studies whereby
modern Western culture can be confr onted not only
with past stages of its development, but also with
manifestations of other cultures. The program en
visioned by the Report is based partly on existing
courses covering the Western tradition. This prog
ram would allow the student to choose among four
approaches — literature and language; history; re
ligion and philosophy, or the creative and perform
ing arts — all leading to the same goal. This ap
proach would give to each student an educational
program more coherent than the present one.
The appropriate authorities — the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, the Doan of Undar
graduate Studies, the Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (where most under
graduate teaching takes place) — must now de
velop a plan for providing, either through new
courses or through the adaptation of existing
courses, a method for satisfying the educational
needs we have outlined. Those authorities should
also consider how that plan, when in operation,
could be monitored effectively T he responsibility
our University has to its undergraduates and the
obligation it has to its reputation demands that such
action be taken promptly.
Having outlined our views in this general stato
ment, we intend to publish in the next few months a
series of position papers suggesting concrete im
provements to undergraduate education at Stan
ford.

For approximately one year, a group o
humanities faculty members, gathering together tc
discuss issues of mutual concern, has debated the
merits of the present structure of the undergraduate
curriculum at Stanford. Events both local and na
tional have encouraged this sustained debate. The
group has had, moreover, the opportunity to hear, al
its informal sessions, the opinions of some of the
' officers of the University who could be expected to
play key roles in the elaboration of the under
graduate curnculum in future years. Among these
officers have been the President, the Dean ol
Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Under
gracfcjate Studies, and the Dean of Admissions.
What herewith follows is not necessarily a reflec
tion of the attitudes of any one of these officers, nor
of any one faculty member Rather, the group as a
whole would now like to offer to the campus com
munity a statement bearing on the design of that
curnculum. The group recognizes that it possesses
neither final wisdom nor institutional authority in
matters such as these; it also recognizes that exten
sive planning remains to be done before revisions in
the curriculum can be addopted
The group speaks, however, with a sense ol
urgency. It is satisfied neither with the quality of the
intellectual life, nor with the goals and standards of
the undergraduate program. It believes, moreover,
that dissatisfaction, at times expressed and at other
times muted, is a sentiment shared by many faculty
members at Stanford. Nor is such a condition
merely local. Discussion within the group has been
enlivened in the past year by the clear recognition
that the problems Stanford now faces (and must
rigorously attempt to resolve) are problems affect
ing every prestigious institution of higher learning.
That the problems are national in their dimensions is
indicated by, among other things, the special
1974-75 issues of Daedalus (Journal of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences) wherein
eighty-four distinguished educators, including sev
eral from Stanford, speak to the conditions now
defining academic life. Differences among these
educators are certainly present, but all are
frightened, as the editor says, "by what they see as
a lack of concern for intellectual values, others worry
about what they think to be a reduced social con
sciousness." The perspective in which this deep
concern, on both the national level and the local
level, takes place is more serious, of course, than
the question of which course or courses must be
required of the undergraduate. It is more serious
than any particular detail. But details and particulars
will, at the appropriate moment, play their crucial
part when revisions in the curriculum are proposed
and then established. The editor of Daedalus de
scribes the newly emergent situation not as "a re
petition of the discussion that occurred in the middle
of the nineteenth century when a rigid, classically
oriented college curriculum was challenged by the
new theoretical and applied sciences. Much more is
at stake today; the continued viability of the concept
of the liberally-educated person is involved."
About the continued viability the Stanford com
munity has the deepest obligation to be concerned.
In the immediate past, that concern has been ex
pressed by the Report of the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stan
ford. The spirit of that Report, in which a clear com
mitment to a requirement in Western Culture is af
firmed, must be sustained and nourished. Hence
the informal Humanities and Sciences group is
happy to note that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has recently, and unanimously, also en
dorsed "the principle that studies in Western Culture
should be part of each student's education."
Discussions within the group have also been in
vigorated by the understanding that the problems
Stanford now faces are not purely national but are
Stanford's own This university must fulfill the spe
cial obligations it has as a private institution, of great
prestige, within a state and a geography dominated
by non-private institutions Its mission has been,
and is, special; so can be the quality of its under
graduate education. To this obligation President
Richard W. Lyman has often spoken, and most tel
lingly speaks in the pages of Daedalus, where he
says
We who are responsible for the continuing
health of our "little platoons" — and even
the greatest of the private universities are
"little platoons" when matched against the
dimensions of state-supported higher edu
cation — we have our work cut out for us...
one virture that ought to be within the reach
of independent institutions, be they old or
new, famous or obscure, is that of rigorous
self-definition.
It is to that rigor arte 1 that self-definition that Stan
ford's attention must now turn Prompted, then, by
both the national anxiety and concern, and opposed
to the idle, helpless notion that little can be done in
the face of curricular and intellectual complexity, this
statement is offered to the Stanford community It is
hoped that it will play some effective part in discus
sions within the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
and the Academic Senate.
The pnnciples underlying the 1968 Study of Edu
cation at Stanford are treated here first. That Study
predates the Report of the Committee on the Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
and by virtue of the seriousness and thoughtfulness
with which it was undertaken, has achieved a con
siderable weight in later discussions of curricular
reform But as the Study itself observes, its spirit
was one of "self-examination and self-renewal." It
further observes that "the study of education must
become a process rather than event." Eight years
have since passed: changes now seem wholly
proper and necessary In the light, then, of such
changes to be made, a second matter for discussion
follows the first It is a consideration of the newly
formulated system of distnbution requirements. Al
though that system is the product of much labor on
the part of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, it does not coherently and directly address
the fundamental inadequacies of the present cur
ncular program for the undergraduate student, it is a
system that is too diffuse and too loosely monitored
to be able to do so Only by a program that is more
coherently structured can the mtellecuual life of the
Stanford student be made more challenging, in
tense, and rewarding
II
The basic philosophy of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). published in 1968-69, was that of
educational laissez fairs This is reflected in two
parallel pronouncements, the first of which ap
peared in the general introductory section of the
report and the second in the section on under
graduate education
"Let fie objectrve of curncular planning be
to encourage the faculty member to teach
what he likes to teach and the student to
learn what seems vital to him — the Intellec
tual History of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century rather than the History of Western
Civilization Modern Consciousness rather
than Freshman English. Organizational Be
havior rather than Introduction to Sociology
— and from this common freedom may
emerge a form of general education far bet
ter suited to the cftaractennbcs of a umver
slty than that to which we pay lip service

now." (Vol. I, p. 14)
And again:
"The objective toward which curriculum
planning should strive is, to the extent pos
sible, to let the teacher teach what he wants
to teach and the student learn what he
wants to learn." (Vol. II, p. 12)
Now philosophies of laissez faire can be arrived at
in different ways and supported or defended on
different grounds. Having in mind Isaiah Berlin's
significant distinction between positive and negative
conceptions of freedom — possitive freedom being
freedom for the achievement of some end deemed
desirable, negative freedom being freedom from
restraint on the assumption that restraint is wrong in
itself 1 — we can roughly distinguish between posi
tive and negative philosophies of laissez faire.
Adam Smith's views concerning economic be
havior were positive in this sense, not because they
were necessarily correct, but because they were
based on extensive inquiries into the nature of
wealth, the nature of human motivation and be
havior, and a clear belief in the desirability of the
conditions to which he thought a free market
economy would contribute. One may, of course,
quarrel with his views, but the fact remains that he
had a carefully worked out theory of social welfare
and advocated free enterprise as the best means of
achieving it. It is not inconceivable that a positive
doctrine of educational laissez faire might be simi
larly grounded on some carefully worked out and
coherent theory of the objectives, functions, and
social impact of higher education. But SES failed to
provide any such theory Instead it provided a nega
tive philosophy of laissez faire based on the view
that in higher education, restraints of any kind are
inherently bad. Moreover, this view was itself based
on a curiously narrow and dubious line of argument
which calls for special attention and comment.
The SES committee took the position that it ought
to base its "proposed reponses to the problems of
education at Stanford on careful consideration of
the meaning of education for individual teacher and
student and of the nature of the university" (Vol. I, p.
8). So far, so good. But it then proceeded to deal
with these questions, not by considering the general
objectives, functions and possible impact of higher
education in and on today's society, nor by consider
ing the important "new dimensions" which it had
cited in the opening sentence of its report as having
been introduced by the student unrest of the 1960's.
Instead, the Committee attempted to deal with all
these questions by the simple expedient of examin
ing the etymology of the single world, education '
The Committee established its "basic premises" i

as follows:
To establish our basic premises we must
begin with our conceptions of education and
of a university. The world 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educere meaning to
lead forth.' To lead does not mean to com
pel, or to push, or to pull. It means quite
simply what it says.. (1,10)
On this foundation it was immediately concluded
(among other things) that education "can never be
compelled nor can knowledge be impressed on a
mind unwilling to learn if it is to be more than indoc
trination'' (I, 10). It was also inferred (without any
corresponding concern for the etymology of the
word "university") that "the University can nevei
educate in the true sense of the word, but it can
supply the environment and the means necessary
to insure that those who came here may educate
each other and themselves'' (I, 10). In short, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, the weight of the
whole report seems to have rested upon the pre
sumed etymology of the word educate.'
The deficiences of this approach are obvious:
1 Words change their meanings. Hence even i
this particular etymology were adequately stated, i
could give no more than a tentative and partial hin
as to the present meaning of the word "education."
2. Given a complex enterprise like that of moderr
education, many different words are involved. If we
are to rely on etymology, we ought surely to con
sider also the etymologies of a variety of other En
glish words which are relevant to education, such as
learning, training, study, scholarship, instruction,
teaching, tutoring, lecturing, research, etc. These
would yield different results, reflecting the simple
fact that education has many facets, and dimen
sions, which cannot be captured by looking at any
simplified etymology of any single word.
3. On the Latin side, we should note first that in
addition to the verb educere (3rd conjugation) on
which the SES committee chose to rely, there was
another related Latin verb, educare (Ist conjuga
tion) meaning 'to train, to rear, to bring up ' It is from
the latter (and its nouneducatfo) that our word edu
cation' is most immediately derived. Secondly, the
Romans had several other verbs which they applied
to the process of education, including instituere,
instruere, and erudire. None of these suggests to
lead forth ; the first two suggested the idea of estab
lishing,' constructing' or setting in order, while the
last implied making smooth.'
Thus the committee's central line of argument —
the first among its "basic premises" — must be
rejected as wholly misconceived This fact does not,
of course, necessarily refute the laissez faire
philosophy which the committee derived from it; as
previously observed, that philosophy might con
ceivably be supported on other grounds. However,
since no other basis was supplied, the committee's
general conclusion stands unsupported. We are left
with, at best, a negative theory of laissez faire — a
theory which might as well have been adopted out of
sheer inertia or even from an impulse to deflate
student po'itical demands by making educational
concessions 2 On this view, educational restraints
are wrong primarily because they are burdensome
and because they are disliked. Eliminating require
ments is good because freedom is good, in and of
itself If teachers are free to teach what they want to
teach and students are free to learn what they want
to leam, we may trust that everybody will benefit and
that the proper interests of society will be served
111
The question now is whether that trust has been
vindicated or discredited The indications are
mounting that it has been discredited — that the kind
of educational laissez faire recommended by the
SES report has already been found seriously defi
cient Several emerging difficulties call for particular
attention.
1 The problem of standards
Derek Bok, President of Harvard University (and
a Stanford alumnus) began a recent article "On the
Purposes of Undergraduate Education' (Daedalus.
Fall, 1974, pp 159-172) as follows
"Scholars who study the behavior of
human organizations constantly stress the
importance of defining institutional goals
Without dear objectives, it is said, an mstitu
tion cannot evaluate how well it is perform
ing, decide how to allocate its resources
wisely, plan for future growth, motivate its
members, or justify its existence to the
larger public
"Despite these admonitions, our colleges
seem to exist without making much of an
effort to define their aims In the thick reports
on undergraduate education that many col
leges have produced in recent years, there
is little discuMion of what it is that a liberal
arts education should provide for me stu-

dent. The prevailing sentiment is captured
by the statement of a curriculum committee
in one of our most distinguished univer
sities: The objective toward which cur
riculum planning should strive is, to the ex
tent possible, to let the teacher teach what
he wants to teach and the student learn
t what he wants to learn.' "
It should be noted lhat the concluding sentence,
cited as exemplifying a prevalent defiaency, is bor
rowed from the SES report; it is the second of the
two excerpts quoted at the beginning of this paper
Bok's point is that the SES philosophy of laissez
faire provides no standards for directing or evaluat
ing any aspect of the academic enterprise, or judg
ing academic performance. If the controlling objec
tive is to allow teachers and students to do whatever
they prefer, why should the university not provide
instruction in basketweaving? If it be replied that
accepted standards of academic excellence and
competence are assumed, the question arises
where such standards originate and how they are
maintained. To the extent that they are needed, the
laissez faire philosophy is thereby shown to be in
adequate
It is one thing to maintain that teachers should
enjoy teaching and that students should enjoy learn
ing, but it is something else to say that immediate
enjoyment — which can vary according to the fash
ions of the day — is to be taken as the primary
measure of academic success. It is perhaps worth
remarking that while the SES report relied on Alfred
North Whitehead's observation that the University's
justification is to preserve "the connection between
knowledge and the zest of life, by uniting the young
and the old in the imaginative consideration of learn
ing" (SES, I, 10) it failed to note that in the same
essay (as well as elsewhere in his writings on edu
cation) Whitehead stressed the need for a "discip
line of imagination" so that the superior vigor of the
young should be tempered by the superior experi
ence of the elders. The persistent problem of educa
tion, in Whitehead's view, is to combine discipline
and imagination so that neither destroys the other.
In his words, "qualities essential at a later stage of a
career are apt to be stamped out in an earlier stage
This is only an instance of the more general fact, that
technical excellence can only be acquired by a train
ing which is apt to damage those energies of mind
which should direct the technical skill. This is the key
fact in education, and the reason for most of its
difficulties." 3
2. Problems of specialization and vocationalism
The Harvard report of 1945, General Education in
a Free Society, probably the most widely influential t
report on higher issued in the decadea
immediate following World War II, devoted most of
its attention to a discussion of the purposes and
functions of education in a free society, "It is fruit
less," the Harvard committee wrote, "to think about
any such practical step as a curriculum without hav
ing in mind specifications or points of reference, in
this case the ends toward which the curriculum
should look and the students for whom it is in
tended." 4
The main problems of education were there attri
buted to three sources: first, the progressive expan
sion of knowledge with the attendant multiplication
of specialisms and sub-specialisms in all areas;
second, the great increase in the number of college
students as opportunities for education beyond the
high-school were extended from the privileged few
and made available to young people at large; and
third, to the increasing complexity of modern society
itself. To cope with these problems, the Harvard
committee felt that education at the college level
ought to perform a dual role. It must, on the one
hand, fully recognize the need for increasing
specialization and provide a foundation for students
going on to careers or vocations requiring particular
skills in diverse areas. But it must at the same time
seek to balance the fragmentation and atomization
threatened by the multiplication of specialties by
finding some unifying dimension or dimensions. It
was concluded that the latter function required re
newed stress on the sort of education that had been
traditionally called "liberal education," specifically
the kind of education designed to develop the
natural capacities of the student as a human being
regardless of the particular social role which he or
she might subsequently fill. "Our conclusion, then,"
wrote the Harvard committee in 1945," is that the
aim of education should be to prepare an individual
to become an expert both in some particular voca
tion or art and in the general art of the free man and
the citizen. Thus the two kinds of education once
given separately to different social classes must be
given to all alike." 5
These views are cited not to suggest that the
curricular innovations recommended by the Har
vard committee in 1945 accomplished their purpose
(which is open to serious debate) but to show that
the committee identified — and tried to meet —
three problems which became more and more pres
sing in the ensuing years Among these, the con
tinued multiplication of specialisms with spreading
emphasis on the importance to the student of de
veloping marketable skills, at a high level of sophis
tication, has proved perhaps the most intractable
One way to deal with this problem is, of course, to do
nothing — to drift with the prevailing current rather
than attempt to swim against it. The SES report, with
its philosophy of laissez faire, does exactly that
Since increasing specialism is the order of the day.
and since competent scholars are specialists, it can
be claimed, "realism" dictates that we accept that
fact, adapting our education to it and letting
threatened dangers take care of themselves But
some of those threatened dangers have already
become actual.

(i) As the opinion spreads that the main function of
higher education is to develop in the student mar
ketable skills — what Steven Miller, President of
Johns Hopkins, calls "higher skilling" as opposed to
higher education 8 — for a job market which is al
ready oversaturated, the value of a college educa
tion is necessanly depreciated. If it were recog
nized, however, that the chief function of a college
education is to develop the human potential of the
student without regard to the particular job he or she
might eventually hold or the particular social role he
or she might occupy, the result would be otherwise
Success or failure in the job market would not be
considered so crucial There is here an illustration of
the point made before, that the objectives (or sup
posed objectives) of education always provide the
criteria for evaluating success or failure
(ii) In regard to the nature and status if knowledge,
Steven Muller, in the article just mentioned, asked
the pregnant question If all our scholars are stand
ing at the frontiers of knowledge, who is standing at
the center? Is there today any center? If not, how
can there be any community of scholars in the tradi
tional sense?
Under present conditions, there is no genuine
community of teachers or students in any college or
university, but rather an aggregate of specialists
and students, each pursuing his or her own sepa
rate interests in geographical proximity, with little or
no basis for cross-disciplinary communication or
understanding One consequence is that most scho
lars feel more affinity with, and more respect for,
their professional colleagues in other universities
than for members of other departments in their own
And there is no longer any unity of knowledge, but
only a collocation of separate knowledges Such a
situation may. perhaps, be defended certainly it is
preferable to an ideological uniformity arbitrarily im
posed But surety there is a middle ground between

these extremes. Muller considers that some return
to general education, with universal requirements
for English, for a second language, for cultural his
tory, and for science, is necessary to restore the
un 'ty of genuine education.
What all our scholars in different disciplines have
in common is that they are all human beings, that
they all share the same cultural inheritance, and that
they are all engaged (or should be) in the same
quest — the quest for greater knowledge and wider
understanding. And we do well, we believe, to recall
the observation of Arthur Lovejoy that he who knows
only his own special field may not know what is most
worth looking lor in his special field. 7
#ii) An extensive investigation recently conducted
byktwo ecfcjcation reporters of the Los Angeles
Tunes into the concurrent phenomena of progres
sive grade inflation along with progressive decline in
the average level of students' proficiency has been
the widespread substitution of new elective
oourses, sometimes lacking in academic rigor, for
the kind of basic courses which used to be required
for all students. 8 Though the demonstration is not
conclusive, it is at least persuasively documented
As against suggestions that the decline in test
scores is due to other causes — such as altered
family structures, the increased number of less qual
ified students, regional factors, or the unreliability of
test scores — the authors of the report point out that
the two areas where test scores have not declined
but held steady or advanced are the areas in which
basic requirements have been largely retained, i.e.,
in the first three primary grades in school and in the
sciences at post-secondary level. These investiga
tions, which are too long to summanze, are worth
senous attention. At least, they cannot be ignored,
despite the attempts of some educators to dismiss
or discount them.
(iv) There is clear evidence that college students
today resent the increasingly competitive atmos
phere of post-secondary education. 9 It seems to be
a fair inference that the competitive aspect reflects
the increasing emphasis in higher education upon
the development of marketable skills. When stu
dents are competing for entrance to professional
schools or for jobs requiring technical proficiency,
and when good grades are seen as important for
Stich purposes, the process of college education
naturally comes to be seen as a struggle of each
against all; for admission to a limited number of
'ftllure positions. But liberal education, in the tradi
tional sense, has a different character. The
philosopher Spinoza pointed out that intellectual
goods sought for their own sake are non-
C9mpetitive. If one person achieves wisdom or in
creased insight, he is not threatened but reinforced
if his neighbors do likewise. Here is one major dif
ference between virtues of character and technical
skills, at least where the latter determine job oppor
tunities. Nothing is so useful or agreeable to the
virtuous man, Spinoza wrote, as the company of
others who are like-minded. Where self-realization
or self-improvement is the aim rather than voca
tional proficiency — as is the case with liberal edu
cation — emulation can be a spur without being a
threat. And the community of scholars, for teachers
and students alike, rests upon such a foundation
Thef search for "higher skilling" is centrifugal; the
search for liberal education is centripetal. A student
whose aim is self-development or self-improvement
as a human being values grades only as indications
of his own progress, not for any advantage they may
give over others.

(v) As our society becomes increasingly complex,
as specialisms multiply, and as it becomes increas
ingly apparent that the most serious problems ex
tend over many diciplines, it follows, as Professor
Gabriel Almond has observed, that "only higher
order philosophical syntheses can spell out the big
issues and formulate alternative solutions." 10 At the
same time, our society is becoming more and more
susceptible at all levels to the pull of simplistic slo
gans, catchwords, images, stereotypes and
counter-stereotypes. In this situation the need for
critical intelligence and balanced judgment is be
coming more and more acute, yet this need is not
likely to be apparent to the beginning student, par
ticularly if he is bent on acquiring some particular
skill. The SES report quoted approvingly an obser
vation of Professor Edwin M. Good to the effect that
the important simplicities are those which lie "on the
other side of complexity" (Vol. I, p. 11). Surely the
proper inference is that today's student, seeking tp
pick his way through the growing thicket of com
plexities towards some thoughtful and balanced
overview — as opposed to the delusive simplicities
offered by catchwords and fashionable stereotypes
— needs more guidance and direction than ever
before. The claim of the SES committee that today's
student is in a better position than anybody else to
choose the academic path he will take (Vol. I. p. 15)
seems like saying that the thicker the forest be
comes, the less need there is to require would-be
travellers to take a guide.
IV
Recommendations for achieving the aims of lib
eral education generally envisage imposed re
quirements covenng, in addition to courses in En
glish and in a foreign language, a required course or
courses in Western culture or the history of ideas
We are not concerned here with particular prog
rams, but with the sort of objections most commonly
raised against imposing such requirements.
1. It is often claimed that a required course in
Western culture or the history of ideas in the West is
chauvinistic, since it implies the superiority of the
Western tradition above other traditions The objec
tion is misconceived The purpose of studying the
Western tradition is not to celebrate it but to under
stand It — for good or ill. To evaluate Western
culture, or any other culture, without first making the
effort to understand it is to judge irrationally without
adequate evidence Many people make this very
mistake, but the fact that the mistake is common
affords a good reason for trying to correct it.
2. It is often claimed that requiring students to
study any particular subject is arbitrary because no
particular subject is intrinsically more important than
any other One might, so the argument goes, make
as good a case for general requirement in, say,
psychology or the scientific study of human be
havior The answer here is that all heirs of the West
ern tradition — whether specialists or generalists,
students or faculty, regardless of their special in
terests and capacities — are themselves con
ditioned by Western culture The same is true of all
the specialized disciplines which have developed in
the West they all reflect distinctively Western con
ceptions of rationality and the role of systematic
inquiry '' (Xir heritage affects our preconceptions
about the nature and function of scientific know
ledge as well as our preconceptions about values
and norms It is not too much to say that no person
can hope to understand who he or she is without
some understanding of the cultural context, handed
down from prior generations, in which he or she
presently exists Nobody lives, thinks, or talks in a
cultural void Nobody is exempt from cultural influ
ences Hence the peculiar importance of a general
requirement that students systematically examine
the cultural background which they all share
3 It is sometimes objected that a cultural re
quirement would put a premium on conformity to
accepted values We would suggest that the oppo
site is true The dangerous conformities are those
which are blind, unconscious, and uncritical Most
cultures breed rebels as well as conformists, as our

culture has. If a required course in Western culture
is designed (as above noted) to promote the accu
rate understanding of the Western orientation, the
result should be to make both rebels and confor
mists more dearly aware of what it is that they are
rejecting or accepting.
4. It has been objected that there is no reliable
evidence by which we can evaluate the effective
ness of general courses of the kind here envisaged;
hence they should not be required. We grant the
premise but reject the conclusion. The difficulty of
evaluation arises principally, we think, from the fact
that a good educational program has, or should
have, a long-term impact upon the student, and
such impacts are not precisely identifiable or quanti
fiable. To insist too much on precise evaluations
tends to put the emphasis on those short-term be
nefits and immediate satisfaction which can be as
certained, at the expense of the lasting benefits
which can be recognized, if at all, only in retrospect.
However this may be, the present objection cuts
both ways. If we cannot measure in advance the
precise effectiveness of a proposed requirement,
we cannot measure the relative effectiveness of a
program from which such requirements are omitted.
5. It has been claimed that students cannot be
made to learn what they do not wish to learn, or, as
last year s Council of ASSU Presidents put it, "You
can lead a student to a class but you can't make one
think." This position calls for clarification, because it
is highly ambiguous.
Much of what we learn from everyday experience
is not chosen, but forced upon us, often against our
wills, like learning that hot stoves can burn or that
careless driving invites serious accidents. With re
gard to required courses, the evidence is that many
generations of Stanford graduates found value in,
and claim to have profited from, the old course in
Western Civilization despite its having been pre
scribed. Many required courses in other colleges
and universities seem to have had substantial suc
cess. It is evident that the present objection is over
stated.
Perhaps we should interpret it to mean that stu
dents learn better when they study subjects which
they enjoy. There is some truth in this, but there is
also room for a serious confusion. One may enjoy
the process of studying a subject without liking or
approving the subject under study. A medical stu
dent, for example, does not normally enjoy or ap
prove of diseases A student of criminal behavior
does not normally enjoy or approve of crime. Such
students take satisfaction in learning how to cope
with the problems created by disease and crime. So
also a student of Western culture need not like or
approve of Western culture as such in order to find
satisfaction in making a study of it. If this distinction
is kept in mind, a further point emerges, namely, that
nobody can judge whether studying a given subject
will yield satisfaction or prove valuable to him until
after he has engaged in it. Students who view all
required courses as an infringement upon their
freedom of choice sometimes forget that freedom to
make informed choices is not the same as freedom
to make uninformed choices.
It used to be taken lor granted that if students
came to college, it was because they wished to be
made to think, this being accepted as an essential
part of a college education. The present argument,
however, introduces a distinction, as if students
were now saying: "Please give us an education, but
don't make us Slink — or at least, don't make us
think any more than we like or about topics we don't
like." Such a position, if taken seriously, would make
disciplined thinking peripheral rather than central to
the educational process, since disciplined thinking
is usually laborious and the habit of disciplined think
ing can only be acquired, like other skills, by sus
tained practice and fatiguing application.
Finally, it should be noted that when autonomy is
equated with negative freedom in Berlin's sense —
that is to say with freedom from restraints — and
when freedom from restraints is conceived as imply
ing freedom from any imposed norms or standards,
autonomy loses its value As Sartre showed in
Being and Nothingness, freedom without
guidelines is a burden; it is the freedom of the travel
ler lost in the jungle without a map, who can move in
any direction he wishes but has no basis for choos
ing one direction rather than another. From the
psychological point of view, this kind of freedom
results either in existential despair or in a kind of
narcissism which, valuing only sensations and ple
asures of the moment, and fearing the restraint of
any firm commitments, ends by trivalizing the very
pleasures it claims to prize. l 2 It also serves to de
stroy community with others; cooperation among
individuals is impossible where there are no com
monly accepted standards of acceptable and unac
ceptable behavior, because nobody can count on
what others will do. And even the ideal of universal
brotherhood is weakened if it is taken to imply free
dom from any concrete responsibilities to any par
ticular human beings 13
In a society where catchwords tend to replace
critical inquiry, words like freedom' and autonomy
take on a life of their own and acquire a special
emotional force, as if they represented absolute
goods. If autonomy is valuable, we easily assume
that the more autonomy we have the better off we
are, and that a condition of unlimited autonomy must
be best of all But such is not the case Individual
freedom and autonomy are vitally important as in
strumental goods, but to convert them into absolute
goods is to destroy their function.
V
In the foregoing section we have argued that re
quirements, far from being an evil, are, in fact,
necessary for the purposes of a liberal education
Here we may be more specific about requirements
at Stanford.
The Stanford undergraduate curriculum currentty
includes two requirements One is that of the Major,
based on the pnnciple of study in depth This re
quirement was re-examined and reaffirmed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (Campus
Report, 130ct. 1976, p.B). The other is the recently
redefined Distnbution Requirement wtiich aims to
provide the breadth of study necessary for a liberal
eAjcation to yield "a richer personal life through the
development of spaciousness of mind and spirit
The Distribution Requirements exist to ensure ex
posure to different ideas and different ways of think
ing They should enable (one) to understand better
the major ways of knowing,' to assess their
strengths and limitations, to appreciate their un
iqueness, and no less importantly to discern what
they have in common" (DRAT, p 21).
Under the present system, work in the three re
quired areas entails the study of certain works of
creative imagination in their cultural and histoncal
contexts, or of certain problems of philosophy and
belief (Humanities); the study of society, social in
stitutions. and human behavior (Social Saences);
and the study of natural phenomena, technology,
and math (NS/M/T) The stress in each area is upon
approaches, scholarly methods, and the general
human significance of the vanous kinds of study In
addition, for each area, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommends development of
groups of correlated courses; in Humanities the
courses chosen to fulfil the requirement must form a
group which can be certified" by the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (directly approved by the Dean
if the group is chosen by a student, indirectly, if set
up by a department)
The pnnaple of breadth is thus fulfilled by requir

ing a certain amount of study in the three areas into
which human knowledge has been conveniently di
vided. Vet, within each area, a different principle of
order is invoked, and a broad, comprehensive out
look is neither required nor encouraged Moreover,
no principles are stated for the organization of cor re
lated groups or "sequences" within the areas. Nor
has advice been given to departments on the ways
in which they should, in practice, "group" their own
courses or correlate them with courses in other de
partments
In addition, students have not been advised about
the designing of a Humanities program which might
be acceptable to the Doan. Much of the "freedom"
prescribed by SES was predicated on the assump
tion that undergraduate advising, especially for un
declared majors (freshman and sophomore years),
would be vigorous and that the "strongly recom
mended" alternatives and choices would be made
under vigilant academic guidance. Unfortunately,
the faculty, as advisors, cannot peiform the neces
sary academic surveillance given the laissoz fain)
philosophy of the present system.
This loosely structured program may have some
merit in that it recognizes the validity of both syn
chronic and diachronic methods of study, however,
it is impractical and unwittingly misleading. A stu
dent can easily justify the coherence of a group of
three courses, on say, the liteiature, art and society
of fifth-century Athens, or that of a group embracing
the three story-tellers Homer, Dorothy Richardson
and Dostoyevsky, or even that of any three courses
taught by an individual professor.
Are these two requirements — Major and Dis
tribution — an adequate foundation for a liberal
education? We feel that they are not. The student
certainly needs the intellectual methods proper to
the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences which the Distribution Requirement is
supposed to provide. But a good liberal education
has to be more comprehensive. It must include
some systematic study of the fundamental nature
and development of the culture and civilization
within which the student is living and to which he will
someday contribute. It must also provide basic in
formation about the complexities of modern society,
the means to analyse and evaluate that society, and
the perspective necessary to judge it on a compara
tive basis. In addition, the student should have some
knowledge of a culture remote from his own — a
culture outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition, suc h
as Greek or Asian — which will confront him with
ideas that challenge his unconscious assumptions
about his own time and place.
Many who agree in principle with such educa
tional ideals feel that they cannot be achieved. We
disagree. This is a university rich in teaching re
sources which has demonstrated on other occa
sions an ability to make sensible and worthwhile
educational innovations when they have been
needed. They are needed now. Departments and
individual instructors are well-equipped to deal with
the task at hand, and we should certainly draw on
our excellent teaching resources.
The Report of the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford has
suggested certain specific ways in which, through a
program of "tracks," undergraduate education
could achieve the strength and the focus it lacks at
the moment. The Report also mentions the desira
bility of historical and comparative studies whereby
modern Western culture can be confr onted not only
with past stages of its development, but also with
manifestations of other cultures. The program en
visioned by the Report is based partly on existing
courses covering the Western tradition. This prog
ram would allow the student to choose among four
approaches — literature and language; history; re
ligion and philosophy, or the creative and perform
ing arts — all leading to the same goal. This ap
proach would give to each student an educational
program more coherent than the present one.
The appropriate authorities — the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, the Doan of Undar
graduate Studies, the Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (where most under
graduate teaching takes place) — must now de
velop a plan for providing, either through new
courses or through the adaptation of existing
courses, a method for satisfying the educational
needs we have outlined. Those authorities should
also consider how that plan, when in operation,
could be monitored effectively T he responsibility
our University has to its undergraduates and the
obligation it has to its reputation demands that such
action be taken promptly.
Having outlined our views in this general stato
ment, we intend to publish in the next few months a
series of position papers suggesting concrete im
provements to undergraduate education at Stan
ford.

For approximately one year, a group o
humanities faculty members, gathering together tc
discuss issues of mutual concern, has debated the
merits of the present structure of the undergraduate
curriculum at Stanford. Events both local and na
tional have encouraged this sustained debate. The
group has had, moreover, the opportunity to hear, al
its informal sessions, the opinions of some of the
' officers of the University who could be expected to
play key roles in the elaboration of the under
graduate curnculum in future years. Among these
officers have been the President, the Dean ol
Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Under
gracfcjate Studies, and the Dean of Admissions.
What herewith follows is not necessarily a reflec
tion of the attitudes of any one of these officers, nor
of any one faculty member Rather, the group as a
whole would now like to offer to the campus com
munity a statement bearing on the design of that
curnculum. The group recognizes that it possesses
neither final wisdom nor institutional authority in
matters such as these; it also recognizes that exten
sive planning remains to be done before revisions in
the curriculum can be addopted
The group speaks, however, with a sense ol
urgency. It is satisfied neither with the quality of the
intellectual life, nor with the goals and standards of
the undergraduate program. It believes, moreover,
that dissatisfaction, at times expressed and at other
times muted, is a sentiment shared by many faculty
members at Stanford. Nor is such a condition
merely local. Discussion within the group has been
enlivened in the past year by the clear recognition
that the problems Stanford now faces (and must
rigorously attempt to resolve) are problems affect
ing every prestigious institution of higher learning.
That the problems are national in their dimensions is
indicated by, among other things, the special
1974-75 issues of Daedalus (Journal of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences) wherein
eighty-four distinguished educators, including sev
eral from Stanford, speak to the conditions now
defining academic life. Differences among these
educators are certainly present, but all are
frightened, as the editor says, "by what they see as
a lack of concern for intellectual values, others worry
about what they think to be a reduced social con
sciousness." The perspective in which this deep
concern, on both the national level and the local
level, takes place is more serious, of course, than
the question of which course or courses must be
required of the undergraduate. It is more serious
than any particular detail. But details and particulars
will, at the appropriate moment, play their crucial
part when revisions in the curriculum are proposed
and then established. The editor of Daedalus de
scribes the newly emergent situation not as "a re
petition of the discussion that occurred in the middle
of the nineteenth century when a rigid, classically
oriented college curriculum was challenged by the
new theoretical and applied sciences. Much more is
at stake today; the continued viability of the concept
of the liberally-educated person is involved."
About the continued viability the Stanford com
munity has the deepest obligation to be concerned.
In the immediate past, that concern has been ex
pressed by the Report of the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stan
ford. The spirit of that Report, in which a clear com
mitment to a requirement in Western Culture is af
firmed, must be sustained and nourished. Hence
the informal Humanities and Sciences group is
happy to note that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has recently, and unanimously, also en
dorsed "the principle that studies in Western Culture
should be part of each student's education."
Discussions within the group have also been in
vigorated by the understanding that the problems
Stanford now faces are not purely national but are
Stanford's own This university must fulfill the spe
cial obligations it has as a private institution, of great
prestige, within a state and a geography dominated
by non-private institutions Its mission has been,
and is, special; so can be the quality of its under
graduate education. To this obligation President
Richard W. Lyman has often spoken, and most tel
lingly speaks in the pages of Daedalus, where he
says
We who are responsible for the continuing
health of our "little platoons" — and even
the greatest of the private universities are
"little platoons" when matched against the
dimensions of state-supported higher edu
cation — we have our work cut out for us...
one virture that ought to be within the reach
of independent institutions, be they old or
new, famous or obscure, is that of rigorous
self-definition.
It is to that rigor arte 1 that self-definition that Stan
ford's attention must now turn Prompted, then, by
both the national anxiety and concern, and opposed
to the idle, helpless notion that little can be done in
the face of curricular and intellectual complexity, this
statement is offered to the Stanford community It is
hoped that it will play some effective part in discus
sions within the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
and the Academic Senate.
The pnnciples underlying the 1968 Study of Edu
cation at Stanford are treated here first. That Study
predates the Report of the Committee on the Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
and by virtue of the seriousness and thoughtfulness
with which it was undertaken, has achieved a con
siderable weight in later discussions of curricular
reform But as the Study itself observes, its spirit
was one of "self-examination and self-renewal." It
further observes that "the study of education must
become a process rather than event." Eight years
have since passed: changes now seem wholly
proper and necessary In the light, then, of such
changes to be made, a second matter for discussion
follows the first It is a consideration of the newly
formulated system of distnbution requirements. Al
though that system is the product of much labor on
the part of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, it does not coherently and directly address
the fundamental inadequacies of the present cur
ncular program for the undergraduate student, it is a
system that is too diffuse and too loosely monitored
to be able to do so Only by a program that is more
coherently structured can the mtellecuual life of the
Stanford student be made more challenging, in
tense, and rewarding
II
The basic philosophy of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). published in 1968-69, was that of
educational laissez fairs This is reflected in two
parallel pronouncements, the first of which ap
peared in the general introductory section of the
report and the second in the section on under
graduate education
"Let fie objectrve of curncular planning be
to encourage the faculty member to teach
what he likes to teach and the student to
learn what seems vital to him — the Intellec
tual History of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century rather than the History of Western
Civilization Modern Consciousness rather
than Freshman English. Organizational Be
havior rather than Introduction to Sociology
— and from this common freedom may
emerge a form of general education far bet
ter suited to the cftaractennbcs of a umver
slty than that to which we pay lip service

now." (Vol. I, p. 14)
And again:
"The objective toward which curriculum
planning should strive is, to the extent pos
sible, to let the teacher teach what he wants
to teach and the student learn what he
wants to learn." (Vol. II, p. 12)
Now philosophies of laissez faire can be arrived at
in different ways and supported or defended on
different grounds. Having in mind Isaiah Berlin's
significant distinction between positive and negative
conceptions of freedom — possitive freedom being
freedom for the achievement of some end deemed
desirable, negative freedom being freedom from
restraint on the assumption that restraint is wrong in
itself 1 — we can roughly distinguish between posi
tive and negative philosophies of laissez faire.
Adam Smith's views concerning economic be
havior were positive in this sense, not because they
were necessarily correct, but because they were
based on extensive inquiries into the nature of
wealth, the nature of human motivation and be
havior, and a clear belief in the desirability of the
conditions to which he thought a free market
economy would contribute. One may, of course,
quarrel with his views, but the fact remains that he
had a carefully worked out theory of social welfare
and advocated free enterprise as the best means of
achieving it. It is not inconceivable that a positive
doctrine of educational laissez faire might be simi
larly grounded on some carefully worked out and
coherent theory of the objectives, functions, and
social impact of higher education. But SES failed to
provide any such theory Instead it provided a nega
tive philosophy of laissez faire based on the view
that in higher education, restraints of any kind are
inherently bad. Moreover, this view was itself based
on a curiously narrow and dubious line of argument
which calls for special attention and comment.
The SES committee took the position that it ought
to base its "proposed reponses to the problems of
education at Stanford on careful consideration of
the meaning of education for individual teacher and
student and of the nature of the university" (Vol. I, p.
8). So far, so good. But it then proceeded to deal
with these questions, not by considering the general
objectives, functions and possible impact of higher
education in and on today's society, nor by consider
ing the important "new dimensions" which it had
cited in the opening sentence of its report as having
been introduced by the student unrest of the 1960's.
Instead, the Committee attempted to deal with all
these questions by the simple expedient of examin
ing the etymology of the single world, education '
The Committee established its "basic premises" i

as follows:
To establish our basic premises we must
begin with our conceptions of education and
of a university. The world 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educere meaning to
lead forth.' To lead does not mean to com
pel, or to push, or to pull. It means quite
simply what it says.. (1,10)
On this foundation it was immediately concluded
(among other things) that education "can never be
compelled nor can knowledge be impressed on a
mind unwilling to learn if it is to be more than indoc
trination'' (I, 10). It was also inferred (without any
corresponding concern for the etymology of the
word "university") that "the University can nevei
educate in the true sense of the word, but it can
supply the environment and the means necessary
to insure that those who came here may educate
each other and themselves'' (I, 10). In short, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, the weight of the
whole report seems to have rested upon the pre
sumed etymology of the word educate.'
The deficiences of this approach are obvious:
1 Words change their meanings. Hence even i
this particular etymology were adequately stated, i
could give no more than a tentative and partial hin
as to the present meaning of the word "education."
2. Given a complex enterprise like that of moderr
education, many different words are involved. If we
are to rely on etymology, we ought surely to con
sider also the etymologies of a variety of other En
glish words which are relevant to education, such as
learning, training, study, scholarship, instruction,
teaching, tutoring, lecturing, research, etc. These
would yield different results, reflecting the simple
fact that education has many facets, and dimen
sions, which cannot be captured by looking at any
simplified etymology of any single word.
3. On the Latin side, we should note first that in
addition to the verb educere (3rd conjugation) on
which the SES committee chose to rely, there was
another related Latin verb, educare (Ist conjuga
tion) meaning 'to train, to rear, to bring up ' It is from
the latter (and its nouneducatfo) that our word edu
cation' is most immediately derived. Secondly, the
Romans had several other verbs which they applied
to the process of education, including instituere,
instruere, and erudire. None of these suggests to
lead forth ; the first two suggested the idea of estab
lishing,' constructing' or setting in order, while the
last implied making smooth.'
Thus the committee's central line of argument —
the first among its "basic premises" — must be
rejected as wholly misconceived This fact does not,
of course, necessarily refute the laissez faire
philosophy which the committee derived from it; as
previously observed, that philosophy might con
ceivably be supported on other grounds. However,
since no other basis was supplied, the committee's
general conclusion stands unsupported. We are left
with, at best, a negative theory of laissez faire — a
theory which might as well have been adopted out of
sheer inertia or even from an impulse to deflate
student po'itical demands by making educational
concessions 2 On this view, educational restraints
are wrong primarily because they are burdensome
and because they are disliked. Eliminating require
ments is good because freedom is good, in and of
itself If teachers are free to teach what they want to
teach and students are free to learn what they want
to leam, we may trust that everybody will benefit and
that the proper interests of society will be served
111
The question now is whether that trust has been
vindicated or discredited The indications are
mounting that it has been discredited — that the kind
of educational laissez faire recommended by the
SES report has already been found seriously defi
cient Several emerging difficulties call for particular
attention.
1 The problem of standards
Derek Bok, President of Harvard University (and
a Stanford alumnus) began a recent article "On the
Purposes of Undergraduate Education' (Daedalus.
Fall, 1974, pp 159-172) as follows
"Scholars who study the behavior of
human organizations constantly stress the
importance of defining institutional goals
Without dear objectives, it is said, an mstitu
tion cannot evaluate how well it is perform
ing, decide how to allocate its resources
wisely, plan for future growth, motivate its
members, or justify its existence to the
larger public
"Despite these admonitions, our colleges
seem to exist without making much of an
effort to define their aims In the thick reports
on undergraduate education that many col
leges have produced in recent years, there
is little discuMion of what it is that a liberal
arts education should provide for me stu-

dent. The prevailing sentiment is captured
by the statement of a curriculum committee
in one of our most distinguished univer
sities: The objective toward which cur
riculum planning should strive is, to the ex
tent possible, to let the teacher teach what
he wants to teach and the student learn
t what he wants to learn.' "
It should be noted lhat the concluding sentence,
cited as exemplifying a prevalent defiaency, is bor
rowed from the SES report; it is the second of the
two excerpts quoted at the beginning of this paper
Bok's point is that the SES philosophy of laissez
faire provides no standards for directing or evaluat
ing any aspect of the academic enterprise, or judg
ing academic performance. If the controlling objec
tive is to allow teachers and students to do whatever
they prefer, why should the university not provide
instruction in basketweaving? If it be replied that
accepted standards of academic excellence and
competence are assumed, the question arises
where such standards originate and how they are
maintained. To the extent that they are needed, the
laissez faire philosophy is thereby shown to be in
adequate
It is one thing to maintain that teachers should
enjoy teaching and that students should enjoy learn
ing, but it is something else to say that immediate
enjoyment — which can vary according to the fash
ions of the day — is to be taken as the primary
measure of academic success. It is perhaps worth
remarking that while the SES report relied on Alfred
North Whitehead's observation that the University's
justification is to preserve "the connection between
knowledge and the zest of life, by uniting the young
and the old in the imaginative consideration of learn
ing" (SES, I, 10) it failed to note that in the same
essay (as well as elsewhere in his writings on edu
cation) Whitehead stressed the need for a "discip
line of imagination" so that the superior vigor of the
young should be tempered by the superior experi
ence of the elders. The persistent problem of educa
tion, in Whitehead's view, is to combine discipline
and imagination so that neither destroys the other.
In his words, "qualities essential at a later stage of a
career are apt to be stamped out in an earlier stage
This is only an instance of the more general fact, that
technical excellence can only be acquired by a train
ing which is apt to damage those energies of mind
which should direct the technical skill. This is the key
fact in education, and the reason for most of its
difficulties." 3
2. Problems of specialization and vocationalism
The Harvard report of 1945, General Education in
a Free Society, probably the most widely influential t
report on higher issued in the decadea
immediate following World War II, devoted most of
its attention to a discussion of the purposes and
functions of education in a free society, "It is fruit
less," the Harvard committee wrote, "to think about
any such practical step as a curriculum without hav
ing in mind specifications or points of reference, in
this case the ends toward which the curriculum
should look and the students for whom it is in
tended." 4
The main problems of education were there attri
buted to three sources: first, the progressive expan
sion of knowledge with the attendant multiplication
of specialisms and sub-specialisms in all areas;
second, the great increase in the number of college
students as opportunities for education beyond the
high-school were extended from the privileged few
and made available to young people at large; and
third, to the increasing complexity of modern society
itself. To cope with these problems, the Harvard
committee felt that education at the college level
ought to perform a dual role. It must, on the one
hand, fully recognize the need for increasing
specialization and provide a foundation for students
going on to careers or vocations requiring particular
skills in diverse areas. But it must at the same time
seek to balance the fragmentation and atomization
threatened by the multiplication of specialties by
finding some unifying dimension or dimensions. It
was concluded that the latter function required re
newed stress on the sort of education that had been
traditionally called "liberal education," specifically
the kind of education designed to develop the
natural capacities of the student as a human being
regardless of the particular social role which he or
she might subsequently fill. "Our conclusion, then,"
wrote the Harvard committee in 1945," is that the
aim of education should be to prepare an individual
to become an expert both in some particular voca
tion or art and in the general art of the free man and
the citizen. Thus the two kinds of education once
given separately to different social classes must be
given to all alike." 5
These views are cited not to suggest that the
curricular innovations recommended by the Har
vard committee in 1945 accomplished their purpose
(which is open to serious debate) but to show that
the committee identified — and tried to meet —
three problems which became more and more pres
sing in the ensuing years Among these, the con
tinued multiplication of specialisms with spreading
emphasis on the importance to the student of de
veloping marketable skills, at a high level of sophis
tication, has proved perhaps the most intractable
One way to deal with this problem is, of course, to do
nothing — to drift with the prevailing current rather
than attempt to swim against it. The SES report, with
its philosophy of laissez faire, does exactly that
Since increasing specialism is the order of the day.
and since competent scholars are specialists, it can
be claimed, "realism" dictates that we accept that
fact, adapting our education to it and letting
threatened dangers take care of themselves But
some of those threatened dangers have already
become actual.

(i) As the opinion spreads that the main function of
higher education is to develop in the student mar
ketable skills — what Steven Miller, President of
Johns Hopkins, calls "higher skilling" as opposed to
higher education 8 — for a job market which is al
ready oversaturated, the value of a college educa
tion is necessanly depreciated. If it were recog
nized, however, that the chief function of a college
education is to develop the human potential of the
student without regard to the particular job he or she
might eventually hold or the particular social role he
or she might occupy, the result would be otherwise
Success or failure in the job market would not be
considered so crucial There is here an illustration of
the point made before, that the objectives (or sup
posed objectives) of education always provide the
criteria for evaluating success or failure
(ii) In regard to the nature and status if knowledge,
Steven Muller, in the article just mentioned, asked
the pregnant question If all our scholars are stand
ing at the frontiers of knowledge, who is standing at
the center? Is there today any center? If not, how
can there be any community of scholars in the tradi
tional sense?
Under present conditions, there is no genuine
community of teachers or students in any college or
university, but rather an aggregate of specialists
and students, each pursuing his or her own sepa
rate interests in geographical proximity, with little or
no basis for cross-disciplinary communication or
understanding One consequence is that most scho
lars feel more affinity with, and more respect for,
their professional colleagues in other universities
than for members of other departments in their own
And there is no longer any unity of knowledge, but
only a collocation of separate knowledges Such a
situation may. perhaps, be defended certainly it is
preferable to an ideological uniformity arbitrarily im
posed But surety there is a middle ground between

these extremes. Muller considers that some return
to general education, with universal requirements
for English, for a second language, for cultural his
tory, and for science, is necessary to restore the
un 'ty of genuine education.
What all our scholars in different disciplines have
in common is that they are all human beings, that
they all share the same cultural inheritance, and that
they are all engaged (or should be) in the same
quest — the quest for greater knowledge and wider
understanding. And we do well, we believe, to recall
the observation of Arthur Lovejoy that he who knows
only his own special field may not know what is most
worth looking lor in his special field. 7
#ii) An extensive investigation recently conducted
byktwo ecfcjcation reporters of the Los Angeles
Tunes into the concurrent phenomena of progres
sive grade inflation along with progressive decline in
the average level of students' proficiency has been
the widespread substitution of new elective
oourses, sometimes lacking in academic rigor, for
the kind of basic courses which used to be required
for all students. 8 Though the demonstration is not
conclusive, it is at least persuasively documented
As against suggestions that the decline in test
scores is due to other causes — such as altered
family structures, the increased number of less qual
ified students, regional factors, or the unreliability of
test scores — the authors of the report point out that
the two areas where test scores have not declined
but held steady or advanced are the areas in which
basic requirements have been largely retained, i.e.,
in the first three primary grades in school and in the
sciences at post-secondary level. These investiga
tions, which are too long to summanze, are worth
senous attention. At least, they cannot be ignored,
despite the attempts of some educators to dismiss
or discount them.
(iv) There is clear evidence that college students
today resent the increasingly competitive atmos
phere of post-secondary education. 9 It seems to be
a fair inference that the competitive aspect reflects
the increasing emphasis in higher education upon
the development of marketable skills. When stu
dents are competing for entrance to professional
schools or for jobs requiring technical proficiency,
and when good grades are seen as important for
Stich purposes, the process of college education
naturally comes to be seen as a struggle of each
against all; for admission to a limited number of
'ftllure positions. But liberal education, in the tradi
tional sense, has a different character. The
philosopher Spinoza pointed out that intellectual
goods sought for their own sake are non-
C9mpetitive. If one person achieves wisdom or in
creased insight, he is not threatened but reinforced
if his neighbors do likewise. Here is one major dif
ference between virtues of character and technical
skills, at least where the latter determine job oppor
tunities. Nothing is so useful or agreeable to the
virtuous man, Spinoza wrote, as the company of
others who are like-minded. Where self-realization
or self-improvement is the aim rather than voca
tional proficiency — as is the case with liberal edu
cation — emulation can be a spur without being a
threat. And the community of scholars, for teachers
and students alike, rests upon such a foundation
Thef search for "higher skilling" is centrifugal; the
search for liberal education is centripetal. A student
whose aim is self-development or self-improvement
as a human being values grades only as indications
of his own progress, not for any advantage they may
give over others.

(v) As our society becomes increasingly complex,
as specialisms multiply, and as it becomes increas
ingly apparent that the most serious problems ex
tend over many diciplines, it follows, as Professor
Gabriel Almond has observed, that "only higher
order philosophical syntheses can spell out the big
issues and formulate alternative solutions." 10 At the
same time, our society is becoming more and more
susceptible at all levels to the pull of simplistic slo
gans, catchwords, images, stereotypes and
counter-stereotypes. In this situation the need for
critical intelligence and balanced judgment is be
coming more and more acute, yet this need is not
likely to be apparent to the beginning student, par
ticularly if he is bent on acquiring some particular
skill. The SES report quoted approvingly an obser
vation of Professor Edwin M. Good to the effect that
the important simplicities are those which lie "on the
other side of complexity" (Vol. I, p. 11). Surely the
proper inference is that today's student, seeking tp
pick his way through the growing thicket of com
plexities towards some thoughtful and balanced
overview — as opposed to the delusive simplicities
offered by catchwords and fashionable stereotypes
— needs more guidance and direction than ever
before. The claim of the SES committee that today's
student is in a better position than anybody else to
choose the academic path he will take (Vol. I. p. 15)
seems like saying that the thicker the forest be
comes, the less need there is to require would-be
travellers to take a guide.
IV
Recommendations for achieving the aims of lib
eral education generally envisage imposed re
quirements covenng, in addition to courses in En
glish and in a foreign language, a required course or
courses in Western culture or the history of ideas
We are not concerned here with particular prog
rams, but with the sort of objections most commonly
raised against imposing such requirements.
1. It is often claimed that a required course in
Western culture or the history of ideas in the West is
chauvinistic, since it implies the superiority of the
Western tradition above other traditions The objec
tion is misconceived The purpose of studying the
Western tradition is not to celebrate it but to under
stand It — for good or ill. To evaluate Western
culture, or any other culture, without first making the
effort to understand it is to judge irrationally without
adequate evidence Many people make this very
mistake, but the fact that the mistake is common
affords a good reason for trying to correct it.
2. It is often claimed that requiring students to
study any particular subject is arbitrary because no
particular subject is intrinsically more important than
any other One might, so the argument goes, make
as good a case for general requirement in, say,
psychology or the scientific study of human be
havior The answer here is that all heirs of the West
ern tradition — whether specialists or generalists,
students or faculty, regardless of their special in
terests and capacities — are themselves con
ditioned by Western culture The same is true of all
the specialized disciplines which have developed in
the West they all reflect distinctively Western con
ceptions of rationality and the role of systematic
inquiry '' (Xir heritage affects our preconceptions
about the nature and function of scientific know
ledge as well as our preconceptions about values
and norms It is not too much to say that no person
can hope to understand who he or she is without
some understanding of the cultural context, handed
down from prior generations, in which he or she
presently exists Nobody lives, thinks, or talks in a
cultural void Nobody is exempt from cultural influ
ences Hence the peculiar importance of a general
requirement that students systematically examine
the cultural background which they all share
3 It is sometimes objected that a cultural re
quirement would put a premium on conformity to
accepted values We would suggest that the oppo
site is true The dangerous conformities are those
which are blind, unconscious, and uncritical Most
cultures breed rebels as well as conformists, as our

culture has. If a required course in Western culture
is designed (as above noted) to promote the accu
rate understanding of the Western orientation, the
result should be to make both rebels and confor
mists more dearly aware of what it is that they are
rejecting or accepting.
4. It has been objected that there is no reliable
evidence by which we can evaluate the effective
ness of general courses of the kind here envisaged;
hence they should not be required. We grant the
premise but reject the conclusion. The difficulty of
evaluation arises principally, we think, from the fact
that a good educational program has, or should
have, a long-term impact upon the student, and
such impacts are not precisely identifiable or quanti
fiable. To insist too much on precise evaluations
tends to put the emphasis on those short-term be
nefits and immediate satisfaction which can be as
certained, at the expense of the lasting benefits
which can be recognized, if at all, only in retrospect.
However this may be, the present objection cuts
both ways. If we cannot measure in advance the
precise effectiveness of a proposed requirement,
we cannot measure the relative effectiveness of a
program from which such requirements are omitted.
5. It has been claimed that students cannot be
made to learn what they do not wish to learn, or, as
last year s Council of ASSU Presidents put it, "You
can lead a student to a class but you can't make one
think." This position calls for clarification, because it
is highly ambiguous.
Much of what we learn from everyday experience
is not chosen, but forced upon us, often against our
wills, like learning that hot stoves can burn or that
careless driving invites serious accidents. With re
gard to required courses, the evidence is that many
generations of Stanford graduates found value in,
and claim to have profited from, the old course in
Western Civilization despite its having been pre
scribed. Many required courses in other colleges
and universities seem to have had substantial suc
cess. It is evident that the present objection is over
stated.
Perhaps we should interpret it to mean that stu
dents learn better when they study subjects which
they enjoy. There is some truth in this, but there is
also room for a serious confusion. One may enjoy
the process of studying a subject without liking or
approving the subject under study. A medical stu
dent, for example, does not normally enjoy or ap
prove of diseases A student of criminal behavior
does not normally enjoy or approve of crime. Such
students take satisfaction in learning how to cope
with the problems created by disease and crime. So
also a student of Western culture need not like or
approve of Western culture as such in order to find
satisfaction in making a study of it. If this distinction
is kept in mind, a further point emerges, namely, that
nobody can judge whether studying a given subject
will yield satisfaction or prove valuable to him until
after he has engaged in it. Students who view all
required courses as an infringement upon their
freedom of choice sometimes forget that freedom to
make informed choices is not the same as freedom
to make uninformed choices.
It used to be taken lor granted that if students
came to college, it was because they wished to be
made to think, this being accepted as an essential
part of a college education. The present argument,
however, introduces a distinction, as if students
were now saying: "Please give us an education, but
don't make us Slink — or at least, don't make us
think any more than we like or about topics we don't
like." Such a position, if taken seriously, would make
disciplined thinking peripheral rather than central to
the educational process, since disciplined thinking
is usually laborious and the habit of disciplined think
ing can only be acquired, like other skills, by sus
tained practice and fatiguing application.
Finally, it should be noted that when autonomy is
equated with negative freedom in Berlin's sense —
that is to say with freedom from restraints — and
when freedom from restraints is conceived as imply
ing freedom from any imposed norms or standards,
autonomy loses its value As Sartre showed in
Being and Nothingness, freedom without
guidelines is a burden; it is the freedom of the travel
ler lost in the jungle without a map, who can move in
any direction he wishes but has no basis for choos
ing one direction rather than another. From the
psychological point of view, this kind of freedom
results either in existential despair or in a kind of
narcissism which, valuing only sensations and ple
asures of the moment, and fearing the restraint of
any firm commitments, ends by trivalizing the very
pleasures it claims to prize. l 2 It also serves to de
stroy community with others; cooperation among
individuals is impossible where there are no com
monly accepted standards of acceptable and unac
ceptable behavior, because nobody can count on
what others will do. And even the ideal of universal
brotherhood is weakened if it is taken to imply free
dom from any concrete responsibilities to any par
ticular human beings 13
In a society where catchwords tend to replace
critical inquiry, words like freedom' and autonomy
take on a life of their own and acquire a special
emotional force, as if they represented absolute
goods. If autonomy is valuable, we easily assume
that the more autonomy we have the better off we
are, and that a condition of unlimited autonomy must
be best of all But such is not the case Individual
freedom and autonomy are vitally important as in
strumental goods, but to convert them into absolute
goods is to destroy their function.
V
In the foregoing section we have argued that re
quirements, far from being an evil, are, in fact,
necessary for the purposes of a liberal education
Here we may be more specific about requirements
at Stanford.
The Stanford undergraduate curriculum currentty
includes two requirements One is that of the Major,
based on the pnnciple of study in depth This re
quirement was re-examined and reaffirmed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (Campus
Report, 130ct. 1976, p.B). The other is the recently
redefined Distnbution Requirement wtiich aims to
provide the breadth of study necessary for a liberal
eAjcation to yield "a richer personal life through the
development of spaciousness of mind and spirit
The Distribution Requirements exist to ensure ex
posure to different ideas and different ways of think
ing They should enable (one) to understand better
the major ways of knowing,' to assess their
strengths and limitations, to appreciate their un
iqueness, and no less importantly to discern what
they have in common" (DRAT, p 21).
Under the present system, work in the three re
quired areas entails the study of certain works of
creative imagination in their cultural and histoncal
contexts, or of certain problems of philosophy and
belief (Humanities); the study of society, social in
stitutions. and human behavior (Social Saences);
and the study of natural phenomena, technology,
and math (NS/M/T) The stress in each area is upon
approaches, scholarly methods, and the general
human significance of the vanous kinds of study In
addition, for each area, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommends development of
groups of correlated courses; in Humanities the
courses chosen to fulfil the requirement must form a
group which can be certified" by the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (directly approved by the Dean
if the group is chosen by a student, indirectly, if set
up by a department)
The pnnaple of breadth is thus fulfilled by requir

ing a certain amount of study in the three areas into
which human knowledge has been conveniently di
vided. Vet, within each area, a different principle of
order is invoked, and a broad, comprehensive out
look is neither required nor encouraged Moreover,
no principles are stated for the organization of cor re
lated groups or "sequences" within the areas. Nor
has advice been given to departments on the ways
in which they should, in practice, "group" their own
courses or correlate them with courses in other de
partments
In addition, students have not been advised about
the designing of a Humanities program which might
be acceptable to the Doan. Much of the "freedom"
prescribed by SES was predicated on the assump
tion that undergraduate advising, especially for un
declared majors (freshman and sophomore years),
would be vigorous and that the "strongly recom
mended" alternatives and choices would be made
under vigilant academic guidance. Unfortunately,
the faculty, as advisors, cannot peiform the neces
sary academic surveillance given the laissoz fain)
philosophy of the present system.
This loosely structured program may have some
merit in that it recognizes the validity of both syn
chronic and diachronic methods of study, however,
it is impractical and unwittingly misleading. A stu
dent can easily justify the coherence of a group of
three courses, on say, the liteiature, art and society
of fifth-century Athens, or that of a group embracing
the three story-tellers Homer, Dorothy Richardson
and Dostoyevsky, or even that of any three courses
taught by an individual professor.
Are these two requirements — Major and Dis
tribution — an adequate foundation for a liberal
education? We feel that they are not. The student
certainly needs the intellectual methods proper to
the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences which the Distribution Requirement is
supposed to provide. But a good liberal education
has to be more comprehensive. It must include
some systematic study of the fundamental nature
and development of the culture and civilization
within which the student is living and to which he will
someday contribute. It must also provide basic in
formation about the complexities of modern society,
the means to analyse and evaluate that society, and
the perspective necessary to judge it on a compara
tive basis. In addition, the student should have some
knowledge of a culture remote from his own — a
culture outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition, suc h
as Greek or Asian — which will confront him with
ideas that challenge his unconscious assumptions
about his own time and place.
Many who agree in principle with such educa
tional ideals feel that they cannot be achieved. We
disagree. This is a university rich in teaching re
sources which has demonstrated on other occa
sions an ability to make sensible and worthwhile
educational innovations when they have been
needed. They are needed now. Departments and
individual instructors are well-equipped to deal with
the task at hand, and we should certainly draw on
our excellent teaching resources.
The Report of the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford has
suggested certain specific ways in which, through a
program of "tracks," undergraduate education
could achieve the strength and the focus it lacks at
the moment. The Report also mentions the desira
bility of historical and comparative studies whereby
modern Western culture can be confr onted not only
with past stages of its development, but also with
manifestations of other cultures. The program en
visioned by the Report is based partly on existing
courses covering the Western tradition. This prog
ram would allow the student to choose among four
approaches — literature and language; history; re
ligion and philosophy, or the creative and perform
ing arts — all leading to the same goal. This ap
proach would give to each student an educational
program more coherent than the present one.
The appropriate authorities — the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, the Doan of Undar
graduate Studies, the Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (where most under
graduate teaching takes place) — must now de
velop a plan for providing, either through new
courses or through the adaptation of existing
courses, a method for satisfying the educational
needs we have outlined. Those authorities should
also consider how that plan, when in operation,
could be monitored effectively T he responsibility
our University has to its undergraduates and the
obligation it has to its reputation demands that such
action be taken promptly.
Having outlined our views in this general stato
ment, we intend to publish in the next few months a
series of position papers suggesting concrete im
provements to undergraduate education at Stan
ford.

For approximately one year, a group o
humanities faculty members, gathering together tc
discuss issues of mutual concern, has debated the
merits of the present structure of the undergraduate
curriculum at Stanford. Events both local and na
tional have encouraged this sustained debate. The
group has had, moreover, the opportunity to hear, al
its informal sessions, the opinions of some of the
' officers of the University who could be expected to
play key roles in the elaboration of the under
graduate curnculum in future years. Among these
officers have been the President, the Dean ol
Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Under
gracfcjate Studies, and the Dean of Admissions.
What herewith follows is not necessarily a reflec
tion of the attitudes of any one of these officers, nor
of any one faculty member Rather, the group as a
whole would now like to offer to the campus com
munity a statement bearing on the design of that
curnculum. The group recognizes that it possesses
neither final wisdom nor institutional authority in
matters such as these; it also recognizes that exten
sive planning remains to be done before revisions in
the curriculum can be addopted
The group speaks, however, with a sense ol
urgency. It is satisfied neither with the quality of the
intellectual life, nor with the goals and standards of
the undergraduate program. It believes, moreover,
that dissatisfaction, at times expressed and at other
times muted, is a sentiment shared by many faculty
members at Stanford. Nor is such a condition
merely local. Discussion within the group has been
enlivened in the past year by the clear recognition
that the problems Stanford now faces (and must
rigorously attempt to resolve) are problems affect
ing every prestigious institution of higher learning.
That the problems are national in their dimensions is
indicated by, among other things, the special
1974-75 issues of Daedalus (Journal of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences) wherein
eighty-four distinguished educators, including sev
eral from Stanford, speak to the conditions now
defining academic life. Differences among these
educators are certainly present, but all are
frightened, as the editor says, "by what they see as
a lack of concern for intellectual values, others worry
about what they think to be a reduced social con
sciousness." The perspective in which this deep
concern, on both the national level and the local
level, takes place is more serious, of course, than
the question of which course or courses must be
required of the undergraduate. It is more serious
than any particular detail. But details and particulars
will, at the appropriate moment, play their crucial
part when revisions in the curriculum are proposed
and then established. The editor of Daedalus de
scribes the newly emergent situation not as "a re
petition of the discussion that occurred in the middle
of the nineteenth century when a rigid, classically
oriented college curriculum was challenged by the
new theoretical and applied sciences. Much more is
at stake today; the continued viability of the concept
of the liberally-educated person is involved."
About the continued viability the Stanford com
munity has the deepest obligation to be concerned.
In the immediate past, that concern has been ex
pressed by the Report of the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stan
ford. The spirit of that Report, in which a clear com
mitment to a requirement in Western Culture is af
firmed, must be sustained and nourished. Hence
the informal Humanities and Sciences group is
happy to note that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has recently, and unanimously, also en
dorsed "the principle that studies in Western Culture
should be part of each student's education."
Discussions within the group have also been in
vigorated by the understanding that the problems
Stanford now faces are not purely national but are
Stanford's own This university must fulfill the spe
cial obligations it has as a private institution, of great
prestige, within a state and a geography dominated
by non-private institutions Its mission has been,
and is, special; so can be the quality of its under
graduate education. To this obligation President
Richard W. Lyman has often spoken, and most tel
lingly speaks in the pages of Daedalus, where he
says
We who are responsible for the continuing
health of our "little platoons" — and even
the greatest of the private universities are
"little platoons" when matched against the
dimensions of state-supported higher edu
cation — we have our work cut out for us...
one virture that ought to be within the reach
of independent institutions, be they old or
new, famous or obscure, is that of rigorous
self-definition.
It is to that rigor arte 1 that self-definition that Stan
ford's attention must now turn Prompted, then, by
both the national anxiety and concern, and opposed
to the idle, helpless notion that little can be done in
the face of curricular and intellectual complexity, this
statement is offered to the Stanford community It is
hoped that it will play some effective part in discus
sions within the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
and the Academic Senate.
The pnnciples underlying the 1968 Study of Edu
cation at Stanford are treated here first. That Study
predates the Report of the Committee on the Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
and by virtue of the seriousness and thoughtfulness
with which it was undertaken, has achieved a con
siderable weight in later discussions of curricular
reform But as the Study itself observes, its spirit
was one of "self-examination and self-renewal." It
further observes that "the study of education must
become a process rather than event." Eight years
have since passed: changes now seem wholly
proper and necessary In the light, then, of such
changes to be made, a second matter for discussion
follows the first It is a consideration of the newly
formulated system of distnbution requirements. Al
though that system is the product of much labor on
the part of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, it does not coherently and directly address
the fundamental inadequacies of the present cur
ncular program for the undergraduate student, it is a
system that is too diffuse and too loosely monitored
to be able to do so Only by a program that is more
coherently structured can the mtellecuual life of the
Stanford student be made more challenging, in
tense, and rewarding
II
The basic philosophy of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). published in 1968-69, was that of
educational laissez fairs This is reflected in two
parallel pronouncements, the first of which ap
peared in the general introductory section of the
report and the second in the section on under
graduate education
"Let fie objectrve of curncular planning be
to encourage the faculty member to teach
what he likes to teach and the student to
learn what seems vital to him — the Intellec
tual History of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century rather than the History of Western
Civilization Modern Consciousness rather
than Freshman English. Organizational Be
havior rather than Introduction to Sociology
— and from this common freedom may
emerge a form of general education far bet
ter suited to the cftaractennbcs of a umver
slty than that to which we pay lip service

now." (Vol. I, p. 14)
And again:
"The objective toward which curriculum
planning should strive is, to the extent pos
sible, to let the teacher teach what he wants
to teach and the student learn what he
wants to learn." (Vol. II, p. 12)
Now philosophies of laissez faire can be arrived at
in different ways and supported or defended on
different grounds. Having in mind Isaiah Berlin's
significant distinction between positive and negative
conceptions of freedom — possitive freedom being
freedom for the achievement of some end deemed
desirable, negative freedom being freedom from
restraint on the assumption that restraint is wrong in
itself 1 — we can roughly distinguish between posi
tive and negative philosophies of laissez faire.
Adam Smith's views concerning economic be
havior were positive in this sense, not because they
were necessarily correct, but because they were
based on extensive inquiries into the nature of
wealth, the nature of human motivation and be
havior, and a clear belief in the desirability of the
conditions to which he thought a free market
economy would contribute. One may, of course,
quarrel with his views, but the fact remains that he
had a carefully worked out theory of social welfare
and advocated free enterprise as the best means of
achieving it. It is not inconceivable that a positive
doctrine of educational laissez faire might be simi
larly grounded on some carefully worked out and
coherent theory of the objectives, functions, and
social impact of higher education. But SES failed to
provide any such theory Instead it provided a nega
tive philosophy of laissez faire based on the view
that in higher education, restraints of any kind are
inherently bad. Moreover, this view was itself based
on a curiously narrow and dubious line of argument
which calls for special attention and comment.
The SES committee took the position that it ought
to base its "proposed reponses to the problems of
education at Stanford on careful consideration of
the meaning of education for individual teacher and
student and of the nature of the university" (Vol. I, p.
8). So far, so good. But it then proceeded to deal
with these questions, not by considering the general
objectives, functions and possible impact of higher
education in and on today's society, nor by consider
ing the important "new dimensions" which it had
cited in the opening sentence of its report as having
been introduced by the student unrest of the 1960's.
Instead, the Committee attempted to deal with all
these questions by the simple expedient of examin
ing the etymology of the single world, education '
The Committee established its "basic premises" i

as follows:
To establish our basic premises we must
begin with our conceptions of education and
of a university. The world 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educere meaning to
lead forth.' To lead does not mean to com
pel, or to push, or to pull. It means quite
simply what it says.. (1,10)
On this foundation it was immediately concluded
(among other things) that education "can never be
compelled nor can knowledge be impressed on a
mind unwilling to learn if it is to be more than indoc
trination'' (I, 10). It was also inferred (without any
corresponding concern for the etymology of the
word "university") that "the University can nevei
educate in the true sense of the word, but it can
supply the environment and the means necessary
to insure that those who came here may educate
each other and themselves'' (I, 10). In short, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, the weight of the
whole report seems to have rested upon the pre
sumed etymology of the word educate.'
The deficiences of this approach are obvious:
1 Words change their meanings. Hence even i
this particular etymology were adequately stated, i
could give no more than a tentative and partial hin
as to the present meaning of the word "education."
2. Given a complex enterprise like that of moderr
education, many different words are involved. If we
are to rely on etymology, we ought surely to con
sider also the etymologies of a variety of other En
glish words which are relevant to education, such as
learning, training, study, scholarship, instruction,
teaching, tutoring, lecturing, research, etc. These
would yield different results, reflecting the simple
fact that education has many facets, and dimen
sions, which cannot be captured by looking at any
simplified etymology of any single word.
3. On the Latin side, we should note first that in
addition to the verb educere (3rd conjugation) on
which the SES committee chose to rely, there was
another related Latin verb, educare (Ist conjuga
tion) meaning 'to train, to rear, to bring up ' It is from
the latter (and its nouneducatfo) that our word edu
cation' is most immediately derived. Secondly, the
Romans had several other verbs which they applied
to the process of education, including instituere,
instruere, and erudire. None of these suggests to
lead forth ; the first two suggested the idea of estab
lishing,' constructing' or setting in order, while the
last implied making smooth.'
Thus the committee's central line of argument —
the first among its "basic premises" — must be
rejected as wholly misconceived This fact does not,
of course, necessarily refute the laissez faire
philosophy which the committee derived from it; as
previously observed, that philosophy might con
ceivably be supported on other grounds. However,
since no other basis was supplied, the committee's
general conclusion stands unsupported. We are left
with, at best, a negative theory of laissez faire — a
theory which might as well have been adopted out of
sheer inertia or even from an impulse to deflate
student po'itical demands by making educational
concessions 2 On this view, educational restraints
are wrong primarily because they are burdensome
and because they are disliked. Eliminating require
ments is good because freedom is good, in and of
itself If teachers are free to teach what they want to
teach and students are free to learn what they want
to leam, we may trust that everybody will benefit and
that the proper interests of society will be served
111
The question now is whether that trust has been
vindicated or discredited The indications are
mounting that it has been discredited — that the kind
of educational laissez faire recommended by the
SES report has already been found seriously defi
cient Several emerging difficulties call for particular
attention.
1 The problem of standards
Derek Bok, President of Harvard University (and
a Stanford alumnus) began a recent article "On the
Purposes of Undergraduate Education' (Daedalus.
Fall, 1974, pp 159-172) as follows
"Scholars who study the behavior of
human organizations constantly stress the
importance of defining institutional goals
Without dear objectives, it is said, an mstitu
tion cannot evaluate how well it is perform
ing, decide how to allocate its resources
wisely, plan for future growth, motivate its
members, or justify its existence to the
larger public
"Despite these admonitions, our colleges
seem to exist without making much of an
effort to define their aims In the thick reports
on undergraduate education that many col
leges have produced in recent years, there
is little discuMion of what it is that a liberal
arts education should provide for me stu-

dent. The prevailing sentiment is captured
by the statement of a curriculum committee
in one of our most distinguished univer
sities: The objective toward which cur
riculum planning should strive is, to the ex
tent possible, to let the teacher teach what
he wants to teach and the student learn
t what he wants to learn.' "
It should be noted lhat the concluding sentence,
cited as exemplifying a prevalent defiaency, is bor
rowed from the SES report; it is the second of the
two excerpts quoted at the beginning of this paper
Bok's point is that the SES philosophy of laissez
faire provides no standards for directing or evaluat
ing any aspect of the academic enterprise, or judg
ing academic performance. If the controlling objec
tive is to allow teachers and students to do whatever
they prefer, why should the university not provide
instruction in basketweaving? If it be replied that
accepted standards of academic excellence and
competence are assumed, the question arises
where such standards originate and how they are
maintained. To the extent that they are needed, the
laissez faire philosophy is thereby shown to be in
adequate
It is one thing to maintain that teachers should
enjoy teaching and that students should enjoy learn
ing, but it is something else to say that immediate
enjoyment — which can vary according to the fash
ions of the day — is to be taken as the primary
measure of academic success. It is perhaps worth
remarking that while the SES report relied on Alfred
North Whitehead's observation that the University's
justification is to preserve "the connection between
knowledge and the zest of life, by uniting the young
and the old in the imaginative consideration of learn
ing" (SES, I, 10) it failed to note that in the same
essay (as well as elsewhere in his writings on edu
cation) Whitehead stressed the need for a "discip
line of imagination" so that the superior vigor of the
young should be tempered by the superior experi
ence of the elders. The persistent problem of educa
tion, in Whitehead's view, is to combine discipline
and imagination so that neither destroys the other.
In his words, "qualities essential at a later stage of a
career are apt to be stamped out in an earlier stage
This is only an instance of the more general fact, that
technical excellence can only be acquired by a train
ing which is apt to damage those energies of mind
which should direct the technical skill. This is the key
fact in education, and the reason for most of its
difficulties." 3
2. Problems of specialization and vocationalism
The Harvard report of 1945, General Education in
a Free Society, probably the most widely influential t
report on higher issued in the decadea
immediate following World War II, devoted most of
its attention to a discussion of the purposes and
functions of education in a free society, "It is fruit
less," the Harvard committee wrote, "to think about
any such practical step as a curriculum without hav
ing in mind specifications or points of reference, in
this case the ends toward which the curriculum
should look and the students for whom it is in
tended." 4
The main problems of education were there attri
buted to three sources: first, the progressive expan
sion of knowledge with the attendant multiplication
of specialisms and sub-specialisms in all areas;
second, the great increase in the number of college
students as opportunities for education beyond the
high-school were extended from the privileged few
and made available to young people at large; and
third, to the increasing complexity of modern society
itself. To cope with these problems, the Harvard
committee felt that education at the college level
ought to perform a dual role. It must, on the one
hand, fully recognize the need for increasing
specialization and provide a foundation for students
going on to careers or vocations requiring particular
skills in diverse areas. But it must at the same time
seek to balance the fragmentation and atomization
threatened by the multiplication of specialties by
finding some unifying dimension or dimensions. It
was concluded that the latter function required re
newed stress on the sort of education that had been
traditionally called "liberal education," specifically
the kind of education designed to develop the
natural capacities of the student as a human being
regardless of the particular social role which he or
she might subsequently fill. "Our conclusion, then,"
wrote the Harvard committee in 1945," is that the
aim of education should be to prepare an individual
to become an expert both in some particular voca
tion or art and in the general art of the free man and
the citizen. Thus the two kinds of education once
given separately to different social classes must be
given to all alike." 5
These views are cited not to suggest that the
curricular innovations recommended by the Har
vard committee in 1945 accomplished their purpose
(which is open to serious debate) but to show that
the committee identified — and tried to meet —
three problems which became more and more pres
sing in the ensuing years Among these, the con
tinued multiplication of specialisms with spreading
emphasis on the importance to the student of de
veloping marketable skills, at a high level of sophis
tication, has proved perhaps the most intractable
One way to deal with this problem is, of course, to do
nothing — to drift with the prevailing current rather
than attempt to swim against it. The SES report, with
its philosophy of laissez faire, does exactly that
Since increasing specialism is the order of the day.
and since competent scholars are specialists, it can
be claimed, "realism" dictates that we accept that
fact, adapting our education to it and letting
threatened dangers take care of themselves But
some of those threatened dangers have already
become actual.

(i) As the opinion spreads that the main function of
higher education is to develop in the student mar
ketable skills — what Steven Miller, President of
Johns Hopkins, calls "higher skilling" as opposed to
higher education 8 — for a job market which is al
ready oversaturated, the value of a college educa
tion is necessanly depreciated. If it were recog
nized, however, that the chief function of a college
education is to develop the human potential of the
student without regard to the particular job he or she
might eventually hold or the particular social role he
or she might occupy, the result would be otherwise
Success or failure in the job market would not be
considered so crucial There is here an illustration of
the point made before, that the objectives (or sup
posed objectives) of education always provide the
criteria for evaluating success or failure
(ii) In regard to the nature and status if knowledge,
Steven Muller, in the article just mentioned, asked
the pregnant question If all our scholars are stand
ing at the frontiers of knowledge, who is standing at
the center? Is there today any center? If not, how
can there be any community of scholars in the tradi
tional sense?
Under present conditions, there is no genuine
community of teachers or students in any college or
university, but rather an aggregate of specialists
and students, each pursuing his or her own sepa
rate interests in geographical proximity, with little or
no basis for cross-disciplinary communication or
understanding One consequence is that most scho
lars feel more affinity with, and more respect for,
their professional colleagues in other universities
than for members of other departments in their own
And there is no longer any unity of knowledge, but
only a collocation of separate knowledges Such a
situation may. perhaps, be defended certainly it is
preferable to an ideological uniformity arbitrarily im
posed But surety there is a middle ground between

these extremes. Muller considers that some return
to general education, with universal requirements
for English, for a second language, for cultural his
tory, and for science, is necessary to restore the
un 'ty of genuine education.
What all our scholars in different disciplines have
in common is that they are all human beings, that
they all share the same cultural inheritance, and that
they are all engaged (or should be) in the same
quest — the quest for greater knowledge and wider
understanding. And we do well, we believe, to recall
the observation of Arthur Lovejoy that he who knows
only his own special field may not know what is most
worth looking lor in his special field. 7
#ii) An extensive investigation recently conducted
byktwo ecfcjcation reporters of the Los Angeles
Tunes into the concurrent phenomena of progres
sive grade inflation along with progressive decline in
the average level of students' proficiency has been
the widespread substitution of new elective
oourses, sometimes lacking in academic rigor, for
the kind of basic courses which used to be required
for all students. 8 Though the demonstration is not
conclusive, it is at least persuasively documented
As against suggestions that the decline in test
scores is due to other causes — such as altered
family structures, the increased number of less qual
ified students, regional factors, or the unreliability of
test scores — the authors of the report point out that
the two areas where test scores have not declined
but held steady or advanced are the areas in which
basic requirements have been largely retained, i.e.,
in the first three primary grades in school and in the
sciences at post-secondary level. These investiga
tions, which are too long to summanze, are worth
senous attention. At least, they cannot be ignored,
despite the attempts of some educators to dismiss
or discount them.
(iv) There is clear evidence that college students
today resent the increasingly competitive atmos
phere of post-secondary education. 9 It seems to be
a fair inference that the competitive aspect reflects
the increasing emphasis in higher education upon
the development of marketable skills. When stu
dents are competing for entrance to professional
schools or for jobs requiring technical proficiency,
and when good grades are seen as important for
Stich purposes, the process of college education
naturally comes to be seen as a struggle of each
against all; for admission to a limited number of
'ftllure positions. But liberal education, in the tradi
tional sense, has a different character. The
philosopher Spinoza pointed out that intellectual
goods sought for their own sake are non-
C9mpetitive. If one person achieves wisdom or in
creased insight, he is not threatened but reinforced
if his neighbors do likewise. Here is one major dif
ference between virtues of character and technical
skills, at least where the latter determine job oppor
tunities. Nothing is so useful or agreeable to the
virtuous man, Spinoza wrote, as the company of
others who are like-minded. Where self-realization
or self-improvement is the aim rather than voca
tional proficiency — as is the case with liberal edu
cation — emulation can be a spur without being a
threat. And the community of scholars, for teachers
and students alike, rests upon such a foundation
Thef search for "higher skilling" is centrifugal; the
search for liberal education is centripetal. A student
whose aim is self-development or self-improvement
as a human being values grades only as indications
of his own progress, not for any advantage they may
give over others.

(v) As our society becomes increasingly complex,
as specialisms multiply, and as it becomes increas
ingly apparent that the most serious problems ex
tend over many diciplines, it follows, as Professor
Gabriel Almond has observed, that "only higher
order philosophical syntheses can spell out the big
issues and formulate alternative solutions." 10 At the
same time, our society is becoming more and more
susceptible at all levels to the pull of simplistic slo
gans, catchwords, images, stereotypes and
counter-stereotypes. In this situation the need for
critical intelligence and balanced judgment is be
coming more and more acute, yet this need is not
likely to be apparent to the beginning student, par
ticularly if he is bent on acquiring some particular
skill. The SES report quoted approvingly an obser
vation of Professor Edwin M. Good to the effect that
the important simplicities are those which lie "on the
other side of complexity" (Vol. I, p. 11). Surely the
proper inference is that today's student, seeking tp
pick his way through the growing thicket of com
plexities towards some thoughtful and balanced
overview — as opposed to the delusive simplicities
offered by catchwords and fashionable stereotypes
— needs more guidance and direction than ever
before. The claim of the SES committee that today's
student is in a better position than anybody else to
choose the academic path he will take (Vol. I. p. 15)
seems like saying that the thicker the forest be
comes, the less need there is to require would-be
travellers to take a guide.
IV
Recommendations for achieving the aims of lib
eral education generally envisage imposed re
quirements covenng, in addition to courses in En
glish and in a foreign language, a required course or
courses in Western culture or the history of ideas
We are not concerned here with particular prog
rams, but with the sort of objections most commonly
raised against imposing such requirements.
1. It is often claimed that a required course in
Western culture or the history of ideas in the West is
chauvinistic, since it implies the superiority of the
Western tradition above other traditions The objec
tion is misconceived The purpose of studying the
Western tradition is not to celebrate it but to under
stand It — for good or ill. To evaluate Western
culture, or any other culture, without first making the
effort to understand it is to judge irrationally without
adequate evidence Many people make this very
mistake, but the fact that the mistake is common
affords a good reason for trying to correct it.
2. It is often claimed that requiring students to
study any particular subject is arbitrary because no
particular subject is intrinsically more important than
any other One might, so the argument goes, make
as good a case for general requirement in, say,
psychology or the scientific study of human be
havior The answer here is that all heirs of the West
ern tradition — whether specialists or generalists,
students or faculty, regardless of their special in
terests and capacities — are themselves con
ditioned by Western culture The same is true of all
the specialized disciplines which have developed in
the West they all reflect distinctively Western con
ceptions of rationality and the role of systematic
inquiry '' (Xir heritage affects our preconceptions
about the nature and function of scientific know
ledge as well as our preconceptions about values
and norms It is not too much to say that no person
can hope to understand who he or she is without
some understanding of the cultural context, handed
down from prior generations, in which he or she
presently exists Nobody lives, thinks, or talks in a
cultural void Nobody is exempt from cultural influ
ences Hence the peculiar importance of a general
requirement that students systematically examine
the cultural background which they all share
3 It is sometimes objected that a cultural re
quirement would put a premium on conformity to
accepted values We would suggest that the oppo
site is true The dangerous conformities are those
which are blind, unconscious, and uncritical Most
cultures breed rebels as well as conformists, as our

culture has. If a required course in Western culture
is designed (as above noted) to promote the accu
rate understanding of the Western orientation, the
result should be to make both rebels and confor
mists more dearly aware of what it is that they are
rejecting or accepting.
4. It has been objected that there is no reliable
evidence by which we can evaluate the effective
ness of general courses of the kind here envisaged;
hence they should not be required. We grant the
premise but reject the conclusion. The difficulty of
evaluation arises principally, we think, from the fact
that a good educational program has, or should
have, a long-term impact upon the student, and
such impacts are not precisely identifiable or quanti
fiable. To insist too much on precise evaluations
tends to put the emphasis on those short-term be
nefits and immediate satisfaction which can be as
certained, at the expense of the lasting benefits
which can be recognized, if at all, only in retrospect.
However this may be, the present objection cuts
both ways. If we cannot measure in advance the
precise effectiveness of a proposed requirement,
we cannot measure the relative effectiveness of a
program from which such requirements are omitted.
5. It has been claimed that students cannot be
made to learn what they do not wish to learn, or, as
last year s Council of ASSU Presidents put it, "You
can lead a student to a class but you can't make one
think." This position calls for clarification, because it
is highly ambiguous.
Much of what we learn from everyday experience
is not chosen, but forced upon us, often against our
wills, like learning that hot stoves can burn or that
careless driving invites serious accidents. With re
gard to required courses, the evidence is that many
generations of Stanford graduates found value in,
and claim to have profited from, the old course in
Western Civilization despite its having been pre
scribed. Many required courses in other colleges
and universities seem to have had substantial suc
cess. It is evident that the present objection is over
stated.
Perhaps we should interpret it to mean that stu
dents learn better when they study subjects which
they enjoy. There is some truth in this, but there is
also room for a serious confusion. One may enjoy
the process of studying a subject without liking or
approving the subject under study. A medical stu
dent, for example, does not normally enjoy or ap
prove of diseases A student of criminal behavior
does not normally enjoy or approve of crime. Such
students take satisfaction in learning how to cope
with the problems created by disease and crime. So
also a student of Western culture need not like or
approve of Western culture as such in order to find
satisfaction in making a study of it. If this distinction
is kept in mind, a further point emerges, namely, that
nobody can judge whether studying a given subject
will yield satisfaction or prove valuable to him until
after he has engaged in it. Students who view all
required courses as an infringement upon their
freedom of choice sometimes forget that freedom to
make informed choices is not the same as freedom
to make uninformed choices.
It used to be taken lor granted that if students
came to college, it was because they wished to be
made to think, this being accepted as an essential
part of a college education. The present argument,
however, introduces a distinction, as if students
were now saying: "Please give us an education, but
don't make us Slink — or at least, don't make us
think any more than we like or about topics we don't
like." Such a position, if taken seriously, would make
disciplined thinking peripheral rather than central to
the educational process, since disciplined thinking
is usually laborious and the habit of disciplined think
ing can only be acquired, like other skills, by sus
tained practice and fatiguing application.
Finally, it should be noted that when autonomy is
equated with negative freedom in Berlin's sense —
that is to say with freedom from restraints — and
when freedom from restraints is conceived as imply
ing freedom from any imposed norms or standards,
autonomy loses its value As Sartre showed in
Being and Nothingness, freedom without
guidelines is a burden; it is the freedom of the travel
ler lost in the jungle without a map, who can move in
any direction he wishes but has no basis for choos
ing one direction rather than another. From the
psychological point of view, this kind of freedom
results either in existential despair or in a kind of
narcissism which, valuing only sensations and ple
asures of the moment, and fearing the restraint of
any firm commitments, ends by trivalizing the very
pleasures it claims to prize. l 2 It also serves to de
stroy community with others; cooperation among
individuals is impossible where there are no com
monly accepted standards of acceptable and unac
ceptable behavior, because nobody can count on
what others will do. And even the ideal of universal
brotherhood is weakened if it is taken to imply free
dom from any concrete responsibilities to any par
ticular human beings 13
In a society where catchwords tend to replace
critical inquiry, words like freedom' and autonomy
take on a life of their own and acquire a special
emotional force, as if they represented absolute
goods. If autonomy is valuable, we easily assume
that the more autonomy we have the better off we
are, and that a condition of unlimited autonomy must
be best of all But such is not the case Individual
freedom and autonomy are vitally important as in
strumental goods, but to convert them into absolute
goods is to destroy their function.
V
In the foregoing section we have argued that re
quirements, far from being an evil, are, in fact,
necessary for the purposes of a liberal education
Here we may be more specific about requirements
at Stanford.
The Stanford undergraduate curriculum currentty
includes two requirements One is that of the Major,
based on the pnnciple of study in depth This re
quirement was re-examined and reaffirmed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (Campus
Report, 130ct. 1976, p.B). The other is the recently
redefined Distnbution Requirement wtiich aims to
provide the breadth of study necessary for a liberal
eAjcation to yield "a richer personal life through the
development of spaciousness of mind and spirit
The Distribution Requirements exist to ensure ex
posure to different ideas and different ways of think
ing They should enable (one) to understand better
the major ways of knowing,' to assess their
strengths and limitations, to appreciate their un
iqueness, and no less importantly to discern what
they have in common" (DRAT, p 21).
Under the present system, work in the three re
quired areas entails the study of certain works of
creative imagination in their cultural and histoncal
contexts, or of certain problems of philosophy and
belief (Humanities); the study of society, social in
stitutions. and human behavior (Social Saences);
and the study of natural phenomena, technology,
and math (NS/M/T) The stress in each area is upon
approaches, scholarly methods, and the general
human significance of the vanous kinds of study In
addition, for each area, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommends development of
groups of correlated courses; in Humanities the
courses chosen to fulfil the requirement must form a
group which can be certified" by the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (directly approved by the Dean
if the group is chosen by a student, indirectly, if set
up by a department)
The pnnaple of breadth is thus fulfilled by requir

ing a certain amount of study in the three areas into
which human knowledge has been conveniently di
vided. Vet, within each area, a different principle of
order is invoked, and a broad, comprehensive out
look is neither required nor encouraged Moreover,
no principles are stated for the organization of cor re
lated groups or "sequences" within the areas. Nor
has advice been given to departments on the ways
in which they should, in practice, "group" their own
courses or correlate them with courses in other de
partments
In addition, students have not been advised about
the designing of a Humanities program which might
be acceptable to the Doan. Much of the "freedom"
prescribed by SES was predicated on the assump
tion that undergraduate advising, especially for un
declared majors (freshman and sophomore years),
would be vigorous and that the "strongly recom
mended" alternatives and choices would be made
under vigilant academic guidance. Unfortunately,
the faculty, as advisors, cannot peiform the neces
sary academic surveillance given the laissoz fain)
philosophy of the present system.
This loosely structured program may have some
merit in that it recognizes the validity of both syn
chronic and diachronic methods of study, however,
it is impractical and unwittingly misleading. A stu
dent can easily justify the coherence of a group of
three courses, on say, the liteiature, art and society
of fifth-century Athens, or that of a group embracing
the three story-tellers Homer, Dorothy Richardson
and Dostoyevsky, or even that of any three courses
taught by an individual professor.
Are these two requirements — Major and Dis
tribution — an adequate foundation for a liberal
education? We feel that they are not. The student
certainly needs the intellectual methods proper to
the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences which the Distribution Requirement is
supposed to provide. But a good liberal education
has to be more comprehensive. It must include
some systematic study of the fundamental nature
and development of the culture and civilization
within which the student is living and to which he will
someday contribute. It must also provide basic in
formation about the complexities of modern society,
the means to analyse and evaluate that society, and
the perspective necessary to judge it on a compara
tive basis. In addition, the student should have some
knowledge of a culture remote from his own — a
culture outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition, suc h
as Greek or Asian — which will confront him with
ideas that challenge his unconscious assumptions
about his own time and place.
Many who agree in principle with such educa
tional ideals feel that they cannot be achieved. We
disagree. This is a university rich in teaching re
sources which has demonstrated on other occa
sions an ability to make sensible and worthwhile
educational innovations when they have been
needed. They are needed now. Departments and
individual instructors are well-equipped to deal with
the task at hand, and we should certainly draw on
our excellent teaching resources.
The Report of the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford has
suggested certain specific ways in which, through a
program of "tracks," undergraduate education
could achieve the strength and the focus it lacks at
the moment. The Report also mentions the desira
bility of historical and comparative studies whereby
modern Western culture can be confr onted not only
with past stages of its development, but also with
manifestations of other cultures. The program en
visioned by the Report is based partly on existing
courses covering the Western tradition. This prog
ram would allow the student to choose among four
approaches — literature and language; history; re
ligion and philosophy, or the creative and perform
ing arts — all leading to the same goal. This ap
proach would give to each student an educational
program more coherent than the present one.
The appropriate authorities — the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, the Doan of Undar
graduate Studies, the Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (where most under
graduate teaching takes place) — must now de
velop a plan for providing, either through new
courses or through the adaptation of existing
courses, a method for satisfying the educational
needs we have outlined. Those authorities should
also consider how that plan, when in operation,
could be monitored effectively T he responsibility
our University has to its undergraduates and the
obligation it has to its reputation demands that such
action be taken promptly.
Having outlined our views in this general stato
ment, we intend to publish in the next few months a
series of position papers suggesting concrete im
provements to undergraduate education at Stan
ford.

For approximately one year, a group o
humanities faculty members, gathering together tc
discuss issues of mutual concern, has debated the
merits of the present structure of the undergraduate
curriculum at Stanford. Events both local and na
tional have encouraged this sustained debate. The
group has had, moreover, the opportunity to hear, al
its informal sessions, the opinions of some of the
' officers of the University who could be expected to
play key roles in the elaboration of the under
graduate curnculum in future years. Among these
officers have been the President, the Dean ol
Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Under
gracfcjate Studies, and the Dean of Admissions.
What herewith follows is not necessarily a reflec
tion of the attitudes of any one of these officers, nor
of any one faculty member Rather, the group as a
whole would now like to offer to the campus com
munity a statement bearing on the design of that
curnculum. The group recognizes that it possesses
neither final wisdom nor institutional authority in
matters such as these; it also recognizes that exten
sive planning remains to be done before revisions in
the curriculum can be addopted
The group speaks, however, with a sense ol
urgency. It is satisfied neither with the quality of the
intellectual life, nor with the goals and standards of
the undergraduate program. It believes, moreover,
that dissatisfaction, at times expressed and at other
times muted, is a sentiment shared by many faculty
members at Stanford. Nor is such a condition
merely local. Discussion within the group has been
enlivened in the past year by the clear recognition
that the problems Stanford now faces (and must
rigorously attempt to resolve) are problems affect
ing every prestigious institution of higher learning.
That the problems are national in their dimensions is
indicated by, among other things, the special
1974-75 issues of Daedalus (Journal of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences) wherein
eighty-four distinguished educators, including sev
eral from Stanford, speak to the conditions now
defining academic life. Differences among these
educators are certainly present, but all are
frightened, as the editor says, "by what they see as
a lack of concern for intellectual values, others worry
about what they think to be a reduced social con
sciousness." The perspective in which this deep
concern, on both the national level and the local
level, takes place is more serious, of course, than
the question of which course or courses must be
required of the undergraduate. It is more serious
than any particular detail. But details and particulars
will, at the appropriate moment, play their crucial
part when revisions in the curriculum are proposed
and then established. The editor of Daedalus de
scribes the newly emergent situation not as "a re
petition of the discussion that occurred in the middle
of the nineteenth century when a rigid, classically
oriented college curriculum was challenged by the
new theoretical and applied sciences. Much more is
at stake today; the continued viability of the concept
of the liberally-educated person is involved."
About the continued viability the Stanford com
munity has the deepest obligation to be concerned.
In the immediate past, that concern has been ex
pressed by the Report of the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stan
ford. The spirit of that Report, in which a clear com
mitment to a requirement in Western Culture is af
firmed, must be sustained and nourished. Hence
the informal Humanities and Sciences group is
happy to note that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has recently, and unanimously, also en
dorsed "the principle that studies in Western Culture
should be part of each student's education."
Discussions within the group have also been in
vigorated by the understanding that the problems
Stanford now faces are not purely national but are
Stanford's own This university must fulfill the spe
cial obligations it has as a private institution, of great
prestige, within a state and a geography dominated
by non-private institutions Its mission has been,
and is, special; so can be the quality of its under
graduate education. To this obligation President
Richard W. Lyman has often spoken, and most tel
lingly speaks in the pages of Daedalus, where he
says
We who are responsible for the continuing
health of our "little platoons" — and even
the greatest of the private universities are
"little platoons" when matched against the
dimensions of state-supported higher edu
cation — we have our work cut out for us...
one virture that ought to be within the reach
of independent institutions, be they old or
new, famous or obscure, is that of rigorous
self-definition.
It is to that rigor arte 1 that self-definition that Stan
ford's attention must now turn Prompted, then, by
both the national anxiety and concern, and opposed
to the idle, helpless notion that little can be done in
the face of curricular and intellectual complexity, this
statement is offered to the Stanford community It is
hoped that it will play some effective part in discus
sions within the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
and the Academic Senate.
The pnnciples underlying the 1968 Study of Edu
cation at Stanford are treated here first. That Study
predates the Report of the Committee on the Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
and by virtue of the seriousness and thoughtfulness
with which it was undertaken, has achieved a con
siderable weight in later discussions of curricular
reform But as the Study itself observes, its spirit
was one of "self-examination and self-renewal." It
further observes that "the study of education must
become a process rather than event." Eight years
have since passed: changes now seem wholly
proper and necessary In the light, then, of such
changes to be made, a second matter for discussion
follows the first It is a consideration of the newly
formulated system of distnbution requirements. Al
though that system is the product of much labor on
the part of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, it does not coherently and directly address
the fundamental inadequacies of the present cur
ncular program for the undergraduate student, it is a
system that is too diffuse and too loosely monitored
to be able to do so Only by a program that is more
coherently structured can the mtellecuual life of the
Stanford student be made more challenging, in
tense, and rewarding
II
The basic philosophy of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). published in 1968-69, was that of
educational laissez fairs This is reflected in two
parallel pronouncements, the first of which ap
peared in the general introductory section of the
report and the second in the section on under
graduate education
"Let fie objectrve of curncular planning be
to encourage the faculty member to teach
what he likes to teach and the student to
learn what seems vital to him — the Intellec
tual History of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century rather than the History of Western
Civilization Modern Consciousness rather
than Freshman English. Organizational Be
havior rather than Introduction to Sociology
— and from this common freedom may
emerge a form of general education far bet
ter suited to the cftaractennbcs of a umver
slty than that to which we pay lip service

now." (Vol. I, p. 14)
And again:
"The objective toward which curriculum
planning should strive is, to the extent pos
sible, to let the teacher teach what he wants
to teach and the student learn what he
wants to learn." (Vol. II, p. 12)
Now philosophies of laissez faire can be arrived at
in different ways and supported or defended on
different grounds. Having in mind Isaiah Berlin's
significant distinction between positive and negative
conceptions of freedom — possitive freedom being
freedom for the achievement of some end deemed
desirable, negative freedom being freedom from
restraint on the assumption that restraint is wrong in
itself 1 — we can roughly distinguish between posi
tive and negative philosophies of laissez faire.
Adam Smith's views concerning economic be
havior were positive in this sense, not because they
were necessarily correct, but because they were
based on extensive inquiries into the nature of
wealth, the nature of human motivation and be
havior, and a clear belief in the desirability of the
conditions to which he thought a free market
economy would contribute. One may, of course,
quarrel with his views, but the fact remains that he
had a carefully worked out theory of social welfare
and advocated free enterprise as the best means of
achieving it. It is not inconceivable that a positive
doctrine of educational laissez faire might be simi
larly grounded on some carefully worked out and
coherent theory of the objectives, functions, and
social impact of higher education. But SES failed to
provide any such theory Instead it provided a nega
tive philosophy of laissez faire based on the view
that in higher education, restraints of any kind are
inherently bad. Moreover, this view was itself based
on a curiously narrow and dubious line of argument
which calls for special attention and comment.
The SES committee took the position that it ought
to base its "proposed reponses to the problems of
education at Stanford on careful consideration of
the meaning of education for individual teacher and
student and of the nature of the university" (Vol. I, p.
8). So far, so good. But it then proceeded to deal
with these questions, not by considering the general
objectives, functions and possible impact of higher
education in and on today's society, nor by consider
ing the important "new dimensions" which it had
cited in the opening sentence of its report as having
been introduced by the student unrest of the 1960's.
Instead, the Committee attempted to deal with all
these questions by the simple expedient of examin
ing the etymology of the single world, education '
The Committee established its "basic premises" i

as follows:
To establish our basic premises we must
begin with our conceptions of education and
of a university. The world 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educere meaning to
lead forth.' To lead does not mean to com
pel, or to push, or to pull. It means quite
simply what it says.. (1,10)
On this foundation it was immediately concluded
(among other things) that education "can never be
compelled nor can knowledge be impressed on a
mind unwilling to learn if it is to be more than indoc
trination'' (I, 10). It was also inferred (without any
corresponding concern for the etymology of the
word "university") that "the University can nevei
educate in the true sense of the word, but it can
supply the environment and the means necessary
to insure that those who came here may educate
each other and themselves'' (I, 10). In short, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, the weight of the
whole report seems to have rested upon the pre
sumed etymology of the word educate.'
The deficiences of this approach are obvious:
1 Words change their meanings. Hence even i
this particular etymology were adequately stated, i
could give no more than a tentative and partial hin
as to the present meaning of the word "education."
2. Given a complex enterprise like that of moderr
education, many different words are involved. If we
are to rely on etymology, we ought surely to con
sider also the etymologies of a variety of other En
glish words which are relevant to education, such as
learning, training, study, scholarship, instruction,
teaching, tutoring, lecturing, research, etc. These
would yield different results, reflecting the simple
fact that education has many facets, and dimen
sions, which cannot be captured by looking at any
simplified etymology of any single word.
3. On the Latin side, we should note first that in
addition to the verb educere (3rd conjugation) on
which the SES committee chose to rely, there was
another related Latin verb, educare (Ist conjuga
tion) meaning 'to train, to rear, to bring up ' It is from
the latter (and its nouneducatfo) that our word edu
cation' is most immediately derived. Secondly, the
Romans had several other verbs which they applied
to the process of education, including instituere,
instruere, and erudire. None of these suggests to
lead forth ; the first two suggested the idea of estab
lishing,' constructing' or setting in order, while the
last implied making smooth.'
Thus the committee's central line of argument —
the first among its "basic premises" — must be
rejected as wholly misconceived This fact does not,
of course, necessarily refute the laissez faire
philosophy which the committee derived from it; as
previously observed, that philosophy might con
ceivably be supported on other grounds. However,
since no other basis was supplied, the committee's
general conclusion stands unsupported. We are left
with, at best, a negative theory of laissez faire — a
theory which might as well have been adopted out of
sheer inertia or even from an impulse to deflate
student po'itical demands by making educational
concessions 2 On this view, educational restraints
are wrong primarily because they are burdensome
and because they are disliked. Eliminating require
ments is good because freedom is good, in and of
itself If teachers are free to teach what they want to
teach and students are free to learn what they want
to leam, we may trust that everybody will benefit and
that the proper interests of society will be served
111
The question now is whether that trust has been
vindicated or discredited The indications are
mounting that it has been discredited — that the kind
of educational laissez faire recommended by the
SES report has already been found seriously defi
cient Several emerging difficulties call for particular
attention.
1 The problem of standards
Derek Bok, President of Harvard University (and
a Stanford alumnus) began a recent article "On the
Purposes of Undergraduate Education' (Daedalus.
Fall, 1974, pp 159-172) as follows
"Scholars who study the behavior of
human organizations constantly stress the
importance of defining institutional goals
Without dear objectives, it is said, an mstitu
tion cannot evaluate how well it is perform
ing, decide how to allocate its resources
wisely, plan for future growth, motivate its
members, or justify its existence to the
larger public
"Despite these admonitions, our colleges
seem to exist without making much of an
effort to define their aims In the thick reports
on undergraduate education that many col
leges have produced in recent years, there
is little discuMion of what it is that a liberal
arts education should provide for me stu-

dent. The prevailing sentiment is captured
by the statement of a curriculum committee
in one of our most distinguished univer
sities: The objective toward which cur
riculum planning should strive is, to the ex
tent possible, to let the teacher teach what
he wants to teach and the student learn
t what he wants to learn.' "
It should be noted lhat the concluding sentence,
cited as exemplifying a prevalent defiaency, is bor
rowed from the SES report; it is the second of the
two excerpts quoted at the beginning of this paper
Bok's point is that the SES philosophy of laissez
faire provides no standards for directing or evaluat
ing any aspect of the academic enterprise, or judg
ing academic performance. If the controlling objec
tive is to allow teachers and students to do whatever
they prefer, why should the university not provide
instruction in basketweaving? If it be replied that
accepted standards of academic excellence and
competence are assumed, the question arises
where such standards originate and how they are
maintained. To the extent that they are needed, the
laissez faire philosophy is thereby shown to be in
adequate
It is one thing to maintain that teachers should
enjoy teaching and that students should enjoy learn
ing, but it is something else to say that immediate
enjoyment — which can vary according to the fash
ions of the day — is to be taken as the primary
measure of academic success. It is perhaps worth
remarking that while the SES report relied on Alfred
North Whitehead's observation that the University's
justification is to preserve "the connection between
knowledge and the zest of life, by uniting the young
and the old in the imaginative consideration of learn
ing" (SES, I, 10) it failed to note that in the same
essay (as well as elsewhere in his writings on edu
cation) Whitehead stressed the need for a "discip
line of imagination" so that the superior vigor of the
young should be tempered by the superior experi
ence of the elders. The persistent problem of educa
tion, in Whitehead's view, is to combine discipline
and imagination so that neither destroys the other.
In his words, "qualities essential at a later stage of a
career are apt to be stamped out in an earlier stage
This is only an instance of the more general fact, that
technical excellence can only be acquired by a train
ing which is apt to damage those energies of mind
which should direct the technical skill. This is the key
fact in education, and the reason for most of its
difficulties." 3
2. Problems of specialization and vocationalism
The Harvard report of 1945, General Education in
a Free Society, probably the most widely influential t
report on higher issued in the decadea
immediate following World War II, devoted most of
its attention to a discussion of the purposes and
functions of education in a free society, "It is fruit
less," the Harvard committee wrote, "to think about
any such practical step as a curriculum without hav
ing in mind specifications or points of reference, in
this case the ends toward which the curriculum
should look and the students for whom it is in
tended." 4
The main problems of education were there attri
buted to three sources: first, the progressive expan
sion of knowledge with the attendant multiplication
of specialisms and sub-specialisms in all areas;
second, the great increase in the number of college
students as opportunities for education beyond the
high-school were extended from the privileged few
and made available to young people at large; and
third, to the increasing complexity of modern society
itself. To cope with these problems, the Harvard
committee felt that education at the college level
ought to perform a dual role. It must, on the one
hand, fully recognize the need for increasing
specialization and provide a foundation for students
going on to careers or vocations requiring particular
skills in diverse areas. But it must at the same time
seek to balance the fragmentation and atomization
threatened by the multiplication of specialties by
finding some unifying dimension or dimensions. It
was concluded that the latter function required re
newed stress on the sort of education that had been
traditionally called "liberal education," specifically
the kind of education designed to develop the
natural capacities of the student as a human being
regardless of the particular social role which he or
she might subsequently fill. "Our conclusion, then,"
wrote the Harvard committee in 1945," is that the
aim of education should be to prepare an individual
to become an expert both in some particular voca
tion or art and in the general art of the free man and
the citizen. Thus the two kinds of education once
given separately to different social classes must be
given to all alike." 5
These views are cited not to suggest that the
curricular innovations recommended by the Har
vard committee in 1945 accomplished their purpose
(which is open to serious debate) but to show that
the committee identified — and tried to meet —
three problems which became more and more pres
sing in the ensuing years Among these, the con
tinued multiplication of specialisms with spreading
emphasis on the importance to the student of de
veloping marketable skills, at a high level of sophis
tication, has proved perhaps the most intractable
One way to deal with this problem is, of course, to do
nothing — to drift with the prevailing current rather
than attempt to swim against it. The SES report, with
its philosophy of laissez faire, does exactly that
Since increasing specialism is the order of the day.
and since competent scholars are specialists, it can
be claimed, "realism" dictates that we accept that
fact, adapting our education to it and letting
threatened dangers take care of themselves But
some of those threatened dangers have already
become actual.

(i) As the opinion spreads that the main function of
higher education is to develop in the student mar
ketable skills — what Steven Miller, President of
Johns Hopkins, calls "higher skilling" as opposed to
higher education 8 — for a job market which is al
ready oversaturated, the value of a college educa
tion is necessanly depreciated. If it were recog
nized, however, that the chief function of a college
education is to develop the human potential of the
student without regard to the particular job he or she
might eventually hold or the particular social role he
or she might occupy, the result would be otherwise
Success or failure in the job market would not be
considered so crucial There is here an illustration of
the point made before, that the objectives (or sup
posed objectives) of education always provide the
criteria for evaluating success or failure
(ii) In regard to the nature and status if knowledge,
Steven Muller, in the article just mentioned, asked
the pregnant question If all our scholars are stand
ing at the frontiers of knowledge, who is standing at
the center? Is there today any center? If not, how
can there be any community of scholars in the tradi
tional sense?
Under present conditions, there is no genuine
community of teachers or students in any college or
university, but rather an aggregate of specialists
and students, each pursuing his or her own sepa
rate interests in geographical proximity, with little or
no basis for cross-disciplinary communication or
understanding One consequence is that most scho
lars feel more affinity with, and more respect for,
their professional colleagues in other universities
than for members of other departments in their own
And there is no longer any unity of knowledge, but
only a collocation of separate knowledges Such a
situation may. perhaps, be defended certainly it is
preferable to an ideological uniformity arbitrarily im
posed But surety there is a middle ground between

these extremes. Muller considers that some return
to general education, with universal requirements
for English, for a second language, for cultural his
tory, and for science, is necessary to restore the
un 'ty of genuine education.
What all our scholars in different disciplines have
in common is that they are all human beings, that
they all share the same cultural inheritance, and that
they are all engaged (or should be) in the same
quest — the quest for greater knowledge and wider
understanding. And we do well, we believe, to recall
the observation of Arthur Lovejoy that he who knows
only his own special field may not know what is most
worth looking lor in his special field. 7
#ii) An extensive investigation recently conducted
byktwo ecfcjcation reporters of the Los Angeles
Tunes into the concurrent phenomena of progres
sive grade inflation along with progressive decline in
the average level of students' proficiency has been
the widespread substitution of new elective
oourses, sometimes lacking in academic rigor, for
the kind of basic courses which used to be required
for all students. 8 Though the demonstration is not
conclusive, it is at least persuasively documented
As against suggestions that the decline in test
scores is due to other causes — such as altered
family structures, the increased number of less qual
ified students, regional factors, or the unreliability of
test scores — the authors of the report point out that
the two areas where test scores have not declined
but held steady or advanced are the areas in which
basic requirements have been largely retained, i.e.,
in the first three primary grades in school and in the
sciences at post-secondary level. These investiga
tions, which are too long to summanze, are worth
senous attention. At least, they cannot be ignored,
despite the attempts of some educators to dismiss
or discount them.
(iv) There is clear evidence that college students
today resent the increasingly competitive atmos
phere of post-secondary education. 9 It seems to be
a fair inference that the competitive aspect reflects
the increasing emphasis in higher education upon
the development of marketable skills. When stu
dents are competing for entrance to professional
schools or for jobs requiring technical proficiency,
and when good grades are seen as important for
Stich purposes, the process of college education
naturally comes to be seen as a struggle of each
against all; for admission to a limited number of
'ftllure positions. But liberal education, in the tradi
tional sense, has a different character. The
philosopher Spinoza pointed out that intellectual
goods sought for their own sake are non-
C9mpetitive. If one person achieves wisdom or in
creased insight, he is not threatened but reinforced
if his neighbors do likewise. Here is one major dif
ference between virtues of character and technical
skills, at least where the latter determine job oppor
tunities. Nothing is so useful or agreeable to the
virtuous man, Spinoza wrote, as the company of
others who are like-minded. Where self-realization
or self-improvement is the aim rather than voca
tional proficiency — as is the case with liberal edu
cation — emulation can be a spur without being a
threat. And the community of scholars, for teachers
and students alike, rests upon such a foundation
Thef search for "higher skilling" is centrifugal; the
search for liberal education is centripetal. A student
whose aim is self-development or self-improvement
as a human being values grades only as indications
of his own progress, not for any advantage they may
give over others.

(v) As our society becomes increasingly complex,
as specialisms multiply, and as it becomes increas
ingly apparent that the most serious problems ex
tend over many diciplines, it follows, as Professor
Gabriel Almond has observed, that "only higher
order philosophical syntheses can spell out the big
issues and formulate alternative solutions." 10 At the
same time, our society is becoming more and more
susceptible at all levels to the pull of simplistic slo
gans, catchwords, images, stereotypes and
counter-stereotypes. In this situation the need for
critical intelligence and balanced judgment is be
coming more and more acute, yet this need is not
likely to be apparent to the beginning student, par
ticularly if he is bent on acquiring some particular
skill. The SES report quoted approvingly an obser
vation of Professor Edwin M. Good to the effect that
the important simplicities are those which lie "on the
other side of complexity" (Vol. I, p. 11). Surely the
proper inference is that today's student, seeking tp
pick his way through the growing thicket of com
plexities towards some thoughtful and balanced
overview — as opposed to the delusive simplicities
offered by catchwords and fashionable stereotypes
— needs more guidance and direction than ever
before. The claim of the SES committee that today's
student is in a better position than anybody else to
choose the academic path he will take (Vol. I. p. 15)
seems like saying that the thicker the forest be
comes, the less need there is to require would-be
travellers to take a guide.
IV
Recommendations for achieving the aims of lib
eral education generally envisage imposed re
quirements covenng, in addition to courses in En
glish and in a foreign language, a required course or
courses in Western culture or the history of ideas
We are not concerned here with particular prog
rams, but with the sort of objections most commonly
raised against imposing such requirements.
1. It is often claimed that a required course in
Western culture or the history of ideas in the West is
chauvinistic, since it implies the superiority of the
Western tradition above other traditions The objec
tion is misconceived The purpose of studying the
Western tradition is not to celebrate it but to under
stand It — for good or ill. To evaluate Western
culture, or any other culture, without first making the
effort to understand it is to judge irrationally without
adequate evidence Many people make this very
mistake, but the fact that the mistake is common
affords a good reason for trying to correct it.
2. It is often claimed that requiring students to
study any particular subject is arbitrary because no
particular subject is intrinsically more important than
any other One might, so the argument goes, make
as good a case for general requirement in, say,
psychology or the scientific study of human be
havior The answer here is that all heirs of the West
ern tradition — whether specialists or generalists,
students or faculty, regardless of their special in
terests and capacities — are themselves con
ditioned by Western culture The same is true of all
the specialized disciplines which have developed in
the West they all reflect distinctively Western con
ceptions of rationality and the role of systematic
inquiry '' (Xir heritage affects our preconceptions
about the nature and function of scientific know
ledge as well as our preconceptions about values
and norms It is not too much to say that no person
can hope to understand who he or she is without
some understanding of the cultural context, handed
down from prior generations, in which he or she
presently exists Nobody lives, thinks, or talks in a
cultural void Nobody is exempt from cultural influ
ences Hence the peculiar importance of a general
requirement that students systematically examine
the cultural background which they all share
3 It is sometimes objected that a cultural re
quirement would put a premium on conformity to
accepted values We would suggest that the oppo
site is true The dangerous conformities are those
which are blind, unconscious, and uncritical Most
cultures breed rebels as well as conformists, as our

culture has. If a required course in Western culture
is designed (as above noted) to promote the accu
rate understanding of the Western orientation, the
result should be to make both rebels and confor
mists more dearly aware of what it is that they are
rejecting or accepting.
4. It has been objected that there is no reliable
evidence by which we can evaluate the effective
ness of general courses of the kind here envisaged;
hence they should not be required. We grant the
premise but reject the conclusion. The difficulty of
evaluation arises principally, we think, from the fact
that a good educational program has, or should
have, a long-term impact upon the student, and
such impacts are not precisely identifiable or quanti
fiable. To insist too much on precise evaluations
tends to put the emphasis on those short-term be
nefits and immediate satisfaction which can be as
certained, at the expense of the lasting benefits
which can be recognized, if at all, only in retrospect.
However this may be, the present objection cuts
both ways. If we cannot measure in advance the
precise effectiveness of a proposed requirement,
we cannot measure the relative effectiveness of a
program from which such requirements are omitted.
5. It has been claimed that students cannot be
made to learn what they do not wish to learn, or, as
last year s Council of ASSU Presidents put it, "You
can lead a student to a class but you can't make one
think." This position calls for clarification, because it
is highly ambiguous.
Much of what we learn from everyday experience
is not chosen, but forced upon us, often against our
wills, like learning that hot stoves can burn or that
careless driving invites serious accidents. With re
gard to required courses, the evidence is that many
generations of Stanford graduates found value in,
and claim to have profited from, the old course in
Western Civilization despite its having been pre
scribed. Many required courses in other colleges
and universities seem to have had substantial suc
cess. It is evident that the present objection is over
stated.
Perhaps we should interpret it to mean that stu
dents learn better when they study subjects which
they enjoy. There is some truth in this, but there is
also room for a serious confusion. One may enjoy
the process of studying a subject without liking or
approving the subject under study. A medical stu
dent, for example, does not normally enjoy or ap
prove of diseases A student of criminal behavior
does not normally enjoy or approve of crime. Such
students take satisfaction in learning how to cope
with the problems created by disease and crime. So
also a student of Western culture need not like or
approve of Western culture as such in order to find
satisfaction in making a study of it. If this distinction
is kept in mind, a further point emerges, namely, that
nobody can judge whether studying a given subject
will yield satisfaction or prove valuable to him until
after he has engaged in it. Students who view all
required courses as an infringement upon their
freedom of choice sometimes forget that freedom to
make informed choices is not the same as freedom
to make uninformed choices.
It used to be taken lor granted that if students
came to college, it was because they wished to be
made to think, this being accepted as an essential
part of a college education. The present argument,
however, introduces a distinction, as if students
were now saying: "Please give us an education, but
don't make us Slink — or at least, don't make us
think any more than we like or about topics we don't
like." Such a position, if taken seriously, would make
disciplined thinking peripheral rather than central to
the educational process, since disciplined thinking
is usually laborious and the habit of disciplined think
ing can only be acquired, like other skills, by sus
tained practice and fatiguing application.
Finally, it should be noted that when autonomy is
equated with negative freedom in Berlin's sense —
that is to say with freedom from restraints — and
when freedom from restraints is conceived as imply
ing freedom from any imposed norms or standards,
autonomy loses its value As Sartre showed in
Being and Nothingness, freedom without
guidelines is a burden; it is the freedom of the travel
ler lost in the jungle without a map, who can move in
any direction he wishes but has no basis for choos
ing one direction rather than another. From the
psychological point of view, this kind of freedom
results either in existential despair or in a kind of
narcissism which, valuing only sensations and ple
asures of the moment, and fearing the restraint of
any firm commitments, ends by trivalizing the very
pleasures it claims to prize. l 2 It also serves to de
stroy community with others; cooperation among
individuals is impossible where there are no com
monly accepted standards of acceptable and unac
ceptable behavior, because nobody can count on
what others will do. And even the ideal of universal
brotherhood is weakened if it is taken to imply free
dom from any concrete responsibilities to any par
ticular human beings 13
In a society where catchwords tend to replace
critical inquiry, words like freedom' and autonomy
take on a life of their own and acquire a special
emotional force, as if they represented absolute
goods. If autonomy is valuable, we easily assume
that the more autonomy we have the better off we
are, and that a condition of unlimited autonomy must
be best of all But such is not the case Individual
freedom and autonomy are vitally important as in
strumental goods, but to convert them into absolute
goods is to destroy their function.
V
In the foregoing section we have argued that re
quirements, far from being an evil, are, in fact,
necessary for the purposes of a liberal education
Here we may be more specific about requirements
at Stanford.
The Stanford undergraduate curriculum currentty
includes two requirements One is that of the Major,
based on the pnnciple of study in depth This re
quirement was re-examined and reaffirmed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (Campus
Report, 130ct. 1976, p.B). The other is the recently
redefined Distnbution Requirement wtiich aims to
provide the breadth of study necessary for a liberal
eAjcation to yield "a richer personal life through the
development of spaciousness of mind and spirit
The Distribution Requirements exist to ensure ex
posure to different ideas and different ways of think
ing They should enable (one) to understand better
the major ways of knowing,' to assess their
strengths and limitations, to appreciate their un
iqueness, and no less importantly to discern what
they have in common" (DRAT, p 21).
Under the present system, work in the three re
quired areas entails the study of certain works of
creative imagination in their cultural and histoncal
contexts, or of certain problems of philosophy and
belief (Humanities); the study of society, social in
stitutions. and human behavior (Social Saences);
and the study of natural phenomena, technology,
and math (NS/M/T) The stress in each area is upon
approaches, scholarly methods, and the general
human significance of the vanous kinds of study In
addition, for each area, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommends development of
groups of correlated courses; in Humanities the
courses chosen to fulfil the requirement must form a
group which can be certified" by the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (directly approved by the Dean
if the group is chosen by a student, indirectly, if set
up by a department)
The pnnaple of breadth is thus fulfilled by requir

ing a certain amount of study in the three areas into
which human knowledge has been conveniently di
vided. Vet, within each area, a different principle of
order is invoked, and a broad, comprehensive out
look is neither required nor encouraged Moreover,
no principles are stated for the organization of cor re
lated groups or "sequences" within the areas. Nor
has advice been given to departments on the ways
in which they should, in practice, "group" their own
courses or correlate them with courses in other de
partments
In addition, students have not been advised about
the designing of a Humanities program which might
be acceptable to the Doan. Much of the "freedom"
prescribed by SES was predicated on the assump
tion that undergraduate advising, especially for un
declared majors (freshman and sophomore years),
would be vigorous and that the "strongly recom
mended" alternatives and choices would be made
under vigilant academic guidance. Unfortunately,
the faculty, as advisors, cannot peiform the neces
sary academic surveillance given the laissoz fain)
philosophy of the present system.
This loosely structured program may have some
merit in that it recognizes the validity of both syn
chronic and diachronic methods of study, however,
it is impractical and unwittingly misleading. A stu
dent can easily justify the coherence of a group of
three courses, on say, the liteiature, art and society
of fifth-century Athens, or that of a group embracing
the three story-tellers Homer, Dorothy Richardson
and Dostoyevsky, or even that of any three courses
taught by an individual professor.
Are these two requirements — Major and Dis
tribution — an adequate foundation for a liberal
education? We feel that they are not. The student
certainly needs the intellectual methods proper to
the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences which the Distribution Requirement is
supposed to provide. But a good liberal education
has to be more comprehensive. It must include
some systematic study of the fundamental nature
and development of the culture and civilization
within which the student is living and to which he will
someday contribute. It must also provide basic in
formation about the complexities of modern society,
the means to analyse and evaluate that society, and
the perspective necessary to judge it on a compara
tive basis. In addition, the student should have some
knowledge of a culture remote from his own — a
culture outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition, suc h
as Greek or Asian — which will confront him with
ideas that challenge his unconscious assumptions
about his own time and place.
Many who agree in principle with such educa
tional ideals feel that they cannot be achieved. We
disagree. This is a university rich in teaching re
sources which has demonstrated on other occa
sions an ability to make sensible and worthwhile
educational innovations when they have been
needed. They are needed now. Departments and
individual instructors are well-equipped to deal with
the task at hand, and we should certainly draw on
our excellent teaching resources.
The Report of the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford has
suggested certain specific ways in which, through a
program of "tracks," undergraduate education
could achieve the strength and the focus it lacks at
the moment. The Report also mentions the desira
bility of historical and comparative studies whereby
modern Western culture can be confr onted not only
with past stages of its development, but also with
manifestations of other cultures. The program en
visioned by the Report is based partly on existing
courses covering the Western tradition. This prog
ram would allow the student to choose among four
approaches — literature and language; history; re
ligion and philosophy, or the creative and perform
ing arts — all leading to the same goal. This ap
proach would give to each student an educational
program more coherent than the present one.
The appropriate authorities — the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, the Doan of Undar
graduate Studies, the Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (where most under
graduate teaching takes place) — must now de
velop a plan for providing, either through new
courses or through the adaptation of existing
courses, a method for satisfying the educational
needs we have outlined. Those authorities should
also consider how that plan, when in operation,
could be monitored effectively T he responsibility
our University has to its undergraduates and the
obligation it has to its reputation demands that such
action be taken promptly.
Having outlined our views in this general stato
ment, we intend to publish in the next few months a
series of position papers suggesting concrete im
provements to undergraduate education at Stan
ford.

For approximately one year, a group o
humanities faculty members, gathering together tc
discuss issues of mutual concern, has debated the
merits of the present structure of the undergraduate
curriculum at Stanford. Events both local and na
tional have encouraged this sustained debate. The
group has had, moreover, the opportunity to hear, al
its informal sessions, the opinions of some of the
' officers of the University who could be expected to
play key roles in the elaboration of the under
graduate curnculum in future years. Among these
officers have been the President, the Dean ol
Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Under
gracfcjate Studies, and the Dean of Admissions.
What herewith follows is not necessarily a reflec
tion of the attitudes of any one of these officers, nor
of any one faculty member Rather, the group as a
whole would now like to offer to the campus com
munity a statement bearing on the design of that
curnculum. The group recognizes that it possesses
neither final wisdom nor institutional authority in
matters such as these; it also recognizes that exten
sive planning remains to be done before revisions in
the curriculum can be addopted
The group speaks, however, with a sense ol
urgency. It is satisfied neither with the quality of the
intellectual life, nor with the goals and standards of
the undergraduate program. It believes, moreover,
that dissatisfaction, at times expressed and at other
times muted, is a sentiment shared by many faculty
members at Stanford. Nor is such a condition
merely local. Discussion within the group has been
enlivened in the past year by the clear recognition
that the problems Stanford now faces (and must
rigorously attempt to resolve) are problems affect
ing every prestigious institution of higher learning.
That the problems are national in their dimensions is
indicated by, among other things, the special
1974-75 issues of Daedalus (Journal of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences) wherein
eighty-four distinguished educators, including sev
eral from Stanford, speak to the conditions now
defining academic life. Differences among these
educators are certainly present, but all are
frightened, as the editor says, "by what they see as
a lack of concern for intellectual values, others worry
about what they think to be a reduced social con
sciousness." The perspective in which this deep
concern, on both the national level and the local
level, takes place is more serious, of course, than
the question of which course or courses must be
required of the undergraduate. It is more serious
than any particular detail. But details and particulars
will, at the appropriate moment, play their crucial
part when revisions in the curriculum are proposed
and then established. The editor of Daedalus de
scribes the newly emergent situation not as "a re
petition of the discussion that occurred in the middle
of the nineteenth century when a rigid, classically
oriented college curriculum was challenged by the
new theoretical and applied sciences. Much more is
at stake today; the continued viability of the concept
of the liberally-educated person is involved."
About the continued viability the Stanford com
munity has the deepest obligation to be concerned.
In the immediate past, that concern has been ex
pressed by the Report of the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stan
ford. The spirit of that Report, in which a clear com
mitment to a requirement in Western Culture is af
firmed, must be sustained and nourished. Hence
the informal Humanities and Sciences group is
happy to note that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has recently, and unanimously, also en
dorsed "the principle that studies in Western Culture
should be part of each student's education."
Discussions within the group have also been in
vigorated by the understanding that the problems
Stanford now faces are not purely national but are
Stanford's own This university must fulfill the spe
cial obligations it has as a private institution, of great
prestige, within a state and a geography dominated
by non-private institutions Its mission has been,
and is, special; so can be the quality of its under
graduate education. To this obligation President
Richard W. Lyman has often spoken, and most tel
lingly speaks in the pages of Daedalus, where he
says
We who are responsible for the continuing
health of our "little platoons" — and even
the greatest of the private universities are
"little platoons" when matched against the
dimensions of state-supported higher edu
cation — we have our work cut out for us...
one virture that ought to be within the reach
of independent institutions, be they old or
new, famous or obscure, is that of rigorous
self-definition.
It is to that rigor arte 1 that self-definition that Stan
ford's attention must now turn Prompted, then, by
both the national anxiety and concern, and opposed
to the idle, helpless notion that little can be done in
the face of curricular and intellectual complexity, this
statement is offered to the Stanford community It is
hoped that it will play some effective part in discus
sions within the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
and the Academic Senate.
The pnnciples underlying the 1968 Study of Edu
cation at Stanford are treated here first. That Study
predates the Report of the Committee on the Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
and by virtue of the seriousness and thoughtfulness
with which it was undertaken, has achieved a con
siderable weight in later discussions of curricular
reform But as the Study itself observes, its spirit
was one of "self-examination and self-renewal." It
further observes that "the study of education must
become a process rather than event." Eight years
have since passed: changes now seem wholly
proper and necessary In the light, then, of such
changes to be made, a second matter for discussion
follows the first It is a consideration of the newly
formulated system of distnbution requirements. Al
though that system is the product of much labor on
the part of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, it does not coherently and directly address
the fundamental inadequacies of the present cur
ncular program for the undergraduate student, it is a
system that is too diffuse and too loosely monitored
to be able to do so Only by a program that is more
coherently structured can the mtellecuual life of the
Stanford student be made more challenging, in
tense, and rewarding
II
The basic philosophy of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). published in 1968-69, was that of
educational laissez fairs This is reflected in two
parallel pronouncements, the first of which ap
peared in the general introductory section of the
report and the second in the section on under
graduate education
"Let fie objectrve of curncular planning be
to encourage the faculty member to teach
what he likes to teach and the student to
learn what seems vital to him — the Intellec
tual History of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century rather than the History of Western
Civilization Modern Consciousness rather
than Freshman English. Organizational Be
havior rather than Introduction to Sociology
— and from this common freedom may
emerge a form of general education far bet
ter suited to the cftaractennbcs of a umver
slty than that to which we pay lip service

now." (Vol. I, p. 14)
And again:
"The objective toward which curriculum
planning should strive is, to the extent pos
sible, to let the teacher teach what he wants
to teach and the student learn what he
wants to learn." (Vol. II, p. 12)
Now philosophies of laissez faire can be arrived at
in different ways and supported or defended on
different grounds. Having in mind Isaiah Berlin's
significant distinction between positive and negative
conceptions of freedom — possitive freedom being
freedom for the achievement of some end deemed
desirable, negative freedom being freedom from
restraint on the assumption that restraint is wrong in
itself 1 — we can roughly distinguish between posi
tive and negative philosophies of laissez faire.
Adam Smith's views concerning economic be
havior were positive in this sense, not because they
were necessarily correct, but because they were
based on extensive inquiries into the nature of
wealth, the nature of human motivation and be
havior, and a clear belief in the desirability of the
conditions to which he thought a free market
economy would contribute. One may, of course,
quarrel with his views, but the fact remains that he
had a carefully worked out theory of social welfare
and advocated free enterprise as the best means of
achieving it. It is not inconceivable that a positive
doctrine of educational laissez faire might be simi
larly grounded on some carefully worked out and
coherent theory of the objectives, functions, and
social impact of higher education. But SES failed to
provide any such theory Instead it provided a nega
tive philosophy of laissez faire based on the view
that in higher education, restraints of any kind are
inherently bad. Moreover, this view was itself based
on a curiously narrow and dubious line of argument
which calls for special attention and comment.
The SES committee took the position that it ought
to base its "proposed reponses to the problems of
education at Stanford on careful consideration of
the meaning of education for individual teacher and
student and of the nature of the university" (Vol. I, p.
8). So far, so good. But it then proceeded to deal
with these questions, not by considering the general
objectives, functions and possible impact of higher
education in and on today's society, nor by consider
ing the important "new dimensions" which it had
cited in the opening sentence of its report as having
been introduced by the student unrest of the 1960's.
Instead, the Committee attempted to deal with all
these questions by the simple expedient of examin
ing the etymology of the single world, education '
The Committee established its "basic premises" i

as follows:
To establish our basic premises we must
begin with our conceptions of education and
of a university. The world 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educere meaning to
lead forth.' To lead does not mean to com
pel, or to push, or to pull. It means quite
simply what it says.. (1,10)
On this foundation it was immediately concluded
(among other things) that education "can never be
compelled nor can knowledge be impressed on a
mind unwilling to learn if it is to be more than indoc
trination'' (I, 10). It was also inferred (without any
corresponding concern for the etymology of the
word "university") that "the University can nevei
educate in the true sense of the word, but it can
supply the environment and the means necessary
to insure that those who came here may educate
each other and themselves'' (I, 10). In short, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, the weight of the
whole report seems to have rested upon the pre
sumed etymology of the word educate.'
The deficiences of this approach are obvious:
1 Words change their meanings. Hence even i
this particular etymology were adequately stated, i
could give no more than a tentative and partial hin
as to the present meaning of the word "education."
2. Given a complex enterprise like that of moderr
education, many different words are involved. If we
are to rely on etymology, we ought surely to con
sider also the etymologies of a variety of other En
glish words which are relevant to education, such as
learning, training, study, scholarship, instruction,
teaching, tutoring, lecturing, research, etc. These
would yield different results, reflecting the simple
fact that education has many facets, and dimen
sions, which cannot be captured by looking at any
simplified etymology of any single word.
3. On the Latin side, we should note first that in
addition to the verb educere (3rd conjugation) on
which the SES committee chose to rely, there was
another related Latin verb, educare (Ist conjuga
tion) meaning 'to train, to rear, to bring up ' It is from
the latter (and its nouneducatfo) that our word edu
cation' is most immediately derived. Secondly, the
Romans had several other verbs which they applied
to the process of education, including instituere,
instruere, and erudire. None of these suggests to
lead forth ; the first two suggested the idea of estab
lishing,' constructing' or setting in order, while the
last implied making smooth.'
Thus the committee's central line of argument —
the first among its "basic premises" — must be
rejected as wholly misconceived This fact does not,
of course, necessarily refute the laissez faire
philosophy which the committee derived from it; as
previously observed, that philosophy might con
ceivably be supported on other grounds. However,
since no other basis was supplied, the committee's
general conclusion stands unsupported. We are left
with, at best, a negative theory of laissez faire — a
theory which might as well have been adopted out of
sheer inertia or even from an impulse to deflate
student po'itical demands by making educational
concessions 2 On this view, educational restraints
are wrong primarily because they are burdensome
and because they are disliked. Eliminating require
ments is good because freedom is good, in and of
itself If teachers are free to teach what they want to
teach and students are free to learn what they want
to leam, we may trust that everybody will benefit and
that the proper interests of society will be served
111
The question now is whether that trust has been
vindicated or discredited The indications are
mounting that it has been discredited — that the kind
of educational laissez faire recommended by the
SES report has already been found seriously defi
cient Several emerging difficulties call for particular
attention.
1 The problem of standards
Derek Bok, President of Harvard University (and
a Stanford alumnus) began a recent article "On the
Purposes of Undergraduate Education' (Daedalus.
Fall, 1974, pp 159-172) as follows
"Scholars who study the behavior of
human organizations constantly stress the
importance of defining institutional goals
Without dear objectives, it is said, an mstitu
tion cannot evaluate how well it is perform
ing, decide how to allocate its resources
wisely, plan for future growth, motivate its
members, or justify its existence to the
larger public
"Despite these admonitions, our colleges
seem to exist without making much of an
effort to define their aims In the thick reports
on undergraduate education that many col
leges have produced in recent years, there
is little discuMion of what it is that a liberal
arts education should provide for me stu-

dent. The prevailing sentiment is captured
by the statement of a curriculum committee
in one of our most distinguished univer
sities: The objective toward which cur
riculum planning should strive is, to the ex
tent possible, to let the teacher teach what
he wants to teach and the student learn
t what he wants to learn.' "
It should be noted lhat the concluding sentence,
cited as exemplifying a prevalent defiaency, is bor
rowed from the SES report; it is the second of the
two excerpts quoted at the beginning of this paper
Bok's point is that the SES philosophy of laissez
faire provides no standards for directing or evaluat
ing any aspect of the academic enterprise, or judg
ing academic performance. If the controlling objec
tive is to allow teachers and students to do whatever
they prefer, why should the university not provide
instruction in basketweaving? If it be replied that
accepted standards of academic excellence and
competence are assumed, the question arises
where such standards originate and how they are
maintained. To the extent that they are needed, the
laissez faire philosophy is thereby shown to be in
adequate
It is one thing to maintain that teachers should
enjoy teaching and that students should enjoy learn
ing, but it is something else to say that immediate
enjoyment — which can vary according to the fash
ions of the day — is to be taken as the primary
measure of academic success. It is perhaps worth
remarking that while the SES report relied on Alfred
North Whitehead's observation that the University's
justification is to preserve "the connection between
knowledge and the zest of life, by uniting the young
and the old in the imaginative consideration of learn
ing" (SES, I, 10) it failed to note that in the same
essay (as well as elsewhere in his writings on edu
cation) Whitehead stressed the need for a "discip
line of imagination" so that the superior vigor of the
young should be tempered by the superior experi
ence of the elders. The persistent problem of educa
tion, in Whitehead's view, is to combine discipline
and imagination so that neither destroys the other.
In his words, "qualities essential at a later stage of a
career are apt to be stamped out in an earlier stage
This is only an instance of the more general fact, that
technical excellence can only be acquired by a train
ing which is apt to damage those energies of mind
which should direct the technical skill. This is the key
fact in education, and the reason for most of its
difficulties." 3
2. Problems of specialization and vocationalism
The Harvard report of 1945, General Education in
a Free Society, probably the most widely influential t
report on higher issued in the decadea
immediate following World War II, devoted most of
its attention to a discussion of the purposes and
functions of education in a free society, "It is fruit
less," the Harvard committee wrote, "to think about
any such practical step as a curriculum without hav
ing in mind specifications or points of reference, in
this case the ends toward which the curriculum
should look and the students for whom it is in
tended." 4
The main problems of education were there attri
buted to three sources: first, the progressive expan
sion of knowledge with the attendant multiplication
of specialisms and sub-specialisms in all areas;
second, the great increase in the number of college
students as opportunities for education beyond the
high-school were extended from the privileged few
and made available to young people at large; and
third, to the increasing complexity of modern society
itself. To cope with these problems, the Harvard
committee felt that education at the college level
ought to perform a dual role. It must, on the one
hand, fully recognize the need for increasing
specialization and provide a foundation for students
going on to careers or vocations requiring particular
skills in diverse areas. But it must at the same time
seek to balance the fragmentation and atomization
threatened by the multiplication of specialties by
finding some unifying dimension or dimensions. It
was concluded that the latter function required re
newed stress on the sort of education that had been
traditionally called "liberal education," specifically
the kind of education designed to develop the
natural capacities of the student as a human being
regardless of the particular social role which he or
she might subsequently fill. "Our conclusion, then,"
wrote the Harvard committee in 1945," is that the
aim of education should be to prepare an individual
to become an expert both in some particular voca
tion or art and in the general art of the free man and
the citizen. Thus the two kinds of education once
given separately to different social classes must be
given to all alike." 5
These views are cited not to suggest that the
curricular innovations recommended by the Har
vard committee in 1945 accomplished their purpose
(which is open to serious debate) but to show that
the committee identified — and tried to meet —
three problems which became more and more pres
sing in the ensuing years Among these, the con
tinued multiplication of specialisms with spreading
emphasis on the importance to the student of de
veloping marketable skills, at a high level of sophis
tication, has proved perhaps the most intractable
One way to deal with this problem is, of course, to do
nothing — to drift with the prevailing current rather
than attempt to swim against it. The SES report, with
its philosophy of laissez faire, does exactly that
Since increasing specialism is the order of the day.
and since competent scholars are specialists, it can
be claimed, "realism" dictates that we accept that
fact, adapting our education to it and letting
threatened dangers take care of themselves But
some of those threatened dangers have already
become actual.

(i) As the opinion spreads that the main function of
higher education is to develop in the student mar
ketable skills — what Steven Miller, President of
Johns Hopkins, calls "higher skilling" as opposed to
higher education 8 — for a job market which is al
ready oversaturated, the value of a college educa
tion is necessanly depreciated. If it were recog
nized, however, that the chief function of a college
education is to develop the human potential of the
student without regard to the particular job he or she
might eventually hold or the particular social role he
or she might occupy, the result would be otherwise
Success or failure in the job market would not be
considered so crucial There is here an illustration of
the point made before, that the objectives (or sup
posed objectives) of education always provide the
criteria for evaluating success or failure
(ii) In regard to the nature and status if knowledge,
Steven Muller, in the article just mentioned, asked
the pregnant question If all our scholars are stand
ing at the frontiers of knowledge, who is standing at
the center? Is there today any center? If not, how
can there be any community of scholars in the tradi
tional sense?
Under present conditions, there is no genuine
community of teachers or students in any college or
university, but rather an aggregate of specialists
and students, each pursuing his or her own sepa
rate interests in geographical proximity, with little or
no basis for cross-disciplinary communication or
understanding One consequence is that most scho
lars feel more affinity with, and more respect for,
their professional colleagues in other universities
than for members of other departments in their own
And there is no longer any unity of knowledge, but
only a collocation of separate knowledges Such a
situation may. perhaps, be defended certainly it is
preferable to an ideological uniformity arbitrarily im
posed But surety there is a middle ground between

these extremes. Muller considers that some return
to general education, with universal requirements
for English, for a second language, for cultural his
tory, and for science, is necessary to restore the
un 'ty of genuine education.
What all our scholars in different disciplines have
in common is that they are all human beings, that
they all share the same cultural inheritance, and that
they are all engaged (or should be) in the same
quest — the quest for greater knowledge and wider
understanding. And we do well, we believe, to recall
the observation of Arthur Lovejoy that he who knows
only his own special field may not know what is most
worth looking lor in his special field. 7
#ii) An extensive investigation recently conducted
byktwo ecfcjcation reporters of the Los Angeles
Tunes into the concurrent phenomena of progres
sive grade inflation along with progressive decline in
the average level of students' proficiency has been
the widespread substitution of new elective
oourses, sometimes lacking in academic rigor, for
the kind of basic courses which used to be required
for all students. 8 Though the demonstration is not
conclusive, it is at least persuasively documented
As against suggestions that the decline in test
scores is due to other causes — such as altered
family structures, the increased number of less qual
ified students, regional factors, or the unreliability of
test scores — the authors of the report point out that
the two areas where test scores have not declined
but held steady or advanced are the areas in which
basic requirements have been largely retained, i.e.,
in the first three primary grades in school and in the
sciences at post-secondary level. These investiga
tions, which are too long to summanze, are worth
senous attention. At least, they cannot be ignored,
despite the attempts of some educators to dismiss
or discount them.
(iv) There is clear evidence that college students
today resent the increasingly competitive atmos
phere of post-secondary education. 9 It seems to be
a fair inference that the competitive aspect reflects
the increasing emphasis in higher education upon
the development of marketable skills. When stu
dents are competing for entrance to professional
schools or for jobs requiring technical proficiency,
and when good grades are seen as important for
Stich purposes, the process of college education
naturally comes to be seen as a struggle of each
against all; for admission to a limited number of
'ftllure positions. But liberal education, in the tradi
tional sense, has a different character. The
philosopher Spinoza pointed out that intellectual
goods sought for their own sake are non-
C9mpetitive. If one person achieves wisdom or in
creased insight, he is not threatened but reinforced
if his neighbors do likewise. Here is one major dif
ference between virtues of character and technical
skills, at least where the latter determine job oppor
tunities. Nothing is so useful or agreeable to the
virtuous man, Spinoza wrote, as the company of
others who are like-minded. Where self-realization
or self-improvement is the aim rather than voca
tional proficiency — as is the case with liberal edu
cation — emulation can be a spur without being a
threat. And the community of scholars, for teachers
and students alike, rests upon such a foundation
Thef search for "higher skilling" is centrifugal; the
search for liberal education is centripetal. A student
whose aim is self-development or self-improvement
as a human being values grades only as indications
of his own progress, not for any advantage they may
give over others.

(v) As our society becomes increasingly complex,
as specialisms multiply, and as it becomes increas
ingly apparent that the most serious problems ex
tend over many diciplines, it follows, as Professor
Gabriel Almond has observed, that "only higher
order philosophical syntheses can spell out the big
issues and formulate alternative solutions." 10 At the
same time, our society is becoming more and more
susceptible at all levels to the pull of simplistic slo
gans, catchwords, images, stereotypes and
counter-stereotypes. In this situation the need for
critical intelligence and balanced judgment is be
coming more and more acute, yet this need is not
likely to be apparent to the beginning student, par
ticularly if he is bent on acquiring some particular
skill. The SES report quoted approvingly an obser
vation of Professor Edwin M. Good to the effect that
the important simplicities are those which lie "on the
other side of complexity" (Vol. I, p. 11). Surely the
proper inference is that today's student, seeking tp
pick his way through the growing thicket of com
plexities towards some thoughtful and balanced
overview — as opposed to the delusive simplicities
offered by catchwords and fashionable stereotypes
— needs more guidance and direction than ever
before. The claim of the SES committee that today's
student is in a better position than anybody else to
choose the academic path he will take (Vol. I. p. 15)
seems like saying that the thicker the forest be
comes, the less need there is to require would-be
travellers to take a guide.
IV
Recommendations for achieving the aims of lib
eral education generally envisage imposed re
quirements covenng, in addition to courses in En
glish and in a foreign language, a required course or
courses in Western culture or the history of ideas
We are not concerned here with particular prog
rams, but with the sort of objections most commonly
raised against imposing such requirements.
1. It is often claimed that a required course in
Western culture or the history of ideas in the West is
chauvinistic, since it implies the superiority of the
Western tradition above other traditions The objec
tion is misconceived The purpose of studying the
Western tradition is not to celebrate it but to under
stand It — for good or ill. To evaluate Western
culture, or any other culture, without first making the
effort to understand it is to judge irrationally without
adequate evidence Many people make this very
mistake, but the fact that the mistake is common
affords a good reason for trying to correct it.
2. It is often claimed that requiring students to
study any particular subject is arbitrary because no
particular subject is intrinsically more important than
any other One might, so the argument goes, make
as good a case for general requirement in, say,
psychology or the scientific study of human be
havior The answer here is that all heirs of the West
ern tradition — whether specialists or generalists,
students or faculty, regardless of their special in
terests and capacities — are themselves con
ditioned by Western culture The same is true of all
the specialized disciplines which have developed in
the West they all reflect distinctively Western con
ceptions of rationality and the role of systematic
inquiry '' (Xir heritage affects our preconceptions
about the nature and function of scientific know
ledge as well as our preconceptions about values
and norms It is not too much to say that no person
can hope to understand who he or she is without
some understanding of the cultural context, handed
down from prior generations, in which he or she
presently exists Nobody lives, thinks, or talks in a
cultural void Nobody is exempt from cultural influ
ences Hence the peculiar importance of a general
requirement that students systematically examine
the cultural background which they all share
3 It is sometimes objected that a cultural re
quirement would put a premium on conformity to
accepted values We would suggest that the oppo
site is true The dangerous conformities are those
which are blind, unconscious, and uncritical Most
cultures breed rebels as well as conformists, as our

culture has. If a required course in Western culture
is designed (as above noted) to promote the accu
rate understanding of the Western orientation, the
result should be to make both rebels and confor
mists more dearly aware of what it is that they are
rejecting or accepting.
4. It has been objected that there is no reliable
evidence by which we can evaluate the effective
ness of general courses of the kind here envisaged;
hence they should not be required. We grant the
premise but reject the conclusion. The difficulty of
evaluation arises principally, we think, from the fact
that a good educational program has, or should
have, a long-term impact upon the student, and
such impacts are not precisely identifiable or quanti
fiable. To insist too much on precise evaluations
tends to put the emphasis on those short-term be
nefits and immediate satisfaction which can be as
certained, at the expense of the lasting benefits
which can be recognized, if at all, only in retrospect.
However this may be, the present objection cuts
both ways. If we cannot measure in advance the
precise effectiveness of a proposed requirement,
we cannot measure the relative effectiveness of a
program from which such requirements are omitted.
5. It has been claimed that students cannot be
made to learn what they do not wish to learn, or, as
last year s Council of ASSU Presidents put it, "You
can lead a student to a class but you can't make one
think." This position calls for clarification, because it
is highly ambiguous.
Much of what we learn from everyday experience
is not chosen, but forced upon us, often against our
wills, like learning that hot stoves can burn or that
careless driving invites serious accidents. With re
gard to required courses, the evidence is that many
generations of Stanford graduates found value in,
and claim to have profited from, the old course in
Western Civilization despite its having been pre
scribed. Many required courses in other colleges
and universities seem to have had substantial suc
cess. It is evident that the present objection is over
stated.
Perhaps we should interpret it to mean that stu
dents learn better when they study subjects which
they enjoy. There is some truth in this, but there is
also room for a serious confusion. One may enjoy
the process of studying a subject without liking or
approving the subject under study. A medical stu
dent, for example, does not normally enjoy or ap
prove of diseases A student of criminal behavior
does not normally enjoy or approve of crime. Such
students take satisfaction in learning how to cope
with the problems created by disease and crime. So
also a student of Western culture need not like or
approve of Western culture as such in order to find
satisfaction in making a study of it. If this distinction
is kept in mind, a further point emerges, namely, that
nobody can judge whether studying a given subject
will yield satisfaction or prove valuable to him until
after he has engaged in it. Students who view all
required courses as an infringement upon their
freedom of choice sometimes forget that freedom to
make informed choices is not the same as freedom
to make uninformed choices.
It used to be taken lor granted that if students
came to college, it was because they wished to be
made to think, this being accepted as an essential
part of a college education. The present argument,
however, introduces a distinction, as if students
were now saying: "Please give us an education, but
don't make us Slink — or at least, don't make us
think any more than we like or about topics we don't
like." Such a position, if taken seriously, would make
disciplined thinking peripheral rather than central to
the educational process, since disciplined thinking
is usually laborious and the habit of disciplined think
ing can only be acquired, like other skills, by sus
tained practice and fatiguing application.
Finally, it should be noted that when autonomy is
equated with negative freedom in Berlin's sense —
that is to say with freedom from restraints — and
when freedom from restraints is conceived as imply
ing freedom from any imposed norms or standards,
autonomy loses its value As Sartre showed in
Being and Nothingness, freedom without
guidelines is a burden; it is the freedom of the travel
ler lost in the jungle without a map, who can move in
any direction he wishes but has no basis for choos
ing one direction rather than another. From the
psychological point of view, this kind of freedom
results either in existential despair or in a kind of
narcissism which, valuing only sensations and ple
asures of the moment, and fearing the restraint of
any firm commitments, ends by trivalizing the very
pleasures it claims to prize. l 2 It also serves to de
stroy community with others; cooperation among
individuals is impossible where there are no com
monly accepted standards of acceptable and unac
ceptable behavior, because nobody can count on
what others will do. And even the ideal of universal
brotherhood is weakened if it is taken to imply free
dom from any concrete responsibilities to any par
ticular human beings 13
In a society where catchwords tend to replace
critical inquiry, words like freedom' and autonomy
take on a life of their own and acquire a special
emotional force, as if they represented absolute
goods. If autonomy is valuable, we easily assume
that the more autonomy we have the better off we
are, and that a condition of unlimited autonomy must
be best of all But such is not the case Individual
freedom and autonomy are vitally important as in
strumental goods, but to convert them into absolute
goods is to destroy their function.
V
In the foregoing section we have argued that re
quirements, far from being an evil, are, in fact,
necessary for the purposes of a liberal education
Here we may be more specific about requirements
at Stanford.
The Stanford undergraduate curriculum currentty
includes two requirements One is that of the Major,
based on the pnnciple of study in depth This re
quirement was re-examined and reaffirmed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (Campus
Report, 130ct. 1976, p.B). The other is the recently
redefined Distnbution Requirement wtiich aims to
provide the breadth of study necessary for a liberal
eAjcation to yield "a richer personal life through the
development of spaciousness of mind and spirit
The Distribution Requirements exist to ensure ex
posure to different ideas and different ways of think
ing They should enable (one) to understand better
the major ways of knowing,' to assess their
strengths and limitations, to appreciate their un
iqueness, and no less importantly to discern what
they have in common" (DRAT, p 21).
Under the present system, work in the three re
quired areas entails the study of certain works of
creative imagination in their cultural and histoncal
contexts, or of certain problems of philosophy and
belief (Humanities); the study of society, social in
stitutions. and human behavior (Social Saences);
and the study of natural phenomena, technology,
and math (NS/M/T) The stress in each area is upon
approaches, scholarly methods, and the general
human significance of the vanous kinds of study In
addition, for each area, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommends development of
groups of correlated courses; in Humanities the
courses chosen to fulfil the requirement must form a
group which can be certified" by the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (directly approved by the Dean
if the group is chosen by a student, indirectly, if set
up by a department)
The pnnaple of breadth is thus fulfilled by requir

ing a certain amount of study in the three areas into
which human knowledge has been conveniently di
vided. Vet, within each area, a different principle of
order is invoked, and a broad, comprehensive out
look is neither required nor encouraged Moreover,
no principles are stated for the organization of cor re
lated groups or "sequences" within the areas. Nor
has advice been given to departments on the ways
in which they should, in practice, "group" their own
courses or correlate them with courses in other de
partments
In addition, students have not been advised about
the designing of a Humanities program which might
be acceptable to the Doan. Much of the "freedom"
prescribed by SES was predicated on the assump
tion that undergraduate advising, especially for un
declared majors (freshman and sophomore years),
would be vigorous and that the "strongly recom
mended" alternatives and choices would be made
under vigilant academic guidance. Unfortunately,
the faculty, as advisors, cannot peiform the neces
sary academic surveillance given the laissoz fain)
philosophy of the present system.
This loosely structured program may have some
merit in that it recognizes the validity of both syn
chronic and diachronic methods of study, however,
it is impractical and unwittingly misleading. A stu
dent can easily justify the coherence of a group of
three courses, on say, the liteiature, art and society
of fifth-century Athens, or that of a group embracing
the three story-tellers Homer, Dorothy Richardson
and Dostoyevsky, or even that of any three courses
taught by an individual professor.
Are these two requirements — Major and Dis
tribution — an adequate foundation for a liberal
education? We feel that they are not. The student
certainly needs the intellectual methods proper to
the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences which the Distribution Requirement is
supposed to provide. But a good liberal education
has to be more comprehensive. It must include
some systematic study of the fundamental nature
and development of the culture and civilization
within which the student is living and to which he will
someday contribute. It must also provide basic in
formation about the complexities of modern society,
the means to analyse and evaluate that society, and
the perspective necessary to judge it on a compara
tive basis. In addition, the student should have some
knowledge of a culture remote from his own — a
culture outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition, suc h
as Greek or Asian — which will confront him with
ideas that challenge his unconscious assumptions
about his own time and place.
Many who agree in principle with such educa
tional ideals feel that they cannot be achieved. We
disagree. This is a university rich in teaching re
sources which has demonstrated on other occa
sions an ability to make sensible and worthwhile
educational innovations when they have been
needed. They are needed now. Departments and
individual instructors are well-equipped to deal with
the task at hand, and we should certainly draw on
our excellent teaching resources.
The Report of the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford has
suggested certain specific ways in which, through a
program of "tracks," undergraduate education
could achieve the strength and the focus it lacks at
the moment. The Report also mentions the desira
bility of historical and comparative studies whereby
modern Western culture can be confr onted not only
with past stages of its development, but also with
manifestations of other cultures. The program en
visioned by the Report is based partly on existing
courses covering the Western tradition. This prog
ram would allow the student to choose among four
approaches — literature and language; history; re
ligion and philosophy, or the creative and perform
ing arts — all leading to the same goal. This ap
proach would give to each student an educational
program more coherent than the present one.
The appropriate authorities — the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, the Doan of Undar
graduate Studies, the Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (where most under
graduate teaching takes place) — must now de
velop a plan for providing, either through new
courses or through the adaptation of existing
courses, a method for satisfying the educational
needs we have outlined. Those authorities should
also consider how that plan, when in operation,
could be monitored effectively T he responsibility
our University has to its undergraduates and the
obligation it has to its reputation demands that such
action be taken promptly.
Having outlined our views in this general stato
ment, we intend to publish in the next few months a
series of position papers suggesting concrete im
provements to undergraduate education at Stan
ford.

For approximately one year, a group o
humanities faculty members, gathering together tc
discuss issues of mutual concern, has debated the
merits of the present structure of the undergraduate
curriculum at Stanford. Events both local and na
tional have encouraged this sustained debate. The
group has had, moreover, the opportunity to hear, al
its informal sessions, the opinions of some of the
' officers of the University who could be expected to
play key roles in the elaboration of the under
graduate curnculum in future years. Among these
officers have been the President, the Dean ol
Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Under
gracfcjate Studies, and the Dean of Admissions.
What herewith follows is not necessarily a reflec
tion of the attitudes of any one of these officers, nor
of any one faculty member Rather, the group as a
whole would now like to offer to the campus com
munity a statement bearing on the design of that
curnculum. The group recognizes that it possesses
neither final wisdom nor institutional authority in
matters such as these; it also recognizes that exten
sive planning remains to be done before revisions in
the curriculum can be addopted
The group speaks, however, with a sense ol
urgency. It is satisfied neither with the quality of the
intellectual life, nor with the goals and standards of
the undergraduate program. It believes, moreover,
that dissatisfaction, at times expressed and at other
times muted, is a sentiment shared by many faculty
members at Stanford. Nor is such a condition
merely local. Discussion within the group has been
enlivened in the past year by the clear recognition
that the problems Stanford now faces (and must
rigorously attempt to resolve) are problems affect
ing every prestigious institution of higher learning.
That the problems are national in their dimensions is
indicated by, among other things, the special
1974-75 issues of Daedalus (Journal of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences) wherein
eighty-four distinguished educators, including sev
eral from Stanford, speak to the conditions now
defining academic life. Differences among these
educators are certainly present, but all are
frightened, as the editor says, "by what they see as
a lack of concern for intellectual values, others worry
about what they think to be a reduced social con
sciousness." The perspective in which this deep
concern, on both the national level and the local
level, takes place is more serious, of course, than
the question of which course or courses must be
required of the undergraduate. It is more serious
than any particular detail. But details and particulars
will, at the appropriate moment, play their crucial
part when revisions in the curriculum are proposed
and then established. The editor of Daedalus de
scribes the newly emergent situation not as "a re
petition of the discussion that occurred in the middle
of the nineteenth century when a rigid, classically
oriented college curriculum was challenged by the
new theoretical and applied sciences. Much more is
at stake today; the continued viability of the concept
of the liberally-educated person is involved."
About the continued viability the Stanford com
munity has the deepest obligation to be concerned.
In the immediate past, that concern has been ex
pressed by the Report of the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stan
ford. The spirit of that Report, in which a clear com
mitment to a requirement in Western Culture is af
firmed, must be sustained and nourished. Hence
the informal Humanities and Sciences group is
happy to note that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has recently, and unanimously, also en
dorsed "the principle that studies in Western Culture
should be part of each student's education."
Discussions within the group have also been in
vigorated by the understanding that the problems
Stanford now faces are not purely national but are
Stanford's own This university must fulfill the spe
cial obligations it has as a private institution, of great
prestige, within a state and a geography dominated
by non-private institutions Its mission has been,
and is, special; so can be the quality of its under
graduate education. To this obligation President
Richard W. Lyman has often spoken, and most tel
lingly speaks in the pages of Daedalus, where he
says
We who are responsible for the continuing
health of our "little platoons" — and even
the greatest of the private universities are
"little platoons" when matched against the
dimensions of state-supported higher edu
cation — we have our work cut out for us...
one virture that ought to be within the reach
of independent institutions, be they old or
new, famous or obscure, is that of rigorous
self-definition.
It is to that rigor arte 1 that self-definition that Stan
ford's attention must now turn Prompted, then, by
both the national anxiety and concern, and opposed
to the idle, helpless notion that little can be done in
the face of curricular and intellectual complexity, this
statement is offered to the Stanford community It is
hoped that it will play some effective part in discus
sions within the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
and the Academic Senate.
The pnnciples underlying the 1968 Study of Edu
cation at Stanford are treated here first. That Study
predates the Report of the Committee on the Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
and by virtue of the seriousness and thoughtfulness
with which it was undertaken, has achieved a con
siderable weight in later discussions of curricular
reform But as the Study itself observes, its spirit
was one of "self-examination and self-renewal." It
further observes that "the study of education must
become a process rather than event." Eight years
have since passed: changes now seem wholly
proper and necessary In the light, then, of such
changes to be made, a second matter for discussion
follows the first It is a consideration of the newly
formulated system of distnbution requirements. Al
though that system is the product of much labor on
the part of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, it does not coherently and directly address
the fundamental inadequacies of the present cur
ncular program for the undergraduate student, it is a
system that is too diffuse and too loosely monitored
to be able to do so Only by a program that is more
coherently structured can the mtellecuual life of the
Stanford student be made more challenging, in
tense, and rewarding
II
The basic philosophy of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). published in 1968-69, was that of
educational laissez fairs This is reflected in two
parallel pronouncements, the first of which ap
peared in the general introductory section of the
report and the second in the section on under
graduate education
"Let fie objectrve of curncular planning be
to encourage the faculty member to teach
what he likes to teach and the student to
learn what seems vital to him — the Intellec
tual History of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century rather than the History of Western
Civilization Modern Consciousness rather
than Freshman English. Organizational Be
havior rather than Introduction to Sociology
— and from this common freedom may
emerge a form of general education far bet
ter suited to the cftaractennbcs of a umver
slty than that to which we pay lip service

now." (Vol. I, p. 14)
And again:
"The objective toward which curriculum
planning should strive is, to the extent pos
sible, to let the teacher teach what he wants
to teach and the student learn what he
wants to learn." (Vol. II, p. 12)
Now philosophies of laissez faire can be arrived at
in different ways and supported or defended on
different grounds. Having in mind Isaiah Berlin's
significant distinction between positive and negative
conceptions of freedom — possitive freedom being
freedom for the achievement of some end deemed
desirable, negative freedom being freedom from
restraint on the assumption that restraint is wrong in
itself 1 — we can roughly distinguish between posi
tive and negative philosophies of laissez faire.
Adam Smith's views concerning economic be
havior were positive in this sense, not because they
were necessarily correct, but because they were
based on extensive inquiries into the nature of
wealth, the nature of human motivation and be
havior, and a clear belief in the desirability of the
conditions to which he thought a free market
economy would contribute. One may, of course,
quarrel with his views, but the fact remains that he
had a carefully worked out theory of social welfare
and advocated free enterprise as the best means of
achieving it. It is not inconceivable that a positive
doctrine of educational laissez faire might be simi
larly grounded on some carefully worked out and
coherent theory of the objectives, functions, and
social impact of higher education. But SES failed to
provide any such theory Instead it provided a nega
tive philosophy of laissez faire based on the view
that in higher education, restraints of any kind are
inherently bad. Moreover, this view was itself based
on a curiously narrow and dubious line of argument
which calls for special attention and comment.
The SES committee took the position that it ought
to base its "proposed reponses to the problems of
education at Stanford on careful consideration of
the meaning of education for individual teacher and
student and of the nature of the university" (Vol. I, p.
8). So far, so good. But it then proceeded to deal
with these questions, not by considering the general
objectives, functions and possible impact of higher
education in and on today's society, nor by consider
ing the important "new dimensions" which it had
cited in the opening sentence of its report as having
been introduced by the student unrest of the 1960's.
Instead, the Committee attempted to deal with all
these questions by the simple expedient of examin
ing the etymology of the single world, education '
The Committee established its "basic premises" i

as follows:
To establish our basic premises we must
begin with our conceptions of education and
of a university. The world 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educere meaning to
lead forth.' To lead does not mean to com
pel, or to push, or to pull. It means quite
simply what it says.. (1,10)
On this foundation it was immediately concluded
(among other things) that education "can never be
compelled nor can knowledge be impressed on a
mind unwilling to learn if it is to be more than indoc
trination'' (I, 10). It was also inferred (without any
corresponding concern for the etymology of the
word "university") that "the University can nevei
educate in the true sense of the word, but it can
supply the environment and the means necessary
to insure that those who came here may educate
each other and themselves'' (I, 10). In short, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, the weight of the
whole report seems to have rested upon the pre
sumed etymology of the word educate.'
The deficiences of this approach are obvious:
1 Words change their meanings. Hence even i
this particular etymology were adequately stated, i
could give no more than a tentative and partial hin
as to the present meaning of the word "education."
2. Given a complex enterprise like that of moderr
education, many different words are involved. If we
are to rely on etymology, we ought surely to con
sider also the etymologies of a variety of other En
glish words which are relevant to education, such as
learning, training, study, scholarship, instruction,
teaching, tutoring, lecturing, research, etc. These
would yield different results, reflecting the simple
fact that education has many facets, and dimen
sions, which cannot be captured by looking at any
simplified etymology of any single word.
3. On the Latin side, we should note first that in
addition to the verb educere (3rd conjugation) on
which the SES committee chose to rely, there was
another related Latin verb, educare (Ist conjuga
tion) meaning 'to train, to rear, to bring up ' It is from
the latter (and its nouneducatfo) that our word edu
cation' is most immediately derived. Secondly, the
Romans had several other verbs which they applied
to the process of education, including instituere,
instruere, and erudire. None of these suggests to
lead forth ; the first two suggested the idea of estab
lishing,' constructing' or setting in order, while the
last implied making smooth.'
Thus the committee's central line of argument —
the first among its "basic premises" — must be
rejected as wholly misconceived This fact does not,
of course, necessarily refute the laissez faire
philosophy which the committee derived from it; as
previously observed, that philosophy might con
ceivably be supported on other grounds. However,
since no other basis was supplied, the committee's
general conclusion stands unsupported. We are left
with, at best, a negative theory of laissez faire — a
theory which might as well have been adopted out of
sheer inertia or even from an impulse to deflate
student po'itical demands by making educational
concessions 2 On this view, educational restraints
are wrong primarily because they are burdensome
and because they are disliked. Eliminating require
ments is good because freedom is good, in and of
itself If teachers are free to teach what they want to
teach and students are free to learn what they want
to leam, we may trust that everybody will benefit and
that the proper interests of society will be served
111
The question now is whether that trust has been
vindicated or discredited The indications are
mounting that it has been discredited — that the kind
of educational laissez faire recommended by the
SES report has already been found seriously defi
cient Several emerging difficulties call for particular
attention.
1 The problem of standards
Derek Bok, President of Harvard University (and
a Stanford alumnus) began a recent article "On the
Purposes of Undergraduate Education' (Daedalus.
Fall, 1974, pp 159-172) as follows
"Scholars who study the behavior of
human organizations constantly stress the
importance of defining institutional goals
Without dear objectives, it is said, an mstitu
tion cannot evaluate how well it is perform
ing, decide how to allocate its resources
wisely, plan for future growth, motivate its
members, or justify its existence to the
larger public
"Despite these admonitions, our colleges
seem to exist without making much of an
effort to define their aims In the thick reports
on undergraduate education that many col
leges have produced in recent years, there
is little discuMion of what it is that a liberal
arts education should provide for me stu-

dent. The prevailing sentiment is captured
by the statement of a curriculum committee
in one of our most distinguished univer
sities: The objective toward which cur
riculum planning should strive is, to the ex
tent possible, to let the teacher teach what
he wants to teach and the student learn
t what he wants to learn.' "
It should be noted lhat the concluding sentence,
cited as exemplifying a prevalent defiaency, is bor
rowed from the SES report; it is the second of the
two excerpts quoted at the beginning of this paper
Bok's point is that the SES philosophy of laissez
faire provides no standards for directing or evaluat
ing any aspect of the academic enterprise, or judg
ing academic performance. If the controlling objec
tive is to allow teachers and students to do whatever
they prefer, why should the university not provide
instruction in basketweaving? If it be replied that
accepted standards of academic excellence and
competence are assumed, the question arises
where such standards originate and how they are
maintained. To the extent that they are needed, the
laissez faire philosophy is thereby shown to be in
adequate
It is one thing to maintain that teachers should
enjoy teaching and that students should enjoy learn
ing, but it is something else to say that immediate
enjoyment — which can vary according to the fash
ions of the day — is to be taken as the primary
measure of academic success. It is perhaps worth
remarking that while the SES report relied on Alfred
North Whitehead's observation that the University's
justification is to preserve "the connection between
knowledge and the zest of life, by uniting the young
and the old in the imaginative consideration of learn
ing" (SES, I, 10) it failed to note that in the same
essay (as well as elsewhere in his writings on edu
cation) Whitehead stressed the need for a "discip
line of imagination" so that the superior vigor of the
young should be tempered by the superior experi
ence of the elders. The persistent problem of educa
tion, in Whitehead's view, is to combine discipline
and imagination so that neither destroys the other.
In his words, "qualities essential at a later stage of a
career are apt to be stamped out in an earlier stage
This is only an instance of the more general fact, that
technical excellence can only be acquired by a train
ing which is apt to damage those energies of mind
which should direct the technical skill. This is the key
fact in education, and the reason for most of its
difficulties." 3
2. Problems of specialization and vocationalism
The Harvard report of 1945, General Education in
a Free Society, probably the most widely influential t
report on higher issued in the decadea
immediate following World War II, devoted most of
its attention to a discussion of the purposes and
functions of education in a free society, "It is fruit
less," the Harvard committee wrote, "to think about
any such practical step as a curriculum without hav
ing in mind specifications or points of reference, in
this case the ends toward which the curriculum
should look and the students for whom it is in
tended." 4
The main problems of education were there attri
buted to three sources: first, the progressive expan
sion of knowledge with the attendant multiplication
of specialisms and sub-specialisms in all areas;
second, the great increase in the number of college
students as opportunities for education beyond the
high-school were extended from the privileged few
and made available to young people at large; and
third, to the increasing complexity of modern society
itself. To cope with these problems, the Harvard
committee felt that education at the college level
ought to perform a dual role. It must, on the one
hand, fully recognize the need for increasing
specialization and provide a foundation for students
going on to careers or vocations requiring particular
skills in diverse areas. But it must at the same time
seek to balance the fragmentation and atomization
threatened by the multiplication of specialties by
finding some unifying dimension or dimensions. It
was concluded that the latter function required re
newed stress on the sort of education that had been
traditionally called "liberal education," specifically
the kind of education designed to develop the
natural capacities of the student as a human being
regardless of the particular social role which he or
she might subsequently fill. "Our conclusion, then,"
wrote the Harvard committee in 1945," is that the
aim of education should be to prepare an individual
to become an expert both in some particular voca
tion or art and in the general art of the free man and
the citizen. Thus the two kinds of education once
given separately to different social classes must be
given to all alike." 5
These views are cited not to suggest that the
curricular innovations recommended by the Har
vard committee in 1945 accomplished their purpose
(which is open to serious debate) but to show that
the committee identified — and tried to meet —
three problems which became more and more pres
sing in the ensuing years Among these, the con
tinued multiplication of specialisms with spreading
emphasis on the importance to the student of de
veloping marketable skills, at a high level of sophis
tication, has proved perhaps the most intractable
One way to deal with this problem is, of course, to do
nothing — to drift with the prevailing current rather
than attempt to swim against it. The SES report, with
its philosophy of laissez faire, does exactly that
Since increasing specialism is the order of the day.
and since competent scholars are specialists, it can
be claimed, "realism" dictates that we accept that
fact, adapting our education to it and letting
threatened dangers take care of themselves But
some of those threatened dangers have already
become actual.

(i) As the opinion spreads that the main function of
higher education is to develop in the student mar
ketable skills — what Steven Miller, President of
Johns Hopkins, calls "higher skilling" as opposed to
higher education 8 — for a job market which is al
ready oversaturated, the value of a college educa
tion is necessanly depreciated. If it were recog
nized, however, that the chief function of a college
education is to develop the human potential of the
student without regard to the particular job he or she
might eventually hold or the particular social role he
or she might occupy, the result would be otherwise
Success or failure in the job market would not be
considered so crucial There is here an illustration of
the point made before, that the objectives (or sup
posed objectives) of education always provide the
criteria for evaluating success or failure
(ii) In regard to the nature and status if knowledge,
Steven Muller, in the article just mentioned, asked
the pregnant question If all our scholars are stand
ing at the frontiers of knowledge, who is standing at
the center? Is there today any center? If not, how
can there be any community of scholars in the tradi
tional sense?
Under present conditions, there is no genuine
community of teachers or students in any college or
university, but rather an aggregate of specialists
and students, each pursuing his or her own sepa
rate interests in geographical proximity, with little or
no basis for cross-disciplinary communication or
understanding One consequence is that most scho
lars feel more affinity with, and more respect for,
their professional colleagues in other universities
than for members of other departments in their own
And there is no longer any unity of knowledge, but
only a collocation of separate knowledges Such a
situation may. perhaps, be defended certainly it is
preferable to an ideological uniformity arbitrarily im
posed But surety there is a middle ground between

these extremes. Muller considers that some return
to general education, with universal requirements
for English, for a second language, for cultural his
tory, and for science, is necessary to restore the
un 'ty of genuine education.
What all our scholars in different disciplines have
in common is that they are all human beings, that
they all share the same cultural inheritance, and that
they are all engaged (or should be) in the same
quest — the quest for greater knowledge and wider
understanding. And we do well, we believe, to recall
the observation of Arthur Lovejoy that he who knows
only his own special field may not know what is most
worth looking lor in his special field. 7
#ii) An extensive investigation recently conducted
byktwo ecfcjcation reporters of the Los Angeles
Tunes into the concurrent phenomena of progres
sive grade inflation along with progressive decline in
the average level of students' proficiency has been
the widespread substitution of new elective
oourses, sometimes lacking in academic rigor, for
the kind of basic courses which used to be required
for all students. 8 Though the demonstration is not
conclusive, it is at least persuasively documented
As against suggestions that the decline in test
scores is due to other causes — such as altered
family structures, the increased number of less qual
ified students, regional factors, or the unreliability of
test scores — the authors of the report point out that
the two areas where test scores have not declined
but held steady or advanced are the areas in which
basic requirements have been largely retained, i.e.,
in the first three primary grades in school and in the
sciences at post-secondary level. These investiga
tions, which are too long to summanze, are worth
senous attention. At least, they cannot be ignored,
despite the attempts of some educators to dismiss
or discount them.
(iv) There is clear evidence that college students
today resent the increasingly competitive atmos
phere of post-secondary education. 9 It seems to be
a fair inference that the competitive aspect reflects
the increasing emphasis in higher education upon
the development of marketable skills. When stu
dents are competing for entrance to professional
schools or for jobs requiring technical proficiency,
and when good grades are seen as important for
Stich purposes, the process of college education
naturally comes to be seen as a struggle of each
against all; for admission to a limited number of
'ftllure positions. But liberal education, in the tradi
tional sense, has a different character. The
philosopher Spinoza pointed out that intellectual
goods sought for their own sake are non-
C9mpetitive. If one person achieves wisdom or in
creased insight, he is not threatened but reinforced
if his neighbors do likewise. Here is one major dif
ference between virtues of character and technical
skills, at least where the latter determine job oppor
tunities. Nothing is so useful or agreeable to the
virtuous man, Spinoza wrote, as the company of
others who are like-minded. Where self-realization
or self-improvement is the aim rather than voca
tional proficiency — as is the case with liberal edu
cation — emulation can be a spur without being a
threat. And the community of scholars, for teachers
and students alike, rests upon such a foundation
Thef search for "higher skilling" is centrifugal; the
search for liberal education is centripetal. A student
whose aim is self-development or self-improvement
as a human being values grades only as indications
of his own progress, not for any advantage they may
give over others.

(v) As our society becomes increasingly complex,
as specialisms multiply, and as it becomes increas
ingly apparent that the most serious problems ex
tend over many diciplines, it follows, as Professor
Gabriel Almond has observed, that "only higher
order philosophical syntheses can spell out the big
issues and formulate alternative solutions." 10 At the
same time, our society is becoming more and more
susceptible at all levels to the pull of simplistic slo
gans, catchwords, images, stereotypes and
counter-stereotypes. In this situation the need for
critical intelligence and balanced judgment is be
coming more and more acute, yet this need is not
likely to be apparent to the beginning student, par
ticularly if he is bent on acquiring some particular
skill. The SES report quoted approvingly an obser
vation of Professor Edwin M. Good to the effect that
the important simplicities are those which lie "on the
other side of complexity" (Vol. I, p. 11). Surely the
proper inference is that today's student, seeking tp
pick his way through the growing thicket of com
plexities towards some thoughtful and balanced
overview — as opposed to the delusive simplicities
offered by catchwords and fashionable stereotypes
— needs more guidance and direction than ever
before. The claim of the SES committee that today's
student is in a better position than anybody else to
choose the academic path he will take (Vol. I. p. 15)
seems like saying that the thicker the forest be
comes, the less need there is to require would-be
travellers to take a guide.
IV
Recommendations for achieving the aims of lib
eral education generally envisage imposed re
quirements covenng, in addition to courses in En
glish and in a foreign language, a required course or
courses in Western culture or the history of ideas
We are not concerned here with particular prog
rams, but with the sort of objections most commonly
raised against imposing such requirements.
1. It is often claimed that a required course in
Western culture or the history of ideas in the West is
chauvinistic, since it implies the superiority of the
Western tradition above other traditions The objec
tion is misconceived The purpose of studying the
Western tradition is not to celebrate it but to under
stand It — for good or ill. To evaluate Western
culture, or any other culture, without first making the
effort to understand it is to judge irrationally without
adequate evidence Many people make this very
mistake, but the fact that the mistake is common
affords a good reason for trying to correct it.
2. It is often claimed that requiring students to
study any particular subject is arbitrary because no
particular subject is intrinsically more important than
any other One might, so the argument goes, make
as good a case for general requirement in, say,
psychology or the scientific study of human be
havior The answer here is that all heirs of the West
ern tradition — whether specialists or generalists,
students or faculty, regardless of their special in
terests and capacities — are themselves con
ditioned by Western culture The same is true of all
the specialized disciplines which have developed in
the West they all reflect distinctively Western con
ceptions of rationality and the role of systematic
inquiry '' (Xir heritage affects our preconceptions
about the nature and function of scientific know
ledge as well as our preconceptions about values
and norms It is not too much to say that no person
can hope to understand who he or she is without
some understanding of the cultural context, handed
down from prior generations, in which he or she
presently exists Nobody lives, thinks, or talks in a
cultural void Nobody is exempt from cultural influ
ences Hence the peculiar importance of a general
requirement that students systematically examine
the cultural background which they all share
3 It is sometimes objected that a cultural re
quirement would put a premium on conformity to
accepted values We would suggest that the oppo
site is true The dangerous conformities are those
which are blind, unconscious, and uncritical Most
cultures breed rebels as well as conformists, as our

culture has. If a required course in Western culture
is designed (as above noted) to promote the accu
rate understanding of the Western orientation, the
result should be to make both rebels and confor
mists more dearly aware of what it is that they are
rejecting or accepting.
4. It has been objected that there is no reliable
evidence by which we can evaluate the effective
ness of general courses of the kind here envisaged;
hence they should not be required. We grant the
premise but reject the conclusion. The difficulty of
evaluation arises principally, we think, from the fact
that a good educational program has, or should
have, a long-term impact upon the student, and
such impacts are not precisely identifiable or quanti
fiable. To insist too much on precise evaluations
tends to put the emphasis on those short-term be
nefits and immediate satisfaction which can be as
certained, at the expense of the lasting benefits
which can be recognized, if at all, only in retrospect.
However this may be, the present objection cuts
both ways. If we cannot measure in advance the
precise effectiveness of a proposed requirement,
we cannot measure the relative effectiveness of a
program from which such requirements are omitted.
5. It has been claimed that students cannot be
made to learn what they do not wish to learn, or, as
last year s Council of ASSU Presidents put it, "You
can lead a student to a class but you can't make one
think." This position calls for clarification, because it
is highly ambiguous.
Much of what we learn from everyday experience
is not chosen, but forced upon us, often against our
wills, like learning that hot stoves can burn or that
careless driving invites serious accidents. With re
gard to required courses, the evidence is that many
generations of Stanford graduates found value in,
and claim to have profited from, the old course in
Western Civilization despite its having been pre
scribed. Many required courses in other colleges
and universities seem to have had substantial suc
cess. It is evident that the present objection is over
stated.
Perhaps we should interpret it to mean that stu
dents learn better when they study subjects which
they enjoy. There is some truth in this, but there is
also room for a serious confusion. One may enjoy
the process of studying a subject without liking or
approving the subject under study. A medical stu
dent, for example, does not normally enjoy or ap
prove of diseases A student of criminal behavior
does not normally enjoy or approve of crime. Such
students take satisfaction in learning how to cope
with the problems created by disease and crime. So
also a student of Western culture need not like or
approve of Western culture as such in order to find
satisfaction in making a study of it. If this distinction
is kept in mind, a further point emerges, namely, that
nobody can judge whether studying a given subject
will yield satisfaction or prove valuable to him until
after he has engaged in it. Students who view all
required courses as an infringement upon their
freedom of choice sometimes forget that freedom to
make informed choices is not the same as freedom
to make uninformed choices.
It used to be taken lor granted that if students
came to college, it was because they wished to be
made to think, this being accepted as an essential
part of a college education. The present argument,
however, introduces a distinction, as if students
were now saying: "Please give us an education, but
don't make us Slink — or at least, don't make us
think any more than we like or about topics we don't
like." Such a position, if taken seriously, would make
disciplined thinking peripheral rather than central to
the educational process, since disciplined thinking
is usually laborious and the habit of disciplined think
ing can only be acquired, like other skills, by sus
tained practice and fatiguing application.
Finally, it should be noted that when autonomy is
equated with negative freedom in Berlin's sense —
that is to say with freedom from restraints — and
when freedom from restraints is conceived as imply
ing freedom from any imposed norms or standards,
autonomy loses its value As Sartre showed in
Being and Nothingness, freedom without
guidelines is a burden; it is the freedom of the travel
ler lost in the jungle without a map, who can move in
any direction he wishes but has no basis for choos
ing one direction rather than another. From the
psychological point of view, this kind of freedom
results either in existential despair or in a kind of
narcissism which, valuing only sensations and ple
asures of the moment, and fearing the restraint of
any firm commitments, ends by trivalizing the very
pleasures it claims to prize. l 2 It also serves to de
stroy community with others; cooperation among
individuals is impossible where there are no com
monly accepted standards of acceptable and unac
ceptable behavior, because nobody can count on
what others will do. And even the ideal of universal
brotherhood is weakened if it is taken to imply free
dom from any concrete responsibilities to any par
ticular human beings 13
In a society where catchwords tend to replace
critical inquiry, words like freedom' and autonomy
take on a life of their own and acquire a special
emotional force, as if they represented absolute
goods. If autonomy is valuable, we easily assume
that the more autonomy we have the better off we
are, and that a condition of unlimited autonomy must
be best of all But such is not the case Individual
freedom and autonomy are vitally important as in
strumental goods, but to convert them into absolute
goods is to destroy their function.
V
In the foregoing section we have argued that re
quirements, far from being an evil, are, in fact,
necessary for the purposes of a liberal education
Here we may be more specific about requirements
at Stanford.
The Stanford undergraduate curriculum currentty
includes two requirements One is that of the Major,
based on the pnnciple of study in depth This re
quirement was re-examined and reaffirmed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (Campus
Report, 130ct. 1976, p.B). The other is the recently
redefined Distnbution Requirement wtiich aims to
provide the breadth of study necessary for a liberal
eAjcation to yield "a richer personal life through the
development of spaciousness of mind and spirit
The Distribution Requirements exist to ensure ex
posure to different ideas and different ways of think
ing They should enable (one) to understand better
the major ways of knowing,' to assess their
strengths and limitations, to appreciate their un
iqueness, and no less importantly to discern what
they have in common" (DRAT, p 21).
Under the present system, work in the three re
quired areas entails the study of certain works of
creative imagination in their cultural and histoncal
contexts, or of certain problems of philosophy and
belief (Humanities); the study of society, social in
stitutions. and human behavior (Social Saences);
and the study of natural phenomena, technology,
and math (NS/M/T) The stress in each area is upon
approaches, scholarly methods, and the general
human significance of the vanous kinds of study In
addition, for each area, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommends development of
groups of correlated courses; in Humanities the
courses chosen to fulfil the requirement must form a
group which can be certified" by the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (directly approved by the Dean
if the group is chosen by a student, indirectly, if set
up by a department)
The pnnaple of breadth is thus fulfilled by requir

ing a certain amount of study in the three areas into
which human knowledge has been conveniently di
vided. Vet, within each area, a different principle of
order is invoked, and a broad, comprehensive out
look is neither required nor encouraged Moreover,
no principles are stated for the organization of cor re
lated groups or "sequences" within the areas. Nor
has advice been given to departments on the ways
in which they should, in practice, "group" their own
courses or correlate them with courses in other de
partments
In addition, students have not been advised about
the designing of a Humanities program which might
be acceptable to the Doan. Much of the "freedom"
prescribed by SES was predicated on the assump
tion that undergraduate advising, especially for un
declared majors (freshman and sophomore years),
would be vigorous and that the "strongly recom
mended" alternatives and choices would be made
under vigilant academic guidance. Unfortunately,
the faculty, as advisors, cannot peiform the neces
sary academic surveillance given the laissoz fain)
philosophy of the present system.
This loosely structured program may have some
merit in that it recognizes the validity of both syn
chronic and diachronic methods of study, however,
it is impractical and unwittingly misleading. A stu
dent can easily justify the coherence of a group of
three courses, on say, the liteiature, art and society
of fifth-century Athens, or that of a group embracing
the three story-tellers Homer, Dorothy Richardson
and Dostoyevsky, or even that of any three courses
taught by an individual professor.
Are these two requirements — Major and Dis
tribution — an adequate foundation for a liberal
education? We feel that they are not. The student
certainly needs the intellectual methods proper to
the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences which the Distribution Requirement is
supposed to provide. But a good liberal education
has to be more comprehensive. It must include
some systematic study of the fundamental nature
and development of the culture and civilization
within which the student is living and to which he will
someday contribute. It must also provide basic in
formation about the complexities of modern society,
the means to analyse and evaluate that society, and
the perspective necessary to judge it on a compara
tive basis. In addition, the student should have some
knowledge of a culture remote from his own — a
culture outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition, suc h
as Greek or Asian — which will confront him with
ideas that challenge his unconscious assumptions
about his own time and place.
Many who agree in principle with such educa
tional ideals feel that they cannot be achieved. We
disagree. This is a university rich in teaching re
sources which has demonstrated on other occa
sions an ability to make sensible and worthwhile
educational innovations when they have been
needed. They are needed now. Departments and
individual instructors are well-equipped to deal with
the task at hand, and we should certainly draw on
our excellent teaching resources.
The Report of the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford has
suggested certain specific ways in which, through a
program of "tracks," undergraduate education
could achieve the strength and the focus it lacks at
the moment. The Report also mentions the desira
bility of historical and comparative studies whereby
modern Western culture can be confr onted not only
with past stages of its development, but also with
manifestations of other cultures. The program en
visioned by the Report is based partly on existing
courses covering the Western tradition. This prog
ram would allow the student to choose among four
approaches — literature and language; history; re
ligion and philosophy, or the creative and perform
ing arts — all leading to the same goal. This ap
proach would give to each student an educational
program more coherent than the present one.
The appropriate authorities — the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, the Doan of Undar
graduate Studies, the Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (where most under
graduate teaching takes place) — must now de
velop a plan for providing, either through new
courses or through the adaptation of existing
courses, a method for satisfying the educational
needs we have outlined. Those authorities should
also consider how that plan, when in operation,
could be monitored effectively T he responsibility
our University has to its undergraduates and the
obligation it has to its reputation demands that such
action be taken promptly.
Having outlined our views in this general stato
ment, we intend to publish in the next few months a
series of position papers suggesting concrete im
provements to undergraduate education at Stan
ford.

For approximately one year, a group o
humanities faculty members, gathering together tc
discuss issues of mutual concern, has debated the
merits of the present structure of the undergraduate
curriculum at Stanford. Events both local and na
tional have encouraged this sustained debate. The
group has had, moreover, the opportunity to hear, al
its informal sessions, the opinions of some of the
' officers of the University who could be expected to
play key roles in the elaboration of the under
graduate curnculum in future years. Among these
officers have been the President, the Dean ol
Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Under
gracfcjate Studies, and the Dean of Admissions.
What herewith follows is not necessarily a reflec
tion of the attitudes of any one of these officers, nor
of any one faculty member Rather, the group as a
whole would now like to offer to the campus com
munity a statement bearing on the design of that
curnculum. The group recognizes that it possesses
neither final wisdom nor institutional authority in
matters such as these; it also recognizes that exten
sive planning remains to be done before revisions in
the curriculum can be addopted
The group speaks, however, with a sense ol
urgency. It is satisfied neither with the quality of the
intellectual life, nor with the goals and standards of
the undergraduate program. It believes, moreover,
that dissatisfaction, at times expressed and at other
times muted, is a sentiment shared by many faculty
members at Stanford. Nor is such a condition
merely local. Discussion within the group has been
enlivened in the past year by the clear recognition
that the problems Stanford now faces (and must
rigorously attempt to resolve) are problems affect
ing every prestigious institution of higher learning.
That the problems are national in their dimensions is
indicated by, among other things, the special
1974-75 issues of Daedalus (Journal of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences) wherein
eighty-four distinguished educators, including sev
eral from Stanford, speak to the conditions now
defining academic life. Differences among these
educators are certainly present, but all are
frightened, as the editor says, "by what they see as
a lack of concern for intellectual values, others worry
about what they think to be a reduced social con
sciousness." The perspective in which this deep
concern, on both the national level and the local
level, takes place is more serious, of course, than
the question of which course or courses must be
required of the undergraduate. It is more serious
than any particular detail. But details and particulars
will, at the appropriate moment, play their crucial
part when revisions in the curriculum are proposed
and then established. The editor of Daedalus de
scribes the newly emergent situation not as "a re
petition of the discussion that occurred in the middle
of the nineteenth century when a rigid, classically
oriented college curriculum was challenged by the
new theoretical and applied sciences. Much more is
at stake today; the continued viability of the concept
of the liberally-educated person is involved."
About the continued viability the Stanford com
munity has the deepest obligation to be concerned.
In the immediate past, that concern has been ex
pressed by the Report of the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stan
ford. The spirit of that Report, in which a clear com
mitment to a requirement in Western Culture is af
firmed, must be sustained and nourished. Hence
the informal Humanities and Sciences group is
happy to note that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has recently, and unanimously, also en
dorsed "the principle that studies in Western Culture
should be part of each student's education."
Discussions within the group have also been in
vigorated by the understanding that the problems
Stanford now faces are not purely national but are
Stanford's own This university must fulfill the spe
cial obligations it has as a private institution, of great
prestige, within a state and a geography dominated
by non-private institutions Its mission has been,
and is, special; so can be the quality of its under
graduate education. To this obligation President
Richard W. Lyman has often spoken, and most tel
lingly speaks in the pages of Daedalus, where he
says
We who are responsible for the continuing
health of our "little platoons" — and even
the greatest of the private universities are
"little platoons" when matched against the
dimensions of state-supported higher edu
cation — we have our work cut out for us...
one virture that ought to be within the reach
of independent institutions, be they old or
new, famous or obscure, is that of rigorous
self-definition.
It is to that rigor arte 1 that self-definition that Stan
ford's attention must now turn Prompted, then, by
both the national anxiety and concern, and opposed
to the idle, helpless notion that little can be done in
the face of curricular and intellectual complexity, this
statement is offered to the Stanford community It is
hoped that it will play some effective part in discus
sions within the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
and the Academic Senate.
The pnnciples underlying the 1968 Study of Edu
cation at Stanford are treated here first. That Study
predates the Report of the Committee on the Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
and by virtue of the seriousness and thoughtfulness
with which it was undertaken, has achieved a con
siderable weight in later discussions of curricular
reform But as the Study itself observes, its spirit
was one of "self-examination and self-renewal." It
further observes that "the study of education must
become a process rather than event." Eight years
have since passed: changes now seem wholly
proper and necessary In the light, then, of such
changes to be made, a second matter for discussion
follows the first It is a consideration of the newly
formulated system of distnbution requirements. Al
though that system is the product of much labor on
the part of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, it does not coherently and directly address
the fundamental inadequacies of the present cur
ncular program for the undergraduate student, it is a
system that is too diffuse and too loosely monitored
to be able to do so Only by a program that is more
coherently structured can the mtellecuual life of the
Stanford student be made more challenging, in
tense, and rewarding
II
The basic philosophy of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). published in 1968-69, was that of
educational laissez fairs This is reflected in two
parallel pronouncements, the first of which ap
peared in the general introductory section of the
report and the second in the section on under
graduate education
"Let fie objectrve of curncular planning be
to encourage the faculty member to teach
what he likes to teach and the student to
learn what seems vital to him — the Intellec
tual History of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century rather than the History of Western
Civilization Modern Consciousness rather
than Freshman English. Organizational Be
havior rather than Introduction to Sociology
— and from this common freedom may
emerge a form of general education far bet
ter suited to the cftaractennbcs of a umver
slty than that to which we pay lip service

now." (Vol. I, p. 14)
And again:
"The objective toward which curriculum
planning should strive is, to the extent pos
sible, to let the teacher teach what he wants
to teach and the student learn what he
wants to learn." (Vol. II, p. 12)
Now philosophies of laissez faire can be arrived at
in different ways and supported or defended on
different grounds. Having in mind Isaiah Berlin's
significant distinction between positive and negative
conceptions of freedom — possitive freedom being
freedom for the achievement of some end deemed
desirable, negative freedom being freedom from
restraint on the assumption that restraint is wrong in
itself 1 — we can roughly distinguish between posi
tive and negative philosophies of laissez faire.
Adam Smith's views concerning economic be
havior were positive in this sense, not because they
were necessarily correct, but because they were
based on extensive inquiries into the nature of
wealth, the nature of human motivation and be
havior, and a clear belief in the desirability of the
conditions to which he thought a free market
economy would contribute. One may, of course,
quarrel with his views, but the fact remains that he
had a carefully worked out theory of social welfare
and advocated free enterprise as the best means of
achieving it. It is not inconceivable that a positive
doctrine of educational laissez faire might be simi
larly grounded on some carefully worked out and
coherent theory of the objectives, functions, and
social impact of higher education. But SES failed to
provide any such theory Instead it provided a nega
tive philosophy of laissez faire based on the view
that in higher education, restraints of any kind are
inherently bad. Moreover, this view was itself based
on a curiously narrow and dubious line of argument
which calls for special attention and comment.
The SES committee took the position that it ought
to base its "proposed reponses to the problems of
education at Stanford on careful consideration of
the meaning of education for individual teacher and
student and of the nature of the university" (Vol. I, p.
8). So far, so good. But it then proceeded to deal
with these questions, not by considering the general
objectives, functions and possible impact of higher
education in and on today's society, nor by consider
ing the important "new dimensions" which it had
cited in the opening sentence of its report as having
been introduced by the student unrest of the 1960's.
Instead, the Committee attempted to deal with all
these questions by the simple expedient of examin
ing the etymology of the single world, education '
The Committee established its "basic premises" i

as follows:
To establish our basic premises we must
begin with our conceptions of education and
of a university. The world 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educere meaning to
lead forth.' To lead does not mean to com
pel, or to push, or to pull. It means quite
simply what it says.. (1,10)
On this foundation it was immediately concluded
(among other things) that education "can never be
compelled nor can knowledge be impressed on a
mind unwilling to learn if it is to be more than indoc
trination'' (I, 10). It was also inferred (without any
corresponding concern for the etymology of the
word "university") that "the University can nevei
educate in the true sense of the word, but it can
supply the environment and the means necessary
to insure that those who came here may educate
each other and themselves'' (I, 10). In short, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, the weight of the
whole report seems to have rested upon the pre
sumed etymology of the word educate.'
The deficiences of this approach are obvious:
1 Words change their meanings. Hence even i
this particular etymology were adequately stated, i
could give no more than a tentative and partial hin
as to the present meaning of the word "education."
2. Given a complex enterprise like that of moderr
education, many different words are involved. If we
are to rely on etymology, we ought surely to con
sider also the etymologies of a variety of other En
glish words which are relevant to education, such as
learning, training, study, scholarship, instruction,
teaching, tutoring, lecturing, research, etc. These
would yield different results, reflecting the simple
fact that education has many facets, and dimen
sions, which cannot be captured by looking at any
simplified etymology of any single word.
3. On the Latin side, we should note first that in
addition to the verb educere (3rd conjugation) on
which the SES committee chose to rely, there was
another related Latin verb, educare (Ist conjuga
tion) meaning 'to train, to rear, to bring up ' It is from
the latter (and its nouneducatfo) that our word edu
cation' is most immediately derived. Secondly, the
Romans had several other verbs which they applied
to the process of education, including instituere,
instruere, and erudire. None of these suggests to
lead forth ; the first two suggested the idea of estab
lishing,' constructing' or setting in order, while the
last implied making smooth.'
Thus the committee's central line of argument —
the first among its "basic premises" — must be
rejected as wholly misconceived This fact does not,
of course, necessarily refute the laissez faire
philosophy which the committee derived from it; as
previously observed, that philosophy might con
ceivably be supported on other grounds. However,
since no other basis was supplied, the committee's
general conclusion stands unsupported. We are left
with, at best, a negative theory of laissez faire — a
theory which might as well have been adopted out of
sheer inertia or even from an impulse to deflate
student po'itical demands by making educational
concessions 2 On this view, educational restraints
are wrong primarily because they are burdensome
and because they are disliked. Eliminating require
ments is good because freedom is good, in and of
itself If teachers are free to teach what they want to
teach and students are free to learn what they want
to leam, we may trust that everybody will benefit and
that the proper interests of society will be served
111
The question now is whether that trust has been
vindicated or discredited The indications are
mounting that it has been discredited — that the kind
of educational laissez faire recommended by the
SES report has already been found seriously defi
cient Several emerging difficulties call for particular
attention.
1 The problem of standards
Derek Bok, President of Harvard University (and
a Stanford alumnus) began a recent article "On the
Purposes of Undergraduate Education' (Daedalus.
Fall, 1974, pp 159-172) as follows
"Scholars who study the behavior of
human organizations constantly stress the
importance of defining institutional goals
Without dear objectives, it is said, an mstitu
tion cannot evaluate how well it is perform
ing, decide how to allocate its resources
wisely, plan for future growth, motivate its
members, or justify its existence to the
larger public
"Despite these admonitions, our colleges
seem to exist without making much of an
effort to define their aims In the thick reports
on undergraduate education that many col
leges have produced in recent years, there
is little discuMion of what it is that a liberal
arts education should provide for me stu-

dent. The prevailing sentiment is captured
by the statement of a curriculum committee
in one of our most distinguished univer
sities: The objective toward which cur
riculum planning should strive is, to the ex
tent possible, to let the teacher teach what
he wants to teach and the student learn
t what he wants to learn.' "
It should be noted lhat the concluding sentence,
cited as exemplifying a prevalent defiaency, is bor
rowed from the SES report; it is the second of the
two excerpts quoted at the beginning of this paper
Bok's point is that the SES philosophy of laissez
faire provides no standards for directing or evaluat
ing any aspect of the academic enterprise, or judg
ing academic performance. If the controlling objec
tive is to allow teachers and students to do whatever
they prefer, why should the university not provide
instruction in basketweaving? If it be replied that
accepted standards of academic excellence and
competence are assumed, the question arises
where such standards originate and how they are
maintained. To the extent that they are needed, the
laissez faire philosophy is thereby shown to be in
adequate
It is one thing to maintain that teachers should
enjoy teaching and that students should enjoy learn
ing, but it is something else to say that immediate
enjoyment — which can vary according to the fash
ions of the day — is to be taken as the primary
measure of academic success. It is perhaps worth
remarking that while the SES report relied on Alfred
North Whitehead's observation that the University's
justification is to preserve "the connection between
knowledge and the zest of life, by uniting the young
and the old in the imaginative consideration of learn
ing" (SES, I, 10) it failed to note that in the same
essay (as well as elsewhere in his writings on edu
cation) Whitehead stressed the need for a "discip
line of imagination" so that the superior vigor of the
young should be tempered by the superior experi
ence of the elders. The persistent problem of educa
tion, in Whitehead's view, is to combine discipline
and imagination so that neither destroys the other.
In his words, "qualities essential at a later stage of a
career are apt to be stamped out in an earlier stage
This is only an instance of the more general fact, that
technical excellence can only be acquired by a train
ing which is apt to damage those energies of mind
which should direct the technical skill. This is the key
fact in education, and the reason for most of its
difficulties." 3
2. Problems of specialization and vocationalism
The Harvard report of 1945, General Education in
a Free Society, probably the most widely influential t
report on higher issued in the decadea
immediate following World War II, devoted most of
its attention to a discussion of the purposes and
functions of education in a free society, "It is fruit
less," the Harvard committee wrote, "to think about
any such practical step as a curriculum without hav
ing in mind specifications or points of reference, in
this case the ends toward which the curriculum
should look and the students for whom it is in
tended." 4
The main problems of education were there attri
buted to three sources: first, the progressive expan
sion of knowledge with the attendant multiplication
of specialisms and sub-specialisms in all areas;
second, the great increase in the number of college
students as opportunities for education beyond the
high-school were extended from the privileged few
and made available to young people at large; and
third, to the increasing complexity of modern society
itself. To cope with these problems, the Harvard
committee felt that education at the college level
ought to perform a dual role. It must, on the one
hand, fully recognize the need for increasing
specialization and provide a foundation for students
going on to careers or vocations requiring particular
skills in diverse areas. But it must at the same time
seek to balance the fragmentation and atomization
threatened by the multiplication of specialties by
finding some unifying dimension or dimensions. It
was concluded that the latter function required re
newed stress on the sort of education that had been
traditionally called "liberal education," specifically
the kind of education designed to develop the
natural capacities of the student as a human being
regardless of the particular social role which he or
she might subsequently fill. "Our conclusion, then,"
wrote the Harvard committee in 1945," is that the
aim of education should be to prepare an individual
to become an expert both in some particular voca
tion or art and in the general art of the free man and
the citizen. Thus the two kinds of education once
given separately to different social classes must be
given to all alike." 5
These views are cited not to suggest that the
curricular innovations recommended by the Har
vard committee in 1945 accomplished their purpose
(which is open to serious debate) but to show that
the committee identified — and tried to meet —
three problems which became more and more pres
sing in the ensuing years Among these, the con
tinued multiplication of specialisms with spreading
emphasis on the importance to the student of de
veloping marketable skills, at a high level of sophis
tication, has proved perhaps the most intractable
One way to deal with this problem is, of course, to do
nothing — to drift with the prevailing current rather
than attempt to swim against it. The SES report, with
its philosophy of laissez faire, does exactly that
Since increasing specialism is the order of the day.
and since competent scholars are specialists, it can
be claimed, "realism" dictates that we accept that
fact, adapting our education to it and letting
threatened dangers take care of themselves But
some of those threatened dangers have already
become actual.

(i) As the opinion spreads that the main function of
higher education is to develop in the student mar
ketable skills — what Steven Miller, President of
Johns Hopkins, calls "higher skilling" as opposed to
higher education 8 — for a job market which is al
ready oversaturated, the value of a college educa
tion is necessanly depreciated. If it were recog
nized, however, that the chief function of a college
education is to develop the human potential of the
student without regard to the particular job he or she
might eventually hold or the particular social role he
or she might occupy, the result would be otherwise
Success or failure in the job market would not be
considered so crucial There is here an illustration of
the point made before, that the objectives (or sup
posed objectives) of education always provide the
criteria for evaluating success or failure
(ii) In regard to the nature and status if knowledge,
Steven Muller, in the article just mentioned, asked
the pregnant question If all our scholars are stand
ing at the frontiers of knowledge, who is standing at
the center? Is there today any center? If not, how
can there be any community of scholars in the tradi
tional sense?
Under present conditions, there is no genuine
community of teachers or students in any college or
university, but rather an aggregate of specialists
and students, each pursuing his or her own sepa
rate interests in geographical proximity, with little or
no basis for cross-disciplinary communication or
understanding One consequence is that most scho
lars feel more affinity with, and more respect for,
their professional colleagues in other universities
than for members of other departments in their own
And there is no longer any unity of knowledge, but
only a collocation of separate knowledges Such a
situation may. perhaps, be defended certainly it is
preferable to an ideological uniformity arbitrarily im
posed But surety there is a middle ground between

these extremes. Muller considers that some return
to general education, with universal requirements
for English, for a second language, for cultural his
tory, and for science, is necessary to restore the
un 'ty of genuine education.
What all our scholars in different disciplines have
in common is that they are all human beings, that
they all share the same cultural inheritance, and that
they are all engaged (or should be) in the same
quest — the quest for greater knowledge and wider
understanding. And we do well, we believe, to recall
the observation of Arthur Lovejoy that he who knows
only his own special field may not know what is most
worth looking lor in his special field. 7
#ii) An extensive investigation recently conducted
byktwo ecfcjcation reporters of the Los Angeles
Tunes into the concurrent phenomena of progres
sive grade inflation along with progressive decline in
the average level of students' proficiency has been
the widespread substitution of new elective
oourses, sometimes lacking in academic rigor, for
the kind of basic courses which used to be required
for all students. 8 Though the demonstration is not
conclusive, it is at least persuasively documented
As against suggestions that the decline in test
scores is due to other causes — such as altered
family structures, the increased number of less qual
ified students, regional factors, or the unreliability of
test scores — the authors of the report point out that
the two areas where test scores have not declined
but held steady or advanced are the areas in which
basic requirements have been largely retained, i.e.,
in the first three primary grades in school and in the
sciences at post-secondary level. These investiga
tions, which are too long to summanze, are worth
senous attention. At least, they cannot be ignored,
despite the attempts of some educators to dismiss
or discount them.
(iv) There is clear evidence that college students
today resent the increasingly competitive atmos
phere of post-secondary education. 9 It seems to be
a fair inference that the competitive aspect reflects
the increasing emphasis in higher education upon
the development of marketable skills. When stu
dents are competing for entrance to professional
schools or for jobs requiring technical proficiency,
and when good grades are seen as important for
Stich purposes, the process of college education
naturally comes to be seen as a struggle of each
against all; for admission to a limited number of
'ftllure positions. But liberal education, in the tradi
tional sense, has a different character. The
philosopher Spinoza pointed out that intellectual
goods sought for their own sake are non-
C9mpetitive. If one person achieves wisdom or in
creased insight, he is not threatened but reinforced
if his neighbors do likewise. Here is one major dif
ference between virtues of character and technical
skills, at least where the latter determine job oppor
tunities. Nothing is so useful or agreeable to the
virtuous man, Spinoza wrote, as the company of
others who are like-minded. Where self-realization
or self-improvement is the aim rather than voca
tional proficiency — as is the case with liberal edu
cation — emulation can be a spur without being a
threat. And the community of scholars, for teachers
and students alike, rests upon such a foundation
Thef search for "higher skilling" is centrifugal; the
search for liberal education is centripetal. A student
whose aim is self-development or self-improvement
as a human being values grades only as indications
of his own progress, not for any advantage they may
give over others.

(v) As our society becomes increasingly complex,
as specialisms multiply, and as it becomes increas
ingly apparent that the most serious problems ex
tend over many diciplines, it follows, as Professor
Gabriel Almond has observed, that "only higher
order philosophical syntheses can spell out the big
issues and formulate alternative solutions." 10 At the
same time, our society is becoming more and more
susceptible at all levels to the pull of simplistic slo
gans, catchwords, images, stereotypes and
counter-stereotypes. In this situation the need for
critical intelligence and balanced judgment is be
coming more and more acute, yet this need is not
likely to be apparent to the beginning student, par
ticularly if he is bent on acquiring some particular
skill. The SES report quoted approvingly an obser
vation of Professor Edwin M. Good to the effect that
the important simplicities are those which lie "on the
other side of complexity" (Vol. I, p. 11). Surely the
proper inference is that today's student, seeking tp
pick his way through the growing thicket of com
plexities towards some thoughtful and balanced
overview — as opposed to the delusive simplicities
offered by catchwords and fashionable stereotypes
— needs more guidance and direction than ever
before. The claim of the SES committee that today's
student is in a better position than anybody else to
choose the academic path he will take (Vol. I. p. 15)
seems like saying that the thicker the forest be
comes, the less need there is to require would-be
travellers to take a guide.
IV
Recommendations for achieving the aims of lib
eral education generally envisage imposed re
quirements covenng, in addition to courses in En
glish and in a foreign language, a required course or
courses in Western culture or the history of ideas
We are not concerned here with particular prog
rams, but with the sort of objections most commonly
raised against imposing such requirements.
1. It is often claimed that a required course in
Western culture or the history of ideas in the West is
chauvinistic, since it implies the superiority of the
Western tradition above other traditions The objec
tion is misconceived The purpose of studying the
Western tradition is not to celebrate it but to under
stand It — for good or ill. To evaluate Western
culture, or any other culture, without first making the
effort to understand it is to judge irrationally without
adequate evidence Many people make this very
mistake, but the fact that the mistake is common
affords a good reason for trying to correct it.
2. It is often claimed that requiring students to
study any particular subject is arbitrary because no
particular subject is intrinsically more important than
any other One might, so the argument goes, make
as good a case for general requirement in, say,
psychology or the scientific study of human be
havior The answer here is that all heirs of the West
ern tradition — whether specialists or generalists,
students or faculty, regardless of their special in
terests and capacities — are themselves con
ditioned by Western culture The same is true of all
the specialized disciplines which have developed in
the West they all reflect distinctively Western con
ceptions of rationality and the role of systematic
inquiry '' (Xir heritage affects our preconceptions
about the nature and function of scientific know
ledge as well as our preconceptions about values
and norms It is not too much to say that no person
can hope to understand who he or she is without
some understanding of the cultural context, handed
down from prior generations, in which he or she
presently exists Nobody lives, thinks, or talks in a
cultural void Nobody is exempt from cultural influ
ences Hence the peculiar importance of a general
requirement that students systematically examine
the cultural background which they all share
3 It is sometimes objected that a cultural re
quirement would put a premium on conformity to
accepted values We would suggest that the oppo
site is true The dangerous conformities are those
which are blind, unconscious, and uncritical Most
cultures breed rebels as well as conformists, as our

culture has. If a required course in Western culture
is designed (as above noted) to promote the accu
rate understanding of the Western orientation, the
result should be to make both rebels and confor
mists more dearly aware of what it is that they are
rejecting or accepting.
4. It has been objected that there is no reliable
evidence by which we can evaluate the effective
ness of general courses of the kind here envisaged;
hence they should not be required. We grant the
premise but reject the conclusion. The difficulty of
evaluation arises principally, we think, from the fact
that a good educational program has, or should
have, a long-term impact upon the student, and
such impacts are not precisely identifiable or quanti
fiable. To insist too much on precise evaluations
tends to put the emphasis on those short-term be
nefits and immediate satisfaction which can be as
certained, at the expense of the lasting benefits
which can be recognized, if at all, only in retrospect.
However this may be, the present objection cuts
both ways. If we cannot measure in advance the
precise effectiveness of a proposed requirement,
we cannot measure the relative effectiveness of a
program from which such requirements are omitted.
5. It has been claimed that students cannot be
made to learn what they do not wish to learn, or, as
last year s Council of ASSU Presidents put it, "You
can lead a student to a class but you can't make one
think." This position calls for clarification, because it
is highly ambiguous.
Much of what we learn from everyday experience
is not chosen, but forced upon us, often against our
wills, like learning that hot stoves can burn or that
careless driving invites serious accidents. With re
gard to required courses, the evidence is that many
generations of Stanford graduates found value in,
and claim to have profited from, the old course in
Western Civilization despite its having been pre
scribed. Many required courses in other colleges
and universities seem to have had substantial suc
cess. It is evident that the present objection is over
stated.
Perhaps we should interpret it to mean that stu
dents learn better when they study subjects which
they enjoy. There is some truth in this, but there is
also room for a serious confusion. One may enjoy
the process of studying a subject without liking or
approving the subject under study. A medical stu
dent, for example, does not normally enjoy or ap
prove of diseases A student of criminal behavior
does not normally enjoy or approve of crime. Such
students take satisfaction in learning how to cope
with the problems created by disease and crime. So
also a student of Western culture need not like or
approve of Western culture as such in order to find
satisfaction in making a study of it. If this distinction
is kept in mind, a further point emerges, namely, that
nobody can judge whether studying a given subject
will yield satisfaction or prove valuable to him until
after he has engaged in it. Students who view all
required courses as an infringement upon their
freedom of choice sometimes forget that freedom to
make informed choices is not the same as freedom
to make uninformed choices.
It used to be taken lor granted that if students
came to college, it was because they wished to be
made to think, this being accepted as an essential
part of a college education. The present argument,
however, introduces a distinction, as if students
were now saying: "Please give us an education, but
don't make us Slink — or at least, don't make us
think any more than we like or about topics we don't
like." Such a position, if taken seriously, would make
disciplined thinking peripheral rather than central to
the educational process, since disciplined thinking
is usually laborious and the habit of disciplined think
ing can only be acquired, like other skills, by sus
tained practice and fatiguing application.
Finally, it should be noted that when autonomy is
equated with negative freedom in Berlin's sense —
that is to say with freedom from restraints — and
when freedom from restraints is conceived as imply
ing freedom from any imposed norms or standards,
autonomy loses its value As Sartre showed in
Being and Nothingness, freedom without
guidelines is a burden; it is the freedom of the travel
ler lost in the jungle without a map, who can move in
any direction he wishes but has no basis for choos
ing one direction rather than another. From the
psychological point of view, this kind of freedom
results either in existential despair or in a kind of
narcissism which, valuing only sensations and ple
asures of the moment, and fearing the restraint of
any firm commitments, ends by trivalizing the very
pleasures it claims to prize. l 2 It also serves to de
stroy community with others; cooperation among
individuals is impossible where there are no com
monly accepted standards of acceptable and unac
ceptable behavior, because nobody can count on
what others will do. And even the ideal of universal
brotherhood is weakened if it is taken to imply free
dom from any concrete responsibilities to any par
ticular human beings 13
In a society where catchwords tend to replace
critical inquiry, words like freedom' and autonomy
take on a life of their own and acquire a special
emotional force, as if they represented absolute
goods. If autonomy is valuable, we easily assume
that the more autonomy we have the better off we
are, and that a condition of unlimited autonomy must
be best of all But such is not the case Individual
freedom and autonomy are vitally important as in
strumental goods, but to convert them into absolute
goods is to destroy their function.
V
In the foregoing section we have argued that re
quirements, far from being an evil, are, in fact,
necessary for the purposes of a liberal education
Here we may be more specific about requirements
at Stanford.
The Stanford undergraduate curriculum currentty
includes two requirements One is that of the Major,
based on the pnnciple of study in depth This re
quirement was re-examined and reaffirmed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (Campus
Report, 130ct. 1976, p.B). The other is the recently
redefined Distnbution Requirement wtiich aims to
provide the breadth of study necessary for a liberal
eAjcation to yield "a richer personal life through the
development of spaciousness of mind and spirit
The Distribution Requirements exist to ensure ex
posure to different ideas and different ways of think
ing They should enable (one) to understand better
the major ways of knowing,' to assess their
strengths and limitations, to appreciate their un
iqueness, and no less importantly to discern what
they have in common" (DRAT, p 21).
Under the present system, work in the three re
quired areas entails the study of certain works of
creative imagination in their cultural and histoncal
contexts, or of certain problems of philosophy and
belief (Humanities); the study of society, social in
stitutions. and human behavior (Social Saences);
and the study of natural phenomena, technology,
and math (NS/M/T) The stress in each area is upon
approaches, scholarly methods, and the general
human significance of the vanous kinds of study In
addition, for each area, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommends development of
groups of correlated courses; in Humanities the
courses chosen to fulfil the requirement must form a
group which can be certified" by the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (directly approved by the Dean
if the group is chosen by a student, indirectly, if set
up by a department)
The pnnaple of breadth is thus fulfilled by requir

ing a certain amount of study in the three areas into
which human knowledge has been conveniently di
vided. Vet, within each area, a different principle of
order is invoked, and a broad, comprehensive out
look is neither required nor encouraged Moreover,
no principles are stated for the organization of cor re
lated groups or "sequences" within the areas. Nor
has advice been given to departments on the ways
in which they should, in practice, "group" their own
courses or correlate them with courses in other de
partments
In addition, students have not been advised about
the designing of a Humanities program which might
be acceptable to the Doan. Much of the "freedom"
prescribed by SES was predicated on the assump
tion that undergraduate advising, especially for un
declared majors (freshman and sophomore years),
would be vigorous and that the "strongly recom
mended" alternatives and choices would be made
under vigilant academic guidance. Unfortunately,
the faculty, as advisors, cannot peiform the neces
sary academic surveillance given the laissoz fain)
philosophy of the present system.
This loosely structured program may have some
merit in that it recognizes the validity of both syn
chronic and diachronic methods of study, however,
it is impractical and unwittingly misleading. A stu
dent can easily justify the coherence of a group of
three courses, on say, the liteiature, art and society
of fifth-century Athens, or that of a group embracing
the three story-tellers Homer, Dorothy Richardson
and Dostoyevsky, or even that of any three courses
taught by an individual professor.
Are these two requirements — Major and Dis
tribution — an adequate foundation for a liberal
education? We feel that they are not. The student
certainly needs the intellectual methods proper to
the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences which the Distribution Requirement is
supposed to provide. But a good liberal education
has to be more comprehensive. It must include
some systematic study of the fundamental nature
and development of the culture and civilization
within which the student is living and to which he will
someday contribute. It must also provide basic in
formation about the complexities of modern society,
the means to analyse and evaluate that society, and
the perspective necessary to judge it on a compara
tive basis. In addition, the student should have some
knowledge of a culture remote from his own — a
culture outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition, suc h
as Greek or Asian — which will confront him with
ideas that challenge his unconscious assumptions
about his own time and place.
Many who agree in principle with such educa
tional ideals feel that they cannot be achieved. We
disagree. This is a university rich in teaching re
sources which has demonstrated on other occa
sions an ability to make sensible and worthwhile
educational innovations when they have been
needed. They are needed now. Departments and
individual instructors are well-equipped to deal with
the task at hand, and we should certainly draw on
our excellent teaching resources.
The Report of the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford has
suggested certain specific ways in which, through a
program of "tracks," undergraduate education
could achieve the strength and the focus it lacks at
the moment. The Report also mentions the desira
bility of historical and comparative studies whereby
modern Western culture can be confr onted not only
with past stages of its development, but also with
manifestations of other cultures. The program en
visioned by the Report is based partly on existing
courses covering the Western tradition. This prog
ram would allow the student to choose among four
approaches — literature and language; history; re
ligion and philosophy, or the creative and perform
ing arts — all leading to the same goal. This ap
proach would give to each student an educational
program more coherent than the present one.
The appropriate authorities — the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, the Doan of Undar
graduate Studies, the Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (where most under
graduate teaching takes place) — must now de
velop a plan for providing, either through new
courses or through the adaptation of existing
courses, a method for satisfying the educational
needs we have outlined. Those authorities should
also consider how that plan, when in operation,
could be monitored effectively T he responsibility
our University has to its undergraduates and the
obligation it has to its reputation demands that such
action be taken promptly.
Having outlined our views in this general stato
ment, we intend to publish in the next few months a
series of position papers suggesting concrete im
provements to undergraduate education at Stan
ford.

For approximately one year, a group o
humanities faculty members, gathering together tc
discuss issues of mutual concern, has debated the
merits of the present structure of the undergraduate
curriculum at Stanford. Events both local and na
tional have encouraged this sustained debate. The
group has had, moreover, the opportunity to hear, al
its informal sessions, the opinions of some of the
' officers of the University who could be expected to
play key roles in the elaboration of the under
graduate curnculum in future years. Among these
officers have been the President, the Dean ol
Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Under
gracfcjate Studies, and the Dean of Admissions.
What herewith follows is not necessarily a reflec
tion of the attitudes of any one of these officers, nor
of any one faculty member Rather, the group as a
whole would now like to offer to the campus com
munity a statement bearing on the design of that
curnculum. The group recognizes that it possesses
neither final wisdom nor institutional authority in
matters such as these; it also recognizes that exten
sive planning remains to be done before revisions in
the curriculum can be addopted
The group speaks, however, with a sense ol
urgency. It is satisfied neither with the quality of the
intellectual life, nor with the goals and standards of
the undergraduate program. It believes, moreover,
that dissatisfaction, at times expressed and at other
times muted, is a sentiment shared by many faculty
members at Stanford. Nor is such a condition
merely local. Discussion within the group has been
enlivened in the past year by the clear recognition
that the problems Stanford now faces (and must
rigorously attempt to resolve) are problems affect
ing every prestigious institution of higher learning.
That the problems are national in their dimensions is
indicated by, among other things, the special
1974-75 issues of Daedalus (Journal of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences) wherein
eighty-four distinguished educators, including sev
eral from Stanford, speak to the conditions now
defining academic life. Differences among these
educators are certainly present, but all are
frightened, as the editor says, "by what they see as
a lack of concern for intellectual values, others worry
about what they think to be a reduced social con
sciousness." The perspective in which this deep
concern, on both the national level and the local
level, takes place is more serious, of course, than
the question of which course or courses must be
required of the undergraduate. It is more serious
than any particular detail. But details and particulars
will, at the appropriate moment, play their crucial
part when revisions in the curriculum are proposed
and then established. The editor of Daedalus de
scribes the newly emergent situation not as "a re
petition of the discussion that occurred in the middle
of the nineteenth century when a rigid, classically
oriented college curriculum was challenged by the
new theoretical and applied sciences. Much more is
at stake today; the continued viability of the concept
of the liberally-educated person is involved."
About the continued viability the Stanford com
munity has the deepest obligation to be concerned.
In the immediate past, that concern has been ex
pressed by the Report of the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stan
ford. The spirit of that Report, in which a clear com
mitment to a requirement in Western Culture is af
firmed, must be sustained and nourished. Hence
the informal Humanities and Sciences group is
happy to note that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has recently, and unanimously, also en
dorsed "the principle that studies in Western Culture
should be part of each student's education."
Discussions within the group have also been in
vigorated by the understanding that the problems
Stanford now faces are not purely national but are
Stanford's own This university must fulfill the spe
cial obligations it has as a private institution, of great
prestige, within a state and a geography dominated
by non-private institutions Its mission has been,
and is, special; so can be the quality of its under
graduate education. To this obligation President
Richard W. Lyman has often spoken, and most tel
lingly speaks in the pages of Daedalus, where he
says
We who are responsible for the continuing
health of our "little platoons" — and even
the greatest of the private universities are
"little platoons" when matched against the
dimensions of state-supported higher edu
cation — we have our work cut out for us...
one virture that ought to be within the reach
of independent institutions, be they old or
new, famous or obscure, is that of rigorous
self-definition.
It is to that rigor arte 1 that self-definition that Stan
ford's attention must now turn Prompted, then, by
both the national anxiety and concern, and opposed
to the idle, helpless notion that little can be done in
the face of curricular and intellectual complexity, this
statement is offered to the Stanford community It is
hoped that it will play some effective part in discus
sions within the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
and the Academic Senate.
The pnnciples underlying the 1968 Study of Edu
cation at Stanford are treated here first. That Study
predates the Report of the Committee on the Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
and by virtue of the seriousness and thoughtfulness
with which it was undertaken, has achieved a con
siderable weight in later discussions of curricular
reform But as the Study itself observes, its spirit
was one of "self-examination and self-renewal." It
further observes that "the study of education must
become a process rather than event." Eight years
have since passed: changes now seem wholly
proper and necessary In the light, then, of such
changes to be made, a second matter for discussion
follows the first It is a consideration of the newly
formulated system of distnbution requirements. Al
though that system is the product of much labor on
the part of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, it does not coherently and directly address
the fundamental inadequacies of the present cur
ncular program for the undergraduate student, it is a
system that is too diffuse and too loosely monitored
to be able to do so Only by a program that is more
coherently structured can the mtellecuual life of the
Stanford student be made more challenging, in
tense, and rewarding
II
The basic philosophy of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). published in 1968-69, was that of
educational laissez fairs This is reflected in two
parallel pronouncements, the first of which ap
peared in the general introductory section of the
report and the second in the section on under
graduate education
"Let fie objectrve of curncular planning be
to encourage the faculty member to teach
what he likes to teach and the student to
learn what seems vital to him — the Intellec
tual History of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century rather than the History of Western
Civilization Modern Consciousness rather
than Freshman English. Organizational Be
havior rather than Introduction to Sociology
— and from this common freedom may
emerge a form of general education far bet
ter suited to the cftaractennbcs of a umver
slty than that to which we pay lip service

now." (Vol. I, p. 14)
And again:
"The objective toward which curriculum
planning should strive is, to the extent pos
sible, to let the teacher teach what he wants
to teach and the student learn what he
wants to learn." (Vol. II, p. 12)
Now philosophies of laissez faire can be arrived at
in different ways and supported or defended on
different grounds. Having in mind Isaiah Berlin's
significant distinction between positive and negative
conceptions of freedom — possitive freedom being
freedom for the achievement of some end deemed
desirable, negative freedom being freedom from
restraint on the assumption that restraint is wrong in
itself 1 — we can roughly distinguish between posi
tive and negative philosophies of laissez faire.
Adam Smith's views concerning economic be
havior were positive in this sense, not because they
were necessarily correct, but because they were
based on extensive inquiries into the nature of
wealth, the nature of human motivation and be
havior, and a clear belief in the desirability of the
conditions to which he thought a free market
economy would contribute. One may, of course,
quarrel with his views, but the fact remains that he
had a carefully worked out theory of social welfare
and advocated free enterprise as the best means of
achieving it. It is not inconceivable that a positive
doctrine of educational laissez faire might be simi
larly grounded on some carefully worked out and
coherent theory of the objectives, functions, and
social impact of higher education. But SES failed to
provide any such theory Instead it provided a nega
tive philosophy of laissez faire based on the view
that in higher education, restraints of any kind are
inherently bad. Moreover, this view was itself based
on a curiously narrow and dubious line of argument
which calls for special attention and comment.
The SES committee took the position that it ought
to base its "proposed reponses to the problems of
education at Stanford on careful consideration of
the meaning of education for individual teacher and
student and of the nature of the university" (Vol. I, p.
8). So far, so good. But it then proceeded to deal
with these questions, not by considering the general
objectives, functions and possible impact of higher
education in and on today's society, nor by consider
ing the important "new dimensions" which it had
cited in the opening sentence of its report as having
been introduced by the student unrest of the 1960's.
Instead, the Committee attempted to deal with all
these questions by the simple expedient of examin
ing the etymology of the single world, education '
The Committee established its "basic premises" i

as follows:
To establish our basic premises we must
begin with our conceptions of education and
of a university. The world 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educere meaning to
lead forth.' To lead does not mean to com
pel, or to push, or to pull. It means quite
simply what it says.. (1,10)
On this foundation it was immediately concluded
(among other things) that education "can never be
compelled nor can knowledge be impressed on a
mind unwilling to learn if it is to be more than indoc
trination'' (I, 10). It was also inferred (without any
corresponding concern for the etymology of the
word "university") that "the University can nevei
educate in the true sense of the word, but it can
supply the environment and the means necessary
to insure that those who came here may educate
each other and themselves'' (I, 10). In short, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, the weight of the
whole report seems to have rested upon the pre
sumed etymology of the word educate.'
The deficiences of this approach are obvious:
1 Words change their meanings. Hence even i
this particular etymology were adequately stated, i
could give no more than a tentative and partial hin
as to the present meaning of the word "education."
2. Given a complex enterprise like that of moderr
education, many different words are involved. If we
are to rely on etymology, we ought surely to con
sider also the etymologies of a variety of other En
glish words which are relevant to education, such as
learning, training, study, scholarship, instruction,
teaching, tutoring, lecturing, research, etc. These
would yield different results, reflecting the simple
fact that education has many facets, and dimen
sions, which cannot be captured by looking at any
simplified etymology of any single word.
3. On the Latin side, we should note first that in
addition to the verb educere (3rd conjugation) on
which the SES committee chose to rely, there was
another related Latin verb, educare (Ist conjuga
tion) meaning 'to train, to rear, to bring up ' It is from
the latter (and its nouneducatfo) that our word edu
cation' is most immediately derived. Secondly, the
Romans had several other verbs which they applied
to the process of education, including instituere,
instruere, and erudire. None of these suggests to
lead forth ; the first two suggested the idea of estab
lishing,' constructing' or setting in order, while the
last implied making smooth.'
Thus the committee's central line of argument —
the first among its "basic premises" — must be
rejected as wholly misconceived This fact does not,
of course, necessarily refute the laissez faire
philosophy which the committee derived from it; as
previously observed, that philosophy might con
ceivably be supported on other grounds. However,
since no other basis was supplied, the committee's
general conclusion stands unsupported. We are left
with, at best, a negative theory of laissez faire — a
theory which might as well have been adopted out of
sheer inertia or even from an impulse to deflate
student po'itical demands by making educational
concessions 2 On this view, educational restraints
are wrong primarily because they are burdensome
and because they are disliked. Eliminating require
ments is good because freedom is good, in and of
itself If teachers are free to teach what they want to
teach and students are free to learn what they want
to leam, we may trust that everybody will benefit and
that the proper interests of society will be served
111
The question now is whether that trust has been
vindicated or discredited The indications are
mounting that it has been discredited — that the kind
of educational laissez faire recommended by the
SES report has already been found seriously defi
cient Several emerging difficulties call for particular
attention.
1 The problem of standards
Derek Bok, President of Harvard University (and
a Stanford alumnus) began a recent article "On the
Purposes of Undergraduate Education' (Daedalus.
Fall, 1974, pp 159-172) as follows
"Scholars who study the behavior of
human organizations constantly stress the
importance of defining institutional goals
Without dear objectives, it is said, an mstitu
tion cannot evaluate how well it is perform
ing, decide how to allocate its resources
wisely, plan for future growth, motivate its
members, or justify its existence to the
larger public
"Despite these admonitions, our colleges
seem to exist without making much of an
effort to define their aims In the thick reports
on undergraduate education that many col
leges have produced in recent years, there
is little discuMion of what it is that a liberal
arts education should provide for me stu-

dent. The prevailing sentiment is captured
by the statement of a curriculum committee
in one of our most distinguished univer
sities: The objective toward which cur
riculum planning should strive is, to the ex
tent possible, to let the teacher teach what
he wants to teach and the student learn
t what he wants to learn.' "
It should be noted lhat the concluding sentence,
cited as exemplifying a prevalent defiaency, is bor
rowed from the SES report; it is the second of the
two excerpts quoted at the beginning of this paper
Bok's point is that the SES philosophy of laissez
faire provides no standards for directing or evaluat
ing any aspect of the academic enterprise, or judg
ing academic performance. If the controlling objec
tive is to allow teachers and students to do whatever
they prefer, why should the university not provide
instruction in basketweaving? If it be replied that
accepted standards of academic excellence and
competence are assumed, the question arises
where such standards originate and how they are
maintained. To the extent that they are needed, the
laissez faire philosophy is thereby shown to be in
adequate
It is one thing to maintain that teachers should
enjoy teaching and that students should enjoy learn
ing, but it is something else to say that immediate
enjoyment — which can vary according to the fash
ions of the day — is to be taken as the primary
measure of academic success. It is perhaps worth
remarking that while the SES report relied on Alfred
North Whitehead's observation that the University's
justification is to preserve "the connection between
knowledge and the zest of life, by uniting the young
and the old in the imaginative consideration of learn
ing" (SES, I, 10) it failed to note that in the same
essay (as well as elsewhere in his writings on edu
cation) Whitehead stressed the need for a "discip
line of imagination" so that the superior vigor of the
young should be tempered by the superior experi
ence of the elders. The persistent problem of educa
tion, in Whitehead's view, is to combine discipline
and imagination so that neither destroys the other.
In his words, "qualities essential at a later stage of a
career are apt to be stamped out in an earlier stage
This is only an instance of the more general fact, that
technical excellence can only be acquired by a train
ing which is apt to damage those energies of mind
which should direct the technical skill. This is the key
fact in education, and the reason for most of its
difficulties." 3
2. Problems of specialization and vocationalism
The Harvard report of 1945, General Education in
a Free Society, probably the most widely influential t
report on higher issued in the decadea
immediate following World War II, devoted most of
its attention to a discussion of the purposes and
functions of education in a free society, "It is fruit
less," the Harvard committee wrote, "to think about
any such practical step as a curriculum without hav
ing in mind specifications or points of reference, in
this case the ends toward which the curriculum
should look and the students for whom it is in
tended." 4
The main problems of education were there attri
buted to three sources: first, the progressive expan
sion of knowledge with the attendant multiplication
of specialisms and sub-specialisms in all areas;
second, the great increase in the number of college
students as opportunities for education beyond the
high-school were extended from the privileged few
and made available to young people at large; and
third, to the increasing complexity of modern society
itself. To cope with these problems, the Harvard
committee felt that education at the college level
ought to perform a dual role. It must, on the one
hand, fully recognize the need for increasing
specialization and provide a foundation for students
going on to careers or vocations requiring particular
skills in diverse areas. But it must at the same time
seek to balance the fragmentation and atomization
threatened by the multiplication of specialties by
finding some unifying dimension or dimensions. It
was concluded that the latter function required re
newed stress on the sort of education that had been
traditionally called "liberal education," specifically
the kind of education designed to develop the
natural capacities of the student as a human being
regardless of the particular social role which he or
she might subsequently fill. "Our conclusion, then,"
wrote the Harvard committee in 1945," is that the
aim of education should be to prepare an individual
to become an expert both in some particular voca
tion or art and in the general art of the free man and
the citizen. Thus the two kinds of education once
given separately to different social classes must be
given to all alike." 5
These views are cited not to suggest that the
curricular innovations recommended by the Har
vard committee in 1945 accomplished their purpose
(which is open to serious debate) but to show that
the committee identified — and tried to meet —
three problems which became more and more pres
sing in the ensuing years Among these, the con
tinued multiplication of specialisms with spreading
emphasis on the importance to the student of de
veloping marketable skills, at a high level of sophis
tication, has proved perhaps the most intractable
One way to deal with this problem is, of course, to do
nothing — to drift with the prevailing current rather
than attempt to swim against it. The SES report, with
its philosophy of laissez faire, does exactly that
Since increasing specialism is the order of the day.
and since competent scholars are specialists, it can
be claimed, "realism" dictates that we accept that
fact, adapting our education to it and letting
threatened dangers take care of themselves But
some of those threatened dangers have already
become actual.

(i) As the opinion spreads that the main function of
higher education is to develop in the student mar
ketable skills — what Steven Miller, President of
Johns Hopkins, calls "higher skilling" as opposed to
higher education 8 — for a job market which is al
ready oversaturated, the value of a college educa
tion is necessanly depreciated. If it were recog
nized, however, that the chief function of a college
education is to develop the human potential of the
student without regard to the particular job he or she
might eventually hold or the particular social role he
or she might occupy, the result would be otherwise
Success or failure in the job market would not be
considered so crucial There is here an illustration of
the point made before, that the objectives (or sup
posed objectives) of education always provide the
criteria for evaluating success or failure
(ii) In regard to the nature and status if knowledge,
Steven Muller, in the article just mentioned, asked
the pregnant question If all our scholars are stand
ing at the frontiers of knowledge, who is standing at
the center? Is there today any center? If not, how
can there be any community of scholars in the tradi
tional sense?
Under present conditions, there is no genuine
community of teachers or students in any college or
university, but rather an aggregate of specialists
and students, each pursuing his or her own sepa
rate interests in geographical proximity, with little or
no basis for cross-disciplinary communication or
understanding One consequence is that most scho
lars feel more affinity with, and more respect for,
their professional colleagues in other universities
than for members of other departments in their own
And there is no longer any unity of knowledge, but
only a collocation of separate knowledges Such a
situation may. perhaps, be defended certainly it is
preferable to an ideological uniformity arbitrarily im
posed But surety there is a middle ground between

these extremes. Muller considers that some return
to general education, with universal requirements
for English, for a second language, for cultural his
tory, and for science, is necessary to restore the
un 'ty of genuine education.
What all our scholars in different disciplines have
in common is that they are all human beings, that
they all share the same cultural inheritance, and that
they are all engaged (or should be) in the same
quest — the quest for greater knowledge and wider
understanding. And we do well, we believe, to recall
the observation of Arthur Lovejoy that he who knows
only his own special field may not know what is most
worth looking lor in his special field. 7
#ii) An extensive investigation recently conducted
byktwo ecfcjcation reporters of the Los Angeles
Tunes into the concurrent phenomena of progres
sive grade inflation along with progressive decline in
the average level of students' proficiency has been
the widespread substitution of new elective
oourses, sometimes lacking in academic rigor, for
the kind of basic courses which used to be required
for all students. 8 Though the demonstration is not
conclusive, it is at least persuasively documented
As against suggestions that the decline in test
scores is due to other causes — such as altered
family structures, the increased number of less qual
ified students, regional factors, or the unreliability of
test scores — the authors of the report point out that
the two areas where test scores have not declined
but held steady or advanced are the areas in which
basic requirements have been largely retained, i.e.,
in the first three primary grades in school and in the
sciences at post-secondary level. These investiga
tions, which are too long to summanze, are worth
senous attention. At least, they cannot be ignored,
despite the attempts of some educators to dismiss
or discount them.
(iv) There is clear evidence that college students
today resent the increasingly competitive atmos
phere of post-secondary education. 9 It seems to be
a fair inference that the competitive aspect reflects
the increasing emphasis in higher education upon
the development of marketable skills. When stu
dents are competing for entrance to professional
schools or for jobs requiring technical proficiency,
and when good grades are seen as important for
Stich purposes, the process of college education
naturally comes to be seen as a struggle of each
against all; for admission to a limited number of
'ftllure positions. But liberal education, in the tradi
tional sense, has a different character. The
philosopher Spinoza pointed out that intellectual
goods sought for their own sake are non-
C9mpetitive. If one person achieves wisdom or in
creased insight, he is not threatened but reinforced
if his neighbors do likewise. Here is one major dif
ference between virtues of character and technical
skills, at least where the latter determine job oppor
tunities. Nothing is so useful or agreeable to the
virtuous man, Spinoza wrote, as the company of
others who are like-minded. Where self-realization
or self-improvement is the aim rather than voca
tional proficiency — as is the case with liberal edu
cation — emulation can be a spur without being a
threat. And the community of scholars, for teachers
and students alike, rests upon such a foundation
Thef search for "higher skilling" is centrifugal; the
search for liberal education is centripetal. A student
whose aim is self-development or self-improvement
as a human being values grades only as indications
of his own progress, not for any advantage they may
give over others.

(v) As our society becomes increasingly complex,
as specialisms multiply, and as it becomes increas
ingly apparent that the most serious problems ex
tend over many diciplines, it follows, as Professor
Gabriel Almond has observed, that "only higher
order philosophical syntheses can spell out the big
issues and formulate alternative solutions." 10 At the
same time, our society is becoming more and more
susceptible at all levels to the pull of simplistic slo
gans, catchwords, images, stereotypes and
counter-stereotypes. In this situation the need for
critical intelligence and balanced judgment is be
coming more and more acute, yet this need is not
likely to be apparent to the beginning student, par
ticularly if he is bent on acquiring some particular
skill. The SES report quoted approvingly an obser
vation of Professor Edwin M. Good to the effect that
the important simplicities are those which lie "on the
other side of complexity" (Vol. I, p. 11). Surely the
proper inference is that today's student, seeking tp
pick his way through the growing thicket of com
plexities towards some thoughtful and balanced
overview — as opposed to the delusive simplicities
offered by catchwords and fashionable stereotypes
— needs more guidance and direction than ever
before. The claim of the SES committee that today's
student is in a better position than anybody else to
choose the academic path he will take (Vol. I. p. 15)
seems like saying that the thicker the forest be
comes, the less need there is to require would-be
travellers to take a guide.
IV
Recommendations for achieving the aims of lib
eral education generally envisage imposed re
quirements covenng, in addition to courses in En
glish and in a foreign language, a required course or
courses in Western culture or the history of ideas
We are not concerned here with particular prog
rams, but with the sort of objections most commonly
raised against imposing such requirements.
1. It is often claimed that a required course in
Western culture or the history of ideas in the West is
chauvinistic, since it implies the superiority of the
Western tradition above other traditions The objec
tion is misconceived The purpose of studying the
Western tradition is not to celebrate it but to under
stand It — for good or ill. To evaluate Western
culture, or any other culture, without first making the
effort to understand it is to judge irrationally without
adequate evidence Many people make this very
mistake, but the fact that the mistake is common
affords a good reason for trying to correct it.
2. It is often claimed that requiring students to
study any particular subject is arbitrary because no
particular subject is intrinsically more important than
any other One might, so the argument goes, make
as good a case for general requirement in, say,
psychology or the scientific study of human be
havior The answer here is that all heirs of the West
ern tradition — whether specialists or generalists,
students or faculty, regardless of their special in
terests and capacities — are themselves con
ditioned by Western culture The same is true of all
the specialized disciplines which have developed in
the West they all reflect distinctively Western con
ceptions of rationality and the role of systematic
inquiry '' (Xir heritage affects our preconceptions
about the nature and function of scientific know
ledge as well as our preconceptions about values
and norms It is not too much to say that no person
can hope to understand who he or she is without
some understanding of the cultural context, handed
down from prior generations, in which he or she
presently exists Nobody lives, thinks, or talks in a
cultural void Nobody is exempt from cultural influ
ences Hence the peculiar importance of a general
requirement that students systematically examine
the cultural background which they all share
3 It is sometimes objected that a cultural re
quirement would put a premium on conformity to
accepted values We would suggest that the oppo
site is true The dangerous conformities are those
which are blind, unconscious, and uncritical Most
cultures breed rebels as well as conformists, as our

culture has. If a required course in Western culture
is designed (as above noted) to promote the accu
rate understanding of the Western orientation, the
result should be to make both rebels and confor
mists more dearly aware of what it is that they are
rejecting or accepting.
4. It has been objected that there is no reliable
evidence by which we can evaluate the effective
ness of general courses of the kind here envisaged;
hence they should not be required. We grant the
premise but reject the conclusion. The difficulty of
evaluation arises principally, we think, from the fact
that a good educational program has, or should
have, a long-term impact upon the student, and
such impacts are not precisely identifiable or quanti
fiable. To insist too much on precise evaluations
tends to put the emphasis on those short-term be
nefits and immediate satisfaction which can be as
certained, at the expense of the lasting benefits
which can be recognized, if at all, only in retrospect.
However this may be, the present objection cuts
both ways. If we cannot measure in advance the
precise effectiveness of a proposed requirement,
we cannot measure the relative effectiveness of a
program from which such requirements are omitted.
5. It has been claimed that students cannot be
made to learn what they do not wish to learn, or, as
last year s Council of ASSU Presidents put it, "You
can lead a student to a class but you can't make one
think." This position calls for clarification, because it
is highly ambiguous.
Much of what we learn from everyday experience
is not chosen, but forced upon us, often against our
wills, like learning that hot stoves can burn or that
careless driving invites serious accidents. With re
gard to required courses, the evidence is that many
generations of Stanford graduates found value in,
and claim to have profited from, the old course in
Western Civilization despite its having been pre
scribed. Many required courses in other colleges
and universities seem to have had substantial suc
cess. It is evident that the present objection is over
stated.
Perhaps we should interpret it to mean that stu
dents learn better when they study subjects which
they enjoy. There is some truth in this, but there is
also room for a serious confusion. One may enjoy
the process of studying a subject without liking or
approving the subject under study. A medical stu
dent, for example, does not normally enjoy or ap
prove of diseases A student of criminal behavior
does not normally enjoy or approve of crime. Such
students take satisfaction in learning how to cope
with the problems created by disease and crime. So
also a student of Western culture need not like or
approve of Western culture as such in order to find
satisfaction in making a study of it. If this distinction
is kept in mind, a further point emerges, namely, that
nobody can judge whether studying a given subject
will yield satisfaction or prove valuable to him until
after he has engaged in it. Students who view all
required courses as an infringement upon their
freedom of choice sometimes forget that freedom to
make informed choices is not the same as freedom
to make uninformed choices.
It used to be taken lor granted that if students
came to college, it was because they wished to be
made to think, this being accepted as an essential
part of a college education. The present argument,
however, introduces a distinction, as if students
were now saying: "Please give us an education, but
don't make us Slink — or at least, don't make us
think any more than we like or about topics we don't
like." Such a position, if taken seriously, would make
disciplined thinking peripheral rather than central to
the educational process, since disciplined thinking
is usually laborious and the habit of disciplined think
ing can only be acquired, like other skills, by sus
tained practice and fatiguing application.
Finally, it should be noted that when autonomy is
equated with negative freedom in Berlin's sense —
that is to say with freedom from restraints — and
when freedom from restraints is conceived as imply
ing freedom from any imposed norms or standards,
autonomy loses its value As Sartre showed in
Being and Nothingness, freedom without
guidelines is a burden; it is the freedom of the travel
ler lost in the jungle without a map, who can move in
any direction he wishes but has no basis for choos
ing one direction rather than another. From the
psychological point of view, this kind of freedom
results either in existential despair or in a kind of
narcissism which, valuing only sensations and ple
asures of the moment, and fearing the restraint of
any firm commitments, ends by trivalizing the very
pleasures it claims to prize. l 2 It also serves to de
stroy community with others; cooperation among
individuals is impossible where there are no com
monly accepted standards of acceptable and unac
ceptable behavior, because nobody can count on
what others will do. And even the ideal of universal
brotherhood is weakened if it is taken to imply free
dom from any concrete responsibilities to any par
ticular human beings 13
In a society where catchwords tend to replace
critical inquiry, words like freedom' and autonomy
take on a life of their own and acquire a special
emotional force, as if they represented absolute
goods. If autonomy is valuable, we easily assume
that the more autonomy we have the better off we
are, and that a condition of unlimited autonomy must
be best of all But such is not the case Individual
freedom and autonomy are vitally important as in
strumental goods, but to convert them into absolute
goods is to destroy their function.
V
In the foregoing section we have argued that re
quirements, far from being an evil, are, in fact,
necessary for the purposes of a liberal education
Here we may be more specific about requirements
at Stanford.
The Stanford undergraduate curriculum currentty
includes two requirements One is that of the Major,
based on the pnnciple of study in depth This re
quirement was re-examined and reaffirmed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (Campus
Report, 130ct. 1976, p.B). The other is the recently
redefined Distnbution Requirement wtiich aims to
provide the breadth of study necessary for a liberal
eAjcation to yield "a richer personal life through the
development of spaciousness of mind and spirit
The Distribution Requirements exist to ensure ex
posure to different ideas and different ways of think
ing They should enable (one) to understand better
the major ways of knowing,' to assess their
strengths and limitations, to appreciate their un
iqueness, and no less importantly to discern what
they have in common" (DRAT, p 21).
Under the present system, work in the three re
quired areas entails the study of certain works of
creative imagination in their cultural and histoncal
contexts, or of certain problems of philosophy and
belief (Humanities); the study of society, social in
stitutions. and human behavior (Social Saences);
and the study of natural phenomena, technology,
and math (NS/M/T) The stress in each area is upon
approaches, scholarly methods, and the general
human significance of the vanous kinds of study In
addition, for each area, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommends development of
groups of correlated courses; in Humanities the
courses chosen to fulfil the requirement must form a
group which can be certified" by the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (directly approved by the Dean
if the group is chosen by a student, indirectly, if set
up by a department)
The pnnaple of breadth is thus fulfilled by requir

ing a certain amount of study in the three areas into
which human knowledge has been conveniently di
vided. Vet, within each area, a different principle of
order is invoked, and a broad, comprehensive out
look is neither required nor encouraged Moreover,
no principles are stated for the organization of cor re
lated groups or "sequences" within the areas. Nor
has advice been given to departments on the ways
in which they should, in practice, "group" their own
courses or correlate them with courses in other de
partments
In addition, students have not been advised about
the designing of a Humanities program which might
be acceptable to the Doan. Much of the "freedom"
prescribed by SES was predicated on the assump
tion that undergraduate advising, especially for un
declared majors (freshman and sophomore years),
would be vigorous and that the "strongly recom
mended" alternatives and choices would be made
under vigilant academic guidance. Unfortunately,
the faculty, as advisors, cannot peiform the neces
sary academic surveillance given the laissoz fain)
philosophy of the present system.
This loosely structured program may have some
merit in that it recognizes the validity of both syn
chronic and diachronic methods of study, however,
it is impractical and unwittingly misleading. A stu
dent can easily justify the coherence of a group of
three courses, on say, the liteiature, art and society
of fifth-century Athens, or that of a group embracing
the three story-tellers Homer, Dorothy Richardson
and Dostoyevsky, or even that of any three courses
taught by an individual professor.
Are these two requirements — Major and Dis
tribution — an adequate foundation for a liberal
education? We feel that they are not. The student
certainly needs the intellectual methods proper to
the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences which the Distribution Requirement is
supposed to provide. But a good liberal education
has to be more comprehensive. It must include
some systematic study of the fundamental nature
and development of the culture and civilization
within which the student is living and to which he will
someday contribute. It must also provide basic in
formation about the complexities of modern society,
the means to analyse and evaluate that society, and
the perspective necessary to judge it on a compara
tive basis. In addition, the student should have some
knowledge of a culture remote from his own — a
culture outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition, suc h
as Greek or Asian — which will confront him with
ideas that challenge his unconscious assumptions
about his own time and place.
Many who agree in principle with such educa
tional ideals feel that they cannot be achieved. We
disagree. This is a university rich in teaching re
sources which has demonstrated on other occa
sions an ability to make sensible and worthwhile
educational innovations when they have been
needed. They are needed now. Departments and
individual instructors are well-equipped to deal with
the task at hand, and we should certainly draw on
our excellent teaching resources.
The Report of the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford has
suggested certain specific ways in which, through a
program of "tracks," undergraduate education
could achieve the strength and the focus it lacks at
the moment. The Report also mentions the desira
bility of historical and comparative studies whereby
modern Western culture can be confr onted not only
with past stages of its development, but also with
manifestations of other cultures. The program en
visioned by the Report is based partly on existing
courses covering the Western tradition. This prog
ram would allow the student to choose among four
approaches — literature and language; history; re
ligion and philosophy, or the creative and perform
ing arts — all leading to the same goal. This ap
proach would give to each student an educational
program more coherent than the present one.
The appropriate authorities — the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, the Doan of Undar
graduate Studies, the Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (where most under
graduate teaching takes place) — must now de
velop a plan for providing, either through new
courses or through the adaptation of existing
courses, a method for satisfying the educational
needs we have outlined. Those authorities should
also consider how that plan, when in operation,
could be monitored effectively T he responsibility
our University has to its undergraduates and the
obligation it has to its reputation demands that such
action be taken promptly.
Having outlined our views in this general stato
ment, we intend to publish in the next few months a
series of position papers suggesting concrete im
provements to undergraduate education at Stan
ford.

For approximately one year, a group o
humanities faculty members, gathering together tc
discuss issues of mutual concern, has debated the
merits of the present structure of the undergraduate
curriculum at Stanford. Events both local and na
tional have encouraged this sustained debate. The
group has had, moreover, the opportunity to hear, al
its informal sessions, the opinions of some of the
' officers of the University who could be expected to
play key roles in the elaboration of the under
graduate curnculum in future years. Among these
officers have been the President, the Dean ol
Humanities and Sciences, the Dean of Under
gracfcjate Studies, and the Dean of Admissions.
What herewith follows is not necessarily a reflec
tion of the attitudes of any one of these officers, nor
of any one faculty member Rather, the group as a
whole would now like to offer to the campus com
munity a statement bearing on the design of that
curnculum. The group recognizes that it possesses
neither final wisdom nor institutional authority in
matters such as these; it also recognizes that exten
sive planning remains to be done before revisions in
the curriculum can be addopted
The group speaks, however, with a sense ol
urgency. It is satisfied neither with the quality of the
intellectual life, nor with the goals and standards of
the undergraduate program. It believes, moreover,
that dissatisfaction, at times expressed and at other
times muted, is a sentiment shared by many faculty
members at Stanford. Nor is such a condition
merely local. Discussion within the group has been
enlivened in the past year by the clear recognition
that the problems Stanford now faces (and must
rigorously attempt to resolve) are problems affect
ing every prestigious institution of higher learning.
That the problems are national in their dimensions is
indicated by, among other things, the special
1974-75 issues of Daedalus (Journal of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences) wherein
eighty-four distinguished educators, including sev
eral from Stanford, speak to the conditions now
defining academic life. Differences among these
educators are certainly present, but all are
frightened, as the editor says, "by what they see as
a lack of concern for intellectual values, others worry
about what they think to be a reduced social con
sciousness." The perspective in which this deep
concern, on both the national level and the local
level, takes place is more serious, of course, than
the question of which course or courses must be
required of the undergraduate. It is more serious
than any particular detail. But details and particulars
will, at the appropriate moment, play their crucial
part when revisions in the curriculum are proposed
and then established. The editor of Daedalus de
scribes the newly emergent situation not as "a re
petition of the discussion that occurred in the middle
of the nineteenth century when a rigid, classically
oriented college curriculum was challenged by the
new theoretical and applied sciences. Much more is
at stake today; the continued viability of the concept
of the liberally-educated person is involved."
About the continued viability the Stanford com
munity has the deepest obligation to be concerned.
In the immediate past, that concern has been ex
pressed by the Report of the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stan
ford. The spirit of that Report, in which a clear com
mitment to a requirement in Western Culture is af
firmed, must be sustained and nourished. Hence
the informal Humanities and Sciences group is
happy to note that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has recently, and unanimously, also en
dorsed "the principle that studies in Western Culture
should be part of each student's education."
Discussions within the group have also been in
vigorated by the understanding that the problems
Stanford now faces are not purely national but are
Stanford's own This university must fulfill the spe
cial obligations it has as a private institution, of great
prestige, within a state and a geography dominated
by non-private institutions Its mission has been,
and is, special; so can be the quality of its under
graduate education. To this obligation President
Richard W. Lyman has often spoken, and most tel
lingly speaks in the pages of Daedalus, where he
says
We who are responsible for the continuing
health of our "little platoons" — and even
the greatest of the private universities are
"little platoons" when matched against the
dimensions of state-supported higher edu
cation — we have our work cut out for us...
one virture that ought to be within the reach
of independent institutions, be they old or
new, famous or obscure, is that of rigorous
self-definition.
It is to that rigor arte 1 that self-definition that Stan
ford's attention must now turn Prompted, then, by
both the national anxiety and concern, and opposed
to the idle, helpless notion that little can be done in
the face of curricular and intellectual complexity, this
statement is offered to the Stanford community It is
hoped that it will play some effective part in discus
sions within the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
and the Academic Senate.
The pnnciples underlying the 1968 Study of Edu
cation at Stanford are treated here first. That Study
predates the Report of the Committee on the Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
and by virtue of the seriousness and thoughtfulness
with which it was undertaken, has achieved a con
siderable weight in later discussions of curricular
reform But as the Study itself observes, its spirit
was one of "self-examination and self-renewal." It
further observes that "the study of education must
become a process rather than event." Eight years
have since passed: changes now seem wholly
proper and necessary In the light, then, of such
changes to be made, a second matter for discussion
follows the first It is a consideration of the newly
formulated system of distnbution requirements. Al
though that system is the product of much labor on
the part of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, it does not coherently and directly address
the fundamental inadequacies of the present cur
ncular program for the undergraduate student, it is a
system that is too diffuse and too loosely monitored
to be able to do so Only by a program that is more
coherently structured can the mtellecuual life of the
Stanford student be made more challenging, in
tense, and rewarding
II
The basic philosophy of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). published in 1968-69, was that of
educational laissez fairs This is reflected in two
parallel pronouncements, the first of which ap
peared in the general introductory section of the
report and the second in the section on under
graduate education
"Let fie objectrve of curncular planning be
to encourage the faculty member to teach
what he likes to teach and the student to
learn what seems vital to him — the Intellec
tual History of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century rather than the History of Western
Civilization Modern Consciousness rather
than Freshman English. Organizational Be
havior rather than Introduction to Sociology
— and from this common freedom may
emerge a form of general education far bet
ter suited to the cftaractennbcs of a umver
slty than that to which we pay lip service

now." (Vol. I, p. 14)
And again:
"The objective toward which curriculum
planning should strive is, to the extent pos
sible, to let the teacher teach what he wants
to teach and the student learn what he
wants to learn." (Vol. II, p. 12)
Now philosophies of laissez faire can be arrived at
in different ways and supported or defended on
different grounds. Having in mind Isaiah Berlin's
significant distinction between positive and negative
conceptions of freedom — possitive freedom being
freedom for the achievement of some end deemed
desirable, negative freedom being freedom from
restraint on the assumption that restraint is wrong in
itself 1 — we can roughly distinguish between posi
tive and negative philosophies of laissez faire.
Adam Smith's views concerning economic be
havior were positive in this sense, not because they
were necessarily correct, but because they were
based on extensive inquiries into the nature of
wealth, the nature of human motivation and be
havior, and a clear belief in the desirability of the
conditions to which he thought a free market
economy would contribute. One may, of course,
quarrel with his views, but the fact remains that he
had a carefully worked out theory of social welfare
and advocated free enterprise as the best means of
achieving it. It is not inconceivable that a positive
doctrine of educational laissez faire might be simi
larly grounded on some carefully worked out and
coherent theory of the objectives, functions, and
social impact of higher education. But SES failed to
provide any such theory Instead it provided a nega
tive philosophy of laissez faire based on the view
that in higher education, restraints of any kind are
inherently bad. Moreover, this view was itself based
on a curiously narrow and dubious line of argument
which calls for special attention and comment.
The SES committee took the position that it ought
to base its "proposed reponses to the problems of
education at Stanford on careful consideration of
the meaning of education for individual teacher and
student and of the nature of the university" (Vol. I, p.
8). So far, so good. But it then proceeded to deal
with these questions, not by considering the general
objectives, functions and possible impact of higher
education in and on today's society, nor by consider
ing the important "new dimensions" which it had
cited in the opening sentence of its report as having
been introduced by the student unrest of the 1960's.
Instead, the Committee attempted to deal with all
these questions by the simple expedient of examin
ing the etymology of the single world, education '
The Committee established its "basic premises" i

as follows:
To establish our basic premises we must
begin with our conceptions of education and
of a university. The world 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educere meaning to
lead forth.' To lead does not mean to com
pel, or to push, or to pull. It means quite
simply what it says.. (1,10)
On this foundation it was immediately concluded
(among other things) that education "can never be
compelled nor can knowledge be impressed on a
mind unwilling to learn if it is to be more than indoc
trination'' (I, 10). It was also inferred (without any
corresponding concern for the etymology of the
word "university") that "the University can nevei
educate in the true sense of the word, but it can
supply the environment and the means necessary
to insure that those who came here may educate
each other and themselves'' (I, 10). In short, like a
pyramid balanced upon its apex, the weight of the
whole report seems to have rested upon the pre
sumed etymology of the word educate.'
The deficiences of this approach are obvious:
1 Words change their meanings. Hence even i
this particular etymology were adequately stated, i
could give no more than a tentative and partial hin
as to the present meaning of the word "education."
2. Given a complex enterprise like that of moderr
education, many different words are involved. If we
are to rely on etymology, we ought surely to con
sider also the etymologies of a variety of other En
glish words which are relevant to education, such as
learning, training, study, scholarship, instruction,
teaching, tutoring, lecturing, research, etc. These
would yield different results, reflecting the simple
fact that education has many facets, and dimen
sions, which cannot be captured by looking at any
simplified etymology of any single word.
3. On the Latin side, we should note first that in
addition to the verb educere (3rd conjugation) on
which the SES committee chose to rely, there was
another related Latin verb, educare (Ist conjuga
tion) meaning 'to train, to rear, to bring up ' It is from
the latter (and its nouneducatfo) that our word edu
cation' is most immediately derived. Secondly, the
Romans had several other verbs which they applied
to the process of education, including instituere,
instruere, and erudire. None of these suggests to
lead forth ; the first two suggested the idea of estab
lishing,' constructing' or setting in order, while the
last implied making smooth.'
Thus the committee's central line of argument —
the first among its "basic premises" — must be
rejected as wholly misconceived This fact does not,
of course, necessarily refute the laissez faire
philosophy which the committee derived from it; as
previously observed, that philosophy might con
ceivably be supported on other grounds. However,
since no other basis was supplied, the committee's
general conclusion stands unsupported. We are left
with, at best, a negative theory of laissez faire — a
theory which might as well have been adopted out of
sheer inertia or even from an impulse to deflate
student po'itical demands by making educational
concessions 2 On this view, educational restraints
are wrong primarily because they are burdensome
and because they are disliked. Eliminating require
ments is good because freedom is good, in and of
itself If teachers are free to teach what they want to
teach and students are free to learn what they want
to leam, we may trust that everybody will benefit and
that the proper interests of society will be served
111
The question now is whether that trust has been
vindicated or discredited The indications are
mounting that it has been discredited — that the kind
of educational laissez faire recommended by the
SES report has already been found seriously defi
cient Several emerging difficulties call for particular
attention.
1 The problem of standards
Derek Bok, President of Harvard University (and
a Stanford alumnus) began a recent article "On the
Purposes of Undergraduate Education' (Daedalus.
Fall, 1974, pp 159-172) as follows
"Scholars who study the behavior of
human organizations constantly stress the
importance of defining institutional goals
Without dear objectives, it is said, an mstitu
tion cannot evaluate how well it is perform
ing, decide how to allocate its resources
wisely, plan for future growth, motivate its
members, or justify its existence to the
larger public
"Despite these admonitions, our colleges
seem to exist without making much of an
effort to define their aims In the thick reports
on undergraduate education that many col
leges have produced in recent years, there
is little discuMion of what it is that a liberal
arts education should provide for me stu-

dent. The prevailing sentiment is captured
by the statement of a curriculum committee
in one of our most distinguished univer
sities: The objective toward which cur
riculum planning should strive is, to the ex
tent possible, to let the teacher teach what
he wants to teach and the student learn
t what he wants to learn.' "
It should be noted lhat the concluding sentence,
cited as exemplifying a prevalent defiaency, is bor
rowed from the SES report; it is the second of the
two excerpts quoted at the beginning of this paper
Bok's point is that the SES philosophy of laissez
faire provides no standards for directing or evaluat
ing any aspect of the academic enterprise, or judg
ing academic performance. If the controlling objec
tive is to allow teachers and students to do whatever
they prefer, why should the university not provide
instruction in basketweaving? If it be replied that
accepted standards of academic excellence and
competence are assumed, the question arises
where such standards originate and how they are
maintained. To the extent that they are needed, the
laissez faire philosophy is thereby shown to be in
adequate
It is one thing to maintain that teachers should
enjoy teaching and that students should enjoy learn
ing, but it is something else to say that immediate
enjoyment — which can vary according to the fash
ions of the day — is to be taken as the primary
measure of academic success. It is perhaps worth
remarking that while the SES report relied on Alfred
North Whitehead's observation that the University's
justification is to preserve "the connection between
knowledge and the zest of life, by uniting the young
and the old in the imaginative consideration of learn
ing" (SES, I, 10) it failed to note that in the same
essay (as well as elsewhere in his writings on edu
cation) Whitehead stressed the need for a "discip
line of imagination" so that the superior vigor of the
young should be tempered by the superior experi
ence of the elders. The persistent problem of educa
tion, in Whitehead's view, is to combine discipline
and imagination so that neither destroys the other.
In his words, "qualities essential at a later stage of a
career are apt to be stamped out in an earlier stage
This is only an instance of the more general fact, that
technical excellence can only be acquired by a train
ing which is apt to damage those energies of mind
which should direct the technical skill. This is the key
fact in education, and the reason for most of its
difficulties." 3
2. Problems of specialization and vocationalism
The Harvard report of 1945, General Education in
a Free Society, probably the most widely influential t
report on higher issued in the decadea
immediate following World War II, devoted most of
its attention to a discussion of the purposes and
functions of education in a free society, "It is fruit
less," the Harvard committee wrote, "to think about
any such practical step as a curriculum without hav
ing in mind specifications or points of reference, in
this case the ends toward which the curriculum
should look and the students for whom it is in
tended." 4
The main problems of education were there attri
buted to three sources: first, the progressive expan
sion of knowledge with the attendant multiplication
of specialisms and sub-specialisms in all areas;
second, the great increase in the number of college
students as opportunities for education beyond the
high-school were extended from the privileged few
and made available to young people at large; and
third, to the increasing complexity of modern society
itself. To cope with these problems, the Harvard
committee felt that education at the college level
ought to perform a dual role. It must, on the one
hand, fully recognize the need for increasing
specialization and provide a foundation for students
going on to careers or vocations requiring particular
skills in diverse areas. But it must at the same time
seek to balance the fragmentation and atomization
threatened by the multiplication of specialties by
finding some unifying dimension or dimensions. It
was concluded that the latter function required re
newed stress on the sort of education that had been
traditionally called "liberal education," specifically
the kind of education designed to develop the
natural capacities of the student as a human being
regardless of the particular social role which he or
she might subsequently fill. "Our conclusion, then,"
wrote the Harvard committee in 1945," is that the
aim of education should be to prepare an individual
to become an expert both in some particular voca
tion or art and in the general art of the free man and
the citizen. Thus the two kinds of education once
given separately to different social classes must be
given to all alike." 5
These views are cited not to suggest that the
curricular innovations recommended by the Har
vard committee in 1945 accomplished their purpose
(which is open to serious debate) but to show that
the committee identified — and tried to meet —
three problems which became more and more pres
sing in the ensuing years Among these, the con
tinued multiplication of specialisms with spreading
emphasis on the importance to the student of de
veloping marketable skills, at a high level of sophis
tication, has proved perhaps the most intractable
One way to deal with this problem is, of course, to do
nothing — to drift with the prevailing current rather
than attempt to swim against it. The SES report, with
its philosophy of laissez faire, does exactly that
Since increasing specialism is the order of the day.
and since competent scholars are specialists, it can
be claimed, "realism" dictates that we accept that
fact, adapting our education to it and letting
threatened dangers take care of themselves But
some of those threatened dangers have already
become actual.

(i) As the opinion spreads that the main function of
higher education is to develop in the student mar
ketable skills — what Steven Miller, President of
Johns Hopkins, calls "higher skilling" as opposed to
higher education 8 — for a job market which is al
ready oversaturated, the value of a college educa
tion is necessanly depreciated. If it were recog
nized, however, that the chief function of a college
education is to develop the human potential of the
student without regard to the particular job he or she
might eventually hold or the particular social role he
or she might occupy, the result would be otherwise
Success or failure in the job market would not be
considered so crucial There is here an illustration of
the point made before, that the objectives (or sup
posed objectives) of education always provide the
criteria for evaluating success or failure
(ii) In regard to the nature and status if knowledge,
Steven Muller, in the article just mentioned, asked
the pregnant question If all our scholars are stand
ing at the frontiers of knowledge, who is standing at
the center? Is there today any center? If not, how
can there be any community of scholars in the tradi
tional sense?
Under present conditions, there is no genuine
community of teachers or students in any college or
university, but rather an aggregate of specialists
and students, each pursuing his or her own sepa
rate interests in geographical proximity, with little or
no basis for cross-disciplinary communication or
understanding One consequence is that most scho
lars feel more affinity with, and more respect for,
their professional colleagues in other universities
than for members of other departments in their own
And there is no longer any unity of knowledge, but
only a collocation of separate knowledges Such a
situation may. perhaps, be defended certainly it is
preferable to an ideological uniformity arbitrarily im
posed But surety there is a middle ground between

these extremes. Muller considers that some return
to general education, with universal requirements
for English, for a second language, for cultural his
tory, and for science, is necessary to restore the
un 'ty of genuine education.
What all our scholars in different disciplines have
in common is that they are all human beings, that
they all share the same cultural inheritance, and that
they are all engaged (or should be) in the same
quest — the quest for greater knowledge and wider
understanding. And we do well, we believe, to recall
the observation of Arthur Lovejoy that he who knows
only his own special field may not know what is most
worth looking lor in his special field. 7
#ii) An extensive investigation recently conducted
byktwo ecfcjcation reporters of the Los Angeles
Tunes into the concurrent phenomena of progres
sive grade inflation along with progressive decline in
the average level of students' proficiency has been
the widespread substitution of new elective
oourses, sometimes lacking in academic rigor, for
the kind of basic courses which used to be required
for all students. 8 Though the demonstration is not
conclusive, it is at least persuasively documented
As against suggestions that the decline in test
scores is due to other causes — such as altered
family structures, the increased number of less qual
ified students, regional factors, or the unreliability of
test scores — the authors of the report point out that
the two areas where test scores have not declined
but held steady or advanced are the areas in which
basic requirements have been largely retained, i.e.,
in the first three primary grades in school and in the
sciences at post-secondary level. These investiga
tions, which are too long to summanze, are worth
senous attention. At least, they cannot be ignored,
despite the attempts of some educators to dismiss
or discount them.
(iv) There is clear evidence that college students
today resent the increasingly competitive atmos
phere of post-secondary education. 9 It seems to be
a fair inference that the competitive aspect reflects
the increasing emphasis in higher education upon
the development of marketable skills. When stu
dents are competing for entrance to professional
schools or for jobs requiring technical proficiency,
and when good grades are seen as important for
Stich purposes, the process of college education
naturally comes to be seen as a struggle of each
against all; for admission to a limited number of
'ftllure positions. But liberal education, in the tradi
tional sense, has a different character. The
philosopher Spinoza pointed out that intellectual
goods sought for their own sake are non-
C9mpetitive. If one person achieves wisdom or in
creased insight, he is not threatened but reinforced
if his neighbors do likewise. Here is one major dif
ference between virtues of character and technical
skills, at least where the latter determine job oppor
tunities. Nothing is so useful or agreeable to the
virtuous man, Spinoza wrote, as the company of
others who are like-minded. Where self-realization
or self-improvement is the aim rather than voca
tional proficiency — as is the case with liberal edu
cation — emulation can be a spur without being a
threat. And the community of scholars, for teachers
and students alike, rests upon such a foundation
Thef search for "higher skilling" is centrifugal; the
search for liberal education is centripetal. A student
whose aim is self-development or self-improvement
as a human being values grades only as indications
of his own progress, not for any advantage they may
give over others.

(v) As our society becomes increasingly complex,
as specialisms multiply, and as it becomes increas
ingly apparent that the most serious problems ex
tend over many diciplines, it follows, as Professor
Gabriel Almond has observed, that "only higher
order philosophical syntheses can spell out the big
issues and formulate alternative solutions." 10 At the
same time, our society is becoming more and more
susceptible at all levels to the pull of simplistic slo
gans, catchwords, images, stereotypes and
counter-stereotypes. In this situation the need for
critical intelligence and balanced judgment is be
coming more and more acute, yet this need is not
likely to be apparent to the beginning student, par
ticularly if he is bent on acquiring some particular
skill. The SES report quoted approvingly an obser
vation of Professor Edwin M. Good to the effect that
the important simplicities are those which lie "on the
other side of complexity" (Vol. I, p. 11). Surely the
proper inference is that today's student, seeking tp
pick his way through the growing thicket of com
plexities towards some thoughtful and balanced
overview — as opposed to the delusive simplicities
offered by catchwords and fashionable stereotypes
— needs more guidance and direction than ever
before. The claim of the SES committee that today's
student is in a better position than anybody else to
choose the academic path he will take (Vol. I. p. 15)
seems like saying that the thicker the forest be
comes, the less need there is to require would-be
travellers to take a guide.
IV
Recommendations for achieving the aims of lib
eral education generally envisage imposed re
quirements covenng, in addition to courses in En
glish and in a foreign language, a required course or
courses in Western culture or the history of ideas
We are not concerned here with particular prog
rams, but with the sort of objections most commonly
raised against imposing such requirements.
1. It is often claimed that a required course in
Western culture or the history of ideas in the West is
chauvinistic, since it implies the superiority of the
Western tradition above other traditions The objec
tion is misconceived The purpose of studying the
Western tradition is not to celebrate it but to under
stand It — for good or ill. To evaluate Western
culture, or any other culture, without first making the
effort to understand it is to judge irrationally without
adequate evidence Many people make this very
mistake, but the fact that the mistake is common
affords a good reason for trying to correct it.
2. It is often claimed that requiring students to
study any particular subject is arbitrary because no
particular subject is intrinsically more important than
any other One might, so the argument goes, make
as good a case for general requirement in, say,
psychology or the scientific study of human be
havior The answer here is that all heirs of the West
ern tradition — whether specialists or generalists,
students or faculty, regardless of their special in
terests and capacities — are themselves con
ditioned by Western culture The same is true of all
the specialized disciplines which have developed in
the West they all reflect distinctively Western con
ceptions of rationality and the role of systematic
inquiry '' (Xir heritage affects our preconceptions
about the nature and function of scientific know
ledge as well as our preconceptions about values
and norms It is not too much to say that no person
can hope to understand who he or she is without
some understanding of the cultural context, handed
down from prior generations, in which he or she
presently exists Nobody lives, thinks, or talks in a
cultural void Nobody is exempt from cultural influ
ences Hence the peculiar importance of a general
requirement that students systematically examine
the cultural background which they all share
3 It is sometimes objected that a cultural re
quirement would put a premium on conformity to
accepted values We would suggest that the oppo
site is true The dangerous conformities are those
which are blind, unconscious, and uncritical Most
cultures breed rebels as well as conformists, as our

culture has. If a required course in Western culture
is designed (as above noted) to promote the accu
rate understanding of the Western orientation, the
result should be to make both rebels and confor
mists more dearly aware of what it is that they are
rejecting or accepting.
4. It has been objected that there is no reliable
evidence by which we can evaluate the effective
ness of general courses of the kind here envisaged;
hence they should not be required. We grant the
premise but reject the conclusion. The difficulty of
evaluation arises principally, we think, from the fact
that a good educational program has, or should
have, a long-term impact upon the student, and
such impacts are not precisely identifiable or quanti
fiable. To insist too much on precise evaluations
tends to put the emphasis on those short-term be
nefits and immediate satisfaction which can be as
certained, at the expense of the lasting benefits
which can be recognized, if at all, only in retrospect.
However this may be, the present objection cuts
both ways. If we cannot measure in advance the
precise effectiveness of a proposed requirement,
we cannot measure the relative effectiveness of a
program from which such requirements are omitted.
5. It has been claimed that students cannot be
made to learn what they do not wish to learn, or, as
last year s Council of ASSU Presidents put it, "You
can lead a student to a class but you can't make one
think." This position calls for clarification, because it
is highly ambiguous.
Much of what we learn from everyday experience
is not chosen, but forced upon us, often against our
wills, like learning that hot stoves can burn or that
careless driving invites serious accidents. With re
gard to required courses, the evidence is that many
generations of Stanford graduates found value in,
and claim to have profited from, the old course in
Western Civilization despite its having been pre
scribed. Many required courses in other colleges
and universities seem to have had substantial suc
cess. It is evident that the present objection is over
stated.
Perhaps we should interpret it to mean that stu
dents learn better when they study subjects which
they enjoy. There is some truth in this, but there is
also room for a serious confusion. One may enjoy
the process of studying a subject without liking or
approving the subject under study. A medical stu
dent, for example, does not normally enjoy or ap
prove of diseases A student of criminal behavior
does not normally enjoy or approve of crime. Such
students take satisfaction in learning how to cope
with the problems created by disease and crime. So
also a student of Western culture need not like or
approve of Western culture as such in order to find
satisfaction in making a study of it. If this distinction
is kept in mind, a further point emerges, namely, that
nobody can judge whether studying a given subject
will yield satisfaction or prove valuable to him until
after he has engaged in it. Students who view all
required courses as an infringement upon their
freedom of choice sometimes forget that freedom to
make informed choices is not the same as freedom
to make uninformed choices.
It used to be taken lor granted that if students
came to college, it was because they wished to be
made to think, this being accepted as an essential
part of a college education. The present argument,
however, introduces a distinction, as if students
were now saying: "Please give us an education, but
don't make us Slink — or at least, don't make us
think any more than we like or about topics we don't
like." Such a position, if taken seriously, would make
disciplined thinking peripheral rather than central to
the educational process, since disciplined thinking
is usually laborious and the habit of disciplined think
ing can only be acquired, like other skills, by sus
tained practice and fatiguing application.
Finally, it should be noted that when autonomy is
equated with negative freedom in Berlin's sense —
that is to say with freedom from restraints — and
when freedom from restraints is conceived as imply
ing freedom from any imposed norms or standards,
autonomy loses its value As Sartre showed in
Being and Nothingness, freedom without
guidelines is a burden; it is the freedom of the travel
ler lost in the jungle without a map, who can move in
any direction he wishes but has no basis for choos
ing one direction rather than another. From the
psychological point of view, this kind of freedom
results either in existential despair or in a kind of
narcissism which, valuing only sensations and ple
asures of the moment, and fearing the restraint of
any firm commitments, ends by trivalizing the very
pleasures it claims to prize. l 2 It also serves to de
stroy community with others; cooperation among
individuals is impossible where there are no com
monly accepted standards of acceptable and unac
ceptable behavior, because nobody can count on
what others will do. And even the ideal of universal
brotherhood is weakened if it is taken to imply free
dom from any concrete responsibilities to any par
ticular human beings 13
In a society where catchwords tend to replace
critical inquiry, words like freedom' and autonomy
take on a life of their own and acquire a special
emotional force, as if they represented absolute
goods. If autonomy is valuable, we easily assume
that the more autonomy we have the better off we
are, and that a condition of unlimited autonomy must
be best of all But such is not the case Individual
freedom and autonomy are vitally important as in
strumental goods, but to convert them into absolute
goods is to destroy their function.

In the foregoing section we have argued that re
quirements, far from being an evil, are, in fact,
necessary for the purposes of a liberal education
Here we may be more specific about requirements
at Stanford.
The Stanford undergraduate curriculum currentty
includes two requirements One is that of the Major,
based on the pnnciple of study in depth This re
quirement was re-examined and reaffirmed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (Campus
Report, 130ct. 1976, p.B). The other is the recently
redefined Distnbution Requirement wtiich aims to
provide the breadth of study necessary for a liberal
eAjcation to yield "a richer personal life through the
development of spaciousness of mind and spirit
The Distribution Requirements exist to ensure ex
posure to different ideas and different ways of think
ing They should enable (one) to understand better
the major ways of knowing,' to assess their
strengths and limitations, to appreciate their un
iqueness, and no less importantly to discern what
they have in common" (DRAT, p 21).
Under the present system, work in the three re
quired areas entails the study of certain works of
creative imagination in their cultural and histoncal
contexts, or of certain problems of philosophy and
belief (Humanities); the study of society, social in
stitutions. and human behavior (Social Saences);
and the study of natural phenomena, technology,
and math (NS/M/T) The stress in each area is upon
approaches, scholarly methods, and the general
human significance of the vanous kinds of study In
addition, for each area, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommends development of
groups of correlated courses; in Humanities the
courses chosen to fulfil the requirement must form a
group which can be certified" by the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (directly approved by the Dean
if the group is chosen by a student, indirectly, if set
up by a department)
The pnnaple of breadth is thus fulfilled by requir

ing a certain amount of study in the three areas into
which human knowledge has been conveniently di
vided. Vet, within each area, a different principle of
order is invoked, and a broad, comprehensive out
look is neither required nor encouraged Moreover,
no principles are stated for the organization of cor re
lated groups or "sequences" within the areas. Nor
has advice been given to departments on the ways
in which they should, in practice, "group" their own
courses or correlate them with courses in other de
partments
In addition, students have not been advised about
the designing of a Humanities program which might
be acceptable to the Doan. Much of the "freedom"
prescribed by SES was predicated on the assump
tion that undergraduate advising, especially for un
declared majors (freshman and sophomore years),
would be vigorous and that the "strongly recom
mended" alternatives and choices would be made
under vigilant academic guidance. Unfortunately,
the faculty, as advisors, cannot peiform the neces
sary academic surveillance given the laissoz fain)
philosophy of the present system.
This loosely structured program may have some
merit in that it recognizes the validity of both syn
chronic and diachronic methods of study, however,
it is impractical and unwittingly misleading. A stu
dent can easily justify the coherence of a group of
three courses, on say, the liteiature, art and society
of fifth-century Athens, or that of a group embracing
the three story-tellers Homer, Dorothy Richardson
and Dostoyevsky, or even that of any three courses
taught by an individual professor.
Are these two requirements — Major and Dis
tribution — an adequate foundation for a liberal
education? We feel that they are not. The student
certainly needs the intellectual methods proper to
the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences which the Distribution Requirement is
supposed to provide. But a good liberal education
has to be more comprehensive. It must include
some systematic study of the fundamental nature
and development of the culture and civilization
within which the student is living and to which he will
someday contribute. It must also provide basic in
formation about the complexities of modern society,
the means to analyse and evaluate that society, and
the perspective necessary to judge it on a compara
tive basis. In addition, the student should have some
knowledge of a culture remote from his own — a
culture outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition, suc h
as Greek or Asian — which will confront him with
ideas that challenge his unconscious assumptions
about his own time and place.
Many who agree in principle with such educa
tional ideals feel that they cannot be achieved. We
disagree. This is a university rich in teaching re
sources which has demonstrated on other occa
sions an ability to make sensible and worthwhile
educational innovations when they have been
needed. They are needed now. Departments and
individual instructors are well-equipped to deal with
the task at hand, and we should certainly draw on
our excellent teaching resources.
The Report of the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford has
suggested certain specific ways in which, through a
program of "tracks," undergraduate education
could achieve the strength and the focus it lacks at
the moment. The Report also mentions the desira
bility of historical and comparative studies whereby
modern Western culture can be confr onted not only
with past stages of its development, but also with
manifestations of other cultures. The program en
visioned by the Report is based partly on existing
courses covering the Western tradition. This prog
ram would allow the student to choose among four
approaches — literature and language; history; re
ligion and philosophy, or the creative and perform
ing arts — all leading to the same goal. This ap
proach would give to each student an educational
program more coherent than the present one.
The appropriate authorities — the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, the Doan of Undar
graduate Studies, the Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (where most under
graduate teaching takes place) — must now de
velop a plan for providing, either through new
courses or through the adaptation of existing
courses, a method for satisfying the educational
needs we have outlined. Those authorities should
also consider how that plan, when in operation,
could be monitored effectively T he responsibility
our University has to its undergraduates and the
obligation it has to its reputation demands that such
action be taken promptly.
Having outlined our views in this general stato
ment, we intend to publish in the next few months a
series of position papers suggesting concrete im
provements to undergraduate education at Stan
ford.
