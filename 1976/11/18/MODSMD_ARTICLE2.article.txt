The ASSIJ Guest Professorship
Hoard is compiling a list of possible
guest professors for this spring quarter
and is accepting suggestions from the
student body at large, according to
John Reinke. a member of the board.
Reinke said, "People have com
plained a lot about the supposedly rad
ical nature of the professors selected
last year." 1 le said that the board could
not say if there will be a greater balance
between radical and more conserva

tive professors this year.
The balance "depends on what
names are suggested and on who we
can get a hold of. We just can't say,"
said Reinke.
"The radicals are the ones who usu
ally are out of a job. so they're more
likely to come. And they tend to ask for
less money," he added.
Gerald Ford
Reinke said that the board may
invite President Gerald Ford to teach
here. "Ford's name has been kicked
around. 1 le'll be out of a job. so I don't

know. Actually, I'd rather not say.
We'll wait for student input," he said.
Board member Bill Tyndall said that
the selection "criteria aren't political.
They're apolitical. We select the best
people available. Last year we sent
queries, not invitations, to about 60
people. Only 12 were available and
gave us syllabi." he said.
"Probably eight of the 12 available
would be labeled radical.'Only four of
those fit the established criteria."
Tyndall added
The board has five criteria to con
sider when selecting a guest professor,
according to Tyndall.
"He must be a prominent educator,
not a researcher. Second, he must have
a specialty or expertise currently not
offered or represented by the univer
sity," he said.
The prospective guest professor
must also "offer classes at an interdis
ciplinary level. The classes should be
offered at an academic level that
would make participation by a large
base of undergrads and grad students
possible.
"Finally, the class should be of topi
cal interest, it should be responsive to
student i nterest on a yearly basis." said
Tyndall.
University biased
Tom Graham, one of the board's
founders, said that he felt "the concept
that each individual program has to be
balanced in itself is a strange one. The
university is not balanced in itself. It is
biased against conservatives and radi
cals."
According to Graham, "the board
was originally set up in order to bring
Nguyen Huu Thai, a political prisoner
in Vietnam, here to teach urban plan
ning. However. Nvugen was not re-
leased from jail and was not able to
teach here."
Last year, the board selected Belgian
Marxist economist Ernest Mandel,
clinical psychologist Claude Steiner
and Marxist philosopher Angela Davis
to teach here. Mandel was unable to
come because he was denied a U.S.
visa.
Davis, who taught a course on radi
cal feminism and Steiner, who taught
radical psychiatry, commuted from
Bay Area homes to teach here. Accord
ing to Reinke, Davis was paid less than
$4000. "If you bring in someone from
the outside, you have the problem of
finding them a place to live," he said.
Board member Steven Vettel said
that the board has $3889 left over from

a 1973-74 fee assessment. "It isn't
much," added Reinke.
Reinke said the board plans to ask
for another fee assessment. Students
would vote on the assessment this
spring. Fee assessment money would
thus be available to the board next au
tumn.
This year, the board must look for
outside sources to bolster the low
funds. "The Council of Presidents
(COP) has an independent fund, the
(ASSU) Senate has money and there
are individual funding programs that
might help us out," said Reinke. Vettel
said he hoped that the ASSU Speaker's
Bureau would be able to contribute
funds.
The ASSU Senate must ultimately
ratify the choice of the Guest Profes
sorship Board, according to Reinke.
