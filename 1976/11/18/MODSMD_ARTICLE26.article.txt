# German record company on U.S. tour
## Jazz festival really swings 
### David L. Miller 
Gary Burton, Ralph Towner,
Steve Kuhn and a host of other
musicians kicked off this
weekend's ECM Festival of
Music Saturday night at the
Great American Music Hall.
ECM, a tremendously success
ful German record label which
began on a shoestring six years
ago, produces perhaps the best
contemporary and innovative
jazz in the international jazz
community. Last year,
Downbeat critics rated ECM the
second best Record Label of the
Year behind Norman Granz's
Pablo. Manfred Eicher, ECM's
founder, was named Record
Producer of the Year.
ECM's 40-50 available albums
feature low-keyed, complex
acoustic jazz sounds by such
musicians as superstar Ameri
can pianists Keith jarrett and
Chick Corea, Norwegian
saxophonist |an Garbarek, Ger
man bassist Eberhard Weber and
American guitarist John Aber
crombie. Only 10 or 12 musi
cians comprise the label's regu
lar work force, and most of them
are appearing in ECM's current
American tour.
'Ecstasy'
"Ecstasy." an American group
featuring Steve Kuhn on piano,
opened the festival. Bassist Har
vie Swartz. sax and flute man

Steve Slagle, and percussionist
Michael Smith joined Kuhn lor a
distinctive set of diversified
music.
Novel, acoustic, and compli
cated, their music explored new
time conceptions, timbre qual
ities and melodic and rhythmic
changes. Evoking images of
Keith Jarrett, kuhn's dynamic
solo piano ranged from quiet
classical passages to swirling
abstract climaxes. Wild and fast,
Smith's drumming split the time
apart, dancing everywhere
around the beat, so that the beat
came through.
Ecstasy's sound was some
times harsh, but always tasteful,
sensitive and new.
A swinger
Furiously swinging four sticks
at his vibes, Gary Burton came
out with jerking, flowing chords
to Chick Corea's Open Your Eyes
You Can Fly. Steve Swallow
plucked and strummed electric
bass harmonics. Pat Metheny
contributed strong solid guitar
passages, and Dan Gottlieb, the
quartet's new drummer, com
plemented Burton's percussive
flurries with equally intense
stickwork.
The music was beyond words
and beyond description.
The quartet performed three
compositions by Carla Bley, a
noteworthy songwriter whose

work deserves far more attention
than it has received. Her music
employs majestic, bold, happy
melodies with a hint of the major
blues. Her songs slide smoothly
through multiple time signa
tures, entrancing the listener.
Rhythmic feeling
Burton also performed a solo
rendition of Crystal Silvnce. The
incredible complexity of sounds
he coaxed from his vibes filled
the room with a Brazilian
rhythmic feeling. When he
finished, the crowd jumped to
their feet clapping and scream
ing. "It's not over yet," said Bur
ton, trying in vain to stop the
overflow of applause.
Ralph Towner came out next,
carrying two acoustic guitars
and smiling. Including quiet
melodies, fast rhythmic strum
ming, and fuli-sounding

finger-picking, his solo pieces
were long, involved and con
stantly changing. Towner's
technical mastery was obvious
as he rang out clear fast riffs and
subtle icy harmonics.
A duet performed by Burton
and Towner was the evening's
highpoint. Swelling to a perfect
climax, their music sparkled like
a spider web in the morning sun
â€” structured, beautiful and de
licate.
The ECM Festival of Music

and Sunday, featuring more of
Gary Burton and Ralph Towner.
