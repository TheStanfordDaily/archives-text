# TWICE AROUND THE ARTS
## 
### Jeffrey Kimball 
This column will no longer be
an all-inclusive report on the ar
tistic events on campus. Since I
am unable to include explana
tory comments about most
events, the community would
probably be best served with a
si in pie listing. Therefore, begin
ning soon, every Thursday in the
Daily there will be a revamped,
more thorough version of "Spec
trograph." as an accessible and
accurate guide to the upcoming
week.
In addition. Tuesday's Daily
will include a column devoted
specifically to the cinema, be
cause while it is difficult to
evaluate a dramatic or musical
performance prior to its produc
tion, film, the most well-rep
resented art on campus, does not
change fnom one showing to the
next and can readily be pre
viewed.
Here, then, is not a complete
list, but a mention of particularly
noteworthy events appearing
this week on campus. . . .
THURSDAY, NOW 18: Giovanni
Cecchetti will give a lecture (in
English) on the poetry of Mon
tale. in La Casa Italiano, at 4:15,

terpiece, \\ nlura trans
cends 1 itei«>r > interpretation, or
as the director himself has put it:
"If I could say it in words, 1
would not be a filmmaker."
There is an ineffable, essentially
irrational mood about this film,
which leaves the viewer with
more of a feeling than an under
standing. I hesitate to put faith in
any sort of artistic contest — the
concept of competition is totally

irrelevant to art — but, perhaps
the aesthetic magnitude of this
film can be quickly illustrated by
the fact that in a recent poll of
international film critics. L'Av
unfuri: was voted among the
top five films of all time. 7:30
