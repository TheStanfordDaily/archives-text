# German opera highlights S.F. season
## 
### Lois Carroll 
The production of Richard
Strauss' Die Fran ohne Schatten
at the San Francisco Opera
House this fall was the first
American engagement outside
New York's Metropolitan Opera
House for famed European con
ductor Karl Boehm.
Under Boehm's direction, the
orchestra gave a near-perfect
performance. Its tone was lush
and full, its attacks clean. A
slight intonation problem for the
solo violin in the third act was
the only noticeable crack in the
orchestral veneer.
The performances of most of
the-singers were very fine as
well. Elisabeth Schroeder-
Feinen as the Dyer's Wife was
ideally suited to her role. Her
vocal performance was virtually
flawless. Each note was gorge
ous, right on pitch, and never
forced.
Only fault
The only fault of her perfor
mance was not in musical in
terpretation but in her acting,
which lacked imagination at
times. Whenever she, as the
Dyer's Wife, felt inadequate to
deal with her difficulties, she
would throw herself face down
on her bed. This was all right the
first time or two. but after six re

enactments, it seemed a bit re
dundant.
Walter Berry as Barak the Dyer
did comparably fine work. He,
too, had a beautiful, full sound
and perfect intonation. His dic
tion was so excellent that even
this reviewer, whose German is
rather limited, could understand
every word he sang.
Leonie Rysanek as the Em
press also played her part well.
But although the ethereal timbre
of her voice was just right for her
role as a part-immortal, her
upper range fairly often sounded
strained.
Colorless
Matti kastu (the Emperor)
might have been a star in many
of the other productions of this
season. But somehow his sing
ing seemed colorless. h ; s stage
presence insipid by juxtaposi
tion with the three wonderful
performances previously men
tioned. His voice did not project
as well over the mammoth or
chestra. It lacked a certain depth
and vibrance which might have
increased its effect, although in
intonation it was quite accurate.
Kastu seemed to do a lot of
stationary standing on stage,
without even attempting some
natural movement. Thus the in
difference htvwojected left the

audience with the same feeling
toward him.
In the course of the evening,
Ruth Hesse as the Nurse made a
lot of lovely sounds. But her
voice was too pretty to be evil
enough for her Mephistophilean
part.
Pedestrian
Defails of interpretation and
staging of the production were
good at times, but at others
seemed pedestrian. But the pro
duction did help the onlooker to
a greater understanding of the
role of the Dyer's Wife. In the
libretto, her shrewishness seems
incomprehensible. But staged,
her reasons for denying her hus

band become clearer.
• After mistreatment by her
brothers-in-law, the Dyer's Wife
feels the danger of becoming a
sort of sexual dishrag to any pas
sing male. She therefore rejects
her husband's advances, despite
her love for him, as an incohe
rent gesture to uphold her dig
nity. Schroeder-Eeinen's sensi
tive acting in Act I helped com
municate this desperate feeling.
Other touches, however,
needed more thought. Eor
example, the lights should have
been arranged to eliminate cer
tain shadows during dialogue
concerning the missing shadow
of the Empress and the Dyer's

Wife. The discussion seemed ab
surd when everyone on stage
had a substantial shadow. Also,
the magical teats (summoning
apparitions of diadems, fish,
young man, and sword) seemed
less than magical. And the final
scene of the two couples wa Iking
hand-in-hand into the sunset,
accompanied by themes ripped
off from Wagner, was downright
trite.
But these gripes are for the
most part unimportant. The pro
duction was in general a very
fine one. Let us hope that the
conductor and the stars of Die
Frau ohne Schuften will return
to San Francisco soon.

The production of Richard
Strauss' Die Fran ohne Schatten
at the San Francisco Opera
House this fall was the first
American engagement outside
New York's Metropolitan Opera
House for famed European con
ductor Karl Boehm.
Under Boehm's direction, the
orchestra gave a near-perfect
performance. Its tone was lush
and full, its attacks clean. A
slight intonation problem for the
solo violin in the third act was
the only noticeable crack in the
orchestral veneer.
The performances of most of
the-singers were very fine as
well. Elisabeth Schroeder-
Feinen as the Dyer's Wife was
ideally suited to her role. Her
vocal performance was virtually
flawless. Each note was gorge
ous, right on pitch, and never
forced.
Only fault
The only fault of her perfor
mance was not in musical in
terpretation but in her acting,
which lacked imagination at
times. Whenever she, as the
Dyer's Wife, felt inadequate to
deal with her difficulties, she
would throw herself face down
on her bed. This was all right the
first time or two. but after six re

enactments, it seemed a bit re
dundant.
Walter Berry as Barak the Dyer
did comparably fine work. He,
too, had a beautiful, full sound
and perfect intonation. His dic
tion was so excellent that even
this reviewer, whose German is
rather limited, could understand
every word he sang.
Leonie Rysanek as the Em
press also played her part well.
But although the ethereal timbre
of her voice was just right for her
role as a part-immortal, her
upper range fairly often sounded
strained.

might have been a star in many
of the other productions of this

presence insipid by juxtaposi

performances previously men
tioned. His voice did not project
as well over the mammoth or
chestra. It lacked a certain depth
and vibrance which might have
increased its effect, although in
intonation it was quite accurate.
Kastu seemed to do a lot of
stationary standing on stage,
without even attempting some
natural movement. Thus the in
difference htvwojected left the

audience with the same feeling
toward him.
In the course of the evening,
Ruth Hesse as the Nurse made a
lot of lovely sounds. But her
voice was too pretty to be evil
enough for her Mephistophilean
part.
Pedestrian
Defails of interpretation and
staging of the production were
good at times, but at others
seemed pedestrian. But the pro
duction did help the onlooker to
a greater understanding of the
role of the Dyer's Wife. In the
libretto, her shrewishness seems
incomprehensible. But staged,
her reasons for denying her hus

band become clearer.
