# Ruetz will settle Christiansen's fate
## 
### Chris Baker 
Athletic; Director )oe Ruetz has made
a decision on the future of Jack Christ
iansen as Stanford head football coach.
But he isn't saying what it is.
"The decision has been made a long
time ago," said Ruetz. But he added
that it would be "highly inapprop
riate" for him to announce it until he
meets with the coaching staff after the
season ends Saturday.
Alumni pressure has been building
to buy up the remaining two years of
Christiansen's five year contract, since
the Cardinals' 48-24 loss to USC two
weeks ago.
UPI reported after the USC loss that a
rich group of alumni living in south
ern California were pressuring Ruetz
to fire Christiansen.
Hackett a possibility
Los Angeles Times columnist John
Hall, a Stanford graduate, reported
Nov. 5 that "the word is definitely
positive that Christiansen will be re
placed." Halladded that USC assistant
coach Paul Hackett, who tutored Ail-
American quarterback Steve
Bartkowski and Joe Roth at IJC-
Berkelev. was a prime contender for
the job.
Ruetz reemphasized that although
there is alumni pressure to fire Christ
iansen, he will make the final decision
himself.
The Polo Alto Times reported yes

terday that Ruetz will take one of three
options:
—"To give Christiansen a vote of
confidence.
—"To terminate Christiansen's con
tract by using Athletic Department
funds to assume the financial liability.
—"Toask for Christiansen's resigna
tion."
Many options
But the athletic director said. "There
area lot of options that have been over
looked." Ruetz said in iest, "I could
give him a 20-year contract."
Ruetz said that meeting with the
coaching staff after the season is a
"normal procedure."
Christiansen said at the NorCal foot
ball writers luncheon that he is not
worrying about the current situation.
"I have a little piece of paper in my
desk which says that I have a five-year
contract.
"It doesn't do me any good to worry
about it. We have hazards just like a
farmer or a stockbroker. Maybe it's just
one per cent of the alumni, the big
promoters who want to control the
world. But what it's really done is hurt
the university and the football prog
ram," said Christiansen.
"Maybe it's started by writers or
maybe bv the alums. I don't know. But
the point is that it hurts the program at
a time when we need to do a lot of
recruiting and need alumni support.

American quarterback Steve
Bartkowski and Joe Roth at IJC-
Berkelev. was a prime contender for
the job.
Ruetz reemphasized that although
there is alumni pressure to fire Christ
iansen, he will make the final decision
himself.
The Polo Alto Times reported yes

terday that Ruetz will take one of three
options:
—"To give Christiansen a vote of
confidence.
—"To terminate Christiansen's con
tract by using Athletic Department
funds to assume the financial liability.
—"Toask for Christiansen's resigna
tion."
Many options
But the athletic director said. "There
area lot of options that have been over
looked." Ruetz said in iest, "I could
give him a 20-year contract."
Ruetz said that meeting with the
coaching staff after the season is a
"normal procedure."
Christiansen said at the NorCal foot
ball writers luncheon that he is not
worrying about the current situation.
"I have a little piece of paper in my
desk which says that I have a five-year
contract.
"It doesn't do me any good to worry
about it. We have hazards just like a
farmer or a stockbroker. Maybe it's just
one per cent of the alumni, the big
promoters who want to control the
world. But what it's really done is hurt
the university and the football prog
ram," said Christiansen.
"Maybe it's started by writers or
maybe bv the alums. I don't know. But
the point is that it hurts the program at
a time when we need to do a lot of
recruiting and need alumni support.

Happier Days
Jack Christiansen, shown here with linebacker John Olenchalk, has seen
happier days at the Farm. Rumors are rife recently that the university is
under alumni pressure to buy out Christiansen's contract.
Athletic; Director )oe Ruetz has made
a decision on the future of Jack Christ
iansen as Stanford head football coach.
But he isn't saying what it is.
"The decision has been made a long
time ago," said Ruetz. But he added
that it would be "highly inapprop
riate" for him to announce it until he
meets with the coaching staff after the
season ends Saturday.
Alumni pressure has been building
to buy up the remaining two years of
Christiansen's five year contract, since
the Cardinals' 48-24 loss to USC two
weeks ago.
UPI reported after the USC loss that a
rich group of alumni living in south
ern California were pressuring Ruetz
to fire Christiansen.
Hackett a possibility
Los Angeles Times columnist John
Hall, a Stanford graduate, reported
Nov. 5 that "the word is definitely
positive that Christiansen will be re
placed." Halladded that USC assistant
coach Paul Hackett, who tutored Ail-
American quarterback Steve
Bartkowski and Joe Roth at IJC-
Berkelev. was a prime contender for
the job.
