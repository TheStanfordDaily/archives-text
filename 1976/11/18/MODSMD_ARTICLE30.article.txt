# And it's 'Pag' over 'Cav'...
## Italian double bill splits opinion 
### Lois Carroll 
The most famous double bill
in opera history,Ccivulleria Rus
ticanu ("Cav") and I Pagliacci
("Pag"), received unequal
treatment in the hands of the San
Francisco Opera this season. In
novations in production seem to
agree more with Pag than with
Cav,
First, all the village women's
pointing at Santuzza at the be
ginning and the end of
Cav was melodramatic to the
point of absurdity. And the addi
tion of a fanatical penitent who
stabs himself and staggers
around bleeding didn't help the
Easter procession at all. In fact,
the reviewer seriously consi
dered the possibility that he was
someone off the street who hap
pened to walk in to add his bit to
the show. Finally, when Alfio,
wearing cool shades, entered
with a bunch of friends who
looked as if they just stepped off
the set for The Cod/a ther, the last
barrier between tragedy and
comedy crumbled away.
Pregnant Santuzza
Tatiana Troyanos as the pre
gnant Santuzza sang very well,
but her acting (or lack of) only
served to intensify the impres
sion of parody. She spend most
of her time running back and
forth across the stage to slump
against and/or clutch at the
walls.
Placido Domingo as her lover
Turiddu gave the finest perfor
mance. His singing, always

lovely, hit unaccustomed
heights of emotion, especially at
his final "Addio." He really
milked the audience.
The other characters were
played competently but not
memorably. The most outstand
ing characteristic of Wassili
Janulako's performance as Alfio
was his sunglasses.
Good conducting
The conducting of Kenneth
Schermerhorn looked very good.
His beating was clear and he was
conscientious about cueing in
the players and singers. But
there were some moments that
must have been very embarras
sing for him.
The orchestra got off to a bad
start with ragged entrances and
cracked notes. Later on in the
first half of Cav, there was a truly
bad moment when the chorus
and the orchestra got very far
apart from one another. Scher
merhorn's downbeats became
enormous, but for a few minutes
it was to no avail. The chorus, in
its confusion, was over before he
could pull the two groups to
gether.
Pag fared a lot better. The or
chestra had warmed up by that
time arid sounded in good form.
The singing and acting were
greatly improved and the inter
polations of production designer
and director Jean Pierre Ponnelle
worked.
The first new addition to the
opera was a pantomime, inserted
before Tonio's introductory aria.

Dancers (Paul Scardino, Dennis
Parlato, and Mary Van Perre)
dressed in commedia dell'arte
costumes briefly acted out the
events to occur in the opera
proper. The dancing, though
humorous, had a certain night
mare quality about it which
heightened the audience's rec
ognition of the duplication of art
and life. This duplication is a
central theme of the opera. It was
emphasized as events unfolding
in the opera ("real life") echoed
those in the dumb show ("art").
Ancient Chevy
Another change was the sub
stitution of an ancient Chevy
pickup truck for the horse
drawn wagon, specified in the
libretto as the players' means of
transportation. This update was
an amusing but convincing one.
The consequence of the vehicle
switch was a change in Nedda's
mode of defense against Tonio
from whip-cracking to strangl
ing with a fan-belt, a little harder
to believe.
Placido Domingo returned
with considerably older visage
to play Canio in I Pagiiacci.
Again, the tenor's singing was
gorgeous, although he did have a
little difficulty projecting over
the orchestra early in the second
opera. He played the role of jeal
ous husband to the hilt, yet not
in so exaggerated a fashion as to
approach comedy.
Ingvar Wixell did his usual
sensitive job in both singing and

acting Tonio, the clown whose
intentions were not as funny as
his appearance.
In the role of Nedda was a
newcomer to San Francisco,
young soprano Noelle Rogers.
She played her part of a sensu
ous young woman longing for
freedom very convincingly. But
hers was the only singing that
left much to he desired. True, her
high notes were lovely, floating
out over the hall, but her vibrato
was excessive and prevented
focus on a definite pitch.

young soprano Noelle Rogers.
She played her part of a sensu
ous young woman longing for
freedom very convincingly. But
hers was the only singing that
left much to he desired. True, her
high notes were lovely, floating
out over the hall, but her vibrato
was excessive and prevented
focus on a definite pitch.
The most famous double bill
in opera history,Ccivulleria Rus
ticanu ("Cav") and I Pagliacci
("Pag"), received unequal
treatment in the hands of the San
Francisco Opera this season. In
novations in production seem to
agree more with Pag than with
Cav,
First, all the village women's
pointing at Santuzza at the be
ginning and the end of
Cav was melodramatic to the
point of absurdity. And the addi
tion of a fanatical penitent who
stabs himself and staggers
around bleeding didn't help the
Easter procession at all. In fact,
the reviewer seriously consi
dered the possibility that he was
someone off the street who hap
pened to walk in to add his bit to
the show. Finally, when Alfio,
wearing cool shades, entered
with a bunch of friends who
looked as if they just stepped off
the set for The Cod/a ther, the last
barrier between tragedy and
comedy crumbled away.
Pregnant Santuzza
Tatiana Troyanos as the pre
gnant Santuzza sang very well,
but her acting (or lack of) only
served to intensify the impres
sion of parody. She spend most
of her time running back and
forth across the stage to slump
against and/or clutch at the
walls.
Placido Domingo as her lover
Turiddu gave the finest perfor
mance. His singing, always

lovely, hit unaccustomed
heights of emotion, especially at
his final "Addio." He really
milked the audience.
The other characters were
played competently but not
memorably. The most outstand
ing characteristic of Wassili
Janulako's performance as Alfio
was his sunglasses.
Good conducting
The conducting of Kenneth
Schermerhorn looked very good.
His beating was clear and he was
conscientious about cueing in
the players and singers. But
there were some moments that
must have been very embarras
sing for him.
The orchestra got off to a bad
start with ragged entrances and
cracked notes. Later on in the
first half of Cav, there was a truly
bad moment when the chorus
and the orchestra got very far
apart from one another. Scher
merhorn's downbeats became
enormous, but for a few minutes
it was to no avail. The chorus, in
its confusion, was over before he
could pull the two groups to
gether.
Pag fared a lot better. The or
chestra had warmed up by that
time arid sounded in good form.
The singing and acting were
greatly improved and the inter
polations of production designer
and director Jean Pierre Ponnelle
worked.
The first new addition to the
opera was a pantomime, inserted
before Tonio's introductory aria.

Dancers (Paul Scardino, Dennis
Parlato, and Mary Van Perre)
dressed in commedia dell'arte
costumes briefly acted out the
events to occur in the opera
proper. The dancing, though
humorous, had a certain night
mare quality about it which
heightened the audience's rec
ognition of the duplication of art
and life. This duplication is a
central theme of the opera. It was
emphasized as events unfolding
in the opera ("real life") echoed
those in the dumb show ("art").
Ancient Chevy
Another change was the sub
stitution of an ancient Chevy
pickup truck for the horse
drawn wagon, specified in the
libretto as the players' means of
transportation. This update was
an amusing but convincing one.
The consequence of the vehicle
switch was a change in Nedda's
mode of defense against Tonio
from whip-cracking to strangl
ing with a fan-belt, a little harder
to believe.
Placido Domingo returned
with considerably older visage
to play Canio in I Pagiiacci.
Again, the tenor's singing was
gorgeous, although he did have a
little difficulty projecting over
the orchestra early in the second
opera. He played the role of jeal
ous husband to the hilt, yet not
in so exaggerated a fashion as to
approach comedy.
Ingvar Wixell did his usual
sensitive job in both singing and

acting Tonio, the clown whose
intentions were not as funny as
his appearance.

Ingvar Wixell did his usual
sensitive job in both singing and

acting Tonio, the clown whose
intentions were not as funny as
his appearance.
In the role of Nedda was a
newcomer to San Francisco,
young soprano Noelle Rogers.
She played her part of a sensu
ous young woman longing for
freedom very convincingly. But
hers was the only singing that
left much to he desired. True, her
high notes were lovely, floating
out over the hall, but her vibrato
was excessive and prevented
focus on a definite pitch.
