# Wailin', wigglin' Junior...
## Walker really gets carried away 
### David L. Miller 
Every phrase, every note that
pours out of lunior Walker's
saxophone sounds as certain and
coarse as spun gold . . .
-James Kelton, S.F. Examiner

When the All-Stars blasted their first
funky chord Friday night at The Boarding
House, a painful shudder passed through
the crowd. Pitifully out of tune, organist
"Bad Bobby" screamed out hoarse lyrics to
Baby Baby I'm Falling in Love.
And then came Junior Walker.
Wailing hot solid blues, Walker hit the
stage, instantly binding the All-Stars to
gether into a blues machine. Wearing a
white vested suit with a bright red open
shirt, he pranced around like a little kid —
hooting, shouting, jumping, and wiggling

— perversely enjoying every minute of his
performance.
"Can you feel it lift you?" cried Walker.
"YAAAH!"
The tunes were short and fast, breaking
only long enough for Walker to scream. His
simple saxophone lines crashed the beat.
His vocals were crisp .and hard, and led
smoothly and intensely to the sax solos.
Bouncing and leaning with the rhythms.
Walker led his All-Stars through How Sweet
It Is to he Loved By You, I'm a Road Runner,
These Eyes, Shotgun, Cleo's Mood, Pucker
Up Buttercup, and many others.
It was difficult not to dance. The Boarding
House regrettably had no dance space, but
that didn't stop some of us from dancing the
night away in the aisles and exits.
Supported by fast-strumming guitar

rhythms, superb drumming, organ,
clavichord, and Motown bass lines. Junior
Walker poured out the same hard-stomping
music for three solid hours.
Before the show, Walker was joking in the
bar with some friends, and he said, "There's '
only one of me. There's been many imita-y
tions, but no duplicates."
That Walker spoke the truth was obvious
as he ended the show playing on his knees,
and blasting into a fallen microphone as he
squirmed on the ground. When the group
finally carried him off stage, he wds stijl
blowing on his sax.
If you want to boogie, hear Junior Walker
sometime. He won't play jazz, he's not an
intellectual's musician.
He gives you a Detroit blues — no more,
no less.

He gives you a Detroit blues — no more,
no less.
