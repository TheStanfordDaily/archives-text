## DiBiaso opens second year of 'New Era' 
### Mike Tollin 
It was springtime at Stanford.
Finals and suntans were the order of
business. Basketball season had been
over for awhile. Thus, when the an
nouncement came, no one really
noticed.
What had transpired, it was learned
later, was that the head basketball
coaches of the Pacific-8 had named
Dick Dißiaso their Coach of the Year.
Stanford's Dick Dißiaso. The same
Dick Dißiaso that had gone 9-18 in his
first year as a head coach. Yes, the guy
who's team won three out of 14 confer
ence games.
Okay, officially he was named co-
Coach of the Year (sharing the award
with Washington State's Ceorge
Raveling), but considering the above
statistics, and the sacredness of win
loss records to the coaching profes
sion, the announcement was startling.
Now, nearly eight months have pas
sed since the award was presented,
and still not that much has been made
of it. But living somewhere in a sec
luded region ofPalo Alto, thereexistsa
small, but hardy band of youths who
have been duly impressed. The "Bas
ketball Brigade" (BB), they call them
selves. Fanatics supreme.
This bunch got to talking, not too
long ago. and came to the conclusion
that even though Stanford again lost
most of its games last year, the team
was a little bit different than usual. The
Cardinals seemed to always be in it
until the end and there was, well,

"Obviously you can't do it (have a winning prog
ram) overnight. It takes time. How much time is hard
to say, but in order to sustain, say, a 20-6 record, there
has to be a lot of other things you do. We feel like we've
laid a good foundation. There seems to be more ex
citement in the area now, set attendance records last
year, we will have TV coverage this year, we have new
attitudes ... a lot of good things have happened."

maybe a little more enthusiasm. And.
they decided, maybe this Dißiaso had
something to do with it.
So it was that on the eve of the "New
Era's" sophomore campaign —a Tai
wan National team starts it off to
night in Maples Pavilion — that BB
arranged to meet the man behind it all.
With a meat loaf as enticement, they
brought Dißiaso to their abode (a
charming place that Dißiaso irreve
rently dubbed The Barn).
BB: "Well, first of all. Dick, we're
glad you came, but we're not sure if
we're going to let you get away with
calling our house 'The Barn.' "
DiBo: "Well, there's really nothing
wrong with living in a barn. President
Lincoln didn't have a barn, he only had
a one-room log cabin. Anyway, this
place maybe rustic and it hasa definite
personality, but let's face it, its got to
be a converted barn (after rearranging
the haystacks, the BB relented and
moved on)."
BB: "Okay, let's talk basketball a bit.
About that Coach of the Year award, it
would seem that such an honor would
mean a lot to someone just finishing
his first year as a head coach."
DiBo: "Well it just so happens that
the same day I found out about it.the

Ramada Inn 1 was staying at burned
down, so it meant a lot more to me that
I got out of there alive."
BB: "But after you cooled off, you
must have realized that the award in
dicated that the other coaches in the
league had a great deal of admiration
for the job you did."
DiBo: "1 think my being chosen was
a direct tribute to the players. Being a
9-18 team, the other coaches recog
nized that our guys were playing as
well as they could, that they played to
their full potential. Now, no doubt
there's some input from me, but I'm
only as good as my players."
BB: "So what is the role of a coach
then?"
DiBo: "Vince Lombardi is often
credited with having said, 'win
ning isn't everything, it's the only
thing.' But he never said that. What he
said was, 'The will to win is not nearly
as important as the will to prepare to
win.' Teaching your team how to win,
how to prepare to win will take care of
whether you win or not, and all we try
to do is to get them to understand that
whatever they're doing, at the time
they're doing it, they should be doing
the very best they can."
BB: "But what if winning doesn't
take care of itself? Can you be success
ful if you're not winning?"
DiBo: "We think it's important that
the players wrestle with the question
of what they're supposed to feel like at
the end of a game. Because if you win a
game and you really didn't work hard
to win it and you didn't play well, you

could have less inner satisfaction than
if you really worked hard and then you
lost, but were able to say that you did
your best."
BB: "But you always feel bad when
you lose."
DiBo: "Sure you do, that's why you
play the game — to win. But there's
nothing wrong with blowing it. I mean
the game isn't that important. You
know, of the priorities of life, I can't
imagine a basketball game being very
high up. What is very high up is what a
player thinks of during the game and
what he has done in preparation for the
game."
BB: "But Dick, let's face it, in sports
circles, everything is judged by wins
and losses."
DiBo: "Well, that's not the standard
that my players have to play by. But
yes, I personally have to learn to deal
with winning and losing because
that's how coaches are hired and fired
And that's how 1 am. anyway. I am a
goal-oriented person. I talked before
about success and I believe all that, but
I also know what's good for me and 1
like to add to that a little bit."
BB: "How much would you like to
add to that? Could you be a little more
specific?"

DiBo: "What you're really asking is,
'What do you think winning is? Is it
being 14-13? Winning the league once
in awhile? Winning the league every
year?' Well ... 1 don't know."
BB: "You mentioned 14-13. Could
you be happy hovering around 50 per
cent?"
DiBo: "No."
BB: "That brings up the question of
whether you'd stay at Stanford if you
found out that you couldn't do better
than 50-50 here."
DiBo: "Right now I don't even
entertain the thought of being
50-50. Four years from now if we'rf
50-50 I might not have any choice in
the matter. But right now I don't have
any thoughts of leaving. 1 think it
would be a supreme sign of ego to
think that you're leaving someplace
after you've been 9-18. I'm just hopeful
that they think we're doing a good
enough job to keep us."
BB: "How long do you give yourself
to build a consistently winning prog
ram?"
DiBo: "Obviously you can't do it
overnight. It takes time. How much
time is hard to say, but in order to sus
tain, say, a 20-6 record, there must be a
lot of other things you do. We feel like
we've laid a good foundation. There
seems to be more excitement in the
area now; we set attendance records
last year; we will have TV coverage
this year, we have new attitudes ... a
lot of good things have happened."
BB: "So obviously wins and losses
aren't the only thing that matters."
DiBo: "I'd enjoy things a lot more if
we have a wi nni ng season, but I'm very
happy here right now. My brother-in
law told me that I'm totally stoned,
meaning that I'm doing what I want to
do where I want to do it. And it's true."
"I look forward to working every
day. It's pretty exciting to try to do
something at a place where it's never
been done before. You know we've
only had one winning season here in
the last eight, so now it's really neat to
try to get everyone involved, and to try
to turn things around."
BB: "So how do you approach the
concept of turning things around?
DiBo: "The way we look at the sea
son is that there are seven or eight
games you're going to win, and seven
that you'll lose, because almost no one
wins more than 20. Then there are 10
or 12 that can go either way. I think you
have to figure out why you win or lose
those ones that go either way and then
concentrate on improving those as
pects of your team. Now, last year we
lost 11 games by six points or less. You
can look at that in different ways, but I
think our players really played well in
some of those games to even be within
five or six points."
BB: "Granted, it was a better season
than the record would indicate, and
considering that it was your first year.
9-18 isn't so bad. But you must think
you can win more this year, and cer
tainly by now you've gone over the
schedule and decided exactly how
many games you think you should
win."
DiBo: "Sure. I've probably done it a
half a dozen times."
BB: "So give us a figure."
DiBo: "I plead the fifth."
BB: "Why?"
DiBo: "I just think that at this point

in our program, that's not what is im
portant."
BB: "Okay, forget the numbers then.
You must have a goal, like getting in a
post-season tournament, say."
DiBo: "That's too tough to say right
now, when you're coming off 9-18 and
counting on young people. 1 don't
want to put our players under any un
necessary pressure."
BB: "Does that mean that you don't
want the players to set goals for them
selves?"

DiBo: "No, I just don't want our
guys to have unrealistic goals. We
can't tie ourselves down to a number.
Now, that's not to say that we're not
optimistic. We are. You have to think
every year is the year you're going to
turn the corner, and you just have to go
out and hope you can do it. If we work
hard, and just go out and play, and if
the players believe and, at this stage,
don't let themselves be caught into
'how many,' who knows what can
happen? Maybe we can turn around
and be like Digger Phelp's year at For
dham:26-3. Who would have expected
that?"
BB: "So who's going to play the part
of Charlie Yelverton?"
DiBo: "I don't know about that, but if
you're asking about our players. . . ."
BB: "Yes. we are."
DiBo: "As you know, we have three
starters back from last year: Mike
Bratz, Wolfe Perry and George
Schader. Wolfe has learned a lot from
the year's experience. He's a better bal
lhandler. He knows offenses and de
fenses better now, he plays within his
limitations better. Mike, I think, will
benefit from having run the team last
year, and in addition to quarterback
ing. he is very capable of scoring, as he
proved last year. I think we have very
good guards. George looks improved,
too. He's had greater stability and con
sistency so far.
BB: "You said the other two starters
against China would be Jeff Mcllugh
and kimberly Belton McHugh has
looked much improved in practice so
far. but can he play center in the Pac
-8?"
DiBo: "He's not a true Pac-8 center,
no, which means we'll have some
problems on defense, but he gives us
mobility at center. He is playing with a
great deal of confidence and the ex
perience of a year, and he can shoot the
eyes out of the basket, so he's going to
be a problem to defense for a big
center."
BB: "And how about kimberly?
What can we expect from him?"
DiBo: "Kimberly is what you
would call a 'power forward,' a guy
who's going to take it inside and get
rebounds and offensive taps. That's
where he feels most comfortable. He's
a good player, and I think he'll become
a very good player. For this year, we
just hope he can make as significant a
contribution as Wolfe did as a
fresh ma n ."

BB: "So where does this leave Jay
Carter?"
DiBo: "Jay has been really good for
us coming off the bench, either at
guard or forward. Every coach looks
for a sixth man who can give you a
spark, and he seems to be able to do it,
so we'd like to see him in that role."
BB: "In addition to kimberly, you
signed Tom Schmalzried and Doug
Barnes this past year. Are you happy
with your recruiting success?"
DiBo: "Yes, we feel we've had good

"I think my being chosen (Pac-8 co-Coach of the Year) was a direct tribute to the
players. Being a 9-18 team, the other coaches recognized our guys were playing as well
as they could, that they played to their full potential. Now no doubt there's some input
from me, but I'm only as good as my players."

recruiting years two years in a row
now, but unfortunately, it's still not up
to what some of the other Pac-8 teams
have done in that two-year period."
BB: "But wouldn't you say that
you've closed the gap somewhat? For
example, isn't getting kimberly from
New York City somewhat of a coup?"
DiBo: "The fact that we got three
players, Tom, Doug and Kimberly,
from Florida, Colorado and New York
respectively, does many things for us.
Now, for instance, we go to New York
again and they know who we are. Now
they know Stanford is not in Connec
ticut. Now there's another kid on the
block."
"This is all part of a large plan. We're
out there now. They now know about
Stanford."
BB: "You talk about a 'large plan,'
hut isn't that necessarily reduced
somewhat by the academic require
ments at Stanford?"
DiBo: "Well, this is definitely an ob
stacle, but we think we can overcome
it. That is, because of the athletic and
academic mix at Stanford, we just have
to go beyond California to find enough
people that are both students and cap
able of playing top-level Pac-8 basket
ball. So our recruiting is national, and
because of that, our player pool is
large."
"We can find qualified student
athletes throughout the country, but
the further you go the harder it is to
recruit, so the big problem becomes
selling someone who's 2000 miles
away on Stanford."
BB: "But obviously you feel vou can

'winning isn't everything it's the only thing.' But he
never said that. What he said was, 'the will to win is

overcome this too. So say you get the
players here, then what? Stanford
people often pride themselves on
keeping sports in perspective.' In
volvement is important to you — do
you think the people here will respond
with the enthusiasm of the basketball
fans at. say. Oregon?"
DiHo: "Yes. I think once we get the
players and we play exciting basket
hall. we'll get the people, and the fans
will become like those at any other
place that has 8000 seats and 8000
seats with people in them."

BB: "In addition to getting the
players, what other things do you
think can or should be done to increase
enthusiasm?"
DiBo: "I think this idea of keeping
sports low-key, of the Stanford
student-athlete with different
priorities, starts with the student
athletes themselves. My feelitig is that
they should stand up and be counted
and say, 'Hey, I'm here for an educa
tion, but I also really enjoy playing
basketball.' But I think the athlete

sometimes cops out by saying, 'Well,
we lost today, but that's okay because
we're more interested in going to med
school or law school.'
"If the athlete wi 11 somehow face his
peer pressure and say, 'I really enjoy
being on a team because it's a great
atmosphere and those 2 x h hours a day
really help me out,' then maybe we can
push down this image of the student
athlete at Stanford who is really only
interested in an education. Because
our guys want both, and I want them to
be able to say it without feeling like
they're not supposed to."
BB: "And you feel if they set this
kind of example, the student body will
follow?"
DiBo: "Yes. The impressions I get
from speaking with students at the
dorms is that they want their athletes
to excel, that they expect good perfor
mances. I think the enthusiasm is bot
tled up and it's just waiting for some
one to take the cork off. Someone has to
convince them that it's not all that bad
to get excited about their teams. We
need to not be afraid to say that Stan
ford cheers for its teams."
BB: "Well, Dick, you know the BB
has never been afraid of that. Hey,
what can you tell us about this China
team you play tonight, anyway?"
DiBo: "They re from far away."
BB: "Oh."
DiBo: "No. really, they're not a tall
team, but they run well and they're
good shooters. But we think it's going
to be a great game for us. Our players
are really ready to play a game."
BB: "lust thought of something. This

game marks the return of dunking to
Stanford. Who would you say is your
No. 1 dunker, Dick?"
Dißo: "Well, probably Dick
Dohrman."
BB: "Okay, just one more question
and we'll let you go."
DiBo: "What's that?"
BB: "What did you t hi nk of our meat
loaf tonight?"
DiBo: "On a scale of one to 10. I'd
give it a nine."
BB: "Ah. now there's .i man who
knows what he's talking about."

perience of a year, and he can shoot the
eyes out of the basket, so he's going to
be a problem to defense for a big
center."
BB: "And how about kimberly?
What can we expect from him?"
DiBo: "Kimberly is what you
would call a 'power forward,' a guy
who's going to take it inside and get
rebounds and offensive taps. That's
where he feels most comfortable. He's
a good player, and I think he'll become
a very good player. For this year, we
just hope he can make as significant a
contribution as Wolfe did as a
fresh ma n ."

BB: "So where does this leave Jay
Carter?"
DiBo: "Jay has been really good for
us coming off the bench, either at
guard or forward. Every coach looks
for a sixth man who can give you a
spark, and he seems to be able to do it,
so we'd like to see him in that role."
BB: "In addition to kimberly, you
signed Tom Schmalzried and Doug
Barnes this past year. Are you happy
with your recruiting success?"
DiBo: "Yes, we feel we've had good

"I think my being chosen (Pac-8 co-Coach of the Year) was a direct tribute to the
players. Being a 9-18 team, the other coaches recognized our guys were playing as well
as they could, that they played to their full potential. Now no doubt there's some input
from me, but I'm only as good as my players."

recruiting years two years in a row
now, but unfortunately, it's still not up
to what some of the other Pac-8 teams
have done in that two-year period."
BB: "But wouldn't you say that
you've closed the gap somewhat? For
example, isn't getting kimberly from
New York City somewhat of a coup?"
DiBo: "The fact that we got three
players, Tom, Doug and Kimberly,
from Florida, Colorado and New York
respectively, does many things for us.
Now, for instance, we go to New York
again and they know who we are. Now
they know Stanford is not in Connec
ticut. Now there's another kid on the
block."
"This is all part of a large plan. We're
out there now. They now know about
Stanford."
BB: "You talk about a 'large plan,'
hut isn't that necessarily reduced
somewhat by the academic require
ments at Stanford?"
DiBo: "Well, this is definitely an ob
stacle, but we think we can overcome
it. That is, because of the athletic and
academic mix at Stanford, we just have
to go beyond California to find enough
people that are both students and cap
able of playing top-level Pac-8 basket
ball. So our recruiting is national, and
because of that, our player pool is
large."
"We can find qualified student
athletes throughout the country, but
the further you go the harder it is to
recruit, so the big problem becomes
selling someone who's 2000 miles
away on Stanford."
BB: "But obviously you feel vou can

'winning isn't everything it's the only thing.' But he
never said that. What he said was, 'the will to win is

overcome this too. So say you get the
players here, then what? Stanford
people often pride themselves on
keeping sports in perspective.' In
volvement is important to you — do
you think the people here will respond
with the enthusiasm of the basketball
fans at. say. Oregon?"
DiHo: "Yes. I think once we get the
players and we play exciting basket
hall. we'll get the people, and the fans
will become like those at any other
place that has 8000 seats and 8000
seats with people in them."

BB: "In addition to getting the
players, what other things do you
think can or should be done to increase
enthusiasm?"
DiBo: "I think this idea of keeping
sports low-key, of the Stanford
student-athlete with different
priorities, starts with the student
athletes themselves. My feelitig is that
they should stand up and be counted
and say, 'Hey, I'm here for an educa
tion, but I also really enjoy playing
basketball.' But I think the athlete

sometimes cops out by saying, 'Well,
we lost today, but that's okay because
we're more interested in going to med
school or law school.'
"If the athlete wi 11 somehow face his
peer pressure and say, 'I really enjoy
being on a team because it's a great
atmosphere and those 2 x h hours a day
really help me out,' then maybe we can
push down this image of the student
athlete at Stanford who is really only
interested in an education. Because
our guys want both, and I want them to
be able to say it without feeling like
they're not supposed to."
BB: "And you feel if they set this
kind of example, the student body will
follow?"
DiBo: "Yes. The impressions I get
from speaking with students at the
dorms is that they want their athletes
to excel, that they expect good perfor
mances. I think the enthusiasm is bot
tled up and it's just waiting for some
one to take the cork off. Someone has to
convince them that it's not all that bad
to get excited about their teams. We
need to not be afraid to say that Stan
ford cheers for its teams."
BB: "Well, Dick, you know the BB
has never been afraid of that. Hey,
what can you tell us about this China
team you play tonight, anyway?"
DiBo: "They re from far away."
BB: "Oh."
DiBo: "No. really, they're not a tall
team, but they run well and they're
good shooters. But we think it's going
to be a great game for us. Our players
are really ready to play a game."
BB: "lust thought of something. This

game marks the return of dunking to
Stanford. Who would you say is your
No. 1 dunker, Dick?"
Dißo: "Well, probably Dick
Dohrman."
BB: "Okay, just one more question
and we'll let you go."
DiBo: "What's that?"
BB: "What did you t hi nk of our meat
loaf tonight?"
DiBo: "On a scale of one to 10. I'd
give it a nine."
BB: "Ah. now there's .i man who
knows what he's talking about."

It was springtime at Stanford.
Finals and suntans were the order of
business. Basketball season had been
over for awhile. Thus, when the an
nouncement came, no one really
noticed.
What had transpired, it was learned
later, was that the head basketball
coaches of the Pacific-8 had named
Dick Dißiaso their Coach of the Year.
Stanford's Dick Dißiaso. The same
Dick Dißiaso that had gone 9-18 in his
first year as a head coach. Yes, the guy
who's team won three out of 14 confer
ence games.
Okay, officially he was named co-
Coach of the Year (sharing the award
with Washington State's Ceorge
Raveling), but considering the above
statistics, and the sacredness of win
loss records to the coaching profes
sion, the announcement was startling.
Now, nearly eight months have pas
sed since the award was presented,
and still not that much has been made
of it. But living somewhere in a sec
luded region ofPalo Alto, thereexistsa
small, but hardy band of youths who
have been duly impressed. The "Bas
ketball Brigade" (BB), they call them
selves. Fanatics supreme.
This bunch got to talking, not too
long ago. and came to the conclusion
that even though Stanford again lost
most of its games last year, the team
was a little bit different than usual. The
Cardinals seemed to always be in it
until the end and there was, well,

"Obviously you can't do it (have a winning prog
ram) overnight. It takes time. How much time is hard
to say, but in order to sustain, say, a 20-6 record, there
has to be a lot of other things you do. We feel like we've
laid a good foundation. There seems to be more ex
citement in the area now, set attendance records last
year, we will have TV coverage this year, we have new
attitudes ... a lot of good things have happened."

maybe a little more enthusiasm. And.
they decided, maybe this Dißiaso had
something to do with it.
So it was that on the eve of the "New
Era's" sophomore campaign —a Tai
wan National team starts it off to
night in Maples Pavilion — that BB
arranged to meet the man behind it all.
With a meat loaf as enticement, they
brought Dißiaso to their abode (a
charming place that Dißiaso irreve
rently dubbed The Barn).
BB: "Well, first of all. Dick, we're
glad you came, but we're not sure if
we're going to let you get away with
calling our house 'The Barn.' "
DiBo: "Well, there's really nothing
wrong with living in a barn. President
Lincoln didn't have a barn, he only had
a one-room log cabin. Anyway, this
place maybe rustic and it hasa definite
personality, but let's face it, its got to
be a converted barn (after rearranging
the haystacks, the BB relented and
moved on)."
BB: "Okay, let's talk basketball a bit.
About that Coach of the Year award, it
would seem that such an honor would
mean a lot to someone just finishing
his first year as a head coach."
DiBo: "Well it just so happens that
the same day I found out about it.the

Ramada Inn 1 was staying at burned
down, so it meant a lot more to me that
I got out of there alive."
BB: "But after you cooled off, you
must have realized that the award in
dicated that the other coaches in the
league had a great deal of admiration
for the job you did."
DiBo: "1 think my being chosen was
a direct tribute to the players. Being a
9-18 team, the other coaches recog
nized that our guys were playing as
well as they could, that they played to
their full potential. Now, no doubt
there's some input from me, but I'm
only as good as my players."
BB: "So what is the role of a coach
then?"
DiBo: "Vince Lombardi is often
credited with having said, 'win
ning isn't everything, it's the only
thing.' But he never said that. What he
said was, 'The will to win is not nearly
as important as the will to prepare to
win.' Teaching your team how to win,
how to prepare to win will take care of
whether you win or not, and all we try
to do is to get them to understand that
whatever they're doing, at the time
they're doing it, they should be doing
the very best they can."
BB: "But what if winning doesn't
take care of itself? Can you be success
ful if you're not winning?"
DiBo: "We think it's important that
the players wrestle with the question
of what they're supposed to feel like at
the end of a game. Because if you win a
game and you really didn't work hard
to win it and you didn't play well, you

could have less inner satisfaction than
if you really worked hard and then you
lost, but were able to say that you did
your best."
BB: "But you always feel bad when
you lose."
DiBo: "Sure you do, that's why you
play the game — to win. But there's
nothing wrong with blowing it. I mean
the game isn't that important. You
know, of the priorities of life, I can't
imagine a basketball game being very
high up. What is very high up is what a
player thinks of during the game and
what he has done in preparation for the
game."
BB: "But Dick, let's face it, in sports
circles, everything is judged by wins
and losses."
DiBo: "Well, that's not the standard
that my players have to play by. But
yes, I personally have to learn to deal
with winning and losing because
that's how coaches are hired and fired
And that's how 1 am. anyway. I am a
goal-oriented person. I talked before
about success and I believe all that, but
I also know what's good for me and 1
like to add to that a little bit."
BB: "How much would you like to
add to that? Could you be a little more
specific?"

DiBo: "What you're really asking is,
'What do you think winning is? Is it
being 14-13? Winning the league once
in awhile? Winning the league every
year?' Well ... 1 don't know."
BB: "You mentioned 14-13. Could
you be happy hovering around 50 per
cent?"
DiBo: "No."
BB: "That brings up the question of
whether you'd stay at Stanford if you
found out that you couldn't do better
than 50-50 here."
DiBo: "Right now I don't even
entertain the thought of being
50-50. Four years from now if we'rf
50-50 I might not have any choice in
the matter. But right now I don't have
any thoughts of leaving. 1 think it
would be a supreme sign of ego to
think that you're leaving someplace
after you've been 9-18. I'm just hopeful
that they think we're doing a good
enough job to keep us."
BB: "How long do you give yourself
to build a consistently winning prog
ram?"
DiBo: "Obviously you can't do it
overnight. It takes time. How much
time is hard to say, but in order to sus
tain, say, a 20-6 record, there must be a
lot of other things you do. We feel like
we've laid a good foundation. There
seems to be more excitement in the
area now; we set attendance records
last year; we will have TV coverage
this year, we have new attitudes ... a
lot of good things have happened."
BB: "So obviously wins and losses
aren't the only thing that matters."
DiBo: "I'd enjoy things a lot more if
we have a wi nni ng season, but I'm very
happy here right now. My brother-in
law told me that I'm totally stoned,
meaning that I'm doing what I want to
do where I want to do it. And it's true."
"I look forward to working every
day. It's pretty exciting to try to do
something at a place where it's never
been done before. You know we've
only had one winning season here in
the last eight, so now it's really neat to
try to get everyone involved, and to try
to turn things around."
BB: "So how do you approach the
concept of turning things around?
DiBo: "The way we look at the sea
son is that there are seven or eight
games you're going to win, and seven
that you'll lose, because almost no one
wins more than 20. Then there are 10
or 12 that can go either way. I think you
have to figure out why you win or lose
those ones that go either way and then
concentrate on improving those as
pects of your team. Now, last year we
lost 11 games by six points or less. You
can look at that in different ways, but I
think our players really played well in
some of those games to even be within
five or six points."
BB: "Granted, it was a better season
than the record would indicate, and
considering that it was your first year.
9-18 isn't so bad. But you must think
you can win more this year, and cer
tainly by now you've gone over the
schedule and decided exactly how
many games you think you should
win."
DiBo: "Sure. I've probably done it a
half a dozen times."
BB: "So give us a figure."
DiBo: "I plead the fifth."
BB: "Why?"
DiBo: "I just think that at this point

in our program, that's not what is im
portant."
BB: "Okay, forget the numbers then.
You must have a goal, like getting in a
post-season tournament, say."
DiBo: "That's too tough to say right
now, when you're coming off 9-18 and
counting on young people. 1 don't
want to put our players under any un
necessary pressure."
BB: "Does that mean that you don't
want the players to set goals for them
selves?"

DiBo: "No, I just don't want our
guys to have unrealistic goals. We
can't tie ourselves down to a number.
Now, that's not to say that we're not
optimistic. We are. You have to think
every year is the year you're going to
turn the corner, and you just have to go
out and hope you can do it. If we work
hard, and just go out and play, and if
the players believe and, at this stage,
don't let themselves be caught into
'how many,' who knows what can
happen? Maybe we can turn around
and be like Digger Phelp's year at For
dham:26-3. Who would have expected
that?"
BB: "So who's going to play the part
of Charlie Yelverton?"
DiBo: "I don't know about that, but if
you're asking about our players. . . ."
BB: "Yes. we are."
DiBo: "As you know, we have three
starters back from last year: Mike
Bratz, Wolfe Perry and George
Schader. Wolfe has learned a lot from
the year's experience. He's a better bal
lhandler. He knows offenses and de
fenses better now, he plays within his
limitations better. Mike, I think, will
benefit from having run the team last
year, and in addition to quarterback
ing. he is very capable of scoring, as he
proved last year. I think we have very
good guards. George looks improved,
too. He's had greater stability and con
sistency so far.
BB: "You said the other two starters
against China would be Jeff Mcllugh
and kimberly Belton McHugh has
looked much improved in practice so
far. but can he play center in the Pac
-8?"
DiBo: "He's not a true Pac-8 center,
no, which means we'll have some
problems on defense, but he gives us
mobility at center. He is playing with a
great deal of confidence and the ex
perience of a year, and he can shoot the
eyes out of the basket, so he's going to
be a problem to defense for a big
center."
BB: "And how about kimberly?
What can we expect from him?"
DiBo: "Kimberly is what you
would call a 'power forward,' a guy
who's going to take it inside and get
rebounds and offensive taps. That's
where he feels most comfortable. He's
a good player, and I think he'll become
a very good player. For this year, we
just hope he can make as significant a
contribution as Wolfe did as a
fresh ma n ."

that's how coaches are hired and fired
And that's how 1 am. anyway. I am a
goal-oriented person. I talked before
about success and I believe all that, but
I also know what's good for me and 1
like to add to that a little bit."
BB: "How much would you like to
add to that? Could you be a little more
specific?"

DiBo: "What you're really asking is,
'What do you think winning is? Is it
being 14-13? Winning the league once
in awhile? Winning the league every
year?' Well ... 1 don't know."
BB: "You mentioned 14-13. Could
you be happy hovering around 50 per
cent?"
DiBo: "No."
BB: "That brings up the question of
whether you'd stay at Stanford if you
found out that you couldn't do better
than 50-50 here."
DiBo: "Right now I don't even
entertain the thought of being
50-50. Four years from now if we'rf
50-50 I might not have any choice in
the matter. But right now I don't have
any thoughts of leaving. 1 think it
would be a supreme sign of ego to
think that you're leaving someplace
after you've been 9-18. I'm just hopeful
that they think we're doing a good
enough job to keep us."
BB: "How long do you give yourself
to build a consistently winning prog
ram?"
DiBo: "Obviously you can't do it
overnight. It takes time. How much
time is hard to say, but in order to sus
tain, say, a 20-6 record, there must be a
lot of other things you do. We feel like
we've laid a good foundation. There
seems to be more excitement in the
area now; we set attendance records
last year; we will have TV coverage
this year, we have new attitudes ... a
lot of good things have happened."
BB: "So obviously wins and losses
aren't the only thing that matters."
DiBo: "I'd enjoy things a lot more if
we have a wi nni ng season, but I'm very
happy here right now. My brother-in
law told me that I'm totally stoned,
meaning that I'm doing what I want to
do where I want to do it. And it's true."
"I look forward to working every
day. It's pretty exciting to try to do
something at a place where it's never
been done before. You know we've
only had one winning season here in
the last eight, so now it's really neat to
try to get everyone involved, and to try
to turn things around."
BB: "So how do you approach the
concept of turning things around?
DiBo: "The way we look at the sea
son is that there are seven or eight
games you're going to win, and seven
that you'll lose, because almost no one
wins more than 20. Then there are 10
or 12 that can go either way. I think you
have to figure out why you win or lose
those ones that go either way and then
concentrate on improving those as
pects of your team. Now, last year we
lost 11 games by six points or less. You
can look at that in different ways, but I
think our players really played well in
some of those games to even be within
five or six points."
BB: "Granted, it was a better season
than the record would indicate, and
considering that it was your first year.
9-18 isn't so bad. But you must think
you can win more this year, and cer
tainly by now you've gone over the
schedule and decided exactly how
many games you think you should
win."
DiBo: "Sure. I've probably done it a
half a dozen times."
BB: "So give us a figure."
DiBo: "I plead the fifth."
BB: "Why?"
DiBo: "I just think that at this point

in our program, that's not what is im
portant."
BB: "Okay, forget the numbers then.
You must have a goal, like getting in a
post-season tournament, say."
DiBo: "That's too tough to say right
now, when you're coming off 9-18 and
counting on young people. 1 don't
want to put our players under any un
necessary pressure."
BB: "Does that mean that you don't
want the players to set goals for them
selves?"

DiBo: "No, I just don't want our
guys to have unrealistic goals. We
can't tie ourselves down to a number.
Now, that's not to say that we're not
optimistic. We are. You have to think
every year is the year you're going to
turn the corner, and you just have to go
out and hope you can do it. If we work
hard, and just go out and play, and if
the players believe and, at this stage,
don't let themselves be caught into
'how many,' who knows what can
happen? Maybe we can turn around
and be like Digger Phelp's year at For
dham:26-3. Who would have expected
that?"
BB: "So who's going to play the part
of Charlie Yelverton?"
DiBo: "I don't know about that, but if
you're asking about our players. . . ."
BB: "Yes. we are."
DiBo: "As you know, we have three
starters back from last year: Mike
Bratz, Wolfe Perry and George
Schader. Wolfe has learned a lot from
the year's experience. He's a better bal
lhandler. He knows offenses and de
fenses better now, he plays within his
limitations better. Mike, I think, will
benefit from having run the team last
year, and in addition to quarterback
ing. he is very capable of scoring, as he
proved last year. I think we have very
good guards. George looks improved,
too. He's had greater stability and con
sistency so far.
BB: "You said the other two starters
against China would be Jeff Mcllugh
and kimberly Belton McHugh has
looked much improved in practice so
far. but can he play center in the Pac
-8?"
DiBo: "He's not a true Pac-8 center,
no, which means we'll have some
problems on defense, but he gives us
mobility at center. He is playing with a
great deal of confidence and the ex
perience of a year, and he can shoot the
eyes out of the basket, so he's going to
be a problem to defense for a big
center."
BB: "And how about kimberly?
What can we expect from him?"
DiBo: "Kimberly is what you
would call a 'power forward,' a guy
who's going to take it inside and get
rebounds and offensive taps. That's
where he feels most comfortable. He's
a good player, and I think he'll become
a very good player. For this year, we
just hope he can make as significant a
contribution as Wolfe did as a
fresh ma n ."

BB: "So where does this leave Jay
Carter?"
DiBo: "Jay has been really good for
us coming off the bench, either at
guard or forward. Every coach looks
for a sixth man who can give you a
spark, and he seems to be able to do it,
so we'd like to see him in that role."
BB: "In addition to kimberly, you
signed Tom Schmalzried and Doug
Barnes this past year. Are you happy
with your recruiting success?"
DiBo: "Yes, we feel we've had good

"I think my being chosen (Pac-8 co-Coach of the Year) was a direct tribute to the
players. Being a 9-18 team, the other coaches recognized our guys were playing as well
as they could, that they played to their full potential. Now no doubt there's some input
from me, but I'm only as good as my players."

recruiting years two years in a row
now, but unfortunately, it's still not up
to what some of the other Pac-8 teams
have done in that two-year period."
BB: "But wouldn't you say that
you've closed the gap somewhat? For
example, isn't getting kimberly from
New York City somewhat of a coup?"
DiBo: "The fact that we got three
players, Tom, Doug and Kimberly,
from Florida, Colorado and New York
respectively, does many things for us.
Now, for instance, we go to New York
again and they know who we are. Now
they know Stanford is not in Connec
ticut. Now there's another kid on the
block."
"This is all part of a large plan. We're
out there now. They now know about
Stanford."
BB: "You talk about a 'large plan,'
hut isn't that necessarily reduced
somewhat by the academic require
ments at Stanford?"
DiBo: "Well, this is definitely an ob
stacle, but we think we can overcome
it. That is, because of the athletic and
academic mix at Stanford, we just have
to go beyond California to find enough
people that are both students and cap
able of playing top-level Pac-8 basket
ball. So our recruiting is national, and
because of that, our player pool is
large."
"We can find qualified student
athletes throughout the country, but
the further you go the harder it is to
recruit, so the big problem becomes
selling someone who's 2000 miles
away on Stanford."
BB: "But obviously you feel vou can

'winning isn't everything it's the only thing.' But he
never said that. What he said was, 'the will to win is

overcome this too. So say you get the
players here, then what? Stanford
people often pride themselves on
keeping sports in perspective.' In
volvement is important to you — do
you think the people here will respond
with the enthusiasm of the basketball
fans at. say. Oregon?"
DiHo: "Yes. I think once we get the
players and we play exciting basket
hall. we'll get the people, and the fans
will become like those at any other
place that has 8000 seats and 8000
seats with people in them."

BB: "In addition to getting the
players, what other things do you
think can or should be done to increase
enthusiasm?"
DiBo: "I think this idea of keeping
sports low-key, of the Stanford
student-athlete with different
priorities, starts with the student
athletes themselves. My feelitig is that
they should stand up and be counted
and say, 'Hey, I'm here for an educa
tion, but I also really enjoy playing
basketball.' But I think the athlete

sometimes cops out by saying, 'Well,
we lost today, but that's okay because
we're more interested in going to med
school or law school.'
"If the athlete wi 11 somehow face his
peer pressure and say, 'I really enjoy
being on a team because it's a great
atmosphere and those 2 x h hours a day
really help me out,' then maybe we can
push down this image of the student
athlete at Stanford who is really only
interested in an education. Because
our guys want both, and I want them to
be able to say it without feeling like
they're not supposed to."
BB: "And you feel if they set this
kind of example, the student body will
follow?"
DiBo: "Yes. The impressions I get
from speaking with students at the
dorms is that they want their athletes
to excel, that they expect good perfor
mances. I think the enthusiasm is bot
tled up and it's just waiting for some
one to take the cork off. Someone has to
convince them that it's not all that bad
to get excited about their teams. We
need to not be afraid to say that Stan
ford cheers for its teams."
BB: "Well, Dick, you know the BB
has never been afraid of that. Hey,
what can you tell us about this China
team you play tonight, anyway?"
DiBo: "They re from far away."
BB: "Oh."
DiBo: "No. really, they're not a tall
team, but they run well and they're
good shooters. But we think it's going
to be a great game for us. Our players
are really ready to play a game."
BB: "lust thought of something. This

game marks the return of dunking to
Stanford. Who would you say is your
No. 1 dunker, Dick?"
Dißo: "Well, probably Dick
Dohrman."
BB: "Okay, just one more question
and we'll let you go."
DiBo: "What's that?"
BB: "What did you t hi nk of our meat
loaf tonight?"
DiBo: "On a scale of one to 10. I'd
give it a nine."
BB: "Ah. now there's .i man who
knows what he's talking about."

It was springtime at Stanford.
Finals and suntans were the order of
business. Basketball season had been
over for awhile. Thus, when the an
nouncement came, no one really
noticed.
What had transpired, it was learned
later, was that the head basketball
coaches of the Pacific-8 had named
Dick Dißiaso their Coach of the Year.
Stanford's Dick Dißiaso. The same
Dick Dißiaso that had gone 9-18 in his
first year as a head coach. Yes, the guy
who's team won three out of 14 confer
ence games.
Okay, officially he was named co-
Coach of the Year (sharing the award
with Washington State's Ceorge
Raveling), but considering the above
statistics, and the sacredness of win
loss records to the coaching profes
sion, the announcement was startling.
Now, nearly eight months have pas
sed since the award was presented,
and still not that much has been made
of it. But living somewhere in a sec
luded region ofPalo Alto, thereexistsa
small, but hardy band of youths who
have been duly impressed. The "Bas
ketball Brigade" (BB), they call them
selves. Fanatics supreme.
This bunch got to talking, not too
long ago. and came to the conclusion
that even though Stanford again lost
most of its games last year, the team
was a little bit different than usual. The
Cardinals seemed to always be in it
until the end and there was, well,

"Obviously you can't do it (have a winning prog
ram) overnight. It takes time. How much time is hard
to say, but in order to sustain, say, a 20-6 record, there
has to be a lot of other things you do. We feel like we've
laid a good foundation. There seems to be more ex
citement in the area now, set attendance records last
year, we will have TV coverage this year, we have new
attitudes ... a lot of good things have happened."

maybe a little more enthusiasm. And.
they decided, maybe this Dißiaso had
something to do with it.
So it was that on the eve of the "New
Era's" sophomore campaign —a Tai
wan National team starts it off to
night in Maples Pavilion — that BB
arranged to meet the man behind it all.
With a meat loaf as enticement, they
brought Dißiaso to their abode (a
charming place that Dißiaso irreve
rently dubbed The Barn).
BB: "Well, first of all. Dick, we're
glad you came, but we're not sure if
we're going to let you get away with
calling our house 'The Barn.' "
DiBo: "Well, there's really nothing
wrong with living in a barn. President
Lincoln didn't have a barn, he only had
a one-room log cabin. Anyway, this
place maybe rustic and it hasa definite
personality, but let's face it, its got to
be a converted barn (after rearranging
the haystacks, the BB relented and
moved on)."
BB: "Okay, let's talk basketball a bit.
About that Coach of the Year award, it
would seem that such an honor would
mean a lot to someone just finishing
his first year as a head coach."
DiBo: "Well it just so happens that
the same day I found out about it.the

Ramada Inn 1 was staying at burned
down, so it meant a lot more to me that
I got out of there alive."
BB: "But after you cooled off, you
must have realized that the award in
dicated that the other coaches in the
league had a great deal of admiration
for the job you did."
DiBo: "1 think my being chosen was
a direct tribute to the players. Being a
9-18 team, the other coaches recog
nized that our guys were playing as
well as they could, that they played to
their full potential. Now, no doubt
there's some input from me, but I'm
only as good as my players."
BB: "So what is the role of a coach
then?"
DiBo: "Vince Lombardi is often
credited with having said, 'win
ning isn't everything, it's the only
thing.' But he never said that. What he
said was, 'The will to win is not nearly
as important as the will to prepare to
win.' Teaching your team how to win,
how to prepare to win will take care of
whether you win or not, and all we try
to do is to get them to understand that
whatever they're doing, at the time
they're doing it, they should be doing
the very best they can."
BB: "But what if winning doesn't
take care of itself? Can you be success
ful if you're not winning?"
DiBo: "We think it's important that
the players wrestle with the question
of what they're supposed to feel like at
the end of a game. Because if you win a
game and you really didn't work hard
to win it and you didn't play well, you

could have less inner satisfaction than
if you really worked hard and then you
lost, but were able to say that you did
your best."
BB: "But you always feel bad when
you lose."
DiBo: "Sure you do, that's why you
play the game — to win. But there's
nothing wrong with blowing it. I mean
the game isn't that important. You
know, of the priorities of life, I can't
imagine a basketball game being very
high up. What is very high up is what a
player thinks of during the game and
what he has done in preparation for the
game."
BB: "But Dick, let's face it, in sports
circles, everything is judged by wins
and losses."
DiBo: "Well, that's not the standard
that my players have to play by. But
yes, I personally have to learn to deal
with winning and losing because
that's how coaches are hired and fired
And that's how 1 am. anyway. I am a
goal-oriented person. I talked before
about success and I believe all that, but
I also know what's good for me and 1
like to add to that a little bit."
BB: "How much would you like to
add to that? Could you be a little more
specific?"

DiBo: "What you're really asking is,
'What do you think winning is? Is it
being 14-13? Winning the league once
in awhile? Winning the league every
year?' Well ... 1 don't know."
BB: "You mentioned 14-13. Could
you be happy hovering around 50 per
cent?"
DiBo: "No."
BB: "That brings up the question of
whether you'd stay at Stanford if you
found out that you couldn't do better
than 50-50 here."
DiBo: "Right now I don't even
entertain the thought of being
50-50. Four years from now if we'rf

to be a great game for us. Our players
are really ready to play a game."
BB: "lust thought of something. This

game marks the return of dunking to
Stanford. Who would you say is your
No. 1 dunker, Dick?"
Dißo: "Well, probably Dick
Dohrman."
BB: "Okay, just one more question
and we'll let you go."
DiBo: "What's that?"
BB: "What did you t hi nk of our meat
loaf tonight?"
DiBo: "On a scale of one to 10. I'd
give it a nine."
BB: "Ah. now there's .i man who
knows what he's talking about."

It was springtime at Stanford.
Finals and suntans were the order of
business. Basketball season had been
over for awhile. Thus, when the an
nouncement came, no one really
noticed.
What had transpired, it was learned
later, was that the head basketball
coaches of the Pacific-8 had named
Dick Dißiaso their Coach of the Year.
Stanford's Dick Dißiaso. The same
Dick Dißiaso that had gone 9-18 in his
first year as a head coach. Yes, the guy
who's team won three out of 14 confer
ence games.
Okay, officially he was named co-
Coach of the Year (sharing the award
with Washington State's Ceorge
Raveling), but considering the above
statistics, and the sacredness of win
loss records to the coaching profes
sion, the announcement was startling.
Now, nearly eight months have pas
sed since the award was presented,
and still not that much has been made
of it. But living somewhere in a sec
luded region ofPalo Alto, thereexistsa
small, but hardy band of youths who
have been duly impressed. The "Bas
ketball Brigade" (BB), they call them
selves. Fanatics supreme.
This bunch got to talking, not too
long ago. and came to the conclusion
that even though Stanford again lost
most of its games last year, the team
was a little bit different than usual. The
Cardinals seemed to always be in it
until the end and there was, well,

"Obviously you can't do it (have a winning prog
ram) overnight. It takes time. How much time is hard
to say, but in order to sustain, say, a 20-6 record, there
has to be a lot of other things you do. We feel like we've
laid a good foundation. There seems to be more ex
citement in the area now, set attendance records last
year, we will have TV coverage this year, we have new
attitudes ... a lot of good things have happened."

maybe a little more enthusiasm. And.
they decided, maybe this Dißiaso had
something to do with it.
So it was that on the eve of the "New
Era's" sophomore campaign —a Tai
wan National team starts it off to
night in Maples Pavilion — that BB
arranged to meet the man behind it all.
With a meat loaf as enticement, they
brought Dißiaso to their abode (a
charming place that Dißiaso irreve
rently dubbed The Barn).
BB: "Well, first of all. Dick, we're
glad you came, but we're not sure if
we're going to let you get away with
calling our house 'The Barn.' "
DiBo: "Well, there's really nothing
wrong with living in a barn. President
Lincoln didn't have a barn, he only had
a one-room log cabin. Anyway, this
place maybe rustic and it hasa definite
personality, but let's face it, its got to
be a converted barn (after rearranging
the haystacks, the BB relented and
moved on)."
BB: "Okay, let's talk basketball a bit.
About that Coach of the Year award, it
would seem that such an honor would
mean a lot to someone just finishing
his first year as a head coach."
DiBo: "Well it just so happens that
the same day I found out about it.the

Ramada Inn 1 was staying at burned
down, so it meant a lot more to me that
I got out of there alive."
BB: "But after you cooled off, you
must have realized that the award in
dicated that the other coaches in the
league had a great deal of admiration
for the job you did."
DiBo: "1 think my being chosen was
a direct tribute to the players. Being a
9-18 team, the other coaches recog
nized that our guys were playing as
well as they could, that they played to
their full potential. Now, no doubt
there's some input from me, but I'm
only as good as my players."
BB: "So what is the role of a coach
then?"
DiBo: "Vince Lombardi is often
credited with having said, 'win
ning isn't everything, it's the only
thing.' But he never said that. What he
said was, 'The will to win is not nearly
as important as the will to prepare to
win.' Teaching your team how to win,
how to prepare to win will take care of
whether you win or not, and all we try
to do is to get them to understand that
whatever they're doing, at the time
they're doing it, they should be doing
the very best they can."
BB: "But what if winning doesn't
take care of itself? Can you be success
ful if you're not winning?"
DiBo: "We think it's important that
the players wrestle with the question
of what they're supposed to feel like at
the end of a game. Because if you win a
game and you really didn't work hard
to win it and you didn't play well, you

could have less inner satisfaction than
if you really worked hard and then you
lost, but were able to say that you did
your best."
BB: "But you always feel bad when
you lose."
DiBo: "Sure you do, that's why you
play the game — to win. But there's
nothing wrong with blowing it. I mean
the game isn't that important. You
know, of the priorities of life, I can't
imagine a basketball game being very
high up. What is very high up is what a
player thinks of during the game and
what he has done in preparation for the
game."
BB: "But Dick, let's face it, in sports
circles, everything is judged by wins
and losses."
DiBo: "Well, that's not the standard
that my players have to play by. But
yes, I personally have to learn to deal
with winning and losing because
that's how coaches are hired and fired
And that's how 1 am. anyway. I am a
goal-oriented person. I talked before
about success and I believe all that, but
I also know what's good for me and 1
like to add to that a little bit."
BB: "How much would you like to
add to that? Could you be a little more
specific?"

DiBo: "What you're really asking is,
'What do you think winning is? Is it
being 14-13? Winning the league once
in awhile? Winning the league every
year?' Well ... 1 don't know."
BB: "You mentioned 14-13. Could
you be happy hovering around 50 per
cent?"
DiBo: "No."
BB: "That brings up the question of
whether you'd stay at Stanford if you
found out that you couldn't do better
than 50-50 here."
DiBo: "Right now I don't even
entertain the thought of being
50-50. Four years from now if we'rf
50-50 I might not have any choice in
the matter. But right now I don't have
any thoughts of leaving. 1 think it
would be a supreme sign of ego to
think that you're leaving someplace
after you've been 9-18. I'm just hopeful
that they think we're doing a good
enough job to keep us."
BB: "How long do you give yourself
to build a consistently winning prog
ram?"
DiBo: "Obviously you can't do it
overnight. It takes time. How much
time is hard to say, but in order to sus
tain, say, a 20-6 record, there must be a
lot of other things you do. We feel like
we've laid a good foundation. There
seems to be more excitement in the
area now; we set attendance records
last year; we will have TV coverage
this year, we have new attitudes ... a
lot of good things have happened."
BB: "So obviously wins and losses
aren't the only thing that matters."
DiBo: "I'd enjoy things a lot more if
we have a wi nni ng season, but I'm very
happy here right now. My brother-in
law told me that I'm totally stoned,
meaning that I'm doing what I want to
do where I want to do it. And it's true."
"I look forward to working every
day. It's pretty exciting to try to do
something at a place where it's never
been done before. You know we've
only had one winning season here in
the last eight, so now it's really neat to
try to get everyone involved, and to try
to turn things around."
BB: "So how do you approach the
concept of turning things around?
DiBo: "The way we look at the sea
son is that there are seven or eight
games you're going to win, and seven
that you'll lose, because almost no one
wins more than 20. Then there are 10
or 12 that can go either way. I think you
have to figure out why you win or lose
those ones that go either way and then
concentrate on improving those as
pects of your team. Now, last year we
lost 11 games by six points or less. You
can look at that in different ways, but I
think our players really played well in
some of those games to even be within
five or six points."
BB: "Granted, it was a better season
than the record would indicate, and
considering that it was your first year.
9-18 isn't so bad. But you must think
you can win more this year, and cer
tainly by now you've gone over the
schedule and decided exactly how
many games you think you should
win."
DiBo: "Sure. I've probably done it a
half a dozen times."
BB: "So give us a figure."
DiBo: "I plead the fifth."
BB: "Why?"
DiBo: "I just think that at this point

in our program, that's not what is im
portant."
BB: "Okay, forget the numbers then.
You must have a goal, like getting in a
post-season tournament, say."
DiBo: "That's too tough to say right
now, when you're coming off 9-18 and
counting on young people. 1 don't
want to put our players under any un
necessary pressure."
BB: "Does that mean that you don't
want the players to set goals for them
selves?"

DiBo: "No, I just don't want our
guys to have unrealistic goals. We
can't tie ourselves down to a number.
Now, that's not to say that we're not
optimistic. We are. You have to think
every year is the year you're going to
turn the corner, and you just have to go
out and hope you can do it. If we work
hard, and just go out and play, and if
the players believe and, at this stage,
don't let themselves be caught into
'how many,' who knows what can
happen? Maybe we can turn around
and be like Digger Phelp's year at For
dham:26-3. Who would have expected
that?"
BB: "So who's going to play the part
of Charlie Yelverton?"
DiBo: "I don't know about that, but if
you're asking about our players. . . ."
BB: "Yes. we are."
DiBo: "As you know, we have three
starters back from last year: Mike
Bratz, Wolfe Perry and George
Schader. Wolfe has learned a lot from
the year's experience. He's a better bal
lhandler. He knows offenses and de
fenses better now, he plays within his
limitations better. Mike, I think, will
benefit from having run the team last
year, and in addition to quarterback
ing. he is very capable of scoring, as he
proved last year. I think we have very
good guards. George looks improved,
too. He's had greater stability and con
sistency so far.
BB: "You said the other two starters
against China would be Jeff Mcllugh
and kimberly Belton McHugh has
looked much improved in practice so
far. but can he play center in the Pac
-8?"
DiBo: "He's not a true Pac-8 center,
no, which means we'll have some
problems on defense, but he gives us
mobility at center. He is playing with a
great deal of confidence and the ex
perience of a year, and he can shoot the
eyes out of the basket, so he's going to
be a problem to defense for a big
center."
BB: "And how about kimberly?
What can we expect from him?"
DiBo: "Kimberly is what you
would call a 'power forward,' a guy
who's going to take it inside and get
rebounds and offensive taps. That's
where he feels most comfortable. He's
a good player, and I think he'll become
a very good player. For this year, we
just hope he can make as significant a
contribution as Wolfe did as a
fresh ma n ."

BB: "So where does this leave Jay
Carter?"
DiBo: "Jay has been really good for
us coming off the bench, either at
guard or forward. Every coach looks
for a sixth man who can give you a
spark, and he seems to be able to do it,
so we'd like to see him in that role."
BB: "In addition to kimberly, you
signed Tom Schmalzried and Doug
Barnes this past year. Are you happy
with your recruiting success?"
DiBo: "Yes, we feel we've had good

"I think my being chosen (Pac-8 co-Coach of the Year) was a direct tribute to the
players. Being a 9-18 team, the other coaches recognized our guys were playing as well
as they could, that they played to their full potential. Now no doubt there's some input
from me, but I'm only as good as my players."

recruiting years two years in a row
now, but unfortunately, it's still not up
to what some of the other Pac-8 teams
have done in that two-year period."
BB: "But wouldn't you say that
you've closed the gap somewhat? For
example, isn't getting kimberly from
New York City somewhat of a coup?"
DiBo: "The fact that we got three
players, Tom, Doug and Kimberly,
from Florida, Colorado and New York
respectively, does many things for us.
Now, for instance, we go to New York
again and they know who we are. Now
they know Stanford is not in Connec
ticut. Now there's another kid on the
block."
"This is all part of a large plan. We're
out there now. They now know about
Stanford."
BB: "You talk about a 'large plan,'
hut isn't that necessarily reduced
somewhat by the academic require
ments at Stanford?"
DiBo: "Well, this is definitely an ob
stacle, but we think we can overcome
it. That is, because of the athletic and
academic mix at Stanford, we just have
to go beyond California to find enough
people that are both students and cap
able of playing top-level Pac-8 basket
ball. So our recruiting is national, and
because of that, our player pool is
large."
"We can find qualified student
athletes throughout the country, but
the further you go the harder it is to
recruit, so the big problem becomes
selling someone who's 2000 miles
away on Stanford."
BB: "But obviously you feel vou can

'winning isn't everything it's the only thing.' But he
never said that. What he said was, 'the will to win is

overcome this too. So say you get the
players here, then what? Stanford
people often pride themselves on
keeping sports in perspective.' In
volvement is important to you — do
you think the people here will respond
with the enthusiasm of the basketball
fans at. say. Oregon?"
DiHo: "Yes. I think once we get the
players and we play exciting basket
hall. we'll get the people, and the fans
will become like those at any other
place that has 8000 seats and 8000
seats with people in them."

BB: "In addition to getting the
players, what other things do you
think can or should be done to increase
enthusiasm?"
DiBo: "I think this idea of keeping
sports low-key, of the Stanford
student-athlete with different
priorities, starts with the student
athletes themselves. My feelitig is that
they should stand up and be counted
and say, 'Hey, I'm here for an educa
tion, but I also really enjoy playing
basketball.' But I think the athlete

sometimes cops out by saying, 'Well,
we lost today, but that's okay because
we're more interested in going to med
school or law school.'
"If the athlete wi 11 somehow face his
peer pressure and say, 'I really enjoy
being on a team because it's a great
atmosphere and those 2 x h hours a day
really help me out,' then maybe we can
push down this image of the student
athlete at Stanford who is really only
interested in an education. Because
our guys want both, and I want them to
be able to say it without feeling like
they're not supposed to."
BB: "And you feel if they set this
kind of example, the student body will
follow?"
DiBo: "Yes. The impressions I get
from speaking with students at the
dorms is that they want their athletes
to excel, that they expect good perfor
mances. I think the enthusiasm is bot
tled up and it's just waiting for some
one to take the cork off. Someone has to
convince them that it's not all that bad
to get excited about their teams. We
need to not be afraid to say that Stan
ford cheers for its teams."
BB: "Well, Dick, you know the BB
has never been afraid of that. Hey,
what can you tell us about this China
team you play tonight, anyway?"
DiBo: "They re from far away."
BB: "Oh."
DiBo: "No. really, they're not a tall
team, but they run well and they're
good shooters. But we think it's going
to be a great game for us. Our players
are really ready to play a game."
BB: "lust thought of something. This

game marks the return of dunking to

benefit from having run the team last
year, and in addition to quarterback
ing. he is very capable of scoring, as he
proved last year. I think we have very
good guards. George looks improved,
too. He's had greater stability and con
sistency so far.
BB: "You said the other two starters
against China would be Jeff Mcllugh
and kimberly Belton McHugh has
looked much improved in practice so
far. but can he play center in the Pac
-8?"
DiBo: "He's not a true Pac-8 center,
no, which means we'll have some
problems on defense, but he gives us
mobility at center. He is playing with a
great deal of confidence and the ex
perience of a year, and he can shoot the
eyes out of the basket, so he's going to
be a problem to defense for a big
center."
BB: "And how about kimberly?
What can we expect from him?"
DiBo: "Kimberly is what you
would call a 'power forward,' a guy
who's going to take it inside and get
rebounds and offensive taps. That's
where he feels most comfortable. He's
a good player, and I think he'll become
a very good player. For this year, we
just hope he can make as significant a
contribution as Wolfe did as a
fresh ma n ."

BB: "So where does this leave Jay
Carter?"
DiBo: "Jay has been really good for
us coming off the bench, either at
guard or forward. Every coach looks
for a sixth man who can give you a
spark, and he seems to be able to do it,
so we'd like to see him in that role."
BB: "In addition to kimberly, you
signed Tom Schmalzried and Doug
Barnes this past year. Are you happy
with your recruiting success?"
DiBo: "Yes, we feel we've had good

"I think my being chosen (Pac-8 co-Coach of the Year) was a direct tribute to the
players. Being a 9-18 team, the other coaches recognized our guys were playing as well
as they could, that they played to their full potential. Now no doubt there's some input
from me, but I'm only as good as my players."

recruiting years two years in a row
now, but unfortunately, it's still not up
to what some of the other Pac-8 teams
have done in that two-year period."
BB: "But wouldn't you say that
you've closed the gap somewhat? For
example, isn't getting kimberly from
New York City somewhat of a coup?"
DiBo: "The fact that we got three
players, Tom, Doug and Kimberly,
from Florida, Colorado and New York
respectively, does many things for us.
Now, for instance, we go to New York
again and they know who we are. Now
they know Stanford is not in Connec
ticut. Now there's another kid on the
block."
"This is all part of a large plan. We're
out there now. They now know about
Stanford."
BB: "You talk about a 'large plan,'
hut isn't that necessarily reduced
somewhat by the academic require
ments at Stanford?"
DiBo: "Well, this is definitely an ob
stacle, but we think we can overcome
it. That is, because of the athletic and
academic mix at Stanford, we just have
to go beyond California to find enough
people that are both students and cap
able of playing top-level Pac-8 basket
ball. So our recruiting is national, and
because of that, our player pool is
large."
"We can find qualified student
athletes throughout the country, but
the further you go the harder it is to
recruit, so the big problem becomes
selling someone who's 2000 miles
away on Stanford."
BB: "But obviously you feel vou can

'winning isn't everything it's the only thing.' But he
never said that. What he said was, 'the will to win is

overcome this too. So say you get the
players here, then what? Stanford
people often pride themselves on
keeping sports in perspective.' In
volvement is important to you — do
you think the people here will respond
with the enthusiasm of the basketball
fans at. say. Oregon?"
DiHo: "Yes. I think once we get the
players and we play exciting basket
hall. we'll get the people, and the fans
will become like those at any other
place that has 8000 seats and 8000
seats with people in them."

BB: "In addition to getting the
players, what other things do you
think can or should be done to increase
enthusiasm?"
DiBo: "I think this idea of keeping
sports low-key, of the Stanford
student-athlete with different
priorities, starts with the student
athletes themselves. My feelitig is that
they should stand up and be counted
and say, 'Hey, I'm here for an educa
tion, but I also really enjoy playing
basketball.' But I think the athlete

sometimes cops out by saying, 'Well,
we lost today, but that's okay because
we're more interested in going to med
school or law school.'
"If the athlete wi 11 somehow face his
peer pressure and say, 'I really enjoy
being on a team because it's a great
atmosphere and those 2 x h hours a day
really help me out,' then maybe we can
push down this image of the student
athlete at Stanford who is really only
interested in an education. Because
our guys want both, and I want them to
be able to say it without feeling like
they're not supposed to."
BB: "And you feel if they set this
kind of example, the student body will
follow?"
DiBo: "Yes. The impressions I get
from speaking with students at the
dorms is that they want their athletes
to excel, that they expect good perfor
mances. I think the enthusiasm is bot
tled up and it's just waiting for some
one to take the cork off. Someone has to
convince them that it's not all that bad
to get excited about their teams. We
need to not be afraid to say that Stan
ford cheers for its teams."
BB: "Well, Dick, you know the BB
has never been afraid of that. Hey,
what can you tell us about this China
team you play tonight, anyway?"
DiBo: "They re from far away."
BB: "Oh."
DiBo: "No. really, they're not a tall
team, but they run well and they're
good shooters. But we think it's going
to be a great game for us. Our players
are really ready to play a game."
BB: "lust thought of something. This

game marks the return of dunking to
Stanford. Who would you say is your
No. 1 dunker, Dick?"
Dißo: "Well, probably Dick
Dohrman."
BB: "Okay, just one more question
and we'll let you go."
DiBo: "What's that?"
BB: "What did you t hi nk of our meat
loaf tonight?"
DiBo: "On a scale of one to 10. I'd
give it a nine."
BB: "Ah. now there's .i man who
knows what he's talking about."

It was springtime at Stanford.
Finals and suntans were the order of
business. Basketball season had been
over for awhile. Thus, when the an
nouncement came, no one really
noticed.
What had transpired, it was learned
later, was that the head basketball
coaches of the Pacific-8 had named
Dick Dißiaso their Coach of the Year.
Stanford's Dick Dißiaso. The same
Dick Dißiaso that had gone 9-18 in his
first year as a head coach. Yes, the guy
who's team won three out of 14 confer
ence games.
Okay, officially he was named co-
Coach of the Year (sharing the award
with Washington State's Ceorge
Raveling), but considering the above
statistics, and the sacredness of win
loss records to the coaching profes
sion, the announcement was startling.
Now, nearly eight months have pas
sed since the award was presented,
and still not that much has been made
of it. But living somewhere in a sec
luded region ofPalo Alto, thereexistsa
small, but hardy band of youths who
have been duly impressed. The "Bas
ketball Brigade" (BB), they call them
selves. Fanatics supreme.
This bunch got to talking, not too
long ago. and came to the conclusion
that even though Stanford again lost
most of its games last year, the team
was a little bit different than usual. The
Cardinals seemed to always be in it
until the end and there was, well,

"Obviously you can't do it (have a winning prog
ram) overnight. It takes time. How much time is hard
to say, but in order to sustain, say, a 20-6 record, there
has to be a lot of other things you do. We feel like we've
laid a good foundation. There seems to be more ex
citement in the area now, set attendance records last
year, we will have TV coverage this year, we have new
attitudes ... a lot of good things have happened."

maybe a little more enthusiasm. And.
they decided, maybe this Dißiaso had
something to do with it.
So it was that on the eve of the "New
Era's" sophomore campaign —a Tai
wan National team starts it off to
night in Maples Pavilion — that BB
arranged to meet the man behind it all.
With a meat loaf as enticement, they
brought Dißiaso to their abode (a
charming place that Dißiaso irreve
rently dubbed The Barn).
BB: "Well, first of all. Dick, we're
glad you came, but we're not sure if
we're going to let you get away with
calling our house 'The Barn.' "
DiBo: "Well, there's really nothing
wrong with living in a barn. President
Lincoln didn't have a barn, he only had
a one-room log cabin. Anyway, this
place maybe rustic and it hasa definite
personality, but let's face it, its got to
be a converted barn (after rearranging
the haystacks, the BB relented and
moved on)."
BB: "Okay, let's talk basketball a bit.
About that Coach of the Year award, it
would seem that such an honor would
mean a lot to someone just finishing
his first year as a head coach."
DiBo: "Well it just so happens that
the same day I found out about it.the

Ramada Inn 1 was staying at burned
down, so it meant a lot more to me that
I got out of there alive."
BB: "But after you cooled off, you
must have realized that the award in
dicated that the other coaches in the
league had a great deal of admiration
for the job you did."
DiBo: "1 think my being chosen was
a direct tribute to the players. Being a
9-18 team, the other coaches recog
nized that our guys were playing as
well as they could, that they played to
their full potential. Now, no doubt
there's some input from me, but I'm
only as good as my players."
BB: "So what is the role of a coach
then?"
DiBo: "Vince Lombardi is often
credited with having said, 'win
ning isn't everything, it's the only
thing.' But he never said that. What he
said was, 'The will to win is not nearly
as important as the will to prepare to
win.' Teaching your team how to win,
how to prepare to win will take care of
whether you win or not, and all we try
to do is to get them to understand that
whatever they're doing, at the time
they're doing it, they should be doing
the very best they can."
BB: "But what if winning doesn't
take care of itself? Can you be success
ful if you're not winning?"
DiBo: "We think it's important that
the players wrestle with the question
of what they're supposed to feel like at
the end of a game. Because if you win a
game and you really didn't work hard
to win it and you didn't play well, you

could have less inner satisfaction than
if you really worked hard and then you
lost, but were able to say that you did
your best."
BB: "But you always feel bad when
you lose."
DiBo: "Sure you do, that's why you
play the game — to win. But there's
nothing wrong with blowing it. I mean
the game isn't that important. You
know, of the priorities of life, I can't
imagine a basketball game being very
high up. What is very high up is what a
player thinks of during the game and
what he has done in preparation for the
game."
BB: "But Dick, let's face it, in sports
circles, everything is judged by wins
and losses."
DiBo: "Well, that's not the standard
that my players have to play by. But
yes, I personally have to learn to deal
with winning and losing because
that's how coaches are hired and fired
And that's how 1 am. anyway. I am a
goal-oriented person. I talked before
about success and I believe all that, but
I also know what's good for me and 1
like to add to that a little bit."
BB: "How much would you like to
add to that? Could you be a little more
specific?"

DiBo: "What you're really asking is,
'What do you think winning is? Is it
being 14-13? Winning the league once
in awhile? Winning the league every
year?' Well ... 1 don't know."
BB: "You mentioned 14-13. Could
you be happy hovering around 50 per
cent?"
DiBo: "No."
BB: "That brings up the question of
whether you'd stay at Stanford if you
found out that you couldn't do better
than 50-50 here."
DiBo: "Right now I don't even
entertain the thought of being
50-50. Four years from now if we'rf
50-50 I might not have any choice in
the matter. But right now I don't have
any thoughts of leaving. 1 think it
would be a supreme sign of ego to
think that you're leaving someplace
after you've been 9-18. I'm just hopeful
that they think we're doing a good
enough job to keep us."
BB: "How long do you give yourself
to build a consistently winning prog
ram?"
DiBo: "Obviously you can't do it
overnight. It takes time. How much
time is hard to say, but in order to sus
tain, say, a 20-6 record, there must be a
lot of other things you do. We feel like
we've laid a good foundation. There
seems to be more excitement in the
area now; we set attendance records
last year; we will have TV coverage
this year, we have new attitudes ... a
lot of good things have happened."
BB: "So obviously wins and losses
aren't the only thing that matters."
DiBo: "I'd enjoy things a lot more if
we have a wi nni ng season, but I'm very
happy here right now. My brother-in
law told me that I'm totally stoned,
meaning that I'm doing what I want to
do where I want to do it. And it's true."
"I look forward to working every
day. It's pretty exciting to try to do
something at a place where it's never
been done before. You know we've
only had one winning season here in
the last eight, so now it's really neat to
try to get everyone involved, and to try
to turn things around."
BB: "So how do you approach the
concept of turning things around?
DiBo: "The way we look at the sea
son is that there are seven or eight
games you're going to win, and seven
that you'll lose, because almost no one
wins more than 20. Then there are 10
or 12 that can go either way. I think you
have to figure out why you win or lose
those ones that go either way and then
concentrate on improving those as
pects of your team. Now, last year we
lost 11 games by six points or less. You
can look at that in different ways, but I
think our players really played well in
some of those games to even be within
five or six points."
BB: "Granted, it was a better season
than the record would indicate, and
considering that it was your first year.
9-18 isn't so bad. But you must think
you can win more this year, and cer
tainly by now you've gone over the
schedule and decided exactly how
many games you think you should
win."
DiBo: "Sure. I've probably done it a
half a dozen times."
BB: "So give us a figure."
DiBo: "I plead the fifth."
BB: "Why?"
DiBo: "I just think that at this point

in our program, that's not what is im
portant."
BB: "Okay, forget the numbers then.
You must have a goal, like getting in a
post-season tournament, say."
DiBo: "That's too tough to say right
now, when you're coming off 9-18 and
counting on young people. 1 don't
want to put our players under any un
necessary pressure."
BB: "Does that mean that you don't
want the players to set goals for them
selves?"

DiBo: "No, I just don't want our
guys to have unrealistic goals. We
can't tie ourselves down to a number.
Now, that's not to say that we're not
optimistic. We are. You have to think
every year is the year you're going to
turn the corner, and you just have to go
out and hope you can do it. If we work
hard, and just go out and play, and if
the players believe and, at this stage,
don't let themselves be caught into
'how many,' who knows what can
happen? Maybe we can turn around
and be like Digger Phelp's year at For
dham:26-3. Who would have expected
that?"
BB: "So who's going to play the part
of Charlie Yelverton?"
DiBo: "I don't know about that, but if
you're asking about our players. . . ."
BB: "Yes. we are."
DiBo: "As you know, we have three
starters back from last year: Mike
Bratz, Wolfe Perry and George
Schader. Wolfe has learned a lot from
the year's experience. He's a better bal
lhandler. He knows offenses and de
fenses better now, he plays within his
limitations better. Mike, I think, will
benefit from having run the team last
year, and in addition to quarterback
ing. he is very capable of scoring, as he
proved last year. I think we have very
good guards. George looks improved,
too. He's had greater stability and con
sistency so far.
BB: "You said the other two starters
against China would be Jeff Mcllugh
and kimberly Belton McHugh has
looked much improved in practice so
far. but can he play center in the Pac
-8?"
DiBo: "He's not a true Pac-8 center,

you lose."
DiBo: "Sure you do, that's why you
play the game — to win. But there's
nothing wrong with blowing it. I mean
the game isn't that important. You
know, of the priorities of life, I can't
imagine a basketball game being very
high up. What is very high up is what a
player thinks of during the game and
what he has done in preparation for the
game."
BB: "But Dick, let's face it, in sports
circles, everything is judged by wins
and losses."
DiBo: "Well, that's not the standard
that my players have to play by. But
yes, I personally have to learn to deal
with winning and losing because
that's how coaches are hired and fired
And that's how 1 am. anyway. I am a
goal-oriented person. I talked before
about success and I believe all that, but
I also know what's good for me and 1
like to add to that a little bit."
BB: "How much would you like to
add to that? Could you be a little more
specific?"

DiBo: "What you're really asking is,
'What do you think winning is? Is it
being 14-13? Winning the league once
in awhile? Winning the league every
year?' Well ... 1 don't know."
BB: "You mentioned 14-13. Could
you be happy hovering around 50 per
cent?"
DiBo: "No."
BB: "That brings up the question of
whether you'd stay at Stanford if you
found out that you couldn't do better
than 50-50 here."
DiBo: "Right now I don't even
entertain the thought of being
50-50. Four years from now if we'rf
50-50 I might not have any choice in
the matter. But right now I don't have
any thoughts of leaving. 1 think it
would be a supreme sign of ego to
think that you're leaving someplace
after you've been 9-18. I'm just hopeful
that they think we're doing a good
enough job to keep us."
BB: "How long do you give yourself
to build a consistently winning prog
ram?"
DiBo: "Obviously you can't do it
overnight. It takes time. How much
time is hard to say, but in order to sus
tain, say, a 20-6 record, there must be a
lot of other things you do. We feel like
we've laid a good foundation. There
seems to be more excitement in the
area now; we set attendance records
last year; we will have TV coverage
this year, we have new attitudes ... a
lot of good things have happened."
BB: "So obviously wins and losses
aren't the only thing that matters."
DiBo: "I'd enjoy things a lot more if
we have a wi nni ng season, but I'm very
happy here right now. My brother-in
law told me that I'm totally stoned,
meaning that I'm doing what I want to
do where I want to do it. And it's true."
"I look forward to working every
day. It's pretty exciting to try to do
something at a place where it's never
been done before. You know we've
only had one winning season here in
the last eight, so now it's really neat to
try to get everyone involved, and to try
to turn things around."
BB: "So how do you approach the
concept of turning things around?
DiBo: "The way we look at the sea
son is that there are seven or eight
games you're going to win, and seven
that you'll lose, because almost no one
wins more than 20. Then there are 10
or 12 that can go either way. I think you
have to figure out why you win or lose
those ones that go either way and then
concentrate on improving those as
pects of your team. Now, last year we
lost 11 games by six points or less. You
can look at that in different ways, but I
think our players really played well in
some of those games to even be within
five or six points."
BB: "Granted, it was a better season
than the record would indicate, and
considering that it was your first year.
9-18 isn't so bad. But you must think
you can win more this year, and cer
tainly by now you've gone over the
schedule and decided exactly how
many games you think you should
win."
DiBo: "Sure. I've probably done it a
half a dozen times."
BB: "So give us a figure."
DiBo: "I plead the fifth."
BB: "Why?"
DiBo: "I just think that at this point

in our program, that's not what is im
portant."
BB: "Okay, forget the numbers then.
You must have a goal, like getting in a
post-season tournament, say."
DiBo: "That's too tough to say right
now, when you're coming off 9-18 and
counting on young people. 1 don't
want to put our players under any un
necessary pressure."
BB: "Does that mean that you don't
want the players to set goals for them
selves?"

DiBo: "No, I just don't want our
guys to have unrealistic goals. We
can't tie ourselves down to a number.
Now, that's not to say that we're not
optimistic. We are. You have to think
every year is the year you're going to
turn the corner, and you just have to go
out and hope you can do it. If we work
hard, and just go out and play, and if
the players believe and, at this stage,
don't let themselves be caught into
'how many,' who knows what can
happen? Maybe we can turn around
and be like Digger Phelp's year at For
dham:26-3. Who would have expected
that?"
BB: "So who's going to play the part
of Charlie Yelverton?"
DiBo: "I don't know about that, but if
you're asking about our players. . . ."
BB: "Yes. we are."
DiBo: "As you know, we have three
starters back from last year: Mike
Bratz, Wolfe Perry and George
Schader. Wolfe has learned a lot from
the year's experience. He's a better bal
lhandler. He knows offenses and de
fenses better now, he plays within his
limitations better. Mike, I think, will
benefit from having run the team last
year, and in addition to quarterback
ing. he is very capable of scoring, as he
proved last year. I think we have very
good guards. George looks improved,
too. He's had greater stability and con
sistency so far.
BB: "You said the other two starters
against China would be Jeff Mcllugh
and kimberly Belton McHugh has
looked much improved in practice so
far. but can he play center in the Pac
-8?"
DiBo: "He's not a true Pac-8 center,
no, which means we'll have some
problems on defense, but he gives us
mobility at center. He is playing with a
great deal of confidence and the ex
perience of a year, and he can shoot the
eyes out of the basket, so he's going to
be a problem to defense for a big
center."
BB: "And how about kimberly?
What can we expect from him?"
DiBo: "Kimberly is what you
would call a 'power forward,' a guy
who's going to take it inside and get
rebounds and offensive taps. That's
where he feels most comfortable. He's
a good player, and I think he'll become
a very good player. For this year, we
just hope he can make as significant a
contribution as Wolfe did as a
fresh ma n ."

BB: "So where does this leave Jay
Carter?"
DiBo: "Jay has been really good for
us coming off the bench, either at
guard or forward. Every coach looks
for a sixth man who can give you a
spark, and he seems to be able to do it,
so we'd like to see him in that role."
BB: "In addition to kimberly, you
signed Tom Schmalzried and Doug
Barnes this past year. Are you happy
with your recruiting success?"
DiBo: "Yes, we feel we've had good

"I think my being chosen (Pac-8 co-Coach of the Year) was a direct tribute to the
players. Being a 9-18 team, the other coaches recognized our guys were playing as well
as they could, that they played to their full potential. Now no doubt there's some input
from me, but I'm only as good as my players."

recruiting years two years in a row
now, but unfortunately, it's still not up
to what some of the other Pac-8 teams
have done in that two-year period."
BB: "But wouldn't you say that
you've closed the gap somewhat? For
example, isn't getting kimberly from
New York City somewhat of a coup?"
DiBo: "The fact that we got three
players, Tom, Doug and Kimberly,
from Florida, Colorado and New York
respectively, does many things for us.
Now, for instance, we go to New York
again and they know who we are. Now
they know Stanford is not in Connec
ticut. Now there's another kid on the
block."
"This is all part of a large plan. We're
out there now. They now know about
Stanford."
BB: "You talk about a 'large plan,'
hut isn't that necessarily reduced
somewhat by the academic require
ments at Stanford?"
DiBo: "Well, this is definitely an ob
stacle, but we think we can overcome
it. That is, because of the athletic and
academic mix at Stanford, we just have
to go beyond California to find enough
people that are both students and cap
able of playing top-level Pac-8 basket
ball. So our recruiting is national, and
because of that, our player pool is
large."
"We can find qualified student
athletes throughout the country, but
the further you go the harder it is to
recruit, so the big problem becomes
selling someone who's 2000 miles
away on Stanford."
BB: "But obviously you feel vou can

"Vince Lombardi is often credited with having said
'winning isn't everything it's the only thing.' But he
never said that. What he said was, 'the will to win is

overcome this too. So say you get the
players here, then what? Stanford
people often pride themselves on
keeping sports in perspective.' In
volvement is important to you — do
you think the people here will respond
with the enthusiasm of the basketball
fans at. say. Oregon?"
DiHo: "Yes. I think once we get the
players and we play exciting basket
hall. we'll get the people, and the fans
will become like those at any other
place that has 8000 seats and 8000
seats with people in them."

BB: "In addition to getting the
players, what other things do you
think can or should be done to increase
enthusiasm?"
DiBo: "I think this idea of keeping
sports low-key, of the Stanford
student-athlete with different
priorities, starts with the student
athletes themselves. My feelitig is that
they should stand up and be counted
and say, 'Hey, I'm here for an educa
tion, but I also really enjoy playing
basketball.' But I think the athlete

sometimes cops out by saying, 'Well,
we lost today, but that's okay because
we're more interested in going to med
school or law school.'
"If the athlete wi 11 somehow face his
peer pressure and say, 'I really enjoy
being on a team because it's a great
atmosphere and those 2 x h hours a day
really help me out,' then maybe we can
push down this image of the student
athlete at Stanford who is really only
interested in an education. Because
our guys want both, and I want them to
be able to say it without feeling like
they're not supposed to."
BB: "And you feel if they set this
kind of example, the student body will
follow?"
DiBo: "Yes. The impressions I get
from speaking with students at the
dorms is that they want their athletes
to excel, that they expect good perfor
mances. I think the enthusiasm is bot
tled up and it's just waiting for some
one to take the cork off. Someone has to
convince them that it's not all that bad
to get excited about their teams. We
need to not be afraid to say that Stan
ford cheers for its teams."
BB: "Well, Dick, you know the BB
has never been afraid of that. Hey,
what can you tell us about this China
team you play tonight, anyway?"
DiBo: "They re from far away."
BB: "Oh."
DiBo: "No. really, they're not a tall
team, but they run well and they're
good shooters. But we think it's going
to be a great game for us. Our players
are really ready to play a game."
BB: "lust thought of something. This

game marks the return of dunking to
Stanford. Who would you say is your
No. 1 dunker, Dick?"
Dißo: "Well, probably Dick
Dohrman."
BB: "Okay, just one more question
and we'll let you go."
DiBo: "What's that?"
BB: "What did you t hi nk of our meat
loaf tonight?"
DiBo: "On a scale of one to 10. I'd
give it a nine."
BB: "Ah. now there's .i man who
knows what he's talking about."

It was springtime at Stanford.
Finals and suntans were the order of
business. Basketball season had been
over for awhile. Thus, when the an
nouncement came, no one really
noticed.
What had transpired, it was learned
later, was that the head basketball
coaches of the Pacific-8 had named
Dick Dißiaso their Coach of the Year.
Stanford's Dick Dißiaso. The same
Dick Dißiaso that had gone 9-18 in his
first year as a head coach. Yes, the guy
who's team won three out of 14 confer
ence games.
Okay, officially he was named co-
Coach of the Year (sharing the award
with Washington State's Ceorge
Raveling), but considering the above
statistics, and the sacredness of win
loss records to the coaching profes
sion, the announcement was startling.
Now, nearly eight months have pas
sed since the award was presented,
and still not that much has been made
of it. But living somewhere in a sec
luded region ofPalo Alto, thereexistsa
small, but hardy band of youths who
have been duly impressed. The "Bas
ketball Brigade" (BB), they call them
selves. Fanatics supreme.
This bunch got to talking, not too
long ago. and came to the conclusion
that even though Stanford again lost
most of its games last year, the team
was a little bit different than usual. The
Cardinals seemed to always be in it
until the end and there was, well,

"Obviously you can't do it (have a winning prog
ram) overnight. It takes time. How much time is hard
to say, but in order to sustain, say, a 20-6 record, there
has to be a lot of other things you do. We feel like we've
laid a good foundation. There seems to be more ex
citement in the area now, set attendance records last
year, we will have TV coverage this year, we have new
attitudes ... a lot of good things have happened."

maybe a little more enthusiasm. And.
they decided, maybe this Dißiaso had
something to do with it.
So it was that on the eve of the "New
Era's" sophomore campaign —a Tai
wan National team starts it off to
night in Maples Pavilion — that BB
arranged to meet the man behind it all.
With a meat loaf as enticement, they
brought Dißiaso to their abode (a
charming place that Dißiaso irreve
rently dubbed The Barn).
BB: "Well, first of all. Dick, we're
glad you came, but we're not sure if
we're going to let you get away with
calling our house 'The Barn.' "
DiBo: "Well, there's really nothing
wrong with living in a barn. President
Lincoln didn't have a barn, he only had
a one-room log cabin. Anyway, this
place maybe rustic and it hasa definite
personality, but let's face it, its got to
be a converted barn (after rearranging
the haystacks, the BB relented and
moved on)."
BB: "Okay, let's talk basketball a bit.
About that Coach of the Year award, it
would seem that such an honor would
mean a lot to someone just finishing
his first year as a head coach."
DiBo: "Well it just so happens that
the same day I found out about it.the

Ramada Inn 1 was staying at burned
down, so it meant a lot more to me that
I got out of there alive."
BB: "But after you cooled off, you
must have realized that the award in
dicated that the other coaches in the
league had a great deal of admiration
for the job you did."
DiBo: "1 think my being chosen was
a direct tribute to the players. Being a
9-18 team, the other coaches recog
nized that our guys were playing as
well as they could, that they played to
their full potential. Now, no doubt
there's some input from me, but I'm
only as good as my players."
BB: "So what is the role of a coach
then?"
DiBo: "Vince Lombardi is often
credited with having said, 'win
ning isn't everything, it's the only
thing.' But he never said that. What he
said was, 'The will to win is not nearly
as important as the will to prepare to
win.' Teaching your team how to win,
how to prepare to win will take care of
whether you win or not, and all we try
to do is to get them to understand that
whatever they're doing, at the time
they're doing it, they should be doing
the very best they can."
BB: "But what if winning doesn't
take care of itself? Can you be success
ful if you're not winning?"
DiBo: "We think it's important that
the players wrestle with the question
of what they're supposed to feel like at
the end of a game. Because if you win a
game and you really didn't work hard
to win it and you didn't play well, you

could have less inner satisfaction than
if you really worked hard and then you
lost, but were able to say that you did
your best."
BB: "But you always feel bad when
you lose."
DiBo: "Sure you do, that's why you
play the game — to win. But there's
nothing wrong with blowing it. I mean
the game isn't that important. You
know, of the priorities of life, I can't

to excel, that they expect good perfor
mances. I think the enthusiasm is bot
tled up and it's just waiting for some
one to take the cork off. Someone has to
convince them that it's not all that bad
to get excited about their teams. We
need to not be afraid to say that Stan
ford cheers for its teams."
BB: "Well, Dick, you know the BB
has never been afraid of that. Hey,
what can you tell us about this China
team you play tonight, anyway?"
DiBo: "They re from far away."
BB: "Oh."
DiBo: "No. really, they're not a tall
team, but they run well and they're
good shooters. But we think it's going
to be a great game for us. Our players
are really ready to play a game."
BB: "lust thought of something. This

game marks the return of dunking to
Stanford. Who would you say is your
No. 1 dunker, Dick?"
Dißo: "Well, probably Dick
Dohrman."
BB: "Okay, just one more question
and we'll let you go."
DiBo: "What's that?"
BB: "What did you t hi nk of our meat
loaf tonight?"
DiBo: "On a scale of one to 10. I'd
give it a nine."
BB: "Ah. now there's .i man who
knows what he's talking about."

It was springtime at Stanford.
Finals and suntans were the order of
business. Basketball season had been
over for awhile. Thus, when the an
nouncement came, no one really
noticed.
What had transpired, it was learned
later, was that the head basketball
coaches of the Pacific-8 had named
Dick Dißiaso their Coach of the Year.
Stanford's Dick Dißiaso. The same
Dick Dißiaso that had gone 9-18 in his
first year as a head coach. Yes, the guy
who's team won three out of 14 confer
ence games.
Okay, officially he was named co-
Coach of the Year (sharing the award
with Washington State's Ceorge
Raveling), but considering the above
statistics, and the sacredness of win
loss records to the coaching profes
sion, the announcement was startling.
Now, nearly eight months have pas
sed since the award was presented,
and still not that much has been made
of it. But living somewhere in a sec
luded region ofPalo Alto, thereexistsa
small, but hardy band of youths who
have been duly impressed. The "Bas
ketball Brigade" (BB), they call them
selves. Fanatics supreme.
This bunch got to talking, not too
long ago. and came to the conclusion
that even though Stanford again lost
most of its games last year, the team
was a little bit different than usual. The
Cardinals seemed to always be in it
until the end and there was, well,

"Obviously you can't do it (have a winning prog
ram) overnight. It takes time. How much time is hard
to say, but in order to sustain, say, a 20-6 record, there
has to be a lot of other things you do. We feel like we've
laid a good foundation. There seems to be more ex
citement in the area now, set attendance records last
year, we will have TV coverage this year, we have new
attitudes ... a lot of good things have happened."

maybe a little more enthusiasm. And.
they decided, maybe this Dißiaso had
something to do with it.
So it was that on the eve of the "New
Era's" sophomore campaign —a Tai
wan National team starts it off to
night in Maples Pavilion — that BB
arranged to meet the man behind it all.
With a meat loaf as enticement, they
brought Dißiaso to their abode (a
charming place that Dißiaso irreve
rently dubbed The Barn).
BB: "Well, first of all. Dick, we're
glad you came, but we're not sure if
we're going to let you get away with
calling our house 'The Barn.' "
DiBo: "Well, there's really nothing
wrong with living in a barn. President
Lincoln didn't have a barn, he only had
a one-room log cabin. Anyway, this
place maybe rustic and it hasa definite
personality, but let's face it, its got to
be a converted barn (after rearranging
the haystacks, the BB relented and
moved on)."
BB: "Okay, let's talk basketball a bit.
About that Coach of the Year award, it
would seem that such an honor would
mean a lot to someone just finishing
his first year as a head coach."
DiBo: "Well it just so happens that
the same day I found out about it.the

Ramada Inn 1 was staying at burned
down, so it meant a lot more to me that
I got out of there alive."
BB: "But after you cooled off, you
must have realized that the award in
dicated that the other coaches in the
league had a great deal of admiration
for the job you did."
DiBo: "1 think my being chosen was
a direct tribute to the players. Being a
9-18 team, the other coaches recog
nized that our guys were playing as
well as they could, that they played to
their full potential. Now, no doubt
there's some input from me, but I'm
only as good as my players."
BB: "So what is the role of a coach
then?"
DiBo: "Vince Lombardi is often
credited with having said, 'win
ning isn't everything, it's the only
thing.' But he never said that. What he
said was, 'The will to win is not nearly
as important as the will to prepare to
win.' Teaching your team how to win,
how to prepare to win will take care of
whether you win or not, and all we try
to do is to get them to understand that
whatever they're doing, at the time
they're doing it, they should be doing
the very best they can."
BB: "But what if winning doesn't
take care of itself? Can you be success
ful if you're not winning?"
DiBo: "We think it's important that
the players wrestle with the question
of what they're supposed to feel like at
the end of a game. Because if you win a
game and you really didn't work hard
to win it and you didn't play well, you

could have less inner satisfaction than
if you really worked hard and then you
lost, but were able to say that you did
your best."
BB: "But you always feel bad when
you lose."
DiBo: "Sure you do, that's why you
play the game — to win. But there's
nothing wrong with blowing it. I mean
the game isn't that important. You
know, of the priorities of life, I can't
imagine a basketball game being very
high up. What is very high up is what a
player thinks of during the game and
what he has done in preparation for the
game."
BB: "But Dick, let's face it, in sports
circles, everything is judged by wins
and losses."
DiBo: "Well, that's not the standard
that my players have to play by. But
yes, I personally have to learn to deal
with winning and losing because
that's how coaches are hired and fired
And that's how 1 am. anyway. I am a
goal-oriented person. I talked before
about success and I believe all that, but
I also know what's good for me and 1
like to add to that a little bit."
BB: "How much would you like to
add to that? Could you be a little more
specific?"

DiBo: "What you're really asking is,
'What do you think winning is? Is it
being 14-13? Winning the league once
in awhile? Winning the league every
year?' Well ... 1 don't know."
BB: "You mentioned 14-13. Could
you be happy hovering around 50 per
cent?"
DiBo: "No."
BB: "That brings up the question of
whether you'd stay at Stanford if you
found out that you couldn't do better
than 50-50 here."
DiBo: "Right now I don't even
entertain the thought of being
50-50. Four years from now if we'rf
50-50 I might not have any choice in
the matter. But right now I don't have
any thoughts of leaving. 1 think it
would be a supreme sign of ego to
think that you're leaving someplace
after you've been 9-18. I'm just hopeful
that they think we're doing a good
enough job to keep us."
BB: "How long do you give yourself
to build a consistently winning prog
ram?"
DiBo: "Obviously you can't do it
overnight. It takes time. How much
time is hard to say, but in order to sus
tain, say, a 20-6 record, there must be a
lot of other things you do. We feel like
we've laid a good foundation. There
seems to be more excitement in the
area now; we set attendance records
last year; we will have TV coverage
this year, we have new attitudes ... a
lot of good things have happened."
BB: "So obviously wins and losses
aren't the only thing that matters."
DiBo: "I'd enjoy things a lot more if
we have a wi nni ng season, but I'm very
happy here right now. My brother-in
law told me that I'm totally stoned,
meaning that I'm doing what I want to
do where I want to do it. And it's true."
"I look forward to working every
day. It's pretty exciting to try to do
something at a place where it's never
been done before. You know we've
only had one winning season here in
the last eight, so now it's really neat to
try to get everyone involved, and to try
to turn things around."
BB: "So how do you approach the
concept of turning things around?
DiBo: "The way we look at the sea
son is that there are seven or eight
games you're going to win, and seven
that you'll lose, because almost no one
wins more than 20. Then there are 10
or 12 that can go either way. I think you
have to figure out why you win or lose
those ones that go either way and then
concentrate on improving those as
pects of your team. Now, last year we
lost 11 games by six points or less. You
can look at that in different ways, but I
think our players really played well in
some of those games to even be within
five or six points."
BB: "Granted, it was a better season
than the record would indicate, and
considering that it was your first year.
9-18 isn't so bad. But you must think
you can win more this year, and cer
tainly by now you've gone over the
schedule and decided exactly how
many games you think you should
win."
DiBo: "Sure. I've probably done it a
half a dozen times."
BB: "So give us a figure."
DiBo: "I plead the fifth."
BB: "Why?"
DiBo: "I just think that at this point

in our program, that's not what is im
portant."
BB: "Okay, forget the numbers then.
You must have a goal, like getting in a
post-season tournament, say."
DiBo: "That's too tough to say right
now, when you're coming off 9-18 and
counting on young people. 1 don't
want to put our players under any un
necessary pressure."
BB: "Does that mean that you don't
want the players to set goals for them
selves?"

DiBo: "No, I just don't want our
guys to have unrealistic goals. We
can't tie ourselves down to a number.
Now, that's not to say that we're not
optimistic. We are. You have to think
every year is the year you're going to
turn the corner, and you just have to go
out and hope you can do it. If we work
hard, and just go out and play, and if
the players believe and, at this stage,
don't let themselves be caught into
'how many,' who knows what can
happen? Maybe we can turn around
and be like Digger Phelp's year at For
dham:26-3. Who would have expected
that?"
BB: "So who's going to play the part
of Charlie Yelverton?"
DiBo: "I don't know about that, but if
you're asking about our players. . . ."
BB: "Yes. we are."
DiBo: "As you know, we have three
starters back from last year: Mike
Bratz, Wolfe Perry and George
Schader. Wolfe has learned a lot from
the year's experience. He's a better bal
lhandler. He knows offenses and de
fenses better now, he plays within his
limitations better. Mike, I think, will
benefit from having run the team last
year, and in addition to quarterback
ing. he is very capable of scoring, as he
proved last year. I think we have very
good guards. George looks improved,
too. He's had greater stability and con
sistency so far.
BB: "You said the other two starters
against China would be Jeff Mcllugh
and kimberly Belton McHugh has
looked much improved in practice so
far. but can he play center in the Pac
-8?"
DiBo: "He's not a true Pac-8 center,
no, which means we'll have some
problems on defense, but he gives us
mobility at center. He is playing with a
great deal of confidence and the ex
perience of a year, and he can shoot the
eyes out of the basket, so he's going to
be a problem to defense for a big
center."
BB: "And how about kimberly?
What can we expect from him?"
DiBo: "Kimberly is what you
would call a 'power forward,' a guy
who's going to take it inside and get
rebounds and offensive taps. That's
where he feels most comfortable. He's
a good player, and I think he'll become
a very good player. For this year, we
just hope he can make as significant a
contribution as Wolfe did as a
fresh ma n ."

BB: "So where does this leave Jay
Carter?"
DiBo: "Jay has been really good for
us coming off the bench, either at
guard or forward. Every coach looks
for a sixth man who can give you a
spark, and he seems to be able to do it,
so we'd like to see him in that role."
BB: "In addition to kimberly, you
signed Tom Schmalzried and Doug
Barnes this past year. Are you happy
with your recruiting success?"
DiBo: "Yes, we feel we've had good

"I think my being chosen (Pac-8 co-Coach of the Year) was a direct tribute to the
players. Being a 9-18 team, the other coaches recognized our guys were playing as well
as they could, that they played to their full potential. Now no doubt there's some input
from me, but I'm only as good as my players."

recruiting years two years in a row
now, but unfortunately, it's still not up
to what some of the other Pac-8 teams
have done in that two-year period."
BB: "But wouldn't you say that
you've closed the gap somewhat? For
example, isn't getting kimberly from
New York City somewhat of a coup?"
DiBo: "The fact that we got three
players, Tom, Doug and Kimberly,
from Florida, Colorado and New York
respectively, does many things for us.
Now, for instance, we go to New York
again and they know who we are. Now
they know Stanford is not in Connec
ticut. Now there's another kid on the
block."
"This is all part of a large plan. We're
out there now. They now know about
Stanford."
BB: "You talk about a 'large plan,'
hut isn't that necessarily reduced
somewhat by the academic require
ments at Stanford?"
DiBo: "Well, this is definitely an ob
stacle, but we think we can overcome
it. That is, because of the athletic and
academic mix at Stanford, we just have
to go beyond California to find enough
people that are both students and cap
able of playing top-level Pac-8 basket
ball. So our recruiting is national, and
because of that, our player pool is
large."
"We can find qualified student
athletes throughout the country, but
the further you go the harder it is to
recruit, so the big problem becomes
selling someone who's 2000 miles
away on Stanford."
BB: "But obviously you feel vou can

'winning isn't everything it's the only thing.' But he
never said that. What he said was, 'the will to win is

overcome this too. So say you get the
players here, then what? Stanford
people often pride themselves on
keeping sports in perspective.' In
volvement is important to you — do
you think the people here will respond
with the enthusiasm of the basketball
fans at. say. Oregon?"
DiHo: "Yes. I think once we get the
players and we play exciting basket
hall. we'll get the people, and the fans
will become like those at any other
place that has 8000 seats and 8000
seats with people in them."

BB: "In addition to getting the
players, what other things do you
think can or should be done to increase
enthusiasm?"
DiBo: "I think this idea of keeping
sports low-key, of the Stanford
student-athlete with different
priorities, starts with the student
athletes themselves. My feelitig is that
they should stand up and be counted
and say, 'Hey, I'm here for an educa
tion, but I also really enjoy playing
basketball.' But I think the athlete

sometimes cops out by saying, 'Well,
we lost today, but that's okay because
we're more interested in going to med
school or law school.'
"If the athlete wi 11 somehow face his
peer pressure and say, 'I really enjoy
being on a team because it's a great
atmosphere and those 2 x h hours a day
really help me out,' then maybe we can
push down this image of the student
athlete at Stanford who is really only
interested in an education. Because
our guys want both, and I want them to
be able to say it without feeling like
they're not supposed to."
BB: "And you feel if they set this
kind of example, the student body will
follow?"
DiBo: "Yes. The impressions I get
from speaking with students at the
dorms is that they want their athletes
to excel, that they expect good perfor
mances. I think the enthusiasm is bot
tled up and it's just waiting for some
one to take the cork off. Someone has to

and be like Digger Phelp's year at For
dham:26-3. Who would have expected
that?"
BB: "So who's going to play the part
of Charlie Yelverton?"
DiBo: "I don't know about that, but if
you're asking about our players. . . ."
BB: "Yes. we are."
DiBo: "As you know, we have three
starters back from last year: Mike
Bratz, Wolfe Perry and George
Schader. Wolfe has learned a lot from
the year's experience. He's a better bal
lhandler. He knows offenses and de
fenses better now, he plays within his
limitations better. Mike, I think, will
benefit from having run the team last
year, and in addition to quarterback
ing. he is very capable of scoring, as he
proved last year. I think we have very
good guards. George looks improved,
too. He's had greater stability and con
sistency so far.
BB: "You said the other two starters
against China would be Jeff Mcllugh
and kimberly Belton McHugh has
looked much improved in practice so
far. but can he play center in the Pac
-8?"
DiBo: "He's not a true Pac-8 center,
no, which means we'll have some
problems on defense, but he gives us
mobility at center. He is playing with a
great deal of confidence and the ex
perience of a year, and he can shoot the
eyes out of the basket, so he's going to
be a problem to defense for a big
center."
BB: "And how about kimberly?
What can we expect from him?"
DiBo: "Kimberly is what you
would call a 'power forward,' a guy
who's going to take it inside and get
rebounds and offensive taps. That's
where he feels most comfortable. He's
a good player, and I think he'll become
a very good player. For this year, we
just hope he can make as significant a
contribution as Wolfe did as a
fresh ma n ."

BB: "So where does this leave Jay
Carter?"
DiBo: "Jay has been really good for
us coming off the bench, either at
guard or forward. Every coach looks
for a sixth man who can give you a
spark, and he seems to be able to do it,
so we'd like to see him in that role."
BB: "In addition to kimberly, you
signed Tom Schmalzried and Doug
Barnes this past year. Are you happy
with your recruiting success?"
DiBo: "Yes, we feel we've had good

"I think my being chosen (Pac-8 co-Coach of the Year) was a direct tribute to the
players. Being a 9-18 team, the other coaches recognized our guys were playing as well
as they could, that they played to their full potential. Now no doubt there's some input
from me, but I'm only as good as my players."

recruiting years two years in a row
now, but unfortunately, it's still not up
to what some of the other Pac-8 teams
have done in that two-year period."
BB: "But wouldn't you say that
you've closed the gap somewhat? For
example, isn't getting kimberly from
New York City somewhat of a coup?"
DiBo: "The fact that we got three
players, Tom, Doug and Kimberly,
from Florida, Colorado and New York
respectively, does many things for us.
Now, for instance, we go to New York
again and they know who we are. Now
they know Stanford is not in Connec
ticut. Now there's another kid on the
block."
"This is all part of a large plan. We're
out there now. They now know about
Stanford."
BB: "You talk about a 'large plan,'
hut isn't that necessarily reduced
somewhat by the academic require
ments at Stanford?"
DiBo: "Well, this is definitely an ob
stacle, but we think we can overcome
it. That is, because of the athletic and
academic mix at Stanford, we just have
to go beyond California to find enough
people that are both students and cap
able of playing top-level Pac-8 basket
ball. So our recruiting is national, and
because of that, our player pool is
large."
"We can find qualified student
athletes throughout the country, but
the further you go the harder it is to
recruit, so the big problem becomes
selling someone who's 2000 miles
away on Stanford."
BB: "But obviously you feel vou can

"Vince Lombardi is often credited with having said
'winning isn't everything it's the only thing.' But he
never said that. What he said was, 'the will to win is

overcome this too. So say you get the
players here, then what? Stanford
people often pride themselves on
keeping sports in perspective.' In
volvement is important to you — do
you think the people here will respond
with the enthusiasm of the basketball
fans at. say. Oregon?"
DiHo: "Yes. I think once we get the
players and we play exciting basket
hall. we'll get the people, and the fans
will become like those at any other
place that has 8000 seats and 8000
seats with people in them."

BB: "In addition to getting the
players, what other things do you
think can or should be done to increase
enthusiasm?"
DiBo: "I think this idea of keeping
sports low-key, of the Stanford
student-athlete with different
priorities, starts with the student
athletes themselves. My feelitig is that
they should stand up and be counted
and say, 'Hey, I'm here for an educa
tion, but I also really enjoy playing
basketball.' But I think the athlete

sometimes cops out by saying, 'Well,
we lost today, but that's okay because
we're more interested in going to med
school or law school.'
"If the athlete wi 11 somehow face his
peer pressure and say, 'I really enjoy
being on a team because it's a great
atmosphere and those 2 x h hours a day
really help me out,' then maybe we can
push down this image of the student
athlete at Stanford who is really only
interested in an education. Because
our guys want both, and I want them to
be able to say it without feeling like
they're not supposed to."
BB: "And you feel if they set this
kind of example, the student body will
follow?"
DiBo: "Yes. The impressions I get
from speaking with students at the
dorms is that they want their athletes
to excel, that they expect good perfor
mances. I think the enthusiasm is bot
tled up and it's just waiting for some
one to take the cork off. Someone has to
convince them that it's not all that bad
to get excited about their teams. We
need to not be afraid to say that Stan
ford cheers for its teams."
BB: "Well, Dick, you know the BB
has never been afraid of that. Hey,
what can you tell us about this China
team you play tonight, anyway?"
DiBo: "They re from far away."
BB: "Oh."
DiBo: "No. really, they're not a tall
team, but they run well and they're
good shooters. But we think it's going
to be a great game for us. Our players
are really ready to play a game."
BB: "lust thought of something. This

game marks the return of dunking to
Stanford. Who would you say is your
No. 1 dunker, Dick?"
Dißo: "Well, probably Dick
Dohrman."
BB: "Okay, just one more question
and we'll let you go."
DiBo: "What's that?"
BB: "What did you t hi nk of our meat
loaf tonight?"
DiBo: "On a scale of one to 10. I'd
give it a nine."
BB: "Ah. now there's .i man who
knows what he's talking about."

It was springtime at Stanford.
Finals and suntans were the order of
business. Basketball season had been
over for awhile. Thus, when the an
nouncement came, no one really
noticed.
What had transpired, it was learned
later, was that the head basketball
coaches of the Pacific-8 had named
Dick Dißiaso their Coach of the Year.
Stanford's Dick Dißiaso. The same
Dick Dißiaso that had gone 9-18 in his
first year as a head coach. Yes, the guy
who's team won three out of 14 confer
ence games.
Okay, officially he was named co-
Coach of the Year (sharing the award
with Washington State's Ceorge
Raveling), but considering the above
statistics, and the sacredness of win
loss records to the coaching profes
sion, the announcement was startling.
Now, nearly eight months have pas
sed since the award was presented,
and still not that much has been made
of it. But living somewhere in a sec
luded region ofPalo Alto, thereexistsa
small, but hardy band of youths who
have been duly impressed. The "Bas
ketball Brigade" (BB), they call them
selves. Fanatics supreme.
This bunch got to talking, not too
long ago. and came to the conclusion
that even though Stanford again lost
most of its games last year, the team
was a little bit different than usual. The
Cardinals seemed to always be in it
until the end and there was, well,

"Obviously you can't do it (have a winning prog
ram) overnight. It takes time. How much time is hard
to say, but in order to sustain, say, a 20-6 record, there
has to be a lot of other things you do. We feel like we've
laid a good foundation. There seems to be more ex
citement in the area now, set attendance records last
year, we will have TV coverage this year, we have new
attitudes ... a lot of good things have happened."

maybe a little more enthusiasm. And.
they decided, maybe this Dißiaso had
something to do with it.
So it was that on the eve of the "New
Era's" sophomore campaign —a Tai
wan National team starts it off to
night in Maples Pavilion — that BB
arranged to meet the man behind it all.
With a meat loaf as enticement, they
brought Dißiaso to their abode (a
charming place that Dißiaso irreve
rently dubbed The Barn).
BB: "Well, first of all. Dick, we're
glad you came, but we're not sure if
we're going to let you get away with
calling our house 'The Barn.' "
DiBo: "Well, there's really nothing
wrong with living in a barn. President
Lincoln didn't have a barn, he only had
a one-room log cabin. Anyway, this
place maybe rustic and it hasa definite
personality, but let's face it, its got to
be a converted barn (after rearranging
the haystacks, the BB relented and
moved on)."
BB: "Okay, let's talk basketball a bit.
About that Coach of the Year award, it
would seem that such an honor would
mean a lot to someone just finishing
his first year as a head coach."
DiBo: "Well it just so happens that
the same day I found out about it.the

Ramada Inn 1 was staying at burned
down, so it meant a lot more to me that
I got out of there alive."
BB: "But after you cooled off, you
must have realized that the award in
dicated that the other coaches in the
league had a great deal of admiration
for the job you did."
DiBo: "1 think my being chosen was
a direct tribute to the players. Being a
9-18 team, the other coaches recog
nized that our guys were playing as
well as they could, that they played to
their full potential. Now, no doubt
there's some input from me, but I'm
only as good as my players."
BB: "So what is the role of a coach
then?"
DiBo: "Vince Lombardi is often
credited with having said, 'win
ning isn't everything, it's the only
thing.' But he never said that. What he
said was, 'The will to win is not nearly
as important as the will to prepare to
win.' Teaching your team how to win,
how to prepare to win will take care of
whether you win or not, and all we try
to do is to get them to understand that
whatever they're doing, at the time
they're doing it, they should be doing
the very best they can."
BB: "But what if winning doesn't
take care of itself? Can you be success
ful if you're not winning?"
DiBo: "We think it's important that
the players wrestle with the question
of what they're supposed to feel like at
the end of a game. Because if you win a
game and you really didn't work hard
to win it and you didn't play well, you

could have less inner satisfaction than
if you really worked hard and then you
lost, but were able to say that you did
your best."
BB: "But you always feel bad when
you lose."
DiBo: "Sure you do, that's why you
play the game — to win. But there's
nothing wrong with blowing it. I mean
the game isn't that important. You
know, of the priorities of life, I can't
imagine a basketball game being very
high up. What is very high up is what a
player thinks of during the game and
what he has done in preparation for the
game."
BB: "But Dick, let's face it, in sports
circles, everything is judged by wins
and losses."
DiBo: "Well, that's not the standard
that my players have to play by. But
yes, I personally have to learn to deal
with winning and losing because
that's how coaches are hired and fired
And that's how 1 am. anyway. I am a
goal-oriented person. I talked before
about success and I believe all that, but
I also know what's good for me and 1
like to add to that a little bit."
BB: "How much would you like to
add to that? Could you be a little more
specific?"

DiBo: "What you're really asking is,
'What do you think winning is? Is it
being 14-13? Winning the league once
in awhile? Winning the league every
year?' Well ... 1 don't know."
BB: "You mentioned 14-13. Could
you be happy hovering around 50 per
cent?"
DiBo: "No."
BB: "That brings up the question of
whether you'd stay at Stanford if you
found out that you couldn't do better
than 50-50 here."
DiBo: "Right now I don't even
entertain the thought of being
50-50. Four years from now if we'rf
50-50 I might not have any choice in
the matter. But right now I don't have
any thoughts of leaving. 1 think it
would be a supreme sign of ego to
think that you're leaving someplace
after you've been 9-18. I'm just hopeful
that they think we're doing a good
enough job to keep us."
BB: "How long do you give yourself
to build a consistently winning prog
ram?"
DiBo: "Obviously you can't do it
overnight. It takes time. How much
time is hard to say, but in order to sus
tain, say, a 20-6 record, there must be a
lot of other things you do. We feel like
we've laid a good foundation. There
seems to be more excitement in the
area now; we set attendance records
last year; we will have TV coverage
this year, we have new attitudes ... a
lot of good things have happened."
BB: "So obviously wins and losses
aren't the only thing that matters."
DiBo: "I'd enjoy things a lot more if
we have a wi nni ng season, but I'm very
happy here right now. My brother-in
law told me that I'm totally stoned,
meaning that I'm doing what I want to
do where I want to do it. And it's true."
"I look forward to working every
day. It's pretty exciting to try to do
something at a place where it's never
been done before. You know we've
only had one winning season here in
the last eight, so now it's really neat to
try to get everyone involved, and to try
to turn things around."
BB: "So how do you approach the
concept of turning things around?
DiBo: "The way we look at the sea
son is that there are seven or eight
games you're going to win, and seven
that you'll lose, because almost no one
wins more than 20. Then there are 10
or 12 that can go either way. I think you
have to figure out why you win or lose
those ones that go either way and then
concentrate on improving those as
pects of your team. Now, last year we
lost 11 games by six points or less. You
can look at that in different ways, but I
think our players really played well in
some of those games to even be within
five or six points."
BB: "Granted, it was a better season
than the record would indicate, and
considering that it was your first year.
9-18 isn't so bad. But you must think
you can win more this year, and cer
tainly by now you've gone over the
schedule and decided exactly how
many games you think you should
win."
DiBo: "Sure. I've probably done it a
half a dozen times."
BB: "So give us a figure."
DiBo: "I plead the fifth."
BB: "Why?"
DiBo: "I just think that at this point

in our program, that's not what is im
portant."
BB: "Okay, forget the numbers then.
You must have a goal, like getting in a
post-season tournament, say."
DiBo: "That's too tough to say right
now, when you're coming off 9-18 and
counting on young people. 1 don't
want to put our players under any un
necessary pressure."
BB: "Does that mean that you don't
want the players to set goals for them
selves?"

DiBo: "No, I just don't want our
guys to have unrealistic goals. We
can't tie ourselves down to a number.
Now, that's not to say that we're not
optimistic. We are. You have to think
every year is the year you're going to
turn the corner, and you just have to go
out and hope you can do it. If we work
hard, and just go out and play, and if
the players believe and, at this stage,
don't let themselves be caught into
'how many,' who knows what can
happen? Maybe we can turn around
and be like Digger Phelp's year at For
dham:26-3. Who would have expected
that?"
BB: "So who's going to play the part
of Charlie Yelverton?"
DiBo: "I don't know about that, but if
you're asking about our players. . . ."
BB: "Yes. we are."
DiBo: "As you know, we have three
starters back from last year: Mike
Bratz, Wolfe Perry and George

whatever they're doing, at the time
they're doing it, they should be doing
the very best they can."
BB: "But what if winning doesn't
take care of itself? Can you be success
ful if you're not winning?"
DiBo: "We think it's important that
the players wrestle with the question
of what they're supposed to feel like at
the end of a game. Because if you win a
game and you really didn't work hard
to win it and you didn't play well, you

could have less inner satisfaction than
if you really worked hard and then you
lost, but were able to say that you did
your best."
BB: "But you always feel bad when
you lose."
DiBo: "Sure you do, that's why you
play the game — to win. But there's
nothing wrong with blowing it. I mean
the game isn't that important. You
know, of the priorities of life, I can't
imagine a basketball game being very
high up. What is very high up is what a
player thinks of during the game and
what he has done in preparation for the
game."
BB: "But Dick, let's face it, in sports
circles, everything is judged by wins
and losses."
DiBo: "Well, that's not the standard
that my players have to play by. But
yes, I personally have to learn to deal
with winning and losing because
that's how coaches are hired and fired
And that's how 1 am. anyway. I am a
goal-oriented person. I talked before
about success and I believe all that, but
I also know what's good for me and 1
like to add to that a little bit."
BB: "How much would you like to
add to that? Could you be a little more
specific?"

DiBo: "What you're really asking is,
'What do you think winning is? Is it
being 14-13? Winning the league once
in awhile? Winning the league every
year?' Well ... 1 don't know."
BB: "You mentioned 14-13. Could
you be happy hovering around 50 per
cent?"
DiBo: "No."
BB: "That brings up the question of
whether you'd stay at Stanford if you
found out that you couldn't do better
than 50-50 here."
DiBo: "Right now I don't even
entertain the thought of being
50-50. Four years from now if we'rf
50-50 I might not have any choice in
the matter. But right now I don't have
any thoughts of leaving. 1 think it
would be a supreme sign of ego to
think that you're leaving someplace
after you've been 9-18. I'm just hopeful
that they think we're doing a good
enough job to keep us."
BB: "How long do you give yourself
to build a consistently winning prog
ram?"
DiBo: "Obviously you can't do it
overnight. It takes time. How much
time is hard to say, but in order to sus
tain, say, a 20-6 record, there must be a
lot of other things you do. We feel like
we've laid a good foundation. There
seems to be more excitement in the
area now; we set attendance records
last year; we will have TV coverage
this year, we have new attitudes ... a
lot of good things have happened."
BB: "So obviously wins and losses
aren't the only thing that matters."
DiBo: "I'd enjoy things a lot more if
we have a wi nni ng season, but I'm very
happy here right now. My brother-in
law told me that I'm totally stoned,
meaning that I'm doing what I want to
do where I want to do it. And it's true."
"I look forward to working every
day. It's pretty exciting to try to do
something at a place where it's never
been done before. You know we've
only had one winning season here in
the last eight, so now it's really neat to
try to get everyone involved, and to try
to turn things around."
BB: "So how do you approach the
concept of turning things around?
DiBo: "The way we look at the sea
son is that there are seven or eight
games you're going to win, and seven
that you'll lose, because almost no one
wins more than 20. Then there are 10
or 12 that can go either way. I think you
have to figure out why you win or lose
those ones that go either way and then
concentrate on improving those as
pects of your team. Now, last year we
lost 11 games by six points or less. You
can look at that in different ways, but I
think our players really played well in
some of those games to even be within
five or six points."
BB: "Granted, it was a better season
than the record would indicate, and
considering that it was your first year.
9-18 isn't so bad. But you must think
you can win more this year, and cer
tainly by now you've gone over the
schedule and decided exactly how
many games you think you should
win."
DiBo: "Sure. I've probably done it a
half a dozen times."
BB: "So give us a figure."
DiBo: "I plead the fifth."
BB: "Why?"
DiBo: "I just think that at this point

in our program, that's not what is im
portant."
BB: "Okay, forget the numbers then.
You must have a goal, like getting in a
post-season tournament, say."
DiBo: "That's too tough to say right
now, when you're coming off 9-18 and
counting on young people. 1 don't
want to put our players under any un
necessary pressure."
BB: "Does that mean that you don't
want the players to set goals for them
selves?"

DiBo: "No, I just don't want our
guys to have unrealistic goals. We
can't tie ourselves down to a number.
Now, that's not to say that we're not
optimistic. We are. You have to think
every year is the year you're going to
turn the corner, and you just have to go
out and hope you can do it. If we work
hard, and just go out and play, and if
the players believe and, at this stage,
don't let themselves be caught into
'how many,' who knows what can
happen? Maybe we can turn around
and be like Digger Phelp's year at For
dham:26-3. Who would have expected
that?"
BB: "So who's going to play the part
of Charlie Yelverton?"
DiBo: "I don't know about that, but if
you're asking about our players. . . ."
BB: "Yes. we are."
DiBo: "As you know, we have three
starters back from last year: Mike
Bratz, Wolfe Perry and George
Schader. Wolfe has learned a lot from
the year's experience. He's a better bal
lhandler. He knows offenses and de
fenses better now, he plays within his
limitations better. Mike, I think, will
benefit from having run the team last
year, and in addition to quarterback
ing. he is very capable of scoring, as he
proved last year. I think we have very
good guards. George looks improved,
too. He's had greater stability and con
sistency so far.
BB: "You said the other two starters
against China would be Jeff Mcllugh
and kimberly Belton McHugh has
looked much improved in practice so
far. but can he play center in the Pac
-8?"
DiBo: "He's not a true Pac-8 center,
no, which means we'll have some
problems on defense, but he gives us
mobility at center. He is playing with a
great deal of confidence and the ex
perience of a year, and he can shoot the
eyes out of the basket, so he's going to
be a problem to defense for a big
center."
BB: "And how about kimberly?
What can we expect from him?"
DiBo: "Kimberly is what you
would call a 'power forward,' a guy
who's going to take it inside and get
rebounds and offensive taps. That's
where he feels most comfortable. He's
a good player, and I think he'll become
a very good player. For this year, we
just hope he can make as significant a
contribution as Wolfe did as a
fresh ma n ."

BB: "So where does this leave Jay
Carter?"
DiBo: "Jay has been really good for
us coming off the bench, either at
guard or forward. Every coach looks
for a sixth man who can give you a
spark, and he seems to be able to do it,
so we'd like to see him in that role."
BB: "In addition to kimberly, you
signed Tom Schmalzried and Doug
Barnes this past year. Are you happy
with your recruiting success?"
DiBo: "Yes, we feel we've had good

"I think my being chosen (Pac-8 co-Coach of the Year) was a direct tribute to the
players. Being a 9-18 team, the other coaches recognized our guys were playing as well
as they could, that they played to their full potential. Now no doubt there's some input
from me, but I'm only as good as my players."

recruiting years two years in a row
now, but unfortunately, it's still not up
to what some of the other Pac-8 teams
have done in that two-year period."
BB: "But wouldn't you say that
you've closed the gap somewhat? For
example, isn't getting kimberly from
New York City somewhat of a coup?"
DiBo: "The fact that we got three
players, Tom, Doug and Kimberly,
from Florida, Colorado and New York
respectively, does many things for us.
Now, for instance, we go to New York
again and they know who we are. Now
they know Stanford is not in Connec
ticut. Now there's another kid on the
block."
"This is all part of a large plan. We're
out there now. They now know about
Stanford."
BB: "You talk about a 'large plan,'
hut isn't that necessarily reduced
somewhat by the academic require
ments at Stanford?"
DiBo: "Well, this is definitely an ob
stacle, but we think we can overcome
it. That is, because of the athletic and
academic mix at Stanford, we just have
to go beyond California to find enough
people that are both students and cap
able of playing top-level Pac-8 basket
ball. So our recruiting is national, and
because of that, our player pool is
large."
"We can find qualified student
athletes throughout the country, but
the further you go the harder it is to
recruit, so the big problem becomes
selling someone who's 2000 miles
away on Stanford."
BB: "But obviously you feel vou can

"Vince Lombardi is often credited with having said
'winning isn't everything it's the only thing.' But he
never said that. What he said was, 'the will to win is
not nearly as important as the will to prepare to win'. . ."

overcome this too. So say you get the
players here, then what? Stanford
people often pride themselves on
keeping sports in perspective.' In
volvement is important to you — do
you think the people here will respond
with the enthusiasm of the basketball
fans at. say. Oregon?"
DiHo: "Yes. I think once we get the
players and we play exciting basket
hall. we'll get the people, and the fans
will become like those at any other
place that has 8000 seats and 8000
seats with people in them."

BB: "In addition to getting the
players, what other things do you
think can or should be done to increase
enthusiasm?"
DiBo: "I think this idea of keeping
sports low-key, of the Stanford
student-athlete with different
priorities, starts with the student
athletes themselves. My feelitig is that
they should stand up and be counted
and say, 'Hey, I'm here for an educa
tion, but I also really enjoy playing
basketball.' But I think the athlete

sometimes cops out by saying, 'Well,
we lost today, but that's okay because
we're more interested in going to med
school or law school.'
"If the athlete wi 11 somehow face his
peer pressure and say, 'I really enjoy
being on a team because it's a great
atmosphere and those 2 x h hours a day
really help me out,' then maybe we can
push down this image of the student
athlete at Stanford who is really only
interested in an education. Because
our guys want both, and I want them to
be able to say it without feeling like
they're not supposed to."
BB: "And you feel if they set this
kind of example, the student body will
follow?"
DiBo: "Yes. The impressions I get
from speaking with students at the
dorms is that they want their athletes
to excel, that they expect good perfor
mances. I think the enthusiasm is bot
tled up and it's just waiting for some
one to take the cork off. Someone has to
convince them that it's not all that bad
to get excited about their teams. We
need to not be afraid to say that Stan
ford cheers for its teams."
BB: "Well, Dick, you know the BB
has never been afraid of that. Hey,
what can you tell us about this China
team you play tonight, anyway?"
DiBo: "They re from far away."
BB: "Oh."
DiBo: "No. really, they're not a tall
team, but they run well and they're
good shooters. But we think it's going
to be a great game for us. Our players
are really ready to play a game."
BB: "lust thought of something. This

game marks the return of dunking to
Stanford. Who would you say is your
No. 1 dunker, Dick?"
Dißo: "Well, probably Dick
Dohrman."
BB: "Okay, just one more question
and we'll let you go."
DiBo: "What's that?"
BB: "What did you t hi nk of our meat
loaf tonight?"
DiBo: "On a scale of one to 10. I'd
give it a nine."
BB: "Ah. now there's .i man who
knows what he's talking about."
