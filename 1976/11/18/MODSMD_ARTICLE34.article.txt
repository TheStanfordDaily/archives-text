Exhibit evacuated after bomb threat
Moscow — An American Bicentennial exhibit
drawing big Russian crowds was evacuated yester
day after a telephoned bomb threat that left U.S.
officials angered and suspicious of a trick to dam
pen the show's popularity.
The Soviet codirector, Grigory Kuzmenko, said
he received a phone call at 9:24 p.m. from the In
terior Ministry reporting that an unidentified man
had telephoned a warning that a plastic explosive
would go off at 9:30.
Some 1000 Russian visitors inside the building
were calmly evacuated from the pavilion.
The exhibition, the second U.S. national show to
come to the Soviet Union in 17 years, features film
showings, photos, historical displays and a
souvenir kit containing the U.S. Constitution and
Declaration of Independence in Russian.
A search by American and Russian officials
failed to turn up a bomb.
The U.S. exhibit director, Frank Ursino, angrily
asked Soviet officials why it took more than three
hours for a bomb detection team to arrive to make
certain the pavilion was safe to reopen the exhibit.
The officials apologized profusely, saying they had
difficulty finding an expert in plastic explosives.
Tito wins promise of Soviet respect
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — President Tito won a
renewed promise of Soviet respect for the indepen
dence of Yugoslavia and its Communist party from
Soviet leader Lenoid Brezhnev yesterday. Tito de
scribed as "very successful" his three days of talks
with Brezhnev.
A final communique used new language to spell
out the Yugoslavs' determination to maintain their
independent stand in the Communist world. It said
relations between the Yugoslav and Soviet bloc
parties would be based on "internationalist com
radely voluntary cooperation."
The communique said Tito and Brezhnev want to
see Soviet-Yugoslav relations develop along the
lines of "strict respect for the principles of
sovereignty, independence, equality and noninter
ference in domestic affairs."
A Yugoslav government spokesman said later
that despite the talks "major differences between
the two sides remained."

He said these differences include Yugoslavia's
insistence on staying aloof from the Soviet
dominated Warsaw Pact and the country's
economic system, which is considerably more de
centralized and flexible than the Soviets' centrally
planned economy.
Carter desires 'efficiency, harmony'
Lovejoy, Ga. — President-elect Jimmy Carter
asked Congress yesterday for power to reorganize
the federal bureaucracy.
Carter said he wants Congress to re-enact the
so-called Hoover reorganization act which permit
ted the president to change the federal bureaucracy,
subject to a congressional veto.
Carter said that the House and Senate members
received "a pledge on my part to do everything I
can to restore harmony between the White House
and the Congress."
Palestinian guerrillas seize hotel
Amman, Jordan — Four Palestinian guerrillas
seized the Intercontinental Hotel and some hos
tages yesterday, but were overpowered by King
Hussein's shock troops in an attack that left seven
persons dead.
Three gunmen, two employes of the luxury hotel
and two soldiers were killed, a spokesman said.
The fourth gunman was seriously wounded.
He said the gunmen identified themselves as
members of a Palestinian group called "Black
June," formed to protest the Syrian invasion of
Lebanon last June. Its members staged an attack on
a Damascus hotel in September in which one at
tacker and four hostages died and the three surviv
ing gunmen were publicly hanged.
West Bank, Gaza Strip eyed by PLO
United Nations, N.Y. — The foreign affairs
spokesman of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) said yesterday that it is prepared to ac
cept a Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank of the Jordan River, Arab territories now
under Israeli control. 1
Diplomatic sources at the United Nations said it
was the first time the PLO had publicly embraced a
position that long has been implicit in the U.N.'s
diplomatic efforts.
Farouh Kaddoumi, head of the PLO's political

department, claimed the position is not new and
that it is implicit in the Palestinians' "National
Charter" adopted in 1968. That charter also calls for
replacing Israel with a secular state of Arabs, Mos
lems, Christians and Jews — a concept Israel rejects
as tantamount to obliteration of the Jewish state.
Diplomats said Kaddoumi's outright acceptance
of a West Bank-Gaza state was particularly signific
ant in light of a conciliatory speech he made Mon
day in the General Assembly in which there was no
reference to a secular state.
Gilmore regains consciousness
Salt Lake City — Gary Gilmore, who sought to
end the delays in his execution and face a firing
squad as soon as possible, regained consciousness
yesterday, a day after he took a sleeping pill over
dose.
But Nicole Barrett, his girlfriend who joined him
in the suicide pact, remained in a coma in critical
condition, hospital officials said.
The overdoses came one day after Gilmore origi
nally was scheduled for execution for the murder of
Bennie Bushnell, a Provo motel clerk, during a rob
bery.
Today's weather
Patchy low clouds or fog nights and mornings
but sunny afternoons through tomorrow. Little
temperature change. Lows both nights in the mid
40s to mid 50s. Highs both days in the mid 60s to
low 70s. Light winds.

The U.S. exhibit director, Frank Ursino, angrily
asked Soviet officials why it took more than three
hours for a bomb detection team to arrive to make
certain the pavilion was safe to reopen the exhibit.
The officials apologized profusely, saying they had
difficulty finding an expert in plastic explosives.
Tito wins promise of Soviet respect
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — President Tito won a
renewed promise of Soviet respect for the indepen
dence of Yugoslavia and its Communist party from
Soviet leader Lenoid Brezhnev yesterday. Tito de
scribed as "very successful" his three days of talks
with Brezhnev.
A final communique used new language to spell
out the Yugoslavs' determination to maintain their
independent stand in the Communist world. It said
relations between the Yugoslav and Soviet bloc
parties would be based on "internationalist com
radely voluntary cooperation."
The communique said Tito and Brezhnev want to
see Soviet-Yugoslav relations develop along the
lines of "strict respect for the principles of
sovereignty, independence, equality and noninter
ference in domestic affairs."
A Yugoslav government spokesman said later
that despite the talks "major differences between
the two sides remained."

He said these differences include Yugoslavia's
insistence on staying aloof from the Soviet
dominated Warsaw Pact and the country's
economic system, which is considerably more de
centralized and flexible than the Soviets' centrally
planned economy.
Carter desires 'efficiency, harmony'
Lovejoy, Ga. — President-elect Jimmy Carter
asked Congress yesterday for power to reorganize
the federal bureaucracy.
Carter said he wants Congress to re-enact the
so-called Hoover reorganization act which permit
ted the president to change the federal bureaucracy,
subject to a congressional veto.
Carter said that the House and Senate members
received "a pledge on my part to do everything I
can to restore harmony between the White House
and the Congress."
Palestinian guerrillas seize hotel
Amman, Jordan — Four Palestinian guerrillas
seized the Intercontinental Hotel and some hos
tages yesterday, but were overpowered by King
Hussein's shock troops in an attack that left seven
persons dead.
Three gunmen, two employes of the luxury hotel
and two soldiers were killed, a spokesman said.
The fourth gunman was seriously wounded.
He said the gunmen identified themselves as
members of a Palestinian group called "Black
June," formed to protest the Syrian invasion of
Lebanon last June. Its members staged an attack on
a Damascus hotel in September in which one at
tacker and four hostages died and the three surviv
ing gunmen were publicly hanged.
West Bank, Gaza Strip eyed by PLO
United Nations, N.Y. — The foreign affairs
spokesman of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) said yesterday that it is prepared to ac
cept a Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank of the Jordan River, Arab territories now
under Israeli control. 1
Diplomatic sources at the United Nations said it
was the first time the PLO had publicly embraced a
position that long has been implicit in the U.N.'s
diplomatic efforts.
Farouh Kaddoumi, head of the PLO's political

department, claimed the position is not new and
that it is implicit in the Palestinians' "National
Charter" adopted in 1968. That charter also calls for
replacing Israel with a secular state of Arabs, Mos
lems, Christians and Jews — a concept Israel rejects
as tantamount to obliteration of the Jewish state.
Diplomats said Kaddoumi's outright acceptance
of a West Bank-Gaza state was particularly signific
ant in light of a conciliatory speech he made Mon
day in the General Assembly in which there was no
reference to a secular state.

Bennie Bushnell, a Provo motel clerk, during a rob
bery.

Exhibit evacuated after bomb threat
Moscow — An American Bicentennial exhibit
drawing big Russian crowds was evacuated yester
day after a telephoned bomb threat that left U.S.
officials angered and suspicious of a trick to dam
pen the show's popularity.
The Soviet codirector, Grigory Kuzmenko, said
he received a phone call at 9:24 p.m. from the In
terior Ministry reporting that an unidentified man
had telephoned a warning that a plastic explosive
would go off at 9:30.
Some 1000 Russian visitors inside the building
were calmly evacuated from the pavilion.
The exhibition, the second U.S. national show to
come to the Soviet Union in 17 years, features film
showings, photos, historical displays and a
souvenir kit containing the U.S. Constitution and
Declaration of Independence in Russian.

lines of "strict respect for the principles of
sovereignty, independence, equality and noninter
ference in domestic affairs."
A Yugoslav government spokesman said later
that despite the talks "major differences between
the two sides remained."

He said these differences include Yugoslavia's
insistence on staying aloof from the Soviet
dominated Warsaw Pact and the country's
economic system, which is considerably more de
centralized and flexible than the Soviets' centrally
planned economy.

asked Congress yesterday for power to reorganize

so-called Hoover reorganization act which permit

can to restore harmony between the White House
and the Congress."
Palestinian guerrillas seize hotel
Amman, Jordan — Four Palestinian guerrillas
seized the Intercontinental Hotel and some hos
tages yesterday, but were overpowered by King
Hussein's shock troops in an attack that left seven
persons dead.
Three gunmen, two employes of the luxury hotel
and two soldiers were killed, a spokesman said.
The fourth gunman was seriously wounded.
He said the gunmen identified themselves as
members of a Palestinian group called "Black
June," formed to protest the Syrian invasion of
Lebanon last June. Its members staged an attack on
a Damascus hotel in September in which one at
tacker and four hostages died and the three surviv

West Bank, Gaza Strip eyed by PLO
United Nations, N.Y. — The foreign affairs
spokesman of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) said yesterday that it is prepared to ac
cept a Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank of the Jordan River, Arab territories now
under Israeli control. 1
Diplomatic sources at the United Nations said it
was the first time the PLO had publicly embraced a
position that long has been implicit in the U.N.'s
diplomatic efforts.
Farouh Kaddoumi, head of the PLO's political

department, claimed the position is not new and
that it is implicit in the Palestinians' "National
Charter" adopted in 1968. That charter also calls for
replacing Israel with a secular state of Arabs, Mos
lems, Christians and Jews — a concept Israel rejects
as tantamount to obliteration of the Jewish state.
Diplomats said Kaddoumi's outright acceptance
of a West Bank-Gaza state was particularly signific
ant in light of a conciliatory speech he made Mon
day in the General Assembly in which there was no
reference to a secular state.
Gilmore regains consciousness

bery.

Exhibit evacuated after bomb threat
Moscow — An American Bicentennial exhibit
drawing big Russian crowds was evacuated yester
day after a telephoned bomb threat that left U.S.
officials angered and suspicious of a trick to dam
pen the show's popularity.
The Soviet codirector, Grigory Kuzmenko, said
he received a phone call at 9:24 p.m. from the In
terior Ministry reporting that an unidentified man
had telephoned a warning that a plastic explosive
would go off at 9:30.
Some 1000 Russian visitors inside the building
were calmly evacuated from the pavilion.
The exhibition, the second U.S. national show to
come to the Soviet Union in 17 years, features film
showings, photos, historical displays and a
souvenir kit containing the U.S. Constitution and
Declaration of Independence in Russian.
A search by American and Russian officials
failed to turn up a bomb.
The U.S. exhibit director, Frank Ursino, angrily
asked Soviet officials why it took more than three
hours for a bomb detection team to arrive to make
certain the pavilion was safe to reopen the exhibit.
The officials apologized profusely, saying they had
difficulty finding an expert in plastic explosives.
Tito wins promise of Soviet respect
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — President Tito won a
renewed promise of Soviet respect for the indepen
dence of Yugoslavia and its Communist party from
Soviet leader Lenoid Brezhnev yesterday. Tito de
scribed as "very successful" his three days of talks
with Brezhnev.
A final communique used new language to spell
out the Yugoslavs' determination to maintain their
independent stand in the Communist world. It said
relations between the Yugoslav and Soviet bloc
parties would be based on "internationalist com
radely voluntary cooperation."
The communique said Tito and Brezhnev want to
see Soviet-Yugoslav relations develop along the
lines of "strict respect for the principles of
sovereignty, independence, equality and noninter
ference in domestic affairs."
