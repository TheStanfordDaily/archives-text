ticipated in grievance and arbitration
proceedings here.
Asked about the difficulties ol
negotiating the contract. Barton said,
"The bargaining unit we were dealing
with was very diverse, with a wide
range of employes. Given that varia

tion of interest, problems always arise.
But I think we did very well."
1 le also said that the contract negoti
ations played no role in his decision to
resign.
"Doug has led us through a difficult
period of transition in employe rela
tions and has done so in a fashion that
reflected the complexity of the institu
tion, finding a balance between
academic flexibility and the needs of
employes," said Robert Augsburger,
vice-president for business and fi
nance.
"I think he's terrific. He's really
done a lot for Stanford," said
Kosenzweig.
Barton, commenting on his own ex

found it a very challenging experience
and a worthwhile one."
