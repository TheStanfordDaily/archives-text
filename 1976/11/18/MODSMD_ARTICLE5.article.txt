# China stages nuclear blast

Washington (AP) â€” China set off the largest nuclear
explosion in its history yesterday, prompting U.S. of
ficials to immediately activate a nation-wide network of
stations to monitor radioactive fallout from the blast.
The explosion occurred at 10 p.m. Tuesday at the Lop
Nor nuclear test site in western China, said a spokesman
for the Energv Research and Development Administration
(ERDA).
The Chinese test was an above-ground blast, a type
which produces the familiar mushroom cloud and sends
radioactive particles into the atmosphere where winds
propel them around the world.
A Chinese nuclear explosion in September resulted in a
sprinkling of low-level radiation in the United States.
The greatest fallout in the United States was in the East
where significant traces of radiation turned up in cows'
milk, particularly in Pennsylvania. But the radio-activity
never reached levels considered hazardous to humans,
officials said.
The Environmental Protection Agency activated its
network of monitoring stations after the blast was detected
by EKDA's sensitive measuring devides. The EPA has HI
measuring stations, in every state except West Virginia

and New Hampshire.
Officials said the a mount ot radioactive fallout expected
to occur may not be greater than in September because the
amount of fallout depends partly on weather conditions at
the time the nuclear cloud passes over the United States.
ERDA said the latest explosion had a force of 4 mega
tons. or 4 million tons of TNT. and was the fourth Chinese
nuclear blast reported this year. EPA said the Septmeber
blast measured 200 kilotons or 20 times smaller than
Wednesday s explosion. A kiloton is equal in explosive
force to 1000 tons of TNT.
The largest American nuclear test publicly announced
was a 15-megaton explosion, ERDA said.
The atomic bombs dropped on Japan during World War
II were rated at 20 kilotons. In a broadcast monitored in
Tokyo, Hsinhua, the official Chinese news agency, said
the test was a "heavy blow to the two superpowers, the
Soviet Union and the United States, which are pursuing
hegemo"ism world domination and attempting to prac
tice nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail."
As usual after such explosions, Hsinhua siad the test
was for defensive purposes only and repeated that China
would never be the first to use atomic weapons.
