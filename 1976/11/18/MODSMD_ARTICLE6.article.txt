# Officials say hospital wing inadequate
## 
### Bill Snyder Staff writer 
University officials are not com
pletely satisfied with architect
claims that the new Stanford hospi
tal wing represents "their money's
worth."
"We feel what we're getting is not
what we thought we'd be getting."
said Cassius Kirk, staff counsel to
vice president for business and fi
nance Robert Augsburger.
Originally, the wing was de
signed as a two floor structure with
25 per cent rough unfinished area
(shell space) which can be equip
ped with support facilities later on.
The basement would be used for in
terim parking. The roof would sup
port the third floor, to be added la
ter.
However, "our ability to expand
the building in the future is not as
easy as we had hoped." said Philip
Williams, director of planning here.
Third floor questionable
Harry Patterson, general counsel
for the Houston-based firm of
Caudill. Rowlett and Scott said
Tuesday. "We contend that Stan
ford substantially has a $12.6 mill
ion building. They've got their
money's worth."
lames McNallv. director of hospi
tal facilities, however, agreed with
Williams. "Current indications are
fh.it it will be difficult to complete a
patient care area in the third floor."

he said.
According to university officials,
(lie space just under (he roof which
is used to accommodate support
systems for the first and second
floors is inadequate for those of a
third floor.
"As soon as you penetrate the
roof you're into interstitial space
and it's pretty well jam packed with
services, primarily ductwork." said
Mob Presley, construction manager
of the project.
"We had considerably more
ducts and bracing in the interstitial
space than was anticipated." said
James Brenner, university senior
planner. "(The architect's) en
gineers didn't pay as much atten
tion as they should have." he said.
Alternatives studied
Paul Kiel, construction adminis
trator for the firm which worked on
the project, had no comment on
Brenner's remarks.
The planning office is now study
ing alternatives for future expan
sion of a third floor, said Willi.ims.
The university is also concerned
about the utilization of shell space
on the first and second floors.
"Some of the area was shell area
roughed out." said Kirk. "Our
understanding was that it would be
easily completed, that it would
have the basic plumbing and elec
trical work already done. We find
'hat this is not the case."

Some hospital staff are concerned
by the 57-foot ramp which connects
the second floor of the wing to the
old building. The ramp, which
connects the operating rooms in the
old building to the recovery room
and intensive care unit in the new
wing, has a three and a half foot
slope and does not have a level sec
tion every 30 feef as required by
state regulation. However, said Wil
liams. it was not cited by state in
spectors for correction.
Some surgeons and anes
thesiologists expressed concern
that elevating the feet or heads of
anesthesized patients, while wheel
ing intensive care unit (ICU) beds,
up and down the ramp could be
dangerous.
McNallv and Myer Rosenthal, di
rector of the ICI J. tested the feasibil
ity of pushing fully loaded hospital
beds on a similar ramp in the base
ment and found that it would re
quire four people to push the 600
pound bed.
They also found that if a bed was
released at the top of the ramp if
could reach a speed of 11 mph as it
rolled down to the end.
Car bumpers are made to with
stand an impact of 5 mph. said Ro
senthal.
Elevator proposed
Because of the dangers and heavy
traffic along the ramp (60 to 70 op
erations are performed at the Medi

cal Center daily), the hospital prop
osed that an elevator lift be installed
next to the ramp to make level
transport of patients possible. This
proposal is now under cost evalua
tion, said Williams.
The ramp was included in the de
sign by the planning office and
medical center officials to save the
cost of additional excavation which
would have been required to make
the floors level, said Brenner. The
floors are uneven because the
length between floors in the new
wing were made wider to accom
modate new equipment, he said.
Malcolm Bagshaw, director of
radiation therapy, is generally
pleased with the layout of the diag
nostic radiology division in the
new wing.
In the old building, "we were re
ally impacted." he said. "We didn't
have enough rooms and what we
did have was inadequate. We hope
we'll be able to improve." he said.
Unfinished rooms
But Bagshaw is disappointed that
the rooms are not finished. "Wecan
only equip half of our eventual total
facility. Part of it has been put in
shell and we won't be able to fully
equip the completed portion.
"Our operation will be quite dis
advantageous because we'll be
running naif in the old and half in
»hn »»tu KxiUin.. " 1,..
Ronald Dorfman, surgical
pathologist, is looking forward to
the move to the new wing. "We've
worked under enormous difficul
ties since I came here in 1968.
We've had to be dispersed through
out the medical center," he said.
The new building will "enable us
to gather together in one central
area," he said. "But a fair amount of
it is shell space. That means that our
technicians will still be on the other
side of the building."
According to hospital data, the
new wing would have 110,000
square feet of space, 25 per cent of it
to be used for support space and
circulation space such as corridors
and lobbies and the remainder to be
used for patient care. A nominal
amount would be shelled.
Brenner said that the shell area
has not changed significantly since
the initial design was made in fall

1972. In fact, "we've finished more
space than we had anticipated," he
said.
On the first floor, open
framework in the original design
has been enclosed and made ready
to receive the transfusion and
coagulation services, he said.
Some of the hospital staff said
they think they should have been
consulted more during the design
of the wing.
"We were not included in the
final architect's plans," said
Dorfman. "We've had to ask for a
fair amount to be redone. This has
been tremendously aggravating."
Eugene Dong, cardiovascular
surgeon, said, "The doctors were
consulted early in the game, and
there was a lot of discussion. (Once
the plans were complete) there was
no longer any consultation between
the administration and faculty, as I
understand it,"he said.

floors are uneven because the
length between floors in the new
wing were made wider to accom
modate new equipment, he said.
Malcolm Bagshaw, director of
radiation therapy, is generally
pleased with the layout of the diag
nostic radiology division in the
new wing.
In the old building, "we were re
ally impacted." he said. "We didn't
have enough rooms and what we
did have was inadequate. We hope
we'll be able to improve." he said.
Unfinished rooms
But Bagshaw is disappointed that
the rooms are not finished. "Wecan
only equip half of our eventual total
facility. Part of it has been put in
shell and we won't be able to fully
equip the completed portion.
"Our operation will be quite dis
advantageous because we'll be
running naif in the old and half in

Ronald Dorfman, surgical
pathologist, is looking forward to
the move to the new wing. "We've
worked under enormous difficul
ties since I came here in 1968.
We've had to be dispersed through
out the medical center," he said.
The new building will "enable us
to gather together in one central
area," he said. "But a fair amount of
it is shell space. That means that our
technicians will still be on the other
side of the building."
According to hospital data, the
new wing would have 110,000
square feet of space, 25 per cent of it
to be used for support space and
circulation space such as corridors
and lobbies and the remainder to be
used for patient care. A nominal
amount would be shelled.
Brenner said that the shell area
has not changed significantly since
the initial design was made in fall

1972. In fact, "we've finished more
space than we had anticipated," he
said.
On the first floor, open
framework in the original design
has been enclosed and made ready
to receive the transfusion and
coagulation services, he said.
Some of the hospital staff said
they think they should have been
consulted more during the design
of the wing.
"We were not included in the
final architect's plans," said
Dorfman. "We've had to ask for a
fair amount to be redone. This has
been tremendously aggravating."
Eugene Dong, cardiovascular
surgeon, said, "The doctors were
consulted early in the game, and
there was a lot of discussion. (Once
the plans were complete) there was
no longer any consultation between
the administration and faculty, as I
understand it,"he said.
University officials are not com
pletely satisfied with architect
claims that the new Stanford hospi
tal wing represents "their money's
worth."
"We feel what we're getting is not
what we thought we'd be getting."
said Cassius Kirk, staff counsel to
vice president for business and fi
nance Robert Augsburger.
Originally, the wing was de
signed as a two floor structure with
25 per cent rough unfinished area
(shell space) which can be equip
ped with support facilities later on.
The basement would be used for in
terim parking. The roof would sup
port the third floor, to be added la
ter.
However, "our ability to expand
the building in the future is not as
easy as we had hoped." said Philip
Williams, director of planning here.
Third floor questionable
Harry Patterson, general counsel
for the Houston-based firm of
Caudill. Rowlett and Scott said
Tuesday. "We contend that Stan
ford substantially has a $12.6 mill
ion building. They've got their
money's worth."
lames McNallv. director of hospi
tal facilities, however, agreed with
Williams. "Current indications are
fh.it it will be difficult to complete a
patient care area in the third floor."

he said.
According to university officials,
(lie space just under (he roof which
is used to accommodate support
systems for the first and second
floors is inadequate for those of a
third floor.
"As soon as you penetrate the
roof you're into interstitial space
and it's pretty well jam packed with
services, primarily ductwork." said
Mob Presley, construction manager
of the project.
"We had considerably more
ducts and bracing in the interstitial
space than was anticipated." said
James Brenner, university senior
planner. "(The architect's) en
gineers didn't pay as much atten
tion as they should have." he said.
Alternatives studied
Paul Kiel, construction adminis
trator for the firm which worked on
the project, had no comment on
Brenner's remarks.
The planning office is now study
ing alternatives for future expan
sion of a third floor, said Willi.ims.
The university is also concerned
about the utilization of shell space
on the first and second floors.
"Some of the area was shell area
roughed out." said Kirk. "Our
understanding was that it would be
easily completed, that it would
have the basic plumbing and elec
trical work already done. We find
'hat this is not the case."

Some hospital staff are concerned
by the 57-foot ramp which connects
the second floor of the wing to the
old building. The ramp, which
connects the operating rooms in the
old building to the recovery room
and intensive care unit in the new
wing, has a three and a half foot
slope and does not have a level sec
tion every 30 feef as required by
state regulation. However, said Wil
liams. it was not cited by state in
spectors for correction.
Some surgeons and anes
thesiologists expressed concern
that elevating the feet or heads of
anesthesized patients, while wheel
ing intensive care unit (ICU) beds,
up and down the ramp could be
dangerous.
McNallv and Myer Rosenthal, di
rector of the ICI J. tested the feasibil
ity of pushing fully loaded hospital
beds on a similar ramp in the base
ment and found that it would re
quire four people to push the 600
pound bed.
They also found that if a bed was
released at the top of the ramp if
could reach a speed of 11 mph as it
rolled down to the end.
Car bumpers are made to with
stand an impact of 5 mph. said Ro
senthal.
Elevator proposed
Because of the dangers and heavy
traffic along the ramp (60 to 70 op
erations are performed at the Medi

cal Center daily), the hospital prop
osed that an elevator lift be installed
next to the ramp to make level
transport of patients possible. This
proposal is now under cost evalua
tion, said Williams.
The ramp was included in the de
sign by the planning office and
medical center officials to save the
cost of additional excavation which
would have been required to make
the floors level, said Brenner. The
floors are uneven because the
length between floors in the new
wing were made wider to accom

"We had considerably more
ducts and bracing in the interstitial
space than was anticipated." said
James Brenner, university senior
planner. "(The architect's) en
gineers didn't pay as much atten
tion as they should have." he said.
Alternatives studied
Paul Kiel, construction adminis
trator for the firm which worked on
the project, had no comment on
Brenner's remarks.
The planning office is now study
ing alternatives for future expan
sion of a third floor, said Willi.ims.
The university is also concerned
about the utilization of shell space
on the first and second floors.
"Some of the area was shell area
roughed out." said Kirk. "Our
understanding was that it would be
easily completed, that it would
have the basic plumbing and elec
trical work already done. We find
'hat this is not the case."

Some hospital staff are concerned
by the 57-foot ramp which connects
the second floor of the wing to the
old building. The ramp, which
connects the operating rooms in the
old building to the recovery room
and intensive care unit in the new
wing, has a three and a half foot
slope and does not have a level sec
tion every 30 feef as required by
state regulation. However, said Wil
liams. it was not cited by state in
spectors for correction.
Some surgeons and anes
thesiologists expressed concern
that elevating the feet or heads of
anesthesized patients, while wheel
ing intensive care unit (ICU) beds,
up and down the ramp could be
dangerous.
McNallv and Myer Rosenthal, di
rector of the ICI J. tested the feasibil
ity of pushing fully loaded hospital
beds on a similar ramp in the base
ment and found that it would re
quire four people to push the 600
pound bed.
They also found that if a bed was
released at the top of the ramp if
could reach a speed of 11 mph as it
rolled down to the end.
Car bumpers are made to with
stand an impact of 5 mph. said Ro
senthal.
Elevator proposed
Because of the dangers and heavy
traffic along the ramp (60 to 70 op
erations are performed at the Medi

cal Center daily), the hospital prop
osed that an elevator lift be installed
next to the ramp to make level
transport of patients possible. This
proposal is now under cost evalua
tion, said Williams.
The ramp was included in the de
sign by the planning office and
medical center officials to save the
cost of additional excavation which
would have been required to make
the floors level, said Brenner. The
floors are uneven because the
length between floors in the new
wing were made wider to accom
modate new equipment, he said.
Malcolm Bagshaw, director of
radiation therapy, is generally
pleased with the layout of the diag
nostic radiology division in the
new wing.
In the old building, "we were re
ally impacted." he said. "We didn't
have enough rooms and what we
did have was inadequate. We hope
we'll be able to improve." he said.
Unfinished rooms
But Bagshaw is disappointed that
the rooms are not finished. "Wecan
only equip half of our eventual total
facility. Part of it has been put in
shell and we won't be able to fully
equip the completed portion.
"Our operation will be quite dis
advantageous because we'll be
running naif in the old and half in
»hn »»tu KxiUin.. " 1,..
Ronald Dorfman, surgical
pathologist, is looking forward to
the move to the new wing. "We've
worked under enormous difficul
ties since I came here in 1968.
We've had to be dispersed through
out the medical center," he said.
The new building will "enable us
to gather together in one central
area," he said. "But a fair amount of
it is shell space. That means that our
technicians will still be on the other
side of the building."
According to hospital data, the
new wing would have 110,000
square feet of space, 25 per cent of it
to be used for support space and
circulation space such as corridors
and lobbies and the remainder to be
used for patient care. A nominal
amount would be shelled.
Brenner said that the shell area
has not changed significantly since
the initial design was made in fall

1972. In fact, "we've finished more
space than we had anticipated," he
said.
On the first floor, open
framework in the original design
has been enclosed and made ready
to receive the transfusion and
coagulation services, he said.
Some of the hospital staff said
they think they should have been
consulted more during the design
of the wing.
"We were not included in the
final architect's plans," said
Dorfman. "We've had to ask for a
fair amount to be redone. This has
been tremendously aggravating."
Eugene Dong, cardiovascular
surgeon, said, "The doctors were
consulted early in the game, and
there was a lot of discussion. (Once
the plans were complete) there was
no longer any consultation between
the administration and faculty, as I
understand it,"he said.
University officials are not com
pletely satisfied with architect
claims that the new Stanford hospi
tal wing represents "their money's
worth."
"We feel what we're getting is not
what we thought we'd be getting."
said Cassius Kirk, staff counsel to
vice president for business and fi
nance Robert Augsburger.
Originally, the wing was de
signed as a two floor structure with
25 per cent rough unfinished area
(shell space) which can be equip
ped with support facilities later on.
The basement would be used for in
terim parking. The roof would sup
port the third floor, to be added la
ter.
However, "our ability to expand
the building in the future is not as
easy as we had hoped." said Philip
Williams, director of planning here.
Third floor questionable
Harry Patterson, general counsel
for the Houston-based firm of
Caudill. Rowlett and Scott said
Tuesday. "We contend that Stan
ford substantially has a $12.6 mill
ion building. They've got their
money's worth."
lames McNallv. director of hospi
tal facilities, however, agreed with
Williams. "Current indications are
fh.it it will be difficult to complete a
patient care area in the third floor."

he said.
According to university officials,
(lie space just under (he roof which
is used to accommodate support
systems for the first and second
floors is inadequate for those of a
third floor.
"As soon as you penetrate the
roof you're into interstitial space
and it's pretty well jam packed with
services, primarily ductwork." said
Mob Presley, construction manager
of the project.

Brenner said that the shell area
has not changed significantly since
the initial design was made in fall

1972. In fact, "we've finished more
space than we had anticipated," he
said.
On the first floor, open
framework in the original design
has been enclosed and made ready
to receive the transfusion and
coagulation services, he said.
Some of the hospital staff said
they think they should have been
consulted more during the design
of the wing.
"We were not included in the
final architect's plans," said
Dorfman. "We've had to ask for a
fair amount to be redone. This has
been tremendously aggravating."
Eugene Dong, cardiovascular
surgeon, said, "The doctors were
consulted early in the game, and
there was a lot of discussion. (Once
the plans were complete) there was
no longer any consultation between
the administration and faculty, as I
understand it,"he said.
