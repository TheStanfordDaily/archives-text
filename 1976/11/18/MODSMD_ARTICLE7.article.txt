# International Hotel dispute may end in tenant eviction
## 
### 
Honig, et al.

The International Hotel stands on
the dividing line between Chinatown
and San Francisco's financial district.
Flanking it on one side is the imposing
Transamerica Pyramid and on the
other, the swank Holiday Inn. With the
rapid expansion of the Financial Dis
trict, it is no surprise that this run
down building should be the apple in
the eye of many a developer.
From the point of view of the de
velopers, tearing down the hotel and
constructing a concrete parking lot in
its place would render the land im
mensely more profitable. In 1968, the
Milton Meyer Co., headed by Walter
Shorenstein (Jimmy Carter's and
Humbert Humphrey's financial be
nefactor in Northern Cal) bought the
hotel. Before long, Shorenstein began
to use the power of the law to evict the
tenants, thinking that kicking out the
elderly Chinese and Filipino tenants
would be easy. He was unduly sur
prised.
Mostly retired farmworkers, seamen
and restaurant workers, the residents
of the International Hotel, like other
immigrants, had come to this country
in their youth to seek a better life. All
their lives they labored for the
meagerest of wages. Now in their old
age and unable to work anymore, they
can only afford the $50-$ BO a month
rooms in the decaying hotels near their
ethnic communities.
Confronted with the acute low-cost
housing shortage, these tenants had to
accept the hotel as their permanent
home. They simply could not afford to
go anywhere else. Forced by necessity,
they united against eviction assaults.
Assaults
The assaults were not long in com
ing. Successive notices were served in
1968, 1969 and 1972, hut the tenants
refused to move. The conflict was esca
lated by the occurrence of a fire in
which three tenants were burned to
death. The tenants were infuriated.
They put up money and efforts to re
novate the hotel, lest the fire depart
ment would condemn it on grounds of
fire hazards and kick them out.
As the tenants began to demonstrate
that they were not at the mercy of the
landlord, their struggle became a rally
ing call to concerned people around
the Bay Area. Their fight augmented
by threatening publicity for
Shorenstein and his political cohort,
Humphrey. So, by 1973, Milton Meyer
was forced to give up International
Hotel to the Four Seas Development
Corporation.
Soon after the transaction. Four Seas
initiated its own eviction attempts.

Claiming that a city rule required it to
repair the hotel, Four Seas issued its
first eviction notice in September,
1974. But the tenants refused to move,
arguing that they had refurbished,
maintained and managed the hotel
with their own labor and money since
1968.
Candidate for mayor George Mos
cone was also informed of the ongoing
struggle, and in a personal letter to the
International Hotel Tenants Associa
tion (IHTA), he assuringly pledged his
support. The eviction attempts were
continuously renewed, but to noavail.
Hung jury
Four Seas finally brought the issue
to court in the spring of this year. The
jury was deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of
the tenants' case to remain in hotel.
According to law however, a three
fourths majority was required to pass an
irrevocable decision, but the jury was
unable to reach a decision despite bal
loting 20 times at Judge Ira Brown's
insistence. Brown, declaring a "hung
jury," then proceeded to award the
hotel to Four Seas himself. Now, under
the law, the tenants had to be evicted
without any compensation from the
landlord.
Undaunted, the organized tenants
began to publish newsletters and leaf
lets publicizing their situation. Peti
tions demanding the eviction order be
withdrawn were circulated. Within
three weeks, over 4600 signatures
were collected. Monthly rallies and
weekly marches forced even the media
to relate news of this struggle to the
general public.
Constant vigilance was kept in the
hotel in anticipation ofaneviction that
would come in the middle of the night,
when tenants were least prepared and
support could not be quickly mustered,
and when the media were not on hand
to record the dragging of old men into
the streets.
Moscone's support
Meanwhile, the pledged support of
Moscone, now mayor, turned into
equivocations and bureaucratic
studies of the financial feasibility for
the city to buy the building under emi
nent domain.
The decision of the city government
was predictable. In early July, the
Housing Authority flatly rejected the
entire proposal. The next month the
State Supreme Court rejected IHTA's
motion to appeal Brown's decision.
The eviction order was now con
firmed.
However, throughout the summer,
support for the International Hotel in
creased dramatically. Hundreds ofde

termined supporters, together with
the 60 to 90-year-old tenants, marched
and demonstrated in front of City Hall,
the Sheriff's department and Four
Seas. By now, over 10,000 signed the
anti-eviction petition. Approximately
24 unions, community organizations
and senior citizen groups sent letters
to Moscone and Sheriff Hongisto pro
testing the eviction order.
More money needed
A few weeks ago, the Housing Au
thority suddenly changed its verdict
and said it would review the case. No
sooner had it agreed to buy than the
Board of Supervisors vetoed the plan.
The rationale: more money is needed
for police cars in areas with high un
employment and run-down housing.
As it stands the eviction date is Nov.
27, All the proposals and counter
proposals in the city government ap
pear more and more as time-delaying
maneuvers in light of the fact that the
police force is beefing up for the
showdown. The International Hotel
tenants resisted eviction for eight
years and they will not be stopped
now. Their slogan is loud and clear:
We demand low-cost housing. No
eviction! We won't move.
The situation is urgent and it is im
portant that public sentiments toward
the International Hotel be known.
Write letters to Mayor Moscone at City
Hall and Hongisto at the S.F. Police
Department and demand that the evic
tion order be withdrawn. Support the
International Hotel Struggle.
