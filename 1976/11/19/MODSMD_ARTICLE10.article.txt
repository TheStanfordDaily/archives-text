# Cardinal center hangs loose
## LaGrandeur adds excitement to his life 
### Teresa Blasberg 
We're <i 11 familiar with the
prevalent stereotype of the
athlete: the jock that lives tor
football and declares his major
field of study as "pre-life." Stan
ford's John LaGrandeur. at least,
doesn't fit the mold. His rather
unusual hobbies, for example,
prove there's more to John than
football.
Hang gliding has to be one of
the most dangerous hobbies
around, but tor LaGrandeur.
that's what makes it exciting.
"Fear's a big part of it. but no
thing's really fun unless there's
some fea r involved." The first
time John tried hang gliding he
jumped up instead of waiting tor
the wind to lift him and wound
up sliding a hundred feet down a
hill. The way )ohn sees it. "You
just have to get hack up and try it
again."
Hang gliding does have its
drawbacks. Aside from needing
a bigger kite because of his size,
the coaches were a bit uneasy at
first about LaGrandeur's in
volvement in such a dangerous
sport |ohn himself has limited
such outside activities lately in
order to be sure he can plav foot
ball.
Like many Stanford students.
LaGrandeur has taken up
skateboarding, an activity he en
joyed as a child. While he likes to
back-pack and is learning to ski.
for John "nothing compares to

flying through the air with the
wind in your face."
When you're as active as John
you do have to make some
choices. While he was originally
interested in biology, he telt that
football didn't leave him enough
time to do as well as he would
like. His interest in football has
placed some limitations on his
academic performance, but LaG
randeur feels that it has contri
buted to it as well. The discip
line. patience and confidence
he's developed from the game
are valuable academic qualities.
John was an All-GIF center in
high school but has had to make
the transition from high school
star to one of the crowd. He en
joyed competing against other
schools on the |Y team last year,
so being red-shirted this year is
somewhat frustrating.
What makes going to practice
and keeping in shape worth
while is the chance of playing
varsity next year. Meanwhile,
keeping up with practice is giv
ing him a chance to overcome
some of his inexperience and
will help John reach one of his
goals: to do a good job for his
team. LaGrandeur wouldn't
mind becoming a star through a
brilliant interception or by re
covering a fumble, but what mat
ters more to him is to be on a
winning (as in Rose Bowl) team.
Who can argue with an attitude
like that?

Sophomore John LaGrandeur: hang glider, skier, frisbee freak, skateboard demon and oh, yes,
football player. Last year as a JV. LaGrandeur missed the final game against Cal because he
broke his wrist while skate boarding. This season he's playing it safe by redshirting.

LaGrandeur has taken up
skateboarding, an activity he en
joyed as a child. While he likes to
back-pack and is learning to ski.
for John "nothing compares to

flying through the air with the
wind in your face."
When you're as active as John
you do have to make some
choices. While he was originally
interested in biology, he telt that
football didn't leave him enough
time to do as well as he would
like. His interest in football has
placed some limitations on his
academic performance, but LaG
randeur feels that it has contri
buted to it as well. The discip
line. patience and confidence
he's developed from the game
are valuable academic qualities.
John was an All-GIF center in
high school but has had to make
the transition from high school
star to one of the crowd. He en
joyed competing against other
schools on the |Y team last year,
so being red-shirted this year is
somewhat frustrating.
What makes going to practice
and keeping in shape worth
while is the chance of playing
varsity next year. Meanwhile,
keeping up with practice is giv
ing him a chance to overcome
some of his inexperience and
will help John reach one of his
goals: to do a good job for his
team. LaGrandeur wouldn't
mind becoming a star through a
brilliant interception or by re
covering a fumble, but what mat
ters more to him is to be on a
winning (as in Rose Bowl) team.
Who can argue with an attitude
like that?

broke his wrist while skate boarding. This season he's playing it safe by redshirting.
