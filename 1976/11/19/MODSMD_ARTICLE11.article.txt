# Defensive tackle adjusts to new role
## Sophomore starter gains confidence, experience 
### David Georgette 
It's tough to start as a defen
sive lineman in your first year on
varsity. A few players have done
it, granted, but how many have
done so after being switched
from another position?
Stanford's defensive tackle
Jack Moller has made the change
from linebacker, and he has done
so with a great deal of success.
He has 51 tackles this season,
tops among Stanford's tackles.
The 6-foot-4, 228 pounder
shook off the notoriety of being a
sophomore starter at a new posi
tion. "It gave me a chance to
play," he said. "I've always
wanted to play linebacker but
being able to play, you can't
knock that."
During his freshman season,
Moller performed at linebacker
for the Stanford JV team and saw
some action with the varsity. "I
thought I did pretty well." said
Moller of his JV effort. "I thought
it was a lot like high school."
If playing JVs was reminiscent
of high school, it must have been
a good start for the blond, soft
spoken Moller. A prep All -
American from Northbrook. he

played tight end and linebacker
on his Glenbrook North High
School team which won the Il
linois state football title in 1974.
Moller was sought after by
Notre Dame and Michigan but
chose Stanford "because I
thought it was the only school
that could offer a top education
and a top schedule." In coming
to Stanford. Moller said "I
thought I'd be a linebacker. "
During spring ball this year,
though, he was moved to the de
fensive line. "It was a combina
tion of things," stated Moller.
"We had an abundance of
linebackers this spring, a lot of
linemen were hurt and we were
thin in the line in the spring."
There was one other reason,
Moller said, that his position
was changed. "It was sort of im
plied that I couldn't cover the
pass."
Gunther Cunningham, Stan
ford's defensive line coach, said,
"Jack's just a real good athlete.
He's a real hitter and a very intel
ligent player. He doesn't have
the straightaway speed, though,
to play linebacker."
With the change in position,

there came a change in defensive
technique. Moller said he "had
to learn to fight through blocks
and not to fight around them;
outstrength 'em instead of out
quicking 'em
Besides adjusting well to his
new role on the field. Moller is
changing some of his attitudes
off the field. He is a fun-loving
Zete. even though "I haven't
been around that much" this
quarter, and a member of the
Wasted Parrots intramural bas
ketball team during the winter.
"I enjoy going to Stanford."
said Moller. And most anyone
would enjoy seeing Jack on a
night when he is around empty
aluminum beer cans. He
smashes them against his
forehead.
However, a reason Moller is
enjoying Stanford is because
"school is becoming more and
more important to me the older 1
get."
And the more he plays, the
better he gets. Moller said the
Oregon State game was his best
performance of the year. "It was
the defensive line's best game as
a whole," said Moller.
In the future, "There's a chance
Jack could go back to
linebacker," Cunningham said.
But Moller said. "1 can't see it."
Pacific-8 offenses probably
hope Moller returns to
linebacker; he already has done
too much damage at defensive
tackle.
