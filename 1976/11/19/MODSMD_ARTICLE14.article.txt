# Chuck Evans: a mean machine
## Card defensive end a real animal 
### Jill Lieber 
Chuck Evans eats raw meat.
Well, at least that's the impre
ssion one gets when first meet
ing the sophomore defensive
end from Covina. All the stories
about his quick temper, ram
bunctiousness and crude voc
abulary come to mind and create
the image of a real animal.
Evans is caught up in the
rough, tough, bruiser image he
displays on the field. Evans,
himself, plays up his meanness.
It's a scare tactic. Over the next
three years at Stanford he'd like
nothing better than to have op
posing offensive tackles shake in
their shoes when lining up
against him.
It's a wonder more Stanford
students haven't shied from the
6-foot-3V2, 220-pound Evans.
Last year as a freshman he was
quite a terror in his dorm where
in his playfulness he ripped a
door off its hinges.
"He's the meanest dude I've
ever seen," said defensive coach
Cunther Cunningham earlier
this year. "He .seems to always be
getting into fights in practice. If
there is a fight on the field, you
can bet Chuck is in it."
"He's a very intense indi
vidual," said Duncan McColl.
"When he makes a mistake he
comes back and tries that much
harder . . . maybe too hard. 1 be
lieve it's just a means of motiva
tion. He's really not that mean —
he just wants to do the job right."

Evans was ejected from this
year's UCLA game in the Col
iseum. In his anger he kneed a
Bruin after he was down.
"Sometimes it's not good to
get mad when you're playing."
Evans said. "You can get so mad
that you don't concentrate and
then you miss your assignments.
But then again, you can't have a
mellow attitude to play de
fense."
Evans has a more "mellow at
titude" toward life off the field.
He is an outdoors person and the
walls of his room are decorated
with nature scenes. He enjoys
the challenge of skiing: "It's just

you against the mountain.
"People shy away from me.
Some guys are intimidated.
They look at me and say, 'Boy,
he's going to kill me.' Of course,
most students think that football
players are given a lot of breaks.
.Most of the people at Stanford
aren't into sports, they're into
studying."
Evans believes in moderation
when it comes to studying and
sports. He is an economics major
and plans to finish the require
ments for his major soon so he
can take computer science
courses.

"School is extremely impor
tant to me. Even if I play pro
ball there's going to be a time
where I can't play anymore. In
high school you can get away
with a lot. You don't have to
study. But here you've got to get
the grades. A degree from Stan
ford is great, but not if you've got
a whole transcript with C's on
it*."
Last season — his freshman
year — Evans redshirted follow
ing a knee operation after the
third day of practice. He started
the Army, UCLA and
Washington games this season

and now splits the playing time
with junior Bruce Barker.
"I though that maybe I'd enjoy
sitting out a year. But I was really
bugged by it. I sat on the
sidelines in my cast and got a
weird feeling in my stomach
when the band started playing
and the team ran on the field. I
wanted to play so much."
Football has been a large part
of Evans' life since he was eight
years old. His brother, a senior in
high school, plans to play bas
ketball at a major college. Evans'
parents are more avid sports fans
than participants. His father is
6-foot-7 and played football
when he was in school. His
mother is also tall, 5-foot-10V'2,
and spends a lot of time cooking
for the hungry crew.
"My brother and I eat enough
food for 1G people. There's al
ways been a lot of food around
our house."
Evans played high school
football at 195 pounds. Since his
senior year he has gained 30
pounds and is working to in
crease his size to between 240
and 250 pounds. He plans to lift
weights, eat well-balanced
meals and work out during the
off-season.
"You can't just be an instinc
tive football player. Strength
won't get you very far. And
you've got to want to win. We've
played against three of the top
10 teams in the country this year
— Michigan. USC and UCLA.
Army has the smallest offensive
line we came up against, but
those guys did a better job than
some of the big fat guys at the
other schools. Those .Army guys
just tried harder. They never
gave up."

gave up."

Card defensive end Chuck Evans (89) and teammate Duncan McColl (77) sandwich a
Washington player for a tackle earlier this year. On the season, Evans has 46 tackles and is the
No. 2 Card pass deflector.
Chuck Evans eats raw meat.
Well, at least that's the impre
ssion one gets when first meet
ing the sophomore defensive
end from Covina. All the stories
about his quick temper, ram
bunctiousness and crude voc
abulary come to mind and create
the image of a real animal.
Evans is caught up in the
rough, tough, bruiser image he
displays on the field. Evans,
himself, plays up his meanness.
It's a scare tactic. Over the next
three years at Stanford he'd like
nothing better than to have op
posing offensive tackles shake in
their shoes when lining up
against him.
It's a wonder more Stanford
students haven't shied from the
6-foot-3V2, 220-pound Evans.
Last year as a freshman he was
quite a terror in his dorm where
in his playfulness he ripped a
door off its hinges.
"He's the meanest dude I've
ever seen," said defensive coach
Cunther Cunningham earlier
this year. "He .seems to always be
getting into fights in practice. If
there is a fight on the field, you
can bet Chuck is in it."
"He's a very intense indi
vidual," said Duncan McColl.
"When he makes a mistake he
comes back and tries that much
harder . . . maybe too hard. 1 be
lieve it's just a means of motiva
tion. He's really not that mean —
he just wants to do the job right."

Evans was ejected from this
year's UCLA game in the Col
iseum. In his anger he kneed a
Bruin after he was down.
"Sometimes it's not good to
get mad when you're playing."
Evans said. "You can get so mad
that you don't concentrate and
then you miss your assignments.
But then again, you can't have a
mellow attitude to play de
fense."
Evans has a more "mellow at
titude" toward life off the field.
He is an outdoors person and the
walls of his room are decorated
with nature scenes. He enjoys
the challenge of skiing: "It's just

you against the mountain.
"People shy away from me.
Some guys are intimidated.
They look at me and say, 'Boy,
he's going to kill me.' Of course,
most students think that football
players are given a lot of breaks.
.Most of the people at Stanford
aren't into sports, they're into
studying."
Evans believes in moderation
when it comes to studying and
sports. He is an economics major
and plans to finish the require
ments for his major soon so he
can take computer science
courses.

"School is extremely impor
tant to me. Even if I play pro
ball there's going to be a time
where I can't play anymore. In
high school you can get away
with a lot. You don't have to
study. But here you've got to get
the grades. A degree from Stan
ford is great, but not if you've got
a whole transcript with C's on
it*."
Last season — his freshman
year — Evans redshirted follow
ing a knee operation after the
third day of practice. He started
the Army, UCLA and
Washington games this season

and now splits the playing time
with junior Bruce Barker.
"I though that maybe I'd enjoy
sitting out a year. But I was really
bugged by it. I sat on the
sidelines in my cast and got a
weird feeling in my stomach
when the band started playing
and the team ran on the field. I
wanted to play so much."
Football has been a large part
of Evans' life since he was eight
years old. His brother, a senior in
high school, plans to play bas
ketball at a major college. Evans'
parents are more avid sports fans
than participants. His father is
6-foot-7 and played football
when he was in school. His
mother is also tall, 5-foot-10V'2,
and spends a lot of time cooking
for the hungry crew.
"My brother and I eat enough
food for 1G people. There's al
ways been a lot of food around
our house."
Evans played high school
football at 195 pounds. Since his
senior year he has gained 30
pounds and is working to in
crease his size to between 240
and 250 pounds. He plans to lift
weights, eat well-balanced
meals and work out during the
off-season.
"You can't just be an instinc
tive football player. Strength
won't get you very far. And
you've got to want to win. We've
played against three of the top
10 teams in the country this year
— Michigan. USC and UCLA.
Army has the smallest offensive
line we came up against, but
those guys did a better job than
some of the big fat guys at the
other schools. Those .Army guys
just tried harder. They never
gave up."

"You can't just be an instinc
tive football player. Strength
won't get you very far. And
you've got to want to win. We've
played against three of the top
10 teams in the country this year
— Michigan. USC and UCLA.
Army has the smallest offensive
line we came up against, but
those guys did a better job than
some of the big fat guys at the
other schools. Those .Army guys
just tried harder. They never
gave up."

Card defensive end Chuck Evans (89) and teammate Duncan McColl (77) sandwich a
Washington player for a tackle earlier this year. On the season, Evans has 46 tackles and is the
No. 2 Card pass deflector.
Chuck Evans eats raw meat.
Well, at least that's the impre
ssion one gets when first meet
ing the sophomore defensive
end from Covina. All the stories
about his quick temper, ram
bunctiousness and crude voc
abulary come to mind and create
the image of a real animal.
Evans is caught up in the
rough, tough, bruiser image he
displays on the field. Evans,
himself, plays up his meanness.
It's a scare tactic. Over the next
three years at Stanford he'd like
nothing better than to have op
posing offensive tackles shake in
their shoes when lining up
against him.
It's a wonder more Stanford
students haven't shied from the
6-foot-3V2, 220-pound Evans.
Last year as a freshman he was
quite a terror in his dorm where
in his playfulness he ripped a
door off its hinges.
"He's the meanest dude I've
ever seen," said defensive coach
Cunther Cunningham earlier
this year. "He .seems to always be
getting into fights in practice. If
there is a fight on the field, you
can bet Chuck is in it."
"He's a very intense indi
vidual," said Duncan McColl.
"When he makes a mistake he
comes back and tries that much
harder . . . maybe too hard. 1 be
lieve it's just a means of motiva
tion. He's really not that mean —
he just wants to do the job right."

Evans was ejected from this
year's UCLA game in the Col
iseum. In his anger he kneed a
Bruin after he was down.
"Sometimes it's not good to
get mad when you're playing."
Evans said. "You can get so mad
that you don't concentrate and
then you miss your assignments.
But then again, you can't have a
mellow attitude to play de
fense."
Evans has a more "mellow at
titude" toward life off the field.
He is an outdoors person and the
walls of his room are decorated
with nature scenes. He enjoys
the challenge of skiing: "It's just

you against the mountain.
"People shy away from me.
Some guys are intimidated.
They look at me and say, 'Boy,
he's going to kill me.' Of course,
most students think that football
players are given a lot of breaks.
.Most of the people at Stanford
aren't into sports, they're into
studying."
Evans believes in moderation
when it comes to studying and
sports. He is an economics major
and plans to finish the require
ments for his major soon so he
can take computer science
courses.

"School is extremely impor
tant to me. Even if I play pro
ball there's going to be a time
where I can't play anymore. In
high school you can get away
with a lot. You don't have to
study. But here you've got to get
the grades. A degree from Stan
ford is great, but not if you've got
a whole transcript with C's on
it*."
Last season — his freshman
year — Evans redshirted follow
ing a knee operation after the
third day of practice. He started
the Army, UCLA and
Washington games this season

and now splits the playing time
with junior Bruce Barker.
"I though that maybe I'd enjoy
sitting out a year. But I was really
bugged by it. I sat on the
sidelines in my cast and got a
weird feeling in my stomach
when the band started playing
and the team ran on the field. I
wanted to play so much."
Football has been a large part
of Evans' life since he was eight
years old. His brother, a senior in
high school, plans to play bas
ketball at a major college. Evans'
parents are more avid sports fans
than participants. His father is
6-foot-7 and played football
when he was in school. His
mother is also tall, 5-foot-10V'2,
and spends a lot of time cooking
for the hungry crew.
"My brother and I eat enough
food for 1G people. There's al
ways been a lot of food around
our house."
Evans played high school
football at 195 pounds. Since his
senior year he has gained 30
pounds and is working to in
crease his size to between 240
and 250 pounds. He plans to lift
weights, eat well-balanced
meals and work out during the
off-season.
