# Battle of the bands
## Incomparables vie with Cal weenies 
### 
Glenn Dickey recently noted,
in the public prints, that the
Stanford Band's celebration of
the death of Chairman Mao set a
new tag-team ohnoxiousness re
cord by insulting 800 million
people simultaneously.
Today's Stanford half-time
performance will attempt to sur
pass that dubious achievement
as it belittles politics, sex. drugs
and religious charlatans. Throw
ing caution to the winds, fling
ing the gauntlet to its letter
writing critics, keeping an eye

on exits from the stadium, the
Band takes advantage of the
liberating, herb-scented atmos
phere of Berkeley with today's
Salute to Mass Delusion.
The first formation notes the
delusions of politics — the
apotheosis of the peanut farmer
— with the music "King of the
World."
In the following maneuver,
the Bandspeople nod to the drug
culture by spelling POP A PILL
for the song "Crazy on You."
The next spellout speculates

that, when women's liberation
and the sexual revolution collide
(or conjoin), the result may he
MOREMOMS instead of more
freedom.
The sounds — "Rockin' Me."
Finally the Band observes
America's most recent delusive
movement, the well-scrubbed
legions of the mysterious Rev.
Sun Moon. The Band depicts a
sun and moon while playing
"Brainwashed."
Thank you and good night.
