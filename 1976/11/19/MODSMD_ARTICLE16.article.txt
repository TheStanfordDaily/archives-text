## Great expectations 
### Bruce Anderson 
l.ittle more th.in years ago.
the Stanford Athletic: Depart
ment announced that Parade
magazine's tirst-team prep All-
American quarterback had
signed his letter of intent to .it
tend Stanford.
The Daily greeted the an
nouncement by declaring: "John
Kalston came up with a replace
ment for Heisman Trophy win
ner Jim Plunkett: lack Christian
sen found someone to take over
for Plunkett's successor Don
Bunce. and it looks like Christ
iansen is a year ahead of himself
finding a quarterback to replace
Mike Bury la."
Mike Cordova of Seattle Prep
arrived on the Farm amidst great
hoopla and with tremendous
promise. Intentionally, the
B-foot-4 quarterback was as
signed lim Plunkett's number.

and because of this the
coaching staff must forever share
the responsibility of raising the
expectations of Stanford parti
sans too high.
It is no secret that Cordova
never escaped the shadow of the
other No. lb. a shadow he never
wanted in the first place.
Occasionally, Cordova did
display the greatness most fans
had expected from him all along.
As a freshman he led the Stan
ford JVs to a 41-10 victory over
USC by completing 21 of 38 pas
ses for 292 yards and five
touchdowns.
The next day the varsity lost to
the Trojans. 27-26. Ironically.
Christiansen recalled a year later
that "alumni were coming up to
me after the game and asking me
why I hadn't started Cordova in
the varsity game instead of play
ing him |Y."

Last year, Cordova sparkled
when directing the upstart Car
dinals to a 19-19 upset tie with
No. 3-ranked Michigan. He
completed 24 of 44 aerials
against the Wolverines, threw
for 290 yards and two
touchdowns and was named na
tional offensive player of the
week by Sports Illustrated.
But most of his performances
were not that exemplary and by
mid-season of last year the "boo
birds" began to express their
displeasure quite vociferously.
One assumes that the boos were
directed not at Cordova, but at
Christiansen, and that the boos
were intended only to express
disapproval with the coach's
choice of signal callers. The road
to hell is paved with such inten
tions.
Stanford fans, however, being
the great competitors they are.

saved their best performance tor
a televised game: this season's
home opener with San Jose
State. ABC-TV asked Christian
sen to select 12 plavers for the
network to introduce before the
game. The Stanford mentor
chose to have 12 seniors intro
duced.
When Cordova's name was
announced during these pre
game introductions, it was met
with hostile booing from the
Stanford rooting section. Appa
rently. fans believed the intro
duction indicated Christiansen's
choice of starting signal caller.
Such infantile actions are sur
prising from students and
alumni who pride themselves on
a campus that is both intellectual
and relaxed. But similar out
bursts have occured during the
past two seasons and Stanford
fans have shown little that re

sembles class.
Surprisingly, however, fans
did greet Cordova's entrance
into the lISC game two weeks
ago with reserved applause. I
hope that an appearance today
by Cordova might be met with
less restrained applause.
Coach Christiansen, who may
also be appearing in his last
game for Stanford, said on Tues
day that "there's a possibility we
may start all our seniors, and if
we do then Mike would probably
start at quarterback."
It would be an ironic conclu
sion to a turbulent collegiate
career if Cordova started, led the
Cards to a Big Came victory,
saved Christiansen from the
alumni lions and perhaps left the
field, for once, to the thundering
ovation of the Cardinal rooting
section.

coaching staff must forever share
the responsibility of raising the
expectations of Stanford parti
sans too high.
It is no secret that Cordova
never escaped the shadow of the
other No. lb. a shadow he never
wanted in the first place.
Occasionally, Cordova did
display the greatness most fans
had expected from him all along.
As a freshman he led the Stan
ford JVs to a 41-10 victory over
USC by completing 21 of 38 pas
ses for 292 yards and five
touchdowns.
The next day the varsity lost to
the Trojans. 27-26. Ironically.
Christiansen recalled a year later
that "alumni were coming up to
me after the game and asking me
why I hadn't started Cordova in
the varsity game instead of play
ing him |Y."

Last year, Cordova sparkled
when directing the upstart Car
dinals to a 19-19 upset tie with
No. 3-ranked Michigan. He
completed 24 of 44 aerials
against the Wolverines, threw
for 290 yards and two
touchdowns and was named na
tional offensive player of the
week by Sports Illustrated.
But most of his performances
were not that exemplary and by
mid-season of last year the "boo
birds" began to express their
displeasure quite vociferously.
One assumes that the boos were
directed not at Cordova, but at
Christiansen, and that the boos
were intended only to express
disapproval with the coach's
choice of signal callers. The road
to hell is paved with such inten

When Cordova's name was
announced during these pre

with hostile booing from the
Stanford rooting section. Appa
rently. fans believed the intro

Such infantile actions are sur
prising from students and
alumni who pride themselves on
a campus that is both intellectual
and relaxed. But similar out
bursts have occured during the
past two seasons and Stanford
fans have shown little that re

sembles class.
Surprisingly, however, fans
did greet Cordova's entrance
into the lISC game two weeks
ago with reserved applause. I
hope that an appearance today
by Cordova might be met with
less restrained applause.
Coach Christiansen, who may
also be appearing in his last

may start all our seniors, and if
we do then Mike would probably
start at quarterback."
It would be an ironic conclu
