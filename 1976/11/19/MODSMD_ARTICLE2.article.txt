# Big Game rivalry renewed today
## Cal, Cards look for winning season 
### Chris Baker 
About 12 weeks ago <i group of
sports writers who visited all
the Pat ific-8 schools picked
California to finish second and
Stanford for third in the confer
ence. Howl invitations were ex
pec ted to flow in to the two
Northern California schools.
Six weeks ago. when both
m hools were still in the confer
ence race, (it seems like an eter
nity ). ABC was trying to get the
79th Big Came shifted to
Thanksgiving evening, so that
the sold out contest could be na
tionally telecast.
It ABC had televised today's
name, thev could have billed it
as the first bowl game of the year
The Winning Season Bowl.
Stanford, which hasn't had a
losing season since 1963. when
John Ralston took over, stumbles
into the Big Came with a 5-5 re
cord.
1 al ( oai h Mike White is trving
td become the first Golden Bear
coat h since Pappy Waldorf to
put together three consecutive
winning seasons at Berkeley. Cal
has an identical 5-5 mark.
White, who will be involved
in his 22nd Big Game today (three
us a player and 14 <is an assistant
(oach), said. "These games are
alwavs big. This year it's going
to be a great game. It goes with
out saying that the last game ot
the vear is a separate season.
"It's one of the most consistent
traditional games in the country.
—i

I wish we were sitting with a bet
ter record. Even though it's been
.i disappointing year, both Stan
ford and Cal deserve some con
sideration. The top two teams in
the confeience are ranked sec
ond and third in the country."
The game may also play a big
part in determining whether
Christiansen is around for Hie
Big Game next year. A group of
southern California alumni has
been putting heavy pressure on
Stanford Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz to buy up the remaining
two years of Christiansen's
five-year contract.
Ruetz. who says that he's ai
re, ulv made a decision, will an
nounce it next week.
Since both Christiansen and
White were assistants under
John Ralston during the Rose
Howl years, you may see a mirror
image in the styles of the two
teams.
Ci.il was a big play team with
("hui k Muncie and Steve Rivera
last year. But this year, with
wide receiver Wesley Walker
and running back Paul Jones out
for the year, the Bears have had
trouble making the small play.
Stanford quarterback Guv
Benjamin and Cal quarterback
Joe Koth are almost even in stats
and even in injuries.
Benjamin, who ranked second
in the national passing stats this
week, has completed 58.2 per
cent of his passes. Roth has com
pleted 53.4 per cent of his ae
rials. The Card quarterback has
i ompleted 157 of 270 passes for
1825 yards and 11 TDS. Roth has
completed 143 of 268 passes for
IHB9 yards and six touchdowns.
Cardinal receiver Tony Hill
can move into second place on

the Pac-B's all-time receiving list
today. Hill needs seven catches
to tie Washington State's Doug
Flansburg. The senior flanker is
tied with former Cal wide re
ceiver Steve Sweeney for third
place with 1 .'52 career receptions.
Hill surpassed Sweeney and
Steve Rivera on the all-time
Pac-8 receiving yardage list last
week. The senior receiver, who
has 21 OH yards and 17
touchdowns, could pass Walker
on the conference's all-time yar
dage list with 101 yards today.
"Tony Hill, if not the finest, is
one of the great wide receivers in
the country," said White.
Golden Bear tight end George
Freitas has taken up some of the
slack since Walker was hurt. The
junior is Gal's leading receiver
with 31 catches. Split end Jesse
Thompson is just one catch in
back of Freitas.
"Roth had a great game
against us last year," said (Christ
iansen. "He won't have Walker
to throw to Saturday, hut he'll
have some other pretty good re
ceivers."
Muncie took more than just
his dogs with him to New Or
leans. he stole the Cal rushing
attack. The Bear rushing attack
just isn't the same this year. Gal
has gained exactly the same
number of yards on the ground
as Stanford — 1357.
Fullback Tom Newton is the
eighth leading rusher in the con
ference with 485 yards. Stanford
fullback Don Stevenson has
gained 416 yards on 14 fewer
carries than Newton. Stevenson
is averaging 3.9 yards a crack
and Newton 4.0.
Gal's pass defense is ranked

Coach Chris
Amidst speculation that his job may be on the line in today's Big
Game battle, coach Jack Christiansen leads his charges into
Berkeley's Memorial Stadium for the 79th renewal of the
cross-bay rivalry.
seventh in the league and Stan
ford's is ranked eighth. The
Bears intercepted four passes
last week in their 23-22 victory
over Washington State. The
Bears limited USC to a 20-3 vic
tory and followed with a 7-0
shutout over Washington.
The Cards had trouble concen
trating after they got off to a 21-
point first quarter lead over Ore
gon.
"We got a pretty good start and
then in the second quarter, 1
looked around and saw some
card games and players talking
with friends," said Christiansen.
"People were already starting to
leave the stadium."
But Chris shouldn't have any
trouble getting his players to
concentrate today. "They (the
players) turn you on and off
whenever they want to. 1 hope
that they're turned on this week.
Cal is an excellent team."
Said Wh>te. "I've never seen a
player play a bad Big Came.
Some play better than others, but
I've never seen a player play a
bad game."

Through 84 years and 78 pre
vious Big Games, there have
been 36 games decided by a
touchdown or less. Last year.
Cal. with Muncie rushing for 169
yards, scoring four touchdowns
and passing for another, made a
shambles of this tradition, win
ning 48-15.
And even if one team takes a
huge lead you shouldn't try to
beat the traffic and leave early.
The last two Big Games in
Strawberry Ganyon have been
decided on the last play of the
game. Former Stanford kicker
Mike Langford kicked a 50-yard
field goal with no time left in
1974 to give the Gards a 22-20
victory.
In the 1972 Big Game.
Sweeney caught the game win
ning touchdown pass from
ex-Gal quarterback Vince Fer
ragaino to give the Bears a 24-21
victory.
Christiansen said. "1 went to
an alumni party after the game
two years ago (when Stanford
won) and 150 people were there.
Last year there were 40. That's
how people react."
