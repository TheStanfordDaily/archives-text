Stanford wins comedy of errors
but firing casts pall over game

Berkeley — Only very rarely,
maybe once every few years, does
football really transcend the realm
of fun and games.
Saturday afternoon at Memorial
Stadium was one such occasion.
Such a conclusion is inescapable
if you saw Jack Christiansen weep
as his players carried him on their
shoulders across the field after they
upset Cal, 27-24.
It was Christiansen's last game as
Stanford's head coach after having
been officially fired Friday.
Over in the Cal locker room, Bear
halfback Markey Crane was prob
<iblv as sad as Christiansen. A Crane
fumble on Cal's two-yard line with
2:30 left in the game led to Stan

ford's winning touchdown.
Card Duncan McColl recovered
Crane's bobble, which came on a
pitch-out from Cal quarterback Joe
Roth. One minute later, Stanford
senior Ron Inge ran the ball over
from the two to give the Cards a
25-24 lead.
Stanford then went for a two
point conversion, with quarterback
Mike Cordova scoring on a keeper.
Stanford 27, Cal 24.
Huddle
After the game, in the elevator
leading to the dressing room, three
Stanford assistant coaches huddled
in a corner and cried on each other's
shoulders.
"How do you like this?" one of
them said angrily. "We are the only

coaching staff in the country that
has had a winning record the last
five years and then got fired. Maybe
we're the first staff ever to get fired
with a record like this."
Down in Los Angeles Saturday,
USCand UCLA were playing for the
Rose Bowl. But under the clouds in
the Berkeley hills, the stakes
seemed to be much higher. The
Cardinals were playing for "Coach
Chris" in a final gesture of their re
spect and admiration for him.
'Win this game'
As wide receiver Bill kellar said
Friday after hearing Christiansen
announce his firing to the team, "If
we can do anything for him, it's win
this game."
"We're all behind Chris totally,"

said senior linebacker Jeff Barton.
"That's why we carried him on and
off the field. We wanted to let
people know we were behind him. I
think he's a helluva guy. 1 love
him."
The Cards may have been playing
for Christiansen, but memories of
the archrival Bears' 48-15 victory
last year did not hurt their incentive
any either.
It all added up to an emotional
zenith seldom reached at wed
dings, much less football games.
By winning the Cal game, Stan
ford .ivcrtetMts first losing t>cdsoi. in
13 years. The Cards finished 15)76
6-5 overall and 5-2 in the Pacific-8,
good enough for sole possession of
third place behind USC and UCLA.

Of Stanford's five losses, four were
to teams ranked first, second, third
and 17th nationally at one point in
the season.
Cal's loss dropped its record to
5-6 overall and 3-4 in the Pac-8.
Spectators at Memorial Stadium
saw all the controversies, superb
performances and lousy perfor
mances that have characterized the
last four years of Stanford football
surface in this one game. The 1976
Big Game was the Christiansen-
Mike Cordova-Ron Inge-Tony Hill
years in microcosm.
Up and down
Quarterback Cordova threw some
beautiful passes against Cal, such as
a 29-yard masterpiece to Kellar be
tween a Bear cornerback and safety,

but he also rifled a couple of passes
into the ground and two very un
timely interceptions. He came back
to virtually assure Stanford a tie
with his successful two-point con
version.
Cordova alternated between
being the hero and the goat. Just like
the last four years.
There was Guy Benjamin, re
garded first as a God at Stanford, but
now just as a great passer. Benjamin
completed over 50 per cent of his
passes for big yardage Saturday
(13-25-157). Just like the last three
years. Cordova, by the way. com
pleted under 50 per cent of his pas
ses for big yardage (9-24-140). Just
like the last four years.
