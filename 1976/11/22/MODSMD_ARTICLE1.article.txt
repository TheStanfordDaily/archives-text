Stanford wins comedy of errors
but firing casts pall over game

Berkeley — Only very rarely,
maybe once every few years, does
football really transcend the realm
of fun and games.
Saturday afternoon at Memorial
Stadium was one such occasion.
Such a conclusion is inescapable
if you saw Jack Christiansen weep
as his players carried him on their
shoulders across the field after they
upset Cal, 27-24.
It was Christiansen's last game as
Stanford's head coach after having
been officially fired Friday.
Over in the Cal locker room, Bear
halfback Markey Crane was prob
<iblv as sad as Christiansen. A Crane
fumble on Cal's two-yard line with
2:30 left in the game led to Stan

ford's winning touchdown.
Card Duncan McColl recovered
Crane's bobble, which came on a
pitch-out from Cal quarterback Joe
Roth. One minute later, Stanford
senior Ron Inge ran the ball over
from the two to give the Cards a
25-24 lead.
Stanford then went for a two
point conversion, with quarterback
Mike Cordova scoring on a keeper.
Stanford 27, Cal 24.
Huddle
After the game, in the elevator
leading to the dressing room, three
Stanford assistant coaches huddled
in a corner and cried on each other's
shoulders.
"How do you like this?" one of
them said angrily. "We are the only

coaching staff in the country that
has had a winning record the last
five years and then got fired. Maybe
we're the first staff ever to get fired
with a record like this."
Down in Los Angeles Saturday,
USCand UCLA were playing for the
Rose Bowl. But under the clouds in
the Berkeley hills, the stakes
seemed to be much higher. The
Cardinals were playing for "Coach
Chris" in a final gesture of their re
spect and admiration for him.
'Win this game'
As wide receiver Bill kellar said
Friday after hearing Christiansen
announce his firing to the team, "If
we can do anything for him, it's win
this game."
"We're all behind Chris totally,"

said senior linebacker Jeff Barton.
"That's why we carried him on and
off the field. We wanted to let
people know we were behind him. I
think he's a helluva guy. 1 love
him."
The Cards may have been playing
for Christiansen, but memories of
the archrival Bears' 48-15 victory
last year did not hurt their incentive
any either.
It all added up to an emotional
zenith seldom reached at wed
dings, much less football games.
By winning the Cal game, Stan
ford .ivcrtetMts first losing t>cdsoi. in
13 years. The Cards finished 15)76
6-5 overall and 5-2 in the Pacific-8,
good enough for sole possession of
third place behind USC and UCLA.

Of Stanford's five losses, four were
to teams ranked first, second, third
and 17th nationally at one point in
the season.
Cal's loss dropped its record to
5-6 overall and 3-4 in the Pac-8.
Spectators at Memorial Stadium
saw all the controversies, superb
performances and lousy perfor
mances that have characterized the
last four years of Stanford football
surface in this one game. The 1976
Big Game was the Christiansen-
Mike Cordova-Ron Inge-Tony Hill
years in microcosm.
Up and down
Quarterback Cordova threw some
beautiful passes against Cal, such as
a 29-yard masterpiece to Kellar be
tween a Bear cornerback and safety,

but he also rifled a couple of passes
into the ground and two very un
timely interceptions. He came back
to virtually assure Stanford a tie
with his successful two-point con
version.
Cordova alternated between
being the hero and the goat. Just like
the last four years.
There was Guy Benjamin, re
garded first as a God at Stanford, but
now just as a great passer. Benjamin
completed over 50 per cent of his
passes for big yardage Saturday
(13-25-157). Just like the last three
years. Cordova, by the way. com
pleted under 50 per cent of his pas
ses for big yardage (9-24-140). Just
like the last four years.

— on back in endzone) winning touchdown
There was the Benjamin-
Cordova, Cordova-Benjamin
controversy. Benjamin played
31 minutes against Cal; Cordova
29 minutes. A two-QB system.
Just like the past two years.
Key interception
There was Christiansen's
stubbornness or patience, de
pending on your point of view.
Cordova threw an interception
with five minutes left that easily
could have lost the game. But on
Stanford's next offensive series,
Chris sent him back in. Just like
the last four years.
There was Inge, who was sup
posed to finally give Stanford a
real running threat, but really
didn't. Inge fumbled on Cal's
goal line in the first quarter, but

came back to score the winning
touchdown. Inge: sometimes
blowing it, sometimes showing
his potential. Just like the past
few years.
There was kicker Mike
Michel, who has all the ability
in the world, but little consis
tency. He missed a 45-yard field
goal attempt, a virtual chip shot
for him, in the second quarter,
but took immense pressure off
the defense with some clutch
booming punts. Michel punted
eight times foran average of 43.1
yards, including a 68-yarder.
Michel showed that he is a
strong kicker, but not yet a
polished one. Just like the past
two years.
There was Savann Thompson
getting burned one-on-one for a

touchdown in the second quar
ter. Just like the past two years.
Finally, there was the excel
lence of Tony Hill and Duncan
McColl. Hill caught eight passes
for 117 yards and one TD and
was named the Offensive Player
of the Came.
It's not surprising that it was
McColl who came up with
Crane's fourth-quarter fumble.
He always seems to be around
the ball.
Hill and McColl: outstanding
again.
And there was the game itself.
It was a Big Came in every sense
of the tradition. Perhaps the best
way to describe the level of ex
citement is to say that the game
was worth whatever scalpers
were asking for tickets. Even if
they had been selling them for
$50, at least in retrospect, you
might have wanted to get in on
this one.
Close game
The outcome was in doubt for
all but the last 52 seconds. The
lead changed hands four times.
After Stanford had gone ahead.
27-24, quarterback Joe Roth and
the Bears had the ball on their
own 20 and 1:30 with which to
work. Naturally enough, many
people recalled the scene two
years ago when Benjamin rallied
Stanford to victory in the final 23
seconds.
Cal couldn't pull it off. The
Bears didn't even get a first
down. Stanford, using a three
man rush and an extra defensive
back, held Roth to just one
seven-yard completion.
It didn't help Cal that Bear re
ceiver Jesse Thompson dropped
a perfectly-thrown sideline pass
that would have been good for
about 15 yards. For some reason,
Bear backs and receivers were
dropping passes all day.
Big play
The big play, of course, was
Crane's fumble. "I
just dropped it — I don't know
how," Crane said, crying. "It was

my fault — I cost us the game. If I
hadn't dropped it, they wouldn't
have gotten the touchdown — I
know that."
Cal coach Mike White also al
ternated his quarterbacks. Roth
and Fred Besana, both seniors.
Both threw very well when they
had any time at all, although
their statistics weren't particu
larly impressive because of the
dropped passes. Roth completed
11 of 27 passes for 100 yards and
Besana was six of 11 for 74 yards.

So that's it. No more Roth or
Besana for Cal. No more Hill,
McColl, Inge, Michel, Cordova,
Christiansen et. al. for Stanford.
But those searching for some
continuity in next year's team
need not fret too much.
"I'll be back," Benjamin said.
Cardinal Notes: Hill's eight
catches for 117 yards moved him
to second on the all-time Pac-8
receptions and yardage lists ....
He finished behind Washington
State's Hugh Campbell in both

categories .... Hill's final career
totals read 140 catches for 2225
yards and 18 touchdowns.
Christiansen may not be the
only man to have coached his
last Pac-8 game Saturday
It's rumored that Oregon head
coach Don Read's dismissal is
imminent .... The Ducks won
their first league game Saturday
over Oregon State, 23-14, after
being down 14-0 at the half.
The Big Game attendance of
76,780 was the largest crowd to

see a football game in the Bay
Area this year.
Mike Cordova finished his
Stanford career as the fifth lead
ing passer in Card history ....
His 140 passing yards against
Cal gave him a four-year total of
3556, just 38 behind former
All-Pro quarterback John Brodie.
Ceresino led all defenders in
the Big Came with 11 unassisted
tackles .... Next was Cal's Burl
Toler with seven.

Mike Cordova-Ron Inge-Tony Hill
years in microcosm.
Up and down
Quarterback Cordova threw some
beautiful passes against Cal, such as
a 29-yard masterpiece to Kellar be
tween a Bear cornerback and safety,

but he also rifled a couple of passes
into the ground and two very un
timely interceptions. He came back
to virtually assure Stanford a tie
with his successful two-point con
version.
Cordova alternated between
being the hero and the goat. Just like
the last four years.
There was Guy Benjamin, re
garded first as a God at Stanford, but
now just as a great passer. Benjamin
completed over 50 per cent of his
passes for big yardage Saturday
(13-25-157). Just like the last three
years. Cordova, by the way. com
pleted under 50 per cent of his pas
ses for big yardage (9-24-140). Just
like the last four years.

There was the Benjamin-
Cordova, Cordova-Benjamin
controversy. Benjamin played
31 minutes against Cal; Cordova
29 minutes. A two-QB system.
Just like the past two years.
Key interception
There was Christiansen's
stubbornness or patience, de
pending on your point of view.
Cordova threw an interception
with five minutes left that easily
could have lost the game. But on
Stanford's next offensive series,
Chris sent him back in. Just like
the last four years.
There was Inge, who was sup
posed to finally give Stanford a
real running threat, but really
didn't. Inge fumbled on Cal's
goal line in the first quarter, but

came back to score the winning
touchdown. Inge: sometimes
blowing it, sometimes showing
his potential. Just like the past
few years.
There was kicker Mike
Michel, who has all the ability
in the world, but little consis
tency. He missed a 45-yard field
goal attempt, a virtual chip shot
for him, in the second quarter,
but took immense pressure off
the defense with some clutch
booming punts. Michel punted
eight times foran average of 43.1
yards, including a 68-yarder.
Michel showed that he is a
strong kicker, but not yet a
polished one. Just like the past
two years.
There was Savann Thompson
getting burned one-on-one for a

touchdown in the second quar
ter. Just like the past two years.
Finally, there was the excel
lence of Tony Hill and Duncan
McColl. Hill caught eight passes
for 117 yards and one TD and
was named the Offensive Player
of the Came.
It's not surprising that it was
McColl who came up with
Crane's fourth-quarter fumble.
He always seems to be around
the ball.
Hill and McColl: outstanding
again.
And there was the game itself.
It was a Big Came in every sense
of the tradition. Perhaps the best
way to describe the level of ex
citement is to say that the game
was worth whatever scalpers
were asking for tickets. Even if
they had been selling them for
$50, at least in retrospect, you
might have wanted to get in on
this one.
Close game
The outcome was in doubt for
all but the last 52 seconds. The
lead changed hands four times.
After Stanford had gone ahead.
27-24, quarterback Joe Roth and
the Bears had the ball on their
own 20 and 1:30 with which to
work. Naturally enough, many
people recalled the scene two
years ago when Benjamin rallied
Stanford to victory in the final 23
seconds.
Cal couldn't pull it off. The
Bears didn't even get a first
down. Stanford, using a three
man rush and an extra defensive
back, held Roth to just one
seven-yard completion.
It didn't help Cal that Bear re
ceiver Jesse Thompson dropped
a perfectly-thrown sideline pass
that would have been good for
about 15 yards. For some reason,
Bear backs and receivers were
dropping passes all day.
Big play
The big play, of course, was
Crane's fumble. "I
just dropped it — I don't know
how," Crane said, crying. "It was

my fault — I cost us the game. If I
hadn't dropped it, they wouldn't
have gotten the touchdown — I
know that."
Cal coach Mike White also al
ternated his quarterbacks. Roth
and Fred Besana, both seniors.
Both threw very well when they
had any time at all, although
their statistics weren't particu
larly impressive because of the
dropped passes. Roth completed
11 of 27 passes for 100 yards and
Besana was six of 11 for 74 yards.

So that's it. No more Roth or
Besana for Cal. No more Hill,
McColl, Inge, Michel, Cordova,
Christiansen et. al. for Stanford.
But those searching for some
continuity in next year's team
need not fret too much.
"I'll be back," Benjamin said.
Cardinal Notes: Hill's eight
catches for 117 yards moved him
to second on the all-time Pac-8
receptions and yardage lists ....
He finished behind Washington
State's Hugh Campbell in both

categories .... Hill's final career
totals read 140 catches for 2225
yards and 18 touchdowns.
Christiansen may not be the
only man to have coached his
last Pac-8 game Saturday
It's rumored that Oregon head
coach Don Read's dismissal is
imminent .... The Ducks won
their first league game Saturday
over Oregon State, 23-14, after
being down 14-0 at the half.
The Big Game attendance of
76,780 was the largest crowd to

see a football game in the Bay
Area this year.
Mike Cordova finished his
Stanford career as the fifth lead
ing passer in Card history ....
His 140 passing yards against
Cal gave him a four-year total of
3556, just 38 behind former
All-Pro quarterback John Brodie.
Ceresino led all defenders in
the Big Came with 11 unassisted
tackles .... Next was Cal's Burl
Toler with seven.

Stanford wins comedy of errors
but firing casts pall over game

Berkeley — Only very rarely,
maybe once every few years, does
football really transcend the realm
of fun and games.
Saturday afternoon at Memorial
Stadium was one such occasion.
Such a conclusion is inescapable
if you saw Jack Christiansen weep
as his players carried him on their
shoulders across the field after they
upset Cal, 27-24.
It was Christiansen's last game as
Stanford's head coach after having
been officially fired Friday.
Over in the Cal locker room, Bear
halfback Markey Crane was prob
<iblv as sad as Christiansen. A Crane
fumble on Cal's two-yard line with
2:30 left in the game led to Stan

ford's winning touchdown.
Card Duncan McColl recovered
Crane's bobble, which came on a
pitch-out from Cal quarterback Joe
Roth. One minute later, Stanford
senior Ron Inge ran the ball over
from the two to give the Cards a
25-24 lead.
Stanford then went for a two
point conversion, with quarterback
Mike Cordova scoring on a keeper.
Stanford 27, Cal 24.
Huddle
After the game, in the elevator
leading to the dressing room, three
Stanford assistant coaches huddled
in a corner and cried on each other's
shoulders.
"How do you like this?" one of
them said angrily. "We are the only

coaching staff in the country that
has had a winning record the last
five years and then got fired. Maybe
we're the first staff ever to get fired
with a record like this."
Down in Los Angeles Saturday,
USCand UCLA were playing for the
Rose Bowl. But under the clouds in
the Berkeley hills, the stakes
seemed to be much higher. The
Cardinals were playing for "Coach
Chris" in a final gesture of their re
spect and admiration for him.
'Win this game'
As wide receiver Bill kellar said
Friday after hearing Christiansen
announce his firing to the team, "If
we can do anything for him, it's win
this game."
"We're all behind Chris totally,"

said senior linebacker Jeff Barton.
"That's why we carried him on and
off the field. We wanted to let
people know we were behind him. I
think he's a helluva guy. 1 love
him."
The Cards may have been playing
for Christiansen, but memories of
the archrival Bears' 48-15 victory
last year did not hurt their incentive
any either.
It all added up to an emotional
zenith seldom reached at wed
dings, much less football games.
By winning the Cal game, Stan
ford .ivcrtetMts first losing t>cdsoi. in
13 years. The Cards finished 15)76
6-5 overall and 5-2 in the Pacific-8,
good enough for sole possession of
third place behind USC and UCLA.

Of Stanford's five losses, four were
to teams ranked first, second, third
and 17th nationally at one point in
the season.
Cal's loss dropped its record to
5-6 overall and 3-4 in the Pac-8.
Spectators at Memorial Stadium
saw all the controversies, superb
performances and lousy perfor
mances that have characterized the
last four years of Stanford football
surface in this one game. The 1976
Big Game was the Christiansen-
Mike Cordova-Ron Inge-Tony Hill

might have wanted to get in on
this one.
Close game
The outcome was in doubt for
all but the last 52 seconds. The
lead changed hands four times.
After Stanford had gone ahead.
27-24, quarterback Joe Roth and
the Bears had the ball on their
own 20 and 1:30 with which to
work. Naturally enough, many
people recalled the scene two
years ago when Benjamin rallied
Stanford to victory in the final 23
seconds.
Cal couldn't pull it off. The
Bears didn't even get a first
down. Stanford, using a three
man rush and an extra defensive
back, held Roth to just one
seven-yard completion.
It didn't help Cal that Bear re
ceiver Jesse Thompson dropped
a perfectly-thrown sideline pass
that would have been good for
about 15 yards. For some reason,
Bear backs and receivers were
dropping passes all day.
Big play
The big play, of course, was
Crane's fumble. "I
just dropped it — I don't know
how," Crane said, crying. "It was

my fault — I cost us the game. If I
hadn't dropped it, they wouldn't
have gotten the touchdown — I
know that."
Cal coach Mike White also al
ternated his quarterbacks. Roth
and Fred Besana, both seniors.
Both threw very well when they
had any time at all, although
their statistics weren't particu
larly impressive because of the
dropped passes. Roth completed
11 of 27 passes for 100 yards and
Besana was six of 11 for 74 yards.

So that's it. No more Roth or
Besana for Cal. No more Hill,
McColl, Inge, Michel, Cordova,
Christiansen et. al. for Stanford.
But those searching for some
continuity in next year's team
need not fret too much.
"I'll be back," Benjamin said.
Cardinal Notes: Hill's eight
catches for 117 yards moved him
to second on the all-time Pac-8
receptions and yardage lists ....
He finished behind Washington
State's Hugh Campbell in both

categories .... Hill's final career
totals read 140 catches for 2225
yards and 18 touchdowns.
Christiansen may not be the
only man to have coached his
last Pac-8 game Saturday
It's rumored that Oregon head
coach Don Read's dismissal is
imminent .... The Ducks won
their first league game Saturday
over Oregon State, 23-14, after
being down 14-0 at the half.
The Big Game attendance of
76,780 was the largest crowd to

see a football game in the Bay
Area this year.
Mike Cordova finished his
Stanford career as the fifth lead
ing passer in Card history ....
His 140 passing yards against
Cal gave him a four-year total of
3556, just 38 behind former
All-Pro quarterback John Brodie.
Ceresino led all defenders in
the Big Came with 11 unassisted
tackles .... Next was Cal's Burl
Toler with seven.

Stanford wins comedy of errors
but firing casts pall over game

Berkeley — Only very rarely,
maybe once every few years, does
football really transcend the realm
of fun and games.
Saturday afternoon at Memorial
Stadium was one such occasion.
Such a conclusion is inescapable
if you saw Jack Christiansen weep
as his players carried him on their
shoulders across the field after they
upset Cal, 27-24.
It was Christiansen's last game as
Stanford's head coach after having
been officially fired Friday.
Over in the Cal locker room, Bear
halfback Markey Crane was prob
<iblv as sad as Christiansen. A Crane
fumble on Cal's two-yard line with
2:30 left in the game led to Stan

ford's winning touchdown.
Card Duncan McColl recovered
Crane's bobble, which came on a
pitch-out from Cal quarterback Joe
Roth. One minute later, Stanford
senior Ron Inge ran the ball over
from the two to give the Cards a
25-24 lead.
Stanford then went for a two
point conversion, with quarterback
Mike Cordova scoring on a keeper.
Stanford 27, Cal 24.
Huddle
After the game, in the elevator
leading to the dressing room, three
Stanford assistant coaches huddled
in a corner and cried on each other's
shoulders.
"How do you like this?" one of
them said angrily. "We are the only

coaching staff in the country that
has had a winning record the last
five years and then got fired. Maybe
we're the first staff ever to get fired
with a record like this."
Down in Los Angeles Saturday,
USCand UCLA were playing for the
Rose Bowl. But under the clouds in
the Berkeley hills, the stakes
seemed to be much higher. The
Cardinals were playing for "Coach
Chris" in a final gesture of their re
spect and admiration for him.
'Win this game'
As wide receiver Bill kellar said
Friday after hearing Christiansen
announce his firing to the team, "If
we can do anything for him, it's win
this game."
"We're all behind Chris totally,"

said senior linebacker Jeff Barton.
"That's why we carried him on and
off the field. We wanted to let
people know we were behind him. I
think he's a helluva guy. 1 love
him."
The Cards may have been playing
for Christiansen, but memories of
the archrival Bears' 48-15 victory
last year did not hurt their incentive
any either.
It all added up to an emotional
zenith seldom reached at wed
dings, much less football games.
By winning the Cal game, Stan
ford .ivcrtetMts first losing t>cdsoi. in
13 years. The Cards finished 15)76
6-5 overall and 5-2 in the Pacific-8,
good enough for sole possession of
third place behind USC and UCLA.

Of Stanford's five losses, four were
to teams ranked first, second, third
and 17th nationally at one point in
the season.
Cal's loss dropped its record to
5-6 overall and 3-4 in the Pac-8.
Spectators at Memorial Stadium
saw all the controversies, superb
performances and lousy perfor
mances that have characterized the
last four years of Stanford football
surface in this one game. The 1976
Big Game was the Christiansen-
Mike Cordova-Ron Inge-Tony Hill
years in microcosm.
Up and down
Quarterback Cordova threw some
beautiful passes against Cal, such as
a 29-yard masterpiece to Kellar be
tween a Bear cornerback and safety,

but he also rifled a couple of passes
into the ground and two very un
timely interceptions. He came back
to virtually assure Stanford a tie
with his successful two-point con
version.
Cordova alternated between
being the hero and the goat. Just like
the last four years.
There was Guy Benjamin, re
garded first as a God at Stanford, but
now just as a great passer. Benjamin
completed over 50 per cent of his
passes for big yardage Saturday
(13-25-157). Just like the last three
years. Cordova, by the way. com
pleted under 50 per cent of his pas
ses for big yardage (9-24-140). Just
like the last four years.


A leaping Gary Anderson (65), Mike Cordova (16) and Don Stevenson (36) celebrate Ron Inge's (left foreground
— on back in endzone) winning touchdown
There was the Benjamin-
Cordova, Cordova-Benjamin
controversy. Benjamin played
31 minutes against Cal; Cordova
29 minutes. A two-QB system.
Just like the past two years.
Key interception
There was Christiansen's
stubbornness or patience, de
pending on your point of view.
Cordova threw an interception
with five minutes left that easily
could have lost the game. But on
Stanford's next offensive series,
Chris sent him back in. Just like
the last four years.
There was Inge, who was sup
posed to finally give Stanford a
real running threat, but really
didn't. Inge fumbled on Cal's
goal line in the first quarter, but

came back to score the winning
touchdown. Inge: sometimes
blowing it, sometimes showing
his potential. Just like the past
few years.
There was kicker Mike
Michel, who has all the ability
in the world, but little consis
tency. He missed a 45-yard field
goal attempt, a virtual chip shot
for him, in the second quarter,
but took immense pressure off
the defense with some clutch
booming punts. Michel punted
eight times foran average of 43.1
yards, including a 68-yarder.
Michel showed that he is a
strong kicker, but not yet a
polished one. Just like the past
two years.
There was Savann Thompson
getting burned one-on-one for a

touchdown in the second quar
ter. Just like the past two years.
Finally, there was the excel
lence of Tony Hill and Duncan
McColl. Hill caught eight passes
for 117 yards and one TD and
was named the Offensive Player
of the Came.
It's not surprising that it was
McColl who came up with
Crane's fourth-quarter fumble.
He always seems to be around
the ball.
Hill and McColl: outstanding
again.
And there was the game itself.
It was a Big Came in every sense
of the tradition. Perhaps the best
way to describe the level of ex
citement is to say that the game
was worth whatever scalpers
were asking for tickets. Even if
they had been selling them for
$50, at least in retrospect, you
might have wanted to get in on
this one.

Stanford wins comedy of errors
but firing casts pall over game

Berkeley — Only very rarely,
maybe once every few years, does
football really transcend the realm
of fun and games.
Saturday afternoon at Memorial
Stadium was one such occasion.
Such a conclusion is inescapable
if you saw Jack Christiansen weep
as his players carried him on their
shoulders across the field after they
upset Cal, 27-24.
It was Christiansen's last game as
Stanford's head coach after having
been officially fired Friday.
Over in the Cal locker room, Bear
halfback Markey Crane was prob
<iblv as sad as Christiansen. A Crane
fumble on Cal's two-yard line with
2:30 left in the game led to Stan

ford's winning touchdown.
Card Duncan McColl recovered
Crane's bobble, which came on a
pitch-out from Cal quarterback Joe
Roth. One minute later, Stanford
senior Ron Inge ran the ball over
from the two to give the Cards a
25-24 lead.
Stanford then went for a two
point conversion, with quarterback
Mike Cordova scoring on a keeper.
Stanford 27, Cal 24.
Huddle
After the game, in the elevator
leading to the dressing room, three
Stanford assistant coaches huddled
in a corner and cried on each other's
shoulders.
"How do you like this?" one of
them said angrily. "We are the only

coaching staff in the country that
has had a winning record the last
five years and then got fired. Maybe
we're the first staff ever to get fired
with a record like this."
Down in Los Angeles Saturday,
USCand UCLA were playing for the
Rose Bowl. But under the clouds in
the Berkeley hills, the stakes
seemed to be much higher. The
Cardinals were playing for "Coach
Chris" in a final gesture of their re
spect and admiration for him.
'Win this game'
As wide receiver Bill kellar said
Friday after hearing Christiansen
announce his firing to the team, "If
we can do anything for him, it's win
this game."
"We're all behind Chris totally,"

said senior linebacker Jeff Barton.
"That's why we carried him on and
off the field. We wanted to let
people know we were behind him. I
think he's a helluva guy. 1 love
him."
The Cards may have been playing
for Christiansen, but memories of
the archrival Bears' 48-15 victory
last year did not hurt their incentive
any either.
It all added up to an emotional
zenith seldom reached at wed
dings, much less football games.
By winning the Cal game, Stan
ford .ivcrtetMts first losing t>cdsoi. in
13 years. The Cards finished 15)76
6-5 overall and 5-2 in the Pacific-8,
good enough for sole possession of
third place behind USC and UCLA.

Of Stanford's five losses, four were
to teams ranked first, second, third
and 17th nationally at one point in
the season.
Cal's loss dropped its record to
5-6 overall and 3-4 in the Pac-8.
Spectators at Memorial Stadium
saw all the controversies, superb
performances and lousy perfor
mances that have characterized the
last four years of Stanford football
surface in this one game. The 1976
Big Game was the Christiansen-
Mike Cordova-Ron Inge-Tony Hill
years in microcosm.
Up and down
Quarterback Cordova threw some
beautiful passes against Cal, such as
a 29-yard masterpiece to Kellar be
tween a Bear cornerback and safety,

but he also rifled a couple of passes
into the ground and two very un
timely interceptions. He came back
to virtually assure Stanford a tie
with his successful two-point con
version.
Cordova alternated between
being the hero and the goat. Just like
the last four years.
There was Guy Benjamin, re
garded first as a God at Stanford, but
now just as a great passer. Benjamin
completed over 50 per cent of his
passes for big yardage Saturday
(13-25-157). Just like the last three
years. Cordova, by the way. com
pleted under 50 per cent of his pas
ses for big yardage (9-24-140). Just
like the last four years.


A leaping Gary Anderson (65), Mike Cordova (16) and Don Stevenson (36) celebrate Ron Inge's (left foreground
— on back in endzone) winning touchdown
There was the Benjamin-
Cordova, Cordova-Benjamin
controversy. Benjamin played
31 minutes against Cal; Cordova
29 minutes. A two-QB system.
Just like the past two years.
Key interception
There was Christiansen's
stubbornness or patience, de
pending on your point of view.
Cordova threw an interception
with five minutes left that easily
could have lost the game. But on
Stanford's next offensive series,
Chris sent him back in. Just like
the last four years.
There was Inge, who was sup
posed to finally give Stanford a
real running threat, but really
didn't. Inge fumbled on Cal's
goal line in the first quarter, but

came back to score the winning
touchdown. Inge: sometimes
blowing it, sometimes showing
his potential. Just like the past
few years.
There was kicker Mike
Michel, who has all the ability
in the world, but little consis
tency. He missed a 45-yard field
goal attempt, a virtual chip shot
for him, in the second quarter,
but took immense pressure off
the defense with some clutch
booming punts. Michel punted
eight times foran average of 43.1
yards, including a 68-yarder.
Michel showed that he is a
strong kicker, but not yet a
polished one. Just like the past
two years.
There was Savann Thompson
getting burned one-on-one for a

touchdown in the second quar
ter. Just like the past two years.
Finally, there was the excel
lence of Tony Hill and Duncan
McColl. Hill caught eight passes
for 117 yards and one TD and
was named the Offensive Player
of the Came.
It's not surprising that it was
McColl who came up with
Crane's fourth-quarter fumble.
He always seems to be around
the ball.
Hill and McColl: outstanding
again.
And there was the game itself.
It was a Big Came in every sense
of the tradition. Perhaps the best
way to describe the level of ex
citement is to say that the game
was worth whatever scalpers
were asking for tickets. Even if
they had been selling them for
$50, at least in retrospect, you
might have wanted to get in on
this one.
Close game
The outcome was in doubt for
all but the last 52 seconds. The
lead changed hands four times.
After Stanford had gone ahead.
27-24, quarterback Joe Roth and
the Bears had the ball on their
own 20 and 1:30 with which to
work. Naturally enough, many
people recalled the scene two
years ago when Benjamin rallied
Stanford to victory in the final 23
seconds.
Cal couldn't pull it off. The
Bears didn't even get a first
down. Stanford, using a three
man rush and an extra defensive
back, held Roth to just one
seven-yard completion.
It didn't help Cal that Bear re
ceiver Jesse Thompson dropped
a perfectly-thrown sideline pass
that would have been good for
about 15 yards. For some reason,
Bear backs and receivers were
dropping passes all day.
Big play
The big play, of course, was
Crane's fumble. "I
just dropped it — I don't know
how," Crane said, crying. "It was

my fault — I cost us the game. If I
hadn't dropped it, they wouldn't
have gotten the touchdown — I
know that."
Cal coach Mike White also al
ternated his quarterbacks. Roth
and Fred Besana, both seniors.
Both threw very well when they
had any time at all, although
their statistics weren't particu
larly impressive because of the
dropped passes. Roth completed
11 of 27 passes for 100 yards and
Besana was six of 11 for 74 yards.

So that's it. No more Roth or
Besana for Cal. No more Hill,
McColl, Inge, Michel, Cordova,
Christiansen et. al. for Stanford.
But those searching for some
continuity in next year's team
need not fret too much.
"I'll be back," Benjamin said.
Cardinal Notes: Hill's eight
catches for 117 yards moved him
to second on the all-time Pac-8
receptions and yardage lists ....
He finished behind Washington
State's Hugh Campbell in both

categories .... Hill's final career
totals read 140 catches for 2225
yards and 18 touchdowns.
Christiansen may not be the
only man to have coached his
last Pac-8 game Saturday
It's rumored that Oregon head
coach Don Read's dismissal is
imminent .... The Ducks won
their first league game Saturday
over Oregon State, 23-14, after
being down 14-0 at the half.
The Big Game attendance of
76,780 was the largest crowd to

see a football game in the Bay
Area this year.
Mike Cordova finished his
Stanford career as the fifth lead
ing passer in Card history ....
His 140 passing yards against
Cal gave him a four-year total of
3556, just 38 behind former
All-Pro quarterback John Brodie.
Ceresino led all defenders in
the Big Came with 11 unassisted
tackles .... Next was Cal's Burl
Toler with seven.

Stanford wins comedy of errors
but firing casts pall over game

Berkeley — Only very rarely,
maybe once every few years, does
football really transcend the realm
of fun and games.
Saturday afternoon at Memorial
Stadium was one such occasion.
Such a conclusion is inescapable
if you saw Jack Christiansen weep
as his players carried him on their
shoulders across the field after they
upset Cal, 27-24.
It was Christiansen's last game as
Stanford's head coach after having
been officially fired Friday.
Over in the Cal locker room, Bear
halfback Markey Crane was prob
<iblv as sad as Christiansen. A Crane
fumble on Cal's two-yard line with
2:30 left in the game led to Stan

ford's winning touchdown.
Card Duncan McColl recovered
Crane's bobble, which came on a
pitch-out from Cal quarterback Joe
Roth. One minute later, Stanford
senior Ron Inge ran the ball over
from the two to give the Cards a
25-24 lead.
Stanford then went for a two
point conversion, with quarterback
Mike Cordova scoring on a keeper.
Stanford 27, Cal 24.
Huddle
After the game, in the elevator
leading to the dressing room, three
Stanford assistant coaches huddled
in a corner and cried on each other's
shoulders.
"How do you like this?" one of
them said angrily. "We are the only

coaching staff in the country that
has had a winning record the last
five years and then got fired. Maybe
we're the first staff ever to get fired
with a record like this."
Down in Los Angeles Saturday,
USCand UCLA were playing for the
Rose Bowl. But under the clouds in
the Berkeley hills, the stakes
seemed to be much higher. The
Cardinals were playing for "Coach
Chris" in a final gesture of their re
spect and admiration for him.
'Win this game'
As wide receiver Bill kellar said
Friday after hearing Christiansen
announce his firing to the team, "If
we can do anything for him, it's win
this game."
"We're all behind Chris totally,"

said senior linebacker Jeff Barton.
"That's why we carried him on and
off the field. We wanted to let
people know we were behind him. I
think he's a helluva guy. 1 love
him."
The Cards may have been playing
for Christiansen, but memories of
the archrival Bears' 48-15 victory
last year did not hurt their incentive
any either.
It all added up to an emotional
zenith seldom reached at wed
dings, much less football games.
By winning the Cal game, Stan
ford .ivcrtetMts first losing t>cdsoi. in
13 years. The Cards finished 15)76
6-5 overall and 5-2 in the Pacific-8,
good enough for sole possession of
third place behind USC and UCLA.

Of Stanford's five losses, four were
to teams ranked first, second, third
and 17th nationally at one point in
the season.
Cal's loss dropped its record to
5-6 overall and 3-4 in the Pac-8.
Spectators at Memorial Stadium
saw all the controversies, superb
performances and lousy perfor
mances that have characterized the
last four years of Stanford football
surface in this one game. The 1976
Big Game was the Christiansen-
Mike Cordova-Ron Inge-Tony Hill
years in microcosm.
Up and down
Quarterback Cordova threw some
beautiful passes against Cal, such as
a 29-yard masterpiece to Kellar be
tween a Bear cornerback and safety,

but he also rifled a couple of passes
into the ground and two very un
timely interceptions. He came back
to virtually assure Stanford a tie
with his successful two-point con
version.
Cordova alternated between
being the hero and the goat. Just like
the last four years.
There was Guy Benjamin, re
garded first as a God at Stanford, but
now just as a great passer. Benjamin
completed over 50 per cent of his
passes for big yardage Saturday
(13-25-157). Just like the last three
years. Cordova, by the way. com
pleted under 50 per cent of his pas
ses for big yardage (9-24-140). Just
like the last four years.


A leaping Gary Anderson (65), Mike Cordova (16) and Don Stevenson (36) celebrate Ron Inge's (left foreground
— on back in endzone) winning touchdown
There was the Benjamin-
Cordova, Cordova-Benjamin
controversy. Benjamin played
31 minutes against Cal; Cordova
29 minutes. A two-QB system.
Just like the past two years.
Key interception
There was Christiansen's
stubbornness or patience, de
pending on your point of view.
Cordova threw an interception
with five minutes left that easily
could have lost the game. But on
Stanford's next offensive series,
Chris sent him back in. Just like
the last four years.
There was Inge, who was sup
posed to finally give Stanford a
real running threat, but really
didn't. Inge fumbled on Cal's
goal line in the first quarter, but

came back to score the winning
touchdown. Inge: sometimes
blowing it, sometimes showing
his potential. Just like the past
few years.
There was kicker Mike
Michel, who has all the ability
in the world, but little consis
tency. He missed a 45-yard field
goal attempt, a virtual chip shot
for him, in the second quarter,
but took immense pressure off
the defense with some clutch
booming punts. Michel punted
eight times foran average of 43.1
yards, including a 68-yarder.
Michel showed that he is a
strong kicker, but not yet a
polished one. Just like the past
two years.
There was Savann Thompson
getting burned one-on-one for a

touchdown in the second quar
ter. Just like the past two years.
Finally, there was the excel
lence of Tony Hill and Duncan
McColl. Hill caught eight passes
for 117 yards and one TD and
was named the Offensive Player
of the Came.
It's not surprising that it was
McColl who came up with
Crane's fourth-quarter fumble.
He always seems to be around
the ball.
Hill and McColl: outstanding
again.
And there was the game itself.
It was a Big Came in every sense
of the tradition. Perhaps the best
way to describe the level of ex
citement is to say that the game
was worth whatever scalpers
were asking for tickets. Even if
they had been selling them for
$50, at least in retrospect, you
might have wanted to get in on
this one.
Close game
The outcome was in doubt for
all but the last 52 seconds. The
lead changed hands four times.
After Stanford had gone ahead.
27-24, quarterback Joe Roth and
the Bears had the ball on their
own 20 and 1:30 with which to
work. Naturally enough, many
people recalled the scene two
years ago when Benjamin rallied
Stanford to victory in the final 23
seconds.
Cal couldn't pull it off. The
Bears didn't even get a first
down. Stanford, using a three
man rush and an extra defensive
back, held Roth to just one
seven-yard completion.
It didn't help Cal that Bear re
ceiver Jesse Thompson dropped
a perfectly-thrown sideline pass
that would have been good for
about 15 yards. For some reason,
Bear backs and receivers were
dropping passes all day.
Big play
The big play, of course, was
Crane's fumble. "I
just dropped it — I don't know
how," Crane said, crying. "It was

my fault — I cost us the game. If I
hadn't dropped it, they wouldn't
have gotten the touchdown — I
know that."
Cal coach Mike White also al
ternated his quarterbacks. Roth
and Fred Besana, both seniors.
Both threw very well when they
had any time at all, although
their statistics weren't particu
larly impressive because of the
dropped passes. Roth completed
11 of 27 passes for 100 yards and
Besana was six of 11 for 74 yards.

So that's it. No more Roth or
Besana for Cal. No more Hill,
McColl, Inge, Michel, Cordova,
Christiansen et. al. for Stanford.
But those searching for some
continuity in next year's team
need not fret too much.
"I'll be back," Benjamin said.
Cardinal Notes: Hill's eight
catches for 117 yards moved him
to second on the all-time Pac-8
receptions and yardage lists ....
He finished behind Washington
State's Hugh Campbell in both

categories .... Hill's final career
totals read 140 catches for 2225
yards and 18 touchdowns.
Christiansen may not be the
only man to have coached his
last Pac-8 game Saturday
It's rumored that Oregon head
coach Don Read's dismissal is
imminent .... The Ducks won
their first league game Saturday
over Oregon State, 23-14, after
being down 14-0 at the half.
The Big Game attendance of
76,780 was the largest crowd to

see a football game in the Bay
Area this year.
Mike Cordova finished his
Stanford career as the fifth lead
ing passer in Card history ....
His 140 passing yards against
Cal gave him a four-year total of
3556, just 38 behind former
All-Pro quarterback John Brodie.
Ceresino led all defenders in
the Big Came with 11 unassisted
tackles .... Next was Cal's Burl
Toler with seven.

dings, much less football games.
By winning the Cal game, Stan
ford .ivcrtetMts first losing t>cdsoi. in
13 years. The Cards finished 15)76
6-5 overall and 5-2 in the Pacific-8,
good enough for sole possession of
third place behind USC and UCLA.

Of Stanford's five losses, four were
to teams ranked first, second, third
and 17th nationally at one point in
the season.
Cal's loss dropped its record to
5-6 overall and 3-4 in the Pac-8.
Spectators at Memorial Stadium
saw all the controversies, superb
performances and lousy perfor
mances that have characterized the
last four years of Stanford football
surface in this one game. The 1976
Big Game was the Christiansen-
Mike Cordova-Ron Inge-Tony Hill
years in microcosm.
Up and down
Quarterback Cordova threw some
beautiful passes against Cal, such as
a 29-yard masterpiece to Kellar be
tween a Bear cornerback and safety,

but he also rifled a couple of passes
into the ground and two very un
timely interceptions. He came back
to virtually assure Stanford a tie
with his successful two-point con
version.
Cordova alternated between
being the hero and the goat. Just like
the last four years.
There was Guy Benjamin, re
garded first as a God at Stanford, but
now just as a great passer. Benjamin
completed over 50 per cent of his
passes for big yardage Saturday
(13-25-157). Just like the last three
years. Cordova, by the way. com
pleted under 50 per cent of his pas
ses for big yardage (9-24-140). Just
like the last four years.

— on back in endzone) winning touchdown
There was the Benjamin-
Cordova, Cordova-Benjamin
controversy. Benjamin played
31 minutes against Cal; Cordova
29 minutes. A two-QB system.
Just like the past two years.
Key interception
There was Christiansen's
stubbornness or patience, de
pending on your point of view.
Cordova threw an interception
with five minutes left that easily
could have lost the game. But on
Stanford's next offensive series,
Chris sent him back in. Just like
the last four years.
There was Inge, who was sup
posed to finally give Stanford a
real running threat, but really
didn't. Inge fumbled on Cal's
goal line in the first quarter, but

came back to score the winning
touchdown. Inge: sometimes
blowing it, sometimes showing
his potential. Just like the past
few years.
There was kicker Mike
Michel, who has all the ability
in the world, but little consis
tency. He missed a 45-yard field
goal attempt, a virtual chip shot
for him, in the second quarter,
but took immense pressure off
the defense with some clutch
booming punts. Michel punted
eight times foran average of 43.1
yards, including a 68-yarder.
Michel showed that he is a
strong kicker, but not yet a
polished one. Just like the past
two years.
There was Savann Thompson
getting burned one-on-one for a

touchdown in the second quar
ter. Just like the past two years.
Finally, there was the excel
lence of Tony Hill and Duncan
McColl. Hill caught eight passes
for 117 yards and one TD and
was named the Offensive Player
of the Came.
It's not surprising that it was
McColl who came up with
Crane's fourth-quarter fumble.
He always seems to be around
the ball.
Hill and McColl: outstanding
again.
And there was the game itself.
It was a Big Came in every sense
of the tradition. Perhaps the best
way to describe the level of ex
citement is to say that the game
was worth whatever scalpers
were asking for tickets. Even if
they had been selling them for
$50, at least in retrospect, you
might have wanted to get in on
this one.
Close game
The outcome was in doubt for
all but the last 52 seconds. The
lead changed hands four times.
After Stanford had gone ahead.
27-24, quarterback Joe Roth and
the Bears had the ball on their
own 20 and 1:30 with which to
work. Naturally enough, many
people recalled the scene two
years ago when Benjamin rallied
Stanford to victory in the final 23
seconds.
Cal couldn't pull it off. The
Bears didn't even get a first
down. Stanford, using a three
man rush and an extra defensive
back, held Roth to just one
seven-yard completion.
It didn't help Cal that Bear re
ceiver Jesse Thompson dropped
a perfectly-thrown sideline pass
that would have been good for
about 15 yards. For some reason,
Bear backs and receivers were
dropping passes all day.
Big play
The big play, of course, was
Crane's fumble. "I
just dropped it — I don't know
how," Crane said, crying. "It was

my fault — I cost us the game. If I
hadn't dropped it, they wouldn't
have gotten the touchdown — I
know that."
Cal coach Mike White also al
ternated his quarterbacks. Roth
and Fred Besana, both seniors.
Both threw very well when they
had any time at all, although
their statistics weren't particu
larly impressive because of the
dropped passes. Roth completed
11 of 27 passes for 100 yards and
Besana was six of 11 for 74 yards.

So that's it. No more Roth or
Besana for Cal. No more Hill,
McColl, Inge, Michel, Cordova,
Christiansen et. al. for Stanford.
But those searching for some
continuity in next year's team
need not fret too much.
"I'll be back," Benjamin said.
Cardinal Notes: Hill's eight
catches for 117 yards moved him
to second on the all-time Pac-8
receptions and yardage lists ....
He finished behind Washington
State's Hugh Campbell in both

categories .... Hill's final career
totals read 140 catches for 2225
yards and 18 touchdowns.
Christiansen may not be the
only man to have coached his
last Pac-8 game Saturday
It's rumored that Oregon head
coach Don Read's dismissal is
imminent .... The Ducks won
their first league game Saturday
over Oregon State, 23-14, after
being down 14-0 at the half.
The Big Game attendance of
76,780 was the largest crowd to

see a football game in the Bay
Area this year.
Mike Cordova finished his
Stanford career as the fifth lead
ing passer in Card history ....
His 140 passing yards against
Cal gave him a four-year total of
3556, just 38 behind former
All-Pro quarterback John Brodie.
Ceresino led all defenders in
the Big Came with 11 unassisted
tackles .... Next was Cal's Burl
Toler with seven.

Stanford wins comedy of errors
but firing casts pall over game

Berkeley — Only very rarely,
maybe once every few years, does
football really transcend the realm
of fun and games.
Saturday afternoon at Memorial
Stadium was one such occasion.
Such a conclusion is inescapable
if you saw Jack Christiansen weep
as his players carried him on their
shoulders across the field after they
upset Cal, 27-24.
It was Christiansen's last game as
Stanford's head coach after having
been officially fired Friday.
Over in the Cal locker room, Bear
halfback Markey Crane was prob
<iblv as sad as Christiansen. A Crane
fumble on Cal's two-yard line with
2:30 left in the game led to Stan

ford's winning touchdown.
Card Duncan McColl recovered
Crane's bobble, which came on a
pitch-out from Cal quarterback Joe
Roth. One minute later, Stanford
senior Ron Inge ran the ball over
from the two to give the Cards a
25-24 lead.
Stanford then went for a two
point conversion, with quarterback
Mike Cordova scoring on a keeper.
Stanford 27, Cal 24.
Huddle
After the game, in the elevator
leading to the dressing room, three
Stanford assistant coaches huddled
in a corner and cried on each other's
shoulders.
"How do you like this?" one of
them said angrily. "We are the only

coaching staff in the country that
has had a winning record the last
five years and then got fired. Maybe
we're the first staff ever to get fired
with a record like this."
Down in Los Angeles Saturday,
USCand UCLA were playing for the
Rose Bowl. But under the clouds in
the Berkeley hills, the stakes
seemed to be much higher. The
Cardinals were playing for "Coach
Chris" in a final gesture of their re
spect and admiration for him.
'Win this game'
As wide receiver Bill kellar said
Friday after hearing Christiansen
announce his firing to the team, "If
we can do anything for him, it's win
this game."
"We're all behind Chris totally,"

said senior linebacker Jeff Barton.
"That's why we carried him on and
off the field. We wanted to let
people know we were behind him. I
think he's a helluva guy. 1 love
him."
The Cards may have been playing
for Christiansen, but memories of
the archrival Bears' 48-15 victory
last year did not hurt their incentive
any either.
It all added up to an emotional
zenith seldom reached at wed
dings, much less football games.

touchdown in the second quar
ter. Just like the past two years.
Finally, there was the excel
lence of Tony Hill and Duncan
McColl. Hill caught eight passes
for 117 yards and one TD and
was named the Offensive Player
of the Came.
It's not surprising that it was
McColl who came up with
Crane's fourth-quarter fumble.
He always seems to be around
the ball.
Hill and McColl: outstanding
again.
And there was the game itself.
It was a Big Came in every sense
of the tradition. Perhaps the best
way to describe the level of ex
citement is to say that the game
was worth whatever scalpers
were asking for tickets. Even if
they had been selling them for
$50, at least in retrospect, you
might have wanted to get in on
this one.
Close game
The outcome was in doubt for
all but the last 52 seconds. The
lead changed hands four times.
After Stanford had gone ahead.
27-24, quarterback Joe Roth and
the Bears had the ball on their
own 20 and 1:30 with which to
work. Naturally enough, many
people recalled the scene two
years ago when Benjamin rallied
Stanford to victory in the final 23
seconds.
Cal couldn't pull it off. The
Bears didn't even get a first
down. Stanford, using a three
man rush and an extra defensive
back, held Roth to just one
seven-yard completion.
It didn't help Cal that Bear re
ceiver Jesse Thompson dropped
a perfectly-thrown sideline pass
that would have been good for
about 15 yards. For some reason,
Bear backs and receivers were
dropping passes all day.
Big play
The big play, of course, was
Crane's fumble. "I
just dropped it — I don't know
how," Crane said, crying. "It was

my fault — I cost us the game. If I
hadn't dropped it, they wouldn't
have gotten the touchdown — I
know that."
Cal coach Mike White also al
ternated his quarterbacks. Roth
and Fred Besana, both seniors.
Both threw very well when they
had any time at all, although
their statistics weren't particu
larly impressive because of the
dropped passes. Roth completed
11 of 27 passes for 100 yards and
Besana was six of 11 for 74 yards.

So that's it. No more Roth or
Besana for Cal. No more Hill,
McColl, Inge, Michel, Cordova,
Christiansen et. al. for Stanford.
But those searching for some
continuity in next year's team
need not fret too much.
"I'll be back," Benjamin said.
Cardinal Notes: Hill's eight
catches for 117 yards moved him
to second on the all-time Pac-8
receptions and yardage lists ....
He finished behind Washington
State's Hugh Campbell in both

categories .... Hill's final career
totals read 140 catches for 2225
yards and 18 touchdowns.
Christiansen may not be the
only man to have coached his
last Pac-8 game Saturday
It's rumored that Oregon head
coach Don Read's dismissal is
imminent .... The Ducks won
their first league game Saturday
over Oregon State, 23-14, after
being down 14-0 at the half.
The Big Game attendance of
76,780 was the largest crowd to

see a football game in the Bay
Area this year.
Mike Cordova finished his
Stanford career as the fifth lead
ing passer in Card history ....
His 140 passing yards against
Cal gave him a four-year total of
3556, just 38 behind former
All-Pro quarterback John Brodie.
Ceresino led all defenders in
the Big Came with 11 unassisted
tackles .... Next was Cal's Burl
Toler with seven.

Stanford wide receiver Bill Kellar just missed catching this Mike
Cordova pass in the end zone in the third quarter Saturday. Jeff
Moye (16) defends.
