# Nuclear experimentation poses threat
## 
### 
As Stanford students, we are exposed to a wide
variety of political and social issues. Ironically,
many of us will never be affected by many of these
problems. However, there is one issue that should
be of genuine concern to all of us, because our lives
may depend upon it. This is the issue regarding
nuclear research and development.
Our government is making use of the great poten
tial of nuclear reactions for generating power. Nuc
lear power is being used in America mainly for two
purposes, weapons and energy research. We have
stumbled into the age of nuclear warfare. Billions of
dollars are spent by, our government %tvch year on
nuclear-powered submarines, missiles, bombs, and
other weapons. According to the Pentagon, con
tinuous production of such deadly devices is
necessary to keep our country safe from foreign
powers.
Nuclear power is also being studied in the hopes
that some day our energy needs can be met with
nuclear energy.
Our nuclear weapons are supposed to keep us
safe from attack, and the reasoning behind this is
interesting, if not absurd. The basic theory behind
nuclear weaponry is known as MAD (Mutual As
sured Destruction). According to this theory, no
nation would ever use nuclear weapons on another
power, because that other power would always
havethe capability of retaliating with nuclearforce.
Thus, we must all maintain enough nuclear
power to destroy the other guy, so any nuclear war
would be fair. All nations involved would be an
nihilated.
Interesting ideas
The Pentagon also has some interesting ideas on
the use of such weapons. One is called "limited
nuclear war." In a limited nuclear war, missiles
would only be launched at other missile sites, de
pots, and other military installations. In this way,
the large cities, and most of the population, would
survive.
The trouble with this theory is that it's very un
likely that all nations would agree to this, and if it
were agreed upon, a nation facing total destruction

in such a war would probably violate the agree
ment. and, as a last resort, blast the other guy's
cities.
The Pentagon came up with another goodie re
cently. They want money for "counterforce" mis
siles. These would be launched at enemy missile
sites, but only as retaliation for an enemy attack.

This is a ridiculous thought at best, because our
counterforce warheads would be destroying a
bunch of empty silos and evacuated installations.
I'll admit I'm no expert on warfare, but I can't see
the point in this.
Another problem that has arisen with the de
velopment of nuclear weapons is that of distribu
tion. More and more nations are acquiring
atomic weapons. One of the most frightening in
stances of this is the case of Israel, which is in a very
tense situation in the Middle East. In December
1974, Israeli President Ephraim katzir announced,
"If we need them, we will have them." He was
referring to nuclear weapons.
Unreasonable goal
As far as using nuclear power to meet our coun
try's energy needs, this .is not a very reasonable
goal. The cost is immense, the energy potential is
very limited, and it's not even known for sure
whether or not nuclear energy can be put to practi
cal, every-day use. Moreover, experimenting with
nuclear reactions can be like playing with matches
in a hydrogen-filled room.
A nuclear explosion in the Soviel IJral Moun
tains in 1958 reportedly killed hundreds of people,

and polluted the immediate environment with
radioactive atomic waste. The danger of nuclear
experimentation is very real, and the consequences
of an accident could be catastrophic.
Plutonium 239, a waste product of nuclear fis
sion, is one of the most dangerous substances
known to man. Its radiation can destroy or alter
living cells, and these effects are irreversible.
Plutonium is so lethal that a handful of it, suffi
ciently dispersed, would destroy all life on earth
except for blue-green algae.
Worse still, the half-life of this element is 24,000
years, so the harmful effects of plutonium would
remain for a quarter of a million years. That's how
long Plutonium 239 must be isolated from the bios
phere in order for it to lose its deadly potential.
Doing us in
These wastes are still being produced, and the
more that's created, the better the chances are of
some leaking out and doing us in.
There are alternatives to nuclear research and
development, though. With increased efficiency,
the world could survive on other sources of energy
which are present on the earth. Still more promis
ing is the concept of solar energy. Power derived
from the sun is safe, clean, and best of all, unli
mited. Cars have been designed that can run on
solar energy and wind-power.
Many homes in America are now heated by solar
energy. According to engineers, it would be very
possible to convert our nuclear research industry to
one that deals with solar energy. In 22 days, the
earth receives as much solar energy as the equiva
lent of all the energy stored in all of our fossil fuels
since the beginning of history. I'm not suggesting
that we try to capture and use all of this energy, but
the potential is there.
Clearly, experimentation with nuclear energy
poses a very real and potent threat to all of us.
Unless scientists find a way to transform all of us
into blue-gree algae, I suggest we look twice at our
increasing reliance on nuclear power. We've only
got one earth, so let's try to keep it.
