# Letters: tenure forum, Social Security

### 
SIT forum
It is both encouraging and exciting
to see rising student interest in faculty
appointments and promotions deci
sions, an issue that directly affects the
quality of education at Stanford, but
also one which has traditionally dis
couraged student input. Recent tenure
decisions have caused students to
question the apparent unimportance
of teaching quality (as opposed to re
search quality) in evaluating a candi
date for promotion.
It has also been contended that stu
dents are not fully qualified to com
ment on teaching quality: arguments
are often heard concerning the in
applicability of the ASSU Course
Guide to various classes or the inabil
ity of students to fairly evaluate their
professors.
Although I would strongly disagree
with all of these contentions, students
should be aware that some faculty and
administrations may view student
input in such a light. Thus, it is in the
students' interest to organize them
selves as best as they can to insure that
their voice is heard on the tenure issue
and other relevant issues.
One of the most effective and useful
means of student input is in the form of
graduate and undergraduate associa
tions. A strong student association can
provide input at the department level
as to which courses should be taught,
the optimal allocation of the de
partmental budget, and the teaching
quality of the TA's and the faculty.

Moreover, such an association
should encourage greater student in
teraction with the faculty in the de
partment. Students should promote a
lively and vigorous exchange of ideas
within the department, encouraging
both students and faculty to air their
views. For example, the Political Sci
ence Dept. recently held a discussion
between students and faculty to con
sider the question, "Is the United
States the best country in the world?:
criteria for evaluating a political sys
tem."
Stanford advertises itself as a resi
dential college, but in fact, the interac
tion between faculty and students in
the dormitories has often been lacking.
It is students who must take the initia
tive in promoting greater discussion
between students and faculty in the
departments.
The result of such planning and or
ganization would be twofold: first, fa
culty and students would add to both
of their educational experiences
through a serious discussion of
academic issues, and second, students
and faculty might view each other
with greater interest, respect and
knowledge.
This latter result would be particu
larly helpful for those students who
are concerned that their voice be heard
in tenure, budget, and other policy
deicisions within the various
academic departments.
A forum on tenure and the quality of
education at Stanford will be held on

Nov. 23 in the large lounge in Tresid
der at 8:00 p.m. to discuss the tenure
issue as well as the possible formation
of such associations. All those in
terested are strongly encouraged to at
tend, especially those underclassmen
who are interested in facilitating in
teraction between departmental fa
culty and students.

Keep Social Security
Rick Fearon's call for the aboli
tion of Social Security (Daily, Nov.
10) as a solution to its spiraling costs in
present taxes exhibits a lack of aware
ness that is truly astonishing.
He calls Social Security a "totally
unjustified intrusion of the govern
ment into the private citizen's do
main." "merely a perverse welfare sys
tem," strikes out against all programs
involving income transfers, including
unemployment benefits, welfare and
Medicaid and uses a strategy often
used now and in the past to attack
child labor laws, industrial safety reg
ulations. workmen's compensation,
state employment offices, etc.
The same logic can be used against
governmental support of such things
as G.I. benefits, state education, pri
vate education (could he really buy his
way through Stanford, paying the ac
tual costs?), farm subsidies, and big
business subsidy â€”remember Lock
heed ?

The problems confronted by indi
viduals in relation to work such as
safety, unemployment and security in
retirement are not problems within the
private domain but are inextricably in
tertwined with the economic and so
cial functioning of our society.
The problems are public; solutions
must come from the public sphere.
Fearon attacks the social responsi
bility of a society toward its workers
and elderly with the blindness of one
already assured of a financially secure
future and retirement, unaware of
those who are not, ignorant of the so
cial history of SSI and other legislation
for the protection and security of
everyone.
Let's remind ourselves of what our
grandparents faced before the social
legislation that he takes for granted,
such as 40 hour work weeks, minimum
wage, social securitv etc.
Let's not forget the current struggles
to obtain such work safety and security
such as those of the domestic workers
and farm workers.
To Fearon the Social Security tax is
"especially irksome when one reflects
on where the money is going." It is
appalling that this reflection does not
rather lead him to consider those who
can no longer work and are totally de
pendent on SSL some of whom face
life-threatening crises when their
checks are late.
