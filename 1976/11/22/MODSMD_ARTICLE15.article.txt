# Clark urges experiencing Asia
## 
### John Strand 
"VoJunteers-in-Asia (VIA) is
Dwight Clark. It is an expression
of his personality and personal
philosophy ... It was horn of
Divight, and is sustained by his
energy ..."
-Ron Herring, associate director
of the Center
for Research in International
Studies
From a basement corner of the
Stanford Women's Clubhouse,
the rhythmic staccato of a lone
typewriter transcends the bustle
of the Volunteers-in-Asia (VIA)
office. A small man huddles over
the keys composing the final en
couraging stanza of a letter to a
Sulawesi, Indonesia, volunteer.
Despite the vibrant activity,
the room is modest and orderly.
The serenity of a long Chinese
scroll painting graces one wall,
while several photos of volun
teer volleyball games and street
urchins in Hong Kong lend a
warm and personal touch. The
assorted chairs spread through
out the room indicate this is a
place of human contact and in
teraction as well as the nerve
center of the VIA prog
ram. Dwight Clark hops up
from the typewriter, looking like
a turbo-charged Walter Mitty.
His eyes twindle through horn
rimmed glasses as he tucks the
letter into a vacant niche on his
desk. Plucking two apples from a
cardboard box, he leads the way
to the door. "We can talk out
side," he says.
Modest beginning
The Volunteers-in-Asia prog
ram began on a modest note in
1963. Dwight, then dean of
freshman men, and some resi
dents of Wilbur Hall answered
an advertisement for summer
English instructors in Hong
Kong.
Dwight laughs, recalling the
eagerness of that first group.
"We went into it cold, com
pletely unaware of what we were
facing . . . But one common feel
ing brought back was that this
opportunity to experience life in
another culture should remain
open for others."
However, VIA continued to be
just a summer program for two
more years. Dwight was at that
time assistant dean of men and
encountering some difficulty in
completing his Ph.D. in Educa
tion.
Why?'
"After searching for my third
dissertation advisor, I began to
ask myself. 'Why am I doing
this?' I finally had toadmit it was
an ego thing, a desire to be rec
ognized as a peer in the
academic community ... So I
dropped my dissertation to de
vote my full energies to VIA at a

time when it was crucial if the
program was to ever get off the
ground."
Since those initial years, the
VIA assignments have expanded
considerably. Volunteers now
work in Indonesia, Japan, the
Philippines, Korea, and Taiwan.
While most continue to work as
English intructors, others have
become involved in village
technology, environmental im
pact studies, music education
and folklore editing. Under
graduates can participate in six
and twelve-month assignments,
recent graduates in two-year as
signments.
Dwight remains the main
coordinator of the VIA program,
which draws volunteers from
Stanford, UC-Santa Cruz and the
Claremcnt Colleges. In addition
to recruitment, Dwight main
tains a web of personal contacts
throughout Asia with visits dur
ing the year.
Major fundraiser
He is also the major fun
draiser, a role he accepts with
reluctance. Of the $83,000 in
VlA's 1977 budget, $11,500 is
expected to be provided by indi
viduals and family foundations.
Over half ($46,000) of VlA's an
ticipated 1977 revenues will be
self-generated, mainly from the
publication of books and pam
phlets on the Asian experience
compiled by former volunteers.
The tenuous financial situa
tion is not the only difficulty VIA
must endure. There is always the
problem of bridging the cultural
gap
"The mix of modern Ameri
can, sometimes counter-culture,
youth and the traditional Asian
environment is a difficult one,"
says Dwight. "It requires a great
deal of time finding the right
people for the right post."
Ron Herring teaches one of the
VIA training courses, Introduc
tion to Teaching and Learning in
Asia. Over the past four years he
has acted as an informal liaison
between VIA and the university.
Herring says he feels VIA is an
exceptional opportunity.
'Asian context'
"It's one of the few oppor
tunities a Westerner has to know
what it is to live in an Eastern
culture, to work with the people,
speak their language, feel their
feelings. The volunteer works in
an intimately Asian context, sub
ject to the norms and require
ments of the institutions within
that country."
Herring says the most unique
aspect of VIA is its continuity. It
starts with a thorough training
and orientation program, in
cluding practice-teaching En
glish in the Stanford area. Then

the volunteer works in a care
fully developed assignment
overseas. Upon returning, many
volunteers work with the VIA of
fice, assisting with recruitment
and volunteer training. Some
volunteers contribute to future
program design.
Buzz Thompson, a former
volunteer in Taiwan, is one of
the five full time VIA staffers liv
ing on $275 per month. Buzz
explains that the Asian experi
ence leads to a greater under
standing of the more isolationist
position America is assuming in
the world's eyes.
'Consumption'
"The tremendous consump
tion of this country — six per
cent of the world's population
consuming 40 per cent of its re
sources — is in direct opposition
to any kind of harmonious exis
tence to within the world com
munity."
Still a bachelor, Dwight has
lived in a small house in College
Terrace for 12 of his 42 years.
During that period he has prac
ticed a philosophy of'simple liv
ing' on his VIA salary of just over
$3,000 per year. He says, "One of
the most liberating discoveries
of my life has been that I can live
happily at low cost. When one
comes to this realization, one's
range of vocational choice ex
pands tremendously and at the
same time includes a lot of
things that most need doing."

Herring praises this
philosophy of the VIA members.
"VIA exists because a lot of
people hold what they are doing
to be more important than how
materially they live."
Communal spirit
Bob Wenzlau, a Stanford
junior interested in the VIA
program, says he feels that there
is not such a sacrifice involved
in the "simple living"philosophy
as there is a communal spirit
among its participants.
He says that upon visiting the
VIA offices or the Friday lunches
(ramens), "the warmth and
openness of the entire staff gen
erates in you the desire to return.
They're existing for you. You
find yourself responding to their
warmth."
Dwight leans over his cold tea
and tries to assess the impor
tance of the organization that has
been his life for the past 12 years.
"Our lifetimes are going to be
determined much more by what
happens in the non-Western de
veloping world than in the Un
ited States and Europe. If we are
to have a sense of the world and
mankind as different and larger
than our own consumptive Dis
neyland, we have to find ways to
live with the peoples of other
cultures . . . The test of a prog
ram like ours is its ability to help
bring the patterns-ond policies of
this country into greater reality
with the rest of the world."
