# Who lit the Big Game bonfire? Question goes unanswered
## 
### Randy David 
A citation was issued Friday to
the university by the Bay Area Air
Pollution Board for burning wood
intended for the Big Game bonfire
in an open fire. However, opinions
differ as to whether it was actually
university students that lit the par
tially constructed bonfire structure
early Friday morning.
Dan DeYoung, director of service
operations, received the citation of
an "unauthorized fire on the Stan
ford campus." DeYoung said sev
eral people in the community had
complained to the control board
about the smoke.
DeYoung said he will look into
the matter, explain the situation to
the control board, and assure them
that the university will do every
thing they can to prevent such fires
in the future. "I don't know who lit
it,"he added, "but the university
has responsibility for it because it
was on Stanford land."
The university could be fined a
maximum of $500 if they are found
in violation of the regulation.
Burned materials
Tom Wider, of the pollution con
trol board, said students got rid of
material for the canceled bonfire by
burning it.
Wider had two reasons for assign
ing the blame for t he fire to Stanford
students. "I went to the burn site
and talked with a student there," he
said. Wider would not disclose the
name of the student.
He also said Captain Frank Ju
rian, of the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment, told Wider he was sure the
fire had been set by Stanford stu
dents.
According to one fraternity
member who was at the bonfire late

Thursday night, some fraternity
members wanted to light the bon
fire materials even though the bon
fire had been canceled, while other
fraternity members argued against
torching the materials.
However, former Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) President Bob Ottilie
told a Daily reporter at 2:15 a.m.
Friday that a carload of Cal students
had driven off shortly after the blaze
ignited with their (the fraternities')
beer keg. A few minutes later, Ot
tilie told the reporter that 10 Cal
students had lit the bonfire while he
was attempting to fight them off
with a pick handle, and then they
had run away.
According to the reporter, there
were about seven fraternity mem
bers at the bonfire site at 2:15 a.m.
Cal students
Don Barton, a pledge at Sigma
Chi. claims that the bonfire was
started by Cal students. Barton and
members of the Sigma Chi frater
nity, had begun to build a structure
for the bonfire on Friday night al
though it had been officially can
celed. He said the structure out
lined that morning was 1000 square
feet, and its height had reached
about six feet.
"We hoped to bring it up to 25
feet high. This would be nowhere as
high as in previous years, but once
lit, the bonfire itself would look as
big as before."
A meeting had been set up bet
ween Barton, and Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Dan Williams. IFC
President Jordan Schwartz, bonfire
chairman Ken Resson and another
fraternity member for Friday morn
ing to discuss definite possibilities
of having the bonfire, according to
Barton. The meeting was not held

because the bonfire had already
been lit.
Smaller fire
While the bonfire structure was
being built, other students had lit a
fire about 20 feet away, according to
Barton. "There were about 50 stu
dents sitting around and drinking
beer,"he said. Barton left with
about six people remaining who
told him they would be leaving
soon.
One of the last people to allegedly
leave the site before the bonfire was
ignited was Ottilie. who said he and
fellow student Dave Haugh left the
site with the intention of returning
in about 20 minutes to check on the
small fire ignited by other students.
The last three people to allegedly
leave the site before the materials
were torched were Tom Pederson, a
member of the /eta Psi fraternity,
and two other people. Pedersonsaid
no one remained when he left with
the two people whom he said he did
not think were from Stanford.
He said he had met them that
night at the bonfire site. "We went
to Flo Mo and stayed there until we
came back to the site," he added.
When he arrived at about 2:30 p.m.,
"the bonfire had been lit and there
were eight other people there," he
said. "I have no idea at all who
started the fire," Pederson said.
Car chase
Ottilie had arrived at the site
about 10 minutes before Pederson
at about 2:20, and said the bonfire
was already lit and no one was at
the site. When Pederson and the
two men pulled up to the site, Ot
tilie said Pederson and one of the
persons got out of the car. Pederson
walked over to talk to Ottilie, and

according to Ottilie, one person
jumped in the trunk of the car and
took off with a keg. Ottilie chased
the two in his tar but was unable to
stop them.
Ottilie said "the fire must have
been started when 1 was gone from
the lake." 1 le said he was gone from
about 2 to 2:20 a.m.
Barton had been informed about
the fire by Schwartz. Barton said it
was lit by Cal students because
"only about five of the frats knew
about the effort to build the struc
ture. No one knew about it."
Earlier that night, he said he had
heard students from Cal singing at
Flo Mo. He hypothesized they
could have seen the fraternity
members building the structure and
come later when no one was there,
to ignite the bonfire.
Efforts abandoned
Although members of the Zeta
Psi house were attempting to get
construction of the bonfire site
going early that night, they had
abandoned their efforts later that
night, according to Ottilie. "They
wanted to burn it that night," he
said.
Remson said. "No one knows
who lit the bonfire." He and
Schwartz plan to issue statements
soon concerning the bonfire.
Ottilie and Barton both agreed
the main reason for the cancellation
of the bonfire was the lack of par
ticipation by the fraternities. "Al
though 10 frats supported the bon
fire, only three or four individuals
committed themselves," Ottilie
said. "If the fraternities voted for a
bonfire in October they should
have worked on it in November,"
Barton said.
A citation was issued Friday to
the university by the Bay Area Air

night, according to Ottilie. "They
wanted to burn it that night," he
said.
Remson said. "No one knows
who lit the bonfire." He and
Schwartz plan to issue statements
soon concerning the bonfire.
Ottilie and Barton both agreed
the main reason for the cancellation
of the bonfire was the lack of par
ticipation by the fraternities. "Al
though 10 frats supported the bon
fire, only three or four individuals
committed themselves," Ottilie
said. "If the fraternities voted for a
bonfire in October they should
have worked on it in November,"
Barton said.
A citation was issued Friday to
the university by the Bay Area Air
Pollution Board for burning wood
intended for the Big Game bonfire
in an open fire. However, opinions
differ as to whether it was actually
university students that lit the par
tially constructed bonfire structure
early Friday morning.
Dan DeYoung, director of service
operations, received the citation of
an "unauthorized fire on the Stan
ford campus." DeYoung said sev
eral people in the community had
complained to the control board
about the smoke.
DeYoung said he will look into
the matter, explain the situation to
the control board, and assure them
that the university will do every
thing they can to prevent such fires
in the future. "I don't know who lit
it,"he added, "but the university
has responsibility for it because it
was on Stanford land."
The university could be fined a
maximum of $500 if they are found
in violation of the regulation.
Burned materials
Tom Wider, of the pollution con
trol board, said students got rid of
material for the canceled bonfire by
burning it.
Wider had two reasons for assign
ing the blame for t he fire to Stanford
students. "I went to the burn site
and talked with a student there," he
said. Wider would not disclose the
name of the student.
He also said Captain Frank Ju
rian, of the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment, told Wider he was sure the
fire had been set by Stanford stu
dents.
According to one fraternity
member who was at the bonfire late

Thursday night, some fraternity
members wanted to light the bon
fire materials even though the bon
fire had been canceled, while other
fraternity members argued against
torching the materials.
However, former Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) President Bob Ottilie
told a Daily reporter at 2:15 a.m.
Friday that a carload of Cal students
had driven off shortly after the blaze
ignited with their (the fraternities')
beer keg. A few minutes later, Ot
tilie told the reporter that 10 Cal
students had lit the bonfire while he
was attempting to fight them off
with a pick handle, and then they
had run away.
According to the reporter, there
were about seven fraternity mem
bers at the bonfire site at 2:15 a.m.
Cal students
Don Barton, a pledge at Sigma
Chi. claims that the bonfire was
started by Cal students. Barton and
members of the Sigma Chi frater
nity, had begun to build a structure
for the bonfire on Friday night al
though it had been officially can
celed. He said the structure out
lined that morning was 1000 square
feet, and its height had reached
about six feet.
"We hoped to bring it up to 25
feet high. This would be nowhere as
high as in previous years, but once
lit, the bonfire itself would look as
big as before."
A meeting had been set up bet
ween Barton, and Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Dan Williams. IFC
President Jordan Schwartz, bonfire
chairman Ken Resson and another
fraternity member for Friday morn
ing to discuss definite possibilities
of having the bonfire, according to
Barton. The meeting was not held

because the bonfire had already
been lit.
Smaller fire
While the bonfire structure was
being built, other students had lit a
fire about 20 feet away, according to
Barton. "There were about 50 stu
dents sitting around and drinking
beer,"he said. Barton left with
about six people remaining who
told him they would be leaving
soon.
One of the last people to allegedly
leave the site before the bonfire was
ignited was Ottilie. who said he and
fellow student Dave Haugh left the
site with the intention of returning
in about 20 minutes to check on the
small fire ignited by other students.
The last three people to allegedly
leave the site before the materials
were torched were Tom Pederson, a
member of the /eta Psi fraternity,
and two other people. Pedersonsaid
no one remained when he left with
the two people whom he said he did
not think were from Stanford.
He said he had met them that
night at the bonfire site. "We went
to Flo Mo and stayed there until we
came back to the site," he added.
When he arrived at about 2:30 p.m.,
"the bonfire had been lit and there
were eight other people there," he
said. "I have no idea at all who
started the fire," Pederson said.
Car chase
Ottilie had arrived at the site
about 10 minutes before Pederson
at about 2:20, and said the bonfire
was already lit and no one was at
the site. When Pederson and the
two men pulled up to the site, Ot
tilie said Pederson and one of the
persons got out of the car. Pederson
walked over to talk to Ottilie, and

according to Ottilie, one person
jumped in the trunk of the car and
took off with a keg. Ottilie chased
the two in his tar but was unable to
stop them.
Ottilie said "the fire must have
been started when 1 was gone from
the lake." 1 le said he was gone from
about 2 to 2:20 a.m.
Barton had been informed about
the fire by Schwartz. Barton said it
was lit by Cal students because
"only about five of the frats knew
about the effort to build the struc
ture. No one knew about it."
Earlier that night, he said he had
heard students from Cal singing at
Flo Mo. He hypothesized they
could have seen the fraternity
members building the structure and
come later when no one was there,
to ignite the bonfire.
Efforts abandoned
Although members of the Zeta
Psi house were attempting to get
construction of the bonfire site
going early that night, they had
abandoned their efforts later that
night, according to Ottilie. "They
wanted to burn it that night," he
said.
Remson said. "No one knows

the fire by Schwartz. Barton said it
was lit by Cal students because
"only about five of the frats knew
about the effort to build the struc
ture. No one knew about it."
Earlier that night, he said he had
heard students from Cal singing at
Flo Mo. He hypothesized they
could have seen the fraternity
members building the structure and
come later when no one was there,
to ignite the bonfire.
Efforts abandoned
Although members of the Zeta
Psi house were attempting to get
construction of the bonfire site
going early that night, they had
abandoned their efforts later that
night, according to Ottilie. "They
wanted to burn it that night," he
said.
Remson said. "No one knows
who lit the bonfire." He and
Schwartz plan to issue statements
soon concerning the bonfire.
Ottilie and Barton both agreed
the main reason for the cancellation
of the bonfire was the lack of par
ticipation by the fraternities. "Al
though 10 frats supported the bon
fire, only three or four individuals
committed themselves," Ottilie
said. "If the fraternities voted for a
bonfire in October they should
have worked on it in November,"
Barton said.
A citation was issued Friday to
the university by the Bay Area Air
Pollution Board for burning wood
intended for the Big Game bonfire
in an open fire. However, opinions
differ as to whether it was actually
university students that lit the par
tially constructed bonfire structure
early Friday morning.
Dan DeYoung, director of service
operations, received the citation of
an "unauthorized fire on the Stan
ford campus." DeYoung said sev
eral people in the community had
complained to the control board
about the smoke.
DeYoung said he will look into
the matter, explain the situation to
the control board, and assure them
that the university will do every
thing they can to prevent such fires
in the future. "I don't know who lit
it,"he added, "but the university
has responsibility for it because it
was on Stanford land."
The university could be fined a
maximum of $500 if they are found
in violation of the regulation.
Burned materials
Tom Wider, of the pollution con
trol board, said students got rid of
material for the canceled bonfire by
burning it.
Wider had two reasons for assign
ing the blame for t he fire to Stanford
students. "I went to the burn site
and talked with a student there," he
said. Wider would not disclose the
name of the student.
He also said Captain Frank Ju
rian, of the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment, told Wider he was sure the
fire had been set by Stanford stu
dents.
According to one fraternity
member who was at the bonfire late

Thursday night, some fraternity
members wanted to light the bon
fire materials even though the bon
fire had been canceled, while other
fraternity members argued against
torching the materials.
However, former Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) President Bob Ottilie
told a Daily reporter at 2:15 a.m.
Friday that a carload of Cal students
had driven off shortly after the blaze
ignited with their (the fraternities')
beer keg. A few minutes later, Ot
tilie told the reporter that 10 Cal
students had lit the bonfire while he
was attempting to fight them off
with a pick handle, and then they
had run away.
According to the reporter, there
were about seven fraternity mem
bers at the bonfire site at 2:15 a.m.
Cal students
Don Barton, a pledge at Sigma
Chi. claims that the bonfire was
started by Cal students. Barton and
members of the Sigma Chi frater
nity, had begun to build a structure
for the bonfire on Friday night al
though it had been officially can
celed. He said the structure out
lined that morning was 1000 square
feet, and its height had reached
about six feet.
"We hoped to bring it up to 25
feet high. This would be nowhere as
high as in previous years, but once
lit, the bonfire itself would look as
big as before."
A meeting had been set up bet
ween Barton, and Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Dan Williams. IFC
President Jordan Schwartz, bonfire
chairman Ken Resson and another
fraternity member for Friday morn
ing to discuss definite possibilities
of having the bonfire, according to
Barton. The meeting was not held

because the bonfire had already
been lit.
Smaller fire
While the bonfire structure was
being built, other students had lit a
fire about 20 feet away, according to
Barton. "There were about 50 stu
dents sitting around and drinking
beer,"he said. Barton left with
about six people remaining who
told him they would be leaving
soon.
One of the last people to allegedly
leave the site before the bonfire was
ignited was Ottilie. who said he and
fellow student Dave Haugh left the
site with the intention of returning
in about 20 minutes to check on the
small fire ignited by other students.
The last three people to allegedly
leave the site before the materials
were torched were Tom Pederson, a
member of the /eta Psi fraternity,
and two other people. Pedersonsaid
no one remained when he left with
the two people whom he said he did
not think were from Stanford.
He said he had met them that
night at the bonfire site. "We went
to Flo Mo and stayed there until we
came back to the site," he added.
When he arrived at about 2:30 p.m.,
"the bonfire had been lit and there
were eight other people there," he
said. "I have no idea at all who
started the fire," Pederson said.
Car chase
Ottilie had arrived at the site
about 10 minutes before Pederson
at about 2:20, and said the bonfire
was already lit and no one was at
the site. When Pederson and the
two men pulled up to the site, Ot
tilie said Pederson and one of the
persons got out of the car. Pederson
walked over to talk to Ottilie, and

according to Ottilie, one person
jumped in the trunk of the car and
took off with a keg. Ottilie chased
the two in his tar but was unable to
stop them.
Ottilie said "the fire must have
been started when 1 was gone from
the lake." 1 le said he was gone from
about 2 to 2:20 a.m.
