## 
### 
The Student Center for Inno
vation in Research and Educa
tion (SCIRE) will begin a new
program of internships winter
quarter. Pre-arranged intern
ships will be available for the
first time. Forty-two positions
will be open, most of them with
local agencies for community
service, said Janet Shaver. SCIRE
student co-director.
The SCIRE policy board re
commended that pre-arranged
internships be offered on a trial
basis after four students de
signed theirown internships last
spring. David Weckler, a
graduate student in psychology,
was hired to develop about 25
intern positions, but found more
because of the eagerness of
community agencies to work
with university students, Shaver
said.
Opportunities will be open in
the fields of education, ecology,
public relations, community or
ganizing. community para-legal,
government, NASA-Ames, and
clinical counseling.
Specific internships include
working as an entry-level city

planner in Palo Alto, developing
a circulation model of the at
mosphere of Venus, counseling
adolescents at an inter-racial re
sidential treatment program
center.
SCIRE internships were
created to help students integ
rate classroom theory with prac
tical experience in the commun
ity, said Marie Chacon, a co
director of SCIRE. Fifteen to 25
hour of actual field work are re
quired, supplemented by two
courses. One course provides in
formation on issues to be con
fronted on the job (3-5 units) and
the other supplies appropriate
methodological skills such as in
terviewing or community or
ganizing (1-5 units) said Chacon.
Chacon said she feared many
students would not be able to in
tern because the required time
commitments conflicted with
other classes and projects. To
make the program more flexible,
it is posssible for students to re
late courses taken no earlier than
last spring quarter to the field
work, she said.
