## 
### Pan Demetrakakes Staff writer 
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance Robert Augsburger, the man
who has held the university's purse
strings for five years, announced last
week his intention to leave the univer
sity by June.

In a letter to President Richard Ly- r
man, Augsburger stated, "The chal- s
lenges at Stanford during most of the 1
past decade have . . . been heavily fi
nancial and administrative. Those of c
the next decade are much more likely t
to be primarily academic in nature, i
Quite understandably, there is little t
r

room for a businessman, such as my
self. to deal with the latter type of chal
lenge."
Augsburger's achievements include
organization of the Campaign for Stan
ford, the fund drive which raised
money for recent university construc
tion projects; helping organize the cur
rent renovation of the Stanford Shop
ping Center; and helping originate the
California Educational Facilities Au
thority, which provides tax-free loans
to private educational institutions.
Augsburger was at the center of a
controversy involving the proposed
expansion of Willow Road during his
stay here. A number of community
groups in Palo Alto were opposed to
widening the roadway which adjoins
the Stanford Shopping Center. The
battle between university officials and
the citizens has been waged off and on
for the past three years.
Lyman said the search for Au
gsburger's successor has not yet be
gun. "1 intend to think about the situa
tion and the whole structure before be
ginning the search." he said.
Comprehensive management
Lvman expressed approval of Au
gsburger's performance. "He's played
a part in making the management of
this place a lot more comprehensible,"
he said.
Roger Hardy, president of the Un
ited Stanford Employees union, asses
sed Augsburger's performance diffe
rently.
"He handled finances the way the
university and the trustees wanted
him to — he puts buildings ahead of
people," Hardy said. "He was con
cerned with a show of material things
at the expense of good labor relations."
Heritage of expense
One of Augsburger's accomplish
ments was increasing the funds avail
ablefor the physical plant. With regard
to this. Hardy said, "The university
has bought a heritage of an expensive
physical plant, and 1 don't think they
can uphold it."
Hardy also said, "We've been pre
dicting (Augsburger's resignation) for
a long time." He mentioned the cost
overrun on the new wing of the Medi
cal Center as a possible factor in the
resignation.
However. Lyman denied that the
cost overrun had anything to do with
Augsburger's resignation.
Augsburger joined the university in
April 1971, after having served as
executive vice-president of
Donaldson. Lufkin & Jenrette, a New
York investment bankinc firm.

money for recent university construc

Augsburger was at the center of a
controversy involving the proposed
expansion of Willow Road during his
stay here. A number of community
groups in Palo Alto were opposed to

for the past three years.
Lyman said the search for Au
gsburger's successor has not yet be
gun. "1 intend to think about the situa
tion and the whole structure before be
ginning the search." he said.
Comprehensive management
Lvman expressed approval of Au
gsburger's performance. "He's played
a part in making the management of
this place a lot more comprehensible,"
he said.
Roger Hardy, president of the Un
ited Stanford Employees union, asses
sed Augsburger's performance diffe
rently.
"He handled finances the way the
university and the trustees wanted
him to — he puts buildings ahead of
people," Hardy said. "He was con
cerned with a show of material things
at the expense of good labor relations."
Heritage of expense
One of Augsburger's accomplish
ments was increasing the funds avail
ablefor the physical plant. With regard
to this. Hardy said, "The university
has bought a heritage of an expensive
physical plant, and 1 don't think they
can uphold it."
Hardy also said, "We've been pre
dicting (Augsburger's resignation) for
a long time." He mentioned the cost
overrun on the new wing of the Medi
cal Center as a possible factor in the
resignation.
However. Lyman denied that the
cost overrun had anything to do with
Augsburger's resignation.

April 1971, after having served as
executive vice-president of
Donaldson. Lufkin & Jenrette, a New
York investment bankinc firm.
