# Brown's neighbors complain about rent
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — The State is facing a rent strike by some of
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s neighbors, unhappy about living condi
tions and a rent increase in their state-owned apartments.
I'he state owns about 600 apartment units within a few blocks of
the Capitol, including the two Brown rents in preference to living
in the recently completed, vacant governor's mansion.
Most of the buildings are rundown and diite from before World
War 11. The tenants are mostly low-income, elderly, or state
employes.
Rents in the apartments have been frozen for 18 months, but
recently increases of 10 per cent, and more in some cases, were
announced for 116 units, and more are expected.
Hut some residents say the state does little maintenance any way
About 20 have refused to pay the increases so far, and members of
the Capitol Park Renters say another 40 to 50 have promised to
boycott later increases.
"It's not worth it," maintained Janice Hughes, who said the rent
for her one-room apartment was raised from $65 to $90 a month.
"To sit in one of these dingy damn rooms with bugs crawling
over you is a real drag," she said.
GSA deputy director Greg Lipscomb agreed that maintenance
has been poor, but said the state has put $1.5 million into the
buildings in the last two years and collected only $893. 000 in rent.
