# Report links microwaves with nervous disorders
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€”A newly
declassified U.S. Defense Intel
ligence Agency report says ex
tensive Soviet research into mic
rowaves might lead to methods
of causing disoriented human
behavior, nerve disorders or
even heart attacks.
"Soviet scientists are fully
aware of the biological effects of
low-level microwave radiation
which might have offensive
weapons application," says the
report, based on an analysis of
experiments conducted in the
Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe.
According to the study, this
research work suggests "the po
tential for the development of a
number of antipersonnel appli
cations."
Microwave beams are the elec
tronic basis of radar and are
widely used for relaying long
distance telephone calls. Other
common sources of microwaves
include television transmitters.
A copy of the study was pro
vided by the agency to the As
sociated Press in response to a
request under the Freedom of In
formation Act. The Pentagon
agency refused to release some
portions of the study, saying
they remain classified on na
tional security grounds.
The report made no direct
mention of the Soviet mic
rowave bombardment of the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow, where de
spite strong American protests
the radiation continues, though
at reduced levels.
Up to now, the view most
widely accepted among State
Department officials in
Washington has been that the
soviets appear to be using the
microwave beams to foil sophis
ticated U.S. electronic
intel ligence-gatheri ng equip
ment at the embassy.
The State Department issued
an administrative notice on Nov.
12 declaring Moscow "an un
healthful post," but no link was
officially drawn between this
move and the radiation situa
tion.
The Soviets have denied
beaming any radiation at the
embassy, contending that the
microwaves are simply part of

the normal background radia
tion found in any major city.
The Pentagon agency's report,
distributed within the govern
ment last March, said that one
biological effect which could
offer antipersonnel uses is the
phenomenon known as "mic
rowave hearing."
"Sounds and possibly even
words which appear to be
originating intracranially within
the head can be induced by sig
nal modulation at very low aver
age power densities," the study
said.
The report concluded that
Soviet research in this area "has

great potential for development
into a system for disorienting or
disrupting the behavior patterns
of military or diplomatic per
sonnel; it could be used equally
as well as an interrogation tool."
The report said that along with
microwave hearing, the Soviets
have also studied various
changes in body chemistry and
functioning of the brain result
ing from exposure to mic
rowaves and other frequencies of
electromagnetic radiation.
"One physiological effect
which has been demonstrated is
heart seizure," the report said.
