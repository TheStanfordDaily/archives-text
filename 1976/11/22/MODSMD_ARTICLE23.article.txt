By the Associated Press
Look carefully the next time
you see a painting or a statue on a
new public building. You may
have paid for it.
An Associated Press survey
shows a small, but steadily
growing number of states and
cities are passing laws requiring
that a tiny part of the cost of
taxpayer-financial public build
ings be set aside to provide orig
inal art.
The National Council of State
Legislatures reports that so
called "Per Cent for Art" laws
have been introduced or are in
preparation in 30 states. The
council says Alaska. Hawaii,
California, Oregon. nd
Washington already have passed
such measures, as have 17cities.
The idea is nothing new. The
Works Progress Administration
of the Depression spent $11 mill
ion between 1935 and 1943, part
of it on art works created for pub
lic buildingsby jobless sculptors
and painters. That program,
however, was designed primar
ily as an employment measure.

The "Per Cent for Art" plans
have a cultural aim.
Although the trend seems
strongest in the West, it actually
started in the East. Brennan
Rash, information director of the
Western States Art Foundation,
said Philadelphia passed a law
providing art in publicbuildings
13 yea is ago.
Hawaii enacted legislation in
1987 requiring that one per cent
of the cost of any new state build
ing be set aside for works of art.
The budget is worked out by the
state comptroller and the state
Foundation on the Arts and Cul
ture decides how the money
should be spent.
Alfred I'reis, executive direc
tor of the foundation, said the
law has cost the state about $3
mil lion so far and has resulted in
sculptures, murals and stained
glass windows. Me said prefer
ence in awarding commissions
is given to local residents and
added that efforts are made to
place the art in outside locations
so it can be seen by as many
people as possible.
