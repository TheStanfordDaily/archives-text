# 'One of a kind'
## Christiansen slips away quietly 
### Chris Baker 
Berkeley — Darkness had
descended upon Strawberry Ca
nyon, like the fog which hid
"cheapskate hill" during most of
the 79th Big Game, as the large,
ruddy-faced man, dressed in a
red blazer, slipped quietly from
the Stanford locker room inCal's
Memorial Stadium.

Jack Christiansen shook a few
hands and then blended into the
crowd. Chris didn't hold his
usual press conference.
Christiansen, who was praised
because he didn't coach like
Woody Hayes, decided before
the game that he would not
speak to reporters afterward.
His 27-24 Big Game victory

didn't change that and it didn't
change Joe Ruetz' mind.
Christiansen's exit was quite
unlike his entrance into Memo
rial Stadium only three and
one-half hours before.
Behind Chris
The Cardinals wanted to show
that they were behind Christian
sen, who finished his Stanford
career with a record of 30-22-3
and no losing seasons in five
years here, so they carried him
onto the field, as the band played
"All Right Now."
The Cardnals came out fired
up and for once, this season, they
left the field that way. Christian
sen with his fist clinched high in

the air, got a victory ride from his
players after the game when they
brought the Axe over to the Stan
ford side of the field.
"This game the players were
playing just for him," said
flanker Tony Hill, who was
voted Offensive Player of the
79th Big Game. "I feel extremely
sorry for him and what hap
pened. He catered to too many
people and maybe that was his
problem.
'Honest'
"He was honest with the
players. When he recruited he
always told you where you
stood. It wasn't like at USC or
UCLA, where they would go out

and recruit more guys than they
could use and tell you that you'd
have to make it as a walk-on.
"He can't recruit as many
athletes as schools like Michi
gan, IISC and UCLA can. Yet we
play them — Michigan was
ranked No. 1 when we played
them (The wire services ranked
Michigan second before ihe
Stanford game) and USC and
UCLA are two and three.
"I don't think they can ever get
a coach here who can take the
abuse coach Chris took.
"It's too bad what happened,"
said Hill. "He's one of a kind."
