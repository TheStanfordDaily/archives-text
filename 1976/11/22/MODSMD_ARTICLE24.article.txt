# 'One of a kind'
## Christiansen slips away quietly 
### Chris Baker 
Berkeley — Darkness had
descended upon Strawberry Ca
nyon, like the fog which hid
"cheapskate hill" during most of
the 79th Big Game, as the large,
ruddy-faced man, dressed in a
red blazer, slipped quietly from
the Stanford locker room inCal's
Memorial Stadium.

Jack Christiansen shook a few
hands and then blended into the
crowd. Chris didn't hold his
usual press conference.
Christiansen, who was praised
because he didn't coach like
Woody Hayes, decided before
the game that he would not
speak to reporters afterward.
His 27-24 Big Game victory

didn't change that and it didn't
change Joe Ruetz' mind.
Christiansen's exit was quite
unlike his entrance into Memo
rial Stadium only three and
one-half hours before.
Behind Chris
The Cardinals wanted to show
that they were behind Christian
sen, who finished his Stanford
career with a record of 30-22-3
and no losing seasons in five
years here, so they carried him
onto the field, as the band played
"All Right Now."
The Cardnals came out fired
up and for once, this season, they
left the field that way. Christian
sen with his fist clinched high in

the air, got a victory ride from his
players after the game when they
brought the Axe over to the Stan
ford side of the field.
"This game the players were
playing just for him," said
flanker Tony Hill, who was
voted Offensive Player of the
79th Big Game. "I feel extremely
sorry for him and what hap
pened. He catered to too many
people and maybe that was his
problem.
'Honest'
"He was honest with the
players. When he recruited he
always told you where you
stood. It wasn't like at USC or
UCLA, where they would go out

and recruit more guys than they
could use and tell you that you'd
have to make it as a walk-on.
"He can't recruit as many
athletes as schools like Michi
gan, IISC and UCLA can. Yet we
play them — Michigan was
ranked No. 1 when we played
them (The wire services ranked
Michigan second before ihe
Stanford game) and USC and
UCLA are two and three.
"I don't think they can ever get
a coach here who can take the
abuse coach Chris took.
"It's too bad what happened,"
said Hill. "He's one of a kind."

Friday's practice looked like
an Irish wake, according to some
players. "It was probably the
most emotional moment of my
life." said quarterback Mike
Cordova, who didn't know how
much he was going to play
against Cal.
"And this has been the most
emotional game I've ever been
in. 1 le's been a friend of us all."
For Cordova, it was a nice end
ing to four years of frustration.

"I think psychologically it was
rough," said the senior quarter
back of his Stanford career. "I
was cast as the villain — the bad
guy. I had never had people bo
oing me. This year we kind of got
around it."
The search for a new coach
will begin immediately, but he
will probably still have the same
handicaps as Christiansen. "At
schools like USC, 80 per cent of
the players are going to the pros.
At Stanford they're going to be
lawyers and doctors," said Hill.
"1 knew when I came to Stan
ford that it was academics first
and football second. He (Christ
iansen) was the major reason 1
came here."
Senior fullback Donny
Stevenson choked up after it was
over. "We were all in this to
gether. We knew that coach
Chris was in it for us. He was a
factor in our excitement."
Christiansen has been called
"a players' coach" and after his
final game as Stanford head
coach the Cardinals voiced those
statements.
"We wanted the whole
stadium to know that we were
behind him," said McColl of
Christiansen's grand entrance
into Memorial Stadium. "He
doesn't coach for his job, he
coaches for us."
The Cardinals' minds are
made up — they "love" Jack
Christiansen, as Duncan McColl
put it.

"We wanted the whole
stadium to know that we were
behind him," said McColl of
Christiansen's grand entrance
into Memorial Stadium. "He
doesn't coach for his job, he
coaches for us."
The Cardinals' minds are
made up — they "love" Jack
Christiansen, as Duncan McColl
put it.
But Ruetz' mind is made up,
Berkeley — Darkness had
descended upon Strawberry Ca
nyon, like the fog which hid
"cheapskate hill" during most of
the 79th Big Game, as the large,
ruddy-faced man, dressed in a
red blazer, slipped quietly from
the Stanford locker room inCal's
Memorial Stadium.

Jack Christiansen shook a few
hands and then blended into the
crowd. Chris didn't hold his
usual press conference.
Christiansen, who was praised
because he didn't coach like
Woody Hayes, decided before
the game that he would not
speak to reporters afterward.
His 27-24 Big Game victory

didn't change that and it didn't
change Joe Ruetz' mind.
Christiansen's exit was quite
unlike his entrance into Memo
rial Stadium only three and
one-half hours before.
Behind Chris
The Cardinals wanted to show
that they were behind Christian
sen, who finished his Stanford
career with a record of 30-22-3
and no losing seasons in five
years here, so they carried him
onto the field, as the band played
"All Right Now."
The Cardnals came out fired
up and for once, this season, they
left the field that way. Christian
sen with his fist clinched high in

the air, got a victory ride from his
players after the game when they
brought the Axe over to the Stan
ford side of the field.
"This game the players were
playing just for him," said
flanker Tony Hill, who was
voted Offensive Player of the
79th Big Game. "I feel extremely
sorry for him and what hap
pened. He catered to too many
people and maybe that was his
problem.
'Honest'
"He was honest with the
players. When he recruited he
always told you where you
stood. It wasn't like at USC or
UCLA, where they would go out

and recruit more guys than they
could use and tell you that you'd
have to make it as a walk-on.
"He can't recruit as many
athletes as schools like Michi
gan, IISC and UCLA can. Yet we
play them — Michigan was
ranked No. 1 when we played
them (The wire services ranked
Michigan second before ihe
Stanford game) and USC and
UCLA are two and three.
"I don't think they can ever get
a coach here who can take the
abuse coach Chris took.
"It's too bad what happened,"
said Hill. "He's one of a kind."

Friday's practice looked like
an Irish wake, according to some
players. "It was probably the
most emotional moment of my
life." said quarterback Mike
Cordova, who didn't know how
much he was going to play
against Cal.
"And this has been the most
emotional game I've ever been
in. 1 le's been a friend of us all."
For Cordova, it was a nice end
ing to four years of frustration.

"I think psychologically it was
rough," said the senior quarter
back of his Stanford career. "I
was cast as the villain — the bad
guy. I had never had people bo
oing me. This year we kind of got
around it."
The search for a new coach
will begin immediately, but he
will probably still have the same
handicaps as Christiansen. "At
schools like USC, 80 per cent of
the players are going to the pros.
At Stanford they're going to be
lawyers and doctors," said Hill.
"1 knew when I came to Stan
ford that it was academics first
and football second. He (Christ
iansen) was the major reason 1
came here."
Senior fullback Donny
Stevenson choked up after it was
over. "We were all in this to
gether. We knew that coach
Chris was in it for us. He was a
