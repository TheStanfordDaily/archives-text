# Rose Bowl roundup
## USC defense stops UCLA 
### Marko Fong 
It was billed as the irresistible force
against the irresistible force. Crosstown ri
vals UCLA and USC were ranked second
and third in the nation, respectively. Each
team had piled up single game point totals
which rivaled Oregon State's offensive out
put for the last five years.
USC relied on simple athletic ability.
Ricky Bell was harder to tackle than the
Pope in the Vatican. Shelton Diggs. Randy
Simmrin and Charles White were harder to
catch than one of Vince Evans' short passes,
and Evans had an arm stronger than the
National Rifle Association lobby.
UCLA's offense was guileful. |effy
Dankworth handled the football like the
Magnificent Randy handled a rabbit and a
top hat. Theotis Rrown and Wendell Tyler,
who often would receive Dankworth's
pitches, had feet faster than Hubert Hum
phrey's mouth.
Defensive game
When the two juggernauts finally met to
decide which would represent the Pacific-8
in the Rose Bowl and which would go to the
Liberty Bowl, the defenses controlled the
game. UCLA's travelling circus did not
score a touchdown until late in the fourth

quarter. USC's only TD before the fourth
quarter came on a freakish fumble which
free safety Dennis Thurman had caught in
mid-air and returned for a 47-yard
touchdown.
In the fourth quarter, with the USC de
fense leading Oscar Edwards (Doctor Death)
and his Samoan towel bearers 10-0, the Tro
jan offense finally got untracked to score
two touchdowns on a Hell one-yard run and
an Evans 36-yard scamper. That put the
game out of reach at 24-0.
UCLA came back gamely with two
touchdowns in the last six minutes with two
Frank Corral onside kicks actually working.
Bell vs. Tyler
The final score was USC 24, UCLA 14. In
the showdown which wasn't, Ricky Bell
out-gained Wendell Tyler 167 to 52 on 2Va
times as many carries (36-15).
In the Big Ten, Bo Schembechlnr's Michi
gan Wolverines shut out Woody Hayes'
Ohio State Buckeyes 22-0 to win the right to
lose to the Trojans in the Rose Bowl.
In the battle of the just plain rank, Oregon
came from behind on lack Henderson's two
touchdown runs and one touchdown pass
to beat Oregon State, 23-14.
In the Pac-8 Eskimo Bowl between

Washington's Huskies and Washington
State's Cougars, WSU's goodwill defense
proved too much even for its Throwin' Sa
moan, Jack Thompson, the Cougars' quar
terback. Despite Thompson's record-tying
five touchdown passes and despite the fact
that he broke Jim Plunkett's Pac-8 season
passing yardage mark (2791), the Cougars
still lost to Washington. 51-32.
