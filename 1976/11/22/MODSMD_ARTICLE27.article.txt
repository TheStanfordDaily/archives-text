## Too great a legacy 
### Tim W. Ferguson 
Shortly after Gerald Ford was dismissed by
the American electorate, the Wcili Street Journal
headlined a column on his presidency, "In The
End, Decency Wasn't Enough."
Now we can say the same of Jack Christiansen.
On Friday, the man who had worked his way
from orphanhood to athletic stardom at Col
orado State and in the National Football League
lost a head coaching job for the second time.
But the revolving-door world of the pro coach
was a fact of life which could comfort Chris after
his firing by the San Francisco 49ers in 1967. No
such analgesic was available Friday. There was
no place to hide the deep hurt of losing a job to
which this sensitive and stubborn man had
clung so tenaciously.
Consistent
Perhaps it was consistent, if not fitting, that
after a string of seasons which had spared Jack
Christiansen few indignities, he was denied
even the graceful exit reserved for the most
repudiated of leaders.
The jaded sports observer could conclude that
the timing of the announcement made Satur
day's outpouring of player support for the lame
duck coach entirely predictable. But it was, in
fact, the latest and last chapter in a history of
admiration for Chris, the man, from most of the
men who knew him so well.
And few could quibble with their evaluation
— even among a critical press corps whose func
tion Chris has never understood. Always defen
sive of himself, his staff and his players, he har
bored a suspicion of outsiders. But when he
thought a journalist's hindsight was intruding
on his role as coach, he'd say so. Chris has but
one face.
Nightmare
Not that there weren't ever doubts about his
sincerity. Many of them came out of what for
tijjee years has been The Problem: a bevy of
tinted quarterbacks which turned from a rare

blessing into the most horrible nightmare of
Chris' coaching career. Ironically, that career in
cludes a stint as Stanford's quarterback coach,
during 1969-70.
In the end, it may have been Chris' seemingly
incongruous combination of indecision and
stubbornness on the quarterback question which
cost him his job.
But the factors which made.last week's deci
sion unavoidable were more cosmic. In short,
they amounted to this: at a university where
expectations were raised by the glory of back
to-back Rose Bowl wins, Chris' five-year avoi
dance of a losing season just wasn't enough;
John Ralston left his former assistant a legacy
which the latter couldn't live up to.
Going nowhere
Some individuals whose dollars tide the Ath
letic Department through good times and bad
saw a Rose Bowl-caliber team get nowhere close,
saw a football program which seemed to be
going nowhereat all — and demanded a change.
And they weren't alone.
But that's water under the bridge now. A deci
sion, right or wrong, has been made. Let the
recriminations which have wracked Stanford
football for three seasons now cease.
Let us remember Jack Christiansen not only
for his propensities to criticize officials, to react
too strongly to the Bronx cheers of fans ("bas
tards"),and to dodge an occasional question, but
also for the respect and love which so many of
his charges have for him.
Before Saturday's Big Game, Chris told repor
ters that a loss "won't be the end of the world.
The sun will come up again the next day."
Let the sun rise anew, though in different or
bits, for both Jack Christiansen and the Stanford
football program.
