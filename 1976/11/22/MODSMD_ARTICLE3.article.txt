### Elizabeth Pollock Staff writer 
Earlier this year Assoc. Anatomy
Prof. Donald Stilwell wrote an un
known number of medical schools a
letter which may not have been sol
icited. in which he described, in some
times unfavorable terms, approxi
mately 40 pre-meds here, the Daily
learned Friday.
One of the students was made aware
of the letter and went to the Academic
Information Center (AIC), whereupon
the other students affected were
notified of the letter's existence, said

Dean of Undergraduate Studies Herant
Katchadourian.
"The letter somehow got into some
body's hands on our side," and the
students affected have been told the
contents of the sections written about
them, Katchadourian said.
Stilwell could not be reached for
comment.
However, katchadourian explained
that if notified students are concerned
about the evaluation, "All I can say to
the school is that Dr. Stilwell is not a
pre-medical adviser."
Stilwell does sponsor the Stanford
Pre-Medical Society, but Marvin
karasek, associate professor of
biochemistry and dermatology, and
Elizabeth Meyer, assistant director of
the AIC. put together an official
"pre-med advising team," katchadou
rian said.
Stilwell has no official advisees, so
"students who've been going to Dr.
Stilwell for (pre-med) advice are doing
so on their own," katchadourian said.
katchadourian added that resolving
problems caused for students by the
letter will be further complicated be
cause, "we're in no position to confirm <
that (the letter) was unsolicited." i
In any case, James Siena, legal ad
viser to the president, has been con
tacted, and "1 think Mr. Siena has been
taking depositions (sworn tes
timony)," katchadourian said. Siena is
out of town until next week.
John Schwartz, counsel for medical
affairs, said. "I'm not willing to com
ment."
It is not certain whether any legal
action outside the university against
Stilwell will be taken.
"All we are doing at this point is
documenting what we can document
and taking the necessary steps to pro
tect the students involved." katch
adourian said.
Physics Prof. ). Dirk Walecka,
chairman of the faculty advisory
board, which hears disciplinary
c harges against faculty, said, "I don't
know anvthina about it."

notified of the letter's existence, said

Dean of Undergraduate Studies Herant
Katchadourian.
"The letter somehow got into some
body's hands on our side," and the
students affected have been told the
contents of the sections written about
them, Katchadourian said.
Stilwell could not be reached for
comment.
However, katchadourian explained
that if notified students are concerned
about the evaluation, "All I can say to
the school is that Dr. Stilwell is not a
pre-medical adviser."
Stilwell does sponsor the Stanford
Pre-Medical Society, but Marvin
karasek, associate professor of
biochemistry and dermatology, and
Elizabeth Meyer, assistant director of
the AIC. put together an official
"pre-med advising team," katchadou
rian said.
Stilwell has no official advisees, so
"students who've been going to Dr.
Stilwell for (pre-med) advice are doing
so on their own," katchadourian said.
katchadourian added that resolving
problems caused for students by the
letter will be further complicated be
cause, "we're in no position to confirm <
that (the letter) was unsolicited." i
In any case, James Siena, legal ad
viser to the president, has been con
tacted, and "1 think Mr. Siena has been
taking depositions (sworn tes
timony)," katchadourian said. Siena is
out of town until next week.
John Schwartz, counsel for medical
affairs, said. "I'm not willing to com
ment."
It is not certain whether any legal
action outside the university against
Stilwell will be taken.
"All we are doing at this point is
documenting what we can document
and taking the necessary steps to pro
tect the students involved." katch
adourian said.
Physics Prof. ). Dirk Walecka,
chairman of the faculty advisory
board, which hears disciplinary
c harges against faculty, said, "I don't
know anvthina about it."
