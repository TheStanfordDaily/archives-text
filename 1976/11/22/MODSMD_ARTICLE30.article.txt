A 30-yard touchdown pass
from David Georgette to an
aging, but still enthusiastic
Dan Pyne with five minutes
gone in overtime gave the
Stunfurd Daily Thundertur
keysa 13-7 win over the Doily
Californinn Saturday morn
ing.
The victory gave Stanford
possession of the coveted
X-acto knife and saved the job
of coach Chris Baker. Baker
has been under fire from
editor John Freed ever since
theSan Jose State game, when
the Spartans scored a
touchdown with no time on
the clock to tie Stanford, 7-7.
The Thunderturkeys' 13-
point offensive output was its
highest of the season. Baker
said Stanford's awesome at
tack was keyed by Georgette's
ability to "read" defenses.
