# NCAA first seeds
## Poloists survive Cal scare 
### Chris Kamel 
Berkeley—When the Stan
ford varsity water polo team was
introduced by the California an
nouncer as "theNo. 1 team inthe
nation," many Cal fans stood up
and jeered.
Well, even those very skepti
cal fans left Harmon Pools be
lievers that Stanford was
indeed No. 1 after the Cards
had beaten a very emotional Cal
squad, the defending National
Champion, 12-10.
Before a capacity crowd, the
Cards had to hold off numerous
Cal comebacks to insure the first
undefeated Pacific-8 season ever
posted by a Stanford water polo
squad. In fact, the Cards were not
assured of a 6-0 Pac-8 record
until Marty Davis intercepted a
length-of-the-pool pass by Cal's
Jeff Roy with 30 seconds remain
ing in the game.
The win places the Cards as
the topseed in the upcoming
NCAA water polo champion
ships Saturday and Sunday at
Belmont Plaza Pools in Long
Beach. Stanford has a 17-2 sea
son record and a 13-game win
streak that's still standing.
Different story
For the Bears, it's a different
story. It might be the first time in
years that the three-time NCAA
champs will spend their vaca
tion at home.
The Stanford-Cal matchup
was a must win situation for the
Bears, according to Cal coach
Pete Cutino. And Cal's team
came out showing it.
"They were really fired up for
this game," said Lambert. "Beat
ing us would have put them in a
better position to be chosen as an
at-large team."
At press time, the NCAA
committee was still deciding
whether Cal or UC-Santa Barbara
would be the fourth team to join
Stanford, UCLA and UC-Irvine
as west coast representatives.
Early lead
Stanford jumped out to a 7-3
lead in the second period behind
two natural goals (goals scored

not in penalty situations) by
Marty Davis and two others by
Robbie Arnold. Cal, however,
came back late in the first on the
Cards' errant passes and fouls.
The Bears pulled to within two
goals at half, 7-5, on two penalty
throws.
"Our two natural goals were
the difference at half," said
Lambert. "I told them not to
make mistakes because Cal
capitalizes on mistakes and I
didn't want things to start com
ing down on us."
Well, if it started raining on
the Cards before halftime, it re
ally poured on them in the third
period. Three quick Cal scores
after halftime offset a Drew
McDonald penalty throw and
tied it up at 8-8. One of the three
shots was scored when Cal had a
man advantage on offense and
was shooting against McDonald
himself. McDonald was playing

goalie after regular Chris Dorst
had fouled Cal's Mike Loughlin
in attempting to get the ball.
Long arms
"I just have long arms and I felt
it would be best if l were to try
and protect the goal," said
McDonald. "I'd rather be shoot
ing at the goal rather than pro
tecting it, however. I just had a
good day shooting penalties."
McDonald tallied four pen
alty shots for the game along
with another goal. In fact, it was
the senior's penalty throw with
less than a minute to play which
quieted a boisterous Cal crowd.
The fans had gone wild after Cal
freshman Carlos Steffens scored
the Bears' fourth third-period
goal to give them a 9-8 edge only
second earlier.
Well, then came the fourth
quarter and time for one of the
Cards' patented fourth-period

surges. Ii vvas all too common for
the Bears, who, behind only 4-3
going into the last period against
the Cards at Stanford earlier this
season, were blasted out by five
Stanford scores in the 9-3 Card
victory.
Rapid fire
This time, Stanford scored two
goals, by Kick Johannsen and
McDonald, within a minute to
take a 10-9 lead which was never
headed. Stanford finally held on
by trading goals with the Bears
for the victory.
"We were very erratic," said
Lambert. "If we play this way in
the NCAA's, we won't go very
far. We should be a little stronger
in a few days when Chris (Dorst)
is back into action."
Dorst is resting his leg, which
he pulled earlier in the week and
which bothered him during the
Cal game.

the senior's penalty throw with
less than a minute to play which
quieted a boisterous Cal crowd.
The fans had gone wild after Cal
freshman Carlos Steffens scored
the Bears' fourth third-period
goal to give them a 9-8 edge only
second earlier.
Well, then came the fourth
quarter and time for one of the
Cards' patented fourth-period

surges. Ii vvas all too common for
the Bears, who, behind only 4-3
going into the last period against
the Cards at Stanford earlier this
season, were blasted out by five
Stanford scores in the 9-3 Card
victory.
Rapid fire
This time, Stanford scored two
goals, by Kick Johannsen and
McDonald, within a minute to
take a 10-9 lead which was never
headed. Stanford finally held on
by trading goals with the Bears
for the victory.
"We were very erratic," said
Lambert. "If we play this way in
the NCAA's, we won't go very
far. We should be a little stronger
in a few days when Chris (Dorst)
is back into action."
Dorst is resting his leg, which
he pulled earlier in the week and
which bothered him during the
Cal game.

Man on man
Card Rick Johannsen is shown here in action earlier in the season. Johannsen scored a critical
goal Saturday as Stanford defeated California, the defending national champ, 12-10.
Berkeley—When the Stan
ford varsity water polo team was
introduced by the California an
nouncer as "theNo. 1 team inthe
nation," many Cal fans stood up
and jeered.
Well, even those very skepti
cal fans left Harmon Pools be
lievers that Stanford was
indeed No. 1 after the Cards
had beaten a very emotional Cal
squad, the defending National
Champion, 12-10.
Before a capacity crowd, the
Cards had to hold off numerous
Cal comebacks to insure the first
undefeated Pacific-8 season ever
posted by a Stanford water polo
squad. In fact, the Cards were not
assured of a 6-0 Pac-8 record
until Marty Davis intercepted a
length-of-the-pool pass by Cal's
Jeff Roy with 30 seconds remain
ing in the game.
The win places the Cards as
the topseed in the upcoming
NCAA water polo champion
ships Saturday and Sunday at
Belmont Plaza Pools in Long
Beach. Stanford has a 17-2 sea
son record and a 13-game win
streak that's still standing.
Different story
For the Bears, it's a different
story. It might be the first time in
years that the three-time NCAA
champs will spend their vaca
tion at home.
The Stanford-Cal matchup
was a must win situation for the
Bears, according to Cal coach
Pete Cutino. And Cal's team
came out showing it.
"They were really fired up for
this game," said Lambert. "Beat
ing us would have put them in a
better position to be chosen as an
at-large team."
At press time, the NCAA
committee was still deciding
whether Cal or UC-Santa Barbara
would be the fourth team to join
Stanford, UCLA and UC-Irvine
as west coast representatives.
Early lead
Stanford jumped out to a 7-3
lead in the second period behind
two natural goals (goals scored

not in penalty situations) by
Marty Davis and two others by
Robbie Arnold. Cal, however,
came back late in the first on the
Cards' errant passes and fouls.
The Bears pulled to within two
goals at half, 7-5, on two penalty
throws.
"Our two natural goals were
the difference at half," said
Lambert. "I told them not to
make mistakes because Cal
capitalizes on mistakes and I
didn't want things to start com
ing down on us."
Well, if it started raining on
the Cards before halftime, it re
ally poured on them in the third
period. Three quick Cal scores
after halftime offset a Drew
McDonald penalty throw and
tied it up at 8-8. One of the three
shots was scored when Cal had a
man advantage on offense and
was shooting against McDonald
himself. McDonald was playing

goalie after regular Chris Dorst
had fouled Cal's Mike Loughlin
in attempting to get the ball.
Long arms
"I just have long arms and I felt
it would be best if l were to try
and protect the goal," said
McDonald. "I'd rather be shoot
ing at the goal rather than pro
tecting it, however. I just had a
good day shooting penalties."
McDonald tallied four pen
alty shots for the game along
with another goal. In fact, it was
the senior's penalty throw with
less than a minute to play which
quieted a boisterous Cal crowd.

lead in the second period behind
two natural goals (goals scored

not in penalty situations) by
Marty Davis and two others by
Robbie Arnold. Cal, however,
came back late in the first on the
Cards' errant passes and fouls.
The Bears pulled to within two
goals at half, 7-5, on two penalty
throws.
"Our two natural goals were
the difference at half," said
Lambert. "I told them not to
make mistakes because Cal
capitalizes on mistakes and I
didn't want things to start com
ing down on us."
Well, if it started raining on
the Cards before halftime, it re
ally poured on them in the third
period. Three quick Cal scores
after halftime offset a Drew
McDonald penalty throw and
tied it up at 8-8. One of the three
shots was scored when Cal had a
man advantage on offense and
was shooting against McDonald
himself. McDonald was playing

goalie after regular Chris Dorst
had fouled Cal's Mike Loughlin
in attempting to get the ball.
Long arms
"I just have long arms and I felt
it would be best if l were to try
and protect the goal," said
McDonald. "I'd rather be shoot
ing at the goal rather than pro
tecting it, however. I just had a
good day shooting penalties."
McDonald tallied four pen
alty shots for the game along
with another goal. In fact, it was
the senior's penalty throw with
less than a minute to play which
quieted a boisterous Cal crowd.
The fans had gone wild after Cal
freshman Carlos Steffens scored
the Bears' fourth third-period
goal to give them a 9-8 edge only
second earlier.
Well, then came the fourth
quarter and time for one of the
Cards' patented fourth-period

surges. Ii vvas all too common for
the Bears, who, behind only 4-3
going into the last period against
the Cards at Stanford earlier this
season, were blasted out by five
Stanford scores in the 9-3 Card
victory.
Rapid fire
This time, Stanford scored two
goals, by Kick Johannsen and
McDonald, within a minute to
take a 10-9 lead which was never
headed. Stanford finally held on
by trading goals with the Bears
for the victory.
"We were very erratic," said
Lambert. "If we play this way in
the NCAA's, we won't go very
far. We should be a little stronger
in a few days when Chris (Dorst)
is back into action."
Dorst is resting his leg, which
he pulled earlier in the week and
which bothered him during the
Cal game.
