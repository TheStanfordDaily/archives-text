UAW neutrality pledge gets Ist test
Detroit — The unusual neutrality pledge in the
United Auto Workers' new tentative contract with
General Motors is expected to get its first test next
month in a union organizing effort in Louisiana.
One provision in the GM contract is a company
promise to remain neutral in UAW organizing
drives at the firm's new plants in the South. The
UAW had accused GM of having a "southern
strategy" under which it successfully campaigned
against efforts to unionize the plants.
In return for the neutrality pledge, the union
promised in writing to "neither demean the corpo
ration . . . nor its representatives."
UAW Vice President Irving Bluestone said the
neutrality pledge in the tentative contract reached
last Friday was "a bellwether" for all of organized
labor in the United States.
The first test of the pledge is expected when the
National Labor Relations Board is scheduled to set
an election date next month for some 550 GM work
ers at the company's Monroe, La., auto headlight
plant. The election will be to decide whether the
employes want the UAW to represent them.
Syrian troops cheered by Lebanese
Beirut — Massive Syrian armored forces swept
into Sidon and Tripoli yesterday to complete their
occupation of Lebanon on the eve of its indepen
dence day. They were greeted by shouts of joy and
wild shooting into the air.
"It's great," shouted a bearded Lebanese civilian
riding down Tripoli's main avenue on a Syrian
tank. "It's over, it's been bang, bang and death for
almost two years."
Tripoli children, whose city 60 miles north of
Beirut has been besieged bv Christians since sum
mer, clambered over the Syrian tanks and trucks in
a carnival atmosphere. Thousands of rounds of
ammunition popped into the air in a traditional
Lebanese display.
President Elias Sarkis said later in a speech
broadcast nationwide that Syria's "fraternal inter
vention" will end when "we have recovered our
strength, ability, security and the will to live to
gether as a nation and share the same destiny."
His remarks for today's 33rd anniversary of
Lebanese independence from France held forth
promise of political reforms, but without specific
pledges, and pleaded for cooperation in rebuilding
this shattered nation.
"I also look to the youth, especially the combat
ants, and tell them the homeland awaits them in
other fields now," said Sarkis, a Christian.
More than 3000 civilians also gathered to meet
the Syrian occupation columns in Sidon, 25 miles
south of Beirut. They greeted them with jubilation
in the main Sidon square, where three Syrian tanks
were destroyed in a bloody battle last June.
Beame moves to avoid bankruptcy
New York — Mayor Abraham Beame conferred
with representatives of President Gerald Ford and
President-elect Jimmy Carter yesterday in an effort
to help New York City avoid possible bankruptcy.
A court ruling that a key $1.6 billion segment of
the city's recovery program was unconstitutional
touched off an urgent series of new rescue moves on
the city, state and federal level.

Beame admitted there was no solution in sight
yet to his city's fiscal troubles, but he ruled out new
taxes or further large-scale cuts in services.
Beame said that he talked to Carter by telephone
Saturday night and that the president-elect told
him he felt the situation was so critical he would
"by all means" bring it up during talks with Treas
ury Secretary William Simon.
The mayor added that Simon had also called to
reassure him that a planned $70 million in federal
loans would be forthcoming in December despite
the court decision.
Mao's widow linked to Kuomintang

Detroit — American Motors Corp. announced
yesterday it will pay the State of California $1.1
million to settle a dispute in which the automaker
was accused of failing to meet California emission

results from its cars and sold cars in California with
engines which did not meet state regulations.
AMC said its results had been incorrect because
of faulty testing equipment.
The California Air Resources Board had filed suit
against AMC seeking $4.2 million in fines.

American troops was blocked by Kissinger and the

Two segregated unions may merge
New Orleans — The last two racially segregated
statewide teacher organizations in the United

black, vote this week on whether to join forces.

Louisiana Education Association consider a merger
plan that has been in the works for a year.
Both groups are under strong pressure to approve
the plan from the 1.8 million member National
Education Association (NEA).
The NEA expelled the white group several years
ago when it balked at an earlier merger, leaving it
outside the sphere of influence of the nation's
largest education organization.

UAW neutrality pledge gets Ist test
Detroit — The unusual neutrality pledge in the
United Auto Workers' new tentative contract with
General Motors is expected to get its first test next
month in a union organizing effort in Louisiana.
One provision in the GM contract is a company
promise to remain neutral in UAW organizing
drives at the firm's new plants in the South. The
UAW had accused GM of having a "southern
strategy" under which it successfully campaigned
against efforts to unionize the plants.
In return for the neutrality pledge, the union
promised in writing to "neither demean the corpo
ration . . . nor its representatives."
UAW Vice President Irving Bluestone said the
neutrality pledge in the tentative contract reached
last Friday was "a bellwether" for all of organized
labor in the United States.
The first test of the pledge is expected when the
National Labor Relations Board is scheduled to set
an election date next month for some 550 GM work
ers at the company's Monroe, La., auto headlight
plant. The election will be to decide whether the
employes want the UAW to represent them.
Syrian troops cheered by Lebanese
Beirut — Massive Syrian armored forces swept
into Sidon and Tripoli yesterday to complete their
occupation of Lebanon on the eve of its indepen

wild shooting into the air.
"It's great," shouted a bearded Lebanese civilian
riding down Tripoli's main avenue on a Syrian
tank. "It's over, it's been bang, bang and death for
almost two years."
Tripoli children, whose city 60 miles north of
Beirut has been besieged bv Christians since sum
mer, clambered over the Syrian tanks and trucks in
a carnival atmosphere. Thousands of rounds of
ammunition popped into the air in a traditional
Lebanese display.
President Elias Sarkis said later in a speech

Laird: Kissinger kept U.S. in Korea
Washington — Former Secretary of Defense Mel

Laird said yesterday that he believed then and
believes now that the United States commitment to
South Korea should be limited to air support, since

South Korea has twice as many soldiers as North
Korea. There are 40,000 American troops in South
Korea.
He said his plan to gradually withdraw the
American troops was blocked by Kissinger and the
National Security Council "because it would be
destabilizing."
Laird said Japanese and Korean objections to an
American withdrawal should be overruled. Both
countries should be required to pick up any milit

said. •

UAW neutrality pledge gets Ist test
Detroit — The unusual neutrality pledge in the
United Auto Workers' new tentative contract with
General Motors is expected to get its first test next
month in a union organizing effort in Louisiana.
One provision in the GM contract is a company
promise to remain neutral in UAW organizing
drives at the firm's new plants in the South. The
UAW had accused GM of having a "southern
strategy" under which it successfully campaigned
against efforts to unionize the plants.
In return for the neutrality pledge, the union
promised in writing to "neither demean the corpo

UAW Vice President Irving Bluestone said the

riding down Tripoli's main avenue on a Syrian
tank. "It's over, it's been bang, bang and death for
almost two years."
Tripoli children, whose city 60 miles north of
Beirut has been besieged bv Christians since sum

a carnival atmosphere. Thousands of rounds of
ammunition popped into the air in a traditional

Mao's widow linked to Kuomintang
Tokyo Chiang Ching, the widow of Mao Tse

yesterday.
"She never really remolded herself," the official
Hsinhua news agency said in the latest attack on
Chiang Ching, a one-time actress who has been
accused of leading a coup attempt aimed at making
herself Mao's successor as China's ruler.
"We must strip Chiang Ching of the cloak of
'progressive artist of the 19305,' expose her true
features to the light of day and make her a teacher
by negative example for our future generations,"
said the article, which originated in the leading
Communist Chinese newspaper, People's Daily.
The article said Chiang Ching took part in a
Shanghai theatrical film festival in September 1936
to honor the 50th birthday of Nationalist Chinese
leader Chiang Kai-shek. Mao's Communists drove
Chiang's Kuomintang government from the main
land to Taiwan in 1949.
The article said Chiang Ching, then known as
Lan Ping, played the No. 3 role in a film called
Bloodshed on Wolf Mountain, which the article
contended was meant to "prettify fascist rule by the
Kuomintang reactionaries."

Tokyo Chiang Ching, the widow of Mao Tse
tung, willingly served the anti-Communist prop
aganda machinery of the Nationalist Chinese gov
ernment of the 19305, a Peking broadcast claimed
yesterday.
"She never really remolded herself," the official
Hsinhua news agency said in the latest attack on
Chiang Ching, a one-time actress who has been
accused of leading a coup attempt aimed at making
herself Mao's successor as China's ruler.
"We must strip Chiang Ching of the cloak of
'progressive artist of the 19305,' expose her true
features to the light of day and make her a teacher
by negative example for our future generations,"
said the article, which originated in the leading
Communist Chinese newspaper, People's Daily.
The article said Chiang Ching took part in a
Shanghai theatrical film festival in September 1936
to honor the 50th birthday of Nationalist Chinese
leader Chiang Kai-shek. Mao's Communists drove
Chiang's Kuomintang government from the main
land to Taiwan in 1949.
The article said Chiang Ching, then known as
Lan Ping, played the No. 3 role in a film called
Bloodshed on Wolf Mountain, which the article
contended was meant to "prettify fascist rule by the
Kuomintang reactionaries."
Auto firm will pay state $1.1 million
Detroit — American Motors Corp. announced
yesterday it will pay the State of California $1.1
million to settle a dispute in which the automaker
was accused of failing to meet California emission
control standards.
The out-of-court settlement stemmed from alle
gations that AMC submitted false air pollution test
results from its cars and sold cars in California with
engines which did not meet state regulations.
AMC said its results had been incorrect because
of faulty testing equipment.
The California Air Resources Board had filed suit
against AMC seeking $4.2 million in fines.
"We have reached a settlement, but both sides
could back out until the papers are filed in court
(today)," Air Resources Board chairman Tom
Quinn said in California.
Laird: Kissinger kept U.S. in Korea
Washington — Former Secretary of Defense Mel
vin Laird says that Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer blocked his efforts to withdraw American
ground troops from Korea in 1972.
Laird said yesterday that he believed then and
believes now that the United States commitment to
South Korea should be limited to air support, since

South Korea has twice as many soldiers as North
Korea. There are 40,000 American troops in South
Korea.
He said his plan to gradually withdraw the
American troops was blocked by Kissinger and the
National Security Council "because it would be
destabilizing."
Laird said Japanese and Korean objections to an
American withdrawal should be overruled. Both
countries should be required to pick up any milit
ary slack left by departing American troops, he
said. •
Two segregated unions may merge
New Orleans — The last two racially segregated
statewide teacher organizations in the United
States, one mostly white and the other mostly
black, vote this week on whether to join forces.
At separate but simultaneous state conventions,
the overwhelmingly white Louisiana Teachers As
sociation and the smaller, predominantly black
Louisiana Education Association consider a merger
plan that has been in the works for a year.
Both groups are under strong pressure to approve
the plan from the 1.8 million member National
Education Association (NEA).
The NEA expelled the white group several years
ago when it balked at an earlier merger, leaving it
outside the sphere of influence of the nation's
largest education organization.

UAW neutrality pledge gets Ist test
Detroit — The unusual neutrality pledge in the
United Auto Workers' new tentative contract with
General Motors is expected to get its first test next
month in a union organizing effort in Louisiana.
One provision in the GM contract is a company
promise to remain neutral in UAW organizing
drives at the firm's new plants in the South. The
UAW had accused GM of having a "southern
strategy" under which it successfully campaigned
against efforts to unionize the plants.
In return for the neutrality pledge, the union
promised in writing to "neither demean the corpo
ration . . . nor its representatives."
UAW Vice President Irving Bluestone said the
neutrality pledge in the tentative contract reached
last Friday was "a bellwether" for all of organized
labor in the United States.
The first test of the pledge is expected when the
National Labor Relations Board is scheduled to set
an election date next month for some 550 GM work
ers at the company's Monroe, La., auto headlight
plant. The election will be to decide whether the
employes want the UAW to represent them.
Syrian troops cheered by Lebanese
Beirut — Massive Syrian armored forces swept
into Sidon and Tripoli yesterday to complete their
occupation of Lebanon on the eve of its indepen
dence day. They were greeted by shouts of joy and
wild shooting into the air.
"It's great," shouted a bearded Lebanese civilian
riding down Tripoli's main avenue on a Syrian
tank. "It's over, it's been bang, bang and death for
almost two years."
Tripoli children, whose city 60 miles north of
Beirut has been besieged bv Christians since sum
mer, clambered over the Syrian tanks and trucks in
a carnival atmosphere. Thousands of rounds of
ammunition popped into the air in a traditional
Lebanese display.
President Elias Sarkis said later in a speech
broadcast nationwide that Syria's "fraternal inter
vention" will end when "we have recovered our
strength, ability, security and the will to live to
gether as a nation and share the same destiny."
His remarks for today's 33rd anniversary of
Lebanese independence from France held forth
promise of political reforms, but without specific
pledges, and pleaded for cooperation in rebuilding
this shattered nation.
"I also look to the youth, especially the combat
ants, and tell them the homeland awaits them in
other fields now," said Sarkis, a Christian.
More than 3000 civilians also gathered to meet
the Syrian occupation columns in Sidon, 25 miles
south of Beirut. They greeted them with jubilation
in the main Sidon square, where three Syrian tanks
were destroyed in a bloody battle last June.
Beame moves to avoid bankruptcy
New York — Mayor Abraham Beame conferred
with representatives of President Gerald Ford and
President-elect Jimmy Carter yesterday in an effort
to help New York City avoid possible bankruptcy.
A court ruling that a key $1.6 billion segment of
the city's recovery program was unconstitutional
touched off an urgent series of new rescue moves on
the city, state and federal level.

Beame admitted there was no solution in sight
yet to his city's fiscal troubles, but he ruled out new
taxes or further large-scale cuts in services.
Beame said that he talked to Carter by telephone
Saturday night and that the president-elect told
him he felt the situation was so critical he would
"by all means" bring it up during talks with Treas
ury Secretary William Simon.
The mayor added that Simon had also called to
reassure him that a planned $70 million in federal
loans would be forthcoming in December despite
the court decision.
