Bicycle plans on agenda

of the Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan,
which includes controversial provi

bicycle facilities.
The meeting is open to both citizens
of Palo Alto and to residents of sur
rounding areas who travel through or
shop in Palo Alto.
Provisions in the Comprehensive
Plan requiring bicycle boulevards and
bicycle parking facilities were deleted
by the City Council, then partially re
stored after citizen groups protested,
and have been fully restored by the
Palo Alto Planning Commission after
extensive public hearings. The council
will hear final arguments tonight and
determine the ultimate status of the
bicycle facilities.
