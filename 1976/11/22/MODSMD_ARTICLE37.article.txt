# The
						Honor Code at Stanford: Survey compares 1961, 1976 views
## 
### 
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %
Do you consider yourself to be:
Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 52 46
Not well informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 35 44
The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66
Support it by their behavior? 75 68
Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:
% replying "Yes" to Undergrad Grad
1. "Padding" a few items on a biblio- 23 8
graphy
2. Copying a few sentences of material 35 13
without footnoting in a paper
3. Copying answers from a text or other 28 13
source instead of doing the work indepen
dently
4. Writing a paper for another student 3 3
5. Getting questions or answers from
someone who has already taken the same
exam 13 8
6. Giving answers to other students
during an exam 8 5
7. Arranging with other students to give
or receive answers by use of signals 1 0
8. Arranging to sit next to someone who
will let you copy from him during a test or
exam 4 0
9. Copying from someone's test or exam
paper without his knowing it 10 3
10. Taking an exam for another student 1 0
11. Having another student take an
exam for you 0 0
12. Working on the same homework
with several students when the teacher does
not allow it 12 12
13. Buying a term or exam paper 0 0
