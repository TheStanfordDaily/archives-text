# The 						Honor Code at Stanford: Survey compares 1961, 1976 views
## 
### 
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %
Do you consider yourself to be:
Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 52 46
Not well informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 35 44
The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66
Support it by their behavior? 75 68
Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:
% replying "Yes" to Undergrad Grad
1. "Padding" a few items on a biblio- 23 8

2. Copying a few sentences of material 35 13

dently
4. Writing a paper for another student 3 3
5. Getting questions or answers from
someone who has already taken the same
exam 13 8
6. Giving answers to other students

7. Arranging with other students to give
or receive answers by use of signals 1 0
8. Arranging to sit next to someone who

Because the actions range from trivial to serious, and
these distributions count acts, not individuals, we construc
ted three indices of so-called cheating behavior. The first
index counts the number of respondents who checked at
least one item of the 1 7-item set shown above. The second
index is also a count, but excludes items 1-3 above. The third
index counts examination cheating only (items 5-10, 14-15).
% of respondents

At least one act of cheating (all items included) 70 42
"Serious" cheating (excludes 1-3) 45 27
Examination cheating 31 15
Our respondent's perceptions of the amount of cheatiny
among their fellow students are most usefully viewed in the
context of their self-reports of cheating, a topic addressed in
Section 4, and in comparison with the 1961 data, discussed
in Section 3. Suffice it to say here that undergraduates
perceive substantially more cheating than do graduate stu
dents:

Respondents were asked to estimate, in percentage terms,
levels and types of cheating, levels of discovered cheating,
types of discipline imposed, etc. It is surprising, given their
differences in personal observation of cheating, that the
percentage estimates provided by graduates and undergradu
ates are quite similar. Some examples follow:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage have cheated since coming to Stanford."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-15%) 35% 53%
Medium estimate (16-50%) 51 38
High estimate (above 15
High estimate (above 50%) 14 10
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheat frequently."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 44% 43%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 44 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 13

"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage are discovered. "
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate <0-4% 43% 41%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 43 41
High estimate (above 15%) 14 18
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage are discovered
by the instructor."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-70%) 47% 42%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 34 34
High estimate (above 97%) 19 24
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for
cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 49% 41%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 47 41
High estimate (above 85%) 4 18
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for
cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases action is taken by the instructor."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-35%) 39% 54%
Medium estimate (36-90%) 52 42
High estimate (above 90%) 9 4
Our respondents were asked how they learned about most
of the cases of cheating and plagiarim that they know about.
The student grapevine predominates among undergraduates,
but not for graduates:
Undergrads Grads
Observing the instances yourself 19% 23%
Hearing about them from the offenders 8 4
Hearing about them from other students
on the grapevine 55 33
Hearing about them through official channels
(e.g.. The Daily, Dean's Office,
a faculty member, etc.) 18 40
We turn now to two questions which will be reexamined
from other angles in subsequent sections of this report.
Though not directly addressing Honor Code issues, they
indicate the amount of support for the "reporting obliga
tion"—that observers of cheating report the offenders. The
low support expressed is all the more striking because the
questions pose hypothetical situations:
Suppose you saw a student cheating. What would you do?
Undergrads Grads
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 5% (1) 10%
Ask him to report himself and report him
if he fails to do so 3 ( (3) 10
Express disapproval informally but not
report him 34 (68) 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 33 (5) 17
Ignore the incident 25 (23) 29
Graduates and undergraduates agree about how their
behavior would change were the offender "a close friend":
the undergraduate percentages are shown in parentheses
above. If the offender were "a campus leader," however,
reporting becomes somewhat more likely, increasing to 17%
for undergraduates and 28% for graduates.
The second hypothetical question shows only small differ
ences between graduates and undergraduates; the percentages
below are for the undergraduate respondents.
If someone asked you for help during a test or exam,
what would you do?
Undergrad %
Give him the answer 2
Say nothing but expose your paper so
he can copy the answer 2
Ignore or turn down his request 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 21
Report him to the appropriate authorities 2
If the person seeking help were a friend, the percentage
selecting the first or second option increases to 21%; re
actions to "a campus leader" or "someone you disliked
personally" are not substantially different from those shown
above for an unspecified person.
One question attempts to assess in a global sort of way
"the cheating problem":
"Do you believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty at Stanford poses a serious threat to the academic
process?"
Undergrad %
Yes, very serious 11
Moderately serious 32
Not very serious 55

Between one-fifth ana about half of the undergraduate
population support the introduction of examination proctor
ing, or allowing for proctoring as an option:

Graduate student responses differ in that many more
appear in the No Opinion column; when preferences are
expressed, they are in the same direction as those shown
above for undergraduates.
Asked who should serve as exam proctors, class instruc
tors and graduate TAs—in that order—are overwhelmingly
preferred over students from outside the class. Similarly, the
majority of respondents think that students should not
participate in "identifying and selecting from a pool of
potential proctors":

Finally, students were asked what probable effects would
result from instituting exam proctoring. Below we show the
undergraduate responses; where graduate responses are sub
stantially different, they appear in parentheses.
The incidence of cheating on examinations
would be reduced. 71%
Students would no longer feel obliged to report
the dishonesty of others on examinations 67 (50)
An Honor Code would lose meaning 58 (43)
A meaningful Honor Code would cease to exist 47 (26)
Students would feel threatened by the lack
of trust 44 ( 32)
Students would feel protected from a
minority of dishonest students 43
The incident of cheating in other areas would
increase (e.g., take-home exams, lab reports). 16
Students would no longer feel obliged to behave
honestly on examinations 12
We now turn, in the following sections, to more detailed
considerations of the results of our study, broadly and
briskly described above.
Section 2: The Role of Background Characteristics
It is a truism of social research that one can always find
background characteristics of respondents which correlate—at
impressive statistical levels—with the dependent variables
under scrutiny. This study is no exception.
Separately for graduates and undergraduates, we cross
tabulated a range of background characteristics with a long
but selective list of variables concerning values, perceptions,
and behaviors. We found many, many differences; undergrad
uate class, academic department, and—to a lesser extent
graduate school intentions, sex, and citizenship, all show
correlations with many of our value and behavior indicators.
In the interests of brevity, clarity, and progress, we have
selected from this mass of data in two ways: first, only those
findings of central policy interest to the SCLC are being
reported here; and second, only those patterns of relation
ships which are internally consistent will receive attention.
An example which meets the first criterion but fails the
second: Freshmen and sophomores are more likely to know
that the Honor Code prohibits proctoring, but less likely to
agree that the Honor Code "regulates faculty behavior." Both
relationships are statistically significant; viewed together,
however, they don't make sense and are better politely
dismissed than puzzled over (e.g., "It appears that undergrad
uate class is not systematically related to knowledge of
Honor Code contents.")
Tables showing the relationships described in this section
r,ro available in the appendices. Throughout what follows,
"sophomores" should be understood to include our four
token freshmen.
Undergraduate class relates in a variety of ways to several
key variables, especially perceptions of cheating. Honor Code
commitment, and attitudes toward proctoring. Sophomores
have seen less cheating and fewer instances of students
reporting others for cheating; they are, however, slightly
more likely to have seen instructors ignoring cheating behav
ior. Although their self-reported cheating varies only slightly
from that of upperclassmen, sophomores are more likely to
worry about false accusations of cheating.
Sophomores are especially likely to state that the Honor
Code system should be altered, and least likely to describe
themselves as believing strongly in the current system. They
favor the introduction of exam proctoring more than upper
classmen do, especially in classes with enrollments over 30,
and/or in required preprofessional classes.
Sophomores' attitudes and experiences extend to their
perceptions of other students and faculty: they are least
likely to think other students favor continuation of the
current Honor Code; while more likely to believe that faculty
know about the Honor Code and its requirements, they are
least likely to think faculty favor its continuation or support
it by their behavior.
Differences by undergraduate major are, by and large,
inconsistent and statistically small—few exceed 10%. There is
some tendency for respondents in social science departments
to see a world that is consistently slightly different from that
seen by others; the humanities, science, and engineering
students do not generally differ greatly from each other in
patterned or consistent ways.
Social science majors are distinctive in the following
respects: they report having seen more cheating, more often
been asked for help on exams, more often observed an
instructor ignoring cheating, knowing of more instances of
students reporting offenders, and more likely to think that
the current level of academic dishonesty poses a serious
threat to the educational process.
Their self-reports of cheating are high on three of the six
items where area of major shows a difference; unlike the
other disciplinary areas, they are low on no item. They do
not, however, conspicuously favor exam proctoring; indeed,
they are least willing to proctor "as a University obligation,"
though the percent willing doubles "if paid" (the other
disciplinary areas show a decrease in willingness if proctoring
were a paid job). While not especially in favor of any of the
proctoring options, social science majors are least likely to
believe that an effect of proctoring would be that "the Honor
Code would lose meaning."
Many of the areas in which social science majors differ
from our other undergraduate respondents also differentiate
between undergraduates with professional school versus grad
uate school intentions.
On all variables relating to knowledge of cheating, general
perceptions of the extent of cheating, and self-reported
cheating, either no differences appear or the profession
oriented students are higher—i.e., more aware of cheating and
higher rates of self-reported cheating.
On the Honor Code quiz, profession-oriented students are
less likely to know that exam proctoring is prohibited; later
questions show them to be more in favor of mandatory
proctoring, slightly more willing to proctor as an obligation,
and much more willing to proctor if paid to do so.
The two groups also differ in the results they would
expect from proctoring: graduate school-oriented students
believe that students would feel threatened, while the profes
sion-oriented think that "feeling protected" is a more likely
outcome.
Sex and ethnic background are generally unrewarding
variables in this study. Two self-reported cheating items, both
referring to copying from another's paper during an exam,
show women less likely—by 10% or more—to cheat in this
fashion.
Women are more likely to consider themselves "not well
informed" about the Honor Code, though their quiz scores
are no worse than the men's. Mandatory proctoring receives
more support from women; other proctoring options, how
ever, are not conspicuously supported by one sex or the
other. Favorable effects of proctoring—e.g., that students
would feel protected—are cited more frequently by women;
men are more likely to respond that an Honor Code would
lose meaning and/or that a meaningful Honor Code would
cease to exist.
The ethnic background tables include both graduates and
undergraduates in order to obtain a statistically comfortable
number of "non-Caucasian" respondents (black, chicano,
Spanish surname, native American, Asian American, or

"other"). The ethnic conglomerate may be meaningless; but,
in any case, being "non-Caucasian" does not relate consis
tently or significantly to any of the behavioral or attitudinal
variables in our study.
Background Variables and the Graduate Sample
The obvious and occasionally interesting differences dis
cussed with respect to our undergraduate respondents are
not, in general, evident among the graduate respondents in
our sample. There are not as many cases, and two areas
(Earth Sciences and H & S Humanities) include too few cases
to allow attention to comparative percentages.
The reader may remember from Section 1 that experience
with and awareness of academic dishonesty is signfficantly
lower among Stanford's graduate student population. One
result of this difference is that is is less rewarding—indeed
discouragint—to examine departmental or other background
variables with respect to the respondent's own cheating or
awareness of it: there are simply too few cases to yield
dependable percentages. Thus we have a reduced set of
variables to examine; however—to the extent that any disci
plinary area stands out as consistently different from the
other two—it is, at the graduate level, that of H & S science
and math students.
Not many variables, even with the reduced set, show
disciplinary differences. Those that do tend to be those
discussed both earlier and later in this report—those items
with respect to which, for a variety of reasons, our sample
respondents seem to differ. On these variables, shown in
tabular form in the appendices, graduate students in H & S
science and math departments come through as personally
moral pessimists.
The differences are neither wholly consistent nor statis
tically awesome, but it appears that the science/math sub
group is more likely to endorse the broadly-stated values of
honesty, to not worry much personally about cheating, and
to cheat less; to perceive less Honor Code support and
knowledge among fellow-students and faculty; and to not
favor the proctoring remedy, anticipating several ill effects.
With flags of caution waving wildly, we close this section
with a few comments about the graduate student population
who are not U.S. citizens. It is a small group (only 18
respondents), and hence the need for caution. The differ
ences in responses between citizens and noncitizens, however,
are surprisingly consistent over a range of variables—unlike
our results with the "non-Caucasian" background variable.
To summarize the tables which appear in the appendices,
value statements which citizens tend to endorse (e.g. "Most
students want to be honest."), noncitizens indicate "Not
Sure"; others which citizens tend to disagree with (e.g.,
"Reporting someone for cheating is worse than cheating"),
noncitizens tend to endorse. They express less commitment
to the Honor Code and perceive less support among other
students. They are less supportive of (or less opinionated
about) various proctoring options, less willing to serve as
proctors, and likely to expect more negative results to follow
the introduction of proctoring. These several areas of differ
ence are not always statistically large, but the fact that
differences consistently appear is deserving of some atten
tion.
Section 3: Some Comparisons Between 1961 and 1976
Before discussing the results of our comparisons over
time, it is appropriate to restate some of the differences
between the studies which restrict the ease with which our
comparisons may safely lead to firm conclusions:
1) The 1961 results are based on only 75 undergraduates,
a 75% response rate from the sample;
2) The 1961 study was nationwide, sponsored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and covered many topics related to
social control processes, whereas our study is internally
sponsored and relatively narrow in scope; and
3) The representation of freshmen in the 1961 survey
was proportional to their population size, which is not true
of 1976 freshmen.
On the positive side, the questions we chose to repeat are
identical in wording and response categories to the 1961
versions; also, background items for which we have other
sources of trend data—e.g., sex, age, grade average, ethnic
background, and type of campus housing—show changes very
similar to those in the questionnaire responses.
We will discuss several interesting comparisons in this
section; attention will focus first, however, on four findings
of special interest to the SCLC.
First, contrary to prevailing opinion, our data show no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976.
Second, current students are more likely to have actually
seen instances of cheating, and to perceive-in a general
way—that more cheating exists, than was true of their
predecessors.
Third, there is a notable drop in expressed support for
value statements concerning honesty, especially those with a
universal tone—e.g., "Under no circumstances is cheating ever
justified."
Fourth, support for the reporting aspect of the Honor
Code has indeed declined; in 1961, about one-quarter of the
sample would, m a hypothetical cheating situation, report the

offender or ask that he report himself—compared to less than
10% who say they would do so in 1976.
Self-Reports of Academic Dishonesty

year, selected the fourth or fifth categories, that we show

The lack of change shown above is worth notice; where
there are changes—in either direction—they are too small to
warrant serious attention. It is, we believe, a safe conclusion
that self-reported acts of cheating are unchanged between
1961 and 1976. (We should point out that in Bowers' 1961
data, the Stanford level of cheating was found to be very low
in a nation-wide context. Even on those questions which
show an increase between 1961 and 1976, the current
Stanford percent is below the nationwide 1961 sample
percent.)
PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIC
DISHONESTY
Here we see some substantial differences. In both years,
students were asked, "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], have you seen another student cheating during a
test or exam?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76

It seems indisputable that current students are more likely
to have personally witnessed cheating activity. Regardless of
their own experience, they also hold different perceptions of
the extent of academic dishonesty and the functioning of
disciplinary processes. Students in both years were asked to
estimate, in percentage terms, the frequency of the following
events:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage has cheated since coming to Stanford."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-15%) 42% 35%
Medium estimate (16-60%) 37 51
High estimate (above 60%) 21 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheats frequently."

"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are

by the course instructor."
1961 1976

Medium estimate (71-97%) 68 34
High estimate (above 97%) 0 19
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarized and are

other students."

"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty

Medium estimate (21-85%) 9 47
High estimate (above 85%) 1 4
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty

age of the cases disciplinary action is taken by the course

High estimate (above 90%) 12 9
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty

1961 1976
Low estimate (0-5%) 19% 32%
Medium estimate (6-50%) 39 56
High estimate (above 50%) 42 11
Comparing percentage distributions of percentage esti
mates can be quite confusing. Some differences, however,
come through quite clearly: 1961 respondents estimated a
higher "discovery rate" for cheaters, expected more disco
veries to be made by faculty, and substantially more cheating
cases being passed to authorities beyond the classroom. In
neither year did many students perceive a high level of
self-reporting ("0%" the majority estimate—chosen by 59% in
1961 and 69% currently).
These indicated trends in the percentage estimates are
confirmed by another set of responses elsewhere in the
questionnaire:

Unfortunately, our 1961 data are in the form of com
puter print-out rather than IBM cards, so we are unable to
examine the relationships between these value endorsements
and other variables of obvious interest—like self-reports of
cheating. As we will discuss later in Section 4, 1976 respon
dents who agree strongly with some of these statements are
conspicuously different from their fellow-students in several
other ways as well.
RESPONSES TO HYPOTHETICAL CHEATING SITUA
TIONS
Earlier we examined responses about cheating actually
observed; here we inquire what our responses would do if
they observed cheating.
"Suppose you saw a student cheating on a test or exam.
What would you do?"
1961 1976
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 4% 5%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 22 3
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 36 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 14 33
Ignore the incident 2525
In both years, one-quarter of the students in this hypothe
tical situation would ignore the incident. Also in both years,
the modal choice is to express disapproval but not to report
the offender.
The big change is in the second most popular form of
social control-in 1961, it is to ask the person to report
himself and report him if he doesn't do so, and in 1976 it is
to mention the incident to others but not report it.

"How often have the following things happened that you
knowabout?"

As before, the areas of large change are in perceived
self-reporting and faculty alertness and activity, student
reporting of others is seen to be only slightly less frequent
now.
Student views of faculty are tapped in yet another way,
with consistent differences over time again evident.

Before considering behaviors and perceptions more di
rectly related to the Honor Code, we'll look briefly at some
value statements put to both undergraduate samples.
VALUES ABOUT HONESTY
Here we see some of the largest differences of any found
so far in our several analyses. There can be little doubt that
the changes in the "Agree Strongly" column below, especial
ly for the first two statements, constitute real differences
between our two samples.

It may seem surprising that only 26% of the 1961 sample
supported the reporting obligation of the Honor Code; but
other responses show that students also perceived some
student support for reporting in 1961—the combination of
general perception plus 26% commitment may well have
resulted in a social control system that effectively reduced
academic dishonesty.
Another hypothetical situation was posed:
1961 1976
Give him the answer 0% 2%
Say nothing but expose your paper
so he can copy the answer 4 2
Ignore or turn down his request 59 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 32 21
Report him to the appropriate
authorities 5 2
Two categories show 10-15% differences; ignoring or
rejecting such a request is a more popular option now, and
expressing disapproval informally is less popular. Neither
sample views reporting the request with much favor.
Both hypothetical situations were elaborated by changing
the identity of the cheater from an unspecified individual to
"a campus leader" and "a close friend"; the second situation
added a third, "some you disliked personally." In both years,
a friend observed cheating is less likely to be reported and
more likely to be informally disapproved of; campus leaders
>n both years are more severely treated than others—27% of
the 1961 sample, and 17% in 1976, would report him, and
only about 20% would ignore the incident.
For the solicited exam aid situation, our two samples are
similar with the following exceptions; whereas currently 21%
would cooperate with a friend's request, only 7% thought
they would do so in 1961; both samples are more likely to
express disapproval to a friend than to the other specified
offenders, 42% selecting this treatment of a friend in 1961,
and 30% in 1976. For neither sample is reporting a likely
option—even for campus leaders in 1961, the figure is only
7%.
This concludes our review of trend findings of key
interest to the SCLC. We have restricted our interpretive
comments to the analytic variety, indicating which differ
ences seemed, to us, worth serious attention.
Another level of interpretation, however, is needed with
respect to one blatant anomaly: How is it that individual
self-reported cheating is unchanged, but current students
report seeing more cheating than their predecessors? One
possible interpretation is simply that cheating is more conspi
cuous when it does occur; that the change in moral climate,
suggested by the value endorsement data, has both allowed
current cheaters to be more open in their activities and
opened more widely the eyes and ears of noncheaters. To the
extent that our 1976 data permit, we will examine these
possibilities in Section 4. Our aim here is to draw attention to
the phenomenon and encourage speculation.
1961 AND 1976 VIEWS ON THE PURPOSES OF A COL
LEGE EDUCATION
Several questions on the Bowers questionnaire, while not
related to the SCLC task, were so potentially interesting to
repeat 15 years later that we easily yielded to the temptation.
Students were asked to consider a list of purposes of a college
education, to indicate the importance of each purpose to the
respondent, and then to select that purpose considered most
important to the respondent.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Most
Important Purpose
1961 1976
gg Provide a basic general education and
appreciation of ideas
Provide vocational training; develop
skills and techniques directly
applicable to my career
Develop my ability to get along with
different kinds of people
Develop my knowledge and interest in the
® ® community and world problems
Help develop my moral capacities, ethical
® standards and values
Prepare me for a happy marriage
® and family life
Looking at these comparisons, it is hard to believe that 15
turbulent years have passed since the first survey. With two
exceptions, the differences are smaller than pollsters ex
pected to find over a one-week time span! Amidst such
constancy, the two shifts stand out sharply: Current students
attribute somewhat less importance to acquiring knowledge
about world problems (though the change is not large); and
our sample virtually rejects preparation for marriage as an
important purpose of college—in 1961, 53% assigned some
importance to this purpose, compared with 28% today.
With some trepidation, we also repeated the question,
"How well satisfied are you with your educational experience
at Stanford [at this school] ?"
1961 1976
Very well satisfied 38% 24%
Fairly well satisfied 55 63
Not very well satisfied 7 13
Not at all satisfied 0 0
The drop in the top category, while not huge, is big
enough to qualify as real. We did not inquire into reasons for
the respondents' level of satisfaction (nor did Bowers), and
thus cannot help those wishing to interpret or evaluate the
significance of this change.
Section 4: A Closer Look at Self-Reported Cheating
While we know more now about the state of academic
honesty at Stanford than we did prior to the survey, we still
should look closer at the correlates of self-reported cheating
activity.
Our data do not allow us to assign causality and statis
tically test alternative explanations of cheating behavior; we
can, however, change tactics from preceding sections and
focus on different levels of cheating—seeking related variables
that are potentially manipulable, be it by policy or informal
effort.
We make frequent use in this section of the three
"cheating indices" introd - "~ed in Section 1: Cheating Index,
"Serious" Cheating, and Exam Cheating. By cross-tabulating
each index with a wide range of variables, we looked for
differences between the three indices (e.g.. Are those who
admit to serious cheating different from those who admit to

what one SCLC member labeled "dilettante cheating"?), as
well as for differences between self-confessed cheaters of
whatever stripe and noncheaters.
First, we examine the hypothesis that noncheaters are
better informed about the contents of the Honor Code than
are those who cheat. We created a Knowledge Index based on
the quiz-type questions, high scores going to those with a
higher proportion of right answers. Cross-tabulating the
Knowledge Index with each cheating index produced no
difference worth reporting. It appears that our respondents
who cheat know neither more nor less about the Honor Code
than their contemporaries who don't cheat.
Perceived cheating is, not surprisingly, positively related
to self-reported cheating; the indices work similarly, but the
relationship shows most clearly in the example below:
"Since you have been at Stanford, have you seen another
student cheating during a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Never 61% 54% 29%
Once 9 8 9
A few times 23 27 39
Several times 5 7 11
Many times 2 3 12

55 41 40 46 4 13
26 29 47 45 27 26
10 4 43 24 47 72
The biggest difference is between those who are high on
our index (N=s6), versus those who are medium or low. This
pattern reappears in response to the question, "What would
you do if you saw someone cheating on a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 9% 4% 4%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 5 4 0
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 42 37 23
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 28 29 39
Ignore the incident 16 25 34
Similarly, those who admit to having cheated are more
likely to have been asked for help during a test or exam; in
response to such a request, they are more likely to aid the
person or ignore the incident (versus reporting or expressing
disapproval).
Strong differences appear when the cheating index is
cross-tabulated with the three universalistic value statements
(again, all three cheating indices work similarly). The follow
ing table examplifies the differences found with respect to
the other value statements as well.
"Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified."

Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 74% 40% 26%
Agree mildly 23 14
Not sure 5 19 24
Disagree mildly 9 27
Disagree strongly 14 9

The differences seen above are substantially reduced when
respondents are asked to indicate their agreement with the
statement: "Honesty is desirable, but currently impossible at
Stanford."
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 10% 8% 11%
Agree mildly 12 16 24
Not sure 21 12 14
Disagree mildly 16 21 22
Disagree strongly 41 43 29
We also find no large differences with respect to level of
commitment to the current Honor Code, or to the serious
ness of the current level of academic dishonesty at Stanford.
There is a modest tendency for noncheaters to prefer proc
toring, but the differences are neither consistently related to
level of self-reported cheating nor larger than about 10%.
With respect to background variables, seniors tend to
appear in the medium and high categories on our scales (52%
of the "highs" are seniors). There is a discernable but
undramatic tendency for social science majors to be high,
engineering and science majors medium, and humanities low.
There is a similar consistent, modest tendency for students
with professional school plans to score higher on our indices
than those planning to attend graduate school.
A final small correlation that is packed with interpretative
potential: Noncheaters are more likely to be "very satisfied"
with their educational experiences at Stanford than respon
dents scoring medium or high (% "very satisfied," 33%, 24%,
and 18% respectively).
Since our largest unexpected differences, both here and in
the 1961 comparisons, have involved three value statements,
we decided to look more closely at our respondents' value
endorsements. We created an index called Strong Values, ana
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each respondent according
to how many times he indicated strong agreement with these
statements:
1) Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified.
2) Students are morally obligated not to cheat.
3) Cheating directly contradicts the goals of education.
Our population split very neatly into the four categories,
about 25% in each.
Our subsequent cross-tabulations yielded interesting re
sults, which we will first summarize, and then examine some
details. Respondents with high scores on our Strong Values
index are much less aware of, involved in, and opinionated
about all matters related to cheating at Stanford. Their
responses to hypothetical cheating situations are very likely
to include expressing disapproval, even to friends (similar to
the 1961 response for the whole sample).
They learn about cheating primarily from official
channels, and about the Honor Code from signing blue
books. They are more likely to indicate strong belief in the
Honor Code, and to believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty constitutes a moderate or serious problem They
do not, however, hold consistently different perceptions of
fellow students or faculty with respect to Honor Code
support, nor are their opinions about specific aspects of the
Honor Code different from their fellow respondents. They
are not conspicuously either for or against proctoring; on
these and other questions soliciting opinions about hypothe
tical effects or the attitudes of others, they are more likely to
check "not sure."
They are, in sum, an interesting, not easily comprehen
sible, group of people—slightly more likely to be female and
majoring in the humanities, unlikely to be seniors, and more
likely to be very satisfied with their educational experience at
Stanford.
The tables that follow show the most impressive of the
differences discussed above. Other tables referred to but not
presented below are in the appendices.

Another section of the questionnaire elicited many speci
fic course characteristics of courses taken winter quarter by
our respondents. Among other things, they were asked about
the extent and types of cheating that occurred in the two
winter courses they liked best, and the one liked least.
Each single cheating item received too few mentions to be
useful to us, so we grouped together all mentions of any type
or level of cheating for the course liked best and created an
index, and similarly for the course liked least. Only 17
nonzero scores are on the first index (mentions of cheating
instances), and 36 on the course-liked-least index. The index
items are:
Respondent personally knew about or learned about. . . .
* Any other students cheating on the final exam, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on tests other than the
final, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on homework or lab
assignments, and/or;
* At least half the other students cheating at one or
another time during the course.
We were interested in learning what types of courses were
likely settings for cheating; by cross-tabulating the other
course characteristics against the index scores, we identified
several characteristics differentiating courses with observed
cheating from other courses.
Those courses liked best in which cheating occurred were
likely to be introductory, have more than 30 students
enrolled, and have short-answer exams (versus open-book,
essay, or take-homes). Past tests were likely to be available
for study purposes, seating was staggered during exams, and
either a TA or the instructor was likely to remain in the room
during exams.
Those observing cheating are likely to be high on our
cheating indices, which supports our earlier conclusion that
those who observe cheating are themselves more likely to
cheat. The course-least-liked index tables show similar results.
On the whole, we suspect that the attempt in this section
to understand better students who cheat and settings con
ducive to cheating events has produced results more useful to
the student of social deviance than to the concerned policy
evaluator.
The characteristics most obviously related to self-reported
cheating are value stances of a special, universalistic sort—a

trait probably not nurtured during the undergraduate years,
or seniors would not be conspicuously absent from the group
of high scorers on our values index.
With respect to the finding that those who cheat are much
more likely to observe other cheating, our data don't allow us
to establish the order of the relationship—i.e., does own
cheating heighten awareness and thus perceptions of others'
cheating, or does one begin cheating in response to observing
it? Probably both processes occur, but we cannot disentangle
them.
One main policy modification, the introduction of op
tional or mandatory proctoring of exams, is not strongly or
consistently favored by our population of noncheaters, nor
by the overlapping subgroup of those high on our values
index. Proctoring already exists in some classes, and our
respondents are more likely to report instances of cheating in
courses with proctored exams.
That does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that
proctoring is ineffective; that students do see cheating in
proctored exam courses may, however, help to explain the
lack of widespread support for proctoring as a solution to the
ills of academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
We have examined, described, and assessed a large amount
of data on Stanford students—their personal honesty, their
valuation of honesty, their experiences with and perceptions
of academic dishonesty among their fellow students, their
concern about cheating, their attitudes toward and know
ledge of the Honor Code, and their opinions about possible
modifications of the current system. What, after all this, can
we safely assert that we know?
First, and perhaps most important, is the conclusion that
Stanford does not currently have a "cheating problem";
those who have worried about a West Point level scandal may
sleep soundly, at least for a while. While cheating continues
to exist in academic endeavors, our data show that the
incidence of self-reported cheating among undergraduates is
approximately the same now as it was in 1961.
The increased selectivity exercised in undergraduate ad
missions may account in part for this lack of change;
although the pressures on students have certainly increased,
the student body includes fewer undergraduates who cannot
cope with the academic demands made of them
The picture is not entirely rosy, however. Indeed, it is
only a slight exaggeration to state that the low incidence of
cheating is independent of the current control system rather
than a result of it. Students are not knowledgeable about the
contents of the Honor Code, nor is the majority highly
committed to it. They similarly perceive their fellow students
and faculty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not
actually indifferent or opposed to it. The crux of the matter
is that the system is not seen to be working.
Students are both more aware of the cheating that does
exist, and less willing to report offenders (or ask them to
report themselves). Nor do they see faculty members filling
the activity gap as either police or advocates. (As our report
on the faculty surveys will state, this perception of the
faculty is essentially correct.)
There is no evidence that personal moral standards have
declined at Stanford, though the willingness to hold others to
universalistic standards seems to have declined substantially.
The 25% of our sample who do endorse the several
universalistic value statements in the questionnaire, and who
are substantially more willing to observe the reporting obliga
tion—these students are not, apparently, very visible or very
vocal among their fellow students. They do not have as much
experience with instances of cheating as the rest of the
sample; and, or course, it may be lack of experience which
permits them to predict that their hypothetical behavior
would differ from that of the majority.
We find no strong support for exam proctoring, even
among those subgroups most aware of and concerned about
levels of cheating.
The minority most exposed to cheating seem to favor
unilateral solutions, while the rest are more likely to reject
proctoring or prefer it as a faculty and/or student option. In
short, both the need to modify the current Honor Code, and
the appropriateness of alternative modifications continue to
be judgmental matters: our data provide no clear answers.
Our own interpretation—and it is merely that—is that
Stanford's Honor Code suffers primarily from invisibility
ignorance and apathy better describe our sample than dis
honesty and anxiety. While some modifications may be in
order (e.g., eliminating the reporting obligation, and per
mitting proctoring at studen' and/or instructor preference), it
is premature to consider abandoning the current system.
An educational program is needed, not simply on the
contents of the Code but also on topics like "What plagiarism
is and how to avoid it." (English and communication have
such a statement and some faculty members, at least, distri
bute copies to their students.)
People who throw out the baby with the bath water are
usually unaware that the baby is there; and until the
presence, characteristics, and value of the Honor Code are
widely known on campus, hasty action—like pulling the
plug—would be both unnecessary and undesirable.
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %
Do you consider yourself to be:
Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 52 46
Not well informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 35 44
The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66
Support it by their behavior? 75 68
Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:
% replying "Yes" to Undergrad Grad
1. "Padding" a few items on a biblio- 23 8

2. Copying a few sentences of material 35 13

3. Copying answers from a text or other 28 13

4. Writing a paper for another student 3 3
5. Getting questions or answers from
someone who has already taken the same
exam 13 8
6. Giving answers to other students

7. Arranging with other students to give
or receive answers by use of signals 1 0
8. Arranging to sit next to someone who

Because the actions range from trivial to serious, and
these distributions count acts, not individuals, we construc
ted three indices of so-called cheating behavior. The first
index counts the number of respondents who checked at
least one item of the 1 7-item set shown above. The second
index is also a count, but excludes items 1-3 above. The third
index counts examination cheating only (items 5-10, 14-15).

"Serious" cheating (excludes 1-3) 45 27

Our respondent's perceptions of the amount of cheatiny
among their fellow students are most usefully viewed in the
context of their self-reports of cheating, a topic addressed in
Section 4, and in comparison with the 1961 data, discussed
in Section 3. Suffice it to say here that undergraduates
perceive substantially more cheating than do graduate stu
dents:

Respondents were asked to estimate, in percentage terms,
levels and types of cheating, levels of discovered cheating,
types of discipline imposed, etc. It is surprising, given their
differences in personal observation of cheating, that the
percentage estimates provided by graduates and undergradu
ates are quite similar. Some examples follow:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage have cheated since coming to Stanford."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-15%) 35% 53%
Medium estimate (16-50%) 51 38
High estimate (above 15
High estimate (above 50%) 14 10
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheat frequently."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 44% 43%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 44 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 13

"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage are discovered. "
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate <0-4% 43% 41%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 43 41
High estimate (above 15%) 14 18
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage are discovered
by the instructor."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-70%) 47% 42%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 34 34
High estimate (above 97%) 19 24
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for
cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 49% 41%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 47 41
High estimate (above 85%) 4 18
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for
cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases action is taken by the instructor."
Undergrad Grad

Medium estimate (36-90%) 52 42
High estimate (above 90%) 9 4
Our respondents were asked how they learned about most
of the cases of cheating and plagiarim that they know about.
The student grapevine predominates among undergraduates,
but not for graduates:
Undergrads Grads
Observing the instances yourself 19% 23%
Hearing about them from the offenders 8 4
Hearing about them from other students
on the grapevine 55 33
Hearing about them through official channels
(e.g.. The Daily, Dean's Office,
a faculty member, etc.) 18 40
We turn now to two questions which will be reexamined
from other angles in subsequent sections of this report.
Though not directly addressing Honor Code issues, they
indicate the amount of support for the "reporting obliga
tion"—that observers of cheating report the offenders. The
low support expressed is all the more striking because the
questions pose hypothetical situations:
Suppose you saw a student cheating. What would you do?
Undergrads Grads
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 5% (1) 10%
Ask him to report himself and report him
if he fails to do so 3 ( (3) 10
Express disapproval informally but not
report him 34 (68) 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 33 (5) 17
Ignore the incident 25 (23) 29
Graduates and undergraduates agree about how their
behavior would change were the offender "a close friend":
the undergraduate percentages are shown in parentheses
above. If the offender were "a campus leader," however,
reporting becomes somewhat more likely, increasing to 17%
for undergraduates and 28% for graduates.
The second hypothetical question shows only small differ
ences between graduates and undergraduates; the percentages
below are for the undergraduate respondents.
If someone asked you for help during a test or exam,
what would you do?
Undergrad %
Give him the answer 2
Say nothing but expose your paper so
he can copy the answer 2
Ignore or turn down his request 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 21
Report him to the appropriate authorities 2
If the person seeking help were a friend, the percentage
selecting the first or second option increases to 21%; re
actions to "a campus leader" or "someone you disliked
personally" are not substantially different from those shown
above for an unspecified person.
One question attempts to assess in a global sort of way
"the cheating problem":
"Do you believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty at Stanford poses a serious threat to the academic
process?"
Undergrad %
Yes, very serious 11
Moderately serious 32
Not very serious 55

Graduate student responses differ in that many more
appear in the No Opinion column; when preferences are
expressed, they are in the same direction as those shown
above for undergraduates.
Asked who should serve as exam proctors, class instruc
tors and graduate TAs—in that order—are overwhelmingly
preferred over students from outside the class. Similarly, the
majority of respondents think that students should not
participate in "identifying and selecting from a pool of
potential proctors":

Finally, students were asked what probable effects would

undergraduate responses; where graduate responses are sub
stantially different, they appear in parentheses.

The incident of cheating in other areas would

Students would no longer feel obliged to behave

We now turn, in the following sections, to more detailed
considerations of the results of our study, broadly and
briskly described above.
Section 2: The Role of Background Characteristics
It is a truism of social research that one can always find
background characteristics of respondents which correlate—at
impressive statistical levels—with the dependent variables
under scrutiny. This study is no exception.
Separately for graduates and undergraduates, we cross
tabulated a range of background characteristics with a long
but selective list of variables concerning values, perceptions,
and behaviors. We found many, many differences; undergrad
uate class, academic department, and—to a lesser extent
graduate school intentions, sex, and citizenship, all show
correlations with many of our value and behavior indicators.
In the interests of brevity, clarity, and progress, we have
selected from this mass of data in two ways: first, only those
findings of central policy interest to the SCLC are being
reported here; and second, only those patterns of relation
ships which are internally consistent will receive attention.
An example which meets the first criterion but fails the
second: Freshmen and sophomores are more likely to know
that the Honor Code prohibits proctoring, but less likely to
agree that the Honor Code "regulates faculty behavior." Both
relationships are statistically significant; viewed together,
however, they don't make sense and are better politely
dismissed than puzzled over (e.g., "It appears that undergrad
uate class is not systematically related to knowledge of
Honor Code contents.")
Tables showing the relationships described in this section
r,ro available in the appendices. Throughout what follows,
"sophomores" should be understood to include our four
token freshmen.
Undergraduate class relates in a variety of ways to several
key variables, especially perceptions of cheating. Honor Code
commitment, and attitudes toward proctoring. Sophomores
have seen less cheating and fewer instances of students
reporting others for cheating; they are, however, slightly
more likely to have seen instructors ignoring cheating behav
ior. Although their self-reported cheating varies only slightly
from that of upperclassmen, sophomores are more likely to
worry about false accusations of cheating.
Sophomores are especially likely to state that the Honor
Code system should be altered, and least likely to describe
themselves as believing strongly in the current system. They
favor the introduction of exam proctoring more than upper
classmen do, especially in classes with enrollments over 30,
and/or in required preprofessional classes.
Sophomores' attitudes and experiences extend to their
perceptions of other students and faculty: they are least
likely to think other students favor continuation of the
current Honor Code; while more likely to believe that faculty
know about the Honor Code and its requirements, they are
least likely to think faculty favor its continuation or support
it by their behavior.
Differences by undergraduate major are, by and large,
inconsistent and statistically small—few exceed 10%. There is
some tendency for respondents in social science departments
to see a world that is consistently slightly different from that
seen by others; the humanities, science, and engineering
students do not generally differ greatly from each other in
patterned or consistent ways.
Social science majors are distinctive in the following
respects: they report having seen more cheating, more often
been asked for help on exams, more often observed an
instructor ignoring cheating, knowing of more instances of
students reporting offenders, and more likely to think that
the current level of academic dishonesty poses a serious
threat to the educational process.
Their self-reports of cheating are high on three of the six
items where area of major shows a difference; unlike the
other disciplinary areas, they are low on no item. They do
not, however, conspicuously favor exam proctoring; indeed,
they are least willing to proctor "as a University obligation,"
though the percent willing doubles "if paid" (the other
disciplinary areas show a decrease in willingness if proctoring
were a paid job). While not especially in favor of any of the
proctoring options, social science majors are least likely to
believe that an effect of proctoring would be that "the Honor
Code would lose meaning."
Many of the areas in which social science majors differ
from our other undergraduate respondents also differentiate
between undergraduates with professional school versus grad
uate school intentions.
On all variables relating to knowledge of cheating, general
perceptions of the extent of cheating, and self-reported
cheating, either no differences appear or the profession
oriented students are higher—i.e., more aware of cheating and
higher rates of self-reported cheating.
On the Honor Code quiz, profession-oriented students are
less likely to know that exam proctoring is prohibited; later
questions show them to be more in favor of mandatory
proctoring, slightly more willing to proctor as an obligation,
and much more willing to proctor if paid to do so.
The two groups also differ in the results they would
expect from proctoring: graduate school-oriented students
believe that students would feel threatened, while the profes
sion-oriented think that "feeling protected" is a more likely
outcome.
Sex and ethnic background are generally unrewarding
variables in this study. Two self-reported cheating items, both
referring to copying from another's paper during an exam,
show women less likely—by 10% or more—to cheat in this
fashion.
Women are more likely to consider themselves "not well
informed" about the Honor Code, though their quiz scores
are no worse than the men's. Mandatory proctoring receives
more support from women; other proctoring options, how
ever, are not conspicuously supported by one sex or the
other. Favorable effects of proctoring—e.g., that students
would feel protected—are cited more frequently by women;
men are more likely to respond that an Honor Code would
lose meaning and/or that a meaningful Honor Code would
cease to exist.
The ethnic background tables include both graduates and
undergraduates in order to obtain a statistically comfortable
number of "non-Caucasian" respondents (black, chicano,
Spanish surname, native American, Asian American, or

"other"). The ethnic conglomerate may be meaningless; but,
in any case, being "non-Caucasian" does not relate consis
tently or significantly to any of the behavioral or attitudinal
variables in our study.
Background Variables and the Graduate Sample
The obvious and occasionally interesting differences dis
cussed with respect to our undergraduate respondents are
not, in general, evident among the graduate respondents in
our sample. There are not as many cases, and two areas
(Earth Sciences and H & S Humanities) include too few cases
to allow attention to comparative percentages.
The reader may remember from Section 1 that experience
with and awareness of academic dishonesty is signfficantly
lower among Stanford's graduate student population. One
result of this difference is that is is less rewarding—indeed
discouragint—to examine departmental or other background
variables with respect to the respondent's own cheating or
awareness of it: there are simply too few cases to yield
dependable percentages. Thus we have a reduced set of
variables to examine; however—to the extent that any disci
plinary area stands out as consistently different from the
other two—it is, at the graduate level, that of H & S science
and math students.
Not many variables, even with the reduced set, show
disciplinary differences. Those that do tend to be those
discussed both earlier and later in this report—those items
with respect to which, for a variety of reasons, our sample
respondents seem to differ. On these variables, shown in
tabular form in the appendices, graduate students in H & S
science and math departments come through as personally
moral pessimists.
The differences are neither wholly consistent nor statis
tically awesome, but it appears that the science/math sub
group is more likely to endorse the broadly-stated values of
honesty, to not worry much personally about cheating, and
to cheat less; to perceive less Honor Code support and
knowledge among fellow-students and faculty; and to not
favor the proctoring remedy, anticipating several ill effects.
With flags of caution waving wildly, we close this section
with a few comments about the graduate student population
who are not U.S. citizens. It is a small group (only 18
respondents), and hence the need for caution. The differ
ences in responses between citizens and noncitizens, however,
are surprisingly consistent over a range of variables—unlike
our results with the "non-Caucasian" background variable.
To summarize the tables which appear in the appendices,
value statements which citizens tend to endorse (e.g. "Most
students want to be honest."), noncitizens indicate "Not
Sure"; others which citizens tend to disagree with (e.g.,
"Reporting someone for cheating is worse than cheating"),
noncitizens tend to endorse. They express less commitment
to the Honor Code and perceive less support among other
students. They are less supportive of (or less opinionated
about) various proctoring options, less willing to serve as
proctors, and likely to expect more negative results to follow
the introduction of proctoring. These several areas of differ
ence are not always statistically large, but the fact that
differences consistently appear is deserving of some atten
tion.
Section 3: Some Comparisons Between 1961 and 1976
Before discussing the results of our comparisons over
time, it is appropriate to restate some of the differences
between the studies which restrict the ease with which our
comparisons may safely lead to firm conclusions:
1) The 1961 results are based on only 75 undergraduates,
a 75% response rate from the sample;
2) The 1961 study was nationwide, sponsored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and covered many topics related to
social control processes, whereas our study is internally
sponsored and relatively narrow in scope; and
3) The representation of freshmen in the 1961 survey
was proportional to their population size, which is not true
of 1976 freshmen.
On the positive side, the questions we chose to repeat are
identical in wording and response categories to the 1961
versions; also, background items for which we have other
sources of trend data—e.g., sex, age, grade average, ethnic
background, and type of campus housing—show changes very
similar to those in the questionnaire responses.
We will discuss several interesting comparisons in this
section; attention will focus first, however, on four findings
of special interest to the SCLC.
First, contrary to prevailing opinion, our data show no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976.
Second, current students are more likely to have actually
seen instances of cheating, and to perceive-in a general
way—that more cheating exists, than was true of their
predecessors.
Third, there is a notable drop in expressed support for
value statements concerning honesty, especially those with a
universal tone—e.g., "Under no circumstances is cheating ever
justified."
Fourth, support for the reporting aspect of the Honor
Code has indeed declined; in 1961, about one-quarter of the
sample would, m a hypothetical cheating situation, report the

offender or ask that he report himself—compared to less than
10% who say they would do so in 1976.
Self-Reports of Academic Dishonesty
The fo;lowing self-reports were solicited in 1961 and
1976 with the results shown in the two columns to the right:
Check all the following which you have done at Stanford.
% responding "Yes"
1961 1976
"Padding" a few items on a bibliography 20% 23%
Copying a few sentences of material without
footnoting in a paper 35 35

of doing the work independently 32 28

already taken the same exam 8 13

his knowing about it 16 10

Having another student take an exam for you 0 0

Another set of questions allowed five responses ranging
from "Never" to "Many times"; so few persons, in either
year, selected the fourth or fifth categories, that we show
below only the predominent response categories.

The lack of change shown above is worth notice; where
there are changes—in either direction—they are too small to
warrant serious attention. It is, we believe, a safe conclusion
that self-reported acts of cheating are unchanged between
1961 and 1976. (We should point out that in Bowers' 1961
data, the Stanford level of cheating was found to be very low
in a nation-wide context. Even on those questions which
show an increase between 1961 and 1976, the current
Stanford percent is below the nationwide 1961 sample
percent.)
PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIC
DISHONESTY
Here we see some substantial differences. In both years,
students were asked, "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], have you seen another student cheating during a
test or exam?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 76% 49% Once 12% 9% A few 7% 29%
times
'61 '76 '61 *76

A similar question: "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], has another student indicated to you during a
test or exam that he wanted help?"

Never 88% 78% Once 8% 8% A few
times 3% 11%
Several Many
times 1% 2% times 0% 1%
It seems indisputable that current students are more likely
to have personally witnessed cheating activity. Regardless of
their own experience, they also hold different perceptions of
the extent of academic dishonesty and the functioning of
disciplinary processes. Students in both years were asked to
estimate, in percentage terms, the frequency of the following
events:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage has cheated since coming to Stanford."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-15%) 42% 35%
Medium estimate (16-60%) 37 51
High estimate (above 60%) 21 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheats frequently."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 43% 44%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 45 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 12
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage is discovered."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-4%) 27% 43%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 50 43
High estimate (above 15%) 23 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage is discovered
by the course instructor."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-70%) 32% 47%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 68 34
High estimate (above 97%) 0 19
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarized and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage are reported by
other students."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-10%) 66% 44%
Medium estimate (11-65%) 23 42
High estimate (above 65%) 11 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage report them
selves. "
1961 1976
Low estimate (0%) 59% 69%
Medium estimate (1-10%) 28 26
High estimate (above 10%) 13 6
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 90% 49%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 9 47
High estimate (above 85%) 1 4
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases disciplinary action is taken by the course
instructor.
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-35%) 48% 39%
Medium estimate (36-90%) 40 52
High estimate (above 90%) 12 9
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases the case is passed on to some other authority
for disciplinary action."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-5%) 19% 32%
Medium estimate (6-50%) 39 56
High estimate (above 50%) 42 11
Comparing percentage distributions of percentage esti
mates can be quite confusing. Some differences, however,
come through quite clearly: 1961 respondents estimated a
higher "discovery rate" for cheaters, expected more disco
veries to be made by faculty, and substantially more cheating
cases being passed to authorities beyond the classroom. In
neither year did many students perceive a high level of
self-reporting ("0%" the majority estimate—chosen by 59% in
1961 and 69% currently).
These indicated trends in the percentage estimates are
confirmed by another set of responses elsewhere in the
questionnaire:

Unfortunately, our 1961 data are in the form of com
puter print-out rather than IBM cards, so we are unable to
examine the relationships between these value endorsements
and other variables of obvious interest—like self-reports of
cheating. As we will discuss later in Section 4, 1976 respon
dents who agree strongly with some of these statements are
conspicuously different from their fellow-students in several
other ways as well.
RESPONSES TO HYPOTHETICAL CHEATING SITUA
TIONS
Earlier we examined responses about cheating actually
observed; here we inquire what our responses would do if
they observed cheating.
"Suppose you saw a student cheating on a test or exam.
What would you do?"
1961 1976
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 4% 5%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 22 3
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 36 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 14 33
Ignore the incident 2525
In both years, one-quarter of the students in this hypothe
tical situation would ignore the incident. Also in both years,
the modal choice is to express disapproval but not to report
the offender.
The big change is in the second most popular form of
social control-in 1961, it is to ask the person to report
himself and report him if he doesn't do so, and in 1976 it is
to mention the incident to others but not report it.

"How often have the following things happened that you
knowabout?"

As before, the areas of large change are in perceived
self-reporting and faculty alertness and activity, student
reporting of others is seen to be only slightly less frequent
now.
Student views of faculty are tapped in yet another way,
with consistent differences over time again evident.

Before considering behaviors and perceptions more di
rectly related to the Honor Code, we'll look briefly at some
value statements put to both undergraduate samples.
VALUES ABOUT HONESTY
Here we see some of the largest differences of any found
so far in our several analyses. There can be little doubt that
the changes in the "Agree Strongly" column below, especial
ly for the first two statements, constitute real differences
between our two samples.
Agree Agree Not Disagree Disagree
strongly mildly sure mildly strongly
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76

Reporting someone for cheating
is worse than cheating 3 4 10 7 12 19 38 31 38 38

It may seem surprising that only 26% of the 1961 sample
supported the reporting obligation of the Honor Code; but
other responses show that students also perceived some
student support for reporting in 1961—the combination of
general perception plus 26% commitment may well have
resulted in a social control system that effectively reduced
academic dishonesty.
Another hypothetical situation was posed:
1961 1976
Give him the answer 0% 2%
Say nothing but expose your paper
so he can copy the answer 4 2
Ignore or turn down his request 59 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 32 21
Report him to the appropriate
authorities 5 2
Two categories show 10-15% differences; ignoring or
rejecting such a request is a more popular option now, and
expressing disapproval informally is less popular. Neither
sample views reporting the request with much favor.
Both hypothetical situations were elaborated by changing
the identity of the cheater from an unspecified individual to
"a campus leader" and "a close friend"; the second situation
added a third, "some you disliked personally." In both years,
a friend observed cheating is less likely to be reported and
more likely to be informally disapproved of; campus leaders
>n both years are more severely treated than others—27% of
the 1961 sample, and 17% in 1976, would report him, and
only about 20% would ignore the incident.
For the solicited exam aid situation, our two samples are
similar with the following exceptions; whereas currently 21%
would cooperate with a friend's request, only 7% thought
they would do so in 1961; both samples are more likely to
express disapproval to a friend than to the other specified
offenders, 42% selecting this treatment of a friend in 1961,
and 30% in 1976. For neither sample is reporting a likely
option—even for campus leaders in 1961, the figure is only
7%.
This concludes our review of trend findings of key
interest to the SCLC. We have restricted our interpretive
comments to the analytic variety, indicating which differ
ences seemed, to us, worth serious attention.
Another level of interpretation, however, is needed with
respect to one blatant anomaly: How is it that individual
self-reported cheating is unchanged, but current students
report seeing more cheating than their predecessors? One
possible interpretation is simply that cheating is more conspi
cuous when it does occur; that the change in moral climate,
suggested by the value endorsement data, has both allowed
current cheaters to be more open in their activities and
opened more widely the eyes and ears of noncheaters. To the
extent that our 1976 data permit, we will examine these
possibilities in Section 4. Our aim here is to draw attention to
the phenomenon and encourage speculation.
1961 AND 1976 VIEWS ON THE PURPOSES OF A COL
LEGE EDUCATION
Several questions on the Bowers questionnaire, while not
related to the SCLC task, were so potentially interesting to
repeat 15 years later that we easily yielded to the temptation.
Students were asked to consider a list of purposes of a college
education, to indicate the importance of each purpose to the
respondent, and then to select that purpose considered most
important to the respondent.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Most
Important Purpose
1961 1976
gg Provide a basic general education and
appreciation of ideas
Provide vocational training; develop
skills and techniques directly
applicable to my career
Develop my ability to get along with
different kinds of people
Develop my knowledge and interest in the
® ® community and world problems
Help develop my moral capacities, ethical
® standards and values
Prepare me for a happy marriage
® and family life
Looking at these comparisons, it is hard to believe that 15
turbulent years have passed since the first survey. With two
exceptions, the differences are smaller than pollsters ex
pected to find over a one-week time span! Amidst such
constancy, the two shifts stand out sharply: Current students
attribute somewhat less importance to acquiring knowledge
about world problems (though the change is not large); and
our sample virtually rejects preparation for marriage as an
important purpose of college—in 1961, 53% assigned some
importance to this purpose, compared with 28% today.
With some trepidation, we also repeated the question,
"How well satisfied are you with your educational experience
at Stanford [at this school] ?"
1961 1976
Very well satisfied 38% 24%
Fairly well satisfied 55 63
Not very well satisfied 7 13
Not at all satisfied 0 0
The drop in the top category, while not huge, is big
enough to qualify as real. We did not inquire into reasons for
the respondents' level of satisfaction (nor did Bowers), and
thus cannot help those wishing to interpret or evaluate the
significance of this change.
Section 4: A Closer Look at Self-Reported Cheating
While we know more now about the state of academic
honesty at Stanford than we did prior to the survey, we still
should look closer at the correlates of self-reported cheating
activity.
Our data do not allow us to assign causality and statis
tically test alternative explanations of cheating behavior; we
can, however, change tactics from preceding sections and
focus on different levels of cheating—seeking related variables
that are potentially manipulable, be it by policy or informal
effort.
We make frequent use in this section of the three
"cheating indices" introd - "~ed in Section 1: Cheating Index,
"Serious" Cheating, and Exam Cheating. By cross-tabulating
each index with a wide range of variables, we looked for
differences between the three indices (e.g.. Are those who
admit to serious cheating different from those who admit to

what one SCLC member labeled "dilettante cheating"?), as
well as for differences between self-confessed cheaters of
whatever stripe and noncheaters.
First, we examine the hypothesis that noncheaters are
better informed about the contents of the Honor Code than
are those who cheat. We created a Knowledge Index based on
the quiz-type questions, high scores going to those with a
higher proportion of right answers. Cross-tabulating the
Knowledge Index with each cheating index produced no
difference worth reporting. It appears that our respondents
who cheat know neither more nor less about the Honor Code
than their contemporaries who don't cheat.
Perceived cheating is, not surprisingly, positively related
to self-reported cheating; the indices work similarly, but the
relationship shows most clearly in the example below:
"Since you have been at Stanford, have you seen another
student cheating during a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Never 61% 54% 29%
Once 9 8 9
A few times 23 27 39
Several times 5 7 11
Many times 2 3 12

55 41 40 46 4 13
26 29 47 45 27 26
10 4 43 24 47 72
The biggest difference is between those who are high on
our index (N=s6), versus those who are medium or low. This
pattern reappears in response to the question, "What would
you do if you saw someone cheating on a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 9% 4% 4%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 5 4 0
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 42 37 23
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 28 29 39
Ignore the incident 16 25 34
Similarly, those who admit to having cheated are more
likely to have been asked for help during a test or exam; in
response to such a request, they are more likely to aid the
person or ignore the incident (versus reporting or expressing
disapproval).
Strong differences appear when the cheating index is
cross-tabulated with the three universalistic value statements
(again, all three cheating indices work similarly). The follow
ing table examplifies the differences found with respect to
the other value statements as well.
"Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified."
Cheating Index Score Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 74% 40% 26%
Agree mildly 23 14
Not sure 5 19 24
Disagree mildly 9 27
Disagree strongly 14 9

The differences seen above are substantially reduced when
respondents are asked to indicate their agreement with the
statement: "Honesty is desirable, but currently impossible at
Stanford."
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 10% 8% 11%
Agree mildly 12 16 24
Not sure 21 12 14
Disagree mildly 16 21 22
Disagree strongly 41 43 29
We also find no large differences with respect to level of
commitment to the current Honor Code, or to the serious
ness of the current level of academic dishonesty at Stanford.
There is a modest tendency for noncheaters to prefer proc
toring, but the differences are neither consistently related to
level of self-reported cheating nor larger than about 10%.
With respect to background variables, seniors tend to
appear in the medium and high categories on our scales (52%
of the "highs" are seniors). There is a discernable but
undramatic tendency for social science majors to be high,
engineering and science majors medium, and humanities low.
There is a similar consistent, modest tendency for students
with professional school plans to score higher on our indices
than those planning to attend graduate school.
A final small correlation that is packed with interpretative
potential: Noncheaters are more likely to be "very satisfied"
with their educational experiences at Stanford than respon
dents scoring medium or high (% "very satisfied," 33%, 24%,
and 18% respectively).
Since our largest unexpected differences, both here and in
the 1961 comparisons, have involved three value statements,
we decided to look more closely at our respondents' value
endorsements. We created an index called Strong Values, ana
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each respondent according
to how many times he indicated strong agreement with these
statements:
1) Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified.
2) Students are morally obligated not to cheat.
3) Cheating directly contradicts the goals of education.
Our population split very neatly into the four categories,
about 25% in each.
Our subsequent cross-tabulations yielded interesting re
sults, which we will first summarize, and then examine some
details. Respondents with high scores on our Strong Values
index are much less aware of, involved in, and opinionated
about all matters related to cheating at Stanford. Their
responses to hypothetical cheating situations are very likely
to include expressing disapproval, even to friends (similar to
the 1961 response for the whole sample).
They learn about cheating primarily from official
channels, and about the Honor Code from signing blue
books. They are more likely to indicate strong belief in the
Honor Code, and to believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty constitutes a moderate or serious problem They
do not, however, hold consistently different perceptions of
fellow students or faculty with respect to Honor Code
support, nor are their opinions about specific aspects of the
Honor Code different from their fellow respondents. They
are not conspicuously either for or against proctoring; on
these and other questions soliciting opinions about hypothe
tical effects or the attitudes of others, they are more likely to
check "not sure."
They are, in sum, an interesting, not easily comprehen
sible, group of people—slightly more likely to be female and
majoring in the humanities, unlikely to be seniors, and more
likely to be very satisfied with their educational experience at
Stanford.
The tables that follow show the most impressive of the
differences discussed above. Other tables referred to but not
presented below are in the appendices.

Another section of the questionnaire elicited many speci
fic course characteristics of courses taken winter quarter by
our respondents. Among other things, they were asked about
the extent and types of cheating that occurred in the two
winter courses they liked best, and the one liked least.
Each single cheating item received too few mentions to be
useful to us, so we grouped together all mentions of any type
or level of cheating for the course liked best and created an
index, and similarly for the course liked least. Only 17
nonzero scores are on the first index (mentions of cheating
instances), and 36 on the course-liked-least index. The index
items are:
Respondent personally knew about or learned about. . . .
* Any other students cheating on the final exam, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on tests other than the
final, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on homework or lab
assignments, and/or;
* At least half the other students cheating at one or
another time during the course.
We were interested in learning what types of courses were
likely settings for cheating; by cross-tabulating the other
course characteristics against the index scores, we identified
several characteristics differentiating courses with observed
cheating from other courses.
Those courses liked best in which cheating occurred were
likely to be introductory, have more than 30 students
enrolled, and have short-answer exams (versus open-book,
essay, or take-homes). Past tests were likely to be available
for study purposes, seating was staggered during exams, and
either a TA or the instructor was likely to remain in the room
during exams.
Those observing cheating are likely to be high on our
cheating indices, which supports our earlier conclusion that
those who observe cheating are themselves more likely to
cheat. The course-least-liked index tables show similar results.
On the whole, we suspect that the attempt in this section
to understand better students who cheat and settings con
ducive to cheating events has produced results more useful to
the student of social deviance than to the concerned policy
evaluator.
The characteristics most obviously related to self-reported
cheating are value stances of a special, universalistic sort—a

trait probably not nurtured during the undergraduate years,
or seniors would not be conspicuously absent from the group
of high scorers on our values index.
With respect to the finding that those who cheat are much
more likely to observe other cheating, our data don't allow us
to establish the order of the relationship—i.e., does own
cheating heighten awareness and thus perceptions of others'
cheating, or does one begin cheating in response to observing
it? Probably both processes occur, but we cannot disentangle
them.
One main policy modification, the introduction of op
tional or mandatory proctoring of exams, is not strongly or
consistently favored by our population of noncheaters, nor
by the overlapping subgroup of those high on our values
index. Proctoring already exists in some classes, and our
respondents are more likely to report instances of cheating in
courses with proctored exams.
That does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that
proctoring is ineffective; that students do see cheating in
proctored exam courses may, however, help to explain the
lack of widespread support for proctoring as a solution to the
ills of academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
We have examined, described, and assessed a large amount
of data on Stanford students—their personal honesty, their
valuation of honesty, their experiences with and perceptions
of academic dishonesty among their fellow students, their
concern about cheating, their attitudes toward and know
ledge of the Honor Code, and their opinions about possible
modifications of the current system. What, after all this, can
we safely assert that we know?
First, and perhaps most important, is the conclusion that
Stanford does not currently have a "cheating problem";
those who have worried about a West Point level scandal may
sleep soundly, at least for a while. While cheating continues
to exist in academic endeavors, our data show that the
incidence of self-reported cheating among undergraduates is
approximately the same now as it was in 1961.
The increased selectivity exercised in undergraduate ad
missions may account in part for this lack of change;
although the pressures on students have certainly increased,
the student body includes fewer undergraduates who cannot
cope with the academic demands made of them
The picture is not entirely rosy, however. Indeed, it is
only a slight exaggeration to state that the low incidence of
cheating is independent of the current control system rather
than a result of it. Students are not knowledgeable about the
contents of the Honor Code, nor is the majority highly
committed to it. They similarly perceive their fellow students
and faculty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not
actually indifferent or opposed to it. The crux of the matter
is that the system is not seen to be working.
Students are both more aware of the cheating that does
exist, and less willing to report offenders (or ask them to
report themselves). Nor do they see faculty members filling
the activity gap as either police or advocates. (As our report
on the faculty surveys will state, this perception of the
faculty is essentially correct.)
There is no evidence that personal moral standards have
declined at Stanford, though the willingness to hold others to
universalistic standards seems to have declined substantially.
The 25% of our sample who do endorse the several
universalistic value statements in the questionnaire, and who
are substantially more willing to observe the reporting obliga
tion—these students are not, apparently, very visible or very
vocal among their fellow students. They do not have as much
experience with instances of cheating as the rest of the
sample; and, or course, it may be lack of experience which
permits them to predict that their hypothetical behavior
would differ from that of the majority.
We find no strong support for exam proctoring, even
among those subgroups most aware of and concerned about
levels of cheating.
The minority most exposed to cheating seem to favor
unilateral solutions, while the rest are more likely to reject
proctoring or prefer it as a faculty and/or student option. In
short, both the need to modify the current Honor Code, and
the appropriateness of alternative modifications continue to
be judgmental matters: our data provide no clear answers.
Our own interpretation—and it is merely that—is that
Stanford's Honor Code suffers primarily from invisibility
ignorance and apathy better describe our sample than dis
honesty and anxiety. While some modifications may be in
order (e.g., eliminating the reporting obligation, and per
mitting proctoring at studen' and/or instructor preference), it
is premature to consider abandoning the current system.
An educational program is needed, not simply on the
contents of the Code but also on topics like "What plagiarism
is and how to avoid it." (English and communication have
such a statement and some faculty members, at least, distri
bute copies to their students.)
People who throw out the baby with the bath water are
usually unaware that the baby is there; and until the
presence, characteristics, and value of the Honor Code are
widely known on campus, hasty action—like pulling the
plug—would be both unnecessary and undesirable.
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %
Do you consider yourself to be:
Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 52 46
Not well informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 35 44
The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66
Support it by their behavior? 75 68
Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:
% replying "Yes" to Undergrad Grad
1. "Padding" a few items on a biblio- 23 8
graphy
2. Copying a few sentences of material 35 13
without footnoting in a paper
3. Copying answers from a text or other 28 13

dently
4. Writing a paper for another student 3 3
5. Getting questions or answers from
someone who has already taken the same
exam 13 8
6. Giving answers to other students
during an exam 8 5
7. Arranging with other students to give
or receive answers by use of signals 1 0
8. Arranging to sit next to someone who
will let you copy from him during a test or
exam 4 0
9. Copying from someone's test or exam
paper without his knowing it 10 3
10. Taking an exam for another student 1 0
11. Having another student take an
exam for you 0 0

Because the actions range from trivial to serious, and
these distributions count acts, not individuals, we construc
ted three indices of so-called cheating behavior. The first
index counts the number of respondents who checked at
least one item of the 1 7-item set shown above. The second
index is also a count, but excludes items 1-3 above. The third
index counts examination cheating only (items 5-10, 14-15).
% of respondents

"Serious" cheating (excludes 1-3) 45 27

Our respondent's perceptions of the amount of cheatiny
among their fellow students are most usefully viewed in the
context of their self-reports of cheating, a topic addressed in
Section 4, and in comparison with the 1961 data, discussed
in Section 3. Suffice it to say here that undergraduates
perceive substantially more cheating than do graduate stu
dents:

Respondents were asked to estimate, in percentage terms,
levels and types of cheating, levels of discovered cheating,
types of discipline imposed, etc. It is surprising, given their
differences in personal observation of cheating, that the
percentage estimates provided by graduates and undergradu
ates are quite similar. Some examples follow:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage have cheated since coming to Stanford."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-15%) 35% 53%
Medium estimate (16-50%) 51 38
High estimate (above 15
High estimate (above 50%) 14 10
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheat frequently."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 44% 43%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 44 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 13

"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage are discovered. "
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate <0-4% 43% 41%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 43 41

by the instructor."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-70%) 47% 42%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 34 34
High estimate (above 97%) 19 24
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for
cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 49% 41%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 47 41
High estimate (above 85%) 4 18
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for

of the cases action is taken by the instructor."

Our respondents were asked how they learned about most
of the cases of cheating and plagiarim that they know about.
The student grapevine predominates among undergraduates,
but not for graduates:
Undergrads Grads
Observing the instances yourself 19% 23%
Hearing about them from the offenders 8 4
Hearing about them from other students
on the grapevine 55 33
Hearing about them through official channels
(e.g.. The Daily, Dean's Office,
a faculty member, etc.) 18 40
We turn now to two questions which will be reexamined
from other angles in subsequent sections of this report.
Though not directly addressing Honor Code issues, they
indicate the amount of support for the "reporting obliga
tion"—that observers of cheating report the offenders. The
low support expressed is all the more striking because the
questions pose hypothetical situations:
Suppose you saw a student cheating. What would you do?
Undergrads Grads
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 5% (1) 10%
Ask him to report himself and report him
if he fails to do so 3 ( (3) 10
Express disapproval informally but not
report him 34 (68) 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 33 (5) 17
Ignore the incident 25 (23) 29
Graduates and undergraduates agree about how their
behavior would change were the offender "a close friend":
the undergraduate percentages are shown in parentheses
above. If the offender were "a campus leader," however,
reporting becomes somewhat more likely, increasing to 17%
for undergraduates and 28% for graduates.
The second hypothetical question shows only small differ
ences between graduates and undergraduates; the percentages
below are for the undergraduate respondents.
If someone asked you for help during a test or exam,
what would you do?
Undergrad %
Give him the answer 2
Say nothing but expose your paper so
he can copy the answer 2
Ignore or turn down his request 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 21
Report him to the appropriate authorities 2
If the person seeking help were a friend, the percentage
selecting the first or second option increases to 21%; re
actions to "a campus leader" or "someone you disliked
personally" are not substantially different from those shown
above for an unspecified person.
One question attempts to assess in a global sort of way
"the cheating problem":
"Do you believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty at Stanford poses a serious threat to the academic
process?"
Undergrad %
Yes, very serious 11
Moderately serious 32
Not very serious 55

Graduate student responses differ in that many more
appear in the No Opinion column; when preferences are
expressed, they are in the same direction as those shown
above for undergraduates.
Asked who should serve as exam proctors, class instruc
tors and graduate TAs—in that order—are overwhelmingly
preferred over students from outside the class. Similarly, the
majority of respondents think that students should not
participate in "identifying and selecting from a pool of
potential proctors":

Finally, students were asked what probable effects would
result from instituting exam proctoring. Below we show the
undergraduate responses; where graduate responses are sub
stantially different, they appear in parentheses.

The incident of cheating in other areas would

Students would no longer feel obliged to behave
honestly on examinations 12
We now turn, in the following sections, to more detailed
considerations of the results of our study, broadly and
briskly described above.
Section 2: The Role of Background Characteristics
It is a truism of social research that one can always find
background characteristics of respondents which correlate—at
impressive statistical levels—with the dependent variables
under scrutiny. This study is no exception.
Separately for graduates and undergraduates, we cross
tabulated a range of background characteristics with a long
but selective list of variables concerning values, perceptions,
and behaviors. We found many, many differences; undergrad
uate class, academic department, and—to a lesser extent
graduate school intentions, sex, and citizenship, all show
correlations with many of our value and behavior indicators.
In the interests of brevity, clarity, and progress, we have
selected from this mass of data in two ways: first, only those
findings of central policy interest to the SCLC are being
reported here; and second, only those patterns of relation
ships which are internally consistent will receive attention.
An example which meets the first criterion but fails the
second: Freshmen and sophomores are more likely to know
that the Honor Code prohibits proctoring, but less likely to
agree that the Honor Code "regulates faculty behavior." Both
relationships are statistically significant; viewed together,
however, they don't make sense and are better politely
dismissed than puzzled over (e.g., "It appears that undergrad
uate class is not systematically related to knowledge of
Honor Code contents.")
Tables showing the relationships described in this section
r,ro available in the appendices. Throughout what follows,
"sophomores" should be understood to include our four
token freshmen.
Undergraduate class relates in a variety of ways to several
key variables, especially perceptions of cheating. Honor Code
commitment, and attitudes toward proctoring. Sophomores
have seen less cheating and fewer instances of students
reporting others for cheating; they are, however, slightly
more likely to have seen instructors ignoring cheating behav
ior. Although their self-reported cheating varies only slightly
from that of upperclassmen, sophomores are more likely to
worry about false accusations of cheating.
Sophomores are especially likely to state that the Honor
Code system should be altered, and least likely to describe
themselves as believing strongly in the current system. They
favor the introduction of exam proctoring more than upper
classmen do, especially in classes with enrollments over 30,
and/or in required preprofessional classes.
Sophomores' attitudes and experiences extend to their
perceptions of other students and faculty: they are least
likely to think other students favor continuation of the
current Honor Code; while more likely to believe that faculty
know about the Honor Code and its requirements, they are
least likely to think faculty favor its continuation or support
it by their behavior.
Differences by undergraduate major are, by and large,
inconsistent and statistically small—few exceed 10%. There is
some tendency for respondents in social science departments
to see a world that is consistently slightly different from that
seen by others; the humanities, science, and engineering
students do not generally differ greatly from each other in
patterned or consistent ways.
Social science majors are distinctive in the following
respects: they report having seen more cheating, more often
been asked for help on exams, more often observed an
instructor ignoring cheating, knowing of more instances of
students reporting offenders, and more likely to think that
the current level of academic dishonesty poses a serious
threat to the educational process.
Their self-reports of cheating are high on three of the six
items where area of major shows a difference; unlike the
other disciplinary areas, they are low on no item. They do
not, however, conspicuously favor exam proctoring; indeed,
they are least willing to proctor "as a University obligation,"
though the percent willing doubles "if paid" (the other
disciplinary areas show a decrease in willingness if proctoring
were a paid job). While not especially in favor of any of the
proctoring options, social science majors are least likely to
believe that an effect of proctoring would be that "the Honor
Code would lose meaning."
Many of the areas in which social science majors differ
from our other undergraduate respondents also differentiate
between undergraduates with professional school versus grad
uate school intentions.
On all variables relating to knowledge of cheating, general
perceptions of the extent of cheating, and self-reported
cheating, either no differences appear or the profession
oriented students are higher—i.e., more aware of cheating and
higher rates of self-reported cheating.
On the Honor Code quiz, profession-oriented students are
less likely to know that exam proctoring is prohibited; later
questions show them to be more in favor of mandatory
proctoring, slightly more willing to proctor as an obligation,
and much more willing to proctor if paid to do so.
The two groups also differ in the results they would
expect from proctoring: graduate school-oriented students
believe that students would feel threatened, while the profes
sion-oriented think that "feeling protected" is a more likely
outcome.
Sex and ethnic background are generally unrewarding
variables in this study. Two self-reported cheating items, both
referring to copying from another's paper during an exam,
show women less likely—by 10% or more—to cheat in this
fashion.
Women are more likely to consider themselves "not well
informed" about the Honor Code, though their quiz scores
are no worse than the men's. Mandatory proctoring receives
more support from women; other proctoring options, how
ever, are not conspicuously supported by one sex or the
other. Favorable effects of proctoring—e.g., that students
would feel protected—are cited more frequently by women;
men are more likely to respond that an Honor Code would
lose meaning and/or that a meaningful Honor Code would
cease to exist.
The ethnic background tables include both graduates and
undergraduates in order to obtain a statistically comfortable
number of "non-Caucasian" respondents (black, chicano,
Spanish surname, native American, Asian American, or

"other"). The ethnic conglomerate may be meaningless; but,
in any case, being "non-Caucasian" does not relate consis
tently or significantly to any of the behavioral or attitudinal
variables in our study.
Background Variables and the Graduate Sample
The obvious and occasionally interesting differences dis
cussed with respect to our undergraduate respondents are
not, in general, evident among the graduate respondents in
our sample. There are not as many cases, and two areas
(Earth Sciences and H & S Humanities) include too few cases
to allow attention to comparative percentages.
The reader may remember from Section 1 that experience
with and awareness of academic dishonesty is signfficantly
lower among Stanford's graduate student population. One
result of this difference is that is is less rewarding—indeed
discouragint—to examine departmental or other background
variables with respect to the respondent's own cheating or
awareness of it: there are simply too few cases to yield
dependable percentages. Thus we have a reduced set of
variables to examine; however—to the extent that any disci
plinary area stands out as consistently different from the
other two—it is, at the graduate level, that of H & S science
and math students.
Not many variables, even with the reduced set, show
disciplinary differences. Those that do tend to be those
discussed both earlier and later in this report—those items
with respect to which, for a variety of reasons, our sample
respondents seem to differ. On these variables, shown in
tabular form in the appendices, graduate students in H & S
science and math departments come through as personally
moral pessimists.
The differences are neither wholly consistent nor statis
tically awesome, but it appears that the science/math sub
group is more likely to endorse the broadly-stated values of
honesty, to not worry much personally about cheating, and
to cheat less; to perceive less Honor Code support and
knowledge among fellow-students and faculty; and to not
favor the proctoring remedy, anticipating several ill effects.
With flags of caution waving wildly, we close this section
with a few comments about the graduate student population
who are not U.S. citizens. It is a small group (only 18
respondents), and hence the need for caution. The differ
ences in responses between citizens and noncitizens, however,
are surprisingly consistent over a range of variables—unlike
our results with the "non-Caucasian" background variable.
To summarize the tables which appear in the appendices,
value statements which citizens tend to endorse (e.g. "Most
students want to be honest."), noncitizens indicate "Not
Sure"; others which citizens tend to disagree with (e.g.,
"Reporting someone for cheating is worse than cheating"),
noncitizens tend to endorse. They express less commitment
to the Honor Code and perceive less support among other
students. They are less supportive of (or less opinionated
about) various proctoring options, less willing to serve as
proctors, and likely to expect more negative results to follow
the introduction of proctoring. These several areas of differ
ence are not always statistically large, but the fact that
differences consistently appear is deserving of some atten
tion.
Section 3: Some Comparisons Between 1961 and 1976
Before discussing the results of our comparisons over
time, it is appropriate to restate some of the differences
between the studies which restrict the ease with which our
comparisons may safely lead to firm conclusions:
1) The 1961 results are based on only 75 undergraduates,
a 75% response rate from the sample;
2) The 1961 study was nationwide, sponsored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and covered many topics related to
social control processes, whereas our study is internally
sponsored and relatively narrow in scope; and
3) The representation of freshmen in the 1961 survey
was proportional to their population size, which is not true
of 1976 freshmen.
On the positive side, the questions we chose to repeat are
identical in wording and response categories to the 1961
versions; also, background items for which we have other
sources of trend data—e.g., sex, age, grade average, ethnic
background, and type of campus housing—show changes very
similar to those in the questionnaire responses.
We will discuss several interesting comparisons in this
section; attention will focus first, however, on four findings
of special interest to the SCLC.
First, contrary to prevailing opinion, our data show no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976.
Second, current students are more likely to have actually
seen instances of cheating, and to perceive-in a general
way—that more cheating exists, than was true of their
predecessors.
Third, there is a notable drop in expressed support for
value statements concerning honesty, especially those with a
universal tone—e.g., "Under no circumstances is cheating ever
justified."
Fourth, support for the reporting aspect of the Honor
Code has indeed declined; in 1961, about one-quarter of the
sample would, m a hypothetical cheating situation, report the

offender or ask that he report himself—compared to less than
10% who say they would do so in 1976.
Self-Reports of Academic Dishonesty
The fo;lowing self-reports were solicited in 1961 and
1976 with the results shown in the two columns to the right:
Check all the following which you have done at Stanford.
% responding "Yes"
1961 1976
"Padding" a few items on a bibliography 20% 23%
Copying a few sentences of material without
footnoting in a paper 35 35
Copying answers from a text or other source instead
of doing the work independently 32 28
Writing a paper for another student 3 3
Getting questions or answers from someone who has
already taken the same exam 8 13
Giving answers to other students during an exam 7 8
Arranging with other students to give or receive
answers by use of signals 0 1
Arranging to sit next to someone who will let you

his knowing about it 16 10
Taking an exam for another student 0 1
Having another student take an exam for you 0 0
Working on the same homework with several students
when the teacher does not allow it 16 12
Another set of questions allowed five responses ranging
from "Never" to "Many times"; so few persons, in either
year, selected the fourth or fifth categories, that we show
below only the predominent response categories.

The lack of change shown above is worth notice; where
there are changes—in either direction—they are too small to
warrant serious attention. It is, we believe, a safe conclusion
that self-reported acts of cheating are unchanged between
1961 and 1976. (We should point out that in Bowers' 1961
data, the Stanford level of cheating was found to be very low
in a nation-wide context. Even on those questions which
show an increase between 1961 and 1976, the current
Stanford percent is below the nationwide 1961 sample
percent.)
PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIC
DISHONESTY
Here we see some substantial differences. In both years,
students were asked, "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], have you seen another student cheating during a
test or exam?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 76% 49% Once 12% 9% A few 7% 29%
times
'61 '76 '61 *76
Several

times
A similar question: "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], has another student indicated to you during a
test or exam that he wanted help?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 88% 78% Once 8% 8% A few
times 3% 11%
Several Many
times 1% 2% times 0% 1%
It seems indisputable that current students are more likely
to have personally witnessed cheating activity. Regardless of
their own experience, they also hold different perceptions of
the extent of academic dishonesty and the functioning of
disciplinary processes. Students in both years were asked to
estimate, in percentage terms, the frequency of the following
events:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage has cheated since coming to Stanford."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-15%) 42% 35%
Medium estimate (16-60%) 37 51
High estimate (above 60%) 21 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheats frequently."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 43% 44%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 45 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 12
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage is discovered."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-4%) 27% 43%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 50 43
High estimate (above 15%) 23 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage is discovered
by the course instructor."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-70%) 32% 47%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 68 34
High estimate (above 97%) 0 19
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarized and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage are reported by
other students."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-10%) 66% 44%
Medium estimate (11-65%) 23 42
High estimate (above 65%) 11 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage report them
selves. "
1961 1976
Low estimate (0%) 59% 69%
Medium estimate (1-10%) 28 26
High estimate (above 10%) 13 6
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 90% 49%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 9 47
High estimate (above 85%) 1 4
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases disciplinary action is taken by the course
instructor.
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-35%) 48% 39%
Medium estimate (36-90%) 40 52
High estimate (above 90%) 12 9
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases the case is passed on to some other authority
for disciplinary action."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-5%) 19% 32%
Medium estimate (6-50%) 39 56
High estimate (above 50%) 42 11
Comparing percentage distributions of percentage esti
mates can be quite confusing. Some differences, however,
come through quite clearly: 1961 respondents estimated a
higher "discovery rate" for cheaters, expected more disco
veries to be made by faculty, and substantially more cheating
cases being passed to authorities beyond the classroom. In
neither year did many students perceive a high level of
self-reporting ("0%" the majority estimate—chosen by 59% in
1961 and 69% currently).
These indicated trends in the percentage estimates are
confirmed by another set of responses elsewhere in the
questionnaire:

Unfortunately, our 1961 data are in the form of com
puter print-out rather than IBM cards, so we are unable to
examine the relationships between these value endorsements
and other variables of obvious interest—like self-reports of
cheating. As we will discuss later in Section 4, 1976 respon
dents who agree strongly with some of these statements are
conspicuously different from their fellow-students in several
other ways as well.
RESPONSES TO HYPOTHETICAL CHEATING SITUA
TIONS
Earlier we examined responses about cheating actually
observed; here we inquire what our responses would do if
they observed cheating.
"Suppose you saw a student cheating on a test or exam.
What would you do?"
1961 1976
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 4% 5%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 22 3
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 36 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 14 33
Ignore the incident 2525
In both years, one-quarter of the students in this hypothe
tical situation would ignore the incident. Also in both years,
the modal choice is to express disapproval but not to report
the offender.
The big change is in the second most popular form of
social control-in 1961, it is to ask the person to report
himself and report him if he doesn't do so, and in 1976 it is
to mention the incident to others but not report it.

"How often have the following things happened that you
knowabout?"

As before, the areas of large change are in perceived
self-reporting and faculty alertness and activity, student
reporting of others is seen to be only slightly less frequent
now.
Student views of faculty are tapped in yet another way,
with consistent differences over time again evident.

Before considering behaviors and perceptions more di
rectly related to the Honor Code, we'll look briefly at some
value statements put to both undergraduate samples.
VALUES ABOUT HONESTY
Here we see some of the largest differences of any found
so far in our several analyses. There can be little doubt that
the changes in the "Agree Strongly" column below, especial
ly for the first two statements, constitute real differences
between our two samples.
Agree Agree Not Disagree Disagree
strongly mildly sure mildly strongly
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76

Reporting someone for cheating
is worse than cheating 3 4 10 7 12 19 38 31 38 38

It may seem surprising that only 26% of the 1961 sample
supported the reporting obligation of the Honor Code; but
other responses show that students also perceived some
student support for reporting in 1961—the combination of
general perception plus 26% commitment may well have
resulted in a social control system that effectively reduced
academic dishonesty.
Another hypothetical situation was posed:
1961 1976
Give him the answer 0% 2%
Say nothing but expose your paper
so he can copy the answer 4 2
Ignore or turn down his request 59 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 32 21
Report him to the appropriate
authorities 5 2
Two categories show 10-15% differences; ignoring or
rejecting such a request is a more popular option now, and
expressing disapproval informally is less popular. Neither
sample views reporting the request with much favor.
Both hypothetical situations were elaborated by changing
the identity of the cheater from an unspecified individual to
"a campus leader" and "a close friend"; the second situation
added a third, "some you disliked personally." In both years,
a friend observed cheating is less likely to be reported and
more likely to be informally disapproved of; campus leaders
>n both years are more severely treated than others—27% of
the 1961 sample, and 17% in 1976, would report him, and
only about 20% would ignore the incident.
For the solicited exam aid situation, our two samples are
similar with the following exceptions; whereas currently 21%
would cooperate with a friend's request, only 7% thought
they would do so in 1961; both samples are more likely to
express disapproval to a friend than to the other specified
offenders, 42% selecting this treatment of a friend in 1961,
and 30% in 1976. For neither sample is reporting a likely
option—even for campus leaders in 1961, the figure is only
7%.
This concludes our review of trend findings of key
interest to the SCLC. We have restricted our interpretive
comments to the analytic variety, indicating which differ
ences seemed, to us, worth serious attention.
Another level of interpretation, however, is needed with
respect to one blatant anomaly: How is it that individual
self-reported cheating is unchanged, but current students
report seeing more cheating than their predecessors? One
possible interpretation is simply that cheating is more conspi
cuous when it does occur; that the change in moral climate,
suggested by the value endorsement data, has both allowed
current cheaters to be more open in their activities and
opened more widely the eyes and ears of noncheaters. To the
extent that our 1976 data permit, we will examine these
possibilities in Section 4. Our aim here is to draw attention to
the phenomenon and encourage speculation.
1961 AND 1976 VIEWS ON THE PURPOSES OF A COL
LEGE EDUCATION
Several questions on the Bowers questionnaire, while not
related to the SCLC task, were so potentially interesting to
repeat 15 years later that we easily yielded to the temptation.
Students were asked to consider a list of purposes of a college
education, to indicate the importance of each purpose to the
respondent, and then to select that purpose considered most
important to the respondent.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Most
Important Purpose
1961 1976
gg Provide a basic general education and
appreciation of ideas
Provide vocational training; develop
skills and techniques directly
applicable to my career
Develop my ability to get along with
different kinds of people
Develop my knowledge and interest in the
® ® community and world problems
Help develop my moral capacities, ethical
® standards and values
Prepare me for a happy marriage
® and family life
Looking at these comparisons, it is hard to believe that 15
turbulent years have passed since the first survey. With two
exceptions, the differences are smaller than pollsters ex
pected to find over a one-week time span! Amidst such
constancy, the two shifts stand out sharply: Current students
attribute somewhat less importance to acquiring knowledge
about world problems (though the change is not large); and
our sample virtually rejects preparation for marriage as an
important purpose of college—in 1961, 53% assigned some
importance to this purpose, compared with 28% today.
With some trepidation, we also repeated the question,
"How well satisfied are you with your educational experience
at Stanford [at this school] ?"
1961 1976
Very well satisfied 38% 24%
Fairly well satisfied 55 63
Not very well satisfied 7 13
Not at all satisfied 0 0
The drop in the top category, while not huge, is big
enough to qualify as real. We did not inquire into reasons for
the respondents' level of satisfaction (nor did Bowers), and
thus cannot help those wishing to interpret or evaluate the
significance of this change.
Section 4: A Closer Look at Self-Reported Cheating
While we know more now about the state of academic
honesty at Stanford than we did prior to the survey, we still
should look closer at the correlates of self-reported cheating
activity.
Our data do not allow us to assign causality and statis
tically test alternative explanations of cheating behavior; we
can, however, change tactics from preceding sections and
focus on different levels of cheating—seeking related variables
that are potentially manipulable, be it by policy or informal
effort.
We make frequent use in this section of the three
"cheating indices" introd - "~ed in Section 1: Cheating Index,
"Serious" Cheating, and Exam Cheating. By cross-tabulating
each index with a wide range of variables, we looked for
differences between the three indices (e.g.. Are those who
admit to serious cheating different from those who admit to

what one SCLC member labeled "dilettante cheating"?), as
well as for differences between self-confessed cheaters of
whatever stripe and noncheaters.
First, we examine the hypothesis that noncheaters are
better informed about the contents of the Honor Code than
are those who cheat. We created a Knowledge Index based on
the quiz-type questions, high scores going to those with a
higher proportion of right answers. Cross-tabulating the
Knowledge Index with each cheating index produced no
difference worth reporting. It appears that our respondents
who cheat know neither more nor less about the Honor Code
than their contemporaries who don't cheat.
Perceived cheating is, not surprisingly, positively related
to self-reported cheating; the indices work similarly, but the
relationship shows most clearly in the example below:
"Since you have been at Stanford, have you seen another
student cheating during a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Never 61% 54% 29%
Once 9 8 9
A few times 23 27 39
Several times 5 7 11
Many times 2 3 12
Very Fairly Not very
Important Important Important

55 41 40 46 4 13
26 29 47 45 27 26
10 4 43 24 47 72
The biggest difference is between those who are high on
our index (N=s6), versus those who are medium or low. This
pattern reappears in response to the question, "What would
you do if you saw someone cheating on a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 9% 4% 4%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 5 4 0
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 42 37 23
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 28 29 39
Ignore the incident 16 25 34
Similarly, those who admit to having cheated are more
likely to have been asked for help during a test or exam; in
response to such a request, they are more likely to aid the
person or ignore the incident (versus reporting or expressing
disapproval).
Strong differences appear when the cheating index is
cross-tabulated with the three universalistic value statements
(again, all three cheating indices work similarly). The follow
ing table examplifies the differences found with respect to
the other value statements as well.
"Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified."
Cheating Index Score Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 74% 40% 26%
Agree mildly 23 14
Not sure 5 19 24
Disagree mildly 9 27
Disagree strongly 14 9

The differences seen above are substantially reduced when
respondents are asked to indicate their agreement with the
statement: "Honesty is desirable, but currently impossible at
Stanford."
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 10% 8% 11%
Agree mildly 12 16 24
Not sure 21 12 14
Disagree mildly 16 21 22
Disagree strongly 41 43 29
We also find no large differences with respect to level of
commitment to the current Honor Code, or to the serious
ness of the current level of academic dishonesty at Stanford.
There is a modest tendency for noncheaters to prefer proc
toring, but the differences are neither consistently related to
level of self-reported cheating nor larger than about 10%.
With respect to background variables, seniors tend to
appear in the medium and high categories on our scales (52%
of the "highs" are seniors). There is a discernable but
undramatic tendency for social science majors to be high,
engineering and science majors medium, and humanities low.
There is a similar consistent, modest tendency for students
with professional school plans to score higher on our indices
than those planning to attend graduate school.
A final small correlation that is packed with interpretative
potential: Noncheaters are more likely to be "very satisfied"
with their educational experiences at Stanford than respon
dents scoring medium or high (% "very satisfied," 33%, 24%,
and 18% respectively).
Since our largest unexpected differences, both here and in
the 1961 comparisons, have involved three value statements,
we decided to look more closely at our respondents' value
endorsements. We created an index called Strong Values, ana
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each respondent according
to how many times he indicated strong agreement with these
statements:
1) Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified.
2) Students are morally obligated not to cheat.
3) Cheating directly contradicts the goals of education.
Our population split very neatly into the four categories,
about 25% in each.
Our subsequent cross-tabulations yielded interesting re
sults, which we will first summarize, and then examine some
details. Respondents with high scores on our Strong Values
index are much less aware of, involved in, and opinionated
about all matters related to cheating at Stanford. Their
responses to hypothetical cheating situations are very likely
to include expressing disapproval, even to friends (similar to
the 1961 response for the whole sample).
They learn about cheating primarily from official
channels, and about the Honor Code from signing blue
books. They are more likely to indicate strong belief in the
Honor Code, and to believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty constitutes a moderate or serious problem They
do not, however, hold consistently different perceptions of
fellow students or faculty with respect to Honor Code
support, nor are their opinions about specific aspects of the
Honor Code different from their fellow respondents. They
are not conspicuously either for or against proctoring; on
these and other questions soliciting opinions about hypothe
tical effects or the attitudes of others, they are more likely to
check "not sure."
They are, in sum, an interesting, not easily comprehen
sible, group of people—slightly more likely to be female and
majoring in the humanities, unlikely to be seniors, and more
likely to be very satisfied with their educational experience at
Stanford.

Another section of the questionnaire elicited many speci
fic course characteristics of courses taken winter quarter by
our respondents. Among other things, they were asked about
the extent and types of cheating that occurred in the two
winter courses they liked best, and the one liked least.
Each single cheating item received too few mentions to be
useful to us, so we grouped together all mentions of any type
or level of cheating for the course liked best and created an
index, and similarly for the course liked least. Only 17
nonzero scores are on the first index (mentions of cheating
instances), and 36 on the course-liked-least index. The index
items are:
Respondent personally knew about or learned about. . . .
* Any other students cheating on the final exam, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on tests other than the
final, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on homework or lab
assignments, and/or;
* At least half the other students cheating at one or
another time during the course.
We were interested in learning what types of courses were
likely settings for cheating; by cross-tabulating the other
course characteristics against the index scores, we identified
several characteristics differentiating courses with observed
cheating from other courses.
Those courses liked best in which cheating occurred were
likely to be introductory, have more than 30 students
enrolled, and have short-answer exams (versus open-book,
essay, or take-homes). Past tests were likely to be available
for study purposes, seating was staggered during exams, and
either a TA or the instructor was likely to remain in the room
during exams.
Those observing cheating are likely to be high on our
cheating indices, which supports our earlier conclusion that
those who observe cheating are themselves more likely to
cheat. The course-least-liked index tables show similar results.
On the whole, we suspect that the attempt in this section
to understand better students who cheat and settings con
ducive to cheating events has produced results more useful to
the student of social deviance than to the concerned policy
evaluator.
The characteristics most obviously related to self-reported
cheating are value stances of a special, universalistic sort—a

trait probably not nurtured during the undergraduate years,
or seniors would not be conspicuously absent from the group
of high scorers on our values index.
With respect to the finding that those who cheat are much
more likely to observe other cheating, our data don't allow us
to establish the order of the relationship—i.e., does own
cheating heighten awareness and thus perceptions of others'
cheating, or does one begin cheating in response to observing
it? Probably both processes occur, but we cannot disentangle
them.
One main policy modification, the introduction of op
tional or mandatory proctoring of exams, is not strongly or
consistently favored by our population of noncheaters, nor
by the overlapping subgroup of those high on our values
index. Proctoring already exists in some classes, and our
respondents are more likely to report instances of cheating in
courses with proctored exams.
That does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that
proctoring is ineffective; that students do see cheating in
proctored exam courses may, however, help to explain the
lack of widespread support for proctoring as a solution to the
ills of academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
We have examined, described, and assessed a large amount
of data on Stanford students—their personal honesty, their
valuation of honesty, their experiences with and perceptions
of academic dishonesty among their fellow students, their
concern about cheating, their attitudes toward and know
ledge of the Honor Code, and their opinions about possible
modifications of the current system. What, after all this, can
we safely assert that we know?
First, and perhaps most important, is the conclusion that
Stanford does not currently have a "cheating problem";
those who have worried about a West Point level scandal may
sleep soundly, at least for a while. While cheating continues
to exist in academic endeavors, our data show that the
incidence of self-reported cheating among undergraduates is
approximately the same now as it was in 1961.
The increased selectivity exercised in undergraduate ad
missions may account in part for this lack of change;
although the pressures on students have certainly increased,
the student body includes fewer undergraduates who cannot
cope with the academic demands made of them
The picture is not entirely rosy, however. Indeed, it is
only a slight exaggeration to state that the low incidence of
cheating is independent of the current control system rather
than a result of it. Students are not knowledgeable about the
contents of the Honor Code, nor is the majority highly
committed to it. They similarly perceive their fellow students
and faculty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not
actually indifferent or opposed to it. The crux of the matter
is that the system is not seen to be working.
Students are both more aware of the cheating that does
exist, and less willing to report offenders (or ask them to
report themselves). Nor do they see faculty members filling
the activity gap as either police or advocates. (As our report
on the faculty surveys will state, this perception of the
faculty is essentially correct.)
There is no evidence that personal moral standards have
declined at Stanford, though the willingness to hold others to
universalistic standards seems to have declined substantially.
The 25% of our sample who do endorse the several
universalistic value statements in the questionnaire, and who
are substantially more willing to observe the reporting obliga
tion—these students are not, apparently, very visible or very
vocal among their fellow students. They do not have as much
experience with instances of cheating as the rest of the
sample; and, or course, it may be lack of experience which
permits them to predict that their hypothetical behavior
would differ from that of the majority.
We find no strong support for exam proctoring, even
among those subgroups most aware of and concerned about
levels of cheating.
The minority most exposed to cheating seem to favor
unilateral solutions, while the rest are more likely to reject
proctoring or prefer it as a faculty and/or student option. In
short, both the need to modify the current Honor Code, and
the appropriateness of alternative modifications continue to
be judgmental matters: our data provide no clear answers.
Our own interpretation—and it is merely that—is that
Stanford's Honor Code suffers primarily from invisibility
ignorance and apathy better describe our sample than dis
honesty and anxiety. While some modifications may be in
order (e.g., eliminating the reporting obligation, and per
mitting proctoring at studen' and/or instructor preference), it
is premature to consider abandoning the current system.
An educational program is needed, not simply on the
contents of the Code but also on topics like "What plagiarism
is and how to avoid it." (English and communication have
such a statement and some faculty members, at least, distri
bute copies to their students.)
People who throw out the baby with the bath water are
usually unaware that the baby is there; and until the
presence, characteristics, and value of the Honor Code are
widely known on campus, hasty action—like pulling the
plug—would be both unnecessary and undesirable.
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %
Do you consider yourself to be:
Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 52 46
Not well informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 35 44
The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66
Support it by their behavior? 75 68
Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:
% replying "Yes" to Undergrad Grad
1. "Padding" a few items on a biblio- 23 8
graphy
2. Copying a few sentences of material 35 13
without footnoting in a paper
3. Copying answers from a text or other 28 13
source instead of doing the work indepen
dently
4. Writing a paper for another student 3 3
5. Getting questions or answers from
someone who has already taken the same
exam 13 8
6. Giving answers to other students
during an exam 8 5
7. Arranging with other students to give
or receive answers by use of signals 1 0
8. Arranging to sit next to someone who
will let you copy from him during a test or
exam 4 0
9. Copying from someone's test or exam
paper without his knowing it 10 3
10. Taking an exam for another student 1 0
11. Having another student take an
exam for you 0 0
12. Working on the same homework

not allow it 12 12

Because the actions range from trivial to serious, and
these distributions count acts, not individuals, we construc
ted three indices of so-called cheating behavior. The first
index counts the number of respondents who checked at
least one item of the 1 7-item set shown above. The second
index is also a count, but excludes items 1-3 above. The third
index counts examination cheating only (items 5-10, 14-15).

Our respondent's perceptions of the amount of cheatiny
among their fellow students are most usefully viewed in the
context of their self-reports of cheating, a topic addressed in
Section 4, and in comparison with the 1961 data, discussed
in Section 3. Suffice it to say here that undergraduates
perceive substantially more cheating than do graduate stu
dents:

Respondents were asked to estimate, in percentage terms,
levels and types of cheating, levels of discovered cheating,
types of discipline imposed, etc. It is surprising, given their
differences in personal observation of cheating, that the
percentage estimates provided by graduates and undergradu
ates are quite similar. Some examples follow:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage have cheated since coming to Stanford."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-15%) 35% 53%
Medium estimate (16-50%) 51 38
High estimate (above 15
High estimate (above 50%) 14 10
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheat frequently."
Undergrad Grad

High estimate (above 75%) 12 13

"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage are discovered. "
Undergrad Grad

Medium estimate (5-15%) 43 41

by the instructor."

Medium estimate (71-97%) 34 34
High estimate (above 97%) 19 24
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for
cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 49% 41%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 47 41
High estimate (above 85%) 4 18
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for

of the cases action is taken by the instructor."

Our respondents were asked how they learned about most
of the cases of cheating and plagiarim that they know about.
The student grapevine predominates among undergraduates,
but not for graduates:
Undergrads Grads
Observing the instances yourself 19% 23%
Hearing about them from the offenders 8 4
Hearing about them from other students
on the grapevine 55 33
Hearing about them through official channels
(e.g.. The Daily, Dean's Office,
a faculty member, etc.) 18 40
We turn now to two questions which will be reexamined
from other angles in subsequent sections of this report.
Though not directly addressing Honor Code issues, they
indicate the amount of support for the "reporting obliga
tion"—that observers of cheating report the offenders. The
low support expressed is all the more striking because the
questions pose hypothetical situations:
Suppose you saw a student cheating. What would you do?
Undergrads Grads
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 5% (1) 10%
Ask him to report himself and report him
if he fails to do so 3 ( (3) 10
Express disapproval informally but not
report him 34 (68) 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 33 (5) 17
Ignore the incident 25 (23) 29
Graduates and undergraduates agree about how their
behavior would change were the offender "a close friend":
the undergraduate percentages are shown in parentheses
above. If the offender were "a campus leader," however,
reporting becomes somewhat more likely, increasing to 17%
for undergraduates and 28% for graduates.
The second hypothetical question shows only small differ
ences between graduates and undergraduates; the percentages
below are for the undergraduate respondents.
If someone asked you for help during a test or exam,
what would you do?
Undergrad %
Give him the answer 2
Say nothing but expose your paper so
he can copy the answer 2
Ignore or turn down his request 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 21
Report him to the appropriate authorities 2
If the person seeking help were a friend, the percentage
selecting the first or second option increases to 21%; re
actions to "a campus leader" or "someone you disliked
personally" are not substantially different from those shown
above for an unspecified person.
One question attempts to assess in a global sort of way
"the cheating problem":
"Do you believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty at Stanford poses a serious threat to the academic
process?"
Undergrad %
Yes, very serious 11
Moderately serious 32
Not very serious 55

Graduate student responses differ in that many more
appear in the No Opinion column; when preferences are
expressed, they are in the same direction as those shown
above for undergraduates.
Asked who should serve as exam proctors, class instruc
tors and graduate TAs—in that order—are overwhelmingly

Finally, students were asked what probable effects would
result from instituting exam proctoring. Below we show the
undergraduate responses; where graduate responses are sub
stantially different, they appear in parentheses.

A meaningful Honor Code would cease to exist 47 (26)

of trust 44 ( 32)
Students would feel protected from a
minority of dishonest students 43
The incident of cheating in other areas would
increase (e.g., take-home exams, lab reports). 16
Students would no longer feel obliged to behave
honestly on examinations 12
We now turn, in the following sections, to more detailed
considerations of the results of our study, broadly and
briskly described above.
Section 2: The Role of Background Characteristics
It is a truism of social research that one can always find
background characteristics of respondents which correlate—at
impressive statistical levels—with the dependent variables
under scrutiny. This study is no exception.
Separately for graduates and undergraduates, we cross
tabulated a range of background characteristics with a long
but selective list of variables concerning values, perceptions,
and behaviors. We found many, many differences; undergrad
uate class, academic department, and—to a lesser extent
graduate school intentions, sex, and citizenship, all show
correlations with many of our value and behavior indicators.
In the interests of brevity, clarity, and progress, we have
selected from this mass of data in two ways: first, only those
findings of central policy interest to the SCLC are being
reported here; and second, only those patterns of relation
ships which are internally consistent will receive attention.
An example which meets the first criterion but fails the
second: Freshmen and sophomores are more likely to know
that the Honor Code prohibits proctoring, but less likely to
agree that the Honor Code "regulates faculty behavior." Both
relationships are statistically significant; viewed together,
however, they don't make sense and are better politely
dismissed than puzzled over (e.g., "It appears that undergrad
uate class is not systematically related to knowledge of
Honor Code contents.")
Tables showing the relationships described in this section
r,ro available in the appendices. Throughout what follows,
"sophomores" should be understood to include our four
token freshmen.
Undergraduate class relates in a variety of ways to several
key variables, especially perceptions of cheating. Honor Code
commitment, and attitudes toward proctoring. Sophomores
have seen less cheating and fewer instances of students
reporting others for cheating; they are, however, slightly
more likely to have seen instructors ignoring cheating behav
ior. Although their self-reported cheating varies only slightly
from that of upperclassmen, sophomores are more likely to
worry about false accusations of cheating.
Sophomores are especially likely to state that the Honor
Code system should be altered, and least likely to describe
themselves as believing strongly in the current system. They
favor the introduction of exam proctoring more than upper
classmen do, especially in classes with enrollments over 30,
and/or in required preprofessional classes.
Sophomores' attitudes and experiences extend to their
perceptions of other students and faculty: they are least
likely to think other students favor continuation of the
current Honor Code; while more likely to believe that faculty
know about the Honor Code and its requirements, they are
least likely to think faculty favor its continuation or support
it by their behavior.
Differences by undergraduate major are, by and large,
inconsistent and statistically small—few exceed 10%. There is
some tendency for respondents in social science departments
to see a world that is consistently slightly different from that
seen by others; the humanities, science, and engineering
students do not generally differ greatly from each other in
patterned or consistent ways.
Social science majors are distinctive in the following
respects: they report having seen more cheating, more often
been asked for help on exams, more often observed an
instructor ignoring cheating, knowing of more instances of
students reporting offenders, and more likely to think that
the current level of academic dishonesty poses a serious
threat to the educational process.
Their self-reports of cheating are high on three of the six
items where area of major shows a difference; unlike the
other disciplinary areas, they are low on no item. They do
not, however, conspicuously favor exam proctoring; indeed,
they are least willing to proctor "as a University obligation,"
though the percent willing doubles "if paid" (the other
disciplinary areas show a decrease in willingness if proctoring
were a paid job). While not especially in favor of any of the
proctoring options, social science majors are least likely to
believe that an effect of proctoring would be that "the Honor
Code would lose meaning."
Many of the areas in which social science majors differ
from our other undergraduate respondents also differentiate
between undergraduates with professional school versus grad
uate school intentions.
On all variables relating to knowledge of cheating, general
perceptions of the extent of cheating, and self-reported
cheating, either no differences appear or the profession
oriented students are higher—i.e., more aware of cheating and
higher rates of self-reported cheating.
On the Honor Code quiz, profession-oriented students are
less likely to know that exam proctoring is prohibited; later
questions show them to be more in favor of mandatory
proctoring, slightly more willing to proctor as an obligation,
and much more willing to proctor if paid to do so.
The two groups also differ in the results they would
expect from proctoring: graduate school-oriented students
believe that students would feel threatened, while the profes
sion-oriented think that "feeling protected" is a more likely
outcome.
Sex and ethnic background are generally unrewarding
variables in this study. Two self-reported cheating items, both
referring to copying from another's paper during an exam,
show women less likely—by 10% or more—to cheat in this
fashion.
Women are more likely to consider themselves "not well
informed" about the Honor Code, though their quiz scores
are no worse than the men's. Mandatory proctoring receives
more support from women; other proctoring options, how
ever, are not conspicuously supported by one sex or the
other. Favorable effects of proctoring—e.g., that students
would feel protected—are cited more frequently by women;
men are more likely to respond that an Honor Code would
lose meaning and/or that a meaningful Honor Code would
cease to exist.
The ethnic background tables include both graduates and
undergraduates in order to obtain a statistically comfortable
number of "non-Caucasian" respondents (black, chicano,
Spanish surname, native American, Asian American, or

"other"). The ethnic conglomerate may be meaningless; but,
in any case, being "non-Caucasian" does not relate consis
tently or significantly to any of the behavioral or attitudinal
variables in our study.
Background Variables and the Graduate Sample
The obvious and occasionally interesting differences dis
cussed with respect to our undergraduate respondents are
not, in general, evident among the graduate respondents in
our sample. There are not as many cases, and two areas
(Earth Sciences and H & S Humanities) include too few cases
to allow attention to comparative percentages.
The reader may remember from Section 1 that experience
with and awareness of academic dishonesty is signfficantly
lower among Stanford's graduate student population. One
result of this difference is that is is less rewarding—indeed
discouragint—to examine departmental or other background
variables with respect to the respondent's own cheating or
awareness of it: there are simply too few cases to yield
dependable percentages. Thus we have a reduced set of
variables to examine; however—to the extent that any disci
plinary area stands out as consistently different from the
other two—it is, at the graduate level, that of H & S science
and math students.
Not many variables, even with the reduced set, show
disciplinary differences. Those that do tend to be those
discussed both earlier and later in this report—those items
with respect to which, for a variety of reasons, our sample
respondents seem to differ. On these variables, shown in
tabular form in the appendices, graduate students in H & S
science and math departments come through as personally
moral pessimists.
The differences are neither wholly consistent nor statis
tically awesome, but it appears that the science/math sub
group is more likely to endorse the broadly-stated values of
honesty, to not worry much personally about cheating, and
to cheat less; to perceive less Honor Code support and
knowledge among fellow-students and faculty; and to not
favor the proctoring remedy, anticipating several ill effects.
With flags of caution waving wildly, we close this section
with a few comments about the graduate student population
who are not U.S. citizens. It is a small group (only 18
respondents), and hence the need for caution. The differ
ences in responses between citizens and noncitizens, however,
are surprisingly consistent over a range of variables—unlike
our results with the "non-Caucasian" background variable.
To summarize the tables which appear in the appendices,
value statements which citizens tend to endorse (e.g. "Most
students want to be honest."), noncitizens indicate "Not
Sure"; others which citizens tend to disagree with (e.g.,
"Reporting someone for cheating is worse than cheating"),
noncitizens tend to endorse. They express less commitment
to the Honor Code and perceive less support among other
students. They are less supportive of (or less opinionated
about) various proctoring options, less willing to serve as
proctors, and likely to expect more negative results to follow
the introduction of proctoring. These several areas of differ
ence are not always statistically large, but the fact that
differences consistently appear is deserving of some atten
tion.
Section 3: Some Comparisons Between 1961 and 1976
Before discussing the results of our comparisons over
time, it is appropriate to restate some of the differences
between the studies which restrict the ease with which our
comparisons may safely lead to firm conclusions:
1) The 1961 results are based on only 75 undergraduates,
a 75% response rate from the sample;
2) The 1961 study was nationwide, sponsored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and covered many topics related to
social control processes, whereas our study is internally
sponsored and relatively narrow in scope; and
3) The representation of freshmen in the 1961 survey
was proportional to their population size, which is not true
of 1976 freshmen.
On the positive side, the questions we chose to repeat are
identical in wording and response categories to the 1961
versions; also, background items for which we have other
sources of trend data—e.g., sex, age, grade average, ethnic
background, and type of campus housing—show changes very
similar to those in the questionnaire responses.
We will discuss several interesting comparisons in this
section; attention will focus first, however, on four findings
of special interest to the SCLC.
First, contrary to prevailing opinion, our data show no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976.
Second, current students are more likely to have actually
seen instances of cheating, and to perceive-in a general
way—that more cheating exists, than was true of their
predecessors.
Third, there is a notable drop in expressed support for
value statements concerning honesty, especially those with a
universal tone—e.g., "Under no circumstances is cheating ever
justified."
Fourth, support for the reporting aspect of the Honor
Code has indeed declined; in 1961, about one-quarter of the
sample would, m a hypothetical cheating situation, report the

offender or ask that he report himself—compared to less than
10% who say they would do so in 1976.
Self-Reports of Academic Dishonesty
The fo;lowing self-reports were solicited in 1961 and
1976 with the results shown in the two columns to the right:
Check all the following which you have done at Stanford.
% responding "Yes"
1961 1976
"Padding" a few items on a bibliography 20% 23%

footnoting in a paper 35 35

of doing the work independently 32 28

already taken the same exam 8 13

his knowing about it 16 10

Another set of questions allowed five responses ranging
from "Never" to "Many times"; so few persons, in either
year, selected the fourth or fifth categories, that we show
below only the predominent response categories.

The lack of change shown above is worth notice; where
there are changes—in either direction—they are too small to
warrant serious attention. It is, we believe, a safe conclusion
that self-reported acts of cheating are unchanged between
1961 and 1976. (We should point out that in Bowers' 1961
data, the Stanford level of cheating was found to be very low
in a nation-wide context. Even on those questions which
show an increase between 1961 and 1976, the current
Stanford percent is below the nationwide 1961 sample
percent.)
PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIC
DISHONESTY
Here we see some substantial differences. In both years,
students were asked, "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], have you seen another student cheating during a
test or exam?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 76% 49% Once 12% 9% A few 7% 29%
times
'61 '76 '61 *76

A similar question: "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], has another student indicated to you during a
test or exam that he wanted help?"

Never 88% 78% Once 8% 8% A few
times 3% 11%
Several Many
times 1% 2% times 0% 1%
It seems indisputable that current students are more likely
to have personally witnessed cheating activity. Regardless of
their own experience, they also hold different perceptions of
the extent of academic dishonesty and the functioning of
disciplinary processes. Students in both years were asked to
estimate, in percentage terms, the frequency of the following
events:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage has cheated since coming to Stanford."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-15%) 42% 35%
Medium estimate (16-60%) 37 51
High estimate (above 60%) 21 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheats frequently."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 43% 44%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 45 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 12
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage is discovered."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-4%) 27% 43%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 50 43
High estimate (above 15%) 23 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage is discovered
by the course instructor."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-70%) 32% 47%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 68 34
High estimate (above 97%) 0 19
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarized and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage are reported by
other students."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-10%) 66% 44%
Medium estimate (11-65%) 23 42
High estimate (above 65%) 11 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage report them
selves. "
1961 1976
Low estimate (0%) 59% 69%
Medium estimate (1-10%) 28 26
High estimate (above 10%) 13 6
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 90% 49%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 9 47
High estimate (above 85%) 1 4
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases disciplinary action is taken by the course
instructor.
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-35%) 48% 39%
Medium estimate (36-90%) 40 52
High estimate (above 90%) 12 9
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases the case is passed on to some other authority
for disciplinary action."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-5%) 19% 32%
Medium estimate (6-50%) 39 56
High estimate (above 50%) 42 11
Comparing percentage distributions of percentage esti
mates can be quite confusing. Some differences, however,
come through quite clearly: 1961 respondents estimated a
higher "discovery rate" for cheaters, expected more disco
veries to be made by faculty, and substantially more cheating
cases being passed to authorities beyond the classroom. In
neither year did many students perceive a high level of
self-reporting ("0%" the majority estimate—chosen by 59% in
1961 and 69% currently).
These indicated trends in the percentage estimates are
confirmed by another set of responses elsewhere in the
questionnaire:

Unfortunately, our 1961 data are in the form of com
puter print-out rather than IBM cards, so we are unable to
examine the relationships between these value endorsements
and other variables of obvious interest—like self-reports of
cheating. As we will discuss later in Section 4, 1976 respon
dents who agree strongly with some of these statements are
conspicuously different from their fellow-students in several
other ways as well.
RESPONSES TO HYPOTHETICAL CHEATING SITUA
TIONS
Earlier we examined responses about cheating actually
observed; here we inquire what our responses would do if
they observed cheating.
"Suppose you saw a student cheating on a test or exam.
What would you do?"
1961 1976
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 4% 5%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 22 3
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 36 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 14 33
Ignore the incident 2525
In both years, one-quarter of the students in this hypothe
tical situation would ignore the incident. Also in both years,
the modal choice is to express disapproval but not to report
the offender.
The big change is in the second most popular form of
social control-in 1961, it is to ask the person to report
himself and report him if he doesn't do so, and in 1976 it is
to mention the incident to others but not report it.

"How often have the following things happened that you
knowabout?"

As before, the areas of large change are in perceived
self-reporting and faculty alertness and activity, student
reporting of others is seen to be only slightly less frequent
now.
Student views of faculty are tapped in yet another way,
with consistent differences over time again evident.

Before considering behaviors and perceptions more di
rectly related to the Honor Code, we'll look briefly at some
value statements put to both undergraduate samples.
VALUES ABOUT HONESTY
Here we see some of the largest differences of any found
so far in our several analyses. There can be little doubt that
the changes in the "Agree Strongly" column below, especial
ly for the first two statements, constitute real differences
between our two samples.
Agree Agree Not Disagree Disagree

Reporting someone for cheating
is worse than cheating 3 4 10 7 12 19 38 31 38 38

It may seem surprising that only 26% of the 1961 sample
supported the reporting obligation of the Honor Code; but
other responses show that students also perceived some
student support for reporting in 1961—the combination of
general perception plus 26% commitment may well have
resulted in a social control system that effectively reduced
academic dishonesty.
Another hypothetical situation was posed:
1961 1976
Give him the answer 0% 2%
Say nothing but expose your paper
so he can copy the answer 4 2
Ignore or turn down his request 59 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 32 21
Report him to the appropriate
authorities 5 2
Two categories show 10-15% differences; ignoring or
rejecting such a request is a more popular option now, and
expressing disapproval informally is less popular. Neither
sample views reporting the request with much favor.
Both hypothetical situations were elaborated by changing
the identity of the cheater from an unspecified individual to
"a campus leader" and "a close friend"; the second situation
added a third, "some you disliked personally." In both years,
a friend observed cheating is less likely to be reported and
more likely to be informally disapproved of; campus leaders
>n both years are more severely treated than others—27% of
the 1961 sample, and 17% in 1976, would report him, and
only about 20% would ignore the incident.
For the solicited exam aid situation, our two samples are
similar with the following exceptions; whereas currently 21%
would cooperate with a friend's request, only 7% thought
they would do so in 1961; both samples are more likely to
express disapproval to a friend than to the other specified
offenders, 42% selecting this treatment of a friend in 1961,
and 30% in 1976. For neither sample is reporting a likely
option—even for campus leaders in 1961, the figure is only
7%.
This concludes our review of trend findings of key
interest to the SCLC. We have restricted our interpretive
comments to the analytic variety, indicating which differ
ences seemed, to us, worth serious attention.
Another level of interpretation, however, is needed with
respect to one blatant anomaly: How is it that individual
self-reported cheating is unchanged, but current students
report seeing more cheating than their predecessors? One
possible interpretation is simply that cheating is more conspi
cuous when it does occur; that the change in moral climate,
suggested by the value endorsement data, has both allowed
current cheaters to be more open in their activities and
opened more widely the eyes and ears of noncheaters. To the
extent that our 1976 data permit, we will examine these
possibilities in Section 4. Our aim here is to draw attention to
the phenomenon and encourage speculation.
1961 AND 1976 VIEWS ON THE PURPOSES OF A COL
LEGE EDUCATION
Several questions on the Bowers questionnaire, while not
related to the SCLC task, were so potentially interesting to
repeat 15 years later that we easily yielded to the temptation.
Students were asked to consider a list of purposes of a college
education, to indicate the importance of each purpose to the
respondent, and then to select that purpose considered most
important to the respondent.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Most
Important Purpose
1961 1976
gg Provide a basic general education and
appreciation of ideas
Provide vocational training; develop
skills and techniques directly
applicable to my career
Develop my ability to get along with
different kinds of people
Develop my knowledge and interest in the
® ® community and world problems
Help develop my moral capacities, ethical
® standards and values
Prepare me for a happy marriage
® and family life
Looking at these comparisons, it is hard to believe that 15
turbulent years have passed since the first survey. With two
exceptions, the differences are smaller than pollsters ex
pected to find over a one-week time span! Amidst such
constancy, the two shifts stand out sharply: Current students
attribute somewhat less importance to acquiring knowledge
about world problems (though the change is not large); and
our sample virtually rejects preparation for marriage as an
important purpose of college—in 1961, 53% assigned some
importance to this purpose, compared with 28% today.
With some trepidation, we also repeated the question,
"How well satisfied are you with your educational experience
at Stanford [at this school] ?"
1961 1976
Very well satisfied 38% 24%
Fairly well satisfied 55 63
Not very well satisfied 7 13
Not at all satisfied 0 0
The drop in the top category, while not huge, is big
enough to qualify as real. We did not inquire into reasons for
the respondents' level of satisfaction (nor did Bowers), and
thus cannot help those wishing to interpret or evaluate the
significance of this change.
Section 4: A Closer Look at Self-Reported Cheating
While we know more now about the state of academic
honesty at Stanford than we did prior to the survey, we still
should look closer at the correlates of self-reported cheating
activity.
Our data do not allow us to assign causality and statis
tically test alternative explanations of cheating behavior; we
can, however, change tactics from preceding sections and
focus on different levels of cheating—seeking related variables
that are potentially manipulable, be it by policy or informal
effort.
We make frequent use in this section of the three
"cheating indices" introd - "~ed in Section 1: Cheating Index,
"Serious" Cheating, and Exam Cheating. By cross-tabulating
each index with a wide range of variables, we looked for
differences between the three indices (e.g.. Are those who
admit to serious cheating different from those who admit to

what one SCLC member labeled "dilettante cheating"?), as
well as for differences between self-confessed cheaters of
whatever stripe and noncheaters.
First, we examine the hypothesis that noncheaters are
better informed about the contents of the Honor Code than
are those who cheat. We created a Knowledge Index based on
the quiz-type questions, high scores going to those with a
higher proportion of right answers. Cross-tabulating the
Knowledge Index with each cheating index produced no
difference worth reporting. It appears that our respondents
who cheat know neither more nor less about the Honor Code
than their contemporaries who don't cheat.
Perceived cheating is, not surprisingly, positively related
to self-reported cheating; the indices work similarly, but the
relationship shows most clearly in the example below:
"Since you have been at Stanford, have you seen another
student cheating during a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Never 61% 54% 29%
Once 9 8 9
A few times 23 27 39
Several times 5 7 11
Many times 2 3 12

26 29 47 45 27 26
10 4 43 24 47 72
The biggest difference is between those who are high on
our index (N=s6), versus those who are medium or low. This
pattern reappears in response to the question, "What would
you do if you saw someone cheating on a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score

Ignore the incident 16 25 34
Similarly, those who admit to having cheated are more
likely to have been asked for help during a test or exam; in
response to such a request, they are more likely to aid the
person or ignore the incident (versus reporting or expressing
disapproval).
Strong differences appear when the cheating index is
cross-tabulated with the three universalistic value statements
(again, all three cheating indices work similarly). The follow
ing table examplifies the differences found with respect to
the other value statements as well.
"Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified."

The differences seen above are substantially reduced when
respondents are asked to indicate their agreement with the
statement: "Honesty is desirable, but currently impossible at
Stanford."

We also find no large differences with respect to level of
commitment to the current Honor Code, or to the serious
ness of the current level of academic dishonesty at Stanford.
There is a modest tendency for noncheaters to prefer proc
toring, but the differences are neither consistently related to
level of self-reported cheating nor larger than about 10%.
With respect to background variables, seniors tend to
appear in the medium and high categories on our scales (52%
of the "highs" are seniors). There is a discernable but
undramatic tendency for social science majors to be high,
engineering and science majors medium, and humanities low.
There is a similar consistent, modest tendency for students
with professional school plans to score higher on our indices
than those planning to attend graduate school.
A final small correlation that is packed with interpretative
potential: Noncheaters are more likely to be "very satisfied"
with their educational experiences at Stanford than respon
dents scoring medium or high (% "very satisfied," 33%, 24%,
and 18% respectively).
Since our largest unexpected differences, both here and in
the 1961 comparisons, have involved three value statements,
we decided to look more closely at our respondents' value
endorsements. We created an index called Strong Values, ana
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each respondent according
to how many times he indicated strong agreement with these
statements:
1) Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified.
2) Students are morally obligated not to cheat.
3) Cheating directly contradicts the goals of education.
Our population split very neatly into the four categories,
about 25% in each.
Our subsequent cross-tabulations yielded interesting re
sults, which we will first summarize, and then examine some
details. Respondents with high scores on our Strong Values
index are much less aware of, involved in, and opinionated
about all matters related to cheating at Stanford. Their
responses to hypothetical cheating situations are very likely
to include expressing disapproval, even to friends (similar to
the 1961 response for the whole sample).
They learn about cheating primarily from official
channels, and about the Honor Code from signing blue
books. They are more likely to indicate strong belief in the
Honor Code, and to believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty constitutes a moderate or serious problem They
do not, however, hold consistently different perceptions of
fellow students or faculty with respect to Honor Code
support, nor are their opinions about specific aspects of the
Honor Code different from their fellow respondents. They
are not conspicuously either for or against proctoring; on
these and other questions soliciting opinions about hypothe
tical effects or the attitudes of others, they are more likely to
check "not sure."
They are, in sum, an interesting, not easily comprehen
sible, group of people—slightly more likely to be female and
majoring in the humanities, unlikely to be seniors, and more
likely to be very satisfied with their educational experience at
Stanford.
The tables that follow show the most impressive of the
differences discussed above. Other tables referred to but not
presented below are in the appendices.

Another section of the questionnaire elicited many speci
fic course characteristics of courses taken winter quarter by
our respondents. Among other things, they were asked about
the extent and types of cheating that occurred in the two
winter courses they liked best, and the one liked least.
Each single cheating item received too few mentions to be
useful to us, so we grouped together all mentions of any type
or level of cheating for the course liked best and created an
index, and similarly for the course liked least. Only 17
nonzero scores are on the first index (mentions of cheating
instances), and 36 on the course-liked-least index. The index
items are:
Respondent personally knew about or learned about. . . .
* Any other students cheating on the final exam, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on tests other than the
final, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on homework or lab
assignments, and/or;
* At least half the other students cheating at one or
another time during the course.
We were interested in learning what types of courses were
likely settings for cheating; by cross-tabulating the other
course characteristics against the index scores, we identified
several characteristics differentiating courses with observed
cheating from other courses.
Those courses liked best in which cheating occurred were
likely to be introductory, have more than 30 students
enrolled, and have short-answer exams (versus open-book,
essay, or take-homes). Past tests were likely to be available
for study purposes, seating was staggered during exams, and
either a TA or the instructor was likely to remain in the room
during exams.
Those observing cheating are likely to be high on our
cheating indices, which supports our earlier conclusion that
those who observe cheating are themselves more likely to
cheat. The course-least-liked index tables show similar results.
On the whole, we suspect that the attempt in this section
to understand better students who cheat and settings con
ducive to cheating events has produced results more useful to
the student of social deviance than to the concerned policy
evaluator.
The characteristics most obviously related to self-reported
cheating are value stances of a special, universalistic sort—a

trait probably not nurtured during the undergraduate years,
or seniors would not be conspicuously absent from the group
of high scorers on our values index.
With respect to the finding that those who cheat are much
more likely to observe other cheating, our data don't allow us
to establish the order of the relationship—i.e., does own
cheating heighten awareness and thus perceptions of others'
cheating, or does one begin cheating in response to observing
it? Probably both processes occur, but we cannot disentangle
them.
One main policy modification, the introduction of op
tional or mandatory proctoring of exams, is not strongly or
consistently favored by our population of noncheaters, nor
by the overlapping subgroup of those high on our values
index. Proctoring already exists in some classes, and our
respondents are more likely to report instances of cheating in
courses with proctored exams.
That does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that
proctoring is ineffective; that students do see cheating in
proctored exam courses may, however, help to explain the
lack of widespread support for proctoring as a solution to the
ills of academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
We have examined, described, and assessed a large amount
of data on Stanford students—their personal honesty, their
valuation of honesty, their experiences with and perceptions
of academic dishonesty among their fellow students, their
concern about cheating, their attitudes toward and know
ledge of the Honor Code, and their opinions about possible
modifications of the current system. What, after all this, can
we safely assert that we know?
First, and perhaps most important, is the conclusion that
Stanford does not currently have a "cheating problem";
those who have worried about a West Point level scandal may
sleep soundly, at least for a while. While cheating continues
to exist in academic endeavors, our data show that the
incidence of self-reported cheating among undergraduates is
approximately the same now as it was in 1961.
The increased selectivity exercised in undergraduate ad
missions may account in part for this lack of change;
although the pressures on students have certainly increased,
the student body includes fewer undergraduates who cannot
cope with the academic demands made of them
The picture is not entirely rosy, however. Indeed, it is
only a slight exaggeration to state that the low incidence of
cheating is independent of the current control system rather
than a result of it. Students are not knowledgeable about the
contents of the Honor Code, nor is the majority highly
committed to it. They similarly perceive their fellow students
and faculty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not
actually indifferent or opposed to it. The crux of the matter
is that the system is not seen to be working.
Students are both more aware of the cheating that does
exist, and less willing to report offenders (or ask them to
report themselves). Nor do they see faculty members filling
the activity gap as either police or advocates. (As our report
on the faculty surveys will state, this perception of the
faculty is essentially correct.)
There is no evidence that personal moral standards have
declined at Stanford, though the willingness to hold others to
universalistic standards seems to have declined substantially.
The 25% of our sample who do endorse the several
universalistic value statements in the questionnaire, and who
are substantially more willing to observe the reporting obliga
tion—these students are not, apparently, very visible or very
vocal among their fellow students. They do not have as much
experience with instances of cheating as the rest of the
sample; and, or course, it may be lack of experience which
permits them to predict that their hypothetical behavior
would differ from that of the majority.
We find no strong support for exam proctoring, even
among those subgroups most aware of and concerned about
levels of cheating.
The minority most exposed to cheating seem to favor
unilateral solutions, while the rest are more likely to reject
proctoring or prefer it as a faculty and/or student option. In
short, both the need to modify the current Honor Code, and
the appropriateness of alternative modifications continue to
be judgmental matters: our data provide no clear answers.
Our own interpretation—and it is merely that—is that
Stanford's Honor Code suffers primarily from invisibility
ignorance and apathy better describe our sample than dis
honesty and anxiety. While some modifications may be in
order (e.g., eliminating the reporting obligation, and per
mitting proctoring at studen' and/or instructor preference), it
is premature to consider abandoning the current system.
An educational program is needed, not simply on the
contents of the Code but also on topics like "What plagiarism
is and how to avoid it." (English and communication have
such a statement and some faculty members, at least, distri
bute copies to their students.)
People who throw out the baby with the bath water are
usually unaware that the baby is there; and until the
presence, characteristics, and value of the Honor Code are
widely known on campus, hasty action—like pulling the
plug—would be both unnecessary and undesirable.
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %
Do you consider yourself to be:
Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 52 46
Not well informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 35 44
The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66
Support it by their behavior? 75 68
Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:
% replying "Yes" to Undergrad Grad
1. "Padding" a few items on a biblio- 23 8
graphy
2. Copying a few sentences of material 35 13
without footnoting in a paper
3. Copying answers from a text or other 28 13

dently
4. Writing a paper for another student 3 3
5. Getting questions or answers from
someone who has already taken the same
exam 13 8
6. Giving answers to other students
during an exam 8 5
7. Arranging with other students to give
or receive answers by use of signals 1 0
8. Arranging to sit next to someone who
will let you copy from him during a test or
exam 4 0
9. Copying from someone's test or exam
paper without his knowing it 10 3
10. Taking an exam for another student 1 0

Because the actions range from trivial to serious, and
these distributions count acts, not individuals, we construc
ted three indices of so-called cheating behavior. The first
index counts the number of respondents who checked at
least one item of the 1 7-item set shown above. The second
index is also a count, but excludes items 1-3 above. The third
index counts examination cheating only (items 5-10, 14-15).

Our respondent's perceptions of the amount of cheatiny
among their fellow students are most usefully viewed in the
context of their self-reports of cheating, a topic addressed in
Section 4, and in comparison with the 1961 data, discussed
in Section 3. Suffice it to say here that undergraduates
perceive substantially more cheating than do graduate stu
dents:

Respondents were asked to estimate, in percentage terms,
levels and types of cheating, levels of discovered cheating,
types of discipline imposed, etc. It is surprising, given their
differences in personal observation of cheating, that the
percentage estimates provided by graduates and undergradu
ates are quite similar. Some examples follow:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage have cheated since coming to Stanford."
Undergrad Grad

on the grapevine 55 33
Hearing about them through official channels
(e.g.. The Daily, Dean's Office,
a faculty member, etc.) 18 40
We turn now to two questions which will be reexamined
from other angles in subsequent sections of this report.
Though not directly addressing Honor Code issues, they
indicate the amount of support for the "reporting obliga
tion"—that observers of cheating report the offenders. The
low support expressed is all the more striking because the
questions pose hypothetical situations:
Suppose you saw a student cheating. What would you do?
Undergrads Grads
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 5% (1) 10%
Ask him to report himself and report him
if he fails to do so 3 ( (3) 10
Express disapproval informally but not
report him 34 (68) 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 33 (5) 17
Ignore the incident 25 (23) 29
Graduates and undergraduates agree about how their
behavior would change were the offender "a close friend":
the undergraduate percentages are shown in parentheses
above. If the offender were "a campus leader," however,
reporting becomes somewhat more likely, increasing to 17%
for undergraduates and 28% for graduates.
The second hypothetical question shows only small differ
ences between graduates and undergraduates; the percentages
below are for the undergraduate respondents.
If someone asked you for help during a test or exam,
what would you do?
Undergrad %
Give him the answer 2
Say nothing but expose your paper so
he can copy the answer 2
Ignore or turn down his request 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 21
Report him to the appropriate authorities 2
If the person seeking help were a friend, the percentage
selecting the first or second option increases to 21%; re
actions to "a campus leader" or "someone you disliked
personally" are not substantially different from those shown
above for an unspecified person.
One question attempts to assess in a global sort of way
"the cheating problem":
"Do you believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty at Stanford poses a serious threat to the academic
process?"
Undergrad %
Yes, very serious 11
Moderately serious 32
Not very serious 55

Between one-fifth ana about half of the undergraduate
population support the introduction of examination proctor
ing, or allowing for proctoring as an option:

Graduate student responses differ in that many more
appear in the No Opinion column; when preferences are
expressed, they are in the same direction as those shown
above for undergraduates.
Asked who should serve as exam proctors, class instruc
tors and graduate TAs—in that order—are overwhelmingly
preferred over students from outside the class. Similarly, the
majority of respondents think that students should not
participate in "identifying and selecting from a pool of
potential proctors":

would you do it?"

obligation Undergrad 28% 31% 41%

Finally, students were asked what probable effects would
result from instituting exam proctoring. Below we show the
undergraduate responses; where graduate responses are sub
stantially different, they appear in parentheses.
The incidence of cheating on examinations
would be reduced. 71%
Students would no longer feel obliged to report
the dishonesty of others on examinations 67 (50)
An Honor Code would lose meaning 58 (43)
A meaningful Honor Code would cease to exist 47 (26)
Students would feel threatened by the lack
of trust 44 ( 32)
Students would feel protected from a
minority of dishonest students 43
The incident of cheating in other areas would
increase (e.g., take-home exams, lab reports). 16
Students would no longer feel obliged to behave
honestly on examinations 12
We now turn, in the following sections, to more detailed
considerations of the results of our study, broadly and
briskly described above.
Section 2: The Role of Background Characteristics
It is a truism of social research that one can always find
background characteristics of respondents which correlate—at
impressive statistical levels—with the dependent variables
under scrutiny. This study is no exception.
Separately for graduates and undergraduates, we cross
tabulated a range of background characteristics with a long
but selective list of variables concerning values, perceptions,
and behaviors. We found many, many differences; undergrad
uate class, academic department, and—to a lesser extent
graduate school intentions, sex, and citizenship, all show
correlations with many of our value and behavior indicators.
In the interests of brevity, clarity, and progress, we have
selected from this mass of data in two ways: first, only those
findings of central policy interest to the SCLC are being
reported here; and second, only those patterns of relation
ships which are internally consistent will receive attention.
An example which meets the first criterion but fails the
second: Freshmen and sophomores are more likely to know
that the Honor Code prohibits proctoring, but less likely to
agree that the Honor Code "regulates faculty behavior." Both
relationships are statistically significant; viewed together,
however, they don't make sense and are better politely
dismissed than puzzled over (e.g., "It appears that undergrad
uate class is not systematically related to knowledge of
Honor Code contents.")
Tables showing the relationships described in this section
r,ro available in the appendices. Throughout what follows,
"sophomores" should be understood to include our four
token freshmen.
Undergraduate class relates in a variety of ways to several
key variables, especially perceptions of cheating. Honor Code
commitment, and attitudes toward proctoring. Sophomores
have seen less cheating and fewer instances of students
reporting others for cheating; they are, however, slightly
more likely to have seen instructors ignoring cheating behav
ior. Although their self-reported cheating varies only slightly
from that of upperclassmen, sophomores are more likely to
worry about false accusations of cheating.
Sophomores are especially likely to state that the Honor
Code system should be altered, and least likely to describe
themselves as believing strongly in the current system. They
favor the introduction of exam proctoring more than upper
classmen do, especially in classes with enrollments over 30,
and/or in required preprofessional classes.
Sophomores' attitudes and experiences extend to their
perceptions of other students and faculty: they are least
likely to think other students favor continuation of the
current Honor Code; while more likely to believe that faculty
know about the Honor Code and its requirements, they are
least likely to think faculty favor its continuation or support
it by their behavior.
Differences by undergraduate major are, by and large,
inconsistent and statistically small—few exceed 10%. There is
some tendency for respondents in social science departments
to see a world that is consistently slightly different from that
seen by others; the humanities, science, and engineering
students do not generally differ greatly from each other in
patterned or consistent ways.
Social science majors are distinctive in the following
respects: they report having seen more cheating, more often
been asked for help on exams, more often observed an
instructor ignoring cheating, knowing of more instances of
students reporting offenders, and more likely to think that
the current level of academic dishonesty poses a serious
threat to the educational process.
Their self-reports of cheating are high on three of the six
items where area of major shows a difference; unlike the
other disciplinary areas, they are low on no item. They do
not, however, conspicuously favor exam proctoring; indeed,
they are least willing to proctor "as a University obligation,"
though the percent willing doubles "if paid" (the other
disciplinary areas show a decrease in willingness if proctoring
were a paid job). While not especially in favor of any of the
proctoring options, social science majors are least likely to
believe that an effect of proctoring would be that "the Honor
Code would lose meaning."
Many of the areas in which social science majors differ
from our other undergraduate respondents also differentiate
between undergraduates with professional school versus grad
uate school intentions.
On all variables relating to knowledge of cheating, general
perceptions of the extent of cheating, and self-reported
cheating, either no differences appear or the profession
oriented students are higher—i.e., more aware of cheating and
higher rates of self-reported cheating.
On the Honor Code quiz, profession-oriented students are
less likely to know that exam proctoring is prohibited; later
questions show them to be more in favor of mandatory
proctoring, slightly more willing to proctor as an obligation,
and much more willing to proctor if paid to do so.
The two groups also differ in the results they would
expect from proctoring: graduate school-oriented students
believe that students would feel threatened, while the profes
sion-oriented think that "feeling protected" is a more likely
outcome.
Sex and ethnic background are generally unrewarding
variables in this study. Two self-reported cheating items, both
referring to copying from another's paper during an exam,
show women less likely—by 10% or more—to cheat in this
fashion.
Women are more likely to consider themselves "not well
informed" about the Honor Code, though their quiz scores
are no worse than the men's. Mandatory proctoring receives
more support from women; other proctoring options, how
ever, are not conspicuously supported by one sex or the
other. Favorable effects of proctoring—e.g., that students
would feel protected—are cited more frequently by women;
men are more likely to respond that an Honor Code would
lose meaning and/or that a meaningful Honor Code would
cease to exist.
The ethnic background tables include both graduates and
undergraduates in order to obtain a statistically comfortable
number of "non-Caucasian" respondents (black, chicano,
Spanish surname, native American, Asian American, or

"other"). The ethnic conglomerate may be meaningless; but,
in any case, being "non-Caucasian" does not relate consis
tently or significantly to any of the behavioral or attitudinal
variables in our study.
Background Variables and the Graduate Sample
The obvious and occasionally interesting differences dis
cussed with respect to our undergraduate respondents are
not, in general, evident among the graduate respondents in
our sample. There are not as many cases, and two areas
(Earth Sciences and H & S Humanities) include too few cases
to allow attention to comparative percentages.
The reader may remember from Section 1 that experience
with and awareness of academic dishonesty is signfficantly
lower among Stanford's graduate student population. One
result of this difference is that is is less rewarding—indeed
discouragint—to examine departmental or other background
variables with respect to the respondent's own cheating or
awareness of it: there are simply too few cases to yield
dependable percentages. Thus we have a reduced set of
variables to examine; however—to the extent that any disci
plinary area stands out as consistently different from the
other two—it is, at the graduate level, that of H & S science
and math students.
Not many variables, even with the reduced set, show
disciplinary differences. Those that do tend to be those
discussed both earlier and later in this report—those items
with respect to which, for a variety of reasons, our sample
respondents seem to differ. On these variables, shown in
tabular form in the appendices, graduate students in H & S
science and math departments come through as personally
moral pessimists.
The differences are neither wholly consistent nor statis
tically awesome, but it appears that the science/math sub
group is more likely to endorse the broadly-stated values of
honesty, to not worry much personally about cheating, and
to cheat less; to perceive less Honor Code support and
knowledge among fellow-students and faculty; and to not
favor the proctoring remedy, anticipating several ill effects.
With flags of caution waving wildly, we close this section
with a few comments about the graduate student population
who are not U.S. citizens. It is a small group (only 18
respondents), and hence the need for caution. The differ
ences in responses between citizens and noncitizens, however,
are surprisingly consistent over a range of variables—unlike
our results with the "non-Caucasian" background variable.
To summarize the tables which appear in the appendices,
value statements which citizens tend to endorse (e.g. "Most
students want to be honest."), noncitizens indicate "Not
Sure"; others which citizens tend to disagree with (e.g.,
"Reporting someone for cheating is worse than cheating"),
noncitizens tend to endorse. They express less commitment
to the Honor Code and perceive less support among other
students. They are less supportive of (or less opinionated
about) various proctoring options, less willing to serve as
proctors, and likely to expect more negative results to follow
the introduction of proctoring. These several areas of differ
ence are not always statistically large, but the fact that
differences consistently appear is deserving of some atten
tion.
Section 3: Some Comparisons Between 1961 and 1976
Before discussing the results of our comparisons over
time, it is appropriate to restate some of the differences
between the studies which restrict the ease with which our
comparisons may safely lead to firm conclusions:
1) The 1961 results are based on only 75 undergraduates,
a 75% response rate from the sample;
2) The 1961 study was nationwide, sponsored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and covered many topics related to
social control processes, whereas our study is internally
sponsored and relatively narrow in scope; and
3) The representation of freshmen in the 1961 survey
was proportional to their population size, which is not true
of 1976 freshmen.
On the positive side, the questions we chose to repeat are
identical in wording and response categories to the 1961
versions; also, background items for which we have other
sources of trend data—e.g., sex, age, grade average, ethnic
background, and type of campus housing—show changes very
similar to those in the questionnaire responses.
We will discuss several interesting comparisons in this
section; attention will focus first, however, on four findings
of special interest to the SCLC.
First, contrary to prevailing opinion, our data show no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976.
Second, current students are more likely to have actually
seen instances of cheating, and to perceive-in a general
way—that more cheating exists, than was true of their
predecessors.
Third, there is a notable drop in expressed support for
value statements concerning honesty, especially those with a
universal tone—e.g., "Under no circumstances is cheating ever
justified."
Fourth, support for the reporting aspect of the Honor
Code has indeed declined; in 1961, about one-quarter of the
sample would, m a hypothetical cheating situation, report the

offender or ask that he report himself—compared to less than
10% who say they would do so in 1976.
Self-Reports of Academic Dishonesty
The fo;lowing self-reports were solicited in 1961 and
1976 with the results shown in the two columns to the right:
Check all the following which you have done at Stanford.
% responding "Yes"
1961 1976
"Padding" a few items on a bibliography 20% 23%

footnoting in a paper 35 35

his knowing about it 16 10

Having another student take an exam for you 0 0

Another set of questions allowed five responses ranging
from "Never" to "Many times"; so few persons, in either
year, selected the fourth or fifth categories, that we show
below only the predominent response categories.

The lack of change shown above is worth notice; where
there are changes—in either direction—they are too small to
warrant serious attention. It is, we believe, a safe conclusion
that self-reported acts of cheating are unchanged between
1961 and 1976. (We should point out that in Bowers' 1961
data, the Stanford level of cheating was found to be very low
in a nation-wide context. Even on those questions which
show an increase between 1961 and 1976, the current
Stanford percent is below the nationwide 1961 sample
percent.)
PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIC
DISHONESTY
Here we see some substantial differences. In both years,
students were asked, "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], have you seen another student cheating during a
test or exam?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 76% 49% Once 12% 9% A few 7% 29%
times
'61 '76 '61 *76

A similar question: "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], has another student indicated to you during a
test or exam that he wanted help?"

Never 88% 78% Once 8% 8% A few
times 3% 11%
Several Many
times 1% 2% times 0% 1%
It seems indisputable that current students are more likely
to have personally witnessed cheating activity. Regardless of
their own experience, they also hold different perceptions of
the extent of academic dishonesty and the functioning of
disciplinary processes. Students in both years were asked to
estimate, in percentage terms, the frequency of the following
events:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage has cheated since coming to Stanford."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-15%) 42% 35%
Medium estimate (16-60%) 37 51
High estimate (above 60%) 21 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheats frequently."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 43% 44%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 45 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 12
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage is discovered."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-4%) 27% 43%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 50 43
High estimate (above 15%) 23 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage is discovered
by the course instructor."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-70%) 32% 47%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 68 34
High estimate (above 97%) 0 19
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarized and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage are reported by
other students."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-10%) 66% 44%
Medium estimate (11-65%) 23 42
High estimate (above 65%) 11 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage report them
selves. "
1961 1976
Low estimate (0%) 59% 69%
Medium estimate (1-10%) 28 26
High estimate (above 10%) 13 6
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 90% 49%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 9 47
High estimate (above 85%) 1 4
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases disciplinary action is taken by the course
instructor.
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-35%) 48% 39%
Medium estimate (36-90%) 40 52
High estimate (above 90%) 12 9
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases the case is passed on to some other authority
for disciplinary action."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-5%) 19% 32%
Medium estimate (6-50%) 39 56
High estimate (above 50%) 42 11
Comparing percentage distributions of percentage esti
mates can be quite confusing. Some differences, however,
come through quite clearly: 1961 respondents estimated a
higher "discovery rate" for cheaters, expected more disco
veries to be made by faculty, and substantially more cheating
cases being passed to authorities beyond the classroom. In
neither year did many students perceive a high level of
self-reporting ("0%" the majority estimate—chosen by 59% in
1961 and 69% currently).
These indicated trends in the percentage estimates are
confirmed by another set of responses elsewhere in the
questionnaire:

Unfortunately, our 1961 data are in the form of com
puter print-out rather than IBM cards, so we are unable to
examine the relationships between these value endorsements
and other variables of obvious interest—like self-reports of
cheating. As we will discuss later in Section 4, 1976 respon
dents who agree strongly with some of these statements are
conspicuously different from their fellow-students in several
other ways as well.
RESPONSES TO HYPOTHETICAL CHEATING SITUA
TIONS
Earlier we examined responses about cheating actually
observed; here we inquire what our responses would do if
they observed cheating.
"Suppose you saw a student cheating on a test or exam.
What would you do?"
1961 1976
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 4% 5%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 22 3
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 36 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 14 33
Ignore the incident 2525
In both years, one-quarter of the students in this hypothe
tical situation would ignore the incident. Also in both years,
the modal choice is to express disapproval but not to report
the offender.
The big change is in the second most popular form of
social control-in 1961, it is to ask the person to report
himself and report him if he doesn't do so, and in 1976 it is
to mention the incident to others but not report it.

"How often have the following things happened that you
knowabout?"

As before, the areas of large change are in perceived
self-reporting and faculty alertness and activity, student
reporting of others is seen to be only slightly less frequent
now.
Student views of faculty are tapped in yet another way,
with consistent differences over time again evident.

Before considering behaviors and perceptions more di
rectly related to the Honor Code, we'll look briefly at some
value statements put to both undergraduate samples.
VALUES ABOUT HONESTY
Here we see some of the largest differences of any found
so far in our several analyses. There can be little doubt that
the changes in the "Agree Strongly" column below, especial
ly for the first two statements, constitute real differences
between our two samples.
Agree Agree Not Disagree Disagree

Reporting someone for cheating
is worse than cheating 3 4 10 7 12 19 38 31 38 38

It may seem surprising that only 26% of the 1961 sample
supported the reporting obligation of the Honor Code; but
other responses show that students also perceived some
student support for reporting in 1961—the combination of
general perception plus 26% commitment may well have
resulted in a social control system that effectively reduced
academic dishonesty.
Another hypothetical situation was posed:
1961 1976
Give him the answer 0% 2%
Say nothing but expose your paper
so he can copy the answer 4 2
Ignore or turn down his request 59 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 32 21
Report him to the appropriate
authorities 5 2
Two categories show 10-15% differences; ignoring or
rejecting such a request is a more popular option now, and
expressing disapproval informally is less popular. Neither
sample views reporting the request with much favor.
Both hypothetical situations were elaborated by changing
the identity of the cheater from an unspecified individual to
"a campus leader" and "a close friend"; the second situation
added a third, "some you disliked personally." In both years,
a friend observed cheating is less likely to be reported and
more likely to be informally disapproved of; campus leaders
>n both years are more severely treated than others—27% of
the 1961 sample, and 17% in 1976, would report him, and
only about 20% would ignore the incident.
For the solicited exam aid situation, our two samples are
similar with the following exceptions; whereas currently 21%
would cooperate with a friend's request, only 7% thought
they would do so in 1961; both samples are more likely to
express disapproval to a friend than to the other specified
offenders, 42% selecting this treatment of a friend in 1961,
and 30% in 1976. For neither sample is reporting a likely
option—even for campus leaders in 1961, the figure is only
7%.
This concludes our review of trend findings of key
interest to the SCLC. We have restricted our interpretive
comments to the analytic variety, indicating which differ
ences seemed, to us, worth serious attention.
Another level of interpretation, however, is needed with
respect to one blatant anomaly: How is it that individual
self-reported cheating is unchanged, but current students
report seeing more cheating than their predecessors? One
possible interpretation is simply that cheating is more conspi
cuous when it does occur; that the change in moral climate,
suggested by the value endorsement data, has both allowed
current cheaters to be more open in their activities and
opened more widely the eyes and ears of noncheaters. To the
extent that our 1976 data permit, we will examine these
possibilities in Section 4. Our aim here is to draw attention to
the phenomenon and encourage speculation.
1961 AND 1976 VIEWS ON THE PURPOSES OF A COL
LEGE EDUCATION
Several questions on the Bowers questionnaire, while not
related to the SCLC task, were so potentially interesting to
repeat 15 years later that we easily yielded to the temptation.
Students were asked to consider a list of purposes of a college
education, to indicate the importance of each purpose to the
respondent, and then to select that purpose considered most
important to the respondent.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Most
Important Purpose
1961 1976
gg Provide a basic general education and
appreciation of ideas
Provide vocational training; develop
skills and techniques directly
applicable to my career
Develop my ability to get along with
different kinds of people
Develop my knowledge and interest in the
® ® community and world problems
Help develop my moral capacities, ethical
® standards and values
Prepare me for a happy marriage
® and family life
Looking at these comparisons, it is hard to believe that 15
turbulent years have passed since the first survey. With two
exceptions, the differences are smaller than pollsters ex
pected to find over a one-week time span! Amidst such
constancy, the two shifts stand out sharply: Current students
attribute somewhat less importance to acquiring knowledge
about world problems (though the change is not large); and
our sample virtually rejects preparation for marriage as an
important purpose of college—in 1961, 53% assigned some
importance to this purpose, compared with 28% today.
With some trepidation, we also repeated the question,
"How well satisfied are you with your educational experience
at Stanford [at this school] ?"
1961 1976
Very well satisfied 38% 24%
Fairly well satisfied 55 63
Not very well satisfied 7 13
Not at all satisfied 0 0
The drop in the top category, while not huge, is big
enough to qualify as real. We did not inquire into reasons for
the respondents' level of satisfaction (nor did Bowers), and
thus cannot help those wishing to interpret or evaluate the
significance of this change.
Section 4: A Closer Look at Self-Reported Cheating
While we know more now about the state of academic
honesty at Stanford than we did prior to the survey, we still
should look closer at the correlates of self-reported cheating
activity.
Our data do not allow us to assign causality and statis
tically test alternative explanations of cheating behavior; we
can, however, change tactics from preceding sections and
focus on different levels of cheating—seeking related variables
that are potentially manipulable, be it by policy or informal
effort.
We make frequent use in this section of the three
"cheating indices" introd - "~ed in Section 1: Cheating Index,
"Serious" Cheating, and Exam Cheating. By cross-tabulating
each index with a wide range of variables, we looked for
differences between the three indices (e.g.. Are those who
admit to serious cheating different from those who admit to

what one SCLC member labeled "dilettante cheating"?), as
well as for differences between self-confessed cheaters of
whatever stripe and noncheaters.
First, we examine the hypothesis that noncheaters are
better informed about the contents of the Honor Code than
are those who cheat. We created a Knowledge Index based on
the quiz-type questions, high scores going to those with a
higher proportion of right answers. Cross-tabulating the
Knowledge Index with each cheating index produced no
difference worth reporting. It appears that our respondents
who cheat know neither more nor less about the Honor Code
than their contemporaries who don't cheat.
Perceived cheating is, not surprisingly, positively related
to self-reported cheating; the indices work similarly, but the
relationship shows most clearly in the example below:
"Since you have been at Stanford, have you seen another
student cheating during a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Never 61% 54% 29%
Once 9 8 9
A few times 23 27 39
Several times 5 7 11
Many times 2 3 12
Very Fairly Not very
Important Important Important
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
% % %
93 85 7 13 0 2
32 36 47 44 22 20
53 54 40 36 7 10
55 41 40 46 4 13
26 29 47 45 27 26
10 4 43 24 47 72
The biggest difference is between those who are high on
our index (N=s6), versus those who are medium or low. This
pattern reappears in response to the question, "What would
you do if you saw someone cheating on a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 9% 4% 4%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 5 4 0
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 42 37 23
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 28 29 39
Ignore the incident 16 25 34
Similarly, those who admit to having cheated are more
likely to have been asked for help during a test or exam; in
response to such a request, they are more likely to aid the
person or ignore the incident (versus reporting or expressing
disapproval).
Strong differences appear when the cheating index is
cross-tabulated with the three universalistic value statements
(again, all three cheating indices work similarly). The follow
ing table examplifies the differences found with respect to
the other value statements as well.
"Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified."
Cheating Index Score Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 74% 40% 26%
Agree mildly 23 14
Not sure 5 19 24
Disagree mildly 9 27
Disagree strongly 14 9

The differences seen above are substantially reduced when
respondents are asked to indicate their agreement with the
statement: "Honesty is desirable, but currently impossible at
Stanford."
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 10% 8% 11%
Agree mildly 12 16 24
Not sure 21 12 14
Disagree mildly 16 21 22
Disagree strongly 41 43 29
We also find no large differences with respect to level of
commitment to the current Honor Code, or to the serious
ness of the current level of academic dishonesty at Stanford.
There is a modest tendency for noncheaters to prefer proc
toring, but the differences are neither consistently related to
level of self-reported cheating nor larger than about 10%.
With respect to background variables, seniors tend to
appear in the medium and high categories on our scales (52%
of the "highs" are seniors). There is a discernable but
undramatic tendency for social science majors to be high,
engineering and science majors medium, and humanities low.
There is a similar consistent, modest tendency for students
with professional school plans to score higher on our indices
than those planning to attend graduate school.
A final small correlation that is packed with interpretative
potential: Noncheaters are more likely to be "very satisfied"
with their educational experiences at Stanford than respon
dents scoring medium or high (% "very satisfied," 33%, 24%,
and 18% respectively).
Since our largest unexpected differences, both here and in
the 1961 comparisons, have involved three value statements,
we decided to look more closely at our respondents' value
endorsements. We created an index called Strong Values, ana
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each respondent according
to how many times he indicated strong agreement with these
statements:
1) Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified.
2) Students are morally obligated not to cheat.
3) Cheating directly contradicts the goals of education.
Our population split very neatly into the four categories,
about 25% in each.
Our subsequent cross-tabulations yielded interesting re
sults, which we will first summarize, and then examine some
details. Respondents with high scores on our Strong Values
index are much less aware of, involved in, and opinionated
about all matters related to cheating at Stanford. Their
responses to hypothetical cheating situations are very likely
to include expressing disapproval, even to friends (similar to
the 1961 response for the whole sample).
They learn about cheating primarily from official
channels, and about the Honor Code from signing blue
books. They are more likely to indicate strong belief in the
Honor Code, and to believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty constitutes a moderate or serious problem They
do not, however, hold consistently different perceptions of
fellow students or faculty with respect to Honor Code
support, nor are their opinions about specific aspects of the
Honor Code different from their fellow respondents. They
are not conspicuously either for or against proctoring; on
these and other questions soliciting opinions about hypothe
tical effects or the attitudes of others, they are more likely to
check "not sure."
They are, in sum, an interesting, not easily comprehen
sible, group of people—slightly more likely to be female and
majoring in the humanities, unlikely to be seniors, and more
likely to be very satisfied with their educational experience at
Stanford.
The tables that follow show the most impressive of the
differences discussed above. Other tables referred to but not
presented below are in the appendices.

Another section of the questionnaire elicited many speci
fic course characteristics of courses taken winter quarter by
our respondents. Among other things, they were asked about
the extent and types of cheating that occurred in the two
winter courses they liked best, and the one liked least.
Each single cheating item received too few mentions to be
useful to us, so we grouped together all mentions of any type
or level of cheating for the course liked best and created an
index, and similarly for the course liked least. Only 17
nonzero scores are on the first index (mentions of cheating
instances), and 36 on the course-liked-least index. The index
items are:
Respondent personally knew about or learned about. . . .
* Any other students cheating on the final exam, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on tests other than the
final, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on homework or lab
assignments, and/or;
* At least half the other students cheating at one or
another time during the course.
We were interested in learning what types of courses were
likely settings for cheating; by cross-tabulating the other
course characteristics against the index scores, we identified
several characteristics differentiating courses with observed
cheating from other courses.
Those courses liked best in which cheating occurred were
likely to be introductory, have more than 30 students
enrolled, and have short-answer exams (versus open-book,
essay, or take-homes). Past tests were likely to be available
for study purposes, seating was staggered during exams, and
either a TA or the instructor was likely to remain in the room
during exams.
Those observing cheating are likely to be high on our
cheating indices, which supports our earlier conclusion that
those who observe cheating are themselves more likely to
cheat. The course-least-liked index tables show similar results.
On the whole, we suspect that the attempt in this section
to understand better students who cheat and settings con
ducive to cheating events has produced results more useful to
the student of social deviance than to the concerned policy
evaluator.
The characteristics most obviously related to self-reported
cheating are value stances of a special, universalistic sort—a

trait probably not nurtured during the undergraduate years,
or seniors would not be conspicuously absent from the group
of high scorers on our values index.
With respect to the finding that those who cheat are much
more likely to observe other cheating, our data don't allow us
to establish the order of the relationship—i.e., does own
cheating heighten awareness and thus perceptions of others'
cheating, or does one begin cheating in response to observing
it? Probably both processes occur, but we cannot disentangle
them.
One main policy modification, the introduction of op
tional or mandatory proctoring of exams, is not strongly or
consistently favored by our population of noncheaters, nor
by the overlapping subgroup of those high on our values
index. Proctoring already exists in some classes, and our
respondents are more likely to report instances of cheating in
courses with proctored exams.
That does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that
proctoring is ineffective; that students do see cheating in
proctored exam courses may, however, help to explain the
lack of widespread support for proctoring as a solution to the
ills of academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
We have examined, described, and assessed a large amount
of data on Stanford students—their personal honesty, their
valuation of honesty, their experiences with and perceptions
of academic dishonesty among their fellow students, their
concern about cheating, their attitudes toward and know
ledge of the Honor Code, and their opinions about possible
modifications of the current system. What, after all this, can
we safely assert that we know?
First, and perhaps most important, is the conclusion that
Stanford does not currently have a "cheating problem";
those who have worried about a West Point level scandal may
sleep soundly, at least for a while. While cheating continues
to exist in academic endeavors, our data show that the
incidence of self-reported cheating among undergraduates is
approximately the same now as it was in 1961.
The increased selectivity exercised in undergraduate ad
missions may account in part for this lack of change;
although the pressures on students have certainly increased,
the student body includes fewer undergraduates who cannot
cope with the academic demands made of them
The picture is not entirely rosy, however. Indeed, it is
only a slight exaggeration to state that the low incidence of
cheating is independent of the current control system rather
than a result of it. Students are not knowledgeable about the
contents of the Honor Code, nor is the majority highly
committed to it. They similarly perceive their fellow students
and faculty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not
actually indifferent or opposed to it. The crux of the matter
is that the system is not seen to be working.
Students are both more aware of the cheating that does
exist, and less willing to report offenders (or ask them to
report themselves). Nor do they see faculty members filling
the activity gap as either police or advocates. (As our report
on the faculty surveys will state, this perception of the
faculty is essentially correct.)
There is no evidence that personal moral standards have
declined at Stanford, though the willingness to hold others to
universalistic standards seems to have declined substantially.
The 25% of our sample who do endorse the several
universalistic value statements in the questionnaire, and who
are substantially more willing to observe the reporting obliga
tion—these students are not, apparently, very visible or very
vocal among their fellow students. They do not have as much
experience with instances of cheating as the rest of the
sample; and, or course, it may be lack of experience which
permits them to predict that their hypothetical behavior
would differ from that of the majority.
We find no strong support for exam proctoring, even
among those subgroups most aware of and concerned about
levels of cheating.
The minority most exposed to cheating seem to favor
unilateral solutions, while the rest are more likely to reject
proctoring or prefer it as a faculty and/or student option. In
short, both the need to modify the current Honor Code, and
the appropriateness of alternative modifications continue to
be judgmental matters: our data provide no clear answers.
Our own interpretation—and it is merely that—is that
Stanford's Honor Code suffers primarily from invisibility
ignorance and apathy better describe our sample than dis
honesty and anxiety. While some modifications may be in
order (e.g., eliminating the reporting obligation, and per
mitting proctoring at studen' and/or instructor preference), it
is premature to consider abandoning the current system.
An educational program is needed, not simply on the
contents of the Code but also on topics like "What plagiarism
is and how to avoid it." (English and communication have
such a statement and some faculty members, at least, distri
bute copies to their students.)
People who throw out the baby with the bath water are
usually unaware that the baby is there; and until the
presence, characteristics, and value of the Honor Code are
widely known on campus, hasty action—like pulling the
plug—would be both unnecessary and undesirable.
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %
Do you consider yourself to be:
Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 52 46
Not well informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 35 44
The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66
Support it by their behavior? 75 68
Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:
% replying "Yes" to Undergrad Grad
1. "Padding" a few items on a biblio- 23 8
graphy
2. Copying a few sentences of material 35 13
without footnoting in a paper
3. Copying answers from a text or other 28 13
source instead of doing the work indepen
dently
4. Writing a paper for another student 3 3
5. Getting questions or answers from
someone who has already taken the same
exam 13 8
6. Giving answers to other students
during an exam 8 5
7. Arranging with other students to give
or receive answers by use of signals 1 0
8. Arranging to sit next to someone who
will let you copy from him during a test or
exam 4 0
9. Copying from someone's test or exam
paper without his knowing it 10 3
10. Taking an exam for another student 1 0
11. Having another student take an
exam for you 0 0
12. Working on the same homework
with several students when the teacher does
not allow it 12 12

Because the actions range from trivial to serious, and
these distributions count acts, not individuals, we construc
ted three indices of so-called cheating behavior. The first
index counts the number of respondents who checked at
least one item of the 1 7-item set shown above. The second
index is also a count, but excludes items 1-3 above. The third
index counts examination cheating only (items 5-10, 14-15).

Our respondent's perceptions of the amount of cheatiny
among their fellow students are most usefully viewed in the
context of their self-reports of cheating, a topic addressed in
Section 4, and in comparison with the 1961 data, discussed
in Section 3. Suffice it to say here that undergraduates
perceive substantially more cheating than do graduate stu
dents:

Respondents were asked to estimate, in percentage terms,
levels and types of cheating, levels of discovered cheating,
types of discipline imposed, etc. It is surprising, given their
differences in personal observation of cheating, that the
percentage estimates provided by graduates and undergradu
ates are quite similar. Some examples follow:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage have cheated since coming to Stanford."

Our respondents were asked how they learned about most
of the cases of cheating and plagiarim that they know about.
The student grapevine predominates among undergraduates,
but not for graduates:
Undergrads Grads
Observing the instances yourself 19% 23%
Hearing about them from the offenders 8 4
Hearing about them from other students
on the grapevine 55 33
Hearing about them through official channels
(e.g.. The Daily, Dean's Office,
a faculty member, etc.) 18 40
We turn now to two questions which will be reexamined
from other angles in subsequent sections of this report.
Though not directly addressing Honor Code issues, they
indicate the amount of support for the "reporting obliga
tion"—that observers of cheating report the offenders. The
low support expressed is all the more striking because the
questions pose hypothetical situations:
Suppose you saw a student cheating. What would you do?
Undergrads Grads
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 5% (1) 10%
Ask him to report himself and report him
if he fails to do so 3 ( (3) 10
Express disapproval informally but not
report him 34 (68) 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 33 (5) 17
Ignore the incident 25 (23) 29
Graduates and undergraduates agree about how their
behavior would change were the offender "a close friend":
the undergraduate percentages are shown in parentheses
above. If the offender were "a campus leader," however,
reporting becomes somewhat more likely, increasing to 17%
for undergraduates and 28% for graduates.
The second hypothetical question shows only small differ
ences between graduates and undergraduates; the percentages
below are for the undergraduate respondents.
If someone asked you for help during a test or exam,
what would you do?
Undergrad %
Give him the answer 2
Say nothing but expose your paper so
he can copy the answer 2
Ignore or turn down his request 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 21
Report him to the appropriate authorities 2
If the person seeking help were a friend, the percentage
selecting the first or second option increases to 21%; re
actions to "a campus leader" or "someone you disliked
personally" are not substantially different from those shown
above for an unspecified person.
One question attempts to assess in a global sort of way
"the cheating problem":
"Do you believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty at Stanford poses a serious threat to the academic
process?"
Undergrad %
Yes, very serious 11
Moderately serious 32
Not very serious 55

Between one-fifth ana about half of the undergraduate

Graduate student responses differ in that many more
appear in the No Opinion column; when preferences are
expressed, they are in the same direction as those shown
above for undergraduates.
Asked who should serve as exam proctors, class instruc
tors and graduate TAs—in that order—are overwhelmingly
preferred over students from outside the class. Similarly, the
majority of respondents think that students should not
participate in "identifying and selecting from a pool of
potential proctors":

Finally, students were asked what probable effects would
result from instituting exam proctoring. Below we show the
undergraduate responses; where graduate responses are sub
stantially different, they appear in parentheses.
The incidence of cheating on examinations
would be reduced. 71%
Students would no longer feel obliged to report
the dishonesty of others on examinations 67 (50)
An Honor Code would lose meaning 58 (43)
A meaningful Honor Code would cease to exist 47 (26)
Students would feel threatened by the lack
of trust 44 ( 32)
Students would feel protected from a
minority of dishonest students 43
The incident of cheating in other areas would
increase (e.g., take-home exams, lab reports). 16
Students would no longer feel obliged to behave
honestly on examinations 12
We now turn, in the following sections, to more detailed
considerations of the results of our study, broadly and
briskly described above.
Section 2: The Role of Background Characteristics
It is a truism of social research that one can always find
background characteristics of respondents which correlate—at
impressive statistical levels—with the dependent variables
under scrutiny. This study is no exception.
Separately for graduates and undergraduates, we cross
tabulated a range of background characteristics with a long
but selective list of variables concerning values, perceptions,
and behaviors. We found many, many differences; undergrad
uate class, academic department, and—to a lesser extent
graduate school intentions, sex, and citizenship, all show
correlations with many of our value and behavior indicators.
In the interests of brevity, clarity, and progress, we have
selected from this mass of data in two ways: first, only those
findings of central policy interest to the SCLC are being
reported here; and second, only those patterns of relation
ships which are internally consistent will receive attention.
An example which meets the first criterion but fails the
second: Freshmen and sophomores are more likely to know
that the Honor Code prohibits proctoring, but less likely to
agree that the Honor Code "regulates faculty behavior." Both
relationships are statistically significant; viewed together,
however, they don't make sense and are better politely
dismissed than puzzled over (e.g., "It appears that undergrad
uate class is not systematically related to knowledge of
Honor Code contents.")
Tables showing the relationships described in this section
r,ro available in the appendices. Throughout what follows,
"sophomores" should be understood to include our four
token freshmen.
Undergraduate class relates in a variety of ways to several
key variables, especially perceptions of cheating. Honor Code
commitment, and attitudes toward proctoring. Sophomores
have seen less cheating and fewer instances of students
reporting others for cheating; they are, however, slightly
more likely to have seen instructors ignoring cheating behav
ior. Although their self-reported cheating varies only slightly
from that of upperclassmen, sophomores are more likely to
worry about false accusations of cheating.
Sophomores are especially likely to state that the Honor
Code system should be altered, and least likely to describe
themselves as believing strongly in the current system. They
favor the introduction of exam proctoring more than upper
classmen do, especially in classes with enrollments over 30,
and/or in required preprofessional classes.
Sophomores' attitudes and experiences extend to their
perceptions of other students and faculty: they are least
likely to think other students favor continuation of the
current Honor Code; while more likely to believe that faculty
know about the Honor Code and its requirements, they are
least likely to think faculty favor its continuation or support
it by their behavior.
Differences by undergraduate major are, by and large,
inconsistent and statistically small—few exceed 10%. There is
some tendency for respondents in social science departments
to see a world that is consistently slightly different from that
seen by others; the humanities, science, and engineering
students do not generally differ greatly from each other in
patterned or consistent ways.
Social science majors are distinctive in the following
respects: they report having seen more cheating, more often
been asked for help on exams, more often observed an
instructor ignoring cheating, knowing of more instances of
students reporting offenders, and more likely to think that
the current level of academic dishonesty poses a serious
threat to the educational process.
Their self-reports of cheating are high on three of the six
items where area of major shows a difference; unlike the
other disciplinary areas, they are low on no item. They do
not, however, conspicuously favor exam proctoring; indeed,
they are least willing to proctor "as a University obligation,"
though the percent willing doubles "if paid" (the other
disciplinary areas show a decrease in willingness if proctoring
were a paid job). While not especially in favor of any of the
proctoring options, social science majors are least likely to
believe that an effect of proctoring would be that "the Honor
Code would lose meaning."
Many of the areas in which social science majors differ
from our other undergraduate respondents also differentiate
between undergraduates with professional school versus grad
uate school intentions.
On all variables relating to knowledge of cheating, general
perceptions of the extent of cheating, and self-reported
cheating, either no differences appear or the profession
oriented students are higher—i.e., more aware of cheating and
higher rates of self-reported cheating.
On the Honor Code quiz, profession-oriented students are
less likely to know that exam proctoring is prohibited; later
questions show them to be more in favor of mandatory
proctoring, slightly more willing to proctor as an obligation,
and much more willing to proctor if paid to do so.
The two groups also differ in the results they would
expect from proctoring: graduate school-oriented students
believe that students would feel threatened, while the profes
sion-oriented think that "feeling protected" is a more likely
outcome.
Sex and ethnic background are generally unrewarding
variables in this study. Two self-reported cheating items, both
referring to copying from another's paper during an exam,
show women less likely—by 10% or more—to cheat in this
fashion.
Women are more likely to consider themselves "not well
informed" about the Honor Code, though their quiz scores
are no worse than the men's. Mandatory proctoring receives
more support from women; other proctoring options, how
ever, are not conspicuously supported by one sex or the
other. Favorable effects of proctoring—e.g., that students
would feel protected—are cited more frequently by women;
men are more likely to respond that an Honor Code would
lose meaning and/or that a meaningful Honor Code would
cease to exist.
The ethnic background tables include both graduates and
undergraduates in order to obtain a statistically comfortable
number of "non-Caucasian" respondents (black, chicano,
Spanish surname, native American, Asian American, or

"other"). The ethnic conglomerate may be meaningless; but,
in any case, being "non-Caucasian" does not relate consis
tently or significantly to any of the behavioral or attitudinal
variables in our study.
Background Variables and the Graduate Sample
The obvious and occasionally interesting differences dis
cussed with respect to our undergraduate respondents are
not, in general, evident among the graduate respondents in
our sample. There are not as many cases, and two areas
(Earth Sciences and H & S Humanities) include too few cases
to allow attention to comparative percentages.
The reader may remember from Section 1 that experience
with and awareness of academic dishonesty is signfficantly
lower among Stanford's graduate student population. One
result of this difference is that is is less rewarding—indeed
discouragint—to examine departmental or other background
variables with respect to the respondent's own cheating or
awareness of it: there are simply too few cases to yield
dependable percentages. Thus we have a reduced set of
variables to examine; however—to the extent that any disci
plinary area stands out as consistently different from the
other two—it is, at the graduate level, that of H & S science
and math students.
Not many variables, even with the reduced set, show
disciplinary differences. Those that do tend to be those
discussed both earlier and later in this report—those items
with respect to which, for a variety of reasons, our sample
respondents seem to differ. On these variables, shown in
tabular form in the appendices, graduate students in H & S
science and math departments come through as personally
moral pessimists.
The differences are neither wholly consistent nor statis
tically awesome, but it appears that the science/math sub
group is more likely to endorse the broadly-stated values of
honesty, to not worry much personally about cheating, and
to cheat less; to perceive less Honor Code support and
knowledge among fellow-students and faculty; and to not
favor the proctoring remedy, anticipating several ill effects.
With flags of caution waving wildly, we close this section
with a few comments about the graduate student population
who are not U.S. citizens. It is a small group (only 18
respondents), and hence the need for caution. The differ
ences in responses between citizens and noncitizens, however,
are surprisingly consistent over a range of variables—unlike
our results with the "non-Caucasian" background variable.
To summarize the tables which appear in the appendices,
value statements which citizens tend to endorse (e.g. "Most
students want to be honest."), noncitizens indicate "Not
Sure"; others which citizens tend to disagree with (e.g.,
"Reporting someone for cheating is worse than cheating"),
noncitizens tend to endorse. They express less commitment
to the Honor Code and perceive less support among other
students. They are less supportive of (or less opinionated
about) various proctoring options, less willing to serve as
proctors, and likely to expect more negative results to follow
the introduction of proctoring. These several areas of differ
ence are not always statistically large, but the fact that
differences consistently appear is deserving of some atten
tion.
Section 3: Some Comparisons Between 1961 and 1976
Before discussing the results of our comparisons over
time, it is appropriate to restate some of the differences
between the studies which restrict the ease with which our
comparisons may safely lead to firm conclusions:
1) The 1961 results are based on only 75 undergraduates,
a 75% response rate from the sample;
2) The 1961 study was nationwide, sponsored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and covered many topics related to
social control processes, whereas our study is internally
sponsored and relatively narrow in scope; and
3) The representation of freshmen in the 1961 survey
was proportional to their population size, which is not true
of 1976 freshmen.
On the positive side, the questions we chose to repeat are
identical in wording and response categories to the 1961
versions; also, background items for which we have other
sources of trend data—e.g., sex, age, grade average, ethnic
background, and type of campus housing—show changes very
similar to those in the questionnaire responses.
We will discuss several interesting comparisons in this
section; attention will focus first, however, on four findings
of special interest to the SCLC.
First, contrary to prevailing opinion, our data show no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976.
Second, current students are more likely to have actually
seen instances of cheating, and to perceive-in a general
way—that more cheating exists, than was true of their
predecessors.
Third, there is a notable drop in expressed support for
value statements concerning honesty, especially those with a
universal tone—e.g., "Under no circumstances is cheating ever
justified."
Fourth, support for the reporting aspect of the Honor
Code has indeed declined; in 1961, about one-quarter of the
sample would, m a hypothetical cheating situation, report the

offender or ask that he report himself—compared to less than
10% who say they would do so in 1976.
Self-Reports of Academic Dishonesty
The fo;lowing self-reports were solicited in 1961 and
1976 with the results shown in the two columns to the right:
Check all the following which you have done at Stanford.

Another set of questions allowed five responses ranging
from "Never" to "Many times"; so few persons, in either
year, selected the fourth or fifth categories, that we show
below only the predominent response categories.

The lack of change shown above is worth notice; where
there are changes—in either direction—they are too small to
warrant serious attention. It is, we believe, a safe conclusion
that self-reported acts of cheating are unchanged between
1961 and 1976. (We should point out that in Bowers' 1961
data, the Stanford level of cheating was found to be very low
in a nation-wide context. Even on those questions which
show an increase between 1961 and 1976, the current
Stanford percent is below the nationwide 1961 sample
percent.)
PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIC
DISHONESTY
Here we see some substantial differences. In both years,
students were asked, "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], have you seen another student cheating during a
test or exam?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 76% 49% Once 12% 9% A few 7% 29%

Never 88% 78% Once 8% 8% A few

Several Many
times 1% 2% times 0% 1%
It seems indisputable that current students are more likely
to have personally witnessed cheating activity. Regardless of
their own experience, they also hold different perceptions of
the extent of academic dishonesty and the functioning of
disciplinary processes. Students in both years were asked to
estimate, in percentage terms, the frequency of the following
events:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage has cheated since coming to Stanford."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-15%) 42% 35%
Medium estimate (16-60%) 37 51
High estimate (above 60%) 21 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate

Medium estimate (5-15%) 50 43
High estimate (above 15%) 23 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are

by the course instructor."
1961 1976

Medium estimate (71-97%) 68 34
High estimate (above 97%) 0 19
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarized and are

other students."

High estimate (above 65%) 11 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage report them
selves. "
1961 1976
Low estimate (0%) 59% 69%
Medium estimate (1-10%) 28 26
High estimate (above 10%) 13 6
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 90% 49%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 9 47
High estimate (above 85%) 1 4
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases disciplinary action is taken by the course
instructor.
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-35%) 48% 39%
Medium estimate (36-90%) 40 52
High estimate (above 90%) 12 9
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty

1961 1976
Low estimate (0-5%) 19% 32%
Medium estimate (6-50%) 39 56
High estimate (above 50%) 42 11
Comparing percentage distributions of percentage esti
mates can be quite confusing. Some differences, however,
come through quite clearly: 1961 respondents estimated a
higher "discovery rate" for cheaters, expected more disco
veries to be made by faculty, and substantially more cheating
cases being passed to authorities beyond the classroom. In
neither year did many students perceive a high level of
self-reporting ("0%" the majority estimate—chosen by 59% in
1961 and 69% currently).
These indicated trends in the percentage estimates are
confirmed by another set of responses elsewhere in the
questionnaire:

Unfortunately, our 1961 data are in the form of com
puter print-out rather than IBM cards, so we are unable to
examine the relationships between these value endorsements
and other variables of obvious interest—like self-reports of
cheating. As we will discuss later in Section 4, 1976 respon
dents who agree strongly with some of these statements are
conspicuously different from their fellow-students in several
other ways as well.
RESPONSES TO HYPOTHETICAL CHEATING SITUA
TIONS
Earlier we examined responses about cheating actually
observed; here we inquire what our responses would do if
they observed cheating.
"Suppose you saw a student cheating on a test or exam.
What would you do?"
1961 1976
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 4% 5%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 22 3
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 36 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 14 33
Ignore the incident 2525
In both years, one-quarter of the students in this hypothe
tical situation would ignore the incident. Also in both years,
the modal choice is to express disapproval but not to report
the offender.
The big change is in the second most popular form of
social control-in 1961, it is to ask the person to report
himself and report him if he doesn't do so, and in 1976 it is
to mention the incident to others but not report it.

"How often have the following things happened that you
knowabout?"

It may seem surprising that only 26% of the 1961 sample
supported the reporting obligation of the Honor Code; but
other responses show that students also perceived some
student support for reporting in 1961—the combination of
general perception plus 26% commitment may well have
resulted in a social control system that effectively reduced
academic dishonesty.
Another hypothetical situation was posed:
1961 1976
Give him the answer 0% 2%
Say nothing but expose your paper
so he can copy the answer 4 2
Ignore or turn down his request 59 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 32 21
Report him to the appropriate
authorities 5 2
Two categories show 10-15% differences; ignoring or
rejecting such a request is a more popular option now, and
expressing disapproval informally is less popular. Neither
sample views reporting the request with much favor.
Both hypothetical situations were elaborated by changing
the identity of the cheater from an unspecified individual to
"a campus leader" and "a close friend"; the second situation
added a third, "some you disliked personally." In both years,
a friend observed cheating is less likely to be reported and
more likely to be informally disapproved of; campus leaders
>n both years are more severely treated than others—27% of
the 1961 sample, and 17% in 1976, would report him, and
only about 20% would ignore the incident.
For the solicited exam aid situation, our two samples are
similar with the following exceptions; whereas currently 21%
would cooperate with a friend's request, only 7% thought
they would do so in 1961; both samples are more likely to
express disapproval to a friend than to the other specified
offenders, 42% selecting this treatment of a friend in 1961,
and 30% in 1976. For neither sample is reporting a likely
option—even for campus leaders in 1961, the figure is only
7%.
This concludes our review of trend findings of key
interest to the SCLC. We have restricted our interpretive
comments to the analytic variety, indicating which differ
ences seemed, to us, worth serious attention.
Another level of interpretation, however, is needed with
respect to one blatant anomaly: How is it that individual
self-reported cheating is unchanged, but current students
report seeing more cheating than their predecessors? One
possible interpretation is simply that cheating is more conspi
cuous when it does occur; that the change in moral climate,
suggested by the value endorsement data, has both allowed
current cheaters to be more open in their activities and
opened more widely the eyes and ears of noncheaters. To the
extent that our 1976 data permit, we will examine these
possibilities in Section 4. Our aim here is to draw attention to
the phenomenon and encourage speculation.
1961 AND 1976 VIEWS ON THE PURPOSES OF A COL
LEGE EDUCATION
Several questions on the Bowers questionnaire, while not
related to the SCLC task, were so potentially interesting to
repeat 15 years later that we easily yielded to the temptation.
Students were asked to consider a list of purposes of a college
education, to indicate the importance of each purpose to the
respondent, and then to select that purpose considered most
important to the respondent.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Most
Important Purpose
1961 1976
gg Provide a basic general education and
appreciation of ideas
Provide vocational training; develop
skills and techniques directly
applicable to my career
Develop my ability to get along with
different kinds of people
Develop my knowledge and interest in the
® ® community and world problems
Help develop my moral capacities, ethical
® standards and values
Prepare me for a happy marriage
® and family life
Looking at these comparisons, it is hard to believe that 15
turbulent years have passed since the first survey. With two
exceptions, the differences are smaller than pollsters ex
pected to find over a one-week time span! Amidst such
constancy, the two shifts stand out sharply: Current students
attribute somewhat less importance to acquiring knowledge
about world problems (though the change is not large); and
our sample virtually rejects preparation for marriage as an
important purpose of college—in 1961, 53% assigned some
importance to this purpose, compared with 28% today.
With some trepidation, we also repeated the question,
"How well satisfied are you with your educational experience
at Stanford [at this school] ?"
1961 1976
Very well satisfied 38% 24%
Fairly well satisfied 55 63
Not very well satisfied 7 13
Not at all satisfied 0 0
The drop in the top category, while not huge, is big
enough to qualify as real. We did not inquire into reasons for
the respondents' level of satisfaction (nor did Bowers), and
thus cannot help those wishing to interpret or evaluate the
significance of this change.
Section 4: A Closer Look at Self-Reported Cheating
While we know more now about the state of academic
honesty at Stanford than we did prior to the survey, we still
should look closer at the correlates of self-reported cheating
activity.
Our data do not allow us to assign causality and statis
tically test alternative explanations of cheating behavior; we
can, however, change tactics from preceding sections and
focus on different levels of cheating—seeking related variables
that are potentially manipulable, be it by policy or informal
effort.
We make frequent use in this section of the three
"cheating indices" introd - "~ed in Section 1: Cheating Index,
"Serious" Cheating, and Exam Cheating. By cross-tabulating
each index with a wide range of variables, we looked for
differences between the three indices (e.g.. Are those who
admit to serious cheating different from those who admit to

what one SCLC member labeled "dilettante cheating"?), as
well as for differences between self-confessed cheaters of
whatever stripe and noncheaters.
First, we examine the hypothesis that noncheaters are
better informed about the contents of the Honor Code than
are those who cheat. We created a Knowledge Index based on
the quiz-type questions, high scores going to those with a
higher proportion of right answers. Cross-tabulating the
Knowledge Index with each cheating index produced no
difference worth reporting. It appears that our respondents
who cheat know neither more nor less about the Honor Code
than their contemporaries who don't cheat.
Perceived cheating is, not surprisingly, positively related
to self-reported cheating; the indices work similarly, but the
relationship shows most clearly in the example below:
"Since you have been at Stanford, have you seen another
student cheating during a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Never 61% 54% 29%
Once 9 8 9
A few times 23 27 39
Several times 5 7 11
Many times 2 3 12
Very Fairly Not very
Important Important Important
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
% % %
93 85 7 13 0 2
32 36 47 44 22 20
53 54 40 36 7 10
55 41 40 46 4 13
26 29 47 45 27 26
10 4 43 24 47 72
The biggest difference is between those who are high on
our index (N=s6), versus those who are medium or low. This
pattern reappears in response to the question, "What would
you do if you saw someone cheating on a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 9% 4% 4%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 5 4 0
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 42 37 23
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 28 29 39
Ignore the incident 16 25 34
Similarly, those who admit to having cheated are more
likely to have been asked for help during a test or exam; in
response to such a request, they are more likely to aid the
person or ignore the incident (versus reporting or expressing
disapproval).
Strong differences appear when the cheating index is
cross-tabulated with the three universalistic value statements
(again, all three cheating indices work similarly). The follow
ing table examplifies the differences found with respect to
the other value statements as well.
"Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified."
Cheating Index Score Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 74% 40% 26%
Agree mildly 23 14
Not sure 5 19 24
Disagree mildly 9 27
Disagree strongly 14 9

The differences seen above are substantially reduced when
respondents are asked to indicate their agreement with the
statement: "Honesty is desirable, but currently impossible at
Stanford."
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 10% 8% 11%
Agree mildly 12 16 24
Not sure 21 12 14
Disagree mildly 16 21 22
Disagree strongly 41 43 29
We also find no large differences with respect to level of
commitment to the current Honor Code, or to the serious
ness of the current level of academic dishonesty at Stanford.
There is a modest tendency for noncheaters to prefer proc
toring, but the differences are neither consistently related to
level of self-reported cheating nor larger than about 10%.
With respect to background variables, seniors tend to
appear in the medium and high categories on our scales (52%
of the "highs" are seniors). There is a discernable but
undramatic tendency for social science majors to be high,
engineering and science majors medium, and humanities low.
There is a similar consistent, modest tendency for students
with professional school plans to score higher on our indices
than those planning to attend graduate school.
A final small correlation that is packed with interpretative
potential: Noncheaters are more likely to be "very satisfied"
with their educational experiences at Stanford than respon
dents scoring medium or high (% "very satisfied," 33%, 24%,
and 18% respectively).
Since our largest unexpected differences, both here and in
the 1961 comparisons, have involved three value statements,
we decided to look more closely at our respondents' value
endorsements. We created an index called Strong Values, ana
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each respondent according
to how many times he indicated strong agreement with these
statements:
1) Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified.
2) Students are morally obligated not to cheat.
3) Cheating directly contradicts the goals of education.
Our population split very neatly into the four categories,
about 25% in each.
Our subsequent cross-tabulations yielded interesting re
sults, which we will first summarize, and then examine some
details. Respondents with high scores on our Strong Values
index are much less aware of, involved in, and opinionated
about all matters related to cheating at Stanford. Their
responses to hypothetical cheating situations are very likely
to include expressing disapproval, even to friends (similar to
the 1961 response for the whole sample).
They learn about cheating primarily from official
channels, and about the Honor Code from signing blue
books. They are more likely to indicate strong belief in the
Honor Code, and to believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty constitutes a moderate or serious problem They
do not, however, hold consistently different perceptions of
fellow students or faculty with respect to Honor Code
support, nor are their opinions about specific aspects of the
Honor Code different from their fellow respondents. They
are not conspicuously either for or against proctoring; on
these and other questions soliciting opinions about hypothe
tical effects or the attitudes of others, they are more likely to
check "not sure."
They are, in sum, an interesting, not easily comprehen
sible, group of people—slightly more likely to be female and
majoring in the humanities, unlikely to be seniors, and more
likely to be very satisfied with their educational experience at
Stanford.
The tables that follow show the most impressive of the
differences discussed above. Other tables referred to but not
presented below are in the appendices.

Another section of the questionnaire elicited many speci
fic course characteristics of courses taken winter quarter by
our respondents. Among other things, they were asked about
the extent and types of cheating that occurred in the two
winter courses they liked best, and the one liked least.
Each single cheating item received too few mentions to be
useful to us, so we grouped together all mentions of any type
or level of cheating for the course liked best and created an
index, and similarly for the course liked least. Only 17
nonzero scores are on the first index (mentions of cheating
instances), and 36 on the course-liked-least index. The index
items are:
Respondent personally knew about or learned about. . . .
* Any other students cheating on the final exam, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on tests other than the
final, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on homework or lab
assignments, and/or;
* At least half the other students cheating at one or
another time during the course.
We were interested in learning what types of courses were
likely settings for cheating; by cross-tabulating the other
course characteristics against the index scores, we identified
several characteristics differentiating courses with observed
cheating from other courses.
Those courses liked best in which cheating occurred were
likely to be introductory, have more than 30 students
enrolled, and have short-answer exams (versus open-book,
essay, or take-homes). Past tests were likely to be available
for study purposes, seating was staggered during exams, and
either a TA or the instructor was likely to remain in the room
during exams.
Those observing cheating are likely to be high on our
cheating indices, which supports our earlier conclusion that
those who observe cheating are themselves more likely to
cheat. The course-least-liked index tables show similar results.
On the whole, we suspect that the attempt in this section
to understand better students who cheat and settings con
ducive to cheating events has produced results more useful to
the student of social deviance than to the concerned policy
evaluator.
The characteristics most obviously related to self-reported
cheating are value stances of a special, universalistic sort—a

trait probably not nurtured during the undergraduate years,
or seniors would not be conspicuously absent from the group
of high scorers on our values index.
With respect to the finding that those who cheat are much
more likely to observe other cheating, our data don't allow us
to establish the order of the relationship—i.e., does own
cheating heighten awareness and thus perceptions of others'
cheating, or does one begin cheating in response to observing
it? Probably both processes occur, but we cannot disentangle
them.
One main policy modification, the introduction of op
tional or mandatory proctoring of exams, is not strongly or
consistently favored by our population of noncheaters, nor
by the overlapping subgroup of those high on our values
index. Proctoring already exists in some classes, and our
respondents are more likely to report instances of cheating in
courses with proctored exams.
That does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that
proctoring is ineffective; that students do see cheating in
proctored exam courses may, however, help to explain the
lack of widespread support for proctoring as a solution to the
ills of academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
We have examined, described, and assessed a large amount
of data on Stanford students—their personal honesty, their
valuation of honesty, their experiences with and perceptions
of academic dishonesty among their fellow students, their
concern about cheating, their attitudes toward and know
ledge of the Honor Code, and their opinions about possible
modifications of the current system. What, after all this, can
we safely assert that we know?
First, and perhaps most important, is the conclusion that
Stanford does not currently have a "cheating problem";
those who have worried about a West Point level scandal may
sleep soundly, at least for a while. While cheating continues
to exist in academic endeavors, our data show that the
incidence of self-reported cheating among undergraduates is
approximately the same now as it was in 1961.
The increased selectivity exercised in undergraduate ad
missions may account in part for this lack of change;
although the pressures on students have certainly increased,
the student body includes fewer undergraduates who cannot
cope with the academic demands made of them
The picture is not entirely rosy, however. Indeed, it is
only a slight exaggeration to state that the low incidence of
cheating is independent of the current control system rather
than a result of it. Students are not knowledgeable about the
contents of the Honor Code, nor is the majority highly
committed to it. They similarly perceive their fellow students
and faculty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not
actually indifferent or opposed to it. The crux of the matter
is that the system is not seen to be working.
Students are both more aware of the cheating that does
exist, and less willing to report offenders (or ask them to
report themselves). Nor do they see faculty members filling
the activity gap as either police or advocates. (As our report
on the faculty surveys will state, this perception of the
faculty is essentially correct.)
There is no evidence that personal moral standards have
declined at Stanford, though the willingness to hold others to
universalistic standards seems to have declined substantially.
The 25% of our sample who do endorse the several
universalistic value statements in the questionnaire, and who
are substantially more willing to observe the reporting obliga
tion—these students are not, apparently, very visible or very
vocal among their fellow students. They do not have as much
experience with instances of cheating as the rest of the
sample; and, or course, it may be lack of experience which
permits them to predict that their hypothetical behavior
would differ from that of the majority.
We find no strong support for exam proctoring, even
among those subgroups most aware of and concerned about
levels of cheating.
The minority most exposed to cheating seem to favor
unilateral solutions, while the rest are more likely to reject
proctoring or prefer it as a faculty and/or student option. In
short, both the need to modify the current Honor Code, and
the appropriateness of alternative modifications continue to
be judgmental matters: our data provide no clear answers.
Our own interpretation—and it is merely that—is that
Stanford's Honor Code suffers primarily from invisibility
ignorance and apathy better describe our sample than dis
honesty and anxiety. While some modifications may be in
order (e.g., eliminating the reporting obligation, and per
mitting proctoring at studen' and/or instructor preference), it
is premature to consider abandoning the current system.
An educational program is needed, not simply on the
contents of the Code but also on topics like "What plagiarism
is and how to avoid it." (English and communication have
such a statement and some faculty members, at least, distri
bute copies to their students.)
People who throw out the baby with the bath water are
usually unaware that the baby is there; and until the
presence, characteristics, and value of the Honor Code are
widely known on campus, hasty action—like pulling the
plug—would be both unnecessary and undesirable.
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %

Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations

The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66

Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:

Because the actions range from trivial to serious, and
these distributions count acts, not individuals, we construc
ted three indices of so-called cheating behavior. The first
index counts the number of respondents who checked at
least one item of the 1 7-item set shown above. The second
index is also a count, but excludes items 1-3 above. The third
index counts examination cheating only (items 5-10, 14-15).

Our respondent's perceptions of the amount of cheatiny
among their fellow students are most usefully viewed in the
context of their self-reports of cheating, a topic addressed in
Section 4, and in comparison with the 1961 data, discussed
in Section 3. Suffice it to say here that undergraduates
perceive substantially more cheating than do graduate stu
dents:

Respondents were asked to estimate, in percentage terms,
levels and types of cheating, levels of discovered cheating,
types of discipline imposed, etc. It is surprising, given their
differences in personal observation of cheating, that the
percentage estimates provided by graduates and undergradu
ates are quite similar. Some examples follow:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage have cheated since coming to Stanford."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-15%) 35% 53%
Medium estimate (16-50%) 51 38
High estimate (above 15
High estimate (above 50%) 14 10
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheat frequently."
Undergrad Grad

High estimate (above 75%) 12 13

"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate

cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 49% 41%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 47 41
High estimate (above 85%) 4 18
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for

of the cases action is taken by the instructor."
Undergrad Grad

Medium estimate (36-90%) 52 42
High estimate (above 90%) 9 4
Our respondents were asked how they learned about most
of the cases of cheating and plagiarim that they know about.
The student grapevine predominates among undergraduates,
but not for graduates:
Undergrads Grads
Observing the instances yourself 19% 23%
Hearing about them from the offenders 8 4
Hearing about them from other students
on the grapevine 55 33
Hearing about them through official channels
(e.g.. The Daily, Dean's Office,
a faculty member, etc.) 18 40
We turn now to two questions which will be reexamined
from other angles in subsequent sections of this report.
Though not directly addressing Honor Code issues, they
indicate the amount of support for the "reporting obliga
tion"—that observers of cheating report the offenders. The
low support expressed is all the more striking because the
questions pose hypothetical situations:
Suppose you saw a student cheating. What would you do?
Undergrads Grads
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 5% (1) 10%
Ask him to report himself and report him
if he fails to do so 3 ( (3) 10
Express disapproval informally but not
report him 34 (68) 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 33 (5) 17
Ignore the incident 25 (23) 29
Graduates and undergraduates agree about how their
behavior would change were the offender "a close friend":
the undergraduate percentages are shown in parentheses
above. If the offender were "a campus leader," however,
reporting becomes somewhat more likely, increasing to 17%
for undergraduates and 28% for graduates.
The second hypothetical question shows only small differ
ences between graduates and undergraduates; the percentages
below are for the undergraduate respondents.
If someone asked you for help during a test or exam,
what would you do?
Undergrad %
Give him the answer 2
Say nothing but expose your paper so
he can copy the answer 2
Ignore or turn down his request 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 21
Report him to the appropriate authorities 2
If the person seeking help were a friend, the percentage
selecting the first or second option increases to 21%; re
actions to "a campus leader" or "someone you disliked
personally" are not substantially different from those shown
above for an unspecified person.
One question attempts to assess in a global sort of way
"the cheating problem":
"Do you believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty at Stanford poses a serious threat to the academic
process?"
Undergrad %
Yes, very serious 11
Moderately serious 32
Not very serious 55

Between one-fifth ana about half of the undergraduate
population support the introduction of examination proctor
ing, or allowing for proctoring as an option:

Graduate student responses differ in that many more
appear in the No Opinion column; when preferences are
expressed, they are in the same direction as those shown
above for undergraduates.
Asked who should serve as exam proctors, class instruc
tors and graduate TAs—in that order—are overwhelmingly
preferred over students from outside the class. Similarly, the
majority of respondents think that students should not
participate in "identifying and selecting from a pool of
potential proctors":

Finally, students were asked what probable effects would
result from instituting exam proctoring. Below we show the
undergraduate responses; where graduate responses are sub
stantially different, they appear in parentheses.
The incidence of cheating on examinations
would be reduced. 71%
Students would no longer feel obliged to report
the dishonesty of others on examinations 67 (50)
An Honor Code would lose meaning 58 (43)
A meaningful Honor Code would cease to exist 47 (26)
Students would feel threatened by the lack
of trust 44 ( 32)
Students would feel protected from a
minority of dishonest students 43
The incident of cheating in other areas would
increase (e.g., take-home exams, lab reports). 16
Students would no longer feel obliged to behave
honestly on examinations 12
We now turn, in the following sections, to more detailed
considerations of the results of our study, broadly and
briskly described above.
Section 2: The Role of Background Characteristics
It is a truism of social research that one can always find
background characteristics of respondents which correlate—at
impressive statistical levels—with the dependent variables
under scrutiny. This study is no exception.
Separately for graduates and undergraduates, we cross
tabulated a range of background characteristics with a long
but selective list of variables concerning values, perceptions,
and behaviors. We found many, many differences; undergrad
uate class, academic department, and—to a lesser extent
graduate school intentions, sex, and citizenship, all show
correlations with many of our value and behavior indicators.
In the interests of brevity, clarity, and progress, we have
selected from this mass of data in two ways: first, only those
findings of central policy interest to the SCLC are being
reported here; and second, only those patterns of relation
ships which are internally consistent will receive attention.
An example which meets the first criterion but fails the
second: Freshmen and sophomores are more likely to know
that the Honor Code prohibits proctoring, but less likely to
agree that the Honor Code "regulates faculty behavior." Both
relationships are statistically significant; viewed together,
however, they don't make sense and are better politely
dismissed than puzzled over (e.g., "It appears that undergrad
uate class is not systematically related to knowledge of
Honor Code contents.")
Tables showing the relationships described in this section
r,ro available in the appendices. Throughout what follows,
"sophomores" should be understood to include our four
token freshmen.
Undergraduate class relates in a variety of ways to several
key variables, especially perceptions of cheating. Honor Code
commitment, and attitudes toward proctoring. Sophomores
have seen less cheating and fewer instances of students
reporting others for cheating; they are, however, slightly
more likely to have seen instructors ignoring cheating behav
ior. Although their self-reported cheating varies only slightly
from that of upperclassmen, sophomores are more likely to
worry about false accusations of cheating.
Sophomores are especially likely to state that the Honor
Code system should be altered, and least likely to describe
themselves as believing strongly in the current system. They
favor the introduction of exam proctoring more than upper
classmen do, especially in classes with enrollments over 30,
and/or in required preprofessional classes.
Sophomores' attitudes and experiences extend to their
perceptions of other students and faculty: they are least
likely to think other students favor continuation of the
current Honor Code; while more likely to believe that faculty
know about the Honor Code and its requirements, they are
least likely to think faculty favor its continuation or support
it by their behavior.
Differences by undergraduate major are, by and large,
inconsistent and statistically small—few exceed 10%. There is
some tendency for respondents in social science departments
to see a world that is consistently slightly different from that
seen by others; the humanities, science, and engineering
students do not generally differ greatly from each other in
patterned or consistent ways.
Social science majors are distinctive in the following
respects: they report having seen more cheating, more often
been asked for help on exams, more often observed an
instructor ignoring cheating, knowing of more instances of
students reporting offenders, and more likely to think that
the current level of academic dishonesty poses a serious
threat to the educational process.
Their self-reports of cheating are high on three of the six
items where area of major shows a difference; unlike the
other disciplinary areas, they are low on no item. They do
not, however, conspicuously favor exam proctoring; indeed,
they are least willing to proctor "as a University obligation,"
though the percent willing doubles "if paid" (the other
disciplinary areas show a decrease in willingness if proctoring
were a paid job). While not especially in favor of any of the
proctoring options, social science majors are least likely to
believe that an effect of proctoring would be that "the Honor
Code would lose meaning."
Many of the areas in which social science majors differ
from our other undergraduate respondents also differentiate
between undergraduates with professional school versus grad
uate school intentions.
On all variables relating to knowledge of cheating, general
perceptions of the extent of cheating, and self-reported
cheating, either no differences appear or the profession
oriented students are higher—i.e., more aware of cheating and
higher rates of self-reported cheating.
On the Honor Code quiz, profession-oriented students are
less likely to know that exam proctoring is prohibited; later
questions show them to be more in favor of mandatory
proctoring, slightly more willing to proctor as an obligation,
and much more willing to proctor if paid to do so.
The two groups also differ in the results they would
expect from proctoring: graduate school-oriented students
believe that students would feel threatened, while the profes
sion-oriented think that "feeling protected" is a more likely
outcome.
Sex and ethnic background are generally unrewarding
variables in this study. Two self-reported cheating items, both
referring to copying from another's paper during an exam,
show women less likely—by 10% or more—to cheat in this
fashion.
Women are more likely to consider themselves "not well
informed" about the Honor Code, though their quiz scores
are no worse than the men's. Mandatory proctoring receives
more support from women; other proctoring options, how
ever, are not conspicuously supported by one sex or the
other. Favorable effects of proctoring—e.g., that students
would feel protected—are cited more frequently by women;
men are more likely to respond that an Honor Code would
lose meaning and/or that a meaningful Honor Code would
cease to exist.
The ethnic background tables include both graduates and
undergraduates in order to obtain a statistically comfortable
number of "non-Caucasian" respondents (black, chicano,
Spanish surname, native American, Asian American, or

"other"). The ethnic conglomerate may be meaningless; but,
in any case, being "non-Caucasian" does not relate consis
tently or significantly to any of the behavioral or attitudinal
variables in our study.
Background Variables and the Graduate Sample
The obvious and occasionally interesting differences dis
cussed with respect to our undergraduate respondents are
not, in general, evident among the graduate respondents in
our sample. There are not as many cases, and two areas
(Earth Sciences and H & S Humanities) include too few cases
to allow attention to comparative percentages.
The reader may remember from Section 1 that experience
with and awareness of academic dishonesty is signfficantly
lower among Stanford's graduate student population. One
result of this difference is that is is less rewarding—indeed
discouragint—to examine departmental or other background
variables with respect to the respondent's own cheating or
awareness of it: there are simply too few cases to yield
dependable percentages. Thus we have a reduced set of
variables to examine; however—to the extent that any disci
plinary area stands out as consistently different from the
other two—it is, at the graduate level, that of H & S science
and math students.
Not many variables, even with the reduced set, show
disciplinary differences. Those that do tend to be those
discussed both earlier and later in this report—those items
with respect to which, for a variety of reasons, our sample
respondents seem to differ. On these variables, shown in
tabular form in the appendices, graduate students in H & S
science and math departments come through as personally
moral pessimists.
The differences are neither wholly consistent nor statis
tically awesome, but it appears that the science/math sub
group is more likely to endorse the broadly-stated values of
honesty, to not worry much personally about cheating, and
to cheat less; to perceive less Honor Code support and
knowledge among fellow-students and faculty; and to not
favor the proctoring remedy, anticipating several ill effects.
With flags of caution waving wildly, we close this section
with a few comments about the graduate student population
who are not U.S. citizens. It is a small group (only 18
respondents), and hence the need for caution. The differ
ences in responses between citizens and noncitizens, however,
are surprisingly consistent over a range of variables—unlike
our results with the "non-Caucasian" background variable.
To summarize the tables which appear in the appendices,
value statements which citizens tend to endorse (e.g. "Most
students want to be honest."), noncitizens indicate "Not
Sure"; others which citizens tend to disagree with (e.g.,
"Reporting someone for cheating is worse than cheating"),
noncitizens tend to endorse. They express less commitment
to the Honor Code and perceive less support among other
students. They are less supportive of (or less opinionated
about) various proctoring options, less willing to serve as
proctors, and likely to expect more negative results to follow
the introduction of proctoring. These several areas of differ
ence are not always statistically large, but the fact that
differences consistently appear is deserving of some atten
tion.
Section 3: Some Comparisons Between 1961 and 1976
Before discussing the results of our comparisons over
time, it is appropriate to restate some of the differences
between the studies which restrict the ease with which our
comparisons may safely lead to firm conclusions:
1) The 1961 results are based on only 75 undergraduates,
a 75% response rate from the sample;
2) The 1961 study was nationwide, sponsored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and covered many topics related to
social control processes, whereas our study is internally
sponsored and relatively narrow in scope; and
3) The representation of freshmen in the 1961 survey
was proportional to their population size, which is not true
of 1976 freshmen.
On the positive side, the questions we chose to repeat are
identical in wording and response categories to the 1961
versions; also, background items for which we have other
sources of trend data—e.g., sex, age, grade average, ethnic
background, and type of campus housing—show changes very
similar to those in the questionnaire responses.
We will discuss several interesting comparisons in this
section; attention will focus first, however, on four findings
of special interest to the SCLC.
First, contrary to prevailing opinion, our data show no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976.
Second, current students are more likely to have actually
seen instances of cheating, and to perceive-in a general
way—that more cheating exists, than was true of their
predecessors.
Third, there is a notable drop in expressed support for
value statements concerning honesty, especially those with a
universal tone—e.g., "Under no circumstances is cheating ever
justified."
Fourth, support for the reporting aspect of the Honor
Code has indeed declined; in 1961, about one-quarter of the
sample would, m a hypothetical cheating situation, report the

offender or ask that he report himself—compared to less than
10% who say they would do so in 1976.
Self-Reports of Academic Dishonesty
The fo;lowing self-reports were solicited in 1961 and
1976 with the results shown in the two columns to the right:
Check all the following which you have done at Stanford.

Another set of questions allowed five responses ranging
from "Never" to "Many times"; so few persons, in either
year, selected the fourth or fifth categories, that we show
below only the predominent response categories.

The lack of change shown above is worth notice; where
there are changes—in either direction—they are too small to
warrant serious attention. It is, we believe, a safe conclusion
that self-reported acts of cheating are unchanged between
1961 and 1976. (We should point out that in Bowers' 1961
data, the Stanford level of cheating was found to be very low
in a nation-wide context. Even on those questions which
show an increase between 1961 and 1976, the current
Stanford percent is below the nationwide 1961 sample
percent.)
PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIC
DISHONESTY
Here we see some substantial differences. In both years,
students were asked, "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], have you seen another student cheating during a
test or exam?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 76% 49% Once 12% 9% A few 7% 29%
times
'61 '76 '61 *76

A similar question: "Since you have been at Stanford [at

Never 88% 78% Once 8% 8% A few
times 3% 11%
Several Many
times 1% 2% times 0% 1%
It seems indisputable that current students are more likely
to have personally witnessed cheating activity. Regardless of
their own experience, they also hold different perceptions of
the extent of academic dishonesty and the functioning of
disciplinary processes. Students in both years were asked to
estimate, in percentage terms, the frequency of the following
events:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage has cheated since coming to Stanford."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-15%) 42% 35%
Medium estimate (16-60%) 37 51
High estimate (above 60%) 21 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate

1961 1976

1961 1976

Medium estimate (5-15%) 50 43
High estimate (above 15%) 23 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are

by the course instructor."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-70%) 32% 47%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 68 34
High estimate (above 97%) 0 19
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarized and are

High estimate (above 65%) 11 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are

selves. "
1961 1976
Low estimate (0%) 59% 69%
Medium estimate (1-10%) 28 26
High estimate (above 10%) 13 6
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty

age of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 90% 49%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 9 47
High estimate (above 85%) 1 4
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases disciplinary action is taken by the course
instructor.
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-35%) 48% 39%
Medium estimate (36-90%) 40 52
High estimate (above 90%) 12 9
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty

age of the cases the case is passed on to some other authority
for disciplinary action."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-5%) 19% 32%
Medium estimate (6-50%) 39 56
High estimate (above 50%) 42 11
Comparing percentage distributions of percentage esti
mates can be quite confusing. Some differences, however,
come through quite clearly: 1961 respondents estimated a
higher "discovery rate" for cheaters, expected more disco
veries to be made by faculty, and substantially more cheating
cases being passed to authorities beyond the classroom. In
neither year did many students perceive a high level of
self-reporting ("0%" the majority estimate—chosen by 59% in
1961 and 69% currently).
These indicated trends in the percentage estimates are
confirmed by another set of responses elsewhere in the
questionnaire:

Unfortunately, our 1961 data are in the form of com
puter print-out rather than IBM cards, so we are unable to
examine the relationships between these value endorsements
and other variables of obvious interest—like self-reports of
cheating. As we will discuss later in Section 4, 1976 respon
dents who agree strongly with some of these statements are
conspicuously different from their fellow-students in several
other ways as well.
RESPONSES TO HYPOTHETICAL CHEATING SITUA
TIONS
Earlier we examined responses about cheating actually
observed; here we inquire what our responses would do if
they observed cheating.
"Suppose you saw a student cheating on a test or exam.
What would you do?"
1961 1976
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 4% 5%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 22 3
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 36 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 14 33
Ignore the incident 2525
In both years, one-quarter of the students in this hypothe
tical situation would ignore the incident. Also in both years,
the modal choice is to express disapproval but not to report
the offender.
The big change is in the second most popular form of
social control-in 1961, it is to ask the person to report
himself and report him if he doesn't do so, and in 1976 it is
to mention the incident to others but not report it.

knowabout?"

As before, the areas of large change are in perceived
self-reporting and faculty alertness and activity, student
reporting of others is seen to be only slightly less frequent
now.
Student views of faculty are tapped in yet another way,
with consistent differences over time again evident.

Before considering behaviors and perceptions more di
rectly related to the Honor Code, we'll look briefly at some
value statements put to both undergraduate samples.
VALUES ABOUT HONESTY
Here we see some of the largest differences of any found
so far in our several analyses. There can be little doubt that
the changes in the "Agree Strongly" column below, especial
ly for the first two statements, constitute real differences
between our two samples.

It may seem surprising that only 26% of the 1961 sample
supported the reporting obligation of the Honor Code; but
other responses show that students also perceived some
student support for reporting in 1961—the combination of
general perception plus 26% commitment may well have
resulted in a social control system that effectively reduced
academic dishonesty.
Another hypothetical situation was posed:
1961 1976
Give him the answer 0% 2%
Say nothing but expose your paper
so he can copy the answer 4 2
Ignore or turn down his request 59 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 32 21
Report him to the appropriate
authorities 5 2
Two categories show 10-15% differences; ignoring or
rejecting such a request is a more popular option now, and
expressing disapproval informally is less popular. Neither
sample views reporting the request with much favor.
Both hypothetical situations were elaborated by changing
the identity of the cheater from an unspecified individual to
"a campus leader" and "a close friend"; the second situation
added a third, "some you disliked personally." In both years,
a friend observed cheating is less likely to be reported and
more likely to be informally disapproved of; campus leaders
>n both years are more severely treated than others—27% of
the 1961 sample, and 17% in 1976, would report him, and
only about 20% would ignore the incident.
For the solicited exam aid situation, our two samples are
similar with the following exceptions; whereas currently 21%
would cooperate with a friend's request, only 7% thought
they would do so in 1961; both samples are more likely to
express disapproval to a friend than to the other specified
offenders, 42% selecting this treatment of a friend in 1961,
and 30% in 1976. For neither sample is reporting a likely
option—even for campus leaders in 1961, the figure is only
7%.
This concludes our review of trend findings of key
interest to the SCLC. We have restricted our interpretive
comments to the analytic variety, indicating which differ
ences seemed, to us, worth serious attention.
Another level of interpretation, however, is needed with
respect to one blatant anomaly: How is it that individual
self-reported cheating is unchanged, but current students
report seeing more cheating than their predecessors? One
possible interpretation is simply that cheating is more conspi
cuous when it does occur; that the change in moral climate,
suggested by the value endorsement data, has both allowed
current cheaters to be more open in their activities and
opened more widely the eyes and ears of noncheaters. To the
extent that our 1976 data permit, we will examine these
possibilities in Section 4. Our aim here is to draw attention to
the phenomenon and encourage speculation.
1961 AND 1976 VIEWS ON THE PURPOSES OF A COL
LEGE EDUCATION
Several questions on the Bowers questionnaire, while not
related to the SCLC task, were so potentially interesting to
repeat 15 years later that we easily yielded to the temptation.
Students were asked to consider a list of purposes of a college
education, to indicate the importance of each purpose to the
respondent, and then to select that purpose considered most
important to the respondent.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Most
Important Purpose
1961 1976
gg Provide a basic general education and
appreciation of ideas
Provide vocational training; develop
skills and techniques directly
applicable to my career
Develop my ability to get along with
different kinds of people
Develop my knowledge and interest in the
® ® community and world problems
Help develop my moral capacities, ethical
® standards and values
Prepare me for a happy marriage
® and family life
Looking at these comparisons, it is hard to believe that 15
turbulent years have passed since the first survey. With two
exceptions, the differences are smaller than pollsters ex
pected to find over a one-week time span! Amidst such
constancy, the two shifts stand out sharply: Current students
attribute somewhat less importance to acquiring knowledge
about world problems (though the change is not large); and
our sample virtually rejects preparation for marriage as an
important purpose of college—in 1961, 53% assigned some
importance to this purpose, compared with 28% today.
With some trepidation, we also repeated the question,
"How well satisfied are you with your educational experience
at Stanford [at this school] ?"
1961 1976
Very well satisfied 38% 24%
Fairly well satisfied 55 63
Not very well satisfied 7 13
Not at all satisfied 0 0
The drop in the top category, while not huge, is big
enough to qualify as real. We did not inquire into reasons for
the respondents' level of satisfaction (nor did Bowers), and
thus cannot help those wishing to interpret or evaluate the
significance of this change.
Section 4: A Closer Look at Self-Reported Cheating
While we know more now about the state of academic
honesty at Stanford than we did prior to the survey, we still
should look closer at the correlates of self-reported cheating
activity.
Our data do not allow us to assign causality and statis
tically test alternative explanations of cheating behavior; we
can, however, change tactics from preceding sections and
focus on different levels of cheating—seeking related variables
that are potentially manipulable, be it by policy or informal
effort.
We make frequent use in this section of the three
"cheating indices" introd - "~ed in Section 1: Cheating Index,
"Serious" Cheating, and Exam Cheating. By cross-tabulating
each index with a wide range of variables, we looked for
differences between the three indices (e.g.. Are those who
admit to serious cheating different from those who admit to

what one SCLC member labeled "dilettante cheating"?), as
well as for differences between self-confessed cheaters of
whatever stripe and noncheaters.
First, we examine the hypothesis that noncheaters are
better informed about the contents of the Honor Code than
are those who cheat. We created a Knowledge Index based on
the quiz-type questions, high scores going to those with a
higher proportion of right answers. Cross-tabulating the
Knowledge Index with each cheating index produced no
difference worth reporting. It appears that our respondents
who cheat know neither more nor less about the Honor Code
than their contemporaries who don't cheat.
Perceived cheating is, not surprisingly, positively related
to self-reported cheating; the indices work similarly, but the
relationship shows most clearly in the example below:
"Since you have been at Stanford, have you seen another
student cheating during a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Never 61% 54% 29%
Once 9 8 9
A few times 23 27 39
Several times 5 7 11
Many times 2 3 12
Very Fairly Not very
Important Important Important

55 41 40 46 4 13
26 29 47 45 27 26
10 4 43 24 47 72
The biggest difference is between those who are high on
our index (N=s6), versus those who are medium or low. This
pattern reappears in response to the question, "What would
you do if you saw someone cheating on a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 9% 4% 4%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 5 4 0
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 42 37 23
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 28 29 39
Ignore the incident 16 25 34
Similarly, those who admit to having cheated are more
likely to have been asked for help during a test or exam; in
response to such a request, they are more likely to aid the
person or ignore the incident (versus reporting or expressing
disapproval).
Strong differences appear when the cheating index is
cross-tabulated with the three universalistic value statements
(again, all three cheating indices work similarly). The follow
ing table examplifies the differences found with respect to
the other value statements as well.
"Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified."
Cheating Index Score Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 74% 40% 26%
Agree mildly 23 14
Not sure 5 19 24
Disagree mildly 9 27
Disagree strongly 14 9

The differences seen above are substantially reduced when
respondents are asked to indicate their agreement with the
statement: "Honesty is desirable, but currently impossible at
Stanford."
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 10% 8% 11%
Agree mildly 12 16 24
Not sure 21 12 14
Disagree mildly 16 21 22
Disagree strongly 41 43 29
We also find no large differences with respect to level of
commitment to the current Honor Code, or to the serious
ness of the current level of academic dishonesty at Stanford.
There is a modest tendency for noncheaters to prefer proc
toring, but the differences are neither consistently related to
level of self-reported cheating nor larger than about 10%.
With respect to background variables, seniors tend to
appear in the medium and high categories on our scales (52%
of the "highs" are seniors). There is a discernable but
undramatic tendency for social science majors to be high,
engineering and science majors medium, and humanities low.
There is a similar consistent, modest tendency for students
with professional school plans to score higher on our indices
than those planning to attend graduate school.
A final small correlation that is packed with interpretative
potential: Noncheaters are more likely to be "very satisfied"
with their educational experiences at Stanford than respon
dents scoring medium or high (% "very satisfied," 33%, 24%,
and 18% respectively).
Since our largest unexpected differences, both here and in
the 1961 comparisons, have involved three value statements,
we decided to look more closely at our respondents' value
endorsements. We created an index called Strong Values, ana
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each respondent according
to how many times he indicated strong agreement with these
statements:
1) Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified.
2) Students are morally obligated not to cheat.
3) Cheating directly contradicts the goals of education.
Our population split very neatly into the four categories,
about 25% in each.
Our subsequent cross-tabulations yielded interesting re
sults, which we will first summarize, and then examine some
details. Respondents with high scores on our Strong Values
index are much less aware of, involved in, and opinionated
about all matters related to cheating at Stanford. Their
responses to hypothetical cheating situations are very likely
to include expressing disapproval, even to friends (similar to
the 1961 response for the whole sample).
They learn about cheating primarily from official
channels, and about the Honor Code from signing blue
books. They are more likely to indicate strong belief in the
Honor Code, and to believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty constitutes a moderate or serious problem They
do not, however, hold consistently different perceptions of
fellow students or faculty with respect to Honor Code
support, nor are their opinions about specific aspects of the
Honor Code different from their fellow respondents. They
are not conspicuously either for or against proctoring; on
these and other questions soliciting opinions about hypothe
tical effects or the attitudes of others, they are more likely to
check "not sure."
They are, in sum, an interesting, not easily comprehen
sible, group of people—slightly more likely to be female and
majoring in the humanities, unlikely to be seniors, and more
likely to be very satisfied with their educational experience at
Stanford.
The tables that follow show the most impressive of the
differences discussed above. Other tables referred to but not
presented below are in the appendices.

Another section of the questionnaire elicited many speci
fic course characteristics of courses taken winter quarter by
our respondents. Among other things, they were asked about
the extent and types of cheating that occurred in the two
winter courses they liked best, and the one liked least.
Each single cheating item received too few mentions to be
useful to us, so we grouped together all mentions of any type
or level of cheating for the course liked best and created an
index, and similarly for the course liked least. Only 17
nonzero scores are on the first index (mentions of cheating
instances), and 36 on the course-liked-least index. The index
items are:
Respondent personally knew about or learned about. . . .
* Any other students cheating on the final exam, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on tests other than the
final, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on homework or lab
assignments, and/or;
* At least half the other students cheating at one or
another time during the course.
We were interested in learning what types of courses were
likely settings for cheating; by cross-tabulating the other
course characteristics against the index scores, we identified
several characteristics differentiating courses with observed
cheating from other courses.
Those courses liked best in which cheating occurred were
likely to be introductory, have more than 30 students
enrolled, and have short-answer exams (versus open-book,
essay, or take-homes). Past tests were likely to be available
for study purposes, seating was staggered during exams, and
either a TA or the instructor was likely to remain in the room
during exams.
Those observing cheating are likely to be high on our
cheating indices, which supports our earlier conclusion that
those who observe cheating are themselves more likely to
cheat. The course-least-liked index tables show similar results.
On the whole, we suspect that the attempt in this section
to understand better students who cheat and settings con
ducive to cheating events has produced results more useful to
the student of social deviance than to the concerned policy
evaluator.
The characteristics most obviously related to self-reported
cheating are value stances of a special, universalistic sort—a

trait probably not nurtured during the undergraduate years,
or seniors would not be conspicuously absent from the group
of high scorers on our values index.
With respect to the finding that those who cheat are much
more likely to observe other cheating, our data don't allow us
to establish the order of the relationship—i.e., does own
cheating heighten awareness and thus perceptions of others'
cheating, or does one begin cheating in response to observing
it? Probably both processes occur, but we cannot disentangle
them.
One main policy modification, the introduction of op
tional or mandatory proctoring of exams, is not strongly or
consistently favored by our population of noncheaters, nor
by the overlapping subgroup of those high on our values
index. Proctoring already exists in some classes, and our
respondents are more likely to report instances of cheating in
courses with proctored exams.
That does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that
proctoring is ineffective; that students do see cheating in
proctored exam courses may, however, help to explain the
lack of widespread support for proctoring as a solution to the
ills of academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
We have examined, described, and assessed a large amount
of data on Stanford students—their personal honesty, their
valuation of honesty, their experiences with and perceptions
of academic dishonesty among their fellow students, their
concern about cheating, their attitudes toward and know
ledge of the Honor Code, and their opinions about possible
modifications of the current system. What, after all this, can
we safely assert that we know?
First, and perhaps most important, is the conclusion that
Stanford does not currently have a "cheating problem";
those who have worried about a West Point level scandal may
sleep soundly, at least for a while. While cheating continues
to exist in academic endeavors, our data show that the
incidence of self-reported cheating among undergraduates is
approximately the same now as it was in 1961.
The increased selectivity exercised in undergraduate ad
missions may account in part for this lack of change;
although the pressures on students have certainly increased,
the student body includes fewer undergraduates who cannot
cope with the academic demands made of them
The picture is not entirely rosy, however. Indeed, it is
only a slight exaggeration to state that the low incidence of
cheating is independent of the current control system rather
than a result of it. Students are not knowledgeable about the
contents of the Honor Code, nor is the majority highly
committed to it. They similarly perceive their fellow students
and faculty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not
actually indifferent or opposed to it. The crux of the matter
is that the system is not seen to be working.
Students are both more aware of the cheating that does
exist, and less willing to report offenders (or ask them to
report themselves). Nor do they see faculty members filling
the activity gap as either police or advocates. (As our report
on the faculty surveys will state, this perception of the
faculty is essentially correct.)
There is no evidence that personal moral standards have
declined at Stanford, though the willingness to hold others to
universalistic standards seems to have declined substantially.
The 25% of our sample who do endorse the several
universalistic value statements in the questionnaire, and who
are substantially more willing to observe the reporting obliga
tion—these students are not, apparently, very visible or very
vocal among their fellow students. They do not have as much
experience with instances of cheating as the rest of the
sample; and, or course, it may be lack of experience which
permits them to predict that their hypothetical behavior
would differ from that of the majority.
We find no strong support for exam proctoring, even
among those subgroups most aware of and concerned about
levels of cheating.
The minority most exposed to cheating seem to favor
unilateral solutions, while the rest are more likely to reject
proctoring or prefer it as a faculty and/or student option. In
short, both the need to modify the current Honor Code, and
the appropriateness of alternative modifications continue to
be judgmental matters: our data provide no clear answers.
Our own interpretation—and it is merely that—is that
Stanford's Honor Code suffers primarily from invisibility
ignorance and apathy better describe our sample than dis
honesty and anxiety. While some modifications may be in
order (e.g., eliminating the reporting obligation, and per
mitting proctoring at studen' and/or instructor preference), it
is premature to consider abandoning the current system.
An educational program is needed, not simply on the
contents of the Code but also on topics like "What plagiarism
is and how to avoid it." (English and communication have
such a statement and some faculty members, at least, distri
bute copies to their students.)
People who throw out the baby with the bath water are
usually unaware that the baby is there; and until the
presence, characteristics, and value of the Honor Code are
widely known on campus, hasty action—like pulling the
plug—would be both unnecessary and undesirable.
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %
Do you consider yourself to be:
Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 52 46
Not well informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 35 44
The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66
Support it by their behavior? 75 68
Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:
% replying "Yes" to Undergrad Grad
1. "Padding" a few items on a biblio- 23 8

5. Getting questions or answers from
someone who has already taken the same

6. Giving answers to other students

7. Arranging with other students to give

Because the actions range from trivial to serious, and
these distributions count acts, not individuals, we construc
ted three indices of so-called cheating behavior. The first
index counts the number of respondents who checked at
least one item of the 1 7-item set shown above. The second
index is also a count, but excludes items 1-3 above. The third
index counts examination cheating only (items 5-10, 14-15).

Our respondent's perceptions of the amount of cheatiny
among their fellow students are most usefully viewed in the
context of their self-reports of cheating, a topic addressed in
Section 4, and in comparison with the 1961 data, discussed
in Section 3. Suffice it to say here that undergraduates
perceive substantially more cheating than do graduate stu
dents:

Respondents were asked to estimate, in percentage terms,
levels and types of cheating, levels of discovered cheating,
types of discipline imposed, etc. It is surprising, given their
differences in personal observation of cheating, that the
percentage estimates provided by graduates and undergradu
ates are quite similar. Some examples follow:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage have cheated since coming to Stanford."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-15%) 35% 53%
Medium estimate (16-50%) 51 38
High estimate (above 15
High estimate (above 50%) 14 10
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheat frequently."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 44% 43%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 44 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 13

"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage are discovered. "
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate <0-4% 43% 41%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 43 41
High estimate (above 15%) 14 18
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage are discovered
by the instructor."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-70%) 47% 42%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 34 34
High estimate (above 97%) 19 24
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for
cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 49% 41%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 47 41
High estimate (above 85%) 4 18
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for
cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases action is taken by the instructor."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-35%) 39% 54%
Medium estimate (36-90%) 52 42
High estimate (above 90%) 9 4
Our respondents were asked how they learned about most
of the cases of cheating and plagiarim that they know about.
The student grapevine predominates among undergraduates,
but not for graduates:
Undergrads Grads
Observing the instances yourself 19% 23%
Hearing about them from the offenders 8 4
Hearing about them from other students
on the grapevine 55 33
Hearing about them through official channels
(e.g.. The Daily, Dean's Office,
a faculty member, etc.) 18 40
We turn now to two questions which will be reexamined
from other angles in subsequent sections of this report.
Though not directly addressing Honor Code issues, they
indicate the amount of support for the "reporting obliga
tion"—that observers of cheating report the offenders. The
low support expressed is all the more striking because the
questions pose hypothetical situations:
Suppose you saw a student cheating. What would you do?
Undergrads Grads
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 5% (1) 10%
Ask him to report himself and report him
if he fails to do so 3 ( (3) 10
Express disapproval informally but not
report him 34 (68) 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 33 (5) 17
Ignore the incident 25 (23) 29
Graduates and undergraduates agree about how their
behavior would change were the offender "a close friend":
the undergraduate percentages are shown in parentheses
above. If the offender were "a campus leader," however,
reporting becomes somewhat more likely, increasing to 17%
for undergraduates and 28% for graduates.
The second hypothetical question shows only small differ
ences between graduates and undergraduates; the percentages
below are for the undergraduate respondents.
If someone asked you for help during a test or exam,
what would you do?
Undergrad %
Give him the answer 2
Say nothing but expose your paper so
he can copy the answer 2
Ignore or turn down his request 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 21
Report him to the appropriate authorities 2
If the person seeking help were a friend, the percentage
selecting the first or second option increases to 21%; re
actions to "a campus leader" or "someone you disliked
personally" are not substantially different from those shown
above for an unspecified person.
One question attempts to assess in a global sort of way
"the cheating problem":
"Do you believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty at Stanford poses a serious threat to the academic
process?"
Undergrad %
Yes, very serious 11
Moderately serious 32
Not very serious 55

Between one-fifth ana about half of the undergraduate
population support the introduction of examination proctor
ing, or allowing for proctoring as an option:

Graduate student responses differ in that many more
appear in the No Opinion column; when preferences are
expressed, they are in the same direction as those shown
above for undergraduates.
Asked who should serve as exam proctors, class instruc
tors and graduate TAs—in that order—are overwhelmingly
preferred over students from outside the class. Similarly, the
majority of respondents think that students should not
participate in "identifying and selecting from a pool of
potential proctors":
Undergrad %
No 51

would you do it?"

obligation Undergrad 28% 31% 41%

Finally, students were asked what probable effects would
result from instituting exam proctoring. Below we show the
undergraduate responses; where graduate responses are sub
stantially different, they appear in parentheses.
The incidence of cheating on examinations
would be reduced. 71%
Students would no longer feel obliged to report
the dishonesty of others on examinations 67 (50)
An Honor Code would lose meaning 58 (43)
A meaningful Honor Code would cease to exist 47 (26)
Students would feel threatened by the lack
of trust 44 ( 32)
Students would feel protected from a
minority of dishonest students 43
The incident of cheating in other areas would
increase (e.g., take-home exams, lab reports). 16
Students would no longer feel obliged to behave
honestly on examinations 12
We now turn, in the following sections, to more detailed
considerations of the results of our study, broadly and
briskly described above.
Section 2: The Role of Background Characteristics
It is a truism of social research that one can always find
background characteristics of respondents which correlate—at
impressive statistical levels—with the dependent variables
under scrutiny. This study is no exception.
Separately for graduates and undergraduates, we cross
tabulated a range of background characteristics with a long
but selective list of variables concerning values, perceptions,
and behaviors. We found many, many differences; undergrad
uate class, academic department, and—to a lesser extent
graduate school intentions, sex, and citizenship, all show
correlations with many of our value and behavior indicators.
In the interests of brevity, clarity, and progress, we have
selected from this mass of data in two ways: first, only those
findings of central policy interest to the SCLC are being
reported here; and second, only those patterns of relation
ships which are internally consistent will receive attention.
An example which meets the first criterion but fails the
second: Freshmen and sophomores are more likely to know
that the Honor Code prohibits proctoring, but less likely to
agree that the Honor Code "regulates faculty behavior." Both
relationships are statistically significant; viewed together,
however, they don't make sense and are better politely
dismissed than puzzled over (e.g., "It appears that undergrad
uate class is not systematically related to knowledge of
Honor Code contents.")
Tables showing the relationships described in this section
r,ro available in the appendices. Throughout what follows,
"sophomores" should be understood to include our four
token freshmen.
Undergraduate class relates in a variety of ways to several
key variables, especially perceptions of cheating. Honor Code
commitment, and attitudes toward proctoring. Sophomores
have seen less cheating and fewer instances of students
reporting others for cheating; they are, however, slightly
more likely to have seen instructors ignoring cheating behav
ior. Although their self-reported cheating varies only slightly
from that of upperclassmen, sophomores are more likely to
worry about false accusations of cheating.
Sophomores are especially likely to state that the Honor
Code system should be altered, and least likely to describe
themselves as believing strongly in the current system. They
favor the introduction of exam proctoring more than upper
classmen do, especially in classes with enrollments over 30,
and/or in required preprofessional classes.
Sophomores' attitudes and experiences extend to their
perceptions of other students and faculty: they are least
likely to think other students favor continuation of the
current Honor Code; while more likely to believe that faculty
know about the Honor Code and its requirements, they are
least likely to think faculty favor its continuation or support
it by their behavior.
Differences by undergraduate major are, by and large,
inconsistent and statistically small—few exceed 10%. There is
some tendency for respondents in social science departments
to see a world that is consistently slightly different from that
seen by others; the humanities, science, and engineering
students do not generally differ greatly from each other in
patterned or consistent ways.
Social science majors are distinctive in the following
respects: they report having seen more cheating, more often
been asked for help on exams, more often observed an
instructor ignoring cheating, knowing of more instances of
students reporting offenders, and more likely to think that
the current level of academic dishonesty poses a serious
threat to the educational process.
Their self-reports of cheating are high on three of the six
items where area of major shows a difference; unlike the
other disciplinary areas, they are low on no item. They do
not, however, conspicuously favor exam proctoring; indeed,
they are least willing to proctor "as a University obligation,"
though the percent willing doubles "if paid" (the other
disciplinary areas show a decrease in willingness if proctoring
were a paid job). While not especially in favor of any of the
proctoring options, social science majors are least likely to
believe that an effect of proctoring would be that "the Honor
Code would lose meaning."
Many of the areas in which social science majors differ
from our other undergraduate respondents also differentiate
between undergraduates with professional school versus grad
uate school intentions.
On all variables relating to knowledge of cheating, general
perceptions of the extent of cheating, and self-reported
cheating, either no differences appear or the profession
oriented students are higher—i.e., more aware of cheating and
higher rates of self-reported cheating.
On the Honor Code quiz, profession-oriented students are
less likely to know that exam proctoring is prohibited; later
questions show them to be more in favor of mandatory
proctoring, slightly more willing to proctor as an obligation,
and much more willing to proctor if paid to do so.
The two groups also differ in the results they would
expect from proctoring: graduate school-oriented students
believe that students would feel threatened, while the profes
sion-oriented think that "feeling protected" is a more likely
outcome.
Sex and ethnic background are generally unrewarding
variables in this study. Two self-reported cheating items, both
referring to copying from another's paper during an exam,
show women less likely—by 10% or more—to cheat in this
fashion.
Women are more likely to consider themselves "not well
informed" about the Honor Code, though their quiz scores
are no worse than the men's. Mandatory proctoring receives
more support from women; other proctoring options, how
ever, are not conspicuously supported by one sex or the
other. Favorable effects of proctoring—e.g., that students
would feel protected—are cited more frequently by women;
men are more likely to respond that an Honor Code would
lose meaning and/or that a meaningful Honor Code would
cease to exist.
The ethnic background tables include both graduates and
undergraduates in order to obtain a statistically comfortable
number of "non-Caucasian" respondents (black, chicano,
Spanish surname, native American, Asian American, or

"other"). The ethnic conglomerate may be meaningless; but,
in any case, being "non-Caucasian" does not relate consis
tently or significantly to any of the behavioral or attitudinal
variables in our study.
Background Variables and the Graduate Sample
The obvious and occasionally interesting differences dis
cussed with respect to our undergraduate respondents are
not, in general, evident among the graduate respondents in
our sample. There are not as many cases, and two areas
(Earth Sciences and H & S Humanities) include too few cases
to allow attention to comparative percentages.
The reader may remember from Section 1 that experience
with and awareness of academic dishonesty is signfficantly
lower among Stanford's graduate student population. One
result of this difference is that is is less rewarding—indeed
discouragint—to examine departmental or other background
variables with respect to the respondent's own cheating or
awareness of it: there are simply too few cases to yield
dependable percentages. Thus we have a reduced set of
variables to examine; however—to the extent that any disci
plinary area stands out as consistently different from the
other two—it is, at the graduate level, that of H & S science
and math students.
Not many variables, even with the reduced set, show
disciplinary differences. Those that do tend to be those
discussed both earlier and later in this report—those items
with respect to which, for a variety of reasons, our sample
respondents seem to differ. On these variables, shown in
tabular form in the appendices, graduate students in H & S
science and math departments come through as personally
moral pessimists.
The differences are neither wholly consistent nor statis
tically awesome, but it appears that the science/math sub
group is more likely to endorse the broadly-stated values of
honesty, to not worry much personally about cheating, and
to cheat less; to perceive less Honor Code support and
knowledge among fellow-students and faculty; and to not
favor the proctoring remedy, anticipating several ill effects.
With flags of caution waving wildly, we close this section
with a few comments about the graduate student population
who are not U.S. citizens. It is a small group (only 18
respondents), and hence the need for caution. The differ
ences in responses between citizens and noncitizens, however,
are surprisingly consistent over a range of variables—unlike
our results with the "non-Caucasian" background variable.
To summarize the tables which appear in the appendices,
value statements which citizens tend to endorse (e.g. "Most
students want to be honest."), noncitizens indicate "Not
Sure"; others which citizens tend to disagree with (e.g.,
"Reporting someone for cheating is worse than cheating"),
noncitizens tend to endorse. They express less commitment
to the Honor Code and perceive less support among other
students. They are less supportive of (or less opinionated
about) various proctoring options, less willing to serve as
proctors, and likely to expect more negative results to follow
the introduction of proctoring. These several areas of differ
ence are not always statistically large, but the fact that
differences consistently appear is deserving of some atten
tion.
Section 3: Some Comparisons Between 1961 and 1976
Before discussing the results of our comparisons over
time, it is appropriate to restate some of the differences
between the studies which restrict the ease with which our
comparisons may safely lead to firm conclusions:
1) The 1961 results are based on only 75 undergraduates,
a 75% response rate from the sample;
2) The 1961 study was nationwide, sponsored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and covered many topics related to
social control processes, whereas our study is internally
sponsored and relatively narrow in scope; and
3) The representation of freshmen in the 1961 survey
was proportional to their population size, which is not true
of 1976 freshmen.
On the positive side, the questions we chose to repeat are
identical in wording and response categories to the 1961
versions; also, background items for which we have other
sources of trend data—e.g., sex, age, grade average, ethnic
background, and type of campus housing—show changes very
similar to those in the questionnaire responses.
We will discuss several interesting comparisons in this
section; attention will focus first, however, on four findings
of special interest to the SCLC.
First, contrary to prevailing opinion, our data show no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976.
Second, current students are more likely to have actually
seen instances of cheating, and to perceive-in a general
way—that more cheating exists, than was true of their
predecessors.
Third, there is a notable drop in expressed support for
value statements concerning honesty, especially those with a
universal tone—e.g., "Under no circumstances is cheating ever
justified."
Fourth, support for the reporting aspect of the Honor
Code has indeed declined; in 1961, about one-quarter of the
sample would, m a hypothetical cheating situation, report the

offender or ask that he report himself—compared to less than
10% who say they would do so in 1976.
Self-Reports of Academic Dishonesty
The fo;lowing self-reports were solicited in 1961 and
1976 with the results shown in the two columns to the right:
Check all the following which you have done at Stanford.

Another set of questions allowed five responses ranging
from "Never" to "Many times"; so few persons, in either
year, selected the fourth or fifth categories, that we show
below only the predominent response categories.

The lack of change shown above is worth notice; where
there are changes—in either direction—they are too small to
warrant serious attention. It is, we believe, a safe conclusion
that self-reported acts of cheating are unchanged between
1961 and 1976. (We should point out that in Bowers' 1961
data, the Stanford level of cheating was found to be very low
in a nation-wide context. Even on those questions which
show an increase between 1961 and 1976, the current
Stanford percent is below the nationwide 1961 sample
percent.)
PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIC
DISHONESTY
Here we see some substantial differences. In both years,
students were asked, "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], have you seen another student cheating during a
test or exam?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 76% 49% Once 12% 9% A few 7% 29%
times
'61 '76 '61 *76
Several
times 3% 7% Many 1% 5%
times
A similar question: "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], has another student indicated to you during a
test or exam that he wanted help?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 88% 78% Once 8% 8% A few
times 3% 11%
Several Many
times 1% 2% times 0% 1%
It seems indisputable that current students are more likely
to have personally witnessed cheating activity. Regardless of
their own experience, they also hold different perceptions of
the extent of academic dishonesty and the functioning of
disciplinary processes. Students in both years were asked to
estimate, in percentage terms, the frequency of the following
events:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what

Comparing percentage distributions of percentage esti
mates can be quite confusing. Some differences, however,
come through quite clearly: 1961 respondents estimated a
higher "discovery rate" for cheaters, expected more disco
veries to be made by faculty, and substantially more cheating
cases being passed to authorities beyond the classroom. In
neither year did many students perceive a high level of
self-reporting ("0%" the majority estimate—chosen by 59% in
1961 and 69% currently).
These indicated trends in the percentage estimates are
confirmed by another set of responses elsewhere in the
questionnaire:

Unfortunately, our 1961 data are in the form of com
puter print-out rather than IBM cards, so we are unable to
examine the relationships between these value endorsements
and other variables of obvious interest—like self-reports of
cheating. As we will discuss later in Section 4, 1976 respon
dents who agree strongly with some of these statements are
conspicuously different from their fellow-students in several
other ways as well.
RESPONSES TO HYPOTHETICAL CHEATING SITUA
TIONS
Earlier we examined responses about cheating actually
observed; here we inquire what our responses would do if
they observed cheating.
"Suppose you saw a student cheating on a test or exam.
What would you do?"
1961 1976
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 4% 5%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 22 3
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 36 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 14 33
Ignore the incident 2525
In both years, one-quarter of the students in this hypothe
tical situation would ignore the incident. Also in both years,
the modal choice is to express disapproval but not to report
the offender.
The big change is in the second most popular form of
social control-in 1961, it is to ask the person to report
himself and report him if he doesn't do so, and in 1976 it is
to mention the incident to others but not report it.

knowabout?"

now.
Student views of faculty are tapped in yet another way,
with consistent differences over time again evident.

Before considering behaviors and perceptions more di
rectly related to the Honor Code, we'll look briefly at some
value statements put to both undergraduate samples.
VALUES ABOUT HONESTY
Here we see some of the largest differences of any found
so far in our several analyses. There can be little doubt that
the changes in the "Agree Strongly" column below, especial
ly for the first two statements, constitute real differences
between our two samples.

It may seem surprising that only 26% of the 1961 sample
supported the reporting obligation of the Honor Code; but
other responses show that students also perceived some
student support for reporting in 1961—the combination of
general perception plus 26% commitment may well have
resulted in a social control system that effectively reduced
academic dishonesty.
Another hypothetical situation was posed:
1961 1976
Give him the answer 0% 2%
Say nothing but expose your paper
so he can copy the answer 4 2
Ignore or turn down his request 59 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 32 21
Report him to the appropriate
authorities 5 2
Two categories show 10-15% differences; ignoring or
rejecting such a request is a more popular option now, and
expressing disapproval informally is less popular. Neither
sample views reporting the request with much favor.
Both hypothetical situations were elaborated by changing
the identity of the cheater from an unspecified individual to
"a campus leader" and "a close friend"; the second situation
added a third, "some you disliked personally." In both years,
a friend observed cheating is less likely to be reported and
more likely to be informally disapproved of; campus leaders
>n both years are more severely treated than others—27% of
the 1961 sample, and 17% in 1976, would report him, and
only about 20% would ignore the incident.
For the solicited exam aid situation, our two samples are
similar with the following exceptions; whereas currently 21%
would cooperate with a friend's request, only 7% thought
they would do so in 1961; both samples are more likely to
express disapproval to a friend than to the other specified
offenders, 42% selecting this treatment of a friend in 1961,
and 30% in 1976. For neither sample is reporting a likely
option—even for campus leaders in 1961, the figure is only
7%.
This concludes our review of trend findings of key
interest to the SCLC. We have restricted our interpretive
comments to the analytic variety, indicating which differ
ences seemed, to us, worth serious attention.
Another level of interpretation, however, is needed with
respect to one blatant anomaly: How is it that individual
self-reported cheating is unchanged, but current students
report seeing more cheating than their predecessors? One
possible interpretation is simply that cheating is more conspi
cuous when it does occur; that the change in moral climate,
suggested by the value endorsement data, has both allowed
current cheaters to be more open in their activities and
opened more widely the eyes and ears of noncheaters. To the
extent that our 1976 data permit, we will examine these
possibilities in Section 4. Our aim here is to draw attention to
the phenomenon and encourage speculation.
1961 AND 1976 VIEWS ON THE PURPOSES OF A COL
LEGE EDUCATION
Several questions on the Bowers questionnaire, while not
related to the SCLC task, were so potentially interesting to
repeat 15 years later that we easily yielded to the temptation.
Students were asked to consider a list of purposes of a college
education, to indicate the importance of each purpose to the
respondent, and then to select that purpose considered most
important to the respondent.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Most
Important Purpose
1961 1976
gg Provide a basic general education and
appreciation of ideas
Provide vocational training; develop
skills and techniques directly
applicable to my career
Develop my ability to get along with
different kinds of people
Develop my knowledge and interest in the
® ® community and world problems
Help develop my moral capacities, ethical
® standards and values
Prepare me for a happy marriage
® and family life
Looking at these comparisons, it is hard to believe that 15
turbulent years have passed since the first survey. With two
exceptions, the differences are smaller than pollsters ex
pected to find over a one-week time span! Amidst such
constancy, the two shifts stand out sharply: Current students
attribute somewhat less importance to acquiring knowledge
about world problems (though the change is not large); and
our sample virtually rejects preparation for marriage as an
important purpose of college—in 1961, 53% assigned some
importance to this purpose, compared with 28% today.
With some trepidation, we also repeated the question,
"How well satisfied are you with your educational experience
at Stanford [at this school] ?"
1961 1976
Very well satisfied 38% 24%
Fairly well satisfied 55 63
Not very well satisfied 7 13
Not at all satisfied 0 0
The drop in the top category, while not huge, is big
enough to qualify as real. We did not inquire into reasons for
the respondents' level of satisfaction (nor did Bowers), and
thus cannot help those wishing to interpret or evaluate the
significance of this change.
Section 4: A Closer Look at Self-Reported Cheating
While we know more now about the state of academic
honesty at Stanford than we did prior to the survey, we still
should look closer at the correlates of self-reported cheating
activity.
Our data do not allow us to assign causality and statis
tically test alternative explanations of cheating behavior; we
can, however, change tactics from preceding sections and
focus on different levels of cheating—seeking related variables
that are potentially manipulable, be it by policy or informal
effort.
We make frequent use in this section of the three
"cheating indices" introd - "~ed in Section 1: Cheating Index,
"Serious" Cheating, and Exam Cheating. By cross-tabulating
each index with a wide range of variables, we looked for
differences between the three indices (e.g.. Are those who
admit to serious cheating different from those who admit to

what one SCLC member labeled "dilettante cheating"?), as
well as for differences between self-confessed cheaters of
whatever stripe and noncheaters.
First, we examine the hypothesis that noncheaters are
better informed about the contents of the Honor Code than
are those who cheat. We created a Knowledge Index based on
the quiz-type questions, high scores going to those with a
higher proportion of right answers. Cross-tabulating the
Knowledge Index with each cheating index produced no
difference worth reporting. It appears that our respondents
who cheat know neither more nor less about the Honor Code
than their contemporaries who don't cheat.
Perceived cheating is, not surprisingly, positively related
to self-reported cheating; the indices work similarly, but the
relationship shows most clearly in the example below:
"Since you have been at Stanford, have you seen another
student cheating during a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score

Never 61% 54% 29%
Once 9 8 9
A few times 23 27 39
Several times 5 7 11

55 41 40 46 4 13
26 29 47 45 27 26
10 4 43 24 47 72
The biggest difference is between those who are high on
our index (N=s6), versus those who are medium or low. This
pattern reappears in response to the question, "What would
you do if you saw someone cheating on a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 9% 4% 4%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 5 4 0
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 42 37 23
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 28 29 39
Ignore the incident 16 25 34
Similarly, those who admit to having cheated are more
likely to have been asked for help during a test or exam; in
response to such a request, they are more likely to aid the
person or ignore the incident (versus reporting or expressing
disapproval).
Strong differences appear when the cheating index is
cross-tabulated with the three universalistic value statements
(again, all three cheating indices work similarly). The follow
ing table examplifies the differences found with respect to
the other value statements as well.
"Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified."

Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 74% 40% 26%
Agree mildly 23 14
Not sure 5 19 24
Disagree mildly 9 27
Disagree strongly 14 9

The differences seen above are substantially reduced when
respondents are asked to indicate their agreement with the
statement: "Honesty is desirable, but currently impossible at
Stanford."
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 10% 8% 11%
Agree mildly 12 16 24
Not sure 21 12 14
Disagree mildly 16 21 22
Disagree strongly 41 43 29
We also find no large differences with respect to level of
commitment to the current Honor Code, or to the serious
ness of the current level of academic dishonesty at Stanford.
There is a modest tendency for noncheaters to prefer proc
toring, but the differences are neither consistently related to
level of self-reported cheating nor larger than about 10%.
With respect to background variables, seniors tend to
appear in the medium and high categories on our scales (52%
of the "highs" are seniors). There is a discernable but
undramatic tendency for social science majors to be high,
engineering and science majors medium, and humanities low.
There is a similar consistent, modest tendency for students
with professional school plans to score higher on our indices
than those planning to attend graduate school.
A final small correlation that is packed with interpretative
potential: Noncheaters are more likely to be "very satisfied"
with their educational experiences at Stanford than respon
dents scoring medium or high (% "very satisfied," 33%, 24%,
and 18% respectively).
Since our largest unexpected differences, both here and in
the 1961 comparisons, have involved three value statements,
we decided to look more closely at our respondents' value
endorsements. We created an index called Strong Values, ana
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each respondent according
to how many times he indicated strong agreement with these
statements:
1) Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified.
2) Students are morally obligated not to cheat.
3) Cheating directly contradicts the goals of education.
Our population split very neatly into the four categories,
about 25% in each.
Our subsequent cross-tabulations yielded interesting re
sults, which we will first summarize, and then examine some
details. Respondents with high scores on our Strong Values
index are much less aware of, involved in, and opinionated
about all matters related to cheating at Stanford. Their
responses to hypothetical cheating situations are very likely
to include expressing disapproval, even to friends (similar to
the 1961 response for the whole sample).
They learn about cheating primarily from official
channels, and about the Honor Code from signing blue
books. They are more likely to indicate strong belief in the
Honor Code, and to believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty constitutes a moderate or serious problem They
do not, however, hold consistently different perceptions of
fellow students or faculty with respect to Honor Code
support, nor are their opinions about specific aspects of the
Honor Code different from their fellow respondents. They
are not conspicuously either for or against proctoring; on
these and other questions soliciting opinions about hypothe
tical effects or the attitudes of others, they are more likely to
check "not sure."
They are, in sum, an interesting, not easily comprehen
sible, group of people—slightly more likely to be female and
majoring in the humanities, unlikely to be seniors, and more
likely to be very satisfied with their educational experience at
Stanford.
The tables that follow show the most impressive of the
differences discussed above. Other tables referred to but not
presented below are in the appendices.

Another section of the questionnaire elicited many speci
fic course characteristics of courses taken winter quarter by
our respondents. Among other things, they were asked about
the extent and types of cheating that occurred in the two
winter courses they liked best, and the one liked least.
Each single cheating item received too few mentions to be
useful to us, so we grouped together all mentions of any type
or level of cheating for the course liked best and created an
index, and similarly for the course liked least. Only 17
nonzero scores are on the first index (mentions of cheating
instances), and 36 on the course-liked-least index. The index
items are:
Respondent personally knew about or learned about. . . .
* Any other students cheating on the final exam, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on tests other than the
final, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on homework or lab
assignments, and/or;
* At least half the other students cheating at one or
another time during the course.
We were interested in learning what types of courses were
likely settings for cheating; by cross-tabulating the other
course characteristics against the index scores, we identified
several characteristics differentiating courses with observed
cheating from other courses.
Those courses liked best in which cheating occurred were
likely to be introductory, have more than 30 students
enrolled, and have short-answer exams (versus open-book,
essay, or take-homes). Past tests were likely to be available
for study purposes, seating was staggered during exams, and
either a TA or the instructor was likely to remain in the room
during exams.
Those observing cheating are likely to be high on our
cheating indices, which supports our earlier conclusion that
those who observe cheating are themselves more likely to
cheat. The course-least-liked index tables show similar results.
On the whole, we suspect that the attempt in this section
to understand better students who cheat and settings con
ducive to cheating events has produced results more useful to
the student of social deviance than to the concerned policy
evaluator.
The characteristics most obviously related to self-reported
cheating are value stances of a special, universalistic sort—a

trait probably not nurtured during the undergraduate years,
or seniors would not be conspicuously absent from the group
of high scorers on our values index.
With respect to the finding that those who cheat are much
more likely to observe other cheating, our data don't allow us
to establish the order of the relationship—i.e., does own
cheating heighten awareness and thus perceptions of others'
cheating, or does one begin cheating in response to observing
it? Probably both processes occur, but we cannot disentangle
them.
One main policy modification, the introduction of op
tional or mandatory proctoring of exams, is not strongly or
consistently favored by our population of noncheaters, nor
by the overlapping subgroup of those high on our values
index. Proctoring already exists in some classes, and our
respondents are more likely to report instances of cheating in
courses with proctored exams.
That does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that
proctoring is ineffective; that students do see cheating in
proctored exam courses may, however, help to explain the
lack of widespread support for proctoring as a solution to the
ills of academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
We have examined, described, and assessed a large amount
of data on Stanford students—their personal honesty, their
valuation of honesty, their experiences with and perceptions
of academic dishonesty among their fellow students, their
concern about cheating, their attitudes toward and know
ledge of the Honor Code, and their opinions about possible
modifications of the current system. What, after all this, can
we safely assert that we know?
First, and perhaps most important, is the conclusion that
Stanford does not currently have a "cheating problem";
those who have worried about a West Point level scandal may
sleep soundly, at least for a while. While cheating continues
to exist in academic endeavors, our data show that the
incidence of self-reported cheating among undergraduates is
approximately the same now as it was in 1961.
The increased selectivity exercised in undergraduate ad
missions may account in part for this lack of change;
although the pressures on students have certainly increased,
the student body includes fewer undergraduates who cannot
cope with the academic demands made of them
The picture is not entirely rosy, however. Indeed, it is
only a slight exaggeration to state that the low incidence of
cheating is independent of the current control system rather
than a result of it. Students are not knowledgeable about the
contents of the Honor Code, nor is the majority highly
committed to it. They similarly perceive their fellow students
and faculty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not
actually indifferent or opposed to it. The crux of the matter
is that the system is not seen to be working.
Students are both more aware of the cheating that does
exist, and less willing to report offenders (or ask them to
report themselves). Nor do they see faculty members filling
the activity gap as either police or advocates. (As our report
on the faculty surveys will state, this perception of the
faculty is essentially correct.)
There is no evidence that personal moral standards have
declined at Stanford, though the willingness to hold others to
universalistic standards seems to have declined substantially.
The 25% of our sample who do endorse the several
universalistic value statements in the questionnaire, and who
are substantially more willing to observe the reporting obliga
tion—these students are not, apparently, very visible or very
vocal among their fellow students. They do not have as much
experience with instances of cheating as the rest of the
sample; and, or course, it may be lack of experience which
permits them to predict that their hypothetical behavior
would differ from that of the majority.
We find no strong support for exam proctoring, even
among those subgroups most aware of and concerned about
levels of cheating.
The minority most exposed to cheating seem to favor
unilateral solutions, while the rest are more likely to reject
proctoring or prefer it as a faculty and/or student option. In
short, both the need to modify the current Honor Code, and
the appropriateness of alternative modifications continue to
be judgmental matters: our data provide no clear answers.
Our own interpretation—and it is merely that—is that
Stanford's Honor Code suffers primarily from invisibility
ignorance and apathy better describe our sample than dis
honesty and anxiety. While some modifications may be in
order (e.g., eliminating the reporting obligation, and per
mitting proctoring at studen' and/or instructor preference), it
is premature to consider abandoning the current system.
An educational program is needed, not simply on the
contents of the Code but also on topics like "What plagiarism
is and how to avoid it." (English and communication have
such a statement and some faculty members, at least, distri
bute copies to their students.)
People who throw out the baby with the bath water are
usually unaware that the baby is there; and until the
presence, characteristics, and value of the Honor Code are
widely known on campus, hasty action—like pulling the
plug—would be both unnecessary and undesirable.
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %
Do you consider yourself to be:
Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 52 46
Not well informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 35 44
The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66
Support it by their behavior? 75 68
Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:
% replying "Yes" to Undergrad Grad
1. "Padding" a few items on a biblio- 23 8

2. Copying a few sentences of material 35 13

4. Writing a paper for another student 3 3
5. Getting questions or answers from
someone who has already taken the same
exam 13 8
6. Giving answers to other students

7. Arranging with other students to give
or receive answers by use of signals 1 0
8. Arranging to sit next to someone who

Because the actions range from trivial to serious, and
these distributions count acts, not individuals, we construc
ted three indices of so-called cheating behavior. The first
index counts the number of respondents who checked at
least one item of the 1 7-item set shown above. The second
index is also a count, but excludes items 1-3 above. The third
index counts examination cheating only (items 5-10, 14-15).

At least one act of cheating (all items included) 70 42
"Serious" cheating (excludes 1-3) 45 27
Examination cheating 31 15
Our respondent's perceptions of the amount of cheatiny
among their fellow students are most usefully viewed in the
context of their self-reports of cheating, a topic addressed in
Section 4, and in comparison with the 1961 data, discussed
in Section 3. Suffice it to say here that undergraduates
perceive substantially more cheating than do graduate stu
dents:

Respondents were asked to estimate, in percentage terms,
levels and types of cheating, levels of discovered cheating,
types of discipline imposed, etc. It is surprising, given their
differences in personal observation of cheating, that the
percentage estimates provided by graduates and undergradu
ates are quite similar. Some examples follow:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage have cheated since coming to Stanford."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-15%) 35% 53%
Medium estimate (16-50%) 51 38
High estimate (above 15
High estimate (above 50%) 14 10
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheat frequently."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 44% 43%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 44 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 13

"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage are discovered. "
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate <0-4% 43% 41%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 43 41
High estimate (above 15%) 14 18
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage are discovered
by the instructor."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-70%) 47% 42%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 34 34
High estimate (above 97%) 19 24
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for
cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 49% 41%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 47 41
High estimate (above 85%) 4 18
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for
cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases action is taken by the instructor."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-35%) 39% 54%
Medium estimate (36-90%) 52 42
High estimate (above 90%) 9 4
Our respondents were asked how they learned about most
of the cases of cheating and plagiarim that they know about.
The student grapevine predominates among undergraduates,
but not for graduates:
Undergrads Grads
Observing the instances yourself 19% 23%
Hearing about them from the offenders 8 4
Hearing about them from other students
on the grapevine 55 33
Hearing about them through official channels
(e.g.. The Daily, Dean's Office,
a faculty member, etc.) 18 40
We turn now to two questions which will be reexamined
from other angles in subsequent sections of this report.
Though not directly addressing Honor Code issues, they
indicate the amount of support for the "reporting obliga
tion"—that observers of cheating report the offenders. The
low support expressed is all the more striking because the
questions pose hypothetical situations:
Suppose you saw a student cheating. What would you do?
Undergrads Grads
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 5% (1) 10%
Ask him to report himself and report him
if he fails to do so 3 ( (3) 10
Express disapproval informally but not
report him 34 (68) 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 33 (5) 17
Ignore the incident 25 (23) 29
Graduates and undergraduates agree about how their
behavior would change were the offender "a close friend":
the undergraduate percentages are shown in parentheses
above. If the offender were "a campus leader," however,
reporting becomes somewhat more likely, increasing to 17%
for undergraduates and 28% for graduates.
The second hypothetical question shows only small differ
ences between graduates and undergraduates; the percentages
below are for the undergraduate respondents.
If someone asked you for help during a test or exam,
what would you do?
Undergrad %
Give him the answer 2
Say nothing but expose your paper so
he can copy the answer 2
Ignore or turn down his request 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 21
Report him to the appropriate authorities 2
If the person seeking help were a friend, the percentage
selecting the first or second option increases to 21%; re
actions to "a campus leader" or "someone you disliked
personally" are not substantially different from those shown
above for an unspecified person.
One question attempts to assess in a global sort of way
"the cheating problem":
"Do you believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty at Stanford poses a serious threat to the academic
process?"
Undergrad %
Yes, very serious 11
Moderately serious 32
Not very serious 55

Between one-fifth ana about half of the undergraduate
population support the introduction of examination proctor
ing, or allowing for proctoring as an option:

Graduate student responses differ in that many more
appear in the No Opinion column; when preferences are
expressed, they are in the same direction as those shown
above for undergraduates.
Asked who should serve as exam proctors, class instruc
tors and graduate TAs—in that order—are overwhelmingly
preferred over students from outside the class. Similarly, the
majority of respondents think that students should not
participate in "identifying and selecting from a pool of
potential proctors":

Finally, students were asked what probable effects would
result from instituting exam proctoring. Below we show the
undergraduate responses; where graduate responses are sub
stantially different, they appear in parentheses.

of trust 44 ( 32)
Students would feel protected from a

The incident of cheating in other areas would
increase (e.g., take-home exams, lab reports). 16
Students would no longer feel obliged to behave
honestly on examinations 12
We now turn, in the following sections, to more detailed
considerations of the results of our study, broadly and
briskly described above.
Section 2: The Role of Background Characteristics
It is a truism of social research that one can always find
background characteristics of respondents which correlate—at
impressive statistical levels—with the dependent variables
under scrutiny. This study is no exception.
Separately for graduates and undergraduates, we cross
tabulated a range of background characteristics with a long
but selective list of variables concerning values, perceptions,
and behaviors. We found many, many differences; undergrad
uate class, academic department, and—to a lesser extent
graduate school intentions, sex, and citizenship, all show
correlations with many of our value and behavior indicators.
In the interests of brevity, clarity, and progress, we have
selected from this mass of data in two ways: first, only those
findings of central policy interest to the SCLC are being
reported here; and second, only those patterns of relation
ships which are internally consistent will receive attention.
An example which meets the first criterion but fails the
second: Freshmen and sophomores are more likely to know
that the Honor Code prohibits proctoring, but less likely to
agree that the Honor Code "regulates faculty behavior." Both
relationships are statistically significant; viewed together,
however, they don't make sense and are better politely
dismissed than puzzled over (e.g., "It appears that undergrad
uate class is not systematically related to knowledge of
Honor Code contents.")
Tables showing the relationships described in this section
r,ro available in the appendices. Throughout what follows,
"sophomores" should be understood to include our four
token freshmen.
Undergraduate class relates in a variety of ways to several
key variables, especially perceptions of cheating. Honor Code
commitment, and attitudes toward proctoring. Sophomores
have seen less cheating and fewer instances of students
reporting others for cheating; they are, however, slightly
more likely to have seen instructors ignoring cheating behav
ior. Although their self-reported cheating varies only slightly
from that of upperclassmen, sophomores are more likely to
worry about false accusations of cheating.
Sophomores are especially likely to state that the Honor
Code system should be altered, and least likely to describe
themselves as believing strongly in the current system. They
favor the introduction of exam proctoring more than upper
classmen do, especially in classes with enrollments over 30,
and/or in required preprofessional classes.
Sophomores' attitudes and experiences extend to their
perceptions of other students and faculty: they are least
likely to think other students favor continuation of the
current Honor Code; while more likely to believe that faculty
know about the Honor Code and its requirements, they are
least likely to think faculty favor its continuation or support
it by their behavior.
Differences by undergraduate major are, by and large,
inconsistent and statistically small—few exceed 10%. There is
some tendency for respondents in social science departments
to see a world that is consistently slightly different from that
seen by others; the humanities, science, and engineering
students do not generally differ greatly from each other in
patterned or consistent ways.
Social science majors are distinctive in the following
respects: they report having seen more cheating, more often
been asked for help on exams, more often observed an
instructor ignoring cheating, knowing of more instances of
students reporting offenders, and more likely to think that
the current level of academic dishonesty poses a serious
threat to the educational process.
Their self-reports of cheating are high on three of the six
items where area of major shows a difference; unlike the
other disciplinary areas, they are low on no item. They do
not, however, conspicuously favor exam proctoring; indeed,
they are least willing to proctor "as a University obligation,"
though the percent willing doubles "if paid" (the other
disciplinary areas show a decrease in willingness if proctoring
were a paid job). While not especially in favor of any of the
proctoring options, social science majors are least likely to
believe that an effect of proctoring would be that "the Honor
Code would lose meaning."
Many of the areas in which social science majors differ
from our other undergraduate respondents also differentiate
between undergraduates with professional school versus grad
uate school intentions.
On all variables relating to knowledge of cheating, general
perceptions of the extent of cheating, and self-reported
cheating, either no differences appear or the profession
oriented students are higher—i.e., more aware of cheating and
higher rates of self-reported cheating.
On the Honor Code quiz, profession-oriented students are
less likely to know that exam proctoring is prohibited; later
questions show them to be more in favor of mandatory
proctoring, slightly more willing to proctor as an obligation,
and much more willing to proctor if paid to do so.
The two groups also differ in the results they would
expect from proctoring: graduate school-oriented students
believe that students would feel threatened, while the profes
sion-oriented think that "feeling protected" is a more likely
outcome.
Sex and ethnic background are generally unrewarding
variables in this study. Two self-reported cheating items, both
referring to copying from another's paper during an exam,
show women less likely—by 10% or more—to cheat in this
fashion.
Women are more likely to consider themselves "not well
informed" about the Honor Code, though their quiz scores
are no worse than the men's. Mandatory proctoring receives
more support from women; other proctoring options, how
ever, are not conspicuously supported by one sex or the
other. Favorable effects of proctoring—e.g., that students
would feel protected—are cited more frequently by women;
men are more likely to respond that an Honor Code would
lose meaning and/or that a meaningful Honor Code would
cease to exist.
The ethnic background tables include both graduates and
undergraduates in order to obtain a statistically comfortable
number of "non-Caucasian" respondents (black, chicano,
Spanish surname, native American, Asian American, or

"other"). The ethnic conglomerate may be meaningless; but,
in any case, being "non-Caucasian" does not relate consis
tently or significantly to any of the behavioral or attitudinal
variables in our study.
Background Variables and the Graduate Sample
The obvious and occasionally interesting differences dis
cussed with respect to our undergraduate respondents are
not, in general, evident among the graduate respondents in
our sample. There are not as many cases, and two areas
(Earth Sciences and H & S Humanities) include too few cases
to allow attention to comparative percentages.
The reader may remember from Section 1 that experience
with and awareness of academic dishonesty is signfficantly
lower among Stanford's graduate student population. One
result of this difference is that is is less rewarding—indeed
discouragint—to examine departmental or other background
variables with respect to the respondent's own cheating or
awareness of it: there are simply too few cases to yield
dependable percentages. Thus we have a reduced set of
variables to examine; however—to the extent that any disci
plinary area stands out as consistently different from the
other two—it is, at the graduate level, that of H & S science
and math students.
Not many variables, even with the reduced set, show
disciplinary differences. Those that do tend to be those
discussed both earlier and later in this report—those items
with respect to which, for a variety of reasons, our sample
respondents seem to differ. On these variables, shown in
tabular form in the appendices, graduate students in H & S
science and math departments come through as personally
moral pessimists.
The differences are neither wholly consistent nor statis
tically awesome, but it appears that the science/math sub
group is more likely to endorse the broadly-stated values of
honesty, to not worry much personally about cheating, and
to cheat less; to perceive less Honor Code support and
knowledge among fellow-students and faculty; and to not
favor the proctoring remedy, anticipating several ill effects.
With flags of caution waving wildly, we close this section
with a few comments about the graduate student population
who are not U.S. citizens. It is a small group (only 18
respondents), and hence the need for caution. The differ
ences in responses between citizens and noncitizens, however,
are surprisingly consistent over a range of variables—unlike
our results with the "non-Caucasian" background variable.
To summarize the tables which appear in the appendices,
value statements which citizens tend to endorse (e.g. "Most
students want to be honest."), noncitizens indicate "Not
Sure"; others which citizens tend to disagree with (e.g.,
"Reporting someone for cheating is worse than cheating"),
noncitizens tend to endorse. They express less commitment
to the Honor Code and perceive less support among other
students. They are less supportive of (or less opinionated
about) various proctoring options, less willing to serve as
proctors, and likely to expect more negative results to follow
the introduction of proctoring. These several areas of differ
ence are not always statistically large, but the fact that
differences consistently appear is deserving of some atten
tion.
Section 3: Some Comparisons Between 1961 and 1976
Before discussing the results of our comparisons over
time, it is appropriate to restate some of the differences
between the studies which restrict the ease with which our
comparisons may safely lead to firm conclusions:
1) The 1961 results are based on only 75 undergraduates,
a 75% response rate from the sample;
2) The 1961 study was nationwide, sponsored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and covered many topics related to
social control processes, whereas our study is internally
sponsored and relatively narrow in scope; and
3) The representation of freshmen in the 1961 survey
was proportional to their population size, which is not true
of 1976 freshmen.
On the positive side, the questions we chose to repeat are
identical in wording and response categories to the 1961
versions; also, background items for which we have other
sources of trend data—e.g., sex, age, grade average, ethnic
background, and type of campus housing—show changes very
similar to those in the questionnaire responses.
We will discuss several interesting comparisons in this
section; attention will focus first, however, on four findings
of special interest to the SCLC.
First, contrary to prevailing opinion, our data show no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976.
Second, current students are more likely to have actually
seen instances of cheating, and to perceive-in a general
way—that more cheating exists, than was true of their
predecessors.
Third, there is a notable drop in expressed support for
value statements concerning honesty, especially those with a
universal tone—e.g., "Under no circumstances is cheating ever
justified."
Fourth, support for the reporting aspect of the Honor
Code has indeed declined; in 1961, about one-quarter of the
sample would, m a hypothetical cheating situation, report the

offender or ask that he report himself—compared to less than
10% who say they would do so in 1976.
Self-Reports of Academic Dishonesty
The fo;lowing self-reports were solicited in 1961 and
1976 with the results shown in the two columns to the right:

Another set of questions allowed five responses ranging

year, selected the fourth or fifth categories, that we show
below only the predominent response categories.

The lack of change shown above is worth notice; where
there are changes—in either direction—they are too small to
warrant serious attention. It is, we believe, a safe conclusion
that self-reported acts of cheating are unchanged between
1961 and 1976. (We should point out that in Bowers' 1961
data, the Stanford level of cheating was found to be very low
in a nation-wide context. Even on those questions which
show an increase between 1961 and 1976, the current
Stanford percent is below the nationwide 1961 sample
percent.)
PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIC
DISHONESTY
Here we see some substantial differences. In both years,
students were asked, "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], have you seen another student cheating during a
test or exam?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 76% 49% Once 12% 9% A few 7% 29%

It seems indisputable that current students are more likely
to have personally witnessed cheating activity. Regardless of
their own experience, they also hold different perceptions of
the extent of academic dishonesty and the functioning of
disciplinary processes. Students in both years were asked to
estimate, in percentage terms, the frequency of the following
events:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage has cheated since coming to Stanford."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-15%) 42% 35%
Medium estimate (16-60%) 37 51
High estimate (above 60%) 21 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheats frequently."
1961 1976

Medium estimate (21-75%) 45 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 12

roughly what percentage is discovered."
1961 1976

Medium estimate (5-15%) 50 43
High estimate (above 15%) 23 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage is discovered
by the course instructor."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-70%) 32% 47%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 68 34
High estimate (above 97%) 0 19
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarized and are

other students."
1961 1976

"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty

age of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."

Medium estimate (21-85%) 9 47
High estimate (above 85%) 1 4
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty

age of the cases disciplinary action is taken by the course
instructor.

Medium estimate (36-90%) 40 52
High estimate (above 90%) 12 9
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty

1961 1976
Low estimate (0-5%) 19% 32%
Medium estimate (6-50%) 39 56
High estimate (above 50%) 42 11
Comparing percentage distributions of percentage esti
mates can be quite confusing. Some differences, however,
come through quite clearly: 1961 respondents estimated a
higher "discovery rate" for cheaters, expected more disco
veries to be made by faculty, and substantially more cheating
cases being passed to authorities beyond the classroom. In
neither year did many students perceive a high level of
self-reporting ("0%" the majority estimate—chosen by 59% in
1961 and 69% currently).
These indicated trends in the percentage estimates are
confirmed by another set of responses elsewhere in the
questionnaire:

Unfortunately, our 1961 data are in the form of com
puter print-out rather than IBM cards, so we are unable to
examine the relationships between these value endorsements
and other variables of obvious interest—like self-reports of
cheating. As we will discuss later in Section 4, 1976 respon
dents who agree strongly with some of these statements are
conspicuously different from their fellow-students in several
other ways as well.
RESPONSES TO HYPOTHETICAL CHEATING SITUA
TIONS
Earlier we examined responses about cheating actually
observed; here we inquire what our responses would do if
they observed cheating.
"Suppose you saw a student cheating on a test or exam.
What would you do?"
1961 1976
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 4% 5%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 22 3
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 36 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 14 33
Ignore the incident 2525
In both years, one-quarter of the students in this hypothe
tical situation would ignore the incident. Also in both years,
the modal choice is to express disapproval but not to report
the offender.
The big change is in the second most popular form of
social control-in 1961, it is to ask the person to report
himself and report him if he doesn't do so, and in 1976 it is
to mention the incident to others but not report it.

"How often have the following things happened that you
knowabout?"

As before, the areas of large change are in perceived
self-reporting and faculty alertness and activity, student
reporting of others is seen to be only slightly less frequent
now.
Student views of faculty are tapped in yet another way,
with consistent differences over time again evident.

Before considering behaviors and perceptions more di
rectly related to the Honor Code, we'll look briefly at some
value statements put to both undergraduate samples.
VALUES ABOUT HONESTY
Here we see some of the largest differences of any found
so far in our several analyses. There can be little doubt that
the changes in the "Agree Strongly" column below, especial
ly for the first two statements, constitute real differences
between our two samples.
Agree Agree Not Disagree Disagree

is worse than cheating 3 4 10 7 12 19 38 31 38 38

It may seem surprising that only 26% of the 1961 sample
supported the reporting obligation of the Honor Code; but
other responses show that students also perceived some
student support for reporting in 1961—the combination of
general perception plus 26% commitment may well have
resulted in a social control system that effectively reduced
academic dishonesty.
Another hypothetical situation was posed:
1961 1976
Give him the answer 0% 2%
Say nothing but expose your paper
so he can copy the answer 4 2
Ignore or turn down his request 59 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 32 21
Report him to the appropriate
authorities 5 2
Two categories show 10-15% differences; ignoring or
rejecting such a request is a more popular option now, and
expressing disapproval informally is less popular. Neither
sample views reporting the request with much favor.
Both hypothetical situations were elaborated by changing
the identity of the cheater from an unspecified individual to
"a campus leader" and "a close friend"; the second situation
added a third, "some you disliked personally." In both years,
a friend observed cheating is less likely to be reported and
more likely to be informally disapproved of; campus leaders
>n both years are more severely treated than others—27% of
the 1961 sample, and 17% in 1976, would report him, and
only about 20% would ignore the incident.
For the solicited exam aid situation, our two samples are
similar with the following exceptions; whereas currently 21%
would cooperate with a friend's request, only 7% thought
they would do so in 1961; both samples are more likely to
express disapproval to a friend than to the other specified
offenders, 42% selecting this treatment of a friend in 1961,
and 30% in 1976. For neither sample is reporting a likely
option—even for campus leaders in 1961, the figure is only
7%.
This concludes our review of trend findings of key
interest to the SCLC. We have restricted our interpretive
comments to the analytic variety, indicating which differ
ences seemed, to us, worth serious attention.
Another level of interpretation, however, is needed with
respect to one blatant anomaly: How is it that individual
self-reported cheating is unchanged, but current students
report seeing more cheating than their predecessors? One
possible interpretation is simply that cheating is more conspi
cuous when it does occur; that the change in moral climate,
suggested by the value endorsement data, has both allowed
current cheaters to be more open in their activities and
opened more widely the eyes and ears of noncheaters. To the
extent that our 1976 data permit, we will examine these
possibilities in Section 4. Our aim here is to draw attention to
the phenomenon and encourage speculation.
1961 AND 1976 VIEWS ON THE PURPOSES OF A COL
LEGE EDUCATION
Several questions on the Bowers questionnaire, while not
related to the SCLC task, were so potentially interesting to
repeat 15 years later that we easily yielded to the temptation.
Students were asked to consider a list of purposes of a college
education, to indicate the importance of each purpose to the
respondent, and then to select that purpose considered most
important to the respondent.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Most
Important Purpose
1961 1976
gg Provide a basic general education and
appreciation of ideas
Provide vocational training; develop
skills and techniques directly
applicable to my career
Develop my ability to get along with
different kinds of people
Develop my knowledge and interest in the
® ® community and world problems
Help develop my moral capacities, ethical
® standards and values
Prepare me for a happy marriage
® and family life
Looking at these comparisons, it is hard to believe that 15
turbulent years have passed since the first survey. With two
exceptions, the differences are smaller than pollsters ex
pected to find over a one-week time span! Amidst such
constancy, the two shifts stand out sharply: Current students
attribute somewhat less importance to acquiring knowledge
about world problems (though the change is not large); and
our sample virtually rejects preparation for marriage as an
important purpose of college—in 1961, 53% assigned some
importance to this purpose, compared with 28% today.
With some trepidation, we also repeated the question,
"How well satisfied are you with your educational experience
at Stanford [at this school] ?"
1961 1976
Very well satisfied 38% 24%
Fairly well satisfied 55 63
Not very well satisfied 7 13
Not at all satisfied 0 0
The drop in the top category, while not huge, is big
enough to qualify as real. We did not inquire into reasons for
the respondents' level of satisfaction (nor did Bowers), and
thus cannot help those wishing to interpret or evaluate the
significance of this change.
Section 4: A Closer Look at Self-Reported Cheating
While we know more now about the state of academic
honesty at Stanford than we did prior to the survey, we still
should look closer at the correlates of self-reported cheating
activity.
Our data do not allow us to assign causality and statis
tically test alternative explanations of cheating behavior; we
can, however, change tactics from preceding sections and
focus on different levels of cheating—seeking related variables
that are potentially manipulable, be it by policy or informal
effort.
We make frequent use in this section of the three
"cheating indices" introd - "~ed in Section 1: Cheating Index,
"Serious" Cheating, and Exam Cheating. By cross-tabulating
each index with a wide range of variables, we looked for
differences between the three indices (e.g.. Are those who
admit to serious cheating different from those who admit to

what one SCLC member labeled "dilettante cheating"?), as
well as for differences between self-confessed cheaters of
whatever stripe and noncheaters.
First, we examine the hypothesis that noncheaters are
better informed about the contents of the Honor Code than
are those who cheat. We created a Knowledge Index based on
the quiz-type questions, high scores going to those with a
higher proportion of right answers. Cross-tabulating the
Knowledge Index with each cheating index produced no
difference worth reporting. It appears that our respondents
who cheat know neither more nor less about the Honor Code
than their contemporaries who don't cheat.
Perceived cheating is, not surprisingly, positively related
to self-reported cheating; the indices work similarly, but the
relationship shows most clearly in the example below:
"Since you have been at Stanford, have you seen another
student cheating during a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Never 61% 54% 29%
Once 9 8 9
A few times 23 27 39
Several times 5 7 11
Many times 2 3 12

55 41 40 46 4 13
26 29 47 45 27 26
10 4 43 24 47 72
The biggest difference is between those who are high on
our index (N=s6), versus those who are medium or low. This
pattern reappears in response to the question, "What would
you do if you saw someone cheating on a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 9% 4% 4%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 5 4 0
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 42 37 23
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 28 29 39
Ignore the incident 16 25 34
Similarly, those who admit to having cheated are more
likely to have been asked for help during a test or exam; in
response to such a request, they are more likely to aid the
person or ignore the incident (versus reporting or expressing
disapproval).
Strong differences appear when the cheating index is
cross-tabulated with the three universalistic value statements
(again, all three cheating indices work similarly). The follow
ing table examplifies the differences found with respect to
the other value statements as well.
"Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified."
Cheating Index Score Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 74% 40% 26%
Agree mildly 23 14
Not sure 5 19 24
Disagree mildly 9 27
Disagree strongly 14 9

The differences seen above are substantially reduced when
respondents are asked to indicate their agreement with the
statement: "Honesty is desirable, but currently impossible at
Stanford."
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 10% 8% 11%
Agree mildly 12 16 24
Not sure 21 12 14
Disagree mildly 16 21 22
Disagree strongly 41 43 29
We also find no large differences with respect to level of
commitment to the current Honor Code, or to the serious
ness of the current level of academic dishonesty at Stanford.
There is a modest tendency for noncheaters to prefer proc
toring, but the differences are neither consistently related to
level of self-reported cheating nor larger than about 10%.
With respect to background variables, seniors tend to
appear in the medium and high categories on our scales (52%
of the "highs" are seniors). There is a discernable but
undramatic tendency for social science majors to be high,
engineering and science majors medium, and humanities low.
There is a similar consistent, modest tendency for students
with professional school plans to score higher on our indices
than those planning to attend graduate school.
A final small correlation that is packed with interpretative
potential: Noncheaters are more likely to be "very satisfied"
with their educational experiences at Stanford than respon
dents scoring medium or high (% "very satisfied," 33%, 24%,
and 18% respectively).
Since our largest unexpected differences, both here and in
the 1961 comparisons, have involved three value statements,
we decided to look more closely at our respondents' value
endorsements. We created an index called Strong Values, ana
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each respondent according
to how many times he indicated strong agreement with these
statements:
1) Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified.
2) Students are morally obligated not to cheat.
3) Cheating directly contradicts the goals of education.
Our population split very neatly into the four categories,
about 25% in each.
Our subsequent cross-tabulations yielded interesting re
sults, which we will first summarize, and then examine some
details. Respondents with high scores on our Strong Values
index are much less aware of, involved in, and opinionated
about all matters related to cheating at Stanford. Their
responses to hypothetical cheating situations are very likely
to include expressing disapproval, even to friends (similar to
the 1961 response for the whole sample).
They learn about cheating primarily from official
channels, and about the Honor Code from signing blue
books. They are more likely to indicate strong belief in the
Honor Code, and to believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty constitutes a moderate or serious problem They
do not, however, hold consistently different perceptions of
fellow students or faculty with respect to Honor Code
support, nor are their opinions about specific aspects of the
Honor Code different from their fellow respondents. They
are not conspicuously either for or against proctoring; on
these and other questions soliciting opinions about hypothe
tical effects or the attitudes of others, they are more likely to
check "not sure."
They are, in sum, an interesting, not easily comprehen
sible, group of people—slightly more likely to be female and
majoring in the humanities, unlikely to be seniors, and more
likely to be very satisfied with their educational experience at
Stanford.
The tables that follow show the most impressive of the
differences discussed above. Other tables referred to but not
presented below are in the appendices.

Another section of the questionnaire elicited many speci
fic course characteristics of courses taken winter quarter by
our respondents. Among other things, they were asked about
the extent and types of cheating that occurred in the two
winter courses they liked best, and the one liked least.
Each single cheating item received too few mentions to be
useful to us, so we grouped together all mentions of any type
or level of cheating for the course liked best and created an
index, and similarly for the course liked least. Only 17
nonzero scores are on the first index (mentions of cheating
instances), and 36 on the course-liked-least index. The index
items are:
Respondent personally knew about or learned about. . . .
* Any other students cheating on the final exam, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on tests other than the
final, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on homework or lab
assignments, and/or;
* At least half the other students cheating at one or
another time during the course.
We were interested in learning what types of courses were
likely settings for cheating; by cross-tabulating the other
course characteristics against the index scores, we identified
several characteristics differentiating courses with observed
cheating from other courses.
Those courses liked best in which cheating occurred were
likely to be introductory, have more than 30 students
enrolled, and have short-answer exams (versus open-book,
essay, or take-homes). Past tests were likely to be available
for study purposes, seating was staggered during exams, and
either a TA or the instructor was likely to remain in the room
during exams.
Those observing cheating are likely to be high on our
cheating indices, which supports our earlier conclusion that
those who observe cheating are themselves more likely to
cheat. The course-least-liked index tables show similar results.
On the whole, we suspect that the attempt in this section
to understand better students who cheat and settings con
ducive to cheating events has produced results more useful to
the student of social deviance than to the concerned policy
evaluator.
The characteristics most obviously related to self-reported
cheating are value stances of a special, universalistic sort—a

trait probably not nurtured during the undergraduate years,
or seniors would not be conspicuously absent from the group
of high scorers on our values index.
With respect to the finding that those who cheat are much
more likely to observe other cheating, our data don't allow us
to establish the order of the relationship—i.e., does own
cheating heighten awareness and thus perceptions of others'
cheating, or does one begin cheating in response to observing
it? Probably both processes occur, but we cannot disentangle
them.
One main policy modification, the introduction of op
tional or mandatory proctoring of exams, is not strongly or
consistently favored by our population of noncheaters, nor
by the overlapping subgroup of those high on our values
index. Proctoring already exists in some classes, and our
respondents are more likely to report instances of cheating in
courses with proctored exams.
That does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that
proctoring is ineffective; that students do see cheating in
proctored exam courses may, however, help to explain the
lack of widespread support for proctoring as a solution to the
ills of academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
We have examined, described, and assessed a large amount
of data on Stanford students—their personal honesty, their
valuation of honesty, their experiences with and perceptions
of academic dishonesty among their fellow students, their
concern about cheating, their attitudes toward and know
ledge of the Honor Code, and their opinions about possible
modifications of the current system. What, after all this, can
we safely assert that we know?
First, and perhaps most important, is the conclusion that
Stanford does not currently have a "cheating problem";
those who have worried about a West Point level scandal may
sleep soundly, at least for a while. While cheating continues
to exist in academic endeavors, our data show that the
incidence of self-reported cheating among undergraduates is
approximately the same now as it was in 1961.
The increased selectivity exercised in undergraduate ad
missions may account in part for this lack of change;
although the pressures on students have certainly increased,
the student body includes fewer undergraduates who cannot
cope with the academic demands made of them
The picture is not entirely rosy, however. Indeed, it is
only a slight exaggeration to state that the low incidence of
cheating is independent of the current control system rather
than a result of it. Students are not knowledgeable about the
contents of the Honor Code, nor is the majority highly
committed to it. They similarly perceive their fellow students
and faculty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not
actually indifferent or opposed to it. The crux of the matter
is that the system is not seen to be working.
Students are both more aware of the cheating that does
exist, and less willing to report offenders (or ask them to
report themselves). Nor do they see faculty members filling
the activity gap as either police or advocates. (As our report
on the faculty surveys will state, this perception of the
faculty is essentially correct.)
There is no evidence that personal moral standards have
declined at Stanford, though the willingness to hold others to
universalistic standards seems to have declined substantially.
The 25% of our sample who do endorse the several
universalistic value statements in the questionnaire, and who
are substantially more willing to observe the reporting obliga
tion—these students are not, apparently, very visible or very
vocal among their fellow students. They do not have as much
experience with instances of cheating as the rest of the
sample; and, or course, it may be lack of experience which
permits them to predict that their hypothetical behavior
would differ from that of the majority.
We find no strong support for exam proctoring, even
among those subgroups most aware of and concerned about
levels of cheating.
The minority most exposed to cheating seem to favor
unilateral solutions, while the rest are more likely to reject
proctoring or prefer it as a faculty and/or student option. In
short, both the need to modify the current Honor Code, and
the appropriateness of alternative modifications continue to
be judgmental matters: our data provide no clear answers.
Our own interpretation—and it is merely that—is that
Stanford's Honor Code suffers primarily from invisibility
ignorance and apathy better describe our sample than dis
honesty and anxiety. While some modifications may be in
order (e.g., eliminating the reporting obligation, and per
mitting proctoring at studen' and/or instructor preference), it
is premature to consider abandoning the current system.
An educational program is needed, not simply on the
contents of the Code but also on topics like "What plagiarism
is and how to avoid it." (English and communication have
such a statement and some faculty members, at least, distri
bute copies to their students.)
People who throw out the baby with the bath water are
usually unaware that the baby is there; and until the
presence, characteristics, and value of the Honor Code are
widely known on campus, hasty action—like pulling the
plug—would be both unnecessary and undesirable.
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %
Do you consider yourself to be:
Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 52 46
Not well informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 35 44
The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66
Support it by their behavior? 75 68
Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:
% replying "Yes" to Undergrad Grad
1. "Padding" a few items on a biblio- 23 8

2. Copying a few sentences of material 35 13

3. Copying answers from a text or other 28 13

4. Writing a paper for another student 3 3
5. Getting questions or answers from
someone who has already taken the same
exam 13 8
6. Giving answers to other students

7. Arranging with other students to give
or receive answers by use of signals 1 0
8. Arranging to sit next to someone who

Because the actions range from trivial to serious, and
these distributions count acts, not individuals, we construc
ted three indices of so-called cheating behavior. The first
index counts the number of respondents who checked at
least one item of the 1 7-item set shown above. The second
index is also a count, but excludes items 1-3 above. The third
index counts examination cheating only (items 5-10, 14-15).

"Serious" cheating (excludes 1-3) 45 27

Our respondent's perceptions of the amount of cheatiny
among their fellow students are most usefully viewed in the
context of their self-reports of cheating, a topic addressed in
Section 4, and in comparison with the 1961 data, discussed
in Section 3. Suffice it to say here that undergraduates
perceive substantially more cheating than do graduate stu
dents:

Respondents were asked to estimate, in percentage terms,
levels and types of cheating, levels of discovered cheating,
types of discipline imposed, etc. It is surprising, given their
differences in personal observation of cheating, that the
percentage estimates provided by graduates and undergradu
ates are quite similar. Some examples follow:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage have cheated since coming to Stanford."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-15%) 35% 53%
Medium estimate (16-50%) 51 38
High estimate (above 15
High estimate (above 50%) 14 10
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheat frequently."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 44% 43%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 44 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 13

"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage are discovered. "
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate <0-4% 43% 41%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 43 41
High estimate (above 15%) 14 18
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage are discovered
by the instructor."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-70%) 47% 42%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 34 34
High estimate (above 97%) 19 24
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for
cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 49% 41%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 47 41
High estimate (above 85%) 4 18
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for
cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases action is taken by the instructor."
Undergrad Grad

Medium estimate (36-90%) 52 42
High estimate (above 90%) 9 4
Our respondents were asked how they learned about most
of the cases of cheating and plagiarim that they know about.
The student grapevine predominates among undergraduates,
but not for graduates:
Undergrads Grads
Observing the instances yourself 19% 23%
Hearing about them from the offenders 8 4
Hearing about them from other students
on the grapevine 55 33
Hearing about them through official channels
(e.g.. The Daily, Dean's Office,
a faculty member, etc.) 18 40
We turn now to two questions which will be reexamined
from other angles in subsequent sections of this report.
Though not directly addressing Honor Code issues, they
indicate the amount of support for the "reporting obliga
tion"—that observers of cheating report the offenders. The
low support expressed is all the more striking because the
questions pose hypothetical situations:
Suppose you saw a student cheating. What would you do?
Undergrads Grads
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 5% (1) 10%
Ask him to report himself and report him
if he fails to do so 3 ( (3) 10
Express disapproval informally but not
report him 34 (68) 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 33 (5) 17
Ignore the incident 25 (23) 29
Graduates and undergraduates agree about how their
behavior would change were the offender "a close friend":
the undergraduate percentages are shown in parentheses
above. If the offender were "a campus leader," however,
reporting becomes somewhat more likely, increasing to 17%
for undergraduates and 28% for graduates.
The second hypothetical question shows only small differ
ences between graduates and undergraduates; the percentages
below are for the undergraduate respondents.
If someone asked you for help during a test or exam,
what would you do?
Undergrad %
Give him the answer 2
Say nothing but expose your paper so
he can copy the answer 2
Ignore or turn down his request 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 21
Report him to the appropriate authorities 2
If the person seeking help were a friend, the percentage
selecting the first or second option increases to 21%; re
actions to "a campus leader" or "someone you disliked
personally" are not substantially different from those shown
above for an unspecified person.
One question attempts to assess in a global sort of way
"the cheating problem":
"Do you believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty at Stanford poses a serious threat to the academic
process?"
Undergrad %
Yes, very serious 11
Moderately serious 32
Not very serious 55

Graduate student responses differ in that many more
appear in the No Opinion column; when preferences are
expressed, they are in the same direction as those shown
above for undergraduates.
Asked who should serve as exam proctors, class instruc
tors and graduate TAs—in that order—are overwhelmingly
preferred over students from outside the class. Similarly, the
majority of respondents think that students should not

potential proctors":

Finally, students were asked what probable effects would

undergraduate responses; where graduate responses are sub
stantially different, they appear in parentheses.

The incident of cheating in other areas would

Students would no longer feel obliged to behave

We now turn, in the following sections, to more detailed
considerations of the results of our study, broadly and
briskly described above.
Section 2: The Role of Background Characteristics
It is a truism of social research that one can always find
background characteristics of respondents which correlate—at
impressive statistical levels—with the dependent variables
under scrutiny. This study is no exception.
Separately for graduates and undergraduates, we cross
tabulated a range of background characteristics with a long
but selective list of variables concerning values, perceptions,
and behaviors. We found many, many differences; undergrad
uate class, academic department, and—to a lesser extent
graduate school intentions, sex, and citizenship, all show
correlations with many of our value and behavior indicators.
In the interests of brevity, clarity, and progress, we have
selected from this mass of data in two ways: first, only those
findings of central policy interest to the SCLC are being
reported here; and second, only those patterns of relation
ships which are internally consistent will receive attention.
An example which meets the first criterion but fails the
second: Freshmen and sophomores are more likely to know
that the Honor Code prohibits proctoring, but less likely to
agree that the Honor Code "regulates faculty behavior." Both
relationships are statistically significant; viewed together,
however, they don't make sense and are better politely
dismissed than puzzled over (e.g., "It appears that undergrad
uate class is not systematically related to knowledge of
Honor Code contents.")
Tables showing the relationships described in this section
r,ro available in the appendices. Throughout what follows,
"sophomores" should be understood to include our four
token freshmen.
Undergraduate class relates in a variety of ways to several
key variables, especially perceptions of cheating. Honor Code
commitment, and attitudes toward proctoring. Sophomores
have seen less cheating and fewer instances of students
reporting others for cheating; they are, however, slightly
more likely to have seen instructors ignoring cheating behav
ior. Although their self-reported cheating varies only slightly
from that of upperclassmen, sophomores are more likely to
worry about false accusations of cheating.
Sophomores are especially likely to state that the Honor
Code system should be altered, and least likely to describe
themselves as believing strongly in the current system. They
favor the introduction of exam proctoring more than upper
classmen do, especially in classes with enrollments over 30,
and/or in required preprofessional classes.
Sophomores' attitudes and experiences extend to their
perceptions of other students and faculty: they are least
likely to think other students favor continuation of the
current Honor Code; while more likely to believe that faculty
know about the Honor Code and its requirements, they are
least likely to think faculty favor its continuation or support
it by their behavior.
Differences by undergraduate major are, by and large,
inconsistent and statistically small—few exceed 10%. There is
some tendency for respondents in social science departments
to see a world that is consistently slightly different from that
seen by others; the humanities, science, and engineering
students do not generally differ greatly from each other in
patterned or consistent ways.
Social science majors are distinctive in the following
respects: they report having seen more cheating, more often
been asked for help on exams, more often observed an
instructor ignoring cheating, knowing of more instances of
students reporting offenders, and more likely to think that
the current level of academic dishonesty poses a serious
threat to the educational process.
Their self-reports of cheating are high on three of the six
items where area of major shows a difference; unlike the
other disciplinary areas, they are low on no item. They do
not, however, conspicuously favor exam proctoring; indeed,
they are least willing to proctor "as a University obligation,"
though the percent willing doubles "if paid" (the other
disciplinary areas show a decrease in willingness if proctoring
were a paid job). While not especially in favor of any of the
proctoring options, social science majors are least likely to
believe that an effect of proctoring would be that "the Honor
Code would lose meaning."
Many of the areas in which social science majors differ
from our other undergraduate respondents also differentiate
between undergraduates with professional school versus grad
uate school intentions.
On all variables relating to knowledge of cheating, general
perceptions of the extent of cheating, and self-reported
cheating, either no differences appear or the profession
oriented students are higher—i.e., more aware of cheating and
higher rates of self-reported cheating.
On the Honor Code quiz, profession-oriented students are
less likely to know that exam proctoring is prohibited; later
questions show them to be more in favor of mandatory
proctoring, slightly more willing to proctor as an obligation,
and much more willing to proctor if paid to do so.
The two groups also differ in the results they would
expect from proctoring: graduate school-oriented students
believe that students would feel threatened, while the profes
sion-oriented think that "feeling protected" is a more likely
outcome.
Sex and ethnic background are generally unrewarding
variables in this study. Two self-reported cheating items, both
referring to copying from another's paper during an exam,
show women less likely—by 10% or more—to cheat in this
fashion.
Women are more likely to consider themselves "not well
informed" about the Honor Code, though their quiz scores
are no worse than the men's. Mandatory proctoring receives
more support from women; other proctoring options, how
ever, are not conspicuously supported by one sex or the
other. Favorable effects of proctoring—e.g., that students
would feel protected—are cited more frequently by women;
men are more likely to respond that an Honor Code would
lose meaning and/or that a meaningful Honor Code would
cease to exist.
The ethnic background tables include both graduates and
undergraduates in order to obtain a statistically comfortable
number of "non-Caucasian" respondents (black, chicano,
Spanish surname, native American, Asian American, or

"other"). The ethnic conglomerate may be meaningless; but,
in any case, being "non-Caucasian" does not relate consis
tently or significantly to any of the behavioral or attitudinal
variables in our study.
Background Variables and the Graduate Sample
The obvious and occasionally interesting differences dis
cussed with respect to our undergraduate respondents are
not, in general, evident among the graduate respondents in
our sample. There are not as many cases, and two areas
(Earth Sciences and H & S Humanities) include too few cases
to allow attention to comparative percentages.
The reader may remember from Section 1 that experience
with and awareness of academic dishonesty is signfficantly
lower among Stanford's graduate student population. One
result of this difference is that is is less rewarding—indeed
discouragint—to examine departmental or other background
variables with respect to the respondent's own cheating or
awareness of it: there are simply too few cases to yield
dependable percentages. Thus we have a reduced set of
variables to examine; however—to the extent that any disci
plinary area stands out as consistently different from the
other two—it is, at the graduate level, that of H & S science
and math students.
Not many variables, even with the reduced set, show
disciplinary differences. Those that do tend to be those
discussed both earlier and later in this report—those items
with respect to which, for a variety of reasons, our sample
respondents seem to differ. On these variables, shown in
tabular form in the appendices, graduate students in H & S
science and math departments come through as personally
moral pessimists.
The differences are neither wholly consistent nor statis
tically awesome, but it appears that the science/math sub
group is more likely to endorse the broadly-stated values of
honesty, to not worry much personally about cheating, and
to cheat less; to perceive less Honor Code support and
knowledge among fellow-students and faculty; and to not
favor the proctoring remedy, anticipating several ill effects.
With flags of caution waving wildly, we close this section
with a few comments about the graduate student population
who are not U.S. citizens. It is a small group (only 18
respondents), and hence the need for caution. The differ
ences in responses between citizens and noncitizens, however,
are surprisingly consistent over a range of variables—unlike
our results with the "non-Caucasian" background variable.
To summarize the tables which appear in the appendices,
value statements which citizens tend to endorse (e.g. "Most
students want to be honest."), noncitizens indicate "Not
Sure"; others which citizens tend to disagree with (e.g.,
"Reporting someone for cheating is worse than cheating"),
noncitizens tend to endorse. They express less commitment
to the Honor Code and perceive less support among other
students. They are less supportive of (or less opinionated
about) various proctoring options, less willing to serve as
proctors, and likely to expect more negative results to follow
the introduction of proctoring. These several areas of differ
ence are not always statistically large, but the fact that
differences consistently appear is deserving of some atten
tion.
Section 3: Some Comparisons Between 1961 and 1976
Before discussing the results of our comparisons over
time, it is appropriate to restate some of the differences
between the studies which restrict the ease with which our
comparisons may safely lead to firm conclusions:
1) The 1961 results are based on only 75 undergraduates,
a 75% response rate from the sample;
2) The 1961 study was nationwide, sponsored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and covered many topics related to
social control processes, whereas our study is internally
sponsored and relatively narrow in scope; and
3) The representation of freshmen in the 1961 survey
was proportional to their population size, which is not true
of 1976 freshmen.
On the positive side, the questions we chose to repeat are
identical in wording and response categories to the 1961
versions; also, background items for which we have other
sources of trend data—e.g., sex, age, grade average, ethnic
background, and type of campus housing—show changes very
similar to those in the questionnaire responses.
We will discuss several interesting comparisons in this
section; attention will focus first, however, on four findings
of special interest to the SCLC.
First, contrary to prevailing opinion, our data show no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976.
Second, current students are more likely to have actually
seen instances of cheating, and to perceive-in a general
way—that more cheating exists, than was true of their
predecessors.
Third, there is a notable drop in expressed support for
value statements concerning honesty, especially those with a
universal tone—e.g., "Under no circumstances is cheating ever
justified."
Fourth, support for the reporting aspect of the Honor
Code has indeed declined; in 1961, about one-quarter of the
sample would, m a hypothetical cheating situation, report the

offender or ask that he report himself—compared to less than
10% who say they would do so in 1976.
Self-Reports of Academic Dishonesty
The fo;lowing self-reports were solicited in 1961 and
1976 with the results shown in the two columns to the right:
Check all the following which you have done at Stanford.
% responding "Yes"
1961 1976
"Padding" a few items on a bibliography 20% 23%

footnoting in a paper 35 35

of doing the work independently 32 28

already taken the same exam 8 13

his knowing about it 16 10

Having another student take an exam for you 0 0

Another set of questions allowed five responses ranging
from "Never" to "Many times"; so few persons, in either
year, selected the fourth or fifth categories, that we show
below only the predominent response categories.

The lack of change shown above is worth notice; where
there are changes—in either direction—they are too small to
warrant serious attention. It is, we believe, a safe conclusion
that self-reported acts of cheating are unchanged between
1961 and 1976. (We should point out that in Bowers' 1961
data, the Stanford level of cheating was found to be very low
in a nation-wide context. Even on those questions which
show an increase between 1961 and 1976, the current
Stanford percent is below the nationwide 1961 sample
percent.)
PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIC
DISHONESTY
Here we see some substantial differences. In both years,
students were asked, "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], have you seen another student cheating during a
test or exam?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 76% 49% Once 12% 9% A few 7% 29%
times
'61 '76 '61 *76

A similar question: "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], has another student indicated to you during a
test or exam that he wanted help?"

Never 88% 78% Once 8% 8% A few
times 3% 11%
Several Many
times 1% 2% times 0% 1%
It seems indisputable that current students are more likely
to have personally witnessed cheating activity. Regardless of
their own experience, they also hold different perceptions of
the extent of academic dishonesty and the functioning of
disciplinary processes. Students in both years were asked to
estimate, in percentage terms, the frequency of the following
events:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage has cheated since coming to Stanford."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-15%) 42% 35%
Medium estimate (16-60%) 37 51
High estimate (above 60%) 21 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheats frequently."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 43% 44%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 45 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 12
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage is discovered."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-4%) 27% 43%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 50 43
High estimate (above 15%) 23 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage is discovered
by the course instructor."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-70%) 32% 47%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 68 34
High estimate (above 97%) 0 19
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarized and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage are reported by
other students."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-10%) 66% 44%
Medium estimate (11-65%) 23 42
High estimate (above 65%) 11 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage report them
selves. "
1961 1976
Low estimate (0%) 59% 69%
Medium estimate (1-10%) 28 26
High estimate (above 10%) 13 6
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 90% 49%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 9 47
High estimate (above 85%) 1 4
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases disciplinary action is taken by the course
instructor.
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-35%) 48% 39%
Medium estimate (36-90%) 40 52
High estimate (above 90%) 12 9
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases the case is passed on to some other authority
for disciplinary action."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-5%) 19% 32%
Medium estimate (6-50%) 39 56
High estimate (above 50%) 42 11
Comparing percentage distributions of percentage esti
mates can be quite confusing. Some differences, however,
come through quite clearly: 1961 respondents estimated a
higher "discovery rate" for cheaters, expected more disco
veries to be made by faculty, and substantially more cheating
cases being passed to authorities beyond the classroom. In
neither year did many students perceive a high level of
self-reporting ("0%" the majority estimate—chosen by 59% in
1961 and 69% currently).
These indicated trends in the percentage estimates are
confirmed by another set of responses elsewhere in the
questionnaire:

Unfortunately, our 1961 data are in the form of com
puter print-out rather than IBM cards, so we are unable to
examine the relationships between these value endorsements
and other variables of obvious interest—like self-reports of
cheating. As we will discuss later in Section 4, 1976 respon
dents who agree strongly with some of these statements are
conspicuously different from their fellow-students in several
other ways as well.
RESPONSES TO HYPOTHETICAL CHEATING SITUA
TIONS
Earlier we examined responses about cheating actually
observed; here we inquire what our responses would do if
they observed cheating.
"Suppose you saw a student cheating on a test or exam.
What would you do?"
1961 1976
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 4% 5%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 22 3
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 36 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 14 33
Ignore the incident 2525
In both years, one-quarter of the students in this hypothe
tical situation would ignore the incident. Also in both years,
the modal choice is to express disapproval but not to report
the offender.
The big change is in the second most popular form of
social control-in 1961, it is to ask the person to report
himself and report him if he doesn't do so, and in 1976 it is
to mention the incident to others but not report it.

"How often have the following things happened that you
knowabout?"

As before, the areas of large change are in perceived
self-reporting and faculty alertness and activity, student
reporting of others is seen to be only slightly less frequent
now.
Student views of faculty are tapped in yet another way,
with consistent differences over time again evident.

Before considering behaviors and perceptions more di
rectly related to the Honor Code, we'll look briefly at some
value statements put to both undergraduate samples.
VALUES ABOUT HONESTY
Here we see some of the largest differences of any found
so far in our several analyses. There can be little doubt that
the changes in the "Agree Strongly" column below, especial
ly for the first two statements, constitute real differences
between our two samples.
Agree Agree Not Disagree Disagree
strongly mildly sure mildly strongly

Reporting someone for cheating
is worse than cheating 3 4 10 7 12 19 38 31 38 38

It may seem surprising that only 26% of the 1961 sample
supported the reporting obligation of the Honor Code; but
other responses show that students also perceived some
student support for reporting in 1961—the combination of
general perception plus 26% commitment may well have
resulted in a social control system that effectively reduced
academic dishonesty.
Another hypothetical situation was posed:
1961 1976
Give him the answer 0% 2%
Say nothing but expose your paper
so he can copy the answer 4 2
Ignore or turn down his request 59 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 32 21
Report him to the appropriate
authorities 5 2
Two categories show 10-15% differences; ignoring or
rejecting such a request is a more popular option now, and
expressing disapproval informally is less popular. Neither
sample views reporting the request with much favor.
Both hypothetical situations were elaborated by changing
the identity of the cheater from an unspecified individual to
"a campus leader" and "a close friend"; the second situation
added a third, "some you disliked personally." In both years,
a friend observed cheating is less likely to be reported and
more likely to be informally disapproved of; campus leaders
>n both years are more severely treated than others—27% of
the 1961 sample, and 17% in 1976, would report him, and
only about 20% would ignore the incident.
For the solicited exam aid situation, our two samples are
similar with the following exceptions; whereas currently 21%
would cooperate with a friend's request, only 7% thought
they would do so in 1961; both samples are more likely to
express disapproval to a friend than to the other specified
offenders, 42% selecting this treatment of a friend in 1961,
and 30% in 1976. For neither sample is reporting a likely
option—even for campus leaders in 1961, the figure is only
7%.
This concludes our review of trend findings of key
interest to the SCLC. We have restricted our interpretive
comments to the analytic variety, indicating which differ
ences seemed, to us, worth serious attention.
Another level of interpretation, however, is needed with
respect to one blatant anomaly: How is it that individual
self-reported cheating is unchanged, but current students
report seeing more cheating than their predecessors? One
possible interpretation is simply that cheating is more conspi
cuous when it does occur; that the change in moral climate,
suggested by the value endorsement data, has both allowed
current cheaters to be more open in their activities and
opened more widely the eyes and ears of noncheaters. To the
extent that our 1976 data permit, we will examine these
possibilities in Section 4. Our aim here is to draw attention to
the phenomenon and encourage speculation.
1961 AND 1976 VIEWS ON THE PURPOSES OF A COL
LEGE EDUCATION
Several questions on the Bowers questionnaire, while not
related to the SCLC task, were so potentially interesting to
repeat 15 years later that we easily yielded to the temptation.
Students were asked to consider a list of purposes of a college
education, to indicate the importance of each purpose to the
respondent, and then to select that purpose considered most
important to the respondent.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Most
Important Purpose
1961 1976
gg Provide a basic general education and
appreciation of ideas
Provide vocational training; develop
skills and techniques directly
applicable to my career
Develop my ability to get along with
different kinds of people
Develop my knowledge and interest in the
® ® community and world problems
Help develop my moral capacities, ethical
® standards and values
Prepare me for a happy marriage
® and family life
Looking at these comparisons, it is hard to believe that 15
turbulent years have passed since the first survey. With two
exceptions, the differences are smaller than pollsters ex
pected to find over a one-week time span! Amidst such
constancy, the two shifts stand out sharply: Current students
attribute somewhat less importance to acquiring knowledge
about world problems (though the change is not large); and
our sample virtually rejects preparation for marriage as an
important purpose of college—in 1961, 53% assigned some
importance to this purpose, compared with 28% today.
With some trepidation, we also repeated the question,
"How well satisfied are you with your educational experience
at Stanford [at this school] ?"
1961 1976
Very well satisfied 38% 24%
Fairly well satisfied 55 63
Not very well satisfied 7 13
Not at all satisfied 0 0
The drop in the top category, while not huge, is big
enough to qualify as real. We did not inquire into reasons for
the respondents' level of satisfaction (nor did Bowers), and
thus cannot help those wishing to interpret or evaluate the
significance of this change.
Section 4: A Closer Look at Self-Reported Cheating
While we know more now about the state of academic
honesty at Stanford than we did prior to the survey, we still
should look closer at the correlates of self-reported cheating
activity.
Our data do not allow us to assign causality and statis
tically test alternative explanations of cheating behavior; we
can, however, change tactics from preceding sections and
focus on different levels of cheating—seeking related variables
that are potentially manipulable, be it by policy or informal
effort.
We make frequent use in this section of the three
"cheating indices" introd - "~ed in Section 1: Cheating Index,
"Serious" Cheating, and Exam Cheating. By cross-tabulating
each index with a wide range of variables, we looked for
differences between the three indices (e.g.. Are those who
admit to serious cheating different from those who admit to

what one SCLC member labeled "dilettante cheating"?), as
well as for differences between self-confessed cheaters of
whatever stripe and noncheaters.
First, we examine the hypothesis that noncheaters are
better informed about the contents of the Honor Code than
are those who cheat. We created a Knowledge Index based on
the quiz-type questions, high scores going to those with a
higher proportion of right answers. Cross-tabulating the
Knowledge Index with each cheating index produced no
difference worth reporting. It appears that our respondents
who cheat know neither more nor less about the Honor Code
than their contemporaries who don't cheat.
Perceived cheating is, not surprisingly, positively related
to self-reported cheating; the indices work similarly, but the
relationship shows most clearly in the example below:
"Since you have been at Stanford, have you seen another
student cheating during a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Never 61% 54% 29%
Once 9 8 9
A few times 23 27 39
Several times 5 7 11
Many times 2 3 12

55 41 40 46 4 13
26 29 47 45 27 26
10 4 43 24 47 72
The biggest difference is between those who are high on
our index (N=s6), versus those who are medium or low. This
pattern reappears in response to the question, "What would
you do if you saw someone cheating on a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 9% 4% 4%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 5 4 0
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 42 37 23
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 28 29 39
Ignore the incident 16 25 34
Similarly, those who admit to having cheated are more
likely to have been asked for help during a test or exam; in
response to such a request, they are more likely to aid the
person or ignore the incident (versus reporting or expressing
disapproval).
Strong differences appear when the cheating index is
cross-tabulated with the three universalistic value statements
(again, all three cheating indices work similarly). The follow
ing table examplifies the differences found with respect to
the other value statements as well.
"Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified."
Cheating Index Score Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 74% 40% 26%
Agree mildly 23 14
Not sure 5 19 24
Disagree mildly 9 27
Disagree strongly 14 9

The differences seen above are substantially reduced when
respondents are asked to indicate their agreement with the
statement: "Honesty is desirable, but currently impossible at
Stanford."
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 10% 8% 11%
Agree mildly 12 16 24
Not sure 21 12 14
Disagree mildly 16 21 22
Disagree strongly 41 43 29
We also find no large differences with respect to level of
commitment to the current Honor Code, or to the serious
ness of the current level of academic dishonesty at Stanford.
There is a modest tendency for noncheaters to prefer proc
toring, but the differences are neither consistently related to
level of self-reported cheating nor larger than about 10%.
With respect to background variables, seniors tend to
appear in the medium and high categories on our scales (52%
of the "highs" are seniors). There is a discernable but
undramatic tendency for social science majors to be high,
engineering and science majors medium, and humanities low.
There is a similar consistent, modest tendency for students
with professional school plans to score higher on our indices
than those planning to attend graduate school.
A final small correlation that is packed with interpretative
potential: Noncheaters are more likely to be "very satisfied"
with their educational experiences at Stanford than respon
dents scoring medium or high (% "very satisfied," 33%, 24%,
and 18% respectively).
Since our largest unexpected differences, both here and in
the 1961 comparisons, have involved three value statements,
we decided to look more closely at our respondents' value
endorsements. We created an index called Strong Values, ana
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each respondent according
to how many times he indicated strong agreement with these
statements:
1) Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified.
2) Students are morally obligated not to cheat.
3) Cheating directly contradicts the goals of education.
Our population split very neatly into the four categories,
about 25% in each.
Our subsequent cross-tabulations yielded interesting re
sults, which we will first summarize, and then examine some
details. Respondents with high scores on our Strong Values
index are much less aware of, involved in, and opinionated
about all matters related to cheating at Stanford. Their
responses to hypothetical cheating situations are very likely
to include expressing disapproval, even to friends (similar to
the 1961 response for the whole sample).
They learn about cheating primarily from official
channels, and about the Honor Code from signing blue
books. They are more likely to indicate strong belief in the
Honor Code, and to believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty constitutes a moderate or serious problem They
do not, however, hold consistently different perceptions of
fellow students or faculty with respect to Honor Code
support, nor are their opinions about specific aspects of the
Honor Code different from their fellow respondents. They
are not conspicuously either for or against proctoring; on
these and other questions soliciting opinions about hypothe
tical effects or the attitudes of others, they are more likely to
check "not sure."
They are, in sum, an interesting, not easily comprehen
sible, group of people—slightly more likely to be female and
majoring in the humanities, unlikely to be seniors, and more
likely to be very satisfied with their educational experience at
Stanford.
The tables that follow show the most impressive of the
differences discussed above. Other tables referred to but not
presented below are in the appendices.

Another section of the questionnaire elicited many speci
fic course characteristics of courses taken winter quarter by
our respondents. Among other things, they were asked about
the extent and types of cheating that occurred in the two
winter courses they liked best, and the one liked least.
Each single cheating item received too few mentions to be
useful to us, so we grouped together all mentions of any type
or level of cheating for the course liked best and created an
index, and similarly for the course liked least. Only 17
nonzero scores are on the first index (mentions of cheating
instances), and 36 on the course-liked-least index. The index
items are:
Respondent personally knew about or learned about. . . .
* Any other students cheating on the final exam, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on tests other than the
final, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on homework or lab
assignments, and/or;
* At least half the other students cheating at one or
another time during the course.
We were interested in learning what types of courses were
likely settings for cheating; by cross-tabulating the other
course characteristics against the index scores, we identified
several characteristics differentiating courses with observed
cheating from other courses.
Those courses liked best in which cheating occurred were
likely to be introductory, have more than 30 students
enrolled, and have short-answer exams (versus open-book,
essay, or take-homes). Past tests were likely to be available
for study purposes, seating was staggered during exams, and
either a TA or the instructor was likely to remain in the room
during exams.
Those observing cheating are likely to be high on our
cheating indices, which supports our earlier conclusion that
those who observe cheating are themselves more likely to
cheat. The course-least-liked index tables show similar results.
On the whole, we suspect that the attempt in this section
to understand better students who cheat and settings con
ducive to cheating events has produced results more useful to
the student of social deviance than to the concerned policy
evaluator.
The characteristics most obviously related to self-reported
cheating are value stances of a special, universalistic sort—a

trait probably not nurtured during the undergraduate years,
or seniors would not be conspicuously absent from the group
of high scorers on our values index.
With respect to the finding that those who cheat are much
more likely to observe other cheating, our data don't allow us
to establish the order of the relationship—i.e., does own
cheating heighten awareness and thus perceptions of others'
cheating, or does one begin cheating in response to observing
it? Probably both processes occur, but we cannot disentangle
them.
One main policy modification, the introduction of op
tional or mandatory proctoring of exams, is not strongly or
consistently favored by our population of noncheaters, nor
by the overlapping subgroup of those high on our values
index. Proctoring already exists in some classes, and our
respondents are more likely to report instances of cheating in
courses with proctored exams.
That does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that
proctoring is ineffective; that students do see cheating in
proctored exam courses may, however, help to explain the
lack of widespread support for proctoring as a solution to the
ills of academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
We have examined, described, and assessed a large amount
of data on Stanford students—their personal honesty, their
valuation of honesty, their experiences with and perceptions
of academic dishonesty among their fellow students, their
concern about cheating, their attitudes toward and know
ledge of the Honor Code, and their opinions about possible
modifications of the current system. What, after all this, can
we safely assert that we know?
First, and perhaps most important, is the conclusion that
Stanford does not currently have a "cheating problem";
those who have worried about a West Point level scandal may
sleep soundly, at least for a while. While cheating continues
to exist in academic endeavors, our data show that the
incidence of self-reported cheating among undergraduates is
approximately the same now as it was in 1961.
The increased selectivity exercised in undergraduate ad
missions may account in part for this lack of change;
although the pressures on students have certainly increased,
the student body includes fewer undergraduates who cannot
cope with the academic demands made of them
The picture is not entirely rosy, however. Indeed, it is
only a slight exaggeration to state that the low incidence of
cheating is independent of the current control system rather
than a result of it. Students are not knowledgeable about the
contents of the Honor Code, nor is the majority highly
committed to it. They similarly perceive their fellow students
and faculty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not
actually indifferent or opposed to it. The crux of the matter
is that the system is not seen to be working.
Students are both more aware of the cheating that does
exist, and less willing to report offenders (or ask them to
report themselves). Nor do they see faculty members filling
the activity gap as either police or advocates. (As our report
on the faculty surveys will state, this perception of the
faculty is essentially correct.)
There is no evidence that personal moral standards have
declined at Stanford, though the willingness to hold others to
universalistic standards seems to have declined substantially.
The 25% of our sample who do endorse the several
universalistic value statements in the questionnaire, and who
are substantially more willing to observe the reporting obliga
tion—these students are not, apparently, very visible or very
vocal among their fellow students. They do not have as much
experience with instances of cheating as the rest of the
sample; and, or course, it may be lack of experience which
permits them to predict that their hypothetical behavior
would differ from that of the majority.
We find no strong support for exam proctoring, even
among those subgroups most aware of and concerned about
levels of cheating.
The minority most exposed to cheating seem to favor
unilateral solutions, while the rest are more likely to reject
proctoring or prefer it as a faculty and/or student option. In
short, both the need to modify the current Honor Code, and
the appropriateness of alternative modifications continue to
be judgmental matters: our data provide no clear answers.
Our own interpretation—and it is merely that—is that
Stanford's Honor Code suffers primarily from invisibility
ignorance and apathy better describe our sample than dis
honesty and anxiety. While some modifications may be in
order (e.g., eliminating the reporting obligation, and per
mitting proctoring at studen' and/or instructor preference), it
is premature to consider abandoning the current system.
An educational program is needed, not simply on the
contents of the Code but also on topics like "What plagiarism
is and how to avoid it." (English and communication have
such a statement and some faculty members, at least, distri
bute copies to their students.)
People who throw out the baby with the bath water are
usually unaware that the baby is there; and until the
presence, characteristics, and value of the Honor Code are
widely known on campus, hasty action—like pulling the
plug—would be both unnecessary and undesirable.
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %
Do you consider yourself to be:
Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 52 46
Not well informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 35 44
The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66
Support it by their behavior? 75 68
Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:
% replying "Yes" to Undergrad Grad
1. "Padding" a few items on a biblio- 23 8

2. Copying a few sentences of material 35 13
without footnoting in a paper
3. Copying answers from a text or other 28 13

dently
4. Writing a paper for another student 3 3
5. Getting questions or answers from
someone who has already taken the same
exam 13 8
6. Giving answers to other students
during an exam 8 5
7. Arranging with other students to give
or receive answers by use of signals 1 0
8. Arranging to sit next to someone who
will let you copy from him during a test or
exam 4 0
9. Copying from someone's test or exam
paper without his knowing it 10 3
10. Taking an exam for another student 1 0

exam for you 0 0

Because the actions range from trivial to serious, and
these distributions count acts, not individuals, we construc
ted three indices of so-called cheating behavior. The first
index counts the number of respondents who checked at
least one item of the 1 7-item set shown above. The second
index is also a count, but excludes items 1-3 above. The third
index counts examination cheating only (items 5-10, 14-15).

"Serious" cheating (excludes 1-3) 45 27

Our respondent's perceptions of the amount of cheatiny
among their fellow students are most usefully viewed in the
context of their self-reports of cheating, a topic addressed in
Section 4, and in comparison with the 1961 data, discussed
in Section 3. Suffice it to say here that undergraduates
perceive substantially more cheating than do graduate stu
dents:

Respondents were asked to estimate, in percentage terms,
levels and types of cheating, levels of discovered cheating,
types of discipline imposed, etc. It is surprising, given their
differences in personal observation of cheating, that the
percentage estimates provided by graduates and undergradu
ates are quite similar. Some examples follow:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage have cheated since coming to Stanford."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-15%) 35% 53%
Medium estimate (16-50%) 51 38
High estimate (above 15
High estimate (above 50%) 14 10
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheat frequently."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 44% 43%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 44 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 13

"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage are discovered. "
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate <0-4% 43% 41%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 43 41

by the instructor."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-70%) 47% 42%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 34 34
High estimate (above 97%) 19 24
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for
cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 49% 41%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 47 41
High estimate (above 85%) 4 18
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for

of the cases action is taken by the instructor."

Our respondents were asked how they learned about most
of the cases of cheating and plagiarim that they know about.
The student grapevine predominates among undergraduates,
but not for graduates:
Undergrads Grads
Observing the instances yourself 19% 23%
Hearing about them from the offenders 8 4
Hearing about them from other students
on the grapevine 55 33
Hearing about them through official channels
(e.g.. The Daily, Dean's Office,
a faculty member, etc.) 18 40
We turn now to two questions which will be reexamined
from other angles in subsequent sections of this report.
Though not directly addressing Honor Code issues, they
indicate the amount of support for the "reporting obliga
tion"—that observers of cheating report the offenders. The
low support expressed is all the more striking because the
questions pose hypothetical situations:
Suppose you saw a student cheating. What would you do?
Undergrads Grads
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 5% (1) 10%
Ask him to report himself and report him
if he fails to do so 3 ( (3) 10
Express disapproval informally but not
report him 34 (68) 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 33 (5) 17
Ignore the incident 25 (23) 29
Graduates and undergraduates agree about how their
behavior would change were the offender "a close friend":
the undergraduate percentages are shown in parentheses
above. If the offender were "a campus leader," however,
reporting becomes somewhat more likely, increasing to 17%
for undergraduates and 28% for graduates.
The second hypothetical question shows only small differ
ences between graduates and undergraduates; the percentages
below are for the undergraduate respondents.
If someone asked you for help during a test or exam,
what would you do?
Undergrad %
Give him the answer 2
Say nothing but expose your paper so
he can copy the answer 2
Ignore or turn down his request 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 21
Report him to the appropriate authorities 2
If the person seeking help were a friend, the percentage
selecting the first or second option increases to 21%; re
actions to "a campus leader" or "someone you disliked
personally" are not substantially different from those shown
above for an unspecified person.
One question attempts to assess in a global sort of way
"the cheating problem":
"Do you believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty at Stanford poses a serious threat to the academic
process?"
Undergrad %
Yes, very serious 11
Moderately serious 32
Not very serious 55

Graduate student responses differ in that many more
appear in the No Opinion column; when preferences are
expressed, they are in the same direction as those shown
above for undergraduates.
Asked who should serve as exam proctors, class instruc
tors and graduate TAs—in that order—are overwhelmingly
preferred over students from outside the class. Similarly, the
majority of respondents think that students should not
participate in "identifying and selecting from a pool of
potential proctors":

Finally, students were asked what probable effects would
result from instituting exam proctoring. Below we show the
undergraduate responses; where graduate responses are sub
stantially different, they appear in parentheses.

Students would feel threatened by the lack

Students would feel protected from a

The incident of cheating in other areas would
increase (e.g., take-home exams, lab reports). 16
Students would no longer feel obliged to behave
honestly on examinations 12
We now turn, in the following sections, to more detailed
considerations of the results of our study, broadly and
briskly described above.
Section 2: The Role of Background Characteristics
It is a truism of social research that one can always find
background characteristics of respondents which correlate—at
impressive statistical levels—with the dependent variables
under scrutiny. This study is no exception.
Separately for graduates and undergraduates, we cross
tabulated a range of background characteristics with a long
but selective list of variables concerning values, perceptions,
and behaviors. We found many, many differences; undergrad
uate class, academic department, and—to a lesser extent
graduate school intentions, sex, and citizenship, all show
correlations with many of our value and behavior indicators.
In the interests of brevity, clarity, and progress, we have
selected from this mass of data in two ways: first, only those
findings of central policy interest to the SCLC are being
reported here; and second, only those patterns of relation
ships which are internally consistent will receive attention.
An example which meets the first criterion but fails the
second: Freshmen and sophomores are more likely to know
that the Honor Code prohibits proctoring, but less likely to
agree that the Honor Code "regulates faculty behavior." Both
relationships are statistically significant; viewed together,
however, they don't make sense and are better politely
dismissed than puzzled over (e.g., "It appears that undergrad
uate class is not systematically related to knowledge of
Honor Code contents.")
Tables showing the relationships described in this section
r,ro available in the appendices. Throughout what follows,
"sophomores" should be understood to include our four
token freshmen.
Undergraduate class relates in a variety of ways to several
key variables, especially perceptions of cheating. Honor Code
commitment, and attitudes toward proctoring. Sophomores
have seen less cheating and fewer instances of students
reporting others for cheating; they are, however, slightly
more likely to have seen instructors ignoring cheating behav
ior. Although their self-reported cheating varies only slightly
from that of upperclassmen, sophomores are more likely to
worry about false accusations of cheating.
Sophomores are especially likely to state that the Honor
Code system should be altered, and least likely to describe
themselves as believing strongly in the current system. They
favor the introduction of exam proctoring more than upper
classmen do, especially in classes with enrollments over 30,
and/or in required preprofessional classes.
Sophomores' attitudes and experiences extend to their
perceptions of other students and faculty: they are least
likely to think other students favor continuation of the
current Honor Code; while more likely to believe that faculty
know about the Honor Code and its requirements, they are
least likely to think faculty favor its continuation or support
it by their behavior.
Differences by undergraduate major are, by and large,
inconsistent and statistically small—few exceed 10%. There is
some tendency for respondents in social science departments
to see a world that is consistently slightly different from that
seen by others; the humanities, science, and engineering
students do not generally differ greatly from each other in
patterned or consistent ways.
Social science majors are distinctive in the following
respects: they report having seen more cheating, more often
been asked for help on exams, more often observed an
instructor ignoring cheating, knowing of more instances of
students reporting offenders, and more likely to think that
the current level of academic dishonesty poses a serious
threat to the educational process.
Their self-reports of cheating are high on three of the six
items where area of major shows a difference; unlike the
other disciplinary areas, they are low on no item. They do
not, however, conspicuously favor exam proctoring; indeed,
they are least willing to proctor "as a University obligation,"
though the percent willing doubles "if paid" (the other
disciplinary areas show a decrease in willingness if proctoring
were a paid job). While not especially in favor of any of the
proctoring options, social science majors are least likely to
believe that an effect of proctoring would be that "the Honor
Code would lose meaning."
Many of the areas in which social science majors differ
from our other undergraduate respondents also differentiate
between undergraduates with professional school versus grad
uate school intentions.
On all variables relating to knowledge of cheating, general
perceptions of the extent of cheating, and self-reported
cheating, either no differences appear or the profession
oriented students are higher—i.e., more aware of cheating and
higher rates of self-reported cheating.
On the Honor Code quiz, profession-oriented students are
less likely to know that exam proctoring is prohibited; later
questions show them to be more in favor of mandatory
proctoring, slightly more willing to proctor as an obligation,
and much more willing to proctor if paid to do so.
The two groups also differ in the results they would
expect from proctoring: graduate school-oriented students
believe that students would feel threatened, while the profes
sion-oriented think that "feeling protected" is a more likely
outcome.
Sex and ethnic background are generally unrewarding
variables in this study. Two self-reported cheating items, both
referring to copying from another's paper during an exam,
show women less likely—by 10% or more—to cheat in this
fashion.
Women are more likely to consider themselves "not well
informed" about the Honor Code, though their quiz scores
are no worse than the men's. Mandatory proctoring receives
more support from women; other proctoring options, how
ever, are not conspicuously supported by one sex or the
other. Favorable effects of proctoring—e.g., that students
would feel protected—are cited more frequently by women;
men are more likely to respond that an Honor Code would
lose meaning and/or that a meaningful Honor Code would
cease to exist.
The ethnic background tables include both graduates and
undergraduates in order to obtain a statistically comfortable
number of "non-Caucasian" respondents (black, chicano,
Spanish surname, native American, Asian American, or

"other"). The ethnic conglomerate may be meaningless; but,
in any case, being "non-Caucasian" does not relate consis
tently or significantly to any of the behavioral or attitudinal
variables in our study.
Background Variables and the Graduate Sample
The obvious and occasionally interesting differences dis
cussed with respect to our undergraduate respondents are
not, in general, evident among the graduate respondents in
our sample. There are not as many cases, and two areas
(Earth Sciences and H & S Humanities) include too few cases
to allow attention to comparative percentages.
The reader may remember from Section 1 that experience
with and awareness of academic dishonesty is signfficantly
lower among Stanford's graduate student population. One
result of this difference is that is is less rewarding—indeed
discouragint—to examine departmental or other background
variables with respect to the respondent's own cheating or
awareness of it: there are simply too few cases to yield
dependable percentages. Thus we have a reduced set of
variables to examine; however—to the extent that any disci
plinary area stands out as consistently different from the
other two—it is, at the graduate level, that of H & S science
and math students.
Not many variables, even with the reduced set, show
disciplinary differences. Those that do tend to be those
discussed both earlier and later in this report—those items
with respect to which, for a variety of reasons, our sample
respondents seem to differ. On these variables, shown in
tabular form in the appendices, graduate students in H & S
science and math departments come through as personally
moral pessimists.
The differences are neither wholly consistent nor statis
tically awesome, but it appears that the science/math sub
group is more likely to endorse the broadly-stated values of
honesty, to not worry much personally about cheating, and
to cheat less; to perceive less Honor Code support and
knowledge among fellow-students and faculty; and to not
favor the proctoring remedy, anticipating several ill effects.
With flags of caution waving wildly, we close this section
with a few comments about the graduate student population
who are not U.S. citizens. It is a small group (only 18
respondents), and hence the need for caution. The differ
ences in responses between citizens and noncitizens, however,
are surprisingly consistent over a range of variables—unlike
our results with the "non-Caucasian" background variable.
To summarize the tables which appear in the appendices,
value statements which citizens tend to endorse (e.g. "Most
students want to be honest."), noncitizens indicate "Not
Sure"; others which citizens tend to disagree with (e.g.,
"Reporting someone for cheating is worse than cheating"),
noncitizens tend to endorse. They express less commitment
to the Honor Code and perceive less support among other
students. They are less supportive of (or less opinionated
about) various proctoring options, less willing to serve as
proctors, and likely to expect more negative results to follow
the introduction of proctoring. These several areas of differ
ence are not always statistically large, but the fact that
differences consistently appear is deserving of some atten
tion.
Section 3: Some Comparisons Between 1961 and 1976
Before discussing the results of our comparisons over
time, it is appropriate to restate some of the differences
between the studies which restrict the ease with which our
comparisons may safely lead to firm conclusions:
1) The 1961 results are based on only 75 undergraduates,
a 75% response rate from the sample;
2) The 1961 study was nationwide, sponsored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and covered many topics related to
social control processes, whereas our study is internally
sponsored and relatively narrow in scope; and
3) The representation of freshmen in the 1961 survey
was proportional to their population size, which is not true
of 1976 freshmen.
On the positive side, the questions we chose to repeat are
identical in wording and response categories to the 1961
versions; also, background items for which we have other
sources of trend data—e.g., sex, age, grade average, ethnic
background, and type of campus housing—show changes very
similar to those in the questionnaire responses.
We will discuss several interesting comparisons in this
section; attention will focus first, however, on four findings
of special interest to the SCLC.
First, contrary to prevailing opinion, our data show no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976.
Second, current students are more likely to have actually
seen instances of cheating, and to perceive-in a general
way—that more cheating exists, than was true of their
predecessors.
Third, there is a notable drop in expressed support for
value statements concerning honesty, especially those with a
universal tone—e.g., "Under no circumstances is cheating ever
justified."
Fourth, support for the reporting aspect of the Honor
Code has indeed declined; in 1961, about one-quarter of the
sample would, m a hypothetical cheating situation, report the

offender or ask that he report himself—compared to less than
10% who say they would do so in 1976.
Self-Reports of Academic Dishonesty
The fo;lowing self-reports were solicited in 1961 and
1976 with the results shown in the two columns to the right:
Check all the following which you have done at Stanford.
% responding "Yes"
1961 1976
"Padding" a few items on a bibliography 20% 23%
Copying a few sentences of material without
footnoting in a paper 35 35
Copying answers from a text or other source instead
of doing the work independently 32 28
Writing a paper for another student 3 3
Getting questions or answers from someone who has
already taken the same exam 8 13
Giving answers to other students during an exam 7 8
Arranging with other students to give or receive
answers by use of signals 0 1
Arranging to sit next to someone who will let you

his knowing about it 16 10
Taking an exam for another student 0 1
Having another student take an exam for you 0 0
Working on the same homework with several students
when the teacher does not allow it 16 12
Another set of questions allowed five responses ranging
from "Never" to "Many times"; so few persons, in either
year, selected the fourth or fifth categories, that we show
below only the predominent response categories.

The lack of change shown above is worth notice; where
there are changes—in either direction—they are too small to
warrant serious attention. It is, we believe, a safe conclusion
that self-reported acts of cheating are unchanged between
1961 and 1976. (We should point out that in Bowers' 1961
data, the Stanford level of cheating was found to be very low
in a nation-wide context. Even on those questions which
show an increase between 1961 and 1976, the current
Stanford percent is below the nationwide 1961 sample
percent.)
PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIC
DISHONESTY
Here we see some substantial differences. In both years,
students were asked, "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], have you seen another student cheating during a
test or exam?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 76% 49% Once 12% 9% A few 7% 29%
times
'61 '76 '61 *76

times
A similar question: "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], has another student indicated to you during a
test or exam that he wanted help?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 88% 78% Once 8% 8% A few
times 3% 11%
Several Many
times 1% 2% times 0% 1%
It seems indisputable that current students are more likely
to have personally witnessed cheating activity. Regardless of
their own experience, they also hold different perceptions of
the extent of academic dishonesty and the functioning of
disciplinary processes. Students in both years were asked to
estimate, in percentage terms, the frequency of the following
events:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage has cheated since coming to Stanford."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-15%) 42% 35%
Medium estimate (16-60%) 37 51
High estimate (above 60%) 21 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheats frequently."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 43% 44%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 45 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 12
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage is discovered."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-4%) 27% 43%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 50 43
High estimate (above 15%) 23 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage is discovered
by the course instructor."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-70%) 32% 47%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 68 34
High estimate (above 97%) 0 19
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarized and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage are reported by
other students."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-10%) 66% 44%
Medium estimate (11-65%) 23 42
High estimate (above 65%) 11 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage report them
selves. "
1961 1976
Low estimate (0%) 59% 69%
Medium estimate (1-10%) 28 26
High estimate (above 10%) 13 6
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 90% 49%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 9 47
High estimate (above 85%) 1 4
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases disciplinary action is taken by the course
instructor.
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-35%) 48% 39%
Medium estimate (36-90%) 40 52
High estimate (above 90%) 12 9
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases the case is passed on to some other authority
for disciplinary action."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-5%) 19% 32%
Medium estimate (6-50%) 39 56
High estimate (above 50%) 42 11
Comparing percentage distributions of percentage esti
mates can be quite confusing. Some differences, however,
come through quite clearly: 1961 respondents estimated a
higher "discovery rate" for cheaters, expected more disco
veries to be made by faculty, and substantially more cheating
cases being passed to authorities beyond the classroom. In
neither year did many students perceive a high level of
self-reporting ("0%" the majority estimate—chosen by 59% in
1961 and 69% currently).
These indicated trends in the percentage estimates are
confirmed by another set of responses elsewhere in the
questionnaire:

Unfortunately, our 1961 data are in the form of com
puter print-out rather than IBM cards, so we are unable to
examine the relationships between these value endorsements
and other variables of obvious interest—like self-reports of
cheating. As we will discuss later in Section 4, 1976 respon
dents who agree strongly with some of these statements are
conspicuously different from their fellow-students in several
other ways as well.
RESPONSES TO HYPOTHETICAL CHEATING SITUA
TIONS
Earlier we examined responses about cheating actually
observed; here we inquire what our responses would do if
they observed cheating.
"Suppose you saw a student cheating on a test or exam.
What would you do?"
1961 1976
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 4% 5%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 22 3
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 36 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 14 33
Ignore the incident 2525
In both years, one-quarter of the students in this hypothe
tical situation would ignore the incident. Also in both years,
the modal choice is to express disapproval but not to report
the offender.
The big change is in the second most popular form of
social control-in 1961, it is to ask the person to report
himself and report him if he doesn't do so, and in 1976 it is
to mention the incident to others but not report it.

"How often have the following things happened that you
knowabout?"

As before, the areas of large change are in perceived
self-reporting and faculty alertness and activity, student
reporting of others is seen to be only slightly less frequent
now.
Student views of faculty are tapped in yet another way,
with consistent differences over time again evident.

Before considering behaviors and perceptions more di
rectly related to the Honor Code, we'll look briefly at some
value statements put to both undergraduate samples.
VALUES ABOUT HONESTY
Here we see some of the largest differences of any found
so far in our several analyses. There can be little doubt that
the changes in the "Agree Strongly" column below, especial
ly for the first two statements, constitute real differences
between our two samples.
Agree Agree Not Disagree Disagree
strongly mildly sure mildly strongly

Reporting someone for cheating
is worse than cheating 3 4 10 7 12 19 38 31 38 38

It may seem surprising that only 26% of the 1961 sample
supported the reporting obligation of the Honor Code; but
other responses show that students also perceived some
student support for reporting in 1961—the combination of
general perception plus 26% commitment may well have
resulted in a social control system that effectively reduced
academic dishonesty.
Another hypothetical situation was posed:
1961 1976
Give him the answer 0% 2%
Say nothing but expose your paper
so he can copy the answer 4 2
Ignore or turn down his request 59 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 32 21
Report him to the appropriate
authorities 5 2
Two categories show 10-15% differences; ignoring or
rejecting such a request is a more popular option now, and
expressing disapproval informally is less popular. Neither
sample views reporting the request with much favor.
Both hypothetical situations were elaborated by changing
the identity of the cheater from an unspecified individual to
"a campus leader" and "a close friend"; the second situation
added a third, "some you disliked personally." In both years,
a friend observed cheating is less likely to be reported and
more likely to be informally disapproved of; campus leaders
>n both years are more severely treated than others—27% of
the 1961 sample, and 17% in 1976, would report him, and
only about 20% would ignore the incident.
For the solicited exam aid situation, our two samples are
similar with the following exceptions; whereas currently 21%
would cooperate with a friend's request, only 7% thought
they would do so in 1961; both samples are more likely to
express disapproval to a friend than to the other specified
offenders, 42% selecting this treatment of a friend in 1961,
and 30% in 1976. For neither sample is reporting a likely
option—even for campus leaders in 1961, the figure is only
7%.
This concludes our review of trend findings of key
interest to the SCLC. We have restricted our interpretive
comments to the analytic variety, indicating which differ
ences seemed, to us, worth serious attention.
Another level of interpretation, however, is needed with
respect to one blatant anomaly: How is it that individual
self-reported cheating is unchanged, but current students
report seeing more cheating than their predecessors? One
possible interpretation is simply that cheating is more conspi
cuous when it does occur; that the change in moral climate,
suggested by the value endorsement data, has both allowed
current cheaters to be more open in their activities and
opened more widely the eyes and ears of noncheaters. To the
extent that our 1976 data permit, we will examine these
possibilities in Section 4. Our aim here is to draw attention to
the phenomenon and encourage speculation.
1961 AND 1976 VIEWS ON THE PURPOSES OF A COL
LEGE EDUCATION
Several questions on the Bowers questionnaire, while not
related to the SCLC task, were so potentially interesting to
repeat 15 years later that we easily yielded to the temptation.
Students were asked to consider a list of purposes of a college
education, to indicate the importance of each purpose to the
respondent, and then to select that purpose considered most
important to the respondent.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Most
Important Purpose
1961 1976
gg Provide a basic general education and
appreciation of ideas
Provide vocational training; develop
skills and techniques directly
applicable to my career
Develop my ability to get along with
different kinds of people
Develop my knowledge and interest in the
® ® community and world problems
Help develop my moral capacities, ethical
® standards and values
Prepare me for a happy marriage
® and family life
Looking at these comparisons, it is hard to believe that 15
turbulent years have passed since the first survey. With two
exceptions, the differences are smaller than pollsters ex
pected to find over a one-week time span! Amidst such
constancy, the two shifts stand out sharply: Current students
attribute somewhat less importance to acquiring knowledge
about world problems (though the change is not large); and
our sample virtually rejects preparation for marriage as an
important purpose of college—in 1961, 53% assigned some
importance to this purpose, compared with 28% today.
With some trepidation, we also repeated the question,
"How well satisfied are you with your educational experience
at Stanford [at this school] ?"
1961 1976
Very well satisfied 38% 24%
Fairly well satisfied 55 63
Not very well satisfied 7 13
Not at all satisfied 0 0
The drop in the top category, while not huge, is big
enough to qualify as real. We did not inquire into reasons for
the respondents' level of satisfaction (nor did Bowers), and
thus cannot help those wishing to interpret or evaluate the
significance of this change.
Section 4: A Closer Look at Self-Reported Cheating
While we know more now about the state of academic
honesty at Stanford than we did prior to the survey, we still
should look closer at the correlates of self-reported cheating
activity.
Our data do not allow us to assign causality and statis
tically test alternative explanations of cheating behavior; we
can, however, change tactics from preceding sections and
focus on different levels of cheating—seeking related variables
that are potentially manipulable, be it by policy or informal
effort.
We make frequent use in this section of the three
"cheating indices" introd - "~ed in Section 1: Cheating Index,
"Serious" Cheating, and Exam Cheating. By cross-tabulating
each index with a wide range of variables, we looked for
differences between the three indices (e.g.. Are those who
admit to serious cheating different from those who admit to

what one SCLC member labeled "dilettante cheating"?), as
well as for differences between self-confessed cheaters of
whatever stripe and noncheaters.
First, we examine the hypothesis that noncheaters are
better informed about the contents of the Honor Code than
are those who cheat. We created a Knowledge Index based on
the quiz-type questions, high scores going to those with a
higher proportion of right answers. Cross-tabulating the
Knowledge Index with each cheating index produced no
difference worth reporting. It appears that our respondents
who cheat know neither more nor less about the Honor Code
than their contemporaries who don't cheat.
Perceived cheating is, not surprisingly, positively related
to self-reported cheating; the indices work similarly, but the
relationship shows most clearly in the example below:
"Since you have been at Stanford, have you seen another
student cheating during a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Never 61% 54% 29%
Once 9 8 9
A few times 23 27 39
Several times 5 7 11
Many times 2 3 12
Very Fairly Not very
Important Important Important

55 41 40 46 4 13
26 29 47 45 27 26
10 4 43 24 47 72
The biggest difference is between those who are high on
our index (N=s6), versus those who are medium or low. This
pattern reappears in response to the question, "What would
you do if you saw someone cheating on a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 9% 4% 4%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 5 4 0
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 42 37 23
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 28 29 39
Ignore the incident 16 25 34
Similarly, those who admit to having cheated are more
likely to have been asked for help during a test or exam; in
response to such a request, they are more likely to aid the
person or ignore the incident (versus reporting or expressing
disapproval).
Strong differences appear when the cheating index is
cross-tabulated with the three universalistic value statements
(again, all three cheating indices work similarly). The follow
ing table examplifies the differences found with respect to
the other value statements as well.
"Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified."
Cheating Index Score Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 74% 40% 26%
Agree mildly 23 14
Not sure 5 19 24
Disagree mildly 9 27
Disagree strongly 14 9

The differences seen above are substantially reduced when
respondents are asked to indicate their agreement with the
statement: "Honesty is desirable, but currently impossible at
Stanford."
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 10% 8% 11%
Agree mildly 12 16 24
Not sure 21 12 14
Disagree mildly 16 21 22
Disagree strongly 41 43 29
We also find no large differences with respect to level of
commitment to the current Honor Code, or to the serious
ness of the current level of academic dishonesty at Stanford.
There is a modest tendency for noncheaters to prefer proc
toring, but the differences are neither consistently related to
level of self-reported cheating nor larger than about 10%.
With respect to background variables, seniors tend to
appear in the medium and high categories on our scales (52%
of the "highs" are seniors). There is a discernable but
undramatic tendency for social science majors to be high,
engineering and science majors medium, and humanities low.
There is a similar consistent, modest tendency for students
with professional school plans to score higher on our indices
than those planning to attend graduate school.
A final small correlation that is packed with interpretative
potential: Noncheaters are more likely to be "very satisfied"
with their educational experiences at Stanford than respon
dents scoring medium or high (% "very satisfied," 33%, 24%,
and 18% respectively).
Since our largest unexpected differences, both here and in
the 1961 comparisons, have involved three value statements,
we decided to look more closely at our respondents' value
endorsements. We created an index called Strong Values, ana
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each respondent according
to how many times he indicated strong agreement with these
statements:
1) Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified.
2) Students are morally obligated not to cheat.
3) Cheating directly contradicts the goals of education.
Our population split very neatly into the four categories,
about 25% in each.
Our subsequent cross-tabulations yielded interesting re
sults, which we will first summarize, and then examine some
details. Respondents with high scores on our Strong Values
index are much less aware of, involved in, and opinionated
about all matters related to cheating at Stanford. Their
responses to hypothetical cheating situations are very likely
to include expressing disapproval, even to friends (similar to
the 1961 response for the whole sample).
They learn about cheating primarily from official
channels, and about the Honor Code from signing blue
books. They are more likely to indicate strong belief in the
Honor Code, and to believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty constitutes a moderate or serious problem They
do not, however, hold consistently different perceptions of
fellow students or faculty with respect to Honor Code
support, nor are their opinions about specific aspects of the
Honor Code different from their fellow respondents. They
are not conspicuously either for or against proctoring; on
these and other questions soliciting opinions about hypothe
tical effects or the attitudes of others, they are more likely to
check "not sure."
They are, in sum, an interesting, not easily comprehen
sible, group of people—slightly more likely to be female and
majoring in the humanities, unlikely to be seniors, and more
likely to be very satisfied with their educational experience at
Stanford.
The tables that follow show the most impressive of the
differences discussed above. Other tables referred to but not

Another section of the questionnaire elicited many speci
fic course characteristics of courses taken winter quarter by
our respondents. Among other things, they were asked about
the extent and types of cheating that occurred in the two
winter courses they liked best, and the one liked least.
Each single cheating item received too few mentions to be
useful to us, so we grouped together all mentions of any type
or level of cheating for the course liked best and created an
index, and similarly for the course liked least. Only 17
nonzero scores are on the first index (mentions of cheating
instances), and 36 on the course-liked-least index. The index
items are:
Respondent personally knew about or learned about. . . .
* Any other students cheating on the final exam, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on tests other than the
final, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on homework or lab
assignments, and/or;
* At least half the other students cheating at one or
another time during the course.
We were interested in learning what types of courses were
likely settings for cheating; by cross-tabulating the other
course characteristics against the index scores, we identified
several characteristics differentiating courses with observed
cheating from other courses.
Those courses liked best in which cheating occurred were
likely to be introductory, have more than 30 students
enrolled, and have short-answer exams (versus open-book,
essay, or take-homes). Past tests were likely to be available
for study purposes, seating was staggered during exams, and
either a TA or the instructor was likely to remain in the room
during exams.
Those observing cheating are likely to be high on our
cheating indices, which supports our earlier conclusion that
those who observe cheating are themselves more likely to
cheat. The course-least-liked index tables show similar results.
On the whole, we suspect that the attempt in this section
to understand better students who cheat and settings con
ducive to cheating events has produced results more useful to
the student of social deviance than to the concerned policy
evaluator.
The characteristics most obviously related to self-reported
cheating are value stances of a special, universalistic sort—a

trait probably not nurtured during the undergraduate years,
or seniors would not be conspicuously absent from the group
of high scorers on our values index.
With respect to the finding that those who cheat are much
more likely to observe other cheating, our data don't allow us
to establish the order of the relationship—i.e., does own
cheating heighten awareness and thus perceptions of others'
cheating, or does one begin cheating in response to observing
it? Probably both processes occur, but we cannot disentangle
them.
One main policy modification, the introduction of op
tional or mandatory proctoring of exams, is not strongly or
consistently favored by our population of noncheaters, nor
by the overlapping subgroup of those high on our values
index. Proctoring already exists in some classes, and our
respondents are more likely to report instances of cheating in
courses with proctored exams.
That does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that
proctoring is ineffective; that students do see cheating in
proctored exam courses may, however, help to explain the
lack of widespread support for proctoring as a solution to the
ills of academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
We have examined, described, and assessed a large amount
of data on Stanford students—their personal honesty, their
valuation of honesty, their experiences with and perceptions
of academic dishonesty among their fellow students, their
concern about cheating, their attitudes toward and know
ledge of the Honor Code, and their opinions about possible
modifications of the current system. What, after all this, can
we safely assert that we know?
First, and perhaps most important, is the conclusion that
Stanford does not currently have a "cheating problem";
those who have worried about a West Point level scandal may
sleep soundly, at least for a while. While cheating continues
to exist in academic endeavors, our data show that the
incidence of self-reported cheating among undergraduates is
approximately the same now as it was in 1961.
The increased selectivity exercised in undergraduate ad
missions may account in part for this lack of change;
although the pressures on students have certainly increased,
the student body includes fewer undergraduates who cannot
cope with the academic demands made of them
The picture is not entirely rosy, however. Indeed, it is
only a slight exaggeration to state that the low incidence of
cheating is independent of the current control system rather
than a result of it. Students are not knowledgeable about the
contents of the Honor Code, nor is the majority highly
committed to it. They similarly perceive their fellow students
and faculty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not
actually indifferent or opposed to it. The crux of the matter
is that the system is not seen to be working.
Students are both more aware of the cheating that does
exist, and less willing to report offenders (or ask them to
report themselves). Nor do they see faculty members filling
the activity gap as either police or advocates. (As our report
on the faculty surveys will state, this perception of the
faculty is essentially correct.)
There is no evidence that personal moral standards have
declined at Stanford, though the willingness to hold others to
universalistic standards seems to have declined substantially.
The 25% of our sample who do endorse the several
universalistic value statements in the questionnaire, and who
are substantially more willing to observe the reporting obliga
tion—these students are not, apparently, very visible or very
vocal among their fellow students. They do not have as much
experience with instances of cheating as the rest of the
sample; and, or course, it may be lack of experience which
permits them to predict that their hypothetical behavior
would differ from that of the majority.
We find no strong support for exam proctoring, even
among those subgroups most aware of and concerned about
levels of cheating.
The minority most exposed to cheating seem to favor
unilateral solutions, while the rest are more likely to reject
proctoring or prefer it as a faculty and/or student option. In
short, both the need to modify the current Honor Code, and
the appropriateness of alternative modifications continue to
be judgmental matters: our data provide no clear answers.
Our own interpretation—and it is merely that—is that
Stanford's Honor Code suffers primarily from invisibility
ignorance and apathy better describe our sample than dis
honesty and anxiety. While some modifications may be in
order (e.g., eliminating the reporting obligation, and per
mitting proctoring at studen' and/or instructor preference), it
is premature to consider abandoning the current system.
An educational program is needed, not simply on the
contents of the Code but also on topics like "What plagiarism
is and how to avoid it." (English and communication have
such a statement and some faculty members, at least, distri
bute copies to their students.)
People who throw out the baby with the bath water are
usually unaware that the baby is there; and until the
presence, characteristics, and value of the Honor Code are
widely known on campus, hasty action—like pulling the
plug—would be both unnecessary and undesirable.
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %
Do you consider yourself to be:
Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 52 46
Not well informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 35 44
The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66
Support it by their behavior? 75 68
Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:
% replying "Yes" to Undergrad Grad
1. "Padding" a few items on a biblio- 23 8

2. Copying a few sentences of material 35 13
without footnoting in a paper
3. Copying answers from a text or other 28 13
source instead of doing the work indepen
dently
4. Writing a paper for another student 3 3
5. Getting questions or answers from
someone who has already taken the same
exam 13 8
6. Giving answers to other students
during an exam 8 5
7. Arranging with other students to give
or receive answers by use of signals 1 0
8. Arranging to sit next to someone who
will let you copy from him during a test or
exam 4 0
9. Copying from someone's test or exam
paper without his knowing it 10 3
10. Taking an exam for another student 1 0
11. Having another student take an
exam for you 0 0
12. Working on the same homework

not allow it 12 12

Because the actions range from trivial to serious, and
these distributions count acts, not individuals, we construc
ted three indices of so-called cheating behavior. The first
index counts the number of respondents who checked at
least one item of the 1 7-item set shown above. The second
index is also a count, but excludes items 1-3 above. The third
index counts examination cheating only (items 5-10, 14-15).

Our respondent's perceptions of the amount of cheatiny
among their fellow students are most usefully viewed in the
context of their self-reports of cheating, a topic addressed in
Section 4, and in comparison with the 1961 data, discussed
in Section 3. Suffice it to say here that undergraduates
perceive substantially more cheating than do graduate stu
dents:

Respondents were asked to estimate, in percentage terms,
levels and types of cheating, levels of discovered cheating,
types of discipline imposed, etc. It is surprising, given their
differences in personal observation of cheating, that the
percentage estimates provided by graduates and undergradu
ates are quite similar. Some examples follow:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage have cheated since coming to Stanford."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-15%) 35% 53%
Medium estimate (16-50%) 51 38
High estimate (above 15
High estimate (above 50%) 14 10
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate

"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage are discovered. "
Undergrad Grad

by the instructor."

cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percentage
of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
Undergrad Grad
Low estimate (0-20%) 49% 41%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 47 41
High estimate (above 85%) 4 18
"Of those students brought to the attention of faculty for

of the cases action is taken by the instructor."

Our respondents were asked how they learned about most
of the cases of cheating and plagiarim that they know about.
The student grapevine predominates among undergraduates,
but not for graduates:
Undergrads Grads
Observing the instances yourself 19% 23%
Hearing about them from the offenders 8 4
Hearing about them from other students
on the grapevine 55 33
Hearing about them through official channels
(e.g.. The Daily, Dean's Office,
a faculty member, etc.) 18 40
We turn now to two questions which will be reexamined
from other angles in subsequent sections of this report.
Though not directly addressing Honor Code issues, they
indicate the amount of support for the "reporting obliga
tion"—that observers of cheating report the offenders. The
low support expressed is all the more striking because the
questions pose hypothetical situations:
Suppose you saw a student cheating. What would you do?
Undergrads Grads
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 5% (1) 10%
Ask him to report himself and report him
if he fails to do so 3 ( (3) 10
Express disapproval informally but not
report him 34 (68) 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 33 (5) 17
Ignore the incident 25 (23) 29
Graduates and undergraduates agree about how their
behavior would change were the offender "a close friend":
the undergraduate percentages are shown in parentheses
above. If the offender were "a campus leader," however,
reporting becomes somewhat more likely, increasing to 17%
for undergraduates and 28% for graduates.
The second hypothetical question shows only small differ
ences between graduates and undergraduates; the percentages
below are for the undergraduate respondents.
If someone asked you for help during a test or exam,
what would you do?
Undergrad %
Give him the answer 2
Say nothing but expose your paper so
he can copy the answer 2
Ignore or turn down his request 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 21
Report him to the appropriate authorities 2
If the person seeking help were a friend, the percentage
selecting the first or second option increases to 21%; re
actions to "a campus leader" or "someone you disliked
personally" are not substantially different from those shown
above for an unspecified person.
One question attempts to assess in a global sort of way
"the cheating problem":
"Do you believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty at Stanford poses a serious threat to the academic
process?"
Undergrad %
Yes, very serious 11
Moderately serious 32
Not very serious 55

Graduate student responses differ in that many more

expressed, they are in the same direction as those shown
above for undergraduates.
Asked who should serve as exam proctors, class instruc
tors and graduate TAs—in that order—are overwhelmingly
preferred over students from outside the class. Similarly, the
majority of respondents think that students should not
participate in "identifying and selecting from a pool of
potential proctors":
Undergrad %
No 51
Yes, should participate 45
Yes, should be completely responsible
for the selection process 3
Most students would either definitely or possibly serve as
proctors if asked, especially graduate students:
"If you were called upon to proctor an examination,
would you do it?"
No Maybe Yes
If it were considered a University
obligation Undergrad 28% 31% 41%
Grad 16 28 56
If paid Undergrad 33% 27% 39%
Grad 26 32 41
Finally, students were asked what probable effects would
result from instituting exam proctoring. Below we show the
undergraduate responses; where graduate responses are sub
stantially different, they appear in parentheses.
The incidence of cheating on examinations
would be reduced. 71%
Students would no longer feel obliged to report
the dishonesty of others on examinations 67 (50)
An Honor Code would lose meaning 58 (43)
A meaningful Honor Code would cease to exist 47 (26)
Students would feel threatened by the lack
of trust 44 ( 32)
Students would feel protected from a
minority of dishonest students 43
The incident of cheating in other areas would
increase (e.g., take-home exams, lab reports). 16
Students would no longer feel obliged to behave
honestly on examinations 12
We now turn, in the following sections, to more detailed
considerations of the results of our study, broadly and
briskly described above.
Section 2: The Role of Background Characteristics
It is a truism of social research that one can always find
background characteristics of respondents which correlate—at
impressive statistical levels—with the dependent variables
under scrutiny. This study is no exception.
Separately for graduates and undergraduates, we cross
tabulated a range of background characteristics with a long
but selective list of variables concerning values, perceptions,
and behaviors. We found many, many differences; undergrad
uate class, academic department, and—to a lesser extent
graduate school intentions, sex, and citizenship, all show
correlations with many of our value and behavior indicators.
In the interests of brevity, clarity, and progress, we have
selected from this mass of data in two ways: first, only those
findings of central policy interest to the SCLC are being
reported here; and second, only those patterns of relation
ships which are internally consistent will receive attention.
An example which meets the first criterion but fails the
second: Freshmen and sophomores are more likely to know
that the Honor Code prohibits proctoring, but less likely to
agree that the Honor Code "regulates faculty behavior." Both
relationships are statistically significant; viewed together,
however, they don't make sense and are better politely
dismissed than puzzled over (e.g., "It appears that undergrad
uate class is not systematically related to knowledge of
Honor Code contents.")
Tables showing the relationships described in this section
r,ro available in the appendices. Throughout what follows,
"sophomores" should be understood to include our four
token freshmen.
Undergraduate class relates in a variety of ways to several
key variables, especially perceptions of cheating. Honor Code
commitment, and attitudes toward proctoring. Sophomores
have seen less cheating and fewer instances of students
reporting others for cheating; they are, however, slightly
more likely to have seen instructors ignoring cheating behav
ior. Although their self-reported cheating varies only slightly
from that of upperclassmen, sophomores are more likely to
worry about false accusations of cheating.
Sophomores are especially likely to state that the Honor
Code system should be altered, and least likely to describe
themselves as believing strongly in the current system. They
favor the introduction of exam proctoring more than upper
classmen do, especially in classes with enrollments over 30,
and/or in required preprofessional classes.
Sophomores' attitudes and experiences extend to their
perceptions of other students and faculty: they are least
likely to think other students favor continuation of the
current Honor Code; while more likely to believe that faculty
know about the Honor Code and its requirements, they are
least likely to think faculty favor its continuation or support
it by their behavior.
Differences by undergraduate major are, by and large,
inconsistent and statistically small—few exceed 10%. There is
some tendency for respondents in social science departments
to see a world that is consistently slightly different from that
seen by others; the humanities, science, and engineering
students do not generally differ greatly from each other in
patterned or consistent ways.
Social science majors are distinctive in the following
respects: they report having seen more cheating, more often
been asked for help on exams, more often observed an
instructor ignoring cheating, knowing of more instances of
students reporting offenders, and more likely to think that
the current level of academic dishonesty poses a serious
threat to the educational process.
Their self-reports of cheating are high on three of the six
items where area of major shows a difference; unlike the
other disciplinary areas, they are low on no item. They do
not, however, conspicuously favor exam proctoring; indeed,
they are least willing to proctor "as a University obligation,"
though the percent willing doubles "if paid" (the other
disciplinary areas show a decrease in willingness if proctoring
were a paid job). While not especially in favor of any of the
proctoring options, social science majors are least likely to
believe that an effect of proctoring would be that "the Honor
Code would lose meaning."
Many of the areas in which social science majors differ
from our other undergraduate respondents also differentiate
between undergraduates with professional school versus grad
uate school intentions.
On all variables relating to knowledge of cheating, general
perceptions of the extent of cheating, and self-reported
cheating, either no differences appear or the profession
oriented students are higher—i.e., more aware of cheating and
higher rates of self-reported cheating.
On the Honor Code quiz, profession-oriented students are
less likely to know that exam proctoring is prohibited; later
questions show them to be more in favor of mandatory
proctoring, slightly more willing to proctor as an obligation,
and much more willing to proctor if paid to do so.
The two groups also differ in the results they would
expect from proctoring: graduate school-oriented students
believe that students would feel threatened, while the profes
sion-oriented think that "feeling protected" is a more likely
outcome.
Sex and ethnic background are generally unrewarding
variables in this study. Two self-reported cheating items, both
referring to copying from another's paper during an exam,
show women less likely—by 10% or more—to cheat in this
fashion.
Women are more likely to consider themselves "not well
informed" about the Honor Code, though their quiz scores
are no worse than the men's. Mandatory proctoring receives
more support from women; other proctoring options, how
ever, are not conspicuously supported by one sex or the
other. Favorable effects of proctoring—e.g., that students
would feel protected—are cited more frequently by women;
men are more likely to respond that an Honor Code would
lose meaning and/or that a meaningful Honor Code would
cease to exist.
The ethnic background tables include both graduates and
undergraduates in order to obtain a statistically comfortable
number of "non-Caucasian" respondents (black, chicano,
Spanish surname, native American, Asian American, or

"other"). The ethnic conglomerate may be meaningless; but,
in any case, being "non-Caucasian" does not relate consis
tently or significantly to any of the behavioral or attitudinal
variables in our study.
Background Variables and the Graduate Sample
The obvious and occasionally interesting differences dis
cussed with respect to our undergraduate respondents are
not, in general, evident among the graduate respondents in
our sample. There are not as many cases, and two areas
(Earth Sciences and H & S Humanities) include too few cases
to allow attention to comparative percentages.
The reader may remember from Section 1 that experience
with and awareness of academic dishonesty is signfficantly
lower among Stanford's graduate student population. One
result of this difference is that is is less rewarding—indeed
discouragint—to examine departmental or other background
variables with respect to the respondent's own cheating or
awareness of it: there are simply too few cases to yield
dependable percentages. Thus we have a reduced set of
variables to examine; however—to the extent that any disci
plinary area stands out as consistently different from the
other two—it is, at the graduate level, that of H & S science
and math students.
Not many variables, even with the reduced set, show
disciplinary differences. Those that do tend to be those
discussed both earlier and later in this report—those items
with respect to which, for a variety of reasons, our sample
respondents seem to differ. On these variables, shown in
tabular form in the appendices, graduate students in H & S
science and math departments come through as personally
moral pessimists.
The differences are neither wholly consistent nor statis
tically awesome, but it appears that the science/math sub
group is more likely to endorse the broadly-stated values of
honesty, to not worry much personally about cheating, and
to cheat less; to perceive less Honor Code support and
knowledge among fellow-students and faculty; and to not
favor the proctoring remedy, anticipating several ill effects.
With flags of caution waving wildly, we close this section
with a few comments about the graduate student population
who are not U.S. citizens. It is a small group (only 18
respondents), and hence the need for caution. The differ
ences in responses between citizens and noncitizens, however,
are surprisingly consistent over a range of variables—unlike
our results with the "non-Caucasian" background variable.
To summarize the tables which appear in the appendices,
value statements which citizens tend to endorse (e.g. "Most
students want to be honest."), noncitizens indicate "Not
Sure"; others which citizens tend to disagree with (e.g.,
"Reporting someone for cheating is worse than cheating"),
noncitizens tend to endorse. They express less commitment
to the Honor Code and perceive less support among other
students. They are less supportive of (or less opinionated
about) various proctoring options, less willing to serve as
proctors, and likely to expect more negative results to follow
the introduction of proctoring. These several areas of differ
ence are not always statistically large, but the fact that
differences consistently appear is deserving of some atten
tion.
Section 3: Some Comparisons Between 1961 and 1976
Before discussing the results of our comparisons over
time, it is appropriate to restate some of the differences
between the studies which restrict the ease with which our
comparisons may safely lead to firm conclusions:
1) The 1961 results are based on only 75 undergraduates,
a 75% response rate from the sample;
2) The 1961 study was nationwide, sponsored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and covered many topics related to
social control processes, whereas our study is internally
sponsored and relatively narrow in scope; and
3) The representation of freshmen in the 1961 survey
was proportional to their population size, which is not true
of 1976 freshmen.
On the positive side, the questions we chose to repeat are
identical in wording and response categories to the 1961
versions; also, background items for which we have other
sources of trend data—e.g., sex, age, grade average, ethnic
background, and type of campus housing—show changes very
similar to those in the questionnaire responses.
We will discuss several interesting comparisons in this
section; attention will focus first, however, on four findings
of special interest to the SCLC.
First, contrary to prevailing opinion, our data show no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976.
Second, current students are more likely to have actually
seen instances of cheating, and to perceive-in a general
way—that more cheating exists, than was true of their
predecessors.
Third, there is a notable drop in expressed support for
value statements concerning honesty, especially those with a
universal tone—e.g., "Under no circumstances is cheating ever
justified."
Fourth, support for the reporting aspect of the Honor
Code has indeed declined; in 1961, about one-quarter of the
sample would, m a hypothetical cheating situation, report the

offender or ask that he report himself—compared to less than
10% who say they would do so in 1976.
Self-Reports of Academic Dishonesty
The fo;lowing self-reports were solicited in 1961 and
1976 with the results shown in the two columns to the right:
Check all the following which you have done at Stanford.
% responding "Yes"
1961 1976
"Padding" a few items on a bibliography 20% 23%
Copying a few sentences of material without
footnoting in a paper 35 35

of doing the work independently 32 28
Writing a paper for another student 3 3
Getting questions or answers from someone who has
already taken the same exam 8 13
Giving answers to other students during an exam 7 8
Arranging with other students to give or receive

his knowing about it 16 10

Having another student take an exam for you 0 0

Another set of questions allowed five responses ranging
from "Never" to "Many times"; so few persons, in either
year, selected the fourth or fifth categories, that we show
below only the predominent response categories.

The lack of change shown above is worth notice; where
there are changes—in either direction—they are too small to
warrant serious attention. It is, we believe, a safe conclusion
that self-reported acts of cheating are unchanged between
1961 and 1976. (We should point out that in Bowers' 1961
data, the Stanford level of cheating was found to be very low
in a nation-wide context. Even on those questions which
show an increase between 1961 and 1976, the current
Stanford percent is below the nationwide 1961 sample
percent.)
PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIC
DISHONESTY
Here we see some substantial differences. In both years,
students were asked, "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], have you seen another student cheating during a
test or exam?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 76% 49% Once 12% 9% A few 7% 29%
times
'61 '76 '61 *76
Several

times
A similar question: "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], has another student indicated to you during a
test or exam that he wanted help?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 88% 78% Once 8% 8% A few
times 3% 11%
Several Many
times 1% 2% times 0% 1%
It seems indisputable that current students are more likely
to have personally witnessed cheating activity. Regardless of
their own experience, they also hold different perceptions of
the extent of academic dishonesty and the functioning of
disciplinary processes. Students in both years were asked to
estimate, in percentage terms, the frequency of the following
events:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage has cheated since coming to Stanford."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-15%) 42% 35%
Medium estimate (16-60%) 37 51
High estimate (above 60%) 21 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheats frequently."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 43% 44%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 45 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 12
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage is discovered."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-4%) 27% 43%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 50 43
High estimate (above 15%) 23 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage is discovered
by the course instructor."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-70%) 32% 47%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 68 34
High estimate (above 97%) 0 19
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarized and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage are reported by
other students."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-10%) 66% 44%
Medium estimate (11-65%) 23 42
High estimate (above 65%) 11 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage report them
selves. "
1961 1976
Low estimate (0%) 59% 69%
Medium estimate (1-10%) 28 26
High estimate (above 10%) 13 6
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 90% 49%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 9 47
High estimate (above 85%) 1 4
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases disciplinary action is taken by the course
instructor.
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-35%) 48% 39%
Medium estimate (36-90%) 40 52
High estimate (above 90%) 12 9
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases the case is passed on to some other authority
for disciplinary action."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-5%) 19% 32%
Medium estimate (6-50%) 39 56
High estimate (above 50%) 42 11
Comparing percentage distributions of percentage esti
mates can be quite confusing. Some differences, however,
come through quite clearly: 1961 respondents estimated a
higher "discovery rate" for cheaters, expected more disco
veries to be made by faculty, and substantially more cheating
cases being passed to authorities beyond the classroom. In
neither year did many students perceive a high level of
self-reporting ("0%" the majority estimate—chosen by 59% in
1961 and 69% currently).
These indicated trends in the percentage estimates are
confirmed by another set of responses elsewhere in the
questionnaire:

Unfortunately, our 1961 data are in the form of com
puter print-out rather than IBM cards, so we are unable to
examine the relationships between these value endorsements
and other variables of obvious interest—like self-reports of
cheating. As we will discuss later in Section 4, 1976 respon
dents who agree strongly with some of these statements are
conspicuously different from their fellow-students in several
other ways as well.
RESPONSES TO HYPOTHETICAL CHEATING SITUA
TIONS
Earlier we examined responses about cheating actually
observed; here we inquire what our responses would do if
they observed cheating.
"Suppose you saw a student cheating on a test or exam.
What would you do?"
1961 1976
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 4% 5%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 22 3
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 36 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 14 33
Ignore the incident 2525
In both years, one-quarter of the students in this hypothe
tical situation would ignore the incident. Also in both years,
the modal choice is to express disapproval but not to report
the offender.
The big change is in the second most popular form of
social control-in 1961, it is to ask the person to report
himself and report him if he doesn't do so, and in 1976 it is
to mention the incident to others but not report it.

"How often have the following things happened that you
knowabout?"

As before, the areas of large change are in perceived
self-reporting and faculty alertness and activity, student
reporting of others is seen to be only slightly less frequent
now.
Student views of faculty are tapped in yet another way,
with consistent differences over time again evident.

Before considering behaviors and perceptions more di
rectly related to the Honor Code, we'll look briefly at some
value statements put to both undergraduate samples.
VALUES ABOUT HONESTY
Here we see some of the largest differences of any found
so far in our several analyses. There can be little doubt that
the changes in the "Agree Strongly" column below, especial
ly for the first two statements, constitute real differences
between our two samples.
Agree Agree Not Disagree Disagree

Reporting someone for cheating
is worse than cheating 3 4 10 7 12 19 38 31 38 38

It may seem surprising that only 26% of the 1961 sample
supported the reporting obligation of the Honor Code; but
other responses show that students also perceived some
student support for reporting in 1961—the combination of
general perception plus 26% commitment may well have
resulted in a social control system that effectively reduced
academic dishonesty.
Another hypothetical situation was posed:
1961 1976
Give him the answer 0% 2%
Say nothing but expose your paper
so he can copy the answer 4 2
Ignore or turn down his request 59 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 32 21
Report him to the appropriate
authorities 5 2
Two categories show 10-15% differences; ignoring or
rejecting such a request is a more popular option now, and
expressing disapproval informally is less popular. Neither
sample views reporting the request with much favor.
Both hypothetical situations were elaborated by changing
the identity of the cheater from an unspecified individual to
"a campus leader" and "a close friend"; the second situation
added a third, "some you disliked personally." In both years,
a friend observed cheating is less likely to be reported and
more likely to be informally disapproved of; campus leaders
>n both years are more severely treated than others—27% of
the 1961 sample, and 17% in 1976, would report him, and
only about 20% would ignore the incident.
For the solicited exam aid situation, our two samples are
similar with the following exceptions; whereas currently 21%
would cooperate with a friend's request, only 7% thought
they would do so in 1961; both samples are more likely to
express disapproval to a friend than to the other specified
offenders, 42% selecting this treatment of a friend in 1961,
and 30% in 1976. For neither sample is reporting a likely
option—even for campus leaders in 1961, the figure is only
7%.
This concludes our review of trend findings of key
interest to the SCLC. We have restricted our interpretive
comments to the analytic variety, indicating which differ
ences seemed, to us, worth serious attention.
Another level of interpretation, however, is needed with
respect to one blatant anomaly: How is it that individual
self-reported cheating is unchanged, but current students
report seeing more cheating than their predecessors? One
possible interpretation is simply that cheating is more conspi
cuous when it does occur; that the change in moral climate,
suggested by the value endorsement data, has both allowed
current cheaters to be more open in their activities and
opened more widely the eyes and ears of noncheaters. To the
extent that our 1976 data permit, we will examine these
possibilities in Section 4. Our aim here is to draw attention to
the phenomenon and encourage speculation.
1961 AND 1976 VIEWS ON THE PURPOSES OF A COL
LEGE EDUCATION
Several questions on the Bowers questionnaire, while not
related to the SCLC task, were so potentially interesting to
repeat 15 years later that we easily yielded to the temptation.
Students were asked to consider a list of purposes of a college
education, to indicate the importance of each purpose to the
respondent, and then to select that purpose considered most
important to the respondent.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Most
Important Purpose
1961 1976
gg Provide a basic general education and
appreciation of ideas
Provide vocational training; develop
skills and techniques directly
applicable to my career
Develop my ability to get along with
different kinds of people
Develop my knowledge and interest in the
® ® community and world problems
Help develop my moral capacities, ethical
® standards and values
Prepare me for a happy marriage
® and family life
Looking at these comparisons, it is hard to believe that 15
turbulent years have passed since the first survey. With two
exceptions, the differences are smaller than pollsters ex
pected to find over a one-week time span! Amidst such
constancy, the two shifts stand out sharply: Current students
attribute somewhat less importance to acquiring knowledge
about world problems (though the change is not large); and
our sample virtually rejects preparation for marriage as an
important purpose of college—in 1961, 53% assigned some
importance to this purpose, compared with 28% today.
With some trepidation, we also repeated the question,
"How well satisfied are you with your educational experience
at Stanford [at this school] ?"
1961 1976
Very well satisfied 38% 24%
Fairly well satisfied 55 63
Not very well satisfied 7 13
Not at all satisfied 0 0
The drop in the top category, while not huge, is big
enough to qualify as real. We did not inquire into reasons for
the respondents' level of satisfaction (nor did Bowers), and
thus cannot help those wishing to interpret or evaluate the
significance of this change.
Section 4: A Closer Look at Self-Reported Cheating
While we know more now about the state of academic
honesty at Stanford than we did prior to the survey, we still
should look closer at the correlates of self-reported cheating
activity.
Our data do not allow us to assign causality and statis
tically test alternative explanations of cheating behavior; we
can, however, change tactics from preceding sections and
focus on different levels of cheating—seeking related variables
that are potentially manipulable, be it by policy or informal
effort.
We make frequent use in this section of the three
"cheating indices" introd - "~ed in Section 1: Cheating Index,
"Serious" Cheating, and Exam Cheating. By cross-tabulating
each index with a wide range of variables, we looked for
differences between the three indices (e.g.. Are those who
admit to serious cheating different from those who admit to

what one SCLC member labeled "dilettante cheating"?), as
well as for differences between self-confessed cheaters of
whatever stripe and noncheaters.
First, we examine the hypothesis that noncheaters are
better informed about the contents of the Honor Code than
are those who cheat. We created a Knowledge Index based on
the quiz-type questions, high scores going to those with a
higher proportion of right answers. Cross-tabulating the
Knowledge Index with each cheating index produced no
difference worth reporting. It appears that our respondents
who cheat know neither more nor less about the Honor Code
than their contemporaries who don't cheat.
Perceived cheating is, not surprisingly, positively related
to self-reported cheating; the indices work similarly, but the
relationship shows most clearly in the example below:
"Since you have been at Stanford, have you seen another
student cheating during a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Never 61% 54% 29%
Once 9 8 9
A few times 23 27 39
Several times 5 7 11
Many times 2 3 12

The biggest difference is between those who are high on
our index (N=s6), versus those who are medium or low. This
pattern reappears in response to the question, "What would
you do if you saw someone cheating on a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 9% 4% 4%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 5 4 0
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 42 37 23
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 28 29 39
Ignore the incident 16 25 34
Similarly, those who admit to having cheated are more
likely to have been asked for help during a test or exam; in
response to such a request, they are more likely to aid the
person or ignore the incident (versus reporting or expressing
disapproval).
Strong differences appear when the cheating index is
cross-tabulated with the three universalistic value statements
(again, all three cheating indices work similarly). The follow
ing table examplifies the differences found with respect to
the other value statements as well.
"Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified."

The differences seen above are substantially reduced when
respondents are asked to indicate their agreement with the
statement: "Honesty is desirable, but currently impossible at
Stanford."
Cheating Index Score

Agree strongly 10% 8% 11%
Agree mildly 12 16 24

We also find no large differences with respect to level of
commitment to the current Honor Code, or to the serious
ness of the current level of academic dishonesty at Stanford.
There is a modest tendency for noncheaters to prefer proc
toring, but the differences are neither consistently related to
level of self-reported cheating nor larger than about 10%.
With respect to background variables, seniors tend to
appear in the medium and high categories on our scales (52%
of the "highs" are seniors). There is a discernable but
undramatic tendency for social science majors to be high,
engineering and science majors medium, and humanities low.
There is a similar consistent, modest tendency for students
with professional school plans to score higher on our indices
than those planning to attend graduate school.
A final small correlation that is packed with interpretative
potential: Noncheaters are more likely to be "very satisfied"
with their educational experiences at Stanford than respon
dents scoring medium or high (% "very satisfied," 33%, 24%,
and 18% respectively).
Since our largest unexpected differences, both here and in
the 1961 comparisons, have involved three value statements,
we decided to look more closely at our respondents' value
endorsements. We created an index called Strong Values, ana
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each respondent according
to how many times he indicated strong agreement with these
statements:
1) Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified.
2) Students are morally obligated not to cheat.
3) Cheating directly contradicts the goals of education.
Our population split very neatly into the four categories,
about 25% in each.
Our subsequent cross-tabulations yielded interesting re
sults, which we will first summarize, and then examine some
details. Respondents with high scores on our Strong Values
index are much less aware of, involved in, and opinionated
about all matters related to cheating at Stanford. Their
responses to hypothetical cheating situations are very likely
to include expressing disapproval, even to friends (similar to
the 1961 response for the whole sample).
They learn about cheating primarily from official
channels, and about the Honor Code from signing blue
books. They are more likely to indicate strong belief in the
Honor Code, and to believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty constitutes a moderate or serious problem They
do not, however, hold consistently different perceptions of
fellow students or faculty with respect to Honor Code
support, nor are their opinions about specific aspects of the
Honor Code different from their fellow respondents. They
are not conspicuously either for or against proctoring; on
these and other questions soliciting opinions about hypothe
tical effects or the attitudes of others, they are more likely to
check "not sure."
They are, in sum, an interesting, not easily comprehen
sible, group of people—slightly more likely to be female and
majoring in the humanities, unlikely to be seniors, and more
likely to be very satisfied with their educational experience at
Stanford.
The tables that follow show the most impressive of the
differences discussed above. Other tables referred to but not
presented below are in the appendices.

Another section of the questionnaire elicited many speci
fic course characteristics of courses taken winter quarter by
our respondents. Among other things, they were asked about
the extent and types of cheating that occurred in the two
winter courses they liked best, and the one liked least.
Each single cheating item received too few mentions to be
useful to us, so we grouped together all mentions of any type
or level of cheating for the course liked best and created an
index, and similarly for the course liked least. Only 17
nonzero scores are on the first index (mentions of cheating
instances), and 36 on the course-liked-least index. The index
items are:
Respondent personally knew about or learned about. . . .
* Any other students cheating on the final exam, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on tests other than the
final, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on homework or lab
assignments, and/or;
* At least half the other students cheating at one or
another time during the course.
We were interested in learning what types of courses were
likely settings for cheating; by cross-tabulating the other
course characteristics against the index scores, we identified
several characteristics differentiating courses with observed
cheating from other courses.
Those courses liked best in which cheating occurred were
likely to be introductory, have more than 30 students
enrolled, and have short-answer exams (versus open-book,
essay, or take-homes). Past tests were likely to be available
for study purposes, seating was staggered during exams, and
either a TA or the instructor was likely to remain in the room
during exams.
Those observing cheating are likely to be high on our
cheating indices, which supports our earlier conclusion that
those who observe cheating are themselves more likely to
cheat. The course-least-liked index tables show similar results.
On the whole, we suspect that the attempt in this section
to understand better students who cheat and settings con
ducive to cheating events has produced results more useful to
the student of social deviance than to the concerned policy
evaluator.
The characteristics most obviously related to self-reported
cheating are value stances of a special, universalistic sort—a

trait probably not nurtured during the undergraduate years,
or seniors would not be conspicuously absent from the group
of high scorers on our values index.
With respect to the finding that those who cheat are much
more likely to observe other cheating, our data don't allow us
to establish the order of the relationship—i.e., does own
cheating heighten awareness and thus perceptions of others'
cheating, or does one begin cheating in response to observing
it? Probably both processes occur, but we cannot disentangle
them.
One main policy modification, the introduction of op
tional or mandatory proctoring of exams, is not strongly or
consistently favored by our population of noncheaters, nor
by the overlapping subgroup of those high on our values
index. Proctoring already exists in some classes, and our
respondents are more likely to report instances of cheating in
courses with proctored exams.
That does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that
proctoring is ineffective; that students do see cheating in
proctored exam courses may, however, help to explain the
lack of widespread support for proctoring as a solution to the
ills of academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
We have examined, described, and assessed a large amount
of data on Stanford students—their personal honesty, their
valuation of honesty, their experiences with and perceptions
of academic dishonesty among their fellow students, their
concern about cheating, their attitudes toward and know
ledge of the Honor Code, and their opinions about possible
modifications of the current system. What, after all this, can
we safely assert that we know?
First, and perhaps most important, is the conclusion that
Stanford does not currently have a "cheating problem";
those who have worried about a West Point level scandal may
sleep soundly, at least for a while. While cheating continues
to exist in academic endeavors, our data show that the
incidence of self-reported cheating among undergraduates is
approximately the same now as it was in 1961.
The increased selectivity exercised in undergraduate ad
missions may account in part for this lack of change;
although the pressures on students have certainly increased,
the student body includes fewer undergraduates who cannot
cope with the academic demands made of them
The picture is not entirely rosy, however. Indeed, it is
only a slight exaggeration to state that the low incidence of
cheating is independent of the current control system rather
than a result of it. Students are not knowledgeable about the
contents of the Honor Code, nor is the majority highly
committed to it. They similarly perceive their fellow students
and faculty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not
actually indifferent or opposed to it. The crux of the matter
is that the system is not seen to be working.
Students are both more aware of the cheating that does
exist, and less willing to report offenders (or ask them to
report themselves). Nor do they see faculty members filling
the activity gap as either police or advocates. (As our report
on the faculty surveys will state, this perception of the
faculty is essentially correct.)
There is no evidence that personal moral standards have
declined at Stanford, though the willingness to hold others to
universalistic standards seems to have declined substantially.
The 25% of our sample who do endorse the several
universalistic value statements in the questionnaire, and who
are substantially more willing to observe the reporting obliga
tion—these students are not, apparently, very visible or very
vocal among their fellow students. They do not have as much
experience with instances of cheating as the rest of the
sample; and, or course, it may be lack of experience which
permits them to predict that their hypothetical behavior
would differ from that of the majority.
We find no strong support for exam proctoring, even
among those subgroups most aware of and concerned about
levels of cheating.
The minority most exposed to cheating seem to favor
unilateral solutions, while the rest are more likely to reject
proctoring or prefer it as a faculty and/or student option. In
short, both the need to modify the current Honor Code, and
the appropriateness of alternative modifications continue to
be judgmental matters: our data provide no clear answers.
Our own interpretation—and it is merely that—is that
Stanford's Honor Code suffers primarily from invisibility
ignorance and apathy better describe our sample than dis
honesty and anxiety. While some modifications may be in
order (e.g., eliminating the reporting obligation, and per
mitting proctoring at studen' and/or instructor preference), it
is premature to consider abandoning the current system.
An educational program is needed, not simply on the
contents of the Code but also on topics like "What plagiarism
is and how to avoid it." (English and communication have
such a statement and some faculty members, at least, distri
bute copies to their students.)
People who throw out the baby with the bath water are
usually unaware that the baby is there; and until the
presence, characteristics, and value of the Honor Code are
widely known on campus, hasty action—like pulling the
plug—would be both unnecessary and undesirable.
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %
Do you consider yourself to be:
Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 52 46
Not well informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 35 44
The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66
Support it by their behavior? 75 68
Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:
% replying "Yes" to Undergrad Grad
1. "Padding" a few items on a biblio- 23 8
graphy
2. Copying a few sentences of material 35 13
without footnoting in a paper
3. Copying answers from a text or other 28 13
source instead of doing the work indepen
dently
4. Writing a paper for another student 3 3
5. Getting questions or answers from
someone who has already taken the same
exam 13 8
6. Giving answers to other students
during an exam 8 5
7. Arranging with other students to give
or receive answers by use of signals 1 0
8. Arranging to sit next to someone who
will let you copy from him during a test or
exam 4 0
9. Copying from someone's test or exam
paper without his knowing it 10 3
10. Taking an exam for another student 1 0
11. Having another student take an
exam for you 0 0
12. Working on the same homework
with several students when the teacher does
not allow it 12 12

Because the actions range from trivial to serious, and
these distributions count acts, not individuals, we construc
ted three indices of so-called cheating behavior. The first
index counts the number of respondents who checked at
least one item of the 1 7-item set shown above. The second
index is also a count, but excludes items 1-3 above. The third
index counts examination cheating only (items 5-10, 14-15).

Our respondent's perceptions of the amount of cheatiny
among their fellow students are most usefully viewed in the
context of their self-reports of cheating, a topic addressed in
Section 4, and in comparison with the 1961 data, discussed
in Section 3. Suffice it to say here that undergraduates
perceive substantially more cheating than do graduate stu
dents:

Respondents were asked to estimate, in percentage terms,
levels and types of cheating, levels of discovered cheating,
types of discipline imposed, etc. It is surprising, given their
differences in personal observation of cheating, that the
percentage estimates provided by graduates and undergradu
ates are quite similar. Some examples follow:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage have cheated since coming to Stanford."

Our respondents were asked how they learned about most
of the cases of cheating and plagiarim that they know about.
The student grapevine predominates among undergraduates,
but not for graduates:
Undergrads Grads
Observing the instances yourself 19% 23%
Hearing about them from the offenders 8 4
Hearing about them from other students
on the grapevine 55 33
Hearing about them through official channels
(e.g.. The Daily, Dean's Office,
a faculty member, etc.) 18 40
We turn now to two questions which will be reexamined
from other angles in subsequent sections of this report.
Though not directly addressing Honor Code issues, they
indicate the amount of support for the "reporting obliga
tion"—that observers of cheating report the offenders. The
low support expressed is all the more striking because the
questions pose hypothetical situations:
Suppose you saw a student cheating. What would you do?
Undergrads Grads
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 5% (1) 10%
Ask him to report himself and report him
if he fails to do so 3 ( (3) 10
Express disapproval informally but not
report him 34 (68) 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 33 (5) 17
Ignore the incident 25 (23) 29
Graduates and undergraduates agree about how their
behavior would change were the offender "a close friend":
the undergraduate percentages are shown in parentheses
above. If the offender were "a campus leader," however,
reporting becomes somewhat more likely, increasing to 17%
for undergraduates and 28% for graduates.
The second hypothetical question shows only small differ
ences between graduates and undergraduates; the percentages
below are for the undergraduate respondents.
If someone asked you for help during a test or exam,
what would you do?
Undergrad %
Give him the answer 2
Say nothing but expose your paper so
he can copy the answer 2
Ignore or turn down his request 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 21
Report him to the appropriate authorities 2
If the person seeking help were a friend, the percentage
selecting the first or second option increases to 21%; re
actions to "a campus leader" or "someone you disliked
personally" are not substantially different from those shown
above for an unspecified person.
One question attempts to assess in a global sort of way
"the cheating problem":
"Do you believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty at Stanford poses a serious threat to the academic
process?"
Undergrad %
Yes, very serious 11
Moderately serious 32
Not very serious 55

Between one-fifth ana about half of the undergraduate
population support the introduction of examination proctor
ing, or allowing for proctoring as an option:

Graduate student responses differ in that many more
appear in the No Opinion column; when preferences are
expressed, they are in the same direction as those shown
above for undergraduates.
Asked who should serve as exam proctors, class instruc
tors and graduate TAs—in that order—are overwhelmingly
preferred over students from outside the class. Similarly, the
majority of respondents think that students should not
participate in "identifying and selecting from a pool of
potential proctors":

Finally, students were asked what probable effects would
result from instituting exam proctoring. Below we show the
undergraduate responses; where graduate responses are sub
stantially different, they appear in parentheses.
The incidence of cheating on examinations
would be reduced. 71%
Students would no longer feel obliged to report
the dishonesty of others on examinations 67 (50)
An Honor Code would lose meaning 58 (43)
A meaningful Honor Code would cease to exist 47 (26)
Students would feel threatened by the lack
of trust 44 ( 32)
Students would feel protected from a
minority of dishonest students 43
The incident of cheating in other areas would
increase (e.g., take-home exams, lab reports). 16
Students would no longer feel obliged to behave
honestly on examinations 12
We now turn, in the following sections, to more detailed
considerations of the results of our study, broadly and
briskly described above.
Section 2: The Role of Background Characteristics
It is a truism of social research that one can always find
background characteristics of respondents which correlate—at
impressive statistical levels—with the dependent variables
under scrutiny. This study is no exception.
Separately for graduates and undergraduates, we cross
tabulated a range of background characteristics with a long
but selective list of variables concerning values, perceptions,
and behaviors. We found many, many differences; undergrad
uate class, academic department, and—to a lesser extent
graduate school intentions, sex, and citizenship, all show
correlations with many of our value and behavior indicators.
In the interests of brevity, clarity, and progress, we have
selected from this mass of data in two ways: first, only those
findings of central policy interest to the SCLC are being
reported here; and second, only those patterns of relation
ships which are internally consistent will receive attention.
An example which meets the first criterion but fails the
second: Freshmen and sophomores are more likely to know
that the Honor Code prohibits proctoring, but less likely to
agree that the Honor Code "regulates faculty behavior." Both
relationships are statistically significant; viewed together,
however, they don't make sense and are better politely
dismissed than puzzled over (e.g., "It appears that undergrad
uate class is not systematically related to knowledge of
Honor Code contents.")
Tables showing the relationships described in this section
r,ro available in the appendices. Throughout what follows,
"sophomores" should be understood to include our four
token freshmen.
Undergraduate class relates in a variety of ways to several
key variables, especially perceptions of cheating. Honor Code
commitment, and attitudes toward proctoring. Sophomores
have seen less cheating and fewer instances of students
reporting others for cheating; they are, however, slightly
more likely to have seen instructors ignoring cheating behav
ior. Although their self-reported cheating varies only slightly
from that of upperclassmen, sophomores are more likely to
worry about false accusations of cheating.
Sophomores are especially likely to state that the Honor
Code system should be altered, and least likely to describe
themselves as believing strongly in the current system. They
favor the introduction of exam proctoring more than upper
classmen do, especially in classes with enrollments over 30,
and/or in required preprofessional classes.
Sophomores' attitudes and experiences extend to their
perceptions of other students and faculty: they are least
likely to think other students favor continuation of the
current Honor Code; while more likely to believe that faculty
know about the Honor Code and its requirements, they are
least likely to think faculty favor its continuation or support
it by their behavior.
Differences by undergraduate major are, by and large,
inconsistent and statistically small—few exceed 10%. There is
some tendency for respondents in social science departments
to see a world that is consistently slightly different from that
seen by others; the humanities, science, and engineering
students do not generally differ greatly from each other in
patterned or consistent ways.
Social science majors are distinctive in the following
respects: they report having seen more cheating, more often
been asked for help on exams, more often observed an
instructor ignoring cheating, knowing of more instances of
students reporting offenders, and more likely to think that
the current level of academic dishonesty poses a serious
threat to the educational process.
Their self-reports of cheating are high on three of the six
items where area of major shows a difference; unlike the
other disciplinary areas, they are low on no item. They do
not, however, conspicuously favor exam proctoring; indeed,
they are least willing to proctor "as a University obligation,"
though the percent willing doubles "if paid" (the other
disciplinary areas show a decrease in willingness if proctoring
were a paid job). While not especially in favor of any of the
proctoring options, social science majors are least likely to
believe that an effect of proctoring would be that "the Honor
Code would lose meaning."
Many of the areas in which social science majors differ
from our other undergraduate respondents also differentiate
between undergraduates with professional school versus grad
uate school intentions.
On all variables relating to knowledge of cheating, general
perceptions of the extent of cheating, and self-reported
cheating, either no differences appear or the profession
oriented students are higher—i.e., more aware of cheating and
higher rates of self-reported cheating.
On the Honor Code quiz, profession-oriented students are
less likely to know that exam proctoring is prohibited; later
questions show them to be more in favor of mandatory
proctoring, slightly more willing to proctor as an obligation,
and much more willing to proctor if paid to do so.
The two groups also differ in the results they would
expect from proctoring: graduate school-oriented students
believe that students would feel threatened, while the profes
sion-oriented think that "feeling protected" is a more likely
outcome.
Sex and ethnic background are generally unrewarding
variables in this study. Two self-reported cheating items, both
referring to copying from another's paper during an exam,
show women less likely—by 10% or more—to cheat in this
fashion.
Women are more likely to consider themselves "not well
informed" about the Honor Code, though their quiz scores
are no worse than the men's. Mandatory proctoring receives
more support from women; other proctoring options, how
ever, are not conspicuously supported by one sex or the
other. Favorable effects of proctoring—e.g., that students
would feel protected—are cited more frequently by women;
men are more likely to respond that an Honor Code would
lose meaning and/or that a meaningful Honor Code would
cease to exist.
The ethnic background tables include both graduates and
undergraduates in order to obtain a statistically comfortable
number of "non-Caucasian" respondents (black, chicano,
Spanish surname, native American, Asian American, or

"other"). The ethnic conglomerate may be meaningless; but,
in any case, being "non-Caucasian" does not relate consis
tently or significantly to any of the behavioral or attitudinal
variables in our study.
Background Variables and the Graduate Sample
The obvious and occasionally interesting differences dis
cussed with respect to our undergraduate respondents are
not, in general, evident among the graduate respondents in
our sample. There are not as many cases, and two areas
(Earth Sciences and H & S Humanities) include too few cases
to allow attention to comparative percentages.
The reader may remember from Section 1 that experience
with and awareness of academic dishonesty is signfficantly
lower among Stanford's graduate student population. One
result of this difference is that is is less rewarding—indeed
discouragint—to examine departmental or other background
variables with respect to the respondent's own cheating or
awareness of it: there are simply too few cases to yield
dependable percentages. Thus we have a reduced set of
variables to examine; however—to the extent that any disci
plinary area stands out as consistently different from the
other two—it is, at the graduate level, that of H & S science
and math students.
Not many variables, even with the reduced set, show
disciplinary differences. Those that do tend to be those
discussed both earlier and later in this report—those items
with respect to which, for a variety of reasons, our sample
respondents seem to differ. On these variables, shown in
tabular form in the appendices, graduate students in H & S
science and math departments come through as personally
moral pessimists.
The differences are neither wholly consistent nor statis
tically awesome, but it appears that the science/math sub
group is more likely to endorse the broadly-stated values of
honesty, to not worry much personally about cheating, and
to cheat less; to perceive less Honor Code support and
knowledge among fellow-students and faculty; and to not
favor the proctoring remedy, anticipating several ill effects.
With flags of caution waving wildly, we close this section
with a few comments about the graduate student population
who are not U.S. citizens. It is a small group (only 18
respondents), and hence the need for caution. The differ
ences in responses between citizens and noncitizens, however,
are surprisingly consistent over a range of variables—unlike
our results with the "non-Caucasian" background variable.
To summarize the tables which appear in the appendices,
value statements which citizens tend to endorse (e.g. "Most
students want to be honest."), noncitizens indicate "Not
Sure"; others which citizens tend to disagree with (e.g.,
"Reporting someone for cheating is worse than cheating"),
noncitizens tend to endorse. They express less commitment
to the Honor Code and perceive less support among other
students. They are less supportive of (or less opinionated
about) various proctoring options, less willing to serve as
proctors, and likely to expect more negative results to follow
the introduction of proctoring. These several areas of differ
ence are not always statistically large, but the fact that
differences consistently appear is deserving of some atten
tion.
Section 3: Some Comparisons Between 1961 and 1976
Before discussing the results of our comparisons over
time, it is appropriate to restate some of the differences
between the studies which restrict the ease with which our
comparisons may safely lead to firm conclusions:
1) The 1961 results are based on only 75 undergraduates,
a 75% response rate from the sample;
2) The 1961 study was nationwide, sponsored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and covered many topics related to
social control processes, whereas our study is internally
sponsored and relatively narrow in scope; and
3) The representation of freshmen in the 1961 survey
was proportional to their population size, which is not true
of 1976 freshmen.
On the positive side, the questions we chose to repeat are
identical in wording and response categories to the 1961
versions; also, background items for which we have other
sources of trend data—e.g., sex, age, grade average, ethnic
background, and type of campus housing—show changes very
similar to those in the questionnaire responses.
We will discuss several interesting comparisons in this
section; attention will focus first, however, on four findings
of special interest to the SCLC.
First, contrary to prevailing opinion, our data show no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976.
Second, current students are more likely to have actually
seen instances of cheating, and to perceive-in a general
way—that more cheating exists, than was true of their
predecessors.
Third, there is a notable drop in expressed support for
value statements concerning honesty, especially those with a
universal tone—e.g., "Under no circumstances is cheating ever
justified."
Fourth, support for the reporting aspect of the Honor
Code has indeed declined; in 1961, about one-quarter of the
sample would, m a hypothetical cheating situation, report the

offender or ask that he report himself—compared to less than
10% who say they would do so in 1976.
Self-Reports of Academic Dishonesty
The fo;lowing self-reports were solicited in 1961 and
1976 with the results shown in the two columns to the right:
Check all the following which you have done at Stanford.
% responding "Yes"

"Padding" a few items on a bibliography 20% 23%

footnoting in a paper 35 35

Another set of questions allowed five responses ranging
from "Never" to "Many times"; so few persons, in either
year, selected the fourth or fifth categories, that we show
below only the predominent response categories.

The lack of change shown above is worth notice; where
there are changes—in either direction—they are too small to
warrant serious attention. It is, we believe, a safe conclusion
that self-reported acts of cheating are unchanged between
1961 and 1976. (We should point out that in Bowers' 1961
data, the Stanford level of cheating was found to be very low
in a nation-wide context. Even on those questions which
show an increase between 1961 and 1976, the current
Stanford percent is below the nationwide 1961 sample
percent.)
PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIC
DISHONESTY
Here we see some substantial differences. In both years,
students were asked, "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], have you seen another student cheating during a
test or exam?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 76% 49% Once 12% 9% A few 7% 29%
times
'61 '76 '61 *76

A similar question: "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], has another student indicated to you during a
test or exam that he wanted help?"

Never 88% 78% Once 8% 8% A few
times 3% 11%
Several Many
times 1% 2% times 0% 1%
It seems indisputable that current students are more likely
to have personally witnessed cheating activity. Regardless of
their own experience, they also hold different perceptions of
the extent of academic dishonesty and the functioning of
disciplinary processes. Students in both years were asked to
estimate, in percentage terms, the frequency of the following
events:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage has cheated since coming to Stanford."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-15%) 42% 35%
Medium estimate (16-60%) 37 51
High estimate (above 60%) 21 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage cheats frequently."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 43% 44%
Medium estimate (21-75%) 45 44
High estimate (above 75%) 12 12
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize, estimate
roughly what percentage is discovered."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-4%) 27% 43%
Medium estimate (5-15%) 50 43
High estimate (above 15%) 23 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage is discovered
by the course instructor."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-70%) 32% 47%
Medium estimate (71-97%) 68 34
High estimate (above 97%) 0 19
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarized and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage are reported by
other students."
1961 1976

Medium estimate (11-65%) 23 42
High estimate (above 65%) 11 14
"Of those students who cheat or plagiarize and are
discovered, estimate roughly what percentage report them
selves. "
1961 1976
Low estimate (0%) 59% 69%
Medium estimate (1-10%) 28 26
High estimate (above 10%) 13 6
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 90% 49%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 9 47
High estimate (above 85%) 1 4
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases disciplinary action is taken by the course
instructor.
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-35%) 48% 39%
Medium estimate (36-90%) 40 52
High estimate (above 90%) 12 9
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty
for cheating or plagiarism, estimate roughly in what percent
age of the cases the case is passed on to some other authority
for disciplinary action."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-5%) 19% 32%
Medium estimate (6-50%) 39 56
High estimate (above 50%) 42 11
Comparing percentage distributions of percentage esti
mates can be quite confusing. Some differences, however,
come through quite clearly: 1961 respondents estimated a
higher "discovery rate" for cheaters, expected more disco
veries to be made by faculty, and substantially more cheating
cases being passed to authorities beyond the classroom. In
neither year did many students perceive a high level of
self-reporting ("0%" the majority estimate—chosen by 59% in
1961 and 69% currently).
These indicated trends in the percentage estimates are
confirmed by another set of responses elsewhere in the
questionnaire:

Unfortunately, our 1961 data are in the form of com
puter print-out rather than IBM cards, so we are unable to
examine the relationships between these value endorsements
and other variables of obvious interest—like self-reports of
cheating. As we will discuss later in Section 4, 1976 respon
dents who agree strongly with some of these statements are
conspicuously different from their fellow-students in several
other ways as well.
RESPONSES TO HYPOTHETICAL CHEATING SITUA
TIONS
Earlier we examined responses about cheating actually
observed; here we inquire what our responses would do if
they observed cheating.
"Suppose you saw a student cheating on a test or exam.
What would you do?"
1961 1976
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 4% 5%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 22 3
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 36 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 14 33
Ignore the incident 2525
In both years, one-quarter of the students in this hypothe
tical situation would ignore the incident. Also in both years,
the modal choice is to express disapproval but not to report
the offender.
The big change is in the second most popular form of
social control-in 1961, it is to ask the person to report
himself and report him if he doesn't do so, and in 1976 it is
to mention the incident to others but not report it.

"How often have the following things happened that you
knowabout?"

As before, the areas of large change are in perceived
self-reporting and faculty alertness and activity, student
reporting of others is seen to be only slightly less frequent
now.
Student views of faculty are tapped in yet another way,
with consistent differences over time again evident.

Before considering behaviors and perceptions more di
rectly related to the Honor Code, we'll look briefly at some
value statements put to both undergraduate samples.
VALUES ABOUT HONESTY
Here we see some of the largest differences of any found
so far in our several analyses. There can be little doubt that
the changes in the "Agree Strongly" column below, especial
ly for the first two statements, constitute real differences
between our two samples.
Agree Agree Not Disagree Disagree

Reporting someone for cheating
is worse than cheating 3 4 10 7 12 19 38 31 38 38

It may seem surprising that only 26% of the 1961 sample
supported the reporting obligation of the Honor Code; but
other responses show that students also perceived some
student support for reporting in 1961—the combination of
general perception plus 26% commitment may well have
resulted in a social control system that effectively reduced
academic dishonesty.
Another hypothetical situation was posed:
1961 1976
Give him the answer 0% 2%
Say nothing but expose your paper
so he can copy the answer 4 2
Ignore or turn down his request 59 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 32 21
Report him to the appropriate
authorities 5 2
Two categories show 10-15% differences; ignoring or
rejecting such a request is a more popular option now, and
expressing disapproval informally is less popular. Neither
sample views reporting the request with much favor.
Both hypothetical situations were elaborated by changing
the identity of the cheater from an unspecified individual to
"a campus leader" and "a close friend"; the second situation
added a third, "some you disliked personally." In both years,
a friend observed cheating is less likely to be reported and
more likely to be informally disapproved of; campus leaders
>n both years are more severely treated than others—27% of
the 1961 sample, and 17% in 1976, would report him, and
only about 20% would ignore the incident.
For the solicited exam aid situation, our two samples are
similar with the following exceptions; whereas currently 21%
would cooperate with a friend's request, only 7% thought
they would do so in 1961; both samples are more likely to
express disapproval to a friend than to the other specified
offenders, 42% selecting this treatment of a friend in 1961,
and 30% in 1976. For neither sample is reporting a likely
option—even for campus leaders in 1961, the figure is only
7%.
This concludes our review of trend findings of key
interest to the SCLC. We have restricted our interpretive
comments to the analytic variety, indicating which differ
ences seemed, to us, worth serious attention.
Another level of interpretation, however, is needed with
respect to one blatant anomaly: How is it that individual
self-reported cheating is unchanged, but current students
report seeing more cheating than their predecessors? One
possible interpretation is simply that cheating is more conspi
cuous when it does occur; that the change in moral climate,
suggested by the value endorsement data, has both allowed
current cheaters to be more open in their activities and
opened more widely the eyes and ears of noncheaters. To the
extent that our 1976 data permit, we will examine these
possibilities in Section 4. Our aim here is to draw attention to
the phenomenon and encourage speculation.
1961 AND 1976 VIEWS ON THE PURPOSES OF A COL
LEGE EDUCATION
Several questions on the Bowers questionnaire, while not
related to the SCLC task, were so potentially interesting to
repeat 15 years later that we easily yielded to the temptation.
Students were asked to consider a list of purposes of a college
education, to indicate the importance of each purpose to the
respondent, and then to select that purpose considered most
important to the respondent.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Most
Important Purpose
1961 1976
gg Provide a basic general education and
appreciation of ideas
Provide vocational training; develop
skills and techniques directly
applicable to my career

® ® community and world problems

Looking at these comparisons, it is hard to believe that 15
turbulent years have passed since the first survey. With two
exceptions, the differences are smaller than pollsters ex
pected to find over a one-week time span! Amidst such
constancy, the two shifts stand out sharply: Current students
attribute somewhat less importance to acquiring knowledge
about world problems (though the change is not large); and
our sample virtually rejects preparation for marriage as an
important purpose of college—in 1961, 53% assigned some
importance to this purpose, compared with 28% today.
With some trepidation, we also repeated the question,
"How well satisfied are you with your educational experience
at Stanford [at this school] ?"
1961 1976
Very well satisfied 38% 24%
Fairly well satisfied 55 63
Not very well satisfied 7 13
Not at all satisfied 0 0
The drop in the top category, while not huge, is big
enough to qualify as real. We did not inquire into reasons for
the respondents' level of satisfaction (nor did Bowers), and
thus cannot help those wishing to interpret or evaluate the
significance of this change.
Section 4: A Closer Look at Self-Reported Cheating
While we know more now about the state of academic
honesty at Stanford than we did prior to the survey, we still
should look closer at the correlates of self-reported cheating
activity.
Our data do not allow us to assign causality and statis
tically test alternative explanations of cheating behavior; we
can, however, change tactics from preceding sections and
focus on different levels of cheating—seeking related variables
that are potentially manipulable, be it by policy or informal
effort.
We make frequent use in this section of the three
"cheating indices" introd - "~ed in Section 1: Cheating Index,
"Serious" Cheating, and Exam Cheating. By cross-tabulating
each index with a wide range of variables, we looked for
differences between the three indices (e.g.. Are those who
admit to serious cheating different from those who admit to

what one SCLC member labeled "dilettante cheating"?), as
well as for differences between self-confessed cheaters of
whatever stripe and noncheaters.
First, we examine the hypothesis that noncheaters are
better informed about the contents of the Honor Code than
are those who cheat. We created a Knowledge Index based on
the quiz-type questions, high scores going to those with a
higher proportion of right answers. Cross-tabulating the
Knowledge Index with each cheating index produced no
difference worth reporting. It appears that our respondents
who cheat know neither more nor less about the Honor Code
than their contemporaries who don't cheat.
Perceived cheating is, not surprisingly, positively related
to self-reported cheating; the indices work similarly, but the
relationship shows most clearly in the example below:
"Since you have been at Stanford, have you seen another
student cheating during a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Never 61% 54% 29%
Once 9 8 9
A few times 23 27 39
Several times 5 7 11
Many times 2 3 12
Very Fairly Not very
Important Important Important
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
% % %
93 85 7 13 0 2
32 36 47 44 22 20
53 54 40 36 7 10
55 41 40 46 4 13
26 29 47 45 27 26
10 4 43 24 47 72
The biggest difference is between those who are high on
our index (N=s6), versus those who are medium or low. This
pattern reappears in response to the question, "What would
you do if you saw someone cheating on a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 9% 4% 4%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 5 4 0
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 42 37 23
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 28 29 39
Ignore the incident 16 25 34
Similarly, those who admit to having cheated are more
likely to have been asked for help during a test or exam; in
response to such a request, they are more likely to aid the
person or ignore the incident (versus reporting or expressing
disapproval).
Strong differences appear when the cheating index is
cross-tabulated with the three universalistic value statements
(again, all three cheating indices work similarly). The follow
ing table examplifies the differences found with respect to
the other value statements as well.
"Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified."
Cheating Index Score Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 74% 40% 26%
Agree mildly 23 14
Not sure 5 19 24
Disagree mildly 9 27
Disagree strongly 14 9

The differences seen above are substantially reduced when
respondents are asked to indicate their agreement with the
statement: "Honesty is desirable, but currently impossible at
Stanford."
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 10% 8% 11%
Agree mildly 12 16 24
Not sure 21 12 14
Disagree mildly 16 21 22
Disagree strongly 41 43 29
We also find no large differences with respect to level of
commitment to the current Honor Code, or to the serious
ness of the current level of academic dishonesty at Stanford.
There is a modest tendency for noncheaters to prefer proc
toring, but the differences are neither consistently related to
level of self-reported cheating nor larger than about 10%.
With respect to background variables, seniors tend to
appear in the medium and high categories on our scales (52%
of the "highs" are seniors). There is a discernable but
undramatic tendency for social science majors to be high,
engineering and science majors medium, and humanities low.
There is a similar consistent, modest tendency for students
with professional school plans to score higher on our indices
than those planning to attend graduate school.
A final small correlation that is packed with interpretative
potential: Noncheaters are more likely to be "very satisfied"
with their educational experiences at Stanford than respon
dents scoring medium or high (% "very satisfied," 33%, 24%,
and 18% respectively).
Since our largest unexpected differences, both here and in
the 1961 comparisons, have involved three value statements,
we decided to look more closely at our respondents' value
endorsements. We created an index called Strong Values, ana
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each respondent according
to how many times he indicated strong agreement with these
statements:
1) Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified.
2) Students are morally obligated not to cheat.
3) Cheating directly contradicts the goals of education.
Our population split very neatly into the four categories,
about 25% in each.
Our subsequent cross-tabulations yielded interesting re
sults, which we will first summarize, and then examine some
details. Respondents with high scores on our Strong Values
index are much less aware of, involved in, and opinionated
about all matters related to cheating at Stanford. Their
responses to hypothetical cheating situations are very likely
to include expressing disapproval, even to friends (similar to
the 1961 response for the whole sample).
They learn about cheating primarily from official
channels, and about the Honor Code from signing blue
books. They are more likely to indicate strong belief in the
Honor Code, and to believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty constitutes a moderate or serious problem They
do not, however, hold consistently different perceptions of
fellow students or faculty with respect to Honor Code
support, nor are their opinions about specific aspects of the
Honor Code different from their fellow respondents. They
are not conspicuously either for or against proctoring; on
these and other questions soliciting opinions about hypothe
tical effects or the attitudes of others, they are more likely to
check "not sure."
They are, in sum, an interesting, not easily comprehen
sible, group of people—slightly more likely to be female and
majoring in the humanities, unlikely to be seniors, and more
likely to be very satisfied with their educational experience at
Stanford.
The tables that follow show the most impressive of the
differences discussed above. Other tables referred to but not
presented below are in the appendices.

Another section of the questionnaire elicited many speci
fic course characteristics of courses taken winter quarter by
our respondents. Among other things, they were asked about
the extent and types of cheating that occurred in the two
winter courses they liked best, and the one liked least.
Each single cheating item received too few mentions to be
useful to us, so we grouped together all mentions of any type
or level of cheating for the course liked best and created an
index, and similarly for the course liked least. Only 17
nonzero scores are on the first index (mentions of cheating
instances), and 36 on the course-liked-least index. The index
items are:
Respondent personally knew about or learned about. . . .
* Any other students cheating on the final exam, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on tests other than the
final, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on homework or lab
assignments, and/or;
* At least half the other students cheating at one or
another time during the course.
We were interested in learning what types of courses were
likely settings for cheating; by cross-tabulating the other
course characteristics against the index scores, we identified
several characteristics differentiating courses with observed
cheating from other courses.
Those courses liked best in which cheating occurred were
likely to be introductory, have more than 30 students
enrolled, and have short-answer exams (versus open-book,
essay, or take-homes). Past tests were likely to be available
for study purposes, seating was staggered during exams, and
either a TA or the instructor was likely to remain in the room
during exams.
Those observing cheating are likely to be high on our
cheating indices, which supports our earlier conclusion that
those who observe cheating are themselves more likely to
cheat. The course-least-liked index tables show similar results.
On the whole, we suspect that the attempt in this section
to understand better students who cheat and settings con
ducive to cheating events has produced results more useful to
the student of social deviance than to the concerned policy
evaluator.
The characteristics most obviously related to self-reported
cheating are value stances of a special, universalistic sort—a

trait probably not nurtured during the undergraduate years,
or seniors would not be conspicuously absent from the group
of high scorers on our values index.
With respect to the finding that those who cheat are much
more likely to observe other cheating, our data don't allow us
to establish the order of the relationship—i.e., does own
cheating heighten awareness and thus perceptions of others'
cheating, or does one begin cheating in response to observing
it? Probably both processes occur, but we cannot disentangle
them.
One main policy modification, the introduction of op
tional or mandatory proctoring of exams, is not strongly or
consistently favored by our population of noncheaters, nor
by the overlapping subgroup of those high on our values
index. Proctoring already exists in some classes, and our
respondents are more likely to report instances of cheating in
courses with proctored exams.
That does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that
proctoring is ineffective; that students do see cheating in
proctored exam courses may, however, help to explain the
lack of widespread support for proctoring as a solution to the
ills of academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
We have examined, described, and assessed a large amount
of data on Stanford students—their personal honesty, their
valuation of honesty, their experiences with and perceptions
of academic dishonesty among their fellow students, their
concern about cheating, their attitudes toward and know
ledge of the Honor Code, and their opinions about possible
modifications of the current system. What, after all this, can
we safely assert that we know?
First, and perhaps most important, is the conclusion that
Stanford does not currently have a "cheating problem";
those who have worried about a West Point level scandal may
sleep soundly, at least for a while. While cheating continues
to exist in academic endeavors, our data show that the
incidence of self-reported cheating among undergraduates is
approximately the same now as it was in 1961.
The increased selectivity exercised in undergraduate ad
missions may account in part for this lack of change;
although the pressures on students have certainly increased,
the student body includes fewer undergraduates who cannot
cope with the academic demands made of them
The picture is not entirely rosy, however. Indeed, it is
only a slight exaggeration to state that the low incidence of
cheating is independent of the current control system rather
than a result of it. Students are not knowledgeable about the
contents of the Honor Code, nor is the majority highly
committed to it. They similarly perceive their fellow students
and faculty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not
actually indifferent or opposed to it. The crux of the matter
is that the system is not seen to be working.
Students are both more aware of the cheating that does
exist, and less willing to report offenders (or ask them to
report themselves). Nor do they see faculty members filling
the activity gap as either police or advocates. (As our report
on the faculty surveys will state, this perception of the
faculty is essentially correct.)
There is no evidence that personal moral standards have
declined at Stanford, though the willingness to hold others to
universalistic standards seems to have declined substantially.
The 25% of our sample who do endorse the several
universalistic value statements in the questionnaire, and who
are substantially more willing to observe the reporting obliga
tion—these students are not, apparently, very visible or very
vocal among their fellow students. They do not have as much
experience with instances of cheating as the rest of the
sample; and, or course, it may be lack of experience which
permits them to predict that their hypothetical behavior
would differ from that of the majority.
We find no strong support for exam proctoring, even
among those subgroups most aware of and concerned about
levels of cheating.
The minority most exposed to cheating seem to favor
unilateral solutions, while the rest are more likely to reject
proctoring or prefer it as a faculty and/or student option. In
short, both the need to modify the current Honor Code, and
the appropriateness of alternative modifications continue to
be judgmental matters: our data provide no clear answers.
Our own interpretation—and it is merely that—is that
Stanford's Honor Code suffers primarily from invisibility
ignorance and apathy better describe our sample than dis
honesty and anxiety. While some modifications may be in
order (e.g., eliminating the reporting obligation, and per
mitting proctoring at studen' and/or instructor preference), it
is premature to consider abandoning the current system.
An educational program is needed, not simply on the
contents of the Code but also on topics like "What plagiarism
is and how to avoid it." (English and communication have
such a statement and some faculty members, at least, distri
bute copies to their students.)
People who throw out the baby with the bath water are
usually unaware that the baby is there; and until the
presence, characteristics, and value of the Honor Code are
widely known on campus, hasty action—like pulling the
plug—would be both unnecessary and undesirable.
The accompanying text was prepared by Sally Cole as a
report to the Student Conduct Legislative Council. The
Council had hoped to publish all questionnaire data received,
but this was not possible because of space and time limita
tions. Copies of appendices totalling nearly 100 pages of
tabular material are available through the Office of the
President's Legal Adviser, second floor. Building 10.
Bill Washburn, graduate student in education, helped Cole
with the interviewing and data analysis.

During spring quarter 1976, the Stanford Student Con
duct Legislative Council, at the request of President Richard
W. Lyman and the ASSU Council of Presidents, began three
data collection efforts designed to assess the current state of
Stanford's Honor Code. The first of these undertakings, a
questionnaire survey of graduate and undergraduate students,
will be described in this report. Similar questionnaire and
interview surveys of the Stanford faculty will be covered in a
later report.
The design of the student questionnaire was unexpectedly
influenced by the discovery that a 1961 nationwide study of
student dishonesty (Bowers, William J., Student Dishonesty
and Its Control in College, Bureau of Applied Social Re
search, Columbia University, 1964) had included responses
from 75 Stanford undergraduates (of 100 who were sent
questionnaires), and that the summarized data were available
for our use. Accordingly, about one-third of the 1976
questionnaire consists of questions repeated, unchanged,
from the 1961 investigation. These comparisons over a
15-year time span are so interesting that they are treated in a
separate section of this report.
Section 1 describes the sample characteristics, summarizes
the general findings of the survey, and discusses those areas
where graduate students and undergraduates are conspicuous
ly different. Section 2 examines, spearately for graduates and
undergraduates, the relevance of background characteristics
such as sex, ethnicity, academic department, and—for under
graduates—class and post-graduation plans. Section 3 de
scribes the 1961-1976 comparisons. Section 4 describes our
attempts to understand levels of individual honesty in terms
of individual values and perceptions.
No section pretends to treat all the data, or even all the
analysis results. The 12-page questionnaire yielded over 240
variables; the initial frequency distributions required almost
10,000 lines of computer type. The thorough-going analysis
which time pressures prevent is compensated for in part by
several appendices: (which have been omitted from Campus
Report. See introductory note.—Editor)
In addition, all computer print-out, questionnaires, and an
IBM card deck of data and the analysis set-up (SPSS), are
being stored by the chairman of the SCLC for members' use,
or use by others as circumstances permit.
Section 1: Sample characteristics and general findings
A random sample of 550 students was selected by
computer from the registrar's file of students who advance
registered for spring quarter. It was decided not to include in
our sample all the graduate students from the professional
schools; thus, only those graduate students and undergradu
ates in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth
Sciences, and Engineering were in the pool of potential
respondents.
Questionnaires were mailed to 350 undergraduates, from
whom we received 192 responses prior to 'he coding deadline
(55% return rate); 200 questionnaires went to graduate
students, from whom we received 117 responses, or about
58%.
In general, the sample characteristics are reasonably simi
lar to those of the population on dimensions such as
academic department, degree program, and sex. One anomaly
occurred—the 192 undergraduate responses included only
four from students who identified themselves as freshmen.
Unfortunately, in our zeal for respecting respondent
confidentiality, we did not keep a record of the names of
those to whom questionnaires were mailed, so we have no
empirical way to determine the cause or causes of the
lopsided class distribution.
We are left with three intuitive explanations, all of which
are probably partially true: 1) experience with and interest in
the Honor Code is likely to be related to length of time on
campus, and freshmen were less motivated to complete and
return the questionnaire; 2) by spring quarter, many fresh
men have accumulated enough units to graduation to con
sider themselves sophomores by that standard, and some may
have so identified themselves on the questionnaire; and 3)
random sampling techniques are only genuinely random in
the statistical long-run-any one sampling event will depart to
some extent from the perfectly random ideal.
A. Value of honesty; Honor Code commitment and know
ledge
Most respondents, both graduate and undergraduate,
agree either "strongly" or "mildly" with a set of value
statements including reasons for personal honesty, general
desirability of honesty, and global assertions about the
morality of cheating and reporting others for cheating. The
undergraduate endorsements, virtually indistinguishable from
those of graduates, are shown in rank order below:

% Agree % Agree
Strongly Mildly
Evaluations based on my honest
achievements are more valuable to
me than high grades 55 32
Students are morally obligated not to cheat 52 23
Cheating directly contradicts the goals
of education 51 23
Under no circumstances is cheating justified 46 17
An important reason for my own honesty is my
desire for accurate feedback on my
accomplishments 40 32
Most students want to be honest 31 43
% Disagree % Disagree
Strongly Mildly
Reporting someone for cheating is worse
than cheating 38 31
Honesty is desirably, but currently
impossible at Stanford 38 20
(As we will see in Section 4 of this report, the strength of
these value endorsements is strongly correlated with self
reported cheating; in Section 3 some interesting comparisons
with 1961 respondents will be made.)
Graduates and undergraduates differ slightly in response
to the question, "How strongly committed are you to
Stanford's Honor Code?"
Undergrad % Grad %
I believe in it very strongly 20 14
I believe it is a good idea 51 48
I don't care one way or the other 16 15
I feel it should be altered 11 13
I feel it should be abolished 2 10
While differences are not striking, there is consistently less
support voiced by graduate students.
Graduate students are not, however, less knowledgeable
about the contents of the Honor Code than are undergradu
ates. To rephrase that more accurately, all our respondents
are poorly informed about the contents of the Honor Code.
Of five questions asked quiz-fashion, only two turned out
to be analytically useful: for the other three, the vast
majority either chose the wrong answer or checked Don t
know." Of course, that our carefully designed quiz was too
demanding for our group is itself an interesting, though
unintended, result.
The two questions that "worked" concerned faculty
conduct: Approximately 40% of the sample accurately re
sponded that the Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring; and
32% know that the Code regulates faculty conduct as well as
that of students.
Many of our respondents are aware of their lack of
knowledge: Under
grad % Grad %
Do you consider yourself to be:
Well informed about the obligations of
the Honor Code 13 9
Somewhat informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 52 46
Not well informed about the obligations
of the Honor Code 35 44
The overwhelming single source of information is via
signing blue books—a source checked by 60% of the gradu
ates and 83% of the undergraduates. Official publications and
general word-of-mouth are information sources checked by
about 35% of our respondents. Approximately 10% indicated
that faculty are an information resource about the Honor
Code.

Undergraduates are slightly, and consistently, more san
guine about Honor Code knowledge and support among
fellow-students and faculty:
Do you think that your fellow students: % replying "most'
or "many"
Undergrad Grad
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 97 91
Know about its requirements? 65 52
Favor its continuation? 77 66
Support it by their behavior? 75 68
Do you think that your faculty:
Know that Stanford has an Honor Code? 98 95
Know about its requirements? 85 80
Favor its continuation? 76 73
Support it by their behavior? 74 69
Given a generally unimpressive information level about
the Honor Code, it is striking that almost half of our sample
think that "an educational program on the history and
contents of the Honor Code" is "unnecessary"; about as
many responded that it would be "desirable," and less than
10% responded "imperative" (5% for undergraduates, 9% for
graduates).
Of those who favor an educational program, about one
third think it should be required for all new students, and
should include "special mailings from appropriate University
groups"; about 55% also favored articles in The Daily and
Campus Report. Other options were only mildly endorsed.
B. Self-reported and perceived levels of academic dishonesty
Our respondents were asked to consider a list of thirteen
acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from "padding a biblio
graphy" to "buying an exam or paper," and to indicate
which, if any, of these things they had done since arriving at
Stanford.
In a separate section of the questionnaire, we also asked
for four more self-reports of cheating since arriving at
Stanford. The responses are quite different for graduates and
undergraduates:
% replying "Yes" to Undergrad Grad
1. "Padding" a few items on a biblio- 23 8
graphy
2. Copying a few sentences of material 35 13
without footnoting in a paper
3. Copying answers from a text or other 28 13
source instead of doing the work indepen
dently
4. Writing a paper for another student 3 3
5. Getting questions or answers from
someone who has already taken the same
exam 13 8
6. Giving answers to other students
during an exam 8 5
7. Arranging with other students to give
or receive answers by use of signals 1 0
8. Arranging to sit next to someone who
will let you copy from him during a test or
exam 4 0
9. Copying from someone's test or exam
paper without his knowing it 10 3
10. Taking an exam for another student 1 0
11. Having another student take an
exam for you 0 0
12. Working on the same homework

not allow it 12 12

Because the actions range from trivial to serious, and
these distributions count acts, not individuals, we construc
ted three indices of so-called cheating behavior. The first
index counts the number of respondents who checked at
least one item of the 1 7-item set shown above. The second
index is also a count, but excludes items 1-3 above. The third
index counts examination cheating only (items 5-10, 14-15).

Our respondent's perceptions of the amount of cheatiny
among their fellow students are most usefully viewed in the
context of their self-reports of cheating, a topic addressed in
Section 4, and in comparison with the 1961 data, discussed
in Section 3. Suffice it to say here that undergraduates
perceive substantially more cheating than do graduate stu
dents:

Respondents were asked to estimate, in percentage terms,
levels and types of cheating, levels of discovered cheating,
types of discipline imposed, etc. It is surprising, given their
differences in personal observation of cheating, that the
percentage estimates provided by graduates and undergradu
ates are quite similar. Some examples follow:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage have cheated since coming to Stanford."

Our respondents were asked how they learned about most
of the cases of cheating and plagiarim that they know about.
The student grapevine predominates among undergraduates,
but not for graduates:
Undergrads Grads
Observing the instances yourself 19% 23%
Hearing about them from the offenders 8 4
Hearing about them from other students
on the grapevine 55 33
Hearing about them through official channels
(e.g.. The Daily, Dean's Office,
a faculty member, etc.) 18 40
We turn now to two questions which will be reexamined
from other angles in subsequent sections of this report.
Though not directly addressing Honor Code issues, they
indicate the amount of support for the "reporting obliga
tion"—that observers of cheating report the offenders. The
low support expressed is all the more striking because the
questions pose hypothetical situations:
Suppose you saw a student cheating. What would you do?
Undergrads Grads
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 5% (1) 10%
Ask him to report himself and report him
if he fails to do so 3 ( (3) 10
Express disapproval informally but not
report him 34 (68) 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 33 (5) 17
Ignore the incident 25 (23) 29
Graduates and undergraduates agree about how their
behavior would change were the offender "a close friend":
the undergraduate percentages are shown in parentheses
above. If the offender were "a campus leader," however,
reporting becomes somewhat more likely, increasing to 17%
for undergraduates and 28% for graduates.
The second hypothetical question shows only small differ
ences between graduates and undergraduates; the percentages
below are for the undergraduate respondents.
If someone asked you for help during a test or exam,
what would you do?
Undergrad %
Give him the answer 2
Say nothing but expose your paper so
he can copy the answer 2
Ignore or turn down his request 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 21
Report him to the appropriate authorities 2
If the person seeking help were a friend, the percentage
selecting the first or second option increases to 21%; re
actions to "a campus leader" or "someone you disliked
personally" are not substantially different from those shown
above for an unspecified person.
One question attempts to assess in a global sort of way
"the cheating problem":
"Do you believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty at Stanford poses a serious threat to the academic
process?"
Undergrad %
Yes, very serious 11
Moderately serious 32
Not very serious 55

Graduate student responses differ in that many more
appear in the No Opinion column; when preferences are
expressed, they are in the same direction as those shown
above for undergraduates.
Asked who should serve as exam proctors, class instruc
tors and graduate TAs—in that order—are overwhelmingly
preferred over students from outside the class. Similarly, the
majority of respondents think that students should not
participate in "identifying and selecting from a pool of
potential proctors":

Finally, students were asked what probable effects would
result from instituting exam proctoring. Below we show the
undergraduate responses; where graduate responses are sub
stantially different, they appear in parentheses.
The incidence of cheating on examinations
would be reduced. 71%
Students would no longer feel obliged to report
the dishonesty of others on examinations 67 (50)
An Honor Code would lose meaning 58 (43)
A meaningful Honor Code would cease to exist 47 (26)
Students would feel threatened by the lack
of trust 44 ( 32)
Students would feel protected from a
minority of dishonest students 43
The incident of cheating in other areas would
increase (e.g., take-home exams, lab reports). 16
Students would no longer feel obliged to behave
honestly on examinations 12
We now turn, in the following sections, to more detailed
considerations of the results of our study, broadly and
briskly described above.
Section 2: The Role of Background Characteristics
It is a truism of social research that one can always find
background characteristics of respondents which correlate—at
impressive statistical levels—with the dependent variables
under scrutiny. This study is no exception.
Separately for graduates and undergraduates, we cross
tabulated a range of background characteristics with a long
but selective list of variables concerning values, perceptions,
and behaviors. We found many, many differences; undergrad
uate class, academic department, and—to a lesser extent
graduate school intentions, sex, and citizenship, all show
correlations with many of our value and behavior indicators.
In the interests of brevity, clarity, and progress, we have
selected from this mass of data in two ways: first, only those
findings of central policy interest to the SCLC are being
reported here; and second, only those patterns of relation
ships which are internally consistent will receive attention.
An example which meets the first criterion but fails the
second: Freshmen and sophomores are more likely to know
that the Honor Code prohibits proctoring, but less likely to
agree that the Honor Code "regulates faculty behavior." Both
relationships are statistically significant; viewed together,
however, they don't make sense and are better politely
dismissed than puzzled over (e.g., "It appears that undergrad
uate class is not systematically related to knowledge of
Honor Code contents.")
Tables showing the relationships described in this section
r,ro available in the appendices. Throughout what follows,
"sophomores" should be understood to include our four
token freshmen.
Undergraduate class relates in a variety of ways to several
key variables, especially perceptions of cheating. Honor Code
commitment, and attitudes toward proctoring. Sophomores
have seen less cheating and fewer instances of students
reporting others for cheating; they are, however, slightly
more likely to have seen instructors ignoring cheating behav
ior. Although their self-reported cheating varies only slightly
from that of upperclassmen, sophomores are more likely to
worry about false accusations of cheating.
Sophomores are especially likely to state that the Honor
Code system should be altered, and least likely to describe
themselves as believing strongly in the current system. They
favor the introduction of exam proctoring more than upper
classmen do, especially in classes with enrollments over 30,
and/or in required preprofessional classes.
Sophomores' attitudes and experiences extend to their
perceptions of other students and faculty: they are least
likely to think other students favor continuation of the
current Honor Code; while more likely to believe that faculty
know about the Honor Code and its requirements, they are
least likely to think faculty favor its continuation or support
it by their behavior.
Differences by undergraduate major are, by and large,
inconsistent and statistically small—few exceed 10%. There is
some tendency for respondents in social science departments
to see a world that is consistently slightly different from that
seen by others; the humanities, science, and engineering
students do not generally differ greatly from each other in
patterned or consistent ways.
Social science majors are distinctive in the following
respects: they report having seen more cheating, more often
been asked for help on exams, more often observed an
instructor ignoring cheating, knowing of more instances of
students reporting offenders, and more likely to think that
the current level of academic dishonesty poses a serious
threat to the educational process.
Their self-reports of cheating are high on three of the six
items where area of major shows a difference; unlike the
other disciplinary areas, they are low on no item. They do
not, however, conspicuously favor exam proctoring; indeed,
they are least willing to proctor "as a University obligation,"
though the percent willing doubles "if paid" (the other
disciplinary areas show a decrease in willingness if proctoring
were a paid job). While not especially in favor of any of the
proctoring options, social science majors are least likely to
believe that an effect of proctoring would be that "the Honor
Code would lose meaning."
Many of the areas in which social science majors differ
from our other undergraduate respondents also differentiate
between undergraduates with professional school versus grad
uate school intentions.
On all variables relating to knowledge of cheating, general
perceptions of the extent of cheating, and self-reported
cheating, either no differences appear or the profession
oriented students are higher—i.e., more aware of cheating and
higher rates of self-reported cheating.
On the Honor Code quiz, profession-oriented students are
less likely to know that exam proctoring is prohibited; later
questions show them to be more in favor of mandatory
proctoring, slightly more willing to proctor as an obligation,
and much more willing to proctor if paid to do so.
The two groups also differ in the results they would
expect from proctoring: graduate school-oriented students
believe that students would feel threatened, while the profes
sion-oriented think that "feeling protected" is a more likely
outcome.
Sex and ethnic background are generally unrewarding
variables in this study. Two self-reported cheating items, both
referring to copying from another's paper during an exam,
show women less likely—by 10% or more—to cheat in this
fashion.
Women are more likely to consider themselves "not well
informed" about the Honor Code, though their quiz scores
are no worse than the men's. Mandatory proctoring receives
more support from women; other proctoring options, how
ever, are not conspicuously supported by one sex or the
other. Favorable effects of proctoring—e.g., that students
would feel protected—are cited more frequently by women;
men are more likely to respond that an Honor Code would
lose meaning and/or that a meaningful Honor Code would
cease to exist.
The ethnic background tables include both graduates and
undergraduates in order to obtain a statistically comfortable
number of "non-Caucasian" respondents (black, chicano,
Spanish surname, native American, Asian American, or

"other"). The ethnic conglomerate may be meaningless; but,
in any case, being "non-Caucasian" does not relate consis
tently or significantly to any of the behavioral or attitudinal
variables in our study.
Background Variables and the Graduate Sample
The obvious and occasionally interesting differences dis
cussed with respect to our undergraduate respondents are
not, in general, evident among the graduate respondents in
our sample. There are not as many cases, and two areas
(Earth Sciences and H & S Humanities) include too few cases
to allow attention to comparative percentages.
The reader may remember from Section 1 that experience
with and awareness of academic dishonesty is signfficantly
lower among Stanford's graduate student population. One
result of this difference is that is is less rewarding—indeed
discouragint—to examine departmental or other background
variables with respect to the respondent's own cheating or
awareness of it: there are simply too few cases to yield
dependable percentages. Thus we have a reduced set of
variables to examine; however—to the extent that any disci
plinary area stands out as consistently different from the
other two—it is, at the graduate level, that of H & S science
and math students.
Not many variables, even with the reduced set, show
disciplinary differences. Those that do tend to be those
discussed both earlier and later in this report—those items
with respect to which, for a variety of reasons, our sample
respondents seem to differ. On these variables, shown in
tabular form in the appendices, graduate students in H & S
science and math departments come through as personally
moral pessimists.
The differences are neither wholly consistent nor statis
tically awesome, but it appears that the science/math sub
group is more likely to endorse the broadly-stated values of
honesty, to not worry much personally about cheating, and
to cheat less; to perceive less Honor Code support and
knowledge among fellow-students and faculty; and to not
favor the proctoring remedy, anticipating several ill effects.
With flags of caution waving wildly, we close this section
with a few comments about the graduate student population
who are not U.S. citizens. It is a small group (only 18
respondents), and hence the need for caution. The differ
ences in responses between citizens and noncitizens, however,
are surprisingly consistent over a range of variables—unlike
our results with the "non-Caucasian" background variable.
To summarize the tables which appear in the appendices,
value statements which citizens tend to endorse (e.g. "Most
students want to be honest."), noncitizens indicate "Not
Sure"; others which citizens tend to disagree with (e.g.,
"Reporting someone for cheating is worse than cheating"),
noncitizens tend to endorse. They express less commitment
to the Honor Code and perceive less support among other
students. They are less supportive of (or less opinionated
about) various proctoring options, less willing to serve as
proctors, and likely to expect more negative results to follow
the introduction of proctoring. These several areas of differ
ence are not always statistically large, but the fact that
differences consistently appear is deserving of some atten
tion.
Section 3: Some Comparisons Between 1961 and 1976
Before discussing the results of our comparisons over
time, it is appropriate to restate some of the differences
between the studies which restrict the ease with which our
comparisons may safely lead to firm conclusions:
1) The 1961 results are based on only 75 undergraduates,
a 75% response rate from the sample;
2) The 1961 study was nationwide, sponsored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and covered many topics related to
social control processes, whereas our study is internally
sponsored and relatively narrow in scope; and
3) The representation of freshmen in the 1961 survey
was proportional to their population size, which is not true
of 1976 freshmen.
On the positive side, the questions we chose to repeat are
identical in wording and response categories to the 1961
versions; also, background items for which we have other
sources of trend data—e.g., sex, age, grade average, ethnic
background, and type of campus housing—show changes very
similar to those in the questionnaire responses.
We will discuss several interesting comparisons in this
section; attention will focus first, however, on four findings
of special interest to the SCLC.
First, contrary to prevailing opinion, our data show no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976.
Second, current students are more likely to have actually
seen instances of cheating, and to perceive-in a general
way—that more cheating exists, than was true of their
predecessors.
Third, there is a notable drop in expressed support for
value statements concerning honesty, especially those with a
universal tone—e.g., "Under no circumstances is cheating ever
justified."
Fourth, support for the reporting aspect of the Honor
Code has indeed declined; in 1961, about one-quarter of the
sample would, m a hypothetical cheating situation, report the

offender or ask that he report himself—compared to less than
10% who say they would do so in 1976.
Self-Reports of Academic Dishonesty
The fo;lowing self-reports were solicited in 1961 and
1976 with the results shown in the two columns to the right:
Check all the following which you have done at Stanford.

Another set of questions allowed five responses ranging
from "Never" to "Many times"; so few persons, in either
year, selected the fourth or fifth categories, that we show
below only the predominent response categories.

The lack of change shown above is worth notice; where
there are changes—in either direction—they are too small to
warrant serious attention. It is, we believe, a safe conclusion
that self-reported acts of cheating are unchanged between
1961 and 1976. (We should point out that in Bowers' 1961
data, the Stanford level of cheating was found to be very low
in a nation-wide context. Even on those questions which
show an increase between 1961 and 1976, the current
Stanford percent is below the nationwide 1961 sample
percent.)
PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIC
DISHONESTY
Here we see some substantial differences. In both years,
students were asked, "Since you have been at Stanford [at
this school], have you seen another student cheating during a
test or exam?"
'61 '76 '61 '76 '61 '76
Never 76% 49% Once 12% 9% A few 7% 29%

times 1% 2% times 0% 1%
It seems indisputable that current students are more likely
to have personally witnessed cheating activity. Regardless of
their own experience, they also hold different perceptions of
the extent of academic dishonesty and the functioning of
disciplinary processes. Students in both years were asked to
estimate, in percentage terms, the frequency of the following
events:
"For the student body as a whole, estimate roughly what
percentage has cheated since coming to Stanford."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-15%) 42% 35%
Medium estimate (16-60%) 37 51

Medium estimate (71-97%) 68 34
High estimate (above 97%) 0 19

High estimate (above 65%) 11 14

1961 1976

Medium estimate (1-10%) 28 26
High estimate (above 10%) 13 6
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty

age of the cases no disciplinary action is taken."
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-20%) 90% 49%
Medium estimate (21-85%) 9 47
High estimate (above 85%) 1 4
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty

age of the cases disciplinary action is taken by the course
instructor.
1961 1976
Low estimate (0-35%) 48% 39%
Medium estimate (36-90%) 40 52
High estimate (above 90%) 12 9
"Of those students brought to the attention of the faculty

1961 1976
Low estimate (0-5%) 19% 32%
Medium estimate (6-50%) 39 56
High estimate (above 50%) 42 11
Comparing percentage distributions of percentage esti
mates can be quite confusing. Some differences, however,
come through quite clearly: 1961 respondents estimated a
higher "discovery rate" for cheaters, expected more disco
veries to be made by faculty, and substantially more cheating
cases being passed to authorities beyond the classroom. In
neither year did many students perceive a high level of
self-reporting ("0%" the majority estimate—chosen by 59% in
1961 and 69% currently).
These indicated trends in the percentage estimates are
confirmed by another set of responses elsewhere in the
questionnaire:

Unfortunately, our 1961 data are in the form of com
puter print-out rather than IBM cards, so we are unable to
examine the relationships between these value endorsements
and other variables of obvious interest—like self-reports of
cheating. As we will discuss later in Section 4, 1976 respon
dents who agree strongly with some of these statements are
conspicuously different from their fellow-students in several
other ways as well.
RESPONSES TO HYPOTHETICAL CHEATING SITUA
TIONS
Earlier we examined responses about cheating actually
observed; here we inquire what our responses would do if
they observed cheating.
"Suppose you saw a student cheating on a test or exam.
What would you do?"
1961 1976
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 4% 5%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 22 3
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 36 34
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 14 33
Ignore the incident 2525
In both years, one-quarter of the students in this hypothe
tical situation would ignore the incident. Also in both years,
the modal choice is to express disapproval but not to report
the offender.
The big change is in the second most popular form of
social control-in 1961, it is to ask the person to report
himself and report him if he doesn't do so, and in 1976 it is
to mention the incident to others but not report it.

"How often have the following things happened that you
knowabout?"

now.

with consistent differences over time again evident.

It may seem surprising that only 26% of the 1961 sample
supported the reporting obligation of the Honor Code; but
other responses show that students also perceived some
student support for reporting in 1961—the combination of
general perception plus 26% commitment may well have
resulted in a social control system that effectively reduced
academic dishonesty.
Another hypothetical situation was posed:
1961 1976
Give him the answer 0% 2%
Say nothing but expose your paper
so he can copy the answer 4 2
Ignore or turn down his request 59 74
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 32 21
Report him to the appropriate
authorities 5 2
Two categories show 10-15% differences; ignoring or
rejecting such a request is a more popular option now, and
expressing disapproval informally is less popular. Neither
sample views reporting the request with much favor.
Both hypothetical situations were elaborated by changing
the identity of the cheater from an unspecified individual to
"a campus leader" and "a close friend"; the second situation
added a third, "some you disliked personally." In both years,
a friend observed cheating is less likely to be reported and
more likely to be informally disapproved of; campus leaders
>n both years are more severely treated than others—27% of
the 1961 sample, and 17% in 1976, would report him, and
only about 20% would ignore the incident.
For the solicited exam aid situation, our two samples are
similar with the following exceptions; whereas currently 21%
would cooperate with a friend's request, only 7% thought
they would do so in 1961; both samples are more likely to
express disapproval to a friend than to the other specified
offenders, 42% selecting this treatment of a friend in 1961,
and 30% in 1976. For neither sample is reporting a likely
option—even for campus leaders in 1961, the figure is only
7%.
This concludes our review of trend findings of key
interest to the SCLC. We have restricted our interpretive
comments to the analytic variety, indicating which differ
ences seemed, to us, worth serious attention.
Another level of interpretation, however, is needed with
respect to one blatant anomaly: How is it that individual
self-reported cheating is unchanged, but current students
report seeing more cheating than their predecessors? One
possible interpretation is simply that cheating is more conspi
cuous when it does occur; that the change in moral climate,
suggested by the value endorsement data, has both allowed
current cheaters to be more open in their activities and
opened more widely the eyes and ears of noncheaters. To the
extent that our 1976 data permit, we will examine these
possibilities in Section 4. Our aim here is to draw attention to
the phenomenon and encourage speculation.
1961 AND 1976 VIEWS ON THE PURPOSES OF A COL
LEGE EDUCATION
Several questions on the Bowers questionnaire, while not
related to the SCLC task, were so potentially interesting to
repeat 15 years later that we easily yielded to the temptation.
Students were asked to consider a list of purposes of a college
education, to indicate the importance of each purpose to the
respondent, and then to select that purpose considered most
important to the respondent.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Most
Important Purpose
1961 1976
gg Provide a basic general education and
appreciation of ideas
Provide vocational training; develop
skills and techniques directly
applicable to my career
Develop my ability to get along with
different kinds of people
Develop my knowledge and interest in the
® ® community and world problems
Help develop my moral capacities, ethical
® standards and values
Prepare me for a happy marriage
® and family life
Looking at these comparisons, it is hard to believe that 15
turbulent years have passed since the first survey. With two
exceptions, the differences are smaller than pollsters ex
pected to find over a one-week time span! Amidst such
constancy, the two shifts stand out sharply: Current students
attribute somewhat less importance to acquiring knowledge
about world problems (though the change is not large); and
our sample virtually rejects preparation for marriage as an
important purpose of college—in 1961, 53% assigned some
importance to this purpose, compared with 28% today.
With some trepidation, we also repeated the question,
"How well satisfied are you with your educational experience
at Stanford [at this school] ?"
1961 1976
Very well satisfied 38% 24%
Fairly well satisfied 55 63
Not very well satisfied 7 13
Not at all satisfied 0 0
The drop in the top category, while not huge, is big
enough to qualify as real. We did not inquire into reasons for
the respondents' level of satisfaction (nor did Bowers), and
thus cannot help those wishing to interpret or evaluate the
significance of this change.
Section 4: A Closer Look at Self-Reported Cheating
While we know more now about the state of academic
honesty at Stanford than we did prior to the survey, we still
should look closer at the correlates of self-reported cheating
activity.
Our data do not allow us to assign causality and statis
tically test alternative explanations of cheating behavior; we
can, however, change tactics from preceding sections and
focus on different levels of cheating—seeking related variables
that are potentially manipulable, be it by policy or informal
effort.
We make frequent use in this section of the three
"cheating indices" introd - "~ed in Section 1: Cheating Index,
"Serious" Cheating, and Exam Cheating. By cross-tabulating
each index with a wide range of variables, we looked for
differences between the three indices (e.g.. Are those who
admit to serious cheating different from those who admit to

what one SCLC member labeled "dilettante cheating"?), as
well as for differences between self-confessed cheaters of
whatever stripe and noncheaters.
First, we examine the hypothesis that noncheaters are
better informed about the contents of the Honor Code than
are those who cheat. We created a Knowledge Index based on
the quiz-type questions, high scores going to those with a
higher proportion of right answers. Cross-tabulating the
Knowledge Index with each cheating index produced no
difference worth reporting. It appears that our respondents
who cheat know neither more nor less about the Honor Code
than their contemporaries who don't cheat.
Perceived cheating is, not surprisingly, positively related
to self-reported cheating; the indices work similarly, but the
relationship shows most clearly in the example below:
"Since you have been at Stanford, have you seen another
student cheating during a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Never 61% 54% 29%
Once 9 8 9
A few times 23 27 39
Several times 5 7 11
Many times 2 3 12
Very Fairly Not very
Important Important Important

% % %

55 41 40 46 4 13
26 29 47 45 27 26
10 4 43 24 47 72
The biggest difference is between those who are high on
our index (N=s6), versus those who are medium or low. This
pattern reappears in response to the question, "What would
you do if you saw someone cheating on a test or exam?"
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Report him to the instructor or
appropriate authority 9% 4% 4%
Ask him to report himself and report
him if he fails to do so 5 4 0
Express disapproval informally but
not report him 42 37 23
Mention the incident to other students
but not report him 28 29 39
Ignore the incident 16 25 34
Similarly, those who admit to having cheated are more
likely to have been asked for help during a test or exam; in
response to such a request, they are more likely to aid the
person or ignore the incident (versus reporting or expressing
disapproval).
Strong differences appear when the cheating index is
cross-tabulated with the three universalistic value statements
(again, all three cheating indices work similarly). The follow
ing table examplifies the differences found with respect to
the other value statements as well.
"Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified."
Cheating Index Score Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 74% 40% 26%
Agree mildly 23 14
Not sure 5 19 24
Disagree mildly 9 27
Disagree strongly 14 9

The differences seen above are substantially reduced when
respondents are asked to indicate their agreement with the
statement: "Honesty is desirable, but currently impossible at
Stanford."
Cheating Index Score
Low (None) Medium High
Agree strongly 10% 8% 11%
Agree mildly 12 16 24
Not sure 21 12 14
Disagree mildly 16 21 22
Disagree strongly 41 43 29
We also find no large differences with respect to level of
commitment to the current Honor Code, or to the serious
ness of the current level of academic dishonesty at Stanford.
There is a modest tendency for noncheaters to prefer proc
toring, but the differences are neither consistently related to
level of self-reported cheating nor larger than about 10%.
With respect to background variables, seniors tend to
appear in the medium and high categories on our scales (52%
of the "highs" are seniors). There is a discernable but
undramatic tendency for social science majors to be high,
engineering and science majors medium, and humanities low.
There is a similar consistent, modest tendency for students
with professional school plans to score higher on our indices
than those planning to attend graduate school.
A final small correlation that is packed with interpretative
potential: Noncheaters are more likely to be "very satisfied"
with their educational experiences at Stanford than respon
dents scoring medium or high (% "very satisfied," 33%, 24%,
and 18% respectively).
Since our largest unexpected differences, both here and in
the 1961 comparisons, have involved three value statements,
we decided to look more closely at our respondents' value
endorsements. We created an index called Strong Values, ana
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each respondent according
to how many times he indicated strong agreement with these
statements:
1) Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified.
2) Students are morally obligated not to cheat.
3) Cheating directly contradicts the goals of education.
Our population split very neatly into the four categories,
about 25% in each.
Our subsequent cross-tabulations yielded interesting re
sults, which we will first summarize, and then examine some
details. Respondents with high scores on our Strong Values
index are much less aware of, involved in, and opinionated
about all matters related to cheating at Stanford. Their
responses to hypothetical cheating situations are very likely
to include expressing disapproval, even to friends (similar to
the 1961 response for the whole sample).
They learn about cheating primarily from official
channels, and about the Honor Code from signing blue
books. They are more likely to indicate strong belief in the
Honor Code, and to believe that the current level of academic
dishonesty constitutes a moderate or serious problem They
do not, however, hold consistently different perceptions of
fellow students or faculty with respect to Honor Code
support, nor are their opinions about specific aspects of the
Honor Code different from their fellow respondents. They
are not conspicuously either for or against proctoring; on
these and other questions soliciting opinions about hypothe
tical effects or the attitudes of others, they are more likely to
check "not sure."
They are, in sum, an interesting, not easily comprehen
sible, group of people—slightly more likely to be female and
majoring in the humanities, unlikely to be seniors, and more
likely to be very satisfied with their educational experience at
Stanford.
The tables that follow show the most impressive of the
differences discussed above. Other tables referred to but not
presented below are in the appendices.

Another section of the questionnaire elicited many speci
fic course characteristics of courses taken winter quarter by
our respondents. Among other things, they were asked about
the extent and types of cheating that occurred in the two
winter courses they liked best, and the one liked least.
Each single cheating item received too few mentions to be
useful to us, so we grouped together all mentions of any type
or level of cheating for the course liked best and created an
index, and similarly for the course liked least. Only 17
nonzero scores are on the first index (mentions of cheating
instances), and 36 on the course-liked-least index. The index
items are:
Respondent personally knew about or learned about. . . .
* Any other students cheating on the final exam, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on tests other than the
final, and/or;
* Any other students cheating on homework or lab
assignments, and/or;
* At least half the other students cheating at one or
another time during the course.
We were interested in learning what types of courses were
likely settings for cheating; by cross-tabulating the other
course characteristics against the index scores, we identified
several characteristics differentiating courses with observed
cheating from other courses.
Those courses liked best in which cheating occurred were
likely to be introductory, have more than 30 students
enrolled, and have short-answer exams (versus open-book,
essay, or take-homes). Past tests were likely to be available
for study purposes, seating was staggered during exams, and
either a TA or the instructor was likely to remain in the room
during exams.
Those observing cheating are likely to be high on our
cheating indices, which supports our earlier conclusion that
those who observe cheating are themselves more likely to
cheat. The course-least-liked index tables show similar results.
On the whole, we suspect that the attempt in this section
to understand better students who cheat and settings con
ducive to cheating events has produced results more useful to
the student of social deviance than to the concerned policy
evaluator.
The characteristics most obviously related to self-reported
cheating are value stances of a special, universalistic sort—a

trait probably not nurtured during the undergraduate years,
or seniors would not be conspicuously absent from the group
of high scorers on our values index.
With respect to the finding that those who cheat are much
more likely to observe other cheating, our data don't allow us
to establish the order of the relationship—i.e., does own
cheating heighten awareness and thus perceptions of others'
cheating, or does one begin cheating in response to observing
it? Probably both processes occur, but we cannot disentangle
them.
One main policy modification, the introduction of op
tional or mandatory proctoring of exams, is not strongly or
consistently favored by our population of noncheaters, nor
by the overlapping subgroup of those high on our values
index. Proctoring already exists in some classes, and our
respondents are more likely to report instances of cheating in
courses with proctored exams.
That does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that
proctoring is ineffective; that students do see cheating in
proctored exam courses may, however, help to explain the
lack of widespread support for proctoring as a solution to the
ills of academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
We have examined, described, and assessed a large amount
of data on Stanford students—their personal honesty, their
valuation of honesty, their experiences with and perceptions
of academic dishonesty among their fellow students, their
concern about cheating, their attitudes toward and know
ledge of the Honor Code, and their opinions about possible
modifications of the current system. What, after all this, can
we safely assert that we know?
First, and perhaps most important, is the conclusion that
Stanford does not currently have a "cheating problem";
those who have worried about a West Point level scandal may
sleep soundly, at least for a while. While cheating continues
to exist in academic endeavors, our data show that the
incidence of self-reported cheating among undergraduates is
approximately the same now as it was in 1961.
The increased selectivity exercised in undergraduate ad
missions may account in part for this lack of change;
although the pressures on students have certainly increased,
the student body includes fewer undergraduates who cannot
cope with the academic demands made of them
The picture is not entirely rosy, however. Indeed, it is
only a slight exaggeration to state that the low incidence of
cheating is independent of the current control system rather
than a result of it. Students are not knowledgeable about the
contents of the Honor Code, nor is the majority highly
committed to it. They similarly perceive their fellow students
and faculty as not supportive of the Honor Code, if not
actually indifferent or opposed to it. The crux of the matter
is that the system is not seen to be working.
Students are both more aware of the cheating that does
exist, and less willing to report offenders (or ask them to
report themselves). Nor do they see faculty members filling
the activity gap as either police or advocates. (As our report
on the faculty surveys will state, this perception of the
faculty is essentially correct.)
There is no evidence that personal moral standards have
declined at Stanford, though the willingness to hold others to
universalistic standards seems to have declined substantially.
The 25% of our sample who do endorse the several
universalistic value statements in the questionnaire, and who
are substantially more willing to observe the reporting obliga
tion—these students are not, apparently, very visible or very
vocal among their fellow students. They do not have as much
experience with instances of cheating as the rest of the
sample; and, or course, it may be lack of experience which
permits them to predict that their hypothetical behavior
would differ from that of the majority.
We find no strong support for exam proctoring, even
among those subgroups most aware of and concerned about
levels of cheating.
The minority most exposed to cheating seem to favor
unilateral solutions, while the rest are more likely to reject
proctoring or prefer it as a faculty and/or student option. In
short, both the need to modify the current Honor Code, and
the appropriateness of alternative modifications continue to
be judgmental matters: our data provide no clear answers.
Our own interpretation—and it is merely that—is that
Stanford's Honor Code suffers primarily from invisibility
ignorance and apathy better describe our sample than dis
honesty and anxiety. While some modifications may be in
order (e.g., eliminating the reporting obligation, and per
mitting proctoring at studen' and/or instructor preference), it
is premature to consider abandoning the current system.
An educational program is needed, not simply on the
contents of the Code but also on topics like "What plagiarism
is and how to avoid it." (English and communication have
such a statement and some faculty members, at least, distri
bute copies to their students.)
People who throw out the baby with the bath water are
usually unaware that the baby is there; and until the
presence, characteristics, and value of the Honor Code are
widely known on campus, hasty action—like pulling the
plug—would be both unnecessary and undesirable.
