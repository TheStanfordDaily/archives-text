# The
						Fundamental Standard & Honor Code
## 
### 
Students are expected to observe the Fundamental Stand
ard of student conduct, which was stated as follows by
Stanford's first President, David Starr Jordan:
Students are expected to show both within and without
the University such respect for order, morality, personal
honor, and the rights of others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to observe this will be sufficient cause for
removal from the University.
The Honor Code at Stanford is essentially the application
of the Fundamental Standard to academic matters. Provisions
of the Code date from 1921 when the honor system was
established by the Academic Council of the University
Faculty at the request of the student body and with the
approval of the President.
By their registration at the University, all students affirm
the Honor Code which is stated as follows:
A. The Honor Code is an undertaking of the students,
individually and collectively:

(1) That they will do their share and take an active
part in seeing to it that others as well as themselves uphold
the spirit and letter of the Honor Code;
(2) That they will not give or receive aid in examina
tions; that they will not give or receive unpermitted aid in
class work, in the preparation of reports, or in any other
work that is to be used by the instructor as the basis of
grading.
B. The faculty on its part manifests its confidence in the
honor of its students by refraining from proctoring examina
tions or otherwise taking special steps to prevent the forms of
dishonesty mentioned above.
C. Provided that alternate seats are available, tests will be
taken from the classroom only with the consent of the
instructor (adopted by student referendum in 1955).
D. The students and the faculty will work together to
establish those conditions under which optimum academic
performance can be reached.
