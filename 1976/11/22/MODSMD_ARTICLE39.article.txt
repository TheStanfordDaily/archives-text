# Questionnaire, interviews probe faculty views of Honor Code
## 
### 
In their charge letter to the Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC), President Richard W. Lyman and the ASSU
Council of Presidents explicitly recognized that an adequate
evaluation of Stanford's Honor Code must not focus solely
on students.
The attitudes, behavior, and perceptions of the faculty are
at least equally important: Do they support the current
system in theory? Do they support it in practice? Under what
circumstances do faculty proctor examinations? What does
an instructor do when he or she suspects a student of cheat
ing? If the Honor Code procedures are not followed, why
not? Do faculty members view student cheating as a serious
problem at Stanford?
To answer these and related questions, the SCLC under
took two surveys of faculty members during late spring 1976.
First, a questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 200
faculty in the Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Engineer
ing, and Earth Sciences. Several weeks later, a subsample of
50 faculty in H & S was interviewed on Honor Code topics
not covered by the short-answer questionnaire. This report
will present our findings from these two data collection
efforts, beginning with the questionnaire survey.
The tables below show the proportional representation,
by rank and by school, of the faculty population from which
our sample was selected. The percentages in the second and
third columns allow comparisons between the total popula
tion, those faculty who were mailed questionnaires, and our
respondent group of 83. It is clear that our respondents are
reasonably representative, on the characteristics of rank and
school affiliation, of the population from which they were
selected.
The response rate, uncorrected for faculty in our sample
who were on leave spring quarter, is about 42%. We know of
20 faculty members who were on leave, whose questionnaires
were returned by their offices, and the real number on leave
is certainly somewhat higher. Correcting by the conservative
estimate of 20 yields a quite respectable 46% response rate.

Overview of Questionnaire Responses
Our respondents are not very well informed about the
contents of Stanford's Honor Code, even about those aspects
of the Code relating to faculty. Asked quiz-fashion if the
Honor Code prohibits exam proctoring, 47% of our sample
correctly responded that it does; 35% responded incorrectly,
and 18% selected the "Don't Know" option.
Another question asked if faculty conduct is regulated by
the Honor Code: 43% are aware tnat faculty conduct is
regulated, 35% incorrectly believe that it is not, and 22%
responded "Don't Know."
Not surprisingly, most faculty also lack detailed know
ledge of the functioning of the Honor Code System: for
example, the statement "The typical punishment for honor
violations is six month's suspension" is false (one quarter or
three months is typical)—3o% checked that the statement is
false, 7% thought it was true, and 63% checked "Don't
Know."
Perhaps discouraged by their quiz performance, a later
question finds most of our sample describing themselves as
"not well informed about the obligations of the Honor
Code" (31%), or "somewhat informed" (60%); a mere 9%
consider themselves to be "well informed."
Asked how they learned about the Honor Code, the
predominant information sources indicated are official publi
cations (49%), Blue Book statements (47%), and general
word-of-mouth (40%).
Attitudes Toward The Honor Code
Our sample is quite divided in response to the question,
"How committed are you to Stanford's Honor Code?"
Forty-two percent are either uncaring or opposed, and 58%
align themselves on the positive side, the extremes, "I believe
in it very strongly" and"I feel it should be abolished" are
virtually equal (15% and 16% respectively).
Asked to assess the general awareness among students and
faculty of the existence of the Honor Code, our sample
agrees that "most" or "many" on campus have this level of
knowledge; their perception of student and faculty know
ledge of Honor Code requirements, however, is much less
optimistic—especially with respect to other faculty. Twenty
percent think "most" of their faculty colleaaues know about

its requirements compared with 80% thinking "most" are
aware of its existence.
It is interesting that our sample perceives more faculty
supporting the Honor Code by their behavior than faculty
who favor Honor Code continuation. As we also discovered
during the interviews, a noticable number of Stanford faculty
observe Honor Code requirements in practice, but wish the
system were different.
Few faculty, 8%, believe that "the current level of aca
demic dishonesty at Stanford poses a very serious threat to
the academic process;" the rest of the sample splits about
evenly between the 45% who believe the threat is moder
ately serious," and the 47% who believe it is "not very
serious."
Asked to indicate their agreement with a battery of opin
ion statements about the Honor Code, our sample ranges on
every item from "agree strongly" to "disagree strongly," with
no clear consensus on any item. The statements included:
"The interpretation of the Honor Code is too vague and
indefinite;" "The Honor Code lacks strong faculty support,"
and "Punishments for honor violations are too lenient." (One
possible example of consensus is the last of the six items,
"Honor Code infractions occur because of ignorance of its
contents," which evokes 65% disagreeing mildly or strongly,
9% agreeing mildly or strongly, and 26% on the fence.)
Behavior in Cheating Situations
The remainder of the questionnaire focuses on the person
al behavior and experiences of the faculty with respect to
issues of academic dishonesty.
We first inquired about some teaching practices which we
believed might reduce the likelihood of cheating. We again
found wide variability on most items; for example, a third of
our respondents never check blue books for signatures, and
the four categories ranging from "rarely" to "always each
contain 12% to 19% of the remaining respondents.
Similarly with respect to changing exam or assignment
practices to reduce the likelihood of cheating, each category
from "never" to "always" has 14% to 25% of the sample. On
these items, as well as many others, one cannot describe
"faculty behavior" beyond indicating that it varies widely
plater we will reexamine our data for disciplinary differ
ences).
A majority of our sample (55%) "never" informs students
of the contents of the Honor Code, although 58% frequently
or always indicate their own boundaries of acceptable be
havior with respect to class assignments. Seventy-four percent
do not -ever proctor exams or arrange for proctoring; 15% do
so "rarely" or "sometimes," and 12% "frequently" or "al
ways."
Our sample was asked, "In the past three years, how
many times have you had reason to suspect your students of
cheating?" The responses: never 37%; once 14%; a few times
40%; several times 8%; many times 1%.
Those with some recent experience (i.e., who did not
check "never") were asked to indicate what actions they
took with respect to the most recent incident and also with
respect to the most serious incident. As the two columns
below show, the actions taken in the two circumstances
aren't very different—perhaps for many the most recent inci
dent was also the most serious, a possibility we neglected to
inquire about.
"In the most recent (most serious) instance of suspected
cheating in the past 3 years, what action did you take?"
% checked "yes"
Most Most
Recent Serious
No action 16% 5%
Discussed the situation with colleagues 51 42
Sought proof or support for your
suspicions 42 36
Discussed the situation with the
student(s) involved 49 49
Penalized the student(s) involved 23 33
Sought advice from the dean of student
affairs or other administrator 7 15
Followed Honor Code procedures and
referred the problem to the
President's Office 4 5
Other 5 5
Those who did not follow Honor Code procedures were
asked why not: of eight options, the two most frequently
checked were "sufficient evidence to convince others is too
difficult to obtain" (33%), and"I was in the best position to
evaluate infractions and impose appropriate penalties" (25%).
Sixteen percent allowed that they didn't know what the
Honor Code requirements were.
A hypothetical case was put to the whole sample, regard
less of their personal experience: "If you had reasonable
evidence that an undergraduate student had copied from
another student during an exam, what would you do 7" The
hypothetical actions differ substantially from the self-re
ported real actions: 42% would "follow Honor Code pro
cedures and refer '~ie problem to the President's Office,"

compared with the 5% who did so with respect to the most
serious cheating incident encountered recently.
We can speculate about this contrast, but we cannot
account for it. The hypothetical situation in the question
naire was deliberately made unambiguous, while real life is
often quite ambiguous—this may account for some of the
shift. Also the questionnaire probably had the effect of
raising the level of awareness concerning the Honor Code,
and may have also intentions to abide by its requirements.
A question asking about the relative desirability of the
Honor Code versus examination proctoring produced res
ponses very similar to the earlier question about Honor Code
commitment: 58% strongly or moderately prefer the Honor
Code, 20% don't care, and 22% strongly or moderately prefer
proctoring. Here, however, the extreme categories are very
different: 40% pro Honor Code versus 14% pro proctoring.
Asked why the Honor Code was preferred, 80% checked
"Better student-faculty relationships." Also checked by over
half our sample: "The Code reinforces individual honesty and
responsibility" (68%), "More effective in promoting hon
esty" (61%), and "More freedom in designing class assign
ments" (54%).
Those preferring proctoring had their say, too, almost
unanimously citing as a reason for their preference that
"Proctoring ensures fair and equal treatment for all students"
(94%); over half also checked that "The Honor Code is not
observed in practice" (53%).
Most of our sample (51%) declined to speculate about
whether "the current incidence of academic dishonesty at
Stanford is higher now than was true in the past:" those with
opinions were more likely to believe it has increased (31%)
than that it has not (19%).
Student-Faculty Comparisons
The first two-and-one-half pages of the faculty question
naire consist of questions repeated from a survey of 350
graduate and undergraduate students earlier in spring quarter.
We will now consider some of the ways in which students and
faculty agree and disagree about Honor Code issues.
Comparing students and faculty on our quiz about Honor
Code contents, we find their performances are equally bad,
faculty are less likely to say "Don't know," but not much
more likely to be right.
For example, "The Honor Code prohibits exam proc
toring:" 47% of the faculty and 42% of the students in our
sample know this is true. The faculty are slightly more aware
than students that the Honor Code regulates their behavior:
43% of the faculty, 32% of the undergraduates, and 27% of
the graduates responded correctly to this item. Clearly, any
educational program recommended by the SCLC needs to be
addressed to faculty as well as to students.
The three most common information sources used by
faculty for Honor Code questions are the same as the three
most used by students—official publications, used more by
faculty than students; Blue Books, less so for faculty than
students; and general word-of-mouth, checked by about 40%
each.
Faculty are slightly more likely to think themselves
"somewhat informed" about the contents of the Honor Code
(60% faculty, 52% undergraduates, 46% graduates), and less
likely to think themselves "not well informed" (31% faculty,
35% undergraduates, 44% graduates). The differences, how
ever, are not large.
Graduate students and faculty respond similarly to the
question "How strongly committed are you to Stanford's
Honor Code," showing themselves less committed than un
dergraduates:

I feel it should be abolished. 16 10 2
Asked about perceptions of students with respect to Hon
or Code knowledge and support (e.g., "Do you think that
Stanford students know that Stanford has an Honor Code 7"),
undergraduates and faculty agree quite closely, and graduate
students hold less favorable perceptions-the latter are prob
ably generalizing their own relative lack of knowledge and
enthusiasm. Asked similarly for perceptions of faculty, we
find that students hold substantially more favorable views of
the faculty than do our faculty respondents of their collea
gues.
For example
"Do you think that your faculty (colleagues! know about its
requirements?"
