# University overfluoridates water supply
## 
### Robert Mauro Staff writer 
An abnormally high concentration
of sodium fluoride, poisonous when pre
sent in large amounts, was found in the
university water supply last Tuesday,
but was flushed clean Wednesday, ac
cording to Anthony Sidlow, manager
of safety and health.
Sidlow said that the chemical is a
normal additive to the water. The high
concentration was evidently the result
of an accidental discharge from the
fluoridation station located near the
stables.
"I think it was a slug of material,
they (Plant Services) tried quickly to
isolate. They turned off all the valves
in the isolated section of the water sys
tem then flushed it and checked other
locations," said Sidlow.
According to Penny kurv. a post
doctoral fellow in chemistry and im
munology. the chemistry depart
ment's analytical laboratory did its
own analysis of a sample of water from
the Stauffer II building behind the
rhemistry building, obtained Tuesday
afternoon, and found that it contained
50-76 ppm sodium floride, a level 50
times the normal concentration.
Solid mass
According to Sidlow, "Apparently
some got out, it (the sodium fluoride)
was moving in an apparently solid
mass through the water system."
Kury said that she attempted to con
tact the health physics section of the
university's insurance risk manage
ment office Tuesday evening, but that
the analysts did not respond until
Thursday.
"When I noticed the chemical
tasting water it was 5:15 p.m. so offices
were closed. The emergency lines at
health physics and the emergency util
ity number said that it would have to
wait until the next day. The only ques
tion the emergency operators asked me
were why 1 didn't call before 5 p.m.
and asked if the water were an odd
color. 1 didn't know who else 1 should
call, so 1 disconnected our water foun

tain.
"In the 40 hours it took water inspec
tors to come analyze our water we
might have lost people in our depart
ment due to this poison in our drink
ing water," said kury.
Proper handling
However, according to Sidlow,
treatment of the water contamination
was handled properly.
"The fellow who was on it re
sponded in a timely manner. As far as
he knew, it was isolated around the
stables (near Lagunita), he was sur
prised it got any further. The system
was flushed with a fantastic amount of
water Wednesday, about 100,000 gal
lons," said Sidlow.
Sidlow said he is investigating the
handling of the incident.
Kury said that at least six people
who drank the water in Stauffer II be
came ill Tuesday evening.
Sidlow said that sodium fluoride
is only dangerous if consumed in
very high concentrations or over a long
period of time.

rhemistry building, obtained Tuesday
afternoon, and found that it contained
50-76 ppm sodium floride, a level 50
times the normal concentration.
Solid mass
According to Sidlow, "Apparently
some got out, it (the sodium fluoride)
was moving in an apparently solid
mass through the water system."
Kury said that she attempted to con
tact the health physics section of the
university's insurance risk manage
ment office Tuesday evening, but that
the analysts did not respond until
Thursday.
"When I noticed the chemical
tasting water it was 5:15 p.m. so offices
were closed. The emergency lines at
health physics and the emergency util
ity number said that it would have to
wait until the next day. The only ques
tion the emergency operators asked me
were why 1 didn't call before 5 p.m.
and asked if the water were an odd
color. 1 didn't know who else 1 should
call, so 1 disconnected our water foun

tain.
"In the 40 hours it took water inspec
tors to come analyze our water we
might have lost people in our depart
ment due to this poison in our drink
ing water," said kury.
Proper handling
However, according to Sidlow,
treatment of the water contamination
was handled properly.
"The fellow who was on it re
sponded in a timely manner. As far as
he knew, it was isolated around the
stables (near Lagunita), he was sur
prised it got any further. The system
was flushed with a fantastic amount of
water Wednesday, about 100,000 gal
lons," said Sidlow.
Sidlow said he is investigating the
handling of the incident.
Kury said that at least six people
who drank the water in Stauffer II be
came ill Tuesday evening.
Sidlow said that sodium fluoride
is only dangerous if consumed in
very high concentrations or over a long
period of time.
An abnormally high concentration
of sodium fluoride, poisonous when pre
sent in large amounts, was found in the
university water supply last Tuesday,
but was flushed clean Wednesday, ac
cording to Anthony Sidlow, manager
of safety and health.
Sidlow said that the chemical is a
normal additive to the water. The high
concentration was evidently the result
of an accidental discharge from the
fluoridation station located near the
stables.
"I think it was a slug of material,
they (Plant Services) tried quickly to
isolate. They turned off all the valves
in the isolated section of the water sys
tem then flushed it and checked other
locations," said Sidlow.
According to Penny kurv. a post
doctoral fellow in chemistry and im
munology. the chemistry depart
ment's analytical laboratory did its
own analysis of a sample of water from
the Stauffer II building behind the
rhemistry building, obtained Tuesday
afternoon, and found that it contained
50-76 ppm sodium floride, a level 50
times the normal concentration.
