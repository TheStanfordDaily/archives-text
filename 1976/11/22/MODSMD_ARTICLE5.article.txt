# Chris gets ax, too

Less than 24 hours before Stanford regained the Big
Game Axe. with a 27-24 victory over UC-Berkeley Satur
day, Athletic Director Joe Ruetz gave Jack Christiansen,
head football coach, the ax.
"It was my judgment that it would bein the best interest
of the athletic program to make a change," said Ruetz.
Ruetz commented Saturday after the Big Game about his
decision, "I was hoping to hold it up until Monday, so that
he could talk to the staff. In retrospect it was probably the
right thing to do."
Ruetz had told the Daily Thursday that "the decision
had been made a long time ago," but he said at the time
that it would be "highly inappropriate" to make an an
nouncement before he met with the coaching staff.
After reading the same comments in the Sun Francisco
Chronicle Friday morning, Christiansen asked for a meet
ing with Ruetz.
"You don't have to be a Phi Beta Kappa to figure out
what he was thinking." said Christiansen. "1 think even
some of (JSC's players could have figured it out. My phone
had been ringi ng off the hook the night before, so 1 decided
I better go in and see him. I wanted to know where I
stood.
"I told him if you are going to fire me. you may as well
do it now. and he told me I was gone. He said it was his
decision alone that he had made up his mind after the
Army game, the fourth game of the year."
"I made the decision around the Army game and cleared
it with President (Richard) Lyman after the (ISC' game,"
said Ruetz.

Stanford, a heavy favorite against Army, blew a 20-0
fourth-quarter load and lost 21-20. In the I ISC game third
ranked USC beat the Cards 48-24.
After the USC loss, UPI reported that a wealthy group of
southern California alumni were trying to force Ruetz to
oust Christiansen.
However, Ruetz said, "The decision was made some
time ago. It was discussed with the president of the uni
versity and has his approval. It was not made on the basis
of a won-loss record or alumni pressure. Many other fac
tors were considered."
Christiansen never had a losing season in five years,
compiling a total record of 30 wins, 22 losses and 3 ties,
but he was unable to produce a Rose Bowl trip.
Ruetz would not name those "other factors" in his deci
sion to fire Christiansen.
"I'm not going into those things. This is an internal
personnel matter and it's not for publication."
Christiansen was reportedly being pr.id $27,500 per
year. Ruetz said that the remainder of Christiansen's con
tract will be paid off using Athletic Department funds.
Christiansen, in an emotional state, broke the news to
his players after their final practice of the year, Friday
afternoon.
"If you wait to tell the players before the game they
might not recover from the shock until it was too late to
save the game," said Christiansen. "I felt thev had to
