# Help evaluate teaching
## 
### 
Larson and Parker

Are any of the courses you're taking
this quarter really good? Are any par
ticularly bad? Even if they are all just
average, the chances are that the ASSU
Course Guide will not be distributing
questionnaires in it.
This year we had hoped to survey
over 300 courses each quarter (as com
pared to 150 courses a quarter last
year). To accomplish this, we sent out
letters to the professors of over 525
courses. Unfortunately, as of now less
than 175 have responded to our plea
for assistance.
These uninspiring statistics can lead
one to a number of conclusions. First,
the quality of teaching at Stanford, and
evaluation of it, is indeed a low prior
ity for most faculty.
Second, unless sufficient data is ob
tained regarding one's teaching abil
ity, which now seems unlikely, it is
doubtful that the quality of teaching

will become an integral part of the te
nure and promotion process.
Finally, unless theCourseGuide has
a sufficient data base from which to
work, future editions of our publica
tion will not achieve their hoped for
value as an aid to students in selecting
their courses. Rather, it is possible that
in future editions we will have even
fewer course reviews than we do now.
But students can help turn this
around! And we must rely on student
support until student evaluation of
teaching via questionnaires is made
mandatory in the Schools of
Humanities and Sciences and Earth
Sciences (as it already is in the En
gineering, Law, Business, Education,
and Medical Schools).
We are asking for students to come
to our office in the ASSU Loft on the
second floor of Tresidder Union, or to
call us at 497-4331. If a course of yours

is already being covered, we'll knowit;
and if it isn't, we need your help. It
takes very little time to pick up, distri
bute, and return the questionnaires.
With a little bit of effort, you can
help the Course Guide try to improve
the quality of teaching at Stanford
University. Give us a call. You'll be
glad you did.
Final note: Look for the next edition
of the ASSU Course Guide on Nov. 24.
Off-campus students may pick up their
copies at ASSU, AIC, Tresidder, the
Bookstore, or at the Off-Campus Stu
dents' Lounge. Copies for other stu
dents will be distributed
charge through their residences. One
student from each residence should
come to our office on Wednesday to
pick up the copies for their house.

dinator.)
