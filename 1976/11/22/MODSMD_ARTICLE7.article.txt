# Guest Professorship Board seeks community suggestions
## 
### 
Vettel, et. al.

Last spring, Angela Davis, the well
known social activist and author, and
Claude Steiner, an innovative
psychiatrist, taught classes here as
ASSU guest professors. Both offered
courses not covered by Stanford de
partments, broadening the intellectual
dialogue within the community.
Both also came because of the initia
tive and decisions of students. For this
reason, the Guest Professor Program is
unique at Stanford. We students have
close to nothing to say about who
teaches us; only the guest professors
are selected by us. We again have the
opportunity to invite persons from
beyond our immediate academic
community to come here as guest pro
fessors this year.
The ASSU Guest Professorship
Board is now seeking suggestions for
possible guest professors from stu
dents, faculty, staff members and other
members of the community. Here is
your opportunity to suggest who you'd
like to see come here.
We ask that you bring your sugges
tions to our box at the ASSU office or
mail them to us there bv Dec. 3.

The Guest Professorship Board's re
cent history points to two motives for
inviting guest professors. During
1973-74 and 1974-75, political prison
ers were invited here in an attempt to
free them from the prisons of repres
sive foreign regimes.
Both individuals — Nguyen Huu
Thai, a neutral Vietnamese journalist
and urban planner, and Fernando
Flores, a Chilean economist — could
have taught courses of student interest.
Unfortunately, neither were freed in
time from prison and were unable to
come here last spring. Nevertheless,
the invitation of Thai and Flores di
rected public attention toward the
political repression in their countries
and put pressure on those govern
ments to end their repressive policies.
Last year, the Guest Professorship
Board invited Davis, Steiner and Ernst
Mandel, a widely reputed Belgian
economist. Their primary concern was
to make available to the Stanford
community views and approaches to
issues not generally found here.
We ask you to keep these traditions
in mind when you make your sugges-

tion, but we also ask that you suggest
alternative criteria for us to use in
choosing who to invite as guest profes
sor.
With your help, the Guest Professor
ship Program can continue to expand
the intellectual horizons here. At an
institution where we make so few of
the decision about who teaches us, it is
essential that we take advantage of
those we can make.

cent history points to two motives for
inviting guest professors. During
1973-74 and 1974-75, political prison
ers were invited here in an attempt to
free them from the prisons of repres
sive foreign regimes.
Both individuals — Nguyen Huu
Thai, a neutral Vietnamese journalist
and urban planner, and Fernando
Flores, a Chilean economist — could
have taught courses of student interest.
Unfortunately, neither were freed in
time from prison and were unable to
come here last spring. Nevertheless,
the invitation of Thai and Flores di
rected public attention toward the
political repression in their countries
and put pressure on those govern
ments to end their repressive policies.
Last year, the Guest Professorship
Board invited Davis, Steiner and Ernst
Mandel, a widely reputed Belgian
economist. Their primary concern was
to make available to the Stanford
community views and approaches to
issues not generally found here.
We ask you to keep these traditions
in mind when you make your sugges-

tion, but we also ask that you suggest
alternative criteria for us to use in
choosing who to invite as guest profes
sor.
With your help, the Guest Professor
ship Program can continue to expand
the intellectual horizons here. At an
institution where we make so few of
the decision about who teaches us, it is
essential that we take advantage of
those we can make.

Vettel, et. al.

Last spring, Angela Davis, the well
known social activist and author, and
Claude Steiner, an innovative
psychiatrist, taught classes here as
ASSU guest professors. Both offered
courses not covered by Stanford de
partments, broadening the intellectual
dialogue within the community.
Both also came because of the initia
tive and decisions of students. For this
reason, the Guest Professor Program is
unique at Stanford. We students have
close to nothing to say about who
teaches us; only the guest professors
are selected by us. We again have the
opportunity to invite persons from
beyond our immediate academic
community to come here as guest pro
fessors this year.
The ASSU Guest Professorship
Board is now seeking suggestions for
possible guest professors from stu
dents, faculty, staff members and other
members of the community. Here is
your opportunity to suggest who you'd
like to see come here.
We ask that you bring your sugges
tions to our box at the ASSU office or
mail them to us there bv Dec. 3.
