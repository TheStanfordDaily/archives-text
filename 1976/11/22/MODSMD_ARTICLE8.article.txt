# Minority admissions
## 
### 
Byron Bland

Tom Wylder isn't concerned about
minority admissions (Daily, Nov. 11).
He is concerned about . . . well, he
doesn't come right out and say. He
only talks up front about
emotionalism, utilitarianism, and how
Columbia Law Review, John Rawls
and Nozick spell an end to this kind of
thinking. It appears to be an academic
debate on theories of justice, devoid of
any emotion and, I might add, his
tory. ad hoc or otherwise.
1 am not talking about the history of
ideas, the nineteenth century or any
other. 1 am talking about the history
that lives and breathes in the streets
and homes of minority people. You
know, that history that highlights
slavery rather than industrial progress,
genocide rather than the creation of
political freedom, oppression and dis
crimination instead of military might
and equal opportunity.
Wylder's article looks like academic
debate; it smells like racism. Where is
his program for creating a community
out of the hating and warring factions
presently composing the United
States?
This is what justice is about.
The mastering of philosophical ar
guments will get you an A, but it won't
get you community or social stability.
These happen when people feel and
experience themselves as fairly treated
and equally included in the society at
large. People with a history of brutal

exclusion deserve sincere efforts to
right past wrongs, not debate on
ways to treat everyone, which inevita
bly comes out every white male, fairly
from now on.
Mention of the social usefulness of
minority doctors doesn't conjure up
notions of 19th century utilitarianism
to my mind. It expresses the social be
nefit such people could have for the
communities that they come from. It is
not presented as a principal of justice
■ on which our society should be struc
tured.
The perception of the social useful
i ness of minority doctors leads directly
i to another question of justice: why
; aren't there sufficient numbers right
. now? Answer: oppression and dis
crimination. Which leads to another
question: What are we going to do
about it? And that is the real issue of
justice in the good ole United States
today.
Concepts of justice are validated by
their ability to achieve acceptable
community conditions and personal
livelihood for the common, ordinary
human beings who have to work and
live with them. Minority admissions
have a better than average chance of
helping to produce some justice and
social harmony in this country and de-
I serve our support.

any emotion and, I might add, his
tory. ad hoc or otherwise.
1 am not talking about the history of
ideas, the nineteenth century or any
other. 1 am talking about the history
that lives and breathes in the streets
and homes of minority people. You
know, that history that highlights
slavery rather than industrial progress,
genocide rather than the creation of
political freedom, oppression and dis
crimination instead of military might
and equal opportunity.
Wylder's article looks like academic
debate; it smells like racism. Where is
his program for creating a community
out of the hating and warring factions
presently composing the United
States?
This is what justice is about.
The mastering of philosophical ar
guments will get you an A, but it won't
get you community or social stability.
These happen when people feel and
experience themselves as fairly treated
and equally included in the society at
large. People with a history of brutal

exclusion deserve sincere efforts to
right past wrongs, not debate on
ways to treat everyone, which inevita
bly comes out every white male, fairly
from now on.
Mention of the social usefulness of
minority doctors doesn't conjure up
notions of 19th century utilitarianism
to my mind. It expresses the social be
nefit such people could have for the
communities that they come from. It is
not presented as a principal of justice
■ on which our society should be struc
tured.
The perception of the social useful
i ness of minority doctors leads directly
i to another question of justice: why
; aren't there sufficient numbers right
. now? Answer: oppression and dis
crimination. Which leads to another
question: What are we going to do
about it? And that is the real issue of
justice in the good ole United States
today.
Concepts of justice are validated by
their ability to achieve acceptable
community conditions and personal
livelihood for the common, ordinary
human beings who have to work and
live with them. Minority admissions
have a better than average chance of
helping to produce some justice and
social harmony in this country and de-
I serve our support.

Tom Wylder isn't concerned about
minority admissions (Daily, Nov. 11).
He is concerned about . . . well, he
doesn't come right out and say. He
only talks up front about
emotionalism, utilitarianism, and how
Columbia Law Review, John Rawls
and Nozick spell an end to this kind of
thinking. It appears to be an academic
debate on theories of justice, devoid of
any emotion and, I might add, his
tory. ad hoc or otherwise.
