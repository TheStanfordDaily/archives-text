# Housing system under fire
## 
### Arlene Kishi Staff writer 
The Subcommittee on Residences of
the Committee on Services to Students
(COSS/R) will meet today to decide the
discussion topics for a series of 10
meetings to be held in student resi
dences next week. The meetings have
resulted from complaints about "in
equities" in the present residence
priority (PRP) system, according to
Subcommittee Chairman Tim Fergu
son.
At a meeting two weeks ago, the
subcommittee discussed advantages
and disadvantages of the PRP and sub
sequently voted unanimously to study
changes in the system now extant in
student residences.
The investigation could lead to abol
ition or limitation of the current
priorities, or to an alternative means of
increasing mobility between resi
dences.
The PRP system currently allows
those who "draw" their way into a
four-class residence after their
freshman year to remain in those resi
dences for their final guaranteed
on-campus year.
At its meeting two weeks ago, the
subcommittee opened the PRP issue to
discussion. Reasons brought up in
support of the system included con
tinuity in residences, development of
traditions and student willingness to
invest time and energy in residential
improvement.
The disadvantages that were
brought up included houses becoming
too inbred, the formation of cliques
and subsequent exclusion of new stu
dents, and most important, students in
less desirable houses possibly getting
frozen out because other students in
high-demand residences with PRP are
guaranteed another year there if they
are eligible under the Guaranteed
Housing Plan.
Meetings are planned for the major
dorm complexes and also in Colum
bae, Roth. Robert Moore, Alpha Sigma
and Branner. The meetings will be
conducted by one or two members of
the subcommittee.
