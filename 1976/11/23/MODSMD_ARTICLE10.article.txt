Fail quarter is quickly passing, and
we now have a brief opportunity to
relied on the quality of our classes be
lore tlie crunch of finals is upon us.
Take ii brief moment to answer the
Stanford Truth Test and see if it rings a
few bells.
11 1 low often have you sat through a
poorly structured and unorganized
lecture?
2) How many times have you
gotten back an exam or term paper with
no comments written on it?
:i) How often have you been told that
vour professor is not in and will call
vou back?

4) How many times have you heard
that students have "input" in univer
sity policy making?
The quality of teaching here is
perhaps the most significant ingre
dient of undergraduate education. A
professor who makes the effort to re
live periodically reading lists, to shar
pen lectures, to evaluate assignments
thoughtfully and to meet with stu
dents outside the classroom can con
tribute enormously to the quality
of undergraduate education.
Since students provide a unique in
sight into a professor's course prepara
tion and classroom performance, one

would expect them to have input into
the quality of teaching.
The fact that students have no input
into such an important area of their
education is contradictory of univer
sity policy and reeks with hypocrisy.
Student input in tenure promotions
would be consistent with university
officials' claims that such input is val
uable. Currently students sit on
numerous academic committees and
have contributed to many significant
academic innovations.
Reasons given by theadministration
for excluding student input from the
tenure process are that promotions are
too confidential, students only pro
vide a temporary viewpoint to deci
sions of a more permanent nature and
that there are no effective methods for
avaluating teaching performances.
These concerns are valid to a limited
degree; however, they are not adequate
to justify completely excluding stu
dents from the tenure process. There is
no reason to preclude the opportunity
for students to play some role in the
process.
Students Interested in Tenure (SIT),
a group responsible for informing the
student body of the tenure process,
will be meeting tonight to discuss
ways in which students can play a gre
ater role in the tenure process. The
formation of strong undergraduate
student associations and methods of
devising standardized methods of
evaluating teaching are two im
mediate solutions SIT sees for improv
ing student input into the tenure pro
cess.
Your support is needed to convince
administrators that undergraduates
are tired of being shortchanged and are
willing to put in the time to improve
the quality of their education.
