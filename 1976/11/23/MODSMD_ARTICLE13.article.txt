# ARC wants student input
## 
### 
Hawes and Vette!

Earlier in the quarter, the Daily reported that the Al
liance for Radical Change (AI£C) was dead. These reports
are highly exaggerated.
This quarter ARC put time and energy into organizing a
rally and a series of dorm discussions on the subject of
Food Day. We helped to publish an issue of Against the
Grain on the "Politics of Food." These actions were a
beginning, but tonight at our meeting we want to ask
ourselves where do we go from here? All interested people
are invited to attend the meeting at 8 p.m. in Columbae
House.
ARC was formed two years ago as a collection of
"somewhat radical students." Today we call ourselves
radicals. As we look around ourselves, we see a need for
basic change — in personal relationships, in the nation's
socio-economic system, throughout the political and
economic systems of the world, and particularly in the
university.
Common denominator
This year we hope to build the Alliance for Radical
Change as an alliance of the many assorted radicals at
Stanford. as the common denominator of all
Stanford radicals. In the recent Daily election poll. 6 per
cent of the respondents called themselves radical. In addi
tion, there are many students who are beginning to realize
they too are no longer satisfied with the traditional solu
tions.
We see the need to go beyond the patchwork solutions
that are continually proposed. We feel that the remedies to
problems can only be found in changing the conditions
that create them. In this sense, we often find ourselves in
agreement with the objectives of liberals, but believe their

solutions simply will not work.
Neither do we find adequate the responses to society's
problems given hy other students. We refuse to live our
lives as cynics, as so many students do. To blame the
world's difficulties on something as mutable as human
nature, as conservatives do, appears to us a very simplistic
escape. A spiritual solution may satisfy one's personal
needs, but we see little evidence of it helping the many
exploited brothers and sisters around us.
Change is needed
We believe change is needed everywhere, within the
university and throughout the world. Obviously such a
task is gigantic and will require the energies of the great
majority of the people to bring about. At this moment it is
critical for us to attempt to raise the consciousness that
such profound change is necessary. Given such an em
phasis, at the ARC meeting tonight, we plan to discuss the
direction we should take now.
There is no lack of issues about which we are concerned.
Nor is there a lack of energy for a successful political
campaign here, as the Food Day activities demonstrated.
But we need your input to know where to concentrate our
efforts, in order to be able to effect a significant change and
at the same time expose the need for much greater social,
economic and political change.
Our experience is limited: we can not possibly know all
the problems that exist within the university. We urge
anyone who is aware of any specific situation that should
be brought to our attention to attend our meeting tonight.
Everyone who wishes to work fora new society is invited.

lives as cynics, as so many students do. To blame the
world's difficulties on something as mutable as human
nature, as conservatives do, appears to us a very simplistic
escape. A spiritual solution may satisfy one's personal
needs, but we see little evidence of it helping the many
exploited brothers and sisters around us.
Change is needed
We believe change is needed everywhere, within the
university and throughout the world. Obviously such a
task is gigantic and will require the energies of the great
majority of the people to bring about. At this moment it is
critical for us to attempt to raise the consciousness that
such profound change is necessary. Given such an em
phasis, at the ARC meeting tonight, we plan to discuss the
direction we should take now.
There is no lack of issues about which we are concerned.
Nor is there a lack of energy for a successful political
campaign here, as the Food Day activities demonstrated.
But we need your input to know where to concentrate our
efforts, in order to be able to effect a significant change and
at the same time expose the need for much greater social,
economic and political change.
Our experience is limited: we can not possibly know all
the problems that exist within the university. We urge
anyone who is aware of any specific situation that should
be brought to our attention to attend our meeting tonight.
Everyone who wishes to work fora new society is invited.

Earlier in the quarter, the Daily reported that the Al
liance for Radical Change (AI£C) was dead. These reports
are highly exaggerated.
This quarter ARC put time and energy into organizing a
rally and a series of dorm discussions on the subject of
Food Day. We helped to publish an issue of Against the
Grain on the "Politics of Food." These actions were a
beginning, but tonight at our meeting we want to ask
ourselves where do we go from here? All interested people
are invited to attend the meeting at 8 p.m. in Columbae
House.
ARC was formed two years ago as a collection of
"somewhat radical students." Today we call ourselves
radicals. As we look around ourselves, we see a need for
basic change — in personal relationships, in the nation's
socio-economic system, throughout the political and
economic systems of the world, and particularly in the
university.
Common denominator
This year we hope to build the Alliance for Radical
Change as an alliance of the many assorted radicals at
Stanford. as the common denominator of all
Stanford radicals. In the recent Daily election poll. 6 per
cent of the respondents called themselves radical. In addi
tion, there are many students who are beginning to realize
they too are no longer satisfied with the traditional solu
tions.
We see the need to go beyond the patchwork solutions
that are continually proposed. We feel that the remedies to
problems can only be found in changing the conditions
that create them. In this sense, we often find ourselves in
agreement with the objectives of liberals, but believe their

solutions simply will not work.
Neither do we find adequate the responses to society's
problems given hy other students. We refuse to live our
lives as cynics, as so many students do. To blame the
world's difficulties on something as mutable as human
nature, as conservatives do, appears to us a very simplistic
escape. A spiritual solution may satisfy one's personal
needs, but we see little evidence of it helping the many
