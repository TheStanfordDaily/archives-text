# Distribution requirements blamed
## Language enrollment falls 
### Emily Sachar 
Undergraduate enrollment in
introductory level foreign lan
guagt; classes has dropped from
60 percent last fall to4:t percent
this fall. Prof. Alphonse (uilland
of the Department of French and
Italian recently announced to
the Faculty Senate.
"1 attribute this drop to the tact
that, effective this fall, introduc
tory language courses cannot
count toward the distribution
requirement in humanities."
(uilland said.
Under the new requirements,
applicable to students after the
Class of 1979, many foreign lan
guage course in an approved
sequence may be used to fulfill
the humanities requirement, ac
cording to the Academic Infor
mation Center.
At present, there is a discus
sion in the Faculty Senate con

cerning a possible introduction
of a language-math option re
quirement. according to Juil
land. Several years ago. Prof.
Halsey Rovden asked for rein
troduction ot the Western Civili
zation requirement, which was.
in turn,turned down by the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies.
"I'm planning to release a re
port within the next week or 10
days concerning foreign lan
guages at Stanford. My state
ment will include a proposal for
a language requirement of some
type," Juilland said.
Within specific language de
partments. declines vary over
the one year period under con
sideration. From last fall to this
fall both the Russian and Cer
man department suffered a de
cline of 40 per cent, according to
|u iI land. French declined :i5 per
cent, while Spanish dropped
only 12 per cent.
"My idea is that on a national
level. Spanish has always re
mained most constant. Spanish
is also the other native language
of California, as well as the na
tive tongue of many Ameri
cans," Juilland said.
The Italian division is the
only one to show a significant
increase over last year's enroll
ment. This presents a compli
cated situation, according to
(uilland.
"The department has made a
strong effort for Italian students
in opening the Italian theme
house. Their efforts seem to be
paying off. Majors in this de

partment are also increasing."
juilland said.
Within the Classics Depart
ment. Chairman Mark W. Ed
wards noticed a still different
trend.
"There has been no percepti
ble decline in either Latin or
Creek. We certainly haven't suf
fered as much as other depart
ments." he noted.
Enrollment in those languages
has remained .it about 20-24 stu
dents each. Edwards said.
There has. however, been a
drop within third-year courses.
This may be accidental, but it
may be due to the new distribu
tion requirements, according to
Edwards.
"Possibly, there's pressure on
students to fulfill this require
ment by taking a humanities
course or history course: In that
case. I'm a bit worried." Edwards
said.
Overall, Juilland said hehopes
that foreign language enroll
ment would have remained con
stant due to recommendations
made to students through vari
ous mediums, such as bulletins,
rather than requiring a language.
"1 hope it could be incorpo
rated without a requirement," he
said.
The results were obtained
from individual departments,
the Academic Planning Office,
reports from deans and various
other sources.
