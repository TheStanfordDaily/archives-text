# Carlin shows insight
## 
### Russell L. Stockard 
Midway through his act at the Circle Star
Theatre in San Carlos, George Carlin paused to
light a cigarette. The comedian took a couple of
deep drags, exhaled, and made an announcement
to the audience: "You're all going to die. 1 didn't
mean to remind you. but it's on your schedule."
For some reason unknown to this reviewer. Car
lin made no connection between his carcinogenic
action and the inevitability of death, although the
opportunity was staring him in the face.
As a rule, though, Carlin's act made the most of
comedic opportunities, running the gamut from
the standard "Did you ever notice. . technique
to elaborate, philosophical discussions about
words: a comic's slang is violent since success
involves "killing" the audience.
On the other hand, Carlin seemed to steer clear
of much of the biting social commentary Lily
Tomlinuses to great advantage in her act. After an
inordinate amount of time went to the cliches of
feline independence and the grosser aspects of
dog behavior, Carlin reached out for the audience
with his inventive news items. Despite the dis
covery of a vaccine for apathy, he announced, no
one has shown the slightest bit of interest.
Bringing the audience back from the experimen
tal material on death and dying. Carlin did a
thoroughly funny skit about Alexander Graham
Bell. From there, it was a short leap to the meatiest
part of his act: the role of rules in growing up.
Carlin saw a tyranny in language equivalent to
the dictatorial rules relied on by illogical parents
in raising their kids. This was probably theacutist
observation in a performance full of pointed in
sights. Besides, it provided the social maturity the
act implied but too often failed to realize.
Carlin reminded us that parental cliches

abound when children are confronted by the
naked display of authoritarian force, kids know
there is no logic behind an order from a parent
when they hear the parent's explanation: "He
cause I said so."
He seemed to assume the role of a questioning,
clear-headed child confronting authority when he
got around to the subject of the Federal Com
munication Commission's (FCC) attitude toward
obscene and indecent language, a controversy
circulating in part around the playing of one of his
comedy albums over a radio station.
Carl in complained that nowhere does the FCC
provide a list of proscribed words. The comedian
compared the absence of such a federal list with
the non-cooperation of parents in furnishing their
children with a similar dirty word collection be
fore the fact, rather than just giving them
piecemeal.
Carlin then gave the audience his own list,
exhaustively exploring the comedic possibilities
inherent in such an undertaking. The process
sometimes was reminiscent of Lenny Bruce's
exhortations to use dirty words until they lost
their power. However, to conclude that Ceorge
Carlin is merely a latter-day Bruce would be a
severe mistake.
George Carlin sees the power not in words
themselves, dirty or clean, but in the authority
relations symbolized by those bits of meaning. In
castigating the FCC, Carlin is telling us not to lose
the clearheaded skeptical imagination of the child
in us that refuses to accept the orders of authority,
especially authority without justification.
There's a lot of comedy left inside of the man,
and if he continues to develop the socially
oriented parts of his message, everyone on the
receiving end is bound to profit.

exhortations to use dirty words until they lost
their power. However, to conclude that Ceorge
Carlin is merely a latter-day Bruce would be a
severe mistake.
George Carlin sees the power not in words
themselves, dirty or clean, but in the authority
relations symbolized by those bits of meaning. In
castigating the FCC, Carlin is telling us not to lose
the clearheaded skeptical imagination of the child
in us that refuses to accept the orders of authority,
especially authority without justification.
There's a lot of comedy left inside of the man,
and if he continues to develop the socially
oriented parts of his message, everyone on the
receiving end is bound to profit.
Midway through his act at the Circle Star
Theatre in San Carlos, George Carlin paused to
light a cigarette. The comedian took a couple of
deep drags, exhaled, and made an announcement
to the audience: "You're all going to die. 1 didn't
mean to remind you. but it's on your schedule."
For some reason unknown to this reviewer. Car
lin made no connection between his carcinogenic
action and the inevitability of death, although the
opportunity was staring him in the face.
As a rule, though, Carlin's act made the most of
comedic opportunities, running the gamut from
the standard "Did you ever notice. . technique
to elaborate, philosophical discussions about
words: a comic's slang is violent since success
involves "killing" the audience.
On the other hand, Carlin seemed to steer clear
of much of the biting social commentary Lily
Tomlinuses to great advantage in her act. After an
inordinate amount of time went to the cliches of
feline independence and the grosser aspects of
dog behavior, Carlin reached out for the audience
with his inventive news items. Despite the dis
covery of a vaccine for apathy, he announced, no
one has shown the slightest bit of interest.
Bringing the audience back from the experimen
tal material on death and dying. Carlin did a
thoroughly funny skit about Alexander Graham
Bell. From there, it was a short leap to the meatiest
part of his act: the role of rules in growing up.
Carlin saw a tyranny in language equivalent to
the dictatorial rules relied on by illogical parents
in raising their kids. This was probably theacutist
observation in a performance full of pointed in
sights. Besides, it provided the social maturity the
act implied but too often failed to realize.
Carlin reminded us that parental cliches

abound when children are confronted by the
naked display of authoritarian force, kids know
there is no logic behind an order from a parent
when they hear the parent's explanation: "He
cause I said so."
He seemed to assume the role of a questioning,
clear-headed child confronting authority when he
got around to the subject of the Federal Com
munication Commission's (FCC) attitude toward
obscene and indecent language, a controversy
circulating in part around the playing of one of his
comedy albums over a radio station.
Carl in complained that nowhere does the FCC
provide a list of proscribed words. The comedian
compared the absence of such a federal list with
the non-cooperation of parents in furnishing their
children with a similar dirty word collection be
fore the fact, rather than just giving them
piecemeal.
Carlin then gave the audience his own list,
exhaustively exploring the comedic possibilities
inherent in such an undertaking. The process
sometimes was reminiscent of Lenny Bruce's
exhortations to use dirty words until they lost
their power. However, to conclude that Ceorge
Carlin is merely a latter-day Bruce would be a
