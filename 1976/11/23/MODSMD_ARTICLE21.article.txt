# THE
						CINEMA AT STANFORD
## 
### Jeffrey Kimball 
There are a couple of reasons
why this column is devoted
specifically to the cinema, rather
than the arts in general. For one,
it is the easiest of the performing
arts to preview, since individual
performances do not vary. Also,
film is the only art on campus
which receives near-complete
representation on campus, and
within the Palo Alto community
at large.
C ran ted, it would be very nice
to have Herbie Von Karajan and
the Berlin Philharmonic pay
Stanford a visit every, say. Sun
day evening, or have regular
exhibits of Van Gogh and
Toulouse-Lautrec on display in
the Coffee House, but somehow
I'm inclined to believe this not
altogether feasible. And so it is
with the other arts at Stanford —
all except film, where it is not
only possible, but also current
practice to offer the community
the full scope of this art form,
from Fisenstein and Chaplin, to
Codard and Kubrick, and even
experimental cinema.
This unavoidable cir
cumstance creates its own sort
of compensation, however, si nee
the cinema is the consummate
art form. Literature, drama,
music, dance, design and cer
tainly photography are all em
bodied in the film art. The result
of this mixture is the creation of a
synergistic whole: the cinematic
experience, which quite natur
ally. is unique to film alone.
Since tin; understandable
limits of this university do not
allow the student to experience
the full breadth of any other fine
art. there seems to exist an al
most inherent sense of justice in
that the one art which is rep
resented most completely. is that
art which most completely rep
resents the others.
The American Film Theatre of
a few years back was a program
designed to bring world theatre
to every community, through the
medium of film. Producer Fly
Landau's noble intention was
the bringing together of great di
rectors and actors with great
plays. Landau must, very
shortly, have realized that most
of the world's "great" plays had

already been filmed, some of
them quite successfully. Faced
then, with a repertoire of either
mediocre or technically difficult
scripts, he still managed to pro
duce a number of noteworthy,
individual creations, if not an al
together artistically integrated
series.
One of the more worthy pro
ducts of the American Film
Theatre was The Man In The
Oltiss Booth, centering around
the New York trial of a Nazi
commandant, grippingly por
trayed by Maximilian Schell,
the film is a thoroughly sus
penseful examination of the
psychological effects of Nazism
in post-war society. Yet. the film
still suffers from the same limita
tion that plagued the entire
series: it is an embodiment of
theatre more than cinema. Cer
tainly director Arthur Hiller (of
Love Story renown) has integ
rated filmic technique far
beyond merely placing a camera
in front of the stage —however,
he still does not fully employ the
enrichments of photography and
editing, which might have given
the film more artistic integrity.
Nevertheless this is the choice
offering of the week. Tuesday,
Nov. 2!}. 7 & 9:1 B.Cubberlev.

The obscure Italian film, La
Viaecin, directed by Mauro
Bolognini, focuses on a farm
boy's love for a beautiful prosti
tute (Claudia Cardinale, yes!). Its
obscurity precludes the relaying
of any further information.
Tuesday, Nov. 23, 7 & 9:30,
kresge.
Hardly Robert A It man's finest,
but probably his best known
film, Mis this week's
Sunday Flick. Superbly crafted,
if not artistically profound, it is
one of those rare cases of an
overwhelmingly popular film
which offers more than simply
mindless entertainment. Sun
day, Nov. 28, 7 & 9:30, Mem Aud.
Mario Monicelli's The Or
ganizer, with Marcello Mas
troianni in the title role, centers
around union labor efforts in
Italy at the turn of the century.
Monday. Nov. 29, 7:30 only, Jor
dan 040.
And speaking of Italy in the
year 1900, it should not be too
much longer before Bernardo
Bertolucci's newest, 1900, is re
leased in this country. This is the
film which some bold European
critics have been describing as.
quite simply, "the greatest film
ever made."
