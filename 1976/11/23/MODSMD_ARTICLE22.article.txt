# Browne provokes thought

Forget what life used to be
You are what you choose to be
It's whatever it is you see
That life will become
—Jackson Browne
Thursday evening with
Jackson Browne in Santa Clara
was both sadly disconcerting
and triumphantly thought
provoking.
Browne's vast repertoire of
musical portraits which probe
into the elusive fabric of life
were largely left unsung due to
the frustrating composition of
the audience in the University of
Santa Clara gym.
The scene was much like that
of a high school dance. Browne
was preceded by Valerie Carter,
who was accompanied by a
soul/blues band, and Orleans, a
blasting rock 'n' roll machine
which was more than warmly
received by the audience.
Browne was greeted by this
foot-stomping crowd, whose re
ception level had not been
turned down sufficiently to ena
ble them to tune into Browne's
mellow style.
Mild manner
He opened with "The Fuse." a
song from his new album. The
Pretender, followed by "Farther
On," and "For Everyman," on
which he played acoustic guitar
in his mild, subdued manner. It
was not until- he moved to the
piano for "Only Child" that the
audience reluctantly sat down.
By the time he played "Walk
ing Slow." an up-tempo electric:
song from l.cite For The Skv. it

became evident that the audi
ence's previous applause for the
raucous group Orleans was not
mere enthusiasm. Browne con
tinued his accomodating smile
and went into a series of electric
tunes, ending with a subtle but
severe mocking of the crowd's
indiscriminate taste in a spon
taneous song "Sit Down."
"Do you want to hear the band
play with precision and control?
Or did you come to hear the band
play rock and roll?" he sang with
unaffected calm.
Superb musicianship

Browne and lead guitarist David
Lindley. enhanced by the close
rapport between the two men.
may have been lost on the audi
ence. The highlight of the con
cert was Lindley's moving violin
solo on "For A Dancer."
Browne's choice of "The Pre
tender" as the parting song was
more than appropriate. His
posture during the performance
was a perfect exemplification of
his change in attitude since his
earlier works.
The early albums Saturate Be
fore Using, For Everyman and
Late For The Sky. deal mostly
with the disillusionment and
struggle of a sensitive artist.
Adrift on an ocean of loneliness
My dreams like nets ivere thrown
To catch the love that I'd heard
of
In books and films and songs
Now there's a world of illusion
and fantasy
In the place where the real world
belongs

Still I look, for the beauty in
songs
To fill my head and lead me on
Though my dreams have come
up torn and empty
/\s many times as love has come
and gone
Painful absurdities
In "The Pretender." the vul
nerability and idealism of the
young man facing the painful
absurdities of the external world
are absent. He resigns himself to
the alienation and absorbs the
conflicts and contradictions
while maintaining his private
vision and awareness.

Jackson Browne is "The Pre
tender." <111 artist for whom tin 1
former obstacles are now ai -
cepted and indulged. To tin
rowdy crowd that was unable ti
understand, he put his darkglas
ses on. delivered rock and rol
with a smile --- and went homt
undaunted with his three-year
old son and his unsung songs. It
a better world "farther on."
Say <1 prtiyer for the pretendei

his change in attitude since his

Adrift on an ocean of loneliness
My dreams like nets ivere thrown
To catch the love that I'd heard
of
In books and films and songs
Now there's a world of illusion
and fantasy
In the place where the real world
belongs

Still I look, for the beauty in
songs
To fill my head and lead me on
Though my dreams have come
up torn and empty
/\s many times as love has come
and gone
Painful absurdities
In "The Pretender." the vul
nerability and idealism of the
young man facing the painful
absurdities of the external world
are absent. He resigns himself to
the alienation and absorbs the
conflicts and contradictions
while maintaining his private
vision and awareness.

Jackson Browne is "The Pre

Thursday evening with
Jackson Browne in Santa Clara
was both sadly disconcerting
and triumphantly thought
provoking.
Browne's vast repertoire of
musical portraits which probe
into the elusive fabric of life
were largely left unsung due to
the frustrating composition of
the audience in the University of
Santa Clara gym.
The scene was much like that
of a high school dance. Browne
was preceded by Valerie Carter,
who was accompanied by a
soul/blues band, and Orleans, a
blasting rock 'n' roll machine
which was more than warmly
received by the audience.
Browne was greeted by this
foot-stomping crowd, whose re
ception level had not been
turned down sufficiently to ena
ble them to tune into Browne's
mellow style.
Mild manner
He opened with "The Fuse." a
song from his new album. The
Pretender, followed by "Farther
On," and "For Everyman," on
which he played acoustic guitar
in his mild, subdued manner. It
was not until- he moved to the
piano for "Only Child" that the
audience reluctantly sat down.
By the time he played "Walk
