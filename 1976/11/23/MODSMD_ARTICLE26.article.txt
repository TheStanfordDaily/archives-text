1 he university grossed in excess ot
$200.000 on its University Press auc
tion held last Friday, according to )im
(-1 as p ill. investment recovery
specialist for the university.
It was a little bit better than ex
pected, said CUaspil 1. "Everything in
the way of press materials was sold."
I here were about 985 individual sales
including such items as linotypes,
light tables, and other printing equip
ment, Claspill indicated.
I he auction was the result of a deci
sion last April to shut down the print
ing division of the University Press,
rather than pay .in estimated $1 mill
ion required to replace its outmoded
printing system, according to Univer

sitv Counsel tor Employe Relations
Doug Barton. The press had been
operating on a slow "hot type" system
in whir.h type is set by bulky linotype
machines.
Most printers now use a computer
operated phototvpesetting system,
which is taster and more efficient. Be
cause electronic printing technology
advances on ( i week-to-week basis and
demand for the press' printing services
had been on a steady decline, the press
has decided to contract out all its print
ing needs.
The press will continue to publish
scholarly works, according to Press Di
rector Leon Seltzer, but the books will
be typeset and printed elsewhere.
The press was begun in the late 19th
century when J.A. Quelle, a student,
diil joh printing for university students
and faculty with one platen press.
April's decision to close the shop
took effect at the beginning of this
quarter: the last employe left three
weeks ago. Most of the linotype
operators were able to find alternate
employment, but not at the same kind
of job. Few printers still use the cum
bersome machines. The press will now
serve only as a publishing house, ac
cording to Seltzer.
