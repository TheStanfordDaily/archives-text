## special ski supplement, the stanford daily, nov. 23 
### Peter Arnstein 
Downhill skiing has come a long way since
ski pioneer John "Snowshoe" Thompson
traversed the Sierras in the 1860s on 10 foot
oak skis, loaded down with United States
mail.
Modern ski resorts, space-age equipment,
and improved transportation have enabled a
tremendously increasing number of en
thusiasts to escape to winter wonderlands to
participate in one of America's fastest ex
panding recreational activities. Skiing's
popularity can be attributed to the numerous
allurements it offers people regardless of
their tastes, ability or values, although a pre
requisite for modern downhill skiing is a
substantial amount of money.
Freud, had he analyzed Olympic downhill
champion Franz Klammer flashing down the
Austrian Alps, might have viewed the attrac
tion of skiing as an attempt to realize the
death wish. Or he might have considered skis
as an extension of the male sex organ, and
concluded that females strap on a pair of five
footers because of envy.
Many, certainly, are drawn to God's hoary
playground by the sheer physical thrill of
hurtling down a bowl at breakneck speeds,
negotiating a forboding field of man-size

moguls with effortless elan, or gliding knee
deep through a stretch of untracked powder
surrounding by a spectacular winter land
scape.
Apres-ski activity appeals to expert and
novice skiers alike. A quiet evening in front
of the fireside with a bottle of Canadian Club
to heal the days' bodily abuses can be as en
joyable as a night out on the town drinking,
dancing and enjoying Nevada's casino life,
ice skating or tobagganing in near-silence on
a moonlit incline.
Recently spawned, freestyle skiing is one
of the major reasons for the sport's upsurge.
Average ski lengths have dropped from 215
centimeters for an average size male a few
years ago to anywhere from 160 to 195 cen
timeters today. Shorter skis not only enable
beginners to learn quickly, but give rise to
flashy freestyle "hot-dogging" involving ac
robatic jumps, ski-ballet and high-speed
mogul-bashing.
"Most of the customers who walk in to the
store are pointed toward freestyle, whether
they are six or 60," says Dave Wilkinson, who
recently opened Skis n' Such on the El
Camino in Los Altos. "They just want to look
and feel hot and free on the slopes."

rancy sknng has given rise to
fancy apparel and equipment.
Improvements in synthetic
manufacturing have resulted in
a slew of space-age. skin-tight
ski wear items seemingly de
signed through the joint efforts
of David Bowie and Mick Jagger.
Bright color-coordinated outfits
are becoming increasingly
popular and increasingly expen
sive, rangi ng i n price from $80 to
$170 and more. Popular among
hot-doggers are "hot-skins":
pants so paper-thin and skin
tight that they reveal a man's re
ligion. Over-the-boot stretch
pants, form-fitting jumpsuits
and down vests are very vog
uish. Skis, boots and poles come
in a variety of eye-catching col
ors brazenly displayed the man
ufacturer's name and logotype. A
top pair of skis may cost from
$160 to $260. boots sell for $100
to $190 and more, and a good
pair of bindings runs about $90.
The Population
Every ski resort has a pseudo
i ndigent indigenous population.
Typically, these creatures "work
construction" in the summer,
and through transgressions of
HEW regulations manage to col
lect enough unemployment
compensation during the winter
to equip themselves with the
newest ski gear and a season lift
pass. To locate one on the slopes,
look for an amoral male in his
20s with a high skiing ability, a
carefree demeanor, and an unre
served contempt tor weekend
skiers.
Little kids generally stick to
;he bunny hills while develop
ng their technique. Yet every
older skier negotiating a peril
ously steep slope with an ettort

he feels is relative ease has had
his ego blown to smithereens
when some pint-size prepubes
cent schussboomer in pre
nascent tuck position flies past
headed straight down the fall
line. airborn from mogul-top to
mogul-top. with only a crash
helmet to protect him from cer
tain premature death.
Ski bunnies
Ski bunnies are easy to pick
out. If you have trouble (if you
are one go to next paragraph),
while standing in the lift line,
observe where most of the post
adolescent male heads are
turned. The object of their atten
tion will be stuffed into a
bright-colored jump suit that
looks like it was spray painted
on. She will most likely be spew
ing out banalities directed to
ward her escort, to which he will
play little attention, for he is
primarily interested in her non
conversational assets.
For all its attractions.down

hill skiing is avoided by the
fast-growing number of cross
country skiers who object to
downhill's astronomical prices,
crowded lift lines, and superfi
cial social whirl. Cross-country
equipment is comparatively
cheap — a complete outfit costs
about $100. crowds and lift lines
are non-existent, and beauty and
serenity surround the nordic
skier.
Whatever type of skiing one
prefers, both downhill and
cross-countrv skiing offer an es
cape from the burgeoning met
ropolis. an outlet for exercise,
and the opportunity to com
mune with Mother Natureand or
fellow skiing enthusiasts. It he
were still alive. Snowshoe
Thompson would give a hardy
Sierra alpine yell upon observ
ing the vast popularity of the
sport he introduced to the Un
ited States. He might even trim
his 10 foot "Swedish snow
shoes" down to 1 70centimeters.

Bright color-coordinated outfits
are becoming increasingly

Modern ski resorts, space-age equipment,
and improved transportation have enabled a
tremendously increasing number of en
thusiasts to escape to winter wonderlands to
participate in one of America's fastest ex

Freud, had he analyzed Olympic downhill
champion Franz Klammer flashing down the

concluded that females strap on a pair of five
footers because of envy.
Many, certainly, are drawn to God's hoary

scape.
Apres-ski activity appeals to expert and
novice skiers alike. A quiet evening in front

Average ski lengths have dropped from 215

Downhill skiing has come a long way since
ski pioneer John "Snowshoe" Thompson
traversed the Sierras in the 1860s on 10 foot
oak skis, loaded down with United States
mail.
Modern ski resorts, space-age equipment,
and improved transportation have enabled a
tremendously increasing number of en
thusiasts to escape to winter wonderlands to
participate in one of America's fastest ex
panding recreational activities. Skiing's
popularity can be attributed to the numerous
allurements it offers people regardless of
their tastes, ability or values, although a pre
requisite for modern downhill skiing is a
substantial amount of money.
Freud, had he analyzed Olympic downhill
champion Franz Klammer flashing down the
Austrian Alps, might have viewed the attrac

death wish. Or he might have considered skis
as an extension of the male sex organ, and
concluded that females strap on a pair of five
footers because of envy.
Many, certainly, are drawn to God's hoary
playground by the sheer physical thrill of
hurtling down a bowl at breakneck speeds,
negotiating a forboding field of man-size

moguls with effortless elan, or gliding knee

surrounding by a spectacular winter land
scape.
Apres-ski activity appeals to expert and
novice skiers alike. A quiet evening in front
of the fireside with a bottle of Canadian Club
to heal the days' bodily abuses can be as en
joyable as a night out on the town drinking,
dancing and enjoying Nevada's casino life,
ice skating or tobagganing in near-silence on

Recently spawned, freestyle skiing is one
of the major reasons for the sport's upsurge.
Average ski lengths have dropped from 215
centimeters for an average size male a few
years ago to anywhere from 160 to 195 cen
timeters today. Shorter skis not only enable
beginners to learn quickly, but give rise to
flashy freestyle "hot-dogging" involving ac
robatic jumps, ski-ballet and high-speed
mogul-bashing.
"Most of the customers who walk in to the
store are pointed toward freestyle, whether
they are six or 60," says Dave Wilkinson, who
recently opened Skis n' Such on the El
Camino in Los Altos. "They just want to look
and feel hot and free on the slopes."

Bright color-coordinated outfits
are becoming increasingly
popular and increasingly expen
sive, rangi ng i n price from $80 to

hot-doggers are "hot-skins":
pants so paper-thin and skin

The Population
Every ski resort has a pseudo

construction" in the summer,

Little kids generally stick to

Ski bunnies are easy to pick
