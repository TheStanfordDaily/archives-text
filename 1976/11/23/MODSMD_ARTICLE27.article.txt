Downhill skiing has come a long way since
ski pioneer John "Snowshoe" Thompson
traversed the Sierras in the 1860s on 10 foot
oak skis, loaded down with United States
mail.
Modern ski resorts, space-age equipment,
and improved transportation have enabled a
tremendously increasing number of en
thusiasts to escape to winter wonderlands to
participate in one of America's fastest ex
panding recreational activities. Skiing's
popularity can be attributed to the numerous
allurements it offers people regardless of
their tastes, ability or values, although a pre
requisite for modern downhill skiing is a
substantial amount of money.
Freud, had he analyzed Olympic downhill
champion Franz Klammer flashing down the
Austrian Alps, might have viewed the attrac
tion of skiing as an attempt to realize the
death wish. Or he might have considered skis
as an extension of the male sex organ, and
concluded that females strap on a pair of five
footers because of envy.
Many, certainly, are drawn to God's hoary
playground by the sheer physical thrill of
hurtling down a bowl at breakneck speeds,
negotiating a forboding field of man-size

moguls with effortless elan, or gliding knee
deep through a stretch of untracked powder
surrounding by a spectacular winter land
scape.
Apres-ski activity appeals to expert and
novice skiers alike. A quiet evening in front
of the fireside with a bottle of Canadian Club
to heal the days' bodily abuses can be as en
joyable as a night out on the town drinking,
dancing and enjoying Nevada's casino life,
ice skating or tobagganing in near-silence on
a moonlit incline.
Recently spawned, freestyle skiing is one
of the major reasons for the sport's upsurge.
Average ski lengths have dropped from 215
centimeters for an average size male a few
years ago to anywhere from 160 to 195 cen
timeters today. Shorter skis not only enable
beginners to learn quickly, but give rise to
flashy freestyle "hot-dogging" involving ac
robatic jumps, ski-ballet and high-speed
mogul-bashing.
"Most of the customers who walk in to the
store are pointed toward freestyle, whether
they are six or 60," says Dave Wilkinson, who
recently opened Skis n' Such on the El
Camino in Los Altos. "They just want to look
and feel hot and free on the slopes."
