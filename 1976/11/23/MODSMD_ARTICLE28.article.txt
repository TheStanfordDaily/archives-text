# Cross country: A better way
## 
### 
Within the past five years,
ski touring has de
veloped in popularity from an
activity enjoyed by a few to
something that is capturing the
imagination of Americans across
the country.
There is no single "right"
equipment or "right" type of clo
thing tor cross country skiing.
Generally speaking, one choses
his equipment by the kinds of
terrain skied, skiing ability and
length of tours. The cost of skis,
boots and poles is approximately
$100.
Although some skiers wear
knickers in the style of the old
Nordic skiers, anything is ac
ceptable on the trail Because
much energy is exerted, a heavy
sweater, jeans, mittens and a hat
are all that is needed for one who
plans an afternoon outing. Many
skiers preter to start out with a
couple of layers of clothing and
peel them off as they work up a
sweat.
One can learn to cross country
ski in one day Ski touring in all
its forms is similar to walking in
all its forms. Any difficulties one
may have learning the basic
stride will only arise because of
an unfamiliarity with skis.
Whole body
Cross country skiing uses al
most all of the body's major
muscle groups —arms. legs,
back, abdomen, chest. Ski tour

ing. therefore, is an all-around
conditioner.
When major muscle groups
are at work, the body's internal
organs are also working at a cor
responding rate. Each skier can
seek his own level of fitness de
pending on the amount of activ
ity in which he engages.
Touring is adaptable. It can be
anything one cares to make it. It
is suitable for families with
small children who want a short
outing of an hour's duration. It
also can be an extended physical
experience for those who want to
ski over rough terrain for miles
on trips lasting several days.
Places
Each person has his favorite
place to cross country ski. Mid
westerners ski on golt courses.
Those west of the Rockies use
hiking trails and mountain
paths. In some locales a host of
more formal developments have
emerged. In addition to serving
downhill skiers, ski areas are
now appealing to cross country
skiers with groomed trails,
guide services and patrolled
routes generally centered in a
downhill area with the idea of
bringing the skier back to the
lodge for lunch.
Cross country skiing is for the
independent individual. It can
almost be considered a sport for
the anti-social. Rather than fight
ing long lift lines, watching out
for others or hanging out at the

lodge with drink in hand, a cross
country skier has time to absorb
his environment.
Many advanced tourers spend
weekends winter camping —
treking through the woods on
cross country skis instead of
snow shoes. An advanced tourer
is a person at home and comfort
able in a winter environment,
secure in his knowledge and in
his ability to negotiate himself
through all terrain and situa
tions without dependence on
other tourers or outside indi

viduals or organizations. This
aptitude, coupled with the
philosophy of freedom and in
dependence. embraces the root
appeal of the sport.
Ski touring has no parallel in
winter outdoor activities. It can
be done wherever there is snow.
It's discovering a city park or ski
ing up an old logging road. For
some it's going directly on to the
next ski lodge. It's anything you
want to make it. But most of all.
it's the contact of man with his
natural surroundings.

Cross country skiing can be
lots of fun — but it can also be
lots of work. But nothing can
quite compare with getting out
at the crack of dawn to trek
through unbroken snow.
These students did just that,
making a day-long trip
through the hills and forest
near Big Sky, at Bozeman,
Montana.
