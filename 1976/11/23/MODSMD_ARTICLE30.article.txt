# Winter Equinox: Movie for hot doggers
## 
### 
Hot dog ski tans have a great chance to see some real action
this winter — even if you never make it to the slopes. It
comes in the form of Winter Equinox, a film by William
Burks. This film takes its three young stars through the paces
of aerials, moguls and ballet skiing.
The film, in its weakest part, also delves into the private
IK es of the three. Not much can be said tor the mushy scenes
and deliberate flaunting that result.
But despite these interruptions, the ti lm offers some really
stunning scenes and the photography of the Tahoe area. If
you're a fan of the hot style — don't miss it.
