# Ski: It's not where, but how
## 
### Bruce Turner 
What's the best way to go ski
ing? "The best way?
You mean there's more than one?"
"Of course there's more than one.
There's as many ways to go skiing
as there are women at Stanford."
"Oh. You were joking. . . You
want to go skiing?"
"Yeah, how shall we go? My pa
rents will be at Tahoe this weekend,
or we could stay at the slopes in the
lodge, or rent a condomin —"
"You don't rent those, you use 'em only—"
"No man. they're like an apartment, only more
expensive."
"You mean like a Palo Alto massage is more
expensive than a San Jose massage. They both get
you —"
"I like the condominium idea myself. C.et ,i bunch of
us together, some wine, smokers, food and sleeping
bags and have a ball!"
"Literally, I hope. . .

Silence. Some redhot is typing a paper next door.
The rest of the dorm is quiet, all in bed with visions ol
sugar plums squirming in their heads.
"Thanksgiving weekend?"
"It's okay if you like crowds. I went up to Heavenly
with my high school ski club anil we rented an entire
condominium building. The bus driver went out and
got us all beer. Great time. man. Everybody wasted for
the next day. Uitchin' skiing, and you gel to meet a lot of
people of the opposite sex."
"You mean women?"
"For me yes. for you I'm not so sure."
"Does Stanford have a Ski Club?"
"Yeah, but they're pretty unorganized right now.
Wait til they get it together."
"What can we do?"
"Buy the Queen Mary and dock at South Tahoe. .
"Very clever. Pass the telephone book . . . and the
pipe."
Now really
Hold it. How many ways ore there to go skiing?
There are a number and they all cost money, so pass
the hat.
The worst way to go skiing, although the cheapest, is
to go to a place within driving distance the day you ski.
Waking up early, bundling up in your woolies and
sitting i 11 the car to get to Dodge Ridge for a day's skiing
on Thursday-with-no-classes is not really skiing, but it
does bring back memories of when your lather couldn't
afford anv other way.

The best way to hit the slopes is to create .1 long
weekend in the middle of the week, assemhlea group of
best buddies, rent a cabin and ski your boots of! 'til you
long for the physical comfort of indoor sports. No
crowds, few hassles, great camaraderie, sore muscles
and fantastic skiing.
With the family
Falling in the middle of the spectrum are weeks dur
ing Christmas or spring breaks spent with the family.
These are great because Pop usually pi< ks up the tab and
vou can ski to your heart's content. The drawbacks in
clude the fa< t that vour little sister won't ski as well as
you will and your parents get tired too quit klv and you
can't use drugs. Nice trade-off. huh?
Also in the middle of the spectrum are weekends at
Tahoe. Whether you rent a cabin with vour house
cramming 2f> bodies into a place that "sleeps eight " or
you go up with a friend and stay in .111 old acquain
tance's apartment 111 South Tahoe you will encounter
the 1 rowds of Hay Area turkeys gobbling up the slopes
and turning all that powder into impossible moguls. Hut
what you will also run into is good skiing, which is the
point of the whole thing anyway.
After years of skiing the best and worst places in the
West, or the small hills of tin 1 Midwest, or the frozen
killer hills on the edge ol the eastern Megalopolis, a
good skier learns that its all in his head. He can have a
good timeanvwhere. but he would prefer Snowbird on .1
snowed in weekday. ..

as there are women at Stanford."
"Oh. You were joking. . . You
want to go skiing?"
"Yeah, how shall we go? My pa
rents will be at Tahoe this weekend,
or we could stay at the slopes in the
lodge, or rent a condomin —"
"You don't rent those, you use 'em only—"
"No man. they're like an apartment, only more
expensive."
"You mean like a Palo Alto massage is more
expensive than a San Jose massage. They both get
you —"
"I like the condominium idea myself. C.et ,i bunch of
us together, some wine, smokers, food and sleeping
bags and have a ball!"
"Literally, I hope. . .

Silence. Some redhot is typing a paper next door.
The rest of the dorm is quiet, all in bed with visions ol
sugar plums squirming in their heads.
"Thanksgiving weekend?"
"It's okay if you like crowds. I went up to Heavenly
with my high school ski club anil we rented an entire
condominium building. The bus driver went out and
got us all beer. Great time. man. Everybody wasted for
the next day. Uitchin' skiing, and you gel to meet a lot of
people of the opposite sex."
"You mean women?"
"For me yes. for you I'm not so sure."
"Does Stanford have a Ski Club?"
"Yeah, but they're pretty unorganized right now.
Wait til they get it together."
"What can we do?"
"Buy the Queen Mary and dock at South Tahoe. .
"Very clever. Pass the telephone book . . . and the
pipe."
Now really
Hold it. How many ways ore there to go skiing?
There are a number and they all cost money, so pass
the hat.
The worst way to go skiing, although the cheapest, is
to go to a place within driving distance the day you ski.
Waking up early, bundling up in your woolies and
sitting i 11 the car to get to Dodge Ridge for a day's skiing
on Thursday-with-no-classes is not really skiing, but it
does bring back memories of when your lather couldn't
afford anv other way.

The best way to hit the slopes is to create .1 long
weekend in the middle of the week, assemhlea group of
best buddies, rent a cabin and ski your boots of! 'til you
long for the physical comfort of indoor sports. No
crowds, few hassles, great camaraderie, sore muscles
and fantastic skiing.
With the family
Falling in the middle of the spectrum are weeks dur
ing Christmas or spring breaks spent with the family.
These are great because Pop usually pi< ks up the tab and
vou can ski to your heart's content. The drawbacks in
clude the fa< t that vour little sister won't ski as well as
you will and your parents get tired too quit klv and you
can't use drugs. Nice trade-off. huh?
Also in the middle of the spectrum are weekends at
Tahoe. Whether you rent a cabin with vour house
cramming 2f> bodies into a place that "sleeps eight " or
you go up with a friend and stay in .111 old acquain
tance's apartment 111 South Tahoe you will encounter
the 1 rowds of Hay Area turkeys gobbling up the slopes
and turning all that powder into impossible moguls. Hut
what you will also run into is good skiing, which is the
point of the whole thing anyway.
After years of skiing the best and worst places in the
West, or the small hills of tin 1 Midwest, or the frozen
killer hills on the edge ol the eastern Megalopolis, a
good skier learns that its all in his head. He can have a
good timeanvwhere. but he would prefer Snowbird on .1
snowed in weekday. ..
