# Ski teams set to schuss, then win

Although rarely recognized at the Farm, the Stanford
Ski Team has compiled an enviable record over the past
few years, consistently finishing near the top of its con
ference. This year should prove to be the best ever for
Stanford's men's team, which lost only one ot its com
petitors to graduation last year.
Since nearly every ski meet last year was cancelled
due to the California snow drought, the skiers are anxi
ous for a chance to compete again this winter quarter,
their goal being improvement upon their record of two
years ago. That year the men's team finished second in
the Pacific Coast College Championships, freshman
Dave Herbert winning the downhill while sophomore
Tom Hutton placed third in the slalom. Stanford, along
with Nevada-Reno, qualified for the NCAA Champion
ships in Colorado, where Stanford placed 14th.
This year senior Hutton and junior Herbert, along
with junior kit Weld and fifth year student David Horth.

who red shirted last year, will again form the basis of the
men's alpine team.
Stanford's nordic team is led by Steve l.indbeck. a
cross country specialist from Alaska who learned to ski
in order to travel from igloo to school each morning.
Although the nordic events have traditionally been
Stanford's weakness. Lindbeck has been training hard
all fall with fellow "runners" and jumpers Ed Frank. Kit
Weld, Rusty Schwartz and Dave Herbert, and expects to
havea strong team this year. Since the overall point total
collegiate ski competition gives equal weight to slalom,
giant slalom, jumping and cross country, a good per
formance in the nordic events is crucial in winning a
meet.
The women's team, which competes in slalom, giant
slalom and cross country, will be comprised almost
entirely of new members this year, having lost most of
its former stars to graduation. However. Stanford seems

to succeed in producing an excellent women's team
each year.
One major blow to the ski team this year has been
the announcement by Coach Skip Stritter that he will be
leaving Stanford at the end of fall quarter, having com
pleted his doctoral studies in computer science. The
mere existence, let alone success, of the Stanford ski
program is due greatly to the personal efforts made by
Stritter over the past five years.
Assuming that Stritter can actually bring himself to
leave the Farm, coaching duties will be handled this
year by Tom Hutton and former ski team member Mike
iker. Steve Lindbeck has been elected men's nordic cap
tain, while men's and women's alpine captains are yet
to be announced. Stanford students interested in either
joining the ski team or renting a bed at the team's Lake
Tahoe cabin should attend weekly team meetings in the
Alpha Sig living room. Tuesdays at 7:30 p.m.
