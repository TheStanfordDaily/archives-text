# Outside: New from Rolling Stone
## 
### 
The ski slopes are
crowded, crawling with
bunnies and bombers* slippers
and sliders and a few genuine
schussers. Lift lines stretch
back for seemingly endless dis
tances. and the whole lodge
seems to be packed with frozen
humanity.
But the exploding popularity
of outdoor sports hasn't been
confined to the ski crowd. Oh no.
Everyone wants to get outside, to
be next to the earth. The hippy
organic fads of years past have
blossomed into a lemming-like
charge into the wilderness. Na
tional parks and preserves, for
merly the domain of Boy Scouts
and small animals, groan under
the onslaught of harried re
fugees from the cities and sub
urbs.
In the interest of reaching this
audience of budding mountain
types. Rolling Stone, publishers
of the biweekly new journalism
bible, will come out this spring
with a new magazine, Outside.
Disappointing
A preview of Outside was in
cluded in the Dec. 2 issue of Rol
ling Stone. The preview issue
was a bit disappointing, but
space limitations did cramp the
style of the feature according to
Harriet Fier. who edited the pre
view.
According to Fier. the regular
Outside will be a slick magazine
format, and will probably cost
about a dollar per copy. It will
feature articles on all outdoor ac
tivities and also on the environ
ment. travel and equipment.
Regular departments will deal
with building in the wild, eating

off the land and ecology law.
Outside will be edited by Will
Hearst, and Rolling Stone regu
lars Tim Cahill and Michael
Rodgers will be frequent con
tributors. According to Fier. the
magazine will be different from
Rolling Stone, but will "feature
the good writing from Rolling
Stone, and still be serious about
the environment."
Natural
Rolling Stone made the ex
pansion to Outside because "it
seemed natural. Everyone has
more leisure, and people are in
terested in getting into the envi
ronment and doing it in an intel
ligent way. They want to enjoy it

without destroying it," Fier said.
The supplement in Rolling
Stone was weak in several spots.
The section on equipment really
didn't say much, and seemed a
spoof on the whole outdoors
movement. But there were sev
eral bright spots, notably the ar
ticle on mountain climbing by
Tim Cahill and the "Secrets of
Winter Survival" by Janet Hop
son.
Despite the shortcomings of
the preview. Outside should
prove to be just what Hoi ling
Stone wants â€”a serious
magazine about being and living
outside which manages to be
well written, too. Watch for it in
the spring.
