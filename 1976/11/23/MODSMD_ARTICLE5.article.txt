# Accident keeps water pure

Over-fluoridated water could have
spread to most of the academic build
ings on campus and some of the west
ern housing units last Tuesday had it
not been for two simultaneous
mechanical accidents, according to
Anthony Sidlow, manager of safety
and health.
Sidlow said that had a high pressure
water valve not jammed open, the
lower pressure fluoridated water
could have spread, but would proba
bly have been diluted to a lower con
centration. The amount of fluoride in

the water would still have been higher
than normal.
According to Sidlow, the water sys
tem in the western part of campus con
sists of an 80 pounds per square inch
(psi) line and a fluoridated 55 psi line.
The fluoride addition is controlled by
an electronic sensor.
"The system under 80 psi tended to
keep it (the fluoridated water) in the
western region. Physics, Stauffer
(chemistry building), and the ar
boretum area . . . occasionally there is
some debris (in the water) near the
electronic sensor," said Sidlow. He
added that some "organic matter" had
jammed the sensor in the ooen oosi
tion. causing a continual flow of
fluoride to enter the water.
lammed trash
Joe kerrington of Plant Services said
that the high pressure valve had jam
med open because of "a piece of trash
caught in the line."
Sidlow said the water was being
sampled and analyzed three times a
day. However, |ason Mavis, director of
Plant Services, said they were not
aware of the overfluoridation until
complaints had been received. Sidlow
said the water is now being sampled 10
to 12 times daily.
Mavis said. "There was a mechani
cal failure in fluoridation, but not a
sufficient amount was released to
cause severe illness. The station was
shot down and was corrected ... the
electromechanical device is really
quite simple. We just have to make
sure it is properly operating. It's appa
rently wiser to use continual detec
tion."
Monitoring system
According to Mavis, a monitoring
system maybe installed to continually
inspect the water.
"We are looking into an alarm sys

tern. It would be installed at the fluori
dation stations so if it (fluoride con
tent) exceeds the limit, an alarm would
ring," said Mavis.
According to Sidlow, a timer will
also be installed to regulate the
fluoride addition.
Cy Stein, graduate student in
chemistry, and Penny kury, a postdoc
toral fellow in chemistry and im
munology, said they had made several
calls to Plant Services and the Safety
and Health offices Tuesday afternoon
between 3 p.m. and 5.15 p.m. tocomp
