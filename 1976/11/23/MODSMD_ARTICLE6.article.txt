### Chris Baker 
Amid speculation that the same
group of alumni who pushed for Jack
Christiansen's scalp as head football
coach is now seeking the ouster of Ath
letic Director Joe Ruetz, the administ
ration came to Ruetz' defense yester
day.
In a joint statement issued hy Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig and Arthur Kates, chair
man of the Stanford Athletic Hoard.
Ruetz was given a vote of support.
"We wish to make it clear that the
athletic director's decision to make a
change in football coaches at Stanford
was made with the consultation and
full concurrence of the president's of
fice and the Stanford Athletic Hoard.
"We also wish to emphasize that the
athletic director has unqualified and
continuing support of the university
and the athletic board in his efforts to
achieve excellence in the athletic
program at Stanford," they said.
Under fire
Ruetz has allegedly come under fire
because he signed Christiansen to a
five-year contract in 1974 without
seeking the approval of the Stanford
Athletic Board. The contract was ap
proved by President Richard Lyman.
Critics have also charged that Ruetz
was responsible for Stanford's four
game home schedule this year and that
he did not handle the Christiansen
dismissal properly.
"1 don't feel I'm under any pres
sure," said Ruetz last night. "I think
they (the athletic board and
Rosenzweig) were concerned about
some of the stories that have appeared
in the local media."
Hot water
The Palo AI to Times reported
Saturday afternoon that Ruetz was "in
hot water" because of his style in the
firing of Christiansen.
Ruetz has other things to do besides
worry about newspaper reports —
namely, finding a new head football
coach.
A search committee will be ap
pointed this week to screen and inter
view candidates for the job. The com
mittee will be composed of members of
the athletic board, university ad
ministration, athletic department and
Buck Club (a fund-raising organiza

tion for Stanford sports), as well as a
graduating senior student-athlete.
Ruetz is in the process of meeting
with Christiansen's seven assistants. It
is rumored that three staff members —
defensive coordinator Norb Hecker,
running back coach Dave Currey and
receivers coach Pete kattela have
applied for the top spot.
However, sources indicate that only
one assistant will be retained by the
new coach. Offensive line coach Doug
Single, who was in charge of recruit
ing, is being seen as the man to coordi
nate recruiting efforts at least until the
new coach is named next month.
Ruetz said Friday that he hopes to
have a new coach named by Christmas
and that the search would be an open
one. I le also added that all the current
assistants would be invited to apply
for the head coaching job.
Aggressive young coach
But speculation is circulating that
the athletic board, an advisory group
to Lyman and Ruetz which is com
posed of 30 members, including at
least 2H alumni, would like an aggres
sive young coach and would like to go
outside the program.
Sunday. Suntu Ann Register sports
editor Eddie West reported that former
Stanford head coach John Ralston,
now with the Denver Broncos, might
be interested in returning to the Farm.
More likely candidates include USC
quarterback assistant Paul Hackett,
who helped Trojan quarterback Vince
Evans improve his poor passing statis
tics this year.
Cal defensive coordinator Roger
Theder, a former Stanford assistant
under Ralston, has been mentioned for
the job. but sources say that Theder
may want to follow Bear head coach
Mike White to tin; NFL, il White, pere
nially rumored to be leaving Cal for a
pro post, decides to make the switch.
Another possibility is UCLA
linebacker coach jed Hughes, who
coached at Stanford during the Rose
Bowl years.
And Christiansen? He hopes to re
turn to the NFL as an assistant. "I guess
everybody has secondary plans for
themselves." said Christiansen, "and
I'm thinking about working as an assis
tant coach in the pros or maybe as a
west coast scout for some club."
