# Council hears cyclists' plea

"Bicycles are not balloon-tired, chrome-plated toys for
children on their birthdays," Benjamin Lefkowitz told the
Palo Alto city council last night, and last night's outpour
ing of public sentiment demonstrated beyond a doubt the
respect which two-wheeled travel is accorded in this
community.
Twenty-five community residents told the council their
reaction to the Palo Alto Planning Commission's final
recommendations for the Comprehensive Plan, contained
in a report submitted to the council last night. The council
has 40 days to review the recommendations before voting
to adopt the plan as the official guide to future develop
ment in Palo Alto.
Citizens who spoke at last night's regular council meet
ing endorsed the planners' recommendation to reinstate
three bicycle programs which were deleted from the plan
by the council last month. The programs call for the de
velopment of bicycle boulevards, removal of traffic bar
riers to bicycle travel and provision and requirement of
parking facilities.
"It's time that serious thought is given to providing

alternatives to the automobile." declared Ellen Fletcher,
an outspoken bicycle enthusiast.
One resident hailed Palo Alio as a "pioneer" in innova
tive bicycle planning, while another urged the council to
"continue this tradition" by insuring safety and providing
adequate parking facilities for cyclists.
"The bicycle is about 13 times as energy-efficient as the
automobile," said Lefkowitz, while Fletcher claimed
that 18 bicycles can fit into one automobile parking space.
A second program which aroused support from the au
dience would extend use of traffic diverters in residential
neighborhoods. These systems, such as the one in College
Terrace, reroute through traffic from residential streets.
Several citizens voiced their support of the planner's
recommendation to restore language deleted by the coun
cil which read "to decrease dependence on the au
tomobile." The council had substituted the wording, "to
increase efficient use of the automobile."
The only action taken by the council last night was
unanimous approval of 13 "non-substantive" recommen
dations from the planning commission. The council
began discussion of the remaining 19 "substantive" items,
including the bicycle measures.
