# Voter satisfaction retained McCloskey
## 
### Alex Alben News Analysis (First of two ports) 
The decisive factor in the 12th dis
trict congressional race proved to he
the electorate's satisfaction with in
cumbent Paul ("Pete") McCloskey Jr.
despite the appeal of challenger David
Harris.
In the campaign between the two ar
ticulate and independent men. four
distinct factors emerged that signific
antly shaped the campaign. To begin
with, the contest could have been radi
cally different had McCloskey faced
businessman Gordor Knapp in the
Republican primary; Knapp had
mounted two strong challenges
against him in the past. Before that
stage of the campaign, however. Knapp
was named to a government post by
President Gerald Ford.
A second integral part of the contest
was the strategy of I larris forces to de
bunk McCloskey's "maverick" image,
which they maintained had faded due
to the representative's close associa
tion with policies of the Ford ad
ministration.
A series of debates helped to confirm
that charge, while revealing the diver
gent styles of the two men. These de
bates played the third major role in the
contest and the opposing camps disag
ree in judging the magnitude of their
impact.
Media blitz
Finally, a media blitz by McCloskey
sewed up his sixth election effort de

spite a growing Harris drive in the last
month of the race.
Because McCloskey won by such a
large margin, gaining f>H percent of the
vote, the possibility that he might not
have made it through the Republican
primary is generally ignored. Mow
ever. had Cordon Knapp decided to
run against the incumbent, the
Harris/McCloskey contest might never
have materialized.
Knapp, a right-wing Reagan Repub
lican, had run a close race against the
more liberal McCloskey in 1972. In
1974 Knapp mounted a stronger chal
lenge and lost by a scant 800 votes,
defeated mainly by a drive by Stanford
Democrats to register Republican.
In this election, however, the Knapp
threat was conveniently removed from
the McCloskey campaign.
Businessman Knapp was involved in
the presidential race as Reagan finance
chairman in California. It is unclear
whether he was still entertaining the
notion to contest the 12th district Re
publican nomination a third time.
Whatever the case, before the prim
ary campaign got under way. McClos
key was visited by his good friend from
the House, Ford. A few weeks later,
Ford appointed Knapp assistant sec
retary of the Air Force, removing a key
worker from Ronald Reagan's camp
and removing a major obstacle to the
McCloskev re-election effort. McClos
key consequently rati unopposed in
the |une primary for the first time in
his political career.

According to McCloskey campaign
manager Rusty Van Bronkhorst, the
timing of Knapp's appointment before
the California primary was strictly cir
cumstantial. She maintains that
Knapp was actively seeking a govern
ment job and expressed no inclination
to challenge McCloskey.
Spending no money in the primary
effort, the McCloskey forces bad more
funds to devote to the media cam
paign they ran during the crucial last
month of the race. However. Van
Bronkhorst claims that the McCloskey
staff had trouble raising interest in his
drive for re-election without a primary
opponent and that, at least on that
score, Harris had a headstart.
Maverick image
Harris realized that McCloskey's
strength among Democrats was his
ability to invoke the maverick image
he gained by opposing U.S. involve
ment in Vietnam and running against
Richard Nixon in the 1972 New Hamp
shire primary. But the Democrat also
believed that his opponent had shifted
to the right since that time.
Harris campaign literature claimed
that McCloskey had supported the
Ford Administration on 64 percent of
his House votes, that he had a poor
consumer record and that he was a
proponent of the I'ord military budget
and the oil industry party line.
With a 3-2 victory margin in the
Democratic, primary against Norman
Shaskev. Harris prepared to debunk

the maverick image of Pete McClos
kev. Van Bronkhorst says she feels that
view of him was always an inflated
media creation. Nevertheless, the Har
ris campaign felt it had to combat the
"maverick" in the minds of the voters.
At the same time, McCloskey began
to deploy the tactic Shaskey had un
successfully used in the Democratic
primary of painting I larris as a radical.
The Republican initially called the
former student activist an "SDSer"
(Students for a Democratic Society),
but later retracted the Jtatement. How
ever. the tactic persevered in a mod
ified form throughout the campaign in
statements such as one that termed
Harris' defense position "dangerously
irresponsible."
It became dear as the campaign
progressed that there was an ideologi
cal difference between the two candi
dates. but whether the voters' consid
eration of personality transcended the
issues is difficult to assess. McClos
key's shift into a more conservative
voting pattern in Congress can be
explained by tin; fact that he is a prag
inatif thinker and separated issues
such .is support for the Cambodian re
gime and his previous ant i-war actions
in his own thinking
Because he was the incumbent his
stands were much more mis< eptible to
examination than those of Harris, who
had no voting record in pre\ ions pub
lic office. However, the incumbency
also gave McCloskey what proved to
be insurmountable advantages.

The Republican initially called the
former student activist an "SDSer"
(Students for a Democratic Society),
but later retracted the Jtatement. How

statements such as one that termed
Harris' defense position "dangerously
irresponsible."
It became dear as the campaign
progressed that there was an ideologi

dates. but whether the voters' consid
eration of personality transcended the
issues is difficult to assess. McClos
key's shift into a more conservative
voting pattern in Congress can be
explained by tin; fact that he is a prag
inatif thinker and separated issues
such .is support for the Cambodian re
gime and his previous ant i-war actions
in his own thinking
Because he was the incumbent his
stands were much more mis< eptible to
examination than those of Harris, who
had no voting record in pre\ ions pub
lic office. However, the incumbency
also gave McCloskey what proved to
be insurmountable advantages.
The decisive factor in the 12th dis
trict congressional race proved to he
the electorate's satisfaction with in
cumbent Paul ("Pete") McCloskey Jr.
despite the appeal of challenger David
Harris.
In the campaign between the two ar
ticulate and independent men. four
distinct factors emerged that signific
antly shaped the campaign. To begin
with, the contest could have been radi
cally different had McCloskey faced
businessman Gordor Knapp in the
Republican primary; Knapp had
mounted two strong challenges
against him in the past. Before that
stage of the campaign, however. Knapp
was named to a government post by
President Gerald Ford.
A second integral part of the contest
was the strategy of I larris forces to de
bunk McCloskey's "maverick" image,
which they maintained had faded due
to the representative's close associa
tion with policies of the Ford ad
ministration.
A series of debates helped to confirm
that charge, while revealing the diver
gent styles of the two men. These de
bates played the third major role in the
contest and the opposing camps disag
ree in judging the magnitude of their
impact.
Media blitz
Finally, a media blitz by McCloskey
sewed up his sixth election effort de

spite a growing Harris drive in the last
month of the race.
Because McCloskey won by such a
large margin, gaining f>H percent of the
vote, the possibility that he might not
have made it through the Republican
primary is generally ignored. Mow
ever. had Cordon Knapp decided to
run against the incumbent, the
Harris/McCloskey contest might never
have materialized.
Knapp, a right-wing Reagan Repub
lican, had run a close race against the
more liberal McCloskey in 1972. In
1974 Knapp mounted a stronger chal
lenge and lost by a scant 800 votes,
defeated mainly by a drive by Stanford
Democrats to register Republican.
In this election, however, the Knapp
threat was conveniently removed from
the McCloskey campaign.
Businessman Knapp was involved in
the presidential race as Reagan finance
chairman in California. It is unclear
whether he was still entertaining the
notion to contest the 12th district Re
publican nomination a third time.
Whatever the case, before the prim
ary campaign got under way. McClos
key was visited by his good friend from
the House, Ford. A few weeks later,
Ford appointed Knapp assistant sec
retary of the Air Force, removing a key
worker from Ronald Reagan's camp
and removing a major obstacle to the
McCloskev re-election effort. McClos
key consequently rati unopposed in
the |une primary for the first time in
his political career.

According to McCloskey campaign
manager Rusty Van Bronkhorst, the
timing of Knapp's appointment before
the California primary was strictly cir
cumstantial. She maintains that
Knapp was actively seeking a govern
ment job and expressed no inclination
to challenge McCloskey.
Spending no money in the primary
effort, the McCloskey forces bad more
funds to devote to the media cam
paign they ran during the crucial last
month of the race. However. Van
Bronkhorst claims that the McCloskey
staff had trouble raising interest in his
drive for re-election without a primary
opponent and that, at least on that
score, Harris had a headstart.
Maverick image
Harris realized that McCloskey's
strength among Democrats was his
ability to invoke the maverick image
he gained by opposing U.S. involve
ment in Vietnam and running against
Richard Nixon in the 1972 New Hamp
shire primary. But the Democrat also
believed that his opponent had shifted
to the right since that time.
Harris campaign literature claimed
that McCloskey had supported the
Ford Administration on 64 percent of
his House votes, that he had a poor
consumer record and that he was a
proponent of the I'ord military budget
and the oil industry party line.
With a 3-2 victory margin in the
Democratic, primary against Norman
Shaskev. Harris prepared to debunk

the maverick image of Pete McClos
kev. Van Bronkhorst says she feels that
view of him was always an inflated
media creation. Nevertheless, the Har
ris campaign felt it had to combat the
"maverick" in the minds of the voters.
At the same time, McCloskey began
to deploy the tactic Shaskey had un
successfully used in the Democratic
primary of painting I larris as a radical.
The Republican initially called the
former student activist an "SDSer"
(Students for a Democratic Society),

he gained by opposing U.S. involve
ment in Vietnam and running against
Richard Nixon in the 1972 New Hamp
shire primary. But the Democrat also
believed that his opponent had shifted
to the right since that time.
Harris campaign literature claimed
that McCloskey had supported the
Ford Administration on 64 percent of
his House votes, that he had a poor
consumer record and that he was a
proponent of the I'ord military budget
and the oil industry party line.
With a 3-2 victory margin in the
Democratic, primary against Norman
Shaskev. Harris prepared to debunk

the maverick image of Pete McClos
kev. Van Bronkhorst says she feels that
view of him was always an inflated
media creation. Nevertheless, the Har
ris campaign felt it had to combat the
"maverick" in the minds of the voters.
At the same time, McCloskey began
to deploy the tactic Shaskey had un
successfully used in the Democratic
primary of painting I larris as a radical.
The Republican initially called the
former student activist an "SDSer"
(Students for a Democratic Society),
but later retracted the Jtatement. How
ever. the tactic persevered in a mod
ified form throughout the campaign in
statements such as one that termed
Harris' defense position "dangerously
irresponsible."
It became dear as the campaign
progressed that there was an ideologi
cal difference between the two candi
dates. but whether the voters' consid
eration of personality transcended the
issues is difficult to assess. McClos
key's shift into a more conservative
voting pattern in Congress can be
explained by tin; fact that he is a prag
inatif thinker and separated issues
such .is support for the Cambodian re
gime and his previous ant i-war actions
in his own thinking
Because he was the incumbent his
stands were much more mis< eptible to
examination than those of Harris, who
had no voting record in pre\ ions pub
lic office. However, the incumbency
also gave McCloskey what proved to
be insurmountable advantages.
The decisive factor in the 12th dis
trict congressional race proved to he
the electorate's satisfaction with in
cumbent Paul ("Pete") McCloskey Jr.
despite the appeal of challenger David
Harris.
In the campaign between the two ar
ticulate and independent men. four
distinct factors emerged that signific
antly shaped the campaign. To begin
with, the contest could have been radi
cally different had McCloskey faced
businessman Gordor Knapp in the
Republican primary; Knapp had
mounted two strong challenges
against him in the past. Before that
stage of the campaign, however. Knapp
was named to a government post by
President Gerald Ford.
A second integral part of the contest
was the strategy of I larris forces to de
bunk McCloskey's "maverick" image,
which they maintained had faded due
to the representative's close associa
tion with policies of the Ford ad
ministration.
A series of debates helped to confirm
that charge, while revealing the diver
gent styles of the two men. These de
bates played the third major role in the
contest and the opposing camps disag
ree in judging the magnitude of their
impact.
Media blitz
Finally, a media blitz by McCloskey
sewed up his sixth election effort de

spite a growing Harris drive in the last
month of the race.
Because McCloskey won by such a
large margin, gaining f>H percent of the
vote, the possibility that he might not
have made it through the Republican
primary is generally ignored. Mow
ever. had Cordon Knapp decided to
run against the incumbent, the
Harris/McCloskey contest might never
have materialized.
Knapp, a right-wing Reagan Repub
lican, had run a close race against the
more liberal McCloskey in 1972. In
1974 Knapp mounted a stronger chal
lenge and lost by a scant 800 votes,
defeated mainly by a drive by Stanford
Democrats to register Republican.
In this election, however, the Knapp
threat was conveniently removed from
the McCloskey campaign.
Businessman Knapp was involved in
the presidential race as Reagan finance
chairman in California. It is unclear
whether he was still entertaining the
notion to contest the 12th district Re
publican nomination a third time.
Whatever the case, before the prim
ary campaign got under way. McClos
key was visited by his good friend from
the House, Ford. A few weeks later,
Ford appointed Knapp assistant sec
retary of the Air Force, removing a key
worker from Ronald Reagan's camp
and removing a major obstacle to the
McCloskev re-election effort. McClos
key consequently rati unopposed in
the |une primary for the first time in
his political career.

According to McCloskey campaign
manager Rusty Van Bronkhorst, the
timing of Knapp's appointment before
the California primary was strictly cir
cumstantial. She maintains that
Knapp was actively seeking a govern
ment job and expressed no inclination
to challenge McCloskey.
Spending no money in the primary
effort, the McCloskey forces bad more
funds to devote to the media cam
paign they ran during the crucial last
month of the race. However. Van
Bronkhorst claims that the McCloskey
staff had trouble raising interest in his
drive for re-election without a primary
opponent and that, at least on that
score, Harris had a headstart.
