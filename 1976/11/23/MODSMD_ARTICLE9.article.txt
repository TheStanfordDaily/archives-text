## Palo Alto pinball hokum 
### 
In recent months the citizens of Palo Alto
have witnessed an onslaught of paternalistic
legislation. The City Council in an orgy of
busybodiness has done its best to remodel its
laws on those of Calvin's Geneva or Cotton
Mather's Massachusetts.
In its crusade against the temptations of sin,
the City Council has tried to stamp out massage
parlors, adult bookstores and adult movie
houses. The latest target is pinball arcades.
We have two complaints about Palo Alto's
ban on pinball arcades. The first concerns the
constitutionality of the ban; the second is more
fundamentally directed at the punishment of
victimless crimes.
In June 1974, the California Supreme Court
overturned as unconstitutional a Los Angeles
municipal ordinance that among other things
prohibited pinball machines as gambling de
vices. The court held that the field of regulation
of gambling had been preempted by the state. It
was an area for state, not city, laws. In addition,
the court determined that pinball machines
with flippers were games of skill, not chance.
Therefore they could not be regulated by anti
gambling laws.
Finally, and most importantly for Palo Alto,

the court noted that to regulate or prohibit only
certain games of skill was to violate the equal
protection provisions of the 14th Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution and of the California
Constitution.
In other words, if you're going to ban pinball
or subject it to tough regulation, you have to do
the same to archery, bowling, baseball, basket
ball, quoits and darts.
Aside from the unconstitutionality of Palo
Alto's six-month ban on pinball arcades and the
probable unconstitutionality of the ordinance
being prepared to go into effect after six
months, there is the more fundamental ques
tion of enforcing victimless-crime laws.
There is no complainant who is mugged by
pinball machines. Pinball machines do not
murder, rape or steal. Instead the dubious
claim is made that pinball machines somehow
"lead to" loitering, idleness and delinquency.
Somehow the machine is innately evil. Pinball
is the deus ex machina that produces adult
character flaws and stubborn children.
Well, we think this is hokum and we intend
to call the City Council on its recent legislative
endeavors. Let's halt this nonsense before Palo
Alto becomes the laughingstock of America.
