# Research— prime factor for tenure
## 
### Karen Knowles 
Speakers at the forum on tenure and
the quality of Stanford education last
night agreed that research and teach
ing are equally important in theory in
tenure decisions, but research is more
important in reality.
Tenure decisions are made after an
extensive study including departmen
tal, student and outside evaluations of
a candidate's research and teaching.
Each tenured faculty must be one of
the top three in his field when the te
nure decision is made, according to a
1975 report written by Humanities and
Sciences Dean Halsey Royden.
The university grants tenure on the
basis of past performance as an indica
tion of future promise, Asst. Biological
Sciences Prof. Craig Heller said. Te
nure is granted less often now than in
the past because the faculty is no
longer growing in size and there is less
willingness to gamble on promise
without demonstrable achievement,
Royden's report states.
Tenure was established to ensure
freedom of speech for scholars, not as
job security. It is often abused by ad
ministrators who limit tenure posi
tions to balance the budget, depart
ments that overhire junior faculty
members so that few will be prompted
to tenured status, and by individuals
who relax after tenure by doing only
research, leaving junior faculty mem
bers with the burden of teaching, Hel
ler said.
Research is essential to keep teach
ing and knowledge from stagnating.
Heller remarked. Universities should
train their students to discover new
knowledge not merely to assimilate
the discoveries of others, he said. Most
undergraduate courses are intended to
introduce students to the subject. More
advanced courses are structured to en
courage independent research by the
student. Student evaluations are not
given much weight in tenure deci
sions, because they have a limited
perspective of what constitutes
"good" teaching, Heller said. Many
students assess teachers on their abil
ity to entertain, not on the content of
their course, he said.
Student input of course evaluation
has been limited and purely qualita
tive. There is no standard method to
determine what is good teaching. Stu
dents must answer course evaluations
seriously, providing pertinent infor
mation in order for their evaluations to
be effective, Larry Diamond, former
ASSU vice president, said.
Junior faculty are usually appointed
for three years, and are often granted
another three years after that.
