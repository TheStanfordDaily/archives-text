# 'Rhodesia Henry's got a plan
## 
### 
Toward the end of last September,
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger de
cided to do it again — to help some
more folks in a foreign land solve their
problems. This time, it was the "Kis
singer plan" (really, the James Cal
laghan plan) for settling the "conflict"
in Zimbabwe ("Rhodesia").
Kissinger has been widely
applauded for his efforts — e.g., by
President Gerald Ford and by various
sectors of the press. A headline in the
Oct. 4 edition of Newsweek proclaims:
"Kissinger Does it Again."
Hut not everybody has been so op
timistic about "Kissinger's Plan." The
front page headline of a well-known
British paper, The Guardian (Vol. 115,
No. 14) suggests that: "Kissinger
Promises More Than He Can Deliver."
In addition to the skepticism expres
sed by some journalists, there has been
widespread skepticism expressed
elsewhere: by South African whites:
by progressive blacks living in Zim
babwe; by the presidents of the five
"front-line" African states (Mozam
bique, Zambia, Tanzania, Angola and
Botswana); by spokesmen for libera
tion groups (e.g., Z.A.N.U. and
Z.1.P.A.); and, finally, by the Rhode
sian prime minister himself.
What is the "Kissinger Plan" about?
What are its provisions?
The "Kissinger Plan" contains six
basic proposals agreed on — at least,
more or less — by Smith:
1. Rhodesia would agree to "major
ity rule" (whatever that means) within
two years. The questions here are two:
"Majority rule" by whom, and in
whose interests? Why two years?
2. Britain would organizea constitu
tional convention.
3. An interim government, com
posed of representatives of the Rhode
sian government and of African
nationalist leaders, would be formed.
The U.S. government is attempting to
insure that, when power is conceded
to blacks, a "moderate," pro-Western
leader, like Joshua Nkomo, would take
power.
4. The interim government would
consist of a Council of State. Half of the
council's members would be white
and half would be black — these to be
presided over by a white chairman,
without a special vote.
Smith adds, "The interim govern
ment should also have a Council of
Ministers with a majority of Africans
and an African First Minister." The
Minister of Defense, like the Minister
of Law and Order would be white. De
cisions of the Council of Ministers
would require the votes of two-thirds
of the body.
5. Upon establishment of an interim
government, economic sanctions
against Rhodesia would be lifted, and
all acts of war, included those waged
by liberation fighters, would promptly
cease. Interestingly, Smith has said
that his acceptance of the plan was
contingent on these conditions.
6. A trust fund, said to amount to two
billion dollars, would be created —
first, to protect the interests of the
white minority (especially, the white
rural bourgeoisie, which tradi
tionally dominated Rhodesian life
vis-a-vis "the establishment of a floor
price for the sale of Rhodesian farm
land; financial help and an open door
elsewhere for whites who decide to
emigrate; the maintenance of pension
rights, and guarantees that those who
stay on will later be able to take out at
least part of their assets in hard cur
rency" (TheGuunfinn, Sept. 19.1976).
Further. the fund would "organize
and finance a major international ef
fort to respond to tin; economic oppor
tunities of this country and to affect the
changes t,iking place." and would,

"inter ulia, support the internal and
external economic circumstances of
the country" (The Guardian, Oct. 3).
So this is the plan. The U.S. State
Department, the military, and rep
resentatives of international capital
are interested in this for two reasons
essentially. The first has to do with the
fact that international capital has
shifted its strategy from that of trying
to enforce and reproduce relations of

colonialism to that of the reproduction
of neo-colonial relations.
And we must understand that the
United States has become the world's
principal supporter of neo
colonialism.
Secondly, many of the dominant
forces in this country face a dilemma:
"how to reconcile legitimate black
demands for majority rule with the
West's economic and strategic in
terests in the area" (Newsweek, June
7).
Economic interests lie largely with
the mineral wealth (especially
chromium mining). But strategic in
terests (military and political) are.
probably, even greater stakes here. In
southern Africa, the United States has
few friends among the black govern
ments — and these are dwindling.

Also, Zimbabwe abuts the oil lanes
from the Persian Gulf to the West —
and is, thus, from the strategic angle, a
vital stake for Western capital and for
Western political powers.
With the "Kissinger Plan," powerful
forces within the United States would
further their interests, while this na
tion would, again, fulfill its role as
chief financier of, and international
police for, neo-colonialism. In fulfil
ling this role, it would use traditional
neo-colonial tools — economic, politi
cal, military and ideological.
If accepted, the plan would preserve
the hegemony of capital over labor. It
would nurture pro-Western, that is to
say, pro-capitalist, leadership (hence
the opposition to leaders of the Robert
Mugabe type).
It would essentially reinforce the
country's present class structure — a
class structure based on privilege for
whites and exploitation for blacks.
Some limited growth of the small Afri
can bourgeoisie, especially, of the
urban petite bourgeoisie, would be al
lowed — but such alteration would,
obviously, benefit international capi
tal and neo-colonial powers more than
the masses of African peoples.
It would insure the transition from
colonial "Rhodesia" to neo-colonial
Zimbabwe.
Interestingly enough, the
Callaghan-Kissinger Plan is patterned
on the transfer of political power from
whites to blacks in Kenya. Certainly
the last thing we need in southern Af
rica is another Kenya.

problems. This time, it was the "Kis
singer plan" (really, the James Cal
laghan plan) for settling the "conflict"
in Zimbabwe ("Rhodesia").
Kissinger has been widely
applauded for his efforts — e.g., by
President Gerald Ford and by various
sectors of the press. A headline in the
Oct. 4 edition of Newsweek proclaims:
"Kissinger Does it Again."
Hut not everybody has been so op
timistic about "Kissinger's Plan." The
front page headline of a well-known
British paper, The Guardian (Vol. 115,
No. 14) suggests that: "Kissinger
Promises More Than He Can Deliver."
In addition to the skepticism expres
sed by some journalists, there has been
widespread skepticism expressed
elsewhere: by South African whites:
by progressive blacks living in Zim
babwe; by the presidents of the five
"front-line" African states (Mozam
bique, Zambia, Tanzania, Angola and
Botswana); by spokesmen for libera
tion groups (e.g., Z.A.N.U. and
Z.1.P.A.); and, finally, by the Rhode
sian prime minister himself.
What is the "Kissinger Plan" about?
What are its provisions?
The "Kissinger Plan" contains six
basic proposals agreed on — at least,
more or less — by Smith:
1. Rhodesia would agree to "major
ity rule" (whatever that means) within
two years. The questions here are two:
"Majority rule" by whom, and in
whose interests? Why two years?
2. Britain would organizea constitu
tional convention.
3. An interim government, com
posed of representatives of the Rhode
sian government and of African
nationalist leaders, would be formed.
The U.S. government is attempting to
insure that, when power is conceded
to blacks, a "moderate," pro-Western
leader, like Joshua Nkomo, would take
power.
4. The interim government would
consist of a Council of State. Half of the
council's members would be white
and half would be black — these to be
presided over by a white chairman,
without a special vote.
Smith adds, "The interim govern
ment should also have a Council of
Ministers with a majority of Africans
and an African First Minister." The
Minister of Defense, like the Minister
of Law and Order would be white. De
cisions of the Council of Ministers
would require the votes of two-thirds
of the body.
5. Upon establishment of an interim
government, economic sanctions
against Rhodesia would be lifted, and
all acts of war, included those waged
by liberation fighters, would promptly
cease. Interestingly, Smith has said
that his acceptance of the plan was
contingent on these conditions.
6. A trust fund, said to amount to two
billion dollars, would be created —
first, to protect the interests of the
white minority (especially, the white
rural bourgeoisie, which tradi
tionally dominated Rhodesian life
vis-a-vis "the establishment of a floor
price for the sale of Rhodesian farm
land; financial help and an open door
elsewhere for whites who decide to
emigrate; the maintenance of pension
rights, and guarantees that those who
stay on will later be able to take out at
least part of their assets in hard cur
rency" (TheGuunfinn, Sept. 19.1976).
Further. the fund would "organize
and finance a major international ef
fort to respond to tin; economic oppor
tunities of this country and to affect the
changes t,iking place." and would,

"inter ulia, support the internal and
external economic circumstances of
the country" (The Guardian, Oct. 3).
So this is the plan. The U.S. State
Department, the military, and rep
resentatives of international capital
are interested in this for two reasons
essentially. The first has to do with the
fact that international capital has
shifted its strategy from that of trying
to enforce and reproduce relations of

colonialism to that of the reproduction
of neo-colonial relations.
And we must understand that the
United States has become the world's
principal supporter of neo
colonialism.
Secondly, many of the dominant
forces in this country face a dilemma:
"how to reconcile legitimate black
demands for majority rule with the
West's economic and strategic in
terests in the area" (Newsweek, June
7).
Economic interests lie largely with
the mineral wealth (especially
chromium mining). But strategic in
terests (military and political) are.
probably, even greater stakes here. In
southern Africa, the United States has
few friends among the black govern
ments — and these are dwindling.

Also, Zimbabwe abuts the oil lanes
from the Persian Gulf to the West —
and is, thus, from the strategic angle, a
vital stake for Western capital and for
Western political powers.
With the "Kissinger Plan," powerful
forces within the United States would
further their interests, while this na
tion would, again, fulfill its role as
chief financier of, and international
police for, neo-colonialism. In fulfil
ling this role, it would use traditional
neo-colonial tools — economic, politi
cal, military and ideological.
If accepted, the plan would preserve
the hegemony of capital over labor. It
would nurture pro-Western, that is to
say, pro-capitalist, leadership (hence
the opposition to leaders of the Robert
Mugabe type).
It would essentially reinforce the
country's present class structure — a
class structure based on privilege for
whites and exploitation for blacks.
Some limited growth of the small Afri
can bourgeoisie, especially, of the
urban petite bourgeoisie, would be al
lowed — but such alteration would,
obviously, benefit international capi
tal and neo-colonial powers more than
the masses of African peoples.
It would insure the transition from
colonial "Rhodesia" to neo-colonial
Zimbabwe.
Interestingly enough, the
Callaghan-Kissinger Plan is patterned
on the transfer of political power from
whites to blacks in Kenya. Certainly
the last thing we need in southern Af
rica is another Kenya.

Kissinger has been widely
applauded for his efforts — e.g., by
President Gerald Ford and by various
sectors of the press. A headline in the
Oct. 4 edition of Newsweek proclaims:
"Kissinger Does it Again."
Hut not everybody has been so op
timistic about "Kissinger's Plan." The
front page headline of a well-known
British paper, The Guardian (Vol. 115,
No. 14) suggests that: "Kissinger
Promises More Than He Can Deliver."
In addition to the skepticism expres
sed by some journalists, there has been
widespread skepticism expressed
elsewhere: by South African whites:
by progressive blacks living in Zim
babwe; by the presidents of the five
"front-line" African states (Mozam
bique, Zambia, Tanzania, Angola and
Botswana); by spokesmen for libera
tion groups (e.g., Z.A.N.U. and
Z.1.P.A.); and, finally, by the Rhode
sian prime minister himself.
What is the "Kissinger Plan" about?
What are its provisions?
The "Kissinger Plan" contains six
basic proposals agreed on — at least,
more or less — by Smith:
1. Rhodesia would agree to "major
ity rule" (whatever that means) within
two years. The questions here are two:
"Majority rule" by whom, and in
whose interests? Why two years?
2. Britain would organizea constitu
tional convention.
3. An interim government, com
posed of representatives of the Rhode
sian government and of African
nationalist leaders, would be formed.
The U.S. government is attempting to
insure that, when power is conceded
to blacks, a "moderate," pro-Western
leader, like Joshua Nkomo, would take
power.
4. The interim government would
consist of a Council of State. Half of the
council's members would be white
and half would be black — these to be
presided over by a white chairman,
without a special vote.
Smith adds, "The interim govern
ment should also have a Council of
Ministers with a majority of Africans
and an African First Minister." The
Minister of Defense, like the Minister
of Law and Order would be white. De
cisions of the Council of Ministers
would require the votes of two-thirds
of the body.
5. Upon establishment of an interim
government, economic sanctions
against Rhodesia would be lifted, and
all acts of war, included those waged
by liberation fighters, would promptly
cease. Interestingly, Smith has said
that his acceptance of the plan was
contingent on these conditions.
6. A trust fund, said to amount to two
billion dollars, would be created —
first, to protect the interests of the
white minority (especially, the white
rural bourgeoisie, which tradi
tionally dominated Rhodesian life
vis-a-vis "the establishment of a floor
price for the sale of Rhodesian farm
land; financial help and an open door
elsewhere for whites who decide to
emigrate; the maintenance of pension
rights, and guarantees that those who
stay on will later be able to take out at
least part of their assets in hard cur
rency" (TheGuunfinn, Sept. 19.1976).
Further. the fund would "organize
and finance a major international ef
fort to respond to tin; economic oppor
tunities of this country and to affect the
changes t,iking place." and would,

"inter ulia, support the internal and
external economic circumstances of
the country" (The Guardian, Oct. 3).
So this is the plan. The U.S. State
Department, the military, and rep
resentatives of international capital
are interested in this for two reasons
essentially. The first has to do with the
fact that international capital has
shifted its strategy from that of trying
to enforce and reproduce relations of

colonialism to that of the reproduction
of neo-colonial relations.
And we must understand that the
United States has become the world's
principal supporter of neo
colonialism.
Secondly, many of the dominant
forces in this country face a dilemma:
"how to reconcile legitimate black
demands for majority rule with the
West's economic and strategic in
terests in the area" (Newsweek, June
7).
Economic interests lie largely with
the mineral wealth (especially
chromium mining). But strategic in
terests (military and political) are.
probably, even greater stakes here. In
southern Africa, the United States has
few friends among the black govern
ments — and these are dwindling.

Also, Zimbabwe abuts the oil lanes
from the Persian Gulf to the West —
and is, thus, from the strategic angle, a
vital stake for Western capital and for
Western political powers.
With the "Kissinger Plan," powerful
forces within the United States would
further their interests, while this na
tion would, again, fulfill its role as
chief financier of, and international
police for, neo-colonialism. In fulfil
ling this role, it would use traditional
neo-colonial tools — economic, politi
cal, military and ideological.
If accepted, the plan would preserve
the hegemony of capital over labor. It
would nurture pro-Western, that is to
say, pro-capitalist, leadership (hence
the opposition to leaders of the Robert
Mugabe type).
It would essentially reinforce the
country's present class structure — a
class structure based on privilege for
whites and exploitation for blacks.
Some limited growth of the small Afri
can bourgeoisie, especially, of the
urban petite bourgeoisie, would be al
lowed — but such alteration would,
obviously, benefit international capi
tal and neo-colonial powers more than
the masses of African peoples.
It would insure the transition from
colonial "Rhodesia" to neo-colonial
Zimbabwe.
Interestingly enough, the
Callaghan-Kissinger Plan is patterned
on the transfer of political power from
whites to blacks in Kenya. Certainly
the last thing we need in southern Af
rica is another Kenya.

Toward the end of last September,
