# Counterculture at high point on The Land
## 
### 
By Marc Strassman

The community of individuals
now facing eviction from The
Land constitute one of the
longest-lived, most publicized
and in some ways remarkably
representative examples of the
movement of the late '60s and
early 70s away from the city and
high technology and towards
community, ecology, and self

sufficiency.
It is a prime example of the
pattern and ethic depicted in a
rock tune about a couple who
"blew up their TV, threw away
their papers, moved out to the
country, built them a home, ate a
lot of peaches, tried to find Jesus,
on their own." Although, as it
turned out, not everyone found
Jesus and peaches equally to

their liking.
The land that was to become
The Land had its first associa
tions with alternative culture
themes and people in 1968,
when the Institute for the Study
of Non-violence, a school under
the direction of folksinger Joan
Baez and Ira Sandperl, which
was committed to teaching the
principles of Gandhian Sayag
raha (truth force), established it
self in and around The Long
House on the property, with the
permission of Donald Eldridge,
an Atherton businessman.
Constructive conflicts
From the beginning, conflicts
which characterized the move
ment for social change in general
found specific expression at The
Land. One of the first such de
bates focused on the choice bet
ween involvement in or with
drawal from political activism,
in particular the study and
teaching of non-violent political
activism as opposed to a concern
with immediate and practical
considerations such as building
shelters and planting gardens.
The main point of contention
on The Land in its early days was
between those arguing for more
political involvement in the
non-Land world and those urg
ing more attention to non
political reality.
What we wanted to do," says
Robin Wesley, a long-time Land
resident, "was to take responsi
bility for our own lives."
The conflict between "radi
cals" and "gardeners" was re
solved in favor of the vegetable
tenders.
Responses to reality
The perennial debate about
whether there is such a thing as a
free lunch, or whether being
laid-back is an adequate re
sponse to reality, had to be
worked out in real terms on The
Land, where the inhabitants
found that it wasn't easy to keep
warm and fed in a beautiful but
primitive place.
One bane of countercultural
communities, transients seeking
a ready-made Eden, also
afflicted The Land, but, gener
ally, the rigorous conditions
there and a policy that didn't en
courage freeloaders kept the
population from growing much
beyond fifty.
Another recent conflict within
the alternative culture, that bet
ween "Christians" and "non-
Christians" also manifested itself
at The Land, where it took the

form of disagreement and dis
sention between "Christian"
and "pagan" factions.
A number of Land residents,
including a former "hot spring
freak" had, in the words of the
song previously refered to,
"found Jesus on their own," and
became convinced of the need to
fervently and frequently express
their discovery to others.
The "Christians' " new at
titudes also included an aver
sion to nudity, sometimes prac
tised by community members,
and this also produced a certain
amount of tension and conflict.
Eventually, the "Christians" left
The Land, and are now pursuing
their lifestyles in fully-clothed
surroundings in the flatlands.
It may also be that today's
Land residents in their efforts to
prevent the development of the
property on which they reside
are in the forefront of a newly
emerging movement in the gen
eral culture to establish "herit
age area", protected frorrf the
various depredations of de
velopment, which were discus
sed by Charles McCabe in his
Chronicle column of last Mon
day.

McCabe discusses a point
made by Gunnar Norberg, mayor
of Carmel, that "neither county
nor the usual sort of California
city government has any specific
authority to stop outside de
velopers, halt tract housing or
forbid chain enterprises from
moving in."
The situation and the dilemma
seem to apply as much to the
oakcovered foothills of The Land
as they do to seaside Carmel.
The dominant tendency
throughout the years of alterna
tive culture tencancy on The
Land seems, then, to have been a
desire to live simply, practically,
without interference from the
outside in matters material or
spiritual.
The people living there now
ironically find themselves
forced to engage in the legal and
political activities they had
hoped to leave behind.
The principles of satyagraha
developed by Gandhi in his ef
forts to free colonial India from
British rule, once taught at a
school on The Land, may yet
reappear as the tactics of The
Land residents who are trying to
save their community.

solved in favor of the vegetable
tenders.
Responses to reality
The perennial debate about
whether there is such a thing as a
free lunch, or whether being
laid-back is an adequate re
sponse to reality, had to be
worked out in real terms on The
Land, where the inhabitants
found that it wasn't easy to keep
warm and fed in a beautiful but
primitive place.
One bane of countercultural
communities, transients seeking
a ready-made Eden, also
afflicted The Land, but, gener
ally, the rigorous conditions
there and a policy that didn't en
courage freeloaders kept the
population from growing much
beyond fifty.
Another recent conflict within
the alternative culture, that bet
ween "Christians" and "non-
Christians" also manifested itself
at The Land, where it took the

form of disagreement and dis
sention between "Christian"
and "pagan" factions.
A number of Land residents,
including a former "hot spring
freak" had, in the words of the
song previously refered to,
"found Jesus on their own," and
became convinced of the need to
fervently and frequently express
their discovery to others.
The "Christians' " new at
titudes also included an aver
sion to nudity, sometimes prac
tised by community members,
and this also produced a certain
amount of tension and conflict.
Eventually, the "Christians" left
The Land, and are now pursuing
their lifestyles in fully-clothed
surroundings in the flatlands.
It may also be that today's
Land residents in their efforts to
prevent the development of the
property on which they reside
are in the forefront of a newly
emerging movement in the gen
eral culture to establish "herit
age area", protected frorrf the
various depredations of de
velopment, which were discus
sed by Charles McCabe in his
Chronicle column of last Mon
day.

McCabe discusses a point
made by Gunnar Norberg, mayor
of Carmel, that "neither county
nor the usual sort of California
city government has any specific
authority to stop outside de
velopers, halt tract housing or
forbid chain enterprises from
moving in."
The situation and the dilemma
seem to apply as much to the
oakcovered foothills of The Land

The dominant tendency
throughout the years of alterna

Land seems, then, to have been a
desire to live simply, practically,
without interference from the
outside in matters material or
spiritual.
The people living there now
ironically find themselves
forced to engage in the legal and
political activities they had
hoped to leave behind.
The principles of satyagraha
developed by Gandhi in his ef

The community of individuals
now facing eviction from The
Land constitute one of the
longest-lived, most publicized
and in some ways remarkably
representative examples of the
movement of the late '60s and
early 70s away from the city and
high technology and towards
community, ecology, and self

sufficiency.
It is a prime example of the
pattern and ethic depicted in a
rock tune about a couple who
"blew up their TV, threw away
their papers, moved out to the
country, built them a home, ate a
lot of peaches, tried to find Jesus,
on their own." Although, as it
turned out, not everyone found
Jesus and peaches equally to

their liking.
The land that was to become
The Land had its first associa
tions with alternative culture
themes and people in 1968,
when the Institute for the Study
of Non-violence, a school under
the direction of folksinger Joan
Baez and Ira Sandperl, which
was committed to teaching the
principles of Gandhian Sayag
raha (truth force), established it
self in and around The Long
House on the property, with the
permission of Donald Eldridge,
an Atherton businessman.
Constructive conflicts
From the beginning, conflicts
which characterized the move
ment for social change in general
found specific expression at The
Land. One of the first such de
bates focused on the choice bet
ween involvement in or with
drawal from political activism,
in particular the study and
teaching of non-violent political
activism as opposed to a concern
with immediate and practical
considerations such as building
shelters and planting gardens.
The main point of contention
on The Land in its early days was
between those arguing for more
political involvement in the
non-Land world and those urg
ing more attention to non
political reality.
What we wanted to do," says
Robin Wesley, a long-time Land
resident, "was to take responsi
bility for our own lives."

By Marc Strassman

The community of individuals
now facing eviction from The
Land constitute one of the
longest-lived, most publicized
and in some ways remarkably
representative examples of the
movement of the late '60s and
early 70s away from the city and
high technology and towards
community, ecology, and self

sufficiency.
It is a prime example of the
pattern and ethic depicted in a
rock tune about a couple who
"blew up their TV, threw away
their papers, moved out to the
country, built them a home, ate a
lot of peaches, tried to find Jesus,
on their own." Although, as it
turned out, not everyone found
Jesus and peaches equally to

their liking.
The land that was to become
The Land had its first associa
tions with alternative culture
themes and people in 1968,
when the Institute for the Study
of Non-violence, a school under
the direction of folksinger Joan
Baez and Ira Sandperl, which
was committed to teaching the
principles of Gandhian Sayag
raha (truth force), established it
self in and around The Long
House on the property, with the
permission of Donald Eldridge,
an Atherton businessman.
Constructive conflicts
From the beginning, conflicts
which characterized the move
ment for social change in general
found specific expression at The
Land. One of the first such de
bates focused on the choice bet
ween involvement in or with
drawal from political activism,
in particular the study and
teaching of non-violent political
activism as opposed to a concern
with immediate and practical
considerations such as building
shelters and planting gardens.
The main point of contention
on The Land in its early days was
between those arguing for more
political involvement in the
non-Land world and those urg
ing more attention to non
political reality.
What we wanted to do," says
Robin Wesley, a long-time Land
resident, "was to take responsi
bility for our own lives."
The conflict between "radi
cals" and "gardeners" was re
solved in favor of the vegetable
tenders.
Responses to reality
The perennial debate about
whether there is such a thing as a
free lunch, or whether being
laid-back is an adequate re
sponse to reality, had to be
worked out in real terms on The
Land, where the inhabitants
found that it wasn't easy to keep
warm and fed in a beautiful but
primitive place.
One bane of countercultural
communities, transients seeking
a ready-made Eden, also
afflicted The Land, but, gener
ally, the rigorous conditions
there and a policy that didn't en
courage freeloaders kept the
population from growing much
beyond fifty.
Another recent conflict within
the alternative culture, that bet
ween "Christians" and "non-
Christians" also manifested itself
at The Land, where it took the

form of disagreement and dis
sention between "Christian"
and "pagan" factions.
A number of Land residents,
including a former "hot spring
freak" had, in the words of the
song previously refered to,
"found Jesus on their own," and
became convinced of the need to
fervently and frequently express
their discovery to others.
The "Christians' " new at
titudes also included an aver
sion to nudity, sometimes prac
tised by community members,
and this also produced a certain
amount of tension and conflict.
Eventually, the "Christians" left
The Land, and are now pursuing
their lifestyles in fully-clothed
surroundings in the flatlands.
It may also be that today's
Land residents in their efforts to
prevent the development of the
property on which they reside
are in the forefront of a newly
emerging movement in the gen
eral culture to establish "herit
age area", protected frorrf the
various depredations of de
velopment, which were discus
sed by Charles McCabe in his
Chronicle column of last Mon
day.

McCabe discusses a point
made by Gunnar Norberg, mayor
of Carmel, that "neither county
nor the usual sort of California
city government has any specific
authority to stop outside de
velopers, halt tract housing or
forbid chain enterprises from
moving in."

oakcovered foothills of The Land
as they do to seaside Carmel.
