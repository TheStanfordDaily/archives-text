U'hfjt's this 1 hear about a vasectomy operation for men that can
be turned on and off? Finally, women can he liberated from always
having to be the ones in charge of "preventive medicine!"
Although most vasectomy operations are potentially reversible,
you're probably referring to the still-experimental "spigot" or
"faucet" method made famous in Playboy and Life articles a few
years back.
In this operation, a mechanical device is hooked up to the several
sperm-carrying vas deferens tube which effectively replaces the
now-missing section. This device contains a valve which can be
opened or closed by minor surgery similar to the operation which
originally cut the tube, thus making it an effective birth-control
device.
However, according to Cowell Student Health Center's Dr. John
Dorman, the "spigot" method is only being used on an "experi
mental basis," largely with animals. And, he cautions, though the
normal vasectomy operation has shown a 70 percent reversability
ration, men contemplating vasectomies should consider them
"permanent operations" and not count on being able to father
children again.
As far as liberation is concerned, women (especially unmarried
ones) might temper their excitement about the future for com
pletely reversible vasectomies with the knowledge that, as long as
women are the primary contraceptive users, they are in a position
to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy without depend
ing on their partner.
In an ongoing relationship, this is usually no problem, but when
things are just starting to cook and neither partner kows the other
all that well, it's nice to know that if he makes a mistake, you won't
pay for it.
Is it true that animals masturbate in the wild?
It's tough to say. You see, it's rare that animals outside captivity
cooperate with observers in these matters. Rut once captured,
members of the animal world do engage in a fairly large amount of
"auto-eroticism" (not to be confused with Lincoln-Mercury's "sexy
European.")
katchadorian and Lunde, in Fundamentals of Human Sexuality
list a number of animal masturbation techniques, including male
baboons masturbating on auto windshields, dolphins stimulating
themselves in the jet of motorboat water intakes and porcupines
walking on three legs while holding the fourth paw to their geni
tals.
Masturbation critics and enthusiasts can take comfort in the
observations; the latter will find auto-eroticism "natural" while the
former will call it an aberration occuring only in unnatural captiv
itv.
You'll have to decide for yourself.
"Under covers" is, as they say, under new management. If you
have questions about your sexuality or that of your fellow beings,
drop me a line. Send your inquiries to Under Covers, The Stanford

"auto-eroticism" (not to be confused with Lincoln-Mercury's "sexy
European.")
katchadorian and Lunde, in Fundamentals of Human Sexuality
list a number of animal masturbation techniques, including male
baboons masturbating on auto windshields, dolphins stimulating
themselves in the jet of motorboat water intakes and porcupines
walking on three legs while holding the fourth paw to their geni
tals.
Masturbation critics and enthusiasts can take comfort in the
observations; the latter will find auto-eroticism "natural" while the
former will call it an aberration occuring only in unnatural captiv
itv.
You'll have to decide for yourself.

U'hfjt's this 1 hear about a vasectomy operation for men that can
be turned on and off? Finally, women can he liberated from always
having to be the ones in charge of "preventive medicine!"
Although most vasectomy operations are potentially reversible,
you're probably referring to the still-experimental "spigot" or
"faucet" method made famous in Playboy and Life articles a few
years back.
In this operation, a mechanical device is hooked up to the several
sperm-carrying vas deferens tube which effectively replaces the
now-missing section. This device contains a valve which can be
opened or closed by minor surgery similar to the operation which
originally cut the tube, thus making it an effective birth-control
device.
However, according to Cowell Student Health Center's Dr. John
Dorman, the "spigot" method is only being used on an "experi
mental basis," largely with animals. And, he cautions, though the
normal vasectomy operation has shown a 70 percent reversability
ration, men contemplating vasectomies should consider them
"permanent operations" and not count on being able to father
children again.
As far as liberation is concerned, women (especially unmarried
ones) might temper their excitement about the future for com
pletely reversible vasectomies with the knowledge that, as long as
women are the primary contraceptive users, they are in a position
to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy without depend
ing on their partner.
In an ongoing relationship, this is usually no problem, but when
things are just starting to cook and neither partner kows the other
all that well, it's nice to know that if he makes a mistake, you won't
pay for it.
Is it true that animals masturbate in the wild?
It's tough to say. You see, it's rare that animals outside captivity
cooperate with observers in these matters. Rut once captured,
members of the animal world do engage in a fairly large amount of
"auto-eroticism" (not to be confused with Lincoln-Mercury's "sexy
European.")
