## Stanford top-seeded in tournament Poloists eye NCAA crown 
### Chris Kamel 
It is quite appropriate that the NCAA
water polo championships happen to fall
on Thanksgiving weekend, because
Stanford might indeed have something
to be thankful for.
The Card water polo team might well
bring home a national championship for
the first time in its history.
Stanford is top-seeded in the tourna
ment scheduled for this Saturday and
Sunday at Belmont Plaza Pools in Long
Beach. The Cards are 17-2 for the year
and are trying to keep a 13-game win
streak, which started six weeks ago,
alive. Stanford won the Pacific-8 crown
with a perfect 6-0 mark.
The top-seeded Cardinals will be chal
lenged by UCLA (second-seeded), UC-
Irvine (third-seeded), UC-Santa Barbara
(fourth-seeded), Arizona, Loyola of
Chicago, Pittsburgh and Texas A&M.
New look
But Card coach Art Lambert is quick to
add that this tournament will be different
from before and that "you will not beable
to go on past performances."
Stanford took fourth place last year.
But the Cards lost their last two tourna
ment matches against UC-lrvine and
UCLA by only one point. Stanford
finished sixth in 1974, Lambert's first
year on the Farm.
"It ought to be a completely different
tournament," he said. "A tournament
has a completely different atmosphere
than the regular season's games," said
Lambert. In the tourney a squad must

play twice as many games as it does in
two days of the regular season.
Cal out
One thing that will definitely be diffe
rent this year is that three-time NCAA
champion Cal will not be going for its
fourth straight crown. Cal wasn't
selected by the water polo committee as
an at-large team.
"It will affect the tournament because
Cal has a couple of players that are ex-*
perienced in the NCAA's," said Lambert,
"and they could have changed the course
of the tournament."
Taking Cal's place will be fourth
seeded UC-Santa Barbara, winners of the
Pacific Coast Athletic Association
(PCAA) by defeating a stubborn Long
Beach State team, 5-4, last weekend.
Don't let the letter PCAA fool you,
however. The Cauchos defeated both
Irvine and Cal during the regular season.
Stanford beat UCSB 10-7 and 9-6, but the
Gauchos were ahead at the half in both
games.
First round
In the first round Saturday, Stanford
meets unseeded Arizona at 9 a.m. The
other first-round pairings are UCSB vs.
Loyola at 10:30 a.m., UCLA vs. Texas
A&M at 12 noon and Irvine vs.
Pittsburgh at 1:30 p.m.
The semi-finals will be Saturday even
ing, with the championship match at
7:30 Sunday night. Consolation games
will be played throughout the tourna
ment.
If The Cards get past Arizona, they'll

probably face Santa Barbara at 7:30 that
night.
'Critical match'
"I think our match Saturday night
against UCSB will be our most critical,"
said Lambert. "They are one of the more
physically talented teams on the coast.
They are big, strong, and quick and have
a lot of depth. If they get in synch, they
could explode."
But even if the Cards get past the
Gauchos, their problems will not be sol
ved — not by a longshot.
Stanford will still have to meet the
winner of the UCLA-UCI game, if both
teams make it past their first-round
games. In what Lambert calls a toss-up,
neither UCLA nor UCI will be easier to
play against.
"Each opponent presents a different
problem for us," said Lambert. "UCLA,
UCI and UCSB, however, are all equally
talented with respect to raw size."
According to Lambert,UCl matches up
more equally with the Cards. The An
teaters are a little smaller than the other
teams, but are very quick.
What kind of shape are the Cards in for
this weekend? The question mark is the
leg of goalie Chris Dorst. Dorst, who pul
led a hamstring in practice before the Cal
game, has been resting and although he
will play, it is not known how healthy he
will be.
"Chris has not been in the water this
week," Lambert said. "He'll play this
weekend but I am not sure in what condi
tion his leg will be."
