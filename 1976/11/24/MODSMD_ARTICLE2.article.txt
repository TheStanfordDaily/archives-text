# 'Mechanism of last resort'
## ASSU urges president to revive C-15 
### Kathy Trafton News analysis 
The ASSU Seriate, which is "trying
to change the outlook on the C-15,"
according to ASSU Sen. J.J. Chao.has
approached a reticent President
Richard Lyman urging him to recon
vene the body.
The C-15 is a university-wide judi
cial body which proposes amend
ments to the Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968.
ASSU President Vic Petroff said that
he would be "shocked" if Lyman de
cided to reconvene the C-15. He said
the senate should exercise the option
of passing petitions or call a special
referendum election if it wants to make
recommendations on university judi
cial policies.
Petroff said that the administration
"has heard students bickering about a
lack of student majority (on the Fun
damental Standard division of the
Stanford Judicial Council — SJC) for so
many years that you can't say C-15 to
them without them thinking about the
Fundamental Standard cases issue."
According to Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall, who was chairman of
the C-15 in 1968, "The purpose of the
C-15 when created in the 1960s was to
handle only those issues that could not
be handled by any other mechanism.
The C-15 is a mechanism of last resort
where three constituencies (administ
ration, faculty and student) can come
to deal with each other when there's no

other way" to do so.
Chao told the Daily that the senate
wants to change the focus of the C-15
so that it becomes "one big happy fam
ily. We want to get to the point where
it's (a committee for) cooperation in
stead of competition, a place for a
genuine and sincere exchange" bet
ween the three constituencies.
Seven problems
The ASSU Senate 10 days ago
ratified a list of seven problems they
felt warranted the reconvening of the
C-15. These problems included:
reevaluation of the selection process of
student SJC members, Honor Code vio
lations by professors, student option
on public or private hearings with the
SJC, the selection of the chairman of
the Honor Code violations committee,
the establishment of a formal body to
educate the Stanford community dYi
the Honor Code, automatic yearly
meeting of the C-15, and the option to
plead cases to the dean without admit
ting guilt.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
contended that "some of the issues
raised by the senate are issues that are
not the proper concern of the C-15.
Some are legislative in nature and
could be addressed by the SCLC (Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council)."
Chao admitted that "none of the is
sues per se is crucial, but exchange is
of great benefit. We do feel the topics
we came up with have validity and
should be discussed. Something

doesn't have to come out of it; it
doesn't mean the charter has to be
changed."
Monkeying with charter
Lyons contends that once the C-l 5 is
convened, "there is an assumption
that foretells some changes in the judi
cial system and charter. There is a re
luctance (on the part of the administra
tion) to monkey around with the char
ter unless there is a real reason to do
so."
Marshall said that the C-15 should
be the final resort when other vehicles
for change are exhausted.

Marshall said that the major objec
tions to reconvening the C-15 are the
drain on administrative and faculty
time, and the enormous costs incurred.
"The 1968 C-15 must have cost tens or
hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of faculty time."
ASSU Sen. Rick Hoft said that he felt
the senate's strongest reason for re
convening the C-15 is the "yearly au
tomatic reconvening of the C-15"
proposal. He said that he felt the C-15
is potentially an "important valuable
forum for discussion between all three
bodies."

forum for discussion between all three
bodies."
The ASSU Seriate, which is "trying
to change the outlook on the C-15,"
according to ASSU Sen. J.J. Chao.has
approached a reticent President
Richard Lyman urging him to recon
vene the body.
The C-15 is a university-wide judi
cial body which proposes amend
ments to the Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968.
ASSU President Vic Petroff said that
he would be "shocked" if Lyman de
cided to reconvene the C-15. He said
the senate should exercise the option
of passing petitions or call a special
referendum election if it wants to make
recommendations on university judi
cial policies.
Petroff said that the administration
"has heard students bickering about a
lack of student majority (on the Fun
damental Standard division of the
Stanford Judicial Council — SJC) for so
many years that you can't say C-15 to
them without them thinking about the
Fundamental Standard cases issue."
According to Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall, who was chairman of
the C-15 in 1968, "The purpose of the
C-15 when created in the 1960s was to
handle only those issues that could not
be handled by any other mechanism.
The C-15 is a mechanism of last resort
where three constituencies (administ
ration, faculty and student) can come
to deal with each other when there's no

other way" to do so.
Chao told the Daily that the senate
wants to change the focus of the C-15
so that it becomes "one big happy fam
ily. We want to get to the point where
it's (a committee for) cooperation in
stead of competition, a place for a
genuine and sincere exchange" bet
ween the three constituencies.
Seven problems
The ASSU Senate 10 days ago
ratified a list of seven problems they
felt warranted the reconvening of the
C-15. These problems included:
reevaluation of the selection process of
student SJC members, Honor Code vio
lations by professors, student option
on public or private hearings with the
SJC, the selection of the chairman of
the Honor Code violations committee,
the establishment of a formal body to
educate the Stanford community dYi
the Honor Code, automatic yearly
meeting of the C-15, and the option to
plead cases to the dean without admit
ting guilt.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
contended that "some of the issues
raised by the senate are issues that are
not the proper concern of the C-15.
Some are legislative in nature and
could be addressed by the SCLC (Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council)."
Chao admitted that "none of the is
sues per se is crucial, but exchange is
of great benefit. We do feel the topics
we came up with have validity and
should be discussed. Something

doesn't have to come out of it; it
doesn't mean the charter has to be
changed."
Monkeying with charter
Lyons contends that once the C-l 5 is
convened, "there is an assumption
that foretells some changes in the judi
cial system and charter. There is a re
luctance (on the part of the administra
tion) to monkey around with the char
ter unless there is a real reason to do
so."
Marshall said that the C-15 should
be the final resort when other vehicles
for change are exhausted.

Marshall said that the major objec
tions to reconvening the C-15 are the
drain on administrative and faculty
time, and the enormous costs incurred.
"The 1968 C-15 must have cost tens or
hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of faculty time."
ASSU Sen. Rick Hoft said that he felt
the senate's strongest reason for re
convening the C-15 is the "yearly au
tomatic reconvening of the C-15"
proposal. He said that he felt the C-15
is potentially an "important valuable
forum for discussion between all three
bodies."
