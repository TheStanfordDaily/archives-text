# Scotchers seek AIAW championship
## 
### 
For the second straight year.
Stanford's field hockey team
will represent the West Coast in
the AIAW National Champion
ships which open today at Val
ley Forge Military Academy in
Wayne, Pa.
Coach Shirley Sch oof's
scotchers, who finished regular
season play with a 10-2 mark,
meet fourth-seeded William &
Mary in their first-round match
today. Last year William & Mary
beat the Cards in the opening
round of the tournament.
"We had only one goal last
year," said Schoof, "and that
was to get to the Nationals."
Different approach
"This year we're looking to
play well and hopefully win."

Stanford will be competing in
a field of 16 teams, dominated by
schools from the East Coast. The
tournament's top three seeds are
West Chester (Pa.), Ursinus (Pa.)
and Springfield (Mass.).
Although the Cards will open
against a tough William & Mary
squad today, Schoof is confi
dent.
'Strong team'
"We're a stronger team this
year and we should be better
prepared. Playing in the Nation
als last season provided us with
invaluable experience and
helped prepare us for this year's
tournament."
Stanford must lose no more
than three games to ward off the
threat of elimination in the tour

nament.
Their trip to Pennsylvania is
being financed through a special
Athletic Department budget for
National tournaments.
The scotchers' road to national
prominence has been a long one.
At the start of last year only
friends showed up for their
games but over 500 people
showed up at the end of the sea
son to watch the Cards lose to
San Jose State and end up in a
first-place conference tie with
the Spartans.
Regional crown
But this year Stanford downed
San Jose State 1-0 to win the
Western AIAW regional crown
at Harry Maloney Field Nov. 14.
Senior forward kathy Levin

son, the team captain, scored the
Cards' only goal against the
Spartans.
Other teams involved in the
AIAW tournament are
Brigham Young, Southern Con
neticut, Lockhaven, Central
Missouri, Delaware, Central
Michigan, Virginia, Bemidji,
Ohio State and Oregon.

The 13-member travel squad
includes senior Kathy Levinson;
juniors Martha Anderson, Carol
Ferguson, Sukie Jackson, Onnie
Killifer, Mandy Read and Jane
Soyster; sophomores Buffie
E3erger, Jessie Gerrard, Helen
