to two men who had been involved in a $3000-3500 theft

the Durand Building and quickly called the police. The
men began to run down Santa Teresa Street but were
stopped by Stanford Public Safety officers after they
turned the corner.

who identified themselves as students asked to see some
video-tapes. After being allowed into the room, the pair
allegedly loaded the equipment on a cart and took it down
an elevator to the street below.

flow of activity. Two video-tape recorders and two televi
sion monitors were taken.

manded of anyone asking to use the equipment in the
future.
