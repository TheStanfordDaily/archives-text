Carter aims to reduce unemployment rate
Washington — President-elect Jimmy Carter said yes
terday it is his goal to reduce unemployment by 1.5 per
cent "and perhaps more" in his administration's first year.
He said he also set a goal of boosting the nation's rate of
economic growth to six per cent in the first year of the
Carter administration.
The jobless rate now stands at 7.9 per cent and the
growth rate in the fall quarter was 3.8 per cent just below
the level considered necessary to whittle down un
employment.
Carter also named 133 persons to his Washington transi
tion staff including key campaign aides and young
governmental-affairs specialists.
FEA suggests lifting price controls on gas
Washington — The Federal Energy Administration
proposed yesterday to end gasoline price controls, but
said the move would not cause any over-all increase in
prices at the pump.
But the FEA said the removal of controls could allow
some shifting of prices — unleaded gasoline might in
crease about two cents per gallon, while other grades
might show slight price decreases since they would no
longer have to carry the extra cost of the unleaded grade.
Ray's confession questioned in probe
Washington — The prosecution's failure to obtain a full
confession from James Earl Ray in return for accepting his
guilty plea in the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King was
"most unusual," Richard Sprague, chief counsel ot the
House Committee on Assassinations, said yesterday.
"When arrangements were made for Ray to plead guilty,
the law enforcement agencies never made as part of their
plea bargain that there be a full interrogation or full con
fession by Ray," Sprague said.
Ray admitted killing King on March 19,1969, as part of
a bargain in which prosecutors agreed not to seek the
death penalty if he would plead guilty. He is now serving a
99-year prison term.
First swine flu case may aid program
New York — The head of the swine flu vaccination
program unveiled a nationwide advertising campaign
yesterday and said he hoped news of a Missouri man
getting the flu "will have a positive effect" on the prog
ram.
There were some indications of a renewed interest in
getting the flu shots following the Missouri case, but most
health officials questioned in a nationwide check said it
was too early to tell if the case would have any effect.
The case in Missouri — the first since an outbreak of
swine flu nine months ago at Ft. Dix, N.J. — was confirmed
by health officials on Monday.

Missouri officials said a 32-year-old telephone lineman,
Larry Hardison, had gotten the disease but recovered from
it.
Arab nations dispute hike in oil prices
Kuwait — Ten Arab oil nations began a search yesterday
for a common stance on oil prices, but appeared far apart
on the amount of increase they will seek when the oil
cartel meets next month. Iraq said it insists on 25 per cent,
while some want it held to 10 per cent or less.
Iraqi Oil Minister Tayih Abdul-Karim said increases in
prices of industrial goods imported by Arab nations jus
tifies a big price rise by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
Iraqi Oil Minister Karim told reporters before the meet
ing began: "Oil prices should be adjusted to inflation. The
OPEC must increase oil prices by at least 25 per cent."
Ruling requires warnings for aerosols
Washington — The government yesterday took its sec
ond step within 24 hours to phase out fluorocarbon
aerosols, this time by announcing an interim requirement
that your spray antiperspirant or perfume be labeled as
hazardous to earth.
In what surely ranks as the most unique health warning
ever demanded of consumer products, that can of Right
Cuard — and virtually all other aerosol items in the
cosmetic and personal care market —would have to carry
this legend:
"Warning: Contains a chlorofluorcarbon that may harm
the public health and environment by reducing ozone in
the upper atmosphere."
Fluorocarbons are thought by many scientists to break
down the ozone in the upper atmosphere, a layer that
protects the earth from ultraviolet radiation. Such radia
tion can cause skin cancer, and some suspect it may also
be harmful to the photosynthesis necessary for plant life.
