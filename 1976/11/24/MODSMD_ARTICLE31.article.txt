Telephone operator and union
militant Jane Margolis charged that
Pacific Telephone was conducting
"psychological warfare against (its)
employes" in a recent speech for the
Spartacus Youth League.
Margolis, a member of the Militant
Action Caucus of the Communication
Workers of America (CWA), claimed
Monday that the CWA leadership was
"very, very reactionary."
Labeling the phone company the
largest oppressor of women in the Un
ited States, Margolic claimed that the
company's supervisors spy on
operators.
Pacific Telephone "sees itself as a
direct agent of the status quo,
capitalism" and actively seeks to
eliminate jobs through favorable
utilities regulation and automation,
according to Margolis.
The union "believes in the right of
the company to run its own business,"
favors rate increases and "consciously
pits itself against all militants," said
Margolis.

Margolis was fired from Pacific
Telephone in 1975 through what she
called "a total fraineup" for political
reasons. She pointed out that she had
testified before the Public Utilities
Commission against the phone com
pany before her firing. She was rehi red
14 months later.
Margolis affirmed her radical stance
toward the union leadership and
phone company and called for
nationalization of the company to
gether with the formation of a "work
ers' party."
The CWA must revive the principle
that" 'an injury to one is an injury to
all' and the union has to come to the
defense of workers against firing," she
said.
In addition to demanding "bread
and butter" concessions such as a
shorter work week with no loss in pay
and a union hiring hall. Margolis set
forth the crucial task as building "class
solidarity."
Her speech was co-sponsored by the
Speakers Bureau, SWOPSI, and the Of
fice for Student Activities.
