Honor Code talks
Lack of both student and faculty
awareness, indifference on the part of
students and unhappiness with the
clause which requires students to turn
in violators were listed as main con
cerns of the Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council (SCLC) during two recent
open meetings on the Honor Code.
At last night's meeting in Tresidder,
Council chairman Philip Rhinelander
reiterated his statement made on Cam
pus Conference earlier last night that
the desire of the SCLC is to "see the
Honor Code kept in such form that it is
effective."
He said that the committee will con
tinue to investigate possible methods
of altering the code to help ensure its
effectiveness. According to the chair
man, the purpose of the open meetings
was to get community input concern
ing available alternatives.
Testimony will be reviewed by the
SCLC and discussion will occur Fri

day, Dec. 3, when the council is tenta
tively scheduled to meet again.
