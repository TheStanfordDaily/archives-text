# Mexicans strike against leader

### 
Mexico City (AP) â€”About 28,000
landowners began a strike yesterday
against President Luis Echeverria'sac
tion in turning over thousands of acres
of land to poor farmers, and many
businessmen said they would join it.
Strike organizers said merchants
and industrialists in at least 35 cities
would join the protest today.
In another development in Mexico's
economic crisis, Mexico's central bank
partially lifted a 24-hour suspensionof
trading in foreign currencies intended
to protect foreign reserves.
Echeverria said the
rumors of a coup and further devalua
tions of the peso must stop "for the
good of Mexico," adding that they are
undermining the country's moral and
political structure.
President-elect Jose Lopez Portillo,
who is scheduled to succeed Echever
ria on Dec. 1, issued a statement cal
ling for "calm and tranquility."
Landowners in Sinaloa state said
they called their strike for fear that

Echeverria might expropriate their
farms and ranches as occurred Friday
in the neighboring state of Sonora.
The government took over 243,100
acres of land in Sonora and gave it to
more than 8000 poor families.
"We strike because the authorities
have closed to us the pathways of law
and justice," said an advertisement
published in Mexico City newspapers
by the Sinaloa farmers.
The strike was considered largely
symbolic since crops are already in for
this season and planting has not begun
for next season. But the farmers said
they would not movea single tractor or
make any of the usual preparations for
winter planting, such as irrigating.
Busi ness groups from 24 of Mexico's
31 states published another adver
tisement protesting the expropriations
in Sonora.
"Suddenly the national breadbas
ket, which produces grain and foreign
exchange, is put in the hands of the
inept and irresponsible," the adver
tisement said.
The economic crisis has been build
ing since Sept. 1 when the Mexican
peso was set free to float to its own
level on international currency mar
kets. After being pegged at 12.50 to a
dollar for 22 years, it fell within a mat
ter of weeks to 24 to the dollar. Mexi
cans, worried about further devalua
tions, possible nationalization of pri
vate banks and the fast-moving coup
rumors, began a run on dollars.
On Monday, the central bank sus
pended trading in foreign currency to
protect foreign reserves. However,
tourists entering Mexico were able to
exchange dollars at the airport yester
day and at some private exchanges,
getting about 25.50 to the dollar.
Bankers estimate that at least $150
million has left Mexico in the past 15
days and several hundred million
more since Sept. 1.
