# Publicity swung House election

### Alex Alben News Analysis Second of two parts 
The stylistic and ideologial differ
ences between congressional candi
dates I'aul McCloskey Jr. and David
Harris were forcefully illustrated in
the two forums they used to outline
their platforms: television and public
debates.
According to kit Bricca, chairman of
the Harris campaign, the former ASSU
president had been gaining on the
five-term representative until the last
few weeks of the race. Then a barrage
of commercials and full page adver
tisements swung the undecided vote
(30 per cent of the electorate at that
point) to McCloskey.
There is some question as to the ac
tual number of undecided voters re
maining in the 12th district by the last
few weeks of the campaign. McClos
key campaign manager Rusty Van
Bronkhorst insists that support for the
incumbent never fell below 60 percent
of the electorate.
In contrast, Bricca maintains that
polls by Harris workers showed their
Republican opponent with only 40 per
cent of the vote, tallying the remaining
20 per cent tinder dispute in the unde
cided column. It had taken months for
the grassroots Harris campaign to dent
McCloskey support. Bricca attributes
the shift in voter sentiment to the Har
ris side to the defection of "soft"
Democrats, who had voted for
McCloskey in the past.
But in the final weeks the advan
tages of the incumbency were made

manifest.
Because McCloskey had started wi th
good name recognition resulting from
his nine years in Congress, he had been
able to devote $35,000 to television
advertising. During what Bricca called
a "media blitz" in the campaign's final
days, he estimates that the average re
sident of the 12th district saw five
McCloskey commercials.
These spots showed the handsome
Republican responding to off-camera
questions on national defense, his de
cision to run for another term and his
stance on consumer affairs. Asked
about relations with the Soviet Union
he would coolly reply, "We've got to
watch them like hawks." But he would
follow that line by stating his opposi
tion to the B-l bomber.
Bricca feels that the success of these
commercials lies in their ability to be
read two ways. Conservatives would
pick up on the appealing hard-line
style, while the Democratic cross
overs McCloskey depends on concen
trated on the more moderate substance
of his remarks.
Ford's letter
Aside from the television effort, a
letter from President Gerald Ford was
sent to every Republican in the district
on behalf of his friend from the House
of Representatives. To reach Democra
tic voters. McCloskey forces mailed
out a postcard without any party iden
tification to the important Sunnyvale
and Santa Clara areas.
Unlike most incumbents, McClos
key chose to debate hks challenger. The
debate reoresented a risk for McClos

key because it drew attention to Harris,
giving Harris a chance to refute his
activist past and establishing him as a
serious candidate in the minds of the
conservatives.
The debate on The Nuclear Assur
ance Act is of particular interest. This
legislation, supported by McCloskey,
instructed the federal government to
provide nuclear fuel for the nation's
privately owned power plants. Harris
used his time to expound on his anti
nuclear power stand, while McClos
key defended partial government sub
sidies of the industry as an alternative
to total government control.
Towards the end of the debate,
McCloskey stated that Harris had lied
when he claimed that the bill guaran
teed a 15 per cent profit for nuclear
concerns, saying that the clause had
been amended out of the legislation.
Awkward position
Harris maintained that the profit
guarantee was part of the bill. How
ever, McCloskey's claim, due to his re
spected standing in the community,
put Harris in an awkward position.
The next day. Harris research
people discovered the 15 per cent
clause had been amended out of the
bill while it was on the House floor, but
it had been reintroduced and included
in the final version.
The exchange reveals two trends in
adversary relationship between Harris
and McCloskey. Harris could never
win over support from his opponent's
camp on matters of credibility alone
. . . his audiences had elected the Ke-
