The Nov. 18 Daily published as an adver
tisement a position paper entitled "To
Strengthen Undergraduate Education." The
paper was signed by 12 professors in
humanities disciplines who called themselves
the Humanities Circle. The paper called for a
reorganization of undergraduate education at
Stanford. The central feature of this reformed
system would be mandatory "general educa
tion" courses on Western civilization, on mod
ern society and on some alien culture.
We strongly dissent from the suggestion of
these professors. The program they propose
would inevitably be rigid and selt-defeating.
The metaphors that the members of the
Humanities Circle use for the educational ex
perience are burning oneself on a hot stove and
being in an auto accident. We think these im
ages of wreckage and destruction unintention
ally prefigure the consequences of adopting the
Humanities Circle's proposal.
The members of the Humanities Circle main
tain that many generations of Stanford
graduates will say they profited from the old
required Western Civilization course. Well,
many generations of Stanford graduates would
probably claim, if asked, that they profited from
fraternity paddlings and that Marine Corps boot
camp "builds men."
The real question is whether courses on cul
tural or intellectual history benefit from having
captive audiences, mass-production condi
tions and young, inexperienced instructors.
This is what the old Western Civilization
course was like. This is what brought to that
course the lowest common denominator of
teaching and classroom discussion in the Uni
versity.
Hand-in-hand with the modern university
devoted to scholarly research comes division
into disciplinary fields, specialization of re
search interests and teaching that stresses cur
rent research. The predominantly elective sys
tem in which students choose most of their
courses from faculty offerings works best in a
modern university.
t The 1968 Study of Education at Stanford re
"port on undergraduate education made this
point well: "The reason (that general education
programs do not flourish) is not so much con
ceptual deficiency as institutional unreality.
The faculty of today's university, for better or
worse, consists of a collection of discipline
oriented specialists. The faculty member whom
the university seeks to attract is an indi
vidualist who, while accepting the collegial re
sponsibility of shared tasks within his discip
line, nonetheless prefers to teach and learn
what he wants to teach and learn, not what is
prescribed by a committee. This preference is
fatal to the ideal of a prescribed curriculum."
Apart from the problem of demoralized cap
tive audiences, a transformation of Stanford
into St. John's College would be required to
institute the Humanities Circle's program on an
intellectually rigorous level. Short of that, the
relevant question is whether Stanford offers
courses and programs that cut across discip
lines when it is reasonable to do so and that
allow unification of knowledge in different
fields. We think that the immensely popular
Modern Europe series, current limited distribu
tion requirements and the option of Structured
Liberal Education and other interdisciplinary
programs do the job satisfactorily. If such prog
rams are maintained at a high level, they can, by
their influence, draw the University together as
a community of scholars.
Some further comments are in order on some

problems discussed and neglected by the
members of the Humanities Circle, on the lan
guage they use in discussing educational prob
lems and on the special interests of the authors
of the position paper.
The paper discusses the problem of grade
inflation. But the authors neglect all alternative
modes of reversing this phenomenon except for
their pet project of required general education
courses.
The paper also mentions the weakness of the
academic advising available to under
graduates. The ideal which the Humanities
Circle says ought to be strived for is "surveil
lance." We disagree. Probably more thought
ought to go into devising a better under
graduate advising system and probably more
resources ought to be devoted to it. But let's
keep it a program of guidance and counseling,
not one of surveillance.
The language of the position paper is not
only pompous and opaque, but it appears to be
the diatribe of disgruntled fuddy-duddies
against the complexities and rivalries of mod
ern commercial life. Much time is spent attack
ing classical liberalism and Jaissez/aire, which
in fact are political doctrines not educational
policies. Much effort is expended denouncing
the reality that persons end up competing for
job opportunities. Hence the position paper is
so antagonistic to the development of marketa
ble skills in school that the authors' logic would
undoubtedly lead them to close down Stan
ford's business, law and medical schools. Yet
such schools and other parts of the university
do combine vocational training with genuine
scholarship.
The humanities professors show a discon
certing lack of respect for their students by
equating the absence of rigid academic re
quirements with the situation of "existential
despair." By the time they arrive at Stanford,
students are not exactly novices. They have
made important decisions about their own
lives. They chose to go to college; they chose
Stanford. In America, 18-year-olds are no
longer minors. They are full citizens and voters.
Persons who have spent most of their lives as
students make a substantial sacrifice of time
and money. Because of their commitment, they
deserve a considerable range of choice. To link
the desire for such choice with "existential de
spair" and "narcissism" is absurd — although
it goes well with the professors' infatuation with
rules and regulations, a preoccupation more
appropriate to the Prussian military than to a
university.
Students are adults who should at least be
spared condescending attitudes that stereotype
them as wanderers hopelessly lost in the jungle
without road maps.
A final point is the petty self-interest of some
of the authors. For example, declining enroll
ments in language classes have accompanied
the elimination of general studies require
ments. As a result, less money from general
university funds is available to attract graduate
students to those departments.
It may not be an accident that humanities
professors are demanding that everybody take
humanities courses in a time of budget cut
backs. The Humanities Circle, needless to say,
includes no engineering, mathematics, sci
ence, law, business or medical school profes
sors.
Our disagreement with the members of the
Humanities Circle is quite thorough, and we
hope they meet with no success in their effort to
reinstitute a mandatory general studies prog
ram.

Hand-in-hand with the modern university
devoted to scholarly research comes division
into disciplinary fields, specialization of re

modern university.
t The 1968 Study of Education at Stanford re
"port on undergraduate education made this
point well: "The reason (that general education
programs do not flourish) is not so much con
ceptual deficiency as institutional unreality.
The faculty of today's university, for better or
worse, consists of a collection of discipline
oriented specialists. The faculty member whom
the university seeks to attract is an indi
vidualist who, while accepting the collegial re
sponsibility of shared tasks within his discip
line, nonetheless prefers to teach and learn
what he wants to teach and learn, not what is
prescribed by a committee. This preference is
fatal to the ideal of a prescribed curriculum."
Apart from the problem of demoralized cap
tive audiences, a transformation of Stanford
into St. John's College would be required to
institute the Humanities Circle's program on an
intellectually rigorous level. Short of that, the
relevant question is whether Stanford offers
courses and programs that cut across discip
lines when it is reasonable to do so and that
allow unification of knowledge in different
fields. We think that the immensely popular
Modern Europe series, current limited distribu
tion requirements and the option of Structured
Liberal Education and other interdisciplinary
programs do the job satisfactorily. If such prog
rams are maintained at a high level, they can, by
their influence, draw the University together as
a community of scholars.
Some further comments are in order on some

problems discussed and neglected by the
members of the Humanities Circle, on the lan
guage they use in discussing educational prob
lems and on the special interests of the authors
of the position paper.
The paper discusses the problem of grade
inflation. But the authors neglect all alternative
modes of reversing this phenomenon except for
their pet project of required general education
courses.
The paper also mentions the weakness of the
academic advising available to under
graduates. The ideal which the Humanities
Circle says ought to be strived for is "surveil
lance." We disagree. Probably more thought
ought to go into devising a better under
graduate advising system and probably more
resources ought to be devoted to it. But let's
keep it a program of guidance and counseling,
not one of surveillance.
The language of the position paper is not
only pompous and opaque, but it appears to be
the diatribe of disgruntled fuddy-duddies
against the complexities and rivalries of mod
ern commercial life. Much time is spent attack
ing classical liberalism and Jaissez/aire, which
in fact are political doctrines not educational
policies. Much effort is expended denouncing
the reality that persons end up competing for
job opportunities. Hence the position paper is
so antagonistic to the development of marketa
ble skills in school that the authors' logic would
undoubtedly lead them to close down Stan
ford's business, law and medical schools. Yet
such schools and other parts of the university
do combine vocational training with genuine
scholarship.
The humanities professors show a discon
certing lack of respect for their students by
equating the absence of rigid academic re
quirements with the situation of "existential
despair." By the time they arrive at Stanford,
students are not exactly novices. They have
made important decisions about their own
lives. They chose to go to college; they chose
Stanford. In America, 18-year-olds are no
longer minors. They are full citizens and voters.
Persons who have spent most of their lives as
students make a substantial sacrifice of time
and money. Because of their commitment, they
deserve a considerable range of choice. To link
the desire for such choice with "existential de
spair" and "narcissism" is absurd — although
it goes well with the professors' infatuation with
rules and regulations, a preoccupation more
appropriate to the Prussian military than to a
university.
Students are adults who should at least be
spared condescending attitudes that stereotype
them as wanderers hopelessly lost in the jungle
without road maps.
A final point is the petty self-interest of some
of the authors. For example, declining enroll
ments in language classes have accompanied
the elimination of general studies require
ments. As a result, less money from general
university funds is available to attract graduate
students to those departments.
It may not be an accident that humanities
professors are demanding that everybody take
humanities courses in a time of budget cut
backs. The Humanities Circle, needless to say,
includes no engineering, mathematics, sci
ence, law, business or medical school profes
sors.

Humanities Circle is quite thorough, and we
hope they meet with no success in their effort to

ram.
The Nov. 18 Daily published as an adver

humanities disciplines who called themselves

reorganization of undergraduate education at
Stanford. The central feature of this reformed
system would be mandatory "general educa
tion" courses on Western civilization, on mod
ern society and on some alien culture.
We strongly dissent from the suggestion of
these professors. The program they propose
would inevitably be rigid and selt-defeating.
The metaphors that the members of the

relevant question is whether Stanford offers
courses and programs that cut across discip
lines when it is reasonable to do so and that
allow unification of knowledge in different
fields. We think that the immensely popular
Modern Europe series, current limited distribu
tion requirements and the option of Structured
Liberal Education and other interdisciplinary
programs do the job satisfactorily. If such prog
rams are maintained at a high level, they can, by
their influence, draw the University together as
a community of scholars.
Some further comments are in order on some

problems discussed and neglected by the
members of the Humanities Circle, on the lan
guage they use in discussing educational prob
lems and on the special interests of the authors
of the position paper.
The paper discusses the problem of grade
inflation. But the authors neglect all alternative
modes of reversing this phenomenon except for
their pet project of required general education
courses.
The paper also mentions the weakness of the
academic advising available to under
graduates. The ideal which the Humanities
Circle says ought to be strived for is "surveil
lance." We disagree. Probably more thought
ought to go into devising a better under
graduate advising system and probably more
resources ought to be devoted to it. But let's
keep it a program of guidance and counseling,
not one of surveillance.
The language of the position paper is not
only pompous and opaque, but it appears to be
the diatribe of disgruntled fuddy-duddies
against the complexities and rivalries of mod
ern commercial life. Much time is spent attack
ing classical liberalism and Jaissez/aire, which
in fact are political doctrines not educational
policies. Much effort is expended denouncing
the reality that persons end up competing for
job opportunities. Hence the position paper is
so antagonistic to the development of marketa
ble skills in school that the authors' logic would
undoubtedly lead them to close down Stan
ford's business, law and medical schools. Yet
such schools and other parts of the university
do combine vocational training with genuine
scholarship.
The humanities professors show a discon
certing lack of respect for their students by
equating the absence of rigid academic re
quirements with the situation of "existential
despair." By the time they arrive at Stanford,
students are not exactly novices. They have
made important decisions about their own
lives. They chose to go to college; they chose
Stanford. In America, 18-year-olds are no
longer minors. They are full citizens and voters.
Persons who have spent most of their lives as
students make a substantial sacrifice of time
and money. Because of their commitment, they
deserve a considerable range of choice. To link
the desire for such choice with "existential de
spair" and "narcissism" is absurd — although
it goes well with the professors' infatuation with
rules and regulations, a preoccupation more
appropriate to the Prussian military than to a
university.
Students are adults who should at least be
spared condescending attitudes that stereotype
them as wanderers hopelessly lost in the jungle
without road maps.
A final point is the petty self-interest of some
of the authors. For example, declining enroll
ments in language classes have accompanied
the elimination of general studies require
ments. As a result, less money from general
university funds is available to attract graduate
students to those departments.
It may not be an accident that humanities
professors are demanding that everybody take
humanities courses in a time of budget cut
backs. The Humanities Circle, needless to say,
includes no engineering, mathematics, sci
ence, law, business or medical school profes
sors.
Our disagreement with the members of the
Humanities Circle is quite thorough, and we
hope they meet with no success in their effort to
reinstitute a mandatory general studies prog
ram.
The Nov. 18 Daily published as an adver
tisement a position paper entitled "To
Strengthen Undergraduate Education." The
paper was signed by 12 professors in
humanities disciplines who called themselves
the Humanities Circle. The paper called for a
reorganization of undergraduate education at
Stanford. The central feature of this reformed
system would be mandatory "general educa
tion" courses on Western civilization, on mod
ern society and on some alien culture.
We strongly dissent from the suggestion of
these professors. The program they propose
would inevitably be rigid and selt-defeating.
The metaphors that the members of the
Humanities Circle use for the educational ex
perience are burning oneself on a hot stove and
being in an auto accident. We think these im
ages of wreckage and destruction unintention
ally prefigure the consequences of adopting the
Humanities Circle's proposal.
The members of the Humanities Circle main
tain that many generations of Stanford
graduates will say they profited from the old
required Western Civilization course. Well,
many generations of Stanford graduates would
probably claim, if asked, that they profited from
fraternity paddlings and that Marine Corps boot
camp "builds men."
The real question is whether courses on cul
tural or intellectual history benefit from having
captive audiences, mass-production condi
tions and young, inexperienced instructors.
This is what the old Western Civilization
course was like. This is what brought to that
course the lowest common denominator of
teaching and classroom discussion in the Uni
versity.
Hand-in-hand with the modern university
devoted to scholarly research comes division
into disciplinary fields, specialization of re
search interests and teaching that stresses cur
rent research. The predominantly elective sys
tem in which students choose most of their
courses from faculty offerings works best in a
modern university.
t The 1968 Study of Education at Stanford re
"port on undergraduate education made this
point well: "The reason (that general education
programs do not flourish) is not so much con
ceptual deficiency as institutional unreality.
The faculty of today's university, for better or
worse, consists of a collection of discipline
oriented specialists. The faculty member whom
the university seeks to attract is an indi
vidualist who, while accepting the collegial re
sponsibility of shared tasks within his discip
line, nonetheless prefers to teach and learn
what he wants to teach and learn, not what is
prescribed by a committee. This preference is
fatal to the ideal of a prescribed curriculum."
Apart from the problem of demoralized cap
tive audiences, a transformation of Stanford
into St. John's College would be required to
institute the Humanities Circle's program on an
intellectually rigorous level. Short of that, the
relevant question is whether Stanford offers
courses and programs that cut across discip
lines when it is reasonable to do so and that
