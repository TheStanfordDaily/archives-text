# Chris' dismissal disgraceful

Stanford prides itself on being rela
tively unique among universities with
large athletic programs, in that it re
quires its athletes to be true students as
well. The Athletic Department makes
no exceptions in terms of entrance
qualifications, and there are no easy
class schedules designed for the
athlete.
Recently, Stanford has made news
by being the leader in a move to base
financial aid for athletes on need, as it
is for anv other "normal" student. The
professed philosophy has been that
athletic talent is of secondary impor
tance, or at most, valued on a par with
academic abilitv.
We have claimed to value the pro
cess of athletics, the comraderie, the
discipline, and the development of
one's unique talents and potentials.
Our ideals have been high and we have
derived great pleasure from feeling
superior to schools of "supposed les
ser" ideals and beating them at their
own game, i.e. USC, Michigan and
Ohio State.
The recent dismissal of head foot
ball coach lack Christiansen is in di
rect contradiction and represents a

disgrace to our professed high-minded
ideals. It shows that in practice: 1) the
won-loss record rather than the ex
perience afforded the athletes, is our
only goal; 2) we must win regardless of
the cost to our ideals, in order to keep
the "almighty buck" coming in; and 3)
the alumni control the athletic de
partment.
It is the last point that is most un
settling. It is disheartening to realize a
few wealthy almuni who gain vicari
ous thrills by watching their alma
mater rise to glorious victory six to 10
times a year have more to say about
what happens at the Athletic Depart
ment than the people who are truly
affected.
Christiansen was never consulted or
informed directly by Athletic Director
Joe Ruetz of his status. It was pres
sure from a few narrow alumni con
cerned that their personal egos and
reputations could not stand any more
defeats as a result of Stanford losses.
To deny that it was the won-loss re
cord, or alumni pressure, is ludicrous,
considering that no reason was given
for Christiansen's dismissal. For Ruetz
it was simolv an act of self-

preservation without commitment to,
ideals.
If Christiansen has a fault, it is his
sensitivity, loyalty and humanness.
When his dismissal was announced at
Friday's practice, many players wept
without shame, an expression of deep
respect for their coach.
Sure, Christiansen has his weaknes
ses. Regardless, he is a man of great
integrity who treats his players with
respect, giving them the same respon
sibility he would give one of his peers.
I value these qualities far beyond the
ability to produce dynasties.
Now is the time for the Athletic De
partment to stop pretending to sub
scribe to idealistic goals, to be in
terested in athletes and their experi
ence. and to admit that they are in bus
iness to win. to make money and keep
the alumni happy. It seems that they
are. in fact, "one of those football fac
tories" that they so hypocritically
criticize.
My respect and affection grf to Jack
Christiansen, first a man. and then a
coach of highest ability and character.
