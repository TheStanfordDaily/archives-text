There's a new
Shopping Center
in town.
#
After months of construction, we've created
a new shopping environment. We have new
stores, fountains, plexiglass canopies,
arches, tile walkways, ta«es, and flowers.
We have a whole new look symbolized
by our new logo.
We're ready to show off a little.
Come and take a look.
I . STANFORD SHOPPING CENTER
(It's right where the old one was.)
