# Why we didn't have a bonfire

Thanks to the Stanford Band, the
pre-game activities leading up to the
Big Came were not a total failure. But it
wasn't the same without a bonfire.
And so for the first time in many de
cades, the bonfire was not lit for
reasons other than rain. That's a
shame. Stanford doesn't have many
traditions, and I think that's good; it
allows Stanford to avoid gaining a
snobbish reputation like Harvard, Yale
or Princeton.
But the traditions we have I think we
should hold onto. For if Stanford be
gins to lose her tradition, she will be
losing a large measure of her historical
personality. The Stanford Indian is
one tradition which has fallen by the
wayside; I sincerely hope the Big
Game bonfire is not another.
There were a number of factors
which led to the demise of the 1976
bonfire. As one of the fraternity mem
bers involved in the salvage attempt, I
would like to try to set the record
straight. Four weeks ago, the Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC) voted to have
a bonfire; the vote was not unanimous.
Theta Xi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
(SAE) rejected the bonfire's construc
tion. At least two other fraternities
were badly split on the issue but even
tually voted in favor of the bonfire. The
first problem rose up, then, at the bon
fire's inception — there was a lack of
unity and team effort among the
fraternities.
Bad breaks
There were a series of bad breaks
surrounding the organization and
planning of the bonfire. Pacific Tele
phone, which in past years has do
nated telephone poles and helped to
raise them into place, had agreed to
provide the IFC with similar services
again this year. But three days before
the bonfire was to be lit, Pacific Tel
phone contacted IFC President Jordan
Schwartz to inform him that it was
backing out. The reason was that a stu
dent named John Rubin had convinced
them that such services as they had

previously promised the IFC would
give Pacific Telephone bad publicity.
The fraternity members had a
choice: they could either pay an extra
$300 for a crane company's services or
they could raise the poles themselves.
They chose the latter, and it was the
wrong choice, for two men were seri
ously hurt.
The administration was a problem.
It was clear from the start that the uni
versity never wanted the bonfire any
way, and university officials were vis
ibly relieved when it was called off.
Norm Robinson and Dan Williams, as
sociate deans of student affairs, were of
little help to the builders.
In order for the bonfire to be lit, the
IFC needs a burning permit; in order to
get a burning permit, the IFC needs
university approval. Robinson and
Williams showed up at the construc
tion site only once — and that was after
the two fraternity members had been
hurt. They not only refused university
approval, but they persuaded
Schwartz to call the bonfire off.
Fraternity project
The fraternity members as a whole
presented a problem. The bonfire was
the project of the 13 fraternities on
campus. Less than half that number
were represented during the actual
construction. Each fraternity was as
signed a shift of four hours sometime
during the week to build the bonfire,
but many ignored the IFC's request for
manpower. Even after Schwartz had
made urgent appeals to each fraternity
for help at mid-week, he still found
only a handful of men working in the
lakebed on Thursday morning.
There was a lack of conviction in the
dorms, where cooperation has been
good in past years. During the dinner
hour on Wednesday evening, a
member of Kappa Alpha made an an
nouncement in the Stern Hall dining
room, requesting help from males who
could spare some time. He was greeted
by a barrage of rolls and lettuce.
On the whole, Schwartz came up
against a series of tough breaks. Things
did not fall into place. There were
many unanticipated problems.
On Thursday afternoon, the IFC offi
cially canceled the bonfire. But that
night, members of Sigma Chi, Phi

Delta Theta, and Delta Tau Delta
fraternities made an effort to pull it off.
Two truckloads of clean-burning
wood were stacked up in the space of
about three hours. Ten more could
have been brought in the next day. But
around 3:30 a.m., some Cal students
torched the materials,and the salvage
attempt was destroyed.
Whose fault?
Whose fault was it that the bonfire
didn't happen? Most people will
blame Schwartz, because of bad or
ganization. 1 don't know if that's fair.
Maybe there were some other things he
could have done to get the bonfire lit,
but I doubt it.
Other people will blame the ad
ministration. It is only partially at
fault. Without approval, there can be
no bonfire, and the university got in
terested in the project only after the
accident on Thursday afternoon.
The bulk of the blame rests on the
fraternities — all of them. If the frater
nities voted for a bonfire in October,
they should have worked on it in
November. As I mentioned earlier,
only half of the fraternities were rep
resented by men who actually worked
on the construction.
As for the two fraternities which re
jected the bonfire, they also should
have helped out. The fraternity system
at Stanford is not a healthy one, and
the three-year expulsion of the Delts
last spring was a disaster. If fraternities
are to survive, the 13 houses have got
to band together and work as a team.
SAE and Theta Xi did not do that.
1 don't know if there will be a bonfire
next year. One thing is for sure — be
cause of the environmentalists and the
administration, it will be much
tougher to get one. And if there is no
bonfire next year, I feel sure that
another Stanford tradition will go
down the tubes.
I don't care what they say — there
just wasn't the spirit this year without
the bonfire. For that, I, as a member of
the fraternity system, would like to
apologize to the Stanford community.
I sincerely hope that there will be bet
ter cooperation and more interest next
year — we'll need it.
