# Letters: Carter advisers, 'Bugsy'

Omissions
Bill Evers' column of Nov. 15 paint
ing Jimmy Carter and his advisers as
either cold warriors or Wilsonian
meddlers omitted some important in
formation.
Evers cited Anthony Lake, who res
igned from the National Security
Council in protest against the U.S. in
vasion of Cambodia, as a "possible ex
ception" among Carter advisers who
still adhere to cold war policies.
But Lake, according to Evers, will
probably get only a minor job in the
new administration because he is
"viewed by Carter as a quitter, accord
ing to columnists Evans and Novak."
What Evers did not say is that Carter
has to handle the entire transition in
foreign policy between the Ford and
Carter administrations — one of the
most important responsibilities he
could assign.
Evers covered his bets by charac
terizing Lake as a Wilsonian interven
tionist with "the mentality of a
bishop." But Lake, in the introduction
to a recent book. The Vietnam Legacy,
offers a scathing analysis of the cold
war policies that led to U.S. interven
tion in Indochina and indicates that
the days when the United States dic
tated terms to the rest of the world for
its own economic benefit are, or
should be, over.

After emphasizing that the problems
facing the world are human problems
— food and fuel shortages, environ
mental damage, etc. — Lake con
cludes: "Perhaps the greatest chal
lenge to American foreign policy mak
ers in the next generation will be to
ffnd constructive ways to cooperate
with other nations in 'managing in
terdependence'. . ." This is far from
advocacy of unilateral intervention.
Evers did not mention that another
pre-inauguration appointee of Carter's
is Congressman Charles Digges, who
went to Ceneva as Carter's representa
tive at the meetings between Rhode
sian officials and leaders of the Zim
babwe independence movement.
Digges is head of the Congressional
Black Caucus and has been so out
spoken against apartheid that for five
years, until this week, he was denied
admission to South Africa.
Finally, Evers did not deal with Car
ter's campaign promises to try to re
duce the military budget and cut arms
sales abroad. It was announced this
week that several Carter advisers, in
cluding Paul Warnke. Richard Gard
ner and Cyrus Vance, took part in a
panel whose report calls for agree
ments with the USSR to freeze military
spending, limit conventional arms,
and reduce the sale of arms abroad.
These are hardly the proposals of cold

warriors.
Carter undoubtedly won't bring
about a sudden reversal of the foreign
policy that has brought poverty, war,
and brutal dictatorship to much of the
world during the past 30 years. But
there is evidence that he will try to
limit the excesses of the past.
Some of the billions we currently
spend on arms may be devoted instead
to social purposes; Africans seeking
self-determination may be spared the
prospect of U.S.military intervention.
We should strongly urge that Carter do
better, but it serves no useful purpose
at this poi nt to distort his real position.

'Bugsy's' bad music
Who is this Howard Baldwin? Any

one who can call Fail! Williams "bril
liant" should be forced to eat Stern
food.
I mean, Paul Williams is a musical
farce, a man-boy devoted to over
orchestration and lack of melodic di
rection in his songs. What is worse is
that in order to see "Bugsy Malone,"
which is supposed to be a funny
movie, I will have to sit through two
hours of Williams' self-indulgent
music.
I'm sorry, but he who commends
Paul Williams, a middle-aged twelve
year-old himself with over long
bleached hair, does not get my vote for
"Best Reviewer."
I suppose this Baldwin was once a
Marv Throneberry fan, too!
