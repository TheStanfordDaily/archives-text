# CIA fails in prime responsibility

Exactly what is the alleged official
function of the American Central Intel
ligence Agency (CIA)? I have been led
to believe that the CIA was organized
for the protection of the "national sec
urity" of the American public, that is,
the physical protection of the Ameri
can nation and its people, and the de
fense of the form of government that
we have developed over the last two
centuries. Is there any evidence that
the United States actually has been
protected from imminent sinister
events by the CIA since World War II?
All of the most publicized activities
of theCIA during the last 15 years have
had little to do with the protection of
American citizens as a whole, either by
preventing war or promoting human
rights in the United States or in any
country in which Americans are in re
sidence.
Most unpopular
Rather, it seems, the CIA has in
volved itself in the most unpopular ac
tivities conceivable. It has repeatedly
interfered with the governments of
other countries, either through assas
sination attempts, bloodily unsuccess
ful coups, or installation of military
dictators who have, in every case, op
posed the will of the majority of the
citizens of the nation.
This is beginning to appear to be a
very roundabout way of protecting the
"national security" of the United
States. In fact, I do not perceive any
connectionatall between theactivities
of theCIA and national security. What,
then, is the CIA trying to accomplish?
If one examines a few of the ClA's
main projects over the past five years, a
pattern begins to emerge. Through its
efforts, the CIA has managed to assas
sinate the democratically elected pres
ident of Chile, has fervently buoyed up
the repressive totalitarian South Ko
rean government and has worked
hand-in-hand with another of the be
neficiaries of its planned coups, the
Shah of Iran.
Lots of money
In each case, the only ad ,,c intage to
be derived by us from these activities is
that a group of Americans are making a
lot of money. If South Korea did not
require massive aid in maintaining its
present defense capability, a substan
tial chunk of incomeand jobs would be
lost by the American aircraft and mis
sile industries.
If Salvador Allende had continued
as leader of the Chilean democracy,

many American interests may have
been nationalized, with a loss of min
ing rights of minerals crucial to
American manufacturing, and the
possible forfeit of at least part of pri
vate Americans' investments.
The prime example of this motive is
in Iran. Since the United States'
friendship with the Shah has de
veloped substantially over the past
five years, a large market for American
goods has opened.
Lavish
The Shah's armed forces have been
lavishly outfitted by the United States,
not to mention the employment of
25,000 American military advisors by
Iran and the satellite system that Stan
ford was involved in designing, which
allegedly will be used by the Iranian
secret police (SAVAK) in tightening
the Shah's grip on all dissent in the
country.
This points out the most obvious
service provided by the CIA. Its ac
tivities help create a demand and then
sell American products and maintain
access by the United States to essential
resources that are unavailable or
scarce in the United States. Without
these foreign markets, the American
economy would be forced to contract
substantially, which, of course, would
have very serious implications for our
currently inflated life style.
In a bind
American capitalism now finds it
self in such a bind that the business
generated in Iran, South Korea, for
merly in South Vietnam, and in vari
ous other puppet nations of the United
States matters more to the American
corporate leaders and government
than does the freedom and the very
lives of the unfortunate subjects of the
CIA-supported regimes.
And the suffering caused by this de
testable state of affairs has not stopped
at the borders of the affected nations,
but it has entered our own country in
the form of the Iranian SAVAK and the
South Korean "hit men" commis
sioned by President Park Chung Hee.
Recently, a news story reported that
in Los Angeles, in the largest Korean
settlement outside of Korea, American
citizens of Korean descent have been
terrorized by the Korean analogy to
"Mafia"-type hit men who are charged

with the task of elimination of opposi
tion to the tyrannical regime of Park.
Seek and destroy
Similarly, the College Press Service
has reported that U.S. government of
ficials are looking the other way as the
SAVAK enter our country to seek out
and destroy Iranian students' opposi
tion to the fascist practices of the Shah.
The United States has always jeal
ously protected those individuals who
have sought "asylum" from anti
capitalist countries such as the Soviet
Union or Vietnam. Yet, if those people
were to seek protection from the
tyranny of a nation that is actively con
tributing to our economy, then the vic-

Tims may as well save their effort.
This is a most abhorrent state of af
fairs, that American citizens and resi
dents cannot expect to be protected
from foreign manipulation and re
venge. It is this instance that our "na
tional security" is indeed threatened,
yet the CIA has little, if any, concern
for it.
Is the international network of intel
ligence agencies only a tool of the
ricn? I really would like to think that i'
is not, but all evidence points in thai
direction.
