# Western Civ rule a step back
## 
### 
John Walsh

In recent months, several professors
have suggested that students do not
actively seek education, but rather
wait passively for faculty to serve up
knowledge on a silver platter. At least
12 professors have apparently decided
that they should do just that, judging
by their manifesto in the Nov. 18 Daily
advocating the imposition of specifi
cally required courses upon under
graduates.
Arguing that preprofessionalism
and a lack of "standards" erode the
quality of undergraduate education,
the professors conclude that some
thing similar to a Western Civilization
course would rejuvenate the ideal of a
liberal education.
At issue is not the merit of such a
course, but the question of who should
decide whether or not a particular stu
dent should take a particular course.
The professors feel that they, or at least
the institution, are better qualified
than a student to say what is approp
riate for that student.
Already thinking
Revealingly, they write, "it used to
be taken for granted that if students
came to college, it was because they
wished to be made to think, this being
accepted as an essential part of a col
lege education." Does the possibility
occur to them that undergraduates al
ready do think, indeed think for them
selves, and come to college partly in
order to develop for themselves their

own thinking?
If the professors doubt that under
graduates have the self-discipline or
intelligence to formulate satisfactory
academic programs, how do they ex
pect students to learn these qualities
while being spoon-fed a structured
curriculum?
Professors are intelligent people,
superior to students in academic
knowledge, but this does not mean
that their judgment in general is better
than that of students. I see no good
reason to believe that professors
should determine for a student the na
ture of the student's intellectual needs.
Self-determination
"Standards" need not be imposed
from above, but can also be self
determined. The competitive pressure
which the professors cite exemplifies
the degree to which Stanford students
set difficult goals for themselves. Why
should one presume that further stan
dards must be dictated to us? As for
grades, they could experience infla
tion or deflation regardless of the ex
tent to which course selection is con
strained.
Preprofessionalism may well detract
from liberal education, but the most
effective measure against preprofes
sionalism might well be a reduction in
the unemployment rate. Having tenure
would seem to make speaking of
de-emphasizing "success or failure in
the job market" at least subconsciously
easier. Still, preprofessional students I

have known have somehow managed
to take a broad range of courses.
Backlash
The late '60s and early 70s were an
era of educational innovation and ex
perimentation; the current backlash is
not the first time in human history that
a period of reaction has followed one
of progress.
Having chosen Stanford for the free
dom and responsibility it allowed stu
dents, I'll be relieved to graduate be
fore the place becomes a glorified high
school. The shame is that professors
who are actively concerned about the
quality of liberal education will prob
ably be the ones who do the most dam
age to that education.
A paternalistic set of requirements
will discourage independent critical
thought, not foster it. We already re
quire students to diversify their prog
rams; in my opinion students can best
choose the appropriate form for that
diversity.
Perhaps professors who value the
development of critical thought would
be best advised to lecture less and to
discuss more — to sacrifice some re
ceived doctrine for the sake of creative
thinking. Would that not represent a
more substantive contribution to qual
ity education than mandatory courses,
proctored examinations and lower
grades?

In recent months, several professors
have suggested that students do not
actively seek education, but rather
wait passively for faculty to serve up
knowledge on a silver platter. At least
12 professors have apparently decided
that they should do just that, judging
by their manifesto in the Nov. 18 Daily
advocating the imposition of specifi
cally required courses upon under
graduates.
Arguing that preprofessionalism
and a lack of "standards" erode the
quality of undergraduate education,
the professors conclude that some
thing similar to a Western Civilization
course would rejuvenate the ideal of a
liberal education.
At issue is not the merit of such a
course, but the question of who should
decide whether or not a particular stu
dent should take a particular course.
The professors feel that they, or at least
the institution, are better qualified
than a student to say what is approp
riate for that student.
Already thinking
Revealingly, they write, "it used to
be taken for granted that if students
came to college, it was because they
wished to be made to think, this being
accepted as an essential part of a col
lege education." Does the possibility
occur to them that undergraduates al
ready do think, indeed think for them
selves, and come to college partly in
order to develop for themselves their

own thinking?
If the professors doubt that under
graduates have the self-discipline or
intelligence to formulate satisfactory
academic programs, how do they ex
pect students to learn these qualities
while being spoon-fed a structured
curriculum?
Professors are intelligent people,
superior to students in academic
knowledge, but this does not mean
that their judgment in general is better
than that of students. I see no good
reason to believe that professors
should determine for a student the na
ture of the student's intellectual needs.
Self-determination
"Standards" need not be imposed
from above, but can also be self
determined. The competitive pressure
which the professors cite exemplifies
the degree to which Stanford students
set difficult goals for themselves. Why
should one presume that further stan
dards must be dictated to us? As for
grades, they could experience infla
tion or deflation regardless of the ex
tent to which course selection is con
