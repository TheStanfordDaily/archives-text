# Rehire Christiansen
##

Daryl Morton

Jack Christiansen has been fired!
This culminates the two-year efforts of
the gleeful, joyous and wealthy south
ern California alumni who have said
they're tired of being mocked by weal
thy UCLA and USC alumni.
The Athletic Department has been
bought off to satisfy the whims of our
most elite. This is not a proud moment.
Our leader, with dollar signs in his
eyes, says this is a step forward. For
ward to what? We all had better ask
that question.
The Athletic Department has been
running helter-skelter since 1972
when Athletic Director Joseph Ruetz
took over. But Nov. 19, 1976 is Stan
ford's darkest hour. Contrary to popu-

lar opinion, football does not run a
university — the university runs col
lege athletics for the students. We have
all heard this at Stanford.
Our university is made up of stu
dents, faculty, staff and alumni — all
alumni, not just a few. Anyone who
sits idly by without voicing a strong
opinion is just as guilty as whoever
controls Ruetz.
I find it very hard to believe that just
one man could be so insensitive to the
whole situation as Ruetz is made to
appear. What saddens me is not only
the pressure of winning, but the belief
that winning is everything.
What is our next step? Shall we pro
vide our future superstars with baby
blue Cadillacs or perhaps Rolls
Royces? Gone are the d§ys of the
straightforward philosophy that edu
cation is the prime purpose for choos
ing an institution of higher learning. It
was a well-known philosophy at Stan
ford.
Joe Paterno of Penn State once said
at a Stanford senior sports banquet that
Stanford should be proud of its athletic
philosophy which keeps athletics in
perspective. We can no longer chide
and ridicule such athletic factories as
Ohio State, Michigan and yes, even
use.
Now, I haven't always agreed with
Christiansen's coaching moves, but
what coach, professor, boss or anyone
else who's in charge of people has been
backed by 100 per cent of the people al 1
of the time? The infamous quarterback
controversy's saddest aspect was that
the decision was never left to Chris.
How many of us would hold up as
admirably under the intense pres
sure? What would we do if a situation
were presented to make a decision and
everyone vehemently disagreed with
our decision? And when it was finally
over, a man who stood up for his con
victions realized the consequences.
Money talks.
Joe Ruetz, Stanford is not a football
factory and never will be. I personally
refuse to support Stanford athletics fi
nancially or in any other way until this
terrible situation is rectified.
I plea for united efforts of everyone
associated with a once-proud univer
sity to not rest until 1) Christiansen
and staff are rehired with full compen
sation for this totally ludicrous situa
tion and 2) Ruetz's resignation is ac
cepted.

Royces? Gone are the d§ys of the
straightforward philosophy that edu
cation is the prime purpose for choos
ing an institution of higher learning. It
was a well-known philosophy at Stan
ford.
Joe Paterno of Penn State once said
at a Stanford senior sports banquet that
Stanford should be proud of its athletic
philosophy which keeps athletics in
perspective. We can no longer chide
and ridicule such athletic factories as
Ohio State, Michigan and yes, even
use.
Now, I haven't always agreed with
Christiansen's coaching moves, but
what coach, professor, boss or anyone
else who's in charge of people has been
backed by 100 per cent of the people al 1
of the time? The infamous quarterback
controversy's saddest aspect was that
the decision was never left to Chris.
How many of us would hold up as
admirably under the intense pres
sure? What would we do if a situation
were presented to make a decision and
everyone vehemently disagreed with
our decision? And when it was finally
over, a man who stood up for his con
victions realized the consequences.
Money talks.
Joe Ruetz, Stanford is not a football
factory and never will be. I personally
refuse to support Stanford athletics fi
nancially or in any other way until this
terrible situation is rectified.
I plea for united efforts of everyone
associated with a once-proud univer
sity to not rest until 1) Christiansen
and staff are rehired with full compen
sation for this totally ludicrous situa
tion and 2) Ruetz's resignation is ac
cepted.

Jack Christiansen has been fired!
This culminates the two-year efforts of
the gleeful, joyous and wealthy south
ern California alumni who have said
they're tired of being mocked by weal
thy UCLA and USC alumni.
The Athletic Department has been
bought off to satisfy the whims of our
most elite. This is not a proud moment.
Our leader, with dollar signs in his
eyes, says this is a step forward. For
ward to what? We all had better ask
that question.
The Athletic Department has been
running helter-skelter since 1972
when Athletic Director Joseph Ruetz
took over. But Nov. 19, 1976 is Stan
ford's darkest hour. Contrary to popu-

lar opinion, football does not run a
university — the university runs col
lege athletics for the students. We have
all heard this at Stanford.
Our university is made up of stu
dents, faculty, staff and alumni — all
alumni, not just a few. Anyone who
sits idly by without voicing a strong
opinion is just as guilty as whoever
controls Ruetz.
I find it very hard to believe that just
one man could be so insensitive to the
whole situation as Ruetz is made to
appear. What saddens me is not only
the pressure of winning, but the belief
that winning is everything.
What is our next step? Shall we pro
vide our future superstars with baby
blue Cadillacs or perhaps Rolls
Royces? Gone are the d§ys of the
straightforward philosophy that edu
cation is the prime purpose for choos
ing an institution of higher learning. It
was a well-known philosophy at Stan
