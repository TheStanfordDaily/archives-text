# Palo Alto seeks larger board for its drug treatment program
## 
### Marc Strassman 
The Palo Alto chapter of Narcanon, a
drug treatment program, has come
under fire for running a program that is
costing the city over $2000 per client
and for its refusal to expand its board
of directors.
According to Palo Alto city records,
only seven drug abuse clients have
been treated during the first 10 months
of Narconon's contract with the city.
Palo Alto pays Narconon $1250 a
month as well as $250 for each client
who meets certain treatment stan
dards.
Mary Patterson, deputy executive
director of Narconon, said the low
number of certifiably treated clients
did not accurately reflect the prog
ram's real level of activity. She said
Narconon treats a substantial number
of individuals who have already gone
off hard drugs, but because of the
treatment criteria included in the city
contract, cannot count these persons
as successfully treated clients.
Alec Andrus, Palo Alto's liaison of
ficer to the program, said a resolution
requiring the five-person board of di
rectors of Narconon to enlarge itself in
order to provide for "significant com
munity involvement" in the program
within 90 days was submitted at a
council meeting in July.
He said the formal motion was with
drawn when the council agreed it had
adequately expressed its feelings by
proposing the measure.

Andrus said that he expects the ci
ty's relations with Narconon to be con
sidered at its meeting on Dec. 13 or 20.
Patterson, who directs a staff of
eight, said "expanding the board of di
rectors to 25 would be like having
three chiefs for every Indian." (Most
community organizations with city
contracts have around 20 members on
their executive boards, according to
Andrus.)
The executive board originally con
sisted of three members: Susan Brodie,
John Brodie and Frank Gerbode, all
members of the Church of Scientology
and the latter a resident of Los
Angeles.
Two more members who are not Sci
entologists have recently been added
to the board.
Nate Jessup, executive director of
Narconon and, according to Patterson,
a Scientologist, said in a letter to the
city council staff that the Narconon na
tional office in Los Angeles could not
allow the expansion of the board of
directors because it was concerned
that a majority of the board would not
be familiar with the "technical proce
dures" derived from the work of
Church of Scientology founder L. Ron
Hubbard.
Patterson said the recent creation of
an advisory board with nine members,
some of whom may eventually become
executive board members, constitutes
compliance with the council directive
that "specific steps" be taken to in

crease community representation in
the program.
Patterson said the national Narco
non office's opposition to having a
majority of executive board members
who were unfamiliar with Scientology
"technical procedures" did not con
flict with having a majority of non-
Scientologists as counselors on the
treatment staff. She referred to subtle
distinctions between supervising and
counseling and added that much of the
treatment is conducted by clients
working with each other.
