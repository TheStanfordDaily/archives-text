San Francisco (AP) — An antiwar group here says
President-elect Jimmy Carter's announced intention to issue a
blanket pardon to Vietnam draft evaders may not be the best thing
for the evaders.
"It's a contradiction in terms," Jerry Shenk, of the Central Com
mittee for Conscientious objectors here, said Saturday. "Pardons
are for people who are guilty of a crime. Draft evaders have not been
convicted of anything."
Shenck said his organization is contacting as many evaders as
possible to tell them they have a good chance of being acquitted if
they take their cases to the courts.
"We are telling them that before they accept one of Carter's
pardons, they should contact a lawyer and see if there is still a case
against them," he said noting that many evaders who left the
country later learned that they never were indicted.
Howard Denike, a San Francisco attorney who represented sev
eral persons who returned to the country under President Gerald
Ford's amnesty program, says,"The big problem is Carter is over
looking deserters."
He said the number of those who deserted or who received
undesirable discharges is much higher than the number of evaders
who will be pardoned.
Denike, however, did acknowledge that Carter has said he would
deal with deserters on a case-by-case basis. "He can call on the
various military departments to set up some sort of machinery
which would allow for unconditional pardons for at least some of
the military offenders — those who were in and left," the attorney
said.
On Saturday, press secretary Jody Powell said that Carter is
following through on a campaign promise by preparing a blanket
pardon of Vietnam draft evaders that will be issued during his first
week in office.
