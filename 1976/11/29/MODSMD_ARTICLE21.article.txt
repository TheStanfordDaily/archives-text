# Teacher groups to end segregation
## 
### 
Baton Rouge, La. (AP) —
The last two segregated teacher
organizations in the country,
one mostly white and the other
mostly black, are expected to
announce a merger today.
Officers of the white Louisiana
Teachers Association and the
black Louisiana Education As
sociation scheduled a news con
ference in Baton Rouge to dis
close the results of secret votes
taken at separate state conven
tions last week.
Debate at the conventions
heavily favored merger, and the
executive board of the white

group has voted in favor of
merger. Louisiana is the last
state in the union with segre
gated teachers associations.
Merger, if it comes, would take
place under a six-year plan with
race ratios as rigid as those of the
court decisions which ended the
segregated school system from
which the two organizations
sprang.
But at conventions a week ago,
scattered opposition to the
merger centered not on race but
on a dues increase.
The Louisiana Association of
Educators, as the new group
would be called, would be af
filiated with the 1.8 million
member National Education As
sociation, and teachers would
pay NEA dues of about $30 a year
in addition to state and local
dues.
The NEA pushed hard for the
merger, having expelled the
white group six years ago when
it refused an earlier plan, and
threatening to do the same to the
black group if it rejected this
plan.
