# Law officials debate value of Miranda rule

Washington (AP) — The neat
bundle of 2 X U by 3V2-inch cards
nestles in the right shirt pockei
of Patrolman J.L. Vincent's light
blue uniform.
Each time he makes an arrest
— 62 times in a recent four
month period on his high-crime
beat in northeast Washington —
he fishes out one of them.
Although he knows what it
says by heart, he reads it to the
suspect anyway.
"You have the right to remain
silent," he reads. "You are not
required to say anything to us at
any time. ..
It goes on for five paragraphs.
It is a "Miranda card" — car
ried by law enforcement officers
around the country because of a
1966 Supreme Court ruling spel
ling out the warning that police
must give suspects.
Miranda needed?
Now the Supreme Court has
been asked to decide whether
the 1966 rule is really needed to
protect an arrested person' rights
or whether it unduly interferes
with law enforcement.
lowa Atty. Gen. Richard
Turner, appealing an order over
turning the conviction of a
former mental patient for the
rape and murder of a 10-year-old
girl, says it does interfere.
President Gerald Ford agrees
with him, and President-elect
Jimmy Carter says society has
gone too far in protecting the
guilty. Some police and pro
secutors agree, others do not.
"At first every policeman was
upset about it," said Detective

Sgt. Winston Norman in
Washington, D.C. "But I don't
see where it really hurt us."
Increased cost
In Olympia, Wash., Police
Chief Chester Breuer said the de
cision has increased the cost of
law enforcement, but has been
worth it.
"I feel it has made a lot better
investigation," said Breuer.
"Because of the ruling, you are
going to spend a lot more time on
the investigation and not de
pend on a confession."
The little statistical informa
tion that is available, mostly
from the late '60s, indicates that
the Miranda rule has had little
impact on law enforcement.
The Miranda rule takes its
name from Ernesto Miranda, a
23-year-old school dropout who
was arrested in Phoenix, Ariz.,
on March 13, 1963, and charged
with the kidnaping and rape 10
days earlier of an 18-year-old
girl. After the victim picked him
out of a police lineup, two offic
ers took him into an interroga
tion room. Two hours later he
confessed.
Supreme Court
The case went to the Supreme
Court at a time of mounting con
cern over the pressure tactics of
some police forces to obtain con
fessions.
The heart of the 5-4 decision
was a paragraph by Chief Justice
Earl Warren which said in part:
"Prior to any questioning, the
person must be warned that he
has a right to remain silent, that
any statement he does make may

be used as evidence against him,
and that he has a right to the pre
sence of an attorney. . .. The de
fendant may waive effecuation
of these rights, provided the
waiver is made voluntarily. .. .
If, however, he indicates in any
manner and at any stage of the
process that he wishes to consult
with an attorney before speak
ing, there can be no question
ing."
Individual vs. society
As the Supreme Court moved
from a philosophy of protecting
individual rights in the Warren
court to a philosophy of what's
best for society in Chief Justice
Warren Burger's court, a reac
tion to the Miranda rule set in.
Generally, the justices have not

yet rolled back the guarantees of
the rule, but they have weakened
it.
In 1971, the Supreme Court
decided that statements other
wise inadmissible under
Miranda could be used to rebut
any alibis a defendant came up
with when he took the witness
stand.
"The shield provided by
Miranda cannot be perverted
into a license to use perjury by
way of a defense," Chief Justice
Burger wrote for a six-member
majority.
Williams case
The stage for the present as
sault on the rule was set in 1974
when U.S. District Court Judge
William Hanson of Fort Dodge,

lowa, threw out the conviction of
Robert Williams in the sex slay
ing of 10-year-old Pamela Pow
ers.
Williams had given himself
up in Davenport, lowa, two days
after the girl disappeared at the
Des Moines YMCA, where he
lived. He was given the required
warnings and called a lawyer in
Des Moines. As he was being
driven back to Des Moines, he
told a police detective that he
would tell him the whole story
after he had seen the attorney.
During the drive the detective,
Cleatus Learning, suggested to
him that if the girl's body were
not quickly located it might be
impossible to find it later be
cause a snowstorm was coming.

Learning also said, falsely, that
he already knew approximately
where the body was. About two
hours later, Williams led police
to the body.
Williams convicted
At Williams' trial, Learning
conceded that he had been try
ing to get information from the
suspect before he could see his
lawyer. Williams was convicted
and sentenced to life in prison.
In overturning the conviction.
Hanson said Learning had
"clearly and grossly violated"
Williams' constitutional right
not to be required to incriminate
himself. He found in substance
that the detective tricked the
suspect into confessing.
lowa's attorney general ar

gued that this should not make
the confession inadmissible as
long as it was given voluntarily.
Harlan dissent
In his dissent from the 19ht»
Miranda ruling, the late Justice
John Marshall Harlan said there
could be "little doubt that the
new rule would markedly de
crease the number of confes
sions."
Oddly enough, in view of the
furor about the ruling, no na
tional statistics have ever been
assembled to show Miranda's ef
fect on confession rates. Local
studies in the 19605, together
with recent interviews with
lawyers and police, indicate it
has had little.
