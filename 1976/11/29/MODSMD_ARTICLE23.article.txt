# SEO provides summer job information
## 
### 
Last year the Student Employment Office (SEO) had a
file of over 1000 summer job listings. Although many
students successfully used the SEO files, a majority
probably weren't aware of their existence. This year the
SEO aims to "advertise" the summer jobs and intern
ships.
Last year, the internships covered all fields from
health care to art history and were located in a wide
variety of geographical areas. There were both salaried
and volunteer positions. Virtually all internships, in
accordance with the definition, provided pre
professional experience of some kind.
Internships are already arriving and some deadlines
are only days away: the Newspaper Fund, Inc., Dec. 1;
Judicial Fellows Program, Dec. 1; and many, many
more.
In addition, there are already companies and busines
ses who are interviewing on campus for summer posi
tions. During winter quarter, chemical, mechanical, and

civil engineering majors will be able to interview with
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Tektronix, Inc., and
Hewlett-Packard.
While the SEO can tell you which companies will be
here for summer interviews, you can also find out from
the Career Planning and Placement Center's (CPPC's) ad
which appears every Monday in the Daily. You must
sign up for on-campus summer interviews one week in
advance.
You should also prepare a resume. You can make ap
pointments and pick up resume papers in the SEO.
Appointments should be made as soon as possible be
cause there are few interviewing spaces and many in
terested students.
Aside from the job listings, the SEO provides general
career information. In theCPPC, there is a career library
which contains not only occupational information but
binders on specific companies and businesses as well.
The CPPC also offers several career panels and prog

rams. All such panels and programs are advertised in
the CPPC Newsletter, Once Around the Ouad, and the
CPPC's Monday Daily ad.
If you're unsure about your career interests now, you
might consider going to Huston House, which offers
several vocational interest tests and counseling and
psychological services. For those who are applying to
graduate school, Huston House also offers the Miller's
Analogies Test which is occasionally accepted in lieu of
the Graduate Record Examination.
If you are sure of your career interests, but don't know
how to apply for jobs, the SEO and CPPC can also help
you here. Tbree workshops are offered weekly: self as
sessment on Tuesday, Resume Writing on Wednesday,
and interviewing onThursday. If interested, you should
sign up in the CPPC.
It undoubtedly seems early to start applying for a
summer job, but the SEO already has summer of '77
internships information for many organizations.
