## Poloists win NCAA title, sink UCLA 
### Chris Kamel 
Long Beach — Stanford's var
sity water polo team defeated
UCLA 13-12 last night at Bel
mont Plaza Pool to capture its
first NCAA water polo champ
ionship.
It was a game where team ef
fort was vital for a Card victory,
but it was the individual perfor
mances of seniors Drew
McDonald and goalie Chris
Dorst, in the final minutes,
which led the Cards to the NCAA
crown.
Stanford went into the final
quarter ahead at 10-9, but the
Bruins threatened, time after
time, only to be turned back by
Dorst. The senior goalie regis
tered two blocks, one of which
saved what looked to be a sure
goal after UCLA's Chris Vargas
had beaten a Stanford defender
to the goal. Dorst later stole the
ball coming out of the net after a
length-of-the-pool Bruin pass.
Shifting momentum
UCLA didn't score until a
penalty shot with two minutes
left in the game, bringing it to
within one goal of the Cards at
11-10. McDonald took up where
Dorst left off. With the momen
tum seemingly shifting to UCLA
after that goal, McDonald
quickly quieted the partisan
Bruin crowd with a top-of-the
perimeter shot only half a mi
nute later, one of three similar
shots in the game. He later added
a penalty shot that gave the
Cards a 13-10 lead which held
up.
Of course, give UCLA two
points for trying. And the Cards
nearly gave them three. Ahead
13-10 with 30 seconds to play,
the Bruins added a penalty shot,
and after Rob Arnold's open-net
shot hit the top of the cross bar,
UCLA came back with yet
another goal with 10 seconds
remaining. The Cards however,
ran out the clock and captured
their first national crown.
"We started to play in the sec
ond half," said head coach Art
Lambert. "We were just a little
jittery in the first half."
Card collapse
What Lambert was referring to
specifically was the Cards' play
in the second period. Dead
locked at 2-2 on two McDonald
long-range shots, the Cards got a
little "out of synch," according
to Lambert. Stanford was out
scored 4-3 in that period, but
what bothered Lambert was the
manner in which the Bruins
scored.
"We allowed three natural go
als," said Lambert, "and fouled
too much." Stanford accumu
lated 22 team fouls in the second
quarter alone, which sub
sequently led to three UCLA
scores.
But like the champions they

are, the Cards regrouped. Stan
ford came back to tie it 6-6 only
30 seconds after halftime, on a
Rick Johannsen pass to Arnold,
and after trading penalty shots,
the Cards went ahead 9-8 on a
Tom Angelo goal from Paul
Clark, which seemed to give
Stanford the edge it needed for
the rest of the game.
'Really happy'
"I am really happy we won it,"
said Lambert. "We really worked
hard for it."
McDonald and Doug Burke
paced the Stanford offense with
four goals each, McDonald regis
tering three natural goals.
"1 felt good (shooting) today,"
said McDonald. "It was my last
game; it was about time I felt
good."
Of course everyone felt good,
even Lambert and his assistant
Frank McNan, who admitted
that even being thrown in the
pool by the team felt good after
the win.
Three crowns
UCLA water polo coach Bob
Horn, who led the Bruins to
NCAA crowns in 1969,1970 and
1971 said, "This team was defi
nitely comparable to any team
that I've had in the NCAA's be
fore.
"Stanford capitalized a lot bet
ter on the breaks. We gambled,
and some of them didn't work."
The Cardinals set up the title
match with a 7-6 semifinal vic
tory over UC-Santa Barbara
Saturday. Dorst's block of a pen
alty shot, with 3:40 remaining,

saved the game for the Cardinals.
"The team was out of synch,"
Lambert said of the Santa Bar
bara game. Stanford could have
had a bigger lead against the
Gauchos, but the Cards blew two
good scoring occasions.
Stanford had a 5-2 halftime
lead over UCSB. Johanson,
Burke and Clark each tallied two
goals for Stanford.
"This was a big win for us,"
said Lambert.
In the other semifinal match,
the Bruins beat UC-Irvine 14-9.
Third best team
"I don't really care who we
play," said Lambert after his
Cards had made it to the finals.
"Both teams present problems
for us." Lambert felt that the An
teaters were the third best team
in the tournament.
Stanford, seeded first, didn't
look like the best team in its first
game of the tourney.
The Cards sunk unseeded
Arizona 9-8. "We were flat,"
commented Lambert. Dorst was
pulled at the half after trainers
suspected that he had suffered a
pulled groin muscle.
Johannsen and McDonald
each scored three goals in the
winning effort, and Lambert
cleared his bench.
Lambert, who came to Stan
ford in 1974, guided the Cardi
nals to a fourth-place NCAA
finish last year and a sixth-place
spot in his first year on the Farm.
