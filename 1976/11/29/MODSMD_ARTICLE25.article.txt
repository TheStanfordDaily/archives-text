# Eastern teams zap scotchers

### Debbie Carlton 
Philadelphia hosted — and dominated —
the AIAW Field Hockey Championships
over the Thanksgiving holidays, as a hard
fighting Stanford team can attest to.
West Chester, Ursinus and Lockhaven, all
Philadelphia schools, swept the first, sec
ond, and third place spots respectively.
University of Delaware rounded out eastern
dominance in the national tournament by
placing fourth, leaving western representa
tive Stanford to plot its revenge for next
year's title.
The Cards' failure to place is the only
thing coach Shirley Schoof regrets about the
team's performances, however. Stanford
played strong, aggressive, finely-tuned
hockey in each of its three tournament
games. In spite of the pressure the scotchers
refused to choke — a victory in itself — and
one which they have been aiming for all
season.
First loss
Stanford's first contest was against fourth
seeded William & Mary College. The un
seeded Curdinals scored the first goal of the
game 10 minutes into the first half, with a
hard shot by senior forward Kathy Levinson
from the top of the circle. Stanford could not
sustain the optimism produced by the score
however, as William & Mary took a 2-1 lead
just before halftime.
William & Mary cranked up another three
points in the second half, to bring the final
score to 5-1. It was an irony which the Cards
could have done without — they lost last

year's tournament contest by the same
score.
Schoof felt that Stanford played far
stronger hockey than the score suggests.
She explained, "William & Mary only won
in penetration time by 32 seconds. I didn't
feel that they really outplayed us. We were
down by our goal as much as they were
down by theirs, but we just weren't putting
the ball in."
Tough goalie
The Cards lost to Central Missouri in their
second tournament game 2-0. As in their
previous match, the scotchers were playing
masterful hockey, but their beautifully exe
cuted shots were simply not getting past
Central Missouri's goalie.
"We had 12 corners right in a row, but we
weren't putting them in, lamented the
Cards' coach.
Once more Schoof emphasized, the los
ing score did not entirely give credit where
credit was due. Stanford actually won the
game in penetration time and the coach had
nothing but praise for each individual on
the team.
'Supreme effort'
"Every player game a supreme effort/'
she stated. "The team played a beautiful
game — picture-book hockey."
"They all just outdid themselves — the
first two games," Schoof said of the scotch
ers. She admitted that it was "heartbreak
ing" to lose those games in light of such a
solid performance.
The Cards battled snow flurries and BYU

during their consolation match on Thurs
day, emerging with a 1-0 victory. Levinson
and Mandy Reid jointly delivered the ball
into the BYU goalie's hands and it was de
flected into the goal for the Cards' score.
'Physical game'
According to Schoof, the scotchers
played an unusually "physical" game
against BYU. "They played much more ag
ressively than they ever have. They wanted
this game very badly."
She also commented, "We actually
played better hockey in the first two games
of the tournament. I felt better about the two
games that we lost than the games that we
won."
Kudos were extended in particular to
Levinson, who played a superb last game of
her college career, and to freshman Nancy
White, who played an "outstanding game."
Schoof was greatly encouraged by the
scotchers overall performance at the na
tionals, stating, "They demonstrated total
concentration and never let up. They played
three consecutive consistently solid games,
instead of following their frequent pattern
of one good half — one bad half."
She enthused, "They finally learned how
to put it all together — they have matured
and developed during this tournament."
The Card coach is setting her sights high
for next year and with good reason. The
scotchers will lose only two players to
graduation, leaving a solid, experienced
team to fight for another chance to humble
eastern hockey teams.

dominance in the national tournament by

The Cards' failure to place is the only
thing coach Shirley Schoof regrets about the
team's performances, however. Stanford
played strong, aggressive, finely-tuned
hockey in each of its three tournament
games. In spite of the pressure the scotchers
refused to choke — a victory in itself — and
one which they have been aiming for all
season.
First loss
Stanford's first contest was against fourth
seeded William & Mary College. The un
seeded Curdinals scored the first goal of the
game 10 minutes into the first half, with a
hard shot by senior forward Kathy Levinson
from the top of the circle. Stanford could not
sustain the optimism produced by the score
however, as William & Mary took a 2-1 lead
just before halftime.
William & Mary cranked up another three
points in the second half, to bring the final
score to 5-1. It was an irony which the Cards
could have done without — they lost last

year's tournament contest by the same
score.
Schoof felt that Stanford played far
stronger hockey than the score suggests.
She explained, "William & Mary only won
in penetration time by 32 seconds. I didn't
feel that they really outplayed us. We were
down by our goal as much as they were
down by theirs, but we just weren't putting
the ball in."
Tough goalie
The Cards lost to Central Missouri in their
second tournament game 2-0. As in their
previous match, the scotchers were playing
masterful hockey, but their beautifully exe
cuted shots were simply not getting past
Central Missouri's goalie.
"We had 12 corners right in a row, but we
weren't putting them in, lamented the
Cards' coach.
Once more Schoof emphasized, the los
ing score did not entirely give credit where
credit was due. Stanford actually won the
game in penetration time and the coach had
nothing but praise for each individual on
the team.
'Supreme effort'
"Every player game a supreme effort/'
she stated. "The team played a beautiful
game — picture-book hockey."
"They all just outdid themselves — the
first two games," Schoof said of the scotch
ers. She admitted that it was "heartbreak
ing" to lose those games in light of such a
solid performance.
The Cards battled snow flurries and BYU

during their consolation match on Thurs
day, emerging with a 1-0 victory. Levinson
and Mandy Reid jointly delivered the ball
into the BYU goalie's hands and it was de
flected into the goal for the Cards' score.
'Physical game'
According to Schoof, the scotchers
played an unusually "physical" game
against BYU. "They played much more ag
ressively than they ever have. They wanted
this game very badly."
She also commented, "We actually
played better hockey in the first two games
of the tournament. I felt better about the two
games that we lost than the games that we
won."
