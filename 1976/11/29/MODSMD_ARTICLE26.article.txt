# Schader lost for season
## Cal Poly shocks Cards 
### David Georgette 
Coach Dick Dißiaso's "New
Era" of Stanford basketball re
gressed about two years Satur
day night when the Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo Mustangs drubbed
the Cardinals 79-61. Stanford's
efforts must have made many of
the 3568 fans inside of Maples
Pavilion wish they had been
among the lucky ones who
stayed away from the debacle.
If Arnold "Red" Auerbach
ever wants to make a "Round
ball" segment on what not to do
in a basketball game, he should
request a videotape of the game
from Channel 38. Bad passes,
missed free throws, poor field
goal shooting — everything a
coach would not want his team
to have — composed a large por
tion of Stanford's performance.
At least, though, none of the
Cards missed a slam dunk like
the Mustangs' forward Andre
Keys did.
"We did not play well," said
Dißiaso. "Our rebounding was
horrendous." Really, though,
rebounding was probably Stan
ford's best statistical effort.
The Cards outrebounded the
Mustangs 43-33, and did so
without forward George
Schader. The senior co-captain
underwent knee surgery for
damaged cartilage on Friday and
is expected to miss the entire
season.
Poor shooting
Center Jeff McHugh hit 2 of 13
from the field and guard Mike
Bratz managed to can only 2 of 9.
The lack of scoring by McHugh
and Bratz was especially felt for
almost 15 minutes. A Stanford
first half lead of seven points
evaporated to a 54-41 Cal Poly
blow-out nine minutes into the
second half.
And when Stanford applied a
man-to-man press with about 12
minutes to play the Mustangs
frequently broke open for easy
lay-ins. The Cards never got
closer than nine points after that.
Tom Wood, the Mustangs' assis
tant coach, said, "It wasn't a bad
press. We knew Stanford pres
sed. We worked against it in
practice."
In the first few minutes of the
game, the Mustangs played al

most as poorly as Stanford did
during most of the game. Cal
Poly trailed 9-2 five minutes into
the game. "The first 12 minutes
we couldn't catch the ball," said
Wood. "But after that, we got
over our nerves."
The inside scoring of Mustang
center Jeff Kerl combined with
guard Mike Bastone's outside
shooting put Cal Poly on top at
half, 31-29.
All-conference
Bastone, an all-conference
performer for Clendale Junior
College last year, tallied six more
of his game-high 16 points in the
first few minutes of the second
half to stretch the Mustangs'
lead.
Senior forward Gerald Jones,
Cal Poly's leading scorer the past
two years, hit six of his 16 points
during that time, also, paving
the way for a 76 per cent shoot
ing display by Cal Poly in the
second half.
The Cards assisted the Mus
tangs in their second half scorch
ing of the net by turning over the
ball 17 times for a game total of
25 miscues.
"I think they were better than
us," said Dißiaso. "I thought that
as soon as we lost George."
There are a lot of teams that are
better than the Cards minus
Schader. But Dißiaso said, "We
haven't fully been able to truly
judge the loss of George."
Perry shines
The Cards' best performances
were turned in by sophomore
guard Wolfe Perry, with 13
points and five rebounds, and

forward Jay Carter, 10 points and
seven rebounds.
But from a team perspective,
these figures offered little conso
lation. "Maybe it's a good
thing," said Dißiaso. "The
players will see they'll really
have to work. I'm quite sure the
team will not quit. The game
shows the problems we can ex
pect to have through the sea
son."
