## 
### Robert Mauro Staff writer 
Several Palo Alto firefighters in
haled a "slightly toxic" insecticide
when seven fire units responded to a
report of smoke in the Music Library
last Friday afternoon, according to
Palo Alto Fire Dept. Capt. Jack Foley.
Foley said two persons were inside
the building when the insecticide was
released as well as four fighere inhaled
the gas. No injuries were sustained.
According to Foley, fire regulations
require that the fire department be
notified of the intent to release an in
secticide at least 24 hours in advance
and that a sign be posted outside the
building stating the name and num
ber of the exterminator and the type

of chemical agent being used.
Foley said that he was not aware of
the extermination project until the
firefighters entered the structure. A
small "keep out" sign had been posted
outside the building.
According to Acting Battalion Chief
Frank Fiala, it is possible a notice of
intent to release an insecticide was sent
to the fire department but not re
ceived by appropriate personnel due
to the Thanksgiving holidays.
If the notice was not sent, Fiala said,
the fire department will request that
Rose Exterminator Company, which
released the gas, be cited by the coun
try fire marshal for violations of the
Uniform Fire Code.
The chemical agent used is harmful

to persons with asthma or respiratory
problems, Foley said.
F"iala said, "This was a really
hazardous situation. We can't allow
this to happen. We would be exposing
too many firefighters to too much un
necessary danger. Six firemen from
San Carlos were incapacitated for the
rest of their lives in a similar situation.
"There are very strict laws . . . the
Uniform Fire Code ... .It seems that
this time someone just got too careless.
We're not overly concerned with this
incident, we just want to make sure
that all the (exterminator) companies
obey the laws."
