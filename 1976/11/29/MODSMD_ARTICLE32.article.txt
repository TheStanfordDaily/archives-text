# Arizona votes to join Pac-8
## 
### Chris Baker 
The Arizona Board of Regents
voted 7-2 Saturday to allow
Arizona and Arizona State to
enter the Pacific-8 Conference if
invited, and the schools an
nounced later that they would
join the conference if asked to.
A spokesman for the two
schools expressed confidence
that they would receive the invi
tation to join. "After all, they've
asked us to go this far."
The matter will be resolved by
a vote of the Pacific-8 Presidents
and Chancellors when they hold
thier annual meeting Dec. 15 in
San Francisco. The Pac-8 charter
requires a unanimous vote for
conference expansion.
Bay Area block
The Associated Press reported
yesterday that "one Bay Area"
school would try to block the ex
pansion of the conference. Stan
ford President Richard Lyman
said that he has not been "en
thusiastic" about the proposal,
adding that these are many ques
tions to be settled.
But Lyman said he is still un
decided about the expansion
and that the Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation will study the
matter.
David Price, assistant Pac-8
executive director, said that
there are still a lot of problems to
be resolved. "The football
schedule is obviously the
biggest difficulty." Most Pac-8
schools, including Stanford, al
ready have their schedules filled
until the late 1980's.
Unbalanced slate
"The hope would be to bring
them into the league in 1978 for
football and 1978-79 for basket
ball," said Price. "The current
thought seems to be — stay with
the seven game conference
schedule and rotate two teams
off each year." Price added that
the "traditional" games would
be played each year.
Western Athetic Conference
Commissioner Stan Bates, who
stands to lose two of his best con
ference members said he was
unhappy, but added that the
WAC President's Council would
have to decide if it would allow
the two Arizona schools to
abandon five-to-ten year com
mitments to the league.
One WAC official has hinted
at the possibility of legal action
to prevent a move, based on the
WAC's contract with the Fiesta

Bowl, which pits the conference
football champion against a
guest team.
There is speculation that San
Jose State and San Diego State
will petition to join the WAC if
Arizona and Arizona State bolt
the conference.
Arizona State football coach
Frank Rush was a vocal oppo
nent of the plan, which was ap
proved by the Regents. Rush ar
gued that the two Arizona
schools will be second-rate foot
ball schools against Pac-8 pow
ers UCLA and USC for several
years.
Rush's Sun Devils, ranked
second in pre-season football
poll Is, were "second-rate" in the
WAC this year, finishing 4-7.
But Arizona, which sent out a
publicity packet to all west coast
newspapers extolling the vitues
of the school, thinks it will be a
step up in athletic excellence
and will provide a chance to
make more money because of the
better attendance in the Pac-8.

that they would receive the invi
tation to join. "After all, they've
asked us to go this far."
The matter will be resolved by
a vote of the Pacific-8 Presidents
and Chancellors when they hold
thier annual meeting Dec. 15 in
San Francisco. The Pac-8 charter
requires a unanimous vote for
conference expansion.
Bay Area block
The Associated Press reported
yesterday that "one Bay Area"
school would try to block the ex
pansion of the conference. Stan
ford President Richard Lyman
said that he has not been "en
thusiastic" about the proposal,
adding that these are many ques
tions to be settled.
But Lyman said he is still un
decided about the expansion
and that the Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation will study the
matter.
David Price, assistant Pac-8
executive director, said that
there are still a lot of problems to
be resolved. "The football
schedule is obviously the
biggest difficulty." Most Pac-8
schools, including Stanford, al
ready have their schedules filled
until the late 1980's.
Unbalanced slate
"The hope would be to bring
them into the league in 1978 for
football and 1978-79 for basket
ball," said Price. "The current
thought seems to be — stay with
the seven game conference
schedule and rotate two teams
off each year." Price added that
the "traditional" games would
be played each year.
Western Athetic Conference
Commissioner Stan Bates, who
stands to lose two of his best con
ference members said he was
unhappy, but added that the
WAC President's Council would
have to decide if it would allow
the two Arizona schools to
abandon five-to-ten year com
mitments to the league.
One WAC official has hinted
at the possibility of legal action
to prevent a move, based on the
WAC's contract with the Fiesta

Bowl, which pits the conference
football champion against a
guest team.
There is speculation that San
Jose State and San Diego State
will petition to join the WAC if
Arizona and Arizona State bolt
the conference.
Arizona State football coach
Frank Rush was a vocal oppo
nent of the plan, which was ap
proved by the Regents. Rush ar
gued that the two Arizona
schools will be second-rate foot
ball schools against Pac-8 pow
ers UCLA and USC for several
years.
Rush's Sun Devils, ranked
second in pre-season football
poll Is, were "second-rate" in the
WAC this year, finishing 4-7.
But Arizona, which sent out a
publicity packet to all west coast
newspapers extolling the vitues
of the school, thinks it will be a
step up in athletic excellence
and will provide a chance to
make more money because of the
better attendance in the Pac-8.
The Arizona Board of Regents
voted 7-2 Saturday to allow
Arizona and Arizona State to
enter the Pacific-8 Conference if
invited, and the schools an
nounced later that they would
join the conference if asked to.
A spokesman for the two
schools expressed confidence
that they would receive the invi
tation to join. "After all, they've
asked us to go this far."
