U.S. home buying nears record level
Washington — Despite studies showing that by conven
tional yardsticks American families are being frozen out of
the market by rising prices, families are buying homes in
record numbers this year.
Mortgage rates, a key factor in home costs, have tapered
off. People who already own their home are apparently
cashing in on the equity they've accumulated because
their houses have gone up in value.
Analysts say people are so determined to buy their own
homes that both spouses are holding down jobs.
This year's sales are providing one of the few bright
spots in current economic activity generally. Home buy
ing is increasing despite a widely cited study contending
that 85 per cent of American families could not afford the
median priced new home.
Australian dollar devaluted 17 1 /2%
Sydney, Australia — Australia devalued its currency
yesterday in a move aimed at making its wool, meat and
other exports more competitive on the world market,
stimulating foreign investment and bolstering sagging
foreign reserves.
The Australian dollar was devalued by a peacetime
record 17V2 per cent, giving it a new value of $1.0174 in
American money. This was a sharp cut from its official
value of $1.2354 at the end of trading Friday.
The devaluation should make such prime Australian
products as wool, beef, lamb and wheat cheaper abroad in
the immediate future. It may also make it cheaper for
tourists to visit what is considered one of the most expen
sive destinations in the world.
Probe set for Idaho nuclear facility
Seattle — A nuclear safety dispute that cost a Navy
atomic reactor operator his job has set off a government
probe of maintenance and safety precautions at the Navy's
Idaho nuclear training facility.
Electronics technician Alexander Williams alleges
the Navy reactor, where naval personnel are trained to
operate reactors like those on submarines and conven
tional craft, has been run in a shoddy manner.
Westinghouse operates and maintains the facility under
a contract with the government.
Three persons died at the same reactor 16 years ago
when it overheated and exploded. Although cir
cumstances were different in the current episode, Wil
liams has claimed the result might have been the same.
Yoshimura trial scheduled to begin
Oakland — Opening arguments in the weapons and
explosives trial of Wendy Yoshimura, onetime fugitive
companion of Patricia Hearst, are scheduled to begin to
day.
A jury of seven women and five men was sworn in last
Monday, after five weeks of exhaustive individual ques
tioning of prospective jurors.
Prosecutor Jeff Horner said the state will argue that
Yoshimura, 33, rented a Berkeley garage in August 1971
as a weapons storage facility for San Francisco Bay area
radicals.
Defense attorney James Larson is expected to tell the
jury that the defendant feared she would not get a fair trial
in 1972.

Spanish referendum creates disputes
Madrid — Spain's political opposition said yesterday
the government must recognize all political parties, in
cluding the Communists, as a condition for the participa
tion of opposition parties in a Dec. 15 referendum.
The referendum, called by Premier Adolfo Suarez, will
ask Spaniards if they want free parliamentary elections
next year, the first in more than 40 years.
As another condition for participation in the referen
dum, the opposition demanded that Suarez legalize labor
unions. The unions are now tolerated but still technically
illegal.
Carter addresses city representatives
Denver — Jimmy Carter said last night the nation's
cities have been the victim of unfavorable economic
policies, and he pledged a "broad and comprehensive
urban policy" to aid the troubled cities.
Carter spoke by telephone to the National Black Caucus
of Local Elected Officials which met here to honor retiring
NAACP Director Roy Wilkins.
Earlier in the day, the National League of Cities called
for Carter to create a council of urban advisers and prop
osed a multi-billion-dollar program it said is needed to
boost sagging city fortunes.
Soviet submarine recovered by U.S.
New York — The Glomar Explorer, a ship built by the
late Howard Hughes and used by the CIA, successfully
salvaged a Soviet submarine with its hydrogen-bomb tip
ped missiles from a depth of 16,000 feet in the Pacific
Ocean, according to Time magazine.
The current issue of the magazine quotes an uniden
tified senior U.S. Navy officer as saying that "it was all one
hell of a success" despite the story floated by the CIA in
March 1975 that the recovery had only partially suc
ceeded.

U.S. home buying nears record level
Washington — Despite studies showing that by conven
tional yardsticks American families are being frozen out of
the market by rising prices, families are buying homes in
record numbers this year.
Mortgage rates, a key factor in home costs, have tapered
off. People who already own their home are apparently
cashing in on the equity they've accumulated because
their houses have gone up in value.
Analysts say people are so determined to buy their own
homes that both spouses are holding down jobs.
This year's sales are providing one of the few bright
spots in current economic activity generally. Home buy
ing is increasing despite a widely cited study contending
that 85 per cent of American families could not afford the
median priced new home.
Australian dollar devaluted 17 1 /2%
Sydney, Australia — Australia devalued its currency
yesterday in a move aimed at making its wool, meat and
other exports more competitive on the world market,
stimulating foreign investment and bolstering sagging
foreign reserves.
The Australian dollar was devalued by a peacetime
record 17V2 per cent, giving it a new value of $1.0174 in
American money. This was a sharp cut from its official
value of $1.2354 at the end of trading Friday.
The devaluation should make such prime Australian
products as wool, beef, lamb and wheat cheaper abroad in
the immediate future. It may also make it cheaper for
tourists to visit what is considered one of the most expen
sive destinations in the world.
Probe set for Idaho nuclear facility
Seattle — A nuclear safety dispute that cost a Navy
atomic reactor operator his job has set off a government
probe of maintenance and safety precautions at the Navy's
Idaho nuclear training facility.
Electronics technician Alexander Williams alleges
the Navy reactor, where naval personnel are trained to
operate reactors like those on submarines and conven
tional craft, has been run in a shoddy manner.
Westinghouse operates and maintains the facility under
a contract with the government.
Three persons died at the same reactor 16 years ago
when it overheated and exploded. Although cir
cumstances were different in the current episode, Wil
liams has claimed the result might have been the same.
Yoshimura trial scheduled to begin
Oakland — Opening arguments in the weapons and
explosives trial of Wendy Yoshimura, onetime fugitive
companion of Patricia Hearst, are scheduled to begin to
day.
A jury of seven women and five men was sworn in last
Monday, after five weeks of exhaustive individual ques
tioning of prospective jurors.
Prosecutor Jeff Horner said the state will argue that
Yoshimura, 33, rented a Berkeley garage in August 1971
as a weapons storage facility for San Francisco Bay area
radicals.
Defense attorney James Larson is expected to tell the
jury that the defendant feared she would not get a fair trial
in 1972.

Spanish referendum creates disputes
Madrid — Spain's political opposition said yesterday
the government must recognize all political parties, in
cluding the Communists, as a condition for the participa
tion of opposition parties in a Dec. 15 referendum.
The referendum, called by Premier Adolfo Suarez, will
ask Spaniards if they want free parliamentary elections
next year, the first in more than 40 years.
As another condition for participation in the referen
dum, the opposition demanded that Suarez legalize labor
unions. The unions are now tolerated but still technically
illegal.
Carter addresses city representatives
Denver — Jimmy Carter said last night the nation's
cities have been the victim of unfavorable economic
policies, and he pledged a "broad and comprehensive
urban policy" to aid the troubled cities.
Carter spoke by telephone to the National Black Caucus
of Local Elected Officials which met here to honor retiring
NAACP Director Roy Wilkins.
Earlier in the day, the National League of Cities called
for Carter to create a council of urban advisers and prop
osed a multi-billion-dollar program it said is needed to
boost sagging city fortunes.
Soviet submarine recovered by U.S.
New York — The Glomar Explorer, a ship built by the
late Howard Hughes and used by the CIA, successfully
salvaged a Soviet submarine with its hydrogen-bomb tip
ped missiles from a depth of 16,000 feet in the Pacific
Ocean, according to Time magazine.
The current issue of the magazine quotes an uniden
tified senior U.S. Navy officer as saying that "it was all one
hell of a success" despite the story floated by the CIA in
March 1975 that the recovery had only partially suc
ceeded.

U.S. home buying nears record level
Washington — Despite studies showing that by conven
tional yardsticks American families are being frozen out of
the market by rising prices, families are buying homes in
record numbers this year.
Mortgage rates, a key factor in home costs, have tapered
off. People who already own their home are apparently
cashing in on the equity they've accumulated because
their houses have gone up in value.
Analysts say people are so determined to buy their own
homes that both spouses are holding down jobs.
This year's sales are providing one of the few bright
spots in current economic activity generally. Home buy
ing is increasing despite a widely cited study contending
that 85 per cent of American families could not afford the
median priced new home.
Australian dollar devaluted 17 1 /2%
Sydney, Australia — Australia devalued its currency
yesterday in a move aimed at making its wool, meat and
other exports more competitive on the world market,
stimulating foreign investment and bolstering sagging
foreign reserves.
The Australian dollar was devalued by a peacetime
record 17V2 per cent, giving it a new value of $1.0174 in
American money. This was a sharp cut from its official
value of $1.2354 at the end of trading Friday.
The devaluation should make such prime Australian
products as wool, beef, lamb and wheat cheaper abroad in
the immediate future. It may also make it cheaper for
tourists to visit what is considered one of the most expen
sive destinations in the world.
Probe set for Idaho nuclear facility
Seattle — A nuclear safety dispute that cost a Navy
atomic reactor operator his job has set off a government
probe of maintenance and safety precautions at the Navy's
Idaho nuclear training facility.
Electronics technician Alexander Williams alleges
the Navy reactor, where naval personnel are trained to
operate reactors like those on submarines and conven
tional craft, has been run in a shoddy manner.
Westinghouse operates and maintains the facility under
a contract with the government.
Three persons died at the same reactor 16 years ago
when it overheated and exploded. Although cir
cumstances were different in the current episode, Wil
liams has claimed the result might have been the same.
Yoshimura trial scheduled to begin
Oakland — Opening arguments in the weapons and
explosives trial of Wendy Yoshimura, onetime fugitive
companion of Patricia Hearst, are scheduled to begin to
day.
A jury of seven women and five men was sworn in last
Monday, after five weeks of exhaustive individual ques
tioning of prospective jurors.
Prosecutor Jeff Horner said the state will argue that
Yoshimura, 33, rented a Berkeley garage in August 1971
as a weapons storage facility for San Francisco Bay area
radicals.
Defense attorney James Larson is expected to tell the
jury that the defendant feared she would not get a fair trial
in 1972.

Spanish referendum creates disputes
Madrid — Spain's political opposition said yesterday
the government must recognize all political parties, in
cluding the Communists, as a condition for the participa
tion of opposition parties in a Dec. 15 referendum.
The referendum, called by Premier Adolfo Suarez, will
ask Spaniards if they want free parliamentary elections
next year, the first in more than 40 years.
As another condition for participation in the referen
dum, the opposition demanded that Suarez legalize labor
unions. The unions are now tolerated but still technically
illegal.
Carter addresses city representatives
Denver — Jimmy Carter said last night the nation's
cities have been the victim of unfavorable economic
policies, and he pledged a "broad and comprehensive
urban policy" to aid the troubled cities.
Carter spoke by telephone to the National Black Caucus
of Local Elected Officials which met here to honor retiring
NAACP Director Roy Wilkins.
Earlier in the day, the National League of Cities called
for Carter to create a council of urban advisers and prop
osed a multi-billion-dollar program it said is needed to
boost sagging city fortunes.
Soviet submarine recovered by U.S.
New York — The Glomar Explorer, a ship built by the
late Howard Hughes and used by the CIA, successfully
salvaged a Soviet submarine with its hydrogen-bomb tip
ped missiles from a depth of 16,000 feet in the Pacific
Ocean, according to Time magazine.
The current issue of the magazine quotes an uniden
tified senior U.S. Navy officer as saying that "it was all one
hell of a success" despite the story floated by the CIA in
March 1975 that the recovery had only partially suc
ceeded.
