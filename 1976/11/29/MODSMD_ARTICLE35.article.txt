# IFC head cites apathy
## Why the bonfire failed 
### Randy David 
Why, for the first time in 77 years,
was there no Big Game bonfire?
A general lack of support from the
fraternities, the administration and
traditional bonfire backers was the
major reason, according to Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC) President Jor
dan Schwartz.
"There is a general trend on the
campus toward apathy," Schwartz
said. "We needed people willing to
come out and contribute manual
labor," he added.
In the past, Pacific Telephone had
donated the poles, dug the holes for
them and set them. This year they pul
led out, according to Schwartz.
Schwartz said he did not know until
three days before the bonfire that the
phone company was not going to give
assistance. The bonfire was officially
called off on Thursday at 5 p.m. when
it was found the poles could not be set
by Friday morning, Schwartz said.
"The university's participation in
the bonfire was minimal," Schwartz
said. The first time it came out to help
was after the accident, according to
Schwartz. That Thursday afternoon,
two students sustained leg injuries
from a fallen pole, while attempting to
put up the poles without any mechani
cal assistance.
Steve Schwartz, a member of the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity, agrees with
the IFC president that the responsibil
ity for the failure of the bonfire lies
with the fraternities. "We needed at
least 10 people from each fraternity to
build the bonfire," Schwartz said.
Only a few individuals turned out to
help, he added.
"The bonfire should have been or
ganized months ago," Steve Schwartz
said. The IFC "shouldn't have waited
one week before to raise the money,"

he added.
IFC President Schwartz (no relation
to Steve Schwartz) admits the bonfire
got a late start. However, Schwartz
said, "the houses knew about the bon
tire since the beginning of October."
Only one person came forward in his
search for a bonfire chairman,
Schwartz said.
"This is an illustration of the poor
response to the bonfire â€” it's just a
general attitude," Schwartz said. "Ken
Remson (the bonfire chairman) did a
pretty good job, all things consi
dered," Schwartz added.
Bob Ottilie, last year's IFC president,
agreed that one individual cannot be
blamed for the failure of the bonfire.
"Although 10 fraternities supported
the bonfire, only three or four indi
viduals committed themselves," he
said.
"There should have been physical
cooperation between the university
and the IFC," said Steve Schwartz.
"How come the university decided
after two were hurt to finally come
out?" he asked.

Late Thursday afternoon, three men
from Plant Services attempted to help
the fraternity members put up the
poles, but were unsuccessful.
IPC President Schwartz says he is
hopeful the failure of the bonfire will
shake up people so they will support
future projects. The trend toward
apathy does not lie within the IPC only
Schwartz said. "It is something more
inherent in the Stanford community,"
he said.
The university was issued a citation
by the Bay Area Air Pollution Control
Board for holding an unauthorized fire
because a fire was lit early Friday
morning by some unknown individu
als. Dan DeYoung, director of service
operations, received the citation for
the university.
DeYoung also assured the control
board that if there was a bonfire next
year, the university would make sure
the site was guarded until the time of
the scheduled recreation fire. The uni
versity now must wait for a reply from
the Air Pollution Control Board decid
ing whether the university will be
fined.
