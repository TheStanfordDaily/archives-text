"The aim of the Scottish Nationalist
Party is self-government for Scot
land," said William Wolfe, president
of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP),
speaking before a small audience in
Bishop Auditorium last Tuesday even
ing about the prospects for indepen
dence in Scotland and the role of the
SNP in the movement.
Wolfe, dressed in a green kilt, began
with a presentation of the Scottish de
claration of independence and the
Scottish flag to a representative of the
ASSU Speaker's Bureau. The bureau
sponsored the speech.
Wolfe emphasized that the SNP,
which now controls 33 per cent of the
seats from Scotland in Great Britain's
Parliament, wished to make no at
tempt to force independence on the
Scots. Instead, only when there is a
clear majority in favor of indepen
dence should any negotiations begin
with the British government, Wolfe
said.
A current proposal before the British
Parliament to provide some internal
government for Wales and Scotland
furnishes little or no true indepen

dence, Wolfe claimed, and is simply a
ploy to undermine the growing sup
port for independence in those areas.
Although he denied that economic
motives for independence were prim
ary, Wolfe talked extensively about the
positive impact that North Sea oil re
venues would have on the Scottish
economy if it were separate from Bri
tain's.
Such reinvestment would be impor
tant to Scotland which, he said, is cur
rently a "branch" economy. In other
words, most outside investment in
Scotland is in the form of branches of
larger companies and branches are the
first to be shut down during a reces
sion.
He also said that current British pol
icy has prevented Scotland from be
coming the food exporter that it could
be.
If Scotland does gain its indepen
dence in the foreseeable future, the
SNP has prepared a platform on
foreign and domestic affairs. This in
cludes continued support for NATO,
but opposition to nuclear bases in
Scotland such as the U.S.Trident sub
marine base near Glasgow.
