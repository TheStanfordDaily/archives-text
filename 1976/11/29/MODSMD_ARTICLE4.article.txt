# Group searches for new football coach
## 
### Paul Bauman 
A committee much like the one that
came up with Dick Di√üiaso as Stan
ford's new basketball coach 18 months
ago will assist Athletic Director Joseph
Ruetz in choosing a new head football
coach.
The search committee, except for
one member, was named Friday. The
group, consisting of 15 persons, repre
sents a variety of university perspec
tives.
Included are four members from the
administration, three from the Athletic
Department, five from the Stanford
Athletic Board, one from the Buck
Club (a fund-raising group for Stan
ford sports), one from the Block "S"
Society (student and alumni letter
men) and one graduating football
player who has yet to be named.
The co-chairmen of the search
committee are Arthur Kates, chairman
of the Athletic Board, and Frank
Lodato, athletic board vice chairman.
Lodato served as chairman of the bas
ketball search committee.
Other board members
The other athletic board representa
tives are Miles Moore, a member of
Stanford's 1971 Rose Bowl team;
Joseph Mell, a Redwood City attorney;
and Richard Borda, an ex-Stanford
football player.
The Stanford Athletic Board con
sists of 30 members, the great majority
of whom are alumni. The board's func
tion is to advise President Richard
Lyman and Ruetz on Athletic Depart
ment policies.
Committee members from the uni
versity administration are Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon, Assoc.
Provost Ed Shaw, Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. Alan Waterman who is the
acting chairman of CAPER (Committee
on Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation), and Prof. Eugene Webb of
the Business School.
Athletic representatives
Athletic Department representatives
are Assoc. Athletic Director Pam
Strafhairn, Sports Information Direc
tor Gary Cavalli and water polo coach
Art Lambert.
Richard Berlin, chairman of the
Stanford Buck Club, and Richard
Madigan, the chairman of the Block

"S" Society, are also on the search
committee.
Asst. Athletic Director Ray Young
will serve as the search committee's
secretary, but will not have voting
power.
Ten contenders
Ruetz has been interviewing candi
dates for the head coaching job and his
list is reportedly down to 10 serious
contenders. He will refer the names of
seven or eight to the search committee.
The committee will interview candi
dates this week and next and then re
port its preference to Ruetz, who will
make the final decision. Ruetz has said
the decision will be made by mid-
December.
Among the people who have
applied for the job are Stanford assis
tants Dave Currey, Pete Kettela and

Norb Hecker and long-time USC assis
tant Marv Goux. None appears to be a
prime candidate at this point.
Two men who have been mentioned
as candidates, UC-Davis head coach
Jim Sochor and USC quarterback
receivers coach Paul Hackett, have not
as yet applied for the Stanford job.

Ruetz and the search committee will
be looking for a young coach well ver
sed in the passing game. That points to
Hackett. He is 29 and, as an assistant at
California, he helped quarterbacks
Steve Bartkowski and Joe Roth rise
from obscurity to national promi
nence.
Hackett, now in his first season at
USC, has seen Trojan quarterback
Vince Evans improve his completion
rate from 31 per cent in 1975 to 55 per
cent this year. Evans has said he re
spects the young assistant coach.
Nobody else at USC and UCLA
seems a likely choice because neither
is a passing team. But Cal is, and their
assistants Roger Theder and Max
McCartney are possibilities,
Ruetz has said his 10 candidates in
clude one professional assistant coach
and nine college head coaches or assis
tants. The pro could well be San Diego
assistant Bill Walsh, who served at
Stanford as an assistant under John
Ralston in the late '60s.
Cavalli said the strongest interest in
the opening at Stanford has come from
assistant coaches in the Pacific-8. If
Stanford does not choose Hackett,
Theder, McCartney or possibly UCLA
linebacker coach Jed Hughs, it will
probably go outside the conference for
its new head coach.
