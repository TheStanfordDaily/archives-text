zard threatened rescue efforts in
earthquake-shattered eastern Turkey
yesterday and the provincial governor
ordered all residents of the capital be
tween 18 and 65 drafted to help the
thousands of quake victims.
"We are afraid that some mountain
villagers who suvived the quake may
now freeze to death," said Muzaffer
Yuce, deputy governor of Van pro
vince, after the heavy snow began yes
terday morning. The temperature was
10 degrees fahrenheit and falling.
"We consider this snowstorm,
under the circumstances, as great a

calamity as the quake itself," Gov.
Ahmet Tosun said.
At least six villages in this moun
tainous area hit by Wednesday's quake
were reportedly still cut off, with not
even helicopters able to get in to bring
help.
Officials called for all available
snow-moving equipment to be rushed
into the area.
Tosun announced that he was put

speed up the task of bringing survivors
in from still-isolated and flattened
mountain settlements. All adults in
Van were ordered drafted, and all pri

ernment offices and bakery shops were
ordered to remain in operation 24
hours a day.
School teachers were told to report
to work immediately to help settle sur

schoolhouses.
Officials declined to release any new
figures on the death toll from the
quake. Some 3626 bodies had been re

nearby Caldiran and area villages by
Saturday, and officials said then the
final toll could be above 5000.
President F"ord has sent Commerce
