# Skogstrom baffles ASSU Senate
## 
### George Anders 
Election nights find most candidates — from
Jimmy Carter to Joss Cooney — anxiously await
ing that phone call or media bulletin which breaks
the results. Except for Roy Skogstrom.
Top vote-getter in the ASSU Senate election last
month, Skogstrom recalls he was partying the
night returns were announced. As one of seven
Chaparral staffers who ran for senator, Skogstrom
says, "We'd never won before and didn't have any
intention of doing it this time."
When two friends told him the results, his re
sponse was "Oh, come on." Only after several
reports was he sufficiently convinced to declare,
"God, this is really funny!"
Few agree on what kind of senator Skogstrom
has become. Sen. Dan Livingston says "he's carry
ing out everyone's worst fears" and contends that
other Chaparral slate members are "more embar
rassed by him than anything else."
The great rejoinder
But Sen. Jon Barth, also from the Chaparral
slate, praises Skogstrom's "great rejoinder" when
Alternate Sen. Tim Ferguson made an anti-
Chaparra/ remark at the first senate meeting.
Skogstrom proposed that Ferguson be declared a
national park so bears could dump on him.
And ASSU President Vic Petroff says he's been
"pleasantly surprised" by the performance of
Skogstrom and other Chaparral senators.
Skogstrom says, however, "We're going to
either have to quit, or be totally ludicrous or try to
abolish the senate. The senate doesn't fit in with
the Chaparral at all," he complains.
Influence
A senior, Skogstrom started writing for the
Chaparral only last fall. Since then, though, he
has "greatly influenced the writings of the
Chaparral hierarchy," according to Barth, a
three-year Chaparral veteran.

Skogstrom's poetry and prose are a barrage of
usually lewd puns. It's not an easy effect to create,
he says.
"I just think of associations for a few hours and
I'll have a whole list of words and some of them
will work and some won't." Many more potential
puns are lost, he says, before a few make it into the
final work."
In his first Chaparral essay, "The Rise of
Rome," Skogstrom has Mark Antony tell
Cleopatra, "Thy leaning towers causeth not
Galileo to drop his balls." After all, Cleopatra has
just declared:
O Antony, thou woulds't sure be a pleaser
Wert thou to have a column such as Caesar
Alas, before thy core a pinhole gapes!-
Af orgies thou art sent to get the grapes.
Amino acids
Last spring, Skogstrom took a course on humor
from Communication Prof. William Rivers. "It
helped me see what others think is funny,"
Skogstrom says. "But there's not that much theory
of humor." So, Skogstrom says, his own method
of writing humor is like building up from amino
acids.
It's an apt simile, coming from a biology major.
During his classes, Skogstrom says, "I'll be
amazed the whole period."
Yet he usually finds himself passing up study
ing to play football. Or volleyball. Or basketball.
The 6-foot-4 Skogstrom is a Renaissance man to
the intramural efforts of his house, Zeta Alpha
Phi.
When he does study, Skogstrom says he stays
up all night cramming for an exam. Otherwise, he
assertts "you can do pretty well here with no
work."
In Skogstrom's freshman year, that meant
straight "A"s. "He's a very bright young man.
with a bent for science," says Ed Shaw, assistant

to the provost and Skogstrom's former adviser.
"I'm not sure if he's found anything here that
challenges him."
Since freshman year, Skogstrom's grades have
slipped, although he has yet to get a "C."
Shaw notes that Skogstrom was "very competi
tive" when he came to Stanford. Skogstrom elabo
rates, saying "I wanted to be gorgeous. I wanted to
have the longest eyelashes, the biggest earlobes."
Instead, he now looks ultimately Scandinavian.
With his lean frame and immaculately styled
blond hair, Skogstrom looks like the man who
does Erik cigar commercials.
Skogstrom says he is coasidering doing graduate
work in biology. "If I want to have a good time for
another four years, then I'll go to grad school," he
says."I can picnic there for a while, too."
Poodle clipper
Skogstrom also maintains he is considering
nuclear poodle clipping as a career.
Either way. he says he'll first take a year off to
backpack. Despite one experience when he "in
gested weird drugs" while backpacking and then
was chased by a bear. Skogstrom says he usually
enjoys backpacking or riding motorbike trails in
his native Arizona.
Skogstrom moved to Scottsdale, Ariz, from
New York when he was two-and-a-half. He claims
he homesteaded on an acre of land there, raising
cactus and making tequila.
Hut Skogstrom also admits he attended Saguaro
High School in Scottsdale, where he says he was
"a real smartass in class."
He gleefully tells of one time he duped a secret
ary into going on the public address system to
read an announcement that the chess club would
be discussing the "Aynell Opening."
"Everyone was looking at me, because they fi
gured I'd done it,"he recalls. "Thirty-two
hundred people in the school were freaking out."

Amino acids
Last spring, Skogstrom took a course on humor
from Communication Prof. William Rivers. "It
helped me see what others think is funny,"
Skogstrom says. "But there's not that much theory
of humor." So, Skogstrom says, his own method
of writing humor is like building up from amino
acids.
It's an apt simile, coming from a biology major.
During his classes, Skogstrom says, "I'll be
amazed the whole period."
Yet he usually finds himself passing up study
ing to play football. Or volleyball. Or basketball.
The 6-foot-4 Skogstrom is a Renaissance man to
the intramural efforts of his house, Zeta Alpha
Phi.
When he does study, Skogstrom says he stays
up all night cramming for an exam. Otherwise, he
assertts "you can do pretty well here with no
work."
In Skogstrom's freshman year, that meant
straight "A"s. "He's a very bright young man.
with a bent for science," says Ed Shaw, assistant

to the provost and Skogstrom's former adviser.
"I'm not sure if he's found anything here that
challenges him."
Since freshman year, Skogstrom's grades have
slipped, although he has yet to get a "C."
Shaw notes that Skogstrom was "very competi
tive" when he came to Stanford. Skogstrom elabo
rates, saying "I wanted to be gorgeous. I wanted to
have the longest eyelashes, the biggest earlobes."
Instead, he now looks ultimately Scandinavian.
With his lean frame and immaculately styled
blond hair, Skogstrom looks like the man who
does Erik cigar commercials.
Skogstrom says he is coasidering doing graduate
work in biology. "If I want to have a good time for
another four years, then I'll go to grad school," he
says."I can picnic there for a while, too."
Poodle clipper
Skogstrom also maintains he is considering
nuclear poodle clipping as a career.
Either way. he says he'll first take a year off to
backpack. Despite one experience when he "in
gested weird drugs" while backpacking and then
was chased by a bear. Skogstrom says he usually
enjoys backpacking or riding motorbike trails in
his native Arizona.
Skogstrom moved to Scottsdale, Ariz, from
New York when he was two-and-a-half. He claims
he homesteaded on an acre of land there, raising
cactus and making tequila.
Hut Skogstrom also admits he attended Saguaro
High School in Scottsdale, where he says he was
"a real smartass in class."
He gleefully tells of one time he duped a secret
ary into going on the public address system to
read an announcement that the chess club would
be discussing the "Aynell Opening."
"Everyone was looking at me, because they fi
gured I'd done it,"he recalls. "Thirty-two
hundred people in the school were freaking out."

The people's choice
People are still puzzled that Roy Skogstrom (above), a member of the
Chaparral slate, received 477 votes in last month's ASSU Senate
election — more votes than any other candidate. "I can t believe that
guy won." Sen. Dan Livingston says. "It's because his name sounds so
strange,'' Sen. Jon Barth explains.
Election nights find most candidates — from
Jimmy Carter to Joss Cooney — anxiously await
ing that phone call or media bulletin which breaks
the results. Except for Roy Skogstrom.
Top vote-getter in the ASSU Senate election last
month, Skogstrom recalls he was partying the
night returns were announced. As one of seven
Chaparral staffers who ran for senator, Skogstrom
says, "We'd never won before and didn't have any
intention of doing it this time."
When two friends told him the results, his re
sponse was "Oh, come on." Only after several
reports was he sufficiently convinced to declare,
"God, this is really funny!"
Few agree on what kind of senator Skogstrom
has become. Sen. Dan Livingston says "he's carry
ing out everyone's worst fears" and contends that
other Chaparral slate members are "more embar
rassed by him than anything else."
The great rejoinder
But Sen. Jon Barth, also from the Chaparral
slate, praises Skogstrom's "great rejoinder" when
Alternate Sen. Tim Ferguson made an anti-
Chaparra/ remark at the first senate meeting.
Skogstrom proposed that Ferguson be declared a
national park so bears could dump on him.
And ASSU President Vic Petroff says he's been
"pleasantly surprised" by the performance of
Skogstrom and other Chaparral senators.
Skogstrom says, however, "We're going to
either have to quit, or be totally ludicrous or try to
abolish the senate. The senate doesn't fit in with
the Chaparral at all," he complains.
Influence
A senior, Skogstrom started writing for the
Chaparral only last fall. Since then, though, he
has "greatly influenced the writings of the
Chaparral hierarchy," according to Barth, a
three-year Chaparral veteran.

Skogstrom's poetry and prose are a barrage of
usually lewd puns. It's not an easy effect to create,
he says.
"I just think of associations for a few hours and
I'll have a whole list of words and some of them
will work and some won't." Many more potential
puns are lost, he says, before a few make it into the
final work."
In his first Chaparral essay, "The Rise of
Rome," Skogstrom has Mark Antony tell
Cleopatra, "Thy leaning towers causeth not
Galileo to drop his balls." After all, Cleopatra has
just declared:
O Antony, thou woulds't sure be a pleaser

New York when he was two-and-a-half. He claims
he homesteaded on an acre of land there, raising
cactus and making tequila.
Hut Skogstrom also admits he attended Saguaro
High School in Scottsdale, where he says he was
"a real smartass in class."
He gleefully tells of one time he duped a secret

read an announcement that the chess club would
be discussing the "Aynell Opening."
"Everyone was looking at me, because they fi
gured I'd done it,"he recalls. "Thirty-two
hundred people in the school were freaking out."

The people's choice
People are still puzzled that Roy Skogstrom (above), a member of the
Chaparral slate, received 477 votes in last month's ASSU Senate
election — more votes than any other candidate. "I can t believe that
guy won." Sen. Dan Livingston says. "It's because his name sounds so
strange,'' Sen. Jon Barth explains.
Election nights find most candidates — from
Jimmy Carter to Joss Cooney — anxiously await
ing that phone call or media bulletin which breaks
the results. Except for Roy Skogstrom.
Top vote-getter in the ASSU Senate election last
month, Skogstrom recalls he was partying the
night returns were announced. As one of seven
Chaparral staffers who ran for senator, Skogstrom
says, "We'd never won before and didn't have any
intention of doing it this time."
When two friends told him the results, his re
sponse was "Oh, come on." Only after several
reports was he sufficiently convinced to declare,
"God, this is really funny!"
Few agree on what kind of senator Skogstrom
has become. Sen. Dan Livingston says "he's carry
ing out everyone's worst fears" and contends that
other Chaparral slate members are "more embar
rassed by him than anything else."
The great rejoinder
But Sen. Jon Barth, also from the Chaparral
slate, praises Skogstrom's "great rejoinder" when
Alternate Sen. Tim Ferguson made an anti-
Chaparra/ remark at the first senate meeting.
Skogstrom proposed that Ferguson be declared a
national park so bears could dump on him.
And ASSU President Vic Petroff says he's been
"pleasantly surprised" by the performance of
Skogstrom and other Chaparral senators.
Skogstrom says, however, "We're going to
either have to quit, or be totally ludicrous or try to
abolish the senate. The senate doesn't fit in with
the Chaparral at all," he complains.
Influence
A senior, Skogstrom started writing for the
Chaparral only last fall. Since then, though, he
has "greatly influenced the writings of the
Chaparral hierarchy," according to Barth, a
three-year Chaparral veteran.

Skogstrom's poetry and prose are a barrage of
usually lewd puns. It's not an easy effect to create,
he says.
"I just think of associations for a few hours and
I'll have a whole list of words and some of them
will work and some won't." Many more potential
puns are lost, he says, before a few make it into the
final work."
In his first Chaparral essay, "The Rise of
Rome," Skogstrom has Mark Antony tell
Cleopatra, "Thy leaning towers causeth not
Galileo to drop his balls." After all, Cleopatra has
just declared:
O Antony, thou woulds't sure be a pleaser
Wert thou to have a column such as Caesar
Alas, before thy core a pinhole gapes!-
Af orgies thou art sent to get the grapes.
Amino acids
Last spring, Skogstrom took a course on humor
from Communication Prof. William Rivers. "It
helped me see what others think is funny,"
Skogstrom says. "But there's not that much theory
of humor." So, Skogstrom says, his own method
of writing humor is like building up from amino
acids.
It's an apt simile, coming from a biology major.
During his classes, Skogstrom says, "I'll be
amazed the whole period."
Yet he usually finds himself passing up study
ing to play football. Or volleyball. Or basketball.
The 6-foot-4 Skogstrom is a Renaissance man to
the intramural efforts of his house, Zeta Alpha
Phi.
When he does study, Skogstrom says he stays
up all night cramming for an exam. Otherwise, he
assertts "you can do pretty well here with no
work."
In Skogstrom's freshman year, that meant
straight "A"s. "He's a very bright young man.
with a bent for science," says Ed Shaw, assistant

to the provost and Skogstrom's former adviser.
"I'm not sure if he's found anything here that
challenges him."
Since freshman year, Skogstrom's grades have
slipped, although he has yet to get a "C."
Shaw notes that Skogstrom was "very competi
tive" when he came to Stanford. Skogstrom elabo
rates, saying "I wanted to be gorgeous. I wanted to
have the longest eyelashes, the biggest earlobes."
Instead, he now looks ultimately Scandinavian.
With his lean frame and immaculately styled
blond hair, Skogstrom looks like the man who
does Erik cigar commercials.
Skogstrom says he is coasidering doing graduate
work in biology. "If I want to have a good time for
another four years, then I'll go to grad school," he
says."I can picnic there for a while, too."
Poodle clipper
Skogstrom also maintains he is considering
nuclear poodle clipping as a career.
Either way. he says he'll first take a year off to
backpack. Despite one experience when he "in
gested weird drugs" while backpacking and then
was chased by a bear. Skogstrom says he usually
enjoys backpacking or riding motorbike trails in
his native Arizona.
Skogstrom moved to Scottsdale, Ariz, from
New York when he was two-and-a-half. He claims
he homesteaded on an acre of land there, raising
cactus and making tequila.
