## Opinions Editorials Pardon Iva Toguri 
### 
We support the appeal of Iva Toguri — ac
cused of having been "Tokyo Rose" during
World War II — for a presidential pardon from
her 1949 treason conviction.
Toguri, a Nisei who found herself stranded in
Japan after Pearl Harbor, took a job in 1943 with
Radio Tokyo, and was selected by Australian,
American and Filipino prisoners of war to be
one of 14 English-speaking broadcasters for
"Zero Hour," a radio show they directed for
American servicemen.
Ironically, the main reason she was unable to
leave Japan in September 1942 when the
Japanese and American governments had
worked out the red tape which kept her from
returning immediately to her home country
was the fact that her parents were interned in
the Gila River, Ariz., relocation camp for
Japanese Americans and were unable to send
her money for the voyage.
Although the Japanese intended the program
as a propaganda effort against the Allies, the
POWs used their control over the material used
to subtly destroy its propaganda value. Accord
ing to the Australian POW leader, Toguri was
selected because she was pro-American and
would not reveal the POW effort to the
Japanese.
Indeed, a Marine Corps intelligence officer
testified at her trial that, as a result of her coop
eration with the POW sabotage effort, the resul
tant broadcasts were "singularly free of prop
aganda." That opinion was echoed by the
U.S. Army occupation forces in Japan after the
war, which did an exhaustive investigation of
Toguri's activities and concluded that she had
committed no treasonous offense in making the
broadcasts. The Justice Department reached a
similar conclusion late in 1946.
In 1948, however, responding to pressure
from headline-grabbing tabloid journalists
such as Cosmopolitan magazine's Harry Brun
didge and jingoists such as Walter Winchell
and Kate Smith, the FBI reopened its investiga
tion. As a result, Toguri was arrested for the
third time, tried and found guilty of treason.
Justice Department documents recently re
leased under the Freedom of Information Act
indicate that the prosecution was aware that
Brundidge had suborned perjury in obtaining

testimony from Japanese citizens flown to the
United States at government expense. Indeed,
two witnesses who presented the most damag
ing evidence of American statements by Toguri
have since admitted that they lied at her trial at
Brundidge's request.
In fact, prosecutor Tom De Wolfe, in a 1948
memo from his Justice Department office, ad
mitted that Toguri was "a trusted and selected
agent of the Allied prisoners of war," that she
frequently expressed pro-American statements
during her Radio Tokyo employment and that
"the Government case must fail as a matter of
law because Government witnesses will dis
close that subject (Toguri) did not adhere to the
enemy or possess the requisite disloyal state of
mind."
Nonetheless, Toguri spent 6V2 years in prison
for making wartime statements her own pro
secutor privately admitted were "totally in
nocuous." She also lost her citizenship as a
result of the conviction and has been
threatened with deportation since.
The record of public pressure, jingoism, ad
missions of innocence by prosecutors and per
jured testimony by witnesses in itself demands
a full pardon. And Toguri's latest appeal may
be her last, since pardon petitions may be filed
only once each six years, and she is now 60.
But beyond Toguri's innocence of the
charges on which she was convicted lies the
question of what constitutes verbal treason in
wartime. During the Vietnam war, antiwar ac
tivists such as Jane Fonda gave interviews for
broadcast with Radio Hanoi designed to affect
the morale of American soliders.
We believe freedom of speech under the First
Amendment protects such speech and would
oppose prosecutions of these persons for their
statements. Even if Toguri had sympathized
with the Japanese and had attempted to under
mine American morale, we do not believe her
statements would have constituted treason.
We are hopeful, as is Toguri, that President
Gerald Ford, now freed from political pressures
by his defeat, will grant the pardon expediti
ously. If not, President-elect Jimmy Carter
should begin his administration on a positive
note by righting the government's 30-year-old
wrong against Toguri.

"the Government case must fail as a matter of
law because Government witnesses will dis
close that subject (Toguri) did not adhere to the
enemy or possess the requisite disloyal state of
mind."
Nonetheless, Toguri spent 6V2 years in prison
for making wartime statements her own pro
secutor privately admitted were "totally in
nocuous." She also lost her citizenship as a
result of the conviction and has been
threatened with deportation since.
The record of public pressure, jingoism, ad
missions of innocence by prosecutors and per
jured testimony by witnesses in itself demands
a full pardon. And Toguri's latest appeal may
be her last, since pardon petitions may be filed
only once each six years, and she is now 60.
But beyond Toguri's innocence of the
charges on which she was convicted lies the
question of what constitutes verbal treason in
wartime. During the Vietnam war, antiwar ac
tivists such as Jane Fonda gave interviews for
broadcast with Radio Hanoi designed to affect
the morale of American soliders.
We believe freedom of speech under the First
Amendment protects such speech and would
oppose prosecutions of these persons for their
statements. Even if Toguri had sympathized
with the Japanese and had attempted to under
mine American morale, we do not believe her
statements would have constituted treason.
We are hopeful, as is Toguri, that President
Gerald Ford, now freed from political pressures
by his defeat, will grant the pardon expediti
ously. If not, President-elect Jimmy Carter
should begin his administration on a positive
note by righting the government's 30-year-old
wrong against Toguri.
We support the appeal of Iva Toguri — ac
cused of having been "Tokyo Rose" during
World War II — for a presidential pardon from
her 1949 treason conviction.
Toguri, a Nisei who found herself stranded in
Japan after Pearl Harbor, took a job in 1943 with
Radio Tokyo, and was selected by Australian,
American and Filipino prisoners of war to be
one of 14 English-speaking broadcasters for
"Zero Hour," a radio show they directed for
American servicemen.
Ironically, the main reason she was unable to
leave Japan in September 1942 when the
Japanese and American governments had
worked out the red tape which kept her from
returning immediately to her home country
was the fact that her parents were interned in
the Gila River, Ariz., relocation camp for
Japanese Americans and were unable to send
her money for the voyage.
Although the Japanese intended the program
as a propaganda effort against the Allies, the
POWs used their control over the material used
to subtly destroy its propaganda value. Accord
ing to the Australian POW leader, Toguri was
selected because she was pro-American and
would not reveal the POW effort to the
Japanese.
Indeed, a Marine Corps intelligence officer
testified at her trial that, as a result of her coop
eration with the POW sabotage effort, the resul
tant broadcasts were "singularly free of prop
aganda." That opinion was echoed by the
U.S. Army occupation forces in Japan after the
war, which did an exhaustive investigation of
Toguri's activities and concluded that she had
committed no treasonous offense in making the
broadcasts. The Justice Department reached a
similar conclusion late in 1946.
In 1948, however, responding to pressure
from headline-grabbing tabloid journalists
such as Cosmopolitan magazine's Harry Brun
didge and jingoists such as Walter Winchell
and Kate Smith, the FBI reopened its investiga
tion. As a result, Toguri was arrested for the
third time, tried and found guilty of treason.
Justice Department documents recently re
leased under the Freedom of Information Act
indicate that the prosecution was aware that
Brundidge had suborned perjury in obtaining

testimony from Japanese citizens flown to the
United States at government expense. Indeed,
two witnesses who presented the most damag
ing evidence of American statements by Toguri
have since admitted that they lied at her trial at
Brundidge's request.
In fact, prosecutor Tom De Wolfe, in a 1948
memo from his Justice Department office, ad
mitted that Toguri was "a trusted and selected
agent of the Allied prisoners of war," that she
frequently expressed pro-American statements
during her Radio Tokyo employment and that
"the Government case must fail as a matter of
law because Government witnesses will dis
close that subject (Toguri) did not adhere to the
enemy or possess the requisite disloyal state of
mind."
