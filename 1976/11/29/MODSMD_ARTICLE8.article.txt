# Ruetz's acts disturbing
## 
### 
The recent firing of football coach Jack Chris
tiansen with two years remaining on his five
year contract raises some disturbing questions
about the Athletic Department's handling of
the affair. Obviously Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
now regrets the contract he gave Christiansen
in 1973 with almost no fanfare and apparently
little consultation with the university's Athle
tic Board.
But to break such a contract after three win
ning seasons is an extraordinary step. Ruetz
should account for it with a frank and detailed
statement, not merely the nebulous, evasive
and somewhat curt comments he has issued so
far.
What is most disturbing about Ruetz' silence
is that it reveals nothing about what the Athle
tic Department expects of the football program.
Was Christiansen being punished for perennial
Stanford losses to top eastern and midwestern
teams? For taking teams like Army and San Jose

State too lightly? Must a Stanford coach lead
his team to the Rose Bowl to satisfy his
employers?
The timing of Christiansen's firing has led to
considerable speculation that Christiansen was
sacrified to disgruntled alumni. This is an im
pression which Ruetz can ill afford to foster.
This season Ruetz juggled the schedule to
provide only four home games for a football
team that ought to have been the best here in
several years. By all indications it was strictly a
money-making move. The team opened with
two losses on the road â€” and never really reco
vered.
One player compared taking the field against
top-ranked Michigan in a stadium filled with
101,000 hostile fans to being thrown to the
lions. When alumni with impossibly lofty ex
pectations come to believe that they can dictate
Athletic Department policy, the pressure on
players and coaches can only increase.
