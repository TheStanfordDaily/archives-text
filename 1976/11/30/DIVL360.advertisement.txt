The Humanities Circle, which recently pub
lished the statement "To Strengthen Under
graduate Education" discussing, among others,
the desirability of a Western culture require
ment, will now concentrate on the issue of a
foreign language requirement. To this end, the
Humanities Circle has requested two of its
members, Julius Moravcsik, professor and
former chairman of the department of
Philosophy, and Alphonse Juilland, professor
and chairman of the department of French and
Italian, to prepare statements on the place of
foreign languages in a liberal education and on
the situation of foreign languages at Stanford.

THE PLACE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES
IN A CURRICULUM FOR
LIBERAL EDUCATION
1. The purpose of liberal education
What is the purpose of liberal education?
There is a practical argument to be made for
liberal education — one especially applicable in
our age of rapid changes — which asserts that
the mastery of basic cognitive skills is more use
ful in the solution of tomorrow's problems than
are the "relevant" pursuits of today.
Liberal education, however, should be de
fended beyond the issues and claims of practi
cality. It should be regarded as an end in itself,
which widens our horizons and deepens our
humanity. So conceived, liberal education pre
supposes some structure. The curriculum has to
include an overview of subjects that define those
qualities which are distinctly human, a random
selection of departmental course offerings can
not accomplish this task.
What i§ it that we need to know in order to
have the kind of overview necessary tor a liberal
education? First, we must understand the
methodologies of those rational disciplines
which study empirical phenomena in order to
explain experience in terms of laws and
generalizations. Such sciences study either na
ture (hence, the natural sciences) or human be
havior and social organizations (hence, the so
cial sciences). Secondly, we must come to un
derstand how basic cognitive faculties — logical
reasoning, mathematical calculation, artistic
expression, and the use of language — are
exhibited and how we may recognize their con
stitutive rules. Thirdly, by examining cultural
processes and institutions and by investigating
the structure of the artifacts of the human mind,
we must come to an understanding of human
nature. Several disciplines — anthropology, re
ligion, philosophy, and the study of foreign lan
guages — give us a sense of both the diversity of
mankind and of the common ingredients which
define human nature.
2. Language learning in a liberal education
The study of both one's own language and of
a foreign language plays a central role in this
kind of liberal education. One of the defining
human characteristics is rationality. But the full
potentiality of our rational faculties can be
studied only insofar as the thought-forming pro
cesses are reflected in language. The complex
ity of our thoughts and feelings is manifested in
the variety of grammatical forms which we use to
express ourselves. Thus, the learning of gram
mar is of great importance to the understanding
of human nature and of ourselves as thinking,
feeling beings. It heightens our awareness of the
potentialities of our native language and helps
us to appreciate what it is to master another
language — especially one blessed with a rich
heritage of science, art, and literature. Only
through the study of more than one language
can we gain an appreciation not only of a particu
lar language, but of language in general.
The study of foreign languages helps us ex
perience "the miracle of language," namely that
by producing patterns of sounds and by decod
ing them, we articulate thoughts which are or
ganized into sciences — e.g., mathematics and
physics — as well as convey feelings and de
sires which help determine our happiness. A
liberal education should make us aware of the
more recondite areas of study, as well as the
more routine aspects of everyday existence. By
recognizing the true dimensions of grammatical
complexity in thoughts expressed with ease or
difficulty in different languages, our thinking be
comes more subtle and more refined. The study
of languages accomplishes one of the ideal
aims of a liberal education it reveals those fas
cinating and problematic aspects of everyday
experience which are taken for granted by the
unreflective.
Two popular misconceptions helped to
downgrade the importance of learning lan
guages. One is the notion that individuals can
have "good ideas' even if they lack the means of
expressing them, that language serves merely
as an external wrapping" for out ideas, arid not
as an inherent part of the thought-forming pro
cess. The aforementioned interaction between
thought and language renders the notion of
"language-disembodied ideas" untenable. Be
cause the same thought or idea can be expres
sed in a variety of syntactic ways, it has been
concluded — fallaciously — that ideas may exist
entirely apart from the syntactic patterns which
express them.
The question — Why should I bother with
grammar if I succeed in communicating what I
want?" — expresses another widespread mis
conception Hidden behind this fallacy is the
unstated assumption that syntactic modalities
have nothing to do with the capacity for develop
ing varieties of thought when, in fact, no lan
guage merely expresses a stock of thoughts
independent of any linguistic structure To ap
preciate variety in linguistic expression is to ap
preciate diversity in thinking
The mastery of language should kindle a love
for linguistic structures. This love may be com
pared to the way an artist loves his creations or a
child loves beautiful things But this is not merely
an aesthetic attitude For in valuing language
and grammar we value what we are thinking,
feeling human beings

THE PLACE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES
IN A CURRICULUM FOR
LIBERAL EDUCATION
1. The purpose of liberal education
What is the purpose of liberal education?
There is a practical argument to be made for
liberal education — one especially applicable in
our age of rapid changes — which asserts that
the mastery of basic cognitive skills is more use
ful in the solution of tomorrow's problems than
are the "relevant" pursuits of today.
Liberal education, however, should be de
fended beyond the issues and claims of practi
cality. It should be regarded as an end in itself,
which widens our horizons and deepens our
humanity. So conceived, liberal education pre
supposes some structure. The curriculum has to
include an overview of subjects that define those
qualities which are distinctly human, a random
selection of departmental course offerings can
not accomplish this task.
What i§ it that we need to know in order to
have the kind of overview necessary tor a liberal
education? First, we must understand the
methodologies of those rational disciplines
which study empirical phenomena in order to
explain experience in terms of laws and
generalizations. Such sciences study either na
ture (hence, the natural sciences) or human be
havior and social organizations (hence, the so
cial sciences). Secondly, we must come to un
derstand how basic cognitive faculties — logical
reasoning, mathematical calculation, artistic
expression, and the use of language — are
exhibited and how we may recognize their con
stitutive rules. Thirdly, by examining cultural
processes and institutions and by investigating
the structure of the artifacts of the human mind,
we must come to an understanding of human
nature. Several disciplines — anthropology, re
ligion, philosophy, and the study of foreign lan
guages — give us a sense of both the diversity of
mankind and of the common ingredients which
define human nature.
2. Language learning in a liberal education
The study of both one's own language and of
a foreign language plays a central role in this
kind of liberal education. One of the defining
human characteristics is rationality. But the full
potentiality of our rational faculties can be
studied only insofar as the thought-forming pro
cesses are reflected in language. The complex
ity of our thoughts and feelings is manifested in
the variety of grammatical forms which we use to
express ourselves. Thus, the learning of gram
mar is of great importance to the understanding
of human nature and of ourselves as thinking,
feeling beings. It heightens our awareness of the
potentialities of our native language and helps
us to appreciate what it is to master another
language — especially one blessed with a rich
heritage of science, art, and literature. Only
through the study of more than one language
can we gain an appreciation not only of a particu
lar language, but of language in general.
The study of foreign languages helps us ex
perience "the miracle of language," namely that
by producing patterns of sounds and by decod
ing them, we articulate thoughts which are or
ganized into sciences — e.g., mathematics and
physics — as well as convey feelings and de
sires which help determine our happiness. A
liberal education should make us aware of the
more recondite areas of study, as well as the
more routine aspects of everyday existence. By
recognizing the true dimensions of grammatical
complexity in thoughts expressed with ease or
difficulty in different languages, our thinking be
comes more subtle and more refined. The study
of languages accomplishes one of the ideal
aims of a liberal education it reveals those fas
cinating and problematic aspects of everyday
experience which are taken for granted by the
unreflective.
Two popular misconceptions helped to
downgrade the importance of learning lan
guages. One is the notion that individuals can
have "good ideas' even if they lack the means of
expressing them, that language serves merely
as an external wrapping" for out ideas, arid not
as an inherent part of the thought-forming pro
cess. The aforementioned interaction between
thought and language renders the notion of
"language-disembodied ideas" untenable. Be
cause the same thought or idea can be expres
sed in a variety of syntactic ways, it has been
concluded — fallaciously — that ideas may exist
entirely apart from the syntactic patterns which
express them.
The question — Why should I bother with
grammar if I succeed in communicating what I
want?" — expresses another widespread mis
conception Hidden behind this fallacy is the
unstated assumption that syntactic modalities
have nothing to do with the capacity for develop
ing varieties of thought when, in fact, no lan

thought and language renders the notion of

the desirability of a Western culture require

foreign language requirement. To this end, the
Humanities Circle has requested two of its

Italian, to prepare statements on the place of
foreign languages in a liberal education and on

THE PLACE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES
IN A CURRICULUM FOR
LIBERAL EDUCATION
1. The purpose of liberal education
What is the purpose of liberal education?
There is a practical argument to be made for
liberal education — one especially applicable in
our age of rapid changes — which asserts that
the mastery of basic cognitive skills is more use
ful in the solution of tomorrow's problems than
are the "relevant" pursuits of today.
Liberal education, however, should be de
fended beyond the issues and claims of practi
cality. It should be regarded as an end in itself,
which widens our horizons and deepens our
humanity. So conceived, liberal education pre
supposes some structure. The curriculum has to
include an overview of subjects that define those
qualities which are distinctly human, a random
selection of departmental course offerings can
not accomplish this task.
What i§ it that we need to know in order to
have the kind of overview necessary tor a liberal
education? First, we must understand the
methodologies of those rational disciplines
which study empirical phenomena in order to
explain experience in terms of laws and
generalizations. Such sciences study either na
ture (hence, the natural sciences) or human be
havior and social organizations (hence, the so
cial sciences). Secondly, we must come to un
derstand how basic cognitive faculties — logical
reasoning, mathematical calculation, artistic
expression, and the use of language — are
exhibited and how we may recognize their con
stitutive rules. Thirdly, by examining cultural
processes and institutions and by investigating
the structure of the artifacts of the human mind,
we must come to an understanding of human
nature. Several disciplines — anthropology, re
ligion, philosophy, and the study of foreign lan
guages — give us a sense of both the diversity of
mankind and of the common ingredients which
define human nature.
2. Language learning in a liberal education
The study of both one's own language and of
a foreign language plays a central role in this
kind of liberal education. One of the defining
human characteristics is rationality. But the full
potentiality of our rational faculties can be
studied only insofar as the thought-forming pro
cesses are reflected in language. The complex
ity of our thoughts and feelings is manifested in
the variety of grammatical forms which we use to
express ourselves. Thus, the learning of gram
mar is of great importance to the understanding
of human nature and of ourselves as thinking,
feeling beings. It heightens our awareness of the
potentialities of our native language and helps
us to appreciate what it is to master another
language — especially one blessed with a rich
heritage of science, art, and literature. Only
through the study of more than one language
can we gain an appreciation not only of a particu
lar language, but of language in general.
The study of foreign languages helps us ex
perience "the miracle of language," namely that
by producing patterns of sounds and by decod
ing them, we articulate thoughts which are or
ganized into sciences — e.g., mathematics and
physics — as well as convey feelings and de
sires which help determine our happiness. A
liberal education should make us aware of the
more recondite areas of study, as well as the
more routine aspects of everyday existence. By
recognizing the true dimensions of grammatical
complexity in thoughts expressed with ease or
difficulty in different languages, our thinking be
comes more subtle and more refined. The study
of languages accomplishes one of the ideal
aims of a liberal education it reveals those fas
cinating and problematic aspects of everyday
experience which are taken for granted by the
unreflective.
Two popular misconceptions helped to
downgrade the importance of learning lan
guages. One is the notion that individuals can
have "good ideas' even if they lack the means of
expressing them, that language serves merely
as an external wrapping" for out ideas, arid not
as an inherent part of the thought-forming pro
cess. The aforementioned interaction between
thought and language renders the notion of
