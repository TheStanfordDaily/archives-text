and the notion of human freedom are interre
lated. 'Freedom,' like so many abstract terms, is
deceptively simple What is it to have freedom?
What is it to be free? No one can be freesimplici
ter. When someone is free, he or she is free from
certain constraints and free to do certain things.
There is no point in trying to be free from as
many things as possible."Liberated from all
rules, a person is reduced to the lowly state of a
randomly functioning automaton. Since free
dom has to be specified for different beings with
different capacities, the real questions are What
ought human beings be free from? What ought
they be free to do? A simple-minded but correct
answer is that they ought to be free to be them
selves. Yet, it must be specified that to be free to
be oneself is to be free to realize one's distinc
tive potentialities, which include our rational
potentialities.
There is no thinking without rules: it is logic
and grammar that enable men and women to
articulate thoughts. To think that rules restrict
thinking is absurd, for it is precisely rules — of
consistence, coherence, and grammaticality —
that make thinking possible. An analogy with
chess should make this point clear. It would be
ridiculous to complain that the game of chess
has rules, and that these rules restrict our ability
to play the game. For the very possibility of
playing chess rests upon the fact that the play is
defined by the rules, which are the very essence
of the game.
Whoever wants to free himself from all rules
wants to relinquish his humanity, i.e., his ability
to articulate thought and feeling, to achieve
self-awareness, and to recognize others as
ends in themselves. Needless to say, we legiti
mately want to be free from rules which impose
on us insofar as they hinder our ability to share in
activities that define our nature: e.g., rational
dialogue and the development of friendship. Try
ing to free oneself from constraints which limit
dialogue and friendship is not the same as trying
to avoid educational activities — such as the
learning of foreign languages — which depend
upon rules for their existence.
To be free to act in ways which conform to
human nature is to be free to be creative. It is
meaningless to talk about creativity in art, sci
ence, literature, or human relations, without pre
supposing a network of rule-governed activities,
for the composer, the artist, and the speaker of
everyday language become creative by master
ing systems of rules. A creative individual builds
upon pre-existing rules, reapplies these to novel
situations, modifies them and, on occasion, re
places them with other rules.
To discover the nature of those qualities
which can be defined as distinctly human is to
discover our nature, it is to achieve self know
ledge. In modern times it has been suggested
that self knowledge can be achieved directly,
and that introspection was one avenue to direct
self knowledge. But it is clear, by now, that intro
spection gives no significant clues as to the pro
cesses which lead to understanding a sentence,
constructing a proof, or appreciating a work of
art. Another approach has been suggested by
behaviorist psychology, which maintains that
self knowledge can be gained through the study
of overt behavior. But the cognitive skills which
resist introspection will not yield to an analysis
undertaken exclusively in terms of overt be
havior either. The inadequacy of both ap
proaches was clear to Socrates and Plato who
insisted that there can be no "direct self know
ledge." We can know ourselves only insofar as
our distinctive human qualities and capabilities
are reflected in such cognitive activities as the
use of language, the construction of an argu
ment, the completing of a proof, or the formula
tion of an explanation. Furthermore, since these
processes do not lend themselves to direct ob
servation, we can only understand them by
studying the nature of their objects: the structure
of language, of argument, of proof, and of expla
nation.
4. The study of foreign languages and the
understanding of human nature
So far we have argued that the teaching of
foreign languages plays a crucial role in reveal
ing the rules which characterize cognitive
human activities. We shall now examine how the
learning of foreign languages helps us to recog
nize the universal bonds which unite us and to
understand the varieties of human behavior al
lowed within these bonds.
It is important to study the religion, history,
and philosophic reflections of foreign cultures.
But in trying to understand people with different
symbol-systems and different ways of expres
sing themselves, nothing serves to transcend
cultural barriers better than the learning of a
language other than one's own. Reading a liter
ary work or a political essay in a foreign lan
guage enables one to appreciate how diversely
nuances of thought are articulated in different
languages; at the same time, it reveals how
certain basic modes of expression transcend
linguistic barriers. To understand the basic ele
ments of language use, the student must be able
to grasp the foreign language as a rule system
and make it his. No course "in translation," no
investigation of national history, can satisfy this
objective better than the study of the actual lan
guage, which alone reveals the differences re
flected in various systems of communication.
The learning of foreign languages is one of the
few fields of endeavor where the student can
come to appreciate in concreto claims of diver
sity and universality with reference to specific
facts No one can appreciate the phenomenon
of communication fully who is confined within
the limits of his own language, and who, there
fore, cannot explore the possibilities of transla
tion.
5. Foreign languages and the humanities
Important as it is to view 'oreign languages as
a part of the central core of the humanities, the
difficult problem is to arrive at a satisfactory de
finition of the humanities. Any humanistic discip
line has to deal with facts, with the mechanical
as well as the non-mechanical. In this respect,
humanistic disciplines are not different from the
social and natural sciences.

the only ones concerned with the study and

cesses which lead to understanding a sentence,
constructing a proof, or appreciating a work of
art. Another approach has been suggested by
behaviorist psychology, which maintains that
self knowledge can be gained through the study
of overt behavior. But the cognitive skills which
resist introspection will not yield to an analysis
undertaken exclusively in terms of overt be
havior either. The inadequacy of both ap
proaches was clear to Socrates and Plato who
insisted that there can be no "direct self know
ledge." We can know ourselves only insofar as
our distinctive human qualities and capabilities
are reflected in such cognitive activities as the
use of language, the construction of an argu
ment, the completing of a proof, or the formula
tion of an explanation. Furthermore, since these
processes do not lend themselves to direct ob
servation, we can only understand them by
studying the nature of their objects: the structure
of language, of argument, of proof, and of expla
nation.
4. The study of foreign languages and the
understanding of human nature
So far we have argued that the teaching of
foreign languages plays a crucial role in reveal
ing the rules which characterize cognitive
human activities. We shall now examine how the
learning of foreign languages helps us to recog
nize the universal bonds which unite us and to
understand the varieties of human behavior al
lowed within these bonds.
It is important to study the religion, history,
and philosophic reflections of foreign cultures.
But in trying to understand people with different
symbol-systems and different ways of expres
sing themselves, nothing serves to transcend
cultural barriers better than the learning of a
language other than one's own. Reading a liter
ary work or a political essay in a foreign lan
guage enables one to appreciate how diversely
nuances of thought are articulated in different
languages; at the same time, it reveals how
certain basic modes of expression transcend
linguistic barriers. To understand the basic ele
ments of language use, the student must be able
to grasp the foreign language as a rule system
and make it his. No course "in translation," no
investigation of national history, can satisfy this
objective better than the study of the actual lan
guage, which alone reveals the differences re
flected in various systems of communication.
The learning of foreign languages is one of the
few fields of endeavor where the student can
come to appreciate in concreto claims of diver
sity and universality with reference to specific
facts No one can appreciate the phenomenon
of communication fully who is confined within
the limits of his own language, and who, there
fore, cannot explore the possibilities of transla
tion.
5. Foreign languages and the humanities
Important as it is to view 'oreign languages as
a part of the central core of the humanities, the
difficult problem is to arrive at a satisfactory de
finition of the humanities. Any humanistic discip
line has to deal with facts, with the mechanical
as well as the non-mechanical. In this respect,
humanistic disciplines are not different from the
social and natural sciences.
Moreover, the humanistic disciplines are not
the only ones concerned with the study and
and the notion of human freedom are interre
lated. 'Freedom,' like so many abstract terms, is
deceptively simple What is it to have freedom?
What is it to be free? No one can be freesimplici
ter. When someone is free, he or she is free from
certain constraints and free to do certain things.
There is no point in trying to be free from as
many things as possible."Liberated from all
rules, a person is reduced to the lowly state of a
randomly functioning automaton. Since free
dom has to be specified for different beings with
different capacities, the real questions are What
ought human beings be free from? What ought
they be free to do? A simple-minded but correct
answer is that they ought to be free to be them
selves. Yet, it must be specified that to be free to
be oneself is to be free to realize one's distinc
tive potentialities, which include our rational
potentialities.
There is no thinking without rules: it is logic
and grammar that enable men and women to
articulate thoughts. To think that rules restrict
thinking is absurd, for it is precisely rules — of
consistence, coherence, and grammaticality —
that make thinking possible. An analogy with
chess should make this point clear. It would be
ridiculous to complain that the game of chess
has rules, and that these rules restrict our ability
to play the game. For the very possibility of
playing chess rests upon the fact that the play is
defined by the rules, which are the very essence
of the game.
Whoever wants to free himself from all rules
wants to relinquish his humanity, i.e., his ability
to articulate thought and feeling, to achieve
self-awareness, and to recognize others as
ends in themselves. Needless to say, we legiti
mately want to be free from rules which impose
on us insofar as they hinder our ability to share in
activities that define our nature: e.g., rational
dialogue and the development of friendship. Try
ing to free oneself from constraints which limit
dialogue and friendship is not the same as trying
to avoid educational activities — such as the
learning of foreign languages — which depend
upon rules for their existence.
To be free to act in ways which conform to
human nature is to be free to be creative. It is
meaningless to talk about creativity in art, sci
ence, literature, or human relations, without pre
supposing a network of rule-governed activities,
for the composer, the artist, and the speaker of
everyday language become creative by master
ing systems of rules. A creative individual builds
upon pre-existing rules, reapplies these to novel
situations, modifies them and, on occasion, re
places them with other rules.
To discover the nature of those qualities
which can be defined as distinctly human is to
discover our nature, it is to achieve self know
ledge. In modern times it has been suggested
that self knowledge can be achieved directly,
and that introspection was one avenue to direct
self knowledge. But it is clear, by now, that intro
spection gives no significant clues as to the pro
cesses which lead to understanding a sentence,

Moreover, the humanistic disciplines are not
the only ones concerned with the study and
and the notion of human freedom are interre
lated. 'Freedom,' like so many abstract terms, is
deceptively simple What is it to have freedom?
What is it to be free? No one can be freesimplici
ter. When someone is free, he or she is free from
certain constraints and free to do certain things.
There is no point in trying to be free from as
many things as possible."Liberated from all
rules, a person is reduced to the lowly state of a
randomly functioning automaton. Since free
dom has to be specified for different beings with
different capacities, the real questions are What
ought human beings be free from? What ought
they be free to do? A simple-minded but correct
answer is that they ought to be free to be them
selves. Yet, it must be specified that to be free to
be oneself is to be free to realize one's distinc
tive potentialities, which include our rational
potentialities.
There is no thinking without rules: it is logic
and grammar that enable men and women to
articulate thoughts. To think that rules restrict
thinking is absurd, for it is precisely rules — of
consistence, coherence, and grammaticality —
that make thinking possible. An analogy with
chess should make this point clear. It would be
ridiculous to complain that the game of chess
has rules, and that these rules restrict our ability
to play the game. For the very possibility of
playing chess rests upon the fact that the play is
defined by the rules, which are the very essence
of the game.
Whoever wants to free himself from all rules
wants to relinquish his humanity, i.e., his ability
to articulate thought and feeling, to achieve
self-awareness, and to recognize others as
ends in themselves. Needless to say, we legiti
mately want to be free from rules which impose
on us insofar as they hinder our ability to share in
activities that define our nature: e.g., rational
dialogue and the development of friendship. Try
ing to free oneself from constraints which limit
dialogue and friendship is not the same as trying
to avoid educational activities — such as the
learning of foreign languages — which depend
upon rules for their existence.
To be free to act in ways which conform to
human nature is to be free to be creative. It is
meaningless to talk about creativity in art, sci
ence, literature, or human relations, without pre
supposing a network of rule-governed activities,
for the composer, the artist, and the speaker of
everyday language become creative by master
ing systems of rules. A creative individual builds
upon pre-existing rules, reapplies these to novel
situations, modifies them and, on occasion, re
places them with other rules.
To discover the nature of those qualities
which can be defined as distinctly human is to
discover our nature, it is to achieve self know
ledge. In modern times it has been suggested
that self knowledge can be achieved directly,
and that introspection was one avenue to direct
self knowledge. But it is clear, by now, that intro
spection gives no significant clues as to the pro
cesses which lead to understanding a sentence,
constructing a proof, or appreciating a work of
art. Another approach has been suggested by
behaviorist psychology, which maintains that
self knowledge can be gained through the study
of overt behavior. But the cognitive skills which
resist introspection will not yield to an analysis
undertaken exclusively in terms of overt be
havior either. The inadequacy of both ap
proaches was clear to Socrates and Plato who
insisted that there can be no "direct self know
ledge." We can know ourselves only insofar as
our distinctive human qualities and capabilities
are reflected in such cognitive activities as the
use of language, the construction of an argu
ment, the completing of a proof, or the formula
tion of an explanation. Furthermore, since these
processes do not lend themselves to direct ob
servation, we can only understand them by
studying the nature of their objects: the structure
of language, of argument, of proof, and of expla
nation.
4. The study of foreign languages and the
understanding of human nature
So far we have argued that the teaching of
foreign languages plays a crucial role in reveal
ing the rules which characterize cognitive
human activities. We shall now examine how the
learning of foreign languages helps us to recog
nize the universal bonds which unite us and to
understand the varieties of human behavior al
lowed within these bonds.
It is important to study the religion, history,
and philosophic reflections of foreign cultures.
But in trying to understand people with different
symbol-systems and different ways of expres
sing themselves, nothing serves to transcend
cultural barriers better than the learning of a
language other than one's own. Reading a liter
ary work or a political essay in a foreign lan
guage enables one to appreciate how diversely
nuances of thought are articulated in different
languages; at the same time, it reveals how
certain basic modes of expression transcend
linguistic barriers. To understand the basic ele
ments of language use, the student must be able
to grasp the foreign language as a rule system
and make it his. No course "in translation," no
investigation of national history, can satisfy this
objective better than the study of the actual lan
guage, which alone reveals the differences re
flected in various systems of communication.
The learning of foreign languages is one of the
few fields of endeavor where the student can
come to appreciate in concreto claims of diver
sity and universality with reference to specific
facts No one can appreciate the phenomenon
of communication fully who is confined within
the limits of his own language, and who, there
fore, cannot explore the possibilities of transla
tion.
5. Foreign languages and the humanities
Important as it is to view 'oreign languages as
a part of the central core of the humanities, the
difficult problem is to arrive at a satisfactory de
finition of the humanities. Any humanistic discip
line has to deal with facts, with the mechanical
as well as the non-mechanical. In this respect,
humanistic disciplines are not different from the
social and natural sciences.
Moreover, the humanistic disciplines are not
the only ones concerned with the study and
