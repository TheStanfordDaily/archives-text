cultivation of values. Every discipline is based
on rules and laws — which have both descriptive
and normative aspects — and no one discipline,
or kind of discipline, has a monopoly on norms
and values.
What does distinguish the humanities from:
the sciences is the emphasis on self knowledge
based not upon the scientific study of human |
competences but upon the exhibition and illust-1
ration of constitutive rules and practices which
define distinctly human qualities.
Given this definition of the humanities, it is
clear that foreign languages are as humanistic
as art, religion, history, literature, or philosophy.
If basic language or art courses are deemed
"non-humanistic," then so should their counter
parts in history, philosophy, or religion, in which
a certain body of facts and rote ways of checking
information have to be mastered. There is no
history without emphasis on facts, no aesthetics
without detailed knowledge about art, no
genuine literary criticism without a mastery of
the intricacies of language use, and no apprecia
tion of a foreign language or literature without a
thorough command of the fundamentals. There
is no more rational basis for excluding the basic
courses in foreign languages from the
humanities than there is for excluding the basic
courses in art, history, philosophy, religion, or
literature.
All courses involved in the learning of foreign
languages belong to the humanities. As such,
they play a central role, for they impart to the
students a skill without which there can be no
recognition of the pitfalls, as well as the pos

THE PLIGHT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES AT
STANFORD
Several reasons warrant urgent consideration
of the place and function of foreign languages in
Stanford's undergraduate curriculum, since our
present educational philosophy represents an
extreme position which continues to evolve to
ward even greater extremes. It is a philosophy
well illustrated by the fact that Stanford alone
among leading American universities, at the
same time:
a) requires no knowledge of foreign language
for admission;
b) requires no knowledge of foreign language
for graduation;
c) . excludes all first-year foreign language
courses from humanities requirements;
and
d) denies the validity of student performance
on the foreign language departments'
placement tests in granting advance credit
to incoming students.
1. Foreign languages and the humanities
Stanford's official policy of discouraging in
every possible way the learning of foreign lan
guages is the very antithesis of humanism. For
the learning of foreign languages was the sine
qua non of illustrious humanists such as Latini,
Dante, Petrarch, Ficino, More, Erasmus,!
Rabelais, Montaigne, and the mastery of a
foreign language (in this case, Latin) was in fact
the very basis of Universitas. Even if Stanford
takes pride in its rejection of such an "an
' tiquated" tradition, we might at least ask ourse
lves how many prestigious universities expect
nothing from their students in respect to the
learning of languages? To be sure, all foreign
universities of merit and renown assume, on the
part of their entering students, mastery of at
least one foreign language, usually two, and
often several. And even in the United States,
2/3rds of our universities have either an entr
ance or a graduation foreign language require
ment.
2. Foreign languages and transculturalism
But why should we foster the old humanist
tradition of advanced learning practiced in other
countries? For reasons which are, perhaps,
purely political, the U .S. officially agrees with the
consensus of international opinion expressed in
the Helsinki Treaty. The treaty calls on all sig
natories:
"To encourage the study of foreign
languages and civilizations as an im
portant means of increasing communi
cation between peoples, to enable
them to understand better the culture
of each country, as well as to reinforce
international cooperation; to stimulate
toward this end ... the development
and improvement of foreign language
teaching and the diversity of choices in
languages taught at different
levels.. .." (Part IV §4)
This clause, for most nations, states what is
already a fait accompli. Not for the United
States, which obviously cannot enforce such a
policy without the consent and guidance of its
educational authorities.
What are we to do when our own university
sets such an unfortunate example? One
help but notice the striking discrepancy between
our declarations of interest and concern in
foreign cultures and our inability to insure even
i the most basic prerequisite: that Stanford stu
dents should master one foreign language. The
expedient solution, tnen, is one for which we
Americans are already well-known: "Let the
foreigners learn English!"
It is significant that while the total U.S.A. col
lege enrollment increased by 30% from 1968 to
1974 (from 6,928,115 to 9,023,424), modern
foreign language students decreased by 16%
(from 1,073,097 to 897,077). Before language
requirements were eliminated, modern oreign
languages were studied by 15.5% of U.S. col
lege students; by 1974 this group had already
shrunk to 9.9%. As for Stanford, only four prog
rams not specifically oriented toward foreign
languages, literatures, or cultures, require a
foreign language for the B A (Anthropology, Art,
English, History); and not even one single
: foreign language is recommended, let alone re
quired, for a Stanford B A in International Rela
tions or Political Science! There is obviously little
analogy here with mathematics, a well estab
lished requirement in those departments — sci
ences and enoineerinq — where the fundamen-

foreign language students decreased by 16%
(from 1,073,097 to 897,077). Before language
requirements were eliminated, modern oreign
languages were studied by 15.5% of U.S. col

shrunk to 9.9%. As for Stanford, only four prog
rams not specifically oriented toward foreign
languages, literatures, or cultures, require a
foreign language for the B A (Anthropology, Art,
English, History); and not even one single

quired, for a Stanford B A in International Rela

the sciences is the emphasis on self knowledge

clear that foreign languages are as humanistic
as art, religion, history, literature, or philosophy.
If basic language or art courses are deemed
"non-humanistic," then so should their counter
parts in history, philosophy, or religion, in which
a certain body of facts and rote ways of checking
information have to be mastered. There is no
history without emphasis on facts, no aesthetics
without detailed knowledge about art, no
genuine literary criticism without a mastery of
the intricacies of language use, and no apprecia
tion of a foreign language or literature without a
thorough command of the fundamentals. There
is no more rational basis for excluding the basic
courses in foreign languages from the
humanities than there is for excluding the basic
courses in art, history, philosophy, religion, or
literature.
All courses involved in the learning of foreign
languages belong to the humanities. As such,
they play a central role, for they impart to the

THE PLIGHT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES AT
STANFORD
Several reasons warrant urgent consideration
of the place and function of foreign languages in
Stanford's undergraduate curriculum, since our
present educational philosophy represents an
extreme position which continues to evolve to
ward even greater extremes. It is a philosophy
well illustrated by the fact that Stanford alone
among leading American universities, at the
same time:
a) requires no knowledge of foreign language
for admission;
b) requires no knowledge of foreign language
for graduation;
c) . excludes all first-year foreign language
courses from humanities requirements;
and
d) denies the validity of student performance
on the foreign language departments'
placement tests in granting advance credit
to incoming students.
1. Foreign languages and the humanities
Stanford's official policy of discouraging in
every possible way the learning of foreign lan
guages is the very antithesis of humanism. For
the learning of foreign languages was the sine
qua non of illustrious humanists such as Latini,
Dante, Petrarch, Ficino, More, Erasmus,!
Rabelais, Montaigne, and the mastery of a
foreign language (in this case, Latin) was in fact
the very basis of Universitas. Even if Stanford
takes pride in its rejection of such an "an
' tiquated" tradition, we might at least ask ourse
lves how many prestigious universities expect
nothing from their students in respect to the
learning of languages? To be sure, all foreign
universities of merit and renown assume, on the
part of their entering students, mastery of at
least one foreign language, usually two, and
often several. And even in the United States,
2/3rds of our universities have either an entr
ance or a graduation foreign language require
ment.
2. Foreign languages and transculturalism
But why should we foster the old humanist
tradition of advanced learning practiced in other
countries? For reasons which are, perhaps,
purely political, the U .S. officially agrees with the
consensus of international opinion expressed in
the Helsinki Treaty. The treaty calls on all sig
natories:
"To encourage the study of foreign
languages and civilizations as an im
portant means of increasing communi
cation between peoples, to enable
them to understand better the culture
of each country, as well as to reinforce
international cooperation; to stimulate
toward this end ... the development
and improvement of foreign language
teaching and the diversity of choices in
languages taught at different
levels.. .." (Part IV §4)
This clause, for most nations, states what is
already a fait accompli. Not for the United
States, which obviously cannot enforce such a
policy without the consent and guidance of its
educational authorities.
What are we to do when our own university
sets such an unfortunate example? One
help but notice the striking discrepancy between
our declarations of interest and concern in
foreign cultures and our inability to insure even
i the most basic prerequisite: that Stanford stu
dents should master one foreign language. The
expedient solution, tnen, is one for which we
Americans are already well-known: "Let the
foreigners learn English!"

This clause, for most nations, states what is
already a fait accompli. Not for the United
States, which obviously cannot enforce such a
policy without the consent and guidance of its
educational authorities.
What are we to do when our own university
sets such an unfortunate example? One
help but notice the striking discrepancy between
our declarations of interest and concern in
foreign cultures and our inability to insure even
i the most basic prerequisite: that Stanford stu
dents should master one foreign language. The
expedient solution, tnen, is one for which we
Americans are already well-known: "Let the
foreigners learn English!"
It is significant that while the total U.S.A. col
lege enrollment increased by 30% from 1968 to
1974 (from 6,928,115 to 9,023,424), modern
foreign language students decreased by 16%
(from 1,073,097 to 897,077). Before language
requirements were eliminated, modern oreign
languages were studied by 15.5% of U.S. col
lege students; by 1974 this group had already
shrunk to 9.9%. As for Stanford, only four prog
rams not specifically oriented toward foreign
languages, literatures, or cultures, require a
foreign language for the B A (Anthropology, Art,
English, History); and not even one single
: foreign language is recommended, let alone re
quired, for a Stanford B A in International Rela
tions or Political Science! There is obviously little
analogy here with mathematics, a well estab
lished requirement in those departments — sci
ences and enoineerinq — where the fundamen-
cultivation of values. Every discipline is based
on rules and laws — which have both descriptive
and normative aspects — and no one discipline,
or kind of discipline, has a monopoly on norms
and values.
What does distinguish the humanities from:
the sciences is the emphasis on self knowledge
based not upon the scientific study of human |
competences but upon the exhibition and illust-1
ration of constitutive rules and practices which
define distinctly human qualities.
Given this definition of the humanities, it is
clear that foreign languages are as humanistic
as art, religion, history, literature, or philosophy.
If basic language or art courses are deemed
"non-humanistic," then so should their counter
parts in history, philosophy, or religion, in which
a certain body of facts and rote ways of checking
information have to be mastered. There is no
history without emphasis on facts, no aesthetics
without detailed knowledge about art, no
genuine literary criticism without a mastery of
the intricacies of language use, and no apprecia
tion of a foreign language or literature without a
thorough command of the fundamentals. There
is no more rational basis for excluding the basic
courses in foreign languages from the
humanities than there is for excluding the basic
courses in art, history, philosophy, religion, or
literature.
All courses involved in the learning of foreign
languages belong to the humanities. As such,
they play a central role, for they impart to the
students a skill without which there can be no
recognition of the pitfalls, as well as the pos
sibilities of communication.

THE PLIGHT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES AT
STANFORD
Several reasons warrant urgent consideration
of the place and function of foreign languages in
Stanford's undergraduate curriculum, since our
present educational philosophy represents an
extreme position which continues to evolve to
ward even greater extremes. It is a philosophy
well illustrated by the fact that Stanford alone
among leading American universities, at the
same time:
a) requires no knowledge of foreign language
for admission;
b) requires no knowledge of foreign language
for graduation;
c) . excludes all first-year foreign language
courses from humanities requirements;
and
d) denies the validity of student performance
on the foreign language departments'
placement tests in granting advance credit
to incoming students.
1. Foreign languages and the humanities
Stanford's official policy of discouraging in
every possible way the learning of foreign lan
guages is the very antithesis of humanism. For
the learning of foreign languages was the sine
qua non of illustrious humanists such as Latini,
Dante, Petrarch, Ficino, More, Erasmus,!
Rabelais, Montaigne, and the mastery of a
foreign language (in this case, Latin) was in fact
the very basis of Universitas. Even if Stanford
takes pride in its rejection of such an "an
' tiquated" tradition, we might at least ask ourse
lves how many prestigious universities expect
nothing from their students in respect to the
learning of languages? To be sure, all foreign
universities of merit and renown assume, on the
part of their entering students, mastery of at
least one foreign language, usually two, and
often several. And even in the United States,
2/3rds of our universities have either an entr
ance or a graduation foreign language require
ment.
2. Foreign languages and transculturalism
But why should we foster the old humanist
tradition of advanced learning practiced in other
countries? For reasons which are, perhaps,
purely political, the U .S. officially agrees with the
consensus of international opinion expressed in
the Helsinki Treaty. The treaty calls on all sig
natories:
"To encourage the study of foreign
languages and civilizations as an im
portant means of increasing communi
cation between peoples, to enable
them to understand better the culture
of each country, as well as to reinforce
international cooperation; to stimulate
toward this end ... the development
and improvement of foreign language
teaching and the diversity of choices in
languages taught at different
