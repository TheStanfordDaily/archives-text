3. The decline of foreign languages at
Stanford
Such disparity, nationally and internationally,
i finds its parallel in Stanford's incongruous posi
tion of hailing transnationalism through its
: numerous overseas programs while doing its
utmost to discourage Stanford students from
taking even the first transcultural step: acquiring
command of at least one foreign language.
Since the language requirement was dropped
in 1969, campus publications have insisted that
language enrollments have not changed. In
deed, our language departments have partially
succeeded in shoring up sinking enrollments by
offering career-oriented programs, interdiscipli
nary courses, courses in translation, one-skill
service or review courses (conversation, trans-1
lation) etc. However, the undeniable fact is that
enrollment has clearly dropped in courses
which systematically teach the fundamental
material-pronunciation and spelling, morphol
ogy and syntax, vocabulary and composition -
that is, the first 5-quarter 4 or 5-unit language
courses corresponding to the former language
requirement.
Totals included in the appendices of the Re
port of the Committee on the Reform and Re- j
newal of Liberal Education at Stanford (1-5-76)
show complete foreign language enrollment fi
gures only from 1969-70 to 1973-74. The report
claims that "language enrollments have re- ;
mained fairly steady" (p. 14). However, the Se- I
nate on May 8, 1969, had already voted to drop
the language requirement. On October 3, 1969,
the Academic Council, with barely 20% of its
members voting (206), confirmed the earlier
Senate decision by a slim 56% majority (116). In
effect only some 10% of the faculty made the
decision to abrogate the language requirement.
Be that as it may, students and advisors had
long since been aware of the widely dissemi- j
nated SES recommendations of 1968-69. In the
major languages, second-year course enroll-1
ment immediately dropped by 28.6%, and yet i
this conspicuous decline within a single year
(from 1968/69 to 1969/70) has been (inexplica-l
bly) omitted from official university statistics pre
sented to the R. and R. committee.
A more detailed examination reveals the true
scope of the problem. Combined enrollment fi
gures in the three languages with by far the most
significant enrollments — French, Spanish, and
German — testify to a definite decline in the first
five-quarter series since the SES recommenda
tion.
1968-69 (SES) : 2922
1975-76 : 2621
Decrease : 301 (-10.3%)
What these figures do not show is that nearly;
1 /3rd of our students no longer continue beyond
the first year of a foreign language:
1968-69 (SES) : 814
1975-76 : 576
Decrease : 238 (-29.2%)
4. Foreign languages and the distribution
requirement
Language departments could heretofore take
some solace in sustaining interest in the first
year courses, even if students never went on to
achieve acceptable proficiency. Apparently
after recognizing this last stronghold of foreign
language study, the University has now
launched a new attack — in effect beginning this
very quarter — which excludes all first-year lan
guage courses from being considered as part of
the humanities (much less as the traditional
basis for the humanities themselves). The re
sults can now be measured, and they are disas
trous. No less than 30% fewer students are be
ginning foreign language study at Stanford, as
indicated by combined first-quarter enrollments
in the three major languages:
Autumn 1975-76 : 508
Autumn 1976-77 : 355
Decrease : 153 (-30%)
For certain languages, the results border on
the catastrophic: First-year Russian shows a :
one-year decline of more than 40%, German
follows with 38%, and French is not far behind
with 35%. Even Spanish, the other native lan
guage of California, shows an attrition rate of
12%, as compared to the national college level
decline in Spanish of only .07% (1972-1974).!
(For reasons which have to do with the particular
situation of Italian studies at Stanford, Italian is
the only modern language which — with a 14%
increase in enrollment — does not conform to
the general trend.)
These steep and sudden decreases will, of
1 course, result in corresponding losses in the
subsequent quarters of the basic foreign lan
guage series, but we shall have to await another
year to assess the results.
It is curious that the University has decided to
ostracize indiscriminately all beginning foreign
language courses from the humanities, regard
less of the great diversity of objectives and ap
proaches which vary from department to de
partment and from language to language. Stan
ford students of German, for instance, hear
weekly lectures on German civilization and cul
ture given by such distinguished scholars from
throughout the University as Lorenz Eitner, Kurt
Muller-Vollmer, Peter Paret, George Spindler,
Lewis Spitz, or Kurt Steiner on such diverse
topics as the "Great German historians," "The
German youth of Karl Marx," "The films of Leni
Riefenstahl," "East and West German law,"
"German Romantic art," or "What has hap
pened to Martin Luther in German history? ". A
strange situation indeed when such outstanding
colleagues are officially considered to contribute
nothing to our students' understanding of
humanities.

ogy and syntax, vocabulary and composition -
that is, the first 5-quarter 4 or 5-unit language
courses corresponding to the former language
requirement.
Totals included in the appendices of the Re
port of the Committee on the Reform and Re- j
newal of Liberal Education at Stanford (1-5-76)
show complete foreign language enrollment fi
gures only from 1969-70 to 1973-74. The report
claims that "language enrollments have re- ;
mained fairly steady" (p. 14). However, the Se- I
nate on May 8, 1969, had already voted to drop
the language requirement. On October 3, 1969,
the Academic Council, with barely 20% of its
members voting (206), confirmed the earlier
Senate decision by a slim 56% majority (116). In
effect only some 10% of the faculty made the
decision to abrogate the language requirement.
Be that as it may, students and advisors had
long since been aware of the widely dissemi- j
nated SES recommendations of 1968-69. In the
major languages, second-year course enroll-1
ment immediately dropped by 28.6%, and yet i
this conspicuous decline within a single year
(from 1968/69 to 1969/70) has been (inexplica-l
bly) omitted from official university statistics pre
sented to the R. and R. committee.
A more detailed examination reveals the true
scope of the problem. Combined enrollment fi
gures in the three languages with by far the most
significant enrollments — French, Spanish, and
German — testify to a definite decline in the first
five-quarter series since the SES recommenda
tion.
1968-69 (SES) : 2922
1975-76 : 2621
Decrease : 301 (-10.3%)
What these figures do not show is that nearly;
1 /3rd of our students no longer continue beyond
the first year of a foreign language:
1968-69 (SES) : 814
1975-76 : 576
Decrease : 238 (-29.2%)
4. Foreign languages and the distribution
requirement
Language departments could heretofore take
some solace in sustaining interest in the first
year courses, even if students never went on to
achieve acceptable proficiency. Apparently
after recognizing this last stronghold of foreign
language study, the University has now
launched a new attack — in effect beginning this
very quarter — which excludes all first-year lan
guage courses from being considered as part of
the humanities (much less as the traditional
basis for the humanities themselves). The re
sults can now be measured, and they are disas
trous. No less than 30% fewer students are be
ginning foreign language study at Stanford, as
indicated by combined first-quarter enrollments
in the three major languages:
Autumn 1975-76 : 508
Autumn 1976-77 : 355
Decrease : 153 (-30%)
For certain languages, the results border on
the catastrophic: First-year Russian shows a :
one-year decline of more than 40%, German
follows with 38%, and French is not far behind
with 35%. Even Spanish, the other native lan
guage of California, shows an attrition rate of
12%, as compared to the national college level
decline in Spanish of only .07% (1972-1974).!
(For reasons which have to do with the particular
situation of Italian studies at Stanford, Italian is
the only modern language which — with a 14%
increase in enrollment — does not conform to
the general trend.)
These steep and sudden decreases will, of
1 course, result in corresponding losses in the
subsequent quarters of the basic foreign lan
guage series, but we shall have to await another
year to assess the results.
It is curious that the University has decided to
ostracize indiscriminately all beginning foreign
language courses from the humanities, regard
less of the great diversity of objectives and ap
proaches which vary from department to de
partment and from language to language. Stan
ford students of German, for instance, hear
weekly lectures on German civilization and cul
ture given by such distinguished scholars from
throughout the University as Lorenz Eitner, Kurt
Muller-Vollmer, Peter Paret, George Spindler,
Lewis Spitz, or Kurt Steiner on such diverse
topics as the "Great German historians," "The
German youth of Karl Marx," "The films of Leni
Riefenstahl," "East and West German law,"
"German Romantic art," or "What has hap
pened to Martin Luther in German history? ". A
strange situation indeed when such outstanding
colleagues are officially considered to contribute
nothing to our students' understanding of

Such disparity, nationally and internationally,
i finds its parallel in Stanford's incongruous posi

command of at least one foreign language.
Since the language requirement was dropped
in 1969, campus publications have insisted that
language enrollments have not changed. In
deed, our language departments have partially
succeeded in shoring up sinking enrollments by
offering career-oriented programs, interdiscipli
nary courses, courses in translation, one-skill
service or review courses (conversation, trans-1
lation) etc. However, the undeniable fact is that
enrollment has clearly dropped in courses

effect only some 10% of the faculty made the
decision to abrogate the language requirement.
Be that as it may, students and advisors had
long since been aware of the widely dissemi- j
nated SES recommendations of 1968-69. In the
major languages, second-year course enroll-1
ment immediately dropped by 28.6%, and yet i
this conspicuous decline within a single year
(from 1968/69 to 1969/70) has been (inexplica-l
bly) omitted from official university statistics pre
sented to the R. and R. committee.
A more detailed examination reveals the true
scope of the problem. Combined enrollment fi
gures in the three languages with by far the most
significant enrollments — French, Spanish, and
German — testify to a definite decline in the first
five-quarter series since the SES recommenda
tion.
1968-69 (SES) : 2922
1975-76 : 2621
Decrease : 301 (-10.3%)
What these figures do not show is that nearly;
1 /3rd of our students no longer continue beyond
the first year of a foreign language:
1968-69 (SES) : 814
1975-76 : 576
Decrease : 238 (-29.2%)
4. Foreign languages and the distribution
requirement
Language departments could heretofore take
some solace in sustaining interest in the first
year courses, even if students never went on to
achieve acceptable proficiency. Apparently
after recognizing this last stronghold of foreign
language study, the University has now
launched a new attack — in effect beginning this
very quarter — which excludes all first-year lan
guage courses from being considered as part of
the humanities (much less as the traditional
basis for the humanities themselves). The re
sults can now be measured, and they are disas
trous. No less than 30% fewer students are be
ginning foreign language study at Stanford, as
indicated by combined first-quarter enrollments
in the three major languages:
Autumn 1975-76 : 508
Autumn 1976-77 : 355
Decrease : 153 (-30%)
For certain languages, the results border on
the catastrophic: First-year Russian shows a :
one-year decline of more than 40%, German
follows with 38%, and French is not far behind
with 35%. Even Spanish, the other native lan
guage of California, shows an attrition rate of
12%, as compared to the national college level
decline in Spanish of only .07% (1972-1974).!
(For reasons which have to do with the particular
situation of Italian studies at Stanford, Italian is
the only modern language which — with a 14%
increase in enrollment — does not conform to
the general trend.)
These steep and sudden decreases will, of
1 course, result in corresponding losses in the
subsequent quarters of the basic foreign lan
guage series, but we shall have to await another
year to assess the results.
It is curious that the University has decided to
ostracize indiscriminately all beginning foreign
language courses from the humanities, regard
less of the great diversity of objectives and ap
proaches which vary from department to de
partment and from language to language. Stan
ford students of German, for instance, hear
weekly lectures on German civilization and cul
ture given by such distinguished scholars from
throughout the University as Lorenz Eitner, Kurt
Muller-Vollmer, Peter Paret, George Spindler,
Lewis Spitz, or Kurt Steiner on such diverse
topics as the "Great German historians," "The
German youth of Karl Marx," "The films of Leni
Riefenstahl," "East and West German law,"
"German Romantic art," or "What has hap
pened to Martin Luther in German history? ". A
strange situation indeed when such outstanding
colleagues are officially considered to contribute
nothing to our students' understanding of
humanities.

foreign languages in high schools

foreign language study by Stanford and other
universities has played a decisive role in reduc

the United States is evident While total public
secondary enrollment has increased by millions,
foreign language enrollment has decreased by

3. The decline of foreign languages at
Stanford
Such disparity, nationally and internationally,
i finds its parallel in Stanford's incongruous posi
tion of hailing transnationalism through its
: numerous overseas programs while doing its
utmost to discourage Stanford students from
taking even the first transcultural step: acquiring
command of at least one foreign language.
Since the language requirement was dropped
in 1969, campus publications have insisted that
language enrollments have not changed. In
deed, our language departments have partially
succeeded in shoring up sinking enrollments by
offering career-oriented programs, interdiscipli
nary courses, courses in translation, one-skill
service or review courses (conversation, trans-1
lation) etc. However, the undeniable fact is that
enrollment has clearly dropped in courses
which systematically teach the fundamental
material-pronunciation and spelling, morphol
ogy and syntax, vocabulary and composition -
that is, the first 5-quarter 4 or 5-unit language
courses corresponding to the former language
requirement.
Totals included in the appendices of the Re
port of the Committee on the Reform and Re- j
newal of Liberal Education at Stanford (1-5-76)
show complete foreign language enrollment fi
gures only from 1969-70 to 1973-74. The report
claims that "language enrollments have re- ;
mained fairly steady" (p. 14). However, the Se- I
nate on May 8, 1969, had already voted to drop
the language requirement. On October 3, 1969,
the Academic Council, with barely 20% of its
members voting (206), confirmed the earlier
Senate decision by a slim 56% majority (116). In
