It is not the national government that deter
mines curriculum policies; it is our leading uni
versities. Largely as a result of their negative
influence, there has been a decline of nearly
50% in the number of entering Stanford students
having taken Advance Placement tests in
foreign languages. If universities like ours do not
care for foreign languages, high schools most
certainly will not either. Many of them have dras
tically curtailed their foreign language offerings;
while others — especially in the poorer districts
— simply have given up offering foreign lan
guages. And if any of their students make it to
Stanford and want to start a foreign language,
they soon discover that engaging in the study of
a foreign language is not considered a humanis
tic activity.
6. Advance Credit in foreign languages at
Stanford
On the other hand, a student fortunate
enough to have achieved some foreign lan
guage competence in high school is now denied
advance credit at Stanford unless he or she has
taken the CEEB Advanced Placement Test.
Many high schools simply do not offer APT
courses in foreign languages. Stanford foreign
language departments were formerly able to
compensate for this inequity through their own
placement tests, which often showed certain
students as higher achievers in foreign lan
guage than the officially accredited CEEB APT
student. But beginning this year, Stanford has
disqualified its foreign language departments
from recommending entering students for ad
vance credit. (Senate decision of 4-30-76).
7. English verbal ability and foreign lan
guages
In the meantime, educators and parents
throughout the nation decry the inability of stu
dents to read or write and lament the "functional
illiteracy" of the younger generation. College
test scores indicate an alarming deterioration in
verbal ability over the last few years, and this
deterioration happens to coincide with the abro
gation by so many universities of foreign lan
guage requirements.
Could there be some connection? Given the
deficiencies of high school English, many stu
dents acknowledge that it is the study of a
foreign language which, for the first time, made
them aware of their native language, its pronun
ciation, grammar, vocabulary, style. Is it then
wise to deemphasize the very method which so
effectively helps students grasp the basic con
cepts and categories inherent in their own lan
guage? Is it reasonable to discourage a study
which gives so many students their first insight
into the nature, structure, and mechanism of
language in general, and then expect them to
somehow achieve or maintain high language
skills? Or, at the university level, with what
coherence do we undermine language study
while we expect students to assimilate new
methodologies such as semiotics or struc
turalism, the basic concepts of which are de
rived from the study of language?
8. Foreign language requirements at Stan
ford and elsewhere
There is no clear answer to these questions.
What is clear is that Stanford has settled for the
easy way out of the vital problem of foreign
language study. The very fact that most leading
American institutions of higher learning still in
sist on some foreign language competence for
admission or graduation confirms the uncer
tainty of our present posture.
The YALE distribution requirement includes
both foreign languages and literatures. Indeed,
the Yale "Guidelines" (Yale College Programs
of Study, 1975-76, pp. 17-18) devote more than
a page to the rationale of their foreign language
requirement: "... a student ought to be able to
understand, speak, read, and write a language
other than his own. . . . Mastery of a foreign
language increases subtlety of mind and shar
pens sensitivity to the use and meaning of words
in one's own language. ..." — HARVARD re
quires two years — and preferably four — of
foreign language study for admission alone, and
then again prescribes two more foreign lan
guage courses for Part I of its distribution re
quirement. — CORNELL requires two foreign
languages for admission, or demonstration of
proficiency in one. — PRINCETON requires pro
ficiency in at least one foreign language. — The
University of California at BERKELEY requires
two years of foreign language for admission, or
the university equivalent for students admitted
under exceptional circumstances. — Many of
our large state universities, e.g. MINNESOTA or
TEXAS, require too full years or even two and a
half years of foreign language study for the B. A
degree. The examples are too numerous to list
exhaustively here. Although language require
ments have been generally weakened, on the
i whole, only 1/3 rd of American universities have
neither admission nor graduation foreign lan
guage requirements.
In view of the alarming decline at all levels of
foreign language study everywhere in the coun
try as well as at Stanford, it becomes urgent that
our University consider in what way it might en
j courage its own applicants and students — not
to speak of high-school students looking for gui
dance — to achieve some proficiency in at least
one foreign language. The "strongly recom
mended" phrase now in our catalogue has man
ifestly failed. In looking for alternative solutions,
we ought to face squarely the fact that exhorta
tions contradicted by policy carry no weight.

It is not the national government that deter
mines curriculum policies; it is our leading uni
versities. Largely as a result of their negative
influence, there has been a decline of nearly
50% in the number of entering Stanford students
having taken Advance Placement tests in
foreign languages. If universities like ours do not
care for foreign languages, high schools most
certainly will not either. Many of them have dras
tically curtailed their foreign language offerings;
while others — especially in the poorer districts
— simply have given up offering foreign lan
guages. And if any of their students make it to
Stanford and want to start a foreign language,
they soon discover that engaging in the study of
a foreign language is not considered a humanis
tic activity.
6. Advance Credit in foreign languages at
Stanford
On the other hand, a student fortunate
enough to have achieved some foreign lan
guage competence in high school is now denied
advance credit at Stanford unless he or she has
taken the CEEB Advanced Placement Test.
Many high schools simply do not offer APT
courses in foreign languages. Stanford foreign
language departments were formerly able to
compensate for this inequity through their own
placement tests, which often showed certain
students as higher achievers in foreign lan
guage than the officially accredited CEEB APT
student. But beginning this year, Stanford has
disqualified its foreign language departments
from recommending entering students for ad
vance credit. (Senate decision of 4-30-76).
7. English verbal ability and foreign lan
guages
In the meantime, educators and parents
throughout the nation decry the inability of stu
dents to read or write and lament the "functional
illiteracy" of the younger generation. College
test scores indicate an alarming deterioration in
verbal ability over the last few years, and this
deterioration happens to coincide with the abro
gation by so many universities of foreign lan
guage requirements.
Could there be some connection? Given the
deficiencies of high school English, many stu
dents acknowledge that it is the study of a
foreign language which, for the first time, made
them aware of their native language, its pronun
ciation, grammar, vocabulary, style. Is it then
wise to deemphasize the very method which so
effectively helps students grasp the basic con
cepts and categories inherent in their own lan
guage? Is it reasonable to discourage a study
which gives so many students their first insight
into the nature, structure, and mechanism of
language in general, and then expect them to
somehow achieve or maintain high language
skills? Or, at the university level, with what
coherence do we undermine language study
while we expect students to assimilate new
methodologies such as semiotics or struc
turalism, the basic concepts of which are de
rived from the study of language?
8. Foreign language requirements at Stan
ford and elsewhere
There is no clear answer to these questions.
What is clear is that Stanford has settled for the
easy way out of the vital problem of foreign
language study. The very fact that most leading
American institutions of higher learning still in
sist on some foreign language competence for
admission or graduation confirms the uncer
tainty of our present posture.
The YALE distribution requirement includes
both foreign languages and literatures. Indeed,
the Yale "Guidelines" (Yale College Programs
of Study, 1975-76, pp. 17-18) devote more than
a page to the rationale of their foreign language
requirement: "... a student ought to be able to
understand, speak, read, and write a language
other than his own. . . . Mastery of a foreign
language increases subtlety of mind and shar
pens sensitivity to the use and meaning of words
in one's own language. ..." — HARVARD re
quires two years — and preferably four — of
foreign language study for admission alone, and
then again prescribes two more foreign lan
guage courses for Part I of its distribution re
quirement. — CORNELL requires two foreign
languages for admission, or demonstration of
proficiency in one. — PRINCETON requires pro
ficiency in at least one foreign language. — The
University of California at BERKELEY requires
two years of foreign language for admission, or
the university equivalent for students admitted
under exceptional circumstances. — Many of
our large state universities, e.g. MINNESOTA or
TEXAS, require too full years or even two and a
half years of foreign language study for the B. A
degree. The examples are too numerous to list
exhaustively here. Although language require
ments have been generally weakened, on the
i whole, only 1/3 rd of American universities have
neither admission nor graduation foreign lan
guage requirements.
In view of the alarming decline at all levels of
foreign language study everywhere in the coun
try as well as at Stanford, it becomes urgent that
our University consider in what way it might en
j courage its own applicants and students — not
to speak of high-school students looking for gui

one foreign language. The "strongly recom
mended" phrase now in our catalogue has man

ficiency in at least one foreign language. — The
University of California at BERKELEY requires
two years of foreign language for admission, or
the university equivalent for students admitted
under exceptional circumstances. — Many of
our large state universities, e.g. MINNESOTA or
TEXAS, require too full years or even two and a
half years of foreign language study for the B. A
degree. The examples are too numerous to list
exhaustively here. Although language require
ments have been generally weakened, on the
i whole, only 1/3 rd of American universities have
neither admission nor graduation foreign lan
guage requirements.
In view of the alarming decline at all levels of
foreign language study everywhere in the coun
try as well as at Stanford, it becomes urgent that
our University consider in what way it might en
j courage its own applicants and students — not
to speak of high-school students looking for gui
dance — to achieve some proficiency in at least
one foreign language. The "strongly recom
mended" phrase now in our catalogue has man
ifestly failed. In looking for alternative solutions,
we ought to face squarely the fact that exhorta
tions contradicted by policy carry no weight.

It is not the national government that deter
mines curriculum policies; it is our leading uni
versities. Largely as a result of their negative
influence, there has been a decline of nearly
50% in the number of entering Stanford students
having taken Advance Placement tests in
foreign languages. If universities like ours do not
care for foreign languages, high schools most
certainly will not either. Many of them have dras
tically curtailed their foreign language offerings;
while others — especially in the poorer districts
— simply have given up offering foreign lan
guages. And if any of their students make it to
Stanford and want to start a foreign language,
they soon discover that engaging in the study of
a foreign language is not considered a humanis
tic activity.
6. Advance Credit in foreign languages at
Stanford
On the other hand, a student fortunate
enough to have achieved some foreign lan
guage competence in high school is now denied
advance credit at Stanford unless he or she has
taken the CEEB Advanced Placement Test.
Many high schools simply do not offer APT
courses in foreign languages. Stanford foreign
language departments were formerly able to
compensate for this inequity through their own
placement tests, which often showed certain
students as higher achievers in foreign lan
guage than the officially accredited CEEB APT
student. But beginning this year, Stanford has
disqualified its foreign language departments
from recommending entering students for ad
vance credit. (Senate decision of 4-30-76).
7. English verbal ability and foreign lan
guages
In the meantime, educators and parents
throughout the nation decry the inability of stu
dents to read or write and lament the "functional
illiteracy" of the younger generation. College
test scores indicate an alarming deterioration in
verbal ability over the last few years, and this
deterioration happens to coincide with the abro
gation by so many universities of foreign lan
guage requirements.
Could there be some connection? Given the
deficiencies of high school English, many stu
dents acknowledge that it is the study of a
foreign language which, for the first time, made
them aware of their native language, its pronun
ciation, grammar, vocabulary, style. Is it then
wise to deemphasize the very method which so
effectively helps students grasp the basic con
cepts and categories inherent in their own lan
guage? Is it reasonable to discourage a study
which gives so many students their first insight
into the nature, structure, and mechanism of
language in general, and then expect them to
somehow achieve or maintain high language
skills? Or, at the university level, with what
coherence do we undermine language study
while we expect students to assimilate new
methodologies such as semiotics or struc
turalism, the basic concepts of which are de
rived from the study of language?
8. Foreign language requirements at Stan
ford and elsewhere
There is no clear answer to these questions.
What is clear is that Stanford has settled for the
easy way out of the vital problem of foreign
language study. The very fact that most leading
American institutions of higher learning still in
sist on some foreign language competence for
admission or graduation confirms the uncer
tainty of our present posture.
The YALE distribution requirement includes
both foreign languages and literatures. Indeed,
the Yale "Guidelines" (Yale College Programs
of Study, 1975-76, pp. 17-18) devote more than
a page to the rationale of their foreign language
requirement: "... a student ought to be able to
understand, speak, read, and write a language
other than his own. . . . Mastery of a foreign
language increases subtlety of mind and shar
pens sensitivity to the use and meaning of words
in one's own language. ..." — HARVARD re
quires two years — and preferably four — of
foreign language study for admission alone, and
then again prescribes two more foreign lan
guage courses for Part I of its distribution re
quirement. — CORNELL requires two foreign
languages for admission, or demonstration of
proficiency in one. — PRINCETON requires pro
ficiency in at least one foreign language. — The
University of California at BERKELEY requires
two years of foreign language for admission, or
the university equivalent for students admitted
