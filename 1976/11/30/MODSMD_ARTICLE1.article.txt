# Lyman says tuition will not rise by 12%
## 
### Mike Charlson Staff writer 
Tuition will not rise next year by the
12 per cent predicted earlier, accord
ing to university Pres. Richard Lyman.
He made his remarks last night at an
informal gathering at Mirlo Lounge of
Florence Moore Hall which hosted the
KZSU Campus Conference broadcast.
A report submitted to the Board of
Trustees last October by Provost Wil
liam Miller and Vice Provost William
Massy had predicted an annual tuition
hike of 12.2 per cent through 1 ( J80.

However, said Lyman, "(Twelve per
cent) is on the high side." He would
not release an actual figure. The ad
ministration will present a figure,
which has been agreed upon, to the
Hoard of Trustees later this month, he
said.
"(Tuition) is a terrible problem for
us," he said. "It is one which we're
spending a lot of sweat and blood and
tears over."
"We're stuck between charging a
price so high that it discourages
people from coming here on one hand

and charging a more modest price for a
much more modest offering on the
other hand," the president said.
He claimed that the difference in tui
tion costs lie mainly in the fact that
Stanford receives no government sup
port.
Still attracting students
He added, however, that university
studies indicate that theexorbitant tui
tion here has not deterred qualified
applicants from applying and attend
ing the institution to any significant
degree.
"There are very few pieces of hard
evidence which would suggest that we
are pricing ourselves out of the mar
ket," Lyman said. "What keeps us
edgy and noncomplacent is the reali
zation that by the time the evidence is
strong (that we are pricing ourselves
out of the market), it may be too late (to
correct the problem)."
In other matters, Lyman commented
extensively on student participation in
university decision making processes.
He said that the degree of student
input varies with the decision to be
made and that he is sometimes not
satisfied with the amount of student
input.
At the same time, however, Lyman
said he felt that "students greatly un
derestimate their influence." Lyman
said that through such channels as the
Daily, students greatly affect not only
the decisions made, but which deci
sions should he considered in the first
place.
Committees
Beyond that, he said students have
members on nearly every standing
committee of the Board of Trustees.
"The committees do most of the work
of the board," Lyman explained. "I
can't remember an occasion in which

the board . . . has reversed or signific
antly amended a decision recom
mended by one of its committees."
The president, however, reaffirmed
his opposition to a student member on
the board. "Students do participate.
(But) there are neither students nor fa
culty members on the board itself," he
said. According to Lyman, "The pur
pose of a lay board is not to run the
place but to protect the essential
character of the place. It's a conserving
function, if you like, rather than an
initiating function."

students "underestimate their influence" in administrative decisions, say

open hearings.
Tuition will not rise next year by the
12 per cent predicted earlier, accord
ing to university Pres. Richard Lyman.
He made his remarks last night at an
informal gathering at Mirlo Lounge of
Florence Moore Hall which hosted the
KZSU Campus Conference broadcast.
A report submitted to the Board of
Trustees last October by Provost Wil
liam Miller and Vice Provost William
Massy had predicted an annual tuition
hike of 12.2 per cent through 1 ( J80.

However, said Lyman, "(Twelve per
cent) is on the high side." He would
not release an actual figure. The ad
ministration will present a figure,
which has been agreed upon, to the
Hoard of Trustees later this month, he
said.
"(Tuition) is a terrible problem for
us," he said. "It is one which we're
spending a lot of sweat and blood and
tears over."
"We're stuck between charging a
price so high that it discourages
people from coming here on one hand

and charging a more modest price for a
much more modest offering on the
other hand," the president said.
He claimed that the difference in tui
tion costs lie mainly in the fact that
Stanford receives no government sup
port.
Still attracting students
He added, however, that university
studies indicate that theexorbitant tui
tion here has not deterred qualified
applicants from applying and attend
ing the institution to any significant
degree.
"There are very few pieces of hard
evidence which would suggest that we
are pricing ourselves out of the mar
ket," Lyman said. "What keeps us
edgy and noncomplacent is the reali
zation that by the time the evidence is
strong (that we are pricing ourselves
out of the market), it may be too late (to
correct the problem)."
In other matters, Lyman commented
extensively on student participation in
university decision making processes.
He said that the degree of student
input varies with the decision to be
made and that he is sometimes not
satisfied with the amount of student
input.
At the same time, however, Lyman
said he felt that "students greatly un
derestimate their influence." Lyman
said that through such channels as the
Daily, students greatly affect not only
the decisions made, but which deci
sions should he considered in the first
place.
Committees
Beyond that, he said students have
members on nearly every standing
committee of the Board of Trustees.
"The committees do most of the work
of the board," Lyman explained. "I
can't remember an occasion in which

the board . . . has reversed or signific
antly amended a decision recom
mended by one of its committees."
The president, however, reaffirmed
his opposition to a student member on
the board. "Students do participate.
(But) there are neither students nor fa
culty members on the board itself," he
said. According to Lyman, "The pur
pose of a lay board is not to run the
place but to protect the essential
character of the place. It's a conserving
function, if you like, rather than an
initiating function."


Lyman speaks at Mirlo
During last night's KZSU Campus Conference, President Lyman called a
12 per cent tuition hike "on the high side." He reevaluated the university's
financial situation, last summarized in October 1975 when a 12.2 per cent

students "underestimate their influence" in administrative decisions, say
