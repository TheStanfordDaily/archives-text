# Western Civ deserves consideration
## 
### 
The debate whether to institute
stricter standards for undergraduate
education, a seemingly perennial
issue here, has once again come to the
fore with the publication two weeks
ago of the essay "To Strengthen Un
dergraduate Education."
Authored by a group of 12
humanities professors, this essay ar
gues that Western Civilization and
foreign language classes should be re
quired for graduation. Consistent with
past form, the Daily responded to the
professors' essay with a truly mindless
editorial, carefully sidestepping the
essence of the professors' arguments to
concentrate on name-calling and
trivialities.
A rigorous scrutiny of the profes
sors' case will reveal the merit in many
of their arguments; although grounds
for objection are present, the quintes
sence of their essay is quite valid. +
The primary reason such mandatory
classes are advocated is to provide all

students with an underlying basis of
thought. It is argued that without a
knowledge of the predominant strains
of thought and argumentation in the
Western civilization, a student lacks
the ability to make informed decisions
about what he plans to do with his life.
The intent of the humanities group
is not to railroad students into courses
student do not wish to take; rather, the

professors are concerned lest students
lack a solid foundation of knowledge
on which to build their area of spe
cialty.
And, indeed, if students could prove
they have a solid grasp of the issues
and methodology of Western thought
(possibly by taking a test over the
material) it would make sense to
exempt these students from the re
quired courses.
The second reason put forth for im
plementation of new course require
ments is that, if being a college
graduate (and possessing a Stanford
degree, in particular) is to have any
meaning, graduates must have in
common basic knowledge. That is, one
should be able to assume that a college
graduate possesses at least a certain
rudimentary body of knowledge.
Shared reservoir
Furthermore, unless students have a
shared reservoir of knowledge, com
munication will be difficult if not im
possible. According to Time, Henry
Rosovsky, dean of the faculty of arts
and sciences at Harvard, voiced this
concern in his recent report to the Har
vard faculty: "the world has become a
Tower of Babel in which we have lost
the possibility of common discourse
and shared values."
And Rosovsky advocates institution
of a program very similar to that prom
oted by the humanities circle.
That college graduates should have
a shared body of learning is already
tacitly acknowledged by the universi
ty's major system. Here, students are
required to take certain courses (in ad
dition to elective courses) to qualify for
a major in a subject.
Just as one should have a basic un
derstanding of his major subject, one
should have a basic understanding of
Western thought if he is to be consi
dered a college graduate.
Not so clear
Assuming that one agrees with the
above arguments, it is not so clear
which courses all students should be
required to take. The humanities circle
argues for Western Civilization and
language requirements as a bare
minimum.
I disagree.
A Western Civilization requirement
can be justified by the above rationale;
a language requirement cannot. For
why is it necessary that all students
have command of a foreign language?
If the purpose behind studying a
language is to learn of another's cul
ture, why not merely offer courses
concentrating on that culture?
Second, some have argued that
through a study of foreign languages,
one gains a greater insight into English
and the nature of language in general.
As trueas theabove proposition may
be. it would make more sense to study
English or semantics rather than take a
foreign language. Learning English by
studying Italian is a backward
method of going about the task.

And while one might make a good
case for requiring students to take En
glish or semantics, it is difficult to en
visage the necessity of studying other
cultures.
The principal objection to initiating
stricter course requirements is that
such a plan would transform Stanford
into a mythical "St. John's College."
Evidently, opponents of stricter
courses feel Stanford would be trans
mogrified into a Catholic parochial
school.
And they point out that the old
Western Civilization course, aban
doned in the late '60s, was poorly
taught and geared toward the lowest
common denominator in each class.
But these conditions need not ob
tain. Stanford certainly has professors
available with expertise in the history
of Western thought; there is no reason
outstanding professors could not teach
the courses.
Second, Western Civilization could
be geared toward a minimum stan
dard.
Students could be required to pass a
standardized test as evidence they
know the material. And the class could
be graded on a mandatory pass/fail
basis.
No longer demeaning
Such a scheme would dispatch the
Daily's criticism that required courses
in Western thought would not prom
ote an atmosphere in which students
help each other learn. If an absolute
pass/fail standard were implemented,
students would no longer have to de
mean themselves by chasing after the
grades needed to receive admittance to

the graduate school of their dreams.
And as radical learning theorist John
Holt has pointed out, scrounging for
grades and other bagatelles (like Phi
Beta Kappa pins) deters the student
from the true task of his education: to
obtain a knowledge of the world and
himself in an effort to make his life
meaningful.
Another objection to mandatory
classes is that they deny students free
choices. However, if students accepted
to Stanford are fully aware of what will
be required of them, how would they
lack a free choice?
And whoever disagreed with Stan
ford's educational policies could sim
ply attend some other university.
Attracting the top
But would Stanford still attract top
students? Although no hard figures
are available, all evidence seems to in
dicate it would.
The decision to dump the prior
Western Civilization course appears to
have been precipitated by a small
handful of radical students attempting
to as&gjt their dominance over the op
eration of the university. It is not evi
dent that students en masse opposed
the requirement.
The humanities professors' proposal
has merit and should be given careful
consideration by all concerned. At the
least, it deserves a reasoned argument
as to why it should not be im
plemented â€” something the Daily
editorial board adamantly refused to
give it.
