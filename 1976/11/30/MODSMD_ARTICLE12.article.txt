# On liberal education at Stanford

In the current debate about a prop-
J osed requirement for courses in West
! ern civilization, the crucial questions
' may be neglected because of excessive
) concern with one aspect of the prob
! lem: whether there should be more re
j quirements for undergraduates at
j Stanford.
There is a tendency to focus on the
; issue of constraint itself, and whether
• it is a good thing or a bad thing to put
. limits on choice. But this is a question
j that has little meaning in isolation; it
j can only be judged in particular situa
i tions when we know what the con
! straints are designed to accomplish,
j how well they are likely to serve their
i supposed purposes, and what costs are
! involved in imposing them.
It is odd that the question of intro
| ducing slightly more structure into
i undergraduate education should raise
so many hackles, since education as a
whole is based upon the notion that
there are some things which are more
worth learning than others, and that
what is worth learning in any situation
depends on what one wants to be edu
cated for.
Most of us consider that the con
straints on freedom involved in teach
ing someone to read are justified, and
we feel the same say about require
ments in almost every branch of educa
! tion.
It is not only grade- or high
j schoolers for whom some form of
structure is judged to be appropriate;
r graduate and professional training is
i' highly structured, since in these cases
s'it is comparatively clear what one
needs to know in order to practice cer
• tain skills effectively.
Why, therefore, is undergraduate
education supposed to be an exception
to this rule? There are a number of
good and familiar reasons why under
graduates should have more choice
about what they will study than per
sons at other levels of education, and it
is not my purpose to deny this.
But does this mean that there should
be virtually full choice? Or are there
not equally good reasons for suppos
ing that no person is entitled to call
him or herself liberally educated un
less certain conditions have been satis
fied?
We should be well aware that our
great range of freedom in choosing
how we wish to be educated is a novel
development in history, and make sure
that we have not gone so far in this
direction that students lack enough in
formation to make well-founded
choices about what they want to know.
If we could be sure that a certain
threshold of acquaintance with vari
ous aspects of nature, culture and soci
ety was essential before anyone could
claim to be educated and to have the

basis upon which to continue to be
educated in ways of his/her own
choosing, then surely the constraints
would be not only justified but impera
tive for anyone who was seriously of
fering an education.
If we could be sure — there, of
course, is the nub of the difficulty. And
this, I would argue, is what we ought to
be talking about; this is the vexed ques
tion we must try to answer.
What we ought to be talking about is
not the impending doom of Western
culture, but whether Stanford
graduates are being given the informa
tion and opportunities for critical de
velopment they must have if they are
to become functioning, much less
creative, participants in that culture.
The central issue is whether or not
Stanford students are really receiving
— from their professors, their libraries,
their laboratories and one another —
something we are willing to call a lib
eral education. The Daily editorial of
(Nov. 24) was quite right to refer to this
connection to the commitment of time
and money involved in being students
and to suggest that this commitment
entitles them to "a considerable range
of choice."
But surely it entitles them not only
to choice, but also to an education
which is worth their time and money,
and no one has yet shown (to my satis
faction, at least) that this is best en
sured by stressing choice at the ex
pense of everything else.
When we attempt to talk about the
substance of this issue, the formidable
obstacle that confronts us is the bewil
dering proliferation of things which
we, in some sense, ought to know.
Since nobody can any longer pretend
to know much about most of these
things, and yet there are good reasons
why all of them are worth knowing, it
is tempting to give up and assert that
no defensible decisions can be made
about priorities in knowledge.
But those of us who regularly read
papers in which a student is obviously
groping to say something worth say
ing, but lacks the linguistic and ar
gumentative skills needed to say it
clearly, as well as the acquaintance
with those central models or images
developed by thinkers of the past that
would stimulate him or her to say it
more creatively, can surely not be
wholly satisfied with this situation.
In liberal education, some things are
more basic than others, and we are not
now assuring that those basics are
familiar to Stanford graduates.
It is all very well to say, as we do,
that teachers are better off teaching
what they want to teach and students
learning what they want to learn. But
however rewarding it may be to teach
what we like, we also have some re

sponsibility to think about what stu
dents really need to know. It should
not be beyond our wits and abilities as
a group of scholars to devise ways to
ensure that every student has some ex
perience with at least a few of the old
fashioned "hard" disciplines that still
form the foundations of knowledge.
And the effort on the part of those of
us in these and other disciplines to
construct courses drawing on several
disciplines which will acquaint stu
dents with these foundations may well
prove fruitful even if we do not arrive
at results that are perfectly satisfactory
to everyone.
It would be unrealistic, of course, to
expect all of us at Stanford to expend
collective effort in this task. Professors

and students here are generally en
gaged in laboring, indefatigably or
otherwise, to discover a great variety of
things besides the best way to educate
undergraduates.
But surely some of us could give sus
tained attention to the task. And in
order to make it worth the while of the
few who seriously embark upon it,
there must be some assurance that the
courses and procedures they advise to
serve this purpose will be greeted
sympathetically at Stanford.
This is why a ma ndate of some sort is
needed from the Senate of the
Academic Council, and I hope that it
will be provided.
