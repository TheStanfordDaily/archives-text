The Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist
Chinese government on Taiwan has
again stepped up repression to silence
critics of the regime. During the sum
mer, at least 18 political dissidents
were secretly rounded up in Taiwan.
Among them was Chen Ming
chung, a proprieter of a Chinese
medicinal factory in Taipei, who was
sentenced to death by firing squad on
Nov. 10 (Amnesty International,
Osaka, Japan, Nov. 17).
These people known to have been
arrested are just a fraction of those yet
unknown who were secretly arrested
by the KMT in July and August of this
year (Fur Eastern Economic Review,
Aug. 6 and Oct. 15).
The recent arrests deserve attention
in that they were spread over a period
of time and were conducted under ex
treme secrecy. This calculated move
by the Taiwan government was aimed
at minimizing public indignation both
in Taiwan and abroad. If it were not for
information delivered to Amnesty In
ternational by a relative of one of the
arrested who fled Taiwan, news of
those 18 would not have leaked out.
Emergency decree
Like all previous political arrests,
the recent arrests were carried out
under the Emergency Decree (Martial
Law) proclaimed in 1947. The Taiwan
regime has maintained as official pol
icy that as long as the "communist re
bellion" exists on the mainland, the
people of Taiwan will have no rights to

demonstrate, strike, hold gatherings in
public places, or voice dissenting
views on the government.
According to Amnesty Interna-'
tional, the regime "has consistently
violated human rights " (Washington
Post, Nov.l).This places Taiwan in the
political repression "club" of South
Korea, Phillipines, Iran and Chile.
Lately, the KMT regime has resorted
to more and more repressive measures
to keep tight control over Taiwan's 16
million people. Public reaction from
abroad however, has been strong.
In response to the latest arrests,
committees to save political prisoners
in Taiwan have sprung up all over the
United States. Numerous organiza
tions and concerned individuals have
sent telegrams to- President Chiang
Ching-kuo demanding that the execu
tion of Chen be stopped immediately
and all political prisoners be released.
Demonstrations
At the same time, demonstrations
against violation of human rights have
taken place in Chicago, Honolulu and
Boston and more are planned in San
Francisco and New York.
Last Saturday, a full page ad ap
peared in the New York Times protest
ing the secret arrests. Names of more
than 20 Stanford professors were
among the endorsements. In the mean
time, Senator Hubert Humphrey ID-
Minn.) has agreed to take up the issue
and find out more information.
With all these actions taken by the

general public up to this point in time,
it is probably no coincidence that the
Taiwan government retried Chen and
reduced his sentence to 15 years on
Nov. 26. Of the other 17 known, five
were given long jail sentences of 8 to
10 years each, six were to be retried
and the rest released (Amnesty Inter
national, San Francisco, Nov. 26). No
doubt public pressure has been effec
tive in protecting human rights in
Taiwan.
Temporary retreat
This "retreat" by the Taiwan gov
ernment, however, is tactical and at
best, temporary. The situation remains
that some people are still going to be
secretly retried in military court while
others will serve long sentences under
convictions unknown to the public.
This recent "episode" is only the tip of
an iceberg exposed to the public.
Further waves of political repression
should be expected.
A demonstration against these in
humane practices will be held on Dec.
4 at 10:30 a.m. in Portsmouth Square
Park in Chinatown, San Francisco.
Demands will be made to the Taiwan
government through its consulate here
to stop political persecution through
secret arrests, trial by military court
and execution.
Show your support for human
rights! Demonstfate!
