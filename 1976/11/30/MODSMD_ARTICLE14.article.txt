Outside of the "Guaranteed Housing
Plan" itself, few policies of the Stan
ford residence system have as wide
spread an impact as the Present Resi
dence Priority (PRP) option.
By allowing upperclass under
graduates in each campus residence a
higher priority for gaining (re)admis
sion to that residence than might be
obtained by other students, PRP is po
tentially both constructive and de
structive of the purposes of residential
life here.
PRP allows for a continuity in house
residence rolls from one year to the
next which is reputedly vital to prog
rammatic successes. PRP's existence is

deemed an incentive for current resi
dents to devote their efforts to house
projects, the fruits of which may be
born well beyond the end of a single
academic year.
Hut PRP also is alleged to perpetuate
the occasionally cliquish nature of
some houses, by restricting the infu
sion of "new blood." And, in so doing,
it may be preventing many students
from having the opportunity to live in
the more desirable on-campus resi
dences.
The PRP issue has come to the fore
this tall because of increasing com
plaints of inequity. Largely responsi
ble for the new vocality of objections,
one can assume, are the Guaranteed
Housing Plan, which virtually assures
that a student may spent two years in
the house s/he initially draws into, and
the existence of three very popular
new row houses.
To determine where the PRP stands
in the eyes of student residents, the
Subcommittee on Residences of the
Committee on Services to Students
(COSS/R) has initiated a comprehen
sive and concentrated effort to gain
community input.
The program begins tonight and to
morrow night with a series of informa
tional meetings at what we believe to
be a reasonable cross-section of stu
dent residences. Of course, attendance
is not limited to the residents of the
respective houses; all interested par
ties are asked to attend.
COSS/R member will open each
meeting with a summary of the pros
and cons of PRP, after which the floor
will be opened to questions and com
ments.
The purpose of these meetings,
however, is to generate thought rather
than to gather opinions. This latter
part of the input process is the goal of a
follow-up survey, to be distributed
during Dead Week.
Some resolutions of the issue which
are now envisaged included the aboli
tion of PRP, its retention in the present
form or by a subset of houses within
the system which can demonstrate a
need for such a priority, and the in
stitution of a percentage quota of cur
rent residents of a house who might
claim PRP.
COSS/R is genuinely undecided on
the issue at this time. The community
input we receive will be a weighty fac
tor in arriving at a decision.
We expect that our recommenda
tion, like the one of last year's COSS/R
to abolish Freshman Present Resi
dence Priority, will be incorporated
into university policy.

plaints of inequity. Largely responsi
ble for the new vocality of objections,
one can assume, are the Guaranteed
Housing Plan, which virtually assures
that a student may spent two years in
the house s/he initially draws into, and
the existence of three very popular
new row houses.
To determine where the PRP stands
in the eyes of student residents, the
Subcommittee on Residences of the
Committee on Services to Students
(COSS/R) has initiated a comprehen
sive and concentrated effort to gain
community input.
The program begins tonight and to
morrow night with a series of informa
tional meetings at what we believe to
be a reasonable cross-section of stu
dent residences. Of course, attendance
is not limited to the residents of the
respective houses; all interested par
ties are asked to attend.
COSS/R member will open each
meeting with a summary of the pros
and cons of PRP, after which the floor
will be opened to questions and com
ments.
The purpose of these meetings,
however, is to generate thought rather
than to gather opinions. This latter
part of the input process is the goal of a
follow-up survey, to be distributed
during Dead Week.
Some resolutions of the issue which
are now envisaged included the aboli
tion of PRP, its retention in the present
form or by a subset of houses within
the system which can demonstrate a
need for such a priority, and the in
stitution of a percentage quota of cur
rent residents of a house who might
claim PRP.
COSS/R is genuinely undecided on
the issue at this time. The community
input we receive will be a weighty fac
tor in arriving at a decision.
We expect that our recommenda
tion, like the one of last year's COSS/R
to abolish Freshman Present Resi
dence Priority, will be incorporated
into university policy.

Outside of the "Guaranteed Housing
Plan" itself, few policies of the Stan
ford residence system have as wide
spread an impact as the Present Resi
dence Priority (PRP) option.
By allowing upperclass under
graduates in each campus residence a
higher priority for gaining (re)admis
sion to that residence than might be
obtained by other students, PRP is po
tentially both constructive and de
structive of the purposes of residential
life here.
PRP allows for a continuity in house
residence rolls from one year to the
next which is reputedly vital to prog
rammatic successes. PRP's existence is

deemed an incentive for current resi
dents to devote their efforts to house
projects, the fruits of which may be
born well beyond the end of a single
academic year.
Hut PRP also is alleged to perpetuate
the occasionally cliquish nature of
some houses, by restricting the infu
sion of "new blood." And, in so doing,
it may be preventing many students
from having the opportunity to live in
the more desirable on-campus resi
dences.
The PRP issue has come to the fore
this tall because of increasing com
plaints of inequity. Largely responsi
