# Architecture program will formally end
## 
### Bil Snyder 
This spring the architecture
program at Stanford will be for
mally terminated. Provost Wil
liam Miller made the decision to
cut the 30-year-old program
from the university budget dur
ing the recession two years ago.
In a Daily article dated June
25, 1975, Miller said, "My
reasoning for this decision is
based primarily upon my feeling
that the program is inherently
unstable in concept."
The basis for that decision has
been grudgingly accepted by ar
chitecture faculty and students.
Nevertheless, even after two
years, some of them continue to
question it.
"1 feel very sad," said John
Stypla, who graduated from
Stanford in 1960, and who is a
licensed architect living in Palo
Alto. "I don't think the univer
sity knew what architecture was
all about," he said.
'Ignorant'
Another Stanford graduate
criticized Miller forthedecision.
"There is a very ignorant man
doing a very ignorant thing," he
said.
The decision to cut the prog
ram was prompted by the 1974
financial crisis.
The University Budget
Priorities Advisory Committee
reported to university President
Richard Lyman in January. 1975,
that "there is no question that
there will be less money availa
ble than can sustain all existing
programs, academic and
nonacademic, at their current
levels, and therefore there must
over the years 1975-78 be sub
stantial cuts in programs and
operations throughout the uni
versity."
One alternative
Deans were instructed to make
budget alternatives and to assess
theirconsequences. Engineering
School Dean William M. kayes
identified the elimination of the
architecture program as one al
ternative.
After meeting with Kayes,
Lyman, Assoc. Architecture
Prof. Robert Mittelstadt, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs, and members of the
budget priorities committee.
Miller decided that the elimina
tion of the program was "reason
able."
In a statement on the closure of
the program released July 20,
1975, Miller said "we cannot
sustain over the long run a stan
dard of excellence comparable to
other programs in the school and

in the university.
"The absence of solid
graduate and research feedback
would tend in time to erode the
undergraduate program in its at
tractivenss to faculty, its intel
lectual rigor, and its vitality
overall," he said.
Mittelstadt agreed with Miller
that the university needed a
strong graduate program. With
out the input of a depth of fa
culty, graduate students, and
ongoing research, the scope of
undergraduate work is nar
rowed, he said.
Not pre-professionai
In addition, many graduate
schools recently are accepting
more students who have not had
pre-professional training in ar
chitecture. "They tend to favor
people who come in cold, who
have nothing to unlearn," said
Mittelstadt.
Before the decision was
reached, in March 1975, Mit
telstadt proposed to Miller that
the graduate program be ex
panded. The new program
would grant master's degrees in
architecture and architecture
science. It would have three
full-time faculty positions and
one half-time position for lectur
ers, an increase of one and a half
positions. The program would
require a $112,000 budget.
Mittelstadt's proposal was re
jected. Because of the financial
squeeze, "We knew we couldn't
nourish it," said Wayne Price,
associate provost of budget and
planning. The school of en
gineering faced a tradeoff. If not
architecture, then which other
program would be cut?
Weak programs
Arthur Bienenstock, vice pro
vost for faculty affairs, captured
the essence of the administra
tion's position. According to a
Daily article dated Nov. 26,
1974, Bienenstock said, "If I
could, I would single out weak
and peripheral programs for the
deepest cuts.
"The university has no reason
for survival if it can't keep its
strong departments good and it
knows it,"he said.
But the situation was not quite
as simple as that. According to
Adams, the architecture prog
ram was brought up for review in
the first place because "it's never
been big time and prestigious,
it's never been accredited, and
it's never had a massive strength
of numbers."
Small department
Architecture has never been
large, neither in numbers of stu
dents nor in budget. Between

1965 and 1975 the program av
eraged 35 undergraduates and
20 graduates each year. During
that period, the program granted
104 undergraduate degrees and
75 graduate degrees, including
master's degrees in architecture,
urban planning, and chemical
engineering, said Mittelstadt.
Its budget has been between
$36,000 and $44,000 per year,
which according to Price, trans
lates into one faculty position.
Both Victor Thompson, who
headed the program until his re
tirement in 1972,and Mittelstadt
were able to stretch the budget to
pay their salary and the salaries
of various lecturers.
As a result, the program was
extremely cost efficient. Cost ef
ficiency is measured as cost per
student unit of instruction. Ac
cording to Mittelstadt, in au
tumn 1974, architecture had the
lowest cost per unit ratio of three
measured engineering prog
rams. Architecture cost $25.70,
the design division, excluding
architecture, $93.50, and the
thermosciences, $88.80.
Mittelstadt said that the dif
ference reflected the greater
faculty size and salaries of other
engineering programs, and the
ancillary costs of support
facilities, publications, and so
cial activities which architecture
did not have.
No bottled water
According to Beth Freiheit,
senior in architecture, the
budget is so tight this year that
"we can't even afford bottled wa
ter."
Even though the program was
cost efficient, Thompson be
lieves that the small budget was
"an embarrassment to the uni
versity."
The fact that many lecturers
taught courses for little more

than token payment gave the ar
chitecture program a bad reputa
tion. "Its reputation was not
based so much on performance
as the idea that you can't run a
program on gratis contributions,"
said Mittelstadt. "It wasn't
business-like."
Because the program had a
low profile, "it attracted only the
very dedicated students," said
Adams. A high percentage of
graduates have gone on to be
come licensed architects, some
of whom are developing impres
sive reputations.
Well-known grads
Some of the more well-known
graduates include John Carl
Warneke, California State Ar
chitect John Worsley, and Wil
liam Busse of Spenser As
sociates, Palo Alto, who de
signed several campus buildings
including Tresidder Union.
The university "didn't realize
how well they were doing on
such little investment," said
Stypula. "You can't connote
largeness with outstanding suc
cess."
The architecture program has
also suffered from a lack of sup
port from outside the university
in recent years.
"Thompson used to rely heav
ily on alumni who would then
bombard the administration
with letters of support," Mit
telstadt said. "We didn't do
that."
George Cody, a licensed ar
chitect in Palo Alto who
graduated from Stanford in 1956
said, "There never was an appeal
to graduates to make gifts" when
the program was threatened. But
he admitted that support from
alumni is difficult to generate
because of the individual nature
of the profession.
Thompson had been the

bandwagon beater for the ar
chitecture program for 20 years.
Mittelstadt inherited the direc
torship and its chronic
headaches, but was only in the
position a year and a half before
the recession hit Stanford.
More time
Had five years elapsed from
the time Thompson retired until
the financial crisis occured in
stead of one and a half, "the
program would have had a lot
better direction," said Adams. It
would have been stronger, and it
may have been able to gain more
support for its survival.
"It's almost been a noble ef
fort, and it has worked," said
Adams.
The 15 students who graduate
this spring will be the last par
ticipants in a formal architecture
program at the university. But
what of the students who con
tinue to express interest in ar
chitecture?
Move to design
According to Adams, the de
sign division of the engineering
school will pick up more stu
dents, some of whom would
have gone into architecture, but
he foresees "nothing in planning
that will give them any expan
sion."
Other students will find their
way into the Program on Urban
Studies. Fred Stout, director of
the program, in his budget re
quest for the coming year, has
recommended enlarging the un
dergraduate program to "incor
porate the three key under
graduate courses in the present
architecture program.
"If architecture were to be
completely phased out, our
ability to train pre-architecture
students wouldn't be devas
tated, but I think it would be de
creased," he said.

would grant master's degrees in
architecture and architecture
science. It would have three
full-time faculty positions and
one half-time position for lectur
ers, an increase of one and a half
positions. The program would
require a $112,000 budget.
Mittelstadt's proposal was re
jected. Because of the financial
squeeze, "We knew we couldn't
nourish it," said Wayne Price,
associate provost of budget and
planning. The school of en
gineering faced a tradeoff. If not
architecture, then which other
program would be cut?
Weak programs
Arthur Bienenstock, vice pro
vost for faculty affairs, captured
the essence of the administra
tion's position. According to a
Daily article dated Nov. 26,
1974, Bienenstock said, "If I
could, I would single out weak
and peripheral programs for the
deepest cuts.
"The university has no reason
for survival if it can't keep its
strong departments good and it
knows it,"he said.
But the situation was not quite
as simple as that. According to
Adams, the architecture prog
ram was brought up for review in
the first place because "it's never
been big time and prestigious,
it's never been accredited, and
it's never had a massive strength
of numbers."
Small department
Architecture has never been
large, neither in numbers of stu
dents nor in budget. Between

1965 and 1975 the program av
eraged 35 undergraduates and
20 graduates each year. During
that period, the program granted
104 undergraduate degrees and
75 graduate degrees, including
master's degrees in architecture,
urban planning, and chemical
engineering, said Mittelstadt.
Its budget has been between
$36,000 and $44,000 per year,
which according to Price, trans
lates into one faculty position.
Both Victor Thompson, who
headed the program until his re
tirement in 1972,and Mittelstadt
were able to stretch the budget to
pay their salary and the salaries
of various lecturers.
As a result, the program was
extremely cost efficient. Cost ef
ficiency is measured as cost per
student unit of instruction. Ac
cording to Mittelstadt, in au
tumn 1974, architecture had the
lowest cost per unit ratio of three
measured engineering prog
rams. Architecture cost $25.70,
the design division, excluding
architecture, $93.50, and the
thermosciences, $88.80.
Mittelstadt said that the dif
ference reflected the greater
faculty size and salaries of other
engineering programs, and the
ancillary costs of support
facilities, publications, and so
cial activities which architecture
did not have.
No bottled water
According to Beth Freiheit,
senior in architecture, the
budget is so tight this year that
"we can't even afford bottled wa
ter."
Even though the program was
cost efficient, Thompson be
lieves that the small budget was
"an embarrassment to the uni
versity."
The fact that many lecturers
taught courses for little more

than token payment gave the ar
chitecture program a bad reputa
tion. "Its reputation was not
based so much on performance
as the idea that you can't run a
program on gratis contributions,"
said Mittelstadt. "It wasn't
business-like."
Because the program had a
low profile, "it attracted only the
very dedicated students," said
Adams. A high percentage of
graduates have gone on to be
come licensed architects, some
of whom are developing impres
sive reputations.
Well-known grads
Some of the more well-known
graduates include John Carl
Warneke, California State Ar
chitect John Worsley, and Wil
liam Busse of Spenser As
sociates, Palo Alto, who de
signed several campus buildings
including Tresidder Union.
The university "didn't realize
how well they were doing on
such little investment," said
Stypula. "You can't connote
largeness with outstanding suc
cess."
The architecture program has
also suffered from a lack of sup
port from outside the university
in recent years.
"Thompson used to rely heav
ily on alumni who would then
bombard the administration
with letters of support," Mit
telstadt said. "We didn't do
that."
George Cody, a licensed ar
chitect in Palo Alto who
graduated from Stanford in 1956
said, "There never was an appeal
to graduates to make gifts" when
the program was threatened. But
he admitted that support from
alumni is difficult to generate
because of the individual nature
of the profession.
Thompson had been the

bandwagon beater for the ar
chitecture program for 20 years.
Mittelstadt inherited the direc
torship and its chronic
headaches, but was only in the
position a year and a half before
the recession hit Stanford.
More time
Had five years elapsed from
the time Thompson retired until
the financial crisis occured in
stead of one and a half, "the
program would have had a lot
better direction," said Adams. It
would have been stronger, and it
may have been able to gain more
support for its survival.
"It's almost been a noble ef
fort, and it has worked," said
Adams.
The 15 students who graduate
this spring will be the last par
ticipants in a formal architecture
program at the university. But
what of the students who con
tinue to express interest in ar
chitecture?
Move to design
According to Adams, the de
sign division of the engineering
school will pick up more stu
dents, some of whom would
have gone into architecture, but
he foresees "nothing in planning
that will give them any expan
sion."
Other students will find their
way into the Program on Urban
Studies. Fred Stout, director of
the program, in his budget re
quest for the coming year, has
recommended enlarging the un
dergraduate program to "incor
porate the three key under
graduate courses in the present
architecture program.
"If architecture were to be
completely phased out, our
ability to train pre-architecture
students wouldn't be devas
tated, but I think it would be de
creased," he said.
This spring the architecture
program at Stanford will be for
mally terminated. Provost Wil
liam Miller made the decision to
cut the 30-year-old program
from the university budget dur
ing the recession two years ago.
In a Daily article dated June
25, 1975, Miller said, "My
reasoning for this decision is
based primarily upon my feeling
that the program is inherently
unstable in concept."
The basis for that decision has
been grudgingly accepted by ar
chitecture faculty and students.
Nevertheless, even after two
years, some of them continue to
question it.
"1 feel very sad," said John
Stypla, who graduated from
Stanford in 1960, and who is a
licensed architect living in Palo
Alto. "I don't think the univer
sity knew what architecture was
all about," he said.
'Ignorant'
Another Stanford graduate
criticized Miller forthedecision.
"There is a very ignorant man
doing a very ignorant thing," he
said.
The decision to cut the prog
ram was prompted by the 1974
financial crisis.
The University Budget
Priorities Advisory Committee
reported to university President
Richard Lyman in January. 1975,
that "there is no question that
there will be less money availa
ble than can sustain all existing
programs, academic and
nonacademic, at their current
levels, and therefore there must
over the years 1975-78 be sub
stantial cuts in programs and
operations throughout the uni
versity."
One alternative
Deans were instructed to make
budget alternatives and to assess
theirconsequences. Engineering
School Dean William M. kayes
identified the elimination of the
architecture program as one al
ternative.
After meeting with Kayes,
Lyman, Assoc. Architecture
Prof. Robert Mittelstadt, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs, and members of the
budget priorities committee.
Miller decided that the elimina
tion of the program was "reason
able."
In a statement on the closure of
the program released July 20,
1975, Miller said "we cannot
sustain over the long run a stan
dard of excellence comparable to
other programs in the school and

in the university.
"The absence of solid
graduate and research feedback
would tend in time to erode the
undergraduate program in its at
tractivenss to faculty, its intel
lectual rigor, and its vitality
overall," he said.
Mittelstadt agreed with Miller
that the university needed a
strong graduate program. With
out the input of a depth of fa
culty, graduate students, and
ongoing research, the scope of
undergraduate work is nar
rowed, he said.
Not pre-professionai
In addition, many graduate
schools recently are accepting
more students who have not had
pre-professional training in ar
chitecture. "They tend to favor
people who come in cold, who
have nothing to unlearn," said
Mittelstadt.
Before the decision was
reached, in March 1975, Mit
telstadt proposed to Miller that
the graduate program be ex
panded. The new program

taught courses for little more

than token payment gave the ar
chitecture program a bad reputa
tion. "Its reputation was not
based so much on performance
as the idea that you can't run a
program on gratis contributions,"
said Mittelstadt. "It wasn't
business-like."
Because the program had a
low profile, "it attracted only the
very dedicated students," said
Adams. A high percentage of
graduates have gone on to be
come licensed architects, some
of whom are developing impres
sive reputations.
Well-known grads
Some of the more well-known
graduates include John Carl
Warneke, California State Ar
chitect John Worsley, and Wil
liam Busse of Spenser As
sociates, Palo Alto, who de
signed several campus buildings
including Tresidder Union.
The university "didn't realize
how well they were doing on
such little investment," said
Stypula. "You can't connote
largeness with outstanding suc
cess."
The architecture program has
also suffered from a lack of sup
port from outside the university
in recent years.
"Thompson used to rely heav
ily on alumni who would then
bombard the administration
with letters of support," Mit
telstadt said. "We didn't do
that."
George Cody, a licensed ar
chitect in Palo Alto who
graduated from Stanford in 1956
said, "There never was an appeal
to graduates to make gifts" when
the program was threatened. But
he admitted that support from
alumni is difficult to generate
because of the individual nature
of the profession.
Thompson had been the

bandwagon beater for the ar
chitecture program for 20 years.
Mittelstadt inherited the direc
torship and its chronic
headaches, but was only in the
position a year and a half before
the recession hit Stanford.
More time
Had five years elapsed from
the time Thompson retired until
the financial crisis occured in
stead of one and a half, "the
program would have had a lot
better direction," said Adams. It
would have been stronger, and it
may have been able to gain more
support for its survival.
"It's almost been a noble ef
fort, and it has worked," said
Adams.
The 15 students who graduate
this spring will be the last par
ticipants in a formal architecture
program at the university. But
what of the students who con
tinue to express interest in ar
chitecture?
Move to design
According to Adams, the de
sign division of the engineering
school will pick up more stu
dents, some of whom would
have gone into architecture, but
he foresees "nothing in planning
that will give them any expan
sion."
Other students will find their
way into the Program on Urban
Studies. Fred Stout, director of
the program, in his budget re
quest for the coming year, has
recommended enlarging the un
dergraduate program to "incor
porate the three key under
graduate courses in the present
architecture program.
"If architecture were to be
completely phased out, our
ability to train pre-architecture
students wouldn't be devas
tated, but I think it would be de
creased," he said.
This spring the architecture
program at Stanford will be for
mally terminated. Provost Wil
liam Miller made the decision to
cut the 30-year-old program
from the university budget dur
ing the recession two years ago.
In a Daily article dated June
25, 1975, Miller said, "My
reasoning for this decision is
based primarily upon my feeling
that the program is inherently
unstable in concept."
The basis for that decision has
been grudgingly accepted by ar
chitecture faculty and students.
Nevertheless, even after two
years, some of them continue to
question it.
"1 feel very sad," said John
Stypla, who graduated from
Stanford in 1960, and who is a
licensed architect living in Palo
Alto. "I don't think the univer
sity knew what architecture was
all about," he said.
'Ignorant'
Another Stanford graduate
criticized Miller forthedecision.
"There is a very ignorant man
doing a very ignorant thing," he
said.
The decision to cut the prog
ram was prompted by the 1974
financial crisis.
The University Budget
Priorities Advisory Committee
reported to university President
Richard Lyman in January. 1975,
that "there is no question that
there will be less money availa
ble than can sustain all existing
programs, academic and
nonacademic, at their current
levels, and therefore there must
over the years 1975-78 be sub
stantial cuts in programs and
operations throughout the uni
versity."
One alternative
Deans were instructed to make
budget alternatives and to assess
theirconsequences. Engineering
School Dean William M. kayes
identified the elimination of the
architecture program as one al
ternative.
After meeting with Kayes,
Lyman, Assoc. Architecture
Prof. Robert Mittelstadt, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs, and members of the
budget priorities committee.
Miller decided that the elimina
tion of the program was "reason
able."
In a statement on the closure of
the program released July 20,
1975, Miller said "we cannot
sustain over the long run a stan
dard of excellence comparable to
other programs in the school and

in the university.
"The absence of solid
graduate and research feedback
would tend in time to erode the
undergraduate program in its at
tractivenss to faculty, its intel
lectual rigor, and its vitality
overall," he said.
Mittelstadt agreed with Miller
that the university needed a
strong graduate program. With
out the input of a depth of fa
culty, graduate students, and
ongoing research, the scope of
undergraduate work is nar
rowed, he said.
Not pre-professionai
In addition, many graduate
schools recently are accepting
more students who have not had
pre-professional training in ar
chitecture. "They tend to favor
people who come in cold, who
have nothing to unlearn," said
Mittelstadt.
Before the decision was
reached, in March 1975, Mit
telstadt proposed to Miller that
the graduate program be ex
panded. The new program
would grant master's degrees in
architecture and architecture
science. It would have three
full-time faculty positions and
one half-time position for lectur
ers, an increase of one and a half
positions. The program would
require a $112,000 budget.
Mittelstadt's proposal was re
jected. Because of the financial
squeeze, "We knew we couldn't
nourish it," said Wayne Price,
associate provost of budget and
planning. The school of en
gineering faced a tradeoff. If not
architecture, then which other
program would be cut?
Weak programs
Arthur Bienenstock, vice pro
vost for faculty affairs, captured
the essence of the administra
tion's position. According to a
Daily article dated Nov. 26,
1974, Bienenstock said, "If I
could, I would single out weak
and peripheral programs for the
deepest cuts.
"The university has no reason
for survival if it can't keep its
strong departments good and it
knows it,"he said.
But the situation was not quite
as simple as that. According to
Adams, the architecture prog
ram was brought up for review in
the first place because "it's never
been big time and prestigious,
it's never been accredited, and
it's never had a massive strength
of numbers."
Small department
Architecture has never been
large, neither in numbers of stu
dents nor in budget. Between

1965 and 1975 the program av
eraged 35 undergraduates and
20 graduates each year. During
that period, the program granted
104 undergraduate degrees and
75 graduate degrees, including
master's degrees in architecture,
urban planning, and chemical
engineering, said Mittelstadt.
Its budget has been between
$36,000 and $44,000 per year,
which according to Price, trans
lates into one faculty position.
Both Victor Thompson, who
headed the program until his re
tirement in 1972,and Mittelstadt
were able to stretch the budget to
pay their salary and the salaries
of various lecturers.
As a result, the program was
extremely cost efficient. Cost ef
ficiency is measured as cost per
student unit of instruction. Ac
cording to Mittelstadt, in au
tumn 1974, architecture had the
lowest cost per unit ratio of three
measured engineering prog
rams. Architecture cost $25.70,
the design division, excluding
architecture, $93.50, and the
thermosciences, $88.80.
Mittelstadt said that the dif
ference reflected the greater
faculty size and salaries of other
engineering programs, and the
ancillary costs of support
facilities, publications, and so
cial activities which architecture
did not have.
No bottled water
According to Beth Freiheit,
senior in architecture, the
budget is so tight this year that
"we can't even afford bottled wa
ter."
Even though the program was
cost efficient, Thompson be
lieves that the small budget was
"an embarrassment to the uni
versity."
The fact that many lecturers
taught courses for little more

than token payment gave the ar

tated, but I think it would be de
creased," he said.
This spring the architecture
program at Stanford will be for
mally terminated. Provost Wil
liam Miller made the decision to
cut the 30-year-old program
from the university budget dur
ing the recession two years ago.
In a Daily article dated June
25, 1975, Miller said, "My
reasoning for this decision is
based primarily upon my feeling
that the program is inherently
unstable in concept."
The basis for that decision has
been grudgingly accepted by ar
chitecture faculty and students.
Nevertheless, even after two
years, some of them continue to
question it.
"1 feel very sad," said John
Stypla, who graduated from
Stanford in 1960, and who is a
licensed architect living in Palo
Alto. "I don't think the univer
sity knew what architecture was
all about," he said.
'Ignorant'
Another Stanford graduate
criticized Miller forthedecision.
"There is a very ignorant man
doing a very ignorant thing," he
said.
The decision to cut the prog
ram was prompted by the 1974
financial crisis.
The University Budget
Priorities Advisory Committee
reported to university President
Richard Lyman in January. 1975,
that "there is no question that
there will be less money availa
ble than can sustain all existing
programs, academic and
nonacademic, at their current
levels, and therefore there must
over the years 1975-78 be sub
stantial cuts in programs and
operations throughout the uni
versity."
One alternative
Deans were instructed to make
budget alternatives and to assess
theirconsequences. Engineering
School Dean William M. kayes
identified the elimination of the
architecture program as one al
ternative.
After meeting with Kayes,
Lyman, Assoc. Architecture
Prof. Robert Mittelstadt, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs, and members of the
budget priorities committee.
Miller decided that the elimina
tion of the program was "reason
able."
In a statement on the closure of
the program released July 20,
1975, Miller said "we cannot
sustain over the long run a stan
dard of excellence comparable to
other programs in the school and

in the university.
"The absence of solid
graduate and research feedback
would tend in time to erode the
undergraduate program in its at
tractivenss to faculty, its intel
lectual rigor, and its vitality
overall," he said.
Mittelstadt agreed with Miller
that the university needed a
strong graduate program. With
out the input of a depth of fa
culty, graduate students, and
ongoing research, the scope of
undergraduate work is nar
rowed, he said.
Not pre-professionai
In addition, many graduate
schools recently are accepting
more students who have not had
pre-professional training in ar
chitecture. "They tend to favor
people who come in cold, who
have nothing to unlearn," said
Mittelstadt.
Before the decision was
reached, in March 1975, Mit
telstadt proposed to Miller that
the graduate program be ex
panded. The new program
would grant master's degrees in
architecture and architecture
science. It would have three
full-time faculty positions and
one half-time position for lectur
ers, an increase of one and a half
positions. The program would
require a $112,000 budget.
Mittelstadt's proposal was re
jected. Because of the financial
squeeze, "We knew we couldn't
nourish it," said Wayne Price,
associate provost of budget and
planning. The school of en
gineering faced a tradeoff. If not
architecture, then which other
program would be cut?
Weak programs
Arthur Bienenstock, vice pro
vost for faculty affairs, captured
the essence of the administra
tion's position. According to a
Daily article dated Nov. 26,
1974, Bienenstock said, "If I
could, I would single out weak
and peripheral programs for the
deepest cuts.
"The university has no reason
for survival if it can't keep its
strong departments good and it
knows it,"he said.
But the situation was not quite
as simple as that. According to
Adams, the architecture prog
ram was brought up for review in
the first place because "it's never
been big time and prestigious,
it's never been accredited, and
it's never had a massive strength
of numbers."
Small department
Architecture has never been
large, neither in numbers of stu
dents nor in budget. Between

1965 and 1975 the program av
eraged 35 undergraduates and
20 graduates each year. During
that period, the program granted
104 undergraduate degrees and
75 graduate degrees, including
master's degrees in architecture,
urban planning, and chemical
engineering, said Mittelstadt.
Its budget has been between
$36,000 and $44,000 per year,
which according to Price, trans
lates into one faculty position.
Both Victor Thompson, who
headed the program until his re
tirement in 1972,and Mittelstadt
were able to stretch the budget to
pay their salary and the salaries
of various lecturers.
As a result, the program was
extremely cost efficient. Cost ef
ficiency is measured as cost per
student unit of instruction. Ac
cording to Mittelstadt, in au
tumn 1974, architecture had the
lowest cost per unit ratio of three
measured engineering prog
rams. Architecture cost $25.70,
the design division, excluding
architecture, $93.50, and the
thermosciences, $88.80.
Mittelstadt said that the dif
ference reflected the greater
faculty size and salaries of other
engineering programs, and the
ancillary costs of support
facilities, publications, and so
cial activities which architecture
did not have.
No bottled water
According to Beth Freiheit,
senior in architecture, the
budget is so tight this year that
"we can't even afford bottled wa
ter."
Even though the program was
cost efficient, Thompson be
lieves that the small budget was
"an embarrassment to the uni
versity."
The fact that many lecturers
taught courses for little more

than token payment gave the ar
chitecture program a bad reputa
tion. "Its reputation was not
based so much on performance
as the idea that you can't run a
program on gratis contributions,"
said Mittelstadt. "It wasn't
business-like."
Because the program had a
low profile, "it attracted only the
very dedicated students," said
Adams. A high percentage of
graduates have gone on to be
come licensed architects, some
of whom are developing impres
sive reputations.
Well-known grads
Some of the more well-known
graduates include John Carl
Warneke, California State Ar
chitect John Worsley, and Wil
liam Busse of Spenser As
sociates, Palo Alto, who de
signed several campus buildings
including Tresidder Union.
The university "didn't realize
how well they were doing on
such little investment," said
Stypula. "You can't connote
largeness with outstanding suc
cess."
The architecture program has
also suffered from a lack of sup
port from outside the university
in recent years.
"Thompson used to rely heav
ily on alumni who would then
bombard the administration
with letters of support," Mit
telstadt said. "We didn't do
that."
George Cody, a licensed ar
chitect in Palo Alto who
graduated from Stanford in 1956
said, "There never was an appeal
to graduates to make gifts" when
the program was threatened. But
he admitted that support from
alumni is difficult to generate
because of the individual nature
of the profession.
Thompson had been the

bandwagon beater for the ar
chitecture program for 20 years.
Mittelstadt inherited the direc
torship and its chronic
headaches, but was only in the
position a year and a half before
the recession hit Stanford.
More time
Had five years elapsed from
the time Thompson retired until
the financial crisis occured in
stead of one and a half, "the
program would have had a lot
better direction," said Adams. It
would have been stronger, and it
may have been able to gain more
support for its survival.
"It's almost been a noble ef
fort, and it has worked," said
Adams.
The 15 students who graduate
this spring will be the last par
ticipants in a formal architecture
program at the university. But
what of the students who con
tinue to express interest in ar
chitecture?
Move to design
According to Adams, the de
sign division of the engineering
school will pick up more stu
dents, some of whom would
have gone into architecture, but
he foresees "nothing in planning
that will give them any expan
sion."
Other students will find their
way into the Program on Urban
Studies. Fred Stout, director of
the program, in his budget re
quest for the coming year, has
recommended enlarging the un
dergraduate program to "incor
porate the three key under
graduate courses in the present
architecture program.
"If architecture were to be
completely phased out, our
ability to train pre-architecture
students wouldn't be devas
tated, but I think it would be de
creased," he said.

telstadt proposed to Miller that
the graduate program be ex
panded. The new program
would grant master's degrees in
architecture and architecture
science. It would have three
full-time faculty positions and
one half-time position for lectur
ers, an increase of one and a half
positions. The program would
require a $112,000 budget.
Mittelstadt's proposal was re
jected. Because of the financial
squeeze, "We knew we couldn't
nourish it," said Wayne Price,
associate provost of budget and
planning. The school of en
gineering faced a tradeoff. If not
architecture, then which other
program would be cut?
Weak programs
Arthur Bienenstock, vice pro
vost for faculty affairs, captured
the essence of the administra
tion's position. According to a
Daily article dated Nov. 26,
1974, Bienenstock said, "If I
could, I would single out weak
and peripheral programs for the
deepest cuts.
"The university has no reason
for survival if it can't keep its
strong departments good and it
knows it,"he said.
But the situation was not quite
as simple as that. According to
Adams, the architecture prog
ram was brought up for review in
the first place because "it's never
been big time and prestigious,
it's never been accredited, and
it's never had a massive strength
of numbers."
Small department
Architecture has never been
large, neither in numbers of stu
dents nor in budget. Between

1965 and 1975 the program av
eraged 35 undergraduates and
20 graduates each year. During
that period, the program granted
104 undergraduate degrees and
75 graduate degrees, including
master's degrees in architecture,
urban planning, and chemical
engineering, said Mittelstadt.
Its budget has been between
$36,000 and $44,000 per year,
which according to Price, trans
lates into one faculty position.
Both Victor Thompson, who
headed the program until his re
tirement in 1972,and Mittelstadt
were able to stretch the budget to
pay their salary and the salaries
of various lecturers.
As a result, the program was
extremely cost efficient. Cost ef
ficiency is measured as cost per
student unit of instruction. Ac
cording to Mittelstadt, in au
tumn 1974, architecture had the
lowest cost per unit ratio of three
measured engineering prog
rams. Architecture cost $25.70,
the design division, excluding
architecture, $93.50, and the
thermosciences, $88.80.
Mittelstadt said that the dif
ference reflected the greater
faculty size and salaries of other
engineering programs, and the
ancillary costs of support
facilities, publications, and so
cial activities which architecture
did not have.
No bottled water
According to Beth Freiheit,
senior in architecture, the
budget is so tight this year that
"we can't even afford bottled wa
ter."
Even though the program was
cost efficient, Thompson be
lieves that the small budget was
"an embarrassment to the uni
versity."
The fact that many lecturers
taught courses for little more

than token payment gave the ar
chitecture program a bad reputa
tion. "Its reputation was not
based so much on performance
as the idea that you can't run a
program on gratis contributions,"
said Mittelstadt. "It wasn't
business-like."
Because the program had a
low profile, "it attracted only the
very dedicated students," said
Adams. A high percentage of
graduates have gone on to be
come licensed architects, some
of whom are developing impres
sive reputations.
Well-known grads
Some of the more well-known
graduates include John Carl
Warneke, California State Ar
chitect John Worsley, and Wil
liam Busse of Spenser As
sociates, Palo Alto, who de
signed several campus buildings
including Tresidder Union.
The university "didn't realize
how well they were doing on
such little investment," said
Stypula. "You can't connote
largeness with outstanding suc
cess."
The architecture program has
also suffered from a lack of sup
port from outside the university
in recent years.
"Thompson used to rely heav
ily on alumni who would then
bombard the administration
with letters of support," Mit
telstadt said. "We didn't do
that."
George Cody, a licensed ar
chitect in Palo Alto who
graduated from Stanford in 1956
said, "There never was an appeal
to graduates to make gifts" when
the program was threatened. But
he admitted that support from
alumni is difficult to generate
because of the individual nature
of the profession.
Thompson had been the

bandwagon beater for the ar
chitecture program for 20 years.
Mittelstadt inherited the direc
torship and its chronic
headaches, but was only in the
position a year and a half before
the recession hit Stanford.
More time
Had five years elapsed from
the time Thompson retired until
the financial crisis occured in
stead of one and a half, "the
program would have had a lot
better direction," said Adams. It
would have been stronger, and it
may have been able to gain more
support for its survival.
"It's almost been a noble ef
fort, and it has worked," said
Adams.
The 15 students who graduate
this spring will be the last par
ticipants in a formal architecture
program at the university. But
what of the students who con
tinue to express interest in ar
chitecture?
Move to design
According to Adams, the de
sign division of the engineering
school will pick up more stu
dents, some of whom would
have gone into architecture, but
he foresees "nothing in planning
that will give them any expan
sion."
Other students will find their
way into the Program on Urban
Studies. Fred Stout, director of
the program, in his budget re
quest for the coming year, has
recommended enlarging the un
dergraduate program to "incor
porate the three key under
graduate courses in the present
architecture program.
"If architecture were to be
completely phased out, our
ability to train pre-architecture
students wouldn't be devas
tated, but I think it would be de
creased," he said.
