With construction completed on the new Stanford !
Shopping Center Mall, expectations are running high
'an unusually busy Christmas shopping season. i
' The number of shoppers who appeared at the center
last Friday, on the first day of the holiday shopping'
'period was "way over last year," according to
'Dominico, secretary to Walter Plonski, who is the
er's general manager.
' Dominico added that "25 per cent of the center's an-'
r nual business takes place in late November and the pre-
Christmas part of December." 1
} Martin Ralsky. general manager of Saks Fifth Avenue, 1
rsaid, "We are expecting a very big Christmas. With the
construction at the mall halted for the season, peopled
Â» will be coming to enjoy the mall; people have avoided
, while the construction was going on."
Kevin Honkomp. store manager at the Emporium,
pthat "the construction is finished; and we're hoping it'll
f improve traffic."
Dorothy Rossi, store manager at 1. Magnin, called the 1
f Mall "very, very attractive," and said that it "will bring
t more people."
"Our business is very good." said Rossi, who
( dieted that the same items would probably dominate as (
gifts this year as did last year.
