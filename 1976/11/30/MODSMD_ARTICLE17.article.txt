their wares, will display goods
ranging from lapidary and
stained glass music boxes, to

cents to 300 dollars.
Entertainment will be pro
vided for by both choral and in

strumental groups, including
"Waterwheel," a folk duo, and
"Clay winds," a group which
plays only ceramic instruments.
Traditional Stanford groups
such as the "Mendicants" and
the Stanford Jazz Band will also

Palo Alto High School Madrigal
Singers will do some traditional
Christmas chpral music, and the
"Flying karavnozov Brothers"

including knishes, shish kabob
and hot cider. Marcel's, a pastry
shop inTresidder, will offer spe

The Faire began five years ago
as the brainchild of Martin and

Roger Thacker, who was then a
student. Thacker has since left
the University, but Martin has
remained the directing force be
hind the Faire. In its first year,
the Faire had only 40 craftsper
sons.and was intended by Martin
and Thacker to be a place where
"people could just come and
have fun before leaving for
Christmas break."
The Faire has since doubled in
size, and as many as 10,000
people are expected to attend
this year. The Tresidder Student
Board will receive 20 per cent of
the revenue collected by the
merchants, and that money will
be used to sponsor activities
such as patio concerts, art
exhibits, and the Thursday
Evening Lecture series at Tre
sidder during the school year.
Last years Faire netted over
$5900.
The Faire itself will be held in
the second floor lounge, the
lobby, and on the covered patio
of Tresidder.

the University, but Martin has
remained the directing force be
hind the Faire. In its first year,
the Faire had only 40 craftsper
sons.and was intended by Martin
and Thacker to be a place where
"people could just come and
have fun before leaving for
Christmas break."
The Faire has since doubled in
size, and as many as 10,000
people are expected to attend
this year. The Tresidder Student

the revenue collected by the
merchants, and that money will
be used to sponsor activities

Last years Faire netted over
$5900.
The Faire itself will be held in
the second floor lounge, the
