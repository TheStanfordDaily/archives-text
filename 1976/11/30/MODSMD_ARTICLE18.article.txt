Mike McCormack, Democratic
congressman from Washington,
spoke on "The Future of United
States Energy Policy" to Stan
ford's Energy Policy Seminar
Monday in Skilling Auditorium.
His talk centered on U.S. con
sumption of energy and expen
ditures in related areas.
According to McCormack,
petroleum currently constitutes
43 per cent of the United States'
energy consumption. This is up
from 35 per cent three years ago
and the figures are likely to
climb to 50 per cent or more
soon.
Coal consumption, McCor
mack indicated, has gone up
only 12 per cent in the last three
years. This is still below its con
sumption peak of the 1950's and
1960'5.
The U.S. now has 62 nuclear
plants. "This number is below
where we would like to be," said
McCormack. Projections for
1985 have been steadily decreas
ing from 235 projected three
years ago to today's projection of
160.
Presently, the U.S. consumes
34 million barrels per day
(b.p.d.) oil equivalent of energy.
We are currently experiencing
an annual growth rate of 3.6 per
cent. According to McCormack,
the goal is a two per cent growth
rat 6. This may be the result of
conservation efforts and cost in
creases which would drive up
prices, thereby reducing con
sumption.
Even with a two per cent
growth rate we could reach con
sumption of 50 million b.p.d. by
2000. McCormack projects that
our actual consumption will
reach 60 to 70 million b.p.d. by
that year.
By 2000, McCormack projects
that three to five per cent of our
energy needs will be met by solar

energy and an equal amount by
waste recovery programs and
industrial recycling. One to two
per cent of our needs will come
from geothernial sources and
four per cent will be provided by
hydroelectric power. These are
optimistic figures admitted
McCormack, and mean that
about thirteen per cent of our
energy will come from sources
other than fossil fuels and nuc
lear power.
The remaining 87 per cent
consumption, McCormack esti
mates, will be shared equally by
coal and shale, domestic oil and
natural gas, and nuclear power.
This assumes an existence of 600
to 700 nuclear plants in the
country and an additional half
million men mining coal.
During the fiscal year 1976,
the federal government spent $2
billion in energy research, pro
duction and related areas. $3
billion has been appropriated for
fiscal 1977.
Much of 1977's appropria
tions will go toward nuclear
power. This includes fission,
magnetic fusion, lasar fusion
and fuel cycle research. This
will add up to $1.4 billion,
nearly double expenditures two
years ago.
$483 million has been approp
riated toward fossil fuels. This is
up from $335 million two years
ago, but is only one quarter what
it should be, according to
McCormack.
Solar energy will claim $290
million this year. This is over six
times the expenditure of fiscal
1975. Ceothermal expenditure
will double this year from two
years ago at $55 million. Five
years ago the expenditure was
one million.
$161 million has been approp
riated for conservation. This is
four times what it was two years
ago. $264 million will be spent
on environmental and safety re
search. According to McCor
mack, we're trying to make coal
as safe to convert into energy as
nuclear sources.
Congress is definitely becom
ing much more concerned with
energy issues each year. When
McCormack was a freshman in
1971, he said, there was one
energy committee in the House.
Now there are 55 committees
that claim jurisdiction over
energy.
McCormack is a congressman
from Washington's fourth dis
trict. He has a B.S. and M.S. in
chemistry, one of only two in the
House with an advanced degree
in "hard" science. He was first
elected to the House of Rep
resentatives in 1970.

where we would like to be," said
McCormack. Projections for
1985 have been steadily decreas
ing from 235 projected three
years ago to today's projection of
160.
Presently, the U.S. consumes
34 million barrels per day
(b.p.d.) oil equivalent of energy.
We are currently experiencing
an annual growth rate of 3.6 per
cent. According to McCormack,
the goal is a two per cent growth
rat 6. This may be the result of
conservation efforts and cost in
creases which would drive up
prices, thereby reducing con
sumption.
Even with a two per cent
growth rate we could reach con
sumption of 50 million b.p.d. by
2000. McCormack projects that
our actual consumption will
reach 60 to 70 million b.p.d. by
that year.
By 2000, McCormack projects
that three to five per cent of our
energy needs will be met by solar

energy and an equal amount by
waste recovery programs and
industrial recycling. One to two
per cent of our needs will come
from geothernial sources and
four per cent will be provided by
hydroelectric power. These are
optimistic figures admitted
McCormack, and mean that
about thirteen per cent of our
energy will come from sources
other than fossil fuels and nuc
lear power.
The remaining 87 per cent
consumption, McCormack esti
mates, will be shared equally by
coal and shale, domestic oil and
natural gas, and nuclear power.
This assumes an existence of 600
to 700 nuclear plants in the
country and an additional half
million men mining coal.
During the fiscal year 1976,
the federal government spent $2
billion in energy research, pro
duction and related areas. $3
billion has been appropriated for
fiscal 1977.
Much of 1977's appropria
tions will go toward nuclear
power. This includes fission,
magnetic fusion, lasar fusion
and fuel cycle research. This
will add up to $1.4 billion,
nearly double expenditures two
years ago.
$483 million has been approp
riated toward fossil fuels. This is
up from $335 million two years
ago, but is only one quarter what
it should be, according to
McCormack.
Solar energy will claim $290
million this year. This is over six
times the expenditure of fiscal
1975. Ceothermal expenditure
will double this year from two
years ago at $55 million. Five
years ago the expenditure was
one million.
$161 million has been approp
riated for conservation. This is
four times what it was two years
ago. $264 million will be spent
on environmental and safety re
search. According to McCor
mack, we're trying to make coal
as safe to convert into energy as
nuclear sources.
Congress is definitely becom
ing much more concerned with
energy issues each year. When
McCormack was a freshman in
1971, he said, there was one
energy committee in the House.
Now there are 55 committees
that claim jurisdiction over
energy.
McCormack is a congressman
from Washington's fourth dis
trict. He has a B.S. and M.S. in
chemistry, one of only two in the
House with an advanced degree
in "hard" science. He was first
elected to the House of Rep
resentatives in 1970.
Mike McCormack, Democratic
congressman from Washington,
spoke on "The Future of United
States Energy Policy" to Stan
ford's Energy Policy Seminar
Monday in Skilling Auditorium.
His talk centered on U.S. con
sumption of energy and expen
ditures in related areas.
According to McCormack,
petroleum currently constitutes
43 per cent of the United States'
energy consumption. This is up
from 35 per cent three years ago
and the figures are likely to
climb to 50 per cent or more
soon.
Coal consumption, McCor
mack indicated, has gone up
only 12 per cent in the last three
years. This is still below its con
sumption peak of the 1950's and
1960'5.
The U.S. now has 62 nuclear
plants. "This number is below
where we would like to be," said
McCormack. Projections for
1985 have been steadily decreas
ing from 235 projected three
