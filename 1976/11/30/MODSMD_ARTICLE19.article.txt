# Successful Henry Minturn
## Earthquake predictor draws interest 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Another
in a string of successful ear
thquake predictions earned
Henry Minturn the cautious in
terest of scientists and disaster
officials yesterday, but one
seismologist said the press was
"being taken for a ride."
A string of quake forecasts that
proved true—though some were
vague as to essential details—
has resulted in a barrage of tele
phone calls to the suburban
Hawthorne house where Min
turn said he was "hiding out."
No one was calling the 55-
year-old geophysicist a
crackpot, though Dr. Peter Ward
of the U.S. Geological Survey
said part of Minturn's method
has been proven "very unreli
able" in extensive research.
"We hit it right on the nose,"
Minturn said yesterday after a
quake registering 7.3 struck
northern Chile and southern
Peru. Last week he had predicted
a large quake would strike
"south of Mexico City" on Nov.
29. The day was right, but the
quake center was about 2400
miles south of Mexico City.
"From southern Chile to
Mexico City is a major seismic
zone," said Ward, adding that
any prediction touching that
area would be likely to be borne
out. Hut a quake of magnitude
seven occurs only about once a
year in the area, he conceded.
Public interest in the previ
ously unknown Minturn. of

Pueblo, Colo., has quickened
since he aired predictions of a
quake in the Solomon Islands
area of the South Pacific on Dec.
7 and another in southern
California on Dec. 20. The
southern California jolt, how
ever, will only occur if the Sol
omon Islands quake does in fact
happen, said Minturn. He did
not predict how large the south
ern California quake might be.
A spokesman for the state Of
fice of Emergency Services
spoke with Minturn Monday
and said the geophysicist agreed
to submit written information on
his method. It could lead to a
review of the predictions by the
California Earthquake Predic
tion Evaluation Council, which
is supposed to advise the OES
and the governor on the validity
of public forecasts.
Ward of the U.S.G.S. expres
sed interest in talking to Min
turn, saying he has an "open
mind." Yet Ward said it ap
peared that the forecaster had
"learned enough code words to
make himself sound authentic"

and added that a television net
work that has featured Minturn's
predictions "is being taken for a
ride."
Cal Tech
California Institute of
Technology seismologists also
were reported interested in his
work, although Cal Tech's ear
thquake lab issued a statement
declining comment on any indi
vidual predictions in light of a
rash of rumors in past weeks.
The South American quake
"was a miss geographically but
it fit the theory exactly," said
Minturn, who said the has a Ph.D
in engineering but has not been
affiliated with any scientific in
stitutions.
His method combines plate
tectonics—the modern theory
that says quakes are generated
out of friction between huge con
tinental plates that rub each
other —and the notion of quake
triggering by the tidal pull of the
moon.
General forecasts
Several other predictions this
year by Minturn have also been
borne out, he claims. But Ward
pointed out that Minturn doesn't
forecast the magnitude of the
quake, as scientific forecasters
do, and often mentions general
areas such as "the southern
California region" or "south of
Mexico City" or "the Middle
East."
He said that in a s£ismically
active area like southern

California, a dozen to two dozen
minor quakes are recorded every
day by seismometers, so any
prediction for a quake in the reg
ion would likely prove true.
The possible action of the
moon's gravitational pull in set
ting off quakes has been
thoroughly studied, said Ward,
and "it's been very unreliable. In
California it's been studied and
there is no correlation."
Continental plates
The other part of Minturn's
method concerns the constant
motion of the huge continental
plates, which slip and slide
against each other, often at the
edge of a continent.
Minturn freely admits he
hopes publicity about his work
will lead to increased gov
ernmental funding of ear
thquake research—and in par
ticular, his own.
The forecasts for the Solomon
Islands and southern California
quakes will be his last distri

buted to the media, he said.
"We've got to deal with this from
a scientific point of view," he
said.
Because his forecasts do not
pinpoint quake targets or par
ticular faults, he agreed, they
would be useless for saving lives
by evacuating cities.
"What we can do is alert the sci
entists in a certain region to
study it,"he said. "That's all 1
intend to do."
