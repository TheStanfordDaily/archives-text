# Oil institution strives to increase well output

One of the primary goals of the
newly formed Stanford University Pet
roleum Recovery Institute (SUPRI) "is
to determine methods to recover sig
nificantly more oil from known heavy
petroleum reservoirs in California."
according to its principal investigator.
Assoc. Petroleum Engineering Prof.
William Hrigharn, a well-known ex
pert in oil recovery technology, esti
mates that with improved techniques,
heavy oil recovery could he doubled in
the next 20 to 30 years here.
The sponsor of the new research
center, the United States Energy Re
search and Development Administra
tion (ERDA), has supplied SI IPRI with
an initial budget of $350,000 per year
to boost the quantity of heavy oil being
recovered from California wells.
Primarily, the institute will concen
trate on oil wells in operation with the
"purpose of extending the lives of

these wells" although new wells are
also under consideration, said
Brigham.
Three principal directions of re
search being undertaken include
laboratory studies of heavy-oil flow at
higher temperatures, a search for new
agents to improve the release of heavy
oils by steam injection techniques and
field evaluations of air injection and
underground projects to raise temper
atures and pressure.
"All three of these projects are
aimed at understanding the roles of
reservoir permeability and thickness,
oil viscosity and geologic environ
ment in the recovery of oil when the
reservoir temperature is raised," said
Brigham.
"Soon our studies will branch out
into other areas of recovery research
and applicability wherever heavy oil
exists," Brigham added.
