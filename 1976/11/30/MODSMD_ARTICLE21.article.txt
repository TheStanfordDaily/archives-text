# Foreign students happy with Sloan
## 
### Elizabeth Pollock Staff writer 
Foreign students participating in this
year's Sloan Program at the business school
are generally pleased with the program, but
indicated that opportunities for social in
teraction are limited and the workload is
very demanding.
The Sloan Program enables about 40
middle management executives per year
(ages 30-45) to earn a Master of Science in
Management from Stanford in nine months.
The sudents arrive in early September for a
three week "Pre-term", during which they
re-adjust to academic life, meet the compu
ter and acquire a common background with
which to start the yar.
Then, in three quarters, the Sloan Fellows
take 11 core and four elective courses —all
the basic courses and fields of management
offered at the Graduate School of Business
(GSB).
Top positions
Sloan Fellows are chosen to participate
by their companies and have demonstrated
potential for senior management. This year
39 men and three women from 37 organiza
tions are enrolled.
"My object of participation is to know
American people well," said Takuya
Fujimura, chief of cost and budget section of

Toa, Nenryo Kogyo, a Tokyo-based firm.
Nat Aboumrad, who is president of a
holding company of six computer com
panies in Mexico, said, "1 felt that if I did not
liave more training in management, my bus
iness would grow bigger than 1 could
handle." He explained that he "could spend
at most one year" in school, a sentiment
echoed by other participants.
Aboumrad is keeping in touch with his
business in Mexico but chose to come here
to study management because, "to concen
trate in studying, I had to be away from my
business."
GM
Ivan Deveson, a manager for General
Motors Gontinental in Antwerp, Belgium, is
the first person to be sent from General
Motors' Overseas Division. He suggested
that, "It's the first time it's been a degree
program, and GM stepped up its participa
tion on the basis that it's a degree program."
GM has been a regular participant in Sloan
Programs here and at MIT. Before, particip
ants received only a certificate of comple
tion from the university.
Deveson said that one way the fellows
have arranged contacts is through lunch
time seminars twice a week at which two
fellows per session introduce themselves.
He said the fellows who attend, about 60 per

cent of those enrolled, are "learning about a
person and a profession at the same time."
The seminars are "particularly interesting
with the foreign people," said Deveson.
Peter Hutchison, who works in Peruvian
operations for a London-based firm said he
"felt it somewhat of an honor to be selected"
and that participation "will enhance my
prospects (in the firm)."
Quality
He explained that American management
techniques are not that much different from
those taught in Europe, but that it was "the
quality of things that are being taught at
Stanford that attracted the firm to send me
here."
Chris Pendleton, who came here from
New Zealand, said he'd had a little trouble
learning procedures about such things as
enrolling the kids in school and buying car
insurance, but that it was "much easier than
1 thought to fit in."
The balanced nature of Stanford's cur
riculum was particularly important to Juno
Sawamura, assistant manager of The Mit
subishi Bank, Ltd. in Tokyo. Stanford
employs a combination of lectures, outside
reading, case methods and class discussion
to teach the material. It is also less quantita
tively oriented than MIT.

Management from Stanford in nine months.
The sudents arrive in early September for a
three week "Pre-term", during which they
re-adjust to academic life, meet the compu
ter and acquire a common background with
which to start the yar.
Then, in three quarters, the Sloan Fellows
take 11 core and four elective courses —all
the basic courses and fields of management
offered at the Graduate School of Business
(GSB).
Top positions
Sloan Fellows are chosen to participate
by their companies and have demonstrated
potential for senior management. This year
39 men and three women from 37 organiza
tions are enrolled.
"My object of participation is to know
American people well," said Takuya
Fujimura, chief of cost and budget section of

Toa, Nenryo Kogyo, a Tokyo-based firm.
Nat Aboumrad, who is president of a
holding company of six computer com
panies in Mexico, said, "1 felt that if I did not
liave more training in management, my bus
iness would grow bigger than 1 could
handle." He explained that he "could spend
at most one year" in school, a sentiment
echoed by other participants.
Aboumrad is keeping in touch with his
business in Mexico but chose to come here
to study management because, "to concen
trate in studying, I had to be away from my
business."
GM
Ivan Deveson, a manager for General
Motors Gontinental in Antwerp, Belgium, is
the first person to be sent from General
Motors' Overseas Division. He suggested
that, "It's the first time it's been a degree
program, and GM stepped up its participa
tion on the basis that it's a degree program."
GM has been a regular participant in Sloan
Programs here and at MIT. Before, particip
ants received only a certificate of comple
tion from the university.
Deveson said that one way the fellows
have arranged contacts is through lunch
time seminars twice a week at which two
fellows per session introduce themselves.
He said the fellows who attend, about 60 per

cent of those enrolled, are "learning about a
person and a profession at the same time."
The seminars are "particularly interesting
with the foreign people," said Deveson.
Peter Hutchison, who works in Peruvian
operations for a London-based firm said he
"felt it somewhat of an honor to be selected"
and that participation "will enhance my
prospects (in the firm)."
Quality
He explained that American management
techniques are not that much different from
those taught in Europe, but that it was "the
quality of things that are being taught at
Stanford that attracted the firm to send me
here."
Chris Pendleton, who came here from
New Zealand, said he'd had a little trouble
learning procedures about such things as
enrolling the kids in school and buying car
insurance, but that it was "much easier than
1 thought to fit in."
The balanced nature of Stanford's cur
riculum was particularly important to Juno
Sawamura, assistant manager of The Mit
subishi Bank, Ltd. in Tokyo. Stanford
employs a combination of lectures, outside
reading, case methods and class discussion
to teach the material. It is also less quantita
tively oriented than MIT.
Foreign students participating in this
year's Sloan Program at the business school
are generally pleased with the program, but
indicated that opportunities for social in
teraction are limited and the workload is
very demanding.
The Sloan Program enables about 40
middle management executives per year
(ages 30-45) to earn a Master of Science in
Management from Stanford in nine months.
