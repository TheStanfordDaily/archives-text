# Entering students meet professors in seminars

Students who want a voice in
the educational process with re
gard to seminars for entering
students are urged to suggest fa
culty members they t hi nk would
provide a stimulating seminar
experience, according to
Dorothy Atkinson, member of
the Dean's Advisory Committee
on Seminars for Entering Stu
dents.
Any student may call Om
budsman John Goheen's office
and leave the names of these pro
fessors.
"We are doing this because we
want to make seminars as re
warding as possibleand we want
to offer direct contact with fa
culty members through the
program," Atkinson said.
The Advisory Committee
meets periodically to discuss
various topics within the semi
nar program for entering stu

dents â€” freshmen and transfers.
It proposes new ideas which are
in turn presented to the Dean ot
Undergraduate Studies.
Some seminars scheduled for
winter quarter are "The Meaning
of Black Death,'' "The Supreme
Court in the U. 5.," "The Chang
ing Pattern in Human Surgical
Disease" and"The World of
Henry Kissinger."
Seminars are designed to pro
vide an opportunity for students
to get to know faculty on a more
personal level and to get to know
peers in an environment of close

intellectual contact. Students
may exchange ideas in subjects
of their own personal interest,
according to Atkinson.
"We invite student input
about these seminars and new
faculty member instructors in
the program as we examine ways
to maintain scholarly excel
lence." Atkinson said.
Many faculty members who
are sympathetic to the cause may
feel pressed for time. Atkinson
said. Perhaps, these members
would respond to student
suggestions.
The committee will make ef
forts to reach suggested faculty
members in order that they
might be placed into the seminar
program in the future, according
to Atkinson.
The committee also hopes that
through this effort to encourage
student input, faculty participa
tion will also increase.
