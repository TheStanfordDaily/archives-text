## Poloists give Stanford 15th NCAA crown 
### 
"The reason our team is the national champ
ion is in the minds of the players and coach.
Each player is a goal-oriented person . . . and
we wanted a NCAA championship."
—Brian Avery, Stanford
water polo player
Looking at the starting lineup of the Card
varsity water polo team, it seems quite unlikely
that a group consisting of three sophomores,
two juniors and only two seniors could handle
teams like UCLA and UC-lrvine, who have
been in the national championships since they
were initiated in 1969.
But the 1976 Card poloists gave Stanford its
first NCAA water polo championship and its
15th in any sport.
Well, as UCLA coach Robert Horn said early
in the season referring to Stanford, "This is
quite a different polo team." Indeed, you will
find no one around the country who will argue
this point. The Cardinals compiled an astound
ing 20-2 record which included a 16-game
winning streak extending right through the fi
nals of the NCAAs, where they beat the
Bruins, 13-12, Sunday in Long Beach.
Stanford's improvement over last season
came with the improved play of goalie Chris
Dorst, whose strong defense in the goal
paced a stingy Stanford defense all season
long. The senior from Atherton was named
Most Valuable Player in the NCAA champ
ionships last weekend. His three penalty
blocks and countless steals coming out of the
net were illustrative of the performances he
displayed all season.
Head coach Art Lambert, along with other
opposing coaches, have had no reservations
in calling Dorst, "one of the best goalies in the
world."
Stanford's defense was complemented by
an equally potent offense, which was paced

by senior Drew McDonald
"Drew is one of the most powerful athletes
I've seen," said Lambert, "and he adds to that
effectively by being a real student of the
game."
McDonald gunned in four goals to lead the
Cards in their win m the finals and was named
to the All-Tournament team.
Of course, Lambert points out that the
Cards' effectiveness is due to their team play.
Rick Johannsen illustrated this with his vital
play in the hole, setting up scores for a contin
gent of what he called "the best drivers (to the
net) in the country" in Marty Davis, Tom
Angelo, Doug Burke and Robbie Arnold. Ar
nold also took All-Tournament team honors.
It is Johannsen's attitude that best sym
bolizes the success of the team. Each player
gives credit to another and this is significant in
their play.
The Cards work together to help one
another out both in and out of the water. Ac
cording to Horn, you seldom find this when
you have athletes of such high caliber.
Then there is Stanford coach Art Lambert.
Lambert has been on the Farm only three
years now and many people feel he has
started to build a dynasty in water polo.
This is nothing new to Lambert, who had led
De Anza Junior College to the small college
championship many times during his tenure
there, and who has coached the United States
Olympic Water Polo Team.
All of the credit for the NCAA championship,
the players agree, goes back to Lambert and
his style of coaching. Some call it over
serious, others dynamic. But all agree that it is
unique and effective - the very traits of the
team he coaches.

Well, as UCLA coach Robert Horn said early
in the season referring to Stanford, "This is
quite a different polo team." Indeed, you will
find no one around the country who will argue
this point. The Cardinals compiled an astound
ing 20-2 record which included a 16-game
winning streak extending right through the fi
nals of the NCAAs, where they beat the
Bruins, 13-12, Sunday in Long Beach.
Stanford's improvement over last season
came with the improved play of goalie Chris
Dorst, whose strong defense in the goal
paced a stingy Stanford defense all season
long. The senior from Atherton was named
Most Valuable Player in the NCAA champ
ionships last weekend. His three penalty
blocks and countless steals coming out of the
net were illustrative of the performances he
displayed all season.
Head coach Art Lambert, along with other
opposing coaches, have had no reservations
in calling Dorst, "one of the best goalies in the
world."
Stanford's defense was complemented by
an equally potent offense, which was paced

by senior Drew McDonald
"Drew is one of the most powerful athletes
I've seen," said Lambert, "and he adds to that
effectively by being a real student of the
game."
McDonald gunned in four goals to lead the
Cards in their win m the finals and was named
to the All-Tournament team.
Of course, Lambert points out that the
Cards' effectiveness is due to their team play.
Rick Johannsen illustrated this with his vital
play in the hole, setting up scores for a contin
gent of what he called "the best drivers (to the
net) in the country" in Marty Davis, Tom
Angelo, Doug Burke and Robbie Arnold. Ar
nold also took All-Tournament team honors.
It is Johannsen's attitude that best sym
bolizes the success of the team. Each player
gives credit to another and this is significant in
their play.
The Cards work together to help one
another out both in and out of the water. Ac
cording to Horn, you seldom find this when
you have athletes of such high caliber.
Then there is Stanford coach Art Lambert.
Lambert has been on the Farm only three
years now and many people feel he has
started to build a dynasty in water polo.
This is nothing new to Lambert, who had led
De Anza Junior College to the small college
championship many times during his tenure
there, and who has coached the United States
Olympic Water Polo Team.
All of the credit for the NCAA championship,
the players agree, goes back to Lambert and
his style of coaching. Some call it over
serious, others dynamic. But all agree that it is
unique and effective - the very traits of the
team he coaches.

Looking at the starting lineup of the Card
varsity water polo team, it seems quite unlikely
that a group consisting of three sophomores,
two juniors and only two seniors could handle
teams like UCLA and UC-lrvine, who have
been in the national championships since they
were initiated in 1969.
But the 1976 Card poloists gave Stanford its
first NCAA water polo championship and its
15th in any sport.
