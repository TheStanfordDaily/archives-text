It's Stanford versus USC in
basketball tonight on the Farm.
The Cards could wish they were
facing the University of South
ern California Trojans, who have
lost 15 consecutive basketball
contests. Instead, the University
of Santa Clara Broncos, who de
feated Chico State, 71-6. r „ Satur
day, will be on the springy
hardwood of Maples Pavilion.
Head coach Carroll Williams'
Santa Clara club has a much tal
ler front line than the Cards, an
advantage which will be in
creased by the loss of Card for
ward Ceorge Schader because of
a knee injury.
"They have a very physical
and aggressive front line," said
Stanford head coach Dick I)i-
Biaso. "The player who really
makes the team go is Eddie Joe
(:have/„ and the other guard, Roy
Taylor, complements him very
well.
"They'll have an advantage
over us in size and experience
this year." said Dißiaso.
"Freshman Kurt Rambis is the
only new player in their first six
or seven."
Got away
Rambis is a 6-foot-7 forward
from San lose whom the Cards
made <1 big effort to recruit last
year Santa Clara also succeeded
in landing I.ond.de I'heus from
Locke High in southern Califor
nia. The two freshmen are tab

Sports Information Director,
Dii k Degnon.

The two rookies, though, play
behind the Broncos' sixth man.
senior forward co-captain Steve
McCee (6-B, 210). McGee, whose
father played for the California
Bears in 1941, injured his back
last season and was in traction in
a hospital for a month.
In addition to their si/.e and
experience, the Broncos, accord
ing to Degnon, "are a good
shooting team." They must be —
they survived 21) turnovers
against Chico State.
Generous team
The Cards committed 25 tur
novers against Cctl Poly-San Luis
Obispo and were laced, 79-61.
"We have to pick ourselves up
and correct the mistakes we
made Saturday," Dißiaso said.
"We have to eliminate the tur
novers and regain our confi
dence. For some reason, we were
tight in the opener."
The Cards had trouble against
the Broncos last year, losing
70-07 in the inaugural game of
Santa Clara's Toso Pavilion.
Tight or whatever, the Cards
will he out to improve their out
side shooting tonight An ettort
of 4 I per cent from the field just
won't win that many games for
you.
A loss could send the Cards
reeling into San Iram isco for
their contest m hps! the USF
Hons Saturday night Standing
0-2 and facing one of the best
teams in the count i\ is a situa
tion Dißiaso would prefer to av
oid.
