# Home rule closer for Scots, Welsh
## 
### 
London — Bowing to growing
nationalist sentiment in Scotland and
Wales, the British government prop
osed a law yesterday providing a mea
sure of home rule for the two lands.
Nationalist sentiment is strongest in
Scotland, where the exploitation of
North Sea oil has spurred hopes the
country may one day he politically and
economically independent.
At a press conference coinciding
with publication of what is called the
Devolution Bill, the leader of the
House of Commons, Michael Foot,
stressed that it is aimed at preserving
the United Kingdom, made up of Eng
land, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
"If we didn't have devolution of this
nature, the chances of a breakup of the
United Kingdom would be much grea
ter," Foot said.
Passing on the power
The bill, which is expected to take
up about two-thirds of the year-long
session of Parliament that began last
Wednesday, "devolves" certain pow
ers to popularly elected regional as
semblies.
The assemblies, in Edinburgh and
Cardiff, would have legislative power
in such areas as education, local gov
ernment, culture, environment, in
dustrial development, agriculture and
housing.
They would have no revenue
raising powers, such as levying taxes.
And the bill makes no mention of the
vast reservoirs of oil off Scotland's
coasts. The London government main
tains North Sea oil is a national re
source to be shared by the nation as a
whole.
The bill falls far short of the com
plete independence wanted by the
Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP). The
SNP views North Sea oil as the thing
that could make an independent Scot

land financially viable.
It was the growing strength at the
SNP that prodded the Labor govern
ment of Prime Minister James Cal
lughan to give top priority to devolu
tion in this parliamentary session de
spite a host of economic problems also
calling for legislative action.
The Scottish Nationalists jumped
trom one seat in the 635-member
House of Commons in 1967 to 11 in the
last elections, in October 1974. Their
share of the popular vote in Scotland
went from less than one per cent in the
1950s to more than 30 per cent in the
last election.
The Labor government, which sur
vives on a razor-thin majority in the
House of Commons, fears that the SNP
— unless mollified — will make it im
possible to govern.
Support
But the Scottish Nationalists view
the Devolution Hill as merely a step on
the road to independence. They were
buoyed by a poll published Monday in
Glasgow's Daily Uncord indicating
that 44 per cent of its readers want
independence, while 15 per cent favor
the status quo and 40 per cent want an
assembly such as that proposed.
In Wales, there is strong nationalist
sentiment but no widespread demand
for total independence. The Welsh
nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, has
three seats in the House of Commons.
But the party general secretary, IJafydd
Williams, said the bill discriminates
against Wales by allowing a wider
range of powers devolved to Scotland.
The government does not have the
support of all Labor members of the
House on the issue. Seventy-six Labor
MPs have called for a referendum.
The opposition Conservative party
says it favors devolution in principle.
