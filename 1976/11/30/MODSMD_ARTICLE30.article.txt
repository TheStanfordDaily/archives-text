# McCrea makes coaching debut
## 
### David Georgette 
The sports staff of the Daily
heralded Stanford varsity bas
ketball coach Dick Di√üiaso's lirst
season last year as the "New
Era." Tonight at 5:15 in Maples
Pavilion, the next "New Era" in
Stanford basketball opens when
first-year head coach Dotty
McCrea, 25, leads her charges
against the Santa Clara Bronco. 1 !.
McCrea's new job should be
made a lot easier with the return
of five letter-winners, including
junior center Maggie Nelson,
who McCrea calls "probably one
of the better centers in Califor
nia."
Sophomore forwa rd
Stephanie Galef, "a real hard
worker who hustles all over the
place," according to McCrea.-is
another veteran who had been
counted on to carry a big load tor
the Cards. However. Galef coujd
miss the next three to tour weeks
because of mononucleosis.
The Cards have plenty ot
backcourt experience with three
veterans, Nancy LovvolfL
Stumpy O'Meara and l'egg\
Bruggman all returning.
Cohurn gone
Last season Gav Coburn di
rected the Cards to an 1 l-.'t rv
cord. Coburn finished her Ph.D.
studies, though, and did not re
turn this ve.tr.
Met Irea came to the Farm frojw
Rutgers, where last year in her
first season as head coach, the
team finished 6-6. "The Stanford
job was a full-time job and I
wanted to get out of New Jersey,"
said McCrea in explaining her
exodus to California.
Man-to-man
Her program stresses fast
paced. aggressive basketball.
"YVe play man-to-man defense

80 per cent of the time unless it is
absolutely necessary to go to a
zone," said McCrea.
McCrea hopes to have the
Cards fast-breaking on offense.
When the Cards run up against a
zone, McCrea said, "We'll try to
get the ball inside the zone for
the high-percentage shot."
The new coach is unsure of the
opposition the Cards will be fac

ing. "All this is new to me," she
said. "I don't know that much
about it, but I think there are
more good teams in the East."
Inexperience
California high schools, ac
cording to McCrea, have yet to
develop programs to yield
enough players of the caliber
found in the East.
She knows what eastern bas
ketball is. Before going to Rut
gers. the 1973 Monmouth Col
lege graduate was an assistant
coach at Immaculata College.

Immaculata won the Association
of Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW) basketball
championship three consecutive
years before Delta State knocked
them off in McCrea's last year
there.
In addition to coaching ex
perience, McCrea lias also been
around as a player. In 1972, she
played on an Amateur Athletic
Union (AAI1) team which toured
South America. In 1974, she
played professionally for a team
in Monaco.
