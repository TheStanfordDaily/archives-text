# Soccer program rolling under new coach Lodge
## 
### Dean Eyre 
In reviewing the Stanford soc
cer season, coach Nelson Lodge
emphasized that his players
gave him a "pleasant surprise"
with their progress since Sep
tember.
The young and comparatively
inexperienced team was pre
dicted to win five games, accord
ing to Lodge, but gave him
"more than expected," with a
9-9-2 final record.
The Cards actually competed
better than their record would
indicate, with Lodge explaining
that he was "really impressed"
with "the most coachable bunch
I have ever had."
The two big games of the sea

son were a 4-4 tie with last
year's national champs, USF,
and a 4-3 come-from-behi nd
overt i me victory over California.
Lodge said that this team was
"one of the few teams able to win
so many games in the second
half and overtime." He elabo
rated, stating that "it seemed as
if they would aspire to being
down 1-0 and come back to
win."
Some of the comeback vic
tories included games against
Cal, UC-Davis and UOF. Admit
ting that he has never coached in
such constant comeback situa
tions, Lodge was extremely
pleased with the Cal game, in
which the Cards overcame a 3-1

deficit to win 4-3.
Against Davis, Stanford was
behind 1-0 when the team
switched formations with 20
minutes to play, and ended up
winning 2-1.
UOP was in a 1-1 tie with the
Cards at the end of regular play.
Playing true to form, the Cards
exploded in overtime to gain a
5-1 triumph.
Describing his respect for the
Stanford athlete. Lodge said that
the team "was very receptive to
what I had to say to them during
halftimes." He would "say what
they had to do to win," and they
would perform.
In the game against USF,
Lodge gave the team a pep talk,
saying that "the team that wants
to win is the team that will win."
The Cards scored on USF, going
ahead 4-3, and then went step for
step with the Dons until they
tied the game at four goals each.
The two strengths of the team
were defense and scoring, with
game strategy designed to stress
these abilities. Bob Ceiger, the
main offensive weapon, was
heavily depended upon to come
up with goals, and in a great
many of the situations, he came
through.

ahead 4-3, and then went step for
step with the Dons until they
tied the game at four goals each.
The two strengths of the team
were defense and scoring, with
game strategy designed to stress
these abilities. Bob Ceiger, the
main offensive weapon, was
heavily depended upon to come
up with goals, and in a great
many of the situations, he came
through.

USF earlier this year.
In reviewing the Stanford soc
cer season, coach Nelson Lodge
emphasized that his players
gave him a "pleasant surprise"
with their progress since Sep
tember.
The young and comparatively
inexperienced team was pre
dicted to win five games, accord
ing to Lodge, but gave him
"more than expected," with a
9-9-2 final record.
The Cards actually competed
better than their record would
indicate, with Lodge explaining
that he was "really impressed"
with "the most coachable bunch
I have ever had."
The two big games of the sea

son were a 4-4 tie with last
year's national champs, USF,
and a 4-3 come-from-behi nd
overt i me victory over California.
Lodge said that this team was
"one of the few teams able to win
so many games in the second
half and overtime." He elabo
rated, stating that "it seemed as
if they would aspire to being
down 1-0 and come back to
win."
Some of the comeback vic
tories included games against
Cal, UC-Davis and UOF. Admit
ting that he has never coached in
such constant comeback situa
tions, Lodge was extremely
pleased with the Cal game, in
which the Cards overcame a 3-1

deficit to win 4-3.
Against Davis, Stanford was
behind 1-0 when the team
switched formations with 20
minutes to play, and ended up
winning 2-1.
UOP was in a 1-1 tie with the
Cards at the end of regular play.
Playing true to form, the Cards
exploded in overtime to gain a
5-1 triumph.
Describing his respect for the
Stanford athlete. Lodge said that
the team "was very receptive to
what I had to say to them during
halftimes." He would "say what
they had to do to win," and they
would perform.
In the game against USF,
Lodge gave the team a pep talk,
saying that "the team that wants
to win is the team that will win."
The Cards scored on USF, going
ahead 4-3, and then went step for
step with the Dons until they
tied the game at four goals each.
