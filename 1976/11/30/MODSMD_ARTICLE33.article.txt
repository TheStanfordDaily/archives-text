## 
### 
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team finished tied for
fifth in the eight-team West
ern Regionals at UC-Davis
Friday.
USC, the top seed, took first
place and was followed, in
order, by UCLA, Pepperdine,
Cal State-Northridge, Stan
ford, UC-Santa Barbara and
San Jose State.
Stanford lost to UCLA,
15-10, 15-0; defeated rival
San Jose State, 13-15, 15-13,
15-11; and lost to Nortbridge,
15-7, 15-13, in the double
elimination tournament.
In the Spartan match, the
Cards were behind 11-B in the
deciding game, but scored
nine consecutive points to
put the contest away.
"Getting to play San Jose
State was a real plus," said
Stanford head coach Bruce
Downing. "The more we get
that kind of competition, the
better we'll get."
Downing said he was "bas
ically pleased" with his
team's effort, but f "lt £t&r.fuid
could have beaten Northridge
and finished one notch
higner in the standings. I la
added that defeating one of
the other Los Angeles teams
would been something
else again for Stanford, at
least this year. The Cards, in
their firs* official year, are
volleyball novices compared

to schools like USC and
UCLA.
"As far as beating an L.A.
team." Downing said, "it's
available, but it'll take more
experience. I think it will
happen next year.
"The L.A. teams have a cer
tain aura about them. Every
body's a little afraid of them.
"We need to know we can
beat one of those L.A. teams.
We keep getting better
against them."
Downing juggl his
lineup somewhat in the tour
nament, and discovered an
appealing combination.
"Throughout the season,"
Downing said, "we lacked
aggressiveness and com
petitive attitude We wc uld
play with intensity sporadi
cally. But the final team w >
used against San lose State
and Nortbridge was very ag
gressive and enthus'Hstic !t
p!:.yed better than any roix
ture we've used so far."
Downing said Stanford's
key players in the regionals
were Lane Harris, Shawn
Hoover and J.me Bassett I iar

I 'CLA and was o - vised to sil
out the rest of the tourname M '
She chose to continue play

The Stanford women's vol
leyball team finished tied for
fifth in the eight-team West
ern Regionals at UC-Davis
Friday.
USC, the top seed, took first
place and was followed, in
order, by UCLA, Pepperdine,
Cal State-Northridge, Stan
ford, UC-Santa Barbara and
San Jose State.
Stanford lost to UCLA,
15-10, 15-0; defeated rival
San Jose State, 13-15, 15-13,
15-11; and lost to Nortbridge,
15-7, 15-13, in the double
elimination tournament.
In the Spartan match, the
Cards were behind 11-B in the
deciding game, but scored
nine consecutive points to
put the contest away.
"Getting to play San Jose
State was a real plus," said
Stanford head coach Bruce
Downing. "The more we get
that kind of competition, the
better we'll get."
Downing said he was "bas
ically pleased" with his
team's effort, but f "lt £t&r.fuid
could have beaten Northridge
and finished one notch
higner in the standings. I la
added that defeating one of
the other Los Angeles teams
would been something
else again for Stanford, at
least this year. The Cards, in
their firs* official year, are
volleyball novices compared

to schools like USC and
UCLA.
"As far as beating an L.A.
team." Downing said, "it's
available, but it'll take more
experience. I think it will
happen next year.
"The L.A. teams have a cer
tain aura about them. Every
body's a little afraid of them.
"We need to know we can
beat one of those L.A. teams.
We keep getting better
against them."
Downing juggl his
lineup somewhat in the tour
nament, and discovered an
appealing combination.
"Throughout the season,"
Downing said, "we lacked
aggressiveness and com
petitive attitude We wc uld
play with intensity sporadi
cally. But the final team w >
used against San lose State
and Nortbridge was very ag
gressive and enthus'Hstic !t
p!:.yed better than any roix
