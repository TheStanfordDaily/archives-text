West European leaders want summit
The Hague — Western Europe's top political leaders
said yesterday they want new summit-level contacts with
the United States, Japan and Canada in view of the pend
ing change of administration in Washington.
"Especially in view of the new administration, discus
sions should take place in the foreseeable future between
the United States, Japanand Canada," Dutch Prime Minis
ter Joop den I Jyl announced at the end of a two-day sum
mit of the nine Common Market nations.
Den Uyl is chairman of the European Council, made up
of the government leaders of the nine countries. The
council meets three times a year.
The most pressing subject of a North Atlantic-Japanese
summit would be economics. The European summit was
called to deal with economic difficulties, but the particip
ants said they could not make decisions until they know
President-elect Jimmy Carter's economic plans.
The industrial West is waiting tensely to see whether
oil-exporting countries raise oil prices Jan. 1 and, if so, by
how much. The industrialized countries also are being
pressed to make trade and debt concessions to poor coun
tries. Most West European countries suffer heavy inflation
and unemployment themselves and several have danger
ously weak currencies.
The Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries has
scheduled price talks Dec. 15 and the so-called North-
South Dialogue between industrialized and poor coun
tries is to resume the same day in Paris. There are uncon
firmed reports that either or both will be postponed.
Officials favor drug decriminalization
Denver — Strong support has emerged from the nation's
biggest group of municipal officials to decriminalize all
drugs, including heroin, as part of a vigorous attack on the
street terror that illicit drug trafficking brings to America's
cities.
Decriminalization, the removal of criminal penalties for
possession and use of narcotics, was endorsed this week
by the key committees on policy and resolutions of the
National League of Cities. The proposal goes to the
league's 3000-member Congress of Cities today.
The league consists of mayors and other elected city
officials. Its annual meeting ends today, with the expected
election of the 52-year-old league's first woman president,
Seattle council member Phyllis Lamphere.
Lamphere chaired the Resolutions Committee session
in which drug decriminalization was approved without
dissent.
Richard Hatcher of Gary, Ind., who shepherded the
proposal through the committees said city officials are
more and more frustrated with law enforcement efforts to
curb drug traffic. He added, "The increase in drug-related
crime and drug-related deaths are an insufferable burden
oil urban economies."
If the congress approves the resolution, decriminaliza
tion would become official league policy. League staff
members in Washington could lobby for federal laws im
plementing the policy.
The resolution reads: "Whenever feasible, alcohol and
drug abuse should be decriminalized and handled as a
behavioral health problem, as long as persons are held
fully accountable for any deviant or criminal actions

while under the influence of these substances."
Burglars use generator in bank heist
Miian, Italy — Burglars who stole an estimated $5 mill
ion to $6 million in gold, jewels and money from safe
deposit boxes at a Milan bank had their own generator to
provide lighting and to power electric drills, police said
yesterday.
' The underworld is increasingly resorting to
technologically advanced equipment against which tradi
*ional anti-theft devices are useless," said Police Chief
Umberto Tagnozzi.
The burglars, believed to number between six and 10,
broke m»o the Lombardy Province Savings Bank over the
weekend and looted about 450 safe deposit boxes. Bank
officials estimated the value at $5 million to $6 million.
Police said they got through the bank's outer doors,
possibly with duplicate keys, then used blow torches and
drills to get into the armored room. A generator was
among tilings left at the site.
Two similarly audsoous raids were made on safe de
posit vaults of branches of a French bank last summer in
Nice and Paris. What h .s beer dubDcd the "sewer gang"
made its way thrcugh the sewers of Nice in rafts in mid-
July and tunneled into the vault, then spent a weekend
rifling an estimated $8 million to $10 million worth of
cash and valuables.
A month latt-r, a gang used the same technique to take
about $'• million Irom sale deposit boxes at the -ociete
Geoerale branch on the lie St. Louis in Paris.
Economic index down for third month
VVasmngtoa — The government index designed to pre
dict the future course of the economy will be down for the
third consecutive month, possibly oy five-tenths of one
per cent, a government analyst said yesterday.
Many economists say that three straight months of de
cline in the compo-'te ; ndp v of leading indicators points
to a;j e : r.jmic slow-down. The index fell seven-tenths of
one per cent in both August and September.
The latest disappointing statistic was the job lay-off rate
in the nation's factories, which rose in October for the
third straight month. The Labor Department said yester
day that manufacturers laid off 1.7 workers per 100
employes in October, up from 1.5 in September and 1.3 in
August.
The Commerce Department is scheduled to release the
October index today, a day behind schedule.
Marines protect six KKK members
Camp Pendleton — The Marine Corps said yesterday it
is protecting six leathernecks (marines) who are members
of the ku Klux klan (KKK) from possible attacks by armed
black marines.
A base spokesman said that four white marines were put
in the brig for their own protection the night of Nov. 13
and that a fifth joined the group Nov.'ls. A day later, a
sixth marine asked for protective custody.
Maj. Gen. Carl Hoffman, commanding general of the
giant base, confirmed on Monday a claim by the KKK in
Louisiana that the marines belong to the white-supremacy
group. As a result of "the existence of the KKK," several of
the whites are being transferred to other bases, Hoffman
said in a statement.

The San Diego Tribune reported that two of the sus
pected KKK members already have been discharged from
the marines, one of them as an undesirable.
Clarence Pendleton Jr., executive director of the San
Diego Urban League said the group of black marines, now
held on assault and conspiracy charges, apparently made
a commando-style attack on what they thought was a Klan
meeting.
A total of 14 black marines have been taken into cus
tody, the latest Monday night. Eight of them have been
charged, with the decision still pending on whether they
face courts-martial trials.
House Democratic freshmen to meet
Washington — The newly elected House Democratic
freshmen meet tomorrow to organize but they say they
have no advance plans to dump committee chairmen the
way freshmen did two years ago.
"I have not heard of anyone talking about overthrowing
any chairman," said Congressman-elect Jim Mattox of
Texas. "Those things are all possibilities but this group is
certainly not large enough to take much action by itself."
Mattox was one of seven congressmen-elect who sent
messages to their 40 fellow Democratic freshmen setting
up the meeting late Thursday afternoon for a decision
whether to organize.
Mattox and two other of the initial leaders emphasized
that they don't ev.nknow whether the freshmen will want
to organize, much less what they would decide to do as a
freshman clasi,
"Just as a practical matter it's silly to be presumptuous
and tnink before we've seen what the situation is that
we're goi::.; to throw out some chairmen," said Jim Guy
Tucker of Arkansas.
But they all said they personally hope the newly elected
congressmen can influence some reforms to correct Con
gress' bad public image.
Yoshimura refuses to name cohorts
Garland — Wendy Yoshimura used a string of phony
identities and hid with "some of the most wanted fugi
tives in the land" because she feared the police would kill
her, her attorney said Monday in his opening statement at
her weapons trial.
James Larson told the eight-woman, four-man jury that

the 33-year-old defendant is "sincerely grateful" to those
who aided her in her 3V2-year life on the run and that she
would refuse to implicate them at her trial.
Prosecutor Jeff Horner called as his first witness former
Berkeley police inspector Michael O'Keefe, who began a
methodical and painstaking identification of three large
cartloads of items removed from the garage.
Contents of the carts included weapons and pipes and
chemicals that could be used in the construction of bombs.
Larson said Yoshimura would not follow in the path of
her one-time fugitive companion Patricia Hearst. At her
federal bank robbery trial last spring, Hearst named
Yoshimura and more than a dozen others who helped her
elude arrest. Yoshimura and Hearst were captured to
gether in September 1975.
Larson said Yoshimura's generation has "a strong tradi
tion against stool pigeons" and his client "will refuse to
give the names of anyone who helped her or who is not
connected with the charges in this trial.
"It would be morally indefensible and physically
dangerous, if she should be sent to prison, to name these
individuals," he said.
Dole calls for Republican comeback
Washington — Former vice presidential nominee Bob
Dole warned Republican governors yesterday that the
party should begin its comeback before it is too late and
suggested that a first step might be for Republican con
gressmen to sponsor a tax cut bill in January.
The Republican Governors Association then closed its
winter conference by voting support of the party platform,
but only after several governors said they wouldn't want
to be bound to it too literally.
Talking to reporters after his speech. Dole said congres
sional Republicans are likely to introduce their own tax
bill early in the session.
"I think the Republicans may suggest a tax cut come
January because we campaigned on that premise," Dole
said.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with increasing hazy vis
ibilities. Cool nights with local frost likely in colder areas.
Lows in the 30s to mid 40s. Highs in the upper 50s to mid
60s. Light winds.
