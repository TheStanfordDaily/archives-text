# Hoover to hold conference
## Are the rich discriminated against? 
### Marc Strassman 
Income redistribution within American society is the
subject of an extensive and intensive research effort at the
Hoover Institution and will be the subject of a two-day
conference sponsored by the Institution in January 1977,
according to Thomas Moore, a senior fellow at Hoover and
director of the Domestic Studies Program.
Moore outlined current research projects and gave a
historical overview of the domestic studies program yes
terday at a meeting in the basement of Hoover Tower
attended by 35 researchers and Institution staff.
"Our Income Redistribution Study Group is exploring
in a systematic and I think unbiased way the question of
income redistribution," said Moore, an economist with a
Ph.D. from the University of Chicago.
He said the study was focusing on the degree to which
published figures on income maldistribution were statis
tical artifacts created by ignoring the fact that individuals
earn different amounts at different stages of their careers.
The existing pattern of income distribution, he said, is
not necessarily bad nor does it necessarily need to be
remedied by redistribution.
In addition to studying current patterns of income dis
tribution, said Moore, the study group is also investigat

ing public policy issues related to "in-kind transfers" of
wealth, such as food stamps, Medicare and housing. He
said that if government payments to individuals in New
York City were counted as income, there would be (at least
statistically) a virtual elimination of poverty in New York
City.
A third area being covered by the income redistribution
studies, deals with "the responsiveness of the rich to
taxes," specifically, the question of what happens to moti
vation with high taxes on higher incomes, said Moore.
Moore referred to a proposal by Milton Friedman, Nobel
Laureate in economics and a recently-appointed Senior
Fellow at the Institution, that the highest income tax rates
should be lowered to 25 per cent in order to give those
with high incomes more incentive to work harder.
The Domestic Studies group is also conducting
econometric studies of crime and the criminal justice sys
tem. One preliminary hypothesis emerging from a study
of rape is that "by increasing prison sentences and impos
ing the death penalty, the rape rate is decreased," said
Moore.
Another study being conducted by the group deals with
the relationship between crime rates and residential prop
erty values on the Peninsula. "When crime rates go up,"
said Moore, "property values go down."
