# Debate over DNA research heats up in some places, but Palo Alto plays it cool
## 
### Marc Strassman 
The national controversy over recombinant
DNA research focuses upon the risk of possible
massive biological contamination should new
kinds of bacteria and viruses escape into the
population. This controversy is being dealt with
in disparate ways in two university com
munities.
The city of Palo Alto has shown no inclination
to interfere in DNA research conducted here.
Recombinant DNA research involves the crea
tion of original biological entities by implanting
genetic material from the nuclei of one kind of
cell into the nuclei of another kind of cell.
In Cambridge. Massachusetts, however,
community concern over possible danger from
this type of research was so strong that the Cam
bridge city council approved a three-month
moratorium in July and another in October on
Harvard University's plans to construct a new
building for recombinant DNA research experi
ments.
The Cambridge moritorium was first imposed
after the city council held hearings attended by
"hundreds of people" in a sweltering heat that
was reminiscent of the Scopes "monkey trial,"
according to Pat Centanni, administrative assis
tant to Cambridge Mayor Alfred Velluci.
Centanni stressed Velluci's concern about the
possible danger to area residents from biological
contamination, comparing it to the "Legion
naire's Disease" in Philadelphia this summer.
"Look at the Legionnaire's Disease, which was
invisible, but just look at what it did to the
people in Philadelphia," he said.
Centanni said "nothing is more important (to
a city government) than the health and welfare
of the community."
Not Palo Alto's business
Massive expressions of concern have not
materialized around the Stanford community,
and the city of Palo Alto does not appear to be
taking any steps to limit genetic experiments on
the Farm.
Naphtali Knox, Palo Altodirector of planning,
said that "it has not been our policy to become
involved in administrative, academic or re
search matters at Stanford. That's Stanford's
business, not ours Our concern is only in areas
that can visibly impact Palo Alto, such .is land

use and traffic."
Knox added that the city has only limited
jurisdiction over university research sites. "Ex
cept for Hoover Pavilion or the Medical Center,
we don't have jurisdiction anyway."
Knox is a member of the Stanford-Palo Alto
Liaison Committee, a group consisting of Palo
Alto's city manager, assistant city manager, di
rector of planning, university vice presidents
Robert Augsberger (business and finance) and
Robert Rosenzweig (university relations) and
the director of facilities and construction.
The committee, according to Knox, meets
quarterly to discuss subjects of "mutual in
terest" to the university and the city.
Although the liaison committee has com
municated to the city council the substance of
Rosenzweig's remarks at a July 8 meeting this
year that the university had been carrying on
recombi nant DNA research for "some number of
years, the city council has not indicated any
desire to agendize the issue," said Knox.
Some scientists have expressed concern that
certain I)NA experiments might produce new
and deadly strains of bacteria which humans
would be unable to combat.
Reasons
Biology Prof. Allan Campbell, chairman of the
newly appointed Administration Committee on
DNA, pointed out some positive reasons for
conducting recombinant DNA research. "The
most clear-cut benefits one can see are in terms
of basic biological research. It enables us to learn
a lot about the organization of a cell."
He said he does not rule out the possibility
that some newly-created bacteria might be ex
ceptionally hazardous. "The idea that recom
binant DNA will be more virulent than its con
stituent elements is possible," he said. "It's con
ceivable, one can imagine it."
However. Campbell said. "The precautions
are all designed against these imagined situa
tions where there could be some (of these dan
gers)."
The 12-member committee, appointed this
September by Pres. Richard Lyman, is responsi
ble for seeing that all recombinant DNA research
here is conducted under containment proce
dures set forth in the Guidelines for Genetic Re
search published by the National Institutes of

Health (NIH) during the same month.
Paul Berg, professor of biochemistry and a
member of the committee said last night that it
was "ludicrous to draw comparisons" between
the situation in Cambridge and the situation
here.
He said that the confrontation in Cambridge
occurred before the issuance of the NIH
guidelines and that there was an "edgy political
situation" there that could not he compared with
conditions here.
Berg said that he "strongly supports" the con
tinuation of recombinant DNA research if con
ducted in compliance with the NIH guidelines
which he thinks provide adequate protection
against the risk of contamination.
Differing opinions
One of the most interesting findings to emerge
from the hearings held before the Cambridge
city council was that the scientific community,
including "distinguished scientists with Nobel
prizes." was split on the question of whether the
genetic experiments were dangerous, said Cen
tanni.
"Some of them said it was harmless, that there
was no real problem," reported Centanni.
"Others said that it was the most dangerous kind
of experiment possible."
The 12-member university panel on I)NA here
consists of three scientists involved in recom
binant DNA research, three scientists know
ledgeable about it but not heavily involved in
t lie field, an engi neer knowledgeable in the field
of containment, two faculty members from
humanities and law, one staff member, a promi
nent civic or business person and a student.
According to both Campbell and Pat Devaney,
an assistant to Vice provost for Research William
Massy, the panel has not considered for ap
proval any new projects but has limited itself to
discussing experiments already in progress.
"Our first responsibility is for getting on
going projects approved." said Devaney.
One member of the panel. Law Prof. John Kap
lan.said that concern about virulent and lethal
strains of DNA being produced in experiments is
"legitimate" forany community. "I live hereand
(I'll be) damned if I want anything unfortunate to
happen."
