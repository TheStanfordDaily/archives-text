## Opinions Is judgment deformed? 
### 
Eric Noji

After having read the opinion sec
tion of this paper daily for the past
couple of years, I have come to the
conclusion that the best formula for
transforming otherwise cultured and
intelligent human beings into crea
tures of primal emotions — hysteria,
bigotry and blind rage — is the intro
duction of certain controversial sub
jects.
The effect is often explosive and al
most always ugly. Is there anything
beautiful about the sight of otherwise
consistently suave people (and in re
trospect, of oneself) losing composure
at the drop of a name whether it be the
name of a mouthwash, a car, a political
party, a religious sect?
A few months ago, a certain brand of
mouthwash blatantly announced that
"even your best friend won't tell you,"
leaving one with a strangely helpless
feeling. If such a warning did not
motivate one to immediately invest in
a bottle of the preventive liquid (or so
cial lifesaver), it did at least serve to
remind one that bad breath, like cer
tain "brands" of literature, religion
and politics, is socially unacceptable
and therefore grossly forbidden.
Almost as primative
Today we are still almost as primi
tive in our reactions to the controver
sial taboos as we were in the "good old
days." A few weeks ago I was sitting in
the library looking at a copy of Time
with a portrait of Jimmy Carter on the
cover. The affable, soft-spoken person
sitting next to me, with whom I had
already had a relaxed conversation,
began to sputter surprisingly abusive
language about "that smug, offensive,
repugnant smile" on Carter's face.
Many years ago, the name of FDR
was enough to cause good friends to
argue, to abuse, to part. People either
despised or worshiped him; no one
was rational about him. No matter the
era, in political controversy one fea
ture seems salient: the stronger the
politician, the more violent (and con
sequently, the more irrational) are the
feelings he evokes in his followers and
detractors.
What kind of spell did Hitler and
others like him cast over others? What
prompts sane and reasonable people to
take leave of their senses and sen

sibilities at the mere words and antics
of a single man? Without this mystify
ing quality, how could such fiery
eyed, hysterical men instill hope,
pride and faith, loyalty and terror in
intelligent people?
Equally mystifying
But the other side of the coin is
equally mystifying. What, in essence,
is the leadership that emanated from
the kindness, gentleness and infinite
compassion of such leaders as Soc
rates, Christ, Buddha and Gandhi?
Their appeal was the antithesis of vio
lence; it was a love of humanity so
profound that it was contagious.
Such was their appeal that
thousands died for the sake of love a nd
set of ethics they believed to be the
truth. But neither love nor truth could
have been clear enough to the martyrs
to cause them to die courageously or,
evey happily. What, then, inspired
them to the ultimate in human sac
rifice? Were they under the same kind
of mysterious spell of their kindly
leaders as were the followers of the
Hitlers, the Napoleons of this world?
The ugly thought that all leaders,
evil or saintly, share some special
qualities is disturbing, to say the least.
In the face of such mesmerism, Soc
rates' famous dictum "Know thyself!"
rings slightly hollow and cynical. How
can anyone know what seems almost
unknowable? With so many unknowns
about human behavioral responses
and ethics, is it any wonder that living
maniacs sometimes generate such
complex, paradoxical emotions in us?
Deformed
The main point of these musings is
that much of what we grace with the
term "judgment" is no judgment at all
but a deformed creature, born of fear
and uncertainty. It arises from the vis
cera rather than from our allegedly
superior brain.
What else could explain intelligent
men worshipping statues and icons as
if they were alive and responsive? Like
marionettes, we have saluted the flag
and placed flowers and burned can
dles on graves or images of the dead.
As group animals, we are constantly
concerned about our own position in
the social hierarchy. Thus, we have to
be better thah others, lest we feel

threatened. We witness here a kind of
pecking order thai is no more refined
(perhaps a good deal more gross and
repulsive) than that of other animal
societies.
The one gleam of hope in all this is
that possibly never before in man's his
tory have so many traditions, the bases
of culture, been challenged. Such chal
lenge may well be a healthy trend and
a boost to our cultural behavior. Out of
the violence and turmoil of the 1960s a
more flexible culture has certainly
emerged, better adapted to today's and
tomorrow's world.
Though changes wrought through
violence can never be condoned, a
seeming paradox arises here. Violent
revolutions may not be in accord with
"civilized" humane, intellectual stan
dards of life, but oddly enough, regard
less of initial motives, something of
value often emerges from the chaos
they create.
