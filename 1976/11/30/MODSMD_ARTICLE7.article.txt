'Commendation'
I commend Don Barton {Daily. Nov.
30) for his quick-minded, incisive and
sometimes pointed look at the political
backbiting involved in the unhappy
demise of this year's bonfire. This trad
ition is a mainstay of the spirited sys
tem by which we define our relation
ship to past generations of Stanford
students; it is through the bonfire that
we established a link with our past,
without achieving the "snobbish repu
tation" of the Ivy League colleges.
I agree wholeheartedly that it would
be a pity for the bonfire to follow the
path of our onetime free and fearsome
mascot, and I remind certain elements
in our administration that if we had no
native Americans on campus we
would eliminate the immediate oppos
ition to our Proud Warrior's return.
1 am further appalled by the opposi
tion from inside the fraternity system
itself. Theta Xi and SAE should be se
verely reprimanded for attempting to
undermine an organization of univer
sity brotherhood founded on the pre
cepts of self-determinism that have
made our country strong.
These dissenting houses are com
posed of societal hedonists who have
no sense of brotherhood or what it is
like to give up personal freedoms for a
greater good. These people should be
forced to leave the system, or, better
yet, Uig Game spirit would be further
enhanced by switching the site of the
bonfire from Lake Lag to the living
room of Theta Xi!
This raises the most serious point —
the lack of spirit involved in this year's
Dig Game. Football has great impor
tance to us in that it is the way our
school is represented to the nation
—the way we show our mettle against
schools of lesser virtue — and because
it is the most important game of the
year, Hig Game is the game with the
need for one thousand per cent sup
port.
It is the Inter-Fraternity Gouncil's
(ll'G) appointed duty to raise and di
rect this support. Spirit becomes the
main function of the fraternities on
campus, and if student spirit would be
significantly enhanced by burning
Jews the IFG's only question should be
"how hot?"
It has to be this way, in order to pre
serve our historical personality and
the sanctity of the fraternity system.

Death penalty
The death penalty has been advo
cated for people who kill during the

commission of a crime and for those
who kill prison guards. While this
satisfies societies' need for revenge,
and rids the society of undesirables, it
is untenable.
We would certainly not want to say
that the person who kills another per
son, is in a "normal," "acceptable"
frame of mind when he does so.
Otherwise, it would be normal and ac
ceptable to go about killing people. In
fact, the killer is decidedly psycholog
ically abnormal.
This in itself is no crime, however
the killer has adapted to his
psychological abnormality in such a
way as to relieve other people of their

rights. For this reason, the killer be
comes thevictim of socially acceptable
murder.
This conclusion leads to a contradic
tion, for there are others in our society
who adapt to their psychological un
iqueness in ways deemed unaccepta
ble to society at large, because their
behavior is such that, it deprives other
people of their rights. These people are
in insane asylums. By the logic with
which this society now murders crim
inals, it should also murder all insane
people.
