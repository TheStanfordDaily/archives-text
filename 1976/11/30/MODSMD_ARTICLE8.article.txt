# Bonfire harms lake with potash, chips
##

Carlsmith, Cullenward

In early November, SAE and Theta
Xi fraternities voted against support of
the Big Game Bonfire. For the record,
and in response to charges of non
cooperation, we feel it is necessary to
state unequivocally our reasons for
doing so.
It became evident, after speaking
with several professors of botany, that
the fire has been doing significant
damage to Lake Lagunita. Specifically,
it leaves a large residue of potassium
rich potash, the ions of which promote
the growth of fresh water plants.
Although it appears impossible to
arrive at a quantitative measure of the
ash's contribution to the growth of
weeds and algae in the lake, that the
growth is fast and bountiful can be
readily verified by any springtime user
of Lagunita.
An additional, if lesser effect of the
fire exhibits itself when the wood
chips and ash float to the surface and
litter the shoreline.
The traditional method of meeting
these two problems has been to turn
over the earth of the lakebed by
bulldozing after the fire. It is not clear,
however, that this is an effective
method because the crucial ionization
process which turns the ashes into fer
tilizer can also take place when the
water permeates the lakebed.
Quite aside from that uncertainty,
turning over the same soil several
times serves only to expose the previ
ous year's ash

Our enjoyment of the spirit and
unity that the bonfire symbolizes and
promotes had to be weighed against
the drawbacks. For, disregarding for
the moment the air pollution as
sociated with the fire, all the damage is
confined to the lake itself and is en
countered only by the lake's users.
Disregarding also the allegation that
the fire is a symbol of unnecessary and
wasteful opulence, it appears that the
price of the bonfire's yearly splendor is
a slowly choking Lake Lagunita.
The bonfire is financed through
dues to the Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC), whose constitution demands
expulsion of any fraternity that does
not pay in full. That constitution says
nothing about a member's obligation
to provide labor for an IFC project as
well; such a donation is purely volun
tary. â€¢
We held the integrity of the IFC to be
important enough to overide our ob
jections to the bonfire, and paid our
dues in the full knowledged that much
of it would go to bonfire expenses. We
could not, however, in good consci
ence, ask our members to work on such
an ecologically destructive project and
still remain consistent with our vote of
non-support.
This letter should serve to resolve
any ambiguity in our position.
