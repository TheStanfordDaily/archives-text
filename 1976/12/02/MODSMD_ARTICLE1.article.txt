# State bill requires 'sexuality education' for Med curriculum
## 
### Bill Snyder 
A bill which requires physicians
and surgeons here to receive adequate
instruction in human sexuality is
"superfluous," said Medical School
Dean Clayton Rich.
"I doubt that any medical school is
not providing information on human
sexuality," he said Tuesday.
The bill, AB 4179, introduced by As
semblymen John Vasconcellos and
Herschel Rosenthal, was signed into
law by Gov. Brown this September.
Rich criticized the bill as an attempt
by the legislature to regulate the cur
riculum of medical schools. "1 do
think that it is not desirable that cur
ricula requirements be established by
the legislature by law," he said.
According to Vasconcellos, the bill
was written in response to assembly
hearings on whether doctors should be

licensed in the area of human sexual
ity.
The general impression of the hear
ings, said Vasconcellos, was that doc
tors who were licensed in other areas
were not sufficiently educated in the
area of human sexuality.
Under existing law, persons apply
ing for a physician's or surgeon's cer
tificate must have completed at least
4000 hours and four years of instruc
tion in an accredited medical school.
The bill requires human sexuality, de
fined as "the study of a human being as
a sexual being and how he or she func
tions with respect thereto," to be in
cluded in the curricula.
Rich agreed that a number of doctors
are not adequately informed about
some areas in medicine, simply be
cause the medical field is so vast.
"We could keep a person in medical
school for fifteen years, or even a
lifetime, 1 daresay, if we wanted to ex
pose him to every subject," he said.
Therefore, to keep the period of edu
cation required for a medical degree
within reasonable bounds, a "very dis
criminatory selection has to be made to
put the most useful subjects in the cur
riculum," Rich said.
"There is an increasing trend in this
country at the present time to pass
laws about what will be taught in the
university and it's a very ominous
trend as far as the universities are con
cerned."
As to the effect of the bill on the
university medical school. Rich said,
"My understanding is that the bill
does not require a course. The medical
school has to certify that the student
has received adequate instruction in
human sexuality." This can be done
without the inclusion of a separate
course, he said.

law by Gov. Brown this September.
Rich criticized the bill as an attempt
by the legislature to regulate the cur
riculum of medical schools. "1 do
think that it is not desirable that cur
ricula requirements be established by
the legislature by law," he said.
According to Vasconcellos, the bill
was written in response to assembly
hearings on whether doctors should be

licensed in the area of human sexual
ity.
The general impression of the hear
ings, said Vasconcellos, was that doc
tors who were licensed in other areas
were not sufficiently educated in the
area of human sexuality.
Under existing law, persons apply
ing for a physician's or surgeon's cer
tificate must have completed at least
4000 hours and four years of instruc
tion in an accredited medical school.
The bill requires human sexuality, de
fined as "the study of a human being as
a sexual being and how he or she func
tions with respect thereto," to be in
cluded in the curricula.
Rich agreed that a number of doctors
are not adequately informed about
some areas in medicine, simply be
cause the medical field is so vast.
"We could keep a person in medical
school for fifteen years, or even a
lifetime, 1 daresay, if we wanted to ex
pose him to every subject," he said.
Therefore, to keep the period of edu
cation required for a medical degree
within reasonable bounds, a "very dis
criminatory selection has to be made to
put the most useful subjects in the cur
riculum," Rich said.
"There is an increasing trend in this
country at the present time to pass
laws about what will be taught in the
university and it's a very ominous
trend as far as the universities are con
cerned."
As to the effect of the bill on the
university medical school. Rich said,
"My understanding is that the bill
does not require a course. The medical
school has to certify that the student
has received adequate instruction in
human sexuality." This can be done
without the inclusion of a separate
course, he said.
