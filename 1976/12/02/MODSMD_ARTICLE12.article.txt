# No substitute for the Stanford experience
## 
### 
Stanford is a unique place; it's not your typical
American university. Before 1 even arrived on cam
pus, I had been warned that this place was different,
and that life here was something special. By now
I've lived here long enough to realize that this is
true.
We are supposedly a group of special individu
als, but whether or not this is true, we are certainly
living in an unusual place. One good look around
the campus is enough to quickly reinforce one's
feeling that Stanford is indeed unique.
No discussion of the special features of our uni
versity can be complete without mention of the
Incomparables themselves; yes, our illustrious
marching band. Surely there is no other band in the
universe that is as colorful, and that can generate as
much excitement as LSJUMB can.
What other band can boast a marching Hoover
Tower, or a dancing tree? And what other band
could possibly have the gall and bad taste to celeb
rate Chairman Mao's death, or to advertise such
things as wet dreams? No wonder our half-time
shows have been banned from all three networks.
Revered symbol
Ah yes, and Hoover Tower. No doubt the world's
largest and most revered phallic symbol. And that
of one of our great presidents' too! Surely no other
university has such an exciting piece of architec
ture. (Who was that that suggested that our campus
was designed by Andy Warhol?)
And speaking of architecture, how about our
great Quad? Going to class can be an adventure at
Stanford; it's certainly more fun to wander through
a labyrinth than to go to a room when you know
exactly where you're headed. I think the layout ot
the Quad must have been tried out on laboratory
mice so that maximum intellectual stimulation
could be derived from the design.
Stanford students probably have the healthiest
teeth around too. This may not last forever though;
they're thinking of adding some more water to our

fluorine supply.
Girls at Stanford are in a unique position. Every
full moon, dozens of girls here can have their lives
fulfilled; they can be transformed into Stanford
Women. I'll bet there aren't any more Cal women
now than there were last grunion run.
Precarious place
We also have the distinction of being in a pre
carious place, should the California coast be rocked

by another earthquake. Most Stanford students,
though, seem fairly intrigued at the prospect of
such a disaster.
On any given day, students at the North side of
the Quad can be seen gleefully admiring the photo
graphs of a devastated Stanford campus after the
big 1906 quake. "Aw geez. We haven't had a good
one in 70 years!"
We manage to supply a few disasters of our own
though. In past years, we somehow managed to
spend a thousand bucks and light that Big Game
Bonfire. Then everyone, ecology nuts and all, ran
down and joyfully watched as tons of pollutants
were spewed into the night air.
One never runs out of interesting things to see
and do on campus. We've got two places where
students can use their mathematical skills to man
ipulate fantastic, mind-boggling machines. Our

great computer center, and of course, the Tresidder
Pinball Center.
Profound graffiti
For those who prefer the arts to the sciences,
there's always the men's room walls in the English
department. Some of our most profound examples
of the use of the English language have been spot
ted above English department urinals. Not
thoroughly unique, you might claim, but wait till
you see the writing.
Also at Tresidder is that ever-popular source of
culinary creativity â€” The Transition. Any experi
enced Transition diner can recall a battle over
French fries with those viscious black birds that
hover above the patio, and swoop down at lunch
hour to swipe fries, sandwiches, and any other
greasy food they can sink their beaks into.
Some patrons have left their trays at times, and
have returned moments later to find a pack of sleek
black vultures walking over their food. Most cus
tomers prefer to eat inside. Some observant buyers
have peered into the kitchen and have seen a huge
pile of bread slices atop one of theovens. That is the
work of the Transition's Norweigan chef, Helge,
who throws all unused ends of bread loaves onto
the top of the oven, thus creating the famous
Norwegian Bread Mountain. (According to the
kitchen manager, Frank, bread growson trees in the
Norwegian mountains.)
When asked what his Hread Mountain was for,
Helge replied, "What is Yosemite for?" The Moun
tain mysteriously disappeared last week; I guess
the Transition served stuffing for Thanksgiving.
The food is usually good and fresh, but I recently
heard that the Archaeology Department was send
ing someone over to give the chili a Carbon-14 test.
Now that's unique.
Yes. this is undoubtedly the Stanford University,
;i truly unique experience. As we like to say. "there
is no substitute for a Stanford education."
