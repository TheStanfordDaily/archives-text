Bonfire fiasco
The recent big game bonfire fiasco,
which included two injuries and an
illegal fire, should be the last of its
kind. An uncontrolled bonfireat 3 a.m.
producing several thousand pounds of
air pollutants is very poor symbolism
for Stanford University in this era of
ecological sensitivity. We believe that
Stanford should withdraw permission
for any more bonfires to be held on its
land.

The Nov. 30 Daily article on the
ASSU Senate meeting was misleading
in that it implied that the Western Civ
motion failed solely because Brad kre
voy introduced it. We feel that it is
important to point out that several
senators were opposed to the basic
concept of the motion and would have
voted against it regardless of its au
thorship.
However, it is truethat the politics of
personality played a role in the se
nate's rejection of the resolution.
Senator krevoy has clearly been guilty
of running the COP through lunch
buying, smiling, and general grand
standing for the last two years.
It is unfortunate that krevoy's antics
hampered the consideration of the
Western Civ motion, for this time he
had attached his name to a resolution
of substance. Perhaps it is unfortunate
that those senators who voted their be
liefs in this matter did not stick around

to give quotes to the Daily.

Palm Drive
I'd like to pose a question to the au
tomobile drivers in the Stanford com
munity: Why do many of you assume
that Palm Drive was constructed exc
lusively for automobile traffic?
I ride my bike on Palm Drive. For the
last six years, I have been mutely en
during a series of insults, suggestions,
and polite requests from motorists on
Palm Drive, to this effect: "Why don't
vou ride on the bike path, you
M!!$F&()"
My reply is this: I like to ride my
bicycle quickly, safely and securely.
And that is impossible on the
"bicycle-pedestrian path." The path,
believe it or not. is in worse repair than
Palm Drive. While riding on the path. 1
run the risk of ruining rims in chuc-'
kholes and getting flat tires from
thorns and broken glass, which are not
swept up (car tires on Palm Drive keep
the road surface sparkling clean!).
I run the risk of colliding with
pedestrians and bicyclists on the path
— neither group seems to adhere to a
keep-to-the-right understanding.
I've ridden on the path. I prefer risk
ing my fool neck witb the cars on Palm
Drive to picking my way gingerly
through pot-holes, broken bottles,
pedestrians, and other obstacles on the
path.

Course reviews
Greg Larson and David Parker
(Daily, Nov. 22) point to a declining
number of faculty who wish to cooper
ate in the ASSI) course review. They
deduce th.it "the quality of teaching at
Stanford, and evaluation of it. is in
deed a low priority for most faculty."
Absent from their published conclu
sions is the fact that some faculty ob
ject to the sometimes careless proces
sing of the evaluations, the search for
the sexy quote that is not necessarily
representative of a class reaction, and
the apparent unwillingness of the
writers to review an evaluation when
asked to do so by a faculty member.
As an example of a sloppy course
evaluation there is the case in which
the ASSIJ Course Guide reported that
"most students disliked the non
existent emphasis on original think
ing."
The review does not tell us on whose
part — the instructor's or the students,
was there no "original thinking," and
while students may have given "origi
nal thinking." a low rating, is it a
necessary assumption that they "dis
liked it" in a basic course which was
their introduction to a new subject?
A potentially libelous quote from a
disappointed student does not deter
ASSU from publishing it. Until more
care and a sense of responsibility to
faculty as well as students is shown by
Larson and Parker, they can expect
their course review system to further
decline in acceptance.
The review comes at the end of a
course. Many instructors make it a
point to invite student comment dur

ing the course, when constructive
suggestions can he acted upon. The
Course Hovieiv majftend to make stu
dents in large classes too passive in
this regard, and not encourage them to
talk frankly with their instructors
while the course is going on.

Save Cliveden
As former students of Stanford's
overseas campus at Cliveden, we feel
that the university administration and
the Overseas Studies Office would he
making a gross mistake if the
Stanford-in-Britain program were
moved away from Cliveden.
The university has all but definitely
decided to move the campus, however,
so we — and others who believe as we
do — must act quickly.
For this reason, we have formed a
Save Cliveden Committee. Our first
meeting will be Dec. 2 at 4:15 p.m. in
the Blue Lounge at Roble. All former
Cliveden people should attend this
meeting, so that we can consider ac
tion to save Cliveden.
I'lease come if you are an ex-
Clivedenite. This is our only chance to
save Cliveden. If we fail for lack of
support, more than Cliveden itself will
be lost — the opportunity fur a beauti
ful and memorable experience for all
present and future Stanford students
will be lost as well.

Save Cliveden
As former students of Stanford's
overseas campus at Cliveden, we feel
that the university administration and
the Overseas Studies Office would he
making a gross mistake if the
Stanford-in-Britain program were
moved away from Cliveden.
The university has all but definitely
decided to move the campus, however,
so we — and others who believe as we
do — must act quickly.
For this reason, we have formed a
Save Cliveden Committee. Our first
meeting will be Dec. 2 at 4:15 p.m. in
the Blue Lounge at Roble. All former
Cliveden people should attend this
meeting, so that we can consider ac
tion to save Cliveden.
I'lease come if you are an ex-
Clivedenite. This is our only chance to
save Cliveden. If we fail for lack of
support, more than Cliveden itself will
be lost — the opportunity fur a beauti
ful and memorable experience for all
present and future Stanford students
will be lost as well.

Bonfire fiasco
The recent big game bonfire fiasco,
which included two injuries and an
illegal fire, should be the last of its
kind. An uncontrolled bonfireat 3 a.m.
producing several thousand pounds of
air pollutants is very poor symbolism
for Stanford University in this era of
ecological sensitivity. We believe that
Stanford should withdraw permission
for any more bonfires to be held on its
land.

The Nov. 30 Daily article on the
ASSU Senate meeting was misleading
in that it implied that the Western Civ
motion failed solely because Brad kre
voy introduced it. We feel that it is
important to point out that several
senators were opposed to the basic
concept of the motion and would have
voted against it regardless of its au
thorship.
However, it is truethat the politics of
personality played a role in the se
nate's rejection of the resolution.
Senator krevoy has clearly been guilty
of running the COP through lunch
buying, smiling, and general grand
standing for the last two years.
It is unfortunate that krevoy's antics
hampered the consideration of the
Western Civ motion, for this time he
had attached his name to a resolution
of substance. Perhaps it is unfortunate
that those senators who voted their be
liefs in this matter did not stick around

to give quotes to the Daily.

Palm Drive
I'd like to pose a question to the au
tomobile drivers in the Stanford com
munity: Why do many of you assume
that Palm Drive was constructed exc
lusively for automobile traffic?
I ride my bike on Palm Drive. For the
last six years, I have been mutely en
during a series of insults, suggestions,
and polite requests from motorists on
Palm Drive, to this effect: "Why don't
vou ride on the bike path, you
M!!$F&()"
My reply is this: I like to ride my
bicycle quickly, safely and securely.
And that is impossible on the
"bicycle-pedestrian path." The path,
believe it or not. is in worse repair than
Palm Drive. While riding on the path. 1
run the risk of ruining rims in chuc-'
kholes and getting flat tires from
thorns and broken glass, which are not
swept up (car tires on Palm Drive keep
the road surface sparkling clean!).
I run the risk of colliding with
pedestrians and bicyclists on the path
— neither group seems to adhere to a
keep-to-the-right understanding.
I've ridden on the path. I prefer risk
ing my fool neck witb the cars on Palm
Drive to picking my way gingerly
through pot-holes, broken bottles,
pedestrians, and other obstacles on the
path.

Course reviews
Greg Larson and David Parker
(Daily, Nov. 22) point to a declining
number of faculty who wish to cooper
ate in the ASSI) course review. They
deduce th.it "the quality of teaching at
Stanford, and evaluation of it. is in
deed a low priority for most faculty."
Absent from their published conclu
sions is the fact that some faculty ob
ject to the sometimes careless proces
sing of the evaluations, the search for
the sexy quote that is not necessarily
representative of a class reaction, and
the apparent unwillingness of the
writers to review an evaluation when
asked to do so by a faculty member.
As an example of a sloppy course
evaluation there is the case in which
the ASSIJ Course Guide reported that
"most students disliked the non
existent emphasis on original think
ing."
The review does not tell us on whose
part — the instructor's or the students,
was there no "original thinking," and
while students may have given "origi
nal thinking." a low rating, is it a
necessary assumption that they "dis
liked it" in a basic course which was
their introduction to a new subject?
A potentially libelous quote from a
disappointed student does not deter
ASSU from publishing it. Until more
care and a sense of responsibility to
faculty as well as students is shown by
Larson and Parker, they can expect
their course review system to further
decline in acceptance.
The review comes at the end of a
course. Many instructors make it a
point to invite student comment dur

ing the course, when constructive
suggestions can he acted upon. The
Course Hovieiv majftend to make stu
dents in large classes too passive in
this regard, and not encourage them to
talk frankly with their instructors
while the course is going on.

Save Cliveden
As former students of Stanford's
overseas campus at Cliveden, we feel
that the university administration and
the Overseas Studies Office would he
making a gross mistake if the
Stanford-in-Britain program were
moved away from Cliveden.
The university has all but definitely
decided to move the campus, however,
so we — and others who believe as we
do — must act quickly.
For this reason, we have formed a
Save Cliveden Committee. Our first
meeting will be Dec. 2 at 4:15 p.m. in
the Blue Lounge at Roble. All former
Cliveden people should attend this
meeting, so that we can consider ac
tion to save Cliveden.
I'lease come if you are an ex-
Clivedenite. This is our only chance to
save Cliveden. If we fail for lack of
support, more than Cliveden itself will
be lost — the opportunity fur a beauti
ful and memorable experience for all
present and future Stanford students
will be lost as well.

Bonfire fiasco
The recent big game bonfire fiasco,
which included two injuries and an
illegal fire, should be the last of its
kind. An uncontrolled bonfireat 3 a.m.
producing several thousand pounds of
air pollutants is very poor symbolism
for Stanford University in this era of
ecological sensitivity. We believe that
Stanford should withdraw permission
for any more bonfires to be held on its
land.

The Nov. 30 Daily article on the
ASSU Senate meeting was misleading
in that it implied that the Western Civ
motion failed solely because Brad kre
voy introduced it. We feel that it is
important to point out that several
senators were opposed to the basic
concept of the motion and would have
voted against it regardless of its au
thorship.
However, it is truethat the politics of
personality played a role in the se
nate's rejection of the resolution.
Senator krevoy has clearly been guilty
of running the COP through lunch
buying, smiling, and general grand
standing for the last two years.
It is unfortunate that krevoy's antics
hampered the consideration of the
Western Civ motion, for this time he
had attached his name to a resolution
of substance. Perhaps it is unfortunate
that those senators who voted their be
liefs in this matter did not stick around

to give quotes to the Daily.
