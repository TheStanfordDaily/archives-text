We can chart our future clearly and wisely only when we
know the pcith which has led to the present.
-Adlai Stevenson, 1952
On Nov. 7, 1972 Richard Nixon defeated George
McGovern by the largest plurality ever awarded an
American president. Twenty-one months later on Aug. 14,
1974, this same president was forced to resign in public
shame and dishonor under the tide of Watergate and the
| White House scandals which he sanctioned.
Four years have passed since McGovern's defeat in
[ 1972, and now the democratic standard bearer, Jimmy
112 Carter, is to become president. The nation has seen many
[ changes in both political attitude and opinion, and amidst
' it .ill George McGovern, the senator from South Dakota,
lias remained a prolific spokesman of American liberal
ideology.
Senator McGovern no longer holds the political power,
prestige or voice he once had, and whether he w r ould have
been a good President cannot be speculated. McGovern
did, however, leave America a tremendous legacy. He left
Ihe legacy of his goals, dreams and aspirations for the
nation. 1 lis goal was to bring honesty, morality and justice
back to domestic and foreign affairs.
An analysis of several key issues that McGovern stres
sed in the campaign of 1972 clearly reveal his political
foresight as these views have either been adopted com
pletely or are in thefuture plans of American policy today.
Five years ago McGovern saw gross inequities in our
economy. To reduce unemployment McGovern suggested
fiscal action â€” closing the gap between actual output and
economic potential, "plugging up" tax loopholes, cutting
waste in the Pentagon, shifting from a war-time to a
peace-time economy, increasing taxes on windfall profits
iind eliminating accelerated depreciation rates and in
vestment tax credit for large corporations.
With the excess federal funds created by this fiscal ac
tion, McGovern proposed to spend $0 billion a year creat
ing a million government jobs and cutting the welfare
roles by 30 per cent.
Active assistance
In addition McGovern outlined the need for the federal
government to take an active role in assisting the lower
and middle classes. He proposed that the federal govern
ment pay for one-third of all public and secondary
education, thereby lowering property taxes. Healsocalled
lor a $1000 minimum income for every American, as well
.is an increase in personal tax exemptions for the working
man.
All these proposals were blasted by the Committee to
Re-elect the President. McGovern was labeled everything
from a radical reformer to a "pinko" socialist. The past
tour years have shown these statements to be false.
Federal revenue sharing has been proposed by Presi
dent Ford. McGovern's $1000 guarantee has been re
placed by an almost identical negative income tax. The
current Congress is working on the same tax reform legis
lation that McGovern suggested in 1971. The federal gov
ernment is taking steps to eliminate tax loopholes and
investigate excess corporate profits.

For two months prior to the election McGovern and his
campaigners tried desperately to inform the public of the
audacity and implications of the Watergate break-in.
McGovern said, "We must restore the people's faith in
the honesty of the political process by making the process
itself more honest. Let us give our country a chance to
elect a government that will speak the truth, for this is the
time tor the truth in the life of this country."
Americans turned a deaf ear to these warni ngs, and four
years later we see that McGovern was right. The nation has
plowed through Watergate, enacted campaign reform
laws and elected Carter, a man who promises to "speak the
truth."
With regard to the Vietnam War McGovern said. "We
must have the courage to admit that however sincere our
motives, we madea dreadful mistake in trying tosettlethe
alfairs of the Vietnamese people with American ammuni
tion, troops and bombers. . . There is now no way to end it
and to tree our prisoners except a definite, early date for
withdrawal of every American soldier."
Knd military support
McGovern promised, if elected, to: first, terminate all
military support in South Vietnam within 24 hours of his
inauguration; second, remove the dictator Nguyen Van
Thieu from office; third, accept a coalition government in
Vietnam, and finally, keep U.S. forces in Thailand as
military leverage to demand that our prisoners of war be
released. McGovern further stated that all Americans
would be out of Vietnam within 90 days of his oath of
office.
This proposal Nixon called defeat and surrender, and so
Americans voted once more for Nixon's "secret plan" to
end the war and "peace with honor."
We lost the war in Vietnam after five years of Nixon's
plans and replans, continued deception of the American
people and senseless bombing and destruction.
History has been called the judge of man's deeds, and
history has shown McGovern to have been right when
most Americans were wrong. The future awaits the adop
tion of several ideas McGovern suggested: a national
health care plan, increased federal revenue sharing, gov
ernment sponsored creation of jobs, morality in foreign
affairs, tax reform and cuts in military spending.
George McGovern is a living lesson for the American
people and the leaders of this nation. He is a humanitarian
politician of keen insight and ability, and deserves our
respect and support on the issues he voices silently today.
America has often lost the opportunity to learn from its
men of the past. My only hope is that President-elect
Carter will exercise better judgment and historical under
standing than his predecessors as he makes his transition
to the presidency.
Carter must remember that he is the inheritor of the
party George McGovern headed in 1972 and that men like
McGovern still possess useful knowledge and ability.
We as citizens must remember that George McGovern
has been historically vindicated and that his legacy is a
living reality in American politics.
