i would like to respond to the article
by R. Hunter Summers. " 'Bakke' Af
firmative Action Ruling Juse" (Daily
Nov. 17). Summers makes a case
which is frequently heard in discus
sions oi the legitimacy of minority
admissions.
Summers' case appeals, at its best, to
many who have grasped so clearly the
immorality of the use of race by one
group to dominate another that they
want the concept of race to go away
altogether. They want to be able to say,
as Summers quotes Justice Harlan as
saying, "Our Constitution is col
orblind."
VVhen it comes to deciding who gets
what, e.g. who has the opportunity to
attend a professional school, they want
to be able to say that race never even
entered into the decision process. This
is what Summers intends, although he
somewhat revealingly overstates the
case, when he says "Bakke has his
academic qualifications to stand upon;
some of those admitted under a quota
system have only their race."
Although the motivation behind
this line of argument may be good, its
view ot reality is naive. We do not have
a colorless society and we should not
have colorblind institutions. Instead,
we need institutions which see colors
clearly enough not to lose sight of their
responsibility to end unequal treat
ment.
Color-blind admissions
Specifically regarding the Bakke
case, we need medical school admis
sions committees which (like the one
at Stanford) recognize that whereas
about one-quarter of the nation's pa
tients are of racial minority groups,
only a small fraction of the nation's
doctors are. Such committees make it
increasingly possible not only for pa
tients of color to see physicians of
similar racial background, but also for
the profession as a whole to be more
sensitive to the health needs of minor
ity persons. Color-blind admissions
committees cannot achieve these go
als.
Proponents of Summers' view want
to eliminate the possibility that some
one might be able to say to a minority
medical student, "You were admitted
primarily because you are black." This
desire is based on two misconceptions.
First, it assumes that a person admit
ted on the basis (to a significant extent)
of race is somehow less deserving than
a person admitted for other reasons. In
actuality, the admissions process in
this situation judges minority and
non-minority applicants to be equally
deserving.
It says in effect to both applicants
"you have been selected as a person
who has .something important to con
tribute to our school and the profes
sion." The fact that what one applicant

has to contribute is the perspective at a
minority person (besides the ability to
become a good physician), while the
other's special contribution is. tor
example, a background in computer
science, renders the former no less de
serving, granted the desirability of
achieving certain social goals in the
selection process.
Not qualified
A second misconception of some
proponents of Summers' view is that
minority applicants to medical school
really are not qualified to study to be
come physicians. This is simply not
true â€” all medical students are re
quired to demonstrate their compe
tence prior to graduation, and medical
educators have been quick to defend
the validity of the certification system.
Nor is there any evidence in terms of

lawsuits that minority physicians pro
vide any lesser degree of quality care.
The danger of the Bakke decision is
that by appearing to fall within the
tradition of anti-discrimination court
rulings, it wins the support of many
who have opposed discrimination in
the past. Its true effect, however, is to
sabotage the attempt to explicitly re
verse the racial inequalities which his
tory has bequeathed us.
Minority admissions by itself cannot
give us a just and equal society; in fact,
in and of itself it leaves most in
equalities intact. But it does make our
society somewhat more equal, and it
gives rise to forces which will bring
about a much greater degree of equal
ity.
