# Senate practices petty student politics
## 
### 
Steven Buckley

Apparently the campaign for next
year's Council of Presidents (COP) has
commenced. Though we haven't as yet
been inundated by those seemingly
端biquitous political flyers, any in
terested student may witness the pre
liminary theatrics biweekly. One need
only attend the meetings of the ASSU
Senate. The proceedings tend to be
frivolous; the results are not.
At the Nov. 29 meeting, the senate
debated a resolution voicing student
opposition to re-institution of the
Western Civilization requirement, an
anachronism which has recently gar
nered newfound support.
The senators faced an ex
tremely clearcut objective: a well
reasoned, unequivocal statement of
student sentiment directed to the Fa
culty Senate.
The senate did not accomplish that
objective. Though there was not
unanimous agreement on the resolu
tion, most certainly a majority of the
senators were supportive of the intent
of the resolution as presented. Yet. the
resolution failed to pass in a roll call
vote of the senate.
An analysis of the entire affair reve
als that petty personal politics over
shadowed any intelligent evaluation
of the resolution's merits. Sadly, this
method of decision-making on the
basis of personal differences is rapidly
becoming characteristic ot this still
very young senate.
Evidently the clashing political de-

signs of some senators have taken pre
cedence over the output of the senate
itself. Worries about who gets credit,
who gets quoted and who gets expo
sure now seem determinate in the vot
ing decisions of some senators. Lost
amid their obsession for personal note
is the overriding purpose of the Senate
to represent student concerns before
the Administration and faculty.
An irrefutable instance of this blat
ant disregard for the greater interests
of the students is provided by the final
vote on the Western Civ resolution.
Without articulating any objections
and without offering any suggestions,
both of the undergraduate slates
(Hammer & Coffin and Livingston/
Morrow/Sharp) voted against the re
solution. It was defeated.
The actual losers in this morass of
political ambitions can only be the Se
nate's constituency: the students.
In one of the few substantive
academic issues to have confronted
the students this year, their representa
tive body failed to formulate a posi
tion. For this I apologize.
Senators would do well to remember
that the COP race takes place in the
spring. Until such time, let us concern
ourselves with the duties of the senate.
Partisan political considerations
should not be allowed to subvert its
primary objective: advocacy of student
interests.

ternate ASSU senator.)

Apparently the campaign for next
year's Council of Presidents (COP) has
commenced. Though we haven't as yet
been inundated by those seemingly
端biquitous political flyers, any in
terested student may witness the pre
liminary theatrics biweekly. One need
only attend the meetings of the ASSU
Senate. The proceedings tend to be
frivolous; the results are not.
At the Nov. 29 meeting, the senate
debated a resolution voicing student
opposition to re-institution of the
Western Civilization requirement, an
anachronism which has recently gar
nered newfound support.
The senators faced an ex
tremely clearcut objective: a well
reasoned, unequivocal statement of
student sentiment directed to the Fa
culty Senate.
The senate did not accomplish that
objective. Though there was not
unanimous agreement on the resolu
tion, most certainly a majority of the
senators were supportive of the intent
of the resolution as presented. Yet. the
resolution failed to pass in a roll call
vote of the senate.
