# Fund urges wildlife care

### 
San Francisco (AP) — With "earth
care" as their battle cry and the preserva
tion of endangered creatures large and
small as their mission, conservationists
from around the world ended a three-day
meeting yesterday by urging renewed
commitment to rescuing the global envi
ronment.
The focus of the World Wildlife Fund
congress, the first meeting the 15-year
old organization has held in the United
States, was on endangered species like
the giant Galapagos land turtle, the snow
leopard, whales, the tiny vicuna — and
man himself.
Their defenders were the 700 con
ferees from 35 nations who raised their
voices in an increasingly sophisticated
demand for a better planet earth.
By unanimous voice vote, 29 resolu
tions were adopted, including insistent
pleas to African countries to protect
wildlife from overzealous hunters, to

Latin American governments to con
serve tropical rain forests and to agencies
in the United States to step up efforts to
save the California condor.
The Switzerland-based fund, with af
filiates in 26 nations, wants to provide
"urgently needed resources to preserve
the rapidly vanishing resources of nature
on which man's survival ultimately de
pends." But at its triennial meeting, fund
leaders sounded more militant notes.
"For years conservation organizations
were thought of as a sort of missionary
area of the church, and conservation was
merely akin to religious fervor. . . S.
Dillon Ripley, chairman of the fund's
United States appeal and secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, told the open
ing session.
"But fortunately those days are long
gone. Conservation of nature today is in
evitably involved with the problem ot
world stability and peace," he said.

Sir Peter Scott, a British naturalist and
a founding member of the fund and cur
rent international chairman, saw the role
of private organizations like the fund as a
catalyst for government involvement.
"All we can do is spearhead the ef
fort," he said in an interview, citing a
recent $1 million campaign by the fund
to save the tiger.
"George," a 60-year-old land turtle be
lieved to be the last male in the
Galapagos Islands, is among 1032 en
dangered species in the world that are
the object of the fund's attention, he said.
In its self-described role as a "modern
Noah's ark," the fund has disbursed
more than $20 million to 1448 projects in
more than HO nations, and Scott an
nounced a new two-year campaign to
raise $15 million for research in the
marine environment. The fund also is
engaged in efforts to block construction
of the world's largest port in the Palau
Islands in the Western Pacific.

the object of the fund's attention, he said.
In its self-described role as a "modern
Noah's ark," the fund has disbursed
more than $20 million to 1448 projects in
more than HO nations, and Scott an
nounced a new two-year campaign to
raise $15 million for research in the
marine environment. The fund also is
engaged in efforts to block construction
of the world's largest port in the Palau
Islands in the Western Pacific.
San Francisco (AP) — With "earth
care" as their battle cry and the preserva
tion of endangered creatures large and
small as their mission, conservationists
from around the world ended a three-day
meeting yesterday by urging renewed
commitment to rescuing the global envi
ronment.
The focus of the World Wildlife Fund
congress, the first meeting the 15-year
old organization has held in the United
States, was on endangered species like
the giant Galapagos land turtle, the snow
leopard, whales, the tiny vicuna — and
man himself.
Their defenders were the 700 con
ferees from 35 nations who raised their
voices in an increasingly sophisticated
demand for a better planet earth.
By unanimous voice vote, 29 resolu
tions were adopted, including insistent
pleas to African countries to protect
wildlife from overzealous hunters, to

Latin American governments to con
serve tropical rain forests and to agencies
in the United States to step up efforts to
save the California condor.
The Switzerland-based fund, with af
filiates in 26 nations, wants to provide
"urgently needed resources to preserve
the rapidly vanishing resources of nature
on which man's survival ultimately de
pends." But at its triennial meeting, fund
leaders sounded more militant notes.
"For years conservation organizations
were thought of as a sort of missionary
area of the church, and conservation was
merely akin to religious fervor. . . S.
Dillon Ripley, chairman of the fund's
United States appeal and secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, told the open
ing session.
"But fortunately those days are long
gone. Conservation of nature today is in
evitably involved with the problem ot
world stability and peace," he said.

Sir Peter Scott, a British naturalist and
a founding member of the fund and cur
rent international chairman, saw the role
of private organizations like the fund as a
catalyst for government involvement.
"All we can do is spearhead the ef
fort," he said in an interview, citing a
recent $1 million campaign by the fund
to save the tiger.
"George," a 60-year-old land turtle be
lieved to be the last male in the
Galapagos Islands, is among 1032 en
dangered species in the world that are
the object of the fund's attention, he said.
