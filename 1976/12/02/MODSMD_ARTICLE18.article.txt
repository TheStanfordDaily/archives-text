# As portrayed in movies
## U.S. 'screwed up' sexually 
### 
(CPS) — If movies are sup
posed to reflect society and its
values, then the American cul
ture as portrayed in Hollywood
movies today is "certainly
screwed up sexually," said
Molly Haskell, film critic for the
Village Voice.
A few years ago, while appear
ing on the Today show, Haskell
had the audacity to suggest that
images of women in films were,
for the most part, degrading and
inadequate. Barbara Walters
promptly dismissed the idea as
"paranoid."
Today, even with women's
liberation, the situation isn't

much better. "It may even be a
little worse now than during the
1930s and '405," Haskell told
CPS in a recent interview in
Boulder, Colorado.
"Back then you had your Hep
burns, your Joan Crawfords, Ida
Lupinos, Bette Davis'. There
were strong female actresses to
play the parts. Today, Barbra
Streisand is the only actress that
has captured Hollywood's im
agination," Haskell said. The
plots and characters in the
movies during the 1930s and
'40s were "based on pretext and
conventions," she acknow
ledged. However, the movies

usually were able to show a
woman as a strong creature, she
added.
'Buddy films'
"Hell, there were more women
'working' in the movies back
then than actually were. There
were romantic boy-meets-girl
movies," she said. "Today there
are buddy films."
Haskell noted such films as
Butch Cassidy and the Sun
dance Kid, The Sting, Midnight
Cowboy, The Godfather and
Taxi Driver. Men directors, she
said, are portraying with more
frequency, women as "figments
of their fantasies."
"Women are in such a transi
tional period today that most
male directors are choosing to
ignore them completely — savea
sex scene or two — rather than
fuss with trying to show them as
real," she explained.
Actresses 'human'
Another problem she noted
was that with increased aware
ness of their potential many
women are simply not wanting
to become movie stars. Actresses
like Jane F'onda and Vanessa
Redgrave are notable in that both
go to extreme efforts to make
sure the world knows that they
"are also human beings, capable
of thinking and feeling some
thing off the studio lot."
The demise of the studio sys

tem of placing young actresses
under contract and then de
veloping their careers has re
sulted in slim pickings for qual
ity actresses. "I'm sure there are
quality actresses around," Has
kell said, "it's just about impos
sible to break into a bastion con
trolled by men." She cited Ellen
Burstyn of Alice Doesn't Live
Here A nymore fame as an actress
capable of richness and variety,
but terribly underrated.
Haskell said that television is
to today's culture as movies were
during the 1930s through '50s.
"People just turn on the tube
today like they went to the
'movies' back then," she said. "It
is incredible that disaster flicks
are such big draws."
Noting that the program
Mary Hartmcin, Mary Hartman is
portraying "Woman" in several
differing roles, Haskell said "at
least progress is being made in
that medium."
History of women
In her book. From Reverence
to Hope, Haskell provides an ex
tensive history of women in
films. The degeneration of wo
men's roles began during the
1950s she says. It was then that
women started being portrayed
as -either vamps or tomboys.
"Since there was no middle
ground there vyas no room for
growth." she said.

of their fantasies."
"Women are in such a transi
tional period today that most
male directors are choosing to
ignore them completely — savea
sex scene or two — rather than
fuss with trying to show them as
real," she explained.
Actresses 'human'
Another problem she noted
was that with increased aware
ness of their potential many
women are simply not wanting
to become movie stars. Actresses
like Jane F'onda and Vanessa
Redgrave are notable in that both
go to extreme efforts to make
sure the world knows that they
"are also human beings, capable
of thinking and feeling some
thing off the studio lot."
The demise of the studio sys

tem of placing young actresses
under contract and then de
veloping their careers has re
sulted in slim pickings for qual
ity actresses. "I'm sure there are
quality actresses around," Has
kell said, "it's just about impos
sible to break into a bastion con
trolled by men." She cited Ellen
Burstyn of Alice Doesn't Live
Here A nymore fame as an actress
capable of richness and variety,
but terribly underrated.
Haskell said that television is
to today's culture as movies were
during the 1930s through '50s.
"People just turn on the tube
today like they went to the
'movies' back then," she said. "It
is incredible that disaster flicks
are such big draws."
Noting that the program
Mary Hartmcin, Mary Hartman is
portraying "Woman" in several
differing roles, Haskell said "at
least progress is being made in
that medium."
History of women
In her book. From Reverence
to Hope, Haskell provides an ex
tensive history of women in
films. The degeneration of wo
men's roles began during the
1950s she says. It was then that
women started being portrayed
as -either vamps or tomboys.
"Since there was no middle
ground there vyas no room for
growth." she said.
(CPS) — If movies are sup
posed to reflect society and its
values, then the American cul
ture as portrayed in Hollywood
movies today is "certainly
screwed up sexually," said
Molly Haskell, film critic for the
Village Voice.
A few years ago, while appear
ing on the Today show, Haskell
had the audacity to suggest that
images of women in films were,
for the most part, degrading and
inadequate. Barbara Walters
promptly dismissed the idea as
"paranoid."
Today, even with women's
liberation, the situation isn't

much better. "It may even be a
little worse now than during the
1930s and '405," Haskell told
CPS in a recent interview in
Boulder, Colorado.
"Back then you had your Hep
burns, your Joan Crawfords, Ida
Lupinos, Bette Davis'. There
were strong female actresses to
play the parts. Today, Barbra
Streisand is the only actress that
has captured Hollywood's im
agination," Haskell said. The
plots and characters in the
movies during the 1930s and
'40s were "based on pretext and
conventions," she acknow
ledged. However, the movies

usually were able to show a
woman as a strong creature, she
added.
'Buddy films'
"Hell, there were more women
'working' in the movies back
then than actually were. There
were romantic boy-meets-girl
movies," she said. "Today there
are buddy films."
Haskell noted such films as
Butch Cassidy and the Sun
dance Kid, The Sting, Midnight
Cowboy, The Godfather and
Taxi Driver. Men directors, she
said, are portraying with more
frequency, women as "figments
of their fantasies."
