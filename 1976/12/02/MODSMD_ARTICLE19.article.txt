# Marathon skate fulfills group's campaign vow
## 
### 
Death Valley (AP) — A lizard
became the first casualty in
Linda Reingold's marathon rol
ler skate trip when it was
crushed by wheels of her skates
yesterday.
But Linda, 26, making good on
an election campaign vow, kept
on skating after burying the
lizard at the side of the road
which threads its way through
this harsh desert region.
She had promised to skate 125
miles across the valley if Jimmy
Garter was elected president.
The vow was made while Rein
gold was working as a Carter
Canvasser — on roller skates —
in southern California.
Spills slowed the skater as the
trek started Tuesday at Scotty's
Castle on the northwest edge of
the valley, and she covered only
about 20 miles instead of an ex
pected 55 miles. But despite a
sore back, Reingold nearly dou
bled that distance yesterday.
Chris Harris, 37, also skating,
fell and sprained his right wrist.
Another skater, Gary Hudson,
23, flipped and hurt his back. A
fourth skater, photographer
Charles Adams, 34, got off easily
with only some sore muscles.
All planned to go the distance,
even if it takes longer than the
three days scheduled. Dick
Gamble, 60, a tourist who stop
ped to help the skaters when the
motorhome accompanying them
developed battery trouble, also
donned skates for part of yester
day's run.
Linda's mother, Dawn, 49,
said she planned to get into the
act too and skate the final 20
miles or so into Shoshone, on the
southeast edge of the area. A
sixth member of the group, Mike
Karras, planned to stay behind

the wheel of the motorhome
trailing the skaters.
Harris said tourists stopped
the group continually, asking for
autographs and cheering them
on.
He said the skaters aren't
bothered by problems like the

crushed lizard or the wild ani
mal — possibly a burro or coyote
— which knocked over their tent
one night.
But they are troubled by the
vastness of the desert landscape,
which affects their balance, he
said.
