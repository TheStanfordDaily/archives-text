The Athletic Department, in con
junction with the Department of Pub
lic Safety, is initiating a "crack-down"
on trespassers at basketball games, ac
cording to Dept. of Public Safety Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said that persons caught
jumping the fences around Maples
pavilion will be taken into custody.
Eight individuals were cited at Satur
day's game.
"We just didn't fool around . . . We
were losing a lot of paying customers.
Now we're going to detain and cite.
I've checked with the D.A. and it will
stick," said Niemeyer.
According to Niemeyer, juveniles
will be cited and released to their pa
rents. Persons over 18 years old will be
arrested for trespassing and released
on their own recognizance.
Once cited, juveniles must appear
with their parents for a hearing in
juvenile court. Adults must follow the
normal criminal court proceedings,
according to Niemeyer.
According the Robert Young, as
sociate director of athletics, the Athle
tic Department has contracted with
Richardson Security Company for pri
vate security officers to assist public
safety department personnel at the
games.
Young said the red-jacketed athletic
security officers, who are off-duty
peace officers, are not getting the
cooperation that the uniformed offic
ers are receiving.
"Let off-duty police personnel ap
pear in uniform and they get respect,
put them in red jackets and they don't
receive respect. We've been having
problems. Richardson (Security offic
ers) will be there in uniform with
side-arms. Uniforms affect people."
said Young.
Young said that the off-duty sheriff's
deputies cannot appear in uniform
while employed by the university due
to county regulations.
The number of gray-uniformed
Richardson Security officers present at
the games will vary with the projected
attendance. Young said. Six to eight
security officers assisted the Depart
ment of Public Safety at the San Luis
Obispo game last Saturday.
