According to the U.S. Civil Service Commission's Announce
ment 414, the Federal government will offer approximately 10,000
summer positions. They will be found in all government agencies
and will usually be located in large metropolitan areas.
According to Marty Ittner, assistant director of the Student
Employment Office (SEC)), "Any undergraduate interested in
summer employment with the government must take the summer
Federal Civil Service Examination." Ittner said that the test is not a
walk-in examination and that students must mail in an application
one month before the test date.
The exam for this academic year will be offered here in January
and February. Students should go to the SEO for more specific
information, such as pay and job descriptions and in order to apply.
Ittner said. Students should ask for announcement 414 and an
application, she added.
Ittner said that students who took the test last year and wish to
work tor the government again must fill out an update application,
also available in the SEO.
Ittner pointed out that students who have worked for the Federal
government before should note that grade point average is no
longer accepted as an admission standard.
Ittner also said that scores from the FACE or any other govern
ment exam students may have taken are not valid for summer
employment. "Any student who has taken a non-summer civil
service exam must also take the summer test," she said.
Ittner noted that there are two exceptions to the take-the
summer-test rule. "Any undergraduate student applying for
California state internships need not take the exam," she stated.
She added that the California internship program information will
arrive at the SEO in March.
Ittner said that graduate students are also exempt from taking the
test. She said, "Graduate students should apply directly to the
agency for which they want to work."
