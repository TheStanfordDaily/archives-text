# Commission to disperse NYC porno concentration
## 
### 
New York (AP) — Times
Square was described yesterday
as the world's biggest redlight
district at a hearing on proposals
to conquer the city's concentra
tions of sex shops by dividing
them as Detroit has.
A parade of witnesses urged
passage of the proposed legisla
tion at a day-long hearing at City
Hall.
But even the City Planning
Commission conceded that its

plan to drive the sex industry
from mid-Manhattan by forcing
shops to disperse throughout t lie
city could fail, if only because of
an anticipated court challenge.
"I must tell you flatly that I
have absolutely no idea at this
moment whether this legislation
is going to be effective," Com
missioner Sylvia Deutsch told
Rep. Edward Koch (D-N.Y.) who
criticized the bill as inadequate.

The proposed legislation is
similar to that used to keep
"adult use" establishments from
dominating any one area of De
troit, which narrowly survived a
challenge in the U.S. Supreme
Court last June 24.
However, it would go beyond
the Detroit plan by requiring
businesses in violation of the
new zoning law to shut down in
a year.
Additionally, the proposals
would ban all so-called massage
parlors. They also would restrict
to certain commercial areas top
less bars, pornographic book
stores, peep shows and "adult"
movie theaters — and then with
only a maximum of two or three
such places in a block.
"We have the largest redlight
district in the world." Koch de
clared, saying he supported the
measures reluctantly because he
believed the planning commis
sion should, instead, have estab
lished an area like Boston's
»Combat Zone."
"The Boston experiment has
not been successful," Commis
sion Chairman C. Vincent Mar
rero replied. "It has led to breed
ing additional crime."
