# 'Crash course' firms probed
## 
### 
(CPS) â€” The Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) has an
nounced plans for a widespread
investigation into companies
which offer crash courses to stu
dents taking post-graduate ad
missions exams.
William Cibson, director of
the FTC's Boston office, says the
probe, the nation's first into the
growing, multi-million dollar a
year business, will focus on the
advertising claims made by the
companies. The FTC hopes to
determine if the testing com
panies can back up their claims
with evidence that students ac
tually do better after taking their
courses. Some firms say they can
boost a student's score by up to
100 points upon completion of
their course.
Gibson says the inquiry was
spurred by a growing number of
gripes from students as well as
the general feeling among col

lege officials that the crash
courses don't really affect a stu
dent's score.
In fact, spokesmen for the
Educational Testing Service and
the American College Testing
Program, the two organizations
who actually design and ad
minister the tests, say their test
booklets warn students that
crash courses and drilling will
not help them.
Harvard University admis
sions director William Fitzim
mons agrees. "Our research
shows that the crash courses
don't accomplish a thing. The
test scores reflect the quality of
education the students have re
ceived over the years; cram
courses won't change that," he
says.
Last year, 300,000 students
took the Graduate Records Exam
(GRE), 55,000 sweated through
the day-long Medical School

Admissions Test (MCAT), and
133,000 wrote the Law School
Admission Test, according to
the testing services. The stakes
are certainly high; admissions
directors place heavy emphasis
on test results and this year alone
in the medical field, nearly three
students will take the MCAT for
every available position in the
nation's med schools.
Fees for the crash courses

range from $25 to $550; the
courses may last from a few
hours to a full year.
The FTC has not said which
firms are under investigation.
Indeed, a spokesman in the Bos
ton office said the commission
isn't even sure how many test
help companies actually exist.
Students who have had bad
experiences with crash course
firms may contact the FTC.
