# Carter to implement policy for pardons
## 
### 
(CPS) — Now that the presidential elections are
over, it is only a matter of time until President
elect Jimmy Carter makes good on his campaign
promises of unconditional pardons to draft evad
ers.
The National Democratic Party platform called
for a "full and complete pardon for those who
were in legal or financial jeopardy becomes of
their peaceful opposition to the Vietnam War,
with deserters to be considered on a case-to-case
basis."
However, Carter said in September that he
would not be bound to the party platform and
would refuse to give pardons to draft non
registrants or to upgrade less than honorable dis
charges.
Earlier in his campaign, darter stated that "am
nesty means that . . . what you did was right. Par
don means what you did, whether it was right or
wrong, you're forgiven for it. And I do advocate a
pardon for draft evaders."
Stuart Eizenstat, Carter's Director of Policy and
Issues, claimed that the new administration's pol
icy is "not one of unconditional pardon for deser
ters" but would instead depend on several
criteria, one of which is whether or not the man
was deserting because of opposition to the war or
opposition to the Army itself. Such a condition
would be determined by a hearing officer,
Eizenstat said, and offering a hypothetical case he
added that if the man had deserted from the mid
dle of a key battle and had led to the death of 20
people, he probably ought not be pardoned.
Yet, the National Council for Universal and Un
conditional Amnesty (NCUUA), is questioning
such a condition and according to a report by the
Department of Defense, only one per cent of the
AWOL's that paticipated in President Gerald
Ford's clemency program deserted from combat
situations.

Efforts to keep the amnesty issue alive on cam
pus have been weak and poorly attended. In
Madison. Wisconsin, at the University of Wiscon
sin, a July amnesty conference attracted only 40
workers. In September, 60 people attended a con
ference in Des Moines, lowa where the speaker
was a minister from the University of lowa.
President Ford's amnesty program does not
meet with approval by NCUUA which has called
the program a demonstration of "the power of the
President to upgrade the military discharges as
well as the futility of issuing amnesty or pardon
discharges." Arizona legislature has given par
ticipants in this program an especially difficult
time by passing a bill which prohibits clemency
discharge holders from getting publicly funded
jobs. And in Madison, Wisconsin state law re
quires county veterans affairs officers to have
honorable discharges.
Those who will be paying particular attention
to Carter's treatment of the amnesty issue will
include a reported 8700 convicted draft violators
who have served sentences, paid fines or gotten
suspended sentences. Ford's program excluded
these men and it is not clear whether or not Carter
will pay closer attention. The largest group of
draft violators are non-registrants who face up to
$10,000 or five years in jail. Neither Ford's nor
Carter's program include them.
And then there are the 792,000 veterans who
hold less than honorable discharges. These men
include the non-deserters who refused orders to
Vietnam, who talked questioningly about the war
or who even organized radical newspapers. The
fate of these men is as unclear as President Carter's
focus on the issue that simply will not go away.
Carter said in August, "Where I come from,
most of the men who went off to fight in Vietnam
were poor. They didn't have the money to hide
from the draft in college , . . the Vietnam veterans
are our nation's unsung heroes. "

$10,000 or five years in jail. Neither Ford's nor
Carter's program include them.
And then there are the 792,000 veterans who
hold less than honorable discharges. These men
include the non-deserters who refused orders to
Vietnam, who talked questioningly about the war
or who even organized radical newspapers. The
fate of these men is as unclear as President Carter's
focus on the issue that simply will not go away.
Carter said in August, "Where I come from,
most of the men who went off to fight in Vietnam
were poor. They didn't have the money to hide
from the draft in college , . . the Vietnam veterans
are our nation's unsung heroes. "
(CPS) — Now that the presidential elections are
over, it is only a matter of time until President
elect Jimmy Carter makes good on his campaign
promises of unconditional pardons to draft evad
ers.
The National Democratic Party platform called
for a "full and complete pardon for those who
were in legal or financial jeopardy becomes of
their peaceful opposition to the Vietnam War,
with deserters to be considered on a case-to-case
basis."
However, Carter said in September that he
would not be bound to the party platform and
would refuse to give pardons to draft non
registrants or to upgrade less than honorable dis
charges.
Earlier in his campaign, darter stated that "am
nesty means that . . . what you did was right. Par
don means what you did, whether it was right or
wrong, you're forgiven for it. And I do advocate a
pardon for draft evaders."
Stuart Eizenstat, Carter's Director of Policy and
Issues, claimed that the new administration's pol
icy is "not one of unconditional pardon for deser
ters" but would instead depend on several
criteria, one of which is whether or not the man
was deserting because of opposition to the war or
opposition to the Army itself. Such a condition
would be determined by a hearing officer,
Eizenstat said, and offering a hypothetical case he
added that if the man had deserted from the mid
dle of a key battle and had led to the death of 20
people, he probably ought not be pardoned.
Yet, the National Council for Universal and Un
conditional Amnesty (NCUUA), is questioning
such a condition and according to a report by the
Department of Defense, only one per cent of the
AWOL's that paticipated in President Gerald
Ford's clemency program deserted from combat
situations.

Efforts to keep the amnesty issue alive on cam
pus have been weak and poorly attended. In
Madison. Wisconsin, at the University of Wiscon
sin, a July amnesty conference attracted only 40
workers. In September, 60 people attended a con
ference in Des Moines, lowa where the speaker
was a minister from the University of lowa.
President Ford's amnesty program does not
meet with approval by NCUUA which has called
the program a demonstration of "the power of the
President to upgrade the military discharges as
well as the futility of issuing amnesty or pardon
discharges." Arizona legislature has given par
ticipants in this program an especially difficult
time by passing a bill which prohibits clemency
discharge holders from getting publicly funded
jobs. And in Madison, Wisconsin state law re
quires county veterans affairs officers to have
honorable discharges.
Those who will be paying particular attention
to Carter's treatment of the amnesty issue will
include a reported 8700 convicted draft violators
who have served sentences, paid fines or gotten
suspended sentences. Ford's program excluded
these men and it is not clear whether or not Carter
will pay closer attention. The largest group of
draft violators are non-registrants who face up to
$10,000 or five years in jail. Neither Ford's nor
Carter's program include them.
