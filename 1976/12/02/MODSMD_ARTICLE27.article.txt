i CPS J — Legends, according

■ ving legends, according to ta
'e:it agencies, are popular
money-makers.
Currently speaking before
!>;H ked houses of college stu
dents across the country,
Timothy Leary, dressed neck to
toe in white, speaks not of the
culture which he made a
household word in the sixties
but of space migration.
i.eary is best known for his re
search on the use of psilocybin
and other therapy to reduce con
vict recidivism. This proved too
controversial for the administra
tion at Harvard where he taught
and they dregged up an excuse
to bounce him. He soonbecamea
drug-guru of sorts for the mid
sixties flower children before
being busted for the possession
ol two marijuana roaches.
Sentenced to 20 years impris
onment, Leary escaped from a
top security prison and made his
way to Algeria, which turned out

to be just another prison. After
returning to the U.S., he spent
the noxt few years in a San Diego
prison before being paroled.
Members of the Weather Under
ground claim Learv was let loose
after ratting on some friends.
Leary denies it and says the un
derground would be grateful if it
could actually see his secret
court testimony.
So what's this new spiel?
Leary comes before his audi
ence hopped up on a new vision
based on science and engineer
ing. His slogan is 5.M.1.L.E., an
acronym for "Space Migration.
Intelligence Increase and Life
Extension." He believes that we
should start an all-out crash
program to build space cities
around the Earth, double the na
tional I.Q. and begin to prolong
life, with an eye on immortality,
through the aid of modern
medicine. All this with the fer
vor scientists used to create the
atomic bomb in the forties. Or so
Leary hopes.

Is Leary serious when he be
gins sprouting oft these "new,
visionary" thoughts of the fu
ture? Or is he just a famous ex
con, hustling up almost $2000
for each appearance?
Admittedly, his ideas about
space migration are not his own.
Kather, they come from a profes
sor of physics from Princeton
named Gerard O'Neill. O'Neill is
described as the counterpart of
what Leary was 15 years ago, a
man with new, outrageous ideas.
But to the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration
(NASA). O'Neill is being looked
to as a saviour for a beauracracy
sagging under waning public in
terest and decreased budgets.
In a book soon to be out on the
stands entitled The High Fron
tier, O'Neill says that the re
sources of the sun and the radia
tion belts surrounding earth can
be tapped for easy energy. He
claims that if we started now, the
U.S. could build huge cylinders,
serving as artificial satellites,
where people could live and

work, at relatively cheap costs.
Even though his ideas are receiv
ing prominent attention in such
periodicals as The National
(jeogruphic and The New York
Times Magazine, many scien
tists still look askance at his
theories.
But back to Learv.
Whether or not audiences are
buying Leary's new visions of
starflights and immortality, they
are pushing, shoving and buying
up tickets all along his campus
stops. At a recent appearance at
Tufts University in Mas
sachusetts. his speech was inter
rupted by gate-crashers who had
previously been turned away for
lack of room. Pouring in to hear
and see the ex-guru, students
scuffled with police and filled
the aisles.
It remains unclear as to
whether students are straining to
hear the man in white's words
for the future 01 merely fasci
nated to get a glimpse of the
reappearance of an American
legend.
