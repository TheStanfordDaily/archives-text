i understand from a Catholic friend that there
are patron saints for almost everything. However,
my friend didn't know how to go about finding out
who the patron saint is for what. Can you tell me
who the patron saint is for political scientists, and
where do you find information on patron saints
for various occupations, groups, etc.?
There is no official patron for political scientists
that I could find out about, but UNOFFICIALLY,
perhaps St. Thomas Aquinas may fit the bill. He's
the famous 13th century theologian who wrote
about laws and governments, and who is consi
dered the patron of scholars.
And if you're wondering what the difference
between an official and unofficial saint is, Connie
Butcher, secretary at Mem Chu, speculates that
"to be official, a saint must be proclaimed as such
straight from the Pope's mouth." More specifi
cally, there has to be two certified miracles that
can be attributed to the "candidate."
Angelus Bookstore (Menlo Park] owner Duke
Douglas, who has a wealth of knowledge on the
subject, cites the example of Father Junipero
Serra, founder of missions in California. Douglas
says the Church has been considering Serra for
sainthood for 30 years, but can find no provable
miracles to attribute to him. "It takes a lot of evi
dence to persuade those people in Rome," he ad
ded.
As for information on other patron saints, you
may want to try the library for a four-volume

sequence called Butier's Lives of the Saints. The
revised 1956 edition lists about 2500 patron
saints, ranging from protectors of funeral direc
tors to philosophers to, lo and behold, journalists.
And if your library hunt ends up fruitless, try
calling the librarian at Saint Patrick's Seminary in
Menlo Park. Or you may be able to talk the good
Mr. Douglas into digging around his own archives
a bit.
Is there riny reason why the traffic light at
Hanoverand Stanford Avenues stays red so long?
In a nutshell, that long traffic light is used as a
means of discouraging drivers who try to avoid
the long wait at the Page Mill turn-off down the
road by short-cutting through Stanford Avenue.
Traffic Engineer Ted Noguchi at the Palo Alto
Police Department, says that while this may not be
the best of solutions, it does tend to cut down on
the amount of passers-by. "Unfortunately, the
light affects all traffic since it can't discriminate,"
says Noguchi, and the people who live in that area
get, in a matter of speaking, the short end of the
deal.
As for a more popular solution, Noguchi says
they're putting the squeeze on the county by try
ing to get some improvements made at the Page
Mill-El Camino intersection. Noguchi suggested,
for example, installing left turn lanes from every
direction. Noguchi says, "That would speed up
traffic instead of making it queue in one line.""

dered the patron of scholars.
And if you're wondering what the difference
between an official and unofficial saint is, Connie
Butcher, secretary at Mem Chu, speculates that
"to be official, a saint must be proclaimed as such
straight from the Pope's mouth." More specifi
cally, there has to be two certified miracles that
can be attributed to the "candidate."
Angelus Bookstore (Menlo Park] owner Duke
Douglas, who has a wealth of knowledge on the
subject, cites the example of Father Junipero
Serra, founder of missions in California. Douglas
says the Church has been considering Serra for
sainthood for 30 years, but can find no provable
miracles to attribute to him. "It takes a lot of evi
dence to persuade those people in Rome," he ad
ded.
As for information on other patron saints, you
may want to try the library for a four-volume

sequence called Butier's Lives of the Saints. The
revised 1956 edition lists about 2500 patron
saints, ranging from protectors of funeral direc
tors to philosophers to, lo and behold, journalists.
And if your library hunt ends up fruitless, try
calling the librarian at Saint Patrick's Seminary in
Menlo Park. Or you may be able to talk the good
Mr. Douglas into digging around his own archives
a bit.
Is there riny reason why the traffic light at
Hanoverand Stanford Avenues stays red so long?
In a nutshell, that long traffic light is used as a
means of discouraging drivers who try to avoid
the long wait at the Page Mill turn-off down the
road by short-cutting through Stanford Avenue.
Traffic Engineer Ted Noguchi at the Palo Alto
Police Department, says that while this may not be
the best of solutions, it does tend to cut down on
the amount of passers-by. "Unfortunately, the
light affects all traffic since it can't discriminate,"
says Noguchi, and the people who live in that area
get, in a matter of speaking, the short end of the
deal.
As for a more popular solution, Noguchi says
they're putting the squeeze on the county by try
ing to get some improvements made at the Page
Mill-El Camino intersection. Noguchi suggested,
for example, installing left turn lanes from every
direction. Noguchi says, "That would speed up
traffic instead of making it queue in one line.""

i understand from a Catholic friend that there
are patron saints for almost everything. However,
my friend didn't know how to go about finding out
who the patron saint is for what. Can you tell me
who the patron saint is for political scientists, and
where do you find information on patron saints
for various occupations, groups, etc.?
There is no official patron for political scientists
that I could find out about, but UNOFFICIALLY,
perhaps St. Thomas Aquinas may fit the bill. He's
the famous 13th century theologian who wrote
about laws and governments, and who is consi
dered the patron of scholars.
