Riding high on the taped hands of a few Stanford
football players, the Axe, mythical momento of
Stanford-Cal athletic endeavors, returned home to the
Farm in the fading light of Berkeley's Memorial

Stadium last month. The prized posession will soon be
housed in a presumably burgler-proof display case,
thanks to the work of some dedicated students and
alumns.
