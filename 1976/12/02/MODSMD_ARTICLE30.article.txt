# Awareness in a male oriented society
## Women's Center offers support, concern 
### Barbara Anscher 
Though its supporters con
sider themselves feminists, the
Women's Center, a small, unpre
tentious room in the back of The
Bridge, is scarcely an intimidat
ing seat of radical feminist activ
ity.
"We want this room to be a
place where women can come
and crash," says Carla Lupi, a
sophomore devotee of the
center.
"Crashing" can take various
forms, from reading literature
about sex roles in the center's
library to participating in a
consciousness-raising group.
The women at the center em
phasize their concern about let
ting women know that there is a
place on campus that they can
come to for support.
Supportive environment
"The Women's Center is a
place for women to go to be in a
supportive environment, a place
where women can get energy

from each other," says Dee Buc
ciarelli, a graduate student man
aging the center on a work-study
basis.
Bucciarelli and those who
help her have organized ac
tivities which center around
"meeting women's various
needs which are peculiar to
them as women."
"Women's Centers are usually
run in collective form in which
groups of individuals who are
interested in one area get to
gether and participate in the ac
tivities that interest them," says
Lupi. "We hope our collectives
will be self-perpetuating."
So far, the center has been
successful in running
consciousness-raising (CR)
groups and will organize as
many as are necessary according
to the number of participants.
Currently two groups are meet
ing and a third is planned for
next quarter.
"CR groups can be really effec

tive. They're groups of between
six and 10 women who get to
gether to talk about sexist
things," explains Lupi, who
finds that much of the value of
the groups resides in learning
"that other women face a lot of
the same problems you do."
The center is planning to ex
tend its current programs to in
clude both a gynecological self
help clinic and feminist peer
counseling.
In all of the activities that the
Women's Center initiates, the
main emphasis is on awareness:
awareness of what it is to be a
woman in a male-oriented soci
ety and a male-dominated cam
pus. According to those active in
the center, consciousness among
Stanford women has dropped
considerably since the more ac
tivist era of the late '60s and early
'70s.
Changing focus
Jane Angeles, a freshman who
is also employed at the center on

a work-study basis, explains that
"the women's movement has
changed its focus. Women are
becoming more exposed to it na
tionally, but it has lost momen
tum at Stanford . . . People here
don't notice sexism unless it is
very blatant.''
Calling attention to the wo
men's movement does not
necessarily require radical polit
ical activities, claims Lupi.
"Raising the consciousness of
women here can take place at a
very minimal level," such as the
bi-monthly hag lunches with fa
culty women as guests, sonsored
by the center.
The women at the center all
agree that sex discrimination is
common at Stanford. "It's im
possible not to feel sexism," says
Lupi. "It's fashionable to say I
believe in equality,* but that's
not always reflected in actions."
Sometimes feminists can en
counter cruelty: "When they
find out 1 work here, some men

make some really terrible jokes.
I'heir attitude says something
about men not being able to ac
cept a successful woman," Lupi
claims.
Both sexes
She is quick to point out that
sexism applies to both sexes.
"Not only women are feminists.
A feminist is someone who's
conscious of sexism in our soci
ety and who is willing to break
out of roles and to meet the needs
of other people trying to do the
same thing. Humanist is a more
ideal word, but it can mean other
things."
Campus feminists of both
sexes hope to have their idea for
a co-ed feminist theme house
approved by the housing com
mittee this year. Androgyne
House, as they plan to call it,
would be a co-op, with house ac
tivities centering around
consciousness-raising groups.
Besides participation in the
groups, all residents would be

required to take at least two clas
ses pertaining to sex roles or
feminist issues.
Sponsors of the theme house
are confident that it can be filled,
but say that a lack of backing
from a particular department has
proven an obstacle. Stanford has
no Women's Studies Depart
ment.
Lack of support
A proposal for t he same type of
theme house was rejected last
year because of a lack of student
and faculty support. This year,
15 volunteers are circulating
petitions to demonstrate that
students are receptive to the
theme.
The males supporting An
drogyne House appear to be the
exception, not the rule. Being a
feminist is not easy, particularly
on a college campus where con
ventional social activities, such
as dating, are emphasized.
"You do feel separated some
times, you feel a sense of uncon

cern from other people," says
Lupi. "Often you find you are
justifying yourself, which is de
grading."
Feminists in the Women's
Center have chosen to combat
this sense of alienation by exp
laining feminism to those unex
posed to its concepts and by
supporting those who choose to
step out of the bounds of sex
roles.

about men not being able to ac
cept a successful woman," Lupi
claims.
Both sexes
She is quick to point out that
sexism applies to both sexes.
"Not only women are feminists.
A feminist is someone who's
conscious of sexism in our soci
ety and who is willing to break
out of roles and to meet the needs
of other people trying to do the
same thing. Humanist is a more
ideal word, but it can mean other
things."
Campus feminists of both
sexes hope to have their idea for
a co-ed feminist theme house
approved by the housing com
mittee this year. Androgyne
House, as they plan to call it,
would be a co-op, with house ac
tivities centering around
consciousness-raising groups.
Besides participation in the
groups, all residents would be

required to take at least two clas
ses pertaining to sex roles or
feminist issues.
Sponsors of the theme house
are confident that it can be filled,
but say that a lack of backing
from a particular department has
proven an obstacle. Stanford has
no Women's Studies Depart
ment.
Lack of support
A proposal for t he same type of
theme house was rejected last
year because of a lack of student
and faculty support. This year,
15 volunteers are circulating
petitions to demonstrate that
students are receptive to the
theme.
The males supporting An
drogyne House appear to be the
exception, not the rule. Being a
feminist is not easy, particularly
on a college campus where con
ventional social activities, such
as dating, are emphasized.
"You do feel separated some
times, you feel a sense of uncon

cern from other people," says
Lupi. "Often you find you are
justifying yourself, which is de
grading."
Feminists in the Women's
Center have chosen to combat
this sense of alienation by exp
laining feminism to those unex
posed to its concepts and by
supporting those who choose to
step out of the bounds of sex
roles.
Though its supporters con
sider themselves feminists, the
Women's Center, a small, unpre
tentious room in the back of The
Bridge, is scarcely an intimidat
ing seat of radical feminist activ
ity.
"We want this room to be a
place where women can come
and crash," says Carla Lupi, a
sophomore devotee of the
center.
"Crashing" can take various
forms, from reading literature
about sex roles in the center's
library to participating in a
consciousness-raising group.
The women at the center em
phasize their concern about let
ting women know that there is a
place on campus that they can
come to for support.
Supportive environment
"The Women's Center is a
place for women to go to be in a
supportive environment, a place
where women can get energy

from each other," says Dee Buc
ciarelli, a graduate student man
aging the center on a work-study
basis.
Bucciarelli and those who
help her have organized ac
tivities which center around
"meeting women's various
needs which are peculiar to
them as women."
"Women's Centers are usually
run in collective form in which
groups of individuals who are
interested in one area get to
gether and participate in the ac
tivities that interest them," says
Lupi. "We hope our collectives
will be self-perpetuating."
So far, the center has been
successful in running
consciousness-raising (CR)
groups and will organize as
many as are necessary according
to the number of participants.
Currently two groups are meet
ing and a third is planned for
next quarter.
"CR groups can be really effec

tive. They're groups of between
six and 10 women who get to
gether to talk about sexist
things," explains Lupi, who
finds that much of the value of
the groups resides in learning
"that other women face a lot of
the same problems you do."
The center is planning to ex
tend its current programs to in
clude both a gynecological self
help clinic and feminist peer
counseling.
In all of the activities that the
Women's Center initiates, the
main emphasis is on awareness:
awareness of what it is to be a
woman in a male-oriented soci
ety and a male-dominated cam
pus. According to those active in
the center, consciousness among
Stanford women has dropped
considerably since the more ac
tivist era of the late '60s and early
'70s.
Changing focus
Jane Angeles, a freshman who
is also employed at the center on

a work-study basis, explains that
"the women's movement has
changed its focus. Women are
becoming more exposed to it na
tionally, but it has lost momen
tum at Stanford . . . People here
don't notice sexism unless it is
very blatant.''
Calling attention to the wo
men's movement does not
necessarily require radical polit
ical activities, claims Lupi.
"Raising the consciousness of
women here can take place at a
very minimal level," such as the
bi-monthly hag lunches with fa
culty women as guests, sonsored
by the center.
The women at the center all
agree that sex discrimination is
common at Stanford. "It's im
possible not to feel sexism," says
Lupi. "It's fashionable to say I
believe in equality,* but that's
not always reflected in actions."
Sometimes feminists can en
counter cruelty: "When they
find out 1 work here, some men

make some really terrible jokes.

claims.

ing and a third is planned for
next quarter.
"CR groups can be really effec

tive. They're groups of between
six and 10 women who get to
gether to talk about sexist
things," explains Lupi, who
finds that much of the value of
the groups resides in learning
"that other women face a lot of
the same problems you do."
The center is planning to ex
tend its current programs to in
clude both a gynecological self
help clinic and feminist peer
counseling.
In all of the activities that the
Women's Center initiates, the
main emphasis is on awareness:
awareness of what it is to be a
woman in a male-oriented soci
ety and a male-dominated cam
pus. According to those active in
the center, consciousness among
Stanford women has dropped
considerably since the more ac
tivist era of the late '60s and early
'70s.
Changing focus
Jane Angeles, a freshman who
is also employed at the center on

a work-study basis, explains that
"the women's movement has
changed its focus. Women are
becoming more exposed to it na
tionally, but it has lost momen
tum at Stanford . . . People here
don't notice sexism unless it is
very blatant.''
Calling attention to the wo
men's movement does not
necessarily require radical polit
ical activities, claims Lupi.
"Raising the consciousness of
women here can take place at a
very minimal level," such as the
bi-monthly hag lunches with fa
culty women as guests, sonsored
by the center.
The women at the center all
agree that sex discrimination is
common at Stanford. "It's im
possible not to feel sexism," says
Lupi. "It's fashionable to say I
believe in equality,* but that's
not always reflected in actions."
Sometimes feminists can en
counter cruelty: "When they
find out 1 work here, some men

make some really terrible jokes.
I'heir attitude says something
about men not being able to ac
cept a successful woman," Lupi
claims.
Both sexes
She is quick to point out that
sexism applies to both sexes.
"Not only women are feminists.
A feminist is someone who's
conscious of sexism in our soci
ety and who is willing to break
out of roles and to meet the needs
of other people trying to do the
same thing. Humanist is a more
ideal word, but it can mean other
things."
Campus feminists of both
sexes hope to have their idea for
a co-ed feminist theme house
approved by the housing com
mittee this year. Androgyne
House, as they plan to call it,
would be a co-op, with house ac
tivities centering around
consciousness-raising groups.
Besides participation in the
groups, all residents would be

required to take at least two clas
ses pertaining to sex roles or
feminist issues.
Sponsors of the theme house
are confident that it can be filled,
but say that a lack of backing
from a particular department has
proven an obstacle. Stanford has
no Women's Studies Depart
ment.
Lack of support
A proposal for t he same type of
theme house was rejected last
year because of a lack of student
and faculty support. This year,
15 volunteers are circulating
petitions to demonstrate that
students are receptive to the
theme.
The males supporting An
drogyne House appear to be the
exception, not the rule. Being a
feminist is not easy, particularly
on a college campus where con
ventional social activities, such
as dating, are emphasized.
"You do feel separated some
times, you feel a sense of uncon

cern from other people," says
Lupi. "Often you find you are
justifying yourself, which is de
grading."
Feminists in the Women's
Center have chosen to combat
this sense of alienation by exp
laining feminism to those unex
posed to its concepts and by
supporting those who choose to
step out of the bounds of sex
roles.
Though its supporters con
sider themselves feminists, the
Women's Center, a small, unpre
tentious room in the back of The
Bridge, is scarcely an intimidat
ing seat of radical feminist activ
ity.
"We want this room to be a
place where women can come
and crash," says Carla Lupi, a
sophomore devotee of the
center.
"Crashing" can take various
forms, from reading literature
about sex roles in the center's
library to participating in a
consciousness-raising group.
The women at the center em
phasize their concern about let
ting women know that there is a
place on campus that they can
come to for support.
Supportive environment
"The Women's Center is a
place for women to go to be in a
supportive environment, a place
where women can get energy

from each other," says Dee Buc
ciarelli, a graduate student man
aging the center on a work-study
basis.
Bucciarelli and those who
help her have organized ac
tivities which center around
"meeting women's various
needs which are peculiar to
them as women."
"Women's Centers are usually
run in collective form in which
groups of individuals who are
interested in one area get to
gether and participate in the ac
tivities that interest them," says
Lupi. "We hope our collectives
will be self-perpetuating."
So far, the center has been
successful in running
consciousness-raising (CR)
groups and will organize as
many as are necessary according
to the number of participants.
Currently two groups are meet
ing and a third is planned for
next quarter.
"CR groups can be really effec

tive. They're groups of between
