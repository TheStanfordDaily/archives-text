## 'Pacific Overtures' at the Curran Play portrays stereotypes 
### Don Waldron 
Commodore Perry's expedi
tion to Japan as the subject of a
new musical show wedding
Japanese and American theatri
cal styles?
Pacific Overtures, the result of
this daring idea, portrays Japan's
headlong rush into the future by
borrowing elements from
Japanese kabuki and America
musical.
Despite a few rocky points,
Harold Prince, director and pro
ducer, John Weidman, author,
and Stephen Sondheim, com
poser and lyricist, succeed so
admirably that the New York
Drama Critics voted Pacific
Overtures Best Musical of the
Year for 1976.
To show the Japanese perspec
tive on the arrival of the Wester
ners, all roles, Westerners as
well as Japanese, are played by
Asian and Asian-American ac
tors. The Japanese characters are
portrayed in realistic fashion,
but, as if to revenge years of
Charlie Chan stereotyping in
Western cinema and stage, the
Western barbarians are por
trayed in glaring stereotypes.

The Dutch admiral comes sel
ling chocolate, tulips, wooden
shoes and windmills, and the
American admiral sings in a
condescending pidgin to a har
ried Japanese official.
Endless variety
All the players appear
and reappear in an endless
variety of roles. The star,
Mako, was nominated for a Tony
award for an excruciatingly de
manding performance as the
reciter-narrator, the Shogun, as
an American rickshow-seller,
and finally, as the Western
oriented Emperor Meiji. By his
continuous presence on the
stage, Mako unites the otherwise
disparate thread of the story,
from the opening plaintive
whisper of a Japanese flute to the
last chorus in the finale. His
commanding credibility in
adapting to all these roles more
than compensates for his total
lack of a singing voice.
Stephen Sondheim, the com
poser, has absorbed the mood of
Japanese music and adapted it to
his own mostly dissonant idiom.
Rarely does the combination
seem contrived. In a most artful

and gifted way, he integrates the
samisen with the violin, the
Japanese shakuhachi with the
Western flute.
Sondheim's musical and lyri
cal skills unite to make on of the
most thrilling finales I've ever
seen. Reflecting his politically
impotent role, the Emperor Meiji
is played by an actual puppet
until the finale. Reassuming his
long dormant power, the em
peror comes to life as the reciter
drops his ceremonial robes to re
veal himself in a regal Western
style military uniform. As the
newly assertive emperor, he
cries, "In the name of progress,
we will turn our back on ancient
ways, eliminate all obstacles
which hinder our develop
ment." We are catapulted into
the present as the entire cast ap
pears in business suits and mod
outfits singing of the dubious
rewards of Japan's industrializa
tion. They eye suspiciously the
century-old farmers who remind
them of their dying past.
Real ingenuity
The costumes and set design
display extraordinary ingenuity
in incorporating Japanese forms

without seeming overly gim
micky. Commodore Perry wears
a four-foot long white wig, the
symbol of a villain in Japanese
kabuki. The runway (hanamichi)
to the stage constantly flows
with soldiers, samurai and
townspeople, bringing the ac
tion into closer contact with the
audience. Sets, props, even dead
characters are moved on and off
stagfc by "invisible" stagehands
clad in black, the color of non
existence in Japanese kabuki.
One drawback of the play is its
length. There are simply too
many trivial scenes included for
their sheer gimmickry, as for
example a scene showing the
people escaping from the West
ern barbarians with a two
manned horse. By eliminating
such scenes, the two-and-a-half
hour play could be pared to two
hours, heightening the dramatic
impetus of the whole..
Too moralistic?
The theme of Japan's aban
donment to the questionable vir
tues of industrialization be
comes overly moralistic at times,
nearly implying that Japan was
better off before that fateful day
when Perry's men iirst trod on
the beach at Uraga. Japan is por
trayed as idyllic and ignorant of
the Western world and the
Japanese are portrayed as con
tentedly painting screens, ex
changing poems, viewing the
moon, arranging flowers and
stirring tea. Granted these
stereotypes are presented with a
touch of irony, but why ignore
the facts? By 1853, peasant up
risings, a high rate of inflation, a
restless malaise among the un
employed samurai and an inef
fective government bureaucracy
were a way of life in Japan. Isn't
it time in 1976 to scrap the
"queer and quaint" painted
screen stereotypes of the
century-old Mikado?
Despite my disagreement with
the creators' historical approach,
Pacific Overtures displays a un
iquely creative cross-cultural
perspective rarely seen in the
annals of American musical
theatre. With minor cast
changes, the Theatre
production is identical with the
award-winning original on
Broadway. It is well worth the
cost of the trip to San Francisco
and the $2.50 student rush tic
kets usually available for week
night performances.

Despite a few rocky points,
Harold Prince, director and pro
ducer, John Weidman, author,
and Stephen Sondheim, com
poser and lyricist, succeed so
admirably that the New York
Drama Critics voted Pacific
Overtures Best Musical of the
Year for 1976.
To show the Japanese perspec
tive on the arrival of the Wester
ners, all roles, Westerners as
well as Japanese, are played by
Asian and Asian-American ac
tors. The Japanese characters are
portrayed in realistic fashion,
but, as if to revenge years of
Charlie Chan stereotyping in
Western cinema and stage, the
Western barbarians are por
trayed in glaring stereotypes.

The Dutch admiral comes sel
ling chocolate, tulips, wooden
shoes and windmills, and the
American admiral sings in a
condescending pidgin to a har
ried Japanese official.
Endless variety
All the players appear
and reappear in an endless
variety of roles. The star,
Mako, was nominated for a Tony
award for an excruciatingly de
manding performance as the
reciter-narrator, the Shogun, as
an American rickshow-seller,
and finally, as the Western
oriented Emperor Meiji. By his
continuous presence on the
stage, Mako unites the otherwise
disparate thread of the story,
from the opening plaintive
whisper of a Japanese flute to the
last chorus in the finale. His
commanding credibility in
adapting to all these roles more
than compensates for his total
lack of a singing voice.
Stephen Sondheim, the com
poser, has absorbed the mood of
Japanese music and adapted it to
his own mostly dissonant idiom.
Rarely does the combination
seem contrived. In a most artful

and gifted way, he integrates the
samisen with the violin, the
Japanese shakuhachi with the
Western flute.
Sondheim's musical and lyri
cal skills unite to make on of the
most thrilling finales I've ever
seen. Reflecting his politically
impotent role, the Emperor Meiji
is played by an actual puppet
until the finale. Reassuming his
long dormant power, the em
peror comes to life as the reciter
drops his ceremonial robes to re
veal himself in a regal Western
style military uniform. As the
newly assertive emperor, he
cries, "In the name of progress,
we will turn our back on ancient
ways, eliminate all obstacles
which hinder our develop
ment." We are catapulted into
the present as the entire cast ap
pears in business suits and mod
outfits singing of the dubious
rewards of Japan's industrializa
tion. They eye suspiciously the
century-old farmers who remind
them of their dying past.
Real ingenuity
The costumes and set design
display extraordinary ingenuity
in incorporating Japanese forms

without seeming overly gim
micky. Commodore Perry wears
a four-foot long white wig, the
symbol of a villain in Japanese
kabuki. The runway (hanamichi)
to the stage constantly flows
with soldiers, samurai and
townspeople, bringing the ac
tion into closer contact with the
audience. Sets, props, even dead
characters are moved on and off
stagfc by "invisible" stagehands
clad in black, the color of non
existence in Japanese kabuki.
One drawback of the play is its
length. There are simply too
many trivial scenes included for
their sheer gimmickry, as for
example a scene showing the
people escaping from the West
ern barbarians with a two
manned horse. By eliminating
such scenes, the two-and-a-half
hour play could be pared to two
hours, heightening the dramatic
impetus of the whole..
Too moralistic?
The theme of Japan's aban
donment to the questionable vir
tues of industrialization be
comes overly moralistic at times,
nearly implying that Japan was
better off before that fateful day
when Perry's men iirst trod on
the beach at Uraga. Japan is por
trayed as idyllic and ignorant of
the Western world and the
Japanese are portrayed as con
tentedly painting screens, ex
changing poems, viewing the
moon, arranging flowers and
stirring tea. Granted these
stereotypes are presented with a
touch of irony, but why ignore
the facts? By 1853, peasant up
risings, a high rate of inflation, a
restless malaise among the un
employed samurai and an inef
fective government bureaucracy
were a way of life in Japan. Isn't
it time in 1976 to scrap the
"queer and quaint" painted
screen stereotypes of the
century-old Mikado?
Despite my disagreement with
the creators' historical approach,
Pacific Overtures displays a un
iquely creative cross-cultural
perspective rarely seen in the
annals of American musical
theatre. With minor cast
changes, the Theatre
production is identical with the
award-winning original on
Broadway. It is well worth the
cost of the trip to San Francisco
and the $2.50 student rush tic
kets usually available for week
night performances.

ners, all roles, Westerners as
well as Japanese, are played by
Asian and Asian-American ac
tors. The Japanese characters are
portrayed in realistic fashion,
but, as if to revenge years of
Charlie Chan stereotyping in
Western cinema and stage, the
Western barbarians are por
trayed in glaring stereotypes.

The Dutch admiral comes sel
ling chocolate, tulips, wooden
shoes and windmills, and the
American admiral sings in a
condescending pidgin to a har
ried Japanese official.
Endless variety
All the players appear
and reappear in an endless
variety of roles. The star,
Mako, was nominated for a Tony
award for an excruciatingly de
manding performance as the
reciter-narrator, the Shogun, as
an American rickshow-seller,
and finally, as the Western
oriented Emperor Meiji. By his
continuous presence on the
stage, Mako unites the otherwise
disparate thread of the story,
from the opening plaintive
whisper of a Japanese flute to the
last chorus in the finale. His
commanding credibility in
adapting to all these roles more
than compensates for his total
lack of a singing voice.
Stephen Sondheim, the com
poser, has absorbed the mood of
Japanese music and adapted it to
his own mostly dissonant idiom.
Rarely does the combination
seem contrived. In a most artful

and gifted way, he integrates the
samisen with the violin, the
Japanese shakuhachi with the
Western flute.
Sondheim's musical and lyri
cal skills unite to make on of the
most thrilling finales I've ever
seen. Reflecting his politically
impotent role, the Emperor Meiji
is played by an actual puppet
until the finale. Reassuming his
long dormant power, the em
peror comes to life as the reciter
drops his ceremonial robes to re
veal himself in a regal Western
style military uniform. As the
newly assertive emperor, he
cries, "In the name of progress,
we will turn our back on ancient
ways, eliminate all obstacles
which hinder our develop
ment." We are catapulted into
the present as the entire cast ap
pears in business suits and mod
outfits singing of the dubious
rewards of Japan's industrializa
tion. They eye suspiciously the
century-old farmers who remind
them of their dying past.
Real ingenuity
The costumes and set design
display extraordinary ingenuity
in incorporating Japanese forms

without seeming overly gim
micky. Commodore Perry wears
a four-foot long white wig, the
symbol of a villain in Japanese
kabuki. The runway (hanamichi)
to the stage constantly flows
with soldiers, samurai and
townspeople, bringing the ac
tion into closer contact with the
audience. Sets, props, even dead
characters are moved on and off
stagfc by "invisible" stagehands
clad in black, the color of non
existence in Japanese kabuki.
One drawback of the play is its
length. There are simply too
many trivial scenes included for
their sheer gimmickry, as for
example a scene showing the
people escaping from the West
ern barbarians with a two
manned horse. By eliminating
such scenes, the two-and-a-half
hour play could be pared to two
hours, heightening the dramatic
impetus of the whole..
Too moralistic?
The theme of Japan's aban
donment to the questionable vir
tues of industrialization be
comes overly moralistic at times,
nearly implying that Japan was
better off before that fateful day
when Perry's men iirst trod on
the beach at Uraga. Japan is por
trayed as idyllic and ignorant of
the Western world and the
Japanese are portrayed as con
tentedly painting screens, ex
changing poems, viewing the
moon, arranging flowers and
stirring tea. Granted these
stereotypes are presented with a
touch of irony, but why ignore
the facts? By 1853, peasant up
risings, a high rate of inflation, a
restless malaise among the un
employed samurai and an inef
fective government bureaucracy
were a way of life in Japan. Isn't
it time in 1976 to scrap the
"queer and quaint" painted
screen stereotypes of the
century-old Mikado?
Despite my disagreement with
the creators' historical approach,
Pacific Overtures displays a un
iquely creative cross-cultural
perspective rarely seen in the
annals of American musical
theatre. With minor cast
changes, the Theatre
production is identical with the
award-winning original on
Broadway. It is well worth the
cost of the trip to San Francisco
and the $2.50 student rush tic
kets usually available for week
night performances.
Commodore Perry's expedi
tion to Japan as the subject of a
new musical show wedding
Japanese and American theatri
cal styles?
Pacific Overtures, the result of
this daring idea, portrays Japan's
headlong rush into the future by
borrowing elements from
Japanese kabuki and America
musical.
Despite a few rocky points,
Harold Prince, director and pro
ducer, John Weidman, author,
and Stephen Sondheim, com
poser and lyricist, succeed so
admirably that the New York
Drama Critics voted Pacific
Overtures Best Musical of the
Year for 1976.
