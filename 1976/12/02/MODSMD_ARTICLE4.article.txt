# Big Game bauble is back
## Staff rebuilding Axe display case 
### Karen Wada 
The Stanford Axe will be put on dis
play in its traditional first-floor exhibi
tion case at Tressidder Union before
the winter quarter, according to one of
three university employes who have
volunteered to make the case harder to
break into.
The staff member, who asked that he
and his colleagues remain anonym
ous, would not reveal any details ex
cept that the inavailability of certain
construction parts may delay the pro
ject's completion.
Until the modifications are finished,
the axe will be kept at the Dept. of Pub
lic Safety's Serra Street office, accord
ing to the Dept. of Public Safety Capt.
Raon Niemeyer. He warned "Cal or
anyone else" against trying to steal the
trophy, since it is "under lock and key
. . . with someone around it 24 hours a
day." He also noted that "anyone who
was caught comitting criminal acts
would probably be prosecuted."
Complicated journey
The axe reached the office after what
pieced-together eyewitness reports
indicate was a confusing trip from
Berkeley to Palo Alto.
Some persons thought the plaque
had been taken home by the football
team captains, while other said head
football coach Jack Christiansen had it.
The ASSU, the Inter-Fraternity

Council president, the football team
and the Athletic Department could not
locate the axe.
Thomas Massev, director of student
activites, finally traced it to the De
partment of Public Safety.
The display-case remodeling project
was started last year when Axe Com
mission chairperson Claudia Temby
asked the three staff members to de
sign a better case.
Alarm system
Using funds from the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Office, the exhibit desig
ners are installing a new alarm system
and strengthening the original de
fenses.
"The old case was poorly-built and
inadequate," the staff member
explained. "If you knew its secret, you
could get into it in about 60 seconds. In
fact, I think five or six years ago, Cal
took the axe right out."
Since then, whenever Stanford has
won the Big Game, he said the axe has
been kept in the Wells Fargo Bank
vault on campus. "This doesn't fit the
tradition, though The winning school
should display the axe — that's part of
the game. You have to design the per
fect case and invite the opponents to
steal it," said the staff member.
Playing the "axe game" has intrigued
the three display-case designers, two
of whom are alumni. The staff member

recalled years of "futile pipe dreams"
and careful study into breaking into
Cal's axe case.
Cal has kept the axe in a student
union display case, which the staff
member called "damned good." He in
sisted that the new Tresidder model
will beat least as theft-proof. "It'll offer
potential burglars a lot of surprises,"
he said.
The new display case may be the last

project of the Axe Commission which
Temby said she felt is "dying because
of insufficient student support."
Originally responsible for spirit ral
lies and card stunts during football
games, the committee now handles
only the safe-keeping of the axe.

of whom are alumni. The staff member

recalled years of "futile pipe dreams"
and careful study into breaking into
Cal's axe case.
Cal has kept the axe in a student
union display case, which the staff
member called "damned good." He in
sisted that the new Tresidder model
will beat least as theft-proof. "It'll offer
potential burglars a lot of surprises,"
he said.
The new display case may be the last

project of the Axe Commission which
Temby said she felt is "dying because
of insufficient student support."
Originally responsible for spirit ral
lies and card stunts during football
games, the committee now handles
only the safe-keeping of the axe.
Temby, the only person on this
year's committee, and does not know
what will replace her next year.
The Stanford Axe will be put on dis
play in its traditional first-floor exhibi
tion case at Tressidder Union before
the winter quarter, according to one of
three university employes who have
volunteered to make the case harder to
break into.
The staff member, who asked that he
and his colleagues remain anonym
ous, would not reveal any details ex
cept that the inavailability of certain
construction parts may delay the pro
ject's completion.
Until the modifications are finished,
the axe will be kept at the Dept. of Pub
lic Safety's Serra Street office, accord
ing to the Dept. of Public Safety Capt.
Raon Niemeyer. He warned "Cal or
anyone else" against trying to steal the
trophy, since it is "under lock and key
. . . with someone around it 24 hours a
day." He also noted that "anyone who
was caught comitting criminal acts
would probably be prosecuted."
Complicated journey
The axe reached the office after what
pieced-together eyewitness reports
indicate was a confusing trip from
Berkeley to Palo Alto.
Some persons thought the plaque
had been taken home by the football
team captains, while other said head
football coach Jack Christiansen had it.
The ASSU, the Inter-Fraternity

Council president, the football team
and the Athletic Department could not
locate the axe.
Thomas Massev, director of student
activites, finally traced it to the De
partment of Public Safety.
The display-case remodeling project
was started last year when Axe Com
mission chairperson Claudia Temby
asked the three staff members to de
sign a better case.
Alarm system
Using funds from the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Office, the exhibit desig
ners are installing a new alarm system
and strengthening the original de
fenses.
"The old case was poorly-built and
inadequate," the staff member
explained. "If you knew its secret, you
could get into it in about 60 seconds. In
fact, I think five or six years ago, Cal
took the axe right out."
Since then, whenever Stanford has
won the Big Game, he said the axe has
been kept in the Wells Fargo Bank
vault on campus. "This doesn't fit the
tradition, though The winning school
should display the axe — that's part of
the game. You have to design the per
fect case and invite the opponents to
steal it," said the staff member.
