# Nimoy unenlightens press, doesn't cooperate
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
Leonard Nimoy breezed into
the tiny auditorium 90 minutes
late due to a communications
breakdown. He was no longer
the cool, unemotional Mr. Spock
from Star Trek, nor was he the
gentle, open man 1 would have
expected Leonard Nimoy, lec
turer, actor, writer and poet to
be.
Addressing an inquisitive
group of reporters and Trekkies
(the latter proportionately over
represented because most of the
press had better things to do than
scarf hors d'oeurves for 90 mi
nutes), Nimoy presented the
very personification of un
cooperative.
Disdaining any further eye
contact after acknowledging
anyone's presence (and thus
preventing follow-up ques
tions). he tossed off sarcastically
witty and curt, uninformative
answers.
His favorite gambit consisted

of reversing the evening's roles,
skewering the interviewer with
that famous piercing look and a
speedy, "Why do you ask that?"
or "What do you think?" or
"Why is that important to you?"
The Trekkies had patiently
gathered in costume to present
Nimoy with an engraving of
Snoopy riding on the starship
Enterprise. Nimoy perfunctorily
greeted them with a crooked
smile and cracked, "Where'd
you get the funny clothes?" He
singled out one brightly
spangled student who asked
several anxious questions and
smirked, "You've got a lot of
brass there, fellow," pleased, n.o
doubt, with bis double entendre.
One little girl, no more than
five years old, asked, "Where are
your ears?" Everyone laughed,
because it was the question most
sane people assume Nimoy
doesn't want to hear. Nimoy
shrugged, "Someone had to
have the guts to ask that ques

tion." He turned to the little girl
and answered, "They're out
being sharpened."
Brusque
Asked what exactly he was
doing with his time, Nimoy let
the question bounce off him with
a typically brusque reply that
said little if anything. He said,
"I'm trying to avoid working as
much as possible," moving on to
a new question without giving
the opportunity to delve for a
more elaborate answer. He acted
as if every question was an af
front to his privacy and as if he'd
been coerced into giving a press
conference.
Finally pressed for an answer,
he listed his activities with all
the desire of a student facing fi
nals, mentioning lectures, plays
like Sherlock Homes and My
Fairlxidy, his television series In
Search Of .. . , a forthcoming
book, We're All Children - Are
We Or Aren't We, a master's de
gree at Antioch College, and fly
ing ("I fly whatever 1 can get my
hands on").
No difficulties
As for the reputed feature film
Paramount Pictures is produc
ing from the Star Trek series —
the cfhly time a television show
would have spawned a movie
rather than vice versa — Nimoy
coyly denied he was having dif
ficulties negotiating with the
studio. He said he would accept
a contract "as soon as they make
me the right offer." But no, there
were no difficulties.
He has reconciled himself
with being Mr. Spock. and is un
derstandably proud to have been
part of Star Trek. "I'm not a
philosopher or a sociologist," he
said, "but I can't help but believe
that Star Trek offers something
more to society than cop and
doctor shows, which are not hi ng
more than well-developed soap
operas."
But with Star Trek's and thus
his own fame, Nimoy says that
often "finding periods of time
that are mine is extremely dif
ficult." As for the future, he says,
"I could be very happy without
acting right now. It's not the
most important thing in my
life." And as for all the other ac
tivities to which he devotes his
energies, "I take the challenges
as they come."
