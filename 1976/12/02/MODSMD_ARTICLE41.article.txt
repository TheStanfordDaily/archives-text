# Need a job in theater?

### 
Can you juggle?
Can you sing, dance, tumble, or clown around?
Or are your talents more on the mundane side?
Maybe you can just sing in the shower but can
play a mean piano?
If you are a frustrated "variety artist" of some
sort and you are seeking employment, you need
look no further than right here. Marriott's Great
America (yes. the amusement park) in Santa Clara
could have just the job you're looking for.
According to Susan Hathaway, staff writer in
Great America's publicity department, people
with talent of any kind, plus theatrical support
people such as those who like to work in war
drobe, lighting, or sound departments are needed
for the 14 new shows that will open in mid-March
when the amusement park begins its second sea
son.
Four hundred people are needed to get these
shows on the road. The positions are all paid, and
they are just on weekends during the spring and
next fall, and full-time during the summer.
"Over 2.5 million people saw the shows this
season," said Hathaway." Seeing as Great

America has only been open 150 days, this is quite
a total.
"A lot (of the performers) have gone on to better
positions," Hathaway said, mentioning the fact
that Hollywood producers have been known to
frequent the performance halls.
She stressed the need for back-up musicians as
well as featured soloists, and also emphasized
that all kinds of instruments are needed in the
various shows, not just your basic piano
percussion-guitar combos.
For those who yearn to show their talent to the
world (or. at least Santa Clara), auditions will be
held at Great America on Friday, Dec. 3 from 6-9
pm. Saturday, Dec. 4. from lOam-lOpm and Sun
day. Dec. 5 from noon-6 pm in the Grand Music
Hall. The park is located on the Great America
Parkway off U.S. 101 in Santa Clara, and you can
park in the regular lot.
Thos interested in doing the theatrical support
work (lighting, sound, etc.) should send resumes
to Marriott's Great America. Show Operations
Department, P.O. Box 1776, Santa Clara, 95052.
