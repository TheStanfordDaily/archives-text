# LaBelle draws kinky, strange glitter crowd

Laßelle — in French, it means
"the beautiful."
But last Saturday night, it
meant the bizarre, the kinky, the
unusual, the wild . . . and the
beautiful as the "glitter-souled"
ladies called Laßelle performed
at the Paramount Theater in Oak
land.
Their performance was
scheduled to begin at 8:00 p.m.,
but The Show was into full
swing long before that.
In the hours preceding the cur
tain, the spacious bar-lounge in
the basement of the theater was a
showcase for Bay Area freedom
and stylish "stuff-struttin" .
A typical tranquil cocktail
party-like atmosphere clogged
the air of the room. Mostly chit
chat and casual huggie-kissie
greetings were in vogue for the
hour.
'Glittered 1
As curtain time drew nearer,
however, the hard-core "glit
tered" followers who have
come to be symbolic of the "free
expression" mood of Laßelle de
scended into the crowd.
Couples, usually consisting of
two men, one dressed to fit
"her", the other to fit him
mingled through with greetings.
But there were some dressed
in the "macho" style with
leather outfits, beards and

cigars.
Transvestites were "out" for
the evening in eye-stunning col
ored wigs, short skirts, make-up
and glasses that would put El
ton's collection to shame.
It was definitely a night for the
folks in the crowd. And Laßelle,
"their goddesses," as some cal
led them, gave them what they
came to see.
Not to be outdone by their dis
ciples, the ladies, led by magnet
ically stunning lead singer Patty
Labelle, cast a two-hour musical
spell over the crowd which left
all drained if not almost dead.
Silver soprano
Fatty is supported by Nona
Hendrix, who provides a smooth
ajto harmony, and by Sara
Dash, who rounds out the trio
with a soprano tone which
seems to "float past the silver
stage to platinum," according to
Patty.
After an electrifying opening
number by the group's six
member back-up band, Laßelle
was raised from behind the state,
seen only under an eerie blue
haze through a semi-transparent
screen painted with an abstract
form.
Through it all could be heard
that beautifully strong and har
monic style which brought them
from entertainment oblivion to
fame in just a few months.

With Come Into My Life, the
ladies stepped out and showed
the folks what they had come to
see.
Sara was elegant in a skin
tight gown which flowed from
the hip with white satin. Nona
strode across the stage in a
fringed vest, old-style air pilots'
goggles and boots —all white —
which covered all but the up
permost part of her thighs. And
Patty stood alone in an outfit
which resembled something Big
Bird might wear to the prom —
again, all white.
Musical high
Together, the ladies drove the
primed crowd to a musical high
from which it could not come
down until the house lights
came up.
At times, the sounds were al
most unbearably loud, the words
getting lost in the amplification.
The worshipers, however, never
misunderstood.
Laßelle pranced through their
hits with well-timed theatrics
and expertly trimmed solos both
by themselves and their indi
vidual band members.
Koran encore, Laßelle let loose
with a pulsating version of their
biggest hit, Lady Marmelade,
with its familiar theme line,
"Voulez-vous couchez avec moi,
ce soir?"
Mais oui.

ton's collection to shame.
It was definitely a night for the
folks in the crowd. And Laßelle,
"their goddesses," as some cal
led them, gave them what they
came to see.
Not to be outdone by their dis
ciples, the ladies, led by magnet
ically stunning lead singer Patty
Labelle, cast a two-hour musical
spell over the crowd which left
all drained if not almost dead.
Silver soprano
Fatty is supported by Nona
Hendrix, who provides a smooth
ajto harmony, and by Sara
Dash, who rounds out the trio
with a soprano tone which
seems to "float past the silver
stage to platinum," according to
Patty.
After an electrifying opening
number by the group's six
member back-up band, Laßelle
was raised from behind the state,
seen only under an eerie blue
haze through a semi-transparent
screen painted with an abstract
form.
Through it all could be heard
that beautifully strong and har
monic style which brought them
from entertainment oblivion to
fame in just a few months.

With Come Into My Life, the
ladies stepped out and showed
the folks what they had come to
see.
Sara was elegant in a skin
tight gown which flowed from
the hip with white satin. Nona
strode across the stage in a
fringed vest, old-style air pilots'
goggles and boots —all white —
which covered all but the up
permost part of her thighs. And
Patty stood alone in an outfit
which resembled something Big
Bird might wear to the prom —
again, all white.
Musical high
Together, the ladies drove the
primed crowd to a musical high
from which it could not come
down until the house lights
came up.
At times, the sounds were al
most unbearably loud, the words
getting lost in the amplification.
The worshipers, however, never
misunderstood.
Laßelle pranced through their
hits with well-timed theatrics
and expertly trimmed solos both
by themselves and their indi
vidual band members.
Koran encore, Laßelle let loose
with a pulsating version of their
biggest hit, Lady Marmelade,
with its familiar theme line,
"Voulez-vous couchez avec moi,
ce soir?"
Mais oui.

Laßelle — in French, it means
"the beautiful."
But last Saturday night, it
meant the bizarre, the kinky, the
unusual, the wild . . . and the
beautiful as the "glitter-souled"
ladies called Laßelle performed
at the Paramount Theater in Oak
land.
Their performance was
scheduled to begin at 8:00 p.m.,
but The Show was into full
swing long before that.
In the hours preceding the cur
tain, the spacious bar-lounge in
the basement of the theater was a
showcase for Bay Area freedom
and stylish "stuff-struttin" .
A typical tranquil cocktail
party-like atmosphere clogged
the air of the room. Mostly chit
chat and casual huggie-kissie
greetings were in vogue for the
hour.
'Glittered 1
As curtain time drew nearer,
however, the hard-core "glit
tered" followers who have
come to be symbolic of the "free
expression" mood of Laßelle de
scended into the crowd.
Couples, usually consisting of
two men, one dressed to fit
"her", the other to fit him
mingled through with greetings.
But there were some dressed
in the "macho" style with
leather outfits, beards and

cigars.
Transvestites were "out" for
the evening in eye-stunning col
ored wigs, short skirts, make-up
and glasses that would put El
ton's collection to shame.
