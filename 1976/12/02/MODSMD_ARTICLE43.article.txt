# Williams' drama in S.F.
## 
### BoB Henry BoB Henry 
The Glass Menagerie is part
of a small Tennessee Wil
liams festival going on at the
Showcase Theatre is San
-Francisco, and the produc
tion presents an opportunity
to see a solid, commendable
realization of one of Ameri
ca's finest scripts. Strong act
ing and estimable directing
let Williams' artistry shine
forth as the playwright
explores family relationships
and personal dreams.
The dramatic action occurs
in the memory of Tom
Wingfield, the son. He has left
his sister Laura and his
mother Amanda, and he nar
rates as the action leading up
to his departure is enacted.
Craved adventure
While with the family, he
worked at a warehouse and
went to the movies to get the
excitement and adventure he
craved. He left home in an ef
fort to find that adventure.
Laura, a shy, slighty
crippled girl in her mid-20's,
lives in a fantasy world
dominated by old record al
bums and a collection of
small glass animals. She is a
creature too delicate for the
harsh, brutal real world and
she retreats to her make
believe existence.
Amanda wants only hap
piness for her son and daugh
ter, but she cannot supply
them with what they want. In
an effort to add some happi
ness to her own life she re
minisces about her joyful
youth.
Fine job
The cast does a fine job in
developing all aspects of the
characters. Tom (Fred Ward)
struggles with the decision of
whether to satisfy his own
needs or to stay and help his
mother and sister, and as the
narrator lie struggles with the
haunting memories of his sis
ter.
Amand.j (Olwen Morgan,
who alternates with Marjorie
Ross) is a blend of the desner

ate, bitchy and loving mother,
and Laura (Patricia Boyette)
sometimes leaves her world
to talk with Tom or the robust
and vigorous Gentleman Cal
ler (Bernard Bolter). All the
actors make their characters
believable and mutli-faceted.
Director Doyne Mraz has a
firm grasp of Williams' poetic
images and symbols and
wonderfully illuminates
much of the script. His unob
trusive and varied blocking
fits in excellently.
Larkspur Ltd. has produced
a solid, well-acted version of
The Glass Menagerie.

Tennesee Williams is back
in town with a new script.
Last year he brought This Is
(An Entertainment) to ACT;
this year he hasbrought a new
version of The Tivo-Character
Play to the Showcase Theatre.
This new The Two-
Character Play is intriguing,
if not always exciting. Wil
liams has called the play "the
interior landscape of the most
terrible period of my life ... a
play in which 1 am very
deeply emotionally in
volved," and it sketches a
time in which he suffered

through physical and emo
tional agony before entering a
sani tori um.
The show intrigues not
only because it reveals the
more private sections of the
life of one of America's finest
playwrights, but also because
it cleverly deals with the dif
ferences and similarities bet
ween reality and illusion. Un
fortunately, it often gets bog
ged down and fails to develop
either the situation or the
ideas sufficiently.
A brother, Felice and his
sister have been deserted by
the members of their travel
ing theatre troup, so they de
cide to perform their
scheduled play without all
the neccessary props or any
backstage help. Their delicate
relationship, wavering bet
ween love and hate, is further
strained by the difficult situa
tion and Clare's insistence to
cut part of the script, which
Felice has written.
During their performance,
Felice and Clare (played by
Fred Ward and Patricia
Boyette) wander among play
ing their characters and play
ing themselves, speaking
their lines and speaking
spontaneous thoughts, and
living illusion and living re
ality.
Ward and Boyette do an ex
cellent job protraying the
characters and their con
stantly fluctuating emotions.
They both are strong but vul
nerable and caring but gruff.
Director Jay Leo Colt uses
many of Williams' theatrical
devices well, but too often the
pondering quality of the
script seems to defeat him.
The approach the audience
is supposed to take, however,
appears to be to simply ex
perience the changing emo
tions of the two characters
and not to try to understand
all theallusionsand meaning
of the play. Seen in this light.
The Tivo-Chnractpr Play is an
intriguing and fascinating
work.

volved," and it sketches a
time in which he suffered

through physical and emo
tional agony before entering a
sani tori um.
The show intrigues not
only because it reveals the
more private sections of the
life of one of America's finest
playwrights, but also because
it cleverly deals with the dif
ferences and similarities bet
ween reality and illusion. Un
fortunately, it often gets bog
ged down and fails to develop
either the situation or the
ideas sufficiently.
A brother, Felice and his
sister have been deserted by
the members of their travel
ing theatre troup, so they de
cide to perform their
scheduled play without all
the neccessary props or any
backstage help. Their delicate
relationship, wavering bet
ween love and hate, is further
strained by the difficult situa
tion and Clare's insistence to
cut part of the script, which
Felice has written.
During their performance,
Felice and Clare (played by
Fred Ward and Patricia
Boyette) wander among play
ing their characters and play
ing themselves, speaking
their lines and speaking
spontaneous thoughts, and
living illusion and living re
ality.
Ward and Boyette do an ex
cellent job protraying the
characters and their con
stantly fluctuating emotions.
They both are strong but vul
nerable and caring but gruff.
Director Jay Leo Colt uses
many of Williams' theatrical
devices well, but too often the
pondering quality of the
script seems to defeat him.
The approach the audience
is supposed to take, however,
appears to be to simply ex
perience the changing emo
tions of the two characters
and not to try to understand
all theallusionsand meaning
of the play. Seen in this light.
The Tivo-Chnractpr Play is an
intriguing and fascinating
work.

Olwen Morgan plays a spacy but sweet Amanda Winafield
in the Showcase Theater production of The Glass
Menagerie, which will run through Dec. 12.
The Glass Menagerie is part
of a small Tennessee Wil
liams festival going on at the
Showcase Theatre is San
-Francisco, and the produc
tion presents an opportunity
to see a solid, commendable
realization of one of Ameri
ca's finest scripts. Strong act
ing and estimable directing
let Williams' artistry shine
forth as the playwright
explores family relationships
and personal dreams.
The dramatic action occurs
in the memory of Tom
Wingfield, the son. He has left
his sister Laura and his
mother Amanda, and he nar
rates as the action leading up
to his departure is enacted.
Craved adventure
While with the family, he
worked at a warehouse and
went to the movies to get the
excitement and adventure he
craved. He left home in an ef
fort to find that adventure.
Laura, a shy, slighty
crippled girl in her mid-20's,
lives in a fantasy world
dominated by old record al
bums and a collection of
small glass animals. She is a
creature too delicate for the
harsh, brutal real world and
she retreats to her make
believe existence.
Amanda wants only hap
piness for her son and daugh
ter, but she cannot supply
them with what they want. In
an effort to add some happi
ness to her own life she re
minisces about her joyful
youth.
Fine job
The cast does a fine job in
developing all aspects of the
characters. Tom (Fred Ward)
struggles with the decision of
whether to satisfy his own
needs or to stay and help his
mother and sister, and as the
narrator lie struggles with the
haunting memories of his sis
ter.
Amand.j (Olwen Morgan,
who alternates with Marjorie
Ross) is a blend of the desner

ate, bitchy and loving mother,
and Laura (Patricia Boyette)
sometimes leaves her world
to talk with Tom or the robust
and vigorous Gentleman Cal
ler (Bernard Bolter). All the
actors make their characters
believable and mutli-faceted.
Director Doyne Mraz has a
firm grasp of Williams' poetic
images and symbols and
wonderfully illuminates
much of the script. His unob
trusive and varied blocking
fits in excellently.
Larkspur Ltd. has produced
a solid, well-acted version of
The Glass Menagerie.

Tennesee Williams is back
in town with a new script.
Last year he brought This Is
(An Entertainment) to ACT;
this year he hasbrought a new
version of The Tivo-Character
Play to the Showcase Theatre.
This new The Two-
Character Play is intriguing,
if not always exciting. Wil
liams has called the play "the
interior landscape of the most
terrible period of my life ... a
play in which 1 am very

volved," and it sketches a
time in which he suffered

through physical and emo

Laura, a shy, slighty
crippled girl in her mid-20's,
lives in a fantasy world
dominated by old record al
bums and a collection of
small glass animals. She is a
creature too delicate for the
harsh, brutal real world and
she retreats to her make
believe existence.
Amanda wants only hap
piness for her son and daugh
ter, but she cannot supply
them with what they want. In
an effort to add some happi
ness to her own life she re
minisces about her joyful
youth.
Fine job
The cast does a fine job in
developing all aspects of the
characters. Tom (Fred Ward)
struggles with the decision of
whether to satisfy his own
needs or to stay and help his
mother and sister, and as the
narrator lie struggles with the
haunting memories of his sis
ter.
Amand.j (Olwen Morgan,
who alternates with Marjorie
Ross) is a blend of the desner

ate, bitchy and loving mother,
and Laura (Patricia Boyette)
sometimes leaves her world
to talk with Tom or the robust
and vigorous Gentleman Cal
ler (Bernard Bolter). All the
actors make their characters
believable and mutli-faceted.
Director Doyne Mraz has a
firm grasp of Williams' poetic
images and symbols and
wonderfully illuminates
much of the script. His unob
trusive and varied blocking
fits in excellently.
Larkspur Ltd. has produced
a solid, well-acted version of
The Glass Menagerie.

Tennesee Williams is back
in town with a new script.
Last year he brought This Is
(An Entertainment) to ACT;
this year he hasbrought a new
version of The Tivo-Character
Play to the Showcase Theatre.
This new The Two-
Character Play is intriguing,
if not always exciting. Wil
liams has called the play "the
interior landscape of the most
terrible period of my life ... a
play in which 1 am very
deeply emotionally in
volved," and it sketches a
time in which he suffered

through physical and emo
tional agony before entering a
sani tori um.
The show intrigues not
only because it reveals the
more private sections of the
life of one of America's finest
playwrights, but also because
it cleverly deals with the dif
ferences and similarities bet
ween reality and illusion. Un
fortunately, it often gets bog
ged down and fails to develop
either the situation or the
ideas sufficiently.
A brother, Felice and his
sister have been deserted by
the members of their travel
ing theatre troup, so they de
cide to perform their
scheduled play without all
the neccessary props or any
backstage help. Their delicate
relationship, wavering bet
ween love and hate, is further
strained by the difficult situa
tion and Clare's insistence to
cut part of the script, which
Felice has written.
During their performance,
Felice and Clare (played by
Fred Ward and Patricia
Boyette) wander among play
ing their characters and play
ing themselves, speaking
their lines and speaking
spontaneous thoughts, and
living illusion and living re
ality.
Ward and Boyette do an ex
cellent job protraying the
characters and their con
stantly fluctuating emotions.
They both are strong but vul
nerable and caring but gruff.
Director Jay Leo Colt uses
many of Williams' theatrical
devices well, but too often the
pondering quality of the
script seems to defeat him.
The approach the audience
is supposed to take, however,
appears to be to simply ex
perience the changing emo
tions of the two characters
and not to try to understand
all theallusionsand meaning
of the play. Seen in this light.
The Tivo-Chnractpr Play is an
intriguing and fascinating
work.
