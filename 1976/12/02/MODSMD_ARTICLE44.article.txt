# Mixed feelings about the new 'Old Waldorf,' but...
## Club provides fine talent 
### David L. Miller Marco Budak 
Attending a concert at the Old
Waldorf, a 600-seat nightclub
which opened this month at 444
Battery Street in San Francisco's
Golden Gateway, was intense,
perplexing and unpleasant.
The Old Waldorf's excellent
selection of musical talent was
counterbalanced by its disor
ganization, hassles, and imper
sonal atmosphere.
When Gil Scott-Heron ap
peared there recently, the H:3O
crowd was herded through one
small entrance by a curt door
man and an obnoxious un
iformed policeman who de
manded identification from
people who were undoubtedly
grandparents.
In addition to the $5.50 tic
kets, customers were required to
buy an unadvertised two-drink

minimum (drinks were $1.50
and up).
"I've never been in a club that
had so many cops," said an irate
customer. "Its like they think
they're doing us a favor by let
ting us in."
After a long crowded wait, the
11:30 customers entered the club
and found no bartender behind
the bar. The seating was inordi
nately crowded. The table ar
rangement provided few good
seats centered in front of the
stage, and a majority of poor
places on the sides.
Despite these problems, the
music was generally good. After
a pathetic performance by a
ridiculously talkative Tricky
Somebody who attempted to
play a trombone and threatened
the audience with violence in a
futile attempt for applause rather
than ridicule, Arista recording
star Gil Scott-Heron came out
and gave an extraordinary per
formance.
Blues monologue
Scott-Heron started the show
with an improvisational half
hour blues monologue that mas
terfully integrated poetry, polit
ical commentary, and humor. I le
said:
The blues has grown and the
country has not.
The blues remembers, the
country forgot, adding that
"President Ford would have
vetoed tomorrow."
Introducing the Midnight
Band, which received its name
because "Midnight is the first
minute of a new day," Scott-
Heron moved into an original set
of percussive, rhythmic, well
written jazzy soul. Known as a
"political jazz" artist. Scott-
Heron. supported by Brian
Jackson's tremendous keyboard
playing, led the group through
The Bottle, Possum Slim, Don't
Mess With Him. Winter in
America, Home is Where the
Hatred Is, Johannesburg, and
more. The song's themes
explored controversial subjects
ranging from alcoholism to
South Africa's black revolution.
Sensitive and powerful
Consisting of congas, traps,
drums, vocals, trumpet, flugle
horn, sax, bass, and keyboards,
the Midnight Band sang out
powerful, tight, and sensitive
music for two hours. Victor
Brown's sweet, soft, clear vocals
perfectly complemented Scott-
Heron's unique deep voice. The
entire set was musically strong
and provocative.
In addition to night-time
music, the Old Waldorf offers
Italian lunches, bar services
from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and din
ners for $7.
It's a new club that needs
smoothing out. The club's
owner, Jeffrey Pollack, formerly
owned the older and smaller Old
Waldorf on California and Di
visadero. If Pollock manages to
solve the club's obvious birth
pains, his new Old Waldorf has
the room and capabilites to
properly showcase the top talent
he has booked. Coming attrac
tions include Les McCann, Dec.
3-4 and Woody Herman and the
Thundering Herd, Dec. 27-30.

Next to the Trans America
Pyramid, the Tower of Power is
probably the Bay Area's most
notable skyscraper. Although
the Pyramid may be earthquake
proof, the Tower is not.
The Old Waldorf rocked and
swayed to the mighty rhythms
laid down by these powerful en
gineers of funk. Despite the
band's recent slippage in the
ephemeral realm of rock and roll
popularity, the Bay Area's loyal
connoisseurs of rock and soul fil
led the spacious club to capacity
for four shows over Thanksgiv
ing weekend.
The stuffed-shirt sterility of
San Francisco's Financial Dis
trict (the location of the Old
Waldorf) provided a fine con
trast to the slick grease that lub
ricates Tower's precision funk
machine. In recent concert ap
pearances, this machine was
being worn down by the act's
continual reliance on outdated
hit tunes and an increasingly un
inspired stage presence. How
ever, last Thursday's perfor
mance benefited by a fresh lube
job in the form of an almost en
tirely new repertoire that
seemed to inject an entirely new
spirit into the band.
The act was opened by coun
try singer-comedian-harp player
Billy Roberts. Roberts knew he
had lost the audience before he
had completed his first number
and the rest of his routine was a
lackluster attempt to recapture
the crowd. But in deference to
Roberts, his audience had come
to bump, and country blues
harmonica sounded like a feeble
breeze against the mighty gale of
Lenny Pickett's dancing
saxophone.
Squib cakes
When Tower boarded the in
timate stage to open its show
with "Squib Cakes," the energe
tic drive of this band was readily
apparent. A new addition to the
group, trumpet player Bill Land
(formerly of the Elvin Bishop
Band), added even greater clar
ity to the already precise brass
section. Tower's old stalwarts
were all in fine form from the
Funky Doctor's gyrating hips to
Emilio "Mimi" Castillo's
charismatic smile.
Over half of the repertoire was
comprised of songs off the new
album There Ain't Nothin'
Stoppin' Us Now, as well as a
few unrecorded tunes. The title
song from the latest album was
the highlight of the new mate
rial. In this piece, Tower has
once again come up with a un
ique repeating brass line that
makes the audience want to
leave the club and go strut down
the streets of Oakland.
Other new pieces, such as
"Like Paradise," "Too Good to
be True" and guitarist Bruce
Conte's "Doin' Alright" were all
as simplistic as their optimistic
titles. However, Greg Adam's
fine arrangements together with
the band's clean delivery left all
thesetunes pleasantly engaging.
The band's performance of
such old stand-bys as "What is
Hip?" "Down to the Nightclub"
and "Knock Yourself Out" was

tighter and more inspired than
in past performances, probably
due to the new energy and wel
come relief provided by the
added material.
Tower's weak link continues
to be its new lead singer, Eddie
McGee. This high-pitched Little
Richard has a long string of ag
gravating stage habits that seem
well-suited for Harlem's Apollo
Theatre (where he was disco
vered) but out of place on the
professional stage. McGee
moves well, and he pours admir
ably into his skin-tight leather
pants, but his weak voice, li
mited vocal range, trite com
ments ("We all love you so very,
very much") obnoxious laugh
following every number, and his
incessant guitar playing (with
out a guitar) all seemed to leave
the audience cold. Hopefully
Tower's manager will soon ac
quire a similar opinion.
No more growing pains
A word on the Old Waldorf,
San Francisco's newest major
entertainment showcase. The
Old Waldorf has apparently got
ten over its growing pains and
earlier widespread criticism of
the operation has been ap
peased. For tliis appearance of
Tower, the club could have
stacked the audience to the ceil
ing but instead it chose to keep
the house small and intimate.
The two-drink minimum,
though disconcerting, was not
enforced anywhere in the club.
As for the Old Waldorf's
facilities, the sound system and
accoustics are first rate, audi
ence sight lines are extraordinar
ily clear (due to loud speakers
suspended from the cei l ing) and,
most importantly, the club
boasts a quiet, effective air con
ditioning system.
But last week, the air con
ditioners had to work overtime
to keep the audience cool, and
their effect was all but lost
against the blazing hot fires ig
nited by the Tower.
