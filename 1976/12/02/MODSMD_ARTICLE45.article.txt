# Moore: a real musical man
## 
### Dean Eyre 
A unique group of musicians
performing everything from Old
English songs to modern con
cepts of jazz and almost all styles
inclusive can only be described
as Herb Moore and Friends.
Playing three weeks ago in the
upstairs lounge of Tresidder be
fore a very receptive audience,
the artists illustrated a wide
range of instrumental and vocal
talents.
The group includes Leonard
Hanitchak on string bass, flute
and vocals, Harriett Jacoff Dn
piano, Julie Issacs on dulcimer,
Steve Bryson on guitar, and
leader Herb Moore on guitar and
vocals.
Moore shared his perspective
on his interests and goals in
music once the concert had been
concluded.
With 17 years of experience
and a special ability to interpret
music, Moore has not had any
formal lessons. His specialty,
guitar, developed as he listened
to other people play.
Learning
While learning the traditional
methods of tuning and chord
formations, he picked up tunes
hy hearing recordings of songs.
The recorded music gave him
an idea of progressions to work
with, and as his ideas developed,
he began to evolve original com
positions. Playing for five or six
years before getting any training
in theory, Moore studied from
books and classical music.
Moore learns from other musi
cians. but does not try to imitate
them. For example, he listens to
Doc Watson and may "pick up
licks," but does not try to be like
him. Listening to Doc perform.
Moore will "get into what he's
doing," and apply it to his own
musical style.
He also values the improvisa
tional ability of artists such as
Miles Davis, but applies the con
cepts to the areas of classical and

folk guitar.
In describing the category of
this music, Moore feels that too
many musicians go to extremes
and "worry about being diffe
rent." He has been "open to dif
ferent kinds of music," and is
forming a synthesis of folk and
jazz.
He has also been influenced by
artists such as Leo kottke and
Jerry Garcia. "Music becomes
original when you open your
self up to all types of things," he
says.
Moore's current area of in
terest is in original composition
for groups. He has been influ
enced by classical tastes in his
style of writing. He describes
himself as "being in a good posi
tion" with the availability of
local musicians to perform his
music. He played with the Palo
Alto Chamber Orchestra, which
gave him a valuable perspective
in that level of performance.
Seeing himself going in a di
rection that "tends to be classi
cal," Moore admits that he is
"not tailoring his music to be
popular." While not presently
playing in bars or nightclubs, he
keeps in touch with musicians
who are and has noticed artists
achieving many levels of suc
cess. The frustration of "trying to
'make it' " doesn't necessarily
feel good even if a performer is
successful, according to Moore.
Employed at Tresidder
While not earning his living as
a musician (be is employed at
Tresidder as a technical assistant
for musical performances) he is
in contact with many who are. He
notes that "thenumber of people
that make bread (as professional
musicians) compared to those
that hang in there is small."
Although "it is possible to be
original in disco music," Moore
is not interested in playing in
clubs. His most pleasant music
situations have been at Memo
rial Church and Tresidder. The

audiences at these places were
"open to what's happening,"
says Moore.
Seeking a goal which is to per
form music that pleases him,
Moore finds that this aspect of
expression allows him to "get in
touch with himself."
He explains that the best op
portunity in music is that thereis
a special quality of freedom of
interpretation that occurs bet
ween the loudspeaker and the
listener.
Energy
Revealing his personal image
of music as an "energy that hap
pens." Moore feels that when
properly developed, this energy
can be even more exciting than
the music itself.
Moore feels there is a strong
interaction in the level of com
munication that occurs in a con
cert. The message of the music is
clearly perceived because there

exists a "lot of communication
between audience and musi
cian."
In terms of studio work, he
said that an album is an "art form
different from (live) perfor
mances." Beginning with solo
studio work, he hopes to gain an
understanding of recording
techniques for a future album
and then expand to include
other musicians.
An element which he wants to
retain in the album is the "live
ness" of the sound. Also, he is
very interested in thematic or
ganization of selections with an
overture effect.
If all goes well, the album
should materialize within a few
months and judging by the crea
tive energy produced in the Tre
sidder concert, the recording
will communicate the excite
ment that Herb Moore and
Friends conveys.

doing," and apply it to his own
musical style.
He also values the improvisa
tional ability of artists such as
Miles Davis, but applies the con
cepts to the areas of classical and

folk guitar.
In describing the category of
this music, Moore feels that too
many musicians go to extremes
and "worry about being diffe
rent." He has been "open to dif
ferent kinds of music," and is
forming a synthesis of folk and
jazz.
He has also been influenced by
artists such as Leo kottke and
Jerry Garcia. "Music becomes
original when you open your
self up to all types of things," he
says.
Moore's current area of in
terest is in original composition
for groups. He has been influ
enced by classical tastes in his
style of writing. He describes
himself as "being in a good posi
tion" with the availability of
local musicians to perform his
music. He played with the Palo
Alto Chamber Orchestra, which
gave him a valuable perspective
in that level of performance.
Seeing himself going in a di
rection that "tends to be classi
cal," Moore admits that he is
"not tailoring his music to be
popular." While not presently
playing in bars or nightclubs, he
keeps in touch with musicians
who are and has noticed artists
achieving many levels of suc
cess. The frustration of "trying to
'make it' " doesn't necessarily
feel good even if a performer is
successful, according to Moore.
Employed at Tresidder
While not earning his living as
a musician (be is employed at
Tresidder as a technical assistant
for musical performances) he is
in contact with many who are. He
notes that "thenumber of people
that make bread (as professional
musicians) compared to those
that hang in there is small."
Although "it is possible to be
original in disco music," Moore
is not interested in playing in
clubs. His most pleasant music
situations have been at Memo
rial Church and Tresidder. The

audiences at these places were
"open to what's happening,"
says Moore.
Seeking a goal which is to per
form music that pleases him,
Moore finds that this aspect of
expression allows him to "get in
touch with himself."
He explains that the best op
portunity in music is that thereis
a special quality of freedom of
interpretation that occurs bet
ween the loudspeaker and the
listener.
Energy
Revealing his personal image
of music as an "energy that hap
pens." Moore feels that when
properly developed, this energy
can be even more exciting than
the music itself.
Moore feels there is a strong
interaction in the level of com
munication that occurs in a con
cert. The message of the music is
clearly perceived because there

exists a "lot of communication
between audience and musi
cian."
In terms of studio work, he
said that an album is an "art form
different from (live) perfor
mances." Beginning with solo
studio work, he hopes to gain an
understanding of recording
techniques for a future album
and then expand to include
other musicians.
An element which he wants to
retain in the album is the "live
ness" of the sound. Also, he is
very interested in thematic or
ganization of selections with an
overture effect.
If all goes well, the album
should materialize within a few
months and judging by the crea
tive energy produced in the Tre
sidder concert, the recording
will communicate the excite
ment that Herb Moore and
Friends conveys.
A unique group of musicians
performing everything from Old
English songs to modern con
cepts of jazz and almost all styles
inclusive can only be described
as Herb Moore and Friends.
Playing three weeks ago in the
upstairs lounge of Tresidder be
fore a very receptive audience,
the artists illustrated a wide
range of instrumental and vocal
talents.
The group includes Leonard
Hanitchak on string bass, flute
and vocals, Harriett Jacoff Dn
piano, Julie Issacs on dulcimer,
Steve Bryson on guitar, and
leader Herb Moore on guitar and
vocals.
Moore shared his perspective
on his interests and goals in
music once the concert had been
concluded.
With 17 years of experience
and a special ability to interpret
music, Moore has not had any
formal lessons. His specialty,
guitar, developed as he listened
to other people play.
Learning
While learning the traditional
methods of tuning and chord
formations, he picked up tunes
hy hearing recordings of songs.
The recorded music gave him
an idea of progressions to work
with, and as his ideas developed,
he began to evolve original com
positions. Playing for five or six
years before getting any training
in theory, Moore studied from
books and classical music.
Moore learns from other musi
cians. but does not try to imitate
them. For example, he listens to
Doc Watson and may "pick up
licks," but does not try to be like
him. Listening to Doc perform.
Moore will "get into what he's
doing," and apply it to his own

While not earning his living as
a musician (be is employed at
Tresidder as a technical assistant
for musical performances) he is
in contact with many who are. He
notes that "thenumber of people
that make bread (as professional
musicians) compared to those
that hang in there is small."
Although "it is possible to be
original in disco music," Moore
is not interested in playing in
clubs. His most pleasant music
situations have been at Memo
rial Church and Tresidder. The

audiences at these places were
"open to what's happening,"
says Moore.
Seeking a goal which is to per
form music that pleases him,
Moore finds that this aspect of
expression allows him to "get in
touch with himself."
He explains that the best op
portunity in music is that thereis
a special quality of freedom of
interpretation that occurs bet
ween the loudspeaker and the
listener.
Energy
Revealing his personal image
of music as an "energy that hap
pens." Moore feels that when
properly developed, this energy
can be even more exciting than
the music itself.
Moore feels there is a strong
interaction in the level of com
munication that occurs in a con
cert. The message of the music is
clearly perceived because there

exists a "lot of communication
between audience and musi
cian."
In terms of studio work, he
said that an album is an "art form
different from (live) perfor
mances." Beginning with solo
studio work, he hopes to gain an
understanding of recording
techniques for a future album
and then expand to include
other musicians.
An element which he wants to
retain in the album is the "live
ness" of the sound. Also, he is
very interested in thematic or
ganization of selections with an
overture effect.
If all goes well, the album
should materialize within a few
months and judging by the crea
tive energy produced in the Tre
sidder concert, the recording
will communicate the excite
ment that Herb Moore and
Friends conveys.
A unique group of musicians
performing everything from Old
English songs to modern con
cepts of jazz and almost all styles
inclusive can only be described
as Herb Moore and Friends.
Playing three weeks ago in the
upstairs lounge of Tresidder be
fore a very receptive audience,
the artists illustrated a wide
range of instrumental and vocal
talents.
The group includes Leonard
Hanitchak on string bass, flute
and vocals, Harriett Jacoff Dn
piano, Julie Issacs on dulcimer,
Steve Bryson on guitar, and
leader Herb Moore on guitar and
vocals.
Moore shared his perspective
on his interests and goals in
music once the concert had been
concluded.
With 17 years of experience
and a special ability to interpret
music, Moore has not had any
formal lessons. His specialty,
guitar, developed as he listened
to other people play.
Learning
While learning the traditional
methods of tuning and chord
formations, he picked up tunes
hy hearing recordings of songs.
The recorded music gave him
an idea of progressions to work
with, and as his ideas developed,
he began to evolve original com
positions. Playing for five or six
years before getting any training
in theory, Moore studied from
books and classical music.
Moore learns from other musi
cians. but does not try to imitate
them. For example, he listens to
Doc Watson and may "pick up
licks," but does not try to be like
him. Listening to Doc perform.
Moore will "get into what he's
doing," and apply it to his own
musical style.
He also values the improvisa
tional ability of artists such as
Miles Davis, but applies the con
cepts to the areas of classical and

folk guitar.
In describing the category of
this music, Moore feels that too
many musicians go to extremes
and "worry about being diffe
rent." He has been "open to dif
ferent kinds of music," and is
forming a synthesis of folk and
jazz.
He has also been influenced by
artists such as Leo kottke and
Jerry Garcia. "Music becomes
original when you open your
self up to all types of things," he
says.
Moore's current area of in
terest is in original composition
for groups. He has been influ
enced by classical tastes in his
style of writing. He describes
himself as "being in a good posi
tion" with the availability of
local musicians to perform his
music. He played with the Palo
Alto Chamber Orchestra, which
gave him a valuable perspective
in that level of performance.
Seeing himself going in a di
rection that "tends to be classi
cal," Moore admits that he is
"not tailoring his music to be
popular." While not presently
playing in bars or nightclubs, he
keeps in touch with musicians
who are and has noticed artists
achieving many levels of suc
cess. The frustration of "trying to
'make it' " doesn't necessarily
feel good even if a performer is
successful, according to Moore.
