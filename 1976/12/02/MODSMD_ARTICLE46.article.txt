# Play excites French pupils

Quelle amusement!
Why was a group of Stanford
students dressed in shiny robes
screaming at each other in
French on the chancel of Mem
Chu Tuesday night?
Because they were having fun
participating in a play written
and directed by kamal Zein.
Fete En Re Mineur, performed
in front of a large crowd which
included the French consul from
San Francisco, was an enjoyable
experience for both Ln Troupe
Francaise De Stanford and the
audience.
The French was sometimes
difficult to understand, but the
play would hardly have been
easier to grasp in English. Zein
portrayed complex philosophi
cal concepts with simple French
words.
The idea which sparked Fete
En Re Mineur was the produc
tion of a drama in which stu

dents from all levels of French
could participate. Zein, a
graduate student in the French
department, wrote the piece
after visiting Mem Chu.
The apocalyptic play was per
formed by three choruses, two
mimes and an organist. The
choruses, composed of students,
represented ideas rather than
characters. The mimes were fas
cinating intermediaries between
the stage and the audience. Pro
fessor Michelle Morran, also of
the French department, played
the organ.
Members of the cast agreed
that "mostly it was just fun."
Zein is to be commended for
creating such an enjoyable way
of learning French.
A student in the audience as
sessed the play's significance
well when he said, "I wish
someone had thought of it when
I was taking French."
