# Otero to do 'Godspell'
## 
### 
Sunday school was never
like this. Gudspell, continu
ing tonight, tomorrow and
Saturday at Otero dining hall
at 8:30 p.m. features clowns,
mimes and a stripper in a
musical version of the gospel
according to St. Matthew.
St. Matthew probably
would be somewhat sur
prised at the setting of
Godspell — a junkyard — and
the zany costumes — every-!
thing from belled sneakers to!
a Stanford T-shirt.
"You may not agree with;
the message, but it will make;
you think. It's not your typi-;
cal musical," says Simon;
Sanchez, the director. J
Jesus Christ is played by!
Brad Blake and Jim Hartley!
plays the John the Baptist/!
Judas role. Sanchez says the!
cast is made up of 11 people!
in all: the in cast members'
and the audience viewer. "I 1
think if people will come;
they'll really get a lot out of;
it," said Sanchez. J
Musical Director Marshall!
Tom leads a four-piece rock!
band in the music, which fea-!
tures well-known hits like!
"Dav bv Day"and "All flood!
Gifts."
Seating is limited in the!
Otero dining room so the au
dience is advised to come!
early. Wine will be served at;
intermission.
