# Toyon gives good show

### Mike Fossel 
Dorm theater, though seldom as polished as the
productions of professional players, is often more
entertaining. So it is with Toyon's current produc
tion of Charley's Aunt, directed by Simone Cox.
Two lovelorn college inen who can woo their
sweethearts only hv borrowing respectability in
the form of a chaperone convince a friend (Lord
Babberly) to play the part of a forward but dowdy
aunt. Pursued by two suitors of his (her?) own,
Charley's counterfeit aunt becomes the center of a
humorous tangle of deception but is instrumental
in the final, happy resolution of all problems.
Lord Babberly. (John Chisolm) is the soul of the
show. Where there is laughter and energy in the
show, there is also Lord Babberly. He inspires
enjoyment in his audience and a more relaxed,
sure performance in bis fellow actors.
Charley (William Glenn) and Jack (Jeff Little),
the two young romeos and conspirators, enjoy

their roles but lack focus. Occasional shuffling
and undefined gestures detracted from their per
formances. Nevertheless, they exhibit energy and
warmth and will probably improve with each per
forma nee.
Kla Delahay ()ill Marshall) has more presence
than do the other actresses. Whether quiet or e\
cited. Miss Delahay is believable. Her guardian.
Donna Lucia D'Alvadorez (Marilyn Driver), is al
most equally convincing. Her dignity is adroitly
portrayed and her calm manner provides a foil for
the worry and frenzy of most of the other roles.
The entire cast is to be commended. Although
the final rehearsals revealed rough spots (asides
which merged into dialogue and nervous acting)
the show most certainly will have improved for
the public. Charley's Aunt, playing until Saturday
night in the Toyon lounge, is not only free enter
tainment, but will provide laughter and a better
evening than would many other productions.
