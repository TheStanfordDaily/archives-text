# A 						new kind of disaster flick
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
What Psycho did for the
shower. What The Towering In
ferno did for skyscrapers. What
Jaws did for the beach. What
Marathon Man did for dentistry.
What Two-Minute Wurning does
for football games. They're all
cliches now.
A sniper secretes himself be
hind the scoreboard at the Los
Angeles Coliseum just before a
championship football game.
Which spectators does he plan
on using for target practice? The
President? The Mayor?The gov
ernors? After the Goodyear
blimp reveals his presence, the
police (headed by Charlton Hes
ton) and S.W.A.T. (headed by
John Cassavetes) move into ac
tion to capture him before he
strikes.
With the merciless threat of
violence hanging over 91,000
people, Two-Minute Wurning is
the disaster formula multipled a
thousandfold. At their basic
core, disaster films deal in plas
tic, contrived suspense (when
and who? rather than why and
how?) to achieve their thrills.
But why do we go to the movies?
Wedon't gotobebored Wegoto
bs moved, to feel amotions
within us that we don't normally
feel. When it comes to dredging
those emotions, Two-Mii.'jte
Warning bulldozes its way into
our consciousness.
Basic tenet
Director Larry Peerce has
taken a basic tenet of disaster
films — tii it of casting stars —
and emplr ,-cd it to its fullest ad
vantage, making the terror har

rowing to contend with. With so
many subplots and vignettes in
such a film, superstars provide
the audience with prior recogni
tion.
By casting people like Beau
Bridges. Jack Mugman, Walter
Pidgeon and David Janssen and
introducing us to their charac
ters' lives, we not only feel close
to the characters, but our
memories of the actors in so
many other roles subconsciously
exist, affecting our feelings to
ward them.
I used to sneak out of bed to see
Janssen on 7"he Fugitive when I
was young; it's almost a* if I've
grown up with him. I» is an emo
tional blow to see people you've
been close to all your life in th«
crosshairs of a sniper's rifle.
Surrounded
But the familiarity for us
doesn't stop theic. While not all
of us ha'.L. been on sabotaged
airpianes oi capsized ships, we
know what it's like tc i.c sur
rounded by ninety thousand
crazed people in a football
stadium.
As if that weren't enough, the
game Peerce filmed to show a
capacity cicnvd wus last yea.':.
USC-Stanford game (no. Univer
sal Studios never did bothor to
pay us for using our team in
commercial footage). 1 nose irn
our play r, is down there on that
playing field, and us under the
thumb of that sniper. It's not
possible to gc* Tmch closer to the
feeling of being there, that vii.
arious participation that is the
aim of disaster films.
Snippets of irony abound in

Two-Minute Warning, making it
a chilling piece of cinema. When
Mike Ramsay (Bridges) discov
ers the sniper above the
scoreboard with his binoculars,
the sniper is looking directly at
him through his scope.
Fatally high stake
Sandman (klugman), a gam
bler deep in debt to the syndi
cate and who has a fatally high
stake in the game (if his team
loses he will get tossed out a
window for non-payment of
debts) at one point turns to the
priest (Mitchell Ryan) beside
hnu and says, "Someone's trying
to kill me."

The sniper, when finally sub
dued, says but one line — "Don't
hurt me."
And perhaps one of the most
moving pieces of film in the en
tire movie occurs when stadium
manager Mckeever (Martin M.il
sam) gazes at his domain when
panic has cleared the stadium
and the turmoil has ended. In
that simple act. his eyes convey
an overwhelming sadness, as if
the stadium will never be the
same again, as if what had origi
nally been built as an arena for
entertainment and enjoyment
had been forever tainted by that
evil above the scoreboard.

an overwhelming sadness, as if
the stadium will never be the

A man who needs no introduction
Superstar Charlton Heston plays a police captain in charge of
capturing a sniper perched above the scoreboard at the Los
Angeles Coliseum during a championship football game in
Tivo-Minute Warning.
What Psycho did for the
shower. What The Towering In
ferno did for skyscrapers. What
Jaws did for the beach. What
Marathon Man did for dentistry.
What Two-Minute Wurning does
for football games. They're all
cliches now.
A sniper secretes himself be
hind the scoreboard at the Los
Angeles Coliseum just before a
championship football game.
Which spectators does he plan
on using for target practice? The
President? The Mayor?The gov
ernors? After the Goodyear
blimp reveals his presence, the
police (headed by Charlton Hes
ton) and S.W.A.T. (headed by
John Cassavetes) move into ac
tion to capture him before he
strikes.
With the merciless threat of
violence hanging over 91,000
people, Two-Minute Wurning is
the disaster formula multipled a
thousandfold. At their basic
core, disaster films deal in plas
tic, contrived suspense (when
and who? rather than why and
how?) to achieve their thrills.
But why do we go to the movies?
Wedon't gotobebored Wegoto
bs moved, to feel amotions
within us that we don't normally
feel. When it comes to dredging
those emotions, Two-Mii.'jte
Warning bulldozes its way into
our consciousness.
Basic tenet
Director Larry Peerce has
taken a basic tenet of disaster
films — tii it of casting stars —
and emplr ,-cd it to its fullest ad
vantage, making the terror har

rowing to contend with. With so
many subplots and vignettes in
such a film, superstars provide
the audience with prior recogni
tion.
By casting people like Beau
Bridges. Jack Mugman, Walter
Pidgeon and David Janssen and
introducing us to their charac
ters' lives, we not only feel close
to the characters, but our
memories of the actors in so
many other roles subconsciously
exist, affecting our feelings to
ward them.
I used to sneak out of bed to see
Janssen on 7"he Fugitive when I
was young; it's almost a* if I've
grown up with him. I» is an emo
tional blow to see people you've
been close to all your life in th«
crosshairs of a sniper's rifle.
Surrounded
But the familiarity for us
doesn't stop theic. While not all
of us ha'.L. been on sabotaged
airpianes oi capsized ships, we
know what it's like tc i.c sur
rounded by ninety thousand
crazed people in a football
stadium.
As if that weren't enough, the
game Peerce filmed to show a
capacity cicnvd wus last yea.':.
USC-Stanford game (no. Univer
sal Studios never did bothor to
pay us for using our team in
commercial footage). 1 nose irn
our play r, is down there on that
playing field, and us under the
thumb of that sniper. It's not
possible to gc* Tmch closer to the
feeling of being there, that vii.
arious participation that is the
aim of disaster films.
Snippets of irony abound in

Two-Minute Warning, making it
a chilling piece of cinema. When
Mike Ramsay (Bridges) discov
ers the sniper above the
scoreboard with his binoculars,
the sniper is looking directly at
him through his scope.
Fatally high stake
Sandman (klugman), a gam
bler deep in debt to the syndi
cate and who has a fatally high
stake in the game (if his team
loses he will get tossed out a
window for non-payment of
debts) at one point turns to the
priest (Mitchell Ryan) beside
hnu and says, "Someone's trying
to kill me."

The sniper, when finally sub
dued, says but one line — "Don't
hurt me."
And perhaps one of the most
moving pieces of film in the en
tire movie occurs when stadium
manager Mckeever (Martin M.il
sam) gazes at his domain when
panic has cleared the stadium
and the turmoil has ended. In
that simple act. his eyes convey
an overwhelming sadness, as if
the stadium will never be the
same again, as if what had origi
nally been built as an arena for
entertainment and enjoyment
had been forever tainted by that
evil above the scoreboard.

And perhaps one of the most
moving pieces of film in the en
tire movie occurs when stadium
manager Mckeever (Martin M.il
sam) gazes at his domain when

the stadium will never be the
same again, as if what had origi
nally been built as an arena for
entertainment and enjoyment
had been forever tainted by that
evil above the scoreboard.
