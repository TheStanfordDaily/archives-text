# Faculty, staff tuition 'grants' may be taxed

Tuition payment programs benefit
ting more than 500 children of faculty
and staff families here may now he
come taxable, under a proposed
change in an Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) regulation published in the Nov.
2 issue of the Federal Register.
A $1.16 million budget has been set
for the 1976-77 tuition payment prog
ram, according to the Stanford Univer
sity operating Budget Guidelines. This
budget can aid as many as 466 faculty
and staff families who qualified in
June for tuition remissions.
Under the current program, faculty
and staff families are granted one half
of the tuition costs here or an equivi
lent amount toward tuition at another
college or university. During the
1975-76 academic year, 53 per cent of
the remissions went to the children of
faculty and staff children who at
tended school here, while 47 per cent
of the remissions were used by those
attending other institutions.
Employee compensation
The proposed amendment states
that if an educational institution par
ticipates in a payment plan "whereby
the tuition of a child or spouse of an
employee or former employee of such
institution is remitted, paid,.or reim
bursed by that institution or by any
other participating institution . . . (it)
will be treated as compensation to the
employee . . . unless the employee can
establish that the program is not com
pensatory in nature."
However, any remission either
promised or made by the educational
institution before Nov. 2, 1976 for the
1976-77 academic year will be clas
sified as a scholarship and will not be
taxed.
In addition, certain amounts remit
ted after Nov. 2, 1976, will also be tax
free if "such amounts remitted are pur
suant before that date," states the Fed
eral Register.
Scholarships?
For the past 26 years, all tuition re
mission programs have been consi
dered scholarships and have been tax
free under the present IRS regulations.
Opposition to the proposed taxation
change has been voiced by the Ameri
can Council on Education and the Na
tional Association of College and Uni
versity Business Officers.
Written comments on the proposed
change may be submitted, preferably
in six copies, to the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue by Dec. 17, accord
ing to an article in the Nov. 24 issue of
Campus Report. Individuals submit
ting statements who desireto testify on
the proposed change should submit a
request to the same place by the same
deadline.
