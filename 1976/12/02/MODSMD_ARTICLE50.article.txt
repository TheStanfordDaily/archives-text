Controlled heroin study considered
Denver — An experiment that would make he
roin available to addicts under certain cir
cumstances as part of an effort to control narcotics
traffic was considered yesterday during the final
session of the 1976 Congress of Cities.
"We are looking for a study. We want to see if it
works, or if it doesn't," said Councilwoman Phyllis
Lamphere of Seattle, who was in line to become the
first woman president of the 52-year-old National
League of Cities.
Heroin maintenance involves making the narco
tic available to addicts under controlled cir
cumstances so addicts can attempt a withdrawal
from the drug while getting it in an atmosphere that
eliminates illegal trafficking and assures the heroin
is not so strong as to induce a fatal overdose
Carter meets with economic experts
Plains, Ga. — President-elect Jimmy Carter met
with 16 bankers, businessmen and economists yes
terday as his running-mate continued to apply
jaw-boning pressure on the nation's steel industry
to roll back recent price increases.
The meeting was attended by some of the na
tion's leading Democratic economic figures. Carter
has made it known that the guest list includes the
names of persons likely to be chosen as secretary of
the treasury, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, secretary of commerce and other top
economic posts.
Before the meeting, Vice President-elect Walter
Mondale called the increase "very unfortunate"
and said it may forecast an "ominous" pattern for
the economy if other major industries follow the
lead of big steel.
U.N. admits Angola; U.S. abstains
United Nations, N.Y. — The General Assembly
admitted Angola to United Nations membership
yesterday by a vote of 116-0.
The United States, which had once vetoed the
former Portuguese African colony's admission in
t he Security Council, abstained in yesterday's vote.
Angola's application was reconsidered last week
by the council, which must approve membership
bids before they can be acted upon by the General
Assembly. The United States also abstained in the
Security Council vote.
Chevettes recalled for loose caps
Detroit — General Motors Corp. is recalling all
175,000 of its 1976 Chevrolet Chevettes because
some of the cars may have loose fuel tank caps,
which could increase the chances of a fire in an

accident.
A GM Chevy Division spokesperson said yester
dav that the caps may not seal properly because ot
excessive solder on the internal threads of the fuel
tank tiller neck.
The Cht.vy spokesman said Chevrolet has re
ceived no tield reports of tires or injuries resulting
from the potential defect.
Panama Canal security threatened
Washington -- The Panamanian government
wants Jimmy Carte r to conclude a new Panama
Ca lal treaty within a year after he becomes presi
dent to prevent tiif security situation from worsen
ing.
Qualified informants in touch with the negotiat
ing teams reported thai word of Panamanian Gen.

Omar Torrijos' attitude has been conveyed to high
officials in the Ford administration. They, in turn,
have passed their own appraisal to the President
elect.
This appraisal, according to the sources, suggests
that any threats to the security of the American
manned Canal Zone are more likely to come from
within Panama itself than from any foreign coun
try. It is an assessment evidently shared by the U.S.
State and Defense departments.
Informants said U.S. intelligence authorities
have noted that some Panamanian elements,
perhaps anticipating a need to use force, have made
contact with foreign groups and governments
which have developed sophisticated techniques of
guerrilla warfare.
Five more black marines face trial
Camp Pendleton — The Marine Corps said yes
terday charges are being placed against an addi
tional five blacks in connection with the Nov. 13
attack on a barracks of white marines.
The official charging of the five blacks brought to
13 the number of men who face possible courts
martial on conspiracy and assauit counts stemming
from the cornmando-style raid on a barracks room
the blacks apparently believed was the scene of a
Ku Klux Klan (KKk) meeting.
Economic index remains unchanged
Washington The government's index of
economic indicators was unchanged in October,
the government said yesterday, raising the possibil
ity that the slowdown in the economy could be
nearing an end.
But the flat performance of the composite index
of leading indicators did not forecast any im
provement in the economy. The index declined
steeply in both August and September.
In addition, the October index would have been
down sharply had it not been for extensive down
ward revisions in the index for nine of the previous
12 months.
The index is considered important because it is
supposed to foreshadow the direction of the
economy. Had it declined a third consecutive
month, it would have been interpreted by many
economists as pointing to an even worse economic
slowdown, possibly a recession.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with hazy visibility. Cool
nights with local frost likely in colder areas. Lows
mostly in the 30s and 40s. Highs in the upper 50s to
upper 60s. Light winds.

Detroit — General Motors Corp. is recalling all
175,000 of its 1976 Chevrolet Chevettes because
some of the cars may have loose fuel tank caps,
which could increase the chances of a fire in an

accident.
A GM Chevy Division spokesperson said yester

Panama Canal security threatened
Washington -- The Panamanian government
wants Jimmy Carte r to conclude a new Panama
Ca lal treaty within a year after he becomes presi
dent to prevent tiif security situation from worsen
ing.
Qualified informants in touch with the negotiat
ing teams reported thai word of Panamanian Gen.

Omar Torrijos' attitude has been conveyed to high
officials in the Ford administration. They, in turn,
have passed their own appraisal to the President
elect.
This appraisal, according to the sources, suggests
that any threats to the security of the American
manned Canal Zone are more likely to come from
within Panama itself than from any foreign coun
try. It is an assessment evidently shared by the U.S.
State and Defense departments.
Informants said U.S. intelligence authorities
have noted that some Panamanian elements,
perhaps anticipating a need to use force, have made
contact with foreign groups and governments
which have developed sophisticated techniques of
guerrilla warfare.
Five more black marines face trial
Camp Pendleton — The Marine Corps said yes
terday charges are being placed against an addi
tional five blacks in connection with the Nov. 13
attack on a barracks of white marines.
The official charging of the five blacks brought to
13 the number of men who face possible courts
martial on conspiracy and assauit counts stemming
from the cornmando-style raid on a barracks room
the blacks apparently believed was the scene of a
Ku Klux Klan (KKk) meeting.
Economic index remains unchanged
Washington The government's index of
economic indicators was unchanged in October,
the government said yesterday, raising the possibil
ity that the slowdown in the economy could be
nearing an end.
But the flat performance of the composite index
of leading indicators did not forecast any im
provement in the economy. The index declined
steeply in both August and September.
In addition, the October index would have been
down sharply had it not been for extensive down
ward revisions in the index for nine of the previous
12 months.
The index is considered important because it is
supposed to foreshadow the direction of the
economy. Had it declined a third consecutive
month, it would have been interpreted by many
economists as pointing to an even worse economic
slowdown, possibly a recession.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with hazy visibility. Cool
nights with local frost likely in colder areas. Lows
mostly in the 30s and 40s. Highs in the upper 50s to
upper 60s. Light winds.
Controlled heroin study considered
Denver — An experiment that would make he
roin available to addicts under certain cir
cumstances as part of an effort to control narcotics
traffic was considered yesterday during the final
session of the 1976 Congress of Cities.
"We are looking for a study. We want to see if it
works, or if it doesn't," said Councilwoman Phyllis
Lamphere of Seattle, who was in line to become the
first woman president of the 52-year-old National
League of Cities.
Heroin maintenance involves making the narco
tic available to addicts under controlled cir
cumstances so addicts can attempt a withdrawal
from the drug while getting it in an atmosphere that
eliminates illegal trafficking and assures the heroin
is not so strong as to induce a fatal overdose
Carter meets with economic experts
Plains, Ga. — President-elect Jimmy Carter met
with 16 bankers, businessmen and economists yes
terday as his running-mate continued to apply
jaw-boning pressure on the nation's steel industry
to roll back recent price increases.
The meeting was attended by some of the na
tion's leading Democratic economic figures. Carter
has made it known that the guest list includes the
names of persons likely to be chosen as secretary of
the treasury, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, secretary of commerce and other top
economic posts.
Before the meeting, Vice President-elect Walter
Mondale called the increase "very unfortunate"
and said it may forecast an "ominous" pattern for
the economy if other major industries follow the
lead of big steel.

Economic index remains unchanged
Washington The government's index of
economic indicators was unchanged in October,
the government said yesterday, raising the possibil
ity that the slowdown in the economy could be
nearing an end.
But the flat performance of the composite index
of leading indicators did not forecast any im
provement in the economy. The index declined
steeply in both August and September.
In addition, the October index would have been
down sharply had it not been for extensive down
ward revisions in the index for nine of the previous
12 months.
The index is considered important because it is
supposed to foreshadow the direction of the
economy. Had it declined a third consecutive
month, it would have been interpreted by many
economists as pointing to an even worse economic
slowdown, possibly a recession.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with hazy visibility. Cool
nights with local frost likely in colder areas. Lows
mostly in the 30s and 40s. Highs in the upper 50s to
upper 60s. Light winds.
Controlled heroin study considered
Denver — An experiment that would make he
roin available to addicts under certain cir
cumstances as part of an effort to control narcotics
traffic was considered yesterday during the final
session of the 1976 Congress of Cities.
"We are looking for a study. We want to see if it
works, or if it doesn't," said Councilwoman Phyllis
Lamphere of Seattle, who was in line to become the
first woman president of the 52-year-old National
League of Cities.
Heroin maintenance involves making the narco
tic available to addicts under controlled cir
cumstances so addicts can attempt a withdrawal
from the drug while getting it in an atmosphere that
eliminates illegal trafficking and assures the heroin
is not so strong as to induce a fatal overdose
Carter meets with economic experts
Plains, Ga. — President-elect Jimmy Carter met
with 16 bankers, businessmen and economists yes
terday as his running-mate continued to apply
jaw-boning pressure on the nation's steel industry
to roll back recent price increases.
The meeting was attended by some of the na
tion's leading Democratic economic figures. Carter
has made it known that the guest list includes the
names of persons likely to be chosen as secretary of
the treasury, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, secretary of commerce and other top
economic posts.
Before the meeting, Vice President-elect Walter
Mondale called the increase "very unfortunate"
and said it may forecast an "ominous" pattern for
the economy if other major industries follow the
lead of big steel.
U.N. admits Angola; U.S. abstains
United Nations, N.Y. — The General Assembly
admitted Angola to United Nations membership
yesterday by a vote of 116-0.
The United States, which had once vetoed the
former Portuguese African colony's admission in
t he Security Council, abstained in yesterday's vote.

by the council, which must approve membership
bids before they can be acted upon by the General
Assembly. The United States also abstained in the
Security Council vote.
Chevettes recalled for loose caps
Detroit — General Motors Corp. is recalling all
175,000 of its 1976 Chevrolet Chevettes because
some of the cars may have loose fuel tank caps,
which could increase the chances of a fire in an

dav that the caps may not seal properly because ot
excessive solder on the internal threads of the fuel
tank tiller neck.

ceived no tield reports of tires or injuries resulting

Panama Canal security threatened
Washington -- The Panamanian government
wants Jimmy Carte r to conclude a new Panama
Ca lal treaty within a year after he becomes presi
dent to prevent tiif security situation from worsen
ing.
Qualified informants in touch with the negotiat
ing teams reported thai word of Panamanian Gen.

Omar Torrijos' attitude has been conveyed to high
officials in the Ford administration. They, in turn,
have passed their own appraisal to the President
elect.
This appraisal, according to the sources, suggests
that any threats to the security of the American
manned Canal Zone are more likely to come from
within Panama itself than from any foreign coun
try. It is an assessment evidently shared by the U.S.
State and Defense departments.
Informants said U.S. intelligence authorities
have noted that some Panamanian elements,
perhaps anticipating a need to use force, have made
contact with foreign groups and governments
which have developed sophisticated techniques of
guerrilla warfare.
