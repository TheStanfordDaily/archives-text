One Hundred Years
1876-1976

1876 Governor Leland Stanford bought
his first 650 acre farm on the San Fran
cisco Peninsula that would become his
celebrated Palo Alto Stock Farm arid
later the site of Stanford University. Of
his final total of 8,247.64 acres in the
area, the first parcel, known as the May
field Grange Farm, was adjacent to San
Francisquito Creek, the boundary be
tween San Mateo and Santa Clara Coun
ties. It had been the country home of
George Gordon,'prominent developer of
early San Francisco. The Gordon-

Stanford house served as the original Children's Hospi
tal at Stanford.

1886 Having planted fine quality
varietal grapes on. large parts of the
farm in the summer of 1886, Stan
ford began constructing near his
a handsome three-story brick
winery which was completed in
June, 1888. The lower of the three
floors of the winery was devoted to
cellarage, the second was a ferment-

ing room, and the third floor was used for crushing.
Grapes were carried from the ground to the third floor
by a chain elevator for crushing. The juice and skins
were taken by chutes to the second floor for fermenta
tion. The new wine was then pumped to first floor
aging tanks. The machinery for these operations was
run by a steam engine housed in the small brick build
ing 65 feet to the rear of the winery. The high quality
aged wines were sold under the Palo Alto trademark
and were also in easy access to the Stanfords' dining
tables. Stanford saw wine as a positive factor in the
promotion of health, relaxation and temperance. "Its
general use among the people as a beverage in the
family, on the dining table, is beneficial rather than
detrimental."
1891 Stanford University opened its doors to 400 stu
dents. While President Benjamin Harrison was visiting
the new campus, the winery was one of the features of

his tour.
1906 The winery was so solidly
built that it survived the great
earthquake undamaged while
many of the nearby aesthetic
stone and concrete University
structures and the brick addition
to the Stan fords' home crumbled
into heaps of rubble. On the sec
ond floor there were rows of
beautifully carved, highly pol-

ished oak puncheons, each carrying 84 gallons of wine.
Their weight alone would have caused any but the
stoutest and best designed beams and posts to collapse.
But the casks were undisturbed by the earth's severe
tremors.
1915 Due to the Lack of profits and the ratification of
the 18th Amendment the vines were uprooted and the
vineyard was leased for growing hay, tomatoes, straw
berries and flowers.
1916 At the closing of the Panama-Pacific Interna
tional Exposition in San Francisco, Herbert Fleish
hacker. Sr. acquired a prize exhibition herd of Holstein
cows. For his Carnation Milk Company Fleishhacker
leased over 200 acres of land surrounding the winery
for grazing and hay land and converted the idle winery
into a milking barn. This was convenient for Fleish
hacker since he also summered in nearby Atherton and
the lease provided a place to keep his riding horses.

1932 The Stanford Barn was leased by
R. W. Krobitzsch, and the famed herd of
about 200 cows of the Troutmere Dairy
Farm were moved from La Honda. Such
care was taken to place in the brick struc
ture every possible modern convenience
and improvement that the regular Govern
ment inspectors declared it to be singularly
outstanding. The Troutmere cattle, known
as the aristocrats of cowdom, were pure
bred Guernseys, which meant that the an
cestry of each animal could be traced back
to the original stock of the Channel Islands

of England. The Stanford Barn thus became the home
to Topsy, the largest milk producer in the U.S., and her
son, Troutmere Lindberg, the grand champion bull.

1941 Peninsula Creamery took
over the facility in 1941, supply
ing its product from The Barn to
the burgeoning^Peninsula until ur
ban encroachment dictated their
moving.
1948 The American Breeders
Association established its national
headquarters at The Stanford
Barn and made possible an impor
tant upgrading of the American
crttle industry. The Association

used The Barn to stable an array of the country's prized
bulls for their scientific breeding service and research.

1954 The Stanford Shopping Center was opened near
by, starting a new trend throughout the country in sub
urban centers. (The closest Center neighbors to The
Stanford Bam, Saks, opened in 1963, and Bullock's
joined the ranks in 1972.) The Stanford University
Medical Center was under construction on the other
side of The Stanford Barn for a 1959 opening, and this
rapid growth proved too much for the breeders who
moved their headquarters to rural Wisconsin. For a
brief period The Bam stood vacant or was used nom
inally for storage. Planners sought ways to utilize the
historic building, but they began to consider razing the
fine old structure.
1961 The Stanford Barn was rescued from its dor
mant, endangered stage by architect John Bolles, his
assistant John Drum, and investors who long-term
leased the building and surrounding 4 acres from Stan
ford University and converted it to a shopping facility
featuring an international variety of food stalls, a meat
market, a banking house and a stock brokerage firm.
It was a pioneering effort among those making adaptive
commercial uses for structurally sound, beautiful old
buildings. Within the following decade such practice
would become the popular thing to do in restoration
and recycling.
1975 Following a succession of owners, property
managers and tenants, Bruce Ricks of Atherton and
Alan Becker of San Francisco formed Stanford Barn
Enterprises and acquired the 31 year leasehold in The
Stanford Bam property until 2006. The year 1975 was
spent in architecture, planning and tenant analysis.
1976 In the 100 year centennial of Leland Stanford's
purchase of his farm on the San Francisco Peninsula,
Stanford Barn Enterprises is conducting a renovation
and revitalization of this historic property. Built as a
winery, used as a dairy barn and headquarters for a
breeders association, then a food, retail and financial
center—in 1976, The Stanford Bam creates even more
attractive shops and dining in an historic setting.




FOOD SERVICE — Food has always been very
important in the Barn's history. From its inception
by Leland Stanford to produce fine wines, the focus
shifted to a dairy herd where milk products came to
be delivered to area residents by Peninsula

Creamery. We owe some improvements in the
quality of beef in the U.S. to research in cattle
breeding conducted at The Barn. In 1961 much of
the Barn was converted to international food service

stalls and take-out items. Remember the donuts,
seafood, smokehouse and butcher shop? Changes
continue at The Barn to bring you quality food at
reasonable prices.
CLOTHING AND GIFTS — What does The Barn
have for men and women? The answer is much
choice now and more to come. For the males. The
North Face satisfies outdoor needs for summer and
winter while Ltd. will dress him up to

satisfy his indoor and patio requirements. For the
female. The Girl Friend provides fashions and
accessories; The North Face supplies parkas and the
latest style in vests. Men and women, boys and girls
will enjoy the great variety of gifts at The Cupola,

Gallerie La Petite, The Florist, the delicious
Stanford Candy House — or how about a design-it

Shirt Company.

the new campus, the winery was one of the features of

his tour.
1906 The winery was so solidly
built that it survived the great
earthquake undamaged while
many of the nearby aesthetic
stone and concrete University
structures and the brick addition
to the Stan fords' home crumbled
into heaps of rubble. On the sec
ond floor there were rows of
beautifully carved, highly pol-

ished oak puncheons, each carrying 84 gallons of wine.
Their weight alone would have caused any but the
stoutest and best designed beams and posts to collapse.
But the casks were undisturbed by the earth's severe
tremors.
1915 Due to the Lack of profits and the ratification of
the 18th Amendment the vines were uprooted and the
vineyard was leased for growing hay, tomatoes, straw
berries and flowers.
1916 At the closing of the Panama-Pacific Interna
tional Exposition in San Francisco, Herbert Fleish
hacker. Sr. acquired a prize exhibition herd of Holstein
cows. For his Carnation Milk Company Fleishhacker
leased over 200 acres of land surrounding the winery
for grazing and hay land and converted the idle winery
into a milking barn. This was convenient for Fleish
hacker since he also summered in nearby Atherton and
the lease provided a place to keep his riding horses.

1932 The Stanford Barn was leased by
R. W. Krobitzsch, and the famed herd of
about 200 cows of the Troutmere Dairy
Farm were moved from La Honda. Such
care was taken to place in the brick struc
ture every possible modern convenience
and improvement that the regular Govern
ment inspectors declared it to be singularly
outstanding. The Troutmere cattle, known
as the aristocrats of cowdom, were pure
bred Guernseys, which meant that the an
cestry of each animal could be traced back
to the original stock of the Channel Islands

of England. The Stanford Barn thus became the home
to Topsy, the largest milk producer in the U.S., and her
son, Troutmere Lindberg, the grand champion bull.

1941 Peninsula Creamery took
over the facility in 1941, supply
ing its product from The Barn to
the burgeoning^Peninsula until ur
ban encroachment dictated their
moving.
1948 The American Breeders
Association established its national
headquarters at The Stanford
Barn and made possible an impor
tant upgrading of the American
crttle industry. The Association

used The Barn to stable an array of the country's prized
bulls for their scientific breeding service and research.

1954 The Stanford Shopping Center was opened near
by, starting a new trend throughout the country in sub
urban centers. (The closest Center neighbors to The
Stanford Bam, Saks, opened in 1963, and Bullock's
joined the ranks in 1972.) The Stanford University
Medical Center was under construction on the other
side of The Stanford Barn for a 1959 opening, and this
rapid growth proved too much for the breeders who
moved their headquarters to rural Wisconsin. For a
brief period The Bam stood vacant or was used nom
inally for storage. Planners sought ways to utilize the
historic building, but they began to consider razing the
fine old structure.
1961 The Stanford Barn was rescued from its dor
mant, endangered stage by architect John Bolles, his
assistant John Drum, and investors who long-term
leased the building and surrounding 4 acres from Stan
ford University and converted it to a shopping facility
featuring an international variety of food stalls, a meat
market, a banking house and a stock brokerage firm.
It was a pioneering effort among those making adaptive
commercial uses for structurally sound, beautiful old
buildings. Within the following decade such practice
would become the popular thing to do in restoration
and recycling.
1975 Following a succession of owners, property
managers and tenants, Bruce Ricks of Atherton and
Alan Becker of San Francisco formed Stanford Barn
Enterprises and acquired the 31 year leasehold in The
Stanford Bam property until 2006. The year 1975 was
spent in architecture, planning and tenant analysis.
1976 In the 100 year centennial of Leland Stanford's
purchase of his farm on the San Francisco Peninsula,
Stanford Barn Enterprises is conducting a renovation
and revitalization of this historic property. Built as a
winery, used as a dairy barn and headquarters for a
breeders association, then a food, retail and financial
center—in 1976, The Stanford Bam creates even more
attractive shops and dining in an historic setting.




FOOD SERVICE — Food has always been very
important in the Barn's history. From its inception
by Leland Stanford to produce fine wines, the focus
shifted to a dairy herd where milk products came to
be delivered to area residents by Peninsula

Creamery. We owe some improvements in the
quality of beef in the U.S. to research in cattle
breeding conducted at The Barn. In 1961 much of
the Barn was converted to international food service

stalls and take-out items. Remember the donuts,
seafood, smokehouse and butcher shop? Changes
continue at The Barn to bring you quality food at
reasonable prices.
CLOTHING AND GIFTS — What does The Barn
have for men and women? The answer is much
choice now and more to come. For the males. The
North Face satisfies outdoor needs for summer and
winter while Ltd. will dress him up to

satisfy his indoor and patio requirements. For the
female. The Girl Friend provides fashions and
accessories; The North Face supplies parkas and the
latest style in vests. Men and women, boys and girls
will enjoy the great variety of gifts at The Cupola,

Gallerie La Petite, The Florist, the delicious
Stanford Candy House — or how about a design-it

One Hundred Years
1876-1976

1876 Governor Leland Stanford bought
his first 650 acre farm on the San Fran
cisco Peninsula that would become his
celebrated Palo Alto Stock Farm arid
later the site of Stanford University. Of
his final total of 8,247.64 acres in the
area, the first parcel, known as the May
field Grange Farm, was adjacent to San
Francisquito Creek, the boundary be
tween San Mateo and Santa Clara Coun
ties. It had been the country home of
George Gordon,'prominent developer of
early San Francisco. The Gordon-

Stanford house served as the original Children's Hospi
tal at Stanford.

1886 Having planted fine quality
varietal grapes on. large parts of the
farm in the summer of 1886, Stan
ford began constructing near his
a handsome three-story brick
winery which was completed in
June, 1888. The lower of the three
floors of the winery was devoted to
cellarage, the second was a ferment-

ing room, and the third floor was used for crushing.
Grapes were carried from the ground to the third floor
by a chain elevator for crushing. The juice and skins
were taken by chutes to the second floor for fermenta
tion. The new wine was then pumped to first floor
aging tanks. The machinery for these operations was
run by a steam engine housed in the small brick build
ing 65 feet to the rear of the winery. The high quality
aged wines were sold under the Palo Alto trademark
and were also in easy access to the Stanfords' dining
tables. Stanford saw wine as a positive factor in the
promotion of health, relaxation and temperance. "Its
general use among the people as a beverage in the
family, on the dining table, is beneficial rather than
detrimental."

of England. The Stanford Barn thus became the home
to Topsy, the largest milk producer in the U.S., and her
son, Troutmere Lindberg, the grand champion bull.

1941 Peninsula Creamery took
over the facility in 1941, supply
ing its product from The Barn to
the burgeoning^Peninsula until ur
ban encroachment dictated their
moving.
1948 The American Breeders
Association established its national
headquarters at The Stanford
Barn and made possible an impor
tant upgrading of the American
crttle industry. The Association

used The Barn to stable an array of the country's prized
bulls for their scientific breeding service and research.

1954 The Stanford Shopping Center was opened near
by, starting a new trend throughout the country in sub
urban centers. (The closest Center neighbors to The
Stanford Bam, Saks, opened in 1963, and Bullock's
joined the ranks in 1972.) The Stanford University
Medical Center was under construction on the other
side of The Stanford Barn for a 1959 opening, and this
rapid growth proved too much for the breeders who
moved their headquarters to rural Wisconsin. For a
brief period The Bam stood vacant or was used nom
inally for storage. Planners sought ways to utilize the
historic building, but they began to consider razing the
fine old structure.
1961 The Stanford Barn was rescued from its dor
mant, endangered stage by architect John Bolles, his
assistant John Drum, and investors who long-term
leased the building and surrounding 4 acres from Stan
ford University and converted it to a shopping facility
featuring an international variety of food stalls, a meat
market, a banking house and a stock brokerage firm.
It was a pioneering effort among those making adaptive
commercial uses for structurally sound, beautiful old
buildings. Within the following decade such practice
would become the popular thing to do in restoration
and recycling.
1975 Following a succession of owners, property
managers and tenants, Bruce Ricks of Atherton and
Alan Becker of San Francisco formed Stanford Barn
Enterprises and acquired the 31 year leasehold in The
Stanford Bam property until 2006. The year 1975 was
spent in architecture, planning and tenant analysis.
1976 In the 100 year centennial of Leland Stanford's
purchase of his farm on the San Francisco Peninsula,
Stanford Barn Enterprises is conducting a renovation
and revitalization of this historic property. Built as a
winery, used as a dairy barn and headquarters for a
breeders association, then a food, retail and financial
center—in 1976, The Stanford Bam creates even more
attractive shops and dining in an historic setting.




FOOD SERVICE — Food has always been very
important in the Barn's history. From its inception
by Leland Stanford to produce fine wines, the focus
shifted to a dairy herd where milk products came to
be delivered to area residents by Peninsula

Creamery. We owe some improvements in the
quality of beef in the U.S. to research in cattle
breeding conducted at The Barn. In 1961 much of
the Barn was converted to international food service

stalls and take-out items. Remember the donuts,
seafood, smokehouse and butcher shop? Changes
continue at The Barn to bring you quality food at
reasonable prices.
CLOTHING AND GIFTS — What does The Barn
have for men and women? The answer is much
choice now and more to come. For the males. The
North Face satisfies outdoor needs for summer and
winter while Ltd. will dress him up to

satisfy his indoor and patio requirements. For the
female. The Girl Friend provides fashions and
accessories; The North Face supplies parkas and the
latest style in vests. Men and women, boys and girls
will enjoy the great variety of gifts at The Cupola,

Gallerie La Petite, The Florist, the delicious
Stanford Candy House — or how about a design-it

Shirt Company.
One Hundred Years
1876-1976

1876 Governor Leland Stanford bought
his first 650 acre farm on the San Fran
cisco Peninsula that would become his
celebrated Palo Alto Stock Farm arid
later the site of Stanford University. Of
his final total of 8,247.64 acres in the
area, the first parcel, known as the May
field Grange Farm, was adjacent to San
Francisquito Creek, the boundary be
tween San Mateo and Santa Clara Coun
ties. It had been the country home of
George Gordon,'prominent developer of
early San Francisco. The Gordon-

Stanford house served as the original Children's Hospi
tal at Stanford.

1886 Having planted fine quality
varietal grapes on. large parts of the
farm in the summer of 1886, Stan
ford began constructing near his
a handsome three-story brick
winery which was completed in
June, 1888. The lower of the three
floors of the winery was devoted to
cellarage, the second was a ferment-

ing room, and the third floor was used for crushing.
Grapes were carried from the ground to the third floor
by a chain elevator for crushing. The juice and skins
were taken by chutes to the second floor for fermenta
tion. The new wine was then pumped to first floor
aging tanks. The machinery for these operations was
run by a steam engine housed in the small brick build
ing 65 feet to the rear of the winery. The high quality
aged wines were sold under the Palo Alto trademark
and were also in easy access to the Stanfords' dining
tables. Stanford saw wine as a positive factor in the
promotion of health, relaxation and temperance. "Its
general use among the people as a beverage in the
family, on the dining table, is beneficial rather than
detrimental."
1891 Stanford University opened its doors to 400 stu
dents. While President Benjamin Harrison was visiting
the new campus, the winery was one of the features of

his tour.
1906 The winery was so solidly
built that it survived the great
earthquake undamaged while
many of the nearby aesthetic
stone and concrete University
structures and the brick addition
to the Stan fords' home crumbled
into heaps of rubble. On the sec
ond floor there were rows of
beautifully carved, highly pol-

ished oak puncheons, each carrying 84 gallons of wine.
Their weight alone would have caused any but the
stoutest and best designed beams and posts to collapse.
But the casks were undisturbed by the earth's severe
tremors.
1915 Due to the Lack of profits and the ratification of
the 18th Amendment the vines were uprooted and the
vineyard was leased for growing hay, tomatoes, straw
berries and flowers.
1916 At the closing of the Panama-Pacific Interna
tional Exposition in San Francisco, Herbert Fleish
hacker. Sr. acquired a prize exhibition herd of Holstein
cows. For his Carnation Milk Company Fleishhacker
leased over 200 acres of land surrounding the winery
for grazing and hay land and converted the idle winery
into a milking barn. This was convenient for Fleish
hacker since he also summered in nearby Atherton and
the lease provided a place to keep his riding horses.

1932 The Stanford Barn was leased by
R. W. Krobitzsch, and the famed herd of
about 200 cows of the Troutmere Dairy
Farm were moved from La Honda. Such
care was taken to place in the brick struc
ture every possible modern convenience
and improvement that the regular Govern
ment inspectors declared it to be singularly
outstanding. The Troutmere cattle, known
as the aristocrats of cowdom, were pure
bred Guernseys, which meant that the an
cestry of each animal could be traced back
to the original stock of the Channel Islands

of England. The Stanford Barn thus became the home
to Topsy, the largest milk producer in the U.S., and her

FOOD SERVICE — Food has always been very
important in the Barn's history. From its inception
by Leland Stanford to produce fine wines, the focus
shifted to a dairy herd where milk products came to
be delivered to area residents by Peninsula

Creamery. We owe some improvements in the
quality of beef in the U.S. to research in cattle
breeding conducted at The Barn. In 1961 much of
the Barn was converted to international food service

stalls and take-out items. Remember the donuts,
seafood, smokehouse and butcher shop? Changes
continue at The Barn to bring you quality food at
reasonable prices.
CLOTHING AND GIFTS — What does The Barn
have for men and women? The answer is much
choice now and more to come. For the males. The
North Face satisfies outdoor needs for summer and
winter while Ltd. will dress him up to

satisfy his indoor and patio requirements. For the
female. The Girl Friend provides fashions and

One Hundred Years
1876-1976

1876 Governor Leland Stanford bought
his first 650 acre farm on the San Fran
cisco Peninsula that would become his
celebrated Palo Alto Stock Farm arid
later the site of Stanford University. Of
his final total of 8,247.64 acres in the
area, the first parcel, known as the May
field Grange Farm, was adjacent to San
Francisquito Creek, the boundary be
tween San Mateo and Santa Clara Coun
ties. It had been the country home of
George Gordon,'prominent developer of
early San Francisco. The Gordon-

Stanford house served as the original Children's Hospi
tal at Stanford.

1886 Having planted fine quality
varietal grapes on. large parts of the
farm in the summer of 1886, Stan
ford began constructing near his
a handsome three-story brick
winery which was completed in
June, 1888. The lower of the three
floors of the winery was devoted to
cellarage, the second was a ferment-

ing room, and the third floor was used for crushing.
Grapes were carried from the ground to the third floor
by a chain elevator for crushing. The juice and skins
were taken by chutes to the second floor for fermenta
tion. The new wine was then pumped to first floor
aging tanks. The machinery for these operations was
run by a steam engine housed in the small brick build
ing 65 feet to the rear of the winery. The high quality
aged wines were sold under the Palo Alto trademark
and were also in easy access to the Stanfords' dining
tables. Stanford saw wine as a positive factor in the
promotion of health, relaxation and temperance. "Its
general use among the people as a beverage in the
family, on the dining table, is beneficial rather than
detrimental."
1891 Stanford University opened its doors to 400 stu
dents. While President Benjamin Harrison was visiting
the new campus, the winery was one of the features of

his tour.
1906 The winery was so solidly
built that it survived the great
earthquake undamaged while
many of the nearby aesthetic
stone and concrete University
structures and the brick addition
to the Stan fords' home crumbled
into heaps of rubble. On the sec
ond floor there were rows of
beautifully carved, highly pol-

ished oak puncheons, each carrying 84 gallons of wine.
Their weight alone would have caused any but the
stoutest and best designed beams and posts to collapse.
But the casks were undisturbed by the earth's severe
tremors.
1915 Due to the Lack of profits and the ratification of
the 18th Amendment the vines were uprooted and the
vineyard was leased for growing hay, tomatoes, straw
berries and flowers.
1916 At the closing of the Panama-Pacific Interna
tional Exposition in San Francisco, Herbert Fleish
hacker. Sr. acquired a prize exhibition herd of Holstein
cows. For his Carnation Milk Company Fleishhacker
leased over 200 acres of land surrounding the winery
for grazing and hay land and converted the idle winery
into a milking barn. This was convenient for Fleish
hacker since he also summered in nearby Atherton and
the lease provided a place to keep his riding horses.

1932 The Stanford Barn was leased by
R. W. Krobitzsch, and the famed herd of
about 200 cows of the Troutmere Dairy
Farm were moved from La Honda. Such
care was taken to place in the brick struc
ture every possible modern convenience
and improvement that the regular Govern
ment inspectors declared it to be singularly
outstanding. The Troutmere cattle, known
as the aristocrats of cowdom, were pure
bred Guernseys, which meant that the an
cestry of each animal could be traced back
to the original stock of the Channel Islands

of England. The Stanford Barn thus became the home
to Topsy, the largest milk producer in the U.S., and her
son, Troutmere Lindberg, the grand champion bull.

1941 Peninsula Creamery took
over the facility in 1941, supply
ing its product from The Barn to
the burgeoning^Peninsula until ur
ban encroachment dictated their
moving.
1948 The American Breeders
Association established its national
headquarters at The Stanford
Barn and made possible an impor
tant upgrading of the American
crttle industry. The Association

used The Barn to stable an array of the country's prized
bulls for their scientific breeding service and research.

1954 The Stanford Shopping Center was opened near
by, starting a new trend throughout the country in sub
urban centers. (The closest Center neighbors to The
Stanford Bam, Saks, opened in 1963, and Bullock's
joined the ranks in 1972.) The Stanford University
Medical Center was under construction on the other
side of The Stanford Barn for a 1959 opening, and this
rapid growth proved too much for the breeders who
moved their headquarters to rural Wisconsin. For a
brief period The Bam stood vacant or was used nom
inally for storage. Planners sought ways to utilize the
historic building, but they began to consider razing the
fine old structure.
1961 The Stanford Barn was rescued from its dor
mant, endangered stage by architect John Bolles, his
assistant John Drum, and investors who long-term
leased the building and surrounding 4 acres from Stan
ford University and converted it to a shopping facility
featuring an international variety of food stalls, a meat
market, a banking house and a stock brokerage firm.
It was a pioneering effort among those making adaptive
commercial uses for structurally sound, beautiful old
buildings. Within the following decade such practice
would become the popular thing to do in restoration
and recycling.
1975 Following a succession of owners, property
managers and tenants, Bruce Ricks of Atherton and
Alan Becker of San Francisco formed Stanford Barn
Enterprises and acquired the 31 year leasehold in The
Stanford Bam property until 2006. The year 1975 was
spent in architecture, planning and tenant analysis.
1976 In the 100 year centennial of Leland Stanford's
purchase of his farm on the San Francisco Peninsula,
Stanford Barn Enterprises is conducting a renovation
and revitalization of this historic property. Built as a
winery, used as a dairy barn and headquarters for a
