IN THE COURTYARD â€” The 1976 performances
of Brown Bag Opera and The Theatreworks
premiere production of Gibson Girl gave hints of
the many activities planned for the courtyard of The

Stanford Barn. We want you to feel welcome to read
the paper and enjoy coffee or beverage, to hold a
business or social meeting or to rest your shopping
legs in the sunny patio. Periodically, performances,

fashion shows and other attractions will be offered
for your pleasure. Other improvements to land
scaping, parking, exterior surfaces and signage will
harmonize with The Barn.
