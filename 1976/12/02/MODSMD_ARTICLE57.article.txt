WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE BARN?
Many customers have wandered through The
Stanford Barn and tried to decipher the construction
activity. Local residents have taken out-of-town
visitors on a tour. They explain The Barn's history as
a winery, dairy, breeder-bull experiment station,
then its 1961 conversion to an international food
stall facility with early accompanying tenants such
as bank, stockbroker, decorator, a butcher shop and
a travel desk. These tour leaders are hard pressed to
tell their guest what the current changes mean.
Employees working in the neighboring offices,
Stanford Hospital, and Stanford Shopping Center
and those attending Stanford — are looking for
lunch or coffee and see the closing of food stalls.
They wonder what the tenancy changes mean.
We thank you for asking and appreciate your taking
the time to read about activities in a building whose
important history has been previously described.
Let's see if we can answer your questions.
WHO IS MAKING THE CHANGES?
On New Year's Eve 1974, Stanford Barn Enterprises
acquired the leasehold interest until 2006 of the
building and 4 acres of land leased from Stanford
University. SBE, as we call it, is simply a partnership
of Bruce Ricks of Atherton and Alan Becker of San
Francisco. Bruce is Managing Partner of The Bam .
Bruce has a Ph.D. from U.C. Berkeley, was a
professor and assistant dean of business and then of
urban planning and architecture at UCLA, then
chief economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board in Washington, D.C. Now he teaches in the
U.C. Berkeley Business School, consults, lectures
occasionally at Stanford and spends many hours in
SBE's office at The Barn administering its changes.
Alan Becker, a graduate of Dartmouth and the
Harvard Business School, operated J&B Shoes, the
women's shoe operation in 39 Joseph Magnin stores.
Alan divides his time between the financial affairs of
A.C.T., The American Conservatory Theater,
which is converting the Geary Theater for its use,
consulting and board memberships, managing
University Mall Shopping Center across from the
University of California Davis and helping Bruce on
The Barn's promotions and development. Bruce and
Alan are deeply committed to a major, long term
revitalization of the building which they consider
important to the Peninsula. We continually say,
"Let's not use glue, paint and bandaids, let's do it
right for the next 30 years."

WHAT HAS HAPPENED UPSTAIRS?
We decided to start the renovation and
revitalization at The Stanford Barn from the top,
down. The second floor was partially vacant, and

the third floor had not been in active use since it was
used for grape fermenting from 1888-1915 and
storing hay from then to the 1940'5. Much of the
activity you have seen at The Barn involves building
retail space on the south side and office space on the
north side of the third floor and exposing the
beautiful posts and beams, cupolas, rafters, brick
walls and arches so that the public can experience
the building structure.
OFFICE AREA — Conforming to and emphasizing
the original construction which has handsome
wooden beams and posts 11' on center, office bays
have been created 1 l'x22' which are combined or
divided into offices to suit tenant needs. Some
spaces have polished natural wooden floors with
Persian or throw rugs. Others have carpet and
traditional ceilings — built 13' high — no cramped
feeling here. The 3000' office loft area on the north
side of the third level permits tenants and their
customers to enjoy the natural light and
spaciousness of high beamed ceilings, a rooftop
cupola and the planned restoration of the former
hayloft door. Tenants beginning to occupy the north
side are a unique combination befitting the
surroundings. The first is the Scientific Press
operated by Paul Kelly, its founder, who was an
editor with Houghton Mifflin Co. and most recently
with Science Research Associates before beginning
his own firm in 1974. Scientific Press publishes
college text books and its own original publications.
The firm also publishes 40 titles sponsored by
Hewlett Packard in the area of computer assisted
texts. The Barn is now home for technical journals,
phototypesetting, and advanced typing service for
discriminating clients.

RETAIL AREA — In what might seem at first and
even second glance to be musical chairs to the
accompaniment of hammer and saw, tenants are
relocating in newly renovated space. After
Christmas the second and third floor of The Barn
will have retail merchandise and services, displays
and decor which will make you want to wander
through the building. New handsome stairways and
a renewed elevator bring shoppers to a beautiful
display of the right merchandise for your leisure
pleasure.
The musical chairs become moving barber chairs as
John McGrath, Scotland's answer to Sassoon,
moves two bays south. Sandy Warren changes both
the name and location of Trudie's dressmaking
business as handsome new quarters are now ready
for her occupancy. The patient customers of

Elizabeth Bakonyi's Custom Coiffures can at last
stop worrying about sawdust in their hair, the tenth
new temporary path to the beauty shop and the
game of "guess where the restroom is this week."
Thanks go to the exciting yet eminently practical
architecture of Herand der Sarkissian of Bull Field
Volkmann Stockwell who are also the architectural
firm for the Stanford Shopping Center, to the
structural engineering firm G.F.D.S. and their
engineer Otto Avvakumovits, this firm being known
particularly for its restoration experience which did
Ghirardelli Square and The Ice House engineering,
and to the respectful attention to detail and tenant
and customer needs by the contractor C.M. Peletz
CO. and their subcontractors. Construction on the
third and second floors is being concluded with a
handsome interior stairway and opening so Barn
visitors can easily see the structure, shop the shops
and seek the services upstairs.

WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN DOWNSTAIRS?
Visitors to The Stanford Barn have seen the Italian,
Mexican and Hofbrau stalls close. We have
negotiated purchase of these leases from the
operators in order to make space available for a
combination of retail and dining establishments.
With a commitment to exposing the architecture of
the historic structure and to quality and con
venience of food and retail products, we are drafting
plans to sandblast the brick, open up the ceilings,
renovate some tenant spaces, and redecorate the
"common areas" — shopping center talk for where
you are when you are going from one merchant to
another.
The first new food tenant, Mione's Old World
Delicatessen from Newport Beach-Balboa, makes
The Barn headquarters for its entry into Northern
California, bringing the recipes of Mama Mione to
us through the enthusiasm of son Carlo for luncheon
and evening dining or picnics under the Stanford
palms.
Shortly after you buy your Christmas candy Stanford
Candy House will be completely remodeled so you
can see the candymaker Achilles (K illy) Massahos as
you snack from their always present plate of peanut
brittle.
Interspersed with food service in the plan are new
retail boutiques of the quality of The Cupola, en
thusiastically opened by Lee Collins and Valerie
Waggott who join The Barn Merchants to bring you
quality products and service.



PEOPLE AT WORK ON THE BARN — The
merchants and management of The Stanford Barn
are very proud of the championship team of con

tractor and subcontractors. These people
demonstrate deep respect for the original structure
and take care to integrate the new with the old.

They meet the latest structural code requirements
while minimizing the changes to the ninety year old
building.
