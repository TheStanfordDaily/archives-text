# Land awarded to peasants
## Mexico's president sworn in 
### 
Mexico City (AP) — Jose Lopez Por
tillo was sworn in yesterday as presi
dent of Mexico as his predecessor, in
one of his last acts, awarded to Mexi
can peasants titles to 1.1 million acres
of land that had previously been ex
propriated.
Outgoing President Luis Echeverria
also ordered a new expropriation of
8668 acres of land, to be split up into
60,200 small plots for peasants'
homes, the Agrarian Reform Ministry
said.
The ministry did not specify the lo
cations of either the newly exprop

riated land or the land for which titles
were awarded.
The 1.1. million acres had been ex
propriated at various times since
Mexico's 1910 revolution but was pre
viously worked by peasants who did
not actually have title to it. Echever
ria's decrees formally awarded the
land to about 32.000 peasants.
Business-oriented
In his inaugration speech, Lopez
Portillo indicated his administration
would return to more business
orienteo policies and swing the coun
try toward the right.

Lopez Portillo. a former treasury
minister, accepted the red, white and
green presidential sash from Echever
ria at Mexico City's National Au
ditorium, where representatives of 102
countries gathered for the ceremonies.
In his remarks, Lopez Portillo said
redistribution of income to help the
poor share more of the country's
wealth should be based on creating
more jobs.
Emphasis on production
He made clear his government
would emphasize production and re
storing faith of the business sector in
the government. Mexico has been suf
fering from high inflation, a weakened
peso, high unemployment and the
flight of capital abroad.
Lopez Portillo, who could suspend
Echeverria's land expropriation de
crees, noted that there are real limita
tions to land redistribution.
In the past Mexico's, agricultural
problems have been as much political
as technical, with the government por
tioning out land to peasants who can
not produce efficiently in large quan
tities.
Loophole?
Under Mexican law it is illegal for an
individual to own more than 250 acres
of land. Wealthy families have divided
their large holdings among individual
family members and claim they have
met the requirements of the law.
About two weeks ago Echeverria ex
propriated 243,000 acres of ranch and
farmland in the northern state of Son
ora. Protesting the move, ranchers and
farmers halted all agricultural work
and parked their tractors and other
farm equipment on the streets of
Ciudad Obregon.
Businessmen in 41 cities closed their
stores and factories in one-day strikes
to show sympathy for the plight of the
dispossessed landonwers.
U.S. delegates at Lopez Portillo's in
auguration included Rosalynn Carter,
wife of President-elect Jimmy Carter;
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
and President Ford's son lack.

Loophole?
Under Mexican law it is illegal for an
individual to own more than 250 acres
of land. Wealthy families have divided
their large holdings among individual
family members and claim they have
met the requirements of the law.
About two weeks ago Echeverria ex
propriated 243,000 acres of ranch and
farmland in the northern state of Son
ora. Protesting the move, ranchers and
farmers halted all agricultural work
and parked their tractors and other
farm equipment on the streets of
Ciudad Obregon.
Businessmen in 41 cities closed their
stores and factories in one-day strikes
to show sympathy for the plight of the
dispossessed landonwers.
U.S. delegates at Lopez Portillo's in
auguration included Rosalynn Carter,
wife of President-elect Jimmy Carter;
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
and President Ford's son lack.
Mexico City (AP) — Jose Lopez Por
tillo was sworn in yesterday as presi
dent of Mexico as his predecessor, in
one of his last acts, awarded to Mexi
can peasants titles to 1.1 million acres
of land that had previously been ex
propriated.
Outgoing President Luis Echeverria
also ordered a new expropriation of
8668 acres of land, to be split up into
60,200 small plots for peasants'
homes, the Agrarian Reform Ministry
said.
The ministry did not specify the lo
cations of either the newly exprop

riated land or the land for which titles
were awarded.
The 1.1. million acres had been ex
propriated at various times since
Mexico's 1910 revolution but was pre
viously worked by peasants who did
not actually have title to it. Echever
ria's decrees formally awarded the
land to about 32.000 peasants.
Business-oriented
In his inaugration speech, Lopez
Portillo indicated his administration
would return to more business
orienteo policies and swing the coun
try toward the right.

Lopez Portillo. a former treasury
minister, accepted the red, white and
green presidential sash from Echever
ria at Mexico City's National Au
ditorium, where representatives of 102
countries gathered for the ceremonies.
In his remarks, Lopez Portillo said
redistribution of income to help the
poor share more of the country's
wealth should be based on creating
more jobs.
Emphasis on production
He made clear his government
would emphasize production and re
storing faith of the business sector in
the government. Mexico has been suf
fering from high inflation, a weakened
peso, high unemployment and the
flight of capital abroad.
Lopez Portillo, who could suspend
Echeverria's land expropriation de
crees, noted that there are real limita
tions to land redistribution.
In the past Mexico's, agricultural
problems have been as much political
as technical, with the government por
tioning out land to peasants who can
not produce efficiently in large quan
tities.
