# ASSU Senate action on Western Civ issue irresponsible
## 
### 
Petroff, et al.

The "bad press" endured by ASSU
Senator Brad Krevoy (Doily, Nov. 30)
over his introduction of a badly
needed resolution calling for senate
action concerning the proposed West
ern Civilization requirement was un
warranted and grossly unfair.
Both the content and the timing of
this particular resolution de
monstrated Krevoy's competence in
this area; in contrast, the failure of the
senate as a whole to grasp the impor
tance of this resolution is indicative of
its ineptitude.
Basically, the resolution, submitted
by Krevoy and Senator Tim Ferguson,
cited several serious problems with

the proposed Western Civ require
ments, not the least of which was the
recognition of the fact that the new
requirements would represent a blat
ant contradiction of the philosophies
and policies which followed the 1968
Study of Education at Stanford.
Resolution needed
Furthermore, the resolution called
for the senate to " . . . caution against
the reinstitution of (such) course re
quirements ..." Although this con
cluding clause seemed too weak to
many, the message of the resolution
I was clear, and it was particularly
, needed at the time.
i The Faculty Senate was to meet the

day following the ASSU Senate meet
ing, and the question of the Western
Civ requirement was on its agenda.
Student representatives to the Faculty
Senate felt strongly that their debating
position would be greatly enhanced by
a statement of support from the ASSU
Senate. In fact, they were consulted by
Krevoy, and played an active role in
the actual wording of the resolution.
The result was a carefully-worded
resolution which, if passed, would
have served as a strong statement from
the representative body of the stu
dents.
No justification for defeat
But, failing to appreciate theamount
of careful calculation and energy
which went into the drafting of the
resolution and failing to comprehend
the importance of its timing, the senate
defeated the resolution, offering no
justification other than vague allega
tions concerning the political aspira
tions of its sponsor.
The intent of this letter is only to
correct an injustice by letting the
community know that Brad Krevoy
did his homework and acted responsi
bly in this issue, and that the majority
of the other ASSU senators did not.
Furthermore, Stanford students
should know that this is not the first
such occurrence this year.
It is our hope that the majority of the
ASSU senators will one day soon wake
up to the realities that the issues they
deal with are important; that the man
ner in which they deal with them af
fects both current and future students;
and that if they won't deal with them
responsibly, who will?
