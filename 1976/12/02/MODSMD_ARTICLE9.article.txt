# Media hype reruns

### Russell Stockard 
With less than 25 shopping days left
until Christmas, you can bet your
January Mastercharge bill that human
interest stories will clutter the media
like "Free Gift Wrapping" signs in
crowded department stores. The
media munchkins, especially those
inhabiting the television corner, have
enjoyed an early Christmas with the
saga of Clarence Norris.
One of the so-called Scottsboro
Boys, a hoboing bunch of black youths,
Clarence Norris has brought his fight
to the court of public opinion and won
in the process a pardon for the rape he
claims he never committed.
Norris, a handsome 64-year-old
whose looks remind one of boxer Ar
chie Moore, skipped his Alabama
parole in 1946 to settle in New York. In
the last couple of months, Norris' face
has appeared regularly on the tube, a
study in strength and dignity as he
tried to articulate the emotions that led
him to seek a pardon after so many
years.
To Norris, the reasons behind his
quest were simple: he wanted to be a
free man in all 50 states — including
Alabama.
Bread-and-butter
Black people, even ones as nonver
bal as Norris, are the bread-and-butter
of television news features. If Norris
exudes a rough-hewn pride on a small
scale, that display is no less important
to the economic vitality of the medium
than the scuffling, shouted self
aggrandizements of a Muhammad Ali.
Both CBS radio and television news
saw fit to note Norris' return to
Alabama to receive his pardon in per
son. Without the pictures of Norris'
solemn expression, the radio account
left a bitter taste.
The last words from the correspon
dent informed listeners that Norris
was planning a nation-wide speaking
tour to tel I his story: an itinerary whose
motivation seemed monetary to this
writer.
Never mind, there were no such in
nuendoes left lying around the CBS
Evening News account of the Norris
denouement. There were still pictures
from the Scottsboro Trial. There was a
snapshot of Norris looking dapper as
the voiceover told of his flight from the
injustices of Alabama.
Never a slave
Then there was Norris, the old war
rior; like an Archie Moore who had
never played a slave in a Tom Sawyer
movie, receiving the pardon from an
Alabama white man his own age, a
man named Ussery. And the hand
shake of congratulations from an un
identified white woman, much
you nger.
In a Montgomery church once pas
tored by Martin Luther King, Norris
was a hero, surrounded by blacks the
likes of Roy Wilkins. retired head of
the NAACP. And CBS was there as the
tears welled in Clarence Norris' eyes.
The only thing missing was Charles

kuralt's honeyed bass intoning the be
nediction: "On the road in Montgom
ery, Alabama ..."
But what does it all mean? Why
build Clarence Norris into a personal
ity, a force, a property, if you will, at
this particular time? Clarence Norris
and his Scottsboro cohorts were a lib
eral cause ceJebre 40 years ago. The
rehabilitation of Clarence Norris on
the Alabama legal ledgers is a liberal
gesture, executed by liberals on both
sides of the Mason-Dixon line (an an
tiquated frontier whose time was pas
sed, no doubt).
Rehabilitation
The rehabilitation of Clarence Nor
ris is part of the rehabilitation of the
South, the New South, Jimmy Carter's
South.
Yes, the day after Jimmy Carter offi
cially thanked blacks gathered in a
Denver caucus for his electoral victory,
Clarence Norris claimed his official
pardon. One hundred years after
blacks were betrayed as Democrats,
anxious to return to power, leading the
nation in the retreat from the Republi
can Reconstruction, the first
President-Elect from the South in more
than a century freely acknowledges his
political debts. The Great Reconcilia
tion.
And Clarence Norris is the symbol.
The once vanquished South pays its
reparations in order to install in the
White House one of its sons, James Earl
Carter. And former Scottsboro boy
Clarence Norris uses his pardon to col
lect honorariums on the lecture tour,
the same way Muhammed Ali par
layed his exile from boxing into celeb
rity, the same way Nixon's pardon
freed him to start early on his memoirs,
guaranteed to make him a millionaire
several times over, and the same way
Nixon's White House loyalists gained
currency among college audiences
and book-of-the-month readers.
Nagging sameness
There is a nagging sameness about
all of it, the whole business of the
media elevating heroes and toppling
them amidst fanfare or brickbats. The
end product of media celebrations or
hatchet jobs is morally the same —
provided the subject has a clever
enough press agent — only the style
changes with the times and the
agenda.
Ford signs Nixon's pardon in order
to preside in relative domestic tran
quility. Wallace signs Norris' pardon
to assure Northern business that
Alabama offers a hospitable climate for
relocation.
Clarence Norris is in because Jimmy
Carter is in because both Southern and
Northern blacks were tired of being
out. Perhaps blacks have pardoned
Carter before he commits his crimes.
Perhaps not. CBS may have found the
answer to the riddle in celebrity-elect
Norris. Let us listen carefully to what
he has to say. courtesy of CBS.
