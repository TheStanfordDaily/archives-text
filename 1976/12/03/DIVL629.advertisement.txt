to be able to evaluate scientific claims and questions.
This seminar de? 3 with the elements of quantitative
thinking for non-scientists — the modern equivalent of hor

lines, how to think straight and pull your weight without
being a technologist The Socratic method will be used to
explore various topics of current interest (some mine, some
yours), such as energy consumption, solar power, auto
accidents. DES and cancer, fluorocarbons and the ozone
layer, mercury in fish, UFO's, ESP, recombinant DNA, TV
ads. radioactive waste, organic foods, reliability of polls,
etc., etc.
