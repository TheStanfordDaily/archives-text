The 10-4 Open Car Rally.
Take a Sunday Afternoon Drive With a Purpose
Dec. 12 in Los Altos
You've heard about auto rallying, but you may never have participated
in this intriguing sport. Well, the 10-4 Open Car Rally is for you. Rally
ing is not a test of how fast you can drive, but of how accurately a driver
and navigator can follow a detailed series of directions. Any kind of car
can win a rally, so you don't need a fancy sports car to enter.
The "10-4" Open is sponsored by NYCOM, the Communications Store,
and sanctioned by the Sports Car Club of America. Nycom is sweetening
the pot by offering prizes to winners and discounts on CB radios and
other communications equipment to all entrants.
If you would like to learn more about the sport attend a free rallying
seminar at the NYCOM store Tuesday, Dec. 7 or Thursday, Dec. 9 at
8:00 p.m.
The Communications Store
Call 948-6326 for more information
or to sign up for the rally or the seminar. SS?" "
