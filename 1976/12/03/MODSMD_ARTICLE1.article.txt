# Universities differ in releasing public salary data
## Interpretations of IRS regulations vary Task Force Report

Copyright 1976, The Stanford Daily
Stanford, because of its interpre
tation of Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) regulations, does not list
salaries of top university adminis
trators on an IRS form intended to
provide the public with informa
tion on tax-exempt institutions.
Of the nine other major institu
tions surveyed by the Daily Task
Force, five universities have a pol
icy similar to Stanford's, while four
universities list salaries of major
administrators.
The tax return, IRS Form 990, is
filed by most income-tax exempt
organizations. One part of the form,
Schedule A, asks that three
categories of information be pro
vided: compensation of officers, di
rectors, and trustees; compensation
of the five highest paid employes;
and the five highest paid persons
for professional services.
Differences among the univer
sities surveyed in the amount of
salary information provided stem
from the universities' differing in
terpretations of who are
"officers, directors, and trustees."
Duke University, USC and Col
umbia University have listed the
salaies of all top university ad

ministrators on recent IRS returns.
On the other hand, Stanford,
Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth. Prince
ton and Yale Universities did not
list the salaries of all of those ad
ministrators in the first part of
Schedule A on their 1974 IRS re
turns.
USC lists the administrators'
salaries because it believes it is re
quired to do so under federal law,
according to John Fleischer, a USC
tax accountant.
While declining to comment on
whether other universities should
disclose this information, Fleischer
said, "as far as we know we're re
quired to fill it out and we do so."
Even though Stanford has listed
the salaries of its five highest paid
employes, it does not list the ad
ministrators' salaries because the
university's interpretation is that
this is not required.
"We won't compound the injus
tice (of releasing salary data) by
volunteering further information,"
explained Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Rosenzweig.
Stanford gives two reasons for de-

This is the second article in a two-part Daily Task Force report dealing with public
salary and financial data from private West and East Coast universities.
The first part compared compensation of employes here and at other schools. The
second part explains why Stanford and many other universities keep private
certain information which other schools make public, and the difficulties tax
exempt universities face when grappling with Internal Revenue Service regula
tions.
The series was written by Task Force Coordinator Dan Fiduccia, based on
months of research by task force members.

termining that it is not required to
fill out the salaries of chief adminis
trators, according to Iris Brest, as
sociate staff legal counsel.
First, the university has no direc
tors, and its trustees are not com
pensated. Stanford's position is that
the word "officers" refers to those

persons with policy-making and di
rectoral powers, and since only the
trustees have policy-making pow
ers, Stanford interprets the word
"officers" as referring to officers of
the board of trustees. Trustee offic
ers also do not receive compensa
tion.

Stanford considers its adminis
trators, including the president and
vice presidents, as employes, not as
officers, and thus does not list them
on Schedule A. However, it would
have listed any administrator on the
IRS form if he or she had earned
more than the fifth highest com
pensated employe, according to
Brest and Rosenzweig.
Second, Stanford argues that an
Internal Revenue Code section,
6033(b)(6), requires the salary in
formation for managers of private
foundations to be listed in tliis sec
tion of Form 990. Since Stanford is
not a private foundation, it has no
private foundation managers and
thus considers itself exempt from
listing its administrators' salaries
separately from the salaries of the
five highest paid employes, said
Brest.
Form 990 instructions state that
tax-exempt "organizations (other
than private foundations filing
Form 990-PF) must also complete
separate Schedule A (Form 990)."
Stanford receives recommenda
tions from the National Association

of College and University Business
Officers (NACUBO) on how to pre
pare Form 990.
Abbott VVainwright, NACUBO
associate director of information,
said NACUBO has never encoun
tered any resistance from univer
sities on completing the Form 990
section (Schedula A, Part 1) in
which the salaries of "officers, di
rectors, and trustees" are listed.
"Most institutions don't mind fil
ling it out â€”it's seldom material."
said VVainwright.
NACUBO has never suggested
that institutions not fill out Part 1,
according to VVainwright.
A tax attorney whom NACUBO
consults said that Stanford might
succeed in not having to disclose
the Fart I information if it bases its
argument before the IRS on the In
ternal Revenue Code section which
it has cited, according to VVain
wright.
Before the Daily told NACUBO
that Stanford was not completing
the Part 1 information, NACUBO
was unaware that any university
was not completing that section.
"It's the first we've had know
ledge that anyone has not filled out

that section," said Wainwright.
NACUBO recommendations for
preparing Form 990 state that "of
ficers are those persons described
as such in the charter or bylaws."
The Stanford Board of Trustees
By-Laws include one article on of
ficers of the board and another arti
cle on officers of the university: the
president and five vice presidents.
Stanford, according to Brest, does
not interpret its trustee by-laws that
way in applying NACUBO's re
commendations.
"There is a distinction between
policy-makers and employes. The
board thinks it makes policy based
on the recommendations of
employes," said Brest.
When informed that Stanford in
terpreted the word "officers" to
mean officers of the Board of Trus
tees, Wainwright remarked, "quite
interesting."
Duke lists its administrators,
ranging from the university's pres
ident to secretary, because Duke's
by-laws state that they are officers
by position, according to Duke Con
troller J. Peyton Fuller.
Duke's policy is that the IRS did
net intend "officers" to mean offic
ers of its board of trustees.
"Our trustees are not officers,
they're trustees," said Fuller.
USC listed its officers separately
hom its five highest paid employes,
even though some of the officers
earned more than some of the five
highest paid employes.

Cornell's five highest paid
employes were all physicians. Of
ficers and professors were the five
highest compensated employes at
Dartmouth, Princeton, Brown. Col
umbia and Yale, according to the
Brown Daily Herald.
Columbia also listed the compen
sation of its officers separately from
the compensation of its employes;
the other Ivy League schools did
not, according to the Daily Herald.
Harvard's five highest paid
employes were all officers. Harvard
does not list its highest paid officers
separately from the five highest
paid employes because Harvard
considers all of its administrators,
deans, directors and managers as
officers. Thus, Harvard has
"thousands of officers," according
to a Harvard official.
"I can't see any employe making
more than the top officers of the
university," added the Harvard of
ficial.
On the cover to its supplemental
instructions booklet for Form 990,
the IRS states that if any part of the
form is not completed, "we may
consider the return incomplete and
contact you for the missing infor
mation. The statutory requirement
for filing Form 990 is not met by the
filing of an incomplete return. We,
therefore, urge you to make sure
your return is completed in full be
fore it is filed."
If Form 990 is not filed on time,
the institution can be fined up to
$5000.
However, because of the large
number of forms from tax-exempt

institutions the IRS generally does
not investigate them closely unless
someone complains about a
specific case, according to IRS
employes.
Universities and certain other
tax-exempt organizations were re
quired to begin filing Form 990 a
few years ago, following the pas
sage by Congress of the Tax Reform
Act of 1969.
Form 990 has, however, pre
sented problems for the institutions
which must complete it.
"It's a new form. The IRS is exp
laining what additionally (the in
stitutions) should do. Sometimes
disagreements are reconciled,
sometimes it's one or two years be
fore the disagreements are settled
with the schools and charities,"
explained Fleischer.
"There are all different ways to
construe anything put out by the
IRS," said the Harvard official.
The IRS tacitly acknowledges
these problems, since its supple
mental instructions booklet on
Form 990 states on the cover that
"this supplement is intended to as
sist you in preparing a complete
and accurate Form 990... we are
making this extra effort because
many returns in past years have not
been completed fully, depriving the
public of information that, under
the law, it is entitled to have."
