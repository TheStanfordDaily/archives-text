# Universities differ in releasing public salary data
## Interpretations of IRS regulations vary Task Force Report

Stanford, because of its interpre
tation of Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) regulations, does not list
salaries of top university adminis
trators on an IRS form intended to
provide the public with informa
tion on tax-exempt institutions.
Of the nine other major institu
tions surveyed by the Daily Task
Force, five universities have a pol
icy similar to Stanford's, while four
universities list salaries of major
administrators.
The tax return, IRS Form 990, is
filed by most income-tax exempt
organizations. One part of the form,
Schedule A, asks that three
categories of information be pro
vided: compensation of officers, di
rectors, and trustees; compensation
of the five highest paid employes;
and the five highest paid persons
for professional services.
Differences among the univer
sities surveyed in the amount of
salary information provided stem
from the universities' differing in
terpretations of who are
"officers, directors, and trustees."
Duke University, USC and Col
umbia University have listed the
salaies of all top university ad

ministrators on recent IRS returns.
On the other hand, Stanford,
Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth. Prince
ton and Yale Universities did not
list the salaries of all of those ad
ministrators in the first part of
Schedule A on their 1974 IRS re
turns.
USC lists the administrators'
salaries because it believes it is re
quired to do so under federal law,
according to John Fleischer, a USC
tax accountant.
While declining to comment on
whether other universities should
disclose this information, Fleischer
said, "as far as we know we're re
quired to fill it out and we do so."
Even though Stanford has listed
the salaries of its five highest paid
employes, it does not list the ad
ministrators' salaries because the
university's interpretation is that
this is not required.
"We won't compound the injus
tice (of releasing salary data) by
volunteering further information,"
explained Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Rosenzweig.
Stanford gives two reasons for de-

This is the second article in a two-part Daily Task Force report dealing with public
salary and financial data from private West and East Coast universities.
The first part compared compensation of employes here and at other schools. The
second part explains why Stanford and many other universities keep private
certain information which other schools make public, and the difficulties tax
exempt universities face when grappling with Internal Revenue Service regula
tions.
The series was written by Task Force Coordinator Dan Fiduccia, based on
months of research by task force members.

termining that it is not required to
fill out the salaries of chief adminis
trators, according to Iris Brest, as
sociate staff legal counsel.
First, the university has no direc
tors, and its trustees are not com
pensated. Stanford's position is that
the word "officers" refers to those

persons with policy-making and di
rectoral powers, and since only the
trustees have policy-making pow
ers, Stanford interprets the word
"officers" as referring to officers of
the board of trustees. Trustee offic
ers also do not receive compensa
tion.

Stanford considers its adminis
trators, including the president and
vice presidents, as employes, not as
officers, and thus does not list them
on Schedule A. However, it would
have listed any administrator on the
IRS form if he or she had earned
more than the fifth highest com
pensated employe, according to
Brest and Rosenzweig.
Second, Stanford argues that an
Internal Revenue Code section,
6033(b)(6), requires the salary in
formation for managers of private
foundations to be listed in tliis sec
tion of Form 990. Since Stanford is
not a private foundation, it has no
private foundation managers and
thus considers itself exempt from
listing its administrators' salaries
separately from the salaries of the
five highest paid employes, said
Brest.
Form 990 instructions state that
tax-exempt "organizations (other
than private foundations filing
Form 990-PF) must also complete
separate Schedule A (Form 990)."
Stanford receives recommenda
tions from the National Association

of College and University Business
Officers (NACUBO) on how to pre
pare Form 990.
Abbott VVainwright, NACUBO
associate director of information,
said NACUBO has never encoun
tered any resistance from univer
sities on completing the Form 990
section (Schedula A, Part 1) in
which the salaries of "officers, di
rectors, and trustees" are listed.
"Most institutions don't mind fil
ling it out â€”it's seldom material."
said VVainwright.
NACUBO has never suggested
that institutions not fill out Part 1,
according to VVainwright.
A tax attorney whom NACUBO
consults said that Stanford might
succeed in not having to disclose
the Fart I information if it bases its
argument before the IRS on the In
ternal Revenue Code section which
it has cited, according to VVain
wright.
Before the Daily told NACUBO
that Stanford was not completing
the Part 1 information, NACUBO
was unaware that any university
was not completing that section.
"It's the first we've had know
ledge that anyone has not filled out
