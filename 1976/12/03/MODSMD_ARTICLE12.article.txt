# Nuclear power still poses dangers
## 
### 
.Make no mistake about it . . ,
America is going nuclear. There are
now over 50 atomic power plants in
this country and scores more are on the
drawing board. At one point the metas
tasis of the nukes was challenged by
the nation's environmentally-minded
people, but that fight seems to have
been lost.
Only a few months ago the prospects
for making nuclear power safe, if not
rejecting it out of hand, appeared
good. However, June saw the defeat of
California's Nuclear Safety Initiative
— Prop. 15 — and the roof began to
cave in on the anti-nuclear movement
from that point on.
In the November election similar in
itiatives were defeated in six states:
Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Ohio,
Oregon and Washington. Each mea
sure sought to accomplish two objec
tives — to extend insurance in case of
accidents above the $560 million fed
eral limit and to establish stringent
safeguards in the maintenance and
construction of atomic plants.
Both sides
Undoubtedly, millions of Ameri
cans were exposed to both sides of the
nuclear debate. It is true that the en
vironmentalists' message emphasiz
ing the hazards posed by nuclear
wastes and the potential for accidents
was partially overcome by the heavy
media spending by utilities, which ar
gued that atom.c energy is the only
feasible alternative to foreign oil.
Yet, it is probably accurate to say,
especially after the wide loss margins
of the nuclear initiatives are consi
dered, that the voters really believed
that "clean, dependable" nuclear
energy is a viable alternative to "unre
liable and expensive" foreign oil and

"polluting" domestic coal.
What tasks remain, then, for the
people committed to insuring nuclear
safety? As long as the problems still
exist — and they do — it is the job of
the concerned citizen to inform his
community that the issue of safety per
sists, even if industry is bent on de-

veloping atomic power. And the first
task for such people is to point out the
inadequacy of the Price-Anderson Act.
Limits liability
Passed in 1957, at the beginning of
commercial nuclear power generation,
thebill limits the liability of utilities in
the event of accident to $560 million in
damages. At that time, insurance on
plants covering accidents was only
$60 million.
The bill was the product of an
Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)
study that estimated the number of
casualties in a core "burn-out" at 3500.
In light of recent findings, which re
vised disease incidencies up to
300,000 and resulting damages to $17
billion, the $560 million becomes piti
fully insufficient.
But even if Price-Anderson was to be
updated, the entire question of
whether nuclear devastation — with

compensation or without — can be tol
erated at all must still be explored.
Since atomic energy proponents con
sistently cite studies such as the fam
ous one conducted by Prof. Norman
Rausmussen of MIT, in attempting to
prove that nuclear power is safe, it is
worthwhile to examine the Rausmus
sen report in detail to determine the
validity of those claims.
2300 deaths
The paper estimates the maximum
loss of life from radiation leakage from
an atomic plant at 2300 deaths. How
ever, the report was deeply flawed, for
it only considered an accident caused
by malfunction in a power plant's in
ternal mechanisms. As Ralph Nader
pointed out, the Rausmussen report
failed to account for the possibility of
sabotage, transportation vehicle disas
ter or a natural catastrophe,an earth
quake.
' Even its limited base casualty is
suspect, because it only estimated the
number of people who. after an initial
explosion, would immediate "drop
dead." The long term effect on popula
tions downwind of radioactive mate
rial deposits, unsuspected cancer
deaths manifested some time after an
accident and the prospect of genetic
death were omitted from the study.
Waste disposal
Yet the report also avoided another
major aspect of nuclear safety: waste
disposal. By Rausmussen's own ad
mission, thousands of years must pass
before radioactive fuel products be
come as relatively innocuous as pitch
blende deposits. Again, the report
excludes mention of storage problems,
containment to prevent leakage into
the water table, or radioactive emis
sions. For despite all the talk, no per
manent storage facility for nuclear
waste exists in the world today.
But the discussion of nuclear safety
must also extend to plutonium, the
byproduct of uranium fission, before it
turns back into radioactive uranium
waste. For plutonium is extremely to
xic, and a potential nuclear bomb fuel.
Yet apallingly, the AEC can't currently

account tor one per cent of its
plutonium inventory.
Criticism
Needless to say. the Rausmussen re
port has been criticized by scientists at
MIT, the Environmental Protection
Agency and some AEC staff members
themselves.
So, despite the verdict at the polls —
based partially on such unconvincing
evidence — nuclear energy poses con
crete dangers. However. Americans
apparently are willing to assume the
risk of core melt-outs, waste leaks and
the like for they feel that atomic power
has a good track record and is the only
alternative this country has, at least
until solar power is feasible.
So many people place that last con
dition on their support for atomic
energy that the "until solar" argument
has perhaps become the most danger
ous obstacle to the development of
solar power itself.
Foresight
This paradox requires only foresight
to be readily understood. For once
America becomes dependent on nuc
learenergy noutility is going tovolun
tarily relinquish billion dollar invest
ments, solely for the reason that solar
energy has become feasible — say in 25
years. In fact, once on the road to nuc
lear dependency, research and in
vestment will be diverted away from
the "ultimate" energy source, sun
light.
Therefore, the environmentalist,
concerned student or solar proponent
need not only establish the potential
for destruction inherent in nuclear
power and the present inadequacy in
compensating victims of nuclear acci
dents, but he must also refute the ar
gument that, once fully embraced,
nuclear power can ever be a mere
"transitional" energy source.
Perhaps it will take a major disaster
before the anti-nuclear forces get their
second wind. One can only hope that
20th century man copes with the nuc
lear age and displays the ability to
learn in anticipation of experience.
