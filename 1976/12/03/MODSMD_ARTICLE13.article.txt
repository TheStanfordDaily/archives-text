# Fast not 'embarrassing failure'

Wayne Larocque

As a member of the Stanford Com
mittee on Hunger, I would like to re
spond to Ben Pollock and Noah
Vale's letter entitled "Consciousness
Raising" (Daily, Nov. 30).
Their doubt as to the effect of the
Stanford Day of Fasting (not "Food
Day") on the Stanford community is a
valid and disturbing concern — espe
cially when such a seemingly meager
effort is juxtaposed to, or directed at,
such an enormous problem. Yet there
is something ludicrous, if not outright
absurd, about calling it an "embarras
sing failure" because it did not raise
enough "consciousness."
The aim of the fast was not to solve
the world food problem, inculcate
Stanfordites with "knowledge," or
even demand that fasters not eat
elsewhere. Our pretensions don't
stretch that far. Rather, the goal of the
fast was to provide the opportunity for
many different people to come to

gether in many different ways around
what we, as a committee as well as
individuals, feel to be a serious world
problem demanding our urgent atten
tion.
The "embarrassing failure" of our
times, you see, is this sobering insanity
of incredible need amidst insatiable
gluttony. Or, to bring the analogy un
comfortably close, the "embarrassing
failure" is not action that may fall sljort

of a solution, but inaction.
Perhaps this letter can serve as an
invitation to Pollock and Vale (or
others who may feel similarly) to join
the hunger committee and attempt to
actualize their concerns and ideas. I
dare say that the Stanford community
could do with a little more practicing
of our preaching.
