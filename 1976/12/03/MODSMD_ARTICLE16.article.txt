# Letters: Western Civ, day of fasting
## 
### 
John Walsh's column on the West
ern Civilization rule (Daily, Nov. 29) is
characteristic of an attitude that has
been growing rapidly in the past few
years, not just at Stanford, but across
the nation. This is the idea that the
individual has the right to do what
he/she pleases, and that the advice of
others is worthless if it does not agree
with one's own means and ends.
No one wants to see Stanford turned
into a "glorified high school," nor
does anyone wish to be subject to more
academic restraints and requirements.
Hut the fact is that many students do
not think for themselves when it
comes to their academic program.
We know that the liberal art -dura
tion, despite its value, is losing
ground. We know that students are
more career-oriented than ever before,
and that their general education will
suffer for it. We know that professors
have valuable advice to offer, even if
we need not always follow it.
While I am not necessarily in favor
of the Western Civilization require
ment, I do believe that such pos
sibilities should not be dismissed with
a cry of "academic freedom now!" and
an airy wave of the hand. The prob
lems of balancing an education should
be worked out by agreement between
the teachers and students, not by hav
ing one group deciding what's good
for the other.

A lot to learn
In the wake of your editorial {Daily,
Nov. 24) on the subject, I feel it would
be foolhardy for me to venture an opin
ion on whether general education
courses should be made mandatory at
Stanford, other than to point out that,
at least in the case of architecture, High
Gothic seems somehow out of place in
California. Of course, this is a position
on which reasonable men may disag
ree, as are positions on educational
philosophy.
Nevertheless, while there may be
disagreement over the substance of the
argument, there can be no doubt that in
the matter of form, the Humanities Cir
cle has a lot to teach the writers of the
Daily's editorial reply. However ob
lique and lengthy the Humanity Cir
cle's manifesto, it is nonetheless
graced with an engaging humanistic
spirit and sense of rhetorical style
which make it stand in sharp contrast
to the strident and inept editorial of the
Daily.
A tew examples from the latter
should suffice. After stupidly calling
the conspicuously philosophical dis
quisition of the Humanities Circle a
diatribe," the Daily launches a diat
ribe of its own by labeling the circle's
members "disgruntled fuddy
duddies."
Having also called them "pomp
ous, it continues to flounder in irony
when it lectures them on the maturity
ot 18-year-olds and berates them for
their "petty self-interest." It concludes
with a witless curse, of which the less
said, the better.
The first question is, was it in any
one's obvious self-interest for the
Daily to plop down so uncharacteristi
cally on the side of the educational
status quo. i> (Hint: Honi suit qui mal y
pense!)
The second is, what does the quality
of the Daily's editorial style say about
the educational principles itendorses?

Still worthwhile
I must agree with Pollack and
Vale's letter (Daily, Nov. 30) that the
Day of Fasting was a "failure." How
ever, the effort was still worthwhile in
that it raised over $3500 and that, for at
least a few, it did provide reinforce
ment of their concerns. 1, for one,
learned a great deal being involved in
the hunger committee activities and in
Alliance for Radical Change activities.
Furthermore, the fast's marginal abil
ity to raise consciousness was not un
expected.
Nevertheless, I must agree that there
existed a very sobering anil depressing
note to the fast, the re
acknowledgement of how little the
majority of Stanford students care
about the people they're exploiting.
As far as I see it, the only difference
between the magnitude of U.S. in
volvement in the exploitation of
foreign peoples (militarily or econom
ically) is no different now than it was
eight years ago. 1 can onlv conclude
that America's youth can only
mobilize when its own welfare is at
stake.

Grandstanding
At Monday's ASSU Senate meeting,
Sen. Brad krevoy's resolution oppos
ing the reinstatement of a university
Western Civilization requirement was
attacked as "grandstand politics" by
theHammer and Coffin (Hand C) slate.
Hand C was in effect putting on a
grandstand show of its own. It was
their petty jealousies that caused them
to vote against krevoy rather than vot
ing on the merits of the resolution.
krevoy was doing the job any good
legislator should do. He saw an issue
that concerned the students, sought
out their sentiments on it, and prop
osed a resolution to voice that senti
ment. krevoy was merely representing

his constituency.
Hand C recognized the need for
such a resolution, but in defeating
krevcy's resolution, their true feelings
surlaced. Their jealousy of krevoy's
positive action was their only motive
in voting the way they did. They al
most failed in defeating the measure.
Pat Hall, Hand C member and senate
chairman, broke the 10-1U tie to defeat
the resolution.
It is a sad state of affairs when a few
senate members allow personal pre
judices to affect their voting. 1 only
wish that they were mature enough to
make an objective decision on their
own.

Bogus ad
Since 1 can't write to the Chaparral,
1 11 have to write to you persons con
cerning the bogus ad on page seven of
the Chappie's fall issue.
1 he alleged ad shows a group of ku
Mux klan members huddled
around a National Linen Service
bicentennial sheet and reads, "Com
memorating our Centennial. National
Linen Service 1876-1976." 1 would
like to get several things ironed out.
First of all, we are in no way af
filiated with the kkk. And second of
all. I have absolutely no idea how the
Chappie got ahold of one of our bicen
tennial sheets.
Lastly, but by no means leastly, 1 feel
the Chappie owes an apology to
Eugene O'National, founder of our
company and inventor of its miracle
starch with Phospho Fructo kinase
that makes Stanford sheets such a
dream to sleep and do other things on.
Actually, the Chappie doesn't have to
apologize to him. He's dead.
There. With that out of the way,
maybe those marines will stop poking
me with screwdrivers.
