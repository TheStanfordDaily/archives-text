With the election now over. Presi
dent Cerald Rudolph Ford no longer
needs to "act presidential"
and has been spending his time relax
ing in the White House. At the sugges
tion of his friend Bob Dole. Ford lias
been using much of this time doing
research on a favorite topic of his — the
Ford Revisionist Theory of U.S. His
tory.
As some of you may recall, the
Ford theory was first stated publicly
during the Dole-Mondale vice presi
dential debate. The theory holds that
the four major wars of this century —
World War 1, World War 11, korea and
Vietnam — were all Democratic wars
(With a capital'd').
The theory came to a culmination
yesterday afternoon with Ford declar
ing that the 1776 war with Britain (cal
led the War of Independence by some)
was in fact a Democratic war.
Following this announcement, the
president took an unprecedented step
in pardoning Queen Elizabeth and ab
solving England of all blame for that
Democratic war. In a statement re
miniscent of his pardon of Richard Ni
xon, Ford said, "I can say from the
bottom of my heart, the Queen of Eng
land is innocent and she is right."
Ford, in an effort to show that the
pardon was more than the usual
lame-duck presidential action, also
called for the return of the original 13
colonies to England by early next
month.
Ford denied that this was a politi
cal 1 v motivated decision meant to les-

sen the importance of Jimmy Carter's
victory over him Nov. 2.
Ron Nessen then answered ques
tions from reporters on this important
decision.
Nessen told members of the press
that Ford hit upon this idea early last
week while boarding the presidential
helicopter. Nessen said that the his
toric helicopter will he made available
to photographers for pictures as soon
as a tew surface dents are removed.
Nessen said that the research con
ducted to determine the innocence of
the queen was the most extensive of all
projects done by the Ford White House
and was personally directed by the
president.
On the advice of Henry Kissinger.
the2V2 page, double-spaced report was
classified "top-secret" due to fears that
some ol the material may be embarras
sing to our allies.
When askeil it it was true that the
queen ot England had appointed Ford
to serve as commonwealth director of
the colonies. Nessen had no comment.
In other news, the pound dropped to
a new low of $1.32 on the London
Market when it was learned that Eng
land would have to assume all of New
York City's debts.
In Plains, Ga. today, Jimmy Carter
responded to a question on Ford's de
cision to pardon the queen and return
the 13 colonies to England by stating
that he would not go to war to defend
Yugoslavia, and that the current un
employment is at an all-time high.
