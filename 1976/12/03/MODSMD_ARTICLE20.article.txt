# Even famous persons sniff laughing gas

(CPS) — Sir Winston Chur
chill dabbled in it as did inven
tor James Watt and wordsmith
Peter Roget, the fellow
who assembled the famous
thesaurus. Theodore Drieser
wrote a one-act play about it; just
one whiff gave me"more unming
led pleasure than I had ever be
fore experienced," gushed poet
Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Simi
larly, poet Robert Southey was
equally impressed: "The atmos
phere of all the possible heavens
must be compressed in this gas,"
he wrote, speaking of the same

substances other writers have
dubbed "the air of paradise."
What's the compound all
these people consider such a
gas? It's nitrous oxide — N2O —
aka "laughing gas," the same
weird stuff the dentist makes
you suck in so he can fool around
in your mouth and you won't
feel any pain. Today, it's the
most commonly used anesthetic
in surgery, according to a book
that tells all about nitrous oxide,
Laughing Gas (Shedlin, Wal
lechinsky eds., And/Or Press,
Berkeley, Calif.).

Of course, laughing gas has
other uses besides its medicinal
ones. For 20 decades people
have been allowing the harmless
and abundant substance to seep
up their nasal passages to tweak
their brains and provoke some of
the spiffiest surrealistic dreams
ever conjured up by otherwise
normal minds of the human per
suasion.
Laughing gas is back in vogue
today. Actually, it's never been
out of vogue since famous inven
tor Joseph Priestly discovered
the simple compound in 1772.
Its use has ebbed and flowed
over the centuries, but Deople
never really stopped using it as
long as there were labs around to
churn it out.
Renaissance in sixties
Laughing gas enjoyed a re
naissance during the pys
chedelic '60s which experts feel
has probably tapered off, but
many young people in every sec
tion of the nation are snorting
gas today. "Yes, it's definitely
being done all over the country
today," says a drug researcher at
a federal agency in Washington,
D.C., "It's fairly easily available
all over," echoes Vic Pawluk of
the Do It Now Foundation, a
drug research center in Phoenix.
"It seems to come and go in
communities on a fad basis. A lot
of people in Ohio are doing it
lately, " Pawluk adds.
Perhaps the nation's leading
group of laughing gas af
ficionados is the East Bay Chem
ical Philosophy Symposium
(EBCPS), a self-described anar
chistic cabal from the San Fran
cisco area who reckon they've
sniffed over 500,000 quarts of
the stuff. It was members of
EBSPS who collaborated on
Laughing Gas as well as on a
movie entitled Gas which they
say can only be appreciated by
an audience that is breathing
laughing gas at the same time as
the people in the film.
In writing Gas the authors in
terviewed chief anes
thesiologists at several large
California hospitals, sifted

through mounds of research and
checked out the entire 200 year
medical history of the gas. They
also inhaled massive doses of the
gas itself.
Do it
The author's main message is
unmistakably: "Do It," to give
laughing gas a whirl since it's a
safe and, as they put it, "ineffa
ble, irrational, too strange and
marvelous to be comprehended
or remembered."
The book, which is chocked
full of hilarious illustrations, de
tails the colorful history of gas,
how its use spread across the sea
from England's Pneumatic Insti
tute (where scientists studied
the therapeutic use of gases) to
America, where it became a form
of public entertainment as so
called 'itinerant chemists" rol
led across the continent giving
lectures and demonstrations in
traveling road shows.
One of the itinerants disco
vered the pain killing properties
of laughing gas when one of his
gas-filled subjects danced across
the stage, smashed his shin, but
failed to notice the hurt. By 1869,

dentists using the gas had
yanked 75,000 teeth.
Easy to obtain
Today, nitrous oxide is fairly
easy to obtain. In addition to its
widespread medical uses, the
gas has many industrial applica
tions such as food refrigeration
processing. One of the best
methods of snorting gas is to buy
a four-foot cylinder containing
2500 air gallons and using it to
pump up balloons. That way,
people at a party can take long
individual tokes as the balloon is
passed around the room like a
joint. A laughing gas buzz lasts
two or three intense moments.
Although laughing gas has
been proven harmless there is
still one deadly danger that ac
companies its use — suffocation.
That occurs when users clamp a
sniffing mask of some sort over
their faces and cut off their oxy
gen intake. It happened recently
to the son of a U.S. dentist who
strapped on his father's office
gas mask but suffocated when he
forgot about the oxygen. His
limp body was found in his dad's
dental chair.
