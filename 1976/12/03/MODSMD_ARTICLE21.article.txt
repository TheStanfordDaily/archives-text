### Dean Eyre 
The Cay People's Union (GPU) continues to try to obtain a loan or
scholarship for gay students although the university said earlier
this quarter that it would not receive or administer loans if they
were designated on the basis of sexual orientation.
The GPU has been urging the university to accept a fund for gay
students since January 1975. .
In an Oct. 14 memorandum, Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
explained that the proposed funding was rejected because "sexual
orientation is a private matter and should not be used by the
university as the basis for either extending or denying to students
the services and benefits of the university."
Lyons emphasized that the university's policy in considering
funding has been to avoid restrictive or non-need-based scholar
ships.
"In recent times, the university has discouraged scholarship gifts
which were fully or even partially restrictive, or which did not
further some established educational objective of the university,"
Lyons said.
i "Even now, there are some scholarships where educational fac
tors are considered, but only secondarily. Financial need remains
as the primary criterion for the award of financial aid," he added.
GPU Community Relations Coordinator Richard Thomas re
sponded to Lyons' memo by questioning past and present funding
policies in specified areas.
In reply to Lyons' statement that the university would be intro
ducing a new test (sexual orientation) for access to a student be
nefit, Thomas asked whether "the university accepted funds in the
last five years which, although awarded on the basis of financial
need, give preference to students ..." for specific interests, sex,
"ethnic, racial or religious backgrounds?"
Thomas said he was interested in discovering how funding
policies affect such organizations as the Hi 1 lei foundation and the
Navajo Tribal Council.
