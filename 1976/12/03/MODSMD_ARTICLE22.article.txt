# Hightail homeward via bus, train, car or plane

### 
(CPS) —"Hello,mom. . .could
you send me a couple of more
bucks to get home?" The mid
year vacation break is here again.
Students are heading into the
final stretch of this part of the
academic year. Racing through
libraries, researching those pap
ers due in October, copying
notes missed by cutting classes
and cracking the books for final
exams. All this with one major
thought in mind — getting out
and on the road home to old
friends and decent meals.
For the less affluent, thorough
scourings of the ride-boards on
campus will be the first order of
business. Those with a car look
ing for a few quick bucks to sup
plement gas and tolls will be
posting the notices wanting
extra riders. Few breaks can be

seen for students seeking other
modes of transportation.
Taking to the air lanes will
only be slightly cheaper if stu
dents take advantage of the
Bicentennial fare being offered
by all airlines. This involves a
booking and ticket pick-up 14
days before departure. The only
catch is that you have to wait
seven days before returning to
the original point. But seats are
going fast, according to a TWA
reservationist. He says volume is
heavy, especially for those com
ing into the west seeking the ski
slopes. The agent also noted
everyone can expect an airfare
increase come Jan. 15.
Those with a little gambling
blood can try Eastern Airlines for
what could turn out to be a free
trip. Eastern bets that they can
book you on any flight due to the
odds of cancellation. If the plane
is filled, they will put you on the
next available flight free of
charge. Ask for the Leisure Class
Service runs.
If you've got time to kill and
can't stand the cramped quarters
of a bus, AMTRAK offers a bit
more comfort, room to move
about and bar cars. Whether
you're on the Broadway Limited,
chugging between New York
and Chicago or the Southwest
Limited cruising from Los
Angeles into Albuquerque and
beyond, your only worry is how
to find your way home from the
station.
Art Lloyd of the AMTRAK of
fice in San Francisco said that
the volume of passengers has
begun to pick up "dramatically"
for the holiday season, with stu
dents making up a significant
portion of the traffic. Lloyd
noted that the east and west
coasts were experiencing the
heaviest student travelers. Rid
ing the rails cost on the average
of six cents a mile but if someone
has a few weeks to shift about the
countryside, AMTRAK offers its
USA Rail Pass, a bargain plan to
which ticket prices are geared to
the number of days on the train.
If time is precious and you still

can't afford the plane there is al
ways the major bus companies,
uncomfortable as they may be on
long trips. They do stop at more
cities and towns than a train or
airline and prices are compara
ble to or less than regular train
fares.
Still, there are those with that
adventurous spirit who wish to
pilot their own way home. Cars
will be turning out on the high
ways as early as possible to beat
the traffic jams they never miss
anyway. Students who want to
avoid the ride-board scene can
try a local drive-away courier or,
if they can prove who they are
with a ton of 1.D., try for a rent
a-car.
The auto-transports are report -
ing heavy requests but these
drive-away cars are often dif
ficult to catch. Moreover, auto
transport companies always
check for a record. Rental car
agencies require a major credit
card as well as a decent bank ac
count.
Hitchhiking is usually the last
resort for students lacking other
resources. Most authorities ad
vise against this practice, espe
cially for females. But if this is
the track you chose to run on,
contact the state police for
hitchhiking laws.

Taking to the air lanes will

Those with a little gambling
blood can try Eastern Airlines for
what could turn out to be a free

If you've got time to kill and
can't stand the cramped quarters
of a bus, AMTRAK offers a bit
more comfort, room to move
about and bar cars. Whether

to find your way home from the

Art Lloyd of the AMTRAK of

the volume of passengers has
begun to pick up "dramatically"
for the holiday season, with stu
dents making up a significant
portion of the traffic. Lloyd
noted that the east and west
coasts were experiencing the
heaviest student travelers. Rid
ing the rails cost on the average
of six cents a mile but if someone
has a few weeks to shift about the
countryside, AMTRAK offers its
USA Rail Pass, a bargain plan to
which ticket prices are geared to
the number of days on the train.
If time is precious and you still

can't afford the plane there is al
ways the major bus companies,
uncomfortable as they may be on

cities and towns than a train or

fares.
Still, there are those with that
adventurous spirit who wish to
pilot their own way home. Cars
will be turning out on the high
ways as early as possible to beat
the traffic jams they never miss
anyway. Students who want to
avoid the ride-board scene can
try a local drive-away courier or,
if they can prove who they are

The auto-transports are report -

drive-away cars are often dif
