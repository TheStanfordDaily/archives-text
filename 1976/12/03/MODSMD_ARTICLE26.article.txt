# Rommel: 'Desert fox' or dirty rat?
## 
### 
Bonn, West Germany (AP) — A new biog
raphy of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel
claims Nazi Germany's "Desert Fox"
brutalized his troops and blamed subordi
nates for his own tactical blunders in the
1941-43 North African campaign.
The book, Rommel's War in Africa, also
claims his involvement in a 1944 plot to kill
Hitler was not based on ethical motives but
instead on a desire to install more efficient
Third Reich leadershiptocontinuethe war.
Author vVolf Heckmann says Rommel's
reputation as a master of desert tank warfare
and highly principled troop commander
was largely a product of Nazi propaganda
and praise from British Field Marshal Ber
nard Montgomery, his chief opponent in
North Africa.
The West German journalist said that be
cause Rommel was Hitler's "darling," he
could not be effectively challenged by other
German generals who recognized his tacti

cal failures and character flaws.
After studying neglected archive material
and interviewing desert war veterans in
Germany, England and Australia, Heckman
says, Rommel's "larger than life monument
shrank to human proportions."
'Super human' demands
While veterans of Rommel's Afrika Korps
agreed unanimously in interviews that
Rommel did not demand more from them
than of himself, "What he demanded was
superhuman," Heckmann concludes.
Heckman claims Rommel's postwar biog
raphers suppressed unfavorable comments
from captured German officers and Allied
generals. He quotes Gen. Claude Auchin
leck's order to British commanders to use
"all available means" to counter troops'
opinions that Rommel was "more than an
ordinary German general, and a very un
pleasant one at that, as we know from his
own officers."

The passage, Heckmann says, was delib
erately omitted from standard" British biog
raphies on Rommel because such criticism
clashed with the thesis that Rommel was an
admirable officer.
Hatred, envy
Franz Haider, chief of Hitler's general
staff, followed_Rommel's North African
campaign with hatred and envy, basing his
criticisms largely on secondhand informa
tion.
Haider wrote in his diary: "Rommel's
faults of character make him a particularly
unwelcome phenomenon, whom nobody
wants to lock horns with because of his
brutal methods and because of the support
he enjoys from the highest" — a reference to
Hitler who, at that stage, admired Rommel
as "an unbelievably hard man."
Haider also criticizes Rommel's uncon
ventional operating methods and lack of re
spect for military traditions.

While veterans of Rommel's Afrika Korps
agreed unanimously in interviews that
Rommel did not demand more from them
than of himself, "What he demanded was
superhuman," Heckmann concludes.
Heckman claims Rommel's postwar biog
raphers suppressed unfavorable comments
from captured German officers and Allied
generals. He quotes Gen. Claude Auchin
leck's order to British commanders to use
"all available means" to counter troops'
opinions that Rommel was "more than an
ordinary German general, and a very un
pleasant one at that, as we know from his
own officers."

The passage, Heckmann says, was delib
erately omitted from standard" British biog
raphies on Rommel because such criticism
clashed with the thesis that Rommel was an
admirable officer.
Hatred, envy
Franz Haider, chief of Hitler's general
staff, followed_Rommel's North African
campaign with hatred and envy, basing his
criticisms largely on secondhand informa
tion.
Haider wrote in his diary: "Rommel's
faults of character make him a particularly
unwelcome phenomenon, whom nobody
wants to lock horns with because of his
brutal methods and because of the support
he enjoys from the highest" — a reference to
Hitler who, at that stage, admired Rommel
as "an unbelievably hard man."
Haider also criticizes Rommel's uncon
ventional operating methods and lack of re
spect for military traditions.
Bonn, West Germany (AP) — A new biog
raphy of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel
claims Nazi Germany's "Desert Fox"
brutalized his troops and blamed subordi
nates for his own tactical blunders in the
1941-43 North African campaign.
The book, Rommel's War in Africa, also
claims his involvement in a 1944 plot to kill
Hitler was not based on ethical motives but
instead on a desire to install more efficient
Third Reich leadershiptocontinuethe war.
Author vVolf Heckmann says Rommel's
reputation as a master of desert tank warfare
and highly principled troop commander
was largely a product of Nazi propaganda
and praise from British Field Marshal Ber
nard Montgomery, his chief opponent in
North Africa.
The West German journalist said that be
cause Rommel was Hitler's "darling," he
could not be effectively challenged by other
German generals who recognized his tacti

cal failures and character flaws.
After studying neglected archive material
and interviewing desert war veterans in
Germany, England and Australia, Heckman
says, Rommel's "larger than life monument
shrank to human proportions."
