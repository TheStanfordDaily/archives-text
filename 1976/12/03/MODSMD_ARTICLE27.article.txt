# Little change seen in foreign policy
## 
### Cynthia Neil 
American foreign policy
under President-elect Jimmy
Carter will probably be little dif
ferent from that under Gerald
Ford, three professors predicted
before a law school audience
Wednesday night.
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
David Abernathy addressed
himself to our relations with the
"fourth world." He defined
fourth world countries as those
countries who are poor and have
few resources. In 1972, he said,
there were 46 of these countries
with under $200 per capita an
nual income.
"Just as an example of the
gross inequity in the world, look
at the total budget of Niger. It is
$46 million, half the budget of
Stanford University," Aber
nathy said.
Most of the world's poverty is
centered in rural areas, said
Abernethy, and in most of the
poorer countries income in
equalities are high. He suggested
two ways to deal with the prob
lem of world poverty.
"First of all, we have a moral

obligation to the poorer count
ries of the world," he said. "We
must think in terms of redis
tributive justice. The poor
people of the world have a right
to live better.
"Secondly, we have an
economic self-interest in allev
iating world poverty. We
should state that openly and
should not be hypocritical about
it,"he added.
Abernathy predicted that
changes in U.S. foreign policy
under the new Carter administ
ration would be slight.
"Carter has a very thin man
date and we operate under a con
servative bureaucracy," Aber
nethy said. "These two condi
tions are not conducive to radi
cal change."
Abernethy stated that Ameri
can aid to the third and fourth
world should be conditioned
upon desired rural development
policies. That is to say, wealth
must be redistributed within the
country.
Assoc. History Prof. Barton
Bernstein spoke of the immense
deficit incurred by third world

countries. In the past two years
that deficit has been $30 billion
per annum and they have a total
deficit of $150 billion, he said.
Because of this deficit, third
world countries must accept ad
ditional political intervention,
according to Bernstein. However,
the developed nations, because
of limits of maneuvering, ideol
ogy, and power, will be unwil
ling to interfere in the third
world, to aid them in their strug
gle to rise out of poverty, Berns
tein said.
"These are not problems of
lack of intelligence, but lack of
will," Berstein added.
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Robert Keohane predicted a nar
row range of change.
"First consideration is the
U.S. political-military system,"
he said. In the area of human
rights, Ford has done nothing at
best. Our strategy has been to
support our friends by selling
them arms if they can pay and
give them away if not.
"Our policy has been not to
worry about international
human rights and I will be very
surprised and pleased if things
are any different under Carter. I

do hope he cuts back on arms
sales," Keohane said.
Keohane did find one major
reason for discontinuity of
change. "Political-economic
crises are affecting countries
such as Britain and Italy whose
strong economic growth has
been declining," Keohane con
cluded. "However, if there is no
grand world crisis 1 predict con
tinuity in the Carter administra
tion."
The final speaker of the even
ing, Postdoctoral Fellow Alan
Piatt, had a totally different pre
diction for the new Carter ad
ministration. Piatt is a former
legislative assistant to Sen. Ed
mund Muskie (D-Me.).
I'm not really an academic,"
he said. "I see not the Second
Coming, but some short run
positive changes in the Carter
administration.
"Carter pledged that he would
bring a new generation to
Washington. The transition
team has been made up of many
people in their twenties and thir
ties whose ideologies have been
shaped by the Vietnam experi
ence. Carter will also bring many
women and blacks into his ad
ministration," he said.

ling to interfere in the third
world, to aid them in their strug
gle to rise out of poverty, Berns
tein said.
"These are not problems of
lack of intelligence, but lack of
will," Berstein added.
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Robert Keohane predicted a nar
row range of change.
"First consideration is the
U.S. political-military system,"
he said. In the area of human
rights, Ford has done nothing at
best. Our strategy has been to
support our friends by selling
them arms if they can pay and
give them away if not.
"Our policy has been not to
worry about international
human rights and I will be very
surprised and pleased if things
are any different under Carter. I

do hope he cuts back on arms
sales," Keohane said.
Keohane did find one major
reason for discontinuity of
change. "Political-economic
crises are affecting countries
such as Britain and Italy whose
strong economic growth has
been declining," Keohane con
cluded. "However, if there is no
grand world crisis 1 predict con
tinuity in the Carter administra
tion."
The final speaker of the even
ing, Postdoctoral Fellow Alan
Piatt, had a totally different pre
diction for the new Carter ad
ministration. Piatt is a former
legislative assistant to Sen. Ed
mund Muskie (D-Me.).
I'm not really an academic,"
he said. "I see not the Second
Coming, but some short run
positive changes in the Carter
administration.
"Carter pledged that he would
bring a new generation to
Washington. The transition
team has been made up of many
people in their twenties and thir
ties whose ideologies have been
shaped by the Vietnam experi
ence. Carter will also bring many
women and blacks into his ad
ministration," he said.
American foreign policy
under President-elect Jimmy
Carter will probably be little dif
ferent from that under Gerald
Ford, three professors predicted
before a law school audience
Wednesday night.
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
David Abernathy addressed
himself to our relations with the
"fourth world." He defined
fourth world countries as those
countries who are poor and have
few resources. In 1972, he said,
there were 46 of these countries
with under $200 per capita an
nual income.
"Just as an example of the
gross inequity in the world, look
at the total budget of Niger. It is
$46 million, half the budget of
Stanford University," Aber
nathy said.
Most of the world's poverty is
centered in rural areas, said
Abernethy, and in most of the
poorer countries income in
equalities are high. He suggested
two ways to deal with the prob
lem of world poverty.
"First of all, we have a moral

obligation to the poorer count
ries of the world," he said. "We
must think in terms of redis
tributive justice. The poor
people of the world have a right
to live better.
"Secondly, we have an
economic self-interest in allev
iating world poverty. We
should state that openly and
should not be hypocritical about
it,"he added.
Abernathy predicted that
changes in U.S. foreign policy
under the new Carter administ
ration would be slight.
"Carter has a very thin man
date and we operate under a con
servative bureaucracy," Aber
nethy said. "These two condi
tions are not conducive to radi
cal change."
Abernethy stated that Ameri
can aid to the third and fourth
world should be conditioned
upon desired rural development
policies. That is to say, wealth
must be redistributed within the
country.
Assoc. History Prof. Barton
Bernstein spoke of the immense
deficit incurred by third world

countries. In the past two years
that deficit has been $30 billion
per annum and they have a total
deficit of $150 billion, he said.
Because of this deficit, third
world countries must accept ad
ditional political intervention,
according to Bernstein. However,
the developed nations, because
of limits of maneuvering, ideol
ogy, and power, will be unwil
ling to interfere in the third
world, to aid them in their strug
