# Squaw to be training site?

### 
Sacramento (AP) — Squaw
Valley, once a Winter Olympic
site, could become the nation's
first training center for all
Olympic sports, a top sports offi
cial says.
The Sierra resort is the only
site "under active considera
tion," said Don Miller, executive
director of the U.S. Olympic
Committee.
He said a decision is expected
by Dec. 15. The subject is on the
USOC executive committee's

agenda this weekend in New
York.
Miller's remarks were in
Wednesday's Sacramento Bee.
"We want a year-round train
ing center for all sports on the
Olympic program," Miller said.
Squaw Valley, near Lake
Tahoe, was the site on the 1960
Winter Olympics. Its ownership,
both private and public, has
been beset with financial trou
bles in the past.
When the California Legisla
ture voted funds for the 1960

games, it made provisions for
keeping the property as a per
manent winter sports center. But
the state later sold the property
after disputes over its manage
ment and purchase of private
property for a state park.
The Olympic training center
would be funded by about
$500,000 a year in gifts from bus
iness and the public, Miller said.
He said federal government
support is a possibility next year,
but the USOC isn't counting on
it.
The budget would include
support from airlines and food
companies, and the USOC is try
ing to settle the details before a
final decision, Miller said.
Mainline Corp. of America,
owner of Squaw Valley Olympic
Village hotel and other ski resort
base area properties, initiated
the training center plan.
"We want to find some use for
the Olympic Village hotel that
makes some sense," said Bud
Ogden, a Mainline executive.
