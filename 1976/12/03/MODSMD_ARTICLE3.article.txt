Washington (AP) —The outgoing Pentagon leadership
handed President-elect Jimmy Carter a major problem
yesterday by awarding contracts to start production of the
Bl bomber, costliest in history.
After becoming president Jan. 20, Carter will have to
decide whether to let that decision stand or reverse it.
During the campaign, he said he would not build the 81.
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced tin?
go ahead decision after consulting President Gerald Ford.
The move came as no surprise because Ford said last April
"we must build the Bl bomber and we're going to."
Rumsfeld and Air Force Secretary Thomas Reed
claimed it is imperative that the Bl be produced to help
offset growing Soviet strength in strategic nuclear

weapons.
"It would be irresponsible not to initiate Bl production
at this time," Reed told a news conference.
The Pentagon awarded in contracts to produce the first
three Bis, an option to build eight more, and to tool up for
full production. The contracts went to Rockwell Interna
tional Corp., which makes the plane itself; General Elec
tric Co. for the engines and the Boeing Co. for electronic
equipment.
If the Air Force gets its wish and builds a total of 244 Bis
to replace aging 852 bombers, it would cost the Treasury
$22.9 billion over the next 10 years or so. or an average of
$93 million a plane.
