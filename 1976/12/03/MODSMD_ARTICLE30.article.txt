# Homeopathy explores new medical horizons

"Holistic medicine has en
joyed a tremendous vogue here
on the Peninsula for the past
several years," observed Alison
Kennedy, who has witnessed
developments in the field since
1968.
As house manager of Ortega
Park Teachers' Laboratory, a di
vision of Portola Institute, pub
lishers of The Whole Earth
Cutulog, she was intimately in
volved in the social/educational
ferment of the late '60s.
"Alternative medicine, posi
tive though its influence has
')een, has left many people feel
ing inadequate to deal with the
vast majority of disease today:
cronic, functional, degenerative,
sypchosomatic and iatrogenic
(drug induced)," she contended.
"Characteristically, the
neophyte alternative healer
evolves through nutrition and
herbalism until he arrives at
homoeopathy, a model of scien
tific rigor combined with a sen
sitivity to the unique vital ex

pression of each patient," she
said.
"Homeopathy perhaps most
fully exemplifies the paradigm
of holistic medicine, which
seeks to treat the person as a
whole, to see him as more than a
collection of discrete organs, tis
sues and cells, but rather as a
unique being existing on a mul
tiplicity of levels — physical,
emotional, mental and spiritual
— which can be approached
therapeutically on any one of
these levels," she said.
"All of these approaches
should be within the armamen
tarium of the ordinary prac
titioner, with the appropriate
therapy being dictated first by
the level to which the pathology
has progressed and secondly thu
functional vibrational level of
the patient," she continued.
"Homeopathy offers a highly
individualized therapeutic sys
tem effecting a radical cure
rather than a symptomatic palli
ation, and is based on the Hip
pocratic law of similars which

states that disease is cured by
remedies that produce in a heal
thy person a symptom complex
silimar to that of the patient, the
remedies usually being adminis
tered in increasingly minute or
rarified doses, known as 'poten
cies,' " she said.
"Homeopathy represents the
distillation and synthesis of the
best ideas in Western, Ayurvedic
and Taoist medicine. It allows
the practitioner to effectively
grapple with problems he
couldn't touch within the
infectious/viral model of disease
or through the inchoate mass of
herbal literature," she said.
At a recent conference on
holistic medicine held in Cub
berley Auditorium and spon
sored by the Medical Student
Association of Stanford Univer
sity, Bill Gray, a graduate of the
Medical School and now in pri
vate practice in Mill Valley in
homeopathy and nutrition, cited
a number of apparently miracul
ous homeopathic cures.
Includes among these cases

were cure of a 13-year-old girl
with severely debilitating
rheumatoid arthritis with one
highly-dilute dose of poison oak
essense and the successful
treatment of a woman with ad
vanced breast cancer with a
similarly dilute dose of tarantula
venom.
Gray also outlined the basic
principles of homeopathy,
which he said begin with the
idea that the body, as well as the
emotions and intellect, are con
stantly working to "establish

homeostatis" or internal stabil
ity. "Healing forces try to cor
rect" whatever is wrong, he said.
"We should do nothing to inter
fere with this."
Gray also stressed the impor
tance of nutrition in natural he
aling, saying that it "provides
the soil" for healing to take
place.
Gray said that both he and
many other practitioners of
natural healing techniques came
to their belief in these systems
"through personal growth rather

than professional growth." He
cited the Esalen Institute of Big
Sur as one source of such per
sonal growth.
He said that traditional
medicine tends to dehumanize
both patients and doctors. The
heavy emphasis on the physi
cian's "competence," said Gray,
"gets him away from his own
humanity." He contrasted this
with the practice of natural
medicine where the physician
and the patient "work together
to solve the problem."

dray concluded by citing what
he saw as a trend to "move away
from simple, materialistic, li
mited" explanations of disease
and prescriptions for treatment
toward an understanding "that
there are non-toxic approaches,
remedies, to healing."
"It makes sense to try that
first," he said, adding that it may
eventually be possible "to use
the non-toxic methods and not
even resort to standard
medicine."
