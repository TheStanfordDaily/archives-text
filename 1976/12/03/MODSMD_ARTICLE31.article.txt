# Tooth decay remover found
## 
### 
Boston (AP) â€” Doctors at
Tufts Dental School say they
have successfully tested a chem
ical spray that removes decayed
tooth material with little drilling
and almost no pain.
The new method requires no
anesthesia for even the biggest
cavities, they say, and it virtually
eliminates the grinding pain of
traditional dental work.
The doctors have developed a
chemical called GK-101
N-Monochloroglycine and a

hand-held needle that squirts
the GK-101 onto the cavity.
Within minutes, decayed mate
rial breaks up and flakes away.
The method, under develop
ment for five years, was tried on
49 patients who had 61 teeth
with cavities. The chemical re
moved decayed material in 58 of
the teeth. In two other teeth, the
decayed area was nearly all re
moved, and in one it was par
tially removed, the doctors re
port.

The technique was developed
and tested by two Tufts dentists,
Melvin Goldman and Joseph H.
Kronman. A report on their find
ings was published in the cur
rent issue of the Journal of the
American Dental Association.
The doctors said drilling is
sometimes necessary to expose
the cavity enough for the chemi
cal to work. After the decay is
flushed out, doctors have to drill
a little more to shape the hole.
Then it is filled the same way
ordinary tooth repairs are made.
Even though the method re
quires some drilling, it has sev
eral advantages over current de
ntal practices, the doctors say.
"The heat and pressure that a
drill produces would be
minimized," Kronmansaid inan
interview. "It also removes only
the decay. Since a drill removes
everything it touches, this is a
more conservative approach."
For 77 per cent of the cavities
treated, the patients felt no pain,
the doctors said. If there was
pain, patients always described
it as slight.
The method will require more
testing and approval by the Food
and Drug Administration before
it is available to other dentists.
This will take "a matter of
years," Kronman said.
