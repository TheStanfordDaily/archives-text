# Students still spending

((IPS) â€” College costs may be soaring, the economy may be
lurching and daddy's wallet may be harder to crack these days, but
college students are buying more things than ever, a recent Rand
Youth Poll reports.
Cars, stereos, typewriters, televisions, calculators, cameras and
toiletries are the hot items, according to the Rand Poll. Cars, it
appears, are positively sizzling. Two out of five U.S. students now
own cars, the poll pointed out, with 50 per cent of the autos bought
new. Ten years ago, only three out of ten students tooled around the
nation s campuses in their own cars and that was at a time when
cars were less expensive to own and college was much cheaper.
Today the average cost for a year at college ranges from $5500 to
$7000 for private schools, $2000 to $3500 for public institutions.
How can students afford all the goodies on top of this staggering
tuition? Lester Rand, Rand Poll president, feels it is a combination
of factors. Students are working and earning more than ever, there
are family contributions and parents are making sacrifices for their
kids. Nevertheless, Rand finds this fiscal balancing act quite nifty.
Young men and women are displaying considerable ingenuity in
accomplishing this paradoxical economic feat," he says.
