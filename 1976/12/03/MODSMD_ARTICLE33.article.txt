Israel should begin negotia
tions with the Palestinian Liber
ation Organization leading to an
independent Palestinian state,
declared David Shaham, Israeli
journalist and critic, on Wed
nesday.
Shaham, founder of the Israeli
Labour Party newspaper and
eidtor of the English-language
New Outlook magazine, spoke at
the Bechtel International Center
(I-center), Florence Moore, and
the Meyer Library Forum room.
Shaham suggested that the al
ternative to negotiations and the

settlement of the Palestinian
problem "would be a continua
tion of the confrontation . . . de
terioration of economic condi
tions in Israel," and greater
likelihood of war.
"Even the Palestinian Libera
tion Organization and the Arab
Confrontation states (the most
militant of the Arab states —
Syria, Libya, and Iraq) agree
there is nothing to be gained by
continuing the confrontation,"
he said.
"I am ready to proceed from
the assumption that the Arab
world is ready to destroy Israel,

if it could. But when Arab lead
ers, like Sadat, talk about the de
struction of Israel, they speak of
it as an event beyond their
lifetimes: they recognize that the
present confrontation is practi
cally futile." Shaham added.
Shaham argued that a viable
solution to the Middle East con
flict must be based on several
basic principles: first, "the univ
ersal recognition of the right of
self-determination lor all
peoples." This principle would
mean in practice, he said, "the
recognition that both Israelis

and Palestinians have a right to a
seperate states."
The Palestinian state, inde
pendent of the (ordanian King
dom, should be established on
the West Bank of the Jordan
River and the Gaza strip on the
Mediterranean coast, he
suggested. Israel, within the
context of a final peace agree
ment, should be prepared to
withdraw from almost all oc
cupied territories seized after the
1967 war.
Jerusalem, "which should be
the last item on the agenda of any
peace conference," will require
a more complicated solution, be
noted. Shaham rejected the in
ternationalization of the city:
"Internationalization of
Jerusalem is rejected by both the
Arab and Jewish communities.
Why should a proposal be
adopted which is unsatisfactory
to the residents of the city?
Perhaps Jerusalem should be
come an independent munici
pality with self-governing
Jewish and Arab neighborhoods.
The city can serve as a capital for
both Israel and a Palestinian
state," he said.

self-determination lor all
peoples." This principle would
mean in practice, he said, "the
recognition that both Israelis

and Palestinians have a right to a
seperate states."
The Palestinian state, inde
pendent of the (ordanian King
dom, should be established on
the West Bank of the Jordan
River and the Gaza strip on the
Mediterranean coast, he
suggested. Israel, within the
context of a final peace agree
ment, should be prepared to
withdraw from almost all oc
cupied territories seized after the
1967 war.
Jerusalem, "which should be
the last item on the agenda of any
peace conference," will require
a more complicated solution, be
noted. Shaham rejected the in
ternationalization of the city:
"Internationalization of
Jerusalem is rejected by both the
Arab and Jewish communities.
Why should a proposal be
adopted which is unsatisfactory
to the residents of the city?
Perhaps Jerusalem should be
come an independent munici
pality with self-governing
Jewish and Arab neighborhoods.
The city can serve as a capital for
both Israel and a Palestinian
state," he said.
Israel should begin negotia
tions with the Palestinian Liber
ation Organization leading to an
independent Palestinian state,
declared David Shaham, Israeli
journalist and critic, on Wed
nesday.
Shaham, founder of the Israeli
Labour Party newspaper and
eidtor of the English-language
New Outlook magazine, spoke at
the Bechtel International Center
(I-center), Florence Moore, and
the Meyer Library Forum room.
Shaham suggested that the al
ternative to negotiations and the

settlement of the Palestinian
problem "would be a continua
tion of the confrontation . . . de
terioration of economic condi
tions in Israel," and greater
likelihood of war.
"Even the Palestinian Libera
tion Organization and the Arab
Confrontation states (the most
militant of the Arab states —
Syria, Libya, and Iraq) agree
there is nothing to be gained by
continuing the confrontation,"
he said.
"I am ready to proceed from
the assumption that the Arab
world is ready to destroy Israel,

if it could. But when Arab lead
ers, like Sadat, talk about the de
struction of Israel, they speak of
it as an event beyond their
lifetimes: they recognize that the
present confrontation is practi
cally futile." Shaham added.
Shaham argued that a viable
solution to the Middle East con
flict must be based on several
basic principles: first, "the univ
ersal recognition of the right of
self-determination lor all
peoples." This principle would
mean in practice, he said, "the
recognition that both Israelis

and Palestinians have a right to a
seperate states."
