# Driving citations for pot up
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — In the first
10 months under California's
liberalized marijuana law, the
highway patrol cited 5014
motorists for possessing small
amounts of pot, officials said
Wednescay.
During the first 10 months of
1975, the patrol made 4032 ar
rests for possession of
marijuana, said spokesman Bob
Fahs.
Under the law, possession of
an ounce or less of marijuana is
subject to a maximum $100 fine
and no arrest or booking, and all
simple possession cases are
misdemeanors. The old law re
quired the judge to decide
whether the violation was a
felony or a misdemeanor.
Fahs said the patrol did not
make a special effort against
marijuana users, but the rela
tively slight increase may be a
result of the patrol's crackdown
against drinking drivers.
"For the most part they were

incidents of traffic stops for
other reasons," Fahs said.
"When the officer came up he
would either detect the odor of
marijuana or detect a joint in the
car.
"Last year we had to take them
to jail. They were felony arrests.
Now, for less than one ounce,
they are very similar to speeding
tickets."
He said officers are generally
lenient over the precise amount
in possession.
"If a person has over one
ounce — say he's got a couple of
ounces — he probably isn't a
transporter or dealer, so we will
give him a ticket for that viola
tion, but they won't take him to
jail. But if he had a pound, he
would still be subject to a felony
arrest."
There were 181 arrests and
bookings through October this
year for possessing more than an
ounce, he said.
Fahs said the patrol, which

made 99,476 drinking driver ar
rests through October, about the
same as 1975 for the same
period, probably picked up
many marijuana smokers while
investigating possible drinking
drivers.
"Just like with alcohol, we
give a field sobriety test to de
termine if driving ability is im
paired and if it is we can take
them in for being under the in
fluence of narcotics," he added.
