# Officials review quake prediction
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — Reacting to numerous calls about a private
geophysicist's prediction of an earthquake in southern California
on Dec. 20, state disaster officials said Wednesday they will review
his method and advise the public.
"Upon receipt and based on our analysis of Henry Minturn's
prediction technique, an appropriate announcement will be made
for the use of government officials and the public," said the state
ment.
In the meantime, said the Office of Emergency Services in a
statement to officials in nine southern California counties, "the
validity of Mr. Minturn's method has not been established."
Minturn, a Pueblo,Colo..industrial scientist not connected with
any scientific institution, has been featured prominently on televi
sion in the past two weeks. He claims to have successfully forecast
several major quakes this year.
Recently he predicted that a quake will strike the Solomon Is
lands area north of Australia next Tuesday. If that quake does in fact
occur, he said, another tremor will hit "the Southern California
region" Dec. 20.
An OES spokesman said a number of businesses had inquired
about what to tell their employes. He said a doctor had been con
cerned about scheduling surgery on that day and other inquiries
had been received from as far away as New York City.
By studying maps of weak spots in the Earth's crust and the
position of the moon, Minturn says he can pick the general area and
the exact date of a quake. The moon, he believes, acts like a trigger
by exerting its gravitation pull on weak crustal zones.
He had forecast that a quake would strike "south of Mexico City"
on Nov. 29. When a large quake rocked northern Chile some 2400
miles south of Mexico City on that very day, Minturn claimed
success.
However, U.S. Geological Survey scientists familiar with Min
turn's statements in the media have largely discounted his method.
They say the role of the moon's gravity in causing quakes has been
extensively studied and has not proven useful as a method of
prediction.
The OES statement advised, however, that "California is
earthquake country and a damaging tremor could occur at any
time. Prudent and reasonable precautions,and preparations for
such an event are always advisable."
