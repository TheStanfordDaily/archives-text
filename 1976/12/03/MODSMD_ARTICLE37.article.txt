# Recycling project aids handicapped
## 
### Iris Chan 
Light blue oil drums emblazoned with the recycling symbol of an
encircled wheelchair have appeared in dorms and offices this year.
They are pert of a recycling project begun here in July.
The project was started to benefit Alpha Place, a halfway house
for the severely handicapped, according to the project's founder
H.R. Tom Sawyer, retired engineer who reputedly built the first
solar heated house in Peru.
The project is run out of a 24-hour recycling center on Pampas
Lane near the Credit Union. â€¢
Sawyer said the non-profit, tax-exempt organization provides
residential and rehabilitation center for the disabled. The funds
received from selling the recyclable materials will be used to buv
books and provide recreational services for its occupants.
So far, Sawyer said, "we are just about breaking even."
The money has been going into building the shed at the recycling
center, buying paint for the drums and transportation.
He sells the material to various companies around the Bay Area,
depending on the product. Llass bottles, for example, sell at $21
per ton with the metal cap on and $30 per ton with it off.
Alpha Place collects aluminum cans, glass containers, old news
papers, magazines and telephone books. Sawyer, with five to ten
volunteers, has placed the drums in all the dormitories on campus.
Jf he is looking for more helpers. "We need volunteers from
each living complex to transport the materials to the center 011
ampas Lane, or to call us when the material get accumulated so we
c an come pick them up," Sawyer explained. The number of Alpha
Place recycling is 328-5535.
He urged people to help generate more recyclable materials. He
said, Anyone can help if he takes off the cap ot a glass container,
washes it out and drops it into the drum. For the aluminum cans,
please pour out the content, especially if it is beer."
