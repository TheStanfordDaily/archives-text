# Many college students hitting the bottle
## 
### 
(CPS) —Alcohol. A drug of
choice. Since the end of the six
ties, when students preferred the
devil weed and other assorted
drugs, they have once again, in
ever-increasing numbers, turned
to bottled pleasure. College
drinking, made famous by the
Roaring Twenties scene, is again
being looked at. Seriously.
Coordinating its efforts with
college students and staff, the
National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)
is currently helping to develop
programs and projects to increase
awareness of potential alcoholic
abuse on campuses.
Dr. David Kraft of the Univer
sity of Massachusetts said in a
recent article of Alcohol World
that "college and university
populations . . . present certain
problems for those seeking to es
tablish primary prevention of al
cohol abuse. Social norms on

campus seem to equate alcohol
use with achievement of adult
status in our society." He says
this tends to generate indiffer
ence to any discussion of such
"normal" behavior. Kraft also
indicates that widespread use of
alcohol by faculty and staff
groups "can reinforce indiffer
ence on many campuses about
student drinking practices."
Situation looks grim
The campus alcohol situation
looks grim. Based on data col
lected by members of NIAAA,
the tollowing seems to be preva
lent in many of the nation's col
leges:
—Alcohol abuse is a common
problem at most schools, espe
cially student drunkenness and
related physical, social, and
property damage.
—Most students use alcohol to
some extent. Surveys at some
large universities indicate usage

anywhere from 71 to 96 percent.
—Many students reported get
ting drunk either frequently or
occasionally.
Questions? Why? Is there a
trend to discourage or eliminate
student drinking? What is being
done to curb or prevent alcohol
abuse?
People entering college find
drinking an integral part of cam
pus life. Peer pressure, occuring
throughout their college career,
is ever present. A recent publica
tion by the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW), The Whole College
Catalog About Drinking, said
that "getting the attention and
participation of students will not
be easy. They are not worried
about alcoholism, nor with the
long term effects of heavy drink
ing."
The catalog, prepared after in
tensive research and the co

operation of college students
and staff across the country, pre
sents ideas and program con
cepts to deal with alcohol abuse
prevention. Surveys and results
regarding student opinions
about their drinking habits are
laid out, combined with views
from suggestions and answers in
how to deal with breaking down
those rock-hard, yet most times
mistaken, ideas about alcohol
and its abuse.
Programs
Among the schools listed with
programs under way are:
—Indiana University,
has initiated a module program
aimed at helping students
explore their own alcoholic use
and attitudes. Called "Boozeand
You's," it was developed
primarily for resident students
and includes a film with a W.C.
Fields cartoon giving basic in
formation about alcohol, its
uses, drinking patterns and ef
fects. Trained student group
leaders moderate the program
and the initial results of the
program have been positive.
—At the University of Mas
sachusetts in Amherst, a three
year grant from NIAAA kicked
off a program designed to
nourish responsibility and
awareness efforts. Tests of the
varied programs will be
evaluated to see if they can be
used at other colleges. Efforts are
being made to encourage cam
pus norms which support re
sponsible drinking habits.
—A student- initiated service
at Notre Dame University pro
vides the under-21 student with
a shuttle bus service to nearby

Michigan, enabling them to
drink and lessen the hazards of
drunk driving.
—A course here at Stanford
helps students learn to distin
quish and describe small differ
ences in smell and taste in
wines. The premise is that a per
son who knows and enjoys the
distinctions will not get drunk
unless he wants to do so.

(CPS) —Alcohol. A drug of
choice. Since the end of the six
ties, when students preferred the
devil weed and other assorted
drugs, they have once again, in
ever-increasing numbers, turned
to bottled pleasure. College
drinking, made famous by the
Roaring Twenties scene, is again
being looked at. Seriously.
Coordinating its efforts with
college students and staff, the
National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)
is currently helping to develop
programs and projects to increase
awareness of potential alcoholic
abuse on campuses.
Dr. David Kraft of the Univer
sity of Massachusetts said in a
recent article of Alcohol World
that "college and university
populations . . . present certain
problems for those seeking to es
tablish primary prevention of al
cohol abuse. Social norms on

campus seem to equate alcohol
use with achievement of adult
status in our society." He says
this tends to generate indiffer
ence to any discussion of such
"normal" behavior. Kraft also
indicates that widespread use of
alcohol by faculty and staff
groups "can reinforce indiffer
ence on many campuses about
student drinking practices."
Situation looks grim
The campus alcohol situation
looks grim. Based on data col
lected by members of NIAAA,
the tollowing seems to be preva
lent in many of the nation's col
leges:
—Alcohol abuse is a common
problem at most schools, espe
cially student drunkenness and
related physical, social, and
property damage.
—Most students use alcohol to
some extent. Surveys at some
large universities indicate usage

anywhere from 71 to 96 percent.
—Many students reported get
ting drunk either frequently or
occasionally.
Questions? Why? Is there a
trend to discourage or eliminate
student drinking? What is being
done to curb or prevent alcohol
abuse?
People entering college find
drinking an integral part of cam
pus life. Peer pressure, occuring
throughout their college career,
is ever present. A recent publica
tion by the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW), The Whole College
Catalog About Drinking, said
that "getting the attention and
participation of students will not
be easy. They are not worried
about alcoholism, nor with the
long term effects of heavy drink
ing."
The catalog, prepared after in
tensive research and the co

operation of college students
and staff across the country, pre
sents ideas and program con
cepts to deal with alcohol abuse
prevention. Surveys and results
regarding student opinions
about their drinking habits are
laid out, combined with views
from suggestions and answers in
how to deal with breaking down
those rock-hard, yet most times
mistaken, ideas about alcohol
and its abuse.
Programs
Among the schools listed with
programs under way are:
—Indiana University,
has initiated a module program
aimed at helping students
explore their own alcoholic use
and attitudes. Called "Boozeand
You's," it was developed
primarily for resident students
and includes a film with a W.C.
Fields cartoon giving basic in
formation about alcohol, its
uses, drinking patterns and ef
fects. Trained student group
leaders moderate the program
and the initial results of the
program have been positive.
