As counselor of the Arms Control and Disarma
ment Agency (ACDA) between 1989 and 1973,
Weiler participated in the SALT 1 negotiations at
Helsinki and Vienna and in the first session of
SALT II at Geneva. He also participated in non
proliferation negotiations in 19f>4 to 19f>8 as special
assistant to the deputy director of ACDA and was
deputy U.S. representative to an 18-nation confer
ence on this subject.
Weiler said Carter has "a v*»ry strong interest in
arms control" and said "I'm vorv hopeful" that the

president-elect will be able to do something about
IJ.S. arms sales to foreign nations, which have.ac
cording to Weiler, "sort of gotten out of hand."
Weiler added that he thought Carter's
background as a nuclear engineer would be helpful
in his efforts to deal with the issues of arms control
and nuclear proliferation.
Weiler is teaching Political Science 138 C this
quarter, a simulation course which involves two
12-person negotiating teams representing the
Soviets and the Americans in a hypothetical series
of negotiations that Weiler calls "SALT III."
Weiler said that his students "may or may not"
reach a SALT 111 agreement.
"Come exam day, they either have to sign an
agreement or have an exam," he said.
