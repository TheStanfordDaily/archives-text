acramento (AP) — Eugene McCarthy received
412 votes for president in California, probably
»ing out Libertarian Roger Macßride for third
jce, Secretary of State March Fong Eu says.
McCarthy's write-in votes were not counted in
e unofficial tally on election night.
But ballots for McCarthy and 24 other qualified
vrite-i n contenders for president were counted in
he write-in portion of the official canvass which
Eu reported Wednesday.
In the unofficial returns, President Gerald Ford
carried California with 3,836,335 to 3,708,650 for
Democratic President-elect Jimmy Carter.
Official totals for Ford, Carter and five other
candidates whose names appeared on the Nov. 2
ballot are expected next week, said Caren Daniels,
a spokeswoman for Eu.
In the unofficial tally, Macßride was third with
55,582 votes and American Independent party

nominee Lester Maddox was fourth with 50,559.
Daniels said it is "doubtful" that there will be
enough change in Macßride's or Maddox's total to
match McCarthy's write-in tally.
Other presidential candidates on the ballot
were Peace and Freedom party nominee Margaret
Wright, 41,616 in unofficial returns; independent
candidate Peter Cainejo, 17,083; and Communist
party nominee Cus Hall, who also was listed as an
independent, 12,791.
Among the other official write-in candidates for
president was Regis "John" Jeremiah Anthony
Coldbach, a 65-year-old Lancaster janitor who is
serving a life term at the state prison at San Luis
Obispo for murder in 1971 of his wife's sister
in-law and attempted murder of his wife.
Coldbach received five write-in votes, Daniels
said.
