# How to handle landlord harrassment
## 
### 
(CPS) —It was not a pleasant
ending to Mary Capito's vaca
tion.
Mary was returning home,
feeling relaxed and happy. As
she loped up the stairs to her
apartment, Mary made a mental
note to pay her rent since it was
already three days overdue. But
approaching her front door, she
quickly found out that wouldn't
be necessary; she was greeted by
a padlock and note which read,
"Due to your failure to pay the
rent on time, we have evicted
you and have taken custody of
your possessions."

Duciiifcc uui uuc, 11 nappens
everyday in countless cities even
though most states have banned
the practice, whose legal
moniker is "forcible entry and
detainer."
It may be a throwback to the
days of powdered wigs and "six
gun justice," but landlord has
sles are still as common these
days as acne, especially in stu
dent communities where the
transient population causes a
high rental turnover.
But relief from unscrupulous
landlords is not hard to come by,
if students would always keep in
mind a few simple principles.
The first commandment of
landlord-tenant relations is,
"Thou shalt always carefully
read thy lease, especially the fine
print."
Landlords will often try and
slip in outrageous respon
sibilities or disclaimers includ
ing provisions which allow a
landlord to take all your posses
sions if your rent is just five days
late.
Cross out clauses
If, before signing your lease,
you discover any such outlan
dish clauses, make sure they're
crossed out and then signed by
the landlord, unless you feel no
particular attachment to your
worldly possessions.
One other problem area for
tenants — students especial ly —
is the gloomy region of security
deposits. The biggest racket in

town isn't numbers running or
interstate car theft, but rather the
Great American Security De
posit Swindle.
In most cases, when an apart
ment is rented the tenant is re
quired toplacea security deposit
with the landlord which is sup
posedly designed to cover any
damage caused by the renter
during the period of tenancy.
I he rules say this deposit will
be refunded when the tenant
moves on. But that's not what
always happens, even if the ten
ant leaves the place spotless. In
reality, getting your money back
is about as easy as saying "no" lo
an insurance salesman.
Lawsuit
Landlords realize that most
people, not to mention busy,
transient students, won't take
legal action even if they're "stif
fed" on their hard-earned cash.
1 he landlord's modus operandi
is to refund the money only after
the tenant has initiated a lawsuit
and seems determined to follow
it through, which is one reason
why legal action is so effective in
this area.
So, il your landlord is doing
the security deposit shuffle,
sashay down to your looal small
claims court and file an action.

Most people don't realize how
simple a procedure this is; the
forms require little more than a
working knowledge of English
— lawyers are not even allowed!
But before you make like Mel
vin Belli, be sure to check the
local law regarding what is cal
led "to notice" requirements
which usually only involve
sending the landlord an official
letter demanding the return of
your money.
Historically abused
These problems highlight the
fact that tenants have histori
cally been abused due to in
adequate legal safeguards and
the lack ot strong tenant organi
zations.
Tenant unions have not pro
liferated mainly because of the
dogged attempts of landlords to
neutralize them. The latest tac
tic for example, is to use expen
sive lawsuits based on an
tiquated laws to bludgeon tenant
unions into submission.
This maneuver is currently
being waged by powerful land
lords against Boston's city-wide
Tenants First Coalition (TEC).
Max ka-rgman, one of Boston's
largest landlords whose fiefdom
includes many students, has
slapped a multi-million dollar
lawsuit against TFC based on an
ancient civil conspiracy law
which most people felt had died
a natural death decades ago.
The idea from the landlord's

point ot view is to divert the or
ganization's energy from tenant
organizing to defending against
the lawsuit. Many tenant unions
across the country have focused
their attentions, and in some
cases money, on the kargman
lawsuit, t he result of which will
have <i monumental impact on
tenant organizing for many
apartment hunters in the future.
