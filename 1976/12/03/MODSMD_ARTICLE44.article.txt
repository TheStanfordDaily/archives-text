What Really Happened To The Class Of '65?,
by Michael Medved and Irving Wallechinsky.
Random House, 285 pages.
When the high school class of 1965 graduated,
they had already suffered through the trauma of
President Kennedy's assasination. Little did they
know that they faced even greater tests and strains
in the years to come. It was the class of '65 that was
there when the Sexual Revolution began, when
the Drug Revolution began, when the universities
started to errupt like intellectual volcanos kept
capped too long.
The class of '65 was supposed to be, as Time
magazine put it, "on the fringe of a golden era". In
a cover article running in January of 1965, Time
reported the atmosphere at the affluent Palisades
High School in suburban Los Angeles, whose stu
dents came from the upper class communities of
Pacific Palisades, Brentwood, and Bel Air.
Two alumni of that class of '65, Michael
Medved and David Wallechinsky (originally Wal
lace, son of novelists Irving and Sylvia), late one
night decided they'd discover What Really Hap
pened To The Class Of '65? and set out to track
down old classmates to try and determine how the
last tumultuous ten years had affected those ap

proaching that quickly-decimated "golden era".
Their product, a compilation of thirty interviews
with Palisades alumni, is like reading an intimate
history of the last decade. All of those interviewed
travelled through the widest spectrum of success
and disillusionment imaginable. The "squeaky
clean" debater li"es a spartan life on a commune
in northern California; the gang leader runs a
multi-million dollar clothing store chain; the
surfer who used to cut glass now teaches at
Palisades High; the head cheerleader is a history
professor; one of the flirts is now with the Los
Angeles District Attorney's office; and a red-hot
became psychologically unbalanced (after she
came to Stanford, coincidentally enough) and is
now in an institution.
While some of the students fulfilled their high
school ambitions with the regularity their
classmates would have guessed, the ironies of
others' lives is fascinating. What adds to the qual
ity of Medved's and Wallechinsky's research is
that they have produced a universal document for
all high school classes for the past ten years, for
with each year comes a new gathering of youth
approaching maturity and encountering new
traumas and successes. Whnt Really Happened
To The Class Of '65? is really the answer to the
question, what really happened to all of us?
