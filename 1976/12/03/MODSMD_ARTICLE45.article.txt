Published quarterly, The Edge
offers a creative outlet for sci
ence fiction and fantasy writers
here. "Protective Reaction" by
Toni Dwiggins, "The Repast" by
Time Luddington comprise the
first edition of volume three.
Utilizing flashback technique,
Dwiggins creates a fast-moving
plot concerning an earth-colony
on the planet Istra. The plot re
volves around two main charac
ters, Favry and Leng. Leng,
F"avry and their children are the

survivors of a plague-induced
madness that destroyed the rest
of the colonists.
They await a ship from earth
that is making the first check on
the colony for many years.
Dwiggins displays creativity in
the conclusion to this short story.
. "The Repast" with a macabre
twist, surprises the reader. The
setting is a rural haven called
Sabbern. The village men have
just returned from a hunting ex
pedition. Their game, however,
is far from ordinary and the con

elusion to the one page story
leaves the reader perplexed, but
smiling wryly.
The third story, "Needs" in
volves a good story line but lacks
meaningful development in
terms of character motivation.
The theme of the story is revenge
and the action involves two
characters as the author poin
tedly states in the opening sen
tence. Harlach is a deformed
outcast of a deserted Mars min
ing town. He is only one of many
who inhabit a territory called
The Belt.
The last selection, entitled "Il
lusions" needs closer inspection
than one reading but even after
many perusals the reader is hard
pressed to understand the un
derlying theme. The story opens
as Brent, the main character, is
escaping from jail. As he steps
out of the jailhouse door, he falls
or is jerked into another uni
verse.
In this universe however,
Brent is only an illusion but still
manages to knock out two of his
opponents. The plot continues
to thicken until we leave Brent
entering a car in this universe
making a statement about Mr.
Hoover.
