"When fishing for treasures in
the flood, be careful not to pull in
girls."
—old Chinese saying
"Feeding girls is feeding cow
birds."
—another old Chinese saying
"Better to raise geese than
girls."
—and another old Chinese say
ing
"I read in an anthropology
book that Chinese say, 'Girls are
necessary too'; I have never
heard the Chinese 1 know make
this concession. Perhaps it was a
saying in another village."
—Maxine Hong Kingston
It is hard to imagine growing
up as a female in an atmosphere
where this kind of advice and
general anti-woman sentiment
pervades the very air one
breathes. Yet Maxine Hong
Kingston grew up in the "ghost
filled," deeply traditional
Stockton Chinatown of the '50s
and has succeeded, despite this
blatantly oppressive and ancient
attitude toward females, in pro
ducing an outspoken, provoca
tive and profoundly moving
volume chronicling her evolu
tion from a spaced-out, insecure,
and mildly neurotic teenager to a
competent, confident and
poised young college-graduate.
The Woman Warrior, subtitled
Memoirs of a Girlhood Among
Ghosts, is compiled of an
guished thoughts, dreams,
"talk-story,"and other minor de
tails of youth. That Kingston ex
perienced an unusually long and
tortured childhood is made evi
dent from page one, where her
mother, Brave Orchid, reveals to
her the existence of a disgraced
aunt who killed herself (though
angry villagers came damn close
to doing it for her) because she
became pregnant while her hus
band was overseas in America. It
was a sin not to be tolerated.
Fortunately for Kingston, she
had a feisty spirit that would not
let her accept as fact the basic
worthlessness accorded to
Chinese women by Chinese soc
iety. She fought to keep her san
ity, to be accepted and recog
nized as a person, but her stifling
surroundings nearly brought her
down. That fight to be Person,
Woman, Chinese — in that order
— was certainly not an easy one.

For one thing, she had to con
tend with a very traditional
Chinese mother who emigrated
to the U.S. in 1940 at the age of
45. And from what can be
gleaned from this book, very
traditional Chinese mothers
sound a whole lot like very tradi
tional Jewish mothers. Take, for
example, the time Kingston "last
visited" her parents. Bedridden
and in a sleepy stupor, she eyes
her watchful mother, who is sit
ting in a chair next to her.
"What's the matter, Mama?
Why are you sitting there?"
She (Mama) reached over and
switched on a lamp she hud
placed on the floor beside her. "1
swallowed that LSD pill you left
on the kitchen counter," she an
nounced.
"That wasn't LSD Mama. It
was just a cold pill. I have a
cold."
"You're always catchingcolds
when you come home. You must
be eating too much yin. Let me
get you another quilt."
"No, no more quilts. . . ."
"You children never tell me
what you're really up to. How
else am I going to find out what
you're really up to?" As if her
head hurt, she closed her eyes
behind the gold wire rims.

"Aiaa," she sighed, "how can 1
bear to have you leave me
again?"
As a result of being barraged
so intensely with people and
spirits from times long past,
Kingston grew into a sensitive

and insightful youn« woman. In
The Woman Warrior, she tells
her highly original story of
growing up with ghosts, being
haunted by dreams and odd
"memories" of a China she never
knew.

The Woman Warrior is the tale of a young woman growing up in
an oppressive era which almost crushes her by refusing to
allow her development as a person.
