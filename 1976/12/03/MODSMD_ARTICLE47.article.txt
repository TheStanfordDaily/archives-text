Surviving the Undergraduate Jungle, The Good
Students' Guide to Good Grades. By Kathy Crafts
and Brenda Hauthor. Grove Press, $3.95.
This book might best be billed as "The Pre-
Professional's Guide to Getting Through". The
overriding philosophy of the book is that the
university—any university—is an opponent, and
students should capitalize on the weaknesses of
the system in order to get through with acceptable
grades.
The authors would have the book to be an in
formation guide, an outline of the options availa
ble to the unwashed masses as they enter college
in the bloom of post-high school youth. They
make no bones about being anti-intellectual,
going on the theory that "competition for grades
and the small number of places in choice graduate
and professional schools has managed to kill al
most all intellectual curiosity among under
graduates these days."
This attitude dominates the book. For example,
the section on paper writing begins with a guide
to buying papers, which the authors seem to feel is
not the wisest option, but if you want to (or must)
then do it. Next to buying, the favorite method of
paper production is going to the library, reading
one book, condensing it and adding transition
sentences to smoothe out the rough edges. The
result is a paper "long on facts and theory and

very short on personal interpretation."
Sound familiar?
Having removed the possibility of genuine in
tellectual fervor, the book seems offensive at first,
especially if you really did take Modern Europe 1
because you wanted to know about Luther. But on
closer reflection, it may be a sign of the times that
two recent graduates from this race for grades
would set down this missal of near illegal ac
tivities. At any rate, those in favor of the move
toward "more structured education" would be
horrified.
Despite these attitudes, the book.offers some
advice that may be a bit more helpful than most
university publications, even more valuable than
talking with your advisor. Recommendations
which urge students to wait to take the most dif
ficult courses (chemistry) until sophomore or
even junior year seem to make a great deal of
sense.
All in all, the book suffers from a miserable
attitude about the role of the university and the
attitude of most students. Admitted, there is prob
ably a gap in students' expressed intellectual in
terests and their real attitudes, but to assume that
there is no intellectual force on the'campuses
today is to take the case too far. If this were truly
the case then extracurricular and academically
oriented groups would fail. The book is amusing,
but lacks depth.
