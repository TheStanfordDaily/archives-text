### Dave Ansley 
Some people think Britain and
America are alike. They're crazy.
The two countries share a lan
guage and a couple of dates in
their respective history books,
but beyond that they have little
in common.
Britain's culture is much older
than ours most of its towns
and villages were settled more
than a thousand years ago. Every
road, rock, bridge and hedge has
some historical significance,
dutifully marked by an old
plaque and perpetuated by the
local historical society.
You can pay homage to
Shakespeare's house in
Stratford-upon-Avon, Keats'
house in Hampstead, Isaac New
ton's house in Woolsthorpe
Manor, or Words worth's place in
Cockermouth.
The natives take all this an
tiquity very casually. A farmer
will calmly estimate that his
stone house is 450 years old. The
original roof has been replaced
and the plumbing moved in
doors, but that's all that has
changed in centuries.
Canterbury cathedral, in
southeast England, has under
gone several periods of construc
tion. A map affixed to one wall
locates all the various buildings
and ruins and color-codes them
by date of origin. The earliest
sections are pre-900, and the
colors represent 100-year
chunks up to 1500. Everything
built after 1500 is shown in the
same color and labeled "mod
ern."
Tradition
Britons cling steadfastly to
their traditions. Tea and biscuits
in the afternoon, a game of darts
at the and a handful of fish
and chips wrapped in news
paper are treated with national
reverence. Every hillside is dot
ted with sheep, every clock
tower sounds like Big Ben, and
every town has a weekly outside
market with scrawny oranges
and fresh-killed rabbits dis
played side by side.
As long as teatime stands, the
kingdom stands. When the
pound sinks to the level of the
dollar, the first reaction will be
to pour another cuppa.
Another tradition is polite
conversation, but it has been
taken too far. If you forget to say
"please" three times while buy
ing a newspaper, the shopkeeper
takes offense. Politeness has
gone beyond custom — it's a
must.
"Please, could I have a cup of

tea, please?"
"Sugar?" (you get milk au
tomatically)
"Two, please."
"Fifteen pence, please."
(hands you the cup and a saucer)
"'Kyou" (as you pay).
"'Kyou" (as change is re
turned).
"'Kyou" (as you accept the
change).
When they're not busy thank
ing each other for thanking each
other, they talk about the
weather. It's an easy way to pass
a train ride, and although the
long summer drought has been
over for two wet months, it's still
the number one topic on the
London-Edinburgh run.
The British impression of
Americans is simple: we're loud,
rude and not fit to participate in
civilized discourse. A noisy
American accent will get you
nowhere.
But while they look down on
our mouths, they look up to a lot
of other American things. Colt
45 is "what all America talks ab
out," say the ads. Fruit of the
Loom is "the underwear Ameri
can women love most." Ginger
ale is known as "American
ginger ale," gum drops as
"American gums."
The capitalists get overcon
fident sometimes. One very
popular piece of clothing is a
football jersey emblazoned
"Kansas Cowboys."
Starsky and Hutch, who ap
pear every week on BBC, are the
latest idols of every 13 year old
girl. The program is holding
fourth place in the television rat
ings, having just outranked
another superstar, Kojak.
Man with the teeth
ferry Ford was popular here
also, lame duck or not. The
British took an instant disliking
to the "man with the teeth" and
cheered the president from afar
during the campaign.
England was particularly
upset with Carter's support for a
united Ireland.
The news media followed the
campaign closely; BBC even
broadcast the three debates. But
not all were so attentive: one na
tional newspaper continuously
referred to the eventual victor as
"Senator Carter."
Britain is going through some
political turmoil itself, and more
than just sterling is showing tar
nish. Racial tension is growing
as workers see their taxes sup
porting "coloreds" who immig
rate from other Commonwealth

countries. Many British people
deny being prejudiced: "I'm not
racist—there's just too bloody
many wogs."
The growth of socialism has
caused growing dissatisfaction,
especially among the middle
and upper classes. Large indus
tries have been nationalized, and
the labor unions are very power
ful. Unemployment, inflation
and taxation are all high.
But damn the torpedoes, it's
time for another round of Guin
ness.

reverence. Every hillside is dot

tower sounds like Big Ben, and
every town has a weekly outside
market with scrawny oranges
and fresh-killed rabbits dis
played side by side.
As long as teatime stands, the
kingdom stands. When the
pound sinks to the level of the
dollar, the first reaction will be
to pour another cuppa.
Another tradition is polite
conversation, but it has been
taken too far. If you forget to say
"please" three times while buy
ing a newspaper, the shopkeeper
takes offense. Politeness has
gone beyond custom — it's a
must.
"Please, could I have a cup of

tea, please?"
"Sugar?" (you get milk au
tomatically)
"Two, please."
"Fifteen pence, please."
(hands you the cup and a saucer)
"'Kyou" (as you pay).
"'Kyou" (as change is re
turned).
"'Kyou" (as you accept the
change).
When they're not busy thank
ing each other for thanking each
other, they talk about the
weather. It's an easy way to pass
a train ride, and although the
long summer drought has been
over for two wet months, it's still
the number one topic on the
London-Edinburgh run.
The British impression of
Americans is simple: we're loud,
rude and not fit to participate in
civilized discourse. A noisy
American accent will get you
nowhere.
But while they look down on
our mouths, they look up to a lot
of other American things. Colt
45 is "what all America talks ab
out," say the ads. Fruit of the
Loom is "the underwear Ameri
can women love most." Ginger
ale is known as "American
ginger ale," gum drops as
"American gums."
The capitalists get overcon
fident sometimes. One very
popular piece of clothing is a
football jersey emblazoned
"Kansas Cowboys."
Starsky and Hutch, who ap
pear every week on BBC, are the
latest idols of every 13 year old
girl. The program is holding
fourth place in the television rat
ings, having just outranked
another superstar, Kojak.
Man with the teeth
ferry Ford was popular here
also, lame duck or not. The
British took an instant disliking
to the "man with the teeth" and
cheered the president from afar
during the campaign.
England was particularly
upset with Carter's support for a
united Ireland.
The news media followed the
campaign closely; BBC even
broadcast the three debates. But
not all were so attentive: one na
tional newspaper continuously
referred to the eventual victor as
"Senator Carter."
Britain is going through some
political turmoil itself, and more
than just sterling is showing tar
nish. Racial tension is growing
as workers see their taxes sup
porting "coloreds" who immig
rate from other Commonwealth

countries. Many British people
deny being prejudiced: "I'm not
racist—there's just too bloody
many wogs."
The growth of socialism has
caused growing dissatisfaction,
especially among the middle
and upper classes. Large indus
tries have been nationalized, and
the labor unions are very power
ful. Unemployment, inflation
and taxation are all high.
But damn the torpedoes, it's
time for another round of Guin
ness.
Some people think Britain and
America are alike. They're crazy.
The two countries share a lan
guage and a couple of dates in
their respective history books,
but beyond that they have little
in common.
Britain's culture is much older
than ours most of its towns
and villages were settled more
than a thousand years ago. Every
road, rock, bridge and hedge has
some historical significance,
dutifully marked by an old
plaque and perpetuated by the
local historical society.
You can pay homage to
Shakespeare's house in
Stratford-upon-Avon, Keats'
house in Hampstead, Isaac New
ton's house in Woolsthorpe
Manor, or Words worth's place in
Cockermouth.
The natives take all this an
tiquity very casually. A farmer
will calmly estimate that his
stone house is 450 years old. The
original roof has been replaced
and the plumbing moved in
doors, but that's all that has
changed in centuries.
Canterbury cathedral, in
southeast England, has under
gone several periods of construc
tion. A map affixed to one wall
locates all the various buildings
and ruins and color-codes them
by date of origin. The earliest
sections are pre-900, and the
colors represent 100-year
chunks up to 1500. Everything
built after 1500 is shown in the
same color and labeled "mod
ern."
Tradition
Britons cling steadfastly to
their traditions. Tea and biscuits
in the afternoon, a game of darts

45 is "what all America talks ab
out," say the ads. Fruit of the
Loom is "the underwear Ameri
can women love most." Ginger
ale is known as "American
ginger ale," gum drops as
"American gums."
The capitalists get overcon
fident sometimes. One very
popular piece of clothing is a
football jersey emblazoned
"Kansas Cowboys."
Starsky and Hutch, who ap
pear every week on BBC, are the
latest idols of every 13 year old
girl. The program is holding
fourth place in the television rat
ings, having just outranked
another superstar, Kojak.
Man with the teeth
ferry Ford was popular here
also, lame duck or not. The
British took an instant disliking
to the "man with the teeth" and
cheered the president from afar
during the campaign.
England was particularly
upset with Carter's support for a
united Ireland.
The news media followed the
campaign closely; BBC even
broadcast the three debates. But
not all were so attentive: one na
tional newspaper continuously
referred to the eventual victor as
"Senator Carter."
Britain is going through some
political turmoil itself, and more
than just sterling is showing tar
nish. Racial tension is growing
as workers see their taxes sup
porting "coloreds" who immig
rate from other Commonwealth

countries. Many British people
deny being prejudiced: "I'm not
racist—there's just too bloody
many wogs."
The growth of socialism has
caused growing dissatisfaction,
especially among the middle
and upper classes. Large indus
tries have been nationalized, and
the labor unions are very power
ful. Unemployment, inflation
and taxation are all high.
But damn the torpedoes, it's
time for another round of Guin
ness.
Some people think Britain and
America are alike. They're crazy.
The two countries share a lan
guage and a couple of dates in
their respective history books,
but beyond that they have little
in common.
Britain's culture is much older
than ours most of its towns
and villages were settled more
than a thousand years ago. Every
road, rock, bridge and hedge has
some historical significance,
dutifully marked by an old
plaque and perpetuated by the
local historical society.
You can pay homage to
Shakespeare's house in
Stratford-upon-Avon, Keats'
house in Hampstead, Isaac New
ton's house in Woolsthorpe
Manor, or Words worth's place in
Cockermouth.
The natives take all this an
tiquity very casually. A farmer
will calmly estimate that his
stone house is 450 years old. The
original roof has been replaced
and the plumbing moved in
doors, but that's all that has
changed in centuries.
Canterbury cathedral, in
southeast England, has under
gone several periods of construc
tion. A map affixed to one wall
locates all the various buildings
and ruins and color-codes them
by date of origin. The earliest
sections are pre-900, and the
colors represent 100-year
chunks up to 1500. Everything
built after 1500 is shown in the
same color and labeled "mod
ern."
Tradition
Britons cling steadfastly to
their traditions. Tea and biscuits
in the afternoon, a game of darts
at the and a handful of fish
and chips wrapped in news
paper are treated with national
reverence. Every hillside is dot
ted with sheep, every clock
tower sounds like Big Ben, and
every town has a weekly outside
market with scrawny oranges
and fresh-killed rabbits dis
played side by side.
As long as teatime stands, the
kingdom stands. When the
pound sinks to the level of the
dollar, the first reaction will be
to pour another cuppa.
Another tradition is polite
conversation, but it has been
taken too far. If you forget to say
"please" three times while buy
ing a newspaper, the shopkeeper
takes offense. Politeness has
gone beyond custom — it's a
must.
"Please, could I have a cup of

tea, please?"
"Sugar?" (you get milk au
tomatically)
"Two, please."
"Fifteen pence, please."
(hands you the cup and a saucer)
"'Kyou" (as you pay).
"'Kyou" (as change is re
turned).
"'Kyou" (as you accept the
change).
When they're not busy thank
ing each other for thanking each
other, they talk about the
weather. It's an easy way to pass
a train ride, and although the
long summer drought has been
over for two wet months, it's still
the number one topic on the
London-Edinburgh run.
The British impression of
Americans is simple: we're loud,
rude and not fit to participate in
civilized discourse. A noisy
American accent will get you
nowhere.
But while they look down on
our mouths, they look up to a lot
of other American things. Colt
45 is "what all America talks ab
out," say the ads. Fruit of the
Loom is "the underwear Ameri
can women love most." Ginger
ale is known as "American
ginger ale," gum drops as
"American gums."
