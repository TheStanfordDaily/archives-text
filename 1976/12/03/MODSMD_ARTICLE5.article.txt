### Bill Sing Staff writer 
In a monumental decision affecting
the future of undergraduate education
at Stanford, the Faculty Senate yester
day approved a resolution calling for
the re-institution of an undergraduate
requirement in Western Culture.
The vote was 23 to I t.
In submitting the resolution, Assoc.
English Prof. William Cbace ?">id such
a requirement is in keeping "with the
kind of undergraduate education this
university honestly feels it owes to its
students and to its reputation."
Education, said Chace, involves on

the student's part "the tacit under
standing that there are many things yet
to be known," and on the institution's
part "a responsibility to that student
and to the challenging and develop
ment of his or her mind."
The resolution directs the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies, work
ing in conjunction with the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies, the Dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, and the Dean of the School of
Engineering, to specify how the re
quirement is to be met.
The requirement will apply to every
undergraduate admitted to Stanford

after the fall of 1978.
The requirement "is to be defined as
one embracing an explicit historical
dimension, and is to be satisfied in a
limited number of precisely defined
ways."
"We owe an obligation to our stu
dents (to see) that they are exposed to
some of the goals and ideals of our
culture," said Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Halsey Royden.
Royden also said the university will
allow for the possibdity of highly
motivated students designing prog
rams of their own to meet this re
quirement.
In opposition to the proposal. Assoc.
Education Prof. Denis Phillips said
any decline in liberal undergraduate
education is best remedied by "hiring
more excellent teachers and freeing
our best scholars to teach in more un
dergraduate courses.
"We need very strong evidence,"
said Phillips, to show that the prop
osed requirement "will do what it's
supposed to do."
'Ethnocentric conception'
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Sylvia
Yanagisako objected to the proposed
requirement as based upon an
"ethnocentric conception" that
studies in Western Culture is "what
liberal education is all about."
In response, Asst. Political Science
Prof. Nannerl keohane said studies in
Western Culture are not ethnocentric it
based upon.a belief in the existence of
"an intellectual culture" and
"dialogue across centuries" among
some relatively identifiable group of
