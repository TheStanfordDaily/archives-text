# Faculty Senate passes Western Civ resolution
## 
### Bill Sing Staff writer 
In a monumental decision affecting
the future of undergraduate education
at Stanford, the Faculty Senate yester
day approved a resolution calling for
the re-institution of an undergraduate
requirement in Western Culture.
The vote was 23 to I t.
In submitting the resolution, Assoc.
English Prof. William Cbace ?">id such
a requirement is in keeping "with the
kind of undergraduate education this
university honestly feels it owes to its
students and to its reputation."
Education, said Chace, involves on

the student's part "the tacit under
standing that there are many things yet
to be known," and on the institution's
part "a responsibility to that student
and to the challenging and develop
ment of his or her mind."
The resolution directs the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies, work
ing in conjunction with the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies, the Dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, and the Dean of the School of
Engineering, to specify how the re
quirement is to be met.
The requirement will apply to every
undergraduate admitted to Stanford

after the fall of 1978.
The requirement "is to be defined as
one embracing an explicit historical
dimension, and is to be satisfied in a
limited number of precisely defined
ways."
"We owe an obligation to our stu
dents (to see) that they are exposed to
some of the goals and ideals of our
culture," said Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Halsey Royden.
Royden also said the university will
allow for the possibdity of highly
motivated students designing prog
rams of their own to meet this re
quirement.
In opposition to the proposal. Assoc.
Education Prof. Denis Phillips said
any decline in liberal undergraduate
education is best remedied by "hiring
more excellent teachers and freeing
our best scholars to teach in more un
dergraduate courses.
"We need very strong evidence,"
said Phillips, to show that the prop
osed requirement "will do what it's
supposed to do."
'Ethnocentric conception'
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Sylvia
Yanagisako objected to the proposed
requirement as based upon an
"ethnocentric conception" that
studies in Western Culture is "what
liberal education is all about."
In response, Asst. Political Science
Prof. Nannerl keohane said studies in
Western Culture are not ethnocentric it
based upon.a belief in the existence of
"an intellectual culture" and
"dialogue across centuries" among
some relatively identifiable group of

ASSU Sen. Brad Krevoy said such a
task force could take into account
other areas of study in the sciences and
social sciences that are equally impor
tant in undergraduate education.
Proponents of the resolution main
tained. however, that Committee on
Undergraduate Studies will be able to
iron out such questions as what
courses will be offered, who will teach
them, and how it will affect Stanford's
new distribution requirements.
Assoc. English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
said many students reach their senior
year and look back upon their experi
ences as "something pretty much like
a cafeteria tray, with dishes scattered
here and there adding up to nothing.
"We owe students more than that
precisely because they are so
talented," Rebholz said.

President Richard Lyman endorsed
the proposal, and said it will give Stan
ford "a coherence we sadly lack now."
A requirement in Western Culture
was dropped by the university in 1969
in response to recommendations by
the 1968 Study of Education At Stan
ford.
Reinstitution of the Western Culture
requirement was proposed in January
of this year by the Committee on Re
form and Renewal of Liberal Educa
tion at Stanford (CORRLES) and sub
mitted to the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (C-US) for further
consideration.
C-US endorsed the principle that
"studies in Western Culture should be
a part of each student's education," but
urged against institution of a Western
Culture requirement.
