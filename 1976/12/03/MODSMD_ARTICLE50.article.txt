# Frat pledges still endure initiation
## 
### Eliza Kinsell 
"The Fraternity and the Col
lege," a book published in 1931,
states that fraternity initiation
rites sometimes included
"painting the body of the victim,
torturing him with electrical
horrors, feeding him nauseating
messes, and beating him up to
see how much pain he could
stand."
Fortunately, the group of
about 250 students who became
pledges for the 13 men's social
fraternities on campus last
spring did not have to look for
ward to such activities. How
ever, every house has its own
mysterious and ritualistic tradi
tions that the pledge experiences
before he becomes an active
member of the organization.
At Theta Xi when a student
accepts his bid, a invitation to
join the frat, he is "strongly
urged to chug a litre of a bever
age of his choice," says Rich
Johnson, last year's rush chair
man.
The first duty the pledges are
assigned at other houses, like
Zeta Fsi (Zete) and Delta Upsilon
(DLJ) is to put on a big party, usu
ally a luau, for the fraternity.
Illicit activities
Last year DU pledges were in
charge of the tropical decor for
the party. Gathering the bamboo,
palm fronds, and flowers "en
tailed many illicit activities,"
according to one member.
Ron Pellegrini, a past presi
dent of Zete Fsi, says pledges are
told to "stay out of trouble"
when getting the'props for the
Hawiian jungle but there is al
ways the "implication of steal
ing since other people have done
it." Spring quarter two years ago
the police caught one Zete while
he was swiping a huge banana
sign from a record store. This
past spring three pledges were

arrested in connection with the
theft of torches from a restaurant.
During the end of spring quar
ter at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
(SAE) house, pledges are intro
duced to each other and to active
fraternity members by par
ticipating in pizza runs, baseball
games and a beach trip,says SAE
pledge trainer Jack Connelly.
Big rocks
Last May at the Sigma Chi
house the pledges participated
in an activity that was "designed
to bring them together," accord
ing to member Bob Ottilie, past
president or the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC). One morning at
3:30 the pledges were instructed
to remove a specific boulder
from the foothills and to bring it
back to the fraternity. When they
arrived at the house, everyone
socialized at a champagne break
fast.
Some houses require the
pledges to come a week to ten
days early, in the fall, to clean
and repair the house. During this
time the Kappa Alpha (KA)
pledges complete their "pledge
project." Pete Truex, a past pres
ident of the house, recalls that
his pledge class paneled the din
ing room and another group put
a new floor in the television
room.
The Zetes and the kA's ask the
pledges to clean the house until
they are formally initiated dur
ing winter quarter. After that all
members share the duties.
In fall quarter some frater
nities pair each pledge with an
active, a "big brother," who may
even become his roommate. Ot
tilie says that the "big brother"
helps the pledge get to know
other members and answers
questions about frat life.
History
Before the official initiation
ceremonies new members are

expected to learn the history of
the fraternity during pledge
meetings and from pledge man
uals.
At the KA house pledges read
about Samuel Zenas Ammen.
who originated the fraternity's
secret ceremonies, and General
Robert E. Lee. the spiritual foun
der of the organization.
The KA and Sigma Chi
pledges must pass a test on the
history of the local chapter and
the national fraternity. They are
allowed to take the test over
again if they fail, but neither Ot
tilie nor Truex remember anyone
failing the exam.
Hell week
In February, 1946 the IFC
abolished "hell week," a period
when the pledges would un
dergo prolonged harassment be
fore initiation. However, a few
frats retain amended versions of
the tradition.
Pellegrini says the activities
during the Zete's hell week are
humorous in nature. Pledge
duties include answering the
phone before it rings three times,
wearing underwear backwards
and serving dinner to the big
brothers. The penalty for dis
obedience is to sing a song or tell
a joke at dinner.
Hell "week" at the KA house
lasts about three days. The
pledges do all the work at the
house so the actives can rest, ac
cording to Truex.
Other frats, such as SAE and
Phi Delta Theta (Phi Delt), have a
wild scavengerhunt a few nights
before the initiation. The SAE
pledges are issued a "mystic
scroll" with directions that in
struct them to go to San Fran
cisco to collect things. Connelly
claims that sometimes they must
bring back people, like an Avis
rent-a-car girl, before they return
to campus the next morning.

The initiation ceremonies,
which occur in late fall quarter
through early spring, usually in
volve a'.umni and are composed
of secret rituals, confidential
handshakes and other special
traditions.
Johnson says his frat is "low
key " and does not have much of
the "bullshit ritual." He claims
that tlie only ceremony at his in
itiation involved "a guy in a
jockstrap and a cape reading
from 'The Ritual' (Theta Xi
handbook) to his drunken
fraternity brothers."
Another member of Theta Xi,
Joel Kohn, claims that "the altar
and all the other paraphernalia
in the secret chapter room,
where initiations were held, was
sold lor a keg of beer" in the late
19605.
I'he Phi Delts still use their
altar to support the Bible during
the ceremony. The KA initiation
is held in a local church and in
volves special regalia. Other
fraternities will not divulge any
information about their secret
initiation ceremonies.
Most pledges must pay a fee to
the national organization before
they become active members of
the frat but the Phi Delt house
pays the fee for its initiates. The
initiation fees are substantial; for
example, a Theta Xi pledge pays
$125 and the cost at SAE is $100.
However, not all men who
pledge a fraternity become ac
tive members.
An article in the September,
1970 issue ofFraternity Monthly
states that "so many pledges
never make it to initia
tion . . . because we're still play
ing games with them and they
have better things to do,"
Tim Ferguson, former IFC
rush chairman, states at Stanford
"it is unusual for a house to lose
more than one or two pledges."
"The Fraternity and the Col
lege," a book published in 1931,
states that fraternity initiation
rites sometimes included

torturing him with electrical
horrors, feeding him nauseating

duties include answering the
phone before it rings three times,
wearing underwear backwards
and serving dinner to the big
brothers. The penalty for dis
obedience is to sing a song or tell
a joke at dinner.
Hell "week" at the KA house
lasts about three days. The
pledges do all the work at the
house so the actives can rest, ac
cording to Truex.
Other frats, such as SAE and
Phi Delta Theta (Phi Delt), have a
wild scavengerhunt a few nights
before the initiation. The SAE
pledges are issued a "mystic
scroll" with directions that in
struct them to go to San Fran
cisco to collect things. Connelly
claims that sometimes they must
bring back people, like an Avis
rent-a-car girl, before they return
to campus the next morning.

The initiation ceremonies,
which occur in late fall quarter
through early spring, usually in
volve a'.umni and are composed
of secret rituals, confidential
handshakes and other special
traditions.
Johnson says his frat is "low
key " and does not have much of
the "bullshit ritual." He claims
that tlie only ceremony at his in
itiation involved "a guy in a
jockstrap and a cape reading
from 'The Ritual' (Theta Xi
handbook) to his drunken
fraternity brothers."
Another member of Theta Xi,
Joel Kohn, claims that "the altar
and all the other paraphernalia
in the secret chapter room,
where initiations were held, was
sold lor a keg of beer" in the late
19605.
I'he Phi Delts still use their
altar to support the Bible during
the ceremony. The KA initiation
is held in a local church and in
volves special regalia. Other
fraternities will not divulge any
information about their secret
initiation ceremonies.
Most pledges must pay a fee to
the national organization before
they become active members of
the frat but the Phi Delt house
pays the fee for its initiates. The
initiation fees are substantial; for
example, a Theta Xi pledge pays
$125 and the cost at SAE is $100.
However, not all men who
pledge a fraternity become ac
tive members.
An article in the September,
1970 issue ofFraternity Monthly
states that "so many pledges
never make it to initia
tion . . . because we're still play
ing games with them and they
have better things to do,"
Tim Ferguson, former IFC
rush chairman, states at Stanford
"it is unusual for a house to lose
more than one or two pledges."
"The Fraternity and the Col
lege," a book published in 1931,
states that fraternity initiation
rites sometimes included
"painting the body of the victim,
torturing him with electrical
horrors, feeding him nauseating
messes, and beating him up to
see how much pain he could
stand."
Fortunately, the group of
about 250 students who became
pledges for the 13 men's social
fraternities on campus last
spring did not have to look for
ward to such activities. How
ever, every house has its own
mysterious and ritualistic tradi
tions that the pledge experiences
before he becomes an active
member of the organization.
At Theta Xi when a student
accepts his bid, a invitation to
join the frat, he is "strongly
urged to chug a litre of a bever
age of his choice," says Rich
Johnson, last year's rush chair
man.
The first duty the pledges are
assigned at other houses, like
Zeta Fsi (Zete) and Delta Upsilon
(DLJ) is to put on a big party, usu
ally a luau, for the fraternity.
Illicit activities
Last year DU pledges were in
charge of the tropical decor for
the party. Gathering the bamboo,
palm fronds, and flowers "en
tailed many illicit activities,"
according to one member.
Ron Pellegrini, a past presi
dent of Zete Fsi, says pledges are
told to "stay out of trouble"
when getting the'props for the
Hawiian jungle but there is al
ways the "implication of steal
ing since other people have done
it." Spring quarter two years ago
the police caught one Zete while
he was swiping a huge banana
sign from a record store. This
past spring three pledges were

arrested in connection with the
theft of torches from a restaurant.
During the end of spring quar
ter at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
(SAE) house, pledges are intro
duced to each other and to active
fraternity members by par
ticipating in pizza runs, baseball
games and a beach trip,says SAE
pledge trainer Jack Connelly.
Big rocks
Last May at the Sigma Chi
house the pledges participated
in an activity that was "designed
to bring them together," accord
ing to member Bob Ottilie, past
president or the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC). One morning at
3:30 the pledges were instructed
to remove a specific boulder
from the foothills and to bring it
back to the fraternity. When they
arrived at the house, everyone
socialized at a champagne break
fast.
Some houses require the
pledges to come a week to ten
days early, in the fall, to clean
and repair the house. During this
time the Kappa Alpha (KA)
pledges complete their "pledge
project." Pete Truex, a past pres
ident of the house, recalls that
his pledge class paneled the din
ing room and another group put
a new floor in the television
room.
The Zetes and the kA's ask the
pledges to clean the house until
they are formally initiated dur
ing winter quarter. After that all
members share the duties.
In fall quarter some frater
nities pair each pledge with an
active, a "big brother," who may
even become his roommate. Ot
tilie says that the "big brother"
helps the pledge get to know
other members and answers
questions about frat life.
History
Before the official initiation
ceremonies new members are

expected to learn the history of
the fraternity during pledge
meetings and from pledge man
uals.
At the KA house pledges read
about Samuel Zenas Ammen.
who originated the fraternity's
secret ceremonies, and General
Robert E. Lee. the spiritual foun
der of the organization.
The KA and Sigma Chi
pledges must pass a test on the
history of the local chapter and
the national fraternity. They are
allowed to take the test over
again if they fail, but neither Ot
tilie nor Truex remember anyone
failing the exam.
Hell week
In February, 1946 the IFC
abolished "hell week," a period
when the pledges would un
dergo prolonged harassment be
fore initiation. However, a few
frats retain amended versions of
the tradition.

arrested in connection with the
theft of torches from a restaurant.
During the end of spring quar
ter at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
(SAE) house, pledges are intro
duced to each other and to active
fraternity members by par
ticipating in pizza runs, baseball
games and a beach trip,says SAE
pledge trainer Jack Connelly.
Big rocks
Last May at the Sigma Chi
house the pledges participated
in an activity that was "designed
to bring them together," accord
ing to member Bob Ottilie, past
president or the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC). One morning at
3:30 the pledges were instructed
to remove a specific boulder
from the foothills and to bring it
back to the fraternity. When they
arrived at the house, everyone
socialized at a champagne break
fast.
Some houses require the
pledges to come a week to ten
days early, in the fall, to clean
and repair the house. During this
time the Kappa Alpha (KA)
pledges complete their "pledge
project." Pete Truex, a past pres
ident of the house, recalls that
his pledge class paneled the din
ing room and another group put
a new floor in the television
room.
The Zetes and the kA's ask the
pledges to clean the house until
they are formally initiated dur
ing winter quarter. After that all
members share the duties.
In fall quarter some frater
nities pair each pledge with an
active, a "big brother," who may
even become his roommate. Ot
tilie says that the "big brother"
helps the pledge get to know
other members and answers
questions about frat life.
History
Before the official initiation
ceremonies new members are

expected to learn the history of
the fraternity during pledge
meetings and from pledge man
uals.
At the KA house pledges read
about Samuel Zenas Ammen.
who originated the fraternity's
secret ceremonies, and General
Robert E. Lee. the spiritual foun
der of the organization.
The KA and Sigma Chi
pledges must pass a test on the
history of the local chapter and
the national fraternity. They are
allowed to take the test over
again if they fail, but neither Ot
tilie nor Truex remember anyone
failing the exam.
Hell week
In February, 1946 the IFC
abolished "hell week," a period
when the pledges would un
dergo prolonged harassment be
fore initiation. However, a few
frats retain amended versions of
the tradition.
Pellegrini says the activities
during the Zete's hell week are
humorous in nature. Pledge
duties include answering the
phone before it rings three times,
wearing underwear backwards
and serving dinner to the big
brothers. The penalty for dis
obedience is to sing a song or tell
a joke at dinner.
Hell "week" at the KA house
lasts about three days. The
pledges do all the work at the
house so the actives can rest, ac
cording to Truex.
Other frats, such as SAE and
Phi Delta Theta (Phi Delt), have a
wild scavengerhunt a few nights
before the initiation. The SAE
pledges are issued a "mystic
scroll" with directions that in
struct them to go to San Fran
cisco to collect things. Connelly
claims that sometimes they must
bring back people, like an Avis
rent-a-car girl, before they return
to campus the next morning.

The initiation ceremonies,
which occur in late fall quarter
through early spring, usually in
volve a'.umni and are composed
of secret rituals, confidential
handshakes and other special
traditions.
Johnson says his frat is "low
key " and does not have much of
the "bullshit ritual." He claims
that tlie only ceremony at his in
itiation involved "a guy in a
jockstrap and a cape reading
from 'The Ritual' (Theta Xi
handbook) to his drunken
fraternity brothers."
Another member of Theta Xi,
Joel Kohn, claims that "the altar
and all the other paraphernalia
in the secret chapter room,
where initiations were held, was
sold lor a keg of beer" in the late
19605.
I'he Phi Delts still use their
altar to support the Bible during
the ceremony. The KA initiation
is held in a local church and in
volves special regalia. Other
fraternities will not divulge any
information about their secret
initiation ceremonies.
Most pledges must pay a fee to
the national organization before
they become active members of
the frat but the Phi Delt house
pays the fee for its initiates. The
initiation fees are substantial; for
example, a Theta Xi pledge pays
$125 and the cost at SAE is $100.
However, not all men who
pledge a fraternity become ac
tive members.
An article in the September,
1970 issue ofFraternity Monthly
states that "so many pledges
never make it to initia
tion . . . because we're still play
ing games with them and they
have better things to do,"
Tim Ferguson, former IFC
rush chairman, states at Stanford
"it is unusual for a house to lose
more than one or two pledges."
"The Fraternity and the Col
lege," a book published in 1931,
states that fraternity initiation
rites sometimes included
"painting the body of the victim,
torturing him with electrical
horrors, feeding him nauseating
messes, and beating him up to
see how much pain he could
stand."
Fortunately, the group of
about 250 students who became
pledges for the 13 men's social
fraternities on campus last
spring did not have to look for
ward to such activities. How
ever, every house has its own
mysterious and ritualistic tradi
tions that the pledge experiences
before he becomes an active
member of the organization.
At Theta Xi when a student
accepts his bid, a invitation to
join the frat, he is "strongly
urged to chug a litre of a bever
age of his choice," says Rich
Johnson, last year's rush chair
man.
The first duty the pledges are
assigned at other houses, like
Zeta Fsi (Zete) and Delta Upsilon
(DLJ) is to put on a big party, usu
ally a luau, for the fraternity.
Illicit activities
Last year DU pledges were in
charge of the tropical decor for
the party. Gathering the bamboo,
palm fronds, and flowers "en
tailed many illicit activities,"
according to one member.
Ron Pellegrini, a past presi
dent of Zete Fsi, says pledges are
told to "stay out of trouble"
when getting the'props for the
Hawiian jungle but there is al
ways the "implication of steal
ing since other people have done
it." Spring quarter two years ago
the police caught one Zete while
he was swiping a huge banana
sign from a record store. This
past spring three pledges were

arrested in connection with the
theft of torches from a restaurant.

fraternities will not divulge any
information about their secret
initiation ceremonies.
Most pledges must pay a fee to
the national organization before
they become active members of
the frat but the Phi Delt house
pays the fee for its initiates. The
initiation fees are substantial; for
example, a Theta Xi pledge pays
$125 and the cost at SAE is $100.
However, not all men who
pledge a fraternity become ac
tive members.
An article in the September,
1970 issue ofFraternity Monthly
states that "so many pledges
never make it to initia
tion . . . because we're still play
ing games with them and they
have better things to do,"
Tim Ferguson, former IFC
rush chairman, states at Stanford
"it is unusual for a house to lose
more than one or two pledges."
