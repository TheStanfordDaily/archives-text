# No wine equals no sunshine...
## Justine's offers fine, flashy French food

Justine's, 625 El Camino Real, Polo
Alto.
The Holiday Inn of Palo Alto offers
more than just a bed to sleep in. A large
room decorated with mirrors, chan
deliers, drapes hanging from a high ceil
ing, white tablecloths and a fresh carna
tion on every table set the scene for the
French restaurant Chez Justine. The re
staurant's motto, translated from the
French, reads, "A meal without wine is
like a day without sunshine." The choice
of French delicacies follows on the
menu.
Heading the menu are I.us Suggestions
Du Chef (appetizers), including scampi,
smoked salmon, Pate, Escargots, CoquiJies
St. /acques and more. Each costs around
$:i.
Potages (soups) come next with three
alternatives to the soupe du jour, which
comes included with the entree. My
guest tried the vichyssoise, which was
naturally cold, and was of the creamy,
without-chunks-of-potato variety. It
wasn't bad, but both ot us have tasted
better. I tried the soupe du jour. It too was

good, but not exceptional.
Instead of the dinner salad which also
comes included with the entree, we or
dered the spinach salad for two ($5). It is
prepared at a tableside cooking station
with flames from the pan that make quite
a show. The dressing is prepared while
the bacon cooks and is then poured over
the fresh spinach. The result is a good
salad, though again, I've had it similarly
prepared with a more pleasing result.
Tht; dressing here was just missing that
something extra. Chez Justine also offers
a hearts of palm salad, Caesar salad and a
mushroom salad for two.
Entrees are hest
The main dishes are definitely the
strong point of this restaurant. Both of
our selections were very well prepared.
The menu lists five fish dishes including
abalone (sautee GrenobJuise), fresh trout
(Piemontaise), Dover sole (Belle
Meuniere) and others. Inese dishes run
from $7.50 to $8.50.
The entrees include such French
specialties as Grenouilies a In Proven
role (hog legs), rack of lamb (for two),
Long Island duckling, veal points,

sweetbreads. Coq ciu V'in and both
Tournudos and Entrecote de Boeuf. I or
dered the Escalope de Veau, Antoine
Creme (Veal Scallopine in cream sauce).
The service includes a cute trick of pre
senting the entree in a serving dish for
your inspection before transferring it to
your plate. 1 hen the sauce is ladeled over
the top. Both the veal itselfand thecrearn
sauce were very well done and combined
to make a most enjoyable flavor.
My guest tried the Entrecote de Boeuf,
au Poivre Vert (New York steak with a
pepper sauce). Again, the beef was
cooked as ordered and the sauce added a
very nice flavor, neither overwhelming
nor too weak. The pepper flavor was sub
tle. and came through as a very nice
complement to the good flavor of the
beef.
Naturally a restaurant with a motto
about wine and dinner must offer an ex
tensive wine list. Chez Justine's wine list
sets no record for length, but it does have
a lair amount ol interesting literature
about wines to make the selection pro
cess a little more interesting.
For dessert we declined the thought of

chocolate souffle with a Grand Marnier
sauce, strawberries romanoff. chocolate
mousse, creme caramel, etc. Instead we
decided to go all out with the Crepe
Suzette (for two â€” $6). This is also pre
pared at a tableside station, with an
orange and brandy sauce flaming now
and again for a touch of the dramatic. In
the end, the crepes were good, sweet,
orange flavored, but we both wondered if
the show wasn't better than the product.
On the whole, we would probably
have been best off to stick with thesoupe
du jour and the dinner salad, leaving
plenty of room for the delicious entrees
(which range in price from $7.25 to $9, or
$20 to $22 for the entrees "for two").
Another factor in staying away from the
numerous side dishes is that the service
is slow. Granted, when eating a gourmet
meal one requires time to fully enjoy the
flavor, but we often felt we were just
plain sitting and waiting. The atmos
phere is elegant, but does not have the
small scale intimacy one expects of a
French restaurant. But Chez Justine does
offer very good entrees in the French
tradition, and you do have to pay for it.
