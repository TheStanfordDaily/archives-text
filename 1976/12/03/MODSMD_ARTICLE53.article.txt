The Winery, 2391 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto.
Are you tired of sorry
spaghetti, putrid pizza, mangled
meatloaf, plastic trays and paper
cups? And do you sometimes
wonder if there is any relief in
sight? Well, this campus can
spell relief T-H-E W-l-N-E-R-Y.
The Winery serves lunch and
dinner Monday through Friday
from 11:30 on, and the bar is
open until 2 a.m. Saturday and
Sunday dinner is served from 5
p.m. on (no, lunches on
weekends). The Winery pre
pares a fine selection of steaks,
prime rib and seafood.
We decided to dine on a
Thursday evening at about 7
p.m. and upon arrival were sea
ted immediately. But don't ex
pect to be seated upon arrival on
a Friday or Saturday night be
cause this is a fairly popular re
staurant in the Palo Alto area. If
you want to drown your sorrows
after a hard week of finals, spirits
are served in the lounge. A small
combo plays nightly.
After sipping a few cocktails,
the waiter brought our menus.
Entrees included top sirloin
($5.75), prime rib ($5.75), and
king crab legs ($7.95) as well as a
selection of international
specialities. We decided to order
the Wineinasters Cut Top Sirloin
(1 lb., $8.95)' and sirloin with
BBQ shrimp ($7.25). Dinners in

elude salad bar, french bread and
wine. Side dishes such as baked
potato (50 cents) or artichoke
($1.00) were available.
While wandering to the salad
bar we managed to catch a
glimpse of the restaurant. After
it's name, The Winery has a wine
cellar-like atmosphere.
Candlelight and private booths
add to the romantic atmosphere.
We created large scrumptious
salads at the salad bar. There was
a wide variety of vegetables and
dressings. Our entrees arrived
with a carafe of wine. The por
tions were applicable to a wo
man's appetite but were not
large enough for a hungry man.
The steaks were not cooked to
perfection but were flavorful,
and the BBQ shrimp was excel
lent! A baked potato makes the
course a well rounded meal.
After tipping our wine glasses a
final time the waiter asked if we
cared for dessert. We ordered
cheese cake (75 cents) and
chocolate bavarian (75 cents).
Both desserts were quite good.
The Winery is one of the most
popular dining spots in Palo
Alto. If you want to take your
honey out to a nice meal, the
Winery receives our seal of ap
proval. So, next time you get the
Stanford Food Service down
and-outs, spell relief with T-H-E
W-l-N-E-R-Y.

The Winery, 2391 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto.
Are you tired of sorry
spaghetti, putrid pizza, mangled
meatloaf, plastic trays and paper
cups? And do you sometimes
wonder if there is any relief in
sight? Well, this campus can
spell relief T-H-E W-l-N-E-R-Y.
The Winery serves lunch and
dinner Monday through Friday
from 11:30 on, and the bar is
open until 2 a.m. Saturday and
Sunday dinner is served from 5
p.m. on (no, lunches on
weekends). The Winery pre
pares a fine selection of steaks,
prime rib and seafood.
We decided to dine on a
Thursday evening at about 7
p.m. and upon arrival were sea
ted immediately. But don't ex
pect to be seated upon arrival on
a Friday or Saturday night be
cause this is a fairly popular re
staurant in the Palo Alto area. If
you want to drown your sorrows
after a hard week of finals, spirits
are served in the lounge. A small
combo plays nightly.
After sipping a few cocktails,
the waiter brought our menus.
Entrees included top sirloin
($5.75), prime rib ($5.75), and
king crab legs ($7.95) as well as a
selection of international
specialities. We decided to order
the Wineinasters Cut Top Sirloin
(1 lb., $8.95)' and sirloin with
BBQ shrimp ($7.25). Dinners in

elude salad bar, french bread and
wine. Side dishes such as baked
potato (50 cents) or artichoke
($1.00) were available.
While wandering to the salad
bar we managed to catch a
glimpse of the restaurant. After
it's name, The Winery has a wine
cellar-like atmosphere.
Candlelight and private booths
add to the romantic atmosphere.
We created large scrumptious
salads at the salad bar. There was
a wide variety of vegetables and
dressings. Our entrees arrived
with a carafe of wine. The por
tions were applicable to a wo
man's appetite but were not
large enough for a hungry man.
The steaks were not cooked to
perfection but were flavorful,
and the BBQ shrimp was excel
lent! A baked potato makes the
course a well rounded meal.
After tipping our wine glasses a
final time the waiter asked if we
cared for dessert. We ordered
cheese cake (75 cents) and
chocolate bavarian (75 cents).
Both desserts were quite good.
The Winery is one of the most
popular dining spots in Palo
Alto. If you want to take your
honey out to a nice meal, the
Winery receives our seal of ap
proval. So, next time you get the
Stanford Food Service down
and-outs, spell relief with T-H-E
