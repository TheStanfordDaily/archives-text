## Mike Bratz' 30 points leads Stanford past Santa Clara Talented USF hosts Cardinals 
### David Georgette 
"We play the NBA expansion
team Saturday!" shouted Stan
ford forward Kimberly Belton, in
the joyous Cardinal locker room
Wednesday night, after Belton
and his teammates had defeated
Santa Clara, 87-84.
Having just won their first col
legiate game of the season, one
might think the Cards would
savor the triumph over the
Broncs a little bit longer. At
least, coach Dick Dißiaso did.
Dißiaso told reporters he was
going to enjoy the victory before
planning for the Cards' next
opponent — the 12th ranked

University of San Francisco at
the Dons' Memorial Gym
nasium tomorrow at 8:00 p.m.
(KZSU 90.1 KM).
Solid roster
It is not difficult to understand
Dißiaso's rationale. Dwelling
too much on the Dons' roster can
sour the taste of victory very eas
ily.
USF features three imposing
sophomores — center Bill
Cartwright (6-foot-llVa, 235)
from Elk Grove, forward James
Hardy (6-8, 210) from Long
Beach, and guard Winfred
Boynes (6-6, 186) from Ok
lahoma City.

USF coach Bob Gail lard has
used three quality performers at
the other guard slot — senior
Allen Thompson, junior Rod
Williams and transfer Chubby
Cox.
'Awesome talent'
"Obviously, USF has awe
some talent," said Dißiaso.
"They can go 12 deep without a
drop off in talent. It would take
an NBA team to match up to their
front line."
Last year when the Dons came
down the Maples Pavilion, the
Cards used a slow-down offense
to take an early lead, only to miss
opportunities late in the game

and lose, 49-44.
This season the USF is 3-0,
dropping San Francisco State in
its opener, 125-81. Since then,
the Dons heat UC-Santa Barbara
in overtime, 92-85, and UC-
Davis, 120-71.
Stanford will need a strong de
fensive performance to keep the
Dons from hurrying the Cards
right out of the game. "They try
to get you running with them,"
said guard Mike Bratz. When
USF runs, they score.
Pressing defense
The Cards, then, will probably
try to slow down the pace of the
game. Against the Broncos, they
came out pressing. "We opened
with the press, " Dißiaso said,
"to get our players emotional."
The emotion showed — Bel
ton often exhorted oil his team
mates, the Cards dove for loose
balls and sophomore guard
Wolfe Perry cleared the scorer's
table as he flew after a pass.
Stanford overcame a seven
point Santa Clara lead with
seven minutes to go in the first
half, to take a 44-42 lead into the
locker room.
Slam dunks
Bratz scored 18 of his game
high 30 points in the first half,
hitting on 66 per cent on from
the floor, including two slam
dunks.
"I just knew I better not miss,"
said Bratz of his stuffs. "I'm sur
prised I scored that many. They
were overplaying our guys and
we were able to penetrate."
In the second half, the Cards
continued to get inside, hitting
on nine lay-ins. They extended a
68-62 lead, with nine minutes to
play, to 76-68 with under five to
go. The closest the Broncos got
after that was three points.

"We beat ourselves on the free
throw line and the boards,"
lamented Santa Clara head
coach Carroll Williams. "We
caused our own problems with
their zone. 1 didn't think we got
after it out there."
Does Caillard anticipate more
of the same from the Cards to
morrow? "1 expect to see an ex
cellent group of cheerleaders,"
he said after watching the game.
"Stanford should play with a lot
more confidence. They got a
super job from Bratz and they
boarded the hell out of Santa
Clara."
After the game, Dißiaso said.
"Emotion was the key to every
thing tonight. We kept out emo
tional level up. We were not to he
denied."
Unfortunately, tomorrow it
will take a lot more than emotion
against USF.

least, coach Dick Dißiaso did.
Dißiaso told reporters he was
going to enjoy the victory before
planning for the Cards' next
opponent — the 12th ranked

University of San Francisco at
the Dons' Memorial Gym
nasium tomorrow at 8:00 p.m.
(KZSU 90.1 KM).
Solid roster
It is not difficult to understand
Dißiaso's rationale. Dwelling
too much on the Dons' roster can
sour the taste of victory very eas
ily.
USF features three imposing
sophomores — center Bill
Cartwright (6-foot-llVa, 235)
from Elk Grove, forward James
Hardy (6-8, 210) from Long
Beach, and guard Winfred
Boynes (6-6, 186) from Ok
lahoma City.

USF coach Bob Gail lard has
used three quality performers at
the other guard slot — senior
Allen Thompson, junior Rod
Williams and transfer Chubby
Cox.
'Awesome talent'
"Obviously, USF has awe
some talent," said Dißiaso.
"They can go 12 deep without a
drop off in talent. It would take
an NBA team to match up to their
front line."
Last year when the Dons came
down the Maples Pavilion, the
Cards used a slow-down offense
to take an early lead, only to miss
opportunities late in the game

and lose, 49-44.
This season the USF is 3-0,
dropping San Francisco State in
its opener, 125-81. Since then,
the Dons heat UC-Santa Barbara
in overtime, 92-85, and UC-
Davis, 120-71.
Stanford will need a strong de
fensive performance to keep the
Dons from hurrying the Cards
right out of the game. "They try
to get you running with them,"
said guard Mike Bratz. When
USF runs, they score.
Pressing defense
The Cards, then, will probably
try to slow down the pace of the
game. Against the Broncos, they
came out pressing. "We opened
with the press, " Dißiaso said,
"to get our players emotional."
The emotion showed — Bel
ton often exhorted oil his team
mates, the Cards dove for loose
balls and sophomore guard
Wolfe Perry cleared the scorer's
table as he flew after a pass.
Stanford overcame a seven
point Santa Clara lead with
seven minutes to go in the first
half, to take a 44-42 lead into the
locker room.
Slam dunks
Bratz scored 18 of his game
high 30 points in the first half,
hitting on 66 per cent on from
the floor, including two slam
dunks.
"I just knew I better not miss,"
said Bratz of his stuffs. "I'm sur
prised I scored that many. They
were overplaying our guys and
we were able to penetrate."
In the second half, the Cards
continued to get inside, hitting
on nine lay-ins. They extended a
68-62 lead, with nine minutes to
play, to 76-68 with under five to
go. The closest the Broncos got
after that was three points.

"We beat ourselves on the free
throw line and the boards,"
lamented Santa Clara head
coach Carroll Williams. "We
caused our own problems with
their zone. 1 didn't think we got
after it out there."
Does Caillard anticipate more
of the same from the Cards to
morrow? "1 expect to see an ex
cellent group of cheerleaders,"
he said after watching the game.
"Stanford should play with a lot
more confidence. They got a
super job from Bratz and they
boarded the hell out of Santa
Clara."
After the game, Dißiaso said.
"Emotion was the key to every
thing tonight. We kept out emo
tional level up. We were not to he
denied."
Unfortunately, tomorrow it
will take a lot more than emotion
against USF.
"We play the NBA expansion
team Saturday!" shouted Stan
ford forward Kimberly Belton, in
the joyous Cardinal locker room
Wednesday night, after Belton
and his teammates had defeated
Santa Clara, 87-84.
Having just won their first col
legiate game of the season, one
might think the Cards would
savor the triumph over the
Broncs a little bit longer. At
least, coach Dick Dißiaso did.
