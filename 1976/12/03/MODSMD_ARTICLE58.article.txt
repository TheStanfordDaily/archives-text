# Women cagers down Broncos
## 
### Dean Eyre 
In referring to Wednesday night's season
opener for women's basketball, coach Dotty
McCrea said, "1 just hope we do well." The Stan
ford women could hardly have done better in
handling their first-year coach a 65-32 win over
Santa Clara.
"It's nice to win our first timeout," said McCrea
after her Cardinal coaching debut. She added that
the contest was a learning experience.
The Broncos threw up a tough defense, she ad
ded. "We need to work against the pressing de
fense," said McCrea. "The team will have to ad
just to the transition of the game."
'Fundamentals'
Part of the change will involve learning "cer
tain fundamentals to break the press," especially
stressing the need to pass the ball. In explaining
that the women were inexperienced in facing a
pressing defense, but did react well to the pres
sure, she said, "At least they didn't try to dribble
through."
For a season opening performance, the team
played very well, considering that it is a compara
tively young squad. Two Card starters, guard
Peg Chutich and forward Betsy Lough, are
freshmen. Two of the remaining starters are

sophomores, including returning letter-winner
Stephanie Galef and forward Peggy Bruggman.
Rounding out the starting five is center Maggie
Nelson, considered "one of the better centers in
California," according to McCrea.
Leading scorer
In Wednesday's contest, Chutich led Stanford
with 17 points. In her first collegiate basketball
game, she was six for 10 from the floor.
Nelson added 14 points for the Cards. Sopho
more Kim Lew, 6-foot-0, was the leading rebouri
der, with 10.
"I'm always optimistic about every win.
They've improved so much in the last month,
they could improve twice that in two months. I
hope it works that way."
Looking ahead to NCIAC competition next
month shesaid, "It's hard to tell. I think we'll have
more competition in the (Stanislaus State) tour
nament. Santa Clara came out the second half and
played much better."
The cagers travel to the Stanislaus State tour
nament this weekend. The Cards meet De Anza in
the opening round at 1 p.m. today.
The game between the Cards and the University
of Mexico originally scheduled for next Friday
(Dec. 10) has been cancelled.

Part of the change will involve learning "cer
tain fundamentals to break the press," especially
stressing the need to pass the ball. In explaining
that the women were inexperienced in facing a
pressing defense, but did react well to the pres
sure, she said, "At least they didn't try to dribble
through."
For a season opening performance, the team
played very well, considering that it is a compara
tively young squad. Two Card starters, guard
Peg Chutich and forward Betsy Lough, are
freshmen. Two of the remaining starters are

sophomores, including returning letter-winner
Stephanie Galef and forward Peggy Bruggman.
Rounding out the starting five is center Maggie
Nelson, considered "one of the better centers in
California," according to McCrea.
Leading scorer
In Wednesday's contest, Chutich led Stanford
with 17 points. In her first collegiate basketball
game, she was six for 10 from the floor.
Nelson added 14 points for the Cards. Sopho
more Kim Lew, 6-foot-0, was the leading rebouri
der, with 10.
"I'm always optimistic about every win.
They've improved so much in the last month,
they could improve twice that in two months. I
hope it works that way."
Looking ahead to NCIAC competition next
month shesaid, "It's hard to tell. I think we'll have
more competition in the (Stanislaus State) tour
nament. Santa Clara came out the second half and
played much better."
The cagers travel to the Stanislaus State tour
nament this weekend. The Cards meet De Anza in
the opening round at 1 p.m. today.
The game between the Cards and the University
of Mexico originally scheduled for next Friday
(Dec. 10) has been cancelled.
