### Jim Tranquada 
The ASSIJ Speakers' Bureau con
tinues to be beset by problems.
The inadvertent overpayment of
$13,500 to the American Program
Bureau, acting as agents for former
British Prime Minister Harold Wilson,
by the Speakers' Bureau has still not
been refunded, despite "a promised
check by the second week of
November," according to Ted Mitch
ell, director of the Speakers' Bureau.
And now Wilson's scheduled ap
pearance as a guest speaker here this
May has been cancelled.
"I received the official notification
through the mail last Tuesday (Nov.
23) that political circumstances in En
gland will not allow Sir I larold Wilson
to appear in America during the
academic year 1976-1977," said
Mitchell.
Mitchell said the next day he read in
Herb Caen's San Francisco Chronicle
column that Wilson had been booked
at a total of 16 colleges by the Ameri
can Program Bureau without prior
contact with Wilson.
Caen's column on Nov. 24 reported
that Wilson had been booked at Col
lege of Marin and 15 other colleges by
a "respected booking agency" which
"neglected to check with him first".
Caen quoted Wilson as saying. "1 have
no intention of spending the winter in
America."
Mitchell explained that "there is a
clause in everv contract that savs that

any person actively involved in a polit
ical job will appear only if political
considerations will allow it." The
deadline for cancelling the contract
(signed Sept. 19) was last Wednesday,
according to Mitchell.
Mitchell stated he called the Ameri
can Program Bureau yesterday, and
was told that the agent involved would
take the refund check personally to the
vice president of the bureau and have
him sign it. Mitchell said he is "very
confident" that the check will arrive
here soon.
The refunded money will be applied
toward the speaking fees of new
speakers, he sai^l.
