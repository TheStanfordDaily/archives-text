# IM grid crowns at stake Sunday
## 
### Bill Wernecke 
A cast of thousands will wrap up the
IM touch football season with a wild
weekend of playoff action starting this
afternoon. The 'B' leagueand co-ed semi
final games will be held on fields one and
two at 3 and 4 today.
Finals are scheduled for Sunday after
noon on IM field nine next to deCuerre
Pools. The 'A' championship begins at 1
p.m., followed by the 'B' league and
co-ed finals at 2 and 3 p.m. respectively.
In the 'A' league finals, the powerful
Zete I squad meets the Dlls. The Zetes
continued their strong offensive play
with a 26-2 victory over a heavily
favored Biz II squad.
Two platoons
The Zetes have a full two-platoon
squad, with only four players missing
from last year's champions. They are big
and look bigger in their yellow jerseys,
and have won every game by at least two
TDs.
QB Rusty Duquette likes to throw to Jim
and Joe Erickson and KC Royals AAA
baseball pitcher Lew Olson.
The DUs never practice, and have only
nine players. QB Tom Gordon sends out
receivers Sam Haugh, Mark Whiting,
and Mike Nugent; the four also make up
an outstanding defensive backfield.
In last year's playoffs, Gordon was in
jured and the Zetes won 20-7. This time
could be tougher if Gordon gets hot. Look
for a role reversal with ex-catcher
Duquette pitching strikes to center Olson
and the brothers Erickson. Only a super
game by the DIJ defense can stop a Zete
repeat.
Semifinal
In one *B' semifinal game today, the
Cinderella Best of Organized Grime team

meets Los Arcos I. The Best advanced
with a 7-6 squeaker over Med 11, while
Arcos won their third straight one-TD
decision, with a bit 18-13 upset over the
No. 4 Blokes.
The Best was the only playoff team to
lose two regular-season games, but has
given up only three TDs in four playoff
encounters, due to the inspirational
leadership of middle linebacker Mike
Kositch. QB Kevin Triggs makes up the
plays in the huddle and likes to throw to
favorite target Charlie Lannin.
Los Arcos I has survived three close
playoff games due to the "Scottish Con
nection" of Joe McCoy to Terry McCar
tin. McCoy throws extremely well on
roll-outs to either side, picking out his
top receivers Rodney White and McCar
tin. Don Pena gives McCoy plenty of
time, playing as a one-man offensive
line.
BSU
In the other semifinal, BSU I plays the
Zete 11 team. BSU advanced by upsetting
second seeded JRA 81112-6, while third
ranked Zetes came back from a 7-0 deficit
to trim Da Buds 18-7.
BSU's offensive and defensive lines
feature two 240-pound giants, A 1 Perry
and Tommy Myers. Second-string QB
Rick Turner likes to hit Orlando Mayes
and running back Larry "Chee" Brous
sard. Turner and Andre Harris anchor
the defense.
The Zetes counter with four tennis
players, a plethora of sophomore
pledges, and a team weight that barely
matches the Perry-Myers duo.
Relying on their quickness and the
passing of Shaun kirshner, they have av
eraged three TDs per playoff contest and
have won all of their eight games by big

margins.
Los Arcos should advance to the finals
in a low-scoring contest unless the Best
can burn them early and pull another
upset. The BSU-Zete game is a toss
upâ€”BSU has a sizeable advantage but
goes with a less-experienced QB. Unless
they beat each other up, however, bet on
the winner of that game to take Los Ar
cos.
Soto and JRA CII will meet in one co-ed
semifinal, and there should be some of
fensive fireworks. Soto is averaging 40
points per game as QB Corky Davis has
hit "Too-Tall" Bill Maloney for 15 TDs.
Davis is also a great scrambler and likes
to make passes at "Big Al" Carpenter for
extra points.
All-star duo
To win, though, Soto must stop JRA
Cll's all-star QB combination of Keith
Nakada and Diane Sheng. Now that his
'B' team is out of action, Nakada can con
centrate on his patented long runs and
pinpoint passing to CEgrads "Fritz" Yee
and "Rabbit" Wohlhaupter.
The other co-ed semifinal will feature
ZAP versus annual co-ed powerhouse
Los Arcos. ZAP is a mystery team which
never practices and which won its two
playoff games by one point each on
last-minute bombs to Jack Joseph. They
use a new QB each week, play several
100-pound women on the line, and ob
tain inspiration from Jim "Iron Man"
Mulready, who tosses aside his crutches
each week to play.
Los Arcos has much the same cast of
characters as their powerful 'B' squad
and last year's co-ed runnerups. The
major difference is that QB Duane Davis
now does the throwing to McCartin and
White.
