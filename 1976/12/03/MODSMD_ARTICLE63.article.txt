Former Stanford star John
Hencken, gold medalist in the
'72 and '76 Olympics, will com

Stanford swim coach Jim
Gaughran said, "The meet is a
development meet. We're not
keeping team scores, just times."
"The kids are really excited
about the meet," assistant coach
Debbie Meyer said. "They're an
xious to see how well they are
doing. We're getting close to the
point in the season when we do
the heaviest training, and they
want to see just where they stand
now."
Outlook
While the Card women have
two meets behind them already
this quarter, the Stanford men
are competing for the first time
this season. Here's a look at some
of Stanford's top swimmers this
year:
Bob Hagberg (Fr., fly) — A top
national high school All-

America butterflier. He entered
Stanford with a time of 49.1 in
the 100 fly, the fastest in Stan
ford's history.
Tom O'Brien (Fr., middle dis
tance free) — A high school
All-America in the 200 and 500
free, he is predicted to be a valu
able contributor in Stanford's
bid for the NCAAs. He currently
holds the fastest time in the 400
IM (4:08.0) on the team.
Stu Corliss (Jr., breast) — A
co-captain of this year's squad,
he is a rapidly improving
swimmer. Last year he was an
All-America in the 100 breast.
Valerie Lee (Fr., fly/free) —
Current holder of the American
record in the 200 yard fly
(2:00.70), she is a versatile dis
tance free and butterfly swim
mer.
National finalist
Anne Brodell (Jr., free) — Last
year she was an AIAW Nationals
finalist in the 200 and 500 free.
This year she'll be able to com
pete at the distances she swims
best — the 800 and 1650 free —
since these events were recently
added to collegiate women's
competition.
Jo Harshbarger (So., distance
free) — A member of the '72
Olympic team, placing eighth in
the 800 meter free, she currently
holds Stanford's varsity record
in the 500 free (4:56.32). Gaug
hran says she'll be tough to beat
this season in the 1650 free.
As the Invitational has not set
a limit to the number of events
each swimmer may enter, there
will be a minimum of six heats in
each event, with the top swim
mers in the final heat.
"The team has been working
fairly hard," said Gaughran. "I
think that some of the nation's
best times in collegiate swim
ming this season will be made
this weekend."
