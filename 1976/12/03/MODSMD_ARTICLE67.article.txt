Steeii prices raised to beat controls?
Washington — The Council of Wage and Price Stability
said yesterday it is concerned that steel companies are
try.ng to "jump the gun" on possible wage and price
controls by raising prices now.
But the council said the purported strategy might
backfire by forcing other companies to raise prices and
creating "an environment winch would invite the very
kind of government behavior that business seeks to av
oid."
Democratic Rep. William Moorehead of Pennsylvania,
who said his House subcommittee will investigate the
increases, voiced a similar conclusion. Industry officials
have r< peatedly denied such motivation.
Meanwhile, the press spokesman for President-elect
Jimmy C «iur, who has advocated standby authority to
impose economic controls in an emergency, said Carter
has exhausted the avenues open to him in trying to per
suade ihe companies to rescind the increases.

Steeii prices raised to beat controls?
Washington — The Council of Wage and Price Stability
said yesterday it is concerned that steel companies are
try.ng to "jump the gun" on possible wage and price
controls by raising prices now.
But the council said the purported strategy might
backfire by forcing other companies to raise prices and
creating "an environment winch would invite the very
kind of government behavior that business seeks to av
oid."
Democratic Rep. William Moorehead of Pennsylvania,
who said his House subcommittee will investigate the
increases, voiced a similar conclusion. Industry officials
have r< peatedly denied such motivation.
Meanwhile, the press spokesman for President-elect
Jimmy C «iur, who has advocated standby authority to
impose economic controls in an emergency, said Carter
has exhausted the avenues open to him in trying to per
suade ihe companies to rescind the increases.
