# Students still majoring in job- oriented departments
## 
### Emily Sachar Staff writer 
Students here are continuing to
flock to job-oriented majors like
economics, engineering and earth sci
ences, according to Bob Hamrdla, di
rector of the Academic Information
Center.
Economics is now the favorite un
dergraduate major with 400 students,
the same number as last year, while
engineering majors have risen from
249 to 563, doubling over the past
three years. Undergraduate majors in
earth sciences have almost doubled in
the same period, from 53 to 100.
"In the case of earth sciences,
though, doubling sounds dramatic,
but since there are few students to

begin with, these increases are not as
astounding," Hamrdla said.
The number of women in earth sci
ences increased sharply, from 14 to 37,
while those majoring in engineering
climbed even faster, from 22 to 101.
"The reasons for these increases are
much the same as they were several
years ago," Hamrdla said. "Certain
schools, like the business school, used
to be out-of-fashion, whereas now they
have become highly respectable."
Although there is switching within
the top seven majors, student choices
still come in the same general areas,
according to Hamrdla.
"Majors vary in a cyclical fashion,
going back and forth from year to
year," Hamrdla said.

After economics, biological sciences
takes second place with 384 majors,
followed by human biology with 245
majors, an increase of 16 over last year.
Psychology, history and English rank
fourth, fifth, and sixth respectively.
Changes in the number of majors in
political science, communication,
chemistry and art were relatively
small.
Studies of incoming freshmen show
a 16.1 per cent decline in interest in
medicine, while interest in engineer
ing has almost doubled since 1972.
Another area of increase has been
among foreign student enrollment, ris
ing over 14 percent, from 1429 to 1634
students, according to Lee Zeigler. di
