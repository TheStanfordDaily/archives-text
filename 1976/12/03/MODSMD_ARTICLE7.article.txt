# Faculty panel: move program from Cliveden
## 
### Kath Scanlon 
The Committee on Foreign Study
Programs has recommended that the
Stanford program in England be
moved from Cliveden to either Oxford
or London when the present lease at
Cliveden expires in December 1978.
The faculty senate's committee,
chaired by Sociology Prof. James
March, also recommended to the Fa
culty Senate yesterday the creation of a
new undergraduate study program in
either Mexico City or another
Hispanic-language location.
According to Corb Smith, assistant
director of Overseas Studies, if the
university adopts the structure of
programs the committee recommends,
it will reduce the general fund support
of overseas study to about $925,000
annually. Ceneral fund expenditures
must be cut to $650,000 by Sept. 1,
1978.
Smith explained, "The committee
felt that (the program in England)
might be cheaper in Oxford or Lon
don." Smith said, however, that recent
information indicates Oxford or Lon
don with fewer students might he
more expensive.
"But other things were considered.
The committee felt that the other loca
tions offered more cultural and social
resources," Smith said.
What will go
"It hasn't been decided whether
there's going to be a program in
Mexico, whether the program in

Cliveden will continue, or whether
there will be a program in England at
all. The decision-making structure is
not all that clearly defined."
Smith says the decision will ulti
mately he made by the Faculty Senate,
the Committee on Foreign Study Frog
rams. the Overseas Studies Office and
the Provost's Office
"The committee refused to choose
Inst year between Mexico and Clive
den," he said.
Berlin closing
The Stanford campus in Merlin will
close at the end of Spring Quarter,
eliminating 50 student quarters, each
equivalent to one person studying
abroad for three months.
"The only way (the program in Her
lin) could be retained is if we were to
trade off one of the other programs or
were to get a substantial amount
$80.000-100,000 — to support it." said
Smith.
Cost-cutting measures such as the
discontinuation of major field trips at
overseas locations, except in Italy, the
elimination of one staff position and
the elimination ot Resident Assistants
at overseas locations have been under
taken, says Smith.
"The Resident Assistant was sort of
a junior administrator on campus. He
was like .in R.A. here — he acted as a
counselor, an information center Mis
functions have been taken over by
local staff," commented Smith.

"But other things were considered.
The committee felt that the other loca
tions offered more cultural and social
resources," Smith said.
What will go
"It hasn't been decided whether
there's going to be a program in
Mexico, whether the program in

Cliveden will continue, or whether
there will be a program in England at
all. The decision-making structure is
not all that clearly defined."
Smith says the decision will ulti
mately he made by the Faculty Senate,
the Committee on Foreign Study Frog
rams. the Overseas Studies Office and
the Provost's Office
"The committee refused to choose
Inst year between Mexico and Clive
den," he said.
Berlin closing
The Stanford campus in Merlin will
close at the end of Spring Quarter,
eliminating 50 student quarters, each
equivalent to one person studying
abroad for three months.
"The only way (the program in Her
lin) could be retained is if we were to
trade off one of the other programs or
were to get a substantial amount
$80.000-100,000 — to support it." said
Smith.
Cost-cutting measures such as the
discontinuation of major field trips at
overseas locations, except in Italy, the
elimination of one staff position and
the elimination ot Resident Assistants
at overseas locations have been under
taken, says Smith.
"The Resident Assistant was sort of
a junior administrator on campus. He
was like .in R.A. here — he acted as a
counselor, an information center Mis
functions have been taken over by
local staff," commented Smith.
The Committee on Foreign Study
Programs has recommended that the
Stanford program in England be
moved from Cliveden to either Oxford
or London when the present lease at
Cliveden expires in December 1978.
The faculty senate's committee,
chaired by Sociology Prof. James
March, also recommended to the Fa
culty Senate yesterday the creation of a
new undergraduate study program in
either Mexico City or another
Hispanic-language location.
According to Corb Smith, assistant
director of Overseas Studies, if the
university adopts the structure of
programs the committee recommends,
it will reduce the general fund support
of overseas study to about $925,000
annually. Ceneral fund expenditures
must be cut to $650,000 by Sept. 1,
1978.
Smith explained, "The committee
felt that (the program in England)
might be cheaper in Oxford or Lon
don." Smith said, however, that recent
information indicates Oxford or Lon
don with fewer students might he
more expensive.
