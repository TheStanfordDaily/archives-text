## Opinions Tuition policy inequity not unsolvable problem 
###

For too long a time Stanford's tuition
policy has had at least one major fault:
it is inequitable. The underlying
reason for this is that everyone pays
the same amount for tuition.
The very existence of scholarships
acknowledges the fact that tuition is
inequitable because the ability of vari
ous students to pay is different, yet no
one ever seems to look at the inequity
in the quality of education different
students are getting. For example,
some students take as few as 12 units
per quarter, while other students are
taking 20 or more units per quarter, yet
everyone pays the same tuition.
Clearly this is not fair.
The obvious solution to this prob
lem is to charge students by the
number of units they are taking. In
stead of charging everyone a flat $1425
per quarter, charge $95 per unit.
Doesn't solve problem
While this approach appears to
solve the problem, a closer analysis re
veals that it really does not. First of all,
the university would run into prob
lems in collecting tuition, because
students simply do not always know at
the beginning of the quarter how many
units they will be taking.
In addition, some students miss
classes more often than others and
therefore they are not getting as good
an education as those who always at
tend class. We are back to the problem
of inequity in tuition.
To alleviate these problems, I would
like to suggest two alternatives to the
present tuition policy. The first alter
native is to have tuition rebates.
Everyone would pay for 20 units and at
the end of the quarter they would get
rebates for those units which they did
not take and for classes which they
missed.
Many advantages
This approach has many tremend
ous advantages. For example,
everyone knows that even people in

the same class do not all receive the
same quality of education. Some do
well and learn a lot while others do
poorly and do not learn very much.
Since grades are considered to be an
indication of how much a student
learns in any given class, getting an A
pays full tuition, a person getting a B
pays 80 per cent, etc. A person failing a
class obviously has not learned any
thing, so he should get a full rebate
with perhaps a service charge de
ducted.
This grade related rebate program
would also have the advantage of link
ing grade inflation to monetary infla
tion, for the more the grades went up,
the more money the university would
receive.
However, tuition rebates could be
very difficult to administer, for in
order to give rebates for classes not
attended, attendance would have to be
taken in every class. For this reason I
propose a second alternative. Instead
of giving rebates at the end of the quar
ter, simply charge admission to each
class. Everyone would pay their $9.50
as they enter the classroom.
Tickets
Or, to make life simpler, admission
could be by ticket and people could
buy 25-class tickets in advance, return
ing unused tickets for a refund at the
end of the quarter. The students could
also turn in their ticket stubs at the end
of the quarter for the rebates they are
entitled to for getting poor grades.
This plan would also have the ad
vantage of being able to compensate
for the differences in the amount
learned in different individual classes.
For example, the admission fee for a
class where no one learns anything,
such as Freshman Writing, could be
much less than for a class where stu
dents learn a great deal, such as Poli
Sci 170, Professor Horn's Constitution
class, or Psych 157, Sleep and Dreams.
This would further reduce the inequity

in tuition.
This final plan also has a tremend
ous advantage beyond making tuition
more equitable: it will make students
realize just how much they are paying
for their education. When students are
constantly being reminded that they
are paying $9.50 per class, they will be
more apt to pay attention and less
likely to sleep through class.
This would help to improve the
quality of education, for students
would pay more attention in class and
therefore learn more. And that is what
everyone is trying to do: improve the
quality of education.
