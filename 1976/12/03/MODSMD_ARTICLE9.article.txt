In a few years a new library will exist
for approximately one million vol
umes to be used by both graduates and
undergraduates. Against this new $20
million expansion, perhaps one will
feel a bit smaller, a bit more over
whelmed by the architecture which is
growing on campus in monolithic
proportions.
I.eland Stanford's wonder golden
land ofhugearcaded quadrangles with
their arched points of visual punctua
tion is being pushed farther and farther
back into the 19th century. And in the
place of architecture which meant
something, from the Grecian column
symbolic of our support of this institu
tion of learning to the Roman arch
symbolic of our "taking the yoke" in
submission to the basic norms and
values upon which this institution is
based, will be another modern struc
ture.
It will be an eminently functional
one, the technical virtuosity of which
perhaps only a student of architecture
or physics might fully appreciate. But
only the requisite red-tile roof and
buff-tan facade will remain as a sign of
architectural kinship with much of the
rest of the campus, a kinship which
reminds us of our own kinship with
one another, plant service employees,
professors and students alike. v
To speak of a golden land of arcaded
sandstone is to speak in metaphor. Yet
t he cond i tion of feel ing t he quadrangle
inspires when one is present there is
real. I. for one, feel its spaciousness
internalized. I feel a personal, un
forced intimacy with my surround
ings, as if they can convey to me, with
out my making an intellectual effort,
some open, unbound and human en
terprise — within the ' rchitectural
framework.
This is not to suggest that the entire
campus be enclosed within a single

envelope of carved sandstone. But
perhaps the kind of simple and tasteful
arches of Old Union, for example, can
be integrated into the plan of the new
library. Without some kind of embel :
lishment it may end up as the analogue
of the new Robert Moore houses which
are appreciated for their design and
the many functions they serve but,
without traditional though non
functional window shutters for exam
ple, look a little austere.
