# Administration to ask for 9.8% tuition increase
## Board of Trustees will be asked to decide Tuesday how much students will pay next year. And they will hear a report on a contract with the government of Iran. 
### Mike Charlson Staff writer 
The administration is slated to ask
the Board of Trustees to approve a tui
tion figure of $4095, an almost 10 per
cent increase over this year, and a
room and board figure of $1970, a
seven per cent increase, for the 1977-
7H academic year at the board's meet
ing next Tuesday in San Francisco.
Total costs of $6065 represents an
overall increase of nine per cent.
According to the board's agenda,
other items to be discussed include an
administration request for $325,000
for the purchase of a used IBM 370/135
computer, and a report saying the Ira
nian government has been slow in pay
ing a portion of a $978,000 contract
concerning the National Iranian Radio
and Television (NIRT). Stanford pro
vided advice in development of a
domestic communications satellite
system for telephone and educational
television, plus advice on an educa
tional television program series for
mass education.
The tuition figure represents a $420
increase over the present charge of
$4275, an increase of 9.8 per cent. The
all-time high figure is the result of a
complex series of interrelated factors,
according to the vice provost for
budget and planning, Ray Bacchetti.
Bacchetti specifically cited three

main categories which are considered
in arriving at a tuition figure: the uni
versity financial situation, a compari
son with tuition charge trends in in
stitutions of similar caliber, and the
possible effect of higher tuition costs
on the ability of the university to at
tract qualified candidates for admis
sion.
Half of operating income
He said tuition accounts for about 50
per cent of the income in the operating
budget which does not include hous
ing and auxiliary operations.
High increases in tuition, though
lower than anticipated last year, are
traced to the university's Budget
Equilibrium Flan, a program to ba
lance the budget. In addition, ex
tremely high increases in energy costs
are cited in the explanation of the
charge next year.
Bacchetti also pointed out that lib
rary costs are increasing at about twice
the rate of the consumer price index.
He called salary increases for univer
sity employes a factor as well.

Beyond these items, however, Bac
chetti said that part of the increase can
be traced to what he termed "real
growth." Basically, this refers to that
portion of the budget which is set aside
for "institutional improvements."
Above inflation rate
He said that the combination of
these factors has resulted in a tuition
rise of about 4.2 per cent above the rate
of inflation, a trend which he said
"cannot be sustained." He said that
budgetary objectives now are to bring
the combined increase of tuition, room
and board down to the growth figure in
real income.
Robert Huff, financial aids director,
reiterated the university financial aid
policy. He made it clear that admis
sions decisions are made without re
gard to financial need and that, once
admitted, the university will meet "all
demonstrated financial need."
Bacchetti is scheduled to report to
the trustees that recommended tuition
and room and board increases are in
line with those projected for similar

institutions across the country. Actual
recommendations for tuition increases
on other campuses will not be made for
some months, however, according to
him. Stanford is traditionally the first
major private institution to set costs
each year.
Board formula
The $129 room and board increase is
the result of a much easier formula,
according to Ed Scoles, housing direc
tor. He claimed that housing and food
services are run much more like a bus
iness, so that it is easier to arrive at a
figure.
He mentioned, however, that his
department's job, "is not just raise
prices to meet costs. We actively work
to hold costs down," he said.
As with tuition, a main contributor
to the cost raise was ever increasing
energy costs which Scoles projected
would rise by some 30 per cent over
the next year.
In other business, the board will
hear a report on the status of the uni
versity's NIRT contract. According to

Earl Cilley, director of sponsored pro
jects, the board will be told that the
timetable for completion of the project
has been moved up. It will now be
completed by the end of this month.
The trustees will also be told that the
Iranian government has been "a bit
slow" in reimbursing the university.
Fresently approximately $425,000 is
outstanding. â€¢
"Some concerns have been expres
sed by some people at NIRT that some
of the work isn't exactly what they
wanted," Cilley said. But he said that
the delay in payment is not an alarm
ing thing to him. He mentioned that
"business transactions between us and
most Middle Eastern nations usually
take a very long time even for the smal
lest item.
"It is not clear to me that this (the
delay) is on purpose," Cilley said, "or
if it is the result of a breakdown in
communications. We have reviewed
our work and the contract and, as far as
we can tell, we expect to meet the
terms of the work statement, and we

confidently expect that Iran's obliga
tion will be met."
Among a host of other agenda items,
the board will be asked to approve up
to $325,000 for the purchase of a used
IBM 370/135 computer to replace the
one presently being rented by tlie uni
versity.
According to Bill Yundt. associate
director for business services at Stan
ford Center for Information Proces
sing. "The current purchase of a 135 is
lowest cost option, for the short term,
for the registrar and student services
application of a computer."
In August 1974, the university sold
its IBM 370/145 computer after pur
chasing a 168 model, but it was later
found that transfer of registrar and
student service applications onto the
168, was impossible, because costs of
converting to the new computer were
too high, among other reasons, said
Yundt.
Instead, the university elected to
lease a 135 model to pick up the regis
trar's student service load. According
to Yundt, the introduction of a new
138 model by IBM, which is a more
flexible machine for about the same
cost as a 135, has resulted in a dramatic
drop in the cost of used 1355. Con
sequently, it has become financially
advantageous to purchase the 135
model, he said.
