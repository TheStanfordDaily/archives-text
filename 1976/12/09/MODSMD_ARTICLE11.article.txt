# Hearst, money and the law
## 
### 
A couple of weeks ago, San Fran
cisco Federal Judge William Orrick Jr.
ruled that Patty Hearst was not a
"flight risk," and ordered her freed on
bail.
The news media gave conflicting
reports about why she was released.
But by and large, they tended to repeat
the argument made in court by her
lawyers: Hearst was released from
prison because her safety was in peril.
Given her cooperation with her pro
secutors, other inmates might turn on
her. In fact, she bad been threatened on
several occasions.
Interestingly, neither federal offi
cials nor the warden of San Diego's
Metropolitan Correctional Center
knew of any such threats. Further
more, it does not appear that fears
about her safety were of significance in
securing her release.
Facts like these, coupled with ex
perience with legal institutions, led
some individuals to point out what
was undoubtedly true — in the final
analysis, Hearst was released for a
single reason: because her family is
rich.
Poor pay more
The fact that the poor pay more —
and the rich less — is well known,
whatever the dominant ideology, or
some symposium on the so-called
exploitation of the rich, might say.
Exploitation is not just revealed in the
"market-places" of exploitative (e.g.
capitalist) societies. One other area in
which it is revealed is that of juridico
legal institutions.
This brings us to a much broader
issue — one of fundamental impor
tance, though rarely discussed: that of
the role of law, of juridico-legal rela
tions, in capitalist society.
But before we begin to examine the
issue, perhaps we should agree on the
obvious: The United States is a mar
kedly stratified society. At its polar
ends, the society consists of the very
poor (who, as we learned in the 19605,
number in the millions) and the
"super-rich" (the Rockefellers, Fords,
Kennedy and Carnegie families, etc.).
There is no need to regurgitate the ta
bles of statistics on relative wealth and
poverty in the United States. The facts
on this matter are well known, thanks
to Mills, Domhoff, Lampman, Har
rington and others.
We may simply note that, no matter
what index one chooses — real estate,
bonds, corporate stock, cash, miscel
laneous property, mortgages and
notes, etc. — there is a markedly
skewed distribution of wealth in this
society. And the best indicator of the
amount of wealth and "status" one
will achieve is not "talent," "drive,"
"ambition" or anything like that.
Rather, it is the occupation of one's
father.
No justification
There is no moral justification for
asymmetric relations of wealth and

poverty. But there is an explanation.
Although it is a thesis of this coun
try's dominant ideology that there is
"liberty and justice for all" in the Un
ited States (remember this line from
the political socialization phase of
your primary school "education"?),
the fact is, at the level of objectivity,
laws "function" in this society — in any
capitalist society — to assist in there-

production of relations of wealth and
poverty, of dominance and powerless
ness, of hegemony and subordination.
It serves to legitimize and lend an holy
aura to exploitation.
A passage from a book (Institutional
Racism in America) largely written,
during the academic year 1967-68, by a
group of white Stanford students re
minds us that: "The administration of
justice, although theoretically based
on the ideal of equal protection for all,
is in fact largely dependent on finan
cial consideration. With regard to jus
tice, as with other American (U.S.)
commodities, the more one can pay,
the better product one gets."
The poor do not make the laws that
they must obey. They must face
juridico-legal institutions that hardly
include the poor in their personnel
roles, neither in the role of judge nor
lawyer, of grand-jury member nor pub
lic defender, of district attorney nor
clerk. They are discriminated against
because of educational and cultural
barriers — because they do not under
stand legal jargon, because they (espe
cially, the "ethnic" poor) do not speak
"plain English," because they dress
and/or wear their hair differently than
members of the dominant group.
Chronic losers
In terms of possibilities for proba
tion and parole, the poor are chronic

losers. Moreover, they generally re
ceive less-than-adequate counsel and
are often assumed a priori, through a
process sociologists call "labeling," to
he criminals. (Interestingly, Hearst es
caped being sorely victimized by this
process.)
Then, there is the problem of bail.
One could say a great deal about this.
Robert Kennedy hit the nail on the
head when he stated that the bail sys
tem discriminates against the poor,
that bail's "legitimate purpose of as
suring that defendants appear for trial
has been distorted into a systematic
injustice."
It is not just that, while juridico
legal institutions "appear" (through
the mystifications and illusions of law
and ideology) to be working in the in
terests of us all, the rich and powerful
benefit disproportionately. On occa
sion, the rich and powerful, usually, in
alliance with some other "class," di
rectly beckon juridico-legal institu
tions to protect their interests and in
sure their hegemony — for example,
with the McCarran Act of 1950, with
the 1967 Omnibus Crime Bill, and
with the "District of Columbia Court
Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of
1970."
Nor is it that the poor are ever
"equal before the law." In capitalist
society, "justice" is, in the final
analysis, a commodity. S/he who can
pay the most, gets the most. It is no
wonder that the step-daughter of the
last Californian executed in the gas
chamber was a friend of mine, not one
of Hearst's playmates.
It is no wonder that Nixon could
plead "phlebitis," and manage to
evoke empathic feelings from some
elements within the juridico-legal ap
paratus.
This nations' poor would undoub
tedly agree with a statement made by
theblack poet-singer,Gil-Scott Heron.
Gil-Scott once remarked: "Fleas bite us
too," but who cares?
