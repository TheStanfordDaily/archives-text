# Krevoy proposal lacked realistic alternatives

Brad Krevoy showed up at the ASSU
Senate meeting on Nov. 29 with a re
solution entitled A Resolution For Im
proved Undergraduate Education
(co-sponsored by Tim Ferguson)
which stated, "Be it resolved that the
ASSU Senate, though sharing many of
the concerns about drift in under
graduate education and ignorance of
western culture that have been voiced,
cautions against the re-institution of
course requirements."
This resolution is typical of Krevoy's
thoughtless proposals before the se
nate. Certainly the Faculty Senate to
whom this was addressed understands
the general student distaste for re
quired courses, but has resolved on its
own to reinstitute them just the same.
This was clear to all the senators at the
meeting, and a re-hash of the obvious

was not what was needed.
What was needed was the proposal
of a realistic alternative for the faculty
to consider, something we and many
of the other senators had been review
ing for some time. It was from this
then, that we were quite
enthusiastic when we saw that the se
nate's tentative agenda contained a
Resolution for Improved Under
graduate Education, which we
thought had saved us and the other
senators with whom we consult the
effort of drawing up such a resolution
ourselves.
Little did we know that the resolu
tion on the agenda was Krevoy's, and
that it in no way presented construc
tive alternatives, or even thoughtful
criticisms of the faculty's proposal. In
stead, it was merely what Vic Petroff

called "sentiments," or what more
realistic members of the senate call
"grandstanding."
in any event, at the senate there was
general consensus that krevoy's prop
osal was at best a sham which could
and would have no effect on the Fa
culty Senate's decision.
On a short term and superficial
plane,the proceedings on N0v.29 may
have made us look bad to have used
cheap politics to counter Krevoy's tac
tics, but the Hammer & Coffin has no
intention of diluting its power as the
best thing that ever occured on this
campus by passing mindless, insub
stantial and grandstanding resolutions

criticisms of the faculty's proposal. In
stead, it was merely what Vic Petroff

called "sentiments," or what more
realistic members of the senate call
"grandstanding."
in any event, at the senate there was
general consensus that krevoy's prop
osal was at best a sham which could
and would have no effect on the Fa
culty Senate's decision.
On a short term and superficial
plane,the proceedings on N0v.29 may
have made us look bad to have used
cheap politics to counter Krevoy's tac
tics, but the Hammer & Coffin has no
intention of diluting its power as the
best thing that ever occured on this
campus by passing mindless, insub
stantial and grandstanding resolutions
I Jeff Stuler, Tom Uevine, jim King, Jon
Burth, Barry Parr, and liny Skogstrom
are members of the Hammer and Cof
