# Hammer and Coffin slate capricious and obstructive
## 
### 
Johnson, et. al.

We would like to offer some clarifi
cation in regard to the recent furor over
the ASSU Senate's actions on the
Western Civilization requirement.
After some reflection, we have out
lined three general problem areas con
tributing to the 'ritire controversy: 1)
the actions of t>e Hammer & Coffin
(H&C) slate; 2) the coverage by the
Daily (Nov. .10); and 3) the column
submitted by the Council of Presidents
(COP) on Dec. 2.
First, the H&C rationale for opposi
tion to tilt; Ferguson/krevoy resolution
centered on some nebulous accusation
of "political grandstanding." Pre
cisely what this term means eludes any
definitive description. Conversely, the
illogical nature of their opposition
stands out quite clearly.
As implied in the Daily quotes, H&C
voted on the basis of personality rather
than substance. The resolution pre
sented a well-reasoned, valid perspec
tive on the question of Western Civ
requirements. Thus, the resolution de
served a fair evaluation by the senate.
The fundamental problem lies in the
capriciousness of the Hammer & Coffin
shite. Given the size of their faction in
the senate, they may easily stultify the
efforts of other senators. While H&C
has already contributed much to this
new senate, both in terms of levity and
legislation, they have now also en
gineered the Western Civ fiasco.
H&C, can contribute valuably
to the operation of the senate.
If they care not to exploit that oppor
tunity, the choice is theirs alone. Yet,
to obstruct the constructive actions of
their fellow senators is wrong.
Secondly, we believe the Daily
coverage of the affair only exacerbated
the problem. The quotes and structure
of the article distorted and sen
sationalized the senate's consideration
of the resolution. For instance, the
most hostile quote in the article came

from a person not at all involved in the
debate (Pat Flinn. Course Guide Policy
Board). Furthermore, the final vote on
the resolution-alo-10 tie requiring the
chair to break — was not even pub
lished. The total effect achieved was
two-fold: a one-sided view of senate
debateand a vindictive personal attack
on Brad krevoy.
Thirdly, the final die was cast when
the COP (Vic Petroff, el al.) chose to
join in the developing melee. Though
their defense of Krevoy was factual
and thoroughly commendable, they
committed an egregious misrepresen
tation of some senators' positions.
In their column, the COP confused
matters by erroneously lumping all
senate opposition into one camp. In
fact, some senators voted against the
resolution because they felt Western
Civ requirements are needed, certainly
a legitimate position. Furthermore,
other senators either had reservations
on the resolution's wording or be
lieved the proposal needed more in
tensive study by the senate.
Unfortunately, the absence of co
sponsor Tim Ferguson and the im
pending consideration of the issue by
the 1 iculty Senate mitigated against a
rewording or tabling of the resolution.
Faced with an either/or decision, these
senators voted against the resolution.
For them to be characterized as cohorts
of H&C is unjustified.
Additionally, it should be noted that
this type of simplification has been
characteristic of Petroffs dealing with
the senate. Too often Petroff seems to
equate opposition with ignorance. In
telligent debate and reasoned disag
reement are to be encouraged; we hope
Petroff will recognize this and thereby
foster more conjjenial working rela
tions between the COP and the senate.
Lastly, we wish to indicate our con
tinuing concern over the final resolu
tion of the Western Civ question. In-

asmuch as the Faculty Senate has cho
sen to reinstate such requirements, we
propose a senate task force charged
with developing a plan for the struc
ture of those requirements.
Our hope is that this task force will
work closely with the members of the
Faculty Senate subcommittee charged
with the same duties. As Allan Chen
pointed out in his letter of Dec. 3, "The
problem of balancing an education
should be worked out by agreement
between the teachers and students, not
by having one group deciding what's
good for the other."

capriciousness of the Hammer & Coffin
shite. Given the size of their faction in
the senate, they may easily stultify the
efforts of other senators. While H&C
has already contributed much to this
new senate, both in terms of levity and
legislation, they have now also en
gineered the Western Civ fiasco.
H&C, can contribute valuably
to the operation of the senate.
If they care not to exploit that oppor
tunity, the choice is theirs alone. Yet,
to obstruct the constructive actions of
their fellow senators is wrong.
Secondly, we believe the Daily
coverage of the affair only exacerbated
the problem. The quotes and structure
of the article distorted and sen
sationalized the senate's consideration
of the resolution. For instance, the
most hostile quote in the article came

from a person not at all involved in the
debate (Pat Flinn. Course Guide Policy
Board). Furthermore, the final vote on
the resolution-alo-10 tie requiring the
chair to break — was not even pub
lished. The total effect achieved was
two-fold: a one-sided view of senate
debateand a vindictive personal attack
on Brad krevoy.
Thirdly, the final die was cast when
the COP (Vic Petroff, el al.) chose to
join in the developing melee. Though
their defense of Krevoy was factual
and thoroughly commendable, they
committed an egregious misrepresen
tation of some senators' positions.
In their column, the COP confused
matters by erroneously lumping all
senate opposition into one camp. In
fact, some senators voted against the
resolution because they felt Western
Civ requirements are needed, certainly
a legitimate position. Furthermore,
other senators either had reservations
on the resolution's wording or be
lieved the proposal needed more in
tensive study by the senate.
Unfortunately, the absence of co
sponsor Tim Ferguson and the im
pending consideration of the issue by
the 1 iculty Senate mitigated against a
rewording or tabling of the resolution.
Faced with an either/or decision, these
senators voted against the resolution.
For them to be characterized as cohorts
of H&C is unjustified.
Additionally, it should be noted that
this type of simplification has been
characteristic of Petroffs dealing with
the senate. Too often Petroff seems to
equate opposition with ignorance. In
telligent debate and reasoned disag
reement are to be encouraged; we hope
Petroff will recognize this and thereby
foster more conjjenial working rela
tions between the COP and the senate.
Lastly, we wish to indicate our con
tinuing concern over the final resolu
tion of the Western Civ question. In-

asmuch as the Faculty Senate has cho
sen to reinstate such requirements, we
propose a senate task force charged
with developing a plan for the struc
ture of those requirements.
Our hope is that this task force will
work closely with the members of the
Faculty Senate subcommittee charged
with the same duties. As Allan Chen
pointed out in his letter of Dec. 3, "The
problem of balancing an education
should be worked out by agreement
between the teachers and students, not
by having one group deciding what's
good for the other."

Larkins, Dun Livingston, Rick Morrow

Johnson, et. al.

We would like to offer some clarifi
cation in regard to the recent furor over
the ASSU Senate's actions on the
Western Civilization requirement.
After some reflection, we have out
lined three general problem areas con
tributing to the 'ritire controversy: 1)
the actions of t>e Hammer & Coffin
(H&C) slate; 2) the coverage by the
Daily (Nov. .10); and 3) the column
submitted by the Council of Presidents
(COP) on Dec. 2.
First, the H&C rationale for opposi
tion to tilt; Ferguson/krevoy resolution
centered on some nebulous accusation
of "political grandstanding." Pre
cisely what this term means eludes any
definitive description. Conversely, the
illogical nature of their opposition
stands out quite clearly.
As implied in the Daily quotes, H&C
voted on the basis of personality rather
than substance. The resolution pre
sented a well-reasoned, valid perspec
tive on the question of Western Civ
requirements. Thus, the resolution de
served a fair evaluation by the senate.
The fundamental problem lies in the
capriciousness of the Hammer & Coffin
