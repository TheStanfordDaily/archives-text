## Liberal education not furthered by Western Civ requirement 
### 
Ferguson, Krevoy

We take this opportunity to express
our concern, as student leaders, about
efforts of the faculty to reinstitute re
quired courses in the humanities.
This expression must serve in lieu of
similar thoughts which, when cap
sulized in an ASSU Senate resolution
last week, ran afoul of ASSU politick
ing.
All of us share, to varying degrees,
the unease over the current state of un
dergraduate education which has
prompted the faculty to chart a return
to mandatory courses which were
phased out at Stanford in the late 19605.
Yet not one of us can say that satis
faction with the undergraduate cur
riculum is any less now than it was
then (though our judgments are, of
course, based on the recollections of
persons who were here a decade ago).
Sighs of relief
In fact, it can be reported that among
students, with a sense of institutional
history on this matter, the sighs of re
lief over the lifting of the those pon
derous requirements have yet to die
out.
The 1968 Study of Education at
Stanford (SES), which helped free us
of the requirements which are pre
decessors faced (and dreaded), need
not be a blueprint for academic drift
and "existential despair." Only the
university's failure to carry out the
positive recommendations of SES
makes it so.
A devotion of sufficient resources to

undergraduate advising, and a shift
away from attitudes of benign neglect
toward it, were among these SES
proposals.
"The faculty . .. while alleging the
importance of advising, does not take
much responsibility for doing it. There
is a notable lack of coherence both in
the system as a whole and among vari
ous aspects of it. As a result of this
indifference, students progress
haphazardly in many ways . . . (T)heir
choices of courses, majors, and even
careers are often made unreflectively
and without competent advice."
So speaketh SES. To deaf ears, appa
rently.
Beyond immediacies
Students will avail themselves of a
■liberal education when provided the
perspective to see beyond the im
mediacies of their fields of study. One
need only check the enrollments in
History 1-2-3 and Humanities 61-62-
63 to see this. More would enroll if
steered in that direction by a coherent
advising system.
We would have been more impre
ssed had the protagonists in the cur
rent debate proposed new faculty in
itiatives for shoring up the advising
system, rather than required courses
which will pour more money and
graduate students into their area of the
university.
But it is in the latter direction that
we appear to be moving. And yet, we
have seen no evidence to indicate that
problems of indifferent students (and

faculty, as History Prof. Peter Stansky
has pointed out), and inadequate staf
fing (note the current required
Freshman English program) which
made mandatory courses self
destructive in the 1960s will not be
present now. Neither do we see the
teaching of a required general studies
curriculum as any less the "institu
tional unreality" SES found it to be in
1968.
Pipe dream
Until these deficiencies are re
medied (and this should have been
done before the requirement was reins
tituted, not after), the belief that re
quired courses in Western culture will
further the liberal education of Stan
ford students can be nothing more
than a pipe dream.
The aim of the university has been
stated to be one of preparing its stu
dents to make the mature choices
necessary in a modern society. The
dragging of these same students, kick
ing and screaming, back into the Dark
Ages of Stanford seems a rather odd
way to go about it.

Ferguson, Krevoy

We take this opportunity to express
our concern, as student leaders, about
efforts of the faculty to reinstitute re
quired courses in the humanities.
This expression must serve in lieu of
similar thoughts which, when cap
sulized in an ASSU Senate resolution
last week, ran afoul of ASSU politick
ing.
All of us share, to varying degrees,
the unease over the current state of un
dergraduate education which has
prompted the faculty to chart a return
to mandatory courses which were
phased out at Stanford in the late 19605.
Yet not one of us can say that satis
faction with the undergraduate cur
riculum is any less now than it was
then (though our judgments are, of
course, based on the recollections of
persons who were here a decade ago).
Sighs of relief
In fact, it can be reported that among
students, with a sense of institutional
history on this matter, the sighs of re
lief over the lifting of the those pon
derous requirements have yet to die
out.
The 1968 Study of Education at
Stanford (SES), which helped free us
of the requirements which are pre
decessors faced (and dreaded), need
not be a blueprint for academic drift
and "existential despair." Only the
university's failure to carry out the
positive recommendations of SES
makes it so.
A devotion of sufficient resources to

undergraduate advising, and a shift
away from attitudes of benign neglect
toward it, were among these SES
proposals.
"The faculty . .. while alleging the
importance of advising, does not take
much responsibility for doing it. There
is a notable lack of coherence both in
the system as a whole and among vari
ous aspects of it. As a result of this
indifference, students progress
haphazardly in many ways . . . (T)heir
choices of courses, majors, and even
careers are often made unreflectively
and without competent advice."
So speaketh SES. To deaf ears, appa
rently.
Beyond immediacies
Students will avail themselves of a
■liberal education when provided the
perspective to see beyond the im
mediacies of their fields of study. One
need only check the enrollments in
History 1-2-3 and Humanities 61-62-
63 to see this. More would enroll if
steered in that direction by a coherent
advising system.
We would have been more impre
ssed had the protagonists in the cur
rent debate proposed new faculty in
itiatives for shoring up the advising
system, rather than required courses
which will pour more money and
graduate students into their area of the
university.
But it is in the latter direction that
we appear to be moving. And yet, we
have seen no evidence to indicate that
problems of indifferent students (and

faculty, as History Prof. Peter Stansky
has pointed out), and inadequate staf
fing (note the current required
Freshman English program) which
made mandatory courses self
destructive in the 1960s will not be
present now. Neither do we see the
