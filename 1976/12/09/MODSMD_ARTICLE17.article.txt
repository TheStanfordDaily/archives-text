Senator's comments
I'd like to clear up a few comments
attributed to me in the Daily article
(Nov. :J0) on the ASSU Senate Western
Civ resolution.
First. I believe my statements were
taken somewhat out of context. My
comments were directed toward
members of the I lammer & Coffin slate,
to the effect that even granting their
contention of grandstanding by
Senator Krevoy, they had handled the
matter erroneously.
Second, I emphatically do not agree
that the resolution was "political
grandstanding" as characterized by
Hammer and Coffin. I supported both
the resolution and Brad krevoy's

thoughtful sponsorship of it.

Bonfire phone poles
As a Stanford alumnus (8.A., 1970,
M.A., 197 1), 1 believe in traditions that
bring students together. This includes
the Big Came bonfire. But there are
some very positive reasons why
Pacific Telephone (PT&T) did not con
tribute poles and set them up for the
Bonfire in 1975 and tliis year.
Environmental pollution is a major
issue and an overriding concern of
mine and my company. PT&T. When
our construction superviser was called
and asked for the poles this year, he
gave environmental pollution as one

reason why we very likely would not
be able to supply the poles and dig the
holes.
He also told IPC President Jordan
Schwartz that there were no utility
poles available when he first called,
and that it didn't look like we would
have any by the time they would be
needed. Three days before the
scheduled bonfire, when Schwartz
again called our construction super
viser, he was advised by him that there
were no poles available.
The construction superviser then
gave Schwartz information to enable
him to secure poles, without charge,
from another company; advised him
about specific people who could help
set them up safely; and strongly urged
Schwartz to secure the right equip

ment to do so.
If the construction supervisees ad
vice had been closely followed, I be
lieve the two injuries to students who
attempted to set a pole into place with
out machinery would have been pre
vented.
In a positive manner, therefore,
Pacific Telephone aided the effort to
continue the tradition of a Big Game
bonfire, but informed the requesting
student that because of an air pollution
restriction against open burning, and
also because no poles were available,
that we could not directly supply the
poles.

Bonfire phone poles
As a Stanford alumnus (8.A., 1970,
M.A., 197 1), 1 believe in traditions that
bring students together. This includes
the Big Came bonfire. But there are
some very positive reasons why
Pacific Telephone (PT&T) did not con
tribute poles and set them up for the
Bonfire in 1975 and tliis year.
Environmental pollution is a major
issue and an overriding concern of
mine and my company. PT&T. When
our construction superviser was called
and asked for the poles this year, he
gave environmental pollution as one

reason why we very likely would not
be able to supply the poles and dig the
holes.
He also told IPC President Jordan
Schwartz that there were no utility
poles available when he first called,
and that it didn't look like we would
have any by the time they would be
needed. Three days before the
scheduled bonfire, when Schwartz
again called our construction super
viser, he was advised by him that there
were no poles available.
The construction superviser then
gave Schwartz information to enable
him to secure poles, without charge,
from another company; advised him
about specific people who could help
set them up safely; and strongly urged
Schwartz to secure the right equip

ment to do so.
If the construction supervisees ad
vice had been closely followed, I be
lieve the two injuries to students who
attempted to set a pole into place with
out machinery would have been pre
vented.
In a positive manner, therefore,
Pacific Telephone aided the effort to
continue the tradition of a Big Game
bonfire, but informed the requesting
student that because of an air pollution
restriction against open burning, and
also because no poles were available,
that we could not directly supply the
poles.

Senator's comments
I'd like to clear up a few comments
attributed to me in the Daily article
(Nov. :J0) on the ASSU Senate Western
Civ resolution.
First. I believe my statements were
taken somewhat out of context. My
comments were directed toward
members of the I lammer & Coffin slate,
to the effect that even granting their
contention of grandstanding by
Senator Krevoy, they had handled the
matter erroneously.
Second, I emphatically do not agree
that the resolution was "political
grandstanding" as characterized by
Hammer and Coffin. I supported both
the resolution and Brad krevoy's

thoughtful sponsorship of it.
