# 'Outsiders' in USE leadership spark debate
## 
### Pan Demetrakakes Staff writer 
In a meeting marked by con
troversy over the status of two
women on the executive com
mittee, the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union voted
Tuesday night to accept a reduc
tion in its initiation fee and gave
tentative approval to a new
strike fund bylaw.
Several members of the union
objected to the fact that two
members of the executive com
mittee, Florie Merger and Be
verly Loyo, are not currently
employed by Stanford.
"These people are going to be
making decisions that will affect
every member of the union, and I
think they should be part of the
workers," union member Wally
Schmidt said.
"The union staff is not a bloc
of people that is working for
something the rest of the mem
bers are not working for," USE
Reporter Glenda Jones replied.
One of those who objected to
Merger's and Loyo's presence on
the executive committee was
Assoc. President William
Reynolds, who chaired the meet
ing in the absence of President
Roger I lardy.
"What I'd like to see is a story
in the (USE) paper saying that
you don't have to work for Stan
ford to be on the executive com
mittee, and see how the mem
bership reacts," Reynolds said.
"Then write a letter to the
editor and we'll publish it,"
[ones retorted.
USE also approved the first
reading of a bylaw stipulating
that 5 per cent of USE's dues
shall go into a strike fund until
approximately $38,000
has been accumulated. The vote
was 14 to 6. The measure will
come up for a final vote at next
month's membership meeting.
Several members felt that
$38,000 was not enough. Former
USE President Jim Berk said, "I
felt and I still feel that this fund
is inadequate for a strike." How
ever, he added that since the re
cently signed contract removed
the danger of a strike, he sup
ported the measure.
USE also approved a measure
stating that a worker who
applied for USE membership
within a certain period of time
(90 days in most cases) after tak
ing a Stanford job will be
charged a $5 initiation fee.
Those who join after that period
will be charged $50.
The old bylaw stipulated that
a worker who joined within 30
days after starting work would
be charged $5; a worker who
joined between 30 and 60 days
would be charged $25; and a
worker who joined thereafter
would be charged $50.
