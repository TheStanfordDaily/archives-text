Approximately 55 per cent of un
dergraduates here use marijuana,
according to a Daily drug use sur
vey taken last month.
The survey polled 200 under
graduates selected at regular inter
vals from thePublic Roster, a listing
of all students registered here.
Questionnaires were mailed or
hand-delivered to each person in
the sample and 154 persons re
turned completed questionnaires.
The survey also found that 17 per
cent of the students use cocaine, 12
per cent use hallucinogens such as
LSD or mescaline and five per cent
use opiates such as heroin or mor
phine.
Pill poppers
Also, 1H per cent use am
phetamines, nine per cent use bar
biturates and 10 per cent use tran
quilizers.
For all drugs, usage frequencies
fit into one of seven categories,
ranging from less than once a year
to daily or several times a day.
Because of the relatively small
number of people surveyed, actual
usage figures may differ by a few
percent from theories in the survey.

Students were also asked about
their alcohol consumption. Only
two per cent said they did not use
alcohol, while 43 per cent said they
used alcohol once a week or more.
In contrast, 61 per cent of college
students across the country drink
once a week or more, according to a
survey in the October Playboy.
Marijuana users
Of the marijuana users here, 49
per cent said their usage has in
creased since coming to Stanford
(with 27 per cent reporting their
usage more than doubled). Only 10
per cent reported a decrease. The
remaining 40 per cent reported no
change in usage. (Because the fi
gures are rounded off. they total
only 99 per cent.)
Over half the students in the
Daily survey — 58 per cent — said
their frequency of alcohol use has
increased since coming here. Only
13 per cent said their frequency has
dropped while 29 per cent reported
no change.
Some 60 per cent of those who
said they drink reported becoming
extremely intoxicated from alcohol,
with 10 per cent reporting extreme
intoxication once a month or more.
Extreme intoxication was de

fined to consist of any of the foliow
ing symptoms: memory loss,
speech impairment, hysterical
laughter, vomiting, visions or diz
ziness.
Among the marijuana users, 74
per cent said they have become ex
tremely intoxicated from the drug,
with 25 per cent reporting a fre
quency of at least once a month.
'Hard' drug users
Nearly all "hard" drug users in
dicated their usage frequencies
were quite 10w—65 per cent of the
cocaine users, 100 per cent of the
opiate users and 89 per cent of the
hallucinogen users reported a use
frequency of less than once a
month.
Among "pill poppers," 68 per
cent of amphetamine users, 57 per
cent of barbiturate users and 73 per
cent of tranquilizer users reported
a use frequency of less than once a
month.
Freshmen reported slightly lower
usage levels than sophomores,
juniors and seniors, but this varia
tion was significant only for
cocaine. While four per cent of
freshmen respondents said they
used cocaine, the figure was 22 per
cent for upperclassmen.

Pill poppers
Also, 1H per cent use am
phetamines, nine per cent use bar
biturates and 10 per cent use tran
quilizers.
For all drugs, usage frequencies
fit into one of seven categories,
ranging from less than once a year
to daily or several times a day.
Because of the relatively small
number of people surveyed, actual
usage figures may differ by a few
percent from theories in the survey.

Students were also asked about
their alcohol consumption. Only
two per cent said they did not use
alcohol, while 43 per cent said they
used alcohol once a week or more.
In contrast, 61 per cent of college
students across the country drink
once a week or more, according to a
survey in the October Playboy.
Marijuana users
Of the marijuana users here, 49
per cent said their usage has in
creased since coming to Stanford
(with 27 per cent reporting their
usage more than doubled). Only 10
per cent reported a decrease. The
remaining 40 per cent reported no
change in usage. (Because the fi
gures are rounded off. they total
only 99 per cent.)
Over half the students in the
Daily survey — 58 per cent — said
their frequency of alcohol use has
increased since coming here. Only
13 per cent said their frequency has
dropped while 29 per cent reported
no change.
Some 60 per cent of those who
said they drink reported becoming
extremely intoxicated from alcohol,
with 10 per cent reporting extreme
intoxication once a month or more.
Extreme intoxication was de

fined to consist of any of the foliow
ing symptoms: memory loss,
speech impairment, hysterical
laughter, vomiting, visions or diz
ziness.
Among the marijuana users, 74
per cent said they have become ex
tremely intoxicated from the drug,
with 25 per cent reporting a fre
quency of at least once a month.
'Hard' drug users
Nearly all "hard" drug users in
dicated their usage frequencies
were quite 10w—65 per cent of the
cocaine users, 100 per cent of the
opiate users and 89 per cent of the
hallucinogen users reported a use
frequency of less than once a
month.
Among "pill poppers," 68 per
cent of amphetamine users, 57 per
cent of barbiturate users and 73 per
cent of tranquilizer users reported
a use frequency of less than once a
month.
Freshmen reported slightly lower
usage levels than sophomores,
juniors and seniors, but this varia
tion was significant only for
cocaine. While four per cent of
freshmen respondents said they
used cocaine, the figure was 22 per
cent for upperclassmen.
