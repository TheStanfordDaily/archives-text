My office overlooks the area marked "Animal Laboratory
Medicine. I here are days when (lie pandemonium from these
offices is really disturbing. Does Stanford practice vivisection, to
what degree, and with what type of animals (the dogs' cries are
hard to take, particularly)?
Maxine Stensrud of the lab assured me all the animals are
humanely treated. "They are given a home, fed and cared for." But,
she says, "they are research animals."
There are about 168 researchers from the Medical Center who use
the animals. The lab has dogs, cats, monkeys, calve? and goats. But
by far the most popular subjects are rodents, which are relatively
inexpensive.
Stensrud says the lab is constantly under the watchful eye of both
federal and state inspectors, who pop in at least once a month. And
before a grant is permitted for a particular type of research, the
project must be approved by the National Institutes of Health and
the School of Medicine.
(letting back to the dogs. Stensrud says there are currently about
50 dogs in use. They are used mostly by cardiovascular researchers
in heart studies.
Stensrud says she knows they're sometimes looked upon as
butchers since the animals are often euthanized. "Sometimes it
seems pretty cruel," she says. But if a person had a heart condition,
he would be more than willing to allow the research. "We do all
we can to save a life," she added.
Why are the trees in back of 558 Mayfield uniformly crooked?
-IT.
Without having seen those trees. Biology Prof. Peter Kay specu
lates that the phenomena you're writing about has to do with a
prevailing wind gradually pushing the trees in one direction. Kay
says it's an example of how something so seemingly minor as a
little wind can have a tremendous impact on the long run life of a
tree.
Ihe crookedness could also be an effect ol "photo
orientation," where the growth direction is sensitive to light. Or,
says Kay, "land subsidence," where dirt gradually moves down a
slope causing tree roots to rotate, is another possibility. But Ray
says it isn't likely that these had much to do with the angle of the
trees, since both photo-orientation and land subsidence usually
occur on steep slopes.
