### David Georgette Staff writer Lonnie Rosenwald 
A student committee is inves
tigating the possibility of mov
ing the fall semester final
examination for the Law School
from January fo mid-December
before the Christmas break.
However, the chairman of the
three-member Student Advisory
Committee on the Academic
Calendar said the plan would
not take effect until the "distant
future."
Chairman Mark Primack said,
"There would be a two-year lag
at least."
The Law School semestei now

begins in early September and
ends in January. The spring
semester begins a few days after
the January finals.
'It's a pain'
"It's always been an area of
concern," said Steve Samuels,
president of the Law Associa
tion, the student government
body of the Law School. "It's a
pain having them (finals) after
Christmas."
Law Prof. Paul Coldstein saiil
the exams are given after
Christmas break because "that's
the way it's been historically.
"The simple reason it has not
been changed is because the fa

culty has not recommended a
change to the university. To my
knowledge one reason the fa
culty hasn't recommended it is
because it hasn't been consi
dered," Goldstein said.
Pre-Christmas preferred
A poll conducted last year
showed law students preferred
three to one to have exams ad
ministered before Christmas, ac
cording to Samuels. The change
would necessitate beginning the
autumn semester in August.
"For all practical purposes,
nothing was done about it," said
Primack. However, the topic
came up again earlier this semes
ter, he added.
Samuels said the advisory
committee members have met
among themselves a few times
and informally with Coldstein
once. "Basically, what they're
doing during this period is
evaluating the impact of a calen
dar change," said Samuels.
Primack said that his commit
tee hopes to prepare a report
considering the advantages and
disadvantages of a change and
perhaps will take another poll iu
January or February.
There're two things to con
sider," said Rob Binaiz of the
Law Association. "Christmas
vacation gives you a good block
of time to study, but that also
ruins your vacation."

Recent developments in the
massage parlor controversy have
focused attention on a local
group known as the Coalition of
Concerned Citizens which is
bent on preserving the "moral
health" of Palo Alto.
The group of 200 homeowners
and business proprietors from
Palo Alto has grabbed the atten
tion of the city council, the
police department, and the pub
lic by proclaiming its interest in
protecting what Concerned Citi
zen Mernadine Scoles calls "the
health and well-being of Palo
Alto."
The coalition has launched an
attack on massage parlors, por
nography shops and, in Scoles'
words, "any activity that would
infringe on the rights of uncon
senting adults or children."
The moral clean-up campaign
of the coalition coincides with a
nine-month effort by the city of
Palo Alto to regulate the ac
tivities of adult entertainment
establishments through licens
ing, distance limitations, and
zoning restrictions.
The group is interested in
educating the public, as well as
pushing for reform of municipal
regulations. It has maintained a
close relationship with the city
council by having individual
council members attend the co
alition's weekly meetings held
in members' homes.

The coalition officially got
started six months ago when .1
few vocal, interested citizens
"became alarmed at the increase
in the amount of massage par
lors. because they represent a
threat to the health and well
being of our children." said

Scoles.
"Children and unconsenting
adults are caught in this web ol
so-called 'victimless crimes'.
They do not have a say-so over
the kind of atmosphere they live
in," according If) Scoles.
"Palo Alto lacked restraints to
restrict these activities," con
tinues Scoles. "The city council
did not recognize Ihii problem
until this year."
Recognition was forced upon

the council members, however,
beginning in May when they
were invited one by one to attend
meetings of the coalition.
Councilman Byron Slier de
scribed his impression ot the
group members, after attending
one of their meetings on

November 17 as "very con
cerned and aware and responsi
ble people."
The evolution of the organiza
tion began three years ago when
a small group of Palo Alto resi
dents got together to share their
concerns about the declining
moral atmosphere of the com
munity.
"In tin; beginning we had kind
of a live-and-let-live policy."
said Scoles. "Hut a marked in

crease in the crime rate in areas
surrounding massage parlors
.iiid the more blatant display of
signs and scantily clad women"
led to a change in this position.
"Neighborhoods' atmosphere
changed," according to Scoles.
The coalition backs up its lin
kage ot adult entertainment es
tablishments to crime by citing
an August report presented by
the Palo Alto police department
to the city council. The report
enumerates B6 crimes against
persons or property connected
with the establishments, 26
prostitution arrests made at the
establishments, and 15) other
pending cases tor various related
crimes.
"It eventually forms kind of a
ghetto of adult entertainment
businesses." claims Scoles. bor
rowing the terminology of San
lose Deputy 13.A. Al Fabris, who
in a recent report to the county
planning commission described
a progression from sex shops to
ghettos.
"I am always disturbed when
other citizens tell me how 1 can

Richards, an attorney and

Liberties Union.
Without appeal from the de
fendants the A(II,IJ will not enter

Recent developments in the
massage parlor controversy have
focused attention on a local
group known as the Coalition of
Concerned Citizens which is
bent on preserving the "moral
health" of Palo Alto.
The group of 200 homeowners
and business proprietors from
Palo Alto has grabbed the atten
tion of the city council, the
police department, and the pub
lic by proclaiming its interest in
protecting what Concerned Citi
zen Mernadine Scoles calls "the
health and well-being of Palo
Alto."
The coalition has launched an
attack on massage parlors, por
nography shops and, in Scoles'
words, "any activity that would
infringe on the rights of uncon
senting adults or children."
The moral clean-up campaign
of the coalition coincides with a
nine-month effort by the city of
Palo Alto to regulate the ac
tivities of adult entertainment
establishments through licens
ing, distance limitations, and
zoning restrictions.
The group is interested in
educating the public, as well as
pushing for reform of municipal
regulations. It has maintained a
close relationship with the city
council by having individual
council members attend the co
alition's weekly meetings held
in members' homes.

The coalition officially got
started six months ago when .1
few vocal, interested citizens
"became alarmed at the increase
in the amount of massage par
lors. because they represent a
threat to the health and well
being of our children." said

Scoles.
"Children and unconsenting
adults are caught in this web ol
so-called 'victimless crimes'.
They do not have a say-so over
the kind of atmosphere they live
in," according If) Scoles.
"Palo Alto lacked restraints to
restrict these activities," con
tinues Scoles. "The city council
did not recognize Ihii problem
until this year."
Recognition was forced upon

the council members, however,
beginning in May when they
were invited one by one to attend
meetings of the coalition.
Councilman Byron Slier de
scribed his impression ot the
group members, after attending
one of their meetings on

November 17 as "very con
cerned and aware and responsi
ble people."
The evolution of the organiza
tion began three years ago when
a small group of Palo Alto resi
dents got together to share their
concerns about the declining
moral atmosphere of the com
munity.
"In tin; beginning we had kind
of a live-and-let-live policy."
said Scoles. "Hut a marked in

crease in the crime rate in areas
surrounding massage parlors
.iiid the more blatant display of
signs and scantily clad women"
led to a change in this position.
"Neighborhoods' atmosphere
changed," according to Scoles.
The coalition backs up its lin
kage ot adult entertainment es
tablishments to crime by citing
an August report presented by
the Palo Alto police department
to the city council. The report
enumerates B6 crimes against
persons or property connected
with the establishments, 26
prostitution arrests made at the
establishments, and 15) other
pending cases tor various related
crimes.
"It eventually forms kind of a

Recent developments in the
massage parlor controversy have
focused attention on a local
group known as the Coalition of
Concerned Citizens which is
bent on preserving the "moral
health" of Palo Alto.
The group of 200 homeowners
and business proprietors from
Palo Alto has grabbed the atten
tion of the city council, the
police department, and the pub
lic by proclaiming its interest in
protecting what Concerned Citi
zen Mernadine Scoles calls "the
health and well-being of Palo
Alto."
The coalition has launched an
attack on massage parlors, por
nography shops and, in Scoles'
words, "any activity that would
infringe on the rights of uncon
senting adults or children."
The moral clean-up campaign
of the coalition coincides with a
nine-month effort by the city of
Palo Alto to regulate the ac
tivities of adult entertainment
establishments through licens
ing, distance limitations, and
zoning restrictions.
The group is interested in
educating the public, as well as
pushing for reform of municipal
regulations. It has maintained a
close relationship with the city
council by having individual
council members attend the co
alition's weekly meetings held
in members' homes.

The coalition officially got
started six months ago when .1
few vocal, interested citizens
"became alarmed at the increase
in the amount of massage par
lors. because they represent a
threat to the health and well
being of our children." said

Scoles.
"Children and unconsenting
adults are caught in this web ol
so-called 'victimless crimes'.
They do not have a say-so over
the kind of atmosphere they live
in," according If) Scoles.
"Palo Alto lacked restraints to
restrict these activities," con
tinues Scoles. "The city council
did not recognize Ihii problem
until this year."
Recognition was forced upon

the council members, however,
beginning in May when they
were invited one by one to attend
meetings of the coalition.
Councilman Byron Slier de
scribed his impression ot the
group members, after attending
one of their meetings on

November 17 as "very con
cerned and aware and responsi
ble people."
The evolution of the organiza
tion began three years ago when
a small group of Palo Alto resi
dents got together to share their
concerns about the declining
moral atmosphere of the com
munity.
"In tin; beginning we had kind
of a live-and-let-live policy."
said Scoles. "Hut a marked in

crease in the crime rate in areas
surrounding massage parlors
.iiid the more blatant display of
signs and scantily clad women"
led to a change in this position.
"Neighborhoods' atmosphere
changed," according to Scoles.
The coalition backs up its lin
kage ot adult entertainment es
tablishments to crime by citing
an August report presented by
the Palo Alto police department
to the city council. The report
enumerates B6 crimes against
persons or property connected
with the establishments, 26
prostitution arrests made at the
establishments, and 15) other
pending cases tor various related
crimes.
"It eventually forms kind of a
ghetto of adult entertainment
businesses." claims Scoles. bor
rowing the terminology of San
lose Deputy 13.A. Al Fabris, who
in a recent report to the county
planning commission described
a progression from sex shops to
ghettos.
"I am always disturbed when
other citizens tell me how 1 can
enjoy myself." said Leonard
Richards, an attorney and
member ot the American Civil
Liberties Union.
Without appeal from the de
fendants the A(II,IJ will not enter
the current case pending against
tin; owners of recently closed
massage parlors. Hut, according
to Richards, the A('.1,l I "remains
ready to ship in and do some
work on this. Nobody's tripped
