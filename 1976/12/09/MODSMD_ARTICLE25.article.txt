### Alex Leff Perry Simon 
What more can be said about
The Band's Last Waltz, the most
talked about rock concert of the
year? Not much—but in the spirit
of the ol' college try. here goes.
The Band, one of the foremost
groups playing American rock'n
roll, hosted a gala party
Thanksgiving night. The group,
which rose to fame providing
electric back-up to superstar Bob
Dylan, decided to end their live
appearances with the perfor
mance. although they will con
tinue to record together.
The gala was held at Bill
Graham's Winterland in San
Francisco and Graham had done
a magic make-up job on the rock
auditorium specially for this
performance. Chandeliers hung,
fountains gurgled in tin; lobby,
potted ferns hung out in the
lobby, and huge columned sets
from tlie San Francisco Opera's
production of Lll Tmviutu deco
rated the stage.
For <1 ticket price of $25. pat
rons were treated before the
show to .1 turke\ dinner catered
by thi? famed Berkeley restaurant
Narsais. Thirty-five members of
the Berkeley Promenade Or
chestra provided waltz music for
dining and dancing pleasure. So
even before The Band mounted
the stage, the audience was hav
ing a fine time.
Graham walked about, survey
ing the scene, dressed spiffily in
a white suit and wearing an un
characteristic grin, his eyes

glazed from the beauty of the
moment and from hick of sleep
during the previous week.
The mass feeding of 5500
people was carried out without a
hitch; there was absolutely no
pushing, shoving, nor was the
food cold. Graham organized the
entire affair magnificently. The
evening is another feather in his
cap.
So the audience dined.danced
(and spread rumors about which
famous guest stars would be ap

pearing) for a few enjoyable
hours until the lights dimmed
and The Band sauntered on
stage. The group launched into .1
lengthy and fine set of their own
material and then began to bring
a parade of their "friends" 011
stage.
During the next three hours, <1
succession of rock superstars in
cluding Ronnie Hawkins, Dr.
John, Neil Young. Eric Clapton,
Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell.
Paul Butterfield, Van Morrison,

Muddy Waters. Kinj»o Starr, Kon
Wood, Stephen Stills .mil Hob
