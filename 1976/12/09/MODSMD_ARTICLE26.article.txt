# Reed puts on dull show

### Jon Auerbach 
Still another coup for rock impressario Bill
Graham? That was what we suspected as we
gazed at the bank of 48 television sets that lined
the stage of the Berkeley Community Theater on
the evening of Lou Reed's long-awaited Bay Area
uppeara nee.
Obviously, Graham had stumbled onto the
magic solution for rock'n roll security â€” the way
to turn a jittery crowd of young mind-altered row
dies waiting for the appearance of their punk-rock
king into a pacified group of gentle lovers of
American culture. Graham has tried on previous
occasions to calm his pre-concert audiences with
taped renditions of the folk-song, GreensJeeves,
and he has even tried stuffing his audience with
turkey hoping to get their minds off mischief and
onto their bellies.
But the cunning impressario outdid himself
this time; as we glanced around the auditorium
we realized that instead of the usual pounding of
the floor boards and yelling en masse of such
classic slogans as "Rock'n Roll!" and "Let's
Boogie!" that precede most shows, this audience
was peacefully gazing at the T.V. sets on stage

(some of which were even turned on).
1 he time was almost H p.m. and since it was
Tuesday night, we happily anticipated the ap
pearance of America's favorite punk: the Fonz.
just t hen, t he lights dimmed and Lou Reed and his
band ran on stage. As they launched into their
first number the I A'.s went beserko. displaying
not Ihe Fonz but rather >1 close-circuit transmis
sion of swirling abstract patterns Reed gave a
lackluster performance that drove us and many
other patrons out into the night early.
Lou Reed is known, since his days in the Velvet
Underground, for his halt-sung, half-spoken
paens to New York punkhood. Unfortunatelv,
the band that he brought to Berkeley was several
degrees less than cooking. The group presented <i
bland and unmusical back-up.
Lou Reed s recitation of his poems about urban
violence, drugs, and contused sensuality are just
not good enough to carry flit! interest of an audi
ence without ,1 good musical background.
After an hour and a half of Lou Reed's perfor
mance, it was clear that watching the Fonz would
have been a better bet for that eveninu
