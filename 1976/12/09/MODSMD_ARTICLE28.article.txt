# S.F. Symphony
## Mahler starts season 
### Kathy Trafton 
Opening night at the San
Francisco Symphony conjures
up visions of an enthusiastic au
dience springing to its feet in re
sponse to a great performance of
an equally great symphony.
Not so on December 1. The au
dience remained seated, lan
guidly applauding a symphony
— Mahler's Seventh — that can
only be described as mellow.
Conductor Seiji Ozawa did a fine
job on a symphony that simply
does not stand out.
Because many people per
ceived a predominance of noc
turnal moods in the Seventh
Symphony, it came to be called
"Song of the Night," a designa
tion which did not originate
with Mahler. Indeed, the second
and fourth Nachtmusik move
ments could have been down
right soporific had not Ozawa
so sensitively conducted his
musicians.
Militaristic
Nevertheless, "Song of the
Night" does not seem to be a
truly apt description of Mahler's
Seventh. My overall impression
ot the symphony could be de
scribed in one word: militaristic.
A pervasive martial overtone
dominated the big outer move
ments. and timeand timeagain a
heavy marching rhythm inter
jected itself amidst the otherwise

melodic strains ot the; inner three
movements.
In the opening Lungsum
movement, tlu;march theme 'vas
too persistent. The somber slow
mood eventually changed to .1
juxtaposition ot inarching and a
sentimental theme that set the
mood for the nocturnal move
ment to follow.
The; first Nuchtmusik move
ment began with, and later re
turned to, a solo horn accom
panied by cowbells rattling
softly, evoking lonely night
sounds. Images of gypsies with
tambourines floated in and out
ol the music along with the in
evitable; military strides.
The third movement, Scherzo,
seemed to be both sinister and
parodistic. After an opening
march to timpani. a range of loud
and soft dynamics built up to a
whirling Danse Macabre. The
ensuing key change helped to
create a grotesquely gay waltz
parodv. and the solo violin was
reminiscent of Death's fiddle.
This movement, which was the
darkest moment in the sym
phony, was suitably ghostly yet
sensitive.
Kilting and gentle
The second Nachtmasik
movement was melodic, lilting
and gentle. It flowed gracefully
and some interest was added by
the pluckings of harp, guitar and

mandolin. These three inner
movements reflected the skill
and sensitivity Ozawa has for the
romantic: and the beautiful.
The Honcio-Finale was what
we can hope was a parody on the
rondo form itself. The highly
structured movement made a
dramatic start on timpani and
developed a festive theme in a
gamut of widely differing keys
and moods. The symphony
ended with the bamging ol tim
pani, chimes and cowbells com
batting the final melodic orch
estral strains. The effect was
mushy — as if a pianist had left
his sostenuto pedal down too
long.
The performance was con
ducted from memory by Ozawa,
who is leaving his position as
conductor and music director of
the San Francisco Symphony in
order to devote himself to the
Boston Symphony. He has been
music director with S.F. for the
past six years, and currently is
music advisor.
This week's program, to be
conducted by Ozawa tonight
through Saturday, includes
"Symphony No. li 4 inCMajor k.
by Mozart. A Concerto for
Organ and Chamber Orchestra,
Op. 46, No. 2" by Hindemith,
and "Balshazzar's Feast" by Wil
liam Walton.

and some interest was added by
the pluckings of harp, guitar and

mandolin. These three inner
movements reflected the skill
and sensitivity Ozawa has for the
romantic: and the beautiful.
The Honcio-Finale was what
we can hope was a parody on the
rondo form itself. The highly
structured movement made a
dramatic start on timpani and
developed a festive theme in a
gamut of widely differing keys
and moods. The symphony
ended with the bamging ol tim
pani, chimes and cowbells com
batting the final melodic orch
estral strains. The effect was
mushy — as if a pianist had left
his sostenuto pedal down too
long.
The performance was con
ducted from memory by Ozawa,
who is leaving his position as
conductor and music director of
the San Francisco Symphony in
order to devote himself to the
Boston Symphony. He has been
music director with S.F. for the
past six years, and currently is
music advisor.
This week's program, to be
conducted by Ozawa tonight
through Saturday, includes
"Symphony No. li 4 inCMajor k.
by Mozart. A Concerto for
Organ and Chamber Orchestra,
Op. 46, No. 2" by Hindemith,
and "Balshazzar's Feast" by Wil
liam Walton.
Opening night at the San
Francisco Symphony conjures
up visions of an enthusiastic au
dience springing to its feet in re
sponse to a great performance of
an equally great symphony.
Not so on December 1. The au
dience remained seated, lan
guidly applauding a symphony
— Mahler's Seventh — that can
only be described as mellow.
Conductor Seiji Ozawa did a fine
job on a symphony that simply
does not stand out.
Because many people per
ceived a predominance of noc
turnal moods in the Seventh
Symphony, it came to be called
"Song of the Night," a designa
tion which did not originate
with Mahler. Indeed, the second
and fourth Nachtmusik move
ments could have been down
right soporific had not Ozawa
so sensitively conducted his
musicians.
Militaristic
Nevertheless, "Song of the
Night" does not seem to be a
truly apt description of Mahler's
Seventh. My overall impression
ot the symphony could be de
scribed in one word: militaristic.
A pervasive martial overtone
dominated the big outer move
ments. and timeand timeagain a
heavy marching rhythm inter
jected itself amidst the otherwise

melodic strains ot the; inner three
movements.
In the opening Lungsum
movement, tlu;march theme 'vas
too persistent. The somber slow
mood eventually changed to .1
juxtaposition ot inarching and a
sentimental theme that set the
mood for the nocturnal move
ment to follow.
The; first Nuchtmusik move
ment began with, and later re
turned to, a solo horn accom
panied by cowbells rattling
softly, evoking lonely night
sounds. Images of gypsies with
tambourines floated in and out
ol the music along with the in
evitable; military strides.
The third movement, Scherzo,
seemed to be both sinister and
parodistic. After an opening
march to timpani. a range of loud
and soft dynamics built up to a
whirling Danse Macabre. The
ensuing key change helped to
create a grotesquely gay waltz
parodv. and the solo violin was
reminiscent of Death's fiddle.
This movement, which was the
darkest moment in the sym
phony, was suitably ghostly yet
sensitive.
Kilting and gentle
The second Nachtmasik
movement was melodic, lilting
and gentle. It flowed gracefully
and some interest was added by
the pluckings of harp, guitar and

mandolin. These three inner
movements reflected the skill
and sensitivity Ozawa has for the
romantic: and the beautiful.
