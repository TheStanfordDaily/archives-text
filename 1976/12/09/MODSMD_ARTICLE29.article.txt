# Dickens' classic at the Geary Theater
## 'A Christmas Carol' sparkles

Nothing can kill Christmas
Spirit quicker than having four
fi rials in three days plus assorted
take-home essays and papers
scattered in between. If you need
to feel alive again, to feel blood
coursing through your veins, air
surging into your lungs and
happiness beating triumphantly
in your hardened heart, steer
yourself away from the medicine
cabinet and over toward the
Geary Theater in San Francisco
to see the American Conservat
ory Theatre production of
Charles Dickens' A Christmas
Carol.
Tuesday night's official open
ing performance was sheer
magic. Director Laird William
son's and writer Dennis Power's
adaptation of Dickens' "ghost
story ot Christmas" gives the old
Yuletide classic a much
appreciated face-lift. Alive with
warmth and humor, the play
sparkles as Scrooge, Hob
Cratchit, the Christmas Ghosts
and the rest of the cast dig deeply
into their characters and bring
this old tale of greed and its con
sequences to life.
William Paterson as tin; in
famous cheapskate gives a
genuinely moving performance.
Though he looks disconcert
ingly like Albert Einstein with
his chaotic thatch of thinning
white hair, the similarity ends
there. Paterson manages to be
the perfect anil complete embod
iment of everything evil and
odious in our society, yet he in
jects enough of the "human"
element into the part that it is
hard not to compare the Scrooge
onstage with that miserly uncle
in Detroit who never sends a
birthday check.
It was interesting to note the
audience reaction to Scrooge;
every "Bah! Humbug!" that
came out of his mouth was met

with a titter of nervous laughter.
Apparently the nefarious
character of Ebeneezer Tightwad
has become so much of a cliche
that, regardless of the talent and
believability of the actor, his
whole attitude is not taken very
seriously.
No prisons
Take, for example, the
beginning where two charit
able businessmen visit Scrooge
in his "counting-house" to col
lect donations for the needy.
Scrooge demands to know why
he should feel obligated to con
tribute. "Are there no prisons?"
he growls. "And the work
houses, are they still in opera
tion?"
The viewers responded to the
warped character of these ques
tions as if it had all been a joke.
When Scrooge asserts that those
in need should die and "de
crease the surplus population,"
there was more laughter.
Now how callous and sadistic
have we become? This irritating
reaction on behalf of the audi
ence leads this reviewer to sadly
assess that the Mr. Magoo ver
sion of A Christmas Carol
that runs on TV every December
has been around too long, mak
ing us immune to Scrooge's de
speration by exhorting us to
laugh at a man we should feel
nothing for but pity.
Comic figure
Though Scrooge unfortu
nately became a kind of comic
figure, the other characters on
the whole fared much, much bet
ter. Particularly outstanding
were the array of spirits sent to
haunt Ebeneezer. Raye Hirk as
Scrooge's seven-years-deceased
business partner, Jacob Marley,
sent so many shivers down the
spines of the audience members
that they actually didn't laugh.
Staggering forward, struggling
to walk in spite of the yards of

chains that bind his arms and
legs, he presents a truly pathetic,
horrifying figure. As he tells
Scrooge that he himself forged
those chains "link by link" dur
ing his life by being such a pen
nypincher, the effect is ghostly
and chilling.
No one can wail, can wrench
out and sustain such a tortuous,
ear-splitting moan like Kaye
Mirk. How it is possible that
sounds like that can emanate
from a human mouth is too un
nerving to think about. Suffice it
to say that Birk did an excep
tional job as Marley's ghost; he
succeeded in giving the audi
ence something they could actu
ally fear instead of something at
which they could blithely laugh.
Electric portrayal
John Hancock's electric por
trayal of the Ghost of Christmas
Present was probably the high
light of the evening. The huge,
hefty actor (who incidently
plays tin; title role in this sea
son's ACT production of
Othello) has such a commanding
presence, he draws all eyes and
attention as if he were a magnet.
Clothed in a flowing, fruited and
enormously bulky red velvet
robe that trails along behind
him, Hancock is the ultimate
"ho-ho-ho"er. With a voice as
big as his body, he literally
seems to fill the stage.
Another outstanding perfor
mance is that of James R. Winker
who plays the bullied and be
leaguered Hob Cratchit. With
quavering voice and long
spindly legs complete with
knocking knees, he performs the
role of Scrooge's timid employe
with refreshing energy.
The set design by Robert
Blackman is a marvel of modern
theater in its simplicity. One
central sort of "thing" serves as
Scrooge's little "counting
house" as well as his bed. With

the exception of this dominating
structure centerstage, the rest
of the space is bare, the actors
using no more than their imagi
nations to conjure up visions of
crowded London streets and
warm family fireplaces.
Lighting
The lighting by F. Mitchell
Dana deserves special note. Its
changes according to the mood
of the moment is nothing short of
magical. For the snowy outdoor
London effect, a thick misted
blue light hangs in the air, a
combination of icy frost and fog
that actually looks cold.
For the scene where Scrooge is
led back into his childhood by
theChost of Christmas Fast (ably
played by Earl Uoen) the lighting
is speckled, an unearthly vision
of swirling snow serving as the
background to which the
Tightwad sees his brief boyhood
flash past. The Ghost of Christ
mas Fast stands off to the side
with his family, the three of them
dressed in traditional costumes
of a muted, silvery white, with
milky, satin-toned make-up on
their staring faces.
This part of the play has
another special surprise, an ab
solutely precious minuet dance'
sequence where Scrooge
watches "old Fezziwig"
(Scrooge's first employer) and
his wife give a festive Christmas
party. Daniel Davis and Marrian
Walters as the Fezziwigs give
charismatic, appealing perfor
mances, inducing us to wonder
just how Scrooge became such
an obnoxious man to work for
when he himself had such an
endearing and enchanting
example to follow.
Led by The Ghost of Christmas
Future, played by Ai White with
Faul liaison, Karen Bebb and
Mark Richardson — the latter
three all children (You must
realize this is a very tall ghost).
Scrooge's foray into the future is
not quite so gay. Fresented with
the vision of Tiny Tim Cratchit's
funeral, Scrooge is beset with
misgivings about his meanness
and begs to be allowed to mend
his ways if it will keep the boy
alive.
Scrooge overcome
Finally, after he is confronted
with a horrible picture of his
own death, Scrooge is overcome
with emotion. "Spirit, leave
me!" he cries. "I am not the
man I was. 1 will not be the man I
must have been!" The set now is
bare, suggesting that as
Scrooge's former counting
house and bed has been stripped
down to a group of support
poles, so has Scrooge been strip
ped of his uncharitable and vio
lently anti-social feelings.

This is no longer the man who
once said "If I could work my
own will, every idiot with
'Merry Christmas!' on his lips
would be boiled in his own pud
ding and buried with a stake of
holly through his heart." This is
no longer Scrooge, the lonely
and embittered old man who
once said "If there is one thing in
this world more ridiculous than
'Merry Christmas,' it's (ailing in
love!" It's clear Scrooge is not
the man he used to be.
The character of Charles Dic
kens, serving as narrator of the
play and performed wonderfully
by Charles Hallahan, weaves in
and out of the story making as
tute observations of the changes
taking place in Scrooge's charac
ter. When he says of Scrooge at
the end that "He knew how to
keep Christmas well," he is apt ly
assessing the New Scrooge.
With ACT's production of A
Christmas Carol keeping the
Christmas Spirit alive and well
in San Francisco, there's no ex
cuse to crawl into your books
and hibernate until it's all over.
It's running all this month and if
you deprive yourself of seeing it.
you're depriving yourself of a
beautiful Christmas story and
one heck of a beautiful ACT pro
duction.


Tiny Tim and company
Tiny Tim (Todd Hurley) draws sympathy from his devoted parents (James R. Winker and
Delores Y. Mitchell). As Bob Cratchit, Winker gives an exceptional performance.
