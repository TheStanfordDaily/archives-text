"Is (iod (I(m<I or alive?" was ii
question often argued in llii!
early 70s. When (.'odspe/l first
appeared oIJ Broadway, Jesus
(.'hi isl hid heen on tin; (;o\ «»r ol
holli Meivsiveek and Time. II
opened lit llii! end ol an era in
\merican society .is iidiisii.il

It is hard to say who won the
orij^i11.11 argument hut it appears
lli.it on the Stanford campus at
least, the pro-Jesus taction has
I»(-'(!11 gaining ground. In our
inidsts there are many Christian
lollowship "roups, and it not
uncommon to meet someone
who lias only recently hegnn to
lollow Jesus Christ. Therefore i!

seems appropriate tli.it (hxls/tnl I
lit; presented to (lit: Stanford
community, as it is a musical
version ol theCospel according
to St. Matthew.
W.itching last Wednesday's
opening ol (,'odspe/J in the ()tero
dining hall, one realized how
lough a play it is to perform, lint
the players, under Simon San
che/.'s direction, projected .i
Inn-loving mood and generated
the feeling ol friendship and
tli.it St. Matthews
(i os| ie| cally lor perhaps this is
the message ol the play itself.
Enormous talent
To do a musical likeCodspe/I
it lakes enormous talent and the
Otero group had it (note Kichard

Kl.irnann who played two in
struments as well as per
formed). II you saw tin! original
show in New York or li you have
listened to the album, it is ohvi
ous that Ihi! Otero players had
the richness ol the original cast
along with .i unique flavor ol its
own.
The acting and singing were
usually superb. The cast ol apos
tles was led by Brad Blake who
played Jesus. Blake had a clear
and beautiful voice which could
be strong and resonant or solt
and mellow, as was exemplified
by "Save the People" and the
"Finale." I lis thoughts and eyes
were often removed from the
apostles emphasizing his dis

tinction from them, but his still
ness .11 times was out ol place.
Tun 11 a rt ley. who played the
|oh n the Baptist/Judas role did so
willi unending energy and emo
tion. lie sang with a lovely,
smooth and powerful voice, par
ticularly on "Prepare Ye."
Sweet accents
When the cast sang together
I hey were fabulous. Teresa Ozoa
added sweet accents to several of
the songs, especially "Day by
Day."(Hertap dancing was quite
good, too). I lowever, 112 he women
singing alone were rather weak.
Some very emotional seen (is
highlighted the play, such as
when the actors near the end
took off their make-up, signal ing

that man too should remove his
phony mask, and also when
Jesus bade his last goodby to
his Iriends .1 very convincing
expression ol allection.
The set design was cleverly
adapted by Kevin Ohlson as
were the costumes by Sandi
Thomas and Simon Sane lie/..
However the lighting by Ted
Bartell and Bill Newcomh was a
little bi iglit at times, though the
crucifixion scene with its
shadows of the fence and cross
was very powerful.
II the audience did not leave
with the message of Christ, they
at least departed with a vision ol
how an excellent play is exe
cuted. Amen.
