# Circle Star: San Carlos hotspot
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
Thirty minutes from
Francisco. .'lO minutes from
the East Hay, 30 minutes
from San Jose would logically he
the prime location tor some
thing. It's San Carlos. Lest you
wonder what San Carlos has to
otter us, more specifically it's the
Circle Star Theatre, that circular,
golden-brick building with its
marquee prominently located at
«i crook i 11 the Bayshore Freeway.
Originally opened tor a tew
years in 1 *H>s. it was closed
down tor a year or two before tin;
present owners. Marquee Enter
prises, took it over in 1071 and
turned it into a Peninsula hot
spot and its parking lot into a sea
ot cars each weekend.
According to Sam Blackford,
ot the Circle Star's public rela

tions department, the road to
success has been a trial-and
error game with the public to sen;
who attracts audiences during
which months of the year.
"It's taken a lot of time to
gauge Bay Area audiences to
find out what people like . . .
There was a time when the
theatre would close down two
mont Its out ot the year, which we
call the 'dark period', lor
maintenance or painting. In the
last year or so, we've been able to
tiiul the right kinds ol acts that
people come to see all year
around instead of just during a
10-month season."
Diversity
As diverse as the Bay Area, the
audiences have been attracted to
an amazing assortment of per
formers. all block-busters in

their fields. Country-western
stars like Charlie Rich and I,as
Vegas performers like Sammy
Davis, Englehert llumperdinck
and Wayne Newton alternate
with rock groups such as Tower
of Power and Cold Blood,
rhythm-and-blues groups like
Smokey Robinson and the Mira
cles and the Sty I istics. and com
edians like deorge Carlin and
bill Cosby.
In his office, the walls of
which are adorned with photo
graphic blow-ups of stars like
Don Rickles, Andy Williams
and l.iberace in performance.
Blackford outlines reasons for
the Circle Star's success in flu;
desolate backwoods of San Car
los. "It's a mixture fit things —
it's a comfortable place. We have
cocktail I oil nues and a restaur

cint, and due to the physical lav
out of the theatre, you're never
more than 22 rows away from the
stage. There are really no bad
seats."
Ot course the same circular
layout that provides excellent
viewing also causes problems,
only one ot many that plague any
theatre management. Some per
formers simply do not I ike work
ing in the round, and since the
Circle Star's stage revolves, it
can be even more disconcerting
to a performer who never ap
preciated merry-go-rounds as a
child to begin with.
Sore customers
Blackford elaborates,
"Whenever you're working with
the public and you're dealing
with so many different kinds of
personalities, it's invariable that
you always come up with <i sore
customer because ot .i bad p.irk
ing place or because they feel
that paying eight dollars is too
much to see an entertainer." It's
actually rather inexpensive
when you consider how much it
would cost to see the same per
former in Vegas, Tahoe or Reno.
On the other side, once a
singer was touring Woodside
and completely forgot about the
show. The general manager w;is
minutes away from canceling
the show and refunding money
when he arrived, averting a situ
ation which, Blackford says, "is
not good fort be reputation of the
theatre."
"We're pretty much in the
middle. If the patrons don't like
it, we get it (the complaints). If
the stars don't like it, we get it.
And if they don't like the pat
rons, we get it. It's a position

where you have to smooth feath
ers and make people as happy as
possible."
Eccentricities
Strangely enough, in the ec
centric world of show business,
most of the eccentricities that
occur at t he Circle Star stem from
the customers rather than the
performers. Blackford tells of
one woman who flew in from
London for the Englebert Hum
peril inek show, buying one tic
ket for each show every night he
performed.
Ot course, there are perfor
mers who rent sailboats to cruise
the Bay .it the rate of $;U)0 per
day, and Bill Cosby commutes
from Los Angeles by plane each
night he performs, but on the
whole. Blackford says, it's pretty
tame.
"A lot of sleeping goes on."
That's in the literal, not the
figurative sense, of course. "The
performers really need .i chance
to rest up. It's not as wild as most
people think. The time in transit
on planes is tiring. And since
we're on the West Coast we get a
lot of people who come from the
Orient and from I lawa ii who are
on tours because this is the next
place to stop. They're concerned
with the changes in food, lime,
and water, so they're more into
relaxing than partying."
Latecomers and troublemak
ers aside, the Circle Star has dis
covered the key to success, and
will continue to bring top-notch
entertainment to the Peninsula
in the future. Upcoming are 8.8.
King and Kav Charles (December
10-12) and the jacksons (De
cember 17-1!)).
