### Cynthia Neil Staff writer 
Associate Professor oi Political
Science David Abernethy and Pro
fessor of Physics Alexander Fetter
have been appointed associate
deans of undergraduate studies
here, Dean Herant Katchadourian
has announced.
Abernethy will be responsible for
accreditation activities of SCIRE,
SYVOPSI, and Undergraduate Spe
cial programs. He said he would
like to expand the links between
these extradepartmental programs
and related courses taught in de
partments, particularly where
students can conduct more effec
tive research.
He said he is also interested in
exploring with faculty the role their
own personal and professional val
ues play in teaching and the extent
to which explicit statements of
these values art;, or ought to be,
conveyed to students.
fetter's principal responsibilities
will include undergraduate advis-

ing and the freshman seminar prog
ram.
Fetter said that the under
graduate studies committee will try
to increase the number of faculty
participating in the freshman semi
nar program by giving them a small
stipend.
Currently, because there are not
enough faculty to teach seminars,
not every freshman who desi res one
is able to take one.
"Ideally." Fetter said,
"everyone who wants one will
be able to take one."
Concerning the Western Civiliza
tion requirement, Fetter said he did
not know what effect the new re
quirement would have on under
graduate studies.
"1 have mixed feelings about the
language requirement." he added.
"The reason for not having a lan
guage requirement is that most stu
dents already studied a language in
high school. I do see the value in
studying a language, but I don't
know if it should bea requirement."
