allegedly interviewed Tuesday night.
Although sources have reportedly
mentioned Cal assistant RogerTheder
for the job. he told the Daily last night
that lie had not been contacted by
Ruetz for a meeting before the commit
tee.
Ruetz has reportedly added a
seventh candidate to the list who,
sources report, will probably be inter
viewed today or tomorrow.
When contacted by the Daily in San
Diego earlier this week, Walsh said,
"I've exchanged remarks with officials
from Stanford. I worked there at one
time, so it's naturally an attractive
job."
II the announcement came this
weekend, it might mean that Walsh is
the man. I le will be in the Bay Area for
Sunday's football game between the
Chargers and the Oakland Raiders.
Walsh, also reportedly a candidate
for the Arizona job, said "Of all the
schools Stanford would be the college
that I would be most interested in."
Walsh is currently offensive coor
dinator for the San Diego Chargers. I le
had been mentioned for the San Diego
bead coaching job. but Charger head
coach Tommy Prothro was given a
vote of confidence by the Charger front

oft ice this week.
Before going ' () iin Diego, Walsh
was quarterback coach and offensive
coordinator under Paul Brown at Cin
cinatti. I le also served as an assistant at
Cal, Stanford and with the Oakland
Raiders.
Walsh was passed over in Cincinatti
for the head coaching job and decided
to go to the San Diego Chargers where
he was reportedly offered $50,()()().
Another contender, Hackett of USC,
has been mentioned for the position
even before Ruetz fired Christiansen.
In his first year at USC, Hackett has
been given a lot of credit for improving
quarterback Vince Evans' poor passing
performance of last season.
But some have said th.it at 29, Hac
kett is too young for a major head
coaching job. However, he is reported
to have the backing of some key south
ern California alumni.
If Hackett gets the Stanford job, two
top high school quarterbacks in the
state have said that they will follow
him here.
Mora, another candidate, is a defen
sive coordinator at Washington and
served as outside linebacker coach at
UCLA last season. He coached at Col
orado for six vears before coining to
UCLA.
