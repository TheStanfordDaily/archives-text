# President asks C-15 to reconvene
## 
### Mike Charlson Staff writer 
In a move which some called sur
prising. President Richard Lyman
asked the Committee of Fifteen (C-15)
to reconvene to discuss "certain items
concerning the student disciplinary
system." Lyman made his request in a
letter received by committee members
last Friday
The C-15 is the body which drafted
and has the power to amend the Legis
lative and judicial Charter of the uni
versity.
The action was apparently promp
ted by a letter to Lyman from the ASSI I
Senate Committee on the C-lf) in
which the committee pointed to seven
specific issues on the Honor Clode and
student discipline which they wanted
tlie (! in to consider.
News ol I .yman's decision brought a
mixed reaction from ASSI) officials.
Surprised reactions
"I am very surprised," ASSI I Presi
dent Vic I'etroff said. He said lit?
thought .1 major factor in Lyman's de
cision was student assurances to
Lyman that the lark of a student major
ity on the Fundamental Standards di
vision of the Student Judicial (Council
|S|C) did not motivate the request to
reconvene;.
ASSI' Senator and (1 I 5 member
Steve Buckley said he was "surprised
.ind happy" with the news because of
tin; "dismal forecast others had given"
of the prospects of Lyman's concurr
ence with tin; senate's feeling on the
matter.
I lowever, Kick I loft, a member of the
Senate Committee on the C IS had a
different reaction. "I'm pleased, but

not surprised," he said. "I felt that it
was clearly in the best interest of stu
dents. faculty and administration to
reconvene and discuss the problems
(in the discipline Charter).
"I think that President Lyman
realizes that the students want to have
a constructive and cooperative discus
sion of problems between these
groups. I'm happy that he is agreeing
with us," Hoft said.
Honor Code education
Among matters cited by the ASSU,
Lyman said he was "particularly con
cerned" that certain aspects of the
I lonor Code here be explored. The Se
nate's letter called for an Honor Code
Committee which would be responsi
ble for "educating the Stanford Com
munity on I lonor Code procedures"
and a discussion of instructor viola
tions ol (lit! code.
The Senate also recommended:

—That the committee discuss a pos
sible option to plead a disciplinary
case before the Dean of Student Affairs
without first having to admit guilt as is
currently required.
—A possible automatic annual meet
ing of C-15 to allow for an annual as
sessment of the workings of the judi
cial system here. According to Hoft
and Buckley, this item is of particular
concern. If a review were initiated,
they say, the committee could possibly
see problems as they arise and counter
them before they became crises. .
Students' own choice
—That the option of a public or pri
vate hearing in a disciplinary matter
before theSJCbe left up to the student.
As matters currently stand, the deci
sion is to be a joint one between the
student and thechairpersonof theSjC.
—That the C-15 re-evaluate the
selection process used to pick student

members of the SJC. On the SJC now,
the three faculty members are chosen
by the Academic Senate, but student
members are chosen from a randomly
•selected pool.
—That the (I-15 look into the possi
bility of more undergraduate and
graduate input into the selection of the
chairperson for the Committee on
Honor Code Violations. The chairper
son has been u student from the Law
School appointed by the president.
Lyman, in his letter, asked the com
mittee to also consider apparent con
fusion in the (-barter "in respect to
whether or not a student involved in u
disciplinary proceeding should be al
lowed an unfettered option for a pri
vate or public disposition."
The first meeting of the C-15 is pre
sently being planned for early winter
quarter, according to James Siena,
legal advisor to tin; president.

In a move which some called sur

asked the Committee of Fifteen (C-15)
to reconvene to discuss "certain items
concerning the student disciplinary

letter received by committee members
last Friday
The C-15 is the body which drafted
and has the power to amend the Legis

versity.
The action was apparently promp
ted by a letter to Lyman from the ASSI I
Senate Committee on the C-lf) in
which the committee pointed to seven
specific issues on the Honor Clode and
student discipline which they wanted
tlie (! in to consider.
News ol I .yman's decision brought a
mixed reaction from ASSI) officials.
Surprised reactions
"I am very surprised," ASSI I Presi
dent Vic I'etroff said. He said lit?
thought .1 major factor in Lyman's de
cision was student assurances to
Lyman that the lark of a student major
ity on the Fundamental Standards di
vision of the Student Judicial (Council
|S|C) did not motivate the request to
reconvene;.
ASSI' Senator and (1 I 5 member
Steve Buckley said he was "surprised
.ind happy" with the news because of
tin; "dismal forecast others had given"
of the prospects of Lyman's concurr
ence with tin; senate's feeling on the
matter.
I lowever, Kick I loft, a member of the
Senate Committee on the C IS had a
different reaction. "I'm pleased, but

not surprised," he said. "I felt that it
was clearly in the best interest of stu
dents. faculty and administration to
reconvene and discuss the problems
(in the discipline Charter).
"I think that President Lyman
realizes that the students want to have
a constructive and cooperative discus
sion of problems between these
groups. I'm happy that he is agreeing
with us," Hoft said.
Honor Code education
Among matters cited by the ASSU,
Lyman said he was "particularly con
cerned" that certain aspects of the
I lonor Code here be explored. The Se
nate's letter called for an Honor Code
Committee which would be responsi
ble for "educating the Stanford Com
munity on I lonor Code procedures"
and a discussion of instructor viola
tions ol (lit! code.
The Senate also recommended:

—That the committee discuss a pos
sible option to plead a disciplinary
case before the Dean of Student Affairs
without first having to admit guilt as is
currently required.
—A possible automatic annual meet
ing of C-15 to allow for an annual as
sessment of the workings of the judi
cial system here. According to Hoft
and Buckley, this item is of particular
concern. If a review were initiated,
they say, the committee could possibly
see problems as they arise and counter
them before they became crises. .
Students' own choice
—That the option of a public or pri
vate hearing in a disciplinary matter
before theSJCbe left up to the student.
As matters currently stand, the deci
sion is to be a joint one between the
student and thechairpersonof theSjC.
