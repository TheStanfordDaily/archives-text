Today's Daily is the last paper until
Jan. 3, 1977. The staffers of the
Daily wish each and everyone a happy
holiday season and the best of luck on
finals.
Correction
In connection with Palo Alto's
moratorium on new installation of
pinball machines, the Oct. 27 Daily
should have reported that Palo Alto
City Councilman John Berwald made
reference to the "filthiest kinds of bes
tialities" and "absolute perversion" of
a coinic book store, not of pinball halls,
at the council meeting the preceding
night.
