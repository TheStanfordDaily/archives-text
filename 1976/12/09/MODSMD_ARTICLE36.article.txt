NATO's air defense system stalled
Brussels — Defense ministers of the North Atlantic al
liance agreed yesterday that they need to upgrade their
aging air defense systems. But West German political
problems delayed a final decision on an American
proposed $2.5 billion airborne early warning system.
A communique at the end of the two-day NATO meet
ing said "112 inancial aspects" would be taken up by experts
in January with a final decision left up to the defense
ministers.
Joseph I.uns, the alliance's secretary general, said "a
slight possibility" remained that the system would not be
adopted. But U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
said he was "very encouraged" by the outcome of the
meeting.
Soviets interested in trade with U.S.
Moscow — The Soviets are sending strong signals to

Washington during the White House transition period
that they want to rekindle dampened trade relations de
spite Kremlin assertions not long ago that Russia can
thrive without American business.
The Soviet message is not new in substance but it seems
to carry a sense of urgency and accommodation not seen
here since trade detente collapsed in early 15)75. The es
sence is that Moscow would like to do real business with
America if Congress will only repeal the trade law, which
is regarded here as a slap in the face.
In return tor repeal of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to
the 1974 Trade Act, the Soviets have hinted that they may
ease some of their traditionally awkward business prac
tices and turn this country into a more profitable market
for Uncle Sam.
