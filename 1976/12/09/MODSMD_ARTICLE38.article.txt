# City council votes to end contract with drug program
## 
### Lonnie Rosenwald Staff writer 
The Palo Alto City Council voted Monday night to can
cel its contract with Narconon, a private drug treatment
program which was hired by the city just 10 months ago.
The 6-1 vote reflected the council's feeling that Narco
non has failed to meet the terms of the contract by refusing
to include laymen from the community on its board of
directors.
In a letter to the city staff. Narconon's Palo Alto director,
Nate Jessup, said the national Narconon organization op
posed inclusion of community members on the board
because they would not be familiar with the "technical
procedures" of the treatment.
{lowever, the surface issue was complicated by charges
of religious discrimination and politicking.
Critics of Narconon have gone beyond the board of
directors issue, and even the program's effectiveness to
charge that Narconon is connected to the Church of Scien
tology. Narconon's defenders have blamed the press for
fueling these charges.
'Religious discrimination'
"What we have here is a case of religious discrimina
tion," testified Peter Drusts, president of the national Nar
conon office. "The city council has been pressured into
the view it's adopting here tonight. I think the press has
had a lot to do with that."
Mike Fox, a representative of the Collective, the drug
treatment program which lost out to Narconon in its at
tempt to renew a contract with the city last spring, called
Narconon "an embarrassment" to members of the city
council.
Several council members had promised to dump the
Collective and support Narconon during election cam
pagns last May. However, the council seems now nearly

unanimous that Narconon has not met the conditions of
the contract, and further that the Santa Clara County
should assume responsibility for drug abuse treatment.
"There is an obligation with respect to that money,"
said Councilman Scott Carey. Referring in particular to
the board of directors issue, Carey asserted. "Those condi
tions haven't been met."
County's responsibility
"Drug treatment on a monumental scale is not the re
sponsibility of a municipality but is a regional responsi
bility," said Councilman John Beahrs.
Councilman John Herwald acknowledged that "drug
abuse is a serious disease in our community." He said it
should be "a priority of the County drug program to have a
north county program."
Claire Smith, former staff member of the Collective, said
"I oppose the attempt of the council to end the issue of
drug abuse there .. . the people of this community
need it."
Richard Hamilton, a drug abuse counselor from the
Mountain View Methadone Program, told the council, "If
the city council chooses not to fund a drug abuse program,
there will be no program." He echoed the testimony of
others that the county would not provide funds or prog
rams for the treatment of drug abuse in Palo Alto.
But Berwald claimed "There are some unappropriated
funds available" in the county.
Several of Narconon's former clients asked the council
to consider the quality, not quantity, of the treatment.
"Narconon has helped me," said ex-addict Charles
Ernst. "The people really care."
City records show that Narconon has treated only seven
people in the past 10 months. "If Narconon only treated
seven people and they effectively treated them, it's worth
it," said Berwald.

funds available" in the county.
Several of Narconon's former clients asked the council
to consider the quality, not quantity, of the treatment.
"Narconon has helped me," said ex-addict Charles
Ernst. "The people really care."
City records show that Narconon has treated only seven
people in the past 10 months. "If Narconon only treated
seven people and they effectively treated them, it's worth
it," said Berwald.
The Palo Alto City Council voted Monday night to can
cel its contract with Narconon, a private drug treatment
program which was hired by the city just 10 months ago.
The 6-1 vote reflected the council's feeling that Narco
non has failed to meet the terms of the contract by refusing
to include laymen from the community on its board of
directors.
In a letter to the city staff. Narconon's Palo Alto director,
Nate Jessup, said the national Narconon organization op
posed inclusion of community members on the board
because they would not be familiar with the "technical
procedures" of the treatment.
{lowever, the surface issue was complicated by charges
of religious discrimination and politicking.
Critics of Narconon have gone beyond the board of
directors issue, and even the program's effectiveness to
charge that Narconon is connected to the Church of Scien
tology. Narconon's defenders have blamed the press for
fueling these charges.
'Religious discrimination'
"What we have here is a case of religious discrimina
tion," testified Peter Drusts, president of the national Nar
conon office. "The city council has been pressured into
the view it's adopting here tonight. I think the press has
had a lot to do with that."
Mike Fox, a representative of the Collective, the drug
treatment program which lost out to Narconon in its at
tempt to renew a contract with the city last spring, called
Narconon "an embarrassment" to members of the city
council.
Several council members had promised to dump the
Collective and support Narconon during election cam
pagns last May. However, the council seems now nearly

unanimous that Narconon has not met the conditions of
the contract, and further that the Santa Clara County
should assume responsibility for drug abuse treatment.
"There is an obligation with respect to that money,"
said Councilman Scott Carey. Referring in particular to
the board of directors issue, Carey asserted. "Those condi
tions haven't been met."
County's responsibility
"Drug treatment on a monumental scale is not the re
sponsibility of a municipality but is a regional responsi
bility," said Councilman John Beahrs.
Councilman John Herwald acknowledged that "drug
abuse is a serious disease in our community." He said it
should be "a priority of the County drug program to have a
north county program."
Claire Smith, former staff member of the Collective, said
"I oppose the attempt of the council to end the issue of
drug abuse there .. . the people of this community
need it."
Richard Hamilton, a drug abuse counselor from the
Mountain View Methadone Program, told the council, "If
the city council chooses not to fund a drug abuse program,
there will be no program." He echoed the testimony of
others that the county would not provide funds or prog
rams for the treatment of drug abuse in Palo Alto.
But Berwald claimed "There are some unappropriated
funds available" in the county.
