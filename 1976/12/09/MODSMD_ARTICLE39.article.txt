# Transsexuals fulfill lifelong dream through surgery at Stanford Hospital

Sugan 'n' spice and everything nice was yes
teryear's classic recipe for little girls, but today's
woman is apt to be made of sturdier stuff. In fact,
today's woman, thanks to Stanford's Depart
ment of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, may
have been yesterday's man.
Sex-change surgery is nothing new — George
Jorgensen became Christine in Sweden 25 years
.igo. But the recent press play given two former
transsexuals, New York ophthalmologist Renee
Richards and Bay Area teacher Steve Dain, has
piqued public curiosity and multiplied in
quiries — sincere and otherwise — at the several
gender clinics around the country.
Many transsexuals, however, dread such pub
licity. Unlike the gay movement and the wo
men's movement, which demand public aware
ness and acceptance of a long list of social and
legal rights, transsexuals claim only one — the
right to live privately and completely in the
body of their choice.
Classification
Only in the past quarter-century has medical
research sought to classify and characterize this
disorder. Harry Benjamin, who pioneered the
investigation of transsexualism in the United
States, defines the phenomenon simply as "that
of anatomic males feeling themselves to be
women and wanting to be women" and vice
versa.
A diagnostic definition of transsexualism is
much more complex, however. The Benjamin
transsexual differs sharply from thetransvestite,
who derives erotic pleasure from periodically
dressing in clothes of the opposite sex. The
transsexual cross-dresses simply because he is
more comfortable that way.
Kven more confusing is the transsexual's
seemingly homosexual choice of partner, since
most transsexuals express scorn and disgust for
homosexuality. But for the man who thinks he is
.1 woman, the choice of a male partner is a logi
cal. heterosexual one.
Though research has produced a viable defini
tion of the problem, it stops short of locating a
cause. No one seems to know what sociological
or biological factors combine to produce the
transsexual, but theories are rampant and var
ied. The early literature emphasized the
sociological determinants and even recon
structed from hundreds of case studies a
stereotypical transsexual upbringing.
According to some theories, the male trans
sexual typically has a dominant bisexual mother
and a passive or frequently absent father The

wife often shifts all her affection and attention
from her husband to her son, which results in a
stiflingly close, Oedipal type of physical and
emotional attachment.
The transsexual's earliest memories are of
"imitating mommy," dressing ir her high heels,
adopting the female role in all play activity and
fantasy and rejecting all rough-and-tumble
sports or "typically boyish" pastimes. This pat
tern proves difficult or impossible to break once
begun.
Similar history
Yet homosexuals, transvestites and other
"gender dysphorics" often report a similar his
tory, reminds Marty Norberg. an assistant at
Stanford's Gender Dysphoria Clinic. In addition,
many of today's transsexuals come from a stable,
normal, family environment. Thus, trans
sexualism. as distinct from other gender prob
lems. results in part from other less sociologi
cally oriented determinants.
Norman Fisk. chief psychiatrist at the clinic
here, reports that while he felt his patients' prob
lems were "obviously psychological at first,"
recent evidence "speaks strongly for a biological
determinant."
He cites Richard Green's widely reported ef
forts to reprogram children with transsexual
tendencies as "discouraging" even at the ear
liest ages. These indications lend credence. Fisk

believes, to the theories which blame prenatal
hormone secretions for the gender confusion.
While researchers handled the "what" of
transsexualism and psychiatrists grappled with
the "why," surgeons perfected the practical
"how" of the sex change itself.
for the "basic female" (anatomic male),
treatment begins with an estrogen prescription
to induce breast growth and 150 to 200 hours of
electrolysis to remove facial hair. The treatment
concludes with a range of surgical options —
from a simple penectomy and castration to con
struction of a vagina, breast augmentation, nasal
reduction and ear flattening.
A patient can easily spend $7000. a cost oi
which Medicare and insurance cover little if
any. The surgical results are increasingly satis
factory; some of these "new women" claim to
experience orgasm and other have even boasted
of "fooling their gynecologists."
The female-to-male change, on the other
hand, is still in the experimental stageand much
more demanding on both the patient and the
surgeon. Hormone treatment deepens the voice
and produces facial hair, but it rarely reduces
breast size. Instead, most basic; males undergo
mastectomy, in addition to a hysterectomy and a
two-stage operation for construction of a phal
lus.
