# Transsexuals fulfill lifelong dream through surgery at Stanford Hospital
## 
### Janet Kessel 
Sugan 'n' spice and everything nice was yes
teryear's classic recipe for little girls, but today's
woman is apt to be made of sturdier stuff. In fact,
today's woman, thanks to Stanford's Depart
ment of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, may
have been yesterday's man.
Sex-change surgery is nothing new — George
Jorgensen became Christine in Sweden 25 years
.igo. But the recent press play given two former
transsexuals, New York ophthalmologist Renee
Richards and Bay Area teacher Steve Dain, has
piqued public curiosity and multiplied in
quiries — sincere and otherwise — at the several
gender clinics around the country.
Many transsexuals, however, dread such pub
licity. Unlike the gay movement and the wo
men's movement, which demand public aware
ness and acceptance of a long list of social and
legal rights, transsexuals claim only one — the
right to live privately and completely in the
body of their choice.
Classification
Only in the past quarter-century has medical
research sought to classify and characterize this
disorder. Harry Benjamin, who pioneered the
investigation of transsexualism in the United
States, defines the phenomenon simply as "that
of anatomic males feeling themselves to be
women and wanting to be women" and vice
versa.
A diagnostic definition of transsexualism is
much more complex, however. The Benjamin
transsexual differs sharply from thetransvestite,
who derives erotic pleasure from periodically
dressing in clothes of the opposite sex. The
transsexual cross-dresses simply because he is
more comfortable that way.
Kven more confusing is the transsexual's
seemingly homosexual choice of partner, since
most transsexuals express scorn and disgust for
homosexuality. But for the man who thinks he is
.1 woman, the choice of a male partner is a logi
cal. heterosexual one.
Though research has produced a viable defini
tion of the problem, it stops short of locating a
cause. No one seems to know what sociological
or biological factors combine to produce the
transsexual, but theories are rampant and var
ied. The early literature emphasized the
sociological determinants and even recon
structed from hundreds of case studies a
stereotypical transsexual upbringing.
According to some theories, the male trans
sexual typically has a dominant bisexual mother
and a passive or frequently absent father The

wife often shifts all her affection and attention
from her husband to her son, which results in a
stiflingly close, Oedipal type of physical and
emotional attachment.
The transsexual's earliest memories are of
"imitating mommy," dressing ir her high heels,
adopting the female role in all play activity and
fantasy and rejecting all rough-and-tumble
sports or "typically boyish" pastimes. This pat
tern proves difficult or impossible to break once
begun.
Similar history
Yet homosexuals, transvestites and other
"gender dysphorics" often report a similar his
tory, reminds Marty Norberg. an assistant at
Stanford's Gender Dysphoria Clinic. In addition,
many of today's transsexuals come from a stable,
normal, family environment. Thus, trans
sexualism. as distinct from other gender prob
lems. results in part from other less sociologi
cally oriented determinants.
Norman Fisk. chief psychiatrist at the clinic
here, reports that while he felt his patients' prob
lems were "obviously psychological at first,"
recent evidence "speaks strongly for a biological
determinant."
He cites Richard Green's widely reported ef
forts to reprogram children with transsexual
tendencies as "discouraging" even at the ear
liest ages. These indications lend credence. Fisk

believes, to the theories which blame prenatal
hormone secretions for the gender confusion.
While researchers handled the "what" of
transsexualism and psychiatrists grappled with
the "why," surgeons perfected the practical
"how" of the sex change itself.
for the "basic female" (anatomic male),
treatment begins with an estrogen prescription
to induce breast growth and 150 to 200 hours of
electrolysis to remove facial hair. The treatment
concludes with a range of surgical options —
from a simple penectomy and castration to con
struction of a vagina, breast augmentation, nasal
reduction and ear flattening.
A patient can easily spend $7000. a cost oi
which Medicare and insurance cover little if
any. The surgical results are increasingly satis
factory; some of these "new women" claim to
experience orgasm and other have even boasted
of "fooling their gynecologists."
The female-to-male change, on the other
hand, is still in the experimental stageand much
more demanding on both the patient and the
surgeon. Hormone treatment deepens the voice
and produces facial hair, but it rarely reduces
breast size. Instead, most basic; males undergo
mastectomy, in addition to a hysterectomy and a
two-stage operation for construction of a phal
lus.

While sex changes are cur
rently performed at several uni
versity hospitals around the
country, the Stanford Cender
Dysphoria I'rogram, headed by
Fisk and surgeon Donald Laub,
is certainly revolutionary in its
approach to the operation.
Previously, only "classic lien
jaminian transsexuals" wt;re
considered suitable candidates
for surgery, and any transvestite
or effeminate homosexual who
requested it was categorically
denied the operation. The staff
here, in reaction to the many
non-transsexuals who desired a
sex change, coined the term
"gender dysphoria" to describe
those whose common de
nominator, according to Laub
and Fisk, is "displeasure with
the sex of their genital
a natomy."
In effect, therefore, any gender
dysphoric who desires a sex
change is a candidate for Stan
ford's Cender Identity Clinic and
eventual surgery. Only the obvi
ous psychotic is eliminated. Hut
the prerequisites for surgery are
so stringent that many candi
dates disqualify themselves, and
only the most motivated termi
nate the program in a new body.
In particular, the patient must
undergo psychiatric testing and
hormonal treatment; he must not
he married in the uender of his

anatomy; and most difficult of
all, he must complete at least one
year, and more probably two or
three, cross-living and working
in the chosen gender.
Many of these patients exhibit
amazing success and adjustment
in their cross-living; Stanford's
group of basic females at one
time included a Vogue model.
Others never achieve the pre
requisite stability in social,
psychological, sexual, or
employment spheres, and their
request for surgery receives a
terse, "Not yet." Included in this
group is the "professional trans
sexual," who, says Dr. Fisk, typ
ically plans to write a best-seller
about his transformation or
make a fortune on the stage as
"Sex-Change Sally."
The professional transsexual
never makes it very far, though.
"We throw a lot of stumbling
blocks in their path, and we do it
deliberately," says a counselor
for the program here who un
derwent a sex change himself
several years ago. "It's too seri
ous a surgery to fool around
with," he adds.
For those who do "make it,"
on the other hand, the clinic
provides invaluable services, in
cluding grooming workships,
legal aid, and vocational coun
seling.
Does a sex-change actually
improve the transsexual's life? A

reliable indication comes from
the approximately 180 patients
"converted" since 19b8; in gen
eral, they've expressed no re
grets. And the two patients who
have since surgically reverted to
their original sex? "Well," says
Dr. Fisk, "they have no regrets
either. It was just something they
had to do."
Yet the most moving and sin
cere testimony to the treatment
comes from the counselor with
the program who, after fifteen
years of cross-living, became
anatomically the male he had
claimed to be psychologically
for forty years. Now married, with
adopted children and grand
children, he admits, "Yes. 1
could have lived without the
surgery, but I couldn't live with
out being a man. I just don't
know any other way." Thanks to
modern research, now he can do
more than live like a man — he
can look like one, too.

Sugan 'n' spice and everything nice was yes
teryear's classic recipe for little girls, but today's
woman is apt to be made of sturdier stuff. In fact,
today's woman, thanks to Stanford's Depart
ment of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, may
have been yesterday's man.
Sex-change surgery is nothing new — George
Jorgensen became Christine in Sweden 25 years
.igo. But the recent press play given two former
transsexuals, New York ophthalmologist Renee
Richards and Bay Area teacher Steve Dain, has
piqued public curiosity and multiplied in
quiries — sincere and otherwise — at the several
gender clinics around the country.
Many transsexuals, however, dread such pub
licity. Unlike the gay movement and the wo
men's movement, which demand public aware
ness and acceptance of a long list of social and
legal rights, transsexuals claim only one — the
right to live privately and completely in the
body of their choice.
Classification
Only in the past quarter-century has medical
research sought to classify and characterize this
disorder. Harry Benjamin, who pioneered the
investigation of transsexualism in the United
States, defines the phenomenon simply as "that
of anatomic males feeling themselves to be
women and wanting to be women" and vice
versa.
A diagnostic definition of transsexualism is
much more complex, however. The Benjamin
transsexual differs sharply from thetransvestite,
who derives erotic pleasure from periodically
dressing in clothes of the opposite sex. The
transsexual cross-dresses simply because he is
more comfortable that way.
Kven more confusing is the transsexual's
seemingly homosexual choice of partner, since
most transsexuals express scorn and disgust for
homosexuality. But for the man who thinks he is
.1 woman, the choice of a male partner is a logi
cal. heterosexual one.
Though research has produced a viable defini
tion of the problem, it stops short of locating a
cause. No one seems to know what sociological
or biological factors combine to produce the
transsexual, but theories are rampant and var
ied. The early literature emphasized the
sociological determinants and even recon
structed from hundreds of case studies a
stereotypical transsexual upbringing.
According to some theories, the male trans
sexual typically has a dominant bisexual mother
and a passive or frequently absent father The

wife often shifts all her affection and attention
from her husband to her son, which results in a
stiflingly close, Oedipal type of physical and
emotional attachment.
The transsexual's earliest memories are of
"imitating mommy," dressing ir her high heels,
adopting the female role in all play activity and
fantasy and rejecting all rough-and-tumble
sports or "typically boyish" pastimes. This pat
tern proves difficult or impossible to break once
begun.
Similar history
Yet homosexuals, transvestites and other
"gender dysphorics" often report a similar his
tory, reminds Marty Norberg. an assistant at
Stanford's Gender Dysphoria Clinic. In addition,
many of today's transsexuals come from a stable,
normal, family environment. Thus, trans
sexualism. as distinct from other gender prob
lems. results in part from other less sociologi
cally oriented determinants.
Norman Fisk. chief psychiatrist at the clinic
here, reports that while he felt his patients' prob
lems were "obviously psychological at first,"
recent evidence "speaks strongly for a biological
determinant."
He cites Richard Green's widely reported ef
forts to reprogram children with transsexual
tendencies as "discouraging" even at the ear
liest ages. These indications lend credence. Fisk

believes, to the theories which blame prenatal
hormone secretions for the gender confusion.
While researchers handled the "what" of
transsexualism and psychiatrists grappled with
the "why," surgeons perfected the practical
"how" of the sex change itself.
for the "basic female" (anatomic male),
treatment begins with an estrogen prescription
to induce breast growth and 150 to 200 hours of
electrolysis to remove facial hair. The treatment
concludes with a range of surgical options —
from a simple penectomy and castration to con
struction of a vagina, breast augmentation, nasal
reduction and ear flattening.
A patient can easily spend $7000. a cost oi
which Medicare and insurance cover little if
any. The surgical results are increasingly satis
factory; some of these "new women" claim to
experience orgasm and other have even boasted
of "fooling their gynecologists."
The female-to-male change, on the other
hand, is still in the experimental stageand much
more demanding on both the patient and the
surgeon. Hormone treatment deepens the voice
and produces facial hair, but it rarely reduces
breast size. Instead, most basic; males undergo
mastectomy, in addition to a hysterectomy and a
two-stage operation for construction of a phal
lus.

While sex changes are cur
rently performed at several uni
versity hospitals around the
country, the Stanford Cender
Dysphoria I'rogram, headed by
Fisk and surgeon Donald Laub,
is certainly revolutionary in its
approach to the operation.
Previously, only "classic lien
jaminian transsexuals" wt;re
considered suitable candidates
for surgery, and any transvestite
or effeminate homosexual who
requested it was categorically
denied the operation. The staff
here, in reaction to the many
non-transsexuals who desired a
sex change, coined the term
"gender dysphoria" to describe
those whose common de
nominator, according to Laub
and Fisk, is "displeasure with
the sex of their genital
a natomy."
In effect, therefore, any gender
dysphoric who desires a sex
change is a candidate for Stan
ford's Cender Identity Clinic and
eventual surgery. Only the obvi
ous psychotic is eliminated. Hut
the prerequisites for surgery are
so stringent that many candi
dates disqualify themselves, and
only the most motivated termi
nate the program in a new body.
In particular, the patient must
undergo psychiatric testing and
hormonal treatment; he must not
he married in the uender of his

anatomy; and most difficult of
all, he must complete at least one
year, and more probably two or
three, cross-living and working
in the chosen gender.
Many of these patients exhibit
amazing success and adjustment
in their cross-living; Stanford's
group of basic females at one
time included a Vogue model.
Others never achieve the pre
requisite stability in social,
psychological, sexual, or
employment spheres, and their
request for surgery receives a
terse, "Not yet." Included in this
group is the "professional trans
sexual," who, says Dr. Fisk, typ
ically plans to write a best-seller
about his transformation or
make a fortune on the stage as
"Sex-Change Sally."
The professional transsexual
never makes it very far, though.
"We throw a lot of stumbling
blocks in their path, and we do it
deliberately," says a counselor
for the program here who un
derwent a sex change himself
several years ago. "It's too seri
ous a surgery to fool around
with," he adds.

he married in the uender of his

anatomy; and most difficult of
all, he must complete at least one
year, and more probably two or
three, cross-living and working
in the chosen gender.
Many of these patients exhibit
amazing success and adjustment
in their cross-living; Stanford's
group of basic females at one
time included a Vogue model.
Others never achieve the pre

psychological, sexual, or
employment spheres, and their

"We throw a lot of stumbling

for the program here who un
derwent a sex change himself
several years ago. "It's too seri

with," he adds.

Does a sex-change actually
improve the transsexual's life? A

reliable indication comes from
the approximately 180 patients
"converted" since 19b8; in gen

their original sex? "Well," says
Dr. Fisk, "they have no regrets

had to do."
Yet the most moving and sin
cere testimony to the treatment
comes from the counselor with
the program who, after fifteen
years of cross-living, became
anatomically the male he had
claimed to be psychologically
for forty years. Now married, with
adopted children and grand
children, he admits, "Yes. 1
could have lived without the
surgery, but I couldn't live with
out being a man. I just don't
know any other way." Thanks to
modern research, now he can do
more than live like a man — he
can look like one, too.

Sugan 'n' spice and everything nice was yes
teryear's classic recipe for little girls, but today's
woman is apt to be made of sturdier stuff. In fact,
today's woman, thanks to Stanford's Depart
ment of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, may
have been yesterday's man.
Sex-change surgery is nothing new — George
Jorgensen became Christine in Sweden 25 years
.igo. But the recent press play given two former
transsexuals, New York ophthalmologist Renee
Richards and Bay Area teacher Steve Dain, has
piqued public curiosity and multiplied in
quiries — sincere and otherwise — at the several
gender clinics around the country.
Many transsexuals, however, dread such pub
licity. Unlike the gay movement and the wo
men's movement, which demand public aware
ness and acceptance of a long list of social and
legal rights, transsexuals claim only one — the
right to live privately and completely in the
body of their choice.
Classification
Only in the past quarter-century has medical
research sought to classify and characterize this
disorder. Harry Benjamin, who pioneered the
investigation of transsexualism in the United
States, defines the phenomenon simply as "that
of anatomic males feeling themselves to be
women and wanting to be women" and vice
versa.
A diagnostic definition of transsexualism is
much more complex, however. The Benjamin
transsexual differs sharply from thetransvestite,
who derives erotic pleasure from periodically
dressing in clothes of the opposite sex. The
transsexual cross-dresses simply because he is
more comfortable that way.
Kven more confusing is the transsexual's
seemingly homosexual choice of partner, since
most transsexuals express scorn and disgust for
homosexuality. But for the man who thinks he is
.1 woman, the choice of a male partner is a logi
cal. heterosexual one.
Though research has produced a viable defini
tion of the problem, it stops short of locating a
cause. No one seems to know what sociological
or biological factors combine to produce the
transsexual, but theories are rampant and var
ied. The early literature emphasized the
sociological determinants and even recon
structed from hundreds of case studies a
stereotypical transsexual upbringing.
According to some theories, the male trans
sexual typically has a dominant bisexual mother
and a passive or frequently absent father The

wife often shifts all her affection and attention
from her husband to her son, which results in a
stiflingly close, Oedipal type of physical and
emotional attachment.
The transsexual's earliest memories are of
"imitating mommy," dressing ir her high heels,
adopting the female role in all play activity and
fantasy and rejecting all rough-and-tumble
sports or "typically boyish" pastimes. This pat
tern proves difficult or impossible to break once
begun.
Similar history
Yet homosexuals, transvestites and other
"gender dysphorics" often report a similar his
tory, reminds Marty Norberg. an assistant at
Stanford's Gender Dysphoria Clinic. In addition,
many of today's transsexuals come from a stable,
normal, family environment. Thus, trans
sexualism. as distinct from other gender prob
lems. results in part from other less sociologi
cally oriented determinants.
Norman Fisk. chief psychiatrist at the clinic
here, reports that while he felt his patients' prob
lems were "obviously psychological at first,"
recent evidence "speaks strongly for a biological
determinant."
He cites Richard Green's widely reported ef
forts to reprogram children with transsexual
tendencies as "discouraging" even at the ear
liest ages. These indications lend credence. Fisk

believes, to the theories which blame prenatal
hormone secretions for the gender confusion.
While researchers handled the "what" of
transsexualism and psychiatrists grappled with
the "why," surgeons perfected the practical
"how" of the sex change itself.
for the "basic female" (anatomic male),
treatment begins with an estrogen prescription
to induce breast growth and 150 to 200 hours of
electrolysis to remove facial hair. The treatment
concludes with a range of surgical options —
from a simple penectomy and castration to con
struction of a vagina, breast augmentation, nasal
reduction and ear flattening.
A patient can easily spend $7000. a cost oi
which Medicare and insurance cover little if
any. The surgical results are increasingly satis
factory; some of these "new women" claim to
experience orgasm and other have even boasted
of "fooling their gynecologists."
The female-to-male change, on the other
hand, is still in the experimental stageand much
more demanding on both the patient and the
surgeon. Hormone treatment deepens the voice
and produces facial hair, but it rarely reduces
breast size. Instead, most basic; males undergo
mastectomy, in addition to a hysterectomy and a
two-stage operation for construction of a phal
lus.

While sex changes are cur
rently performed at several uni
versity hospitals around the
country, the Stanford Cender
Dysphoria I'rogram, headed by
Fisk and surgeon Donald Laub,
is certainly revolutionary in its
approach to the operation.
Previously, only "classic lien
jaminian transsexuals" wt;re
considered suitable candidates
for surgery, and any transvestite
or effeminate homosexual who
requested it was categorically
denied the operation. The staff
here, in reaction to the many
non-transsexuals who desired a
sex change, coined the term
"gender dysphoria" to describe
those whose common de
nominator, according to Laub
and Fisk, is "displeasure with
the sex of their genital
a natomy."
In effect, therefore, any gender
dysphoric who desires a sex
change is a candidate for Stan
ford's Cender Identity Clinic and
eventual surgery. Only the obvi
ous psychotic is eliminated. Hut
the prerequisites for surgery are
so stringent that many candi
dates disqualify themselves, and
only the most motivated termi

rently performed at several uni
versity hospitals around the
country, the Stanford Cender
Dysphoria I'rogram, headed by
Fisk and surgeon Donald Laub,
is certainly revolutionary in its
approach to the operation.
Previously, only "classic lien
jaminian transsexuals" wt;re
considered suitable candidates
for surgery, and any transvestite
or effeminate homosexual who
requested it was categorically
denied the operation. The staff
here, in reaction to the many
non-transsexuals who desired a
sex change, coined the term
"gender dysphoria" to describe
those whose common de
nominator, according to Laub
and Fisk, is "displeasure with
the sex of their genital
a natomy."
In effect, therefore, any gender
dysphoric who desires a sex
change is a candidate for Stan
ford's Cender Identity Clinic and
eventual surgery. Only the obvi
ous psychotic is eliminated. Hut
the prerequisites for surgery are
so stringent that many candi
dates disqualify themselves, and
only the most motivated termi
nate the program in a new body.
In particular, the patient must
undergo psychiatric testing and
hormonal treatment; he must not
he married in the uender of his

anatomy; and most difficult of
all, he must complete at least one
year, and more probably two or
three, cross-living and working
in the chosen gender.
Many of these patients exhibit
amazing success and adjustment
in their cross-living; Stanford's
group of basic females at one
time included a Vogue model.
Others never achieve the pre
requisite stability in social,
psychological, sexual, or
employment spheres, and their
request for surgery receives a
terse, "Not yet." Included in this
group is the "professional trans
sexual," who, says Dr. Fisk, typ
ically plans to write a best-seller
about his transformation or
make a fortune on the stage as
"Sex-Change Sally."
The professional transsexual
never makes it very far, though.
"We throw a lot of stumbling
blocks in their path, and we do it
deliberately," says a counselor
for the program here who un
derwent a sex change himself
several years ago. "It's too seri
ous a surgery to fool around
with," he adds.
For those who do "make it,"
on the other hand, the clinic
provides invaluable services, in
cluding grooming workships,
legal aid, and vocational coun
seling.
Does a sex-change actually
improve the transsexual's life? A

reliable indication comes from
the approximately 180 patients
"converted" since 19b8; in gen
eral, they've expressed no re
grets. And the two patients who
have since surgically reverted to
their original sex? "Well," says
Dr. Fisk, "they have no regrets
either. It was just something they
had to do."
Yet the most moving and sin
cere testimony to the treatment
comes from the counselor with
the program who, after fifteen
years of cross-living, became
anatomically the male he had
claimed to be psychologically
for forty years. Now married, with
adopted children and grand
children, he admits, "Yes. 1
could have lived without the
surgery, but I couldn't live with
out being a man. I just don't
know any other way." Thanks to
modern research, now he can do
more than live like a man — he
can look like one, too.

Sugan 'n' spice and everything nice was yes
teryear's classic recipe for little girls, but today's
woman is apt to be made of sturdier stuff. In fact,
today's woman, thanks to Stanford's Depart
ment of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, may
have been yesterday's man.
Sex-change surgery is nothing new — George
Jorgensen became Christine in Sweden 25 years
.igo. But the recent press play given two former
transsexuals, New York ophthalmologist Renee
Richards and Bay Area teacher Steve Dain, has
piqued public curiosity and multiplied in
quiries — sincere and otherwise — at the several
gender clinics around the country.
Many transsexuals, however, dread such pub
licity. Unlike the gay movement and the wo
men's movement, which demand public aware
ness and acceptance of a long list of social and
legal rights, transsexuals claim only one — the
right to live privately and completely in the
body of their choice.
Classification
Only in the past quarter-century has medical
research sought to classify and characterize this
disorder. Harry Benjamin, who pioneered the
investigation of transsexualism in the United
States, defines the phenomenon simply as "that
of anatomic males feeling themselves to be
women and wanting to be women" and vice
versa.
A diagnostic definition of transsexualism is
much more complex, however. The Benjamin
transsexual differs sharply from thetransvestite,
who derives erotic pleasure from periodically
dressing in clothes of the opposite sex. The
transsexual cross-dresses simply because he is
more comfortable that way.
Kven more confusing is the transsexual's
seemingly homosexual choice of partner, since
most transsexuals express scorn and disgust for
homosexuality. But for the man who thinks he is
.1 woman, the choice of a male partner is a logi
cal. heterosexual one.
Though research has produced a viable defini
tion of the problem, it stops short of locating a
cause. No one seems to know what sociological
or biological factors combine to produce the
transsexual, but theories are rampant and var
ied. The early literature emphasized the
sociological determinants and even recon
structed from hundreds of case studies a
stereotypical transsexual upbringing.
According to some theories, the male trans
sexual typically has a dominant bisexual mother
and a passive or frequently absent father The

wife often shifts all her affection and attention
from her husband to her son, which results in a
stiflingly close, Oedipal type of physical and
emotional attachment.
The transsexual's earliest memories are of
"imitating mommy," dressing ir her high heels,
adopting the female role in all play activity and
fantasy and rejecting all rough-and-tumble
sports or "typically boyish" pastimes. This pat
tern proves difficult or impossible to break once
begun.
Similar history
Yet homosexuals, transvestites and other
"gender dysphorics" often report a similar his
tory, reminds Marty Norberg. an assistant at
Stanford's Gender Dysphoria Clinic. In addition,
many of today's transsexuals come from a stable,
normal, family environment. Thus, trans
sexualism. as distinct from other gender prob
lems. results in part from other less sociologi
cally oriented determinants.
Norman Fisk. chief psychiatrist at the clinic
here, reports that while he felt his patients' prob
lems were "obviously psychological at first,"
recent evidence "speaks strongly for a biological
determinant."
He cites Richard Green's widely reported ef
forts to reprogram children with transsexual
tendencies as "discouraging" even at the ear
liest ages. These indications lend credence. Fisk

believes, to the theories which blame prenatal
hormone secretions for the gender confusion.
While researchers handled the "what" of
transsexualism and psychiatrists grappled with
the "why," surgeons perfected the practical
"how" of the sex change itself.
for the "basic female" (anatomic male),
treatment begins with an estrogen prescription
to induce breast growth and 150 to 200 hours of
electrolysis to remove facial hair. The treatment
concludes with a range of surgical options —
from a simple penectomy and castration to con
struction of a vagina, breast augmentation, nasal
reduction and ear flattening.
A patient can easily spend $7000. a cost oi
which Medicare and insurance cover little if
any. The surgical results are increasingly satis
factory; some of these "new women" claim to
experience orgasm and other have even boasted
of "fooling their gynecologists."
The female-to-male change, on the other
hand, is still in the experimental stageand much
more demanding on both the patient and the
surgeon. Hormone treatment deepens the voice
and produces facial hair, but it rarely reduces
breast size. Instead, most basic; males undergo
mastectomy, in addition to a hysterectomy and a
two-stage operation for construction of a phal
lus.
