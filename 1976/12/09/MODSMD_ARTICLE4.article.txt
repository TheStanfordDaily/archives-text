# Two questions key to Stilwell case
## 
### Elizabeth Pollock Staff writer 
Last month's revelation that Assoc.
Anatomy Prof. Donald Stilwell had
written a possibly unsolicited letter of
recommendation about 43 pre
medical students here has raised two
central issues — what is appropriate
recommendations policy and where
are the limits of confidentiality.
Complicating the matter is Stil well's
unofficial status as an advisor to un
dergraduates.
Most of the students involved have
talked with Robert Hamrdla, director
of the Academic Information Center
(AIC), who received a copy of the letter
from an unnamed source. Some of
these students have then signed af
fidavits that the letter was unsolicited
by them and have asked that the AIC
write to the schools where the student
applied and tell them that the letter
was not written by Stilwell in an offi
cial capacity, Hamrdla said.
Stilwell's status is important be
cause "it carries more weight" if a let
ter is written by someone in an official
capacity, explained one of the students
involved.
Also, students applying to medical
school are given forms on which offi

cial recommendations are written by
persons chosen by the student. Some
students involved had not asked Stil
well to write an official recommenda
tion.
Stilwell said, "What surprises me is
that my relationship to students is a
very open one, and they understand
that recommendations (whether offi
cial or not) are a part of that relation
ship.
"They've always known (that re
commendations would be written) in
the past," he said.
However, one of the students in
volved said, "From what I've heard
people are very, very upset."
Stilwell has withdrawn the letter,
but it remains to be seen whether any
one's admission chances were af
fected. He said the letter was "over
whelmingly meant to favor their (the
students concerned) admissions" and
"was only sent to a very small number
of schools."
It is unknown to how many schools
the letter was sent.
Two issues
Student concern about the letter
centers on two things — the unsol
icited nature of the letter and the
comments themselves, according to
Robert Hamrdla.

James Siena, legal adviser to the
president, said he is not aware of any
regulations prohibiting unsolicited
letters of recommendations from being
sent.
John Goheen. ombudsman, said, "as
far as 1 know, there's no law about any
body writing a letter about anybody,
positive, negative .or otherwise, sub
ject to libel laws."
'Confidential'
However, the letter itself is marked
"Confidential" according to Stilwell.
If that's the case, "None of these people
are supposed to know about it." Go
heen said.
However, Siena said, "Unless the
student has signed a waiver, they have

a right to see letters of recommenda
tion in their files."
"They're proceeding to look into it
very thoroughly," Goheen said later.
But, "There are so many legal aspects
to it that they don't know where they
stand yet," he said.
Siena said, "We're still inquiring
into the matter."
AlC's action
Upon request the AIC has sent letters
to medical schools on behalf of stu
dents explaining that Stilwell is not an
official advisor for undergraduates
here.
Students could express dissatisfac
tion with any actions taken by Siena to
resolve the issue as well, Goheen said.
