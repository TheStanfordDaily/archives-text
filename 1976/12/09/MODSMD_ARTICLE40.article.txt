# U.S. spent $70 million here in '75
## NSF says money used for research, development 
### Steve Schiller 
During federal fiscal year 1975, the
university received more than $70
million from the federal government,
chiefly for research and development
projects, according to the National
Science Foundation (NSF).
This represents a "relatively con
stant research volume" in constant
dollars compared with previous years,
according to Jon Erickson, acting man
ager of the Sponsored Projects Office
here.
The gross amount of contracts
awarded to researchers by the federal
Department of Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW) and the NSF has in
creased while the number of contracts
awarded by the Department of Defense
(DoD) has fallen regularly over the last
10 years.
The university's 1975 budget listed
$59.6 million in research income,
excluding the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC), which re

ceived $27.3 million. The combined
total represents almost one third of the
university's overall budget of $265
million. Tuition provided $39.2 mill
ion and the endowment yielded $15.6
million.
Surcharge
The university arranges for research
contracts by computing the re
searcher's budget and then surcharing
the government 58 per cent above this
amount. The surcharge, labeled, "in
direct cost," covers such items as plant
and administrative costs, according to
Erickson.
A government booklet, Cost Princi
ples for Educational Institutions, sets
forth guidelines for computation of the
indirect cost rate, which has increased
dramatically since 1970.
Erickson said the university's 58 per
cent surcharge was among the five
highest in the country, but claimed
that this "is to be expected" because of
the sophisticated research plant and
high quality staff here.
Because the volume and quality of
research is directly correlated with in
direct costs, smaller institutions with a
lesser emphasis on research may com
pute an indirect cost of as little as 20
per cent, Erickson fcaid. He-remarked
that Harvard's indirect cost rate is sub
stantially higher than the rate here.
University expenditures
During the university's 1976 fiscal
year, which ended Aug. 31, research
expenditures totaled $67.0 million,
excluding another $29.9 million for

SLAC and including both direct and
indirect costs. According to Erickson,
the university "fronts" the budgets for
research and is reimbursed later by the
federal agency sponsoring the project.
In addition, Cost Principles fur Edu
cational Institutions prohibits institu
tions from charging interest on re
search budgets receivable from agen
cies. Therefore, the university bears
the interest costs on research funds.
While the future direction of spon
sored research "is vallowing between
(federal) administrations," Erickson an
ticipated "more of a trend toward
applied research ... in response to
(congressional) inquiries," although
agencies vary in the relative broadness
or specificity of the contract require
ments.
For example, DoD may either ask for
investigation of probability theory in
general or request data on a specific
application of probability theory.
By state, California receives the
largest percentage (26.2 percent in fis
cal year 1975) of research dollars. Of
the top 10 educational institutions in
total federal obligations, three are lo
cated in California, according to NSF.
For fiscal year 1976, SLAC led all
university divisions in government
contract research dollar volume with
$29.9 million. The Medical Center re
ceived $28.6 million; School of En
gineering $12.8 million; School of
Humanities and Sciences, $11.6 mill
ion, of which $9 million went to de

partments in the natural sciences; and
the Center tor Materials Research, $1.6
million. The Hoover Institution re
ceives its federal funding largely
through grants.
Social legislation
In recent years, federal regulations
governing those doing research have
increased administrative costs, said
Erickson.
The federal government chooses to
enforce social legislation through con
tacts by including clauses that force
researchers to "buy American," pat
ronize small or minority businesses
and comply with equal employment
opportunity guidelines, he said.
Other clauses require researchers to
employ the handicapped, take steps to
protect rights of human research sub
jects and comply with clean air and
water guidelines.
The university has two
watchdog agency offices in permanent
residence to monitor costs and facili
tate research programs. The Defense
Contract Audit Agency holds respon
sibility to audit all government re
search contracts here.
The Office of Naval Research (ONR),
in addition toauditing, negotiates con
tracts and indirect cost computations
with university officials.
"To oversee the terms and condi
tions" contracts is the
ONR at Stanford, ac
cording to Phillip Surra, ONR rep
resentative.
In Erickson's view, "the research
pertormed at Stanford is compensated
equitably" at reasonable and approp
riate rates, and the university main
tains a "good working relationship"
with the resident oversight agencies.

Erickson said the university's 58 per
cent surcharge was among the five
highest in the country, but claimed
that this "is to be expected" because of
the sophisticated research plant and
high quality staff here.
Because the volume and quality of
research is directly correlated with in
direct costs, smaller institutions with a
lesser emphasis on research may com
pute an indirect cost of as little as 20
per cent, Erickson fcaid. He-remarked
that Harvard's indirect cost rate is sub
stantially higher than the rate here.
University expenditures
During the university's 1976 fiscal
year, which ended Aug. 31, research
expenditures totaled $67.0 million,
excluding another $29.9 million for

SLAC and including both direct and
indirect costs. According to Erickson,
the university "fronts" the budgets for
research and is reimbursed later by the
federal agency sponsoring the project.
In addition, Cost Principles fur Edu
cational Institutions prohibits institu
tions from charging interest on re
search budgets receivable from agen
cies. Therefore, the university bears
the interest costs on research funds.
While the future direction of spon
sored research "is vallowing between
(federal) administrations," Erickson an
ticipated "more of a trend toward
applied research ... in response to
(congressional) inquiries," although
agencies vary in the relative broadness
or specificity of the contract require
ments.
For example, DoD may either ask for
investigation of probability theory in
general or request data on a specific
application of probability theory.
By state, California receives the
largest percentage (26.2 percent in fis
cal year 1975) of research dollars. Of
the top 10 educational institutions in
total federal obligations, three are lo
cated in California, according to NSF.
For fiscal year 1976, SLAC led all
university divisions in government
contract research dollar volume with
$29.9 million. The Medical Center re
ceived $28.6 million; School of En
gineering $12.8 million; School of
Humanities and Sciences, $11.6 mill
ion, of which $9 million went to de

partments in the natural sciences; and
the Center tor Materials Research, $1.6
million. The Hoover Institution re
ceives its federal funding largely
through grants.
Social legislation
In recent years, federal regulations
governing those doing research have
increased administrative costs, said
Erickson.
The federal government chooses to
enforce social legislation through con
tacts by including clauses that force
researchers to "buy American," pat
ronize small or minority businesses
and comply with equal employment
opportunity guidelines, he said.
Other clauses require researchers to
employ the handicapped, take steps to
protect rights of human research sub
jects and comply with clean air and
water guidelines.
The university has two
watchdog agency offices in permanent
residence to monitor costs and facili
tate research programs. The Defense
Contract Audit Agency holds respon
sibility to audit all government re
search contracts here.
The Office of Naval Research (ONR),
in addition toauditing, negotiates con
tracts and indirect cost computations
with university officials.
"To oversee the terms and condi
tions" contracts is the
ONR at Stanford, ac
cording to Phillip Surra, ONR rep
resentative.
In Erickson's view, "the research
pertormed at Stanford is compensated
equitably" at reasonable and approp
riate rates, and the university main
tains a "good working relationship"
with the resident oversight agencies.
During federal fiscal year 1975, the
university received more than $70
million from the federal government,
chiefly for research and development
projects, according to the National
Science Foundation (NSF).
This represents a "relatively con
stant research volume" in constant
dollars compared with previous years,
according to Jon Erickson, acting man
ager of the Sponsored Projects Office
here.
The gross amount of contracts
awarded to researchers by the federal
Department of Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW) and the NSF has in
creased while the number of contracts
awarded by the Department of Defense
(DoD) has fallen regularly over the last
10 years.
The university's 1975 budget listed
$59.6 million in research income,
excluding the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC), which re

ceived $27.3 million. The combined
total represents almost one third of the
university's overall budget of $265
million. Tuition provided $39.2 mill
ion and the endowment yielded $15.6
million.
Surcharge
The university arranges for research
contracts by computing the re
searcher's budget and then surcharing
the government 58 per cent above this
amount. The surcharge, labeled, "in
direct cost," covers such items as plant
and administrative costs, according to
Erickson.
A government booklet, Cost Princi
ples for Educational Institutions, sets
forth guidelines for computation of the
indirect cost rate, which has increased
dramatically since 1970.

cal year 1975) of research dollars. Of
the top 10 educational institutions in
total federal obligations, three are lo
cated in California, according to NSF.
For fiscal year 1976, SLAC led all
university divisions in government
contract research dollar volume with
$29.9 million. The Medical Center re
ceived $28.6 million; School of En
gineering $12.8 million; School of
Humanities and Sciences, $11.6 mill
ion, of which $9 million went to de

partments in the natural sciences; and
the Center tor Materials Research, $1.6
million. The Hoover Institution re
ceives its federal funding largely
through grants.
Social legislation
In recent years, federal regulations
governing those doing research have
increased administrative costs, said
Erickson.
The federal government chooses to
enforce social legislation through con
tacts by including clauses that force
researchers to "buy American," pat
ronize small or minority businesses
and comply with equal employment
opportunity guidelines, he said.
Other clauses require researchers to
employ the handicapped, take steps to
protect rights of human research sub
jects and comply with clean air and
water guidelines.
The university has two
watchdog agency offices in permanent
residence to monitor costs and facili
tate research programs. The Defense
Contract Audit Agency holds respon
sibility to audit all government re
search contracts here.
The Office of Naval Research (ONR),
in addition toauditing, negotiates con
tracts and indirect cost computations
with university officials.
"To oversee the terms and condi
tions" contracts is the
ONR at Stanford, ac
cording to Phillip Surra, ONR rep
resentative.
In Erickson's view, "the research
pertormed at Stanford is compensated
equitably" at reasonable and approp
riate rates, and the university main
tains a "good working relationship"
with the resident oversight agencies.
During federal fiscal year 1975, the
university received more than $70
million from the federal government,
chiefly for research and development
projects, according to the National
Science Foundation (NSF).
This represents a "relatively con
stant research volume" in constant
dollars compared with previous years,
according to Jon Erickson, acting man
ager of the Sponsored Projects Office
here.
The gross amount of contracts
awarded to researchers by the federal
Department of Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW) and the NSF has in
creased while the number of contracts
awarded by the Department of Defense
(DoD) has fallen regularly over the last
10 years.
The university's 1975 budget listed
$59.6 million in research income,
excluding the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC), which re

ceived $27.3 million. The combined
total represents almost one third of the
university's overall budget of $265
million. Tuition provided $39.2 mill
ion and the endowment yielded $15.6
million.
Surcharge
The university arranges for research
contracts by computing the re
searcher's budget and then surcharing
the government 58 per cent above this
amount. The surcharge, labeled, "in
direct cost," covers such items as plant
and administrative costs, according to
Erickson.
A government booklet, Cost Princi
ples for Educational Institutions, sets
forth guidelines for computation of the
indirect cost rate, which has increased
dramatically since 1970.
Erickson said the university's 58 per
cent surcharge was among the five
highest in the country, but claimed
that this "is to be expected" because of
the sophisticated research plant and
high quality staff here.
Because the volume and quality of
research is directly correlated with in
direct costs, smaller institutions with a
lesser emphasis on research may com
pute an indirect cost of as little as 20
per cent, Erickson fcaid. He-remarked
that Harvard's indirect cost rate is sub
stantially higher than the rate here.
University expenditures
During the university's 1976 fiscal
year, which ended Aug. 31, research
expenditures totaled $67.0 million,
excluding another $29.9 million for

SLAC and including both direct and
indirect costs. According to Erickson,
the university "fronts" the budgets for
research and is reimbursed later by the
federal agency sponsoring the project.
In addition, Cost Principles fur Edu
cational Institutions prohibits institu
tions from charging interest on re
search budgets receivable from agen
cies. Therefore, the university bears
the interest costs on research funds.
While the future direction of spon
sored research "is vallowing between
(federal) administrations," Erickson an
ticipated "more of a trend toward
applied research ... in response to
(congressional) inquiries," although
agencies vary in the relative broadness
or specificity of the contract require
ments.
For example, DoD may either ask for
investigation of probability theory in
general or request data on a specific
application of probability theory.
