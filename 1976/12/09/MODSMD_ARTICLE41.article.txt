# Task force to mull options
## The 						many facets of Western culture 
### Kathy Trafton News analysis 
The Faculty Senate has given the
go-ahead to the development of an out
line for a Western culture requirement
that could affect students entering
here in fall 1978.
The senate voted 23-11 last Thurs
day to appoint a task force which
would develop a tentative outline for
the courses by the end of this academic
year.
Task force members include the
seven faculty members and three stu
dents on the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (C-US) and the deans
of undergraduate studies, the School
of Humanities and Sciences and the
School of Engineering.

Their outline will ultimately be ac
cepted or rejected by the Faculty Se
nate. Rejection of the outline could
mean the Western culture requirement
would not be instituted.
However Academic Secretary Eric
Hutchinson said that he felt the "se
nate undoubtedly means to have the
requirement. One presumes that C-US
will have a reasonable outline (to pre
sent). There is every probability that
we shall have a Western culture re
quirement."
Because C-US and the deans will not
meet until next quarter, there is reluc
tance on their part to speculate on the
nature of the requirements.
Last year, C-US opposed the institu
tion of a Western culture requirement
although it endorsed the principle that
every student should learn about
Western culture.
Ethnocenlrism charged
English Prof. William Chace, who
introduced the resolution to the se
nate, said that the point of the re
quirement would be, "for most under
graduates, a common intellectual ex
perience that they can share, talk ab
out, argueabout." He said there should
ideally be only a small number of
courses offered that would fulfill the
requirement or the whole purpose of a
common experience would be de
feated.
Charges of ethnocentrism were
made at the senate meeting by Asst.
Anthropology Prof. Sylvia
Yanagisako. Chace countered that it
was "not a valid charge. Of course no

one wants ethnocentrism. But you
can't have a clear sense of what other
cultures are like without knowing
what your own is like."
Wayne Sachs, one of the three stu
dent members of C-US, said that
C-US's role will he to "generate new
courses and reevaluate old
courses ... .A reexamination of dis
tribution requirements is possible. As
far as I'm concerned, the new require
ments to be established must be linked
to an improved advising system for the
entering student."
Sachs emphasized that his state
ments represent a tentative under
standing of C-US's role, and that his
opinions may change after C-USmeets
next quarter.
Many possibilities
Sachs also said that there are a lot of
possibilities for the format of the new
courses. For example, existing three
quarter sequences could perhaps ful
fill the requirement. He cited
Humanities 61,62 and 63 as a possible
sequence.
The old "Western Civilization" re
quirement was dropped in 1969. Ac
cording to Assoc. History Prof. Paul
Seaver, who was in charge of coor
dinating the "Western Civilization"
program, the course consisted of "very
broadly conceived history. It focused
on cultural change and politics."
Hutchinson said he felt that the
reason the requirement was dropped
was that "more and more of the teach
ing was done by very young instruc
tors. The quality of teaching wasn't
verv well integrated."
