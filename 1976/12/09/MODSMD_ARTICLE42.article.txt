The Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) may receive funds from the
university next September to supple
ment funds solicited from outside
sources, according to Edith Eddy,
ARLO co-director.
Three top administrators have sub
mitted a recommendation to Provost
William Miller suggesting that ARLO
receive money from the general uni
versity fund in addition to funds it sol
icits outside.
ARLO was started as an ASSU pro
ject three years ago, receiving $2500 in
seed money from the ASSU. Eddy said
that ARLO has since been completely
dependent on financial support sol
icited outside the university.
According to the recommendation
submitted by William Massy, vice
provost for research; W. Bliss Car
nochan, dean of graduate studies; and
Herant katchadourian. dean of under
graduate studies, responsibility for
ARLO policies would be shared bet
ween them.
The adminstration of ARLO would
be the responsibility of the vice pro
vosl for research, according to the re
commendation.
ARLO is presently administered by a
board equally composed of students,
faculty and community members, said
Eddv. She added that the decision re

garding university funding for ARLO
is still in the "negotiation" stage.
The recommendation also suggests
that ARIX) be evaluated in three years
to determine whether it should be con
tinued.
If the recommendation is not ap
proved by the provost and the Hoard of
Trustees, the future of ARLO will be
decided by the ASSU, said Pat De
vaney, assistant to the vice provost for
research.
Devaney was uncertain whether the
vice provost or deans have discussed
their proposal with Miller, but ex
pected to have an "informal reaction"
from the provost in January. Me will
take the recommendation to the Hoard
of Trustees, who will decide the fate of
funding for ARLO. including the ac
tual dollar amount.
The amount will be determined
(along with the entire fiscal budget for
H)78) in March, said Devaney. If the
board votes to give ARLO funding, it
will bepin next fall, she said.
The jurpose of ARLO is to match
students with research projects in the
community which relate to the stu
dents' expressed interests, said Eddy.
Persons in the community bring their
research project needs to ARLO. Re
search data are often used as references
for community projiH:t decisions, she
said.

The Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) may receive funds from the
university next September to supple
ment funds solicited from outside
sources, according to Edith Eddy,
ARLO co-director.
Three top administrators have sub
mitted a recommendation to Provost
William Miller suggesting that ARLO
receive money from the general uni
versity fund in addition to funds it sol
icits outside.
ARLO was started as an ASSU pro
ject three years ago, receiving $2500 in
seed money from the ASSU. Eddy said
that ARLO has since been completely
dependent on financial support sol
icited outside the university.
According to the recommendation
submitted by William Massy, vice
provost for research; W. Bliss Car
nochan, dean of graduate studies; and
Herant katchadourian. dean of under
graduate studies, responsibility for
ARLO policies would be shared bet
ween them.
The adminstration of ARLO would
be the responsibility of the vice pro
vosl for research, according to the re
commendation.
ARLO is presently administered by a
board equally composed of students,
faculty and community members, said
Eddv. She added that the decision re

garding university funding for ARLO
is still in the "negotiation" stage.
The recommendation also suggests
that ARIX) be evaluated in three years
to determine whether it should be con
tinued.
If the recommendation is not ap
proved by the provost and the Hoard of
Trustees, the future of ARLO will be
decided by the ASSU, said Pat De
vaney, assistant to the vice provost for
research.
Devaney was uncertain whether the
vice provost or deans have discussed
their proposal with Miller, but ex
pected to have an "informal reaction"
from the provost in January. Me will
take the recommendation to the Hoard
of Trustees, who will decide the fate of
funding for ARLO. including the ac
tual dollar amount.
The amount will be determined
(along with the entire fiscal budget for
H)78) in March, said Devaney. If the
board votes to give ARLO funding, it
will bepin next fall, she said.
The jurpose of ARLO is to match
students with research projects in the
community which relate to the stu
dents' expressed interests, said Eddy.
