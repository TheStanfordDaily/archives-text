# FBI memos reveal campaign to get Franklin fired
## 
### Herb Borock 
Nearly five years after Stan
ford's Board of Trustees fired
English Professor H. Bruce
franklin, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation has released
documents that reveal that the
I B I anonymously mailed copies
of news clippings and circulars
about franklin to the trustees to
encourage them "to take some
positive action against such a
person as FRANKLIN . . . and in
sist that FRANKLIN be removed
from his position at Stanford."
The FBI mailing occurred in
June 1969, a year-and-a-half he
lore Stanford President Richard
Lyman initiated the year-long
disciplinary proceedings
against Franklin. The mailing
included copies ol documents'
hearing the return adress of the
Young Americans for Freedom
chapter on campus.
Other FBI memos show that
the FBI used San Francisco
Kxumirwr reporter Ed
Montgomery to create the arti
oles the FBI later mailed to the
trustees; investigated witnesses
who appeared on Franklin's be
half during his disciplinary
hearing before Stanford's Fa
culty Advisory Board; and ob
tained its copy of Franklin's
opening statement before the
Advisory Board from the Stan
font Cha/)(irml. "a quasi-official
humor magazine."
The FBI began its surveillance

of Franklin in 1966 following his
outspoken opposition to the Viet
nam War, his membership in
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam ("a student
professor pacifist-type organiza
tion"), and his participation in
lawful protest activities against a
napalm plant in Redwood City.
On March 9, 1967 the FBl's San
Francisco field office recom-

mended that Franklin be in
cluded in Section A of the Re
serve; Index, an administrative
aid maintained by the FBI to
monitor persons who would be
of importance to the FBI in the
event of a national emergency.
The FBl's Reserve Index in
cluded all individuals known to
have affiliation or sympathy
with the Communist I'artv and

persons in some way associated
with revolutionary groups other
than the Communist Party. The
FBl's Manual of Instructions in
dicated that Section A of the Re
serve Index was to be composed
of persons who met the Reserve
Index criteria and who were
educators, labor officials, enter
tainers, media personalities,
lawyers, doctors, scientists, and
other potentially influential per
sons.
Security Index
By May 1968 Franklin's name?
had been moved from the Re
serve Index to the Security Index.
This meant that during a na
tional emergency. Franklin
would be apprehended and de
tained under the provisions of
the Emergency Detention Act, as
a person dangerous to U.S. in
ternal security. The Security
Index classification meant that
Franklin was included in Prior
ity One of the Priority Ap
prehension Program, since he
was employed by Stanford Uni
versity., a facility designated
vital to the national defense by
the Department of Defense.
The FBI initially included
Franklin in their Reserve Index
and Security Index despite the
fact that he had never been ar
rested or charged with any
crime. The FBl's May 6, 1969
quarterly report on Franklin
noted that he had been acquitted'
the previous month of charges

I stemming from a demonstration
r the previous November, but re
• commended keeping Franklin in
the Security Index because "he
is reportedly one of the founders
I of the RU (Revolutionary Un
• ion), a Marxist-Leninist organi
zation. th.it adheres to the
policies of Mao Tse-tung."
On M.iy 14. 1969, FBI Direc
tory I Edgar Hoover wrote his
San Francisco office that
"Franklin, in his position of As
sociate Professor of English at
' Stanford University, represents

une ot the most militant radical
extremists on American cam
puses, and his background has
been well documented pub
licly."
Revolutionary objectives
One ol the public documents
Hoover referred to was .1 March
23. 1 9fi9 article by Ed Montgom
ery in the San Francisco Sunday
Examiner tr Chroniclc that
claimed to describe Franklin's
revolutionary objectives. I loover
couldn't have been surprised
when he read that article, since
he had requested that such an

article be written.
In February 1969 Hoover
suggested that a "cooperative
news media source" interview
Franklin about his relationship
with "his 'close associate' who
lived in China and a 'young
friend' who had served in the
Red Cuard." Montgomery sub
sequently interviewed Franklin,
and his March 23 article iden
tified the "close associate" as
William I toward I iinton, and the
"young friend" as Christopher
Milton.
Hoover proposed on May 14.
1969 that a pamphlet about
Franklin be prepared and "be
anonymously posted to all
members of the Board of Trus
tees of Stanford, to selected
alumni, and other appropriate

individuals including the gov
ernor. senators and congressmen
ol California."
The San Francisco office re
plied on May 20 that "a circular
made from duplicating
MONTCOMERV'S article . . . is
being distributed in the Palo
Alto-Stanford area." The circu
lar advised that additional
copies couUl be obtained from
P.O. Box 3697, Stanford.
California, which the FBI noted
"is a Box on the Stanford Uni
versity campus utilized by the
Young Americans for Freedom."
Menace
The local FBI requested au
thority to distribute copies of
both the March 2:< article and
another Montgomery article that
appeared coincidentallv on May

19, tour days alter Hoover's re
quest tor u pamphlet or brochure
on Franklin. The two articles
would be mailed to "selected in
dividuals having apparent in
fluence over the Stanford staff
and faculty, urging them to use
this influence to rid Stanford of
this menace to the democratic
future of their children."
Apparently Hoover approved
the mailing. On October 1. 1969
theS .111 Francisco office reported
that since June 19B9 both
Montgomery articles had been
sent to the trustees, selected
alumni, and local political fi
gures. Again the FIJI noted that
the mailing "appears to have its
origin with ... the Young
Americans for Freedom."

FBI memo:
'Franklin .. .
represents one
of the most
militant radical
extremists on
American cam
puses . .

. .rid Stanford
of this menace
to the democra
tic future . .
The FBl's May 20 memo re
quested "authority to prepare
additional Xerox copies of the
enclosed 3/29/6!) circular and at
tach it to Xerox copies of the ED
MONTGOMERY article dated
5/19/69." (Emphasis added.) The
word "additional" indicates that
the FBI participated in the prep
aration of the original circular.
In a recent interview with the
Stanford Daily, Harvey Hukari
— 1969 chairman of the Stanford
YAF group, now regional direc
tor for the Republican National
Committee — said that he "never
gave any approval" at the time
for the FBl's use of the YAF post
office box as a return address. He
said YAF did not participate in
the FBI mailings, and he said he
planned to consult with the
ACLU to see if he had grounds
for a lawsuit.
The FBI was aware that their
anonymous mailing had "little
effect with the Trustees as
FRANKLIN continues as Assis
tant (sic) Professor in the English
Department and is still active in
RU activities."Throughout 1970
they devised a number of so
called "counter-intel ligence"
operations with the objective of
"neutralizing" Franklin and the
RIJ. By the end of 1970 the FBI
had not been successful.
However, early in 1971 Stan
ford President Richard Lyman

filed charges before the Faculty
Advisory Board to fire Franklin
for his alleged role in demonst
rations against' Henry Cabot
Lodge and the U.S. invasion of
Laos. We don't know whether
the Advisory Hoard members re
ceived the FBI mailings or were
influenced by anyone who did.
But the FBI mailed Montgom
ery's articles to the trustees, who
made the decision to fire
Franklin.
On November 17,1971 Hoover
told the San Francisco FBI office
that four persons (including
anti-war activist and former
Stanford student Lenny Siegel)
had appeared as witnesses for
Franklin.
For the past four years the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) has been representing
Franklin in his attempt to be
reinstated at Stanford with back
pay. The ACLU may be able to
use the FBI memos to question
the trustees about how they ar
rived at their decision to fire
Franklin. Stanford is preparing
to answer such questions. Bob
Beyers, director of Stanford's
News and Publications Service,
has requested a copy of the FBI
documents Franklin released to
the press.

he had requested that such an

article be written.
In February 1969 Hoover
suggested that a "cooperative
news media source" interview
Franklin about his relationship
with "his 'close associate' who
lived in China and a 'young
friend' who had served in the
Red Cuard." Montgomery sub
sequently interviewed Franklin,
and his March 23 article iden
tified the "close associate" as
William I toward I iinton, and the
"young friend" as Christopher
Milton.
Hoover proposed on May 14.
1969 that a pamphlet about
Franklin be prepared and "be
anonymously posted to all
members of the Board of Trus
tees of Stanford, to selected
alumni, and other appropriate

individuals including the gov
ernor. senators and congressmen
ol California."
The San Francisco office re
plied on May 20 that "a circular
made from duplicating
MONTCOMERV'S article . . . is
being distributed in the Palo
Alto-Stanford area." The circu
lar advised that additional
copies couUl be obtained from
P.O. Box 3697, Stanford.
California, which the FBI noted
"is a Box on the Stanford Uni
versity campus utilized by the
Young Americans for Freedom."
Menace
The local FBI requested au
thority to distribute copies of
both the March 2:< article and
another Montgomery article that
appeared coincidentallv on May

19, tour days alter Hoover's re
quest tor u pamphlet or brochure
on Franklin. The two articles
would be mailed to "selected in
dividuals having apparent in
fluence over the Stanford staff
and faculty, urging them to use
this influence to rid Stanford of
this menace to the democratic
future of their children."
Apparently Hoover approved
the mailing. On October 1. 1969
theS .111 Francisco office reported
that since June 19B9 both
Montgomery articles had been
sent to the trustees, selected
alumni, and local political fi
gures. Again the FIJI noted that
the mailing "appears to have its
origin with ... the Young
Americans for Freedom."

FBI memo:
'Franklin .. .
represents one
of the most
militant radical
extremists on
American cam
puses . .

. .rid Stanford
of this menace
to the democra
tic future . .
The FBl's May 20 memo re
quested "authority to prepare
additional Xerox copies of the
enclosed 3/29/6!) circular and at
tach it to Xerox copies of the ED
MONTGOMERY article dated
5/19/69." (Emphasis added.) The
word "additional" indicates that
the FBI participated in the prep
aration of the original circular.
In a recent interview with the
Stanford Daily, Harvey Hukari
— 1969 chairman of the Stanford
YAF group, now regional direc
tor for the Republican National
Committee — said that he "never
gave any approval" at the time
for the FBl's use of the YAF post
office box as a return address. He
said YAF did not participate in
the FBI mailings, and he said he
planned to consult with the
ACLU to see if he had grounds
for a lawsuit.
The FBI was aware that their
anonymous mailing had "little
effect with the Trustees as
FRANKLIN continues as Assis
tant (sic) Professor in the English
Department and is still active in
RU activities."Throughout 1970
they devised a number of so
called "counter-intel ligence"
operations with the objective of
"neutralizing" Franklin and the
RIJ. By the end of 1970 the FBI
had not been successful.
However, early in 1971 Stan
ford President Richard Lyman

filed charges before the Faculty
Advisory Board to fire Franklin
for his alleged role in demonst
rations against' Henry Cabot
Lodge and the U.S. invasion of
Laos. We don't know whether
the Advisory Hoard members re
ceived the FBI mailings or were
influenced by anyone who did.
But the FBI mailed Montgom
ery's articles to the trustees, who
made the decision to fire
Franklin.
On November 17,1971 Hoover
told the San Francisco FBI office
that four persons (including
anti-war activist and former
Stanford student Lenny Siegel)
had appeared as witnesses for
Franklin.
For the past four years the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) has been representing
Franklin in his attempt to be
reinstated at Stanford with back
pay. The ACLU may be able to
use the FBI memos to question
the trustees about how they ar
rived at their decision to fire
Franklin. Stanford is preparing
to answer such questions. Bob
Beyers, director of Stanford's
News and Publications Service,
has requested a copy of the FBI
documents Franklin released to
the press.
fAnother version of this article
appeared in the December issue
of Grapevine.)
Nearly five years after Stan
ford's Board of Trustees fired
English Professor H. Bruce
franklin, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation has released
documents that reveal that the
I B I anonymously mailed copies
of news clippings and circulars
about franklin to the trustees to
encourage them "to take some
positive action against such a
person as FRANKLIN . . . and in
sist that FRANKLIN be removed
from his position at Stanford."
The FBI mailing occurred in
June 1969, a year-and-a-half he
lore Stanford President Richard
Lyman initiated the year-long
disciplinary proceedings
against Franklin. The mailing
included copies ol documents'
hearing the return adress of the
Young Americans for Freedom
chapter on campus.
Other FBI memos show that
the FBI used San Francisco
Kxumirwr reporter Ed
Montgomery to create the arti
oles the FBI later mailed to the
trustees; investigated witnesses
who appeared on Franklin's be
half during his disciplinary
hearing before Stanford's Fa
culty Advisory Board; and ob
tained its copy of Franklin's
opening statement before the
Advisory Board from the Stan
font Cha/)(irml. "a quasi-official
humor magazine."
The FBI began its surveillance

of Franklin in 1966 following his
outspoken opposition to the Viet
nam War, his membership in
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam ("a student
professor pacifist-type organiza
tion"), and his participation in
lawful protest activities against a
napalm plant in Redwood City.
On March 9, 1967 the FBl's San
Francisco field office recom-

mended that Franklin be in
cluded in Section A of the Re
serve; Index, an administrative
aid maintained by the FBI to
monitor persons who would be
of importance to the FBI in the
event of a national emergency.
The FBl's Reserve Index in
cluded all individuals known to
have affiliation or sympathy
with the Communist I'artv and

persons in some way associated
with revolutionary groups other
than the Communist Party. The
FBl's Manual of Instructions in
dicated that Section A of the Re
serve Index was to be composed
of persons who met the Reserve
Index criteria and who were
educators, labor officials, enter
tainers, media personalities,
lawyers, doctors, scientists, and
other potentially influential per
sons.
Security Index
By May 1968 Franklin's name?
had been moved from the Re
serve Index to the Security Index.
This meant that during a na
tional emergency. Franklin
would be apprehended and de
tained under the provisions of
the Emergency Detention Act, as
a person dangerous to U.S. in
ternal security. The Security
Index classification meant that
Franklin was included in Prior
ity One of the Priority Ap
prehension Program, since he
was employed by Stanford Uni
versity., a facility designated
vital to the national defense by
the Department of Defense.
The FBI initially included
Franklin in their Reserve Index
and Security Index despite the
fact that he had never been ar
rested or charged with any
crime. The FBl's May 6, 1969
quarterly report on Franklin
noted that he had been acquitted'
the previous month of charges

I stemming from a demonstration
r the previous November, but re
• commended keeping Franklin in
the Security Index because "he
is reportedly one of the founders
I of the RU (Revolutionary Un
• ion), a Marxist-Leninist organi
zation. th.it adheres to the
policies of Mao Tse-tung."
On M.iy 14. 1969, FBI Direc
tory I Edgar Hoover wrote his
San Francisco office that
"Franklin, in his position of As
sociate Professor of English at
' Stanford University, represents

une ot the most militant radical
extremists on American cam
puses, and his background has
been well documented pub
licly."
Revolutionary objectives

Hoover referred to was .1 March

told the San Francisco FBI office
that four persons (including
anti-war activist and former
Stanford student Lenny Siegel)
had appeared as witnesses for
Franklin.
For the past four years the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) has been representing
Franklin in his attempt to be
reinstated at Stanford with back
pay. The ACLU may be able to
use the FBI memos to question
the trustees about how they ar
rived at their decision to fire
Franklin. Stanford is preparing
to answer such questions. Bob
Beyers, director of Stanford's
News and Publications Service,
has requested a copy of the FBI
documents Franklin released to
the press.
fAnother version of this article
appeared in the December issue
of Grapevine.)
Nearly five years after Stan
ford's Board of Trustees fired
English Professor H. Bruce
franklin, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation has released
documents that reveal that the
I B I anonymously mailed copies
of news clippings and circulars
about franklin to the trustees to
encourage them "to take some
positive action against such a
person as FRANKLIN . . . and in
sist that FRANKLIN be removed
from his position at Stanford."
The FBI mailing occurred in
June 1969, a year-and-a-half he
lore Stanford President Richard
Lyman initiated the year-long
disciplinary proceedings
against Franklin. The mailing
included copies ol documents'
hearing the return adress of the
Young Americans for Freedom
chapter on campus.
Other FBI memos show that
the FBI used San Francisco
Kxumirwr reporter Ed
Montgomery to create the arti
oles the FBI later mailed to the
trustees; investigated witnesses
who appeared on Franklin's be
half during his disciplinary
hearing before Stanford's Fa
culty Advisory Board; and ob
tained its copy of Franklin's
opening statement before the
Advisory Board from the Stan
font Cha/)(irml. "a quasi-official
humor magazine."
The FBI began its surveillance

of Franklin in 1966 following his
outspoken opposition to the Viet
nam War, his membership in
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam ("a student
professor pacifist-type organiza
tion"), and his participation in
lawful protest activities against a
napalm plant in Redwood City.
On March 9, 1967 the FBl's San
Francisco field office recom-

mended that Franklin be in
cluded in Section A of the Re
serve; Index, an administrative
aid maintained by the FBI to
monitor persons who would be
of importance to the FBI in the
event of a national emergency.
The FBl's Reserve Index in
cluded all individuals known to
have affiliation or sympathy
with the Communist I'artv and

persons in some way associated
with revolutionary groups other
than the Communist Party. The
FBl's Manual of Instructions in
dicated that Section A of the Re
serve Index was to be composed
of persons who met the Reserve
Index criteria and who were
educators, labor officials, enter
tainers, media personalities,
lawyers, doctors, scientists, and
other potentially influential per
sons.
Security Index
By May 1968 Franklin's name?
had been moved from the Re
serve Index to the Security Index.
This meant that during a na
tional emergency. Franklin
would be apprehended and de
tained under the provisions of
the Emergency Detention Act, as
a person dangerous to U.S. in
ternal security. The Security
Index classification meant that
Franklin was included in Prior
ity One of the Priority Ap
prehension Program, since he
was employed by Stanford Uni
versity., a facility designated
vital to the national defense by
the Department of Defense.
The FBI initially included
Franklin in their Reserve Index
and Security Index despite the
fact that he had never been ar
rested or charged with any
crime. The FBl's May 6, 1969
quarterly report on Franklin
noted that he had been acquitted'
the previous month of charges

I stemming from a demonstration
r the previous November, but re
• commended keeping Franklin in
the Security Index because "he
is reportedly one of the founders
I of the RU (Revolutionary Un
• ion), a Marxist-Leninist organi
zation. th.it adheres to the
policies of Mao Tse-tung."
On M.iy 14. 1969, FBI Direc
tory I Edgar Hoover wrote his
San Francisco office that
"Franklin, in his position of As
sociate Professor of English at
' Stanford University, represents

une ot the most militant radical
extremists on American cam
puses, and his background has
been well documented pub
licly."
Revolutionary objectives
One ol the public documents
Hoover referred to was .1 March
23. 1 9fi9 article by Ed Montgom
ery in the San Francisco Sunday
Examiner tr Chroniclc that
claimed to describe Franklin's
revolutionary objectives. I loover
couldn't have been surprised
when he read that article, since
he had requested that such an

article be written.
In February 1969 Hoover
suggested that a "cooperative
news media source" interview
Franklin about his relationship
with "his 'close associate' who
lived in China and a 'young
friend' who had served in the
Red Cuard." Montgomery sub
sequently interviewed Franklin,
and his March 23 article iden
tified the "close associate" as
William I toward I iinton, and the
"young friend" as Christopher
Milton.
Hoover proposed on May 14.
1969 that a pamphlet about
Franklin be prepared and "be
anonymously posted to all
members of the Board of Trus
tees of Stanford, to selected
alumni, and other appropriate

individuals including the gov
ernor. senators and congressmen
ol California."
The San Francisco office re
plied on May 20 that "a circular
made from duplicating
MONTCOMERV'S article . . . is
being distributed in the Palo
Alto-Stanford area." The circu
lar advised that additional
copies couUl be obtained from
P.O. Box 3697, Stanford.
California, which the FBI noted
"is a Box on the Stanford Uni
versity campus utilized by the
Young Americans for Freedom."
Menace
The local FBI requested au
thority to distribute copies of
both the March 2:< article and
another Montgomery article that
appeared coincidentallv on May

19, tour days alter Hoover's re
quest tor u pamphlet or brochure
on Franklin. The two articles
would be mailed to "selected in
dividuals having apparent in
fluence over the Stanford staff
and faculty, urging them to use
this influence to rid Stanford of
this menace to the democratic
future of their children."
Apparently Hoover approved
the mailing. On October 1. 1969
theS .111 Francisco office reported
that since June 19B9 both
Montgomery articles had been
sent to the trustees, selected
alumni, and local political fi
gures. Again the FIJI noted that
the mailing "appears to have its
origin with ... the Young
Americans for Freedom."

FBI memo:
'Franklin .. .
represents one
of the most
militant radical
extremists on
American cam
puses . .

. .rid Stanford
of this menace
to the democra
tic future . .
The FBl's May 20 memo re
quested "authority to prepare
additional Xerox copies of the
enclosed 3/29/6!) circular and at
tach it to Xerox copies of the ED
MONTGOMERY article dated
5/19/69." (Emphasis added.) The
word "additional" indicates that
the FBI participated in the prep
aration of the original circular.
In a recent interview with the
Stanford Daily, Harvey Hukari
— 1969 chairman of the Stanford
YAF group, now regional direc
tor for the Republican National
Committee — said that he "never
gave any approval" at the time
for the FBl's use of the YAF post
office box as a return address. He
said YAF did not participate in
the FBI mailings, and he said he
planned to consult with the
ACLU to see if he had grounds
for a lawsuit.
The FBI was aware that their
anonymous mailing had "little
effect with the Trustees as
FRANKLIN continues as Assis
tant (sic) Professor in the English
Department and is still active in
RU activities."Throughout 1970
they devised a number of so
called "counter-intel ligence"
operations with the objective of
"neutralizing" Franklin and the
RIJ. By the end of 1970 the FBI
had not been successful.
However, early in 1971 Stan
ford President Richard Lyman

filed charges before the Faculty
Advisory Board to fire Franklin
for his alleged role in demonst
rations against' Henry Cabot
Lodge and the U.S. invasion of
Laos. We don't know whether
the Advisory Hoard members re
ceived the FBI mailings or were
influenced by anyone who did.
But the FBI mailed Montgom
ery's articles to the trustees, who
made the decision to fire
Franklin.
On November 17,1971 Hoover

policies of Mao Tse-tung."
On M.iy 14. 1969, FBI Direc
tory I Edgar Hoover wrote his
San Francisco office that
"Franklin, in his position of As
sociate Professor of English at
' Stanford University, represents

une ot the most militant radical
extremists on American cam
puses, and his background has
been well documented pub
licly."
Revolutionary objectives
One ol the public documents
Hoover referred to was .1 March
23. 1 9fi9 article by Ed Montgom
ery in the San Francisco Sunday
Examiner tr Chroniclc that
claimed to describe Franklin's
revolutionary objectives. I loover
couldn't have been surprised
when he read that article, since
he had requested that such an

article be written.
In February 1969 Hoover
suggested that a "cooperative
news media source" interview
Franklin about his relationship
with "his 'close associate' who
lived in China and a 'young
friend' who had served in the
Red Cuard." Montgomery sub
sequently interviewed Franklin,
and his March 23 article iden
tified the "close associate" as
William I toward I iinton, and the
"young friend" as Christopher
Milton.
Hoover proposed on May 14.
1969 that a pamphlet about
Franklin be prepared and "be
anonymously posted to all
members of the Board of Trus
tees of Stanford, to selected
alumni, and other appropriate

individuals including the gov
ernor. senators and congressmen
ol California."
The San Francisco office re
plied on May 20 that "a circular
made from duplicating
MONTCOMERV'S article . . . is
being distributed in the Palo
Alto-Stanford area." The circu
lar advised that additional
copies couUl be obtained from
P.O. Box 3697, Stanford.
California, which the FBI noted
"is a Box on the Stanford Uni
versity campus utilized by the
Young Americans for Freedom."
Menace
The local FBI requested au
thority to distribute copies of
both the March 2:< article and
another Montgomery article that
appeared coincidentallv on May

19, tour days alter Hoover's re
quest tor u pamphlet or brochure
on Franklin. The two articles
would be mailed to "selected in
dividuals having apparent in
fluence over the Stanford staff
and faculty, urging them to use
this influence to rid Stanford of
this menace to the democratic
future of their children."
Apparently Hoover approved
the mailing. On October 1. 1969
theS .111 Francisco office reported
that since June 19B9 both
Montgomery articles had been
sent to the trustees, selected
alumni, and local political fi
gures. Again the FIJI noted that
the mailing "appears to have its
origin with ... the Young
Americans for Freedom."

FBI memo:
'Franklin .. .
represents one
of the most
militant radical
extremists on
American cam
puses . .

. .rid Stanford
of this menace
to the democra
tic future . .
The FBl's May 20 memo re
quested "authority to prepare
additional Xerox copies of the
enclosed 3/29/6!) circular and at
tach it to Xerox copies of the ED
MONTGOMERY article dated
5/19/69." (Emphasis added.) The
word "additional" indicates that
the FBI participated in the prep
aration of the original circular.
In a recent interview with the
Stanford Daily, Harvey Hukari
— 1969 chairman of the Stanford
YAF group, now regional direc
tor for the Republican National
Committee — said that he "never
gave any approval" at the time
for the FBl's use of the YAF post
office box as a return address. He
said YAF did not participate in
the FBI mailings, and he said he
planned to consult with the
ACLU to see if he had grounds
for a lawsuit.
The FBI was aware that their
anonymous mailing had "little
effect with the Trustees as
FRANKLIN continues as Assis
tant (sic) Professor in the English
Department and is still active in
RU activities."Throughout 1970
they devised a number of so
called "counter-intel ligence"
operations with the objective of
"neutralizing" Franklin and the
RIJ. By the end of 1970 the FBI
had not been successful.
However, early in 1971 Stan
ford President Richard Lyman

filed charges before the Faculty
Advisory Board to fire Franklin
for his alleged role in demonst
rations against' Henry Cabot
Lodge and the U.S. invasion of
Laos. We don't know whether
the Advisory Hoard members re
ceived the FBI mailings or were
influenced by anyone who did.
But the FBI mailed Montgom
ery's articles to the trustees, who
made the decision to fire
Franklin.
On November 17,1971 Hoover
told the San Francisco FBI office
that four persons (including
anti-war activist and former
Stanford student Lenny Siegel)
had appeared as witnesses for
Franklin.
For the past four years the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) has been representing
Franklin in his attempt to be
reinstated at Stanford with back
pay. The ACLU may be able to
use the FBI memos to question
the trustees about how they ar
rived at their decision to fire
Franklin. Stanford is preparing
to answer such questions. Bob
Beyers, director of Stanford's
News and Publications Service,
has requested a copy of the FBI
documents Franklin released to
the press.
fAnother version of this article
appeared in the December issue
of Grapevine.)
Nearly five years after Stan
ford's Board of Trustees fired
English Professor H. Bruce
franklin, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation has released
documents that reveal that the
I B I anonymously mailed copies
of news clippings and circulars
about franklin to the trustees to
encourage them "to take some
positive action against such a
person as FRANKLIN . . . and in
sist that FRANKLIN be removed
from his position at Stanford."
The FBI mailing occurred in
June 1969, a year-and-a-half he
lore Stanford President Richard
Lyman initiated the year-long
disciplinary proceedings
against Franklin. The mailing
included copies ol documents'
hearing the return adress of the
Young Americans for Freedom
chapter on campus.
Other FBI memos show that
the FBI used San Francisco
Kxumirwr reporter Ed
Montgomery to create the arti
oles the FBI later mailed to the
trustees; investigated witnesses
who appeared on Franklin's be
half during his disciplinary
hearing before Stanford's Fa
culty Advisory Board; and ob
tained its copy of Franklin's
opening statement before the
Advisory Board from the Stan
font Cha/)(irml. "a quasi-official
humor magazine."
The FBI began its surveillance

of Franklin in 1966 following his
outspoken opposition to the Viet
nam War, his membership in
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam ("a student
professor pacifist-type organiza
tion"), and his participation in
lawful protest activities against a
napalm plant in Redwood City.
On March 9, 1967 the FBl's San
Francisco field office recom-

mended that Franklin be in
cluded in Section A of the Re
serve; Index, an administrative
aid maintained by the FBI to
monitor persons who would be
of importance to the FBI in the
event of a national emergency.
The FBl's Reserve Index in
cluded all individuals known to
have affiliation or sympathy
with the Communist I'artv and

persons in some way associated
with revolutionary groups other
than the Communist Party. The
FBl's Manual of Instructions in
dicated that Section A of the Re
serve Index was to be composed
of persons who met the Reserve
Index criteria and who were
educators, labor officials, enter
tainers, media personalities,
lawyers, doctors, scientists, and
other potentially influential per
sons.
Security Index
By May 1968 Franklin's name?
had been moved from the Re
serve Index to the Security Index.
This meant that during a na
tional emergency. Franklin
would be apprehended and de
tained under the provisions of
the Emergency Detention Act, as
a person dangerous to U.S. in
ternal security. The Security
Index classification meant that
Franklin was included in Prior
ity One of the Priority Ap
prehension Program, since he
was employed by Stanford Uni
versity., a facility designated
vital to the national defense by
the Department of Defense.
The FBI initially included
Franklin in their Reserve Index
and Security Index despite the
fact that he had never been ar
rested or charged with any
crime. The FBl's May 6, 1969
quarterly report on Franklin
noted that he had been acquitted'
the previous month of charges

I stemming from a demonstration
r the previous November, but re
• commended keeping Franklin in
the Security Index because "he
is reportedly one of the founders
I of the RU (Revolutionary Un
• ion), a Marxist-Leninist organi
zation. th.it adheres to the
policies of Mao Tse-tung."
On M.iy 14. 1969, FBI Direc

they devised a number of so
called "counter-intel ligence"
operations with the objective of
"neutralizing" Franklin and the
RIJ. By the end of 1970 the FBI
had not been successful.
However, early in 1971 Stan
ford President Richard Lyman

filed charges before the Faculty
Advisory Board to fire Franklin
for his alleged role in demonst
rations against' Henry Cabot
Lodge and the U.S. invasion of
Laos. We don't know whether
the Advisory Hoard members re
ceived the FBI mailings or were
influenced by anyone who did.
But the FBI mailed Montgom
ery's articles to the trustees, who
made the decision to fire
Franklin.
On November 17,1971 Hoover
told the San Francisco FBI office
that four persons (including
anti-war activist and former
Stanford student Lenny Siegel)
had appeared as witnesses for
Franklin.
For the past four years the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) has been representing
Franklin in his attempt to be
reinstated at Stanford with back
pay. The ACLU may be able to
use the FBI memos to question
the trustees about how they ar
rived at their decision to fire
Franklin. Stanford is preparing
to answer such questions. Bob
Beyers, director of Stanford's
News and Publications Service,
has requested a copy of the FBI
documents Franklin released to
the press.
