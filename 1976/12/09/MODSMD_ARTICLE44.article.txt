I he revelation over two years
ago in theStunlord Daily that the
FBI had been harassing a radical
Stanford English professor is
corroborated in newly available
documents.
I he April .'!(), 1974 story said
that a censored FBI memoran
dum that had just been released
showed that the FBI had in De
cember 1970 considered imple
menting a disruption plan di
rected against the political ac
tivities ol since-fired English

Prof. H. Bruce Franklin.
Documents obtained from the
FBI since December 1975 by the
Colorado chapter of the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union in re
sponse to requests made under
the federal Freedom of Informa
tion Act now confirm the Doily's
story.
The 1974 story had been
sparked by a discovery by
Leonard Siegel, a member of the
Pacific Studies Center research
group in East Palo Alto. Siegel
told tlieDoily that whileexamin
ing a set ol recently released FBI
documents, he realized that the
topic of one of them was proba
bly Franklin.
The documents had been re
leased during March 1974 in
heavily censored form by the
Justice Department as a result of
a Freedom of Information suit
brought by NIK" reporter Carl
Stern.

The discovery in 1974 th.it an
FBI disruption plan had been
proposed with Franklin as its
target was early evidence of sys
tematic: government harassment
ol Franklin. The extent of that
harassment is only now appa
rent.
The pertinent FBI memo con
cerned a "disruption technique"
which thi! FBI planned to use in
December 1970 against Franklin
"with the objective of neutraliz
ing" the Revolutionary Union
(now the Revolutionary Com
munist Party), a nationwide
Maoist group.
The group which left the Re
volutionary Union with
Franklin immediately joined
with a group of Chicano Maoists
to form the now-defunct Vence
remos organization, which was
active on the San Francisco
Peninsula from January 1971
through September 1973.
