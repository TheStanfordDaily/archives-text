# Bookstore addition work on schedule
## 
### Jeff Parietti 
The addition to the Stanford
Bookstore is proceeding on
schedule and should be com
pleted by the spring of 1978, ac
cording to Eldon Speed,
bookstore manager.
The first phase of the construc
tion is nearing completion and
bids for the second and final
phase will be taken in January,
said Speed.
A total of 34,000 square feet of
space will be added onto the pre
sent complex at an estimated
cost of $2.9 million. About $1
million of the total will be paid
from revenues generated by the
bookstore over the past four
years. The remainder of the
amount will be borrowed from
the university.
"The immediate advantage of
the addition will simply be
being able to move around the
bookstore during registration
and other days," Speed said.

The existing structure will be
"devoted entirely to books,"
added Speed.
"We estimate that the addition
should take care of our needs tor
at least 8 to 10 years." said
Speed.
The addition will consist of
two stories and a basement, with
the basement being utilized to
meet the bookstore's backstock
ing needs.
The bookstore currently leases
7000 square 112 eet of storage space

and 1500 square feet in
downtown Palo Alto locations at
.in annual estimated cost of bet
ween $20,000 to $24,000. This
rental space will no longer be
needed after construction is
completed according to Speed.
As for plans to expand the var
iety of books available at the
bookstore, Speed said that "we
do plan to expand our book
selection, although the em
phasis as far as our stock is con
cerned is to take what we have

and improve our format first."
One plan in the works is to add
1 J more cash registers during
registration periods. "We nor
mally use 13 registers during re
gistration," said Speed. "Instead
of one in each li ne we'll have two
set-up, which will make the
lines move faster."
This move will have to wait
until the addition is finished, as
Speed said "there is no power
provision yet tor the more regis
ters."

Bookstore gets more
The bookstore extension will offer more room in which students may wander during hectic
registration days. If construction continues on schedule, the addition will be completed in the
spring of 1978.
