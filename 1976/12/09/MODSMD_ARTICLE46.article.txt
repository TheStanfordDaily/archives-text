Reviewed by Chuck Hirsch
it seems only right that Hulling
Stone, the world's first major
publication concerned with rock
*n' roll music, should be the first
publication to offer a serious
examination of rock's history. It
could well be that no one else
has considered rock important
enough to chronicle it's de
velopment. or it could be the
simple fear of a seemingly im
possible task which has caused
the long delay in a rock 'n' roll
history text. In any case, The Hol
lirig Stone Illustrated History of
Hock and Hoi I takes the initiative
and attempts the impossible as it
leads us through all of rock 'n'
roll — from the distant past to
the here and now — and has us
enjoying ourselves the whole
way.
The book begins wi th "several
dozen black dancers" in a "tiny
rural church," and ends with
"Bruce Springsteen as a pop
hero for the Seventies." The 382
pages in-between link these two
extremes while tracing the
evolution of today's music. It
may come as somewhat of a
shock to a good many
progressive-rock lovers, but
even the most modern of mod
erns are built on yesterday's
sounds.
The roots of rock lie in black
culture. Though it ultimately
sprang from a fusion of many dif
ferent aspects of many different
types of music, early rock was
mainly an outgrowth of the in
teraction of black and white
music. Black gospel music was
an influence on blues, which in
fluenced folk songs, which in
fluenced black pop, which in
fluenced jazz, and so on. This is
where it all begins, and, since it
would be impossible to trace the
flow of all the different sources

into the forms of today, the book
sticks only to the main con
tributors and the most promi
nent paths of development in
these early years.
Obscure
Some of the musicians editor
Jim Miller considers to be impor
tant in rock's early development
will, without a doubt, seem
obscure to a great many readers.
There are names like Smiley
Lewis and Huey Smith — names
which mean nothing to most of
us. But out of this group of un
knowns rose the foundation for
later rock. Time and again, the
influence of the past will surface
when Elvis or Dylan or Jagger is
quoted as being directed in one
form or another by one of the
obscure "names."
Likewise, some of the musical,
developments discussed in the
early chapters may prove to be a
reading challenge.
Rhythm, gospel and rocka
billy are so far removed from
most of our conceptions of rock
that it's easy to cast t hem aside as
negligible influences. Don't
make the mistake. The extra time
taken to wade through the early
chapters is well worth it. The
status of more recent rock 'n' roll
is much more clear — and much
more interesting—when view
ed in the light of what's come
before.
Rolling
As rock progresses, the musi
cians and movements discussed
become much better known and
interest increases. The ball starts
rolling with Elvis Presley, and
moves on through Chuck Berry,
Buddy Holly, Dylan, Elton John
and everyone of importance in
between. But one of the book's
few flaws lies in the coverage of
these individual stars and
groups. It seems strange that the
Allman Brothers should get a
two-page spread while the
Beach Boys get six. But with a
topic as broad and subjective as

rock 'n' roll, there are bound to
be disagreements.
All the major rock movements
— Top 40, soul, folk, heavy
metal, etc. — are well-covered.
These sections are nostalgic in a
way, bringing the not-so-distant
past up to date. It's a real plea
sure reading about songs and ar
tists you haven't thought about
in years. In many of these chap
ters, it gets to the point where it's
impossible to read without
humming.
Rave
The essays are excellent, al
though it gets a little tiresome
hearing every rock group de
scribed as the best in rock 'n' roll.
Since each chapter is written by
an expert on one particular per
former, group, or period in rock
history, the raves are almost ex
pected. After all, the writer is an
expert because he likes the
group, and if he likes them he's
going to tell people about it.
If the essays are excellent, the
pictures are outstanding. If one
were to pass on reading the text,
and looked at the pictures alone,
there would still be that feeling
that there's really nothing new

in rock — that everything comes
from bits and pieces of the past.
Somehow, the black fingernail
polish of the Seventies' Lou
Reed doesn't seem so bizarre
against the mascara of the Fif
ties' Little Richard.
On top of the essays and pic
tures, there are the discog
raphies. They list the prime
work of the artists in each rock
genre, and, although they aren't
totally exhaustive, they are, as
Jim Miller says, "historical re
ferences." They are. like the
| writing, photos, and book as a
whole, extremely interesting.
The book takes on something
r which has never before been at
■ tempted, and succeeds. It leaves
. one with a certain sense of pride
• in the rock 'n' roll music of today
i —a pridebuilt on heritage. But it
! also leaves one with a hunger for
s more music. After we've seen
where rock has been, and lived
3 with rock as it is, we can only ask
j where it's going. The answer is,
, of course, unclear. But we can be
, sure of one thing — Don McLean
5 was wrong. The music hasn't
i died.
