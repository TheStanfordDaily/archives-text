# 'Chappie': unreformed, unrefined
## 
### Reviewed by Tim W. Ferguson 
I suppose that some of us awaited the fall
issue of the Chaparral with all the curious
fascination the United States might have
had with an inaugural address by Norman
Thomas.
For in the course of one October week, the
perennial barroom hecklers of ASSU poli
tics became the main attraction. The Ham
mer and Coffin humor society descended
into student government.
Lest there be any fears of co-optation, the
Chappie's quarterly magazine arrived in
time to reassure us that The Irreverents re
main unreformed and unrefined.
Only a minor portion of the issue is de
voted to Senate Follies, but H&C hurls a fair
share of insults at its political rivals,
nonetheless. Senate Chairperson Pat Hall,
in a column appropriately titled "Let's
Make A Deal," even pokes fun at the quids
pro quo (quae pro quibus for you literalists)
which brought him his own ASSU position.
The masses
The big question in my mind, and one
which the Chappie's campus commentaries
have always raised, is how The Masses out
there can appreciate all the inside jokes and
allusions which are the core of the
magazine's local humor. I doubt that most of
the Stanford community reads the Daily as
fastidiously as H&C must, and surely one

who did not attend the ASSIJ Senate's first
meeting would miss HO per cent of the
humor in Hall's column.
Perhaps the answer is that the Chaparral
is not aimed at a mass audience. That's too
had in a way, for some of its writers have a
rare gift for bringing to the fore the crude
observations many Stanfordites make to
themselves but leave out of polite conversa
tion.
Case in point: a classic illustrated essay
on the Stanford Man. Woman and Nerd in
the fall issue. There, in IV2 pages of not-so
gross generalizations, is a rather thorough
analysis of the Stanford social scene.
Private joke
Of course, the court jesters are able to give
an occasional private joke some widespread
play at the dorm dinner tables merely by
repeating it, page after page and issue after
issue. Thus Carole Houck became Lee
Rosenbaum in drag last year, and now Prad
krevoy is buying everyone lunch. Pretty
funny.
More hilarity is to be found in the latest
issue's cartoon parody of the New Founders
League's reverence for the university and its
founder, and in the prose and verse of Roy
Skogstrom, who, aside from being the
ASSIJ Senate's most obnoxious member,
happens to be the most sophisticated wit to

grace Stanford since Bill Ross.
Really, a Stanford without the Chaparral
would he like one without Meyer Library
disruptions, ritual pyrotechnics, White
Plaza mass rallies, New Year's Day in
Pasadena and Larry Horton, and we've lost
all of those. Thanks to some devoted
humorists, we're still stuck with the Chap
pie, now stronger than ever (probably be
cause they demoted that Dornheim guy).
Valued trust (?!)
H&C has a valued trust and opportunity:
to poke fun where it needs poking around
here, freed from the hypersensitivity and
self-seriousness of the Stanford community
which so restricts the Daily (wrap that in
your aluminum foil, fencers!).
Having said that, 1 still must address the
sexism which seems to permeate the H&C
product. Unlike most of the Chappie's
bigotry humor, which actually is directed at
the stereotype and not the stereotyped, the
asides at women seem to reflect a genuinely
narrow viewpoint. Obviously, the H&Cers
need the broad-based schooling of the
Western Civ requirement they helped bring
back.
Well, boys, I had to say something nasty
about you and your damn magazine! And
now, if you'll excuse me, I think I see a bear
approaching my campsite.

tion.
Case in point: a classic illustrated essay
on the Stanford Man. Woman and Nerd in
the fall issue. There, in IV2 pages of not-so
gross generalizations, is a rather thorough
analysis of the Stanford social scene.
Private joke
Of course, the court jesters are able to give
an occasional private joke some widespread
play at the dorm dinner tables merely by
repeating it, page after page and issue after
issue. Thus Carole Houck became Lee
Rosenbaum in drag last year, and now Prad
krevoy is buying everyone lunch. Pretty
funny.
More hilarity is to be found in the latest
issue's cartoon parody of the New Founders
League's reverence for the university and its
founder, and in the prose and verse of Roy
Skogstrom, who, aside from being the
ASSIJ Senate's most obnoxious member,
happens to be the most sophisticated wit to

grace Stanford since Bill Ross.
Really, a Stanford without the Chaparral
would he like one without Meyer Library
disruptions, ritual pyrotechnics, White
Plaza mass rallies, New Year's Day in
Pasadena and Larry Horton, and we've lost
all of those. Thanks to some devoted
humorists, we're still stuck with the Chap
pie, now stronger than ever (probably be
cause they demoted that Dornheim guy).
Valued trust (?!)
H&C has a valued trust and opportunity:
to poke fun where it needs poking around
here, freed from the hypersensitivity and
self-seriousness of the Stanford community
which so restricts the Daily (wrap that in
your aluminum foil, fencers!).
Having said that, 1 still must address the
sexism which seems to permeate the H&C
product. Unlike most of the Chappie's
bigotry humor, which actually is directed at
the stereotype and not the stereotyped, the
asides at women seem to reflect a genuinely
narrow viewpoint. Obviously, the H&Cers
need the broad-based schooling of the
Western Civ requirement they helped bring
back.
Well, boys, I had to say something nasty
about you and your damn magazine! And
now, if you'll excuse me, I think I see a bear
approaching my campsite.
I suppose that some of us awaited the fall
issue of the Chaparral with all the curious
fascination the United States might have
had with an inaugural address by Norman
Thomas.
For in the course of one October week, the
perennial barroom hecklers of ASSU poli
tics became the main attraction. The Ham
mer and Coffin humor society descended
into student government.
Lest there be any fears of co-optation, the
Chappie's quarterly magazine arrived in
time to reassure us that The Irreverents re
main unreformed and unrefined.
Only a minor portion of the issue is de
voted to Senate Follies, but H&C hurls a fair
share of insults at its political rivals,
nonetheless. Senate Chairperson Pat Hall,
in a column appropriately titled "Let's
Make A Deal," even pokes fun at the quids
pro quo (quae pro quibus for you literalists)
which brought him his own ASSU position.
The masses
The big question in my mind, and one
which the Chappie's campus commentaries
have always raised, is how The Masses out
there can appreciate all the inside jokes and
allusions which are the core of the
magazine's local humor. I doubt that most of
the Stanford community reads the Daily as
fastidiously as H&C must, and surely one

who did not attend the ASSIJ Senate's first
meeting would miss HO per cent of the
humor in Hall's column.
Perhaps the answer is that the Chaparral
is not aimed at a mass audience. That's too
had in a way, for some of its writers have a
rare gift for bringing to the fore the crude
observations many Stanfordites make to
themselves but leave out of polite conversa
tion.
