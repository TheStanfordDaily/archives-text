Italian literature is not very
well known in this country.
Even reasonably well-read
Americans have an ignorance of
the subject that can only be
termed profound. Italians, they
are aware, have been known to
paint, sculpt and even compose.
But do they actually write as
well, they ask incredulously.
Well, will wonders never cease!
In an atmosphere of such be
nign indifference the Red Hill
Press is to be praised for bringing
out this remarkably fine collec
tion of an Italian poet whose
work is almost completely un
known in this country. The Sky
With Its Mouth Wide Open is a
short collection of poems trans
lated from E fatto giorno, the
only book of verse written by
Rocco Scotollaro, an Italian poet
who died in 1953.
Scotollaro's short life is re
miniscent of so many other lyric
poets. Dead at the age of 30, he
threw himself into the political
and artistic life of his time with a
passion worthy of Byron. At 23

he was already mayor of his na
tive village. A few years later he
was imprisoned for political ac
tivities.
Leaving prison, he traveled
through Italy's impoverished
South gathering materials for a
hook on its social problems. A
few years later he died in Naples
most of his work still in manus
cript.
Amidst this flurry of political
and sociological activity, Scotol
laro somehow found time and
energy to write some of the most
striking lyric poems in post-war
Italian literature. Although his
single book of verse did not see
publication until after his early
death, it was immediately rec
ognized as a distinctive work of
major importance.
Scotollaro spent almost all of
his life among the peasants and
workers of Southern Italy. His
poetry has the simplicity and di
rectness of such origins without
ever having the annoying con
descension and fake tone which
so often characterizes self
consciously "proletariat" litera
ture. His poems are simple with
out being intentionally
simplified.
If Scotollaro wrote almost exc

lusively about the people of few
villages, his motivations were
only secondarily political. This
was the world in which he lived.
His poems succeed as political
statements because they talk
about this world without mis
sing anything, including poli
tics.
But poets are not politicians.
They need no speech writers and
can talk for themselves:
I don't knoiv how J can live near
you any longer
someone ties the voice in my
chest
you are the carter's daughter
who takes the breath from my
mouth.
It is terribly difficult for even
the finest poets to write love
poems without falling into
chiches. Love poetry must be di
rect but not unrealistic or pre
dictable. It is Scotellaro's con
siderably achievement that he
can write so simply and effec
tively without losing t In; sense of
freshness which permeates his
work.
Scotollaro also has an amazing
ability to express ideas in
dynamic images that haunt the
reader long after finishing the
poem:
My sou I
is in the breath
which fills and empties me.
Or in a poem entitled
"Economics Lesson" he writes:
I asked you one day who posted
the sentinels of spruce
up there in the Dolomites.
You answered me
that a father who loves his chil
dren
can only watch them go away.
Paul Vangelisti has ac
complished a great deal with
this book. I le has proven himself
an adept translator by recreating
Scotollaro's unique voice beauti
fully in English. He has also pro
vided American readers with an
excellent selection in both En
glish and Italian of a writer
whose work is almost com
pletely unavailable in this coun
try. Finally, he has set other
small presses in California a
good example by reminding
them that they have a duty to
publish work that goes beyond
local interest. A big job from a
small press.

It is terribly difficult for even
the finest poets to write love
poems without falling into
chiches. Love poetry must be di
rect but not unrealistic or pre
dictable. It is Scotellaro's con
siderably achievement that he

tively without losing t In; sense of
freshness which permeates his
work.
Scotollaro also has an amazing
ability to express ideas in
dynamic images that haunt the

poem:

which fills and empties me.
Or in a poem entitled
"Economics Lesson" he writes:

You answered me

Italian literature is not very
well known in this country.
Even reasonably well-read
Americans have an ignorance of
the subject that can only be
termed profound. Italians, they
are aware, have been known to
paint, sculpt and even compose.
But do they actually write as
well, they ask incredulously.
Well, will wonders never cease!
In an atmosphere of such be
nign indifference the Red Hill
Press is to be praised for bringing
out this remarkably fine collec
tion of an Italian poet whose
work is almost completely un
known in this country. The Sky
With Its Mouth Wide Open is a
short collection of poems trans
lated from E fatto giorno, the
only book of verse written by
Rocco Scotollaro, an Italian poet
who died in 1953.
Scotollaro's short life is re
miniscent of so many other lyric
poets. Dead at the age of 30, he
threw himself into the political
and artistic life of his time with a
passion worthy of Byron. At 23

he was already mayor of his na
tive village. A few years later he
was imprisoned for political ac
tivities.
Leaving prison, he traveled
through Italy's impoverished
South gathering materials for a
hook on its social problems. A
few years later he died in Naples
most of his work still in manus
cript.
Amidst this flurry of political
and sociological activity, Scotol
laro somehow found time and
energy to write some of the most
striking lyric poems in post-war
Italian literature. Although his
single book of verse did not see
publication until after his early
death, it was immediately rec
ognized as a distinctive work of
major importance.
Scotollaro spent almost all of
his life among the peasants and
workers of Southern Italy. His
poetry has the simplicity and di
rectness of such origins without
ever having the annoying con
descension and fake tone which
so often characterizes self
consciously "proletariat" litera
ture. His poems are simple with
out being intentionally
simplified.
If Scotollaro wrote almost exc

lusively about the people of few
villages, his motivations were
only secondarily political. This
was the world in which he lived.
His poems succeed as political
statements because they talk
about this world without mis
sing anything, including poli
tics.
