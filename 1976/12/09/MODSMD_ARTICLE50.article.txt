# Season's greetings
## Pick of the Christmas books 
### Dana Gioia Howard Baldwin 
Books. One of the greatest Christmas pre
sents around. With this in mind, the Daily
books reviewers have set down what they
think is the pick of the season's offerings.
They are certainly not the only books to be
found, but they represent the books that our
reviewers might most want to receive.

The Loudest Screen Kiss und other little
known facts about the movies by Barbara
Seuling; $4.95; 45 pages.
Stalling's book is a slim little volume
peppered with trivia rarely found in run-of
the-mill trivia books, such as the fact that
Lucille Ball was once dismissed from a
drama school for being shy and reticent.
The facts stretch from the silent era all the
way up through the disaster genre, and con
cern themselves with both the actors and
the movies. For instance, did you know that
the 45-second shower scene in Psycho was
composed of 70 shots, and that none of the
torsos seen belonged to Janet Leigh?Or that
Bela Lugosi was buried in his Dracula
cloak?
The Loudest Screen Kiss also gives a hint
iis lo what a wacky place Hollywood was. It
informs us that ('lark Gable was loaned out
lo <i Poverty Row studio because MCM
wanted to punish him. The picture he made
at Columbia Studios was It Happened One
Night, which gave; Cable his only Oscar.
Humphrey Bogart, aware that he was
being tailed, called the detective agency
Irom a pay telephone and said, "This is
Humphrey Bogart. You got a man on my
tail. Would you check with him and see
where I am?"
Who Wos That Masked Man? by David
Kothel; $17.50: 25(i pages.
Kothel has compiled the most com
prehensive history of the Lone Ranger im
aginable, from his inception in radio, to his
visualization as a movie serial, and to his
final conceptualization on television. The
book contains anything and everything re
lating to the Masked Man, including con
temporary pictures, stills, advertisements,
articles and drawings.
In addition to the publicity material, Rot
h a I also includes interviews with the
creators and perpetrators of the Lone Ranger
James Jewell, Charles I). Livingstone, J.l'.
McCarthy and Ceorge Sea ton. who went on
to become a film director.
Films OJ The h'ilties by Douglas Brode;
$14; 2HH pages.
The Fifties were far more tumultuous in
the film industry than they wore in the rest
ol the United States. What with television
and anti-trust suits against the studios,
pressure to turn out extraordinary product

us at its highest. The success of foreign films
also wrought changes in filmmaking.
Suddenly innovations were possible in
every aspect of the cinema. Some of our best
directors, like Hitchcock and Mankiewicz,
did their best work in the'sos, while some of
today's best started in the '50s, like kram
mer, Wiljer and Xinnemann.
Brode's book discussed the films in terms
of how they changed and were changed by
new mores. He had chosen an ample rep
resentation, from the low-class thrillers like
Hercules to the high-class stories of Hol
lywood and the world, including Sunset
Boulevard, TheGreatest Show On Earth, On
The Beach, Some Like It Hot and Vertigo.
A Biographical Dictionary of h'ilm by
David Thomson: $16.95; H29 pages.
Thomson's book is a gigantic critical
index of anyone and everyone in movies.
Over 800 people are discussed in Thom
son's acerbic, sometimes excessively critical,
tone. When he loves someone, he loves
them dearly. When he thinks their reputa
tion is undeserved, he does not hesitate to
say so. Objectivity is not o.ne of the book's
components.
Among his international subjects, no one
is too big or too revered to escape Thom
son's poison pen. Of Stanley Kubrick and
Clockwork Omnge, he says, "Despite its set
piece outrages, the film is grindingly tedious,
uncertain of how to develop narrative and
pusillanimous in its attitude toward vio
lence."
Of Alfred Hitchcock: "I do not see how a
man so fearful, and so chronically adept at
conveying fear, can be judged a profound
artist." Of John Ford: "Ford, by comparison
(to Howard Hawks) was bigoted, grand
iloquent and maudlin." Of actors he is less
vindictive, but just as condescending. 1 low
ever, as a reference book, Thomson's study
is complete and satisfying.
On Being Blue by William Cass ((iodine,
$10.)
The discursive essay often seems like one
ol literature's endangered species. Yet
when a writer with the finesse and versatil
ity ol William ( lass turns his complete atten
tion to this genre, one wonders why the
essay isn't the natural American form. On
Bring Blue is a witty, lyrical and marvell
ously written book by America's most enter
taining philosopher.
Alter Babel by Ceorge Steiner (Oxford,
$4.95)
Alter Babel is one of the few recent books
of literary criticism that has won a wide
audience of serious readers. Steiner at
tempts to create a systematic theory of trans

lation as a key to the whole process ot lan
guage. A difficult book, to be sure, but a
definite "must" for both dedicated students
and psuedo-intellectuals.
The Myth and the Cult of the Virgin Mury
Alone of All Her Sex by Marina Warner
(Knopf, $15.)
Alone of All Her Sex is one of the most
i nteresti ng a nd origi nal books of t he yea r. In
a flamboyant and occasionally personal
way Marina Warner traces the career of the
Virgin Mary in religion, art, literature and
custom over the past 2000 years. No fallen
Catholic can afford to pass up this volume.
New Poems by Eugenio Montale, trans
lated by C. Singh (New Directions).
Last year at the age of 70 the Italian poet
Eugenio Montale won the Nobel Prize in
literature. In a sense Montale was a man
living at the end of an era, one of the last
great writers of the modern movement.
These recent poems show the author in his
most personal and accessible moods. An
important hook in a superb translation.
Collected l J oems by Ceorge Oppen (New
Directions, $3.75)
In the 1930s a slim volume of experimen
tal poems appeared under the name of
Ceorge Oppen. No further books were pub
lished for U0 years when suddenly Oppen
reappeared on the American literary scene
as a major poet. Lean, powerful and direct,
these poems carry on the American idiom of
William Carlos Williams but in a manner
distinctive to Oppen alone.
The Collected Poem s of Weld on Kees
edited by Donald Justice (Bison books,
$3.95)
Contemporary poetry is so little read that
the title "most underrated" or "unjustly ig
nored" poet may seem superfluous. My own
choice for this unenvious position is the late
Weldon kees. Mis poems are so direct, bril
liant and terrifying that I cannot believe that
he is undeserving of a larger audience. Asa
poet ot devestating self-analysis and de
spair, Kees is equal to Berryman and Platli.
Hlind Ambition hy John Dean (Simon and
Schuster, $12.95)
Hsquire political writerTaylor Branch has
made a fairly engaging narrative out of
"conspiracy 1 inch pi n"-turned-stool pigeon
Dean's original manuscript, which resem
bled his 257-page Senate Watergate Com
mittee rehash of the coverup. The insider's
description of petty rivalries and battles
over perquisites of office in the Nixon White
I louse helps dispci public myths about top
level policymaking and policy makers.
