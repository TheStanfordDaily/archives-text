Hurley, a new hook hy T.S.
Briley. should be read hy every
student ol the world, hy every
person who is going through a
period of questioning about the
role which he or she plays in t he
American society.
Ilarley is a former corporate
flunky. who left the world of big
business and its pressures lor a
more sedate life on a farm. The
hotly of Briley's hook is a narra
tive of the event of I larley's first
weekend trip back to the city
which he left, back to the friends
and lover of his past.
The changes he finds there —
new jobs for old friends, chang
es in marriages and inevitable
distance from his former inti
mates — are presented in a con
vincing way which captures tint
pain of returning to the past.
I larley's greatest virtue is that he
can conquer the pain of the past
that despite the memories the
city revives, he has truly left it
be hi nd.
Unfortunately, the hook is
marred in places because Hriley

has maintained a single-minded
purpose: to get his thoughts on
paper no matter what the cost to
the narrative or the characters.
I le begins to harangue, commit
ting the error that Louis Rubin
points out in Writers of the
American South: "He ceased to
write fiction and began to write
tracts."
This tends to give the book a
stacatto rhythm, as Hurley
moves quickly Irom diatribe to
diatribe, now blasting the
bureaucracy in Washington,
now striking out at t he corporate
system.
But despite this stylistic prob
lem. Hurley is a perceptive
commentary which touches
many topics of modern life in a
painfully perceptive manner.
Ilarley is a man alone trying to
prevent his slip into the middle
class and to find some way of
filling the void in his lonely life.
His struggle to find meaning
in a world which seems without
purpose, and without friends,
marks the gap between the
promise of the modern world
and the reality of being alone.
T.S, Briley, author of Hurley,

encountered many of the prob
lems of a first time writer while
trying 1o get Hurley into print.
Hriley carried the ideas for the
book around in his bend tor
many years before he was able to
see the finished product. The
world ol publishers, familiar to
any young writer, was a barrier
for Hriley as well.
It wasn't until last year when
Hriley and partner Jeynean Por
ter began KTC Word Processing
in Palo Alto th.it Hriley saw a
way to avoid the hassles and ex
pense of puhlishi ng with a major
firm.
And the answer was ETC.
With the computerized word
processor the firm owns, it is
possible tn set copy for offset
printing at a fraction of the cost
of other firms. KTC'also has con
tacts with local printers which
would allow a budding writer to
see his book in print without
paying the $5000-1 (),()()() major
publishers would charge.
"Hy using the system at KTC,"
Hriley said, "we can give an au
thor as few as 50 copies of his
book. This means he won't lose
his shirt just to get into print."
Hriley stresses that this means
one can get a book printed and
hound, allowing the author to
distribute the copies to friends or
to make the manuscript more at
tractive to publishing firms.
So for I In; hundreds of writers
in Hie Hay Area who want tn see
their work published, the ans
wer very well could be KTC.
Hoth Hriley and Porter have ex
tensive work in research (Hriley
has a Ph.D. in Kducational Re
search and advising and edit
ing). KTC is also equipped to
handle technical papers .intl
these as well as resumes and
other manuscripts.
KTC is located at 575
Mitldlcficld Road in Palo Alto.
