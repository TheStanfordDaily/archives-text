Voices of Amorica: Ilia Nation's
Story in Slogans, Sayings, and
Songs by Thomas liailey, I'ree
Press, 52() pp.. $12.95.
Students ol American history
who tiro ol tables ol statistics,
lengthy treatises on sociiil and
ideological trends and monog
raphs which take mori! space
quoting other monographs than
they do making original com
ments will enjoy setlling hack
and reviewing this running nar
rative of events and what Ameri
cans have said about them
Bailey, an emeritus pro
lessor of history here, is
tireless in stringing together
poems, say ings, labels and songs
of the popular culture, from
pre-Clreat Awakening religious
poetry and early Yankee
homilies such as "list; it up,

wear it out; make it do, or do
without" to women's liberation
slogans and "I'm ;i Korri. not .1
Lincoln."
Indeed, Voices of Aiiwricn is
best suited lor late nifÂ»hl reading,
when thesrei is time lor but a lew
ol the work. The hook is so
he taken oidy in small doses. Hut
tin; doses iire worth Inking.
I'll (! closer I tail ey comes to our
own lime, the more his casual
treatment ol the periods from
which he takes his phrases is
evident. Once the mirier learns
to study the hook not for its his
torical analysis hut for its in
sights into popular sentiments
during critical periods, how
ever, s/lie will forgive bailey for
subtly indoctrinati his audi
(Mice on the "serious"
background ol those periods.
