## Stanford in history 
### Robert Lempert 
Eighty five classes have
graduated from Stanford and in
those classes there have been our
share of future presidents, writ
ers, scientists, and NFL quar
terbacks. Over the years Stanford
professors have reaped many
high honors. But while there
may be many biographies of
these Stanford students there is
no written history of the school
itself.
The raw materials are there,
stashed away in filing cabinets,
old Heports of the President, and
the memories of alumni, but no
one has bothered to collect, or
ganize, and write up these data to
make a formal history of Stan
ton! University. That is until
now. James Watkins, emeritus
professor of political science
and president of the newly
formed Stanford Historical Soci
ety, is planning to remedy this

"It may be possible for a person to
live a happy and successful life
without graduating from Stanford,
but I think it unlikely."

situation.
The purpose of the Historical
Society, as set forth in its charter,
is to collect and preserve the his
tory of Stanford University and
to encourage knowledge and
understanding ol this history
,iiid the i<ltiiils of its founders.
Mut if Watkins has his way the
official history of Stanford will
not be an obscure book filed
away on some dusty shelf in the
back ot Meyer Library.
Wonderful nonsense
Head ot the Political Science
Department in the? 50's and a
1929 graduate of Stanford (he is
fond of pointing out that his was
thi' last class to graduate in the
"age of wonderful nonsense."
before the Great Depression),
Watkins is renowned for his
concern for his students and de
votion to his alma mater. Ile lists
his major loves in life as God, his
wife, and Stanford — though his
wife has some doubts about the
order. I le said only half jokingly
that it may be "possible for a per
son to live a happy and success

ful life without graduating from
Stanford, but I think it unlikely."
At 68, Watkins is still actively
involved in everything from his
research to Stanford football. I lis
study in his Palo Alto home is
full of memorabilia from his
years here and he admitted to
never throwing away a student's
paper.
Watkins loves a good story
and it seems he has one for every
occasion. During the interview
for this story he spoke of what it
was likit studying in Japan with
the sons of millionaires like the
Rockefellers as news of the 1029
crash trickled in, what frat [jar
ties were like when the Univer
sity tried to enforce its drinking
regulations and how Western
Civ made it easier to meet girls.
He spoke about pranksters he
had known and tragedies he had
seen, and how the 1906 ear
thquake improved the quad by

removing a few eye sores.
Confused
He described some of the
people he has watched go from
confused Stanford students to
become university presidents
and the editor of Time. Watkins
started the Historical Society so
that some of these stories can be
written down for everyone to
see.
r l he society has moved from
humble beginnings to an equally
humble present. The only thing
it seems to have alot of is dedica
tion from its members. Its ac
comodations are rather modest
it runs out of the emeriti office
ol the Political Science Depart
ment (Watkins was still trying to
dig up a typewriter when inter
viewed ) and is financed solely
by annual dues of $10. But its
membership is anything but
meager. Its founding meeting at
the beginning of this year, or
ganized by Watkins. Mrs. 1 larold
Bacon, Stanford '32, and Rev.
Robert Minto, had only 16 mem
bers. Hut by the end of the sum

mer the society had 274 mem
berships, or 359 members —
husbands and wives may join
under a single membership. The
members come from all facets of
the University community but
they are mostly faculty and
alumni.
The Society has nearly twenty
projects on its "to do" list. Any
member can volunteer to head
any project or can think one up
by himself. About half the
society's projects have chairmen
and are under way. One of these
is an attempt to encourage gifts
of historical materials to the
University Archives. Watkins
considers the Archives to be ex
cellent and has no intention of
competing with them.
Guide to campus
Another project is compiling a
guide to campus monuments
and plaques. This also involves
finding some of those plaques
covered up with ivy or making
some new ones.
Since freshman are never re
ally told anything about Stan
ford's past, except for one short
slideshow during orientation,
theSociety is making a freshman
brochure on Stanford history.
They are also working on a dic
tionary of campus place names.
It will have a picture of each
building and a discription of
who it was named after and why.
(For instance, why is Wilbur
Hall called Wilbur Hall and was
Wilbur a past president, a rich
alumnus, or a stallion on Leland
Stanford's stud farm?)
Watkins would also like to see
the names of the Stanford war
dead from WWI, Korea,and Viet
nam added to those of WWII on
the plaque in Memorial Au
ditorium. The Society placed
flowers on the mausoleum
(where the Stanfords are buried)
on Founder's Day (March 9), but
as this is a traditional duty of the
senior class, stopped during the
60's, Watkins hopes that it
will re-accept this responsibil
ity.
Longterm projects
The Society also has some
long term projects in mind. It is
working on a souvenir book on
Stanford. It will have pictures
and a narrative and be a "literary
equivalent of the visual experi
ence that Stanford is." Accord
ing to Watkins it would be simil
ar to the Sunset series including

"Beautiful California" and"The
Beautiful Southwest." He de
scribed it as something that
would he pretty enough so that
you could send it to your Aunt
Matilda in New York, who could
put it on her coffee table and
point out to all her friends that
this is where her little nephew
Irving is going to school.
The society would also like to
build a new house for the Wes
tminster chimes that used to
be in the old bell tower above the
church. While the bell tower was
one of the structures that Wat
kins feels the earthquake im
proved upon by destroying it.he
says the bells are very beautiful
and should be displayed. He
suggests a new bell tower a few
stories high be built some where
near the church.
The Society is also working on
a full-length history of the Uni
versity to be ready by either the
centennials of I,eland Jr.'s death
(1984), the execution of the
Founding Grant (1985), the lay
ing of the corner stone (1987), or
the opening of the University

(1991).
When asked why t he history of
Stanford was worth all this trou
ble to tell, Watkins answered
with, what else, a story. But then
he summarized all his stories by
simply saying that to him. read
ing a good history of something
you Jove is like listening to
music. It is something worthy in
its own right. For James Watkins
and the Stanford Historical Soc
iety the story of Stanford is a
story worth telling in the most
vivid and varied way that they
can. Given James Watkins' de
termination and energy, its a
story we're going to be hearing
alot about.


Before the quake
The Stanford Historical Society, a group of concerned faculty
members and alumni, is trying to organize a number of pro-

jects which would assure the preservation of university history
and memorabilia. Part of their program will be to encourage
donations to the University Archives.
