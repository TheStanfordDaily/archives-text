spend a wild night gambling and
partying before the game. They
spent a quiet night in their hotel.

and people say 'Aw, they were
probably out gambling.' But
everybody was in their rooms
last night and everyone was
thinking about the game," said
guard Mike Bratz. "It was one of
those things. We just couldn't
put it together. We were cold; the
place was cold."

down to 10 or 12 with 10 mi
nutes to go," said Hratz, "we'd
have a chance to get 'em. Then

we put on our press and with five
minutes to go it was down to
