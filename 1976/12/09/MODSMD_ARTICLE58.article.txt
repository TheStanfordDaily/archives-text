# Stanford Invitational
## Swimmers shatter marks 
### Jill Lieber 
Head swim coach Jim Caugh
ran called Saturday's Stanford
Invitational Championships a
"developmental" meet. But the
Cardinal swimmers did not take
the meet lightly, breaking a slew
of pool records.
Olympic gold medalist Mike
Bruner set a new deCuerre re
cord in winning the 500-
freestyle in 4:26.85. The sopho
more from Stockton broke the
□ Id mark of 4:26.028 set in 1975
by USC's John Naber. lie bet
tered his personal best time of
4:27.81 made as a freshman in
197 5 and now owns the best
500-freestyle time ever obtained
in the Cards' history.
Pool mark
Bruner also set a pool record in
the 200-free. He swam to a
1:40.26 first place finish, break
ing fht! deCuerre Pool record of
1:41.02, set in 1975 by UCLA's
Tim McDonnel. Bruner also es
tablished a men's varsity record
by beating former Card Craig
VanZandt's time of 1:40.88 set in

-1975.
Bruner's 200 fly time of
1:50.25 bettered any mark he had
as a freshman. He took last year
off to train for the Olympics.
"I felt good in the water,"
Bruner said, "but I always feel
good in the 200 fly. I was disap
pointed that I didn't break a 1:50
in the 200 fly because I think
those barriers should be broken
early in the season so that by the
time NCAAs roll around in
March, I feel better about the race
psychologically."
Outstanding job
"Mike is doing an outstanding
job," Claughran said. "His 200
free time was his best short
course time ever. He is also
sprinting better than he used to
and is a possibility for our sprint
(400 free) relay."
Junior co-captain Stuart Cor
liss also had a good meet, dis
playing top pre-season form. He
had a lifetime best of 4:15.63 in
the 400 intermediate. In the 100
and 200-yard breaststroke he
came in a close second to Cal's

Graham Smith, a member of the
'76 Canadian Olympic team and
the third-ranked breaststroker in
the world.
"Stu did especially well in the
200 breaststroke," Gaughran
said. "He is already down to
2:10.04." Corliss is close to his
best time of 2:07.86 and is less
than a second off the NCAA
qualifying time.
Olympian
Gaughran was encouraged
by the performances of
freshmen Paul llartloff and bob
Hagberg. Hartloff, .a distance
freestyler who captured seventh
place in the 1500-meter free in
Montreal last summer, came in
second in the 1650-yard free
Saturday with a 16:01.08. He
finished third in the 500-yard
free with a time of 4:41.68.
"All of Paul's races were good
swims,"Gaughran said. "When I
saw him swim in high school he
really didn't get moving until
the end of the season."
Hagberg, a prep All-America
butterflyer from South Hadley,
Mass., swam well in the 100 fly
with a first place time of 51.40.
"Bob has hecn working very
hard so far on weights and really
going all out in the water. He's
hound to be a top U.S. collegiate
flyer very soon."
The women's team also pro
duced good times. Perhaps the
most "awesome" event, as
Gaughran called it, was the 1650
freestyle. Five Stanford women
met the AIAW qualifying time
easily — tin; lifth place swimmer
was 19 seconds under the Na
tionals' cut-off time.
Anne Brodell swam to a first
place finish in 17:13.50. Valerie
Lee placed second with 17:14.81,
and Jo Harshbarger finished
third with 17:15.08. Judy Hud
son and Kim I'eyton also qual
ified.
"Anne seems to be getting
stronger every meet," assistant
coach Debbie Meyer said. "She's
done some good personal best
times this year and she'll be a
great asset in the distance free
events."
Kim I'eyton,a gold medalist on
the U.S. women's 400 free relay
team in Montreal, won the 200
free in 1:53.33. In setting a new
pool record, Peyton broke the
old murk of 1:54.16 set in 1976
by Heather Creenwood of USC.
"Kim will be the first girl to go
under 50 seconds in the 100 free
and the first to go under 1:50 in
the 200 free," Meyer predicted.
Good performances
Meyer was happy with frosh
Judy Hudson's performances
last weekend. Hudson, <1 '72 and
'76 Australian Olympian,
placed first in the 400 IM in
4:38.60. She also captured tin'
200 breaststroke in 2:29.45 and
second in the 200 fly in 2:10.82.
"Judy never ceases to amaze
me," Meyer said. "She's the
most versatile swimmer 011 the
women's team. If there is a weak
event, we can put her in it and
she'll do well."

Head swim coach Jim Caugh
ran called Saturday's Stanford
Invitational Championships a
"developmental" meet. But the
Cardinal swimmers did not take
the meet lightly, breaking a slew
of pool records.
Olympic gold medalist Mike
Bruner set a new deCuerre re
cord in winning the 500-
freestyle in 4:26.85. The sopho
more from Stockton broke the
□ Id mark of 4:26.028 set in 1975
by USC's John Naber. lie bet
tered his personal best time of
4:27.81 made as a freshman in
197 5 and now owns the best
500-freestyle time ever obtained
in the Cards' history.
Pool mark
Bruner also set a pool record in
the 200-free. He swam to a
1:40.26 first place finish, break
ing fht! deCuerre Pool record of
1:41.02, set in 1975 by UCLA's
Tim McDonnel. Bruner also es
tablished a men's varsity record
by beating former Card Craig
VanZandt's time of 1:40.88 set in

-1975.
Bruner's 200 fly time of
1:50.25 bettered any mark he had
as a freshman. He took last year
off to train for the Olympics.
"I felt good in the water,"
Bruner said, "but I always feel
good in the 200 fly. I was disap
pointed that I didn't break a 1:50
in the 200 fly because I think
those barriers should be broken
early in the season so that by the
time NCAAs roll around in
March, I feel better about the race
psychologically."
Outstanding job
"Mike is doing an outstanding
job," Claughran said. "His 200
free time was his best short
course time ever. He is also
sprinting better than he used to
and is a possibility for our sprint
(400 free) relay."
Junior co-captain Stuart Cor
liss also had a good meet, dis
playing top pre-season form. He
had a lifetime best of 4:15.63 in
the 400 intermediate. In the 100
and 200-yard breaststroke he
came in a close second to Cal's

Graham Smith, a member of the
'76 Canadian Olympic team and
the third-ranked breaststroker in
the world.
"Stu did especially well in the
200 breaststroke," Gaughran
said. "He is already down to
2:10.04." Corliss is close to his
best time of 2:07.86 and is less
than a second off the NCAA
qualifying time.
Olympian
Gaughran was encouraged
by the performances of
freshmen Paul llartloff and bob
Hagberg. Hartloff, .a distance
freestyler who captured seventh
place in the 1500-meter free in
Montreal last summer, came in
second in the 1650-yard free
Saturday with a 16:01.08. He
finished third in the 500-yard
free with a time of 4:41.68.
"All of Paul's races were good
swims,"Gaughran said. "When I
saw him swim in high school he
really didn't get moving until
the end of the season."
Hagberg, a prep All-America
butterflyer from South Hadley,
Mass., swam well in the 100 fly
with a first place time of 51.40.
"Bob has hecn working very
hard so far on weights and really
going all out in the water. He's
hound to be a top U.S. collegiate
flyer very soon."
The women's team also pro
duced good times. Perhaps the
most "awesome" event, as
Gaughran called it, was the 1650
freestyle. Five Stanford women
met the AIAW qualifying time
easily — tin; lifth place swimmer
was 19 seconds under the Na
tionals' cut-off time.
Anne Brodell swam to a first
place finish in 17:13.50. Valerie
Lee placed second with 17:14.81,
and Jo Harshbarger finished
third with 17:15.08. Judy Hud
son and Kim I'eyton also qual
ified.
"Anne seems to be getting
stronger every meet," assistant
coach Debbie Meyer said. "She's
done some good personal best
times this year and she'll be a
great asset in the distance free
events."
Kim I'eyton,a gold medalist on
the U.S. women's 400 free relay
team in Montreal, won the 200
free in 1:53.33. In setting a new
pool record, Peyton broke the
old murk of 1:54.16 set in 1976
by Heather Creenwood of USC.
"Kim will be the first girl to go
under 50 seconds in the 100 free
and the first to go under 1:50 in
the 200 free," Meyer predicted.
Good performances
Meyer was happy with frosh
Judy Hudson's performances
last weekend. Hudson, <1 '72 and
'76 Australian Olympian,
placed first in the 400 IM in
4:38.60. She also captured tin'
200 breaststroke in 2:29.45 and
second in the 200 fly in 2:10.82.
"Judy never ceases to amaze
me," Meyer said. "She's the
most versatile swimmer 011 the
women's team. If there is a weak
event, we can put her in it and
she'll do well."

course time ever. He is also
sprinting better than he used to
and is a possibility for our sprint
(400 free) relay."
Junior co-captain Stuart Cor
liss also had a good meet, dis
playing top pre-season form. He
had a lifetime best of 4:15.63 in
the 400 intermediate. In the 100
and 200-yard breaststroke he
came in a close second to Cal's

Graham Smith, a member of the
'76 Canadian Olympic team and
the third-ranked breaststroker in
the world.
"Stu did especially well in the
200 breaststroke," Gaughran
said. "He is already down to
2:10.04." Corliss is close to his
best time of 2:07.86 and is less
than a second off the NCAA
qualifying time.
Olympian
Gaughran was encouraged
by the performances of
freshmen Paul llartloff and bob
Hagberg. Hartloff, .a distance
freestyler who captured seventh
place in the 1500-meter free in
Montreal last summer, came in
second in the 1650-yard free
Saturday with a 16:01.08. He
finished third in the 500-yard
free with a time of 4:41.68.
"All of Paul's races were good
swims,"Gaughran said. "When I
saw him swim in high school he
really didn't get moving until
the end of the season."
Hagberg, a prep All-America
butterflyer from South Hadley,
Mass., swam well in the 100 fly
with a first place time of 51.40.
"Bob has hecn working very
hard so far on weights and really
going all out in the water. He's
hound to be a top U.S. collegiate
flyer very soon."
The women's team also pro
duced good times. Perhaps the
most "awesome" event, as
Gaughran called it, was the 1650
freestyle. Five Stanford women
met the AIAW qualifying time
easily — tin; lifth place swimmer
was 19 seconds under the Na
tionals' cut-off time.
Anne Brodell swam to a first
place finish in 17:13.50. Valerie
Lee placed second with 17:14.81,
and Jo Harshbarger finished
third with 17:15.08. Judy Hud
son and Kim I'eyton also qual
ified.
"Anne seems to be getting
stronger every meet," assistant
coach Debbie Meyer said. "She's
done some good personal best
times this year and she'll be a
great asset in the distance free
events."
Kim I'eyton,a gold medalist on
the U.S. women's 400 free relay
team in Montreal, won the 200
free in 1:53.33. In setting a new
pool record, Peyton broke the
old murk of 1:54.16 set in 1976
by Heather Creenwood of USC.
"Kim will be the first girl to go
under 50 seconds in the 100 free
and the first to go under 1:50 in
the 200 free," Meyer predicted.
Good performances
Meyer was happy with frosh
Judy Hudson's performances
last weekend. Hudson, <1 '72 and
'76 Australian Olympian,
placed first in the 400 IM in
4:38.60. She also captured tin'
200 breaststroke in 2:29.45 and
second in the 200 fly in 2:10.82.
"Judy never ceases to amaze
me," Meyer said. "She's the
most versatile swimmer 011 the
women's team. If there is a weak
event, we can put her in it and
she'll do well."

ran called Saturday's Stanford
Invitational Championships a
"developmental" meet. But the
Cardinal swimmers did not take
the meet lightly, breaking a slew
of pool records.
Olympic gold medalist Mike
Bruner set a new deCuerre re
cord in winning the 500-
freestyle in 4:26.85. The sopho
more from Stockton broke the

by USC's John Naber. lie bet
tered his personal best time of
4:27.81 made as a freshman in
197 5 and now owns the best
500-freestyle time ever obtained
in the Cards' history.
Pool mark
Bruner also set a pool record in
the 200-free. He swam to a
1:40.26 first place finish, break
ing fht! deCuerre Pool record of
1:41.02, set in 1975 by UCLA's
Tim McDonnel. Bruner also es
tablished a men's varsity record
by beating former Card Craig
VanZandt's time of 1:40.88 set in

-1975.
Bruner's 200 fly time of
1:50.25 bettered any mark he had
as a freshman. He took last year
off to train for the Olympics.
"I felt good in the water,"
Bruner said, "but I always feel
good in the 200 fly. I was disap
pointed that I didn't break a 1:50
in the 200 fly because I think
those barriers should be broken
early in the season so that by the
time NCAAs roll around in

psychologically."

Head swim coach Jim Caugh
ran called Saturday's Stanford
Invitational Championships a
"developmental" meet. But the
Cardinal swimmers did not take
the meet lightly, breaking a slew
of pool records.
Olympic gold medalist Mike
Bruner set a new deCuerre re
cord in winning the 500-
freestyle in 4:26.85. The sopho
more from Stockton broke the
□ Id mark of 4:26.028 set in 1975
by USC's John Naber. lie bet
tered his personal best time of
4:27.81 made as a freshman in
197 5 and now owns the best
500-freestyle time ever obtained
in the Cards' history.
Pool mark
Bruner also set a pool record in
the 200-free. He swam to a
1:40.26 first place finish, break
ing fht! deCuerre Pool record of
1:41.02, set in 1975 by UCLA's
Tim McDonnel. Bruner also es
tablished a men's varsity record
by beating former Card Craig
VanZandt's time of 1:40.88 set in

-1975.
Bruner's 200 fly time of
1:50.25 bettered any mark he had
as a freshman. He took last year
off to train for the Olympics.
"I felt good in the water,"
Bruner said, "but I always feel
good in the 200 fly. I was disap
pointed that I didn't break a 1:50
in the 200 fly because I think
those barriers should be broken
early in the season so that by the
time NCAAs roll around in
March, I feel better about the race
psychologically."
Outstanding job
"Mike is doing an outstanding
job," Claughran said. "His 200
free time was his best short
course time ever. He is also
sprinting better than he used to
and is a possibility for our sprint
(400 free) relay."
Junior co-captain Stuart Cor
liss also had a good meet, dis
playing top pre-season form. He
had a lifetime best of 4:15.63 in
the 400 intermediate. In the 100
and 200-yard breaststroke he
came in a close second to Cal's

Graham Smith, a member of the
'76 Canadian Olympic team and
the third-ranked breaststroker in
the world.
"Stu did especially well in the
200 breaststroke," Gaughran
said. "He is already down to
2:10.04." Corliss is close to his
best time of 2:07.86 and is less
than a second off the NCAA
qualifying time.
Olympian
Gaughran was encouraged
by the performances of
freshmen Paul llartloff and bob
Hagberg. Hartloff, .a distance
freestyler who captured seventh
place in the 1500-meter free in
Montreal last summer, came in
second in the 1650-yard free
Saturday with a 16:01.08. He
finished third in the 500-yard
free with a time of 4:41.68.
"All of Paul's races were good
swims,"Gaughran said. "When I
saw him swim in high school he
really didn't get moving until
the end of the season."
Hagberg, a prep All-America
butterflyer from South Hadley,
Mass., swam well in the 100 fly
with a first place time of 51.40.
"Bob has hecn working very
hard so far on weights and really
going all out in the water. He's
hound to be a top U.S. collegiate
flyer very soon."
The women's team also pro
duced good times. Perhaps the
most "awesome" event, as
Gaughran called it, was the 1650
freestyle. Five Stanford women
met the AIAW qualifying time
easily — tin; lifth place swimmer
was 19 seconds under the Na
tionals' cut-off time.
Anne Brodell swam to a first
place finish in 17:13.50. Valerie
Lee placed second with 17:14.81,
and Jo Harshbarger finished
third with 17:15.08. Judy Hud
son and Kim I'eyton also qual
ified.
"Anne seems to be getting
stronger every meet," assistant
coach Debbie Meyer said. "She's
done some good personal best
times this year and she'll be a
great asset in the distance free
events."
Kim I'eyton,a gold medalist on
the U.S. women's 400 free relay
team in Montreal, won the 200
free in 1:53.33. In setting a new
pool record, Peyton broke the
old murk of 1:54.16 set in 1976
by Heather Creenwood of USC.
"Kim will be the first girl to go
under 50 seconds in the 100 free
and the first to go under 1:50 in
the 200 free," Meyer predicted.
Good performances
Meyer was happy with frosh
Judy Hudson's performances
last weekend. Hudson, <1 '72 and
'76 Australian Olympian,
placed first in the 400 IM in
4:38.60. She also captured tin'
200 breaststroke in 2:29.45 and
second in the 200 fly in 2:10.82.
"Judy never ceases to amaze
me," Meyer said. "She's the
most versatile swimmer 011 the
women's team. If there is a weak
event, we can put her in it and
she'll do well."

The women's team also pro
duced good times. Perhaps the
most "awesome" event, as
Gaughran called it, was the 1650
freestyle. Five Stanford women
met the AIAW qualifying time
easily — tin; lifth place swimmer
was 19 seconds under the Na
tionals' cut-off time.
Anne Brodell swam to a first
place finish in 17:13.50. Valerie
Lee placed second with 17:14.81,
and Jo Harshbarger finished
third with 17:15.08. Judy Hud
son and Kim I'eyton also qual
ified.
"Anne seems to be getting
stronger every meet," assistant
coach Debbie Meyer said. "She's
done some good personal best
times this year and she'll be a
great asset in the distance free
events."
Kim I'eyton,a gold medalist on
the U.S. women's 400 free relay
team in Montreal, won the 200
free in 1:53.33. In setting a new
pool record, Peyton broke the
old murk of 1:54.16 set in 1976
by Heather Creenwood of USC.
"Kim will be the first girl to go
under 50 seconds in the 100 free
and the first to go under 1:50 in
the 200 free," Meyer predicted.
Good performances
Meyer was happy with frosh
Judy Hudson's performances
last weekend. Hudson, <1 '72 and
'76 Australian Olympian,
placed first in the 400 IM in
4:38.60. She also captured tin'
200 breaststroke in 2:29.45 and
second in the 200 fly in 2:10.82.
"Judy never ceases to amaze
me," Meyer said. "She's the
most versatile swimmer 011 the
women's team. If there is a weak
event, we can put her in it and
she'll do well."

Head swim coach Jim Caugh
ran called Saturday's Stanford
Invitational Championships a
"developmental" meet. But the
Cardinal swimmers did not take
the meet lightly, breaking a slew
of pool records.
Olympic gold medalist Mike
Bruner set a new deCuerre re
cord in winning the 500-
freestyle in 4:26.85. The sopho
more from Stockton broke the
□ Id mark of 4:26.028 set in 1975
by USC's John Naber. lie bet
tered his personal best time of
4:27.81 made as a freshman in
197 5 and now owns the best
500-freestyle time ever obtained
in the Cards' history.
Pool mark
Bruner also set a pool record in
the 200-free. He swam to a
1:40.26 first place finish, break
ing fht! deCuerre Pool record of
1:41.02, set in 1975 by UCLA's
Tim McDonnel. Bruner also es
tablished a men's varsity record
by beating former Card Craig
VanZandt's time of 1:40.88 set in

-1975.
Bruner's 200 fly time of
1:50.25 bettered any mark he had
as a freshman. He took last year
off to train for the Olympics.
"I felt good in the water,"
Bruner said, "but I always feel
good in the 200 fly. I was disap
pointed that I didn't break a 1:50
in the 200 fly because I think
those barriers should be broken
early in the season so that by the
time NCAAs roll around in
March, I feel better about the race
psychologically."
Outstanding job
"Mike is doing an outstanding
job," Claughran said. "His 200
free time was his best short
course time ever. He is also
sprinting better than he used to
and is a possibility for our sprint
(400 free) relay."
Junior co-captain Stuart Cor
liss also had a good meet, dis
playing top pre-season form. He
had a lifetime best of 4:15.63 in
the 400 intermediate. In the 100
and 200-yard breaststroke he
came in a close second to Cal's

Graham Smith, a member of the
'76 Canadian Olympic team and
the third-ranked breaststroker in
the world.
"Stu did especially well in the
200 breaststroke," Gaughran
said. "He is already down to
2:10.04." Corliss is close to his
best time of 2:07.86 and is less
than a second off the NCAA
qualifying time.
Olympian
Gaughran was encouraged
by the performances of
freshmen Paul llartloff and bob
Hagberg. Hartloff, .a distance
freestyler who captured seventh
place in the 1500-meter free in
Montreal last summer, came in
second in the 1650-yard free
Saturday with a 16:01.08. He
finished third in the 500-yard
free with a time of 4:41.68.
"All of Paul's races were good
swims,"Gaughran said. "When I
saw him swim in high school he
really didn't get moving until
the end of the season."
Hagberg, a prep All-America
butterflyer from South Hadley,
Mass., swam well in the 100 fly
with a first place time of 51.40.
"Bob has hecn working very
hard so far on weights and really
going all out in the water. He's
hound to be a top U.S. collegiate
flyer very soon."
The women's team also pro
duced good times. Perhaps the
most "awesome" event, as
Gaughran called it, was the 1650

Head swim coach Jim Caugh
ran called Saturday's Stanford
Invitational Championships a
"developmental" meet. But the
Cardinal swimmers did not take
the meet lightly, breaking a slew
of pool records.
Olympic gold medalist Mike
Bruner set a new deCuerre re
cord in winning the 500-
freestyle in 4:26.85. The sopho
more from Stockton broke the
□ Id mark of 4:26.028 set in 1975
by USC's John Naber. lie bet
tered his personal best time of
4:27.81 made as a freshman in
197 5 and now owns the best
500-freestyle time ever obtained
in the Cards' history.
Pool mark
Bruner also set a pool record in
the 200-free. He swam to a
1:40.26 first place finish, break
ing fht! deCuerre Pool record of
1:41.02, set in 1975 by UCLA's
Tim McDonnel. Bruner also es
tablished a men's varsity record
by beating former Card Craig
VanZandt's time of 1:40.88 set in

-1975.
Bruner's 200 fly time of
1:50.25 bettered any mark he had
as a freshman. He took last year
off to train for the Olympics.
"I felt good in the water,"
Bruner said, "but I always feel
good in the 200 fly. I was disap
pointed that I didn't break a 1:50
in the 200 fly because I think
those barriers should be broken
early in the season so that by the
time NCAAs roll around in
March, I feel better about the race
psychologically."
Outstanding job
"Mike is doing an outstanding
job," Claughran said. "His 200
free time was his best short
course time ever. He is also
sprinting better than he used to
and is a possibility for our sprint
(400 free) relay."
Junior co-captain Stuart Cor
liss also had a good meet, dis
playing top pre-season form. He
had a lifetime best of 4:15.63 in
the 400 intermediate. In the 100
and 200-yard breaststroke he
came in a close second to Cal's

Graham Smith, a member of the
'76 Canadian Olympic team and
the third-ranked breaststroker in
the world.
"Stu did especially well in the
200 breaststroke," Gaughran
said. "He is already down to
2:10.04." Corliss is close to his
best time of 2:07.86 and is less
than a second off the NCAA
qualifying time.
Olympian
Gaughran was encouraged
by the performances of
freshmen Paul llartloff and bob
Hagberg. Hartloff, .a distance
freestyler who captured seventh
place in the 1500-meter free in
Montreal last summer, came in
second in the 1650-yard free
Saturday with a 16:01.08. He
finished third in the 500-yard
free with a time of 4:41.68.
"All of Paul's races were good
swims,"Gaughran said. "When I
saw him swim in high school he
really didn't get moving until
the end of the season."
Hagberg, a prep All-America
butterflyer from South Hadley,
Mass., swam well in the 100 fly
with a first place time of 51.40.
"Bob has hecn working very
hard so far on weights and really
going all out in the water. He's
hound to be a top U.S. collegiate
flyer very soon."
The women's team also pro
duced good times. Perhaps the
most "awesome" event, as
Gaughran called it, was the 1650
freestyle. Five Stanford women
met the AIAW qualifying time
easily — tin; lifth place swimmer
was 19 seconds under the Na
tionals' cut-off time.
Anne Brodell swam to a first
place finish in 17:13.50. Valerie
Lee placed second with 17:14.81,
and Jo Harshbarger finished
third with 17:15.08. Judy Hud
son and Kim I'eyton also qual
ified.
"Anne seems to be getting
stronger every meet," assistant
coach Debbie Meyer said. "She's
done some good personal best
times this year and she'll be a
great asset in the distance free
events."
Kim I'eyton,a gold medalist on
the U.S. women's 400 free relay
team in Montreal, won the 200
free in 1:53.33. In setting a new
pool record, Peyton broke the
old murk of 1:54.16 set in 1976
by Heather Creenwood of USC.
"Kim will be the first girl to go
under 50 seconds in the 100 free
and the first to go under 1:50 in
the 200 free," Meyer predicted.
Good performances
Meyer was happy with frosh
Judy Hudson's performances
last weekend. Hudson, <1 '72 and
'76 Australian Olympian,
placed first in the 400 IM in
4:38.60. She also captured tin'
200 breaststroke in 2:29.45 and
second in the 200 fly in 2:10.82.
"Judy never ceases to amaze
me," Meyer said. "She's the
most versatile swimmer 011 the
women's team. If there is a weak
event, we can put her in it and
she'll do well."
