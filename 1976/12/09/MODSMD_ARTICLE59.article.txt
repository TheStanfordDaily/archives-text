# Plowing the Farm
## A 						farewell 
### Paul Bauman 
This is what's known in tin? journalism busi
ness as a "farewell column."
I retire as a Daily sports editor today.
That statement, I imagine, is greeted by
thunderous cheers from a lew athletes who
have been ruthlessly castigated by me in the
past, and by a resounding chorus of "NMD" (no
big deal) by everyone else.
I can't say I blame any of you.
Anyway, after V/ 2 years of writing story after
story (some of them good, some of them unbe
lievably bad), staying up until ungodly hours
ol the morning, and missing meal after meal,
it's time to return to a more or loss "normal"
existence.
I may writea story ortwoafter Christmas,but
lor all practical purposes this is it.
I'lusses and minuses
Writing for the Daily, and for the UCLA
Daily liruin when I was a freshman there, has
had its plusses and minuses. So. in this last
literary ellort as a sports editor, I'd like to relate
my most enjoyable newspaper experiences
,ind my least enjoyable. If you'd jnst as soon
skip all this, fine, hut remember that the alter
native may be listening to your professor.
Ready gang?
Things I've enjoyed most:
Sitting down .it I he typewriter and watch
ing the words just How out. It happens every
now and then.
Working with Chris Maker, my co-sports
editor and the hardest working individual I've
ever Mien. The Daily is absolutely indebted In
Maker. It's too bad you all can't fully appreciate
him. I just hope the Daily staff does.
Playing touch football for the Daily Satur
day mornings, then watching the varsity play
in the Stadium and realizing the Daily team
isn't so bad after all.
—Meeting tennis player Nancy Kudd. I
never enjoyed interviewing anybody so much
because most of our conversation had nothing
to do with th«? story I was writing.
Meeting and knowing tennis coach Dick
Could, basketball coach Dick DiMiaso. assis
tant basketball coach Mob I rederick and toot

ball coach Jack Christiansen. Each is a great
man.
Koad games
Watching Stanford play football on the
road, especially at California.
—Complimenting a sportswriter on an arti
cle and watching him/her bubble with pride.
—Meing able to get free passes to 49ers',
Haiders'. Warriors', A's'and. yes, even (Hants'
games.
—While I'm on the subject of mooching, get
ting free rides to the Stanford-Michigan foot
ball game in Ann Arbor, Mich, and the
Stanford-Army game in West Point. N.Y. this
year.
Scenery
Sitting up in the press box at Army's Michie
Stadium and looking out over tree-covered rol
ling hills and the I ludson KiVer . . . one of the
most beautiful areas I've ever seen.
-Watching Stanford tennis matches in
Maples Pavilion . . . great players and .1 great
facility. Pure class. The lint; judging isn't so
hot, though.
Things I've enjoyed least:
Sitting down at the typewriter and not
being able even to punch the right keys, much
less formulate any decent sentences.
hrain drain
Wracking my brain lor hours to write a
story and knowing when I finish that, in terms
of studying, my work hasn't oven begun.
Watching Stanford home football games.
Dull. dull. dull.
(ioing to sleep at 4 a.m. and real i/.ing thai
my roommate, a swimmer who has to get up
early for workouts, has probably been asleep
for fivi? hours. At times, only two hours have
separated my bedtime and his waking time.
—Seeing disillusioned writers quit the Daily
largely because they haven't been given
enough encouragement.
-Editing stories. I hate it because it bogs me
down so much.
It looks like tfie plusses have it. I guess I've
enjoyed the past few years. I have.
Merry Christmas! a
