# Massage parlors lose again
## 
### Robert Mauro Staff writer 
Santa Clara County Superior Court
Judge Peter Anello yesterday denied
motions to dissolve the temporary re
straining order he issued against 17
local massage parlors and "adult
oriented" establishments.
The Dec. 3 order directed the Palo
Alto Police Department to close the es
tablishments and seize all the property
present pending a hearing regarding
allegations by the District Attorney's
Office that the businesses were in vio
lation of several sections of the Red
Light Abatement laws and Unfair Bus
iness Practices Act.
Donald Tenebaum, attorney for Phil
lip Skinner and James Hunt, owners of
the Streaker and Copenhagen, two es
tablishments closed in the raid, filed
one of the motions.
Tenebaum contended that the order
had been sought and issued without
notice to opposing counsel, that the
Red Light Abatement laws do not
apply to theaters, and that the court
overstepped its jurisdiction in order
ing the establishments closed.
Contesting denials
According to Tenebaum, he will file
two writs in Appeals Court tomorrow
contesting the denials.
In a supporting declaration. Skinner

stated, "While police officers were in
control of the premises. I made several
telephone calls to the theater
(Copenhagen). I did not reveal my
identity to the police officer answering
the phone. These officers did not iden
tify themselves as police officers but
pretended to be the operator of the
theater and attempted to solicit me to
engage in prostitution with their
'employees.' "
Denied charges
Investigations Captain Gary Tatum
denied these allegations and said that
while officers may have answered the
phones they did not, to his knowledge,
solicit any callers.
District Attorney Louis Hergna filed
statements claiming that the courts
have the authority under various Penal
Code sections to issue a temporary re
straining order pending a trial.
Hergna also listed Ferial Code sec
tions to support the contention that
buildings used for prostitution are
public nuisances and that evidence of
general reputation is admissable in
court for determining if a building is a
public nuisance.
Response filed
Attorneys for Joe and Diana Chew,
owners of the property in which the
Streaker, Magnifique. Pleasure Palace
and Creen Door were operating filed a
response to the "Order to Show
cause."
Don Louden of Palo Alto leased the
buildings from the Chews and then
sublet them. All of these buildings
were closed in the police raid.
The response filed on the Chews'
behalf claims that actions had already
been taken to terminate the leases. On
Dec.l, Louden was evicted and the
sublease holders given 30 days to vac

ate the premises.
According to the response, actions
have also been taken to re-let the pre
mises for purposes other than "adult"
entertainment. The Chews stated that
they were willing to agree to a perma
nent injunction against use of the pre
mises for such entertainment.
Deputy District Attorney Dennis
Lempert had previously signed com
plaints charging the raided establish
ments with unfair competition and
with unfair, deceptive, untrue, and

misleading representations as well as
violations of the Red Light Abatement
laws.
The complaints asked that the de
fendants be permanently enjoined
from directly or indirectly operating,
encouraging, or permitting any pre
mises to be used as a public nuisance
where acts of lewdness, gambling, or
prostitution occur.
In addition a $2500 penalty was
asked for each violation of the Civ il
Code perpetrated by the defendents.
