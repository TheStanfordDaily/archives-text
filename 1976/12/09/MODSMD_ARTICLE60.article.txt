## USF cracks zone, Cards

San Francisco —"We'd better enjoy it while it
lasts," said one Stanford fan of the Cardinals'
lb-10 early lead over the lOth-ranked USF Dons
Saturday at USF's War Memorial Gym.
Stanford head coach Dick Dißiaso dusted off
the same offense which the Cards used in last
year's 49-44 loss to USF at Maples Pavilion. And
just like last year, when Stanford jumped off to a
quick 12-0 lead, it worked early in the name.
But just like last year, USF scored a victory,
winning its liltli straight, 7U-59, before a sellout
crowd of 7000.
Close shots
The Cardinals took just two shots which we
ren't lay-ins during the first 20 minutes. Guard
Mike Brat/, worked the back-door play to perfec
tion twice in the early going, first accepting a pass
from center Jeff McHugh and then another from
freshman forward Kimberly Belton.

The Cards were intent on working the ball
around until they found an open man under the
basket. "It was our movement offense," said Di-
Biaso. "It's designed to see how well the other
team can play defense."
The Dons, with super sophomores Bill
Cartwright, James "Trouble" Hardy and NorCal
I'liiyer ol the Year Winford Boynes, couldn't play
defense very well.
Tough defense
And USF couldn't crack the zone defense Di-
Biaso drew up. The Dons couldn't get the ball
inside to Cartwright,lliirdy or Boynes,and their
guards were afraid to take an outside shot.
Helton, who gives away nearly five inches to the
e-foot-U'/i Cartwright, intimidated the towering
sophomore. Melton rejected two Cartwright shots
intheinitial six minutesofthefirst halfand put in
a shot over Cartwright.
When Belton wasn't intimidating Cartwright,
the freshman from New York was getting into a
talking anil pushing match with Hardy.
Referee Ernie Filiberti, who was ousted from
the Pacific-8 two years ago, and Pac-8 official Jack
Ditty acted as if they were working an NBA game,
allowing a lot of hand-checking and elbowing.
'Came to play'
"Adrian Dantley said at the end of theOlympics
that great players play well in big games," said
DiMiaso, a former Notre Dame assistant, "kim
berlv came to play tonight."
Belton led all scorers with 10 in the first half,
making four of six from the floor and two of four
from the free throw line. He also pulled down five
rebounds in the first half.
But it was only a matter of time until USF
started playing like the "NHA expansion franch
ise" that some have called it, and Stanford started
playing, well . . . like Stanford.
USF coach BobGaillard, dressed like an under
taker in a black velvet suit and bright orange shirt
with an open collar, inserted senior forward Mar
lon Redmond and senior guard Rod Williams to
give USF some outside scoring punch.
Zone busters
The pair, shooting from as faraway as Mountain
View, or so it seemed, began to hit 25-footers to
crack the Card zone. But Dißiaso decided to stay
