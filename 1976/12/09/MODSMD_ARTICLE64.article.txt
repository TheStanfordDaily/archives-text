I lie Stanford women's tennis team came
within one point ol winning the national
title last summer. The field hockey team is
the best in California and Nevada. The wo
men's cross country squad, in its second sea

eight invitational meets.
I I1 e increased interest in women's sports

complementing Stanford's six traditional

side. Now, the men's and the women's bas
ketball teams practice in Maples, the men's
and women's tennis teams practice on the
Viirsity Courts and, as already mentioned,
I lie men's and women's swim teams work
out at de( iuerre.
Male and I eniiile sports are now close at
Stanford physically and practically.
Naturally all this did not occur by magic.
I'lie big switch ( .line in March ol last year
when men's and women's athletics were
merged into one Department ol Alhlotiis.
Tli e women had been under the Department

ol Physical Kducation. obtaining their
meaner hinds entirol\ Irom Mie university
administration. The merger meant thai
linaiH inm ol women's atliletii s would come
out ol the same At hi otic Department lu nds as
did men's.
rite tueroei also resulted 111 the awarding

Vic ki I lays), three 111 tennis |ln Susie I lamev,

Mow much the inermei resulted Irom the
passing ol I itle l\ ol The 11imher Kduc ation
Amendments Ail ol I'ITJ. re(|iiirinm that
women he mivon "ec|iial opporlunities" in
athletic.s, is dehatahle \ssin ialo Direc loi ol
\lhletic s Pain Stratha 1r 11 seems to think the
inermer would have c ome ahout anyway.
Without I itle l\ Strathairn said, "we
would he doinm the same tliinms. that is we
would ho mo\ inm in the direc lion ol equity.
We prohahlv however, realistically, would
not he movinK as rapi(ll \ because ol the li
nam ial dimension that should he obvious to
anyone who reads the lhiil\ and all the othei
media we have; on the c ampus."
Strathairn was referring to the dilemma ol
having lo expand women's programs at the
same time Athletic Department funds are
hoi nu cut back because ol the samminm
economy.

Str.ithairn said the "equal opportunity"
provision ol Title l\ is "open to interpreta
t ion.
"Title l\ is considerably i onfusing as to
what is meant by equity." sin; said. "We
those not to interpret this as one-to-one
equal; we are rather going on the concept ol
fairness."
In terms ol scholarships and oppor
tunities, Stratliairn said Stanford has "one
set ol criteria for all sports and all teams. This
reflects the philosophy that athletic s are ath
letics are athletics. And athletes are athletes
are athletes. We've taken that position so
we don't fall into the trap of tokenism. That's
the greatest insult."
"Tokenism" is a word that arises Irom
time to time when discussing women's ath
letic s belore the merger. Hut now , thev are
anything but "token." Across the board,
Stanford female athletes sa\ the difference
the merger and time have made is tremend
" Thi' women's swimming program has
progressed an incredible amount," Mays
said. "When I first came here, the women's
team worked out at the Koble pool. The de-

We wore coached hy one of tin; instrm tors

Now. the women, likethe men. swim 1-1 1 j
hours in the morning three davs a week and
two hours in the afternoon every day. In
terms ol distance, they swim an average ol
six to eight miles a day. or three to lour times
as lar as before, lu addition to in-the-pool
work, the women do drv land exercises and
lift weights.
Second-year women's tennis coach Anne
Mill, who played at Stanford Irom 1W»B-7 1.
said thi! Athletic Department seems more
i oncerned about hei team since the merger.
"Heing under the Athletic: Department, "
Mill said, "I gel the feeding thev definitely

it's a whole! different structure. Helore. we
were just a part of the university like the
Department of Art or Knglish or anything
else. Now, we're part of theathletic program,
so to speak. So I think the department has
shown a lot ol interest and support toward
the women's team."
I lill said the level of intensity is also grea
ter now.

I ield lux kr\. along with women's swim
ming and tennis, is a big draw on campus.
School said that two or three years ago. the
a\ eiage ( rowd was and they were "all
personal Iriends ot the players." In contrast.
Ihe attendance .it last month's Western Keg
iiinals at Stanford was about 750.
So how have Stanford's male athletes
reai led to the upgrading ot women's sports
The merger aflected them as well as the wo
men. In sports such as tennis and swimming,
it ended the men's monopoly on the best
i oa< lies and the best facilities
I know last year there was a lot of resent
inent among the male athletes." Urodell said,
"because we were taking their facilities and
their coaches. It was something they'd al
ways had everything in.
"They didn't recognize the fact that il the
problem was. say. all the white students had
the best coaches, the best locker rooms and
all the best facilities, and all the black stu
dents didn't, they'd see how unfair that was
lint they couldn't see it with the men-women
I hi ng.
"I was bordering on being militantlv an
noyed." Urodell said about tint second-class
treatment accorded the women's swim team
before the merger. "All I could think about
was the black-white type of thing. It struck
me as so strange that t hey couldn't see it was
people. I! was people who were athletes. It
seemed like the AI hi el it Department should
put the same amount ol effort into giving
both sexes maximum opportunity to be their
best. I didn't see that then, and that really
amazed me."
Stuart Corliss, co-captain of the men's
swim team, agreed that there was some re
sentment initially, when the women joined
tlie men at de(aierre.
"That's kind of tlie wav I felt," Corliss said
"I'm sorry, the pool was getting crowded
Some ol flic girls were slower and they were
clogging up the lanes. II you wanted to go
last, you had to just mow them down."
Corl iss said he was annoyed by a (oat hi ng
problem wliii li arose after the mi Mger. Tile

women swimmers had ,i Hraduate assist,nil
to help them last year, hut C.auyhran as
sumed most ol the responsibility lor hot h the
men's and women's teams.

had a meet, and leaving lis in the other pool
not knowi what I lie hell we were doi
(lorliss said.
Oorliss said "the worst time was last
spring," when (iaiif»hran accompanied the
women to the nationals in Miami.
"We | the men| had the N( '.A A Champion
ships and the 14i 11s had the AIAVV Champ
ionships a week and <1 hall before. We
went lor a week before flit! N('AAs without a
coach. I can't believe it happened like that
That may explain why we did so shitty. Hut
now thai wo have two coaches
and Meyer). I don't think there will he a
problem .11 all."
Men's tennis coat h Dick ('.ould was also
concerned al lirst about the effects the
merger have on his team. I le now says
those doubts were "ill-founded."
"Mv ini lial I eel i 11,n was out! of a lit tie bit til
skepth ism," (lould said. "We wen? 1
oil ol back-to-back national championships
and very Iranklv. I was a little bit concerned
lest something he done that would,
'rock the boat," as far as financial support or
support ol the people in the area was 1:011-
t erned.
"At tually. our men's team has not been
hurt at all by the merger. In fact, in some
ways. I would assume it has helped overall
morale. I have seen 110 detrimental effet I al
al I 011 our men's team."
All this is not meant to imply that every
thing is rosy 111 women's athletics. There's
si ill plenty ol room lor progress.

With the men, the priority has always
been on getting some of the best
coaches in the country. But with the
women, it's been (on getting) any P. E.

I know last year there was a lot of
