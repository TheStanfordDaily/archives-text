The mens intramural 'B' touch football final
Sunday between Los Arcos and the BSU (Black
Students' Union), won by Arcos 12-7, seemed
chaotic on the surface. Receivers ran patterns like
"go long" or "get open," the rushers were told to
get the quarterback and the center occasionally
had to count the numbei of players on the line to
make sure that his team was in a legal formation.
Off the field, roughly 60 spectators buzzed ab
out, some drinking beer, others yelling encour
agement to their friends in the game, most yelling
less inspiring epithets at the referees, and all
wondering if they shouldn't have been home
studying instead.
The most accomplished football players pre
sent stood on the sidelines. Varsity gridders Dave
Strong, Bruce Barker and John Finley cheered for
the BSU team, only able to surest plays.
Atmosphere different
The atmosphere clearly lacked the pomp and
ritual of football as we usually t hi nk of it. The only
uniforms were worn by the referees. The players
went shirts and skins. There was no scoreboard,
just a red alarm clock on the sidelines. The coin
toss looked like a mocking parody of big time
football.

The action of the first half would have led you to
the conclusion that the game consisted of nothing
more than two collections of frustrated jocks battl
ing to gratify their egos. Each play was followed
by the ritual of verbally abusing the referees and
the opposition. A lot of the touches resembled
tackles.
Most of the half was played on the HSU 10-yard
line. Arcos quarterback Joe McCoy kept picking
apart the BSU zone with passes to Chris Hulburd
and Kevin Bissonnette, but each time Arcos began
to threaten, the BSU defense, behind Rodney
Buie, Warner Session and Terry Shelton, started
to bat down McCoy's missiles.
Collisions
The only interesting aspect of the game was the
size of the seismic shock waves set oft by the
collision of Arcos's huge linemen. Don Pena and
Jeff Little, with BSU's bigger linemen, 240-pound
Tommy Myers and A 1 Perry. After being thwarted
repeatedly down by the goal line, McCoy hit Bisson
nette on the button-hook with eight seconds left to
give his team a 6-0 lead at the half.
During the intermission, one could im
mediately tell which team was winning. The
Arcos huddle was calm. The BSU huddle was
frantic. About five people tried to shout sugges-

tions to BSU QB Rick Turner.
The second half began like the first, except this
time the action took place between the :iO-yard
lines. It was clear that Arcos's safeties could not
keep up with BSU's swift receivers, Orlando
Mayes and Andre Harris. But Turner does not
have McCoy's arm. Turner underthrew open re
ceivers on long patterns twice for interceptions.
The fans began to lose interest. There were re
criminations on the BSU side of the field: "Just
throw the ball."
Throughout the game, BSU demonstrated that
it had the better athletes and this was clearly the
source of its frustration. But in football, the best
athletes don't win, the best team wins. With two
minutes left, the BSU team finally recognized
this. In a masterfully designed series of plays
exhibiting excellent teamwork, the BSU offense
made its move.
Turner pitched to halfback Larry Broussard,
who had run for some yardage on pitches earlier
in the game. Broussard then heaved a long bomb
to Orlando Mayes, who had opened up a gap on
Arcos safety Terry McCartin. McCartin hit Maves
early on the five-yard line. Pass interference
BSU had its first penetration.
