# Bowl predictions
## Wait'til New Year's 
### Dave Smith 
As usual, the Peach is rotten, the Sun is in
eclipse and the Astro-Bluebonnet is a second
rate spread. No football games will keep you
from switching to C.uy Lombardo on New
Year's Eve.
College football fans will save their peanuts
and sportswriters their juiciest cliches for New
Year's Day. when this year's bowl games will
finally have more to offer than color, pageantry
and intense boredom. Those who wait until
Jan. 1 to view any more college football can
consider themselves doubly fortunate.
Liberty Bowl. Dec. 20: UCLA (9-1-1) vs.
Alabama (H-U). The Bruins deserved better than
this Monday night matchup against a team that
hasn't won a tough game all year. Unlike last
year. Paul "Bear" Bryant couldn't shop around
for a bowl opponent that would assure him a
win — and Jeff Dankworth. Dr. Death, et. al.,
will assure that lie doesn't get one. UCLA HI.
Alabama 14.
Fiesta Bowl, Dec. 25: Oklahoma (8-2-1) vs.
Wyoming (8-3). None of the major networks
picked up this game — anyone who would
want to watch Wyoming play football on
Christmas must be deranged. The bowl's spon
sors have probably been in shock since Arizona
State collapsed. Oklahoma 42, Wyoming 10.
Gator Bowl. Dec. 27: Notre Dame (8-3) vs.
Penn State (7-4). Two big-name nothings go at
it. Notre Dame 24, Penn State 7.
Peach Bowl, Dec. 31: North Carolina (9-2) vs.
Kentucky (7-4). A unique matchup, as a publi
cist might say, because neither team is in the
top 20. and neither is of even marginal interest
to anyone but a select group of alumni and
insatiable bettors.
Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl, Dec. 31: Texas Tech
(9-1) vs. Nebraska (7-3-1). Another disappoint
ing season for Cornhusker coach Tom Osborne,
who had enough talent to win the Big Eight but
ended upinj u st a not her wa rmu pbo wl. He wi 11
win here — but no one will be watching. Neb
raska 20, Tech 21.
Sugar Bowl, Jan. 1: Pittsburgh (11-0) vs.
Georgia (10-1). The East shall rise again in this
first of two worthwhile New Year's struggles.
Pitt has already collected something called the
Cool-Ray Cup (not to mention the Lambert

Trophy), but it will be a long time before the
Panthers have a shot at the national champion
ship again. Even God (who is supposedly a
Trojan) couldn't keep Tony Dorsett from
sweeping the Heisman Trophy this season, and
a good (ieorgia defense will find that he's the
finest back to face the Bulldogs in a long time.
This one will make that later affair in Pasadena
academic — which is not to say uninteresting.
Pitt 21, Georgia 18.
Cotton Bowl, Jan. 1: Maryland (11-0) vs.
I louston (W-2). Compared to the other games on
New Year's, this one should be just a diversion.
It's still a chance for two teams with great re
cords to get some national exposure. Unfortu
nately both squads are the sort that likes to
pummel its opponents with a rushing offense.
One computer rated Maryland's schedule
tougher than top-ranked Pitt's. That doesn't
mean that the Terps are as good, though. I lous
ton 2M. Maryland 13.
Rose Bowl. Jan. 1: USC (10-1) vs. Michigan
(10-1). The nation's two most talented teams
meeting in the "grandaddv of all the bowls" —
it would have brought a tear to Amos Alonzo
Stagg's eye. For once, Michigan, with a sup
posedly mellower Bo Schembechler in com
mand, will be the sentimental favorite, but few
people realize how good the Trojans can be.
Some of their defenders would be right at home
on the Oakland Raiders, and their offense has
players just as talented. The spirit of former
coaching genius John McKay still hovers over
the Trojan playbook, and coach John Robinson
is more conservative than he has to be, but not
even an amazingly strong Wolverine backfield
can outgain this team. USC 27, Michigan 24.
Orange Bowl. |an. 1: Ohio State (H-2-1) vs
Colorado (H-3). It will be awfully tough to stay
interested by the time this game comes on tin
tube, especially for those people who are com
pulsive Buckeye-loathers. In three national T\
appearances this year all Woody I layes provec
was that this year's squad isn't quite what tin
older versions were. But that's still enough tr
handle another unknown team from the Bij,
Eight. Pleasant dreams. Ohio State 20, Col
