# IM roundup
## Zetes, Arcos win grid crowns 
### Bill Wernecke 
Zeta Bsi won its eighth 'A' in
tramural football championship
in nine years last weekend with a
13-0 win over the DUs, and Los
Arcos upset top-ranked Soto for
a 13-7 victory in the coed final.
The Zete-DU game was a real
defensive battle in the first half.
On the first play of the second
half, the Zete pass rush forced
the DUs' Tom Gordon to throw
weakly, and Neil Erickson inter
cepted. Two plays later,
Duquette hit Joel Erickson in the
corner of the end zone for a 30-
yard TD. Jim Erickson caught
Duquette's extra point pass for a
7-0 Zete lead.
Gamble
With time running out, the
DUs were forced to gamble on a
fourth down play on their own
25-yard line. They were stopped
and the Zetes took over, scoring
on the next play with a trick
maneuver.
The ball was snapped short to
back Gharlie Hepworth, who
faked a pitch right to QB

Duquette and instead pitched
left to end Joel Erickson, who in
turn hit brother Jim Erickson for
the score. The game ended 13-o.'
In the coed game, all the scor
ing took place in the first half.
Soto scored on the game's first
series, but was effectively shut
out thereafter. Corky Davis'
40-yard run and PAT pass to
Bill Maloney gave Soto an early
7-0 lead.
McCartin sack
On its second series, Soto
moved inside the Arcos 20-yard
line, butaTerryMcGartinsackof
Davis stopped the drive. Soon af
ter, Los Arcos QB Duane Davis
hit Ed Streeter on a long bomb.
Streeter hauled it in on the 10-
yard line and went in for the
score. The BAT failed, so Soto
still led 7-6.
Just before halftime, Jeff Little
intercepted for Los Arcos at mid
field. McCartin was interfered
with, putting the ball inside the
Soto 10-yard line. With three
seconds left, Davis hit McCartin
for the winning TD. McCartin

also caught the BAT for a 13-7
Arcos lead.
In all, IM championships were
decided in 13 different areas last
weekend. The race for the men's
IM team title looks to be a toss-up
between the Bhi Delts, Zetes.
Theta Delts and JRA, while Les
Vaches leads in its quest for a
second straight women's crown.
In an all-Bhysics Dept. final,
the Leptons (Bill Colson and
Rich Teets) beat the defending
champs and top-seeded As
tronomical Unit (Vahe Betrosian
and Dick Zdarko), in the 'A'
two-man volleyball champion
ship match by a 15-13 score.
Leaping Leptons
The Leptons advanced to the
finals only after winning a very
difficult 15-13,15-12 match over
Old-Timers Bill Witscher and
Don Holve. In the finals, how
ever, after a tough first game
featuring sky-high spikes by Bro
fessor "Nature of the Universe"
Betrosian, the Leptons played
almost flawlessly in the second
game to win the title.

In the 'B' two-man volleyball
finals, Theta Chi 111 (Brian Latta
and Dave Unietis) upset their
practice mates, Theta Chi I (Bob
Lloyd and Jeff Ipsen), in a drama

with two-set wins, the Theta Chi
111 duo beating Lambda Nu I
15-10, 15-11, and Lloyd-Ipsen
handing Serra 811 a 15-9, 15-7
setback.
The fourth-seeded Theta Chi I
team had beaten the eventual
champs almost every time it
practiced, but the Latta-Unietis
combination came through
when it counted.
Tired from a semifinal victory
concluded only an hour earlier,
they nevertheless rallied from an
8-8 tie in thefinal gamefora 13-8
lead that was just good enough
to stand up.
Women's volleyball
In women's volleyball, the
Mirrielees team of Ellen Merrick
and Lori Huebner defeated Ar
royo's Kathy Pike and Beth
Robertson 15-8,15-1 for the title.

match, Arroyo (Todd katzman
