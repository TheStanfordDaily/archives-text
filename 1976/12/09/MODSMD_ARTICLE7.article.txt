## Editorials Lyman moves on C-15: commendable action 
### 
President Richard Lyman moved last week to
reconvene the Committee of 15 (C-15). In doing
so, Lyman has opened the door to immediate
and important discussion of the judicial pro
cesses governing members of the community.
Perhaps the administration realized that
there are some issues in this area which need
thoughtful consideration and action, since Ly
man's move has speeded the process of recon
vening the C-15 — and saved time which can
better be put to use discussing the issues out
lined by the ASSU Senate.
Lyman wrote to the C-15 that he is particu
larly concerned with one of the seven issues
which the senate outlined: establishing a stu
dent option on public or private hearing be
fore the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC).
Lyman also pointed out that two other issues
— establishing a formal body for educating the
community about the Honor Code and discus
sion of faculty Honor Code violations — are
also being considered in the Student Conduct
Legislative Council's consideration of the
Honor Code. Lyman urged the C-15 to work
expeditiously with the Council and to avoid
duplication of work. These two bodies should
attempt to resolve Honor Code problems as
soon as possible.
As for the other four issues which the senate

has outlined, the C-15 should consider first
those issues which are more likely to meet with
agreement in the three constituencies which
the C-15 represents — students, faculty and
administration.
These issues are: a proposed automatic
yearly meeting of the C-15, allowing under
graduate and graduate student input into the
selection process of the SJC's student chairper
son and allowing a student the option of plead
ing his or her case to the dean of student affairs
without first having to admit guilt.
The remaining issue, which the C-15 should
consider last, is a re-evaluation of the selection
process of student members of the SJC.
Whenever the C-15 does pass a proposal on
any issue, it should immediately present it to
the students for a vote, so that changes in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 can be
implemented as soon as possible.
Regardless of what changes are made at what
time, the administration has shown its aware
ness that there must be discussion on these
problems of the university judicial system. The
administration has apparently realized that the
charter is not a perfect and sacrosanct docu
ment, but rather one which should be changed
both in light of experience and of new cir
cumstances within the university.
