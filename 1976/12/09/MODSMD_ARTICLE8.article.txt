# Palo Alto massage rubout
## 
### 
Palo Alto has done it again. Not content with
the ongoing vital crusade against pinball ar
cades and comic book stores, the wise city
fathers dreamed up an innovative campaign
that would cost the taxpayers hundreds of
thousands of dollars, would tie up all the courts
in the county and would divert police from
protecting citizens against violent crime.
In a lightning pre-dawn raid, 70 of our local
Keystone kops seized the 17 massage parlors in
the city, took away everything they could (in
cluding ping-pong equipment, tropical fish
and magazines such as Fortune and San Fran
cisco), sealed the buildings and posted armed
guards. Now the city is safe.
The people are safe from the temptations of
sin. The people are safe from being free under
the law to make moral choices about their lives.
Of course, some may disagree. The Honest
Politician's Guide to Crime Control, for exam
ple, says:"The use of law enforcement re
sources (to combat prostitution), in a fruitless
effort to promote moral virtue, is wasteful and
socially injurious."
How have things come to such a pass that the
supposedly sophisticated college town of Palo
Alto now merits a prominent place in the Hum
bug and Comstockery Hall of Fame?
A major reason for the city government's pat
tern of "vice suppression" is continuing pres
sure from such Mrs. Grundys as the Palo Alto
Times and the puritanical Concerned Citizens
group — pressure to prosecute crimes without
victims. Crimes without victims have three
characteristics: (1) a willing exchange transac
tion for some proscribed good or service, (2) no
direct injury to third parties and (3) the lack of a
complaining victim to whom some injury was
done.
Our society would be freer and possibly bet

ter if victimless crime laws were repealed, and
police resources were instead concentrated on
violent crime.
In this particular case, officials made use of
vague nuisance laws under which things or
activities that some find indecent or offensive,
but that physically injure or threaten no one,
are outlawed. Such laws should be repealed or
overhauled.
Furthermore, in this case, officials utilized
some absurd laws on unfair competition. We
sometimes read about laws that artificially raise
prices on milk and liquor in the name of fair
competition. In the same class is the notion that
massage parlors should be punished merely
for offering more services than those they ad
vertise.
By using land-use laws and unfair business
practice laws, the city and county deprive the
massage parlor defendants of the safeguards
that are part of the ordinary criminal justice
system.
By saying that 17 of Palo Alto's massage par
lors are "no more than houses of prostitution,"
public officials are labeling all the employes
and customers of these establishments as pros
titutes and clients of prostitutes, when some in
fact may not be.
By collecting license-plate numbers and con
fiscating lists of credit-card users and bank re
cords, police are gathering information that can
easily be abused and used for harassment.
All in all. the entire episode is a sorry inci
dent in the life of an increasingly intolerant and
repressive city. Official spokesmen stress the
months of police work that went into this mass
seizure. We would look more favorably on
months of police work to solve murders, thefts
and assaults.

cades and comic book stores, the wise city
fathers dreamed up an innovative campaign
that would cost the taxpayers hundreds of
thousands of dollars, would tie up all the courts
in the county and would divert police from
protecting citizens against violent crime.
In a lightning pre-dawn raid, 70 of our local
Keystone kops seized the 17 massage parlors in
the city, took away everything they could (in
cluding ping-pong equipment, tropical fish
and magazines such as Fortune and San Fran
cisco), sealed the buildings and posted armed
guards. Now the city is safe.
The people are safe from the temptations of
sin. The people are safe from being free under
the law to make moral choices about their lives.
Of course, some may disagree. The Honest
Politician's Guide to Crime Control, for exam
ple, says:"The use of law enforcement re
sources (to combat prostitution), in a fruitless
effort to promote moral virtue, is wasteful and
socially injurious."
How have things come to such a pass that the
supposedly sophisticated college town of Palo
Alto now merits a prominent place in the Hum
bug and Comstockery Hall of Fame?
A major reason for the city government's pat
tern of "vice suppression" is continuing pres
sure from such Mrs. Grundys as the Palo Alto
Times and the puritanical Concerned Citizens
group — pressure to prosecute crimes without
victims. Crimes without victims have three
characteristics: (1) a willing exchange transac
tion for some proscribed good or service, (2) no
direct injury to third parties and (3) the lack of a
complaining victim to whom some injury was
done.
Our society would be freer and possibly bet

ter if victimless crime laws were repealed, and
police resources were instead concentrated on
violent crime.
In this particular case, officials made use of
vague nuisance laws under which things or
activities that some find indecent or offensive,
but that physically injure or threaten no one,
are outlawed. Such laws should be repealed or
overhauled.
Furthermore, in this case, officials utilized
some absurd laws on unfair competition. We
sometimes read about laws that artificially raise
prices on milk and liquor in the name of fair
competition. In the same class is the notion that
massage parlors should be punished merely
for offering more services than those they ad
vertise.
By using land-use laws and unfair business
practice laws, the city and county deprive the
massage parlor defendants of the safeguards
that are part of the ordinary criminal justice
system.
By saying that 17 of Palo Alto's massage par
lors are "no more than houses of prostitution,"
public officials are labeling all the employes
and customers of these establishments as pros
titutes and clients of prostitutes, when some in
fact may not be.
By collecting license-plate numbers and con
fiscating lists of credit-card users and bank re
cords, police are gathering information that can
easily be abused and used for harassment.
All in all. the entire episode is a sorry inci
dent in the life of an increasingly intolerant and
repressive city. Official spokesmen stress the
months of police work that went into this mass
seizure. We would look more favorably on
months of police work to solve murders, thefts
and assaults.
Palo Alto has done it again. Not content with
the ongoing vital crusade against pinball ar
cades and comic book stores, the wise city
fathers dreamed up an innovative campaign
that would cost the taxpayers hundreds of
thousands of dollars, would tie up all the courts
in the county and would divert police from
