Last Oct. 13, an attorney representing the
Stanford Daily in its lawsuit against Palo Alto
and Santa Clara County for an unconstitutional
1971 Palo Alto Police Department search of the
Daily's offices for evidence, argued before the
U.S. Court of Appeals that if police really
wanted to gather evidence, "a lawyer's office
would be a dandy place to get evidence."
Unbeknownst to him and to the Court of Ap
peals, just one day earlier some San Diego area
law enforcement officers did in fact search an
attorney's offices.
Those officers seized an alleged confession
letter of one of the attorney's clients, which was
sealed and placed in custody of the court.
The attorney's client is a woman who is
charged with three counts of murder. A letter,
in which she is alleged to have confessed, was
given to her attorney. Prosecutors attempted to
get a Superior Court judge to order that the
letter be turned over to them. When that didn't
work, prosecutors then went to a lower court
judge and finally secured a search warrant.
Since the search of the Daily's offices,
California police officers have also searched
alternative radio stations. Neither newspapers
nor radio stations have any statutory privilege
protecting them (except for a "shield" law on
sources, which state judges are adept at finding
ways to ignore). However, lawyers are pro
tected statutorily — but apparently police feel

that laws, not to mention constitutional guaran
tees, must bend to their own whims.
Actually, if police can seize a lawyer's file, we
fail to see how any person can be guaranteed
either effective counsel or a fair trial, as guaran
teed by the Sixth Amendment. If the govern
ment can read and hear anything a defendant
tells to his or her attorney, justice will cease to
exist in the country.
Perhaps the most terrifying aspect of this in
cident is that it is just one search in a long line
of illegal searches conducted by police in re
cent years. The Fourth Amendment — prohibit
ing unreasonable searches and seizures — has a
long and illustrious history. It is designed to
protect citizens from the tactics of a tyranny.
The sorry stories of 1930s fascism and the
Soviet Union are replete with police being al
lowed to search whomever and whatever they
want, whenever they want.
It was precisely this type of society which the
Fourth Amendment was designed to avert.
Unfortunately, more and more judges are giv
ing the Fourth Amendment mere lip service by
approving illegal search warrants.
It is time for the legislatures and the courts to
utilize whatever sanctions are necessary to re
mind law enforcement officers that this country
was founded on the notion that individuals
have certain inalienable rights.
