# Trustees approve tuition rate increase
## 
### Mike Charlson 
The Board of Trustees approved an
administration request for a 9.8 per
cent tuition jump for the 1977-78
academic year at their regular De
cember meeting as expected. The ac
tion will result in a $4695 regular tui
tion bill for students next fall.
The board also approved the ad
ministration's requested hikes in room
and board fees. The approved figure of
$1970 represents a seven per cent in
crease over the $1841 assessment this
year.
The combined tuition and room and
board figures will be $6665 next fall, a
nine per cent jump overall.
The meeting was held at the board
offices in San Francisco on Dec. 14.
According to Raymond Bacchetti,
vice provost for budget and planning,
three main factors entered into the
final fee recommendations:
—establishing a "rate consistent
with the university's financial needs";
—setting a cost which does not make
Stanford inaccessible to qualified
applicants; and
—remaining competitive with tui
tion rate charges at comparable institu
tions.
Balancing the budget
The 9.8 per cent figure is the result,
in part, of the university's Budget
Equilibrium Program (BEP). Under the
plan, instituted to eliminate the pe
rennial deficit in the operating budget,
the tuition rate each year must repre
sent some real growth in income for
the budget — income increases above
the.rate of inflation. Such increases,
coupled with cutbacks in expenditure,
will result in a balanced budget, BEP
planners hope.
The administration predicted in
early 1976 an annual tuition increase
of some 12.2 per cent. This announce
ment was made assuming an eight per
cent inflation rate, with 4.2 per cent of
the increase considered real growth
and directed toward achieving BEP
aims.
However, economists here projected
only a six per cent cost-of-living jump
for the coming year. In addition, after
examining other factors such as the
rates likely to be charged at other in
stitutions, the growth factor was low
ered to 3.8 per cent. Thus, a total in
crease of 9.8 per cent was suggested to
the board.
Financial aid increase
Financial Aids Director Robert Huff
emphasized that the university will
continue to meet all demonstrated
need of students. Financial aids cur
rently total about $12 million annu
ally, and awards are likely to increase
substantially next year, according to a
report submitted to the trustees as
background.
Unless growth in real income of stu
dents' parents is far above national av
erages, the report said, "the tuition in
crease recommended would exceed
the growth in personal income, with
the likely effect that more families
would qualify for financial assistance.
Huff said, though, that for students
whose parents earn between $25,000
and $35,000 per year, attendance here
would be very difficult from a finan
cial aspect.
On the margin
"We continue to be very concerned
about the students who are at the mar
gin level of financial need," he com

mented. Huff said that the university
would give as much aid as possible,
however.
This year, for the first time, room
and board figures were set simultane
ously with tuition figures. Adminis
trators want to emphasize comparison
of overall costs rather than comparison
just of tuition costs, according to Bac
chetti.
Bacchetti said that examining both
room and board costs and tuition "puts
student budget increases in their
proper perspective." Looking at either
one without the other "simply isn't,
fair," he added.
Smaller jump next year?
Bacchetti did have some encourag
ing news for students. Though he
could not speculate on figures, he said
that it was unlikely that next December
will see another nine per cent jump in
costs. Assuming inflation rates do not
increase, costs will rise by smaller
amounts in the future, he said.
Despite large fee increases over the
past few years, attracting qualified
applicants has not been difficult. Bac
chetti reported that the number of ap
plications for admission has increased
every year for the past five, hitting an
all-time high of over 10,000 applicants
for the Class of 1980.
Bacchetti said his office carefully
studies figures such as return enroll
ment percentages and other data to
evaluate the university's ability to at
tract and keep high quality students.
Applicant rate the same
Bacchetti said that figures collected
over a number of years indicate stu
dents still apply, enroll and return at a
rate relatively consistent with the past.
"Stanford is still able, even at the
price it charges, to attract the caliber of
students who best suit the caliber of
the institution," Bacchetti said.
Fees here are likely to be in line with
comparable institutions across the
country, according to Bacchetti.
Third highest tuition
Tuition here was the third highest in
the nation, a rank which will likely be
retained next year despite the fact that
the fee increase here is expected to be
higher than at other schools.
Lower room and board charges here
result in Stanford's seventh-place
ranking in overall costs (room and
board and tuition) of the 12 institu
tions compared in the administration
study.
Other schools on the list include
Harvard, Yale, MIT, Brown,
Dartmouth, Princeton, Cornell,
Northwestern, Pomona, Cal Tech and
use.
Other colleges' costs
This year, overall costs here were
$6116 compared with the top assess
ment of $6520 at Harvard. The least
expensive of the dozen was USC where
costs totalled only $5362.
For purposes of comparison, plan
ners increased costs at the other 11 in
stitutions by eight per cent, a figure
which Bacchetti described as very
"reasonable" based on information
gathered from the institutions in
volved. Assuming the projections hold
true, even with the nine per cent over
all increase here, the ranking of the 12
schools would not change.
Most comparable institutions do not
announce new tuition rates until a few
months from now. Traditionally, Stan
ford is the first private institution in
the country to set fees for the coming
year.

—establishing a "rate consistent
with the university's financial needs";
—setting a cost which does not make
Stanford inaccessible to qualified
applicants; and
—remaining competitive with tui
tion rate charges at comparable institu
tions.
Balancing the budget
The 9.8 per cent figure is the result,
in part, of the university's Budget
Equilibrium Program (BEP). Under the
plan, instituted to eliminate the pe
rennial deficit in the operating budget,
the tuition rate each year must repre
sent some real growth in income for
the budget — income increases above
the.rate of inflation. Such increases,
coupled with cutbacks in expenditure,
will result in a balanced budget, BEP
planners hope.
The administration predicted in
early 1976 an annual tuition increase
of some 12.2 per cent. This announce
ment was made assuming an eight per
cent inflation rate, with 4.2 per cent of
the increase considered real growth
and directed toward achieving BEP
aims.
However, economists here projected
only a six per cent cost-of-living jump
for the coming year. In addition, after
examining other factors such as the
rates likely to be charged at other in
stitutions, the growth factor was low
ered to 3.8 per cent. Thus, a total in
crease of 9.8 per cent was suggested to
the board.
Financial aid increase
Financial Aids Director Robert Huff
emphasized that the university will
continue to meet all demonstrated
need of students. Financial aids cur
rently total about $12 million annu
ally, and awards are likely to increase
substantially next year, according to a
report submitted to the trustees as
background.
Unless growth in real income of stu
dents' parents is far above national av
erages, the report said, "the tuition in
crease recommended would exceed
the growth in personal income, with
the likely effect that more families
would qualify for financial assistance.
Huff said, though, that for students
whose parents earn between $25,000
and $35,000 per year, attendance here
would be very difficult from a finan
cial aspect.
On the margin
"We continue to be very concerned
about the students who are at the mar
gin level of financial need," he com

mented. Huff said that the university
would give as much aid as possible,
however.
This year, for the first time, room
and board figures were set simultane
ously with tuition figures. Adminis
trators want to emphasize comparison
of overall costs rather than comparison
just of tuition costs, according to Bac
chetti.
Bacchetti said that examining both
room and board costs and tuition "puts
student budget increases in their
proper perspective." Looking at either
one without the other "simply isn't,
fair," he added.
Smaller jump next year?
Bacchetti did have some encourag
ing news for students. Though he
could not speculate on figures, he said
that it was unlikely that next December
will see another nine per cent jump in
costs. Assuming inflation rates do not
increase, costs will rise by smaller
amounts in the future, he said.
Despite large fee increases over the
past few years, attracting qualified
applicants has not been difficult. Bac
chetti reported that the number of ap
plications for admission has increased
every year for the past five, hitting an
all-time high of over 10,000 applicants
for the Class of 1980.
Bacchetti said his office carefully
studies figures such as return enroll
ment percentages and other data to
evaluate the university's ability to at
tract and keep high quality students.
Applicant rate the same
Bacchetti said that figures collected
over a number of years indicate stu
dents still apply, enroll and return at a
rate relatively consistent with the past.
"Stanford is still able, even at the
price it charges, to attract the caliber of
students who best suit the caliber of
the institution," Bacchetti said.
Fees here are likely to be in line with
comparable institutions across the
country, according to Bacchetti.
Third highest tuition
Tuition here was the third highest in
the nation, a rank which will likely be
retained next year despite the fact that
the fee increase here is expected to be
higher than at other schools.
Lower room and board charges here
result in Stanford's seventh-place
ranking in overall costs (room and
board and tuition) of the 12 institu
tions compared in the administration
study.
Other schools on the list include
Harvard, Yale, MIT, Brown,
Dartmouth, Princeton, Cornell,
Northwestern, Pomona, Cal Tech and
use.
Other colleges' costs
This year, overall costs here were
$6116 compared with the top assess
ment of $6520 at Harvard. The least
expensive of the dozen was USC where
costs totalled only $5362.
For purposes of comparison, plan
ners increased costs at the other 11 in
stitutions by eight per cent, a figure
which Bacchetti described as very
"reasonable" based on information
gathered from the institutions in
volved. Assuming the projections hold
true, even with the nine per cent over
all increase here, the ranking of the 12
schools would not change.
Most comparable institutions do not
announce new tuition rates until a few
months from now. Traditionally, Stan
ford is the first private institution in
the country to set fees for the coming
year.
The Board of Trustees approved an
administration request for a 9.8 per
cent tuition jump for the 1977-78
academic year at their regular De
cember meeting as expected. The ac
tion will result in a $4695 regular tui
tion bill for students next fall.
The board also approved the ad
ministration's requested hikes in room
and board fees. The approved figure of
$1970 represents a seven per cent in
crease over the $1841 assessment this
year.
The combined tuition and room and
board figures will be $6665 next fall, a
nine per cent jump overall.
The meeting was held at the board
offices in San Francisco on Dec. 14.
According to Raymond Bacchetti,
vice provost for budget and planning,
three main factors entered into the
final fee recommendations:
—establishing a "rate consistent

cent inflation rate, with 4.2 per cent of
the increase considered real growth
and directed toward achieving BEP
aims.
However, economists here projected
only a six per cent cost-of-living jump
for the coming year. In addition, after
examining other factors such as the
rates likely to be charged at other in
stitutions, the growth factor was low
ered to 3.8 per cent. Thus, a total in
crease of 9.8 per cent was suggested to
the board.
Financial aid increase
Financial Aids Director Robert Huff
emphasized that the university will
continue to meet all demonstrated
need of students. Financial aids cur
rently total about $12 million annu
ally, and awards are likely to increase
substantially next year, according to a
report submitted to the trustees as
background.
Unless growth in real income of stu
dents' parents is far above national av
erages, the report said, "the tuition in
crease recommended would exceed
the growth in personal income, with
the likely effect that more families
would qualify for financial assistance.
Huff said, though, that for students
whose parents earn between $25,000
and $35,000 per year, attendance here
would be very difficult from a finan
cial aspect.
On the margin
"We continue to be very concerned
about the students who are at the mar
gin level of financial need," he com

mented. Huff said that the university
would give as much aid as possible,
however.
This year, for the first time, room
and board figures were set simultane
ously with tuition figures. Adminis
trators want to emphasize comparison
of overall costs rather than comparison
just of tuition costs, according to Bac
chetti.
Bacchetti said that examining both
room and board costs and tuition "puts
student budget increases in their
proper perspective." Looking at either
one without the other "simply isn't,
fair," he added.
Smaller jump next year?
Bacchetti did have some encourag
ing news for students. Though he
could not speculate on figures, he said
that it was unlikely that next December
will see another nine per cent jump in
costs. Assuming inflation rates do not
increase, costs will rise by smaller
amounts in the future, he said.
Despite large fee increases over the
past few years, attracting qualified
applicants has not been difficult. Bac
chetti reported that the number of ap
plications for admission has increased
every year for the past five, hitting an
all-time high of over 10,000 applicants
for the Class of 1980.
Bacchetti said his office carefully
studies figures such as return enroll
ment percentages and other data to
evaluate the university's ability to at
tract and keep high quality students.
Applicant rate the same
Bacchetti said that figures collected
over a number of years indicate stu
dents still apply, enroll and return at a
rate relatively consistent with the past.
"Stanford is still able, even at the
price it charges, to attract the caliber of
students who best suit the caliber of
the institution," Bacchetti said.
Fees here are likely to be in line with
comparable institutions across the
country, according to Bacchetti.
Third highest tuition
Tuition here was the third highest in
the nation, a rank which will likely be
retained next year despite the fact that
the fee increase here is expected to be
higher than at other schools.
Lower room and board charges here
result in Stanford's seventh-place
ranking in overall costs (room and
board and tuition) of the 12 institu
tions compared in the administration
study.
Other schools on the list include
Harvard, Yale, MIT, Brown,
Dartmouth, Princeton, Cornell,
Northwestern, Pomona, Cal Tech and
use.
Other colleges' costs
This year, overall costs here were
$6116 compared with the top assess
ment of $6520 at Harvard. The least
expensive of the dozen was USC where
costs totalled only $5362.
For purposes of comparison, plan
ners increased costs at the other 11 in
stitutions by eight per cent, a figure
which Bacchetti described as very
"reasonable" based on information
gathered from the institutions in
volved. Assuming the projections hold
true, even with the nine per cent over
all increase here, the ranking of the 12
schools would not change.
Most comparable institutions do not
announce new tuition rates until a few
months from now. Traditionally, Stan
ford is the first private institution in
the country to set fees for the coming
year.
The Board of Trustees approved an
administration request for a 9.8 per
cent tuition jump for the 1977-78
academic year at their regular De
cember meeting as expected. The ac
tion will result in a $4695 regular tui
tion bill for students next fall.
The board also approved the ad
ministration's requested hikes in room
and board fees. The approved figure of
$1970 represents a seven per cent in
crease over the $1841 assessment this
year.
The combined tuition and room and
board figures will be $6665 next fall, a
nine per cent jump overall.
The meeting was held at the board
offices in San Francisco on Dec. 14.
According to Raymond Bacchetti,
vice provost for budget and planning,
three main factors entered into the
final fee recommendations:
—establishing a "rate consistent
with the university's financial needs";
—setting a cost which does not make
Stanford inaccessible to qualified
applicants; and
—remaining competitive with tui
tion rate charges at comparable institu
tions.
Balancing the budget
The 9.8 per cent figure is the result,
in part, of the university's Budget
Equilibrium Program (BEP). Under the
plan, instituted to eliminate the pe
rennial deficit in the operating budget,
the tuition rate each year must repre
sent some real growth in income for
the budget — income increases above
the.rate of inflation. Such increases,
coupled with cutbacks in expenditure,
will result in a balanced budget, BEP
planners hope.
The administration predicted in
early 1976 an annual tuition increase
of some 12.2 per cent. This announce
ment was made assuming an eight per
cent inflation rate, with 4.2 per cent of
the increase considered real growth
and directed toward achieving BEP
aims.
However, economists here projected
only a six per cent cost-of-living jump
for the coming year. In addition, after
examining other factors such as the
rates likely to be charged at other in
