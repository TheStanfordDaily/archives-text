# End state subsidy for public colleges
## 
### 
It is a bit of historical trivia that Pat
ricia Hearst, prior to her abduction by
the Symbionese Liberation Army, was
an art student at UC-Berkeley. What is
not so trivial is that Hearst, along with
over a million other Californians in
1974, received state-subsidized post
secondary education which they
earned not by financial need but by
choice alone.
This year, the state will spend over
one and one-half billion dollars in di
rect subsidy to the University of
California, the California State Univer
sity and Colleges and community col
lege districts throughout the state.
Even when aid to community colleges,
which receive only 42 per cent of their
funding from the state, is included,
each student in the three systems is

receiving over $1000 from the state's
general fund.
No attempt
But there is no reason to believe that
a majority of the students receiving
this implicit scholarship cannot afford
to pay the full cost of their education.
Indeed, the state makes no attempt to
differentiate in its subsidy between
students coming from poor families
and scions of families like the Hearsfs,
who can well afford to send their chil
dren wherever they wish to go.

The result is that there is less mondy
available to the state Student Aid
Commission (formerly called the State
Scholarship and Loan Cbmmission)
for grants on the basis of financial
need. This, in turn, helps perpetuate
the underrepresentation of poor
families and minorities in public col
leges. By giving something to
everyone, those who need it get less.
Scraping by
It is true that the commission, with
its $55 million in undergraduate scho
larship and College Opportunity Crant
money, can afford to give the poorest
students enough in grants, loans and
work-study to enable them td scrape by
at the University of California and
high-cost private institutions. But if
the purpose of the state funds is to pro
vide equal educational opportunity,
that goal is not attained when students
from the poorest high schools with the
least adequate preparation have addi
tional burdens placed on them in col
lege.
In addition, the lack of scholarship
money distorts the educational picture
for middle-income families who are
forced to opt for the institution receiv
ing the state subsidy because the

maximum grant level of $2700 per year
is not high enough to make private col
leges affordable. Even though the pub
lic school may be less efficient and the
per-student cost of education higher,
the subsidy puts it at a competitive
advantage which only the very poor
and very rich can overcome.
Thus, while private colleges tighten
their belts to avoid pricing themselves
out of the educational market,
bureaucrats at the state institutions
have only to fear the end of the baby
boom and a leveling-off of enroll
ments.
Rationale
The rationale for public colleges is
the same as for public primary and
secondary schools: the public as a
whole has an active interest in an edu
cated populace and should share the
cost of creating one. But the state has
gone beyond this and defined educa
tion as a "public good," one which,
like national defense or unpolluted air,
can only be provided and consumed
collectively.
Education, however, is not a "public
good." It is a service to individuals
which can be provided or denied at
will, and which can be done privately
just as easily as publicly. By giving its
own institutions enough money to ap
pear inexpensive relative to private in
stitutions, the state has placed its
thumb on a scale which operates quite
nicely in a balanced position.
Externalities
The education of the state's youth
does have enough positive exter
nalities for the rest of the public to
warrant large expenditures by the state
with the aim of providing equal oppor
tunity. The way to provide this oppor
tunity, however, is to remove the sub
sidyfrom public colleges and placethe
unused money in the hands of the Stu
dent Aid Commission for grants and
loans on the basis of financial need.
At the University of California and
the state university and colleges, the
amount of the state's subsidy per stu
dent is computed each year in deter
mining the proper tuition for non-
Californians attending those colleges.

Thus, students could be charged some
thing resembling the cost of their edu
cation by raising all tuition to this
level. Community colleges, because of
extensive local and federal funding,
pose a trickier problem, but one which
could be overcome as far as state funds
are concerned.
In the end, scholarships and grants
to be used at both public and private
institutions would increase tremend
ously, and the maximum income level
of eligibility fot state aid would go up
far enough to include most middle
income families. Decisions would
then be made not on the relative ex
pense of different institutions (since
the average cost of education is almost
the same at public and private schools)
but on the relative quality of educa
tion. Public institutions would have to
provide the same or better quality per
dollar or perish.
Another advantage
Making the change to financial need
aid may have another advantage in
lowering the number of young people
attending college. It is becoming clear
that colleges are not for everyone, but
upper-middle and high income
families continue to send their chil
dren to public colleges, usually com
munity colleges or state universities,
because they feel the student is not yet
ready for the working world and the
college offers an attractive "holding
pattern" for two or three years.
The result has been that money
which could be used to aid ambitious
poor or lower-middle income students
has gone instead to the general sub
sidy. In addition, the presence of large
numbers of apathetic students in those
institutions has helped lower the level
of instruction and thus the benefit for
interested students. If the rich want a
"holding pattern," they should pay the
cost rather than burden the rest.
Poor and middle-income students as
well as the public would be better
served by ending the present across
the-board state college subsidy.

Scholarship and Loan Cbmmission)
for grants on the basis of financial
need. This, in turn, helps perpetuate
the underrepresentation of poor
families and minorities in public col
leges. By giving something to
everyone, those who need it get less.
Scraping by
It is true that the commission, with
its $55 million in undergraduate scho
larship and College Opportunity Crant
money, can afford to give the poorest
students enough in grants, loans and
work-study to enable them td scrape by
at the University of California and
high-cost private institutions. But if
the purpose of the state funds is to pro
vide equal educational opportunity,
that goal is not attained when students
from the poorest high schools with the
least adequate preparation have addi
tional burdens placed on them in col
lege.
In addition, the lack of scholarship
money distorts the educational picture
for middle-income families who are
forced to opt for the institution receiv
ing the state subsidy because the

maximum grant level of $2700 per year
is not high enough to make private col
leges affordable. Even though the pub
lic school may be less efficient and the
per-student cost of education higher,
the subsidy puts it at a competitive
advantage which only the very poor
and very rich can overcome.
Thus, while private colleges tighten
their belts to avoid pricing themselves
out of the educational market,
bureaucrats at the state institutions
have only to fear the end of the baby
boom and a leveling-off of enroll
ments.
Rationale
The rationale for public colleges is
the same as for public primary and
secondary schools: the public as a
whole has an active interest in an edu
cated populace and should share the
cost of creating one. But the state has
gone beyond this and defined educa
tion as a "public good," one which,
like national defense or unpolluted air,
can only be provided and consumed
collectively.
Education, however, is not a "public
good." It is a service to individuals
which can be provided or denied at
will, and which can be done privately
just as easily as publicly. By giving its
own institutions enough money to ap
pear inexpensive relative to private in
stitutions, the state has placed its
thumb on a scale which operates quite
nicely in a balanced position.
Externalities
The education of the state's youth
does have enough positive exter
nalities for the rest of the public to
warrant large expenditures by the state
with the aim of providing equal oppor
tunity. The way to provide this oppor
tunity, however, is to remove the sub
sidyfrom public colleges and placethe
unused money in the hands of the Stu
dent Aid Commission for grants and
loans on the basis of financial need.
At the University of California and
the state university and colleges, the
amount of the state's subsidy per stu
dent is computed each year in deter
mining the proper tuition for non-
Californians attending those colleges.

Thus, students could be charged some
thing resembling the cost of their edu
cation by raising all tuition to this
level. Community colleges, because of
extensive local and federal funding,
pose a trickier problem, but one which
could be overcome as far as state funds
are concerned.
In the end, scholarships and grants
to be used at both public and private
institutions would increase tremend
ously, and the maximum income level
of eligibility fot state aid would go up
far enough to include most middle
income families. Decisions would
then be made not on the relative ex
pense of different institutions (since
the average cost of education is almost
the same at public and private schools)
but on the relative quality of educa
tion. Public institutions would have to
provide the same or better quality per
dollar or perish.
Another advantage
Making the change to financial need
aid may have another advantage in
lowering the number of young people
attending college. It is becoming clear
that colleges are not for everyone, but
upper-middle and high income
families continue to send their chil
dren to public colleges, usually com
munity colleges or state universities,
because they feel the student is not yet
ready for the working world and the
college offers an attractive "holding
pattern" for two or three years.
The result has been that money
which could be used to aid ambitious
poor or lower-middle income students
has gone instead to the general sub
sidy. In addition, the presence of large
numbers of apathetic students in those
institutions has helped lower the level
of instruction and thus the benefit for
interested students. If the rich want a
"holding pattern," they should pay the
cost rather than burden the rest.
Poor and middle-income students as
well as the public would be better
served by ending the present across
the-board state college subsidy.

It is a bit of historical trivia that Pat
ricia Hearst, prior to her abduction by
the Symbionese Liberation Army, was
an art student at UC-Berkeley. What is
not so trivial is that Hearst, along with
over a million other Californians in
1974, received state-subsidized post
secondary education which they
earned not by financial need but by
choice alone.
This year, the state will spend over
one and one-half billion dollars in di
rect subsidy to the University of
California, the California State Univer
sity and Colleges and community col
lege districts throughout the state.
Even when aid to community colleges,
which receive only 42 per cent of their

each student in the three systems is

receiving over $1000 from the state's
general fund.

But there is no reason to believe that
a majority of the students receiving

Indeed, the state makes no attempt to

their belts to avoid pricing themselves
out of the educational market,
bureaucrats at the state institutions
have only to fear the end of the baby
boom and a leveling-off of enroll
ments.
Rationale
The rationale for public colleges is
the same as for public primary and
secondary schools: the public as a
whole has an active interest in an edu
cated populace and should share the
cost of creating one. But the state has
gone beyond this and defined educa
tion as a "public good," one which,
like national defense or unpolluted air,
can only be provided and consumed
collectively.
Education, however, is not a "public
good." It is a service to individuals
which can be provided or denied at
will, and which can be done privately
just as easily as publicly. By giving its
own institutions enough money to ap
pear inexpensive relative to private in
stitutions, the state has placed its
thumb on a scale which operates quite
nicely in a balanced position.
Externalities
The education of the state's youth
does have enough positive exter
nalities for the rest of the public to
warrant large expenditures by the state
with the aim of providing equal oppor
tunity. The way to provide this oppor
tunity, however, is to remove the sub
sidyfrom public colleges and placethe
unused money in the hands of the Stu
dent Aid Commission for grants and
loans on the basis of financial need.
At the University of California and
the state university and colleges, the
amount of the state's subsidy per stu
dent is computed each year in deter
mining the proper tuition for non-
Californians attending those colleges.

Thus, students could be charged some
thing resembling the cost of their edu
cation by raising all tuition to this
level. Community colleges, because of
extensive local and federal funding,
pose a trickier problem, but one which
could be overcome as far as state funds
are concerned.
In the end, scholarships and grants
to be used at both public and private
institutions would increase tremend
ously, and the maximum income level
of eligibility fot state aid would go up
far enough to include most middle
income families. Decisions would
then be made not on the relative ex
pense of different institutions (since
the average cost of education is almost
the same at public and private schools)
but on the relative quality of educa
tion. Public institutions would have to
provide the same or better quality per
dollar or perish.
Another advantage
Making the change to financial need
aid may have another advantage in
lowering the number of young people
attending college. It is becoming clear
that colleges are not for everyone, but
upper-middle and high income
families continue to send their chil
dren to public colleges, usually com
munity colleges or state universities,
because they feel the student is not yet
ready for the working world and the
college offers an attractive "holding
pattern" for two or three years.
The result has been that money
which could be used to aid ambitious
poor or lower-middle income students
has gone instead to the general sub
sidy. In addition, the presence of large
numbers of apathetic students in those
institutions has helped lower the level
of instruction and thus the benefit for
interested students. If the rich want a
"holding pattern," they should pay the
cost rather than burden the rest.
Poor and middle-income students as
well as the public would be better
served by ending the present across
the-board state college subsidy.

It is a bit of historical trivia that Pat
ricia Hearst, prior to her abduction by
the Symbionese Liberation Army, was
an art student at UC-Berkeley. What is
not so trivial is that Hearst, along with
over a million other Californians in
1974, received state-subsidized post
secondary education which they
earned not by financial need but by
choice alone.
This year, the state will spend over
one and one-half billion dollars in di
rect subsidy to the University of
California, the California State Univer
sity and Colleges and community col
lege districts throughout the state.
Even when aid to community colleges,
which receive only 42 per cent of their
funding from the state, is included,
each student in the three systems is

receiving over $1000 from the state's
general fund.
No attempt
But there is no reason to believe that
a majority of the students receiving
this implicit scholarship cannot afford
to pay the full cost of their education.
Indeed, the state makes no attempt to
differentiate in its subsidy between
students coming from poor families
and scions of families like the Hearsfs,
who can well afford to send their chil
dren wherever they wish to go.

The result is that there is less mondy
available to the state Student Aid
Commission (formerly called the State
Scholarship and Loan Cbmmission)
for grants on the basis of financial
need. This, in turn, helps perpetuate
the underrepresentation of poor
families and minorities in public col
leges. By giving something to
everyone, those who need it get less.
Scraping by
It is true that the commission, with
its $55 million in undergraduate scho
larship and College Opportunity Crant
money, can afford to give the poorest
students enough in grants, loans and
work-study to enable them td scrape by
at the University of California and
high-cost private institutions. But if
the purpose of the state funds is to pro
vide equal educational opportunity,
that goal is not attained when students
from the poorest high schools with the
least adequate preparation have addi
tional burdens placed on them in col
lege.
In addition, the lack of scholarship
money distorts the educational picture
for middle-income families who are
forced to opt for the institution receiv
ing the state subsidy because the

maximum grant level of $2700 per year
is not high enough to make private col
leges affordable. Even though the pub
lic school may be less efficient and the
per-student cost of education higher,
the subsidy puts it at a competitive
advantage which only the very poor
and very rich can overcome.
Thus, while private colleges tighten
their belts to avoid pricing themselves
out of the educational market,
bureaucrats at the state institutions
have only to fear the end of the baby
boom and a leveling-off of enroll
ments.
