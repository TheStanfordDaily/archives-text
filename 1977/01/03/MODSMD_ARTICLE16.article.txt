Tuition Rates for 1977-78
The general tuition rate for the academic year 1977-78
that will be recommended to the Board of Trustees is $4,695
($1,565 per regular quarter). Further, tuition recommenda
tions will include tuition rates for M.D. candidates in the
School of Medicine at $4,932 ($1,644 per regular quarter);
and for the Graduate School of Business at $4,969 ($1,565
per regular quarter); and for the School of Law at $4,846
($2,423 per semester) for the academic year 1977-78.
A comparison of the 1977-78 tuition recommendations is
as follows:
From To %
Type 1976-77 1977-78 Increase Increase
General Tuition $4,275 $4,695 $420 9.8
School of Medicine
(M.D. Program) $4,470 $4,932 $462 10.3
Graduate School
of Business $4,350 $4,695 $345 7.9
School of Law $4,426 $4,846 $420 9.5
While several factors have been taken into consideration
in determining the recommendation for the general tuition,
the overall objective has been to establish a general tuition
rate consistent with the University's financial needs and
which, when offset by financial aid for those with demons
trated need, does not make Stanford economically inaccessi
ble to qualified applicants.
Economic and Equilibrium Considerations
Since the beginning of the Budget Equilibrium Program,
Stanford has used an economic model to identify and track
over time the relationships between income and expense
components in the Operating Budget. Through the use of this
analytical tool, which is capable of handling complex and
interactive relationships, conditions necessary to move the
budget toward financial equilibrium can be identified. One of
the assumptions of The Budget Equilibrium Program is a
tuition growth rate of 4.2% above the rate of inflation. Each
year during the past three, we have established, as a point of
departure, a tuition rate based on this assumption. We have
then checked, to the best of our ability, the effect of that
rate on the Operating Budget, its relation to projected tuition
rates at other institutions, and the admissions, financial aid,
and enrollment experience and issues relating to our ability
to attract and enroll a high quality student population. When
the results of these examinations show cause for concern,
those results influence the recommended tuition rate. This
year, for the first time since the Budget Equilibrium Program
started, we recommend a tuition rate below the equilibrium
assumption, though only slightly below. The expenditure
needs, particularly the great strain placed on the budget by
energy costs, in our judgment preclude the sharper downward
adjustment that might be desirable on other grounds. Our
reasons for making the adjustment to a recommendation
3.8% above inflation have to do with the economic environ
ment and the relationship of Stanford's tuition to that of
other major private universities.
In respect to predictions of economic factors in 1977-78,
we have consulted with economists at Stanford and elsewhere
and examined the published evidence and speculations re
garding inflation and personal income growth rates. Estimates
of the consumer price index appear to vary from under 5% to
over 6%, with a central tendency between those two figures.
For budget planning purposes, we will use 6%. Increases in
personal income range from zero to 3.5% in real (i.e., above
the CPI) terms for the nation overall. We do not know what
the personal income expectations are on the average for
Stanford parents, though we doubt that they would be less
than the national figures. Unless they are above average by a
fair degrep, the tuition increase recommended would exceed
the growth in personal income, with the likely effect that
more families would qualify for financial assistance.

Before turning to charges at other universities, a look
should be taken at the other factors which affect tuition
income, the autumn quarter enrollment and the returning
student enrollment in winter and spring quarters (expressed
as a percentage of autumn enrollment and called The Re
turning Enrollment Ratio). Historical and current values for
each of these factors are shown in the accompanying table:
(see charts below left)
These figures have remained stable over the period shown.
The increase marked with an asterisk!*) can be traced to the
enrollment of fourth year graduate students who would
formerly have been terminal graduate students (TGR) and
who now, as a result of a new policy, must register as
advanced graduate students (AGR), thus entering the statis
tics of those enrolling for units of academic credit.
Tuition Rates at Other Institutions
The second reason for adjusting the tuition rate to a lower
level than the equilibrium assumption has to do with the
project relationship of the resulting general rate and room
and board expenses to those at other major private univer
sities in 1977-78. In the following chart, Stanford's figures
are the general increases being recommended here. For the
other institutions, 1976-77 actual figures are increased uni
formly by 8% to provide a basis for comparison. (These
institutions have not set rates for 1977-78.)
(see chart below right)
Tuition, Room, and Board
Comparisons of Actual and Projected Rates
Based on these combined costs for tuition, room, and
board, several leading private institutions probably will be
more expensive than Stanford, including universities which in
the past have been highly attractive to students admitted to
Stanford and enrolling elsewhere. In 1976-77, for example,
42% of the 987 individuals who declined Stanford's offer of
admission enrolled at one of the six institutions shown as
more expensive on the above table.
Admissions and Financial Aid Considerations
In addition to evaluating the effects of the proposed
tuition rate in the light of economic and equilibrium condi
tions and tuition elsewhere, we also examine the rate against
admissions and financial aid objectives to insure, insofar as
we can, that the rate will not be a systematic barrier to
attracting and enrolling an able and qualified student body.
To check for evidence as to whether this objective is being
met, we monitor the enrollment statistics of the freshman
class each year.
The admissions process and the financial aid policies of
the University serve two separate and distinct purposes. The
objective of the admissions process is to admit the most able
and qualified students. The decisions which actualize this
objective are made without regard to the financial circum
stances of the student or his or her family. Once a student
has been admitted, the financial aid policy has as its objective
the reduction of economic barriers for the student with
financial need. By applying this policy and meeting all
demonstrated financial need, the University makes possible
initial access and continued enrollment thereafter.
The undergraduate financial aid expenditures will total
approximately $12,000,000 in 1976-77. Of that total, ap
proximately $9,000,000 will consist of scholarships and
grants. The remainder will come from jobs held during the
academic quarter and from subsidized loans. As the tuition
rate increases, so also does student need. In meeting this need
annually, scholarship and grant fund increases are built into
the Operating Budget and self-help expectations are re
examined to see if they can reasonably be increased in the
light of inflation, increasing hourly wages on campus, and
practices elsewhere.
(Graduate student aid expenditures from all sources were
approximately $19,000,000 in 1975-76. (Final figures for
1975-76 are not yet available.) Incremental funds will be
provided in the operating and other budgets for teaching and
research assistantship increases and fellowship increases, and

the graduate financial aid program will be overseen by the
dean of graduate studies who, in cooperation with the deans
of schools and the director of financial aids, coordinates and
manages graduate financial aid resources.)
In looking at the results from this year's study of the
incoming freshman class and the applicant pool from which it
comes, we notice areas where the data have diverged from
established patterns and other areas where the data follow
trends established in prior years. The data collected on the
class of 1980 appear to follow established lines or show shifts
which are not statistically significant in the following cate
gories:
* the number of applications received;
* the percentage of students admitted;
* the percentage of students enrolled;
* the percentage of students who declined enrollment;
* the enrollment rates in various academic rating cate
gories.
While there has been a slight decline over the 1975-76
percentage, the number of admitted students choosing to
attend another private institution has remained within a
familiar range.

Public Institutions 24 26 23 18 20 24
Percent Choosing
Private Institutions 76 74 77 82 80 76
Moreover, the schools selected by the largest number of
students choosing private institutions continued to be
Harvard/Radcliffe, Vale, and Princeton. The University of
California continued to attract the majority of the non
enrollers who chose public institutions, with Berkeley the
leading campus in that regard.
The research relating enrollment choices (yield rates) and
various economic measures, primarily calculated family con
tributions and family income, shows great variability and no
consistent patterns. In some parental contribution categories,
we notice lower yield rates (e.g., $2,000-4,000) but we are
puzzled by inconsistencies (e.g., the next highest category, of
$4,000-6,000 which is more nearly what is meant by refer
ences to "middle income" groups, does not show a similar
effect).
So far as we can tell, the data overall reveal no systematic
weaknesses in Stanford's ability to attract students from
across the economic spectrum. The results that we have are
more interesting than alarming in the divergences from
expectations that they do reveal. A report of the research
which has been conducted will be available on request from
this office in January.
Room and Board Rates for 1977-78
The basic room and board rate for the academic year
1977-78 that will be recommended to the Board of Trustees
will be $1,970, and rates for specific units will be set within
the pattern of the basic rate, which amounts to an increase of
7.0%.
Room rates for the current year vary from $591 (plus
utilities) in the fraternity cluster houses to $755 in residences
with full services. Rates for full board for the current year are
$1,086. The breakdown between room and board rates for
1977-78 will be developed in preparation of the detailed
residence and dining hall budgets.
Escondido apartment rents will be increased an average of
9.0%. Current rents vary from $179 per month for a
one-bedroom apartment to $221 per month for a three-bed
room apartment. All apartments are furnished, and utilities
are provided.
The most significant influence on rates for 1977-78 is the
continuing rise in utility costs. This accounts for nearly half
of the increase in all residences.
As noted in the comparative table above, Harvard, MIT,
Yale, Brown, Dartmouth, Cornell, and Princeton have higher
1976-77 room and board rates, ranging from $1,875 to
$2,420.
