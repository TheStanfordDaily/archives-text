# Husband-wife teams share faculty appointments
## 
### Michael Molyneux 
At one time, a man and woman
could not teach in the same de
partment here it they were mar
ried to each other.
But now, a couple not only can
work in the same department,
but also can share an appoint
ment.
Such is the position of Renato
Rosaldo, associate professor of
anthropology, and Michelle
Rosaldo, assistant professor of
anthropology. Kach holds 3 A of a
full-time position, with propor
tional salary and teaching load.
The Rosaldos shifted to their
present arrangement, which is
unique here, in 1973. Renato was
then a full-time faculty member
and Michelle had half-time
status.
They are free to work out
teaching responsibilities among
themselves. Both said they ap
preciated the flexibility of their
employment, which helps pro
vide time to care for their young
son.
But a disadvantage of the situ
ation is that, as Michelle put it,

"We both feel we work more
than we're paid for." Although
their teaching duties are re
duced, the Rosaldos said they
assume a sizable share of advis
ing, committee work and other
faculty responsibilities.
Working full-time
The Rosaldos may each
shoulder, more than 3 A of a full
work load, admitted Benjamin
Paul, professor of anthropology
and former department chair
man. But. he maintained, "full
time faculty members work more
than a full-time person is ex
pected to."
Somewhat similar is the situa
tion of George Collier, associate
professor of anthropology, and
his wife, Jane Collier, assistant
professor of anthropology. His
position is full-time and hers,
half-time. But for his wife, (-oi
lier said, "there is a fairly natural
tendency to do more."
Solution
Despite the question of com
pensation, Renato Rosaldo said
he saw "real advantages for the
near future" in maintaining the

split arrangement.
He called it "an important in
stitutional solution in a world
where there are fewer and fewer
jobs available and husbands and
wives are looking for jobs in the
same place." He said he was
"appreciative of Stanford's
openness toward this."
Tenure
Deciding whether to grant te
nure does not present unusual
difficulties with husband and
wife teams, according to An
thropology Prof. Clifford Bar
nett. He said each spouse would
be considered individually at
the usual time and that Renato
was granted tenure last spring.
Provost William Miller said
the splitting of teaching posi
tions was not a formally estab
lished policy, but was an oppor
tunity the university might oc
casionally consider.
"The likelihood of having a
couple in which both would fit
into a particular program is
rather small," Miller noted.
The option of having husband
and wife split a single position,

now practiced at some univer
sities, has not been instituted
here, according to the Provost's
Office.
No official total is available of
the husband-wife combinations
employed as Stanford faculty. In
many cases, each is hired full
time. Among other couples
teaching in the same department
are Daryl and Sandra Bern in
psychology, Nannerl and Robert
Keohane in political science and
George and Louise Spindler in
anthropology.
Corporate partnership
Louise Spindler, one of the
first persons at the university to
teach in the same department as
her spouse, has been hired since
1966 in a "temporary renewable
one-year lectureship." Her hus
band, George, a full professor,
views-their situation as "an
operating corporate partnership,
two people doing a complex job,
including research, editing and
teaching."
The big one
George said he would prefer
"one big job and one big salary,"

but regretted the difficulty a
university has in creating such a
situation. Louise said that at
other universities, they might
have had "a joint appointment
that would have been better."
But because of her strong in
terest in research, she has not
tried for a position that would
require full-time teaching.
Husbands and wives had
taught much earlier in different
departments, even before 1925,
when Paul Earnsworth, profes
sor emeritus of psychology, ar
rived at the university with his
wife, who spent most of her
career in food research.
Earnsworth recalled that "it was
understood that a husband and
wife couldn't be in the same de
partment."
No anti-nepotism rule
Miller, however, maintained
that the university has never had
a formal "anti-nepotism rule"
forbidding the practice.
The prevailing customs influ
enced Nathan Maccoby's deci
sion in 1958 not to seek a dual
appointment in communication

and psychology. Maccoby, now
director of the Institute for
Communication Research, is
married to Eleanor Maccoby,
chairman of the psychology de
partment.
The university has not been
subject to rules like those which
once existed in several states,
forbidding spouses or other rela
tives from working at the same
university.
Such legislation was termed
discriminatory in 1972 by the
U.S. Department of Health, Edu
cation and Welfare. But com
munication researcher Matilda
Butler observed in a recent paper
that nationally, "the ghosts of
anti-nepotism function as effi
ciently as the rules themselves

once did."
Robert Sears, professor
emeritus of psychology, called
such laws "holdovers from the
depression, when there was an
effort to spread the work,
around."
Another aspect of the regula
tions was cited in a 1973 Time
article: "These rules were not
designed to bar husbands."
Sears, whose wife Pauline is
professor emeritus of education,
considered the university tradi
tionally open-minded about the
employment of spouses: "Com
pared to large state universities,
Stanford has tried to make ar
rangements that would ease the
situation. Stanford has a much
more personal administration."

pected to."
Somewhat similar is the situa
tion of George Collier, associate
professor of anthropology, and
his wife, Jane Collier, assistant
professor of anthropology. His
position is full-time and hers,
half-time. But for his wife, (-oi
lier said, "there is a fairly natural
tendency to do more."
Solution
Despite the question of com
pensation, Renato Rosaldo said
he saw "real advantages for the
near future" in maintaining the

split arrangement.
He called it "an important in
stitutional solution in a world
where there are fewer and fewer
jobs available and husbands and
wives are looking for jobs in the
same place." He said he was
"appreciative of Stanford's
openness toward this."
Tenure
Deciding whether to grant te
nure does not present unusual
difficulties with husband and
wife teams, according to An
thropology Prof. Clifford Bar
nett. He said each spouse would
be considered individually at
the usual time and that Renato
was granted tenure last spring.
Provost William Miller said
the splitting of teaching posi
tions was not a formally estab
lished policy, but was an oppor
tunity the university might oc
casionally consider.
"The likelihood of having a
couple in which both would fit
into a particular program is
rather small," Miller noted.
The option of having husband
and wife split a single position,

now practiced at some univer
sities, has not been instituted
here, according to the Provost's
Office.
No official total is available of
the husband-wife combinations
employed as Stanford faculty. In
many cases, each is hired full
time. Among other couples
teaching in the same department
are Daryl and Sandra Bern in
psychology, Nannerl and Robert
Keohane in political science and
George and Louise Spindler in
anthropology.
Corporate partnership
Louise Spindler, one of the
first persons at the university to
teach in the same department as
her spouse, has been hired since
1966 in a "temporary renewable
one-year lectureship." Her hus
band, George, a full professor,
views-their situation as "an
operating corporate partnership,
two people doing a complex job,
including research, editing and
teaching."
The big one
George said he would prefer
"one big job and one big salary,"

but regretted the difficulty a
university has in creating such a
situation. Louise said that at
other universities, they might
have had "a joint appointment
that would have been better."
But because of her strong in
terest in research, she has not
tried for a position that would
require full-time teaching.
Husbands and wives had
taught much earlier in different
departments, even before 1925,
when Paul Earnsworth, profes
sor emeritus of psychology, ar
rived at the university with his
wife, who spent most of her
career in food research.
Earnsworth recalled that "it was
understood that a husband and
wife couldn't be in the same de
partment."
No anti-nepotism rule
Miller, however, maintained
that the university has never had
a formal "anti-nepotism rule"
forbidding the practice.
The prevailing customs influ
enced Nathan Maccoby's deci
sion in 1958 not to seek a dual
appointment in communication

and psychology. Maccoby, now
director of the Institute for
Communication Research, is
married to Eleanor Maccoby,
chairman of the psychology de
partment.
The university has not been
subject to rules like those which
once existed in several states,
forbidding spouses or other rela
tives from working at the same
university.
Such legislation was termed
discriminatory in 1972 by the
U.S. Department of Health, Edu
cation and Welfare. But com
munication researcher Matilda
Butler observed in a recent paper
that nationally, "the ghosts of
anti-nepotism function as effi
ciently as the rules themselves

once did."
Robert Sears, professor
emeritus of psychology, called
such laws "holdovers from the
depression, when there was an
effort to spread the work,
around."
Another aspect of the regula
tions was cited in a 1973 Time
article: "These rules were not
designed to bar husbands."
Sears, whose wife Pauline is
professor emeritus of education,
considered the university tradi
tionally open-minded about the
employment of spouses: "Com
pared to large state universities,
Stanford has tried to make ar
rangements that would ease the
situation. Stanford has a much
more personal administration."
At one time, a man and woman
could not teach in the same de
partment here it they were mar
ried to each other.
But now, a couple not only can
work in the same department,
but also can share an appoint
ment.
Such is the position of Renato
Rosaldo, associate professor of
anthropology, and Michelle
Rosaldo, assistant professor of
anthropology. Kach holds 3 A of a
full-time position, with propor
tional salary and teaching load.
The Rosaldos shifted to their
present arrangement, which is
unique here, in 1973. Renato was
then a full-time faculty member
and Michelle had half-time
status.
They are free to work out
teaching responsibilities among
themselves. Both said they ap
preciated the flexibility of their
employment, which helps pro
vide time to care for their young
son.
But a disadvantage of the situ
ation is that, as Michelle put it,

"We both feel we work more
than we're paid for." Although
their teaching duties are re
duced, the Rosaldos said they
assume a sizable share of advis
ing, committee work and other
faculty responsibilities.
Working full-time
The Rosaldos may each
shoulder, more than 3 A of a full
work load, admitted Benjamin
Paul, professor of anthropology
and former department chair
man. But. he maintained, "full
time faculty members work more
than a full-time person is ex
pected to."
Somewhat similar is the situa
tion of George Collier, associate

here, according to the Provost's
Office.
No official total is available of
the husband-wife combinations
employed as Stanford faculty. In
many cases, each is hired full
time. Among other couples
teaching in the same department
are Daryl and Sandra Bern in
psychology, Nannerl and Robert
Keohane in political science and
George and Louise Spindler in
anthropology.
Corporate partnership
Louise Spindler, one of the
first persons at the university to
teach in the same department as
her spouse, has been hired since
1966 in a "temporary renewable
one-year lectureship." Her hus
band, George, a full professor,
views-their situation as "an
operating corporate partnership,
two people doing a complex job,
including research, editing and
teaching."
The big one
George said he would prefer
"one big job and one big salary,"

but regretted the difficulty a
university has in creating such a
situation. Louise said that at
other universities, they might
have had "a joint appointment
that would have been better."
But because of her strong in
terest in research, she has not
tried for a position that would
require full-time teaching.
Husbands and wives had
taught much earlier in different
departments, even before 1925,
when Paul Earnsworth, profes
sor emeritus of psychology, ar
rived at the university with his
wife, who spent most of her
career in food research.
Earnsworth recalled that "it was
understood that a husband and
wife couldn't be in the same de
partment."
No anti-nepotism rule
Miller, however, maintained
that the university has never had
a formal "anti-nepotism rule"
forbidding the practice.
The prevailing customs influ
enced Nathan Maccoby's deci
sion in 1958 not to seek a dual
appointment in communication

and psychology. Maccoby, now
director of the Institute for
Communication Research, is
married to Eleanor Maccoby,
chairman of the psychology de
partment.
The university has not been
subject to rules like those which
once existed in several states,
forbidding spouses or other rela
tives from working at the same
university.
Such legislation was termed
discriminatory in 1972 by the
U.S. Department of Health, Edu
cation and Welfare. But com
munication researcher Matilda
Butler observed in a recent paper
that nationally, "the ghosts of
anti-nepotism function as effi
ciently as the rules themselves

once did."
Robert Sears, professor
emeritus of psychology, called
such laws "holdovers from the
depression, when there was an
effort to spread the work,
around."
Another aspect of the regula
tions was cited in a 1973 Time
article: "These rules were not
designed to bar husbands."
Sears, whose wife Pauline is
professor emeritus of education,
considered the university tradi
tionally open-minded about the
employment of spouses: "Com
pared to large state universities,
Stanford has tried to make ar
rangements that would ease the
situation. Stanford has a much
more personal administration."
At one time, a man and woman
could not teach in the same de
partment here it they were mar
ried to each other.
But now, a couple not only can
work in the same department,
but also can share an appoint
ment.
Such is the position of Renato
Rosaldo, associate professor of
anthropology, and Michelle
Rosaldo, assistant professor of
anthropology. Kach holds 3 A of a
full-time position, with propor
tional salary and teaching load.
The Rosaldos shifted to their
present arrangement, which is
unique here, in 1973. Renato was
then a full-time faculty member
and Michelle had half-time
status.
They are free to work out
teaching responsibilities among
themselves. Both said they ap
preciated the flexibility of their
employment, which helps pro
vide time to care for their young
son.
But a disadvantage of the situ
ation is that, as Michelle put it,

"We both feel we work more
than we're paid for." Although
their teaching duties are re
duced, the Rosaldos said they
assume a sizable share of advis
ing, committee work and other
faculty responsibilities.
Working full-time
The Rosaldos may each
shoulder, more than 3 A of a full
work load, admitted Benjamin
Paul, professor of anthropology
and former department chair
man. But. he maintained, "full
time faculty members work more
than a full-time person is ex
pected to."
Somewhat similar is the situa
tion of George Collier, associate
professor of anthropology, and
his wife, Jane Collier, assistant
professor of anthropology. His
position is full-time and hers,
half-time. But for his wife, (-oi
lier said, "there is a fairly natural
tendency to do more."
Solution
Despite the question of com
pensation, Renato Rosaldo said
he saw "real advantages for the
near future" in maintaining the

split arrangement.
He called it "an important in
stitutional solution in a world
where there are fewer and fewer
jobs available and husbands and
wives are looking for jobs in the
same place." He said he was
"appreciative of Stanford's
openness toward this."
Tenure
Deciding whether to grant te
nure does not present unusual
difficulties with husband and
wife teams, according to An
thropology Prof. Clifford Bar
nett. He said each spouse would
be considered individually at
the usual time and that Renato
was granted tenure last spring.
Provost William Miller said
the splitting of teaching posi
tions was not a formally estab
lished policy, but was an oppor
tunity the university might oc
casionally consider.
"The likelihood of having a
couple in which both would fit
into a particular program is
rather small," Miller noted.
The option of having husband
and wife split a single position,

now practiced at some univer
sities, has not been instituted
here, according to the Provost's
Office.
No official total is available of
the husband-wife combinations
employed as Stanford faculty. In
