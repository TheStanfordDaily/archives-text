# COP exempted from 12-unit requirement

The role of student participa
tion in university governance
here is considered important
enough for the administration to
justify tuition subsidies and an
exemption from the 12-unit
minimum rule for the Council of
Presidents (COP).
"For some number of years —
certainly over a decade — there
has been a policy that the stu
dent body officers may elect to
study at half time (i.e.-B units) at
half tuition during their term of
office," said Registrar Sally
Mahoney. "This is essentially an
ex officii) exception; petitioning
is just a formality. The petitions
are routinely approved."
The petitions of the ASSU fi
nancial manager and the editor
of the Daily are also routinely
approved, Mahoney said.
"The level of COP involve
ment in university governance is
so extraordinary" that both indi
vidual and institutional interests
are served by this policy, she
said!
"In my own personal opinion,
it makes a tremendous differ
ence," said ASSU Vice President
Carole Houck. Both Houck and
Al Tomaszczuk, another vice
president, were on half time last
quarter.
There is also an allotment in
the ASSU budget to help defray

the tuition costs of each member
of the COP, according to Tom
Massey, director of student ac
tivities. Each member gets the
same allotment, $450 per quar
ter, or a total of $1350 per year,
which may be used either as tui
tion credit or paid directly to the
student as salary, said Massey.
Each member gets a $60 monthly
salary as well ($lO5 during the
summer), he said.
The half time/half tuition pol
icy "is absolutely necessary for
the proper functioning of the
paper," said John Freed, editor
of the Daily. "The people who
run the paper have to put in 40
hours per week," he added.
The half time/half tuition op
tion is available to only one
Daily staffer — the editor or the
managing editor. Freed has used
the option for the past three
quarters.
Freed's salary of about $150
every five weeks is paid out of
the general revenues of the Stan
ford Daily Publishing Corpora
tion, of which approximately H5
to 90 per cent is derived from
advertising revenues, according
to Freed.
The editor gets no tuition sub
sidies, said Freed, and although
the editor sets his own salary, "it
has gone down in the past five
years," he said.

paper," said John Freed, editor
of the Daily. "The people who
run the paper have to put in 40
hours per week," he added.
The half time/half tuition op
tion is available to only one
Daily staffer — the editor or the
managing editor. Freed has used
the option for the past three
quarters.
Freed's salary of about $150
every five weeks is paid out of
the general revenues of the Stan
ford Daily Publishing Corpora
tion, of which approximately H5
to 90 per cent is derived from
advertising revenues, according
to Freed.
The editor gets no tuition sub
sidies, said Freed, and although
the editor sets his own salary, "it
has gone down in the past five
years," he said.
The role of student participa
tion in university governance
here is considered important
enough for the administration to
justify tuition subsidies and an
exemption from the 12-unit
minimum rule for the Council of
Presidents (COP).
"For some number of years —
certainly over a decade — there
has been a policy that the stu
dent body officers may elect to
study at half time (i.e.-B units) at
half tuition during their term of
office," said Registrar Sally
Mahoney. "This is essentially an
ex officii) exception; petitioning
is just a formality. The petitions
are routinely approved."
The petitions of the ASSU fi
nancial manager and the editor
of the Daily are also routinely
approved, Mahoney said.
"The level of COP involve
ment in university governance is
so extraordinary" that both indi
vidual and institutional interests
are served by this policy, she
said!
"In my own personal opinion,
it makes a tremendous differ
ence," said ASSU Vice President
Carole Houck. Both Houck and
Al Tomaszczuk, another vice
president, were on half time last
quarter.
There is also an allotment in
the ASSU budget to help defray

the tuition costs of each member
of the COP, according to Tom
Massey, director of student ac
tivities. Each member gets the
same allotment, $450 per quar
ter, or a total of $1350 per year,
which may be used either as tui
tion credit or paid directly to the
student as salary, said Massey.
Each member gets a $60 monthly
salary as well ($lO5 during the
summer), he said.
The half time/half tuition pol
icy "is absolutely necessary for
the proper functioning of the
paper," said John Freed, editor
of the Daily. "The people who
run the paper have to put in 40
hours per week," he added.
