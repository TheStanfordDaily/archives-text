# Ruetz gets his man
## Walsh appointed coach 
### Chris Baker 
Over a quarter century ago Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz, then an assistant football coach at St. Mary's,
tried to recruit Bill Walsh but lost him to San Jose State.
But this December, Ruetz was able to persuade
Walsh, who served as offensive coordinator for the San
Diego Chargers last year, to become the 25th head foot
ball coach in Stanford grid history.
"This is a happy day for me and for Stanford," Ruetz
said in introducing Walsh at a Dec. 13 press confer
ence. "We are fortunate to get a man of Bill Walsh's
ability."
Walsh, 45, has spent the last nine years in the Na
tional Football League since leaving an assistant coach
ing job at Stanford to join the Oakland Raiders as an
assistant.
The selection of Walsh was the culmination of a
three-week-long nationwide search to find a successor
to Jack Christiansen, who was fired less than 24 hours
before the Big Game.
'Right direction'
"I think the program is headed in the right direc
tion," said Walsh. "If I didn't think it was, they could
never have gotten me up here."
Walsh, who signed a three-year contract at $35,000
per year, was making over $50,000 as Charger offensive
coordinator.

"Getting a chance to be a head coach was one of the
considerations in my decision. There were other fac
tors. I wanted to be a head coach but it had to be in a
good situation. I feel I have that at Stanford," said
Walsh.
"The happiest years of my life were the three when I
was an assistant at Stanford. We like the atmosphere,"
said Walsh, referring to his family.
Walsh and his wife Jeri have three children — Steve,
19, Craig, 15, and Elizabeth, 4.
Passing offense
Pro football observers credit Walsh with developing
the potent passing offense of the Cincinnati Bengals and
the San Diego Chargers this year.
Recruiting can mean the difference between a suc
cessful college football season and a poor one. "I've
always liked to recruit," commented Walsh, who has
been away from the college game for 10 years. "I knew
there wasn't any chance in pro football because you
can't get everyone you want."
He will not recruit by position. "I don't want to say
we already have enough left guards. If we can get a
good football player who happens to play a position
where we already have someone, we'll get him and
then find a place for him to play."

per year contract. Walsh replaced Jack Christian
sen, who was released from his five-year contract in
November.
Norb Hecker and offensive line coach Doug Single will
be retained from Christiansen's staff. Fired Cornell
coach George Seifert will also join Walsh's staff. Fred
vonAppen, a member of the Oregon staff the last five
seasons has also been hired.
Stanford backfield coach Dave Currey was named
head football coach at Long Beach State last month.
Currey, 33, coached here for five years. Currey will take
defensive backfield coach Willie Shaw and graduate
assistant Keith Rowan with him to Long Beach.
This leaves three other Christiansen assistants who
are still looking for a job — Gunther Cunningham, Pete
Kettela and t)on Frease.
Walsh, a graduate of San Jose State, started his
coaching career at Washington High School in Fre
mont. His teams had a three-year record of 15-10-2 and
won the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League Champion
ship with a 9-0-1 record in 1958.

always liked to recruit," commented Walsh, who has
been away from the college game for 10 years. "I knew
there wasn't any chance in pro football because you
can't get everyone you want."
He will not recruit by position. "I don't want to say
we already have enough left guards. If we can get a
good football player who happens to play a position
where we already have someone, we'll get him and
then find a place for him to play."

per year contract. Walsh replaced Jack Christian
sen, who was released from his five-year contract in
November.
Norb Hecker and offensive line coach Doug Single will
be retained from Christiansen's staff. Fired Cornell
coach George Seifert will also join Walsh's staff. Fred
vonAppen, a member of the Oregon staff the last five
seasons has also been hired.
Stanford backfield coach Dave Currey was named
head football coach at Long Beach State last month.
Currey, 33, coached here for five years. Currey will take
defensive backfield coach Willie Shaw and graduate
assistant Keith Rowan with him to Long Beach.
This leaves three other Christiansen assistants who
are still looking for a job — Gunther Cunningham, Pete
Kettela and t)on Frease.
Walsh, a graduate of San Jose State, started his
coaching career at Washington High School in Fre
mont. His teams had a three-year record of 15-10-2 and
won the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League Champion
ship with a 9-0-1 record in 1958.
Over a quarter century ago Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz, then an assistant football coach at St. Mary's,
tried to recruit Bill Walsh but lost him to San Jose State.
But this December, Ruetz was able to persuade
Walsh, who served as offensive coordinator for the San
Diego Chargers last year, to become the 25th head foot
ball coach in Stanford grid history.
"This is a happy day for me and for Stanford," Ruetz
said in introducing Walsh at a Dec. 13 press confer
ence. "We are fortunate to get a man of Bill Walsh's
ability."
Walsh, 45, has spent the last nine years in the Na
tional Football League since leaving an assistant coach
ing job at Stanford to join the Oakland Raiders as an
assistant.
The selection of Walsh was the culmination of a
three-week-long nationwide search to find a successor
to Jack Christiansen, who was fired less than 24 hours
before the Big Game.
'Right direction'
"I think the program is headed in the right direc
tion," said Walsh. "If I didn't think it was, they could
never have gotten me up here."
Walsh, who signed a three-year contract at $35,000
per year, was making over $50,000 as Charger offensive
coordinator.

"Getting a chance to be a head coach was one of the
considerations in my decision. There were other fac
tors. I wanted to be a head coach but it had to be in a
good situation. I feel I have that at Stanford," said
Walsh.
"The happiest years of my life were the three when I
was an assistant at Stanford. We like the atmosphere,"
said Walsh, referring to his family.
Walsh and his wife Jeri have three children — Steve,
19, Craig, 15, and Elizabeth, 4.
Passing offense
Pro football observers credit Walsh with developing
the potent passing offense of the Cincinnati Bengals and
the San Diego Chargers this year.
Recruiting can mean the difference between a suc
cessful college football season and a poor one. "I've
always liked to recruit," commented Walsh, who has
been away from the college game for 10 years. "I knew
