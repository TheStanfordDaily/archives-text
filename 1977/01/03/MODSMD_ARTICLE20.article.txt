## Conference scheduling problems to be resolved Arizona, ASU invited to join Pac-8 
### Chris Baker 
The Pacific-10 is no longer just
speculation.
The Pac-8 Presidents and
Chancellors' Committee unank
mously voted, in a December 13
meeting in San Francisco, to in
vite Arizona and Arizona State
to join the conference.
"It is the conviction of all the
members of this conference that
what we are doing is not a move
to realign the existing arrange
ments," said conference
spokesman UCLA Chancellor
Charles Young, "but to add two
new members.
"The expectation is that the
existing members . . . will be
joined together for many years to
come."
USC and UCLA led the drive
to get the Arizona schools into
the league. There were threats
that Southern California and
UCLA would become indepen
dent if Arizona and ASU were
not invited. The invitation re
quired a unanimous vote of the
Pac-8 presidents and chancel
lors.
Tentative football schedules
for 1978 through 1986 have been
drawn to include Arizona and
Arizona State. The league will
not use a round robin schedule,
because some schools do not
want to give up the four non
conference games.
David Price, assistant execu

tive director of the Pac-8, said
that the schedules are just tenta
tive and subject to the approval
of the athletic director of the con
ference.
Dave Maggard, Cal athletic
director, said that natural rival
ries would be preserved on an
annual basis. So Stanford will
probably continue to play USC,
UCLA and Cal every year.
Scheduling
Future Pac-8 games, already
slated, will be switched or
eliminated to ensure that the
Arizona schools are eligible for
the conference championship.
Maggard said that while
some teams will play seven
games and others eight, the ath
letic directors talked about de
signating an intersectional op
ponent as a "conference"game to
balance the schedule.
In basketball the Pac-10 will
play a full double-round robin
18-game schedule, beginning
with the 1978-79 season.
In baseball, a six-team south
ern division and a northern divi
sion will be established in 1978
and the conference plans to ask
the NCAA for automatic qualifi
cation into the NCAA tourna
ment for each division.
Conference approval
But as Price added, all these
schedules must still be approved
by the conference athletic direc
tors early this month.

There was some concern that
the Arizona schools are not up to
the high academic standards of
the conference. But the move
was welcomed by adminis
trators at the two schools.
"We can have joint projects
with schools like Stanford and
Cal," said one Arizona professor.
Stanford Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz was unable to attend the
meeting because it conflicted
with the press conference for
new head football coach Bill
Walsh. He said that he had been
advised by President Richard
Lyman to refer all questions
about the move to a conference
spokesman.
'Power play'
But it is believed that Stanford
wasn't wild about the move. One
Stanford source said of USC's
and UCLA's involvement in the
decision, "it was one of the
crudest examples of power poli
tics."
USC Athletic Director Richard
Perry said that dwindling foot
ball attendance at Oregon, Ore
gon State and Washington State
and the even split of gate re
ceipts was hurting his school's
athletic budget.
USC and UCLA athletic de
partment officials believe that
the addition of the Arizona
schools, who have large football
stadiums and draw good
crowds, will help their budgets.
Pac-8 aid
"USC and UCLA felt they were
not receiving the kind of return
on investment their teams de
served, that they were in fact
subsidizing the rest of the con
ference, particularly the three
northern schools," said Oregon
President William Boyd.
"We had to face brute facts.
We were indeed beneficiaries of
the 50-50 split and television re
venues.
"USC was in a position to in
sist on change. It could go inde
pendent and make more money.
We could vote for expansion or
we could agree to a change in the
distribution of revenue.
"To have done nothing would
have lost the two southern

schools. To change the revenue
sharing format would have
squeezed out the northern
schools," said Boyd.
Economic necessity
"There are two or three of us —
and I don't have to name them —
that could not have survived
economically in that change."
But Arizona State football
coach Frank Kush had just one
word for proposals of joining the
two Arizona schools with the
Pac-8 in research, "Bullshit."
Kush, whose Sun Devils had a
poor season, was not high on the
Pac-10 because of the increased
level of competition.
The conference must now
search for a new name in addi
tion to finalizing all the other de
tails. The Los Angeles Times re
cently suggested*".Six Pac plus
four."


Incomparable welcome

Chancellors' Committee unank
mously voted, in a December 13
meeting in San Francisco, to in
vite Arizona and Arizona State
to join the conference.
"It is the conviction of all the
members of this conference that
what we are doing is not a move
to realign the existing arrange
ments," said conference
spokesman UCLA Chancellor
Charles Young, "but to add two
new members.
"The expectation is that the
existing members . . . will be
joined together for many years to
come."
USC and UCLA led the drive
to get the Arizona schools into
the league. There were threats
that Southern California and
UCLA would become indepen
dent if Arizona and ASU were
not invited. The invitation re
quired a unanimous vote of the
Pac-8 presidents and chancel
lors.
Tentative football schedules
for 1978 through 1986 have been
drawn to include Arizona and
Arizona State. The league will
not use a round robin schedule,
because some schools do not
want to give up the four non
conference games.
David Price, assistant execu

tive director of the Pac-8, said
that the schedules are just tenta
tive and subject to the approval
of the athletic director of the con
ference.
Dave Maggard, Cal athletic
director, said that natural rival
ries would be preserved on an
annual basis. So Stanford will
probably continue to play USC,
UCLA and Cal every year.
Scheduling
Future Pac-8 games, already
slated, will be switched or
eliminated to ensure that the
Arizona schools are eligible for
the conference championship.
Maggard said that while
some teams will play seven
games and others eight, the ath
letic directors talked about de
signating an intersectional op
ponent as a "conference"game to
balance the schedule.
In basketball the Pac-10 will
play a full double-round robin
18-game schedule, beginning
with the 1978-79 season.
In baseball, a six-team south
ern division and a northern divi
sion will be established in 1978
and the conference plans to ask
the NCAA for automatic qualifi
cation into the NCAA tourna
ment for each division.
Conference approval
But as Price added, all these
schedules must still be approved
by the conference athletic direc
tors early this month.

There was some concern that
the Arizona schools are not up to
the high academic standards of
the conference. But the move
was welcomed by adminis
trators at the two schools.
"We can have joint projects
with schools like Stanford and
Cal," said one Arizona professor.
Stanford Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz was unable to attend the
meeting because it conflicted
with the press conference for
new head football coach Bill
Walsh. He said that he had been
advised by President Richard
Lyman to refer all questions
about the move to a conference
spokesman.
'Power play'
But it is believed that Stanford
wasn't wild about the move. One
Stanford source said of USC's
and UCLA's involvement in the
decision, "it was one of the
crudest examples of power poli
tics."
USC Athletic Director Richard
Perry said that dwindling foot
ball attendance at Oregon, Ore
gon State and Washington State
and the even split of gate re
ceipts was hurting his school's
athletic budget.
USC and UCLA athletic de
partment officials believe that
the addition of the Arizona
schools, who have large football
stadiums and draw good
crowds, will help their budgets.
Pac-8 aid
"USC and UCLA felt they were
not receiving the kind of return
on investment their teams de
served, that they were in fact
subsidizing the rest of the con
ference, particularly the three
northern schools," said Oregon
President William Boyd.
"We had to face brute facts.
We were indeed beneficiaries of
the 50-50 split and television re
venues.
"USC was in a position to in
sist on change. It could go inde
pendent and make more money.
We could vote for expansion or
we could agree to a change in the
distribution of revenue.
"To have done nothing would
have lost the two southern

schools. To change the revenue
sharing format would have
squeezed out the northern
schools," said Boyd.
Economic necessity
"There are two or three of us —
and I don't have to name them —
that could not have survived
economically in that change."
But Arizona State football
coach Frank Kush had just one
word for proposals of joining the
two Arizona schools with the
Pac-8 in research, "Bullshit."
Kush, whose Sun Devils had a
poor season, was not high on the
Pac-10 because of the increased
level of competition.
The conference must now
search for a new name in addi
tion to finalizing all the other de
tails. The Los Angeles Times re
cently suggested*".Six Pac plus
four."

to join the conference.
"It is the conviction of all the
members of this conference that
what we are doing is not a move
to realign the existing arrange
ments," said conference
spokesman UCLA Chancellor
Charles Young, "but to add two
new members.
"The expectation is that the
existing members . . . will be
joined together for many years to
come."
USC and UCLA led the drive
to get the Arizona schools into
the league. There were threats
that Southern California and
UCLA would become indepen
dent if Arizona and ASU were
not invited. The invitation re
quired a unanimous vote of the
Pac-8 presidents and chancel
lors.
Tentative football schedules
for 1978 through 1986 have been
drawn to include Arizona and
Arizona State. The league will
not use a round robin schedule,
because some schools do not
want to give up the four non
conference games.
David Price, assistant execu

tive director of the Pac-8, said
that the schedules are just tenta
tive and subject to the approval
of the athletic director of the con
ference.
Dave Maggard, Cal athletic
director, said that natural rival
ries would be preserved on an
annual basis. So Stanford will
probably continue to play USC,
UCLA and Cal every year.
Scheduling
Future Pac-8 games, already
slated, will be switched or
eliminated to ensure that the
Arizona schools are eligible for
the conference championship.
Maggard said that while
some teams will play seven
games and others eight, the ath
letic directors talked about de
signating an intersectional op
ponent as a "conference"game to
balance the schedule.
In basketball the Pac-10 will
play a full double-round robin
18-game schedule, beginning
with the 1978-79 season.
In baseball, a six-team south
ern division and a northern divi
sion will be established in 1978
and the conference plans to ask
the NCAA for automatic qualifi
cation into the NCAA tourna
ment for each division.
Conference approval
But as Price added, all these
schedules must still be approved
by the conference athletic direc
tors early this month.

There was some concern that
the Arizona schools are not up to
the high academic standards of
the conference. But the move
was welcomed by adminis
trators at the two schools.
"We can have joint projects
with schools like Stanford and
Cal," said one Arizona professor.
Stanford Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz was unable to attend the
meeting because it conflicted
with the press conference for
new head football coach Bill
Walsh. He said that he had been
advised by President Richard
Lyman to refer all questions
about the move to a conference
spokesman.
'Power play'
But it is believed that Stanford
wasn't wild about the move. One
Stanford source said of USC's
and UCLA's involvement in the
decision, "it was one of the
crudest examples of power poli
tics."
USC Athletic Director Richard
Perry said that dwindling foot
ball attendance at Oregon, Ore
gon State and Washington State
and the even split of gate re
ceipts was hurting his school's
athletic budget.
USC and UCLA athletic de
partment officials believe that
the addition of the Arizona
schools, who have large football
stadiums and draw good
crowds, will help their budgets.
Pac-8 aid
"USC and UCLA felt they were
not receiving the kind of return
on investment their teams de
served, that they were in fact
subsidizing the rest of the con
ference, particularly the three
northern schools," said Oregon
President William Boyd.
"We had to face brute facts.
We were indeed beneficiaries of
the 50-50 split and television re
venues.
"USC was in a position to in
sist on change. It could go inde
pendent and make more money.
We could vote for expansion or
we could agree to a change in the
distribution of revenue.
"To have done nothing would
have lost the two southern

schools. To change the revenue
sharing format would have
squeezed out the northern
schools," said Boyd.
Economic necessity
"There are two or three of us —
and I don't have to name them —
that could not have survived
economically in that change."
But Arizona State football
coach Frank Kush had just one
word for proposals of joining the
two Arizona schools with the
Pac-8 in research, "Bullshit."
Kush, whose Sun Devils had a
poor season, was not high on the
Pac-10 because of the increased
level of competition.
The conference must now
search for a new name in addi
tion to finalizing all the other de
tails. The Los Angeles Times re
cently suggested*".Six Pac plus
four."


Incomparable welcome

The Pacific-10 is no longer just
speculation.
The Pac-8 Presidents and
Chancellors' Committee unank
mously voted, in a December 13
meeting in San Francisco, to in
vite Arizona and Arizona State
to join the conference.
