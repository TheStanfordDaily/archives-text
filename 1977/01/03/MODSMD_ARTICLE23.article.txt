# 'Stanford picked the right man'
## Walsh a hit with press 
### Chris Baker 
It was more like a circus, or a
LSJIJMB halftime show, than a
press conference.
A contingent from the Band,
alumni and members of the Bay
Area sporting media gathered at
Mings' Restaurant to welcome
Bill Walsh back to the Farm after
nine years in pro football.
Walsh had been away from the
National Football League for less
than 24 hours and already he
was getting back into college
life.
"I'm not sure I ever fit the pro
coaching image anyway," said
Walsh. "The happiest years of
my life were the three years
when I was an assistant at Stan
ford. We like the atmosphere."
Band yell
The Band interrupted Walsh
with one of their irreverent yells.
"Walsh, you'd better be nice to
us. Jack wasn't."
Walsh is stepping into a job
with many His predeces
sor, Jack Christiansen, specu
lated that with every doctor's
degree Stanford also hands out a
coaching degree.
"We have discerning
graduates. They are entitled to
their opinion. What they say
won't bother me. I'm coming
from a tough environment —the
National F"ootball League."
In introducing Walsh to the
gathering, Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz said, "We talked to other
people to see what they thought
of Bill Walsh and everyone was
favorable. We started thinking
that no man can be that good. I
believe he will be a credit to
Stanford."
Big introduction
Ruetz' introduction was
enough to make even Hollywood
press agents blush. But Walsh
didn't turn Cardinal red. "I think
Stanford picked the right man,"
he smiled.
Walsh's first goal will be re
cruiting athletes who fit the
Stanford image. "We will recruit
the best student-athletes availa
ble. Stanford has a reputation for
academic excellence and we
would like to have the same
reputation in athletics," said
Walsh.
"We would like to feel we
could meet any competition

with a chance of success. I hope
to provide the same excellence
to students on the football field
as they get in the classroom."
The Band came up with
another yell. "Walsh, will you
march in the Rose Parade with
us?" He had a good reply ready.
"I hope to be in the locker room.
'Winning a measure'
"I think winning is a measure
of success of any football prog
ram. It's not the only thing but it
is a measure.
"Playing in the Rose Bowl is a
goal and I expect that we can be a
part of it. We need some out
standing players. Maybe three.
And we need a good group to
back them up."
"Stanford has had good
athletes like Jim Plunkett and
Gene Washington in the past.
We hope to continue to attract
good athletes."
Passing offense
Walsh does not plan to convert
Stanford into a stodgy Big Ten
running attack. "You develop a
knowledge of how to move the

ball when you work in pro foot
ball. 1 know the forward pass.
"We will use the best offense
to move the ball. If we have a
great runner, we'll run the ball.
We won't be conservative."
Christiansen, the man that
Walsh is replacing, was the first
college football coach to be fired
with a winning record. But
Christiansen managed just one
win in five years against USC
and UCLA.
USC and UCLA
"We will find a way to beat
them (USC and UCLA). We are in
a highly competitive conference
and hope to do well."
Walsh was a hit with the band,
but what about alumni?
"We are elated to get a man of
the caliber of Bill Walsh," said
Search Committee vice chair
man Frank Lodato. "He made a
very favorable impression."
Walsh probably impressed the
committee as a hard worker.
After the press conference he left
immediately to begin putting to
gether a coaching staff and re
cruiting players.
