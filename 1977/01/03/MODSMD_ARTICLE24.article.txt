# USC claims it's No. 1
## 
### Chris Baker 
Pasadena — "We've already taken a poll and
we're the national champions," said USC foot
ball coach John Robinson after his Trojans
upset second-ranked Michigan 14-6 in the
63rd Rose Bowl Game Saturday — "The
Granddaddy of All the Bowl Games."
"You're damn right, I think we should be
ranked first," said Robinson. "I still feel the
way I felt before the game on that matter. I don't
intend to be objective.
"If a club can claim a share of the national
championship they should. I'm in no way cast
ing inference on Pittsburgh — they're a great
team. And Michigan is a great team too. Be
sides one poll has already picked us No. 1. It's
not the UPI poll. It's the USC poll."
Missouri upset
If schizophrenic Missouri hadn't upset USC
46-25 in the season opener, USC would be ad
ding another trophy to Heritage Hall this week.
But Pittsburgh, on the strength of a 27-3
Sugar Bowl victory over Georgia will claim its
first title in 39 years.
Wolverine coach Bo Schembechler, who de
cided to change his old Woody Hayes image
during the two weeks before the Rose Bowl,
didn't try to hide from the press after the loss.
"I feel very strongly that USC is a very pow
erful and quick team. Since I've been at Michi
gan, I don't think we've played a team as phys
ical and quick as this. I don't have a vote in the
UPI poll, but if I did I would vote for USC as the
No. 1 team."
Bell lost
USC All-American tailback Ricky Bell
climaxed a season of frustration, one in which
injuries cost him the Heisman Trophy, with a
concussion which knocked him out of the
game on the Trojans' opening series of the con
test.
Robinson asked the reporters to leave Bell
alone. "Ricky Bell was hurt on a legitimate and
excellent tackle. He took it in the side of the
head. He now has a headache, and because of
that, he didn't feel like talking to the press."
But Bell's substitute, freshman tailback
Charles White — who filled in for Bell against
Stanford — stepped in to gain 114 yards on 32
carries and score one touchdown.
The freshman, who earlier in the season said,

"I'm gonna get me three of them Heisman
Trophies," sustained the Trojans' first scoring
march of the afternoon. White carried for 35
yards in eight runs in an 80-yard drive to put
USC ahead of Michigan 7-6 at halftime.
Poor punt
After Glenn Walker got off a 34-yard punt
under heavy pressure, Michigan went 50 yards
in 12 plays to go ahead 6-0. Jerry Zuver, who
usually holds for place kicks, was injured dur
ing the scoreless first quarter.
The Wolverines jased Curt Stephenson as the
holder and the new timing allowed SC defen
sive tackle Walt Underwood to block the con
version attempt.
Michigan, the nation's leading scoring team
(remember 51-0?), couldn't mount any serious
passing attack. Quarterback Rich Leach hit
only four of 12 passes for 76 yards, but 44 of the
yards came during the Wolverines' final desp
eration drive of the afternoon.
While Leach was proving that the nasty
things Pac-8 fans say about the Big Ten are
true, USC quarterback Vince Evans was vin
dicating himself.
Sports Illustrated said that Evans couldn't
hit the Grand Canyon with his eyes open. Last
year it was true — Evans passed at a 31 per cent
clip.
Player of Game
Evans hit 14 of 20 for 181 yards to walk off
with the Player of the Game award. "Let's hear
it for gold old Vince Evans," said Robinson.
"Vince Evans played a great football game. He
was super. There's nothing more pleasing to
me than to say that."
Evans was sacked only once. "Their quarter
back played a great game," said Schembechler.
"I was not unhappy with the defensive rush.
The ability of Evans to step up and avoid the
rush made it very difficult."
Evans was probably more afraid of the
crunch of the media, which pushed him back
into his locker after the game, than the Michi
gan rush. "My main objective was to go out and
do the best possible job that I could. If you
listen to all the critics you can't do anything.
"We had a super game plan devised by coach
(Paul) Hackett."

(Paul) Hackett."
Pasadena — "We've already taken a poll and
we're the national champions," said USC foot
ball coach John Robinson after his Trojans
upset second-ranked Michigan 14-6 in the
63rd Rose Bowl Game Saturday — "The
Granddaddy of All the Bowl Games."
"You're damn right, I think we should be
ranked first," said Robinson. "I still feel the
way I felt before the game on that matter. I don't
intend to be objective.
"If a club can claim a share of the national
championship they should. I'm in no way cast
ing inference on Pittsburgh — they're a great
team. And Michigan is a great team too. Be
sides one poll has already picked us No. 1. It's
not the UPI poll. It's the USC poll."
Missouri upset
If schizophrenic Missouri hadn't upset USC
46-25 in the season opener, USC would be ad
ding another trophy to Heritage Hall this week.
But Pittsburgh, on the strength of a 27-3
Sugar Bowl victory over Georgia will claim its
first title in 39 years.
Wolverine coach Bo Schembechler, who de
cided to change his old Woody Hayes image
during the two weeks before the Rose Bowl,
didn't try to hide from the press after the loss.
"I feel very strongly that USC is a very pow
erful and quick team. Since I've been at Michi
gan, I don't think we've played a team as phys
ical and quick as this. I don't have a vote in the
UPI poll, but if I did I would vote for USC as the
No. 1 team."
Bell lost
USC All-American tailback Ricky Bell
climaxed a season of frustration, one in which
injuries cost him the Heisman Trophy, with a
concussion which knocked him out of the
game on the Trojans' opening series of the con
test.
Robinson asked the reporters to leave Bell
alone. "Ricky Bell was hurt on a legitimate and
excellent tackle. He took it in the side of the
head. He now has a headache, and because of
that, he didn't feel like talking to the press."
But Bell's substitute, freshman tailback
Charles White — who filled in for Bell against
Stanford — stepped in to gain 114 yards on 32
carries and score one touchdown.
The freshman, who earlier in the season said,

"I'm gonna get me three of them Heisman
Trophies," sustained the Trojans' first scoring
march of the afternoon. White carried for 35
yards in eight runs in an 80-yard drive to put
USC ahead of Michigan 7-6 at halftime.
Poor punt
After Glenn Walker got off a 34-yard punt
under heavy pressure, Michigan went 50 yards
in 12 plays to go ahead 6-0. Jerry Zuver, who
usually holds for place kicks, was injured dur
ing the scoreless first quarter.
The Wolverines jased Curt Stephenson as the
holder and the new timing allowed SC defen
sive tackle Walt Underwood to block the con
version attempt.
Michigan, the nation's leading scoring team
(remember 51-0?), couldn't mount any serious
passing attack. Quarterback Rich Leach hit
only four of 12 passes for 76 yards, but 44 of the
yards came during the Wolverines' final desp
eration drive of the afternoon.
While Leach was proving that the nasty
things Pac-8 fans say about the Big Ten are
true, USC quarterback Vince Evans was vin
dicating himself.
Sports Illustrated said that Evans couldn't
hit the Grand Canyon with his eyes open. Last
year it was true — Evans passed at a 31 per cent
clip.
Player of Game
Evans hit 14 of 20 for 181 yards to walk off
with the Player of the Game award. "Let's hear
it for gold old Vince Evans," said Robinson.
"Vince Evans played a great football game. He
was super. There's nothing more pleasing to
me than to say that."
Evans was sacked only once. "Their quarter
back played a great game," said Schembechler.
"I was not unhappy with the defensive rush.
The ability of Evans to step up and avoid the
rush made it very difficult."
Evans was probably more afraid of the
crunch of the media, which pushed him back
into his locker after the game, than the Michi
gan rush. "My main objective was to go out and
do the best possible job that I could. If you
listen to all the critics you can't do anything.
"We had a super game plan devised by coach
(Paul) Hackett."
