# Rain keeps crowd down
## West wins Shrine Game 30-14

Water, water everywhere!
Sixty football players from
colleges across the nation came
to Stanford for the 52nd East-
West Shrine Game planning to
spend their Christmas vacation
playing football and soaking up
the sunshine that the Golden
State is known for.
The myths about the blue
sunny skies were proven untrue
in yesterday's downpour yet the
gridders' spirits were not dam
pened. They came to play foot

ball and thus they did — rain or
not.
In front of a soggy crowd of
45,000, the West defeated the
East 30-14.
Poor start
The East team got off to a poor
start when LSU's Terry Robiskie
fumbled on the first play from
scrimmage. West linebacker
Robin Cole of New Mexico reco
vered the ball on the East's 13-
yard line and then it took the
West team only two minutes to
score. San Jose State's Rick Kane
took it over from the two.
The East team no sooner got
the ball back when Minnesota
quarterback Tony Dungy threw
an interception to Jay Locey of
OSU. The West took advantage
of the interception and marched
42 yards to another score, finally
sending in Stanford's Mike
Michel to kick a 30-yard field
goal.
East coach Joe Yukica of Bos
ton College said, "We tightened
up a bit after that happened. I
told the guys to keep their com
posure, that we could come
back."
The East team got on the board
next when running back Rob
Carpenter of Miami of Ohio
pounded the ball in from the one
yard line. The workhorse of the
East offense, Carpenter was
named the offensive Player of
the Game. He carried the ball 22
times, gaining 100 yards.
'Good cause'
"I didn't expect to be named
most valuable player," Car
penter said. "I just wanted to
play a good game. I was disap
pointed we didn't win but the
game was for a good cause (the
Shriners' hospitals) so I guess
nobody really lost.
"I'm sure my presence in the
game today will give Miami pub
licity," Carpenter said. "We
didn't have an impressive record
this year — we were 3-8. The
past three years we were in the
top 20 teams in the nation."
West explosion
The West exploded in the sec
ond quarter putting 14 points on
the board. Following their first
touchdown by Kane which was a
one yard run, the West team daz
zled the crowd when Gary Green
of Baylor ran a punt back 81
yards for a touchdown. With the
runback, Green established a
Shrine Game record, breaking
the old mark of 72 yards which
was set in the 1935 game.
Later in the game Green ran a
punt back 53 yards. Green, a

5-11,184 pound defensive back,
was named defensive Player of
the Game for his pass coverage.
One person very aware of
Green's presence on the field
was East quarterback Randy
Dean of Northwestern. Because
not only did Dean see Green's
coverage on the East receivers
but it was Dean who punted the
ball right into Baylor speedster's
hands.
Poor passing
Dean was not about to let
Green steal the show. Following
the impressive punt return, the
East team scored on a 48-yard
pass play from Dean to Elmo
Boyd of Eastern Kentucky. The
pass was Dean's only comple
tion of the game as he was 1 for
11 and had one interception.
"I couldn't hit the broad side
of a barn," Dean said. "I wanted
to play well. I was on a 1-10 team
this year and being selected for
this game was an honor. But, I'm
not interested in playing pro ball
like most of the other guys are."
Dean's only interception came
in the third quarter when the
West's Locey grabbed the ball on
the one yard line. The 42-yard
pass was intended for Boston
College's Don Peterson but the
West's Ray Claybourne of Texas
knocked the ball from his hands
a split second after he caught it.
Locey dove for the ball, making
his interception look more like a
fumble recovery because he
snatched the ball so near to the
ground.
Two interceptions
It was Locey's second inter
ception of the day and for those
efforts and his seven unassisted
tackles, he received the second
most votes for most valuable de
fensive player of the game.

Locey's grandfather played in
the first Shrine Game and
watched from the stands yester
day.
The fourth quarter was a hey
day for Stanford football players
who were members of the West
team. Mike Michel kicked two
field goals — one for 34 yards
and the other for an astounding
49 yards. With that kick, Michel
set a Shrine game record. He
broke the old mark of 44 yards
set in 1930. It is interesting to
note that that 44-yard field goal
was a drop kick.
Duncan McColl, who played a
good, hard game, recovered an
East fumble. He also sacked
Dean for a loss of 15 yards.
Mike Cordova went into the
game with 42 seconds left as he
took over the West forces from
Mark Jackson of Baylor. Cordova
was not originally chosen as a
member of the team, but when
Cal's Joe Roth suffered a back
spasm in practice and could not
play, Cordova was summoned.
"Mike arrived Saturday,"
Michel said. "He set his suitcase
down and we started telling him
the plays."
Joe Roth's sub
Jackson, Roth's back-up man,
threw for 116 yards, completing
13 of 26 attempts. "It was a great
opportunity for me," he said. "It
was a disappointment to Joe and I
think he would have meant a lot
to our team if he had played."
West Coach Grant Teaff of
Baylor said of his team following
the game, "We've got 25 guys
who could make the pros."
East Coach Yukica felt the
same way. "It was a lot of fun
coaching these guys. All the
players were very talented and
they responded well after only
nine practices."
