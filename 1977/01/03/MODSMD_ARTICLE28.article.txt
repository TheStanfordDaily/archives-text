# Stanford freshmen mature
## Cards upset Badgers 
### David Georgette 
The optimistic predictions for
Stanford basketball, which ac
companied freshmen Kimberly
Belton and Tom Schmalzried to
the Farm this season, reached
fruition Saturday, Dec. 11, as the
two freshmen led the Cardinals
to a thrilling 70-66 victory over
the Wisconsin Badgers.
Belton hit six of his 11 shots
from the field and grabbed a
game-high 12 rebounds while
Schmalzried also canned six of
11 shots with eight rebounds.
Stanford guard Wolfe Perry and
Wisconsin's Bill Pearson were
the game's high scorers with 18
points apiece.
The Cards almost gave the
game away at the free-throw line
in the last hectic minutes. Stan
ford had taken a 67-66 lead on
Mike Bratz' 20-footer jumper
from the top of the key with five
minutes to play. However, in
two one-plus-one situations,
Stanford's Paul Giovacchini was
only able to net one shot.
Pressure free-throw
With 24 seconds to play, and
trailing by two, the Badgers had
the ball out-of-bounds at mid
court. An offensive dead-ball
foul, against Wisconsin's James
Smith before the in-bounds pass,
though, sent Bratz to the free
throw line with a chance to ice
away the victory.
Bratz missed the front end of
the pair. Then the Cards' Mark
Fitzner intercepted an errant
Badger pass in the front court
and was fouled.
Fitzner showed why he is cal
led the Cards' "designated shoo
ter" as he sank both his free
throws and sent the crowd of
2345 and the Stanford "Red
Vest" Band into a spirited rendi
tion of "All Right, Now."
The Cards had turned a 45-37
deficit at halftime into a 57-56
lead with lIV 2 minutes to play
with a six-minute spurt during
which Belton and Schmalzried
combined for 13 of the Cards' 15

points. The final margin of vic
tory represented Stanford's
largest lead of the second half.
Wisconsin could only manage
21 points in the second half, a
fact very satisfying to Card coach
Dick Dißiaso. After the game Di-
Biaso said that at half the Cards
had set out to limit the Badgers
to 30 points in the second stanza.
The Badgers shot only 27 per
cent from the field in the second
half.
Early lead
In the first half, the Cards had
jumped out to an early lead and

stretched it to 31-23 with six mi
nutes to play in the half. How
ever, Stanford could only man
age one more field goal the rest
of the half while the Badgers col
lected seven field goals and hit
on eight of 11 from the line.
But in the second half, the
Badgers could not stop the
freshmen. "The players are re
ally starting to believe in them
selves," said Dißiaso. "They're
playing with a great deal of emo
tion and intensity. Some of our
younger players are really be
ginning to make their presence
felt."

The optimistic predictions for
Stanford basketball, which ac
companied freshmen Kimberly
Belton and Tom Schmalzried to
the Farm this season, reached
fruition Saturday, Dec. 11, as the
two freshmen led the Cardinals
to a thrilling 70-66 victory over
the Wisconsin Badgers.
Belton hit six of his 11 shots
from the field and grabbed a
game-high 12 rebounds while
Schmalzried also canned six of
11 shots with eight rebounds.
Stanford guard Wolfe Perry and
Wisconsin's Bill Pearson were
the game's high scorers with 18
points apiece.
The Cards almost gave the
game away at the free-throw line
in the last hectic minutes. Stan
ford had taken a 67-66 lead on
Mike Bratz' 20-footer jumper
from the top of the key with five
minutes to play. However, in
two one-plus-one situations,
Stanford's Paul Giovacchini was
only able to net one shot.
Pressure free-throw
With 24 seconds to play, and
trailing by two, the Badgers had
the ball out-of-bounds at mid
court. An offensive dead-ball
foul, against Wisconsin's James
Smith before the in-bounds pass,
though, sent Bratz to the free
throw line with a chance to ice
away the victory.
Bratz missed the front end of
the pair. Then the Cards' Mark
Fitzner intercepted an errant
Badger pass in the front court
and was fouled.
Fitzner showed why he is cal
led the Cards' "designated shoo
ter" as he sank both his free
throws and sent the crowd of
2345 and the Stanford "Red
Vest" Band into a spirited rendi
tion of "All Right, Now."
The Cards had turned a 45-37
deficit at halftime into a 57-56
lead with lIV 2 minutes to play
with a six-minute spurt during
which Belton and Schmalzried
combined for 13 of the Cards' 15

points. The final margin of vic
tory represented Stanford's
largest lead of the second half.
Wisconsin could only manage
21 points in the second half, a
fact very satisfying to Card coach
Dick Dißiaso. After the game Di-
Biaso said that at half the Cards
had set out to limit the Badgers
to 30 points in the second stanza.
The Badgers shot only 27 per
cent from the field in the second
half.
Early lead
In the first half, the Cards had
jumped out to an early lead and

stretched it to 31-23 with six mi
nutes to play in the half. How
ever, Stanford could only man
age one more field goal the rest
of the half while the Badgers col
lected seven field goals and hit
on eight of 11 from the line.
But in the second half, the
Badgers could not stop the
freshmen. "The players are re
ally starting to believe in them
selves," said Dißiaso. "They're
playing with a great deal of emo
tion and intensity. Some of our
younger players are really be
ginning to make their presence
felt."
