# In those other holiday games...

The Farm, the desert, the mountains —
they are not necessarily the best combi
nation of places to spend the December
holidays.
As far as Stanford's Dick Dißiaso is
concerned, though, his holiday season
could not really have been much better.
Stanford's cagers enjoyed a 5-1 vacation,
upping their overall record to 7-3.
Stanford 85, Northridige 67
The Cards started their festivities the
Friday before autumn finals with a 85-67
rout of Cal-State Northridge at Maples
Pavilion.
Kimberly Belton led four Stanford
scorers in double-figures with 19 points.
Mike Bratz finished with 16 points while
Jay Carter and Jeff McHugh recorded 14
apiece. The Cards led by 11 at half and
outscored Cal-State Northridge 36-29 in
the second half.
Stanford 70, Wisconsin 67
The next night the Cards had a much
more difficult opponent, the Wisconsin
Badgers. The 70-66 Stanford triumph
gave the Cards their third consecutive
win.
Wolfe Perry tallied 18 for Stanford
while Belton collected 12 rebounds.

Stanford 95, UC-Davis 76
The first Monday of vacation, the UC-
Davis Aggies came to Maples, Last year,
the Aggies' coach, Bob Hamilton, grab
bed the attention of the Maples crowd
with his towel-throwing and chair
kicking. They did not help too much as
the Cards won, 91-76.
This year Hamilton's antics were not of
much help, either, as the Cards jumped
to a 3(M lead in the first seven minutes of
the game on the way to a 95-65 demoli
tion of the Aggies. Cuard Mike Bratz
finished with 21 points, hitting seven of
10 from the field in the first half, includ
ing 11 points in the first six minutes.
Stanford 87, St. Mary's 75
Three days later Bratz led the way
again as he canned 18 points as the Cards
won their fifth in a row with an 87-75
victory over St. Mary's. Carter added 16
for the Cards. Stanford ran off 14 straight
points to break open a 44-42 Card lead.
Arizona 90, Stanford 82
During the past few years the Cards
had traveled to the Midwest for a tour
nament. This year, though, a tournament
slot did not materialize and Dißiaso
landed a pair of games on the road one

night apart. During the Pacific-8 season
the Cards will twice face a similar situa
tion and Dißiaso wanted his team to get
accustomed to such scheduling.
So last Monday the Cards abandoned
the friendly confines of Maples for the
hostile environment of Fred Snowden's
high-ranked Arizona Wildcats.
The once-defeated Wildcats held off
Stanford, 90-82. Senior forward Herman
"The Cerm" Harris netted 24 and Hob
Elliot scored 21 for Arizona. Bratz con
tinued his scoring spree with 24 points.
Stanford 83, Colorado St. 76
Wednesday night the Cards unpacked
their traveling bags in Fort Collins to take
on Colorado State's Rams. Stanford
finished its Mountain Time Zone swing
with an 83-76 victory over the Rams.
Dißiaso has brought 'his team a long
way from their ignominious opener
against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo five
weeks ago.
This weekend the Cards will have to
call upon everything they have de
veloped over the past nine games when
they venture to the snow and evergreens
of Washington.
