# Cabinet choices' careers mirror Carter's
## 
### Marc Strassman News Analysis 
Jimmy Carter has already kept two of
his promises: to name his Cabinet be
fore Christmas, and to meet with them
as a group before the New Year at his
St. Simon's Island retreat off the Geor
gia coast.
Since the selection of these people
has been, until now, the only policy
decision made by the president-elect,
and because these people will have
important policy-making respon
sibilities in his administration,
analysis of Carter's choices and the
process by which they were selected
may yield some insights into the shape
of Carter's presidency.
Several major themes are repeated in
the career histories of Carter's choices.
Many of his appointees have risen a
long way from their original status.
Michael Blumenthal, secretary of

the treasury-designate, arrived in
America as a refugee from Germany in
1947 with $60 in his pocket, worked
his way through UC-Berkeley as a card
dealer in Reno, and is leaving a
$500,000 a year position as chief
executive officer of Bendix to take the
Cabinet job.
Patricia Roberts Harris, designated
to be secretary of housing and urban
development, is the daughter of a
Pullman porter. Ray Marshall, secret
ary of labor-designate, spent several
years in an orphanage. Bert Lance, the
multi-millionaire Atlanta banker
slated to be director of the Office of
Management and Budget, started out
as a teller in the bank he now owns.
These people and their careers mir
ror Carter's own progression up from
the soil of southern Georgia to the
highest elective office in the United
States. Their ascent is seemingly at

tributable to native intelligence, ex
tremely hard work and a great deal of
ambition, characteristics that Carter
has in abundance himself and appa
rently likes to see in others.
Compassionate cabinet
Carter promised an administration
that was compassionate, not just com
petent. The records of a number of his
choices that would seem to argue that
he has chosen people who share this
commitment.
Blumenthal, while greatly increas
ing the profits of the Bendix corpora
tion, has also emphasized affirmative
action for women and minorities. He
has been criticized by his fellow cor
porate executives for his activities on
behalf of the establishment of a corpo
rate code of ethics.
Secretary of Labor-designate Mar

shall has extensively researched the
employment situation of the disadvan
taged. Juanita Kreps, Carter's choice
for secretary of commerce, has written
much about the employment status of
women.
Andrew Young, designated to rep
resent the United States at the Un
ited Nations, was a close associate of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and
has frequently demonstrated his
abilities to conciliate opposing fac
tions.
Another side
There is another side to the cabinet,
however. James Schlesinger, ap
pointed by Carter to advise him on
energy matters and to assume direc
tion of the still-to-be established De
partment of Energy, was fired by Pres
ident Gerald Ford for arguing too veh
emently for a harder line against the
Soviets. Schlesinger has in the past
advocated a concept of "limited nuc
lear war," which some critics have
claimed is a contradiction in terms.
Harold Brown, a child prodigy in
physics (he graduated from Columbia
at 17) was secretary of the Air Force
during some of the most intensive ae
rial bombardments of the Vietnam
conflict.
Trilateral Commission
A significant proportion of Carter's
cabinet choices are also members of
the Trilateral Commission (as is Carter
himself). This panel was established
by David Rockefeller in 1972 to con
sider and deal with problems of
economic coordination among the
three-sided alliance of the United
States, Japan and Western Europe.
Blumenthal and Vance are mem
bers. Zbigniew Brzezinski, chosen by
Carter to be his national security ad

viser, has been administrative director
of the forum since its founding.
David Packard, head of Hewlett-
Packard, a Stanford alumnus and a
member of the commission, said re
cently that he does not think there is
anything improper or conspiratorial in
Carter's choosing so many of his
Cabinet from this group.
Packard said that the influence of
Rockefeller, chairman of the Chase
Manhattan bank and brother of the in
cumbent vice president, is not domin
ant on the commission which he
created.
Carter has answered criticism about
his attorney general-designate. Griffin
Bell, by saying Bell will be a "great"
attorney general. Bell has said that he
will resign from the exclusionary so
cial clubs in Atlanta to which he be
longs.
Bell is a former federal judge and a
partner in an Atlanta law firm.

Carter apparently heeded suggest
ions to include women and blacks in
the Cabinet only to the extent of three
appointments: Juanita Kreps, a wo
man; Andrew Young, a black; and Pat
ricia Harris, a black woman.
Southerners are well-represented in
the new cabinet, testimony to Carter's
roots and the overwhelming electoral
support he received from that region.
Bell, Lance, Young, Marshall and
Kreps are from the South.
According to Carter, Walter Mon
dale, vice president-elect, will serve
him as his most important adviser, will
have offices in the White House, and
will be his "chief staff person."

as a group before the New Year at his
St. Simon's Island retreat off the Geor
gia coast.
Since the selection of these people
has been, until now, the only policy
decision made by the president-elect,
and because these people will have
important policy-making respon
sibilities in his administration,
analysis of Carter's choices and the
process by which they were selected
may yield some insights into the shape
of Carter's presidency.
Several major themes are repeated in
the career histories of Carter's choices.
Many of his appointees have risen a
long way from their original status.
Michael Blumenthal, secretary of

the treasury-designate, arrived in
America as a refugee from Germany in
1947 with $60 in his pocket, worked
his way through UC-Berkeley as a card
dealer in Reno, and is leaving a
$500,000 a year position as chief
executive officer of Bendix to take the
Cabinet job.
Patricia Roberts Harris, designated
to be secretary of housing and urban
development, is the daughter of a
Pullman porter. Ray Marshall, secret
ary of labor-designate, spent several
years in an orphanage. Bert Lance, the
multi-millionaire Atlanta banker
slated to be director of the Office of
Management and Budget, started out
as a teller in the bank he now owns.
These people and their careers mir
ror Carter's own progression up from
the soil of southern Georgia to the
highest elective office in the United
States. Their ascent is seemingly at

tributable to native intelligence, ex
tremely hard work and a great deal of
ambition, characteristics that Carter
has in abundance himself and appa
rently likes to see in others.
Compassionate cabinet
Carter promised an administration
that was compassionate, not just com
petent. The records of a number of his
choices that would seem to argue that
he has chosen people who share this
commitment.
Blumenthal, while greatly increas
ing the profits of the Bendix corpora
tion, has also emphasized affirmative
action for women and minorities. He
has been criticized by his fellow cor
porate executives for his activities on
behalf of the establishment of a corpo
rate code of ethics.
Secretary of Labor-designate Mar

shall has extensively researched the
employment situation of the disadvan
taged. Juanita Kreps, Carter's choice
for secretary of commerce, has written
much about the employment status of
women.
Andrew Young, designated to rep
resent the United States at the Un
ited Nations, was a close associate of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and
has frequently demonstrated his
abilities to conciliate opposing fac
tions.
Another side
There is another side to the cabinet,
however. James Schlesinger, ap
pointed by Carter to advise him on
energy matters and to assume direc
tion of the still-to-be established De
partment of Energy, was fired by Pres
ident Gerald Ford for arguing too veh
emently for a harder line against the
Soviets. Schlesinger has in the past
advocated a concept of "limited nuc
lear war," which some critics have
claimed is a contradiction in terms.
Harold Brown, a child prodigy in
physics (he graduated from Columbia
at 17) was secretary of the Air Force
during some of the most intensive ae
rial bombardments of the Vietnam
conflict.
Trilateral Commission
A significant proportion of Carter's
cabinet choices are also members of
the Trilateral Commission (as is Carter
himself). This panel was established
by David Rockefeller in 1972 to con
sider and deal with problems of
economic coordination among the
three-sided alliance of the United
States, Japan and Western Europe.
Blumenthal and Vance are mem
bers. Zbigniew Brzezinski, chosen by
Carter to be his national security ad

viser, has been administrative director
of the forum since its founding.
David Packard, head of Hewlett-
Packard, a Stanford alumnus and a
member of the commission, said re
cently that he does not think there is
anything improper or conspiratorial in
Carter's choosing so many of his
Cabinet from this group.
Packard said that the influence of
Rockefeller, chairman of the Chase
Manhattan bank and brother of the in
cumbent vice president, is not domin
ant on the commission which he
created.
Carter has answered criticism about
his attorney general-designate. Griffin
Bell, by saying Bell will be a "great"
attorney general. Bell has said that he
will resign from the exclusionary so
cial clubs in Atlanta to which he be
longs.
Bell is a former federal judge and a
partner in an Atlanta law firm.

Carter apparently heeded suggest
ions to include women and blacks in
the Cabinet only to the extent of three
appointments: Juanita Kreps, a wo
man; Andrew Young, a black; and Pat
ricia Harris, a black woman.
Southerners are well-represented in
the new cabinet, testimony to Carter's
roots and the overwhelming electoral
support he received from that region.
Bell, Lance, Young, Marshall and
Kreps are from the South.
According to Carter, Walter Mon
dale, vice president-elect, will serve
him as his most important adviser, will
have offices in the White House, and
will be his "chief staff person."
Jimmy Carter has already kept two of
his promises: to name his Cabinet be
fore Christmas, and to meet with them
as a group before the New Year at his
St. Simon's Island retreat off the Geor
gia coast.

has been, until now, the only policy
decision made by the president-elect,
and because these people will have
important policy-making respon
sibilities in his administration,
analysis of Carter's choices and the
process by which they were selected
may yield some insights into the shape
of Carter's presidency.
Several major themes are repeated in
the career histories of Carter's choices.
Many of his appointees have risen a
long way from their original status.
Michael Blumenthal, secretary of

the treasury-designate, arrived in
America as a refugee from Germany in
1947 with $60 in his pocket, worked
his way through UC-Berkeley as a card
dealer in Reno, and is leaving a
$500,000 a year position as chief
executive officer of Bendix to take the
Cabinet job.
Patricia Roberts Harris, designated
to be secretary of housing and urban
development, is the daughter of a
Pullman porter. Ray Marshall, secret
ary of labor-designate, spent several
years in an orphanage. Bert Lance, the
multi-millionaire Atlanta banker
slated to be director of the Office of
Management and Budget, started out
as a teller in the bank he now owns.
These people and their careers mir
ror Carter's own progression up from
the soil of southern Georgia to the
highest elective office in the United
States. Their ascent is seemingly at

tributable to native intelligence, ex
tremely hard work and a great deal of
ambition, characteristics that Carter
has in abundance himself and appa
rently likes to see in others.
Compassionate cabinet
Carter promised an administration
that was compassionate, not just com
petent. The records of a number of his
choices that would seem to argue that
he has chosen people who share this
commitment.
Blumenthal, while greatly increas
ing the profits of the Bendix corpora
tion, has also emphasized affirmative
action for women and minorities. He
has been criticized by his fellow cor
porate executives for his activities on
behalf of the establishment of a corpo
rate code of ethics.
Secretary of Labor-designate Mar

shall has extensively researched the
employment situation of the disadvan
taged. Juanita Kreps, Carter's choice
for secretary of commerce, has written
much about the employment status of
women.
Andrew Young, designated to rep
resent the United States at the Un
ited Nations, was a close associate of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and
has frequently demonstrated his
abilities to conciliate opposing fac
tions.
Another side
There is another side to the cabinet,
however. James Schlesinger, ap
pointed by Carter to advise him on
energy matters and to assume direc
tion of the still-to-be established De
partment of Energy, was fired by Pres
ident Gerald Ford for arguing too veh
emently for a harder line against the
Soviets. Schlesinger has in the past
advocated a concept of "limited nuc
lear war," which some critics have
claimed is a contradiction in terms.
Harold Brown, a child prodigy in
physics (he graduated from Columbia
at 17) was secretary of the Air Force
during some of the most intensive ae
rial bombardments of the Vietnam
conflict.
Trilateral Commission
A significant proportion of Carter's
cabinet choices are also members of
the Trilateral Commission (as is Carter
himself). This panel was established
by David Rockefeller in 1972 to con
sider and deal with problems of
economic coordination among the
three-sided alliance of the United
States, Japan and Western Europe.
Blumenthal and Vance are mem
bers. Zbigniew Brzezinski, chosen by
Carter to be his national security ad

viser, has been administrative director
of the forum since its founding.
David Packard, head of Hewlett-
Packard, a Stanford alumnus and a
member of the commission, said re
cently that he does not think there is
anything improper or conspiratorial in
Carter's choosing so many of his
Cabinet from this group.
Packard said that the influence of
Rockefeller, chairman of the Chase
Manhattan bank and brother of the in
cumbent vice president, is not domin
ant on the commission which he
created.
Carter has answered criticism about
his attorney general-designate. Griffin
Bell, by saying Bell will be a "great"
attorney general. Bell has said that he
will resign from the exclusionary so
cial clubs in Atlanta to which he be
longs.
Bell is a former federal judge and a
partner in an Atlanta law firm.

Carter apparently heeded suggest
ions to include women and blacks in
the Cabinet only to the extent of three
appointments: Juanita Kreps, a wo
man; Andrew Young, a black; and Pat
ricia Harris, a black woman.
Southerners are well-represented in
the new cabinet, testimony to Carter's
roots and the overwhelming electoral
support he received from that region.
Bell, Lance, Young, Marshall and
Kreps are from the South.
According to Carter, Walter Mon
dale, vice president-elect, will serve
him as his most important adviser, will
have offices in the White House, and
will be his "chief staff person."
Jimmy Carter has already kept two of
his promises: to name his Cabinet be
fore Christmas, and to meet with them
as a group before the New Year at his
St. Simon's Island retreat off the Geor
gia coast.
Since the selection of these people
has been, until now, the only policy
decision made by the president-elect,
and because these people will have
important policy-making respon
sibilities in his administration,
