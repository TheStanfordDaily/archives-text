ditions in which thousands of Puerto Ricans are still
forced to live."

Carter pledge creates policy conflict
Washington — Jimmy Carter's pledge to add a moral
dimension to U.S. foreign policy has raised questions
about the future of American relations with countries that
repress political dissent.
The State Department says six nations for which $3.7
billion in U.S. military assistance and sales have been

earmarked this fiscal year have violated human rights. But
it recommends that aid to the countries be continued.
Argentina, Haiti, Indonesia, Iran, Peru and the Philip
pines were the countries dealt with in the report prepared
at the request of the House International Relations Com
mittee and released Saturday by the panel.
A committee spokesman said the committee singled out
the six countries because there had been widespread re
ports of human rights violations in all of tiiem.
British role in Rhodesia rejected
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Prime Minister lan Smith has
flatly rejected the idea of a direct British role in the transi
tion to black majority rule in Rhodesia, sources said yes

man of the Geneva conference on the future of this former
British colony. The conference is deadlocked over the

ing decisions on amnesty and gasoline prices, in his last

Carter pledge creates policy conflict

dimension to U.S. foreign policy has raised questions
about the future of American relations with countries that
repress political dissent.

billion in U.S. military assistance and sales have been

earmarked this fiscal year have violated human rights. But
it recommends that aid to the countries be continued.
Argentina, Haiti, Indonesia, Iran, Peru and the Philip
pines were the countries dealt with in the report prepared
at the request of the House International Relations Com
mittee and released Saturday by the panel.
A committee spokesman said the committee singled out
the six countries because there had been widespread re
ports of human rights violations in all of tiiem.
