Trustee Warren Christopher is
slated to be named deputy secretary of
state today by President-elect Jimmy
Carter and Secretary of State-designate
Cyrus Vance, according to Christ
opher's wife.
Christopher, a prominent Los
Angeles lawyer, has been a trustee
since July 1972.
Christopher was en route to
Washington last night, but his wife
confirmed that he had been offered the
job. Marie Christopher said that the
appointment was originally to be offi
cially announced last Friday, but the
announcement was delayed.
The New York Times Service re
ported that Vance had personally cho
sen Christopher for the No. 2 State De
partment position.
'Not a surprise'
President Richard Lyman said that
the appointment was "not a total sur
prise." Lyman called the trustee a
"very able man with a great deal of
Washington experience."
Trustee Ernest Arbuckle added,
"He's a very competent individual. He
is very thoughtful, incisive. He's a
good straight thinker with experience.
1 guess that's why we elected him a
trustee."
Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig said, "I think it's a
fine appointment. He's a first class
lawyer, active in politics and has had a
lot of experience in government."
Yet Christopher's wife said he was a
bit surprised at the offer of a job in the
State Department because "he hasn't
done much at the State Department or
in foreign affairs."

May resign as trustee
She also speculated that the appoin
tee may well resign his university pos
ition. "If he does resign, we'll certainly
miss him," Lyman said.
Christopher has been a partner of the
Los Angeles law firm of O'Melveny &
Myers since 1958. President Lyndon
Johnson appointed him as deputy at
torney general under Attorney General
Ramsey Clark in 1967.
He has been president of the Califor
nia Coordinating Council for Higher
Education, a law clerk for Supreme
Court Justice William O. Douglas, vice
president of the Section on Individual
Rights and Responsibilities of the
American Bar Association, chairman
of the American Bar Association
Judiciary Committee, and president of
the Los Angeles County Bar Associa
tion.
Before his formal appointment to the
Board of Trustees, he was an adviser to
the board and was retained by the uni
versity for such important legal duties
as severing of university ties with the
Stanford Research Institute.
Christopher received his B.S. from
USC and later was awarded a law de
gree from Stanford. He was formerly a
member of the Board of Visitors of the
Law School and a trustee of Occiden
tal College.
