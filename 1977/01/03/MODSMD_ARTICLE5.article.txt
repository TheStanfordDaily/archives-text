# Flu program halt threatens other inoculation programs
## 
### Marc Strassman 
The demise of the national swine flu inoculation prog
ram may lead to a decline in the number of participants in
other inoculation programs for other diseases, according
to Mary Clark, director of preventive medicine for Santa
Clara County.
The swine flu program was suspended after the Center
for Disease Control in Atlanta, Ga., decided there was a
significant correlation between vaccination and the
paralyzing Guillain-Barre syndrome.
No health official would offer a prediction about the
likelihood of an epidemic of Victoria flu, but none would
not rule out that possibility, now that inoculation against
this strain of influenza has been called off in conjunction
with the termination of the swine flu program.
There is "no way" people can be inoculated now against
Victoria flu, according to Mike White, assistant director of
the Santa Clara County Swine Flu Inoculation Program
because, he said, '"all the Victoria vaccine is in bivalent
form with the swine flu vaccine." He said that the county
has and is going to continue to hold on to 200,000 mono
valent and bivalent doses of the anti-swine flu vaccine.
High-risk people
Clark said that "most of the high-risk people who
wanted it (the inoculation) have it." She said that 45,000-
50,000 Santa Clara County residents with a high risk of
complications from the flu were vaccinated against it be
fore the program was suspended.
"This is double the usual number of people receiving
influenza inoculations," she added, saying that this figure
represented about one-third of the 125,000-130,000 indi
viduals that the program had originally targeted to receive
the shots.
Polio, measles, diptheria, tetanus, whooping cough and
mumps are other diseases against which inoculation is
used which Clark said she is "afraid" may increase be

cause of the reluctance to be vaccinated created by the
termination of the swine flu program.
Unprotected babies
"We get a new crop of (unprotected) babies every year,"
said Clark. Although every child must present proof of
polio inoculation before entering school, there is no way
of assuring that they would be protected against polio
during their pre-school years, she added.
Among the problems associated with the swine flu
program last year was the refusal of the drug's manufac
turers to produce the drug unless they were insured
against liability for possible negative reactions. Congress
eventually gave into their demands, and agreed that the
federal government would assume the initial responsibil
ity for defending against suits for damages alleged to have
been caused by the swine flu vaccine.
However, as of last week, no suits had been filed within
the San Francisco District Court, including those deriving
from damages caused by the Guillain-Barre paralytic syn
drome, according to James Bruen, chief of the civil divi
sion of the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco.
Pauling's view
Linus Pauling, emeritus professor of chemistry here, a
double-Nobel laureate (in chemistry and peace) and di
rector of the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and
Medicine in Menlo Park, has said from the beginninp that
he thought the swine-flu program was unnecessary. In a
telephone interview last week from his ranch in Big Sur,
he said that suspendingthe swineflu inoculation program
in the wake of the Guillain-Barre connection was "a sensi
ble thing."
Thomas Merigan, professor of medicine and head of the
division of infectious diseases at the Medical Center, said
that it is "very premature" to speak of "blame" in connec
tion with the national program.

"We get a new crop of (unprotected) babies every year,"
said Clark. Although every child must present proof of
polio inoculation before entering school, there is no way
of assuring that they would be protected against polio
during their pre-school years, she added.
Among the problems associated with the swine flu
program last year was the refusal of the drug's manufac
turers to produce the drug unless they were insured
against liability for possible negative reactions. Congress
eventually gave into their demands, and agreed that the
federal government would assume the initial responsibil
ity for defending against suits for damages alleged to have
been caused by the swine flu vaccine.
However, as of last week, no suits had been filed within
the San Francisco District Court, including those deriving
from damages caused by the Guillain-Barre paralytic syn
drome, according to James Bruen, chief of the civil divi
sion of the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco.
Pauling's view
Linus Pauling, emeritus professor of chemistry here, a
double-Nobel laureate (in chemistry and peace) and di
rector of the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and
Medicine in Menlo Park, has said from the beginninp that
he thought the swine-flu program was unnecessary. In a
telephone interview last week from his ranch in Big Sur,
he said that suspendingthe swineflu inoculation program
in the wake of the Guillain-Barre connection was "a sensi
ble thing."
Thomas Merigan, professor of medicine and head of the
division of infectious diseases at the Medical Center, said
that it is "very premature" to speak of "blame" in connec
tion with the national program.

health officials fear. Programs to halt polio, measles,
diptheria, whooping cough, mumps and Victoria flu
may be threatened.
The demise of the national swine flu inoculation prog
ram may lead to a decline in the number of participants in
other inoculation programs for other diseases, according
to Mary Clark, director of preventive medicine for Santa
Clara County.
The swine flu program was suspended after the Center
for Disease Control in Atlanta, Ga., decided there was a
significant correlation between vaccination and the
paralyzing Guillain-Barre syndrome.
No health official would offer a prediction about the
likelihood of an epidemic of Victoria flu, but none would
not rule out that possibility, now that inoculation against
this strain of influenza has been called off in conjunction
with the termination of the swine flu program.
There is "no way" people can be inoculated now against
Victoria flu, according to Mike White, assistant director of
the Santa Clara County Swine Flu Inoculation Program
because, he said, '"all the Victoria vaccine is in bivalent
form with the swine flu vaccine." He said that the county
has and is going to continue to hold on to 200,000 mono
valent and bivalent doses of the anti-swine flu vaccine.
High-risk people
Clark said that "most of the high-risk people who
wanted it (the inoculation) have it." She said that 45,000-
50,000 Santa Clara County residents with a high risk of
complications from the flu were vaccinated against it be
fore the program was suspended.
"This is double the usual number of people receiving
influenza inoculations," she added, saying that this figure
represented about one-third of the 125,000-130,000 indi
viduals that the program had originally targeted to receive
the shots.
Polio, measles, diptheria, tetanus, whooping cough and
mumps are other diseases against which inoculation is
used which Clark said she is "afraid" may increase be

cause of the reluctance to be vaccinated created by the
termination of the swine flu program.
Unprotected babies

said Clark. Although every child must present proof of
