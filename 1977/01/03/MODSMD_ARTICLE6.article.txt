## Opinions Affirmative action justified 
### 
Stephen Carter

If the argument against preferential
admissions for members of minority
groups were as easy as such commen
tators as R. Hunter Summers (Daily,
Nov. 17) would have us believe, few of
us, white or black, would wastetimein
a futile defense of such practices.
Fortunately for members of minority
groups — and this is a sad commentary
on the society at large — there is ample
justification for such programs.
There are two primary reasons for
considering t he race of an applicant for
professional school: first, it can be de
monstrated that more "traditional"
admissions criteria have little if any
validity for members of minority
groups; and second, for public policy
reasons discussed later.
Prior to the adoption of special ad
missions procedures —admittedly in
cluding some quotas — minority
applicants to professional schools
were not accepted at rates approaching
those of white students. One reason for
this was heavy emphasis on such
"criteria" as scores on the LSAT,
where the median score for minority
groups is over 100 points lower than
for whites.
Cultural bias
One may argue until doomsday
about whether the LSAT and its
cousins are culturally biased, but the
Educational Testing Service's own
studies have shown first that the score
on the LSAT is highly correlated with
socio-economic status, and second,
that its correlation with even law
school performance is relatively low
— and lower for minority group mem
bers than for whites. (The LSAT is
often called "one of the best" predic
tors available. This is not the same as
saying it is a good one — and is not
even true.)
No evidence has ever been pre
sented to demonstrate that the LSAT
has any relation whatever to ability to
practice law. One may ask: why
bother?
The answer, as any lawyer knows, is
that the Supreme Court of the United
States in 1971, in the case of Griggs vs.
Duke Power Co., held that no one may
judge applicants for a job primarily on
the basis of an examination which has
not been shown to be job-related, and

which has the practical effect — in
tended or not —of excluding minority
applicants. And as a practical matter, it
would not be possible to practice law
without taking the LSAT.
Legalese
But such an exercise in legalese
could hardly convince the lay person.
There are, however, public policy
considerations. In the professions —
especially medicine and law, which
are, lamentably, among the most
needed — the ratio of practitioners to
the group is much higher among
whites than among minorities.
As a practical matter, minority
physicians, for example, have shown
much grater likelihood of working for
longer periods of time in areas where
minorities are highly concentrated.
The need is pressing, and it is hard to
debate over the Constitution when
chicano and black babies have such
terribly high mortality rates in Califor
nia alone.
This sort of difficulty does not con
cern those who consider the Constitu
tion a static document, unamenable to
change, or who look to their elected
representatives to solve all societal
ills. Sadly, members of minority
groups have historically been some
what safer in the arms of the federal
courts than under the protective um
brella of the Congress.
No pride?
There were a few troubling items in
Summers' column, which are common
to diatribes against affirmative action.
There is a hint that because members
of minority groups might not have
been admitted to schools without the
preferential admissions programs, we
have nothing to point to with pride.
In fact, we do not have, as a group,
the same sorts of qualifications as do
those admitted under more traditional
criteria. Does this mean we are some
how "less" qualified? At least at Yale
Law School, that has not been the ex
perience of minorities — grades and
achievements are distributed maong
them at about the same rate as among
members of the dominant group.
Moreover, to say that such decisions
as Bukke rest on the same foundations
as the school desegregation cases is an
absurdity. In Brown v. Board of Educa-

tion and its cousins, a state's purpose
ful discrimination was being used as
an instrument of oppression. The Sup
reme Court has never adopted Justice
Harlan's suggesiton to the effect that
the Constitution is "color blind." If it
had, the Court could never have up
held racially based school busing
plans to eliminate school segregation
or employment quotas to eliminate
past discrimination. But it has upheld
both.
Finally, it would take far more than a
few columns of newsprint to debate
the merits of Summers' interpretation
of the Equal Protection Clause. Suffice
to say: If we abandoned minority pre
ferences, and went back to the "good
old" system, we would have an admis
sions procedure that systematically
excluded members of minority groups
without any showing that they were in
any real sense unqualified.
But unless we are prepared to accept
the theory that minorities are intrinsi
cally inferior in aptitude to practice
law or medicine, such a system would
surely violate the same guarantee of
equal protection of the laws.

missions procedures —admittedly in
cluding some quotas — minority
applicants to professional schools
were not accepted at rates approaching
those of white students. One reason for
this was heavy emphasis on such
"criteria" as scores on the LSAT,
where the median score for minority
groups is over 100 points lower than
for whites.
Cultural bias
One may argue until doomsday
about whether the LSAT and its
cousins are culturally biased, but the
Educational Testing Service's own
studies have shown first that the score
on the LSAT is highly correlated with
socio-economic status, and second,
that its correlation with even law
school performance is relatively low
— and lower for minority group mem
bers than for whites. (The LSAT is
often called "one of the best" predic
tors available. This is not the same as
saying it is a good one — and is not
even true.)
No evidence has ever been pre
sented to demonstrate that the LSAT
has any relation whatever to ability to
practice law. One may ask: why
bother?
The answer, as any lawyer knows, is
that the Supreme Court of the United
States in 1971, in the case of Griggs vs.
Duke Power Co., held that no one may
judge applicants for a job primarily on
the basis of an examination which has
not been shown to be job-related, and

which has the practical effect — in
tended or not —of excluding minority
applicants. And as a practical matter, it
would not be possible to practice law
without taking the LSAT.
Legalese
But such an exercise in legalese
could hardly convince the lay person.
There are, however, public policy
considerations. In the professions —
especially medicine and law, which
are, lamentably, among the most
needed — the ratio of practitioners to
the group is much higher among
whites than among minorities.
As a practical matter, minority
physicians, for example, have shown
much grater likelihood of working for
longer periods of time in areas where
minorities are highly concentrated.
The need is pressing, and it is hard to
debate over the Constitution when
chicano and black babies have such
terribly high mortality rates in Califor
nia alone.
This sort of difficulty does not con
cern those who consider the Constitu
tion a static document, unamenable to
change, or who look to their elected
representatives to solve all societal
ills. Sadly, members of minority
groups have historically been some
what safer in the arms of the federal
courts than under the protective um
brella of the Congress.
No pride?
There were a few troubling items in
Summers' column, which are common
to diatribes against affirmative action.
There is a hint that because members
of minority groups might not have
been admitted to schools without the
preferential admissions programs, we
have nothing to point to with pride.
In fact, we do not have, as a group,
the same sorts of qualifications as do
those admitted under more traditional
criteria. Does this mean we are some
how "less" qualified? At least at Yale
Law School, that has not been the ex
perience of minorities — grades and
achievements are distributed maong
them at about the same rate as among
members of the dominant group.
Moreover, to say that such decisions
as Bukke rest on the same foundations
as the school desegregation cases is an
absurdity. In Brown v. Board of Educa-

tion and its cousins, a state's purpose
ful discrimination was being used as
an instrument of oppression. The Sup
reme Court has never adopted Justice
Harlan's suggesiton to the effect that
the Constitution is "color blind." If it
had, the Court could never have up
held racially based school busing
plans to eliminate school segregation
or employment quotas to eliminate
past discrimination. But it has upheld
both.
Finally, it would take far more than a
few columns of newsprint to debate
the merits of Summers' interpretation
of the Equal Protection Clause. Suffice
to say: If we abandoned minority pre
ferences, and went back to the "good
old" system, we would have an admis
sions procedure that systematically
excluded members of minority groups
without any showing that they were in
any real sense unqualified.
But unless we are prepared to accept
the theory that minorities are intrinsi
cally inferior in aptitude to practice
law or medicine, such a system would
surely violate the same guarantee of
equal protection of the laws.

If the argument against preferential
admissions for members of minority
groups were as easy as such commen
tators as R. Hunter Summers (Daily,
Nov. 17) would have us believe, few of
us, white or black, would wastetimein
a futile defense of such practices.
Fortunately for members of minority
groups — and this is a sad commentary
on the society at large — there is ample
justification for such programs.
There are two primary reasons for
considering t he race of an applicant for
professional school: first, it can be de
monstrated that more "traditional"
admissions criteria have little if any
validity for members of minority
groups; and second, for public policy
reasons discussed later.

often called "one of the best" predic
tors available. This is not the same as
saying it is a good one — and is not
even true.)
No evidence has ever been pre
sented to demonstrate that the LSAT
has any relation whatever to ability to
practice law. One may ask: why
bother?
The answer, as any lawyer knows, is
that the Supreme Court of the United
States in 1971, in the case of Griggs vs.
Duke Power Co., held that no one may
judge applicants for a job primarily on
the basis of an examination which has
not been shown to be job-related, and

which has the practical effect — in
tended or not —of excluding minority
applicants. And as a practical matter, it
would not be possible to practice law
without taking the LSAT.
Legalese
But such an exercise in legalese
could hardly convince the lay person.
There are, however, public policy
considerations. In the professions —
especially medicine and law, which
are, lamentably, among the most
needed — the ratio of practitioners to
the group is much higher among
whites than among minorities.
As a practical matter, minority
physicians, for example, have shown
much grater likelihood of working for
longer periods of time in areas where
minorities are highly concentrated.
The need is pressing, and it is hard to
debate over the Constitution when
chicano and black babies have such
terribly high mortality rates in Califor
nia alone.
This sort of difficulty does not con
cern those who consider the Constitu
tion a static document, unamenable to
change, or who look to their elected
representatives to solve all societal
ills. Sadly, members of minority
groups have historically been some
what safer in the arms of the federal
courts than under the protective um
brella of the Congress.
No pride?
There were a few troubling items in
Summers' column, which are common
to diatribes against affirmative action.
There is a hint that because members
of minority groups might not have
been admitted to schools without the
preferential admissions programs, we
have nothing to point to with pride.
In fact, we do not have, as a group,
the same sorts of qualifications as do
those admitted under more traditional
criteria. Does this mean we are some
how "less" qualified? At least at Yale
Law School, that has not been the ex
perience of minorities — grades and
achievements are distributed maong
them at about the same rate as among
members of the dominant group.
Moreover, to say that such decisions
as Bukke rest on the same foundations
as the school desegregation cases is an
absurdity. In Brown v. Board of Educa-

tion and its cousins, a state's purpose
ful discrimination was being used as
an instrument of oppression. The Sup
reme Court has never adopted Justice
Harlan's suggesiton to the effect that
the Constitution is "color blind." If it
had, the Court could never have up
held racially based school busing
plans to eliminate school segregation
or employment quotas to eliminate
past discrimination. But it has upheld
both.
Finally, it would take far more than a
few columns of newsprint to debate
the merits of Summers' interpretation
of the Equal Protection Clause. Suffice
to say: If we abandoned minority pre
ferences, and went back to the "good
old" system, we would have an admis
sions procedure that systematically
excluded members of minority groups
without any showing that they were in
any real sense unqualified.
But unless we are prepared to accept
the theory that minorities are intrinsi
cally inferior in aptitude to practice
law or medicine, such a system would
surely violate the same guarantee of
equal protection of the laws.

If the argument against preferential
admissions for members of minority
groups were as easy as such commen
tators as R. Hunter Summers (Daily,
Nov. 17) would have us believe, few of
us, white or black, would wastetimein
a futile defense of such practices.
Fortunately for members of minority
groups — and this is a sad commentary
on the society at large — there is ample
justification for such programs.
There are two primary reasons for
considering t he race of an applicant for
professional school: first, it can be de
monstrated that more "traditional"
admissions criteria have little if any
validity for members of minority
groups; and second, for public policy
reasons discussed later.
Prior to the adoption of special ad
missions procedures —admittedly in
cluding some quotas — minority
applicants to professional schools
were not accepted at rates approaching
those of white students. One reason for
this was heavy emphasis on such
"criteria" as scores on the LSAT,
where the median score for minority
groups is over 100 points lower than
for whites.
Cultural bias
One may argue until doomsday
about whether the LSAT and its
cousins are culturally biased, but the
Educational Testing Service's own
studies have shown first that the score
on the LSAT is highly correlated with
socio-economic status, and second,
that its correlation with even law
school performance is relatively low
— and lower for minority group mem
bers than for whites. (The LSAT is
often called "one of the best" predic
tors available. This is not the same as
saying it is a good one — and is not
even true.)
