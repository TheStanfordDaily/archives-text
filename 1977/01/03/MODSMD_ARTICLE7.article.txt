# Letters: sexist ad, biology

### 
Misled stupidities
On Tuesday, Nov. 30, the Daily car
ried a rather offensive and sexist ad
vertisement on page three for a so
called "humor" magazine by women,
called "Titters." The MacMillan pub
lishing company is seeking to make a
profit off the misled stupidities of such
anti-feminist women as Phyllis Diller
and Candice Bergen.
They seek to do so directly at the
expense of women in the form of sex
ual objectification — the magazine
title is splayed across a picture of a
woman's breasts. Furthermore, im
plicit in the ad's copy is the notion that
women who object to such partial rep
resentations of themselves have no
sense of humor.
Sexist exploitation of women will
continue to make bucks for the male
dominated establishment as long as
such ads find a readership. I see no
reason why the Daily has to provide
such a readership for its few bucks.
This ad clearly violates the provisions
of the Daily's own stated advertise
ment policy in that it portrays a group

of people (women) in a stereotypic
negative light.
The Daily and the university com
munity in general should react to
sexism as strongly as it does to racism
and reject such advertisements in the
future.

Removing the heart
In response to a university require
ment to reduce expenditures, the Biol
ogy Department has cut at the heart of
the biology core by proposing to
eliminate one of two senior lecturer
positions. These lecturers administer
the large lecture courses of the core
(Biology 21, 22, 23 and 110) and are
solely responsible for the teaching ad
administration of the lab courses
(Biology 24Y, 24Z and 110 L).
They are the only biology staff
members directly involved in all as
pects of the core. Thus they provide
the link integrating the lecture classes
with each other and with the labs.
The obvious importance of the core

classes to the biology program cannot
be overstated. Yet, it is in these same
classes that the department proposes
to reduce its staff. The biology core is
required of all biology majors, who
form the largest single major program
in the university.
Already vhere is more work involved
than can be handled by two lecturers.
It is unrealistic to assume that one lec
turer would be able to fulfill
adequately the teaching obligation to
so large a number of students and over
as wide a range of. subjects as is co
vered by these courses.
The permanent elimination of one of
the core lecturer positions cannot
avoid damaging the quality of the
biology program. We hope that in
reaching their decision the Depart
ment Policy Committee and depart
ment chairman will give serious con
sideration to the impact of staff reor
ganization on the quality of under
graduate education.

Misled stupidities
On Tuesday, Nov. 30, the Daily car
ried a rather offensive and sexist ad
vertisement on page three for a so
called "humor" magazine by women,
called "Titters." The MacMillan pub
lishing company is seeking to make a
profit off the misled stupidities of such
anti-feminist women as Phyllis Diller
and Candice Bergen.
They seek to do so directly at the
expense of women in the form of sex
ual objectification — the magazine
title is splayed across a picture of a
woman's breasts. Furthermore, im
plicit in the ad's copy is the notion that
women who object to such partial rep
resentations of themselves have no
sense of humor.
Sexist exploitation of women will
continue to make bucks for the male
dominated establishment as long as
such ads find a readership. I see no
reason why the Daily has to provide
such a readership for its few bucks.
This ad clearly violates the provisions
of the Daily's own stated advertise
ment policy in that it portrays a group

of people (women) in a stereotypic
negative light.
The Daily and the university com
munity in general should react to
sexism as strongly as it does to racism
and reject such advertisements in the
future.

Removing the heart
In response to a university require
ment to reduce expenditures, the Biol
ogy Department has cut at the heart of
the biology core by proposing to
eliminate one of two senior lecturer
positions. These lecturers administer
the large lecture courses of the core
(Biology 21, 22, 23 and 110) and are
solely responsible for the teaching ad
administration of the lab courses
(Biology 24Y, 24Z and 110 L).
They are the only biology staff
members directly involved in all as
pects of the core. Thus they provide
the link integrating the lecture classes
with each other and with the labs.
The obvious importance of the core

classes to the biology program cannot
be overstated. Yet, it is in these same
classes that the department proposes
to reduce its staff. The biology core is
required of all biology majors, who
form the largest single major program
in the university.
Already vhere is more work involved
than can be handled by two lecturers.
It is unrealistic to assume that one lec
turer would be able to fulfill
adequately the teaching obligation to
so large a number of students and over
as wide a range of. subjects as is co
vered by these courses.
The permanent elimination of one of
the core lecturer positions cannot
avoid damaging the quality of the
biology program. We hope that in
reaching their decision the Depart
ment Policy Committee and depart
ment chairman will give serious con
sideration to the impact of staff reor
ganization on the quality of under
graduate education.
