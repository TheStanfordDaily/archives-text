# U.S. should pressure repressive regimes
## 
### 
Doug Bandow

Now that the repressive government
of Chile has yielded to public pressure
and released some of its political pris
oners, it is time to apply similar pres
sure to other authoritarian and totalita
rian regimes.
The Soviet Union should he of prim
ary concern. Its continuing policy of
world expansionism is most recently
highlighted by its support of the
Cuban adventurists in Angola. The
massive civil defense expenditures
and military build-up (twice that of the
United States when compared with
C.NP) can only further threaten world
stability. Their destruction of U.S.
satellites earlier this year (as reported
by Newsweek) makes this clear.
The Soviet regime's colonialist
policies toward Armenia, Ukraine,
Byelorussia,etni., continue, as does its
imperialist occupation of Estonia, Lat
via and Lithuania.
In addition, the Soviet regime con
tinues to oppress the Soviet people.
Religious persecution is rampant. For
example, Ceorge Vins, a Soviet Christ
ian. was recently arrested for "harm
ing the interests of Soviet citizens
under a pretext of carrying out religi
ous activity." And a recent

march, led by Andrei Sakharov, illus
trates the fact that Soviet dissidents are
still being shipped off to mental in
stitutions and labor camps.
Protests should also be directed
agianst the jingoistic regime of Fidel
Castro. Cuba's gross imperialism in
Angola is an insult to supporters of
freedom everywhere. Such blatant
suppression of the nationalistic aspira
tions of the Angolan people is rep
rehensible.
The continued mistreatment of
political prisoners (including execu
tions without trial) supports Prof.
Jorge Dominguez's study for the Har
vard Center for International Affairs,
which concluded that Cuba wat one of
the most repressive of 27 regimes
studied (only Albania was worse).
And the Organization of American
States' Human Rights Commission
found that political prisoners are sub
ject to "arbitrary procedures of ex
treme rigor which reveal a disregard
for human dignity."
The xenophobic bandits who rule
Cambodia have continued their irra
tional policies, which started with the
disastrous displacement of millions of
its citizens from the cities. The stream

of refugees into Thailand attest to
übiquitous liquidation and slaughter
of workers, and of arbitrary assign
ment to forced labor camps.
China, without civil liberties, is con
tinuing to occupy Tibet after its im
perialistic seizure over 15 years ago.
Recent developments have made a
mockery of China's title as a "people's
republic." The manipulation of the
Chinese people, and the political
machinations surrounding the politi
cal demise of the radicals exposes the
baseness of the Chinese leaders.
Poland has recently stepped up its
religious persecution. Recent dissi
dents have suffered severe repression,
and a number of protesters were re
cently killed in Radom and Warsaw
(they were upset over food increases of
30 to 100 per cent, in such an
"inflation-less" economy).
These are, of course, just a few of the
many repressive and totalitarian re
gimes. North Korea continues under
the despotic rule of Kim. His personal
ity cult is awesome, his police om
nipresent, and most recently, his de
puty premier met an "accidental
death" (clearing the way for the acces
sion of his son).

India's Indira Gandhi has learned
her lessons well from her Soviet be
nefactors — outlaw, jail and repress.
India's recent avaricious acquisition of
Sikkim was in character. Uganda suf
fers from Idi Amin's lunacy. Ethiopia
is seeking to destroy the nationalistic
aspirations of the Eritrean people. And
(formerly South) Vietnam's imported
northern rulers are unable to stop
thousands of people from fleeing in
river craft across 800 or more miles of
sea to Brunei, and elsewhere.
Attention should be focused on re
gimes such as these, which ignore
basic human rights. In addition,
Americans, and others, should vigor
ously protest the aid being to such na
tions — such as U.S. computer sales to
China, U.S. Export-Import Bank loans
to Poland, loans and technical trade to
the Soviet regime, etc. Such aid furth
ers the interests of the repressive, rul
ing classes, rather than those of the
oppressed workers!
I urge students to speak out on be
half of the victims of these regimes,
and to seek an end to our myopic and
unjust support of these same regimes.

Cuban adventurists in Angola. The
massive civil defense expenditures
and military build-up (twice that of the
United States when compared with
C.NP) can only further threaten world
stability. Their destruction of U.S.
satellites earlier this year (as reported
by Newsweek) makes this clear.
The Soviet regime's colonialist
policies toward Armenia, Ukraine,
Byelorussia,etni., continue, as does its
imperialist occupation of Estonia, Lat
via and Lithuania.
In addition, the Soviet regime con
tinues to oppress the Soviet people.
Religious persecution is rampant. For
example, Ceorge Vins, a Soviet Christ
ian. was recently arrested for "harm
ing the interests of Soviet citizens
under a pretext of carrying out religi
ous activity." And a recent

march, led by Andrei Sakharov, illus
trates the fact that Soviet dissidents are
still being shipped off to mental in
stitutions and labor camps.
Protests should also be directed
agianst the jingoistic regime of Fidel
Castro. Cuba's gross imperialism in
Angola is an insult to supporters of
freedom everywhere. Such blatant
suppression of the nationalistic aspira
tions of the Angolan people is rep
rehensible.
The continued mistreatment of
political prisoners (including execu
tions without trial) supports Prof.
Jorge Dominguez's study for the Har
vard Center for International Affairs,
which concluded that Cuba wat one of
the most repressive of 27 regimes
studied (only Albania was worse).
And the Organization of American
States' Human Rights Commission
found that political prisoners are sub
ject to "arbitrary procedures of ex
treme rigor which reveal a disregard
for human dignity."
The xenophobic bandits who rule
Cambodia have continued their irra
tional policies, which started with the
disastrous displacement of millions of
its citizens from the cities. The stream

of refugees into Thailand attest to
übiquitous liquidation and slaughter
of workers, and of arbitrary assign
ment to forced labor camps.
China, without civil liberties, is con
tinuing to occupy Tibet after its im
perialistic seizure over 15 years ago.
Recent developments have made a
mockery of China's title as a "people's
republic." The manipulation of the
Chinese people, and the political
machinations surrounding the politi
cal demise of the radicals exposes the
baseness of the Chinese leaders.
Poland has recently stepped up its
religious persecution. Recent dissi
dents have suffered severe repression,
and a number of protesters were re
cently killed in Radom and Warsaw
(they were upset over food increases of
30 to 100 per cent, in such an
"inflation-less" economy).
These are, of course, just a few of the
many repressive and totalitarian re
gimes. North Korea continues under
the despotic rule of Kim. His personal
ity cult is awesome, his police om
nipresent, and most recently, his de
puty premier met an "accidental
death" (clearing the way for the acces
sion of his son).

India's Indira Gandhi has learned
her lessons well from her Soviet be
nefactors — outlaw, jail and repress.
India's recent avaricious acquisition of
Sikkim was in character. Uganda suf
fers from Idi Amin's lunacy. Ethiopia
is seeking to destroy the nationalistic
aspirations of the Eritrean people. And
(formerly South) Vietnam's imported
northern rulers are unable to stop
thousands of people from fleeing in
river craft across 800 or more miles of
sea to Brunei, and elsewhere.
Attention should be focused on re
gimes such as these, which ignore
basic human rights. In addition,
Americans, and others, should vigor
ously protest the aid being to such na
tions — such as U.S. computer sales to
China, U.S. Export-Import Bank loans
to Poland, loans and technical trade to
the Soviet regime, etc. Such aid furth
ers the interests of the repressive, rul
ing classes, rather than those of the
oppressed workers!
I urge students to speak out on be
half of the victims of these regimes,
and to seek an end to our myopic and
unjust support of these same regimes.
