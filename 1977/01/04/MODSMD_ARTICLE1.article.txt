# Berlin support key to program's fate
## 
### Elizabeth Pollock Staff writer 
Stanford-in-Berlin may be continued through the spring quarter of 1978
if either the university or the city of West Berlin can be persuaded to
provide the necessary funding, according to Corb Smith, assistant director
of the Overseas Studies Department.
Director Mark Mancall will meet with Berlin city officials next week,
and Smith said some possibility exists that they may provide help for the
program.
Presently, "we don't have that money (for Berlin) in the budget," Smith
said.
In order to meet budgetary targets, Overseas Studies had to eliminate
Berlin, starting next year. The program costs about $150,000 a year to
maintain.
However, "Stanford is willing to maintain the Berlin program another
year if the City of Berlin can continue its present arrangements with us,"
Mancall said before his departure for Europe.
The City of Berlin completely renovated the Villa Muthesius where
Stanford's classrooms, offices and library are located. "There isn't any
Stanford money in that (the renovation) at all," Smith said. This will be the
university's first year in the villa, which it rents from the city under special
arrangements.
The villa, architecturally significant because its designer, Hermann
Muthesius, belonged to the Bauhaus movement, "looked really gorgeous"
to Pat McConeghy, a German instructor who lives in the villa, Smith said.
This year's Berlin program starts its winter quarter this week with 21
participants. Enrollment for next quarter is in the "mid-305," Smith said.
Retention of the Vienna and Bonn campuses is assured for 1977-78.
Vienna is able to accommodate 50 students; Bonn is able to take 20.

they are willing to keep the campus open if the city offers to do its share
to maintain the desireability of the Berlin site. Until then, students who
wish to study in Berlin someday can only sit and wonder.
