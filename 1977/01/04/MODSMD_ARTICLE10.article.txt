# Carter's Cabinet: the same old deal
## 
### 
Pressure groups for feminists and
blacks are understandably piqued at
the "old boy" nature of Jimmy Carter's
cabinet, but a look at the personalities
who will shape Carter's Same Old Deal
shows that the biggest losers of all will
be those who cherish individual lib
erty here and around the globe.
Nothing speaks so clearly about the
insincerity of Carter, the supposed pil
lar of honesty, as the now-infamous
quote from his right-hand aide, Hamil
ton Jordan, just a few months ago:
"If after the inauguration you find a
Cy Vance as secretary of state and a
Zbigniew Brzezinski as head of na
tional security, then I would say we
failed. And I'd quit. But that's not
going to happen. You are going to see
new faces, new ideas. The government
is going to be run by people you have
never heard of." 112
Betrayal?
Not being among the 40 million who
fell for that line last November, I don't

know whether Carter's supporters feel
betrayed (Rachelle Marshall can give
us the final word on that, I suppose).
But I can't help but sense an even grea
ter threat to personal freedoms as one

administration gives way to another.
The praise that Henry Kissinger
showered on his successor, Vance,
should not have been lost on anyone.
Though the latter seems unlikely to
continue the Lone Ranger scheming of
Kissinger, Vance is part and parcel of
the same Eastern Establishment which

has directed U.S. foreign policy for at 1
least half a century.
It is a foreign policy bereft of moral
ity and principle — though Vance will
tell us this will no longer be the case, i
True enough, Vance began to show a
distaste for the Vietnam War while de
puty secretary of defense for Lyndon
Johnson — but was that, along wi th his
celebrated missions to the strife-torn
Dominican Republic and the Paris
"Peace" Talks, the fruit of an overrid
ing principle, or of practical necessity?
Interventionism
Likewise, of Defense Secretary
designate Harold Brown, the former
Robert McNamara aide, it can be
asked, do you recognize the evil of
military interventionism of the type
you helped direct as secretary of the
Air Force in 1969? Does your support
of the Bl bomber signal a change in
the position of the man who appointed
you?
And then there is Theodore Soren
son, appointed to head the CIA. As one
of John Kennedy's top aides, Sorenson
is well-schooled in the politics of in
ternational manipulation — perfect
training for his new post.
My God! The only selection Carter
needs to make this list complete is
David Halberstam as White House
biographer!
On the domestic front, prospects are
hardly more inviting.
None worse
Named to control the HEW monster
is the man whose Great Society prog
rams helped create it, Joseph Califano,
former top domestic aide to Lyndon
Johnson. It is no hyperbole to say that
from the point of view of small gov
ernment being the best government,
Carter could not have found a worse
person in America for HEW than
Califano.
Carter turned to the Congress for his
secretaries of transportation and ag
riculture, and the individuals he
selected are indeed representative of
the "gimme politics" of Capitol Hill.
Brock Adams has been steadfast in
his support of federal subsidies for un
economical transportation concerns.
He helped draft the Amtrak railroad
nationalization in 1970, then moved
on three years later to bring into being
Conrail, a government-sponsored

Northeast rail consolidation that is al
ready knee-deep in red ink.
Friend of regulation
He has continued to push for rail
subsidies, and for government grants
to the airline industry to help quiet its
crafts. He has been a friend to con
tinued regulation of the transportation
industry during a time when many on
both ends of the political spectrum
have come to realize that such regula
tion only benefits the large corporations,
now in business.
It should come as no surprise to read
in the Wall Street Journal that "trans
portation concerns are generally quite
pleased with Mr. Carter's selection be
cause of Mr. Adams' views on finan
cial aid and regulation."
Those who make their fortunes off
government subsidies and regulations
in agriculture should be equally de
lighted with the appointment of Bob
Bergland.
Bergland as agriculture secretary
promises a reversal of one of the few
joyous legacies of Earl Butz: a di
minishing of government's role on the
farm. As the Journal noted, Bergland
"is determined to lead an effort to re
verse Republican farm policies and
put the federal government heavily
into agriculture once again."
Results
The result is likely to be sharply in
creased federal price supports, crea
tion of a federal grain reserve and
higher import duties — all of which
will translate into higher prices for
consumers.
A higher overall price level can be
expected from a return to largely dis
credited Keynesian notions of
economic fine-tuning, in the person of
Charles Schultze, new chairperson of
the Council of Economic Advisers.
In short, then, what we can expect
from Carter et al. is a continuation of
the interventionist foreign policy con
ducted by all recent administrations,
and a dying out of the few glimmerings
of hope we saw in the economics of the
i Ford camp.
From the direction of the Georgia
Sunbelt is coming a long, cold winter
for individual liberty.
