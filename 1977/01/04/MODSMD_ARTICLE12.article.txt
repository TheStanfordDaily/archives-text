# Meyer planning plagued by input problems, delays

(Part I of a series analyzing the
architecture of Meyer Library.)
"Who is the idiot who de
signed Meyer?That bigdonut
hole in the middle is a great
source of noise, loss of heat
and waste of valuable space."
"I hope that in planning the
new building you do not
make the same mistake build
ing UGLY — viz. —grossly
inefficient use of space and
poor construction plan such
that the noise travels almost
to every part of the building."
"Instead of building a new
library, why don't you fill in
the middle of UGLY?"
—Student comments from
a survey of
Meyer Library users,
Spring 1975
Ten years after the J. Henry
Meyer Memorial Undergraduate
Library opened, its architecture
remains — to put it mildly —
controversial. Every under
graduate can (and does) speak
competently as an architectural
critic of the building since every
undergraduate spends halfofhis
or her life there.
But how much criticism was
there before Meyer was built?
Was student and faculty opinion
solicited? And if solicited, was
there much response? How does
the amount of input from stu
dents, staff and faculty compare
with the planning input for the
Main Library addition?
From the time Meyer Library

was planned in the early 60s
until November 1975, when the
Board of Trustees approved
plans for the Main Library addi
tion. "there's been a revolutio
nary change" in the attitude to
ward student opinion, according
to Elmer Grieder, director of
university libraries from 1959 to
1964.
Student opinion was certainly
utilized in the planning of
Meyer, but it was not so or
ganized or as actively solicited
as in the planning of the Main
addition. As Grieder puts it,
"There was a great deal less ex
pectation of student input."
Students were not allowed to
sit on university committees,
like the Academic Council
Committee on Libraries and the
University Committee on Land
and Building Development,
until 1968, two years after Meyer
was opened. These committees

now provide a formal structure
for a student voice in planning.
In addition to comments from
such committees, library staff
involved inplanning Mainaddi
tion relied on suggestions and
opinions expressed in a user
survey sent to every under
graduate at the beginning of
spring quarter, 1975.
'A thousand responses'
According to Phil Leighton,
building projects manager for
the libraries, there were "about a
thousand responses." Students
could indicate on the survey
whether they would be willing
to further discuss library prob
lems, but Leighton says a "dis
appointingly small" number re
sponded. Leighton remembers
"20 or 30" students showed up
in February 1976 to talk with the
Visiting Committee of the Stan
ford Libraries (an alumni group)
and only five came to a meeting

with Director 01 Libraries David
Weber, Chiet Meyer Librarian
Elizabeth Salzar and Asst. Direc
tor for Public Services Dale
Canelas.
Weber, one of the few persons
involved in the planning of both
Meyer and the Main addition,
points out that input into the
planning of the new addition
came from "thousands of
sources" and. in his opinion, the
student survey was "one of
slight value." Library staffers
(including student staffers) were
shown the plans and asked for
comment, and the faculty was
similarly solicited for sugges
tions. The same kind of
opinion-gathering process went
on while Meyer was being plan
ned.
Ironically, the very fact that
there were so many people to
consult made the planning of
Meyer — and indeed, the plan
ning of any large institutional
building — more difficult. With
many groups to consider, com
munication was more difficult
and conflicting views had to be
balanced.
Architect insistent
For instance, Grieder, director
while Meyer was being planned,

was not in tavor 01 the light well,
but he remembers that "this was
one thing the architect was very,
very insistent on." He did man
age to convince the architect to
modify the original plans which
showed a staircase in the mid
dle. the light well reaching all
the way to the ground and
pedestrian and bike traffic pas
sing through the lobby. Grieder,
looking back today, says he still
would have accepted the current
modified well "in view of the
strong feeling of the architect."
"The librarian often does not
have the last word. ... You have
to compromise." says Grieder.
On the other hand, Francisco
Centurion, one of the project ar
chitects handling Meyer Library
for the firm of John Carl War
necke & Associates, says about
the well, "I really can't tell you
where that decision came
from. . . A building of that size is
a team effort."
The many parties involved in
a project like Meyer means that
communication may go through
several layers.
The architect relies on his or
her contact in the Stanford Plan
ning Office to channel the jum
ble of building opinions into a

form that can translate into
suggestions for the actual design
of the building. Indeed. "I think
the university planner would
probably be very disturbed if the
architect asked other people,"
says Don Schaefer, a Warnecke
employe who did technical
drawings for the Meyer project.
In turn, the Planning Office
liason relies primarily on the lib
rary director to channel student,
faculty and library staff opinion.
Long planning time
Complicating the problem of
communication between large
numbers of people was the ex
ceptionally long time — seven
years — taken in planning
Meyer. In 1957, President Wal
lace Sterling called together an
ad hoc committee of faculty
members to formulate require
ments for an undergraduate lib
rary. The result was what
Leighton terms a "somewhat
vague" 17-page report, "more of
an academic program than a
building program," says
Leighton. The ad hoc committee
was disbanded after completion
of the report and never consulted
as a group again. Virgil
Whitaker. the chairman, says he
does not remember even seeing

the plans until after Meyer was
built. Another group drew up
the building program for the
audio library seven years later,
and yet another group planned
the interior layout.
An architect was not selected
until February 1960, after the
university had raised enough
money to proceed with plan
ning. The Board of Trustees ap
proved the site and schematic
plans in December of that year,
but the project was put aside for
the next two years, again for lack
of funds. Actual construction
took, almost two years and Meyer
Library was hot finally opened
until November,
In contrast, the planning
period on the Main addition
from the revised program to con
struction bids (this month) was
only about two years rather than
seven in Meyer's case.
Meyer Library is a monument
to these problems in planning —
the many groups, the long lead
time, the problems with com
munication. Planners involved in
the Main Library addition have
tried to avoid such problems by a
constant solicitation of student,
faculty, and staff opinion, and a
speeded-up planning period.
