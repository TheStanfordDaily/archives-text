# Hospitals rated poor by nurses

### 
New York (AP) — A survey of
10,000 nurses found that 38 per
cent wouldn't like to be patients
in their own hospitals.
The survey, reported in the
January issue of the magazine
Nursing 77, rated nursing care in
the United States and Canada at

a "low B" grade. The smaller the
hospital, the survey indicated,
the less the responding nurses
thought of the care.
As reasons why nursing care
of patients is less than excellent,
Nursing 77 reported that the
nurses blamed insufficient staff,
the burdens of paper work and
other obligations that took time
away from attending to patients.
The magazine last May pub
lished a "Probe of Quality Care,"
listing 78 questions and asking
its nursing readers to respond to
them. Those responses, more
than 10,000 of them, formed the
basis of the article.
Concerning health care across
the country, said Nursing 77,
only three per cent of nurses
rated it as excellent. Half said it
was good, the magazine re
ported, while 42 per cent rated it
as fair, and five percent as poor.
The nurses rated physical care
as good to high at their hospitals,
the publication said, but consi
dered emotional or psychologi
cal support of patients and
families as being only fair and
sometimes poor.
