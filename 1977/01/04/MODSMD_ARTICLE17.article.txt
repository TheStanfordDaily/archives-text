## Humble Howard picks post-St. Nick's flicks The
						New Kong King dazzles 
### Howard Baldwin 
Consider this — for what Dino De Laurentiis
spent on King Kong, he could have put every
single one of us — graduate and undergraduate —
through four years of college. Was his $24 million
well spent? Well, personally, I could think of a lot
better ways to put a dent in that much money.
For instance, Mayor Beame would probably be
thrilled to sell New York City for that much. A
South Pacific island might come in handy for
those post-finals blues. For $24 million, you could
probably put several senators and congressmen,
not to mention their secretaries, on lifetime re
tainers.
But since it's Dino's money and not mine, I have
no right to suggest to him how to spend it. Actu
ally, he did get New York and the island (Kauai, to
be specific) on film at least. The photography of
King Kong is nothing if not beautiful. Of course, if
all you want are pretty pictures, there's always
Barry Lyndon.
A fantasy
If you think I'm procrastinating with this re
view, you're right. How do you tell a man who's
just spent $24 million (merely saying it leaves a
sour taste in your mouth, doesn't it?) on one
movie that fantasies went out with big-budget
musicals and the 36-cent gallon of gasoline?
That's what King Kong is — a fantasy. What else
could the story of an overgrown chimpanzee who
falls in love with a beautiful would-be actress be?
To drag out the old cliches, today's audiences
have become too sophisticated to accept leprec
hauns, dwarves, witches and other such outdated
phenomena. When one employs such ephemeral
characters, the script should be liberally laced
with wit and salt. Screenwriter Lorenzo Semple,
Jr., knew this and that's why the first half of the
new King Kong is so good.
His updated script places Charles Grodin (The
Heartbreak Kid) and Jeff Bridges (Thunderbolt
and Lightfoot) into situations of tongue-in-cheek
hilarity with sight gags and ironic jokes. In this
respect, Grodin is perfect — his snobby executive
staking his career on unfound oil deposits is a
golden representation of opportunism at its

greediest.
On the other hand, Bridges, as an expert on
simians who resembles one himself, looks ex
tremely uncomfortable from the moment he stows
away on the oil corporation's ship.
Nosedive
After King Kong is captured and taken off to
civilization, the whole thing takes a headlong
nosedive straight into the schmaltz. Reverting to
the original for the spectacle of Kong simultane
ously searching for his love and doing his part for
urban renewal, all the film's humor and campness
vanish. We're suddenly asked to actually take his
love seriously. The juxtaposition of moods is so
completely uneven and the transition is so jarring
that all the fun of the film is lost.
King Kong suffers, like many films (Silver
Streak, for example), from a confusion of intent. Is
it an allegory for our being stolen from the inno
cence of childhood and being thrust like Kong
against our wills into a world of corruption? Or is
it an indictment of greed and commercialism in
society? I sincerely doubt the "latter, since other
media merchandising tied in with King Kong in
clude candy, belt buckles and books. For such a
commercial venture to be an accusation of com
mercialism is the supreme irony.
If it is a love story, why does it poke so much fun
at its characters in the beginning? Dwan (Jessica
Lange) explains that when the yacht on which she
was sailing exploded, she was spared because
she'd refused to watch Deep Throat — "Have you
ever met anyone whose life was saved by a
movie?" — it's funny because she's so daffy. But if
she's been used as a butt of humor for an hour,
how can director John Guillermin expect the au
dience to have sympathy for her abnormal love for
Kong?
The divergence between the humor of the 1976
version and the spectacle of the 1933 version is
completely mystifying, not to mention dissatisfy
ing. If the sardonic tone of the first half had per
vaded the entire film, the result would have been
an intelligent spectacle for both the mind and the
eyes, rather than just a special effects ex
travaganza for the eyes.
