# 'Network' attacks television
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
The current squabble the tele
vision networks are contending
with is the charge that they are
buying pretty faces to deliver the
news rather than experienced
reporters. Akin to that is the
charge that the networks are re
porting weirdly offbeat "happy
news" in their attempts to ba
lance the bad news of their
broadcasts.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Net
work is the answer to the
question "what happens when
entertainment and sen
sationalism fully encroach on
the news department?" When
the latter is headed by world
weary and hangdog Max
Schumacher (William Holden)
and the baroness of entertain
ment is his lover, ambitious and
aggressive Diana Christiansen
(Faye Dunaway, in what will be
her Academy Award-winning
role), and the whole proceedings
have been orchestrated by
screenwriter Paddy Chayevsky
and director Sidney Lumet, the
result is a satire so incisive it
puts television on the operating
table and opens it up for us to see
like a frog in an anatomy class.
Granted, Network is an exagg
erated vision of television. The
fictitious United Broadcasting
System (ÜBS, which also stands
for Undeniably BullShit) falls
prey to a corporate takeover by
Arab oil interests at the same
time its leading newscaster is
having periodic nervous break
downs on national television
and the head of programming is
negotiating with a terrorist

group for rights to a terrorism
act-of-the-week.
Pathetic possibility
But the film is so insanely
close to the way television actu
ally works that, given the pre
sent state of frustration of the
population of the United States
and the non-originality of the
three major networks, the film
becomes pathetically possible.
The story begins on Sep
tember 22,1975, when ÜBS fires
its newcaster, Howard Beale (Pe
ter Finch, in what will be his
Academy Award-winning role).
Drinking with companion
Schumacher, Beale muses about
committing suicide on the air.
This was written, mind you, be
fore that Sarasota weatherwo
man blew her brains out on the
air.
Schumacher, also in the throes
of a drunken binge, considers
the possibilities. "That's great
. . . an on-stage suicide. What a
great idea for a series! A suicide
every week . . . maybe even an
act of terrorism . . . we'd call it
The Death Hour — something
the whole family can enjoy.
We'd knock that fucking Disney
right off the air."
Uniquely American
The characters of Network,
like the film itself, are uniquely
American, slightly off-balance
in their single minded rush to
ward fulfillment of their dreams
and vaguely oblivious to the
rules and regulations by which
most people rearrange their
lives. Beale reneges on his offer
to commit suicide when his rat
ings skyrocket and Christiansen

takes over his programming and
transforms him into the "Mad
Prophet" of the airwaves,
supplanting him with devices
halfway between an Oral Roberts
telethon and a game show, in
cluding Sybil the Soothsayer,
whose job it is to broadcast the
news even before it happens.
People like Christiansen and
Hackett (the parent corpora
tion's representative who has
more power than the network
president, played by Robert
Duvall) are so wrapped up in
their quests for power and suc
cess that one begins to wonder

just exactly who is actually sane
and who is actually insane. The
dividing line grows fainter and
fainter as Hackett's eyes blaze
like firecrackers and Christian
sen's passion for ratings even in
trudes on her passion in the bed
room.
Network's one drawback lies
in its wordiness toward the end,
a complaint every critic has voi
ced. However, everything author
Chayevsky says is true. He has
expertly pinpointed all the ills of
television and even those of soc
iety. Underneath all his scathing
satire, it's scathingly truthful.

question "what happens when
entertainment and sen
sationalism fully encroach on
the news department?" When
the latter is headed by world
weary and hangdog Max
Schumacher (William Holden)
and the baroness of entertain
ment is his lover, ambitious and
aggressive Diana Christiansen
(Faye Dunaway, in what will be
her Academy Award-winning
role), and the whole proceedings
have been orchestrated by
screenwriter Paddy Chayevsky
and director Sidney Lumet, the
result is a satire so incisive it
puts television on the operating
table and opens it up for us to see
like a frog in an anatomy class.
Granted, Network is an exagg
erated vision of television. The
fictitious United Broadcasting
System (ÜBS, which also stands
for Undeniably BullShit) falls
prey to a corporate takeover by
Arab oil interests at the same
time its leading newscaster is
having periodic nervous break
downs on national television
and the head of programming is
negotiating with a terrorist

group for rights to a terrorism
act-of-the-week.
Pathetic possibility
But the film is so insanely
close to the way television actu
ally works that, given the pre
sent state of frustration of the
population of the United States
and the non-originality of the
three major networks, the film
becomes pathetically possible.
The story begins on Sep
tember 22,1975, when ÜBS fires
its newcaster, Howard Beale (Pe
ter Finch, in what will be his
Academy Award-winning role).
Drinking with companion
Schumacher, Beale muses about
committing suicide on the air.
This was written, mind you, be
fore that Sarasota weatherwo
man blew her brains out on the
air.
Schumacher, also in the throes
of a drunken binge, considers
the possibilities. "That's great
. . . an on-stage suicide. What a
great idea for a series! A suicide
every week . . . maybe even an
act of terrorism . . . we'd call it
The Death Hour — something
the whole family can enjoy.
We'd knock that fucking Disney
right off the air."
Uniquely American
The characters of Network,
like the film itself, are uniquely
American, slightly off-balance
in their single minded rush to
ward fulfillment of their dreams
and vaguely oblivious to the
rules and regulations by which
most people rearrange their
lives. Beale reneges on his offer
to commit suicide when his rat
ings skyrocket and Christiansen

takes over his programming and
transforms him into the "Mad
Prophet" of the airwaves,
supplanting him with devices
halfway between an Oral Roberts
telethon and a game show, in
cluding Sybil the Soothsayer,
whose job it is to broadcast the
news even before it happens.
People like Christiansen and
Hackett (the parent corpora
tion's representative who has
more power than the network
president, played by Robert
Duvall) are so wrapped up in
their quests for power and suc
cess that one begins to wonder

just exactly who is actually sane
and who is actually insane. The
dividing line grows fainter and
fainter as Hackett's eyes blaze
like firecrackers and Christian
sen's passion for ratings even in
trudes on her passion in the bed
room.
Network's one drawback lies
in its wordiness toward the end,
a complaint every critic has voi
ced. However, everything author
Chayevsky says is true. He has
expertly pinpointed all the ills of
television and even those of soc
iety. Underneath all his scathing
satire, it's scathingly truthful.
