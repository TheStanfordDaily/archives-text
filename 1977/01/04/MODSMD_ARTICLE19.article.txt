# Finch discusses 'Network' reaction
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
When Steven Farber of New
West magazine entitled his re
view of Network "See It Now —
It Won't Be on ABC," he was
technically right but literally
without much foresight. In a re
cent interview in San Francisco,
the disintegrating newscaster of
the film, Peter Finch, revealed
that the producers had already
received offers from NBC to
broadcast the film on television
— even before they had learned
public reaction to the film.
such harlots," Finch
said disdainfully. "They'll do
anything for a high rating."
With a cultured British accent,
Finch comfortably discussed in
dustry reaction to the film which
portrays television and its
executives in a less than com
plimentary light. The president
of the fictional ÜBS network is
bullied by a representative of the
parent corporation (Robert
Duvall) to the point of ineffectu
ally. The programming director
(Faye Dunaway) is a violently
sexual personification of televi
sion, wrapped up in herself just
as television is wrapped up in
itself.
Executive critics
The film's critics, Finch said,
are mostly television executives.
"People have attacked this film
. . . Barbara Walters in particu
lar, though I don't know why she
shouldn't like it. They say it's an
attack on news departments . . .
even though it attacks people
who attack news."
'A piece of irony'
"It's a piece of irony," he con
tinued. "When a rating point be
comes worth a million dollars,
we indulge in skullduggery. We
must guard against life being
denigrated by this greed. We, the
makers of this film, have a fear
that network news will turn into

a tabloid."
In direct contrast to his words
about the television industry,
Finch had nothing but praise for
movies in general and his as
sociates on Network in particu
lar. "The difference between
television and the cinema," he
said, "is that there's a degree of
freedom of choice in making a
film that isn't there in television
because of ratings."
Praise
Finch singled out MGM presi
dent Daniel Melnick for praise
because he decided to support
Network when every other
studio in Hollywood had dis
missed it as "too intellectual for
the general public."
As for screenwriter Paddy
Chayevsky, a disgruntled
graduate of television, Finch
complimented him by saying
that "Paddy hones his dialogue
marvelously." Although he said
that he and William Holden
often experimented with their
lines in rehearsal, "when we got
to the actual tape, we always
went back to his lines." He said
that Chayevsky wrote Duna
way's role of Diana Christiansen
after being constantly urged to
create a great role for an actress
to play. "Now that he has,"
Finch laments, "they're attack
ing him. It was not intended to
be a slur on womanhood."
As for his own highly praised
performances. Finch said mod
estly, "I saw it in the dailies in
little bits and pieces. Seeing the
finished product, it's like a jig
saw puzzle that I've finished — I
can still see the cracks and lines
in the middle."
But for the filmgoer, those
lines are invisible. Finch's per
formance is, as are the perfor
mances of Holden, Dunaway and
Duvall, nothing short of devas
tating.
