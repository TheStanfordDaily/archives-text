# Officials predict minimal congressional opposition to Carter reorganization plan
## 
### 
Plains, Ga. (AP) — A bill authoriz
ing President-elect Jimmy Carter to
propose a sweeping reorganization of
the federal government should sail
through Congress, the chairman of the
House Government Operations Com
mittee said yesterday.
Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), also Je
a "wild guess" that reorganiza*on
might save the government as much as

10 per cent of the annual federal
budget, which is currently more than
$413 billion.
Brooks also predicted that when
Carter completes his reorganization
plans, Congress will act favorably on
them, although they inevitably will
draw opposition from defenders of the
status quo and will have lobbyists
"jumping through hoops."

Brooks made the comments after
discussing the reorganization authori
zation bill with Carter and Bert Lance,
the designated head of the Office of
Management and Budget, at Carter's
home here.
Tough opposition
Brooks said Carter's reorganization
plans will be opposed by "all the lob
byists in Washington for one; all the
lawyers that live out of the agencies for
No. 2; and all the public relations
people, No. 3. They will all jump
through hoops when you change the
format."
What Carter wants is enactment of
legislation committing him to submit
to Congress detailed reorganization
plans which will go into effect if not
vetoed by either the Senate or House.
Brooks said he believes the 60-day
waiting period between each proposal
and final implementation is necessary
to give congressional committees a
chance to evaluate each plan.
Meanwhile, Carter's mother, 78-
year-old "Miss Lillian" Carter, was re
leased from the Americus-Sumter
County Hospital after 12 days of treat

ments for painful muscle spasms in
her legs.
U.S.-Soviet summit
The president-elect told reporters in
an interview that while he does not
object to summit meetings with Soviet
party leader Leonid Brezhnev early in
his administration, he hopes "that if
we do have them they will be in the
I lited States.
'"I wouldn't want to go out of the
country right at first for such a meet
ing," Carter said.
The president-elect was interviewed
by the editor and publisher of the daily
paper nearest to his home, the
Americus Times-Recorder.
In the interview Carter said that as
president he intends to follow "about
the same schedule as when I was gov
ernor. I will rise early and be in the
office probably around 7 a.m., then I'll
work through and take time off at sup
per in order to spend time with my
family. Then I'll probably do some
studying and work afterward."
He said he "definitely" plans to
make his home in Plains his "little
White House" during his presidential
years.

plans which will go into effect if not
vetoed by either the Senate or House.
Brooks said he believes the 60-day
waiting period between each proposal
and final implementation is necessary
to give congressional committees a
chance to evaluate each plan.
Meanwhile, Carter's mother, 78-
year-old "Miss Lillian" Carter, was re
leased from the Americus-Sumter
County Hospital after 12 days of treat

ments for painful muscle spasms in
her legs.
U.S.-Soviet summit
The president-elect told reporters in
an interview that while he does not
object to summit meetings with Soviet
party leader Leonid Brezhnev early in
his administration, he hopes "that if
we do have them they will be in the
I lited States.
'"I wouldn't want to go out of the
country right at first for such a meet
ing," Carter said.
The president-elect was interviewed
by the editor and publisher of the daily
paper nearest to his home, the
Americus Times-Recorder.
In the interview Carter said that as
president he intends to follow "about
the same schedule as when I was gov
ernor. I will rise early and be in the
office probably around 7 a.m., then I'll
work through and take time off at sup
per in order to spend time with my
family. Then I'll probably do some
studying and work afterward."
He said he "definitely" plans to
make his home in Plains his "little
White House" during his presidential
years.
Plains, Ga. (AP) — A bill authoriz
ing President-elect Jimmy Carter to
propose a sweeping reorganization of
the federal government should sail
through Congress, the chairman of the
House Government Operations Com
mittee said yesterday.
Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), also Je
a "wild guess" that reorganiza*on
might save the government as much as

10 per cent of the annual federal
budget, which is currently more than
$413 billion.
Brooks also predicted that when
Carter completes his reorganization
plans, Congress will act favorably on
them, although they inevitably will
draw opposition from defenders of the
status quo and will have lobbyists
"jumping through hoops."

Brooks made the comments after
discussing the reorganization authori
zation bill with Carter and Bert Lance,
the designated head of the Office of
Management and Budget, at Carter's
home here.
Tough opposition
Brooks said Carter's reorganization
plans will be opposed by "all the lob
byists in Washington for one; all the
lawyers that live out of the agencies for
No. 2; and all the public relations
people, No. 3. They will all jump
through hoops when you change the
format."
What Carter wants is enactment of
legislation committing him to submit
to Congress detailed reorganization
plans which will go into effect if not
vetoed by either the Senate or House.
Brooks said he believes the 60-day
waiting period between each proposal
and final implementation is necessary
to give congressional committees a
chance to evaluate each plan.
