Byrd, Griffin favored for posts
Washington — Supporters of Sen. Robert
Byrd of West Virginia expressed confidence yes
terday that he will win election as Senate Demo
cratic leader by a comfortable margin.
But an aide of Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Min
nesota, Byrd's only remaining rival for Senate
majority leader in the new Congress convening
today, talked of a possible upset victory.
Republican senators will elect a new minority
leader, with Sen. Robert Griffin of Michigan the
only avowed candidate but with Sen. Howard
Baker Jr. of Tennessee acting like a candidate.
Jockeying for the top leadership posts inten
sified as senators gathered for the opening gavel
of the 95th Congress.
House members already have chosen their
leaders, but in the Senate party caucuses were to
be held this morning to settle the contests for
leadership posts.
Byrd, the Democratic whip, or assistant
leader, since he ousted Sen. Edward Kennedy
from the post in 1971, has been the acknow
ledged frontrunner to succeed Mike Mansfield
of Montana as majority leader.
Sens. Edmund Muskie of Maine and Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina have previously
dropped out of the race.
David Gartner, Humphrey's administrative
assistant, said the secret balloting at the party
caucus is the key to the outcome. He said two or
three senators, whom he declined to name, have
told Humphrey they will vote for him even
though they are publicly committed to Byrd.
The majority leadership post is open because
of Mansfield's retirement from the Senate. Sen.
Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, the GOP leader in
the last Congress, also retired.
Baker was the only senator maneuvering to
challenge Griffin, the GOP whip since 1969, for
election to succeed Scott. Baker, however, re
fused to say if his name would be presented at
the party conference.
He indicated it all would depend on how his
chances of winning look.
Chinese killed hundreds in Oct. riot
Bonn — Communist radicals armed with
spears, axes and some guns rebelled in the rice
growing province of Szechwan and "many hun
dreds, if not thousands" of people were killed
before the uprising was crushed, according to a
West German news report.
The news agency DPA said in a dispatch from
Peking that the rebellion by supporters of
Chiang Ching, purged widow of Mao Tse-tung,
apparently occurred before Chiang and the three
other members of the radical "Gang of Four"
were arrested last October.
Quoting Chinese sources, the agency said un
rest was still continuing in some sections of
China, although the most serious strife had en
ded.
The Szechwan disturbances were the
bloodiest reported thus far in the unfolding story
of civil disorder that spread through China last
year, apparently climaxing with the ouster of the
radical leadership one month after the death of
party Chairman Mao on Sept. 9.

China's vice premier, Li Hsien Nien, referred
to the unrest in a toast at a dinner for the visiting
leader of Bangladesh, Ziaur Rahman, the Yugos
lav news agency Tanjug reported from Peking
yesterday.
Tanjug said Li mentioned "violent unrest fol
lowing the death of Mao Tse-tung" but did not
say when or where it had occurred. Li indicated
that the current situation was stable, the agency
said.
But DPA reported: "The government and
army still have the task of liquidating the widely
dispersed rebellion."
Bell generally opposed to busing
Washington — Attorney General-designate
Griffin Bell said yesterday he believes busing
should be used to desegregate urban schools
only in rare cases.
"I think it upsets Americans to take children
away from their neighborhoods," Bell told a
news conference. "1 think neighborhood schools
are preferable, all other things being equal."
But Bell said busing may be needed to de
segregate some school systems and protect the
constitutional rights of minority children.
"In time," he continued, "we will have integ
rated housing. But you can't wait on desegre
gated schools until that day comes, so you have
to use busing as part of the remedy.
"I think there's going to be some school dis
tricts where busing will be employed as a last
resort."
Bell outlined his views on busing when he
was asked whether he contemplates any change
in Justice Department policy on the issue if he is
confirmed as attorney general.
His reply generally follows the current de
partment policy which is to support only the
extent of busing necessary to correct the dis
crimination caused by official acts of school
boards and other government agencies.
Fund loans British $3.9 billion
Washington — The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved a standby arrangement
yesterday authorizing Great Britain to borrow up
to $3.9 billion over the next 24 months.
The British had applied for the loan in October
in an effort to bolster their sagging economy and
to try and halt the slide in value of the pound
relative to other currencies.
IMF staffers and officials have been studying
the British economic situation since then in an
effort to assure that the nation would be able to
repay the money.
Last month, British Chancellor of the Ex
chequer Denis Healey announced a series of
measures designed to hold down inflation and
cut government borrowing so that it would be
better able to comply with any stipulations re
lated to the IMF loan.
The program outlined by Healey involved two
years of holding down government spending by
some two billion pounds — about $3.4 billion —
while at the same time levying only a few small
increases in taxes.
The British proposal had been hailed at the
outset by U.S. Treasury Secretary William Si

mon, member of the IMF board and one of those
responsible for voting approval of the credit.
The $3.9 billion loan is the fourth big credit
extended on Britain's behalf in about a year.
Major trading partners set up a standby $5.3
billion credit for Great Britain in June, and the
IMF set up loans of $800 million in June and
$1.17 billion in December, 1975.
But much of the credit extended in June ex
pired last month, so that some of the new loan
presumably would be used to pay off the earlier
debt.
Under the standby arrangement, the British
authorities will be authorized to draw an
amount equivalent to $1.16 billion immediately.
Total credit is not to exceed the equivalent of
$2.26 billion over the first 12 months.
To finance the credit the fund will borrow the
equivalent of $2.97 billion from eight particip
ants in the fund.
Rhodesian changeover planned
Port Elizabeth, South Africa — British envoy
Ivor Richard met yesterday with Prime Minister
John Vorster on a transition to black rule in
neighboring Rhodesia and called the talks "use
ful, helpful and constructive."
Richard, chairman of negotiations between
black and white Rhodesian leaders in Geneva,
said "we agreed to meet again in about 10 days
time."
Vorster had little comment for reporters ex
cept to say he had not been in touch with Rhode
sian Prime Minister lan Smith over the weekend
and did not plan to meet with him.
Richard was glum after talks with Smith on
Saturday but appeared more cheerful after his
meeting with Vorster near the south coastal city
of Port Elizabeth.
Rhodesian sources said Smith rejected
Richard's proposals for a direct British role in an
interim Rhodesian government leading to black
majority rule by March 1978.
The proposals included an interim council of
ministers dominated by blacks with a British
appointed chairman and British control of
Rhodesia's police and military during the transi
tion, the sources said.
Richard said the Geneva talks, now scheduled
to resume Jan. 17, could be delayed if problems
arise.
Following his meeting with Vorster, Richard
told reporters in Pretoria that he was dealing
with the leaders of all African states concerned
with Rhodesia. He and Vorster did not discuss
South Africa's economic influence on Rhodesia,
Richard said.
South Africa is Rhodesia's main trading part
ner and provides much of the arms for the con
tinuing guerrilla war against black nationalists
in Rhodesia, where 270,000 whites are outnum
bered almost 25-to-one by 6.4 million blacks.
Yoshimura mistrial ruling delayed
Oakland — The judge in the weapons posses
sion trial of Wendy Yoshimura yesterday post
poned for at least one day his ruling on a defense
motion to seek a mistrial.
Alameda County Superior Court Judge Martin
Pulich said he "wanted to study more cases"

before deciding whether prosecutor Jeffrey
Horner had prejudiced Yoshimura's defense by
mentioning tin; names of r.onvicted bank robber
Patricia Hearst and Ii«»r other underground com
panions.
Pulich said he was taking advantage of an
unexpected delay in tin: trial. Two jurors and
one alternate told court officials they could not
attend yesterday's session, two because of ill
ness and one because she was stranded in the
snow-bound Sierra.
If Pulich rejects defense attorney James Lar
son s request for a mistrial, defense testimony is
expected to begin immediately.
Prosecutor Jeff Horner rested his case just be
fore Christmas. Court was canceled last week
while Horner recovered from a bout with the flu.
Larson had objected to Horner mentioning
Hearst and Symbionese Liberation Army mem
bers William and Emily Harris as Yoshimura's
associates while a fugitive.
Nixon: inauguration guest?
Plains, Ga. — President-elect Jimmy Carter
has invited former President Richard Nixon,
who resigned in disgrace because of Watergate,
to his inauguration, Carter's spokesman said
yesterday.
Press Secretary Jody Powell said there has
been no indication whether Nixon and his fam
ily will attend the Jan. 20 inauguration cere
monies on the Capitol steps in Washington.
"It has been true without fail that traditionally
former Presidents and former First Ladies are
invited to a new president's inauguration,"
Powell said.
Language barrier hampers rescue
Chicago — Chicago's fire chief said yesterday
he would ask — but not order — every one of the
city's 4600 firemen to learn some basic Spanish
after 26 persons died in three fires in Latin
neighborhoods over the year-end holidays.
Community leaders in the Spanish-speaking
neighborhoods had complained that a language
barrier hampered rescue efforts.
Fire Commissioner Robert Quinn also said he
will immediately transfer a Spanish-speaking
firefighter to work with residents of the Pilsen
area, where 17 persons, including 13 children,
died in two holiday fires.
Quinn made the announcements after meet
ing for more than an hour with representatives of
the Pilsen Neighbors Community Council.
Raquel Guerrero, a spokeswoman for the
community council, told Quinn, "We must see
an end to people dying needlessly because we
lack Spanish-speaking firefighters, proper fire
fighting equipment and effective fire
prevention programs."
The city has only nine firefighters with
Spanish surnames, Quinn said. Allegations of a
hiring bias in the department are before a federal
court.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today. Fair tonight and tomor

the Pilsen Neighbors Community Council.
Raquel Guerrero, a spokeswoman for the
community council, told Quinn, "We must see
an end to people dying needlessly because we
lack Spanish-speaking firefighters, proper fire
fighting equipment and effective fire
prevention programs."
The city has only nine firefighters with
Spanish surnames, Quinn said. Allegations of a
hiring bias in the department are before a federal
court.

Byrd, Griffin favored for posts
Washington — Supporters of Sen. Robert
Byrd of West Virginia expressed confidence yes
terday that he will win election as Senate Demo
cratic leader by a comfortable margin.
But an aide of Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Min
nesota, Byrd's only remaining rival for Senate
majority leader in the new Congress convening
today, talked of a possible upset victory.
Republican senators will elect a new minority
leader, with Sen. Robert Griffin of Michigan the
only avowed candidate but with Sen. Howard
Baker Jr. of Tennessee acting like a candidate.
Jockeying for the top leadership posts inten
sified as senators gathered for the opening gavel
of the 95th Congress.
House members already have chosen their
leaders, but in the Senate party caucuses were to
be held this morning to settle the contests for
leadership posts.
Byrd, the Democratic whip, or assistant
leader, since he ousted Sen. Edward Kennedy
from the post in 1971, has been the acknow
ledged frontrunner to succeed Mike Mansfield
of Montana as majority leader.
Sens. Edmund Muskie of Maine and Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina have previously
dropped out of the race.
David Gartner, Humphrey's administrative
assistant, said the secret balloting at the party
caucus is the key to the outcome. He said two or
three senators, whom he declined to name, have
told Humphrey they will vote for him even
though they are publicly committed to Byrd.
The majority leadership post is open because
of Mansfield's retirement from the Senate. Sen.
Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, the GOP leader in
the last Congress, also retired.
Baker was the only senator maneuvering to
challenge Griffin, the GOP whip since 1969, for
election to succeed Scott. Baker, however, re
fused to say if his name would be presented at
the party conference.
He indicated it all would depend on how his
chances of winning look.
Chinese killed hundreds in Oct. riot
Bonn — Communist radicals armed with
spears, axes and some guns rebelled in the rice
growing province of Szechwan and "many hun
dreds, if not thousands" of people were killed
before the uprising was crushed, according to a
West German news report.
The news agency DPA said in a dispatch from
Peking that the rebellion by supporters of
Chiang Ching, purged widow of Mao Tse-tung,
apparently occurred before Chiang and the three
other members of the radical "Gang of Four"
were arrested last October.
Quoting Chinese sources, the agency said un
rest was still continuing in some sections of
China, although the most serious strife had en
ded.
The Szechwan disturbances were the
bloodiest reported thus far in the unfolding story
of civil disorder that spread through China last
year, apparently climaxing with the ouster of the
radical leadership one month after the death of
party Chairman Mao on Sept. 9.

China's vice premier, Li Hsien Nien, referred
to the unrest in a toast at a dinner for the visiting
leader of Bangladesh, Ziaur Rahman, the Yugos
lav news agency Tanjug reported from Peking
yesterday.
Tanjug said Li mentioned "violent unrest fol
lowing the death of Mao Tse-tung" but did not
say when or where it had occurred. Li indicated
that the current situation was stable, the agency
said.
But DPA reported: "The government and
army still have the task of liquidating the widely
dispersed rebellion."
Bell generally opposed to busing
Washington — Attorney General-designate
Griffin Bell said yesterday he believes busing
should be used to desegregate urban schools
only in rare cases.
"I think it upsets Americans to take children
away from their neighborhoods," Bell told a
news conference. "1 think neighborhood schools
are preferable, all other things being equal."
But Bell said busing may be needed to de
segregate some school systems and protect the
constitutional rights of minority children.
"In time," he continued, "we will have integ
rated housing. But you can't wait on desegre
gated schools until that day comes, so you have
to use busing as part of the remedy.
"I think there's going to be some school dis
tricts where busing will be employed as a last
resort."
Bell outlined his views on busing when he
was asked whether he contemplates any change
in Justice Department policy on the issue if he is
confirmed as attorney general.
His reply generally follows the current de
partment policy which is to support only the
extent of busing necessary to correct the dis
crimination caused by official acts of school
boards and other government agencies.
Fund loans British $3.9 billion
Washington — The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved a standby arrangement
yesterday authorizing Great Britain to borrow up
to $3.9 billion over the next 24 months.
The British had applied for the loan in October
in an effort to bolster their sagging economy and
to try and halt the slide in value of the pound
relative to other currencies.
IMF staffers and officials have been studying
the British economic situation since then in an
effort to assure that the nation would be able to
repay the money.
Last month, British Chancellor of the Ex
chequer Denis Healey announced a series of
measures designed to hold down inflation and
cut government borrowing so that it would be
better able to comply with any stipulations re
lated to the IMF loan.
The program outlined by Healey involved two
years of holding down government spending by
some two billion pounds — about $3.4 billion —
while at the same time levying only a few small
increases in taxes.
The British proposal had been hailed at the
outset by U.S. Treasury Secretary William Si

mon, member of the IMF board and one of those
responsible for voting approval of the credit.
The $3.9 billion loan is the fourth big credit
extended on Britain's behalf in about a year.
Major trading partners set up a standby $5.3
billion credit for Great Britain in June, and the
IMF set up loans of $800 million in June and
$1.17 billion in December, 1975.
But much of the credit extended in June ex
pired last month, so that some of the new loan
presumably would be used to pay off the earlier
debt.
Under the standby arrangement, the British
authorities will be authorized to draw an
amount equivalent to $1.16 billion immediately.
Total credit is not to exceed the equivalent of
$2.26 billion over the first 12 months.
To finance the credit the fund will borrow the
equivalent of $2.97 billion from eight particip
ants in the fund.
Rhodesian changeover planned
Port Elizabeth, South Africa — British envoy
Ivor Richard met yesterday with Prime Minister
John Vorster on a transition to black rule in
neighboring Rhodesia and called the talks "use
ful, helpful and constructive."
Richard, chairman of negotiations between
black and white Rhodesian leaders in Geneva,
said "we agreed to meet again in about 10 days
time."
Vorster had little comment for reporters ex
cept to say he had not been in touch with Rhode
sian Prime Minister lan Smith over the weekend
and did not plan to meet with him.
Richard was glum after talks with Smith on
Saturday but appeared more cheerful after his
meeting with Vorster near the south coastal city
of Port Elizabeth.
Rhodesian sources said Smith rejected
Richard's proposals for a direct British role in an
interim Rhodesian government leading to black
majority rule by March 1978.
The proposals included an interim council of
ministers dominated by blacks with a British
appointed chairman and British control of
Rhodesia's police and military during the transi
tion, the sources said.
Richard said the Geneva talks, now scheduled
to resume Jan. 17, could be delayed if problems
arise.
Following his meeting with Vorster, Richard
told reporters in Pretoria that he was dealing
with the leaders of all African states concerned
with Rhodesia. He and Vorster did not discuss
South Africa's economic influence on Rhodesia,
Richard said.
South Africa is Rhodesia's main trading part
ner and provides much of the arms for the con
tinuing guerrilla war against black nationalists
in Rhodesia, where 270,000 whites are outnum
bered almost 25-to-one by 6.4 million blacks.
Yoshimura mistrial ruling delayed
Oakland — The judge in the weapons posses
sion trial of Wendy Yoshimura yesterday post
poned for at least one day his ruling on a defense
motion to seek a mistrial.
Alameda County Superior Court Judge Martin
Pulich said he "wanted to study more cases"

before deciding whether prosecutor Jeffrey
Horner had prejudiced Yoshimura's defense by
mentioning tin; names of r.onvicted bank robber
Patricia Hearst and Ii«»r other underground com
panions.
Pulich said he was taking advantage of an
unexpected delay in tin: trial. Two jurors and
one alternate told court officials they could not
attend yesterday's session, two because of ill
ness and one because she was stranded in the
snow-bound Sierra.
If Pulich rejects defense attorney James Lar
son s request for a mistrial, defense testimony is
expected to begin immediately.
Prosecutor Jeff Horner rested his case just be
fore Christmas. Court was canceled last week
while Horner recovered from a bout with the flu.
Larson had objected to Horner mentioning
Hearst and Symbionese Liberation Army mem
bers William and Emily Harris as Yoshimura's
associates while a fugitive.
Nixon: inauguration guest?
Plains, Ga. — President-elect Jimmy Carter

monies on the Capitol steps in Washington.
"It has been true without fail that traditionally
former Presidents and former First Ladies are

Powell said.
Language barrier hampers rescue
Chicago — Chicago's fire chief said yesterday
he would ask — but not order — every one of the
city's 4600 firemen to learn some basic Spanish
after 26 persons died in three fires in Latin
neighborhoods over the year-end holidays.
Community leaders in the Spanish-speaking
neighborhoods had complained that a language
barrier hampered rescue efforts.
Fire Commissioner Robert Quinn also said he
will immediately transfer a Spanish-speaking
firefighter to work with residents of the Pilsen
area, where 17 persons, including 13 children,
died in two holiday fires.
Quinn made the announcements after meet
ing for more than an hour with representatives of
the Pilsen Neighbors Community Council.
Raquel Guerrero, a spokeswoman for the

Language barrier hampers rescue
Chicago — Chicago's fire chief said yesterday
he would ask — but not order — every one of the
city's 4600 firemen to learn some basic Spanish
after 26 persons died in three fires in Latin
neighborhoods over the year-end holidays.
Community leaders in the Spanish-speaking
neighborhoods had complained that a language
barrier hampered rescue efforts.
Fire Commissioner Robert Quinn also said he
will immediately transfer a Spanish-speaking
firefighter to work with residents of the Pilsen
area, where 17 persons, including 13 children,
died in two holiday fires.
Quinn made the announcements after meet
ing for more than an hour with representatives of
the Pilsen Neighbors Community Council.
Raquel Guerrero, a spokeswoman for the
community council, told Quinn, "We must see
an end to people dying needlessly because we
lack Spanish-speaking firefighters, proper fire
fighting equipment and effective fire
prevention programs."
The city has only nine firefighters with
Spanish surnames, Quinn said. Allegations of a
hiring bias in the department are before a federal
court.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today. Fair tonight and tomor

Byrd, Griffin favored for posts
Washington — Supporters of Sen. Robert
Byrd of West Virginia expressed confidence yes
terday that he will win election as Senate Demo
cratic leader by a comfortable margin.
But an aide of Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Min
nesota, Byrd's only remaining rival for Senate
majority leader in the new Congress convening
today, talked of a possible upset victory.
Republican senators will elect a new minority
leader, with Sen. Robert Griffin of Michigan the
only avowed candidate but with Sen. Howard
Baker Jr. of Tennessee acting like a candidate.
Jockeying for the top leadership posts inten
sified as senators gathered for the opening gavel
of the 95th Congress.
House members already have chosen their
leaders, but in the Senate party caucuses were to
be held this morning to settle the contests for
leadership posts.
Byrd, the Democratic whip, or assistant
leader, since he ousted Sen. Edward Kennedy
from the post in 1971, has been the acknow
ledged frontrunner to succeed Mike Mansfield
of Montana as majority leader.
Sens. Edmund Muskie of Maine and Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina have previously
dropped out of the race.
David Gartner, Humphrey's administrative
assistant, said the secret balloting at the party
caucus is the key to the outcome. He said two or
three senators, whom he declined to name, have
told Humphrey they will vote for him even
though they are publicly committed to Byrd.
The majority leadership post is open because
of Mansfield's retirement from the Senate. Sen.
Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, the GOP leader in
the last Congress, also retired.
Baker was the only senator maneuvering to
challenge Griffin, the GOP whip since 1969, for
election to succeed Scott. Baker, however, re
fused to say if his name would be presented at
the party conference.
He indicated it all would depend on how his
chances of winning look.
Chinese killed hundreds in Oct. riot
Bonn — Communist radicals armed with
spears, axes and some guns rebelled in the rice
growing province of Szechwan and "many hun
dreds, if not thousands" of people were killed
before the uprising was crushed, according to a
West German news report.
The news agency DPA said in a dispatch from
Peking that the rebellion by supporters of
Chiang Ching, purged widow of Mao Tse-tung,
apparently occurred before Chiang and the three
other members of the radical "Gang of Four"
were arrested last October.
Quoting Chinese sources, the agency said un
rest was still continuing in some sections of
China, although the most serious strife had en
ded.
The Szechwan disturbances were the
bloodiest reported thus far in the unfolding story
of civil disorder that spread through China last
year, apparently climaxing with the ouster of the
radical leadership one month after the death of
party Chairman Mao on Sept. 9.

China's vice premier, Li Hsien Nien, referred
to the unrest in a toast at a dinner for the visiting
leader of Bangladesh, Ziaur Rahman, the Yugos
lav news agency Tanjug reported from Peking
yesterday.
Tanjug said Li mentioned "violent unrest fol
lowing the death of Mao Tse-tung" but did not
say when or where it had occurred. Li indicated
that the current situation was stable, the agency
said.
But DPA reported: "The government and
army still have the task of liquidating the widely
dispersed rebellion."
Bell generally opposed to busing
Washington — Attorney General-designate
Griffin Bell said yesterday he believes busing
should be used to desegregate urban schools
only in rare cases.
"I think it upsets Americans to take children
away from their neighborhoods," Bell told a
news conference. "1 think neighborhood schools
are preferable, all other things being equal."
But Bell said busing may be needed to de
segregate some school systems and protect the
constitutional rights of minority children.
"In time," he continued, "we will have integ
rated housing. But you can't wait on desegre
gated schools until that day comes, so you have
to use busing as part of the remedy.
"I think there's going to be some school dis
tricts where busing will be employed as a last
resort."
Bell outlined his views on busing when he
was asked whether he contemplates any change
in Justice Department policy on the issue if he is
confirmed as attorney general.
His reply generally follows the current de
partment policy which is to support only the
extent of busing necessary to correct the dis
crimination caused by official acts of school
boards and other government agencies.
Fund loans British $3.9 billion
Washington — The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved a standby arrangement
yesterday authorizing Great Britain to borrow up
to $3.9 billion over the next 24 months.
The British had applied for the loan in October
in an effort to bolster their sagging economy and
to try and halt the slide in value of the pound
relative to other currencies.
IMF staffers and officials have been studying
the British economic situation since then in an
effort to assure that the nation would be able to
repay the money.
Last month, British Chancellor of the Ex
chequer Denis Healey announced a series of
measures designed to hold down inflation and
cut government borrowing so that it would be
better able to comply with any stipulations re
lated to the IMF loan.
The program outlined by Healey involved two
years of holding down government spending by
some two billion pounds — about $3.4 billion —
while at the same time levying only a few small
increases in taxes.
The British proposal had been hailed at the
outset by U.S. Treasury Secretary William Si

mon, member of the IMF board and one of those
responsible for voting approval of the credit.
The $3.9 billion loan is the fourth big credit
extended on Britain's behalf in about a year.
Major trading partners set up a standby $5.3
billion credit for Great Britain in June, and the
IMF set up loans of $800 million in June and
$1.17 billion in December, 1975.
But much of the credit extended in June ex
pired last month, so that some of the new loan
presumably would be used to pay off the earlier
debt.
Under the standby arrangement, the British
authorities will be authorized to draw an
amount equivalent to $1.16 billion immediately.
Total credit is not to exceed the equivalent of
$2.26 billion over the first 12 months.
To finance the credit the fund will borrow the
equivalent of $2.97 billion from eight particip
ants in the fund.
Rhodesian changeover planned
Port Elizabeth, South Africa — British envoy
Ivor Richard met yesterday with Prime Minister
John Vorster on a transition to black rule in
neighboring Rhodesia and called the talks "use
ful, helpful and constructive."
Richard, chairman of negotiations between
black and white Rhodesian leaders in Geneva,
said "we agreed to meet again in about 10 days
time."
Vorster had little comment for reporters ex
cept to say he had not been in touch with Rhode
sian Prime Minister lan Smith over the weekend
and did not plan to meet with him.
Richard was glum after talks with Smith on
Saturday but appeared more cheerful after his
meeting with Vorster near the south coastal city
of Port Elizabeth.
Rhodesian sources said Smith rejected
Richard's proposals for a direct British role in an
interim Rhodesian government leading to black
majority rule by March 1978.
The proposals included an interim council of
ministers dominated by blacks with a British
appointed chairman and British control of
Rhodesia's police and military during the transi
tion, the sources said.
Richard said the Geneva talks, now scheduled
to resume Jan. 17, could be delayed if problems
arise.
Following his meeting with Vorster, Richard
told reporters in Pretoria that he was dealing
with the leaders of all African states concerned
with Rhodesia. He and Vorster did not discuss
South Africa's economic influence on Rhodesia,
Richard said.
South Africa is Rhodesia's main trading part
ner and provides much of the arms for the con
tinuing guerrilla war against black nationalists
in Rhodesia, where 270,000 whites are outnum
bered almost 25-to-one by 6.4 million blacks.
Yoshimura mistrial ruling delayed
Oakland — The judge in the weapons posses
sion trial of Wendy Yoshimura yesterday post
poned for at least one day his ruling on a defense
motion to seek a mistrial.
Alameda County Superior Court Judge Martin
Pulich said he "wanted to study more cases"

before deciding whether prosecutor Jeffrey
Horner had prejudiced Yoshimura's defense by
mentioning tin; names of r.onvicted bank robber
Patricia Hearst and Ii«»r other underground com
panions.
Pulich said he was taking advantage of an
unexpected delay in tin: trial. Two jurors and
one alternate told court officials they could not
attend yesterday's session, two because of ill
ness and one because she was stranded in the
snow-bound Sierra.
If Pulich rejects defense attorney James Lar
son s request for a mistrial, defense testimony is
expected to begin immediately.
Prosecutor Jeff Horner rested his case just be
fore Christmas. Court was canceled last week
while Horner recovered from a bout with the flu.
Larson had objected to Horner mentioning
Hearst and Symbionese Liberation Army mem
bers William and Emily Harris as Yoshimura's
associates while a fugitive.
Nixon: inauguration guest?
Plains, Ga. — President-elect Jimmy Carter
has invited former President Richard Nixon,
who resigned in disgrace because of Watergate,
to his inauguration, Carter's spokesman said
yesterday.
Press Secretary Jody Powell said there has
been no indication whether Nixon and his fam
ily will attend the Jan. 20 inauguration cere
monies on the Capitol steps in Washington.
"It has been true without fail that traditionally
former Presidents and former First Ladies are
invited to a new president's inauguration,"
Powell said.

Nixon: inauguration guest?
Plains, Ga. — President-elect Jimmy Carter
has invited former President Richard Nixon,
who resigned in disgrace because of Watergate,
to his inauguration, Carter's spokesman said
yesterday.
Press Secretary Jody Powell said there has
been no indication whether Nixon and his fam

monies on the Capitol steps in Washington.
"It has been true without fail that traditionally
former Presidents and former First Ladies are
invited to a new president's inauguration,"
Powell said.
Language barrier hampers rescue
Chicago — Chicago's fire chief said yesterday
he would ask — but not order — every one of the
city's 4600 firemen to learn some basic Spanish
after 26 persons died in three fires in Latin
neighborhoods over the year-end holidays.
Community leaders in the Spanish-speaking
neighborhoods had complained that a language
barrier hampered rescue efforts.
Fire Commissioner Robert Quinn also said he
will immediately transfer a Spanish-speaking
firefighter to work with residents of the Pilsen
area, where 17 persons, including 13 children,
died in two holiday fires.
Quinn made the announcements after meet
ing for more than an hour with representatives of
the Pilsen Neighbors Community Council.
Raquel Guerrero, a spokeswoman for the
community council, told Quinn, "We must see
an end to people dying needlessly because we
lack Spanish-speaking firefighters, proper fire
fighting equipment and effective fire
prevention programs."
The city has only nine firefighters with
Spanish surnames, Quinn said. Allegations of a
hiring bias in the department are before a federal
court.

Byrd, Griffin favored for posts
Washington — Supporters of Sen. Robert
Byrd of West Virginia expressed confidence yes
terday that he will win election as Senate Demo
cratic leader by a comfortable margin.
But an aide of Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Min
nesota, Byrd's only remaining rival for Senate
majority leader in the new Congress convening
today, talked of a possible upset victory.
Republican senators will elect a new minority
leader, with Sen. Robert Griffin of Michigan the
only avowed candidate but with Sen. Howard
Baker Jr. of Tennessee acting like a candidate.
Jockeying for the top leadership posts inten
sified as senators gathered for the opening gavel
of the 95th Congress.
House members already have chosen their
leaders, but in the Senate party caucuses were to
be held this morning to settle the contests for
leadership posts.
Byrd, the Democratic whip, or assistant
leader, since he ousted Sen. Edward Kennedy
from the post in 1971, has been the acknow
ledged frontrunner to succeed Mike Mansfield
of Montana as majority leader.
Sens. Edmund Muskie of Maine and Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina have previously
dropped out of the race.
David Gartner, Humphrey's administrative
assistant, said the secret balloting at the party
caucus is the key to the outcome. He said two or
three senators, whom he declined to name, have
told Humphrey they will vote for him even
though they are publicly committed to Byrd.
The majority leadership post is open because
of Mansfield's retirement from the Senate. Sen.
Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, the GOP leader in
the last Congress, also retired.
Baker was the only senator maneuvering to
challenge Griffin, the GOP whip since 1969, for
election to succeed Scott. Baker, however, re
fused to say if his name would be presented at
the party conference.
He indicated it all would depend on how his
chances of winning look.
Chinese killed hundreds in Oct. riot
Bonn — Communist radicals armed with
spears, axes and some guns rebelled in the rice
growing province of Szechwan and "many hun
dreds, if not thousands" of people were killed
before the uprising was crushed, according to a
West German news report.
The news agency DPA said in a dispatch from
Peking that the rebellion by supporters of
Chiang Ching, purged widow of Mao Tse-tung,
apparently occurred before Chiang and the three
other members of the radical "Gang of Four"
were arrested last October.
Quoting Chinese sources, the agency said un
rest was still continuing in some sections of
China, although the most serious strife had en
ded.
The Szechwan disturbances were the
bloodiest reported thus far in the unfolding story
of civil disorder that spread through China last
year, apparently climaxing with the ouster of the
radical leadership one month after the death of
party Chairman Mao on Sept. 9.

China's vice premier, Li Hsien Nien, referred
to the unrest in a toast at a dinner for the visiting
leader of Bangladesh, Ziaur Rahman, the Yugos
lav news agency Tanjug reported from Peking
yesterday.
Tanjug said Li mentioned "violent unrest fol
lowing the death of Mao Tse-tung" but did not
say when or where it had occurred. Li indicated
that the current situation was stable, the agency
said.
But DPA reported: "The government and
army still have the task of liquidating the widely
dispersed rebellion."
Bell generally opposed to busing
Washington — Attorney General-designate
Griffin Bell said yesterday he believes busing
should be used to desegregate urban schools
only in rare cases.
"I think it upsets Americans to take children
away from their neighborhoods," Bell told a
news conference. "1 think neighborhood schools
are preferable, all other things being equal."
But Bell said busing may be needed to de
segregate some school systems and protect the
constitutional rights of minority children.
"In time," he continued, "we will have integ
rated housing. But you can't wait on desegre
gated schools until that day comes, so you have
to use busing as part of the remedy.
"I think there's going to be some school dis
tricts where busing will be employed as a last
resort."
Bell outlined his views on busing when he
was asked whether he contemplates any change
in Justice Department policy on the issue if he is
confirmed as attorney general.
His reply generally follows the current de
partment policy which is to support only the
extent of busing necessary to correct the dis
crimination caused by official acts of school
boards and other government agencies.
Fund loans British $3.9 billion
Washington — The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved a standby arrangement
yesterday authorizing Great Britain to borrow up
to $3.9 billion over the next 24 months.
The British had applied for the loan in October
in an effort to bolster their sagging economy and
to try and halt the slide in value of the pound
relative to other currencies.
IMF staffers and officials have been studying
the British economic situation since then in an
effort to assure that the nation would be able to
repay the money.
Last month, British Chancellor of the Ex
chequer Denis Healey announced a series of
measures designed to hold down inflation and
cut government borrowing so that it would be
better able to comply with any stipulations re
lated to the IMF loan.
The program outlined by Healey involved two
years of holding down government spending by
some two billion pounds — about $3.4 billion —
while at the same time levying only a few small
increases in taxes.
The British proposal had been hailed at the
outset by U.S. Treasury Secretary William Si

mon, member of the IMF board and one of those
responsible for voting approval of the credit.
The $3.9 billion loan is the fourth big credit
extended on Britain's behalf in about a year.
Major trading partners set up a standby $5.3
billion credit for Great Britain in June, and the
IMF set up loans of $800 million in June and
$1.17 billion in December, 1975.
But much of the credit extended in June ex
pired last month, so that some of the new loan
presumably would be used to pay off the earlier
debt.
Under the standby arrangement, the British
authorities will be authorized to draw an
amount equivalent to $1.16 billion immediately.
Total credit is not to exceed the equivalent of
$2.26 billion over the first 12 months.
To finance the credit the fund will borrow the
equivalent of $2.97 billion from eight particip
ants in the fund.
Rhodesian changeover planned
Port Elizabeth, South Africa — British envoy
Ivor Richard met yesterday with Prime Minister
John Vorster on a transition to black rule in
neighboring Rhodesia and called the talks "use
ful, helpful and constructive."
Richard, chairman of negotiations between
black and white Rhodesian leaders in Geneva,
said "we agreed to meet again in about 10 days
time."
Vorster had little comment for reporters ex
cept to say he had not been in touch with Rhode
sian Prime Minister lan Smith over the weekend
and did not plan to meet with him.
Richard was glum after talks with Smith on
Saturday but appeared more cheerful after his
meeting with Vorster near the south coastal city
of Port Elizabeth.
Rhodesian sources said Smith rejected
Richard's proposals for a direct British role in an
interim Rhodesian government leading to black
majority rule by March 1978.
The proposals included an interim council of
ministers dominated by blacks with a British
appointed chairman and British control of
Rhodesia's police and military during the transi
tion, the sources said.
Richard said the Geneva talks, now scheduled
to resume Jan. 17, could be delayed if problems
arise.
Following his meeting with Vorster, Richard
told reporters in Pretoria that he was dealing
with the leaders of all African states concerned
with Rhodesia. He and Vorster did not discuss
South Africa's economic influence on Rhodesia,
Richard said.
South Africa is Rhodesia's main trading part
ner and provides much of the arms for the con
tinuing guerrilla war against black nationalists
in Rhodesia, where 270,000 whites are outnum
bered almost 25-to-one by 6.4 million blacks.
Yoshimura mistrial ruling delayed
Oakland — The judge in the weapons posses
sion trial of Wendy Yoshimura yesterday post
poned for at least one day his ruling on a defense
motion to seek a mistrial.
Alameda County Superior Court Judge Martin
Pulich said he "wanted to study more cases"

before deciding whether prosecutor Jeffrey
Horner had prejudiced Yoshimura's defense by
mentioning tin; names of r.onvicted bank robber
Patricia Hearst and Ii«»r other underground com
panions.
Pulich said he was taking advantage of an
unexpected delay in tin: trial. Two jurors and
one alternate told court officials they could not
attend yesterday's session, two because of ill
ness and one because she was stranded in the
snow-bound Sierra.
If Pulich rejects defense attorney James Lar
son s request for a mistrial, defense testimony is
expected to begin immediately.
Prosecutor Jeff Horner rested his case just be
fore Christmas. Court was canceled last week
while Horner recovered from a bout with the flu.
Larson had objected to Horner mentioning
Hearst and Symbionese Liberation Army mem

Nixon: inauguration guest?
Plains, Ga. — President-elect Jimmy Carter
has invited former President Richard Nixon,
who resigned in disgrace because of Watergate,
to his inauguration, Carter's spokesman said
yesterday.
Press Secretary Jody Powell said there has
been no indication whether Nixon and his fam
ily will attend the Jan. 20 inauguration cere
monies on the Capitol steps in Washington.
"It has been true without fail that traditionally
former Presidents and former First Ladies are
invited to a new president's inauguration,"
Powell said.
Language barrier hampers rescue
Chicago — Chicago's fire chief said yesterday
he would ask — but not order — every one of the
city's 4600 firemen to learn some basic Spanish
after 26 persons died in three fires in Latin
neighborhoods over the year-end holidays.
Community leaders in the Spanish-speaking
neighborhoods had complained that a language
barrier hampered rescue efforts.
Fire Commissioner Robert Quinn also said he
will immediately transfer a Spanish-speaking
firefighter to work with residents of the Pilsen
area, where 17 persons, including 13 children,
died in two holiday fires.
Quinn made the announcements after meet
ing for more than an hour with representatives of
the Pilsen Neighbors Community Council.
Raquel Guerrero, a spokeswoman for the
community council, told Quinn, "We must see
an end to people dying needlessly because we
lack Spanish-speaking firefighters, proper fire
fighting equipment and effective fire
prevention programs."
The city has only nine firefighters with
Spanish surnames, Quinn said. Allegations of a
hiring bias in the department are before a federal
court.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today. Fair tonight and tomor

Byrd, Griffin favored for posts
Washington — Supporters of Sen. Robert
Byrd of West Virginia expressed confidence yes
terday that he will win election as Senate Demo
cratic leader by a comfortable margin.
But an aide of Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Min
nesota, Byrd's only remaining rival for Senate
majority leader in the new Congress convening
today, talked of a possible upset victory.
Republican senators will elect a new minority
leader, with Sen. Robert Griffin of Michigan the
only avowed candidate but with Sen. Howard
Baker Jr. of Tennessee acting like a candidate.
Jockeying for the top leadership posts inten
sified as senators gathered for the opening gavel
of the 95th Congress.
House members already have chosen their
leaders, but in the Senate party caucuses were to
be held this morning to settle the contests for
leadership posts.
Byrd, the Democratic whip, or assistant
leader, since he ousted Sen. Edward Kennedy
from the post in 1971, has been the acknow
ledged frontrunner to succeed Mike Mansfield
of Montana as majority leader.
Sens. Edmund Muskie of Maine and Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina have previously
dropped out of the race.
David Gartner, Humphrey's administrative
assistant, said the secret balloting at the party
caucus is the key to the outcome. He said two or
three senators, whom he declined to name, have
told Humphrey they will vote for him even
though they are publicly committed to Byrd.
The majority leadership post is open because
of Mansfield's retirement from the Senate. Sen.
Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, the GOP leader in
the last Congress, also retired.
Baker was the only senator maneuvering to
challenge Griffin, the GOP whip since 1969, for
election to succeed Scott. Baker, however, re
fused to say if his name would be presented at
the party conference.
He indicated it all would depend on how his
chances of winning look.
Chinese killed hundreds in Oct. riot
Bonn — Communist radicals armed with
spears, axes and some guns rebelled in the rice
growing province of Szechwan and "many hun
dreds, if not thousands" of people were killed
before the uprising was crushed, according to a
West German news report.
The news agency DPA said in a dispatch from
Peking that the rebellion by supporters of
Chiang Ching, purged widow of Mao Tse-tung,
apparently occurred before Chiang and the three
other members of the radical "Gang of Four"
were arrested last October.
Quoting Chinese sources, the agency said un
rest was still continuing in some sections of
China, although the most serious strife had en
ded.
The Szechwan disturbances were the
bloodiest reported thus far in the unfolding story
of civil disorder that spread through China last
year, apparently climaxing with the ouster of the
radical leadership one month after the death of
party Chairman Mao on Sept. 9.

China's vice premier, Li Hsien Nien, referred
to the unrest in a toast at a dinner for the visiting
leader of Bangladesh, Ziaur Rahman, the Yugos
lav news agency Tanjug reported from Peking
yesterday.
Tanjug said Li mentioned "violent unrest fol
lowing the death of Mao Tse-tung" but did not
say when or where it had occurred. Li indicated
that the current situation was stable, the agency
said.
But DPA reported: "The government and
army still have the task of liquidating the widely
dispersed rebellion."
Bell generally opposed to busing
Washington — Attorney General-designate
Griffin Bell said yesterday he believes busing
should be used to desegregate urban schools
only in rare cases.
"I think it upsets Americans to take children
away from their neighborhoods," Bell told a
news conference. "1 think neighborhood schools
are preferable, all other things being equal."
But Bell said busing may be needed to de
segregate some school systems and protect the
constitutional rights of minority children.
"In time," he continued, "we will have integ
rated housing. But you can't wait on desegre
gated schools until that day comes, so you have
to use busing as part of the remedy.
"I think there's going to be some school dis
tricts where busing will be employed as a last
resort."
Bell outlined his views on busing when he
was asked whether he contemplates any change
in Justice Department policy on the issue if he is
confirmed as attorney general.
His reply generally follows the current de
partment policy which is to support only the
extent of busing necessary to correct the dis
crimination caused by official acts of school
boards and other government agencies.
Fund loans British $3.9 billion
Washington — The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved a standby arrangement
yesterday authorizing Great Britain to borrow up
to $3.9 billion over the next 24 months.
The British had applied for the loan in October
in an effort to bolster their sagging economy and
to try and halt the slide in value of the pound
relative to other currencies.
IMF staffers and officials have been studying
the British economic situation since then in an
effort to assure that the nation would be able to
repay the money.
Last month, British Chancellor of the Ex
chequer Denis Healey announced a series of
measures designed to hold down inflation and
cut government borrowing so that it would be
better able to comply with any stipulations re
lated to the IMF loan.
The program outlined by Healey involved two
years of holding down government spending by
some two billion pounds — about $3.4 billion —
while at the same time levying only a few small
increases in taxes.
The British proposal had been hailed at the
outset by U.S. Treasury Secretary William Si

mon, member of the IMF board and one of those
responsible for voting approval of the credit.
The $3.9 billion loan is the fourth big credit
extended on Britain's behalf in about a year.
Major trading partners set up a standby $5.3
billion credit for Great Britain in June, and the
IMF set up loans of $800 million in June and
$1.17 billion in December, 1975.
But much of the credit extended in June ex
pired last month, so that some of the new loan
presumably would be used to pay off the earlier
debt.
Under the standby arrangement, the British
authorities will be authorized to draw an
amount equivalent to $1.16 billion immediately.
Total credit is not to exceed the equivalent of
$2.26 billion over the first 12 months.
To finance the credit the fund will borrow the
equivalent of $2.97 billion from eight particip
ants in the fund.
Rhodesian changeover planned
Port Elizabeth, South Africa — British envoy
Ivor Richard met yesterday with Prime Minister
John Vorster on a transition to black rule in
neighboring Rhodesia and called the talks "use
ful, helpful and constructive."
Richard, chairman of negotiations between
black and white Rhodesian leaders in Geneva,
said "we agreed to meet again in about 10 days
time."
Vorster had little comment for reporters ex
cept to say he had not been in touch with Rhode
sian Prime Minister lan Smith over the weekend
and did not plan to meet with him.
Richard was glum after talks with Smith on
Saturday but appeared more cheerful after his
meeting with Vorster near the south coastal city
of Port Elizabeth.
Rhodesian sources said Smith rejected
Richard's proposals for a direct British role in an
interim Rhodesian government leading to black
majority rule by March 1978.
The proposals included an interim council of
ministers dominated by blacks with a British
appointed chairman and British control of
Rhodesia's police and military during the transi
tion, the sources said.
Richard said the Geneva talks, now scheduled
to resume Jan. 17, could be delayed if problems
arise.
Following his meeting with Vorster, Richard
told reporters in Pretoria that he was dealing
with the leaders of all African states concerned
with Rhodesia. He and Vorster did not discuss
South Africa's economic influence on Rhodesia,
Richard said.
South Africa is Rhodesia's main trading part
ner and provides much of the arms for the con
tinuing guerrilla war against black nationalists
in Rhodesia, where 270,000 whites are outnum
bered almost 25-to-one by 6.4 million blacks.
Yoshimura mistrial ruling delayed
Oakland — The judge in the weapons posses
sion trial of Wendy Yoshimura yesterday post
poned for at least one day his ruling on a defense
motion to seek a mistrial.
Alameda County Superior Court Judge Martin
Pulich said he "wanted to study more cases"

before deciding whether prosecutor Jeffrey
Horner had prejudiced Yoshimura's defense by
mentioning tin; names of r.onvicted bank robber
Patricia Hearst and Ii«»r other underground com
panions.
