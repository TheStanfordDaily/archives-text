# Tuition-remission:
## Letters here protest possible taxation 
### Doug Hyde Staff writer 
At least three letters from here and
hundreds of other letters nationwide
have been sent recently, in the hopes of
defeating the proposed Internal Re
venue Service (IRS) changes in the tax
status of tuition-remission programs at
various colleges and universities
throughout the country.
Public hearings dealing with the
proposed changes are to start in
Washington Friday.
The three Stanford letters — one
from the American Association of
University Professors (AAUP), one
from President Richard Lyman and
one from Prof. Byron Sher of the
Law School and chairman of the Se
nate Academic Council — strongly
support the present tax-exempt status
which has been in effect since 1954.
Tuition-remission programs, vary
ing at different colleges and univer
sities, give eligible faculty and staff
money for parts of their children's col
lege and university tuition. Here, such
benefits, never exceeding one half of
Stanford tuition per child, totaled
more than $1.1 million for 559 qual
ified students last year.
IRS action
Traditionally, both Congress and the
IRS have sanctioned these programs,
giving them tax-exempt status as
legitimate scholarship programs. On
Nov. 2 of last year, the IRS proposed to
remove this sanction.
The three letters attack similar
points in the proposed change. Lyman
wrote that, "this issue should be refer
red to the Congress for study and
should not be resolved on the basis of
administrative judgements."
Sher wrote that "the appearance of
arbitrariness, of unwillingness to
submit for legislative determination
what has been believed by all to be in
the legislative arena for more than 20
years, is inescapable."
The AAUP letter noted that "Con
gress has not expressed any desire to
make the change." and that "the prop
riety of IRS reversing a public policy
unilaterally can be questioned."
'No financial return*
In addition, both the AAUP letter
and Lyman's letter indicated that "the
IRS has not shown that the change
would bring any substantial financial
return," according to the AAUP.
Said Lyman, "It is virtually certain
that the loss to individuals and to in
stitutions — both in dollars and in
their confidence in a system in which
long-sanctioned expectations can be
reversed overnight — will exceed anv

possible gain to the Treasury."
A similar IRS proposal, covering
worker benefits such as airline ticket
discounts for airline employes, etc.,
was dropped just before Christmas
after the IRS was severely criticized.
However, the IRS did not drop the
tuition-remission proposal.
