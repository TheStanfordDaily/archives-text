# U.C. tightens up on basic English
## 
### George Anders 
In an effort to reduce enrollment in
"bonehead" English courses, Univer
sity of California schools decided last
week to tighten their English require
ment for freshman applicants. How
ever, no such action is planned here,
according to Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon.
The UC schools, which require
freshman applicants to have three
yearsofhigh school English, ruled that
journalism, drama and speech classes
generally will no longer be accepted in
place of English. This policy takes ef
fect in June.
Here, "we don't have specific re
quirements" for subjects, Hargadon
said. However, he said offhand that he
believes most undergraduates here did
have at least three years of high school
English.
Nancy Packer, director of freshman
English, questioned the UC decision.
"It doesn't make sense," she said, that
students who substitute drama, jour
nalism or speech courses for English
would be ones who most need reme
dial English.
Those students "select these in
terests because they think their writing
skills are pretty good," she explained.
Weaker skills
Lyle Gainsley, director of admis
sions for the UC system, said, though,
that he presumed students without
three years of high school English
would have weaker writing skills.
The UC schools seek to remedy what
Gainsley termed "a general incompe
tence in handling language," by offer
ing a non-credit, remedial English
course called "Subject A."
Students who score below 600 on

the College Entrance Examination
Board's English Composition Test or
who flunk a test given by the UC
schools must take "Subject A." About
half the UC students take "Subject A,"
Gainsley estimated.
No 'Bonehead' English
Packer said the freshman English
program here "does a lot of things be
sides teaching remedial English. We
don't have 'bonehead' English."
She noted students must score above
700 on the English Composition Test
and pass a Stanford exam to place out
of freshman English. Such factors as
more rigorous testing make little com
parison possible between the Stanford
and UC programs, Packer said.
While Packer said there is no pres
sure to reduce the number of students
in the freshman writing program.
Gainsley said he would like to see
fewer students needing to take "Sub
ject A."
Other measures
The UC schools are considering
other measures to insure that accepted
students will be more competent in
handling language, Gainsley said.
These include requiring a fourth
year of high school English, describing
what areas must be covered within
these English courses, and urging that
a statewide writing test be given to
high school juniors.
Hargadon said the university is con
sidering none of these measures. He
said a statewide test would be expen
sive to administer and might be
changed too frequently to be useful.
Instead, Hargadon said he favors es
tablishing a diagnostic test of writing
skills to be given at about the ninth
grade level.
