# Construction boom
## Buildings sprout when cash lies about 
### Pan Demetrekakes Staff writer 
It's getting so you can't throw a
stone here without hitting a con
struction site.
The departments of engineering,
chemistry, computer science and
anatomy are getting new buildings.
So is the Hoover Institution. The
Stanford Hospital and the
bookstore are expanding. The Main
Library will also be extended this
month, if all goes well. TheHistory
and Geology Corners of the quad
will be renovated. Three new dor
mitories were opened this fall.
Why this building boom?
Assoc. Provost Edward Shaw is
uncomfortable with the term
"building boom."
"The so-called 'boom' is a con
solidation of the physical plant," he
said. "We're making up for the de
ficiencies of the past."
Almost all academic departments
will benefit from the construction,
since schools with brand-new
buildings will leave their old struc
tures to other departments. For
example, when the School of En
gineering moves into the Terman
Building, it will leave its old build
ing to the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
"It's like checkers," Shaw said.
He added that the only two depart
ments that will still have unsatis
fied space needs after the boom will
he the music and microbiology de
partments.
Construction money
Availability of funds is also a fac
tor in the "building boom."
"The reason that construction is
coming in waves is that the financ
ing is coming in that manner," said
Master Planner Oscar Nelson Jr.

"We try to build as soon as possible
to beat inflation."
"A good part of the facilities
scheduling is tied to fund-raising
efforts," Shaw agreed. For example,
the Main Library expansion has
been planned since 1967, but the
university gave it the go-ahead only
after an anonymous donor contri
buted $6 million to the project in
November. And the Hoover build
ing was made possible by a recent
congressional guarantee of a loan
for $7.2 million.
Problems with finances
However, not all of the finances
resolve themselves so neatly. Al
though the Campaign for Stanford
fund-raising drive has brought in
$260 million over the last four
years, only one-third of that money
is slated for the new buildings. And
the federal money on which the
university used to depend dried up
under the Nixon and Ford ad
ministrations.
"In the sixties, the federal gov
ernment closed the gap between
what the donors gave and what was
needed." Shaw said. "Now we've
closed that gap with debt, and it's
been quite hurtful to us."
That debt has taken the form of
tax-exempt bonds issued under the
auspicies of the California Educa
tional Facilities Authority (CEFA),
an institution which the university
helped found in 1971. The univer
sity has sold $34 million worth of
the bonds in two issues; one with
25-year maturity and a 7.2 per cent
yield, and a mixed issue with pre
dominately eight-year maturity and
a 5.9 per cent yield. A third issue is
tentatively scheduled for spring of
1978.
"The bonds are similar to a home

mortgage," said Finance Director
Rodney Adams. "You pay off some
interest and some principal each
year."
These payments will total $10
million by 1983, according to
Adams. By the time the 25-year
bonds expire the university will
have paid out roughly $50 million
on the first two issues.
Most of the first two issues went
to pay for facilities that generate in
come, such as the housing system.
This income will be used to pay oft

the bonds. Those bonds that were
applied to academic buildings,
which do not generate income, will
be paid out of the university's
operating budget.
Shaw said it is not yet known
how deeply the university will ul
timately go into debt. There are two
criteria, he said. The debt must not
lower the university's Standard
and Poor's credit rating, which is
currently triple A, and housing fees
must not rise too sharplv.
Constructing a building is not the

only expense involved; it must also
be heated, lighted, powered and
maintained. The cumulative costs
for all the new buildings, according
to Management Analyst Larry
Owen, will be:
1977-78 $ 348.000
1978-79 1,002,000
1979-80 1,548,000
1980-81 1,814,000
"It's a tradeoff," said Kent Peter
son, director of management and
financial planning. "If the Dean of

Humanities and Sciences wants a
new building, he makes a tradeoff
between that and a new position."
However, he may not be the only
one making a tradeoff, according to
Roger Hardy, president of the Un
ited Stanford Employees union.
"It's easy enough to say, 'I'm
gonna build a $7 million building.'
But the heat, power and mainte
nance for that building come out of
the same pot of money that pays our
salaries," Hardy said.
One would think Hardy would be
happy, with all the construction
jobs new buildings generate. The
trouble is that university workers
do not have any of those jobs.
"We could be involved in it,"
Hardy said. "We have journeymen,
electricians, locksmiths and
mechanics."
There are two problems, accord
ing to both Hardy and Plant Ser
vices Director Jason Mavis. In the
first place, once a construction job
was over, the workers involved in it
would have to be laid off. "That
doesn't make for good employe re
lations," Mavis said.
In the second place, there just
aren't enough Plant Services work
ers to handle construction and
maintenance, too.
In fact, Hardy raised doubts that
Plant Services will be able to keep
up just with the added maintenance
workload. There are no plans to hire
new maintenance workers, accord
ing to Peterson.

since schools with brand-new
buildings will leave their old struc
tures to other departments. For
example, when the School of En
gineering moves into the Terman
Building, it will leave its old build
ing to the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
"It's like checkers," Shaw said.
He added that the only two depart
ments that will still have unsatis
fied space needs after the boom will
he the music and microbiology de
partments.
Construction money
Availability of funds is also a fac
tor in the "building boom."
"The reason that construction is
coming in waves is that the financ
ing is coming in that manner," said
Master Planner Oscar Nelson Jr.

"We try to build as soon as possible
to beat inflation."
"A good part of the facilities
scheduling is tied to fund-raising
efforts," Shaw agreed. For example,
the Main Library expansion has
been planned since 1967, but the
university gave it the go-ahead only
after an anonymous donor contri
buted $6 million to the project in
November. And the Hoover build
ing was made possible by a recent
congressional guarantee of a loan
for $7.2 million.
Problems with finances
However, not all of the finances
resolve themselves so neatly. Al
though the Campaign for Stanford
fund-raising drive has brought in
$260 million over the last four
years, only one-third of that money
is slated for the new buildings. And
the federal money on which the
university used to depend dried up
under the Nixon and Ford ad
ministrations.
"In the sixties, the federal gov
ernment closed the gap between
what the donors gave and what was
needed." Shaw said. "Now we've
closed that gap with debt, and it's
been quite hurtful to us."
That debt has taken the form of
tax-exempt bonds issued under the
auspicies of the California Educa
tional Facilities Authority (CEFA),
an institution which the university
helped found in 1971. The univer
sity has sold $34 million worth of
the bonds in two issues; one with
25-year maturity and a 7.2 per cent
yield, and a mixed issue with pre
dominately eight-year maturity and
a 5.9 per cent yield. A third issue is
tentatively scheduled for spring of
1978.
"The bonds are similar to a home

mortgage," said Finance Director
Rodney Adams. "You pay off some
interest and some principal each
year."
These payments will total $10
million by 1983, according to
Adams. By the time the 25-year
bonds expire the university will
have paid out roughly $50 million
on the first two issues.
Most of the first two issues went
to pay for facilities that generate in
come, such as the housing system.
This income will be used to pay oft

the bonds. Those bonds that were
applied to academic buildings,
which do not generate income, will
be paid out of the university's
operating budget.
Shaw said it is not yet known
how deeply the university will ul
timately go into debt. There are two
criteria, he said. The debt must not
lower the university's Standard
and Poor's credit rating, which is
currently triple A, and housing fees
must not rise too sharplv.
Constructing a building is not the

only expense involved; it must also
be heated, lighted, powered and
maintained. The cumulative costs
for all the new buildings, according
to Management Analyst Larry
Owen, will be:
1977-78 $ 348.000
1978-79 1,002,000
1979-80 1,548,000
1980-81 1,814,000
"It's a tradeoff," said Kent Peter
son, director of management and
financial planning. "If the Dean of

Humanities and Sciences wants a
new building, he makes a tradeoff
between that and a new position."
However, he may not be the only
one making a tradeoff, according to
Roger Hardy, president of the Un
ited Stanford Employees union.
"It's easy enough to say, 'I'm
gonna build a $7 million building.'
But the heat, power and mainte
nance for that building come out of
the same pot of money that pays our
salaries," Hardy said.
One would think Hardy would be
happy, with all the construction
jobs new buildings generate. The
trouble is that university workers
do not have any of those jobs.
"We could be involved in it,"
Hardy said. "We have journeymen,
electricians, locksmiths and
mechanics."
There are two problems, accord
ing to both Hardy and Plant Ser
vices Director Jason Mavis. In the
first place, once a construction job
was over, the workers involved in it
would have to be laid off. "That
doesn't make for good employe re
lations," Mavis said.
In the second place, there just
aren't enough Plant Services work
ers to handle construction and
maintenance, too.
In fact, Hardy raised doubts that
Plant Services will be able to keep
up just with the added maintenance
workload. There are no plans to hire
new maintenance workers, accord
ing to Peterson.
It's getting so you can't throw a
stone here without hitting a con
struction site.
The departments of engineering,
chemistry, computer science and
anatomy are getting new buildings.
So is the Hoover Institution. The
Stanford Hospital and the
bookstore are expanding. The Main
Library will also be extended this
month, if all goes well. TheHistory
and Geology Corners of the quad

efforts," Shaw agreed. For example,
the Main Library expansion has
been planned since 1967, but the
university gave it the go-ahead only
after an anonymous donor contri
buted $6 million to the project in
November. And the Hoover build
ing was made possible by a recent
congressional guarantee of a loan
for $7.2 million.
Problems with finances
However, not all of the finances
resolve themselves so neatly. Al
though the Campaign for Stanford
fund-raising drive has brought in
$260 million over the last four
years, only one-third of that money
is slated for the new buildings. And
the federal money on which the
university used to depend dried up
under the Nixon and Ford ad
ministrations.
"In the sixties, the federal gov
ernment closed the gap between
what the donors gave and what was
needed." Shaw said. "Now we've
closed that gap with debt, and it's
been quite hurtful to us."
That debt has taken the form of
tax-exempt bonds issued under the
auspicies of the California Educa
tional Facilities Authority (CEFA),
an institution which the university
helped found in 1971. The univer
sity has sold $34 million worth of
the bonds in two issues; one with
25-year maturity and a 7.2 per cent
yield, and a mixed issue with pre
dominately eight-year maturity and
a 5.9 per cent yield. A third issue is
tentatively scheduled for spring of
1978.
"The bonds are similar to a home

mortgage," said Finance Director
Rodney Adams. "You pay off some
interest and some principal each
year."
These payments will total $10
million by 1983, according to
Adams. By the time the 25-year
bonds expire the university will
have paid out roughly $50 million
on the first two issues.
Most of the first two issues went
to pay for facilities that generate in
come, such as the housing system.
This income will be used to pay oft

the bonds. Those bonds that were
applied to academic buildings,
which do not generate income, will
be paid out of the university's
operating budget.
Shaw said it is not yet known
how deeply the university will ul
timately go into debt. There are two
criteria, he said. The debt must not
lower the university's Standard
and Poor's credit rating, which is
currently triple A, and housing fees
must not rise too sharplv.
Constructing a building is not the

only expense involved; it must also
be heated, lighted, powered and
maintained. The cumulative costs
for all the new buildings, according
to Management Analyst Larry
Owen, will be:
1977-78 $ 348.000
1978-79 1,002,000
1979-80 1,548,000
1980-81 1,814,000
"It's a tradeoff," said Kent Peter
son, director of management and
financial planning. "If the Dean of

Humanities and Sciences wants a
new building, he makes a tradeoff
between that and a new position."
However, he may not be the only
one making a tradeoff, according to
Roger Hardy, president of the Un
ited Stanford Employees union.
"It's easy enough to say, 'I'm
gonna build a $7 million building.'
But the heat, power and mainte
nance for that building come out of
the same pot of money that pays our
salaries," Hardy said.
One would think Hardy would be
happy, with all the construction
jobs new buildings generate. The
trouble is that university workers
do not have any of those jobs.
"We could be involved in it,"
Hardy said. "We have journeymen,
electricians, locksmiths and
mechanics."
There are two problems, accord
ing to both Hardy and Plant Ser
vices Director Jason Mavis. In the
first place, once a construction job
was over, the workers involved in it
would have to be laid off. "That
doesn't make for good employe re
lations," Mavis said.
In the second place, there just
aren't enough Plant Services work
ers to handle construction and
maintenance, too.
In fact, Hardy raised doubts that
Plant Services will be able to keep
up just with the added maintenance
workload. There are no plans to hire
new maintenance workers, accord
ing to Peterson.
It's getting so you can't throw a
stone here without hitting a con
struction site.
The departments of engineering,
chemistry, computer science and
anatomy are getting new buildings.
So is the Hoover Institution. The
Stanford Hospital and the
bookstore are expanding. The Main
Library will also be extended this
month, if all goes well. TheHistory
and Geology Corners of the quad
will be renovated. Three new dor
mitories were opened this fall.
Why this building boom?
Assoc. Provost Edward Shaw is
uncomfortable with the term
"building boom."
"The so-called 'boom' is a con
solidation of the physical plant," he
said. "We're making up for the de
ficiencies of the past."
Almost all academic departments
will benefit from the construction,
since schools with brand-new
buildings will leave their old struc
tures to other departments. For
example, when the School of En
gineering moves into the Terman
Building, it will leave its old build
ing to the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
"It's like checkers," Shaw said.
He added that the only two depart
ments that will still have unsatis
fied space needs after the boom will
he the music and microbiology de
partments.
Construction money
Availability of funds is also a fac
tor in the "building boom."
"The reason that construction is
coming in waves is that the financ
ing is coming in that manner," said
Master Planner Oscar Nelson Jr.

"We try to build as soon as possible
to beat inflation."
"A good part of the facilities
scheduling is tied to fund-raising
efforts," Shaw agreed. For example,
the Main Library expansion has
been planned since 1967, but the
