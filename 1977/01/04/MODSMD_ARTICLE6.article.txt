## U.S. should allow Panama to decide its own fate 
### 
Tim Cullinane

In his recent tour of the Bay Area
sponsored by the U.S. Committee for
Justice for Latin American Political
Prisoners, Miguel Antonio Bernal pub
licized conditions in his home coun
try, Panama. The United States has
been negotiating a new treaty for con
trol of the Panama Canal with the
military regime of General Omar Tor
rijos.
Torrijos, despite all of his de
mogagic rhetoric to the contrary,
wants to let the United States keep the
Canal Zone. Washington decided
many years ago to make Panama its
main military staging ground for at
tacking revolution (and even reform)
throughout Latin America.
The invasion of Santo Domingo by
U.S. marines began from here; Green
Berets were trained at simulated Viet
namese villages built in the Zone; the
people who assassinated Che Guevera
in Bolivia were trained here.
Military bases
There are 14 military bases, several
anti-guerrilla centers (which teach riot
control, assassination and sabotage),
and between 10,000 and 20,000
American troops in Panama.
But, probably most important, al
most all the leading functionaries in
the military dictatorships throughout
Latin America were trained in this
area.
Besides being the headquarters of
the U.S. military threat to Latin
America, Panama is the site oi a "little
Wall Street." Many corporations with
extensive holding in the Americas
have regional offices in Panama. The
economy is totally tied to the United
States. The constitution put into effect
by Torrijos in 1972 forbids the issuing
of currency; only the U.S. dollar can be
used.
The Panamanian people have long
fought against the American presence
and domination of their country, and
many demonstrations demanded total
American withdrawal. They were
often met by American troops who
took control to "restore order." At
times, as a punitive measure, the Un
ited States has cut off the water supply
to Panama City, and has also cut access

to the zone, thus isolating the two parts
of the country separated by the zone.
Rhetoric
Thus, if Torrijos was to retain some
semblance of popular support, he had
to use very radical-sounding rhetoric
that would mirror the legitimate aspi
rations of the people. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger knows this and al
lows it to continue because he knows
Torrijos will work out a canal treaty
favorable to Washington.
He knows this because Torrijos is
dependent on economic aid from the
United States and from such U.S.-
dominated institutions as the Interna
tional Monetary Fund. President-elect
Jimmy Carter and Secretary of State
designate Vance will follow the same
course as President Gerald Ford and
Kissinger, trying to keep land that be
longs to the Panamanian people.
Right now, Kissinger and Torrijos
are both saying that guerrilla warfare is
inevitable, unless they quickly get a
treaty favorable to the United States.
This is just an attempt to threaten the
people of Panama into accepting the
U.S. presence and provide an excuse
for more massive repression, should it
be needed later.
Reply
Bernal replied to this charge by say
ing that "no revolutionary left organi
zation in Panama ... is currently
proposing guerrilla warfare to regain
the canal. We are not stupid; we are not
going to provide the imperialists with
canon fodder to recover something
that is ours."
But when the people turn against
Torrijos as they did in anti
government demonstrations protest
ing arbitrary food price increases this
September, Torrijos will not hesitate to
use his U.S.-trained and -equipped
troops (increased from 3000 in 1968 to
12,000 today) to crush the de
monstrators. The true nature of his
"populist" regime was revealed when
special riot police appeared and used
dogs, tear gas and beatings to break up
demonstrations.
Another attack
These price increases were another
attack by the Torrijos regime on the

people of Panama. Torrijos presides
over a lack of democratic rights, a high
cost of living, with over 80,000 un
employed and government control
over the trade unions which is sup
ported by the pro-Moscow Communist
party. The people of Panama can solve
these problems only by instituting
socialism in their country.
Whatever the people of Panama de
cide, we here in the United States have
a very important task in getting the
United States out of Panama so the
Panamanian people can decide their
own fate. The United States has no
right to have troops in Panama, as it
had no right to have troops in Vietnam.
We must demand that the United
States get out of Panama and stop col
laborating, openly or secretly, with the
repressive Torrijos regime.

Right now, Kissinger and Torrijos
are both saying that guerrilla warfare is
inevitable, unless they quickly get a
treaty favorable to the United States.
This is just an attempt to threaten the
people of Panama into accepting the
U.S. presence and provide an excuse
for more massive repression, should it
be needed later.

Bernal replied to this charge by say
ing that "no revolutionary left organi
zation in Panama ... is currently
proposing guerrilla warfare to regain
the canal. We are not stupid; we are not
going to provide the imperialists with
canon fodder to recover something
that is ours."
But when the people turn against
Torrijos as they did in anti
government demonstrations protest
ing arbitrary food price increases this
September, Torrijos will not hesitate to
use his U.S.-trained and -equipped
troops (increased from 3000 in 1968 to
12,000 today) to crush the de
monstrators. The true nature of his
"populist" regime was revealed when
special riot police appeared and used
dogs, tear gas and beatings to break up
demonstrations.
Another attack
These price increases were another
attack by the Torrijos regime on the

people of Panama. Torrijos presides
over a lack of democratic rights, a high
cost of living, with over 80,000 un
employed and government control
over the trade unions which is sup
ported by the pro-Moscow Communist
party. The people of Panama can solve
these problems only by instituting
socialism in their country.
Whatever the people of Panama de
cide, we here in the United States have
a very important task in getting the
United States out of Panama so the
Panamanian people can decide their
own fate. The United States has no
right to have troops in Panama, as it
had no right to have troops in Vietnam.
We must demand that the United
States get out of Panama and stop col
laborating, openly or secretly, with the
repressive Torrijos regime.

In his recent tour of the Bay Area
sponsored by the U.S. Committee for
Justice for Latin American Political
Prisoners, Miguel Antonio Bernal pub
licized conditions in his home coun
try, Panama. The United States has
been negotiating a new treaty for con
trol of the Panama Canal with the
military regime of General Omar Tor
rijos.
Torrijos, despite all of his de
mogagic rhetoric to the contrary,
wants to let the United States keep the
Canal Zone. Washington decided
many years ago to make Panama its
main military staging ground for at
tacking revolution (and even reform)
throughout Latin America.
The invasion of Santo Domingo by
U.S. marines began from here; Green
Berets were trained at simulated Viet
namese villages built in the Zone; the
people who assassinated Che Guevera
in Bolivia were trained here.
Military bases
There are 14 military bases, several
anti-guerrilla centers (which teach riot
control, assassination and sabotage),
and between 10,000 and 20,000
American troops in Panama.
But, probably most important, al
most all the leading functionaries in
the military dictatorships throughout
Latin America were trained in this
area.
Besides being the headquarters of
the U.S. military threat to Latin
America, Panama is the site oi a "little
Wall Street." Many corporations with
extensive holding in the Americas
have regional offices in Panama. The
economy is totally tied to the United
States. The constitution put into effect
by Torrijos in 1972 forbids the issuing
of currency; only the U.S. dollar can be
used.
The Panamanian people have long
fought against the American presence
and domination of their country, and
many demonstrations demanded total
American withdrawal. They were
often met by American troops who
took control to "restore order." At
times, as a punitive measure, the Un
ited States has cut off the water supply
to Panama City, and has also cut access

to the zone, thus isolating the two parts
of the country separated by the zone.
Rhetoric
Thus, if Torrijos was to retain some
semblance of popular support, he had
to use very radical-sounding rhetoric
that would mirror the legitimate aspi
rations of the people. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger knows this and al
lows it to continue because he knows
Torrijos will work out a canal treaty
favorable to Washington.
He knows this because Torrijos is
dependent on economic aid from the
United States and from such U.S.-
dominated institutions as the Interna
tional Monetary Fund. President-elect
Jimmy Carter and Secretary of State
designate Vance will follow the same
course as President Gerald Ford and
Kissinger, trying to keep land that be
longs to the Panamanian people.

U.S. marines began from here; Green
Berets were trained at simulated Viet
namese villages built in the Zone; the
people who assassinated Che Guevera
in Bolivia were trained here.
Military bases
There are 14 military bases, several
anti-guerrilla centers (which teach riot
control, assassination and sabotage),
and between 10,000 and 20,000
American troops in Panama.
But, probably most important, al
most all the leading functionaries in
the military dictatorships throughout
Latin America were trained in this
area.
Besides being the headquarters of
the U.S. military threat to Latin
America, Panama is the site oi a "little
Wall Street." Many corporations with
extensive holding in the Americas
have regional offices in Panama. The
economy is totally tied to the United
States. The constitution put into effect
by Torrijos in 1972 forbids the issuing
of currency; only the U.S. dollar can be
used.
The Panamanian people have long
fought against the American presence
and domination of their country, and
many demonstrations demanded total
American withdrawal. They were
often met by American troops who
took control to "restore order." At
times, as a punitive measure, the Un
ited States has cut off the water supply
to Panama City, and has also cut access

to the zone, thus isolating the two parts
of the country separated by the zone.
Rhetoric
Thus, if Torrijos was to retain some
semblance of popular support, he had
to use very radical-sounding rhetoric
that would mirror the legitimate aspi
rations of the people. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger knows this and al
lows it to continue because he knows
Torrijos will work out a canal treaty
favorable to Washington.
He knows this because Torrijos is
dependent on economic aid from the
United States and from such U.S.-
dominated institutions as the Interna
tional Monetary Fund. President-elect
Jimmy Carter and Secretary of State
designate Vance will follow the same
course as President Gerald Ford and
Kissinger, trying to keep land that be
longs to the Panamanian people.
Right now, Kissinger and Torrijos
are both saying that guerrilla warfare is
inevitable, unless they quickly get a
treaty favorable to the United States.
This is just an attempt to threaten the
people of Panama into accepting the
U.S. presence and provide an excuse
for more massive repression, should it
be needed later.
Reply
Bernal replied to this charge by say
ing that "no revolutionary left organi
zation in Panama ... is currently
proposing guerrilla warfare to regain
the canal. We are not stupid; we are not
going to provide the imperialists with
canon fodder to recover something
that is ours."
But when the people turn against
Torrijos as they did in anti
government demonstrations protest
ing arbitrary food price increases this
September, Torrijos will not hesitate to
use his U.S.-trained and -equipped
troops (increased from 3000 in 1968 to
12,000 today) to crush the de
monstrators. The true nature of his
"populist" regime was revealed when
special riot police appeared and used
dogs, tear gas and beatings to break up
demonstrations.
Another attack
These price increases were another
attack by the Torrijos regime on the

people of Panama. Torrijos presides
over a lack of democratic rights, a high
cost of living, with over 80,000 un
employed and government control
over the trade unions which is sup
ported by the pro-Moscow Communist
party. The people of Panama can solve
these problems only by instituting
socialism in their country.
Whatever the people of Panama de
cide, we here in the United States have
a very important task in getting the
United States out of Panama so the
Panamanian people can decide their
own fate. The United States has no
right to have troops in Panama, as it
had no right to have troops in Vietnam.
We must demand that the United
States get out of Panama and stop col
laborating, openly or secretly, with the
repressive Torrijos regime.
