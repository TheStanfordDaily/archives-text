# Taiwan repression claims misleading
## 
### 
Hsieh, Dun

We read with great interest a Daily
column on Dec. 1 headlined "Taiwan
regime steps up repression of dissi
dents." The author, David O'Connor,
was obviously ignorant or misin
formed. As graduated students born,
bred and brought up in Taiwan, Re
public of China, we have an incumbent
duty to tel 1 the truth — the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.
Based on an alleged telegram from
Amnesty International of Osaka, Ja
pan, O'Connor contends that some
"political dissidents" including Chen
et al. were "secretly tried" for "un
known reasons" and were sentenced
to death on Nov. 10 in Taiwan. It was
further alleged that "under public
pressure those political dissidents had
been retried," and Chen's sentence
was reduced to 15 years on Nov. 26.
Now the truth!
First of all, Prof. James Seymour,
spokesman for Amnesty International,
New York, has officially denied that
the alleged telegram of Nov. 17 was
ever sent by Amnesty International,
Osaka. It is obvious that O'Connor was
misinformed.
Public exposure
In the second place, contrary to
O'Connor's allegations, much public
exposure had in fact been given to this
incident. If the Taiwanese government
had intended it to be as secretive as the
author had suggested, we feel certain
that the world would not have read
about it in the Far East Economic He
view and the China News (Nov. 28).
The truth is that Chen had been tried
and sentenced for his proven activities
as a Chinese communist agent some
years ago. After his release in 1960,
Chen continued to work for the
Chinese communist cause.
Apart from a trip to Japan in 1974
and liaison with Chinese communist
agents operating there, Chen had since
that time been active in instigating,
indoctrinating and organizing ex
convicts in Taiwan.
Last summer, Chen and 12 of his as
sociates were finally arrested. During
the trial in which all suspects were
represented by counsel, charges
against five of the suspects were im
mediately dropped for insufficient
evidence.
However, seven suspects were
found guilty of developing "clandes
tine organizations in Taiwan to recruit
agents and plot armed revolt" under
instructions from the Chinese com
munist "embassy" and two named

underground Chinese communist
agents in Japan.
Communist propaganda
The Taiwanese government has re
vealed that 405 copies of communist
propaganda literature, eight record
tapes of Chinese communist broad
casts and a notebook containing ex
cerpts of Chinese communist cadre
training courses were seized and pre
sented as evidence in connection with
the trial.
It is therefore quite clear that the
case was certainly not one of "politi
cal" arrest. Those persons were not

sentenced secretly nor were they
charged for no reason.
According to O'Connor, Taiwan is
under more and more political repres
sion. In our opinion, political repres
sion, like democracy, is a matter of in
dividual interpretation. As we have
spent over 20 years in Taiwan, we can
assure you that O'Connor was wrong.
Quite on the contrary, our country
has become more and more democra
tic. For instance, over 150,000
businessmen from Taiwan travel all
over the world. Remember that even
Chen, who had proven communist af

filiations, had been permitted to travel
freely abroad. Additionally, some one
million tourists are attracted to Taiwan
every year.
In short, you may not like every
single thing you see in the Republic
of China, but you can be sure that you
have seen it all. We have an open and
safe society. Our country is not the
most perfect, but we are certainly try
ing our very best.

Amnesty International of Osaka, Ja
pan, O'Connor contends that some
"political dissidents" including Chen
et al. were "secretly tried" for "un
known reasons" and were sentenced
to death on Nov. 10 in Taiwan. It was
further alleged that "under public
pressure those political dissidents had
been retried," and Chen's sentence
was reduced to 15 years on Nov. 26.
Now the truth!
First of all, Prof. James Seymour,
spokesman for Amnesty International,
New York, has officially denied that
the alleged telegram of Nov. 17 was
ever sent by Amnesty International,
Osaka. It is obvious that O'Connor was
misinformed.
Public exposure
In the second place, contrary to
O'Connor's allegations, much public
exposure had in fact been given to this
incident. If the Taiwanese government
had intended it to be as secretive as the
author had suggested, we feel certain
that the world would not have read
about it in the Far East Economic He
view and the China News (Nov. 28).
The truth is that Chen had been tried
and sentenced for his proven activities
as a Chinese communist agent some
years ago. After his release in 1960,
Chen continued to work for the
Chinese communist cause.
Apart from a trip to Japan in 1974
and liaison with Chinese communist
agents operating there, Chen had since
that time been active in instigating,
indoctrinating and organizing ex
convicts in Taiwan.
Last summer, Chen and 12 of his as
sociates were finally arrested. During
the trial in which all suspects were
represented by counsel, charges
against five of the suspects were im
mediately dropped for insufficient
evidence.
However, seven suspects were
found guilty of developing "clandes
tine organizations in Taiwan to recruit
agents and plot armed revolt" under
instructions from the Chinese com
munist "embassy" and two named

underground Chinese communist
agents in Japan.
Communist propaganda
The Taiwanese government has re
vealed that 405 copies of communist
propaganda literature, eight record
tapes of Chinese communist broad
casts and a notebook containing ex
cerpts of Chinese communist cadre
training courses were seized and pre
sented as evidence in connection with
the trial.
It is therefore quite clear that the
case was certainly not one of "politi
cal" arrest. Those persons were not

sentenced secretly nor were they
charged for no reason.
According to O'Connor, Taiwan is
under more and more political repres
sion. In our opinion, political repres
sion, like democracy, is a matter of in
dividual interpretation. As we have
spent over 20 years in Taiwan, we can
assure you that O'Connor was wrong.
Quite on the contrary, our country
has become more and more democra
tic. For instance, over 150,000
businessmen from Taiwan travel all
over the world. Remember that even
Chen, who had proven communist af

filiations, had been permitted to travel
freely abroad. Additionally, some one
million tourists are attracted to Taiwan
every year.
In short, you may not like every
single thing you see in the Republic
of China, but you can be sure that you
have seen it all. We have an open and
safe society. Our country is not the
most perfect, but we are certainly try
ing our very best.
