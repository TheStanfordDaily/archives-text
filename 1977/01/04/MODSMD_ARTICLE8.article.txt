'Blatant sophistry'
The Daily of Dec. 2 and 3 carried
articles describing the refusal of the
university's administrative officers to
obey the law requiring that the salaries
of the university's officers be reported
on IRS Form 990. I was astonished
both by this refusal and by the defini
tion of "officers" as "officers of the
board of trustees" and of the president
and five vice presidents as "employes"
— a piece of blatant sophistry tised to
evade the law. TheFaculty Handbook,
1975, clearly defines the latter as
"Executive Officer" on pages 7-12.
The requirement is part of the Tax
Reforms Act of 1969. Its purpose is, as I
understand it, to enable members of
the public to make informed judg
ments about whether private organiza
tions ought to be exempt from taxes in
the light of salaries of officers, highest
paid employes, and highest paid par
ties hired for professional services.
Wherein lies the "injustice" of
which vice president Rosenzweig
speaks? Might not the undermining of
justice be better attributed to those
who refuse to obey a just law?
This act of non-compliance and its
rationale should be of particular con
cern to us because they are the most
recent manifestations of an on-going
hostility by the administration to reve
aling meaningful data about the
salaries of administrative officers and
members of the faculty.
In May the provost published mini
mally useful, general figures about
administrative salaries. A proposal
concerning faculty salaries is being
considered by a task force appointed

by the senate. I hope that the officers of
the university will now move, not only
to comply with the law, but also to
make available genuinely useful in
formation about other salaries in the
university.

'Basic and essential'
Richard Fearon's article (Daily, Dec.
1) on the Western Civilization re
quirement is to be commended for its
generally clear thinking and its
open-mindedness on the question of
requirements. But as a professor of
I rench, I can hardly be expected to
agree with the negative implications of
his question: "Why is it necessary that
all students have command of a
foreign language?"
I shall therefore attempt to state the
case for foreign languages briefly.
1. The purpose of foreign language
study is indeed to learn of a foreign
culture. But there can be no true know
ledge of another culture without the
language of that culture, for one re
flects the other. To study culture with
out language is to deprive the former of
one of its essential ingredients.
2. Language study is an aid in un
derstanding literature, for the finest
translation can never impart the flavor
of an original work.
3. An educated person has been de
fined as a citizen of the world, at home
in foreign lands. To communicate in
the language of a foreign country is to

establish an immediate bond of sym
pathy with people of other nations.
4. To study a foreign language shar
pens our awareness of verbal com
munication. While it is not true, to use
Fearon's example, that one will learn
English by studying Italian, one will
enhance one's English by so doing.
5. Exposure to a foreign language
can be a totally satisfying esthetic ex
perience. There is much truth in the
old cliches about the music of Italian,
the harmony of French, and so on.
Lest Fearon object that one would do
better to study music itself, I submit
that if one were to study all the discip
lines reflected in language one would
have to include literature, music, art,
history, philosophy and so on. This is
how language has always been pre
sented in a scholarly curriculum — at
the core of humanistic studies.
That is why no serious student can
afford to bypass its basic and essential
discipline.

both by this refusal and by the defini
tion of "officers" as "officers of the
board of trustees" and of the president
and five vice presidents as "employes"
— a piece of blatant sophistry tised to
evade the law. TheFaculty Handbook,
1975, clearly defines the latter as
"Executive Officer" on pages 7-12.
The requirement is part of the Tax
Reforms Act of 1969. Its purpose is, as I
understand it, to enable members of
the public to make informed judg
ments about whether private organiza
tions ought to be exempt from taxes in
the light of salaries of officers, highest
paid employes, and highest paid par
ties hired for professional services.
Wherein lies the "injustice" of
which vice president Rosenzweig
speaks? Might not the undermining of
justice be better attributed to those
who refuse to obey a just law?
This act of non-compliance and its
rationale should be of particular con
cern to us because they are the most
recent manifestations of an on-going
hostility by the administration to reve
aling meaningful data about the
salaries of administrative officers and
members of the faculty.
In May the provost published mini
mally useful, general figures about
administrative salaries. A proposal
concerning faculty salaries is being
considered by a task force appointed

by the senate. I hope that the officers of
the university will now move, not only
to comply with the law, but also to
make available genuinely useful in
formation about other salaries in the
university.

Richard Fearon's article (Daily, Dec.
1) on the Western Civilization re
quirement is to be commended for its
generally clear thinking and its
open-mindedness on the question of
requirements. But as a professor of
I rench, I can hardly be expected to
agree with the negative implications of
his question: "Why is it necessary that
all students have command of a
foreign language?"
I shall therefore attempt to state the
case for foreign languages briefly.
1. The purpose of foreign language
study is indeed to learn of a foreign
culture. But there can be no true know
ledge of another culture without the
language of that culture, for one re
flects the other. To study culture with
out language is to deprive the former of
one of its essential ingredients.
2. Language study is an aid in un
derstanding literature, for the finest
translation can never impart the flavor
of an original work.
3. An educated person has been de
fined as a citizen of the world, at home
in foreign lands. To communicate in
the language of a foreign country is to

establish an immediate bond of sym
pathy with people of other nations.
4. To study a foreign language shar
pens our awareness of verbal com
munication. While it is not true, to use
Fearon's example, that one will learn
English by studying Italian, one will
enhance one's English by so doing.
5. Exposure to a foreign language
can be a totally satisfying esthetic ex
perience. There is much truth in the
old cliches about the music of Italian,
the harmony of French, and so on.
Lest Fearon object that one would do
better to study music itself, I submit
that if one were to study all the discip
lines reflected in language one would
have to include literature, music, art,
history, philosophy and so on. This is
how language has always been pre
sented in a scholarly curriculum — at
the core of humanistic studies.
That is why no serious student can
afford to bypass its basic and essential
discipline.
