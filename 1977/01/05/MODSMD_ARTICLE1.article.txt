# Higher green fees?
## County raises taxes 
### Steve Schiller 
The university has filed a "friendly
protest" suit against the County of
Santa Clara over a decision by the
county to tax the 6000 acre Stanford
golf course at a higher rate. Robert
Young, associate director for athle
tics and operations in the Athletic De
partment, said that the county now as
sesses the course at the same rate as
any private course.
A decision by the State Board of
Equalization changed the basis for tax
ing private golf courses, effectively in
creasing the taxes paid. The county as
sessor first levied the higher rate in
tiscal year 1975-76 and the university
has since paid the larger bill under
protest while bringing the litigation.
The difference between the tax bills
is approximately $55,000 per year, ac
cording to Young.
Although the suit was filed in Sep
tember 1975, Superior Court Judge
John Racantelli first heard the case on
Nov. 2, 1976, and expects to deliver the
ruling "about a week (from now)," he
said.
According to Cassius Kirk, counsel
to the vice president for business and
finance, the university representative,
Gordon Weber of the law firm of
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and Ener
son, argued before the court that be
cause the purpose of the course was to
benefit students, who use the course

more than non-students, the assessor
should grant the land an educational
exemption. The course held this status
before the state ruling.
Furthermore, counsel pointed out
that non-Stanford groups have used
university facilities a number of times
and that such utilization aids in fund
raising.
According to Kirk, faculty and staff
use is not included in the determina
tion of educational use. In addition,
members of a small private club of
alumni and friends of the school fre
quently play the course and contribute
substantially to its upkeep.
The educational exception should
not apply, argued Deputy County
Counsel Byron Athan, because faculty,
staff and alumni use the course.
While acknowledging that the
course generates income for the Athle
tic Department, Young claimed that
"private members make it possible for
us to have such a fine golf course."
Last year, 52,000 rounds of guest
play were completed on the course and
the driving range generated more in
come than green fees. However, Young
emphasized that expenses have
skyrocketed in recent years and
pointed out that the Athletic Depart
ment recently paid $100,000 to link
the course to a new water supply.
The only implication of these
trends, said Young, is higher fees for
play.

ing private golf courses, effectively in
creasing the taxes paid. The county as
sessor first levied the higher rate in
tiscal year 1975-76 and the university
has since paid the larger bill under
protest while bringing the litigation.
The difference between the tax bills
is approximately $55,000 per year, ac
cording to Young.
Although the suit was filed in Sep
tember 1975, Superior Court Judge
John Racantelli first heard the case on
Nov. 2, 1976, and expects to deliver the
ruling "about a week (from now)," he
said.
According to Cassius Kirk, counsel
to the vice president for business and
finance, the university representative,
Gordon Weber of the law firm of
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and Ener
son, argued before the court that be
cause the purpose of the course was to
benefit students, who use the course

more than non-students, the assessor
should grant the land an educational
exemption. The course held this status
before the state ruling.
Furthermore, counsel pointed out
that non-Stanford groups have used
university facilities a number of times
and that such utilization aids in fund
raising.
According to Kirk, faculty and staff
use is not included in the determina
tion of educational use. In addition,
members of a small private club of
alumni and friends of the school fre
quently play the course and contribute
substantially to its upkeep.
The educational exception should
not apply, argued Deputy County
Counsel Byron Athan, because faculty,
staff and alumni use the course.
While acknowledging that the
course generates income for the Athle
tic Department, Young claimed that
"private members make it possible for
us to have such a fine golf course."
Last year, 52,000 rounds of guest
play were completed on the course and
the driving range generated more in
come than green fees. However, Young
emphasized that expenses have
skyrocketed in recent years and
pointed out that the Athletic Depart
ment recently paid $100,000 to link
the course to a new water supply.
The only implication of these
trends, said Young, is higher fees for
play.
The university has filed a "friendly
protest" suit against the County of
Santa Clara over a decision by the
county to tax the 6000 acre Stanford
golf course at a higher rate. Robert
Young, associate director for athle
tics and operations in the Athletic De
partment, said that the county now as
sesses the course at the same rate as
any private course.
A decision by the State Board of
Equalization changed the basis for tax
ing private golf courses, effectively in
creasing the taxes paid. The county as
sessor first levied the higher rate in
tiscal year 1975-76 and the university
has since paid the larger bill under
protest while bringing the litigation.
