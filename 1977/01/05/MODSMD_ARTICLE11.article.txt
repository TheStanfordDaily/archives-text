# Find your place on political spectrum
## 
### 
Unfortunately for the pollsters and social scien
tists, many Americans do not know where they lie
on the standard spectrum of pol.tical thought. A
few years ago, Russell Baker of the New York Times
offered several hypothetical situations which Stan
ford students can now use to place themselves on
the political scale.
Situation One: a bum approaches you on the
street and asks for 25 cents for a cup of coffee. Your
response tells whether you are a conservative, a
moderate, a left-wing Republican, a Wallacite, a
populists or a liberal.
The Conservative tells the bum he should get a
job and quit asking for handouts. He tells the bum
he should also go to church.
The Moderate gives the bum a dime after debat
ing whether he ought to give him 15 cents.
The left-wing Republican ignores the bum. but
writes a letter to the editor deploring the decay of
the American social structure.
The Wallaceite warns the bum he will run over
him if the bum ever tries stopping him on the street
again.
The populist tells the bum he already pays the
government so much money to take care of things
like bums and the Pentagon that he has nothing left
to give him.
The liberal pretends not to notice the bum and
afterwards, feels guilty all day about his inhuman
ity to man. He wishes the government spent more
money on bums.
Test Situation Number Two: walking down the
street at dusk you notice a young man in jeans
trying to break into a house through a second-story

window. Your political philosophy comes into
play.
The Conservative asks the young man if he is
employed by the FBI or CIA and is acting under
government orders.
The Moderate crosses the street to another house,

rings the doorbell and inquires whether they hap
pen to know the young man trying to break in
across the street.
The left-wing Republican ignores the young
man, but writes a letter to the editor deploring the
breakdown in police protection.
The Wallaceite tells the young man it is thieves
and welfare cheats like him who are ruining the
country and if the man ever tries to break into his
house again he will run him down.
The Populist assumes that the young man has
either locked himself out of his own home or is
going to burglarize a house whose owner is proba
bly not paying his fair share of income taxes any
how and therefore deserves to have his wealth

equalized.
The liberal immediately calls the police and af
terwards feels guilty all night. He resolves to prop
ose a new government bureau to regulate burglary.
And finally you are faced with the proverbial and
perennial problem of the young child who writes to
ask "Is there really a Santa Glaus?"
The Conservative immediately replies "Yes
small child, there is a Santa Claus and his name is
fiscal integrity."
The Moderate replies the world is deeply divided
on this great question and urges the child to listen
closely to all sides before rushing too hastily to a
conclusion.
The left-wing Republican pretends the child's
question was not asked, but writes back deploring
the increasing frequency with which it fails to snow
on Christmas.
The Wallaceite tells the child there certainly is a
Santa Claus but says the child needn't expect Santa
to visit if his daddy isn't an honest, hard-working
man without a pointy-head and a briefcase.
The Populist, observing the child had to pay 13
cents for the stamp, replies the child should apply
his mind to more serious issues.
The Liberal has a sleepless night debating which
is the right thing to tell the child, and feels guilty all
the next day because he hasn't answered the letter.
He resolves to attend a symposium on how to deal
with small children's questions, or else, to be
psychoanalyzed.
Now, which one are YOU?
