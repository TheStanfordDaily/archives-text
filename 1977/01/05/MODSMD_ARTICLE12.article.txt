# Health Act conflicts with democracy

One of the more disturbing pieces of
legislation to come out of Washington
in recent months is the 1976 Health
Professions Educational Assistance
Act. Its provisions, which cover stu
dents in a range of professional
schools (including medicine, dentis
try, osteopathy, pharmacy, optometry,
podiatry, veterinary medicine and
public health), constitute a severe in
trusion upon the academic self
determination of American medical
schools.
In addition, the law includes several
points which are inconsistent with its
intended purpose, which is to improve
the distribution of our nation's health
care services.
In principle, the Act operates much
like a frustrated parent who finds it
necessary to withhold his child's al
lowance in order to elicit desirable be
havior. The "bribe" in this case is
termed "capitation," and involves
federal allocations of $2000-$2 lOO per
American medical student for fiscal
years 1978-1980, with somewhat smal
ler amounts set aside for students in
other professional schools.
Failure of an institution to comply
with the other provisions of the law
results in automatic forfeiture of these
funds. Capitalism seldom conflicts
more strongly with democracy than in
this particular instance.
Capitation demands
The first capitation requirement
demands that all the nation's medical
schools coordinate their first year resi
dency positions so that a certain per
centage of places (ranging from 35 to
50 per cent) are in primary care
specialities. While this provision will
undoubtedly produce more primary
care physicians, it carries no guarantee
that these individuals will choose to
practice in underserved areas. Aside
from restriction of academic self
determination. its only certain con
sequence is a limitation of the options
open to students seeking residencies.

Paradoxically, the law provides for a
significant decline in the number of
foreign medical graduates practicing
in this country, via changes in immig
ration laws which make it difficult for
these individuals to enter and remain.
The reasoning behi nd this provision is
the assumption that foreign-educated
physicians deliver a lower quality of
care than do those trained at home.
Even if this assumption is valid, in
ferior care seems more desirable than
no care at all, which is the present situ
ation for many patients in underserved
areas. An analogous argument of equi
valent absurdity might be that
America should not send food aid to
starving foreign peoples, since it can
not afford to send filet mignon.
In apparent contradiction to this
provision, a second capitation condi
tion requires schools to accept a cer
tain number of American students
who have completed two years of med
ical school abroad. Together, they
imply that whatever "poor" training is
received in foreign medical schools
does not occur during the first two
years. Again, academic freedom is im
pinged upon, while little is done to
insure a more adequ a te heall h care dis -
tribution.
Increased emphasis
The Act places an increased em
phasis on the National Health Service
Corps, currently in existence, which is
designed to place physicians in under
served areas for two to four years in
exchange for scholarship aid. This in
itself is a commendable program, si nee
it encourages favorable health care dis
tribution while maintaining freedom
of choice.
However, the new law includes a
provision that excludes from service in
a manpower shortage area those scho
larship holders who show exceptional
promise in research. .
Intended to prevent the loss of
talented researchers to biomedical sci
ence. and not as an "out" for those who

wish to avoid service, it is likely to
become the latter. By encouraging
"draft-dodging" medical students to
enter research, this provision conflicts
with the stated overall goals of the Act.
As a final crowning point, it is a fact
that the cost of this bill, in terms of
dollars and medical school policy
reorganization, is high â€” the former
an estimated $2.3 billion.
As Barbara J. Culliton of Science
Magazine recently pointed out, there
may be more advantageous ways of
utilizing such a sum to improve our
nation's overall health. Adequate; nut
rition and housing are obviously as
important as having a doctor on hand.
That the new Act is indeed shaky in

principle was demonstrated by Presi
dent Ford's approving signature and
simultaneous promise to introduce
legislation to amend it. Several medi
cal schools, including' Stanford, are
considering a rejection of capitation in
favor of self-determination.
The burden of lost federal income is
likely to fall on the medical students,
resulting in increased demand for
rapidly-dwindling outside loan funds.
The overall chaos created by the Act is
clearly not worth the three years of
legislative time and effort spent creat
ing it.
