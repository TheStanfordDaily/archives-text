# Meyer Library: a striking 'architectural disaster
## 
### Laura Kennedy 
(This is the second part of a
two-part article analyzing the
architecture of Meyer Library.)

Meyer Library viewed from
any of its four approaches is an
aesthetically stunning building,
a monument in concrete de
signed to tie together the
academic area of campus with
main student living areas.
The building inside is equally
dramatic, dominated by a central
three-story light well. But as any
student can attest after a night of
studying, the dramatic light well
is in practical terms what at least
one student called, "an architec
tural disaster."
Phil Leighton, building pro
jects manager for the libraries,
says of Meyer, "Architecturally
it's got a lot of exciting tilings,
but not for a library. . . . It'd be a
good place for a student union."
Many of the student com
plaints about Meyer's "zoo-like"
atmosphere stems from the de
sign of the building itself. The
library staff that has to live with
the building is attempting to
work, around the problems it
creates.
The chief complaint about
Meyer is noise and the controv
ersial light well that acts as an
acoustical chimney. According
to Francisco Centurion, project
architect for Meyer when he

worked for John Carl Warnecke
& Associates, the purpose of the
well was to bring natural light
into the middle of the building.
He says, at the time there were
"some objections" about possi
ble noise problems, but since a
library would not have a high
level of noise to begin with, Cen
turion says the well did not ap
pear to be an acoustical problem
when it was being planned.
Aesthetic excitement
And what noise would occur
was presumed to be over
weighed by the aesthetic ex
citement of the well and its effect
in breaking up the large floor
space and making the building
seem more spacious. Fid Tower,
off ice manager for the Warnecke
firm, says, "Aren't they (the stu
dents) willing to stand a little
noise for the spatial experi
ence?"
Librarians connected with the
planning and maintaining of the
building accepted the light well
grudgingly. Ray Swank, director
of libraries during early plan
ning, wrote in a memo to the ar
chitectural firm in September,
1960, "That light well would be
pleasant only if the acoustical
problems of noise between floors
could be solved and guaran
teed." Elmer Crieder, who fol
lowed Swank as director, still
says, "1 don't see personally
what its purpose is" and man
aged to persuade the architect to
start the well at the second, not
the first floor, and to glass in the
first floor lobby rather than leav
ing it open to bike and pedest
rian trafficas originally planned.
Elizabeth Salzar, current chief
librarian who has recently
cracked down on the "Dead
Week Follies," says of the well.
"It's just an invitation to stage
various events on the second
floor."
Full carpeting and sound

absorbing ceiling hangings have
been suggested to solve t he noise
problem, but in these times of
tight funds these measures have
not been pursued. Carpeting has
been added, notably on the
stairs, as the budget permitted.
The Main Library addition will
be fully carpeted except for the
entrance.
Another suggestion to cut
down noise has been to defuse
student rowdiness by putting in
a student lounge. Originally, the
plans called for a snack bar
room, larger than the tiny vend
ing machine room now used, but
the snack bar was one of the first
things to be cut when costs
started climbing. Jack Plotkin,
chief, circulation librarian while
Meyer was being planned, wrote
to Crieder in July, 1960, saying,
"1 am glad we cut out a snack bar
room. It's a headache in every
library 1 visited, so let's stick to
our guns and not allow it at Stan
ford. The new student union will
be close by anyway."
Ironically, 16 years later, the
chief librarian of Meyer is trying
to figure out a way to put a stu
dent lounge back in. Salzar
explored the idea of using one of
the first floor seminar rooms, but
found they were almost continu
ally scheduled for classes. The
only other area available is the
first floor lobby, which Salzar
says she finds cold and uninvit
ing with its stone floor and black
iron furniture. Possibly this area
might be carpeted and more
comfortable furniture installed,
says Salzar, but the area would
still be drafty, being close to the
doors. No provision is made in
the Main Library addition for a
student lounge, but one is in
cluded in the renovation plans
for Main Library.
Noise chief complaint
An acoustical engineer hired
by the library after a survey of
students in spring, 1975 listed
noise as their chief complaint,
actually suggested cutting down
noise by glassing in the sides ot
the well. Whether this is ar
chitectually and financially feas
ible remains to be seen.
On a more immediate level,
the engineer also suggested pip
ing in "white noise"
(background noise). This is
being tried on an experimental

basis in selected areas ot the lib
rary.
Paradoxically, the library
seems noisy, because it is so
quiet. It.is actually possible to
hear, from the fourth floor,
someone rustling pages on the
second floor, not only because
the well carries the sound up
ward. but because there is virtu
ally no background noise to
drown out low level sounds. In
most buildings, the ventilation
provides the background noise,
but in Meyer, "the designers had
the misconception that a library
should be as quiet as possible."
as Building Projects Manager
Phil Leighton puts it.

As a result of this "misconcep
tion," the architect put in what
was a very new and innovative
system at the time, a particularly
quiet kind of ventilation called
the airson system, or in layman's
language, the "leaky ceiling"
system. Fresh air is forced
through small holes in the ceil
ing tiles. Unfortunately, in
Meyer's case, the holes are
spaced so far apart that there is
insufficient pressure to move the
air very fast, resulting in a stuffy
feeling. To solve this problem,
larger fan units and open grills
in the ceiling were installed and
the library switched from its
self-contained heating system to

the central University system,
which ameliorated the stuttiness
somewhat. However, the student
survey still listed ventilation as
one of students' frequent com
plaints. The windows in
Meyer do not open, nut just so
the air > onditioning system will
work elficientlv but also for sec -
urity and to protect books from
the elements. However, si nee the
windows were fixed shut, they
must be washed from the out
side, at a cost the library esti
mates to be $15-$20.000. since
staging would need to be erected
around the building. When
Meyer was planned, the ar
chitects thought a cherry picker

truck i ould be used to rea< h the
windows, but this was nevei
tried and the windows have not
been washed tor 10 years
Most of Meyer l.ibrar\ s prob
lems â€” noise, ventilation, sec
urity etc. stem not from man
agement but from the design of
the building. The library is ac -
tively seeking ways to live with
the design and overcome its
problems. Nevertheless, some
problems neither architect nor
librarian < an foresee. No one
ever guessed when Meyer was
opened 10 years ago that it
would be the first university lib
rary in the country to have
bats. . . .

jects manager for the libraries,
says of Meyer, "Architecturally
it's got a lot of exciting tilings,
but not for a library. . . . It'd be a
good place for a student union."
Many of the student com
plaints about Meyer's "zoo-like"
atmosphere stems from the de
sign of the building itself. The
library staff that has to live with
the building is attempting to
work, around the problems it
creates.
The chief complaint about
Meyer is noise and the controv
ersial light well that acts as an
acoustical chimney. According
to Francisco Centurion, project
architect for Meyer when he

worked for John Carl Warnecke
& Associates, the purpose of the
well was to bring natural light
into the middle of the building.
He says, at the time there were
"some objections" about possi
ble noise problems, but since a
library would not have a high
level of noise to begin with, Cen
turion says the well did not ap
pear to be an acoustical problem
when it was being planned.
Aesthetic excitement
And what noise would occur
was presumed to be over
weighed by the aesthetic ex
citement of the well and its effect
in breaking up the large floor
space and making the building
seem more spacious. Fid Tower,
off ice manager for the Warnecke
firm, says, "Aren't they (the stu
dents) willing to stand a little
noise for the spatial experi
ence?"
Librarians connected with the
planning and maintaining of the
building accepted the light well
grudgingly. Ray Swank, director
of libraries during early plan
ning, wrote in a memo to the ar
chitectural firm in September,
1960, "That light well would be
pleasant only if the acoustical
problems of noise between floors
could be solved and guaran
teed." Elmer Crieder, who fol
lowed Swank as director, still
says, "1 don't see personally
what its purpose is" and man
aged to persuade the architect to
start the well at the second, not
the first floor, and to glass in the
first floor lobby rather than leav
ing it open to bike and pedest
rian trafficas originally planned.
Elizabeth Salzar, current chief
librarian who has recently
cracked down on the "Dead
Week Follies," says of the well.
"It's just an invitation to stage
various events on the second
floor."
Full carpeting and sound

absorbing ceiling hangings have
been suggested to solve t he noise
problem, but in these times of
tight funds these measures have
not been pursued. Carpeting has
been added, notably on the
stairs, as the budget permitted.
The Main Library addition will
be fully carpeted except for the
entrance.
Another suggestion to cut
down noise has been to defuse
student rowdiness by putting in
a student lounge. Originally, the
plans called for a snack bar
room, larger than the tiny vend
ing machine room now used, but
the snack bar was one of the first
things to be cut when costs
started climbing. Jack Plotkin,
chief, circulation librarian while
Meyer was being planned, wrote
to Crieder in July, 1960, saying,
"1 am glad we cut out a snack bar
room. It's a headache in every
library 1 visited, so let's stick to
our guns and not allow it at Stan
ford. The new student union will
be close by anyway."
Ironically, 16 years later, the
chief librarian of Meyer is trying
to figure out a way to put a stu
dent lounge back in. Salzar
explored the idea of using one of
the first floor seminar rooms, but
found they were almost continu
ally scheduled for classes. The
only other area available is the
first floor lobby, which Salzar
says she finds cold and uninvit
ing with its stone floor and black
iron furniture. Possibly this area
might be carpeted and more
comfortable furniture installed,
says Salzar, but the area would
still be drafty, being close to the
doors. No provision is made in
the Main Library addition for a
student lounge, but one is in
cluded in the renovation plans
for Main Library.
Noise chief complaint
An acoustical engineer hired
by the library after a survey of
students in spring, 1975 listed
noise as their chief complaint,
actually suggested cutting down
noise by glassing in the sides ot
the well. Whether this is ar
chitectually and financially feas
ible remains to be seen.
On a more immediate level,
the engineer also suggested pip
ing in "white noise"
(background noise). This is
being tried on an experimental

basis in selected areas ot the lib
rary.
Paradoxically, the library
seems noisy, because it is so
quiet. It.is actually possible to
hear, from the fourth floor,
someone rustling pages on the
second floor, not only because
the well carries the sound up
ward. but because there is virtu
ally no background noise to
drown out low level sounds. In
most buildings, the ventilation
provides the background noise,
but in Meyer, "the designers had
the misconception that a library
should be as quiet as possible."
as Building Projects Manager
Phil Leighton puts it.

As a result of this "misconcep
tion," the architect put in what
was a very new and innovative
system at the time, a particularly
quiet kind of ventilation called
the airson system, or in layman's
language, the "leaky ceiling"
system. Fresh air is forced
through small holes in the ceil
ing tiles. Unfortunately, in
Meyer's case, the holes are
spaced so far apart that there is
insufficient pressure to move the
air very fast, resulting in a stuffy
feeling. To solve this problem,
larger fan units and open grills
in the ceiling were installed and
the library switched from its
self-contained heating system to

the central University system,
which ameliorated the stuttiness
somewhat. However, the student
survey still listed ventilation as
one of students' frequent com
plaints. The windows in
Meyer do not open, nut just so
the air > onditioning system will
work elficientlv but also for sec -
urity and to protect books from
the elements. However, si nee the
windows were fixed shut, they
must be washed from the out
side, at a cost the library esti
mates to be $15-$20.000. since
staging would need to be erected
around the building. When
Meyer was planned, the ar
chitects thought a cherry picker

truck i ould be used to rea< h the
windows, but this was nevei
tried and the windows have not
been washed tor 10 years
Most of Meyer l.ibrar\ s prob
lems â€” noise, ventilation, sec
urity etc. stem not from man
agement but from the design of
the building. The library is ac -
tively seeking ways to live with
the design and overcome its
problems. Nevertheless, some
problems neither architect nor
librarian < an foresee. No one
ever guessed when Meyer was
opened 10 years ago that it
would be the first university lib
rary in the country to have
bats. . . .

to Francisco Centurion, project
architect for Meyer when he

worked for John Carl Warnecke
& Associates, the purpose of the
well was to bring natural light
into the middle of the building.
He says, at the time there were
"some objections" about possi
ble noise problems, but since a
library would not have a high
level of noise to begin with, Cen
turion says the well did not ap
pear to be an acoustical problem
when it was being planned.
Aesthetic excitement
And what noise would occur
was presumed to be over
weighed by the aesthetic ex
citement of the well and its effect
in breaking up the large floor
space and making the building
seem more spacious. Fid Tower,
off ice manager for the Warnecke
firm, says, "Aren't they (the stu
dents) willing to stand a little
noise for the spatial experi
ence?"
Librarians connected with the
planning and maintaining of the
building accepted the light well
grudgingly. Ray Swank, director
of libraries during early plan
ning, wrote in a memo to the ar
chitectural firm in September,
1960, "That light well would be
pleasant only if the acoustical
problems of noise between floors
could be solved and guaran
teed." Elmer Crieder, who fol
lowed Swank as director, still
says, "1 don't see personally
what its purpose is" and man
aged to persuade the architect to
start the well at the second, not
the first floor, and to glass in the
first floor lobby rather than leav
ing it open to bike and pedest
rian trafficas originally planned.
Elizabeth Salzar, current chief
librarian who has recently
cracked down on the "Dead
Week Follies," says of the well.
"It's just an invitation to stage
various events on the second
floor."
Full carpeting and sound

absorbing ceiling hangings have
been suggested to solve t he noise
problem, but in these times of
tight funds these measures have
not been pursued. Carpeting has
been added, notably on the
stairs, as the budget permitted.
The Main Library addition will
be fully carpeted except for the
entrance.
Another suggestion to cut
down noise has been to defuse
student rowdiness by putting in
a student lounge. Originally, the
plans called for a snack bar
room, larger than the tiny vend
ing machine room now used, but
the snack bar was one of the first
things to be cut when costs
started climbing. Jack Plotkin,
chief, circulation librarian while
Meyer was being planned, wrote
to Crieder in July, 1960, saying,
"1 am glad we cut out a snack bar
room. It's a headache in every
library 1 visited, so let's stick to
our guns and not allow it at Stan
ford. The new student union will
be close by anyway."
Ironically, 16 years later, the
chief librarian of Meyer is trying
to figure out a way to put a stu
dent lounge back in. Salzar
explored the idea of using one of
the first floor seminar rooms, but
found they were almost continu
ally scheduled for classes. The
only other area available is the
first floor lobby, which Salzar
says she finds cold and uninvit
ing with its stone floor and black
iron furniture. Possibly this area
might be carpeted and more
comfortable furniture installed,
says Salzar, but the area would
still be drafty, being close to the
doors. No provision is made in
the Main Library addition for a
student lounge, but one is in
cluded in the renovation plans
for Main Library.
Noise chief complaint
An acoustical engineer hired
by the library after a survey of
students in spring, 1975 listed
noise as their chief complaint,
actually suggested cutting down
noise by glassing in the sides ot
the well. Whether this is ar
chitectually and financially feas
ible remains to be seen.
On a more immediate level,
the engineer also suggested pip
ing in "white noise"
(background noise). This is
being tried on an experimental

basis in selected areas ot the lib
rary.
Paradoxically, the library
seems noisy, because it is so
quiet. It.is actually possible to
hear, from the fourth floor,
someone rustling pages on the
second floor, not only because
the well carries the sound up
ward. but because there is virtu
ally no background noise to
drown out low level sounds. In
most buildings, the ventilation
provides the background noise,
but in Meyer, "the designers had
the misconception that a library
should be as quiet as possible."
as Building Projects Manager
Phil Leighton puts it.

As a result of this "misconcep
tion," the architect put in what
was a very new and innovative
system at the time, a particularly
quiet kind of ventilation called
the airson system, or in layman's
language, the "leaky ceiling"
system. Fresh air is forced
through small holes in the ceil
ing tiles. Unfortunately, in
Meyer's case, the holes are
spaced so far apart that there is
insufficient pressure to move the
air very fast, resulting in a stuffy
feeling. To solve this problem,
larger fan units and open grills
in the ceiling were installed and
the library switched from its
self-contained heating system to

the central University system,
which ameliorated the stuttiness
somewhat. However, the student
survey still listed ventilation as
one of students' frequent com
plaints. The windows in
Meyer do not open, nut just so
the air > onditioning system will
work elficientlv but also for sec -
urity and to protect books from
the elements. However, si nee the
windows were fixed shut, they
must be washed from the out
side, at a cost the library esti
mates to be $15-$20.000. since
staging would need to be erected
around the building. When
Meyer was planned, the ar
chitects thought a cherry picker

truck i ould be used to rea< h the
windows, but this was nevei
tried and the windows have not
been washed tor 10 years
Most of Meyer l.ibrar\ s prob
lems â€” noise, ventilation, sec
urity etc. stem not from man
agement but from the design of
the building. The library is ac -
tively seeking ways to live with
the design and overcome its
problems. Nevertheless, some
problems neither architect nor
librarian < an foresee. No one
ever guessed when Meyer was
opened 10 years ago that it
would be the first university lib
rary in the country to have
bats. . . .

Meyer Library viewed from
any of its four approaches is an
aesthetically stunning building,
a monument in concrete de
signed to tie together the
academic area of campus with
main student living areas.
The building inside is equally
dramatic, dominated by a central
three-story light well. But as any
student can attest after a night of
studying, the dramatic light well
is in practical terms what at least
one student called, "an architec
tural disaster."
Phil Leighton, building pro
jects manager for the libraries,
says of Meyer, "Architecturally
it's got a lot of exciting tilings,
but not for a library. . . . It'd be a
good place for a student union."

citement of the well and its effect
in breaking up the large floor
space and making the building
seem more spacious. Fid Tower,
off ice manager for the Warnecke
firm, says, "Aren't they (the stu
dents) willing to stand a little
noise for the spatial experi
ence?"
Librarians connected with the
planning and maintaining of the
building accepted the light well
grudgingly. Ray Swank, director
of libraries during early plan
ning, wrote in a memo to the ar
chitectural firm in September,
1960, "That light well would be
pleasant only if the acoustical
problems of noise between floors
could be solved and guaran
teed." Elmer Crieder, who fol
lowed Swank as director, still
says, "1 don't see personally
what its purpose is" and man
aged to persuade the architect to
start the well at the second, not
the first floor, and to glass in the
first floor lobby rather than leav
ing it open to bike and pedest
rian trafficas originally planned.
Elizabeth Salzar, current chief
librarian who has recently
cracked down on the "Dead
Week Follies," says of the well.
"It's just an invitation to stage
various events on the second
floor."
Full carpeting and sound

absorbing ceiling hangings have
been suggested to solve t he noise
problem, but in these times of
tight funds these measures have
not been pursued. Carpeting has
been added, notably on the
stairs, as the budget permitted.
The Main Library addition will
be fully carpeted except for the
entrance.
Another suggestion to cut
down noise has been to defuse
student rowdiness by putting in
a student lounge. Originally, the
plans called for a snack bar
room, larger than the tiny vend
ing machine room now used, but
the snack bar was one of the first
things to be cut when costs
started climbing. Jack Plotkin,
chief, circulation librarian while
Meyer was being planned, wrote
to Crieder in July, 1960, saying,
"1 am glad we cut out a snack bar
room. It's a headache in every
library 1 visited, so let's stick to
our guns and not allow it at Stan
ford. The new student union will
be close by anyway."
Ironically, 16 years later, the
chief librarian of Meyer is trying
to figure out a way to put a stu
dent lounge back in. Salzar
explored the idea of using one of
the first floor seminar rooms, but
found they were almost continu
ally scheduled for classes. The
only other area available is the
first floor lobby, which Salzar
says she finds cold and uninvit
ing with its stone floor and black
iron furniture. Possibly this area
might be carpeted and more
comfortable furniture installed,
says Salzar, but the area would
still be drafty, being close to the
doors. No provision is made in
the Main Library addition for a
student lounge, but one is in
cluded in the renovation plans
for Main Library.
Noise chief complaint
An acoustical engineer hired
by the library after a survey of
students in spring, 1975 listed
noise as their chief complaint,
actually suggested cutting down
noise by glassing in the sides ot
the well. Whether this is ar
chitectually and financially feas
ible remains to be seen.
On a more immediate level,
the engineer also suggested pip
ing in "white noise"
(background noise). This is
being tried on an experimental

basis in selected areas ot the lib
rary.
Paradoxically, the library
seems noisy, because it is so
quiet. It.is actually possible to
hear, from the fourth floor,
someone rustling pages on the
second floor, not only because
the well carries the sound up
ward. but because there is virtu
ally no background noise to
drown out low level sounds. In
most buildings, the ventilation
provides the background noise,
but in Meyer, "the designers had
the misconception that a library
should be as quiet as possible."
as Building Projects Manager
Phil Leighton puts it.

As a result of this "misconcep
tion," the architect put in what
was a very new and innovative
system at the time, a particularly
quiet kind of ventilation called
the airson system, or in layman's
language, the "leaky ceiling"
system. Fresh air is forced
through small holes in the ceil
ing tiles. Unfortunately, in
Meyer's case, the holes are
spaced so far apart that there is
insufficient pressure to move the
air very fast, resulting in a stuffy
feeling. To solve this problem,
larger fan units and open grills
in the ceiling were installed and
the library switched from its
self-contained heating system to

the central University system,
which ameliorated the stuttiness
somewhat. However, the student
survey still listed ventilation as
one of students' frequent com
plaints. The windows in
Meyer do not open, nut just so
the air > onditioning system will
work elficientlv but also for sec -
urity and to protect books from
the elements. However, si nee the
windows were fixed shut, they
must be washed from the out
side, at a cost the library esti
mates to be $15-$20.000. since
staging would need to be erected
around the building. When
Meyer was planned, the ar
chitects thought a cherry picker

truck i ould be used to rea< h the
windows, but this was nevei
tried and the windows have not
been washed tor 10 years
Most of Meyer l.ibrar\ s prob
lems â€” noise, ventilation, sec
urity etc. stem not from man
agement but from the design of
the building. The library is ac -
tively seeking ways to live with
the design and overcome its
problems. Nevertheless, some
problems neither architect nor
librarian < an foresee. No one
ever guessed when Meyer was
opened 10 years ago that it
would be the first university lib
rary in the country to have
bats. . . .
(This is the second part of a
two-part article analyzing the
architecture of Meyer Library.)

Meyer Library viewed from
any of its four approaches is an
aesthetically stunning building,
a monument in concrete de
signed to tie together the
academic area of campus with
main student living areas.
The building inside is equally
dramatic, dominated by a central
three-story light well. But as any
student can attest after a night of
studying, the dramatic light well
is in practical terms what at least
one student called, "an architec
tural disaster."
Phil Leighton, building pro
jects manager for the libraries,
says of Meyer, "Architecturally
it's got a lot of exciting tilings,
but not for a library. . . . It'd be a
good place for a student union."
Many of the student com
plaints about Meyer's "zoo-like"
atmosphere stems from the de
sign of the building itself. The
library staff that has to live with
the building is attempting to
work, around the problems it
creates.
The chief complaint about
Meyer is noise and the controv
ersial light well that acts as an
acoustical chimney. According
to Francisco Centurion, project
architect for Meyer when he

worked for John Carl Warnecke
& Associates, the purpose of the
well was to bring natural light
into the middle of the building.
He says, at the time there were
"some objections" about possi
ble noise problems, but since a
library would not have a high
level of noise to begin with, Cen
turion says the well did not ap
pear to be an acoustical problem
when it was being planned.
Aesthetic excitement
And what noise would occur
was presumed to be over
weighed by the aesthetic ex
citement of the well and its effect
in breaking up the large floor
space and making the building
seem more spacious. Fid Tower,
off ice manager for the Warnecke
firm, says, "Aren't they (the stu
dents) willing to stand a little

ence?"
