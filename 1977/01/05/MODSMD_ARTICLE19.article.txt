## Surprising Cards open Pac-8 
### Jeff Parietti 
The Stanford Cardinal basket
ball squad opens its 1977
Pacific-8 season with games at
Washington State and
Washington this weekend.
The Cards, winners of six of
their past seven contests and 7-3
overall, enter conference play
against Washington State
Thursday night in Pullman.
The key man in Stanford's re
vitalized offense is senior guard
Mike Bratz. The senior captain is
averaging 18.8 points,4.4 assists
and 2.8 steals per game. He leads
the team in free throw percen
tage with a .786 mark and is
shooting 5U per cent from the
floor.
"Mike is emerging as one of
the premier guards on the West
Coast and quite possibly the best
guard in the Pac-8," said Card
coach Dick Dißiaso. "He's play
ing outstanding basketball in
every aspect of the game."
Dißiaso said of Stanford's sur
prising comeback, "The team is
playing with a great deal of con
fidence and a strong belief in
what they are capable of doing.
I'm very pleased with the consis
tency we've begun to show.
"To continue our progress,
our players will have to play
with even more enthusiasm,
confidence and aggressiveness
than they've sshown so far. If we
don't our chances of success in
the Pac-8 will be very limited."
The Cougars compiled an 18-8
mark last season under head
coach Ceorge Raveling, their
best record since 1970 when
they were 19-7. Currently, the
Cougars are 8-2 with losses com
ing to Rhode Island and Pepper
dine.
Good crop
Raveling is coming off what he
calls one of his best recruiting
years in 15 years of coaching.
"On paper, we have to be con
sidered a team to watch out for
this year," said Raveling.
And the first two players the
Cards must "watch out for" are
senior Steve Puidokas and
freshman Stuart House. Both are
6-11 and Raveling utilizes both
by running a double-post of
fense.
Leading scorer
Puidokas is WSU's all-time
scoring leader and led the con
ference in scoring as a sopho
more. He paces the Cougars this
season with 18 points and 10 re
bounds per game.
Raveling lured House from
Detroit to the Palouse country
and the freshman has chipped in
with about seven points and
seven rebounds a contest.
Cougar cog
Six-foot-two wing man Harold
Rhodes is another important cog

in the Cougar offense. Rhodes, a
senior from Florence, Alabama,
is averaging better than 17
points a game and his outside
scoring has complemented the
inside play of Puidokas and
House.
Raveling starts another
freshman. 6-6 Don Collins from
Toledo, Ohio, at the other wing
spot. Collins has aided the
Cougar attack with 7.6 points
and three rebounds a contest.
Junior Ken (ones, also from
Detroit, is the point guard of the
Washington State offense and
has averaged eight points and
four assists per game.

Coming off the bench, the
Cougars have guard Marty
Giovacchini, brother of Stanford
guard Paul Giovacchini. Marty is
WSU's all-time assist leader and
is averaging about three assists
per game this year.
The Cougars also have
sophomore 7-2 center lames
Donaldson, who played his high
school ball in Sacramento. Al
though Donaldson has been
used infrequently, the Cougars
can put in an imposing front line
ol Donaldson, House and
Puidokas if necessary.
Offensively, the Courgars put
the most emphasis on the fast
break. If their break is stopped.

they shift into a slow-down ul
fense and run tin l double-post,
trying to get the ball down to
either Puidokas or House
Zone defense
Defensively, WSI! usually
plays a man-to-man defense,
with an occasional switch to a
zone.
The Cougars have not really
been too impressive as of yet.
having their troubles in edging
such teams as Fresno State and
Pacific Lutheran.
Stanford will be looking to
continue their hot streak o! late
and hoping to start off league
play with a win.
