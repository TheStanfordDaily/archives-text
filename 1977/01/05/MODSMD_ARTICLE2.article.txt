# Tax cut proposal causes uproar
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — President
Gerald Ford asked Congress yesterday
for a $10 billion cut in individual in
come taxes that would raise taxes for
some of the poorest families and pro
vide tax relief for some of the richest.
The Ford proposal, spelled out in a
written message to Congress, includes
a $10.2 billion increase in Social Sec
urity taxes over a two-year period; a
$2.5 billion cut in corporate taxes and i
elimination of the double taxation of
corporate dividends.
Ford also postponed the announce
ment of his plan to end price controls
on gasoline.
Tax-cut effects
According to White House figures,
Ford's tax-cut plan would have these
effects on typical four-member
families:
—because Ford would repeal a spe
cial tax credit for low-income working
families, a family with adjusted gross
income of $5000 would lose $300.
—a family earning $10,000 would
pay $166 less; the typical family of four
at the $15,000 level would get a $227
tax cut, while the $20,000 family
would pay $250 less.
—in the upper brackets, tax relief
would range from $256 for the $30,000
family to $380 for the four-member
family earning $100,000 a year.
In calling for higher payroll taxes to

finance Social Security benefits, Ford
contended the system will be bankrupt
within a few years unless the law is
changed.
Congressional opposition
Ford submitted a virtually identical
tax proposal last year that was rejected.
Congress is unlikely to accept the
economic suggestions of the outgoing
president, especially since President
elect Jimmy Carter has yet to spell out
his own plan of economic stimulus.
Meanwhile, the move to lift the lid
on gas prices has run into mounting
criticism in the Democratic-controlled
Congress, which can disapprove
Ford's action within 15 days after he
submits it.
