# Shuffling the Cards
## New Year's wishes 
### Chris Baker 
I hope that 1977 will bring as
much for the Stanford sports
world as 1976, a year which saw
Art Lambert's water polo team
bring an NCAA championship to
the Farm. Here are a few New
Year's gifts for Cardinal sports
figures — past and present.
For Guy Benjamin — A Heis
man Trophy, but more impor
tantly a healthy football season.
If you break your nose one more
time you'll be another Jerry
West.
For Bill Walsh — The freedom
to do your job without the sec
ond guessing and criticism that
plagued Jack Christiansen. A
tew more scholarships wouldn't
hurt either. And Jan. 2 in
Pasadena.
For Jack Christiansen — An
assistant coaching or scouting
job with an NFL team.

I'or Tony Hill — A nice con
tract and 10 years with a Califor
nia NFL club. I hope you don't
have to go to Tampa Hay or Seat
tle.
For Dick Dißiaso —A sold out
Maples Pavilion next Saturday
evening to witness another
"Maples Miracle." Your team
has pulled off a surprise in com
ing into the Pac-8 season with a
7-3 mark, how about another
surprise?
For John Finley — A smaller
head and a pair of boxing gloves.
If your head gets any bigger
you'll have more problems than
O.J. Simpson when you pick out
your helmet.
For Art Lambert — A second
NCAA water polo crown.
For the Stanford field hockey
team — A third visit to the na
tionals. Playing eastern field
hockey teams in the nationals

has been a learning experience.
Another trip should be a win
ning experience.
For Jim Plunkett — A free pass
to a psychiatrist. If you can't fi
gure out what went wrong this
year then maybe somebody else
can. But you'd better do it befiVre
the 49ers trade you for another
quarterback.
For Mike Cordova — A pro
contract with a club other than
the Philadelphia Eagles. You got
a raw deal from the Stanford
fans.
For Cary Cavalli — An (in
closed press box with an
elevator. Either you supply the
sports writers with gloves or
else. . . .
For Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
— The NCAA finally coming to
its senses and passing the need
formula at its annual convention
next week.
For the women's swimming
team — A national title.
For the men's swimming team
— See above.
ForCeorge Buehler— A Super
Bowl ring and that $15,000
Super Bowl money.
For Payton Jordan — A new
track and more scholarships.
You do such a good job with
what you have that it makes me
wonder what you could do if
Stanford wen; on a financial |»ar
with UCLA instead of Nay ward
State.
For Dave Currey — A lot of
luck in building a successful
football program at Long Beach
State.
For Stanford sports fans —
Better home football games next
year. If they get any more boring
you may have to bring coffee in
stead of beer.
