# New assistant swim coach
## Meyer regains self-confidence 
### Jill Lieber 
One of swimming's most
prominent Olympic gold
medalists is at Stanford this
year, but she is not churning
her way through the water five'
hours a day. Rather she spends
most of her time on the pool
deck coaching the members of
both the men's and women's
teams.
Three-time Olympic gold
medal ist Debbie Meyer is in her
first season as assistant coach
for Stanford. Meyer, 24, was re
cently voted the third greatest
swimmer ever and was nomi
nated into the 1977 Swimming
Hall of Fame.
Her list of accomplishments
during her best years — 1965-
71 wben she swam for Ardtjn
Hills Swim Club in Sacramento
— are impressive. Meyer broke
22 individual American re
cords in the 200, 500 and 1650
yard freestyle. She also broke
20 world records in the 200,
400, 800, 880 and 1500 free. She
was the first woman to hold five
world records at one time and
the first swimmer — male or
female — to win three indi
vidual Olympic gold medals.
Self-confidence
Out of the pool since 1972,
Meyer is just regaining the
self-confidence she lost when
she quit swimming.
"When 1 quit swimming 1
went through an identity
crisis," Meyer said. "I didn't
know what to do with my free
time. 1 »didn't know what I
could do besides swim because
I had been doing that for such a
long time. 1 took up skiing and
then 1 broke my ankle."
Once sleek and muscular,
Meyer saw herself balloon to
180 pounds.
"I did public relations work
and commentation for CBS but
1 got heavier and heavier. Fi
nally CBS phased me out be
cause I gained too much
weight. 1 was feeling discour
aged socially and I ate myself
into a blubber ball."
But even being a gold

medalist posed emotional
problems. She was hounded by
reporters and swimming
enthusiasts.
"1 never really liked public
ity," she said, "because I never
thought I had that much to say.
Publicity puts you in the spot
light and then you get all kinds
of people after you — a lot of
weird ones. After I won my
gold medals 1 had a threat on
my life, lots of marriage prop
osals and letters from guys ask
ing me to come spend the
weekend with them — all ex
penses paid."
It was hard for her to be

glorified by the public espe
cially since she is quite an in
troverted person. Luckily, her
family didn't give her special
treatment because of her
superstar status.
"Long distance, swimmers
especially are introverted.
Swimming is a lonely sport be
causeyou're in the water all the
time. You don't get to talk to

anyone at meets except bet
ween races. And in practice
you're always going twice as
far as everyone else.
Supporters
"My family was really be
hind me and 1 don't think their
lives were changed because 1
was swimming. When 1 got
back from Mexico City after I
won my three golds I walked in
and my brother said 'Nice to
have you home — good job'
and then it was dropped."
For eight years Meyer swam
under Sherm Chavoor at Arden
Hills. Chavoor was the coach of
the 1968 and '72 U.S. Women's

Olympic team and is known for
revolutionizing the training
program for middle and dis
tance swimming. Before ac
cepting the assistant coaching
job at Stanford, Meyer coached
the age group swimmers for
Chavoor at Arden Hills and as
sisted him with his senior
team. A lot of Chavoor's coach
ing style has rubbed off on her.

"What Sherm said was al
ways the word. He was a hard
coach but you've got to be that
way to produce good swim
mers. I really believe in over
distance work (as he trains his
swimmers). I feel it's easier to
come down from 200's and do
100's."
Many factors enter into the
coaching of swimmers and
probably that which is most
important is the personality of
the athlete. Meyer said it is im
portant to know the members
of the team and their goals but
she still finds herself overlook
ing their goals and pushing her
own dedication to be t he best in
the water onto the Stanford
swimmers.
"I'm just beginning to realize
what I did in swimming as far
as what I accomplished. The
kids' times now in workouts
are the times I did in '68. It's
hard to believe that eight years
ago I was doing this stuff.
"So, sometimes I get hard on
the kids and say, 'II 1 could do
this you sure can.' And I know
it bugs them but I hope it makes
them work harder."
Cohesive unit
Head coach JimGaughran, in
his 17th year of coaching at
Stanford, said, "Debbie has
been a tremendous help to the
team. She knows what she is
doing and has won the respect
of the kids which is very impor
tant."
Meyer and Gaughran work
side-by-side in coaching the
men's and the women's teams.
The team is a unit — some
swimmers have said it is like a
big AAU club — and there is
not a separate coach for either
team.
"I have a lot of respect for
lim," Meyer said. "It made me
feel good to hear someone say a
while ago that over all the
years with other assistant
coaches, Jim took control
and he wanted it done his way.
But he has let me do so much. It
makes me feel good that he has
confidence in me."
