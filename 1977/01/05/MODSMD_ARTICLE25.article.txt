Carter imposes tough ethics
Plains, Cia. — President-elect Jimmy (barter im
posed tough rules against conflict of interest upon
his administration's top 2000 political appointees
yesterday and set an example in following the rules
by giving up the management and profits of his
peanut business.
Carter will ask the top officials of his administra
tion to sign a contract agreeing to make a complete
and public financial disclosure and to sell or place
in a blind trust any assets which may pose a conflict
with official duties.
In addition, Carter's ethics code imposes an un
precedented requirement aimed at shutting the so
called revolving door which in the past has permit
ted certain government officials and their counter
parts in business and other fields to become virtu
ally interchangeable.
Under the new requirements, all appointees must
sign a pledge to stay in government for their full
appointed terms unless dismissed sooner. The
pledge also prohibits them from accepting any job
in the private sector for two years after leaving
government if the job requires them to deal with
their former departments or agencies on business
that concerned them as government officials.
Tests reveal abnormal blood counts
Moscow — Blood tests on U.S. Embassy person
nel here show abnormalities in one-third of the
people tested, according to an administrative
notice distributed yesterday.
The blood tests, conducted after the embassy
claimed that microwave radiation was being
beamed at the building by the Russians, showed an
increase in the white blood cell count of one out of
three embassy employes and family members who
were examined.
"There is no connection with microwaves di
rected at the embassy," the notice said. But at the
same time it added: "The cause remains undeter
mined."
"It can only be said that there may be a factor in
the Moscow environment which produces a benign
temporary increase in the circulating blood lym
phocytes in some people."
The notice, which was distributed to all embassy
personnel and other Americans living here, said
additional State Department medical tests had
"failed to find any adverse consequences from the
lymphocytosis."
Brown names coastal commission
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. unveiled
his coastal commission appointments yesterday,
drawing praise from environmentalists.
Brown named publisher Melvin Lane, chairman
of the temporary coastal commission that went out
of existence Dec. 31, and Naomi Schwartz, a
member of a regional coastal commission, to the
new state commission.
The state board will implement California's new
coastal conservation law, a landmark act designed
to protect the state's 1100-mile shoreline from
overdevelopment.
Brown also revealed a five-year $3.3 billion
school finance plan, and Republican leaders

quick'y endorsed it as responsible and realistic.
The plan would, among other things, repeal re
strictions on funds earmarked for handicapped,
gifted and slow-learning children.
Brown, who has said his proposal would require
no new taxes, did not specify where the $3.3 billion
would come from.
Hut Republican Assemblyman Dixon Arnett of
Redwood City said Brown indicated the plan could
be financed by current surpluses in the state treas
ury plus the normal growth of revenues from exist
ing taxes.

San Jose — Striking staff and office workers of
the 90,000-member California State Employes As
sociation (CSEA) expressed guarded optimism yes
terday with the progress of resumed negotiations.
"We are very hopeful," said Gerald Schwartz,
president of the Associated Staff of CSEA. "But
we're not coming off the picket lines until we know
that this is a sincere effort on the part of manage
ment to reach a reasonable contract agreement."
There was no immediate comment from CSEA
management.
Talks resumed yesterday after a breakdown over
the weekend of negotiations that began four
months ago.
Pickets from the 108-member staff began march
ing here, in Sacramento and at six field offices
Monday after the 3V2-year contract failed to win a
two-thirds vote of approval last Thursday.
Moslem gunmen kill four in Beirut
Beirut, Lebanon — Moslem gunmen killed at
least four passers-by in a hit-run raid on a Beirut
street yesterday, the second attack in Christian
areas in two days, a Christian broadcast said.
The Phalange radio reported that six "Com
munist saboteurs" from Moslem west Beirut drove
a Mercedes limousine into the Christian district of
Dowrah and opened fire on passers-by with
machine guns, killing at least four persons and
wounding several others.
The radio said Christian militiamen wounded
and captured the attackers after a chase through the
area's winding back streets. In the car they found
explosives and files belonging to the Communist
Action organization, the Christian broadcast said.
Lebanon's coalition of leftist parties, which in
cludes the Communist Action group, issued a
statement denying involvement in the attacks and
denouncing acts of violence in both sectors of
Beirut.
Minister's suicide stuns Israel
Tel Aviv, Israel — The suicide of Housing Minis
ter Avraham Ofer stunned Israel and was seen by
politicians yesterday as likely to damage Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's chances for re-election in
May.
The death of the minister, who left a note denying
newspaper charges that he profited illegally from
government real estate purchases, overshadowed
Rabin's formal moves to set up a new government.
Rabin resigned two weeks ago, and President
Ephraim Katzir asked him to form a new cabinet to
govern until the election. A bill now in parliament

sets elections for May 17. five months ahead of
schedule. v
Rabin is now a caretaker premier with little
chance of gathering a majority in parliament to *
support a new cabinet. I
Political sources agreed that the scandal and j
suicide would hurt Rabin's campaign to retain the t
premiership. ,
Asbestos cause of student illness? {
Trenton, N.J. — New Jersey officials, alarmed i
that a student may have developed respiratory ill- i
ness from asbestos, said yesterday that they would
survey all the state's 2464 public schools to deter
mine how many have ceilings coated with the
material.
"We want to get it done as soon as we can," said
Peter Freuss, deputy commissioner of the state De
partment of Environmental Protection. "We want
to find out the extent of the problem."
Eight schools in suburban Howell Township
have been closed this week, after a pediatrician said
Joseph Saaff, 13, of the Ramtown school had re
spiratory illness linked to asbestos inhalation.
The substance was used for fireproofing and to
improve acoustics in classrooms and was com
monly used in construction nationwide in the
1950s and 1960s.
FEC chairman investigated
Washington — A Federal Election Commission
(FEC) staff investigation concluded that FEC
Chairman Vernon Thomson apparently violated
the law by telling former Defense Secretary Melvin
Laird of a pending commission investigation.
Thomson denied any wrongdoing in relation to
the investigation of the campaign of Sen. James
Sasser (D-Tenn.), who unseated former Sen. Bill
Brock.
The FEC declined to take action in the case, refer
ring it to Atty. Gen. Edward Levi for action.
The report on the staff investigation, which was
released late Tuesday, concluded that an FEC
employe, Victoria Tigwell, had also revealed the
existence of the Sasser investigation in violation of
the law.
It is violation of federal law for an official to
reveal the existence of an investigation without
permission from the person being investigated.
The staff report sai d that Thomson's comments to
Laird at a Washington club triggered a series of
events that culminated in the publication of a story
in the Nashville, Tenn., Banner on Oct. 25, 1976,
saying that Sasser's campaign records had been
subpoenaed.
A violation of the secrecy provisions of the elec
tion law by a commissioner or FEC employe is a
civil, not criminal, matter. The maximum penalty
for violating the secrecy is a $2000 fine, unless it is a
willful violation, in which the maximum penalty is
a $5000 fine.
