# No shows go to institutions that cost as much

Three out of four students admitted
to Stanford's class of 1980 but decided
to enroll elsewhere chose private in
stitutions of comparable cost, an ad
missions office study shows.
The annual study indicates that half
this group chose four prestigious east
ern schools. Harvard-Radcliffe at
tracted 183, Yale 82, Princeton 61 and
MIT 45.
Berkeley led public institutions,
being chosen by 41 students. Davis
and UCLA followed, with 21 each.
Michigan was fourth with 11.
Other private institutions enrolling
10 or more students admitted by Stan
ford include Brown, 23; Cal Tech, 21;
Dartmouth, 21; Pomona, 18; North
western. 17; Amherst. 13 and Clare
mont Men's College, 10.
According to Provost William Mil
'째r, this is about the fifth year in a row
ti, students accepted here have been
polled as to reasons for why they en
roll. A principle purpose of the study
is to determine whether financial con
ditions are a primary reason for their
choice. "We want to be sensitive to
that," he said.
This year's study, as well as those of
previous years indicates financial con
siderations were secondary.
"The result we see here is compara
ble to the results of institutions with
whom we have a large overlap of ap
plications," Miller said.
When asked what factors "strongly
influenced" their choice of institution,
two-thirds (67 per cent) of those com
ing here said it is "generally more ap
pealing academically."
Dan Howard, co-author of a study
last year of financial aids and minority
admissions, agreed with Miller and
felt these figures supported the con
clusions he drew at the end of his
study.
According to Howard, the univer
sity offers more attractive aid to stu
dents with high academic potential. Its
goal is to attract the most desirable
students, not to help the ones it already
has.
Academic factors and geographic
location were most frequently men
tioned by those students who chose to
enroll at other private institutions.
This group said their institution is
"especially strong in my field(s) of in
terest" (27 per cent), "located where I
want to be" (26 per cent),"generally
more appealing academically" (18 per
cent), "smaller in enrollment" (17 per
cent) and "more congenial for under
graduates" (16 per cent).
Among those choosing public in
stitutions, lower costs were mentioned
most often. The fact that their college
is "less costly" was cited by 69 per cent
of those at state schools. "More attrac
tive financial aid" was mentioned by
27 per cent as a factor strongly in
fluencing their choice.
Overall, Stanford ranks second only
to Harvard among major private uni
versities in the proportion of students
admitted who choose to enroll as
freshmen.

enroll at other private institutions.
This group said their institution is
"especially strong in my field(s) of in
terest" (27 per cent), "located where I
want to be" (26 per cent),"generally
more appealing academically" (18 per
cent), "smaller in enrollment" (17 per
cent) and "more congenial for under
graduates" (16 per cent).
Among those choosing public in
stitutions, lower costs were mentioned
most often. The fact that their college
is "less costly" was cited by 69 per cent
of those at state schools. "More attrac
tive financial aid" was mentioned by
27 per cent as a factor strongly in
fluencing their choice.
Overall, Stanford ranks second only
to Harvard among major private uni
versities in the proportion of students
admitted who choose to enroll as
freshmen.
Three out of four students admitted
to Stanford's class of 1980 but decided
to enroll elsewhere chose private in
stitutions of comparable cost, an ad
missions office study shows.
The annual study indicates that half
this group chose four prestigious east
ern schools. Harvard-Radcliffe at
tracted 183, Yale 82, Princeton 61 and
MIT 45.
Berkeley led public institutions,
being chosen by 41 students. Davis
and UCLA followed, with 21 each.
Michigan was fourth with 11.
Other private institutions enrolling
10 or more students admitted by Stan
ford include Brown, 23; Cal Tech, 21;
Dartmouth, 21; Pomona, 18; North
western. 17; Amherst. 13 and Clare
mont Men's College, 10.
According to Provost William Mil
'째r, this is about the fifth year in a row
ti, students accepted here have been
polled as to reasons for why they en
roll. A principle purpose of the study
is to determine whether financial con
ditions are a primary reason for their
choice. "We want to be sensitive to
that," he said.
This year's study, as well as those of
previous years indicates financial con
siderations were secondary.
"The result we see here is compara
ble to the results of institutions with
whom we have a large overlap of ap
plications," Miller said.
When asked what factors "strongly
influenced" their choice of institution,
two-thirds (67 per cent) of those com
ing here said it is "generally more ap
pealing academically."
Dan Howard, co-author of a study
last year of financial aids and minority
admissions, agreed with Miller and
felt these figures supported the con
clusions he drew at the end of his
study.
According to Howard, the univer
sity offers more attractive aid to stu
dents with high academic potential. Its
goal is to attract the most desirable
students, not to help the ones it already
has.
Academic factors and geographic
location were most frequently men
tioned by those students who chose to
enroll at other private institutions.
