# No shows go to institutions that cost as much

Three out of four students admitted
to Stanford's class of 1980 but decided
to enroll elsewhere chose private in
stitutions of comparable cost, an ad
missions office study shows.
The annual study indicates that half
this group chose four prestigious east
ern schools. Harvard-Radcliffe at
tracted 183, Yale 82, Princeton 61 and
MIT 45.
Berkeley led public institutions,
being chosen by 41 students. Davis
and UCLA followed, with 21 each.
Michigan was fourth with 11.
Other private institutions enrolling
10 or more students admitted by Stan
ford include Brown, 23; Cal Tech, 21;
Dartmouth, 21; Pomona, 18; North
western. 17; Amherst. 13 and Clare
mont Men's College, 10.
According to Provost William Mil
'Â°r, this is about the fifth year in a row
ti, students accepted here have been
polled as to reasons for why they en
roll. A principle purpose of the study
is to determine whether financial con
ditions are a primary reason for their
choice. "We want to be sensitive to
that," he said.
This year's study, as well as those of
previous years indicates financial con
siderations were secondary.
"The result we see here is compara
ble to the results of institutions with
whom we have a large overlap of ap
plications," Miller said.
When asked what factors "strongly
influenced" their choice of institution,
two-thirds (67 per cent) of those com
ing here said it is "generally more ap
pealing academically."
