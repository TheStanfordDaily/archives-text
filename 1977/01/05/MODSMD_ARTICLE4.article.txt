# Menlo Park to decide on Willow Road
## 
### Emiy Sachar 
The Menlo Park City Council will
vote on a proposal to widen Willow
Road from two to four lanes and to
extend the road from Arboretum to El
Camino Jan. 25.
Following approval by the Palo Alto
City Council in the fall of 1976 on the
concept and general alignment of the
road, negotiations continued with
Menlo's city council, according to An
drew Doty, community relations direc
tor here.

Menlo Park wants to insure that the
university would extend Campus
Drive should traffic become too heavy
on Willow Road, according to Doty. In
1974, university trustees approved an
agreement between the university and
Palo Alto regarding this extension.
Second, Menlo's council is in
terested in a 45-acre stretch of land
between Old Creek apartments and the
Stanford Children's Hospital. Menlo
wants to insure minimal development
of that land, said Doty.

"Stanford had previously spoken of
putting housing on this land, but this
will be of less importance now," Doty
said.
Finally, the university has granted a
three acre land parcel to Palo Alto for
$250,000. The university originally
asked $360,000 for the territory.
"We think this is a good com
promise. Having Willow as a better ac
cess route will take some emphasis off
of it," Menlo Park Mayor James Callo
way said.

Funds for the road would come from
the assessment district which includes
the medical center, shopping and pro
fessional centers and Oak Creek
apartments. Property owners along the
road would also be required to help in
its funding. Estimated cost is $4.8 mill
ion, according to Doty.
If approved by the Menlo council,
the proposal would come again before
the Palo Alto council for final consid
eration of details and alignment before
construction, according to Doty.
