## 
### Robert Mauro Staff writer 
Three students here have won suits
filed in small claims court against
Westpark Associates, owner of
Westpark Apartments at 1950 Cooley
Ave. in Palo Alto. The suits have asked
for both recovery of the housing de
posit and punitive damages, according
to Dave Brown of the Stanford Con
sumer Services Center.
According to Brown, the deposit
was withheld in order to pay for un
needed cleaning and repairs of the
apartments vacated by the students.
Maurice Broner, general partner of
Westpark Associates, said that only
necessary cleaning had been done.
"We have set standards and we have
cleaned these apartments up to that
standard so that the next tenant does
have a clean apartment. In many of
these cases we have refunded the dif
ference between what it costs to clean
up the apartment and what the tenant
has to put up," he said.
According to Broner, the suits have
been won by the tenants because
". . . the courts seem to award to the
plaintiff. . .it's part of doing business
in this business."
Rita Ozimek, a tenant, said that
maintenance and security services
have greatly decreased since Broner
gained control of the apartments.
Decreased services
"There are no longer maids to clean
out the hall, elevators, laundry room
and entries. Algae is growing in the
swimming pool, he turned off the
(pool) heater, at 10 p.m. the pool lights
go off, . . . the area is patrolled three
times a night; that's all they've been
contracted for. We used to have two
guards on the premises. Cars have
been broken into, women have been
attacked in the parking lots."
According to Ozimek, the mainte
nance is now handled solely by the
manager. Broner said that mainte
nance and security services had not
declined.
"1 don't know what maintenance
personnel that they're talking about. I
replaced a handyman with a company
whose business is to do maintenance
work. I would say that's hardly cutting
down on maintenance. Titan security
services still provides security from
dusk to dawn on a random basis," said
Broner.

According to Broner, Baron Laws, a
maintenance company, has been hired
to do some of the maintenance.
Erving Ingham of Consumers United
of Palo Alto said Baron Laws may not
be an actual company.
Non-existent?
"We're not even sure it (Baron Laws)
exists outside the mind of the owner of
the apartments. It may be a method to
falsely inflate the costs. We have not
found it anywhere; it may be a little
gnome hiding in the cellar," said In
gham.
"They (Baron Laws) are a mainte
nance company, licensed in the city of
Campbell. They sub-rent an office
from me so they're convenient when 1
need them," said Broner. Baron Laws
has rented an office within Broiler's
suite.
Ozimek said that organization of the
tenants was originally resisted by
Broner.
"The owner showed up at our sec
ond (tenants') meeting with three sec
urity guards and thought he would do
a number, but we forced him to leave,"
said Ozimek.
A suit of unlawful detainer was filed
against Ozimek by Broner but an out
of-court settlement was reached.
Broner also said that he encouraged
the tenant meetings and allowed them
to use his property.

"There are no longer maids to clean
out the hall, elevators, laundry room
and entries. Algae is growing in the
swimming pool, he turned off the
(pool) heater, at 10 p.m. the pool lights
go off, . . . the area is patrolled three
times a night; that's all they've been
contracted for. We used to have two
guards on the premises. Cars have
been broken into, women have been
attacked in the parking lots."
According to Ozimek, the mainte
nance is now handled solely by the
manager. Broner said that mainte
nance and security services had not
declined.
"1 don't know what maintenance
personnel that they're talking about. I
replaced a handyman with a company
whose business is to do maintenance
work. I would say that's hardly cutting
down on maintenance. Titan security
services still provides security from
dusk to dawn on a random basis," said
Broner.

According to Broner, Baron Laws, a
maintenance company, has been hired
to do some of the maintenance.
Erving Ingham of Consumers United
of Palo Alto said Baron Laws may not
be an actual company.
Non-existent?
"We're not even sure it (Baron Laws)
exists outside the mind of the owner of
the apartments. It may be a method to
falsely inflate the costs. We have not
found it anywhere; it may be a little
gnome hiding in the cellar," said In
gham.
"They (Baron Laws) are a mainte
nance company, licensed in the city of
Campbell. They sub-rent an office
from me so they're convenient when 1
need them," said Broner. Baron Laws
has rented an office within Broiler's
suite.
Ozimek said that organization of the
tenants was originally resisted by
Broner.
"The owner showed up at our sec
ond (tenants') meeting with three sec
urity guards and thought he would do
a number, but we forced him to leave,"
said Ozimek.
A suit of unlawful detainer was filed
against Ozimek by Broner but an out
of-court settlement was reached.
Broner also said that he encouraged
the tenant meetings and allowed them
to use his property.
Three students here have won suits
filed in small claims court against
Westpark Associates, owner of
Westpark Apartments at 1950 Cooley
Ave. in Palo Alto. The suits have asked
for both recovery of the housing de
posit and punitive damages, according
to Dave Brown of the Stanford Con
sumer Services Center.
According to Brown, the deposit
was withheld in order to pay for un
needed cleaning and repairs of the
apartments vacated by the students.
Maurice Broner, general partner of
Westpark Associates, said that only
necessary cleaning had been done.
"We have set standards and we have
cleaned these apartments up to that
standard so that the next tenant does
have a clean apartment. In many of
these cases we have refunded the dif
ference between what it costs to clean
up the apartment and what the tenant
has to put up," he said.
According to Broner, the suits have
been won by the tenants because
". . . the courts seem to award to the
plaintiff. . .it's part of doing business
in this business."
Rita Ozimek, a tenant, said that
maintenance and security services
have greatly decreased since Broner
gained control of the apartments.
