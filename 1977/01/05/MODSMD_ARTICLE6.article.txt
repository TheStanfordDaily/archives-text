# $28 million contract let on project
## 
### Louise Anderson 
An Oakland engineering firm and
San Francisco organization have been
awarded a university contract to carry
out the engineering of the $28 million
facility that will house the Positron
Electron Colliding Beam Storage Ring
Project (PEP).
The firms in the joint engineering
venture to build the assorted tunnels
and buildings here are Kaiser En
gineers of Oakland and Parsons,
Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas
(PBQ&D), Inc.
The total cost of the PEP project is
assessed at $78 million. Management
of the project will be shared by Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
(LBL) of the University of California.
John Rees of SLAC is project director
and Tom Elioff of LBL is deputy direc
tor. Completion of the entire PEP pro
ject is scheduled for 1980.
According to Robert Lamar, science
editor for the Stanford News Service,
the Energy Research and Development
Administration (ERDA) is financing
PEP.
"ERDA is the government agency
which took over this type of research
support from the Atomic Energy
Commission (AEC). It was the AEC
that originally supported SLAC, not t
only its construction, but continued to a
support its operation when it was
built. That was all taken over by ERDA a
when the AEC was disbanded." he {
said. 4 i
"PEP is a new high energy research f
facility which is expected to yield new (
insights into the fundamental struc
ture of matterand energy. It is a storage (
ring in which beams of electrons and ,
positrons circulate in opposite direc- \
tions within a vacuum chamber lo- ,
cated in a magnetic guide field. The |
electrons and positrons will be pro
duced in the already existing two-mile ,
long accelerator at SI.AC and then in
jected into the storage ring," according ,
to a SLAC news release.
Particles in the universe
Burton Richter, physics professor at
SLAC and this year's Nobel laureate in
physics explained that high energy
physics research is "basically locating
the forces between elementary parti
cles and trying to define the number of
the elementary particles. If you know
how many and if you know what the
force laws are, then you know how the
physical universe is put together."
Rees explained that at SLAC, elec
trons and positrons are accelerated
and slammed against stationary par
ticles in a material target.
"That's a way of knocking materials
apart and seeing what the constituents
of them are. The disadvantage of that is
that the particle that's moving and the
one that's at rest in the target has its
center of mass in motion and the whole
system has to recoil," Rees said.
Bowling balls
He used an analogy to further exp
lain the accelerator workings.
"What we're trying to do is hit one
particle with another and convey as
much energy as we can. Suppose you
, were to roll a bowling ball at a statio
nary ping pong ball. When the bowl
ing ball hit the ping pong ball the ping
i pong ball would recoil, the bowling
• ball would scarcely slow down and
they'd both roll off in the direction the
j bowling ball had started in. There'd be
f very little energy available to the colli
r sion between the two. ...
"If we want to find out how the ping
! pong ball and the bowling ball interact
with each other, we'd want as much
. energy as possible available to the in
i teraction.
j "But let's take a situation that is
i analogous to the storage ring," he went
; on. "That is, we take two bowling balls
and we roll them in opposite direc
tions so they strike head on. If the two
bowling balls are going at exactly the
same speed when they strike each
other, they stop. That means that there
I was available to those two bowling
I balls the total energy that has been in
> vested in them. That's the maximum
energy that you can get into a collision.

"That's exactly what a storage ring
does. It takes electrons and circulates
them around in one direction, going
around a roughly circular object and it
takes the anti-particle, the positron,
and circulates it in the opposite direc
tion in the same machine. So they're
like two bowling balls that slam into
each other at chosen points around the
circumference of the machine.
"There are six points in PEP where
those collisions take place and the sum
of the energy of the two particles is
then available for (he interaction bet
ween them. It's enormously greater
than we could achieve by building a
single machine to slam electrons into
stationary positrons," Rees said.
"We don't have any idea of what the
ultimate application will be of the
knowledge we gain from PEP," Rees
said. "I'm confident that someday
people will find a way to use it because
that's always been the way with scien
tific discovery."
Richter said, "It's just too early to say
what the practical applications of this
work are. With most basic discoveries,
it's kind of typically 50 years until
practical things come out of them.
We're in the very early years now."

Administration (ERDA) is financing
PEP.
"ERDA is the government agency
which took over this type of research
support from the Atomic Energy
Commission (AEC). It was the AEC
that originally supported SLAC, not t
only its construction, but continued to a
support its operation when it was
built. That was all taken over by ERDA a
when the AEC was disbanded." he {

"PEP is a new high energy research f
facility which is expected to yield new (
insights into the fundamental struc
ture of matterand energy. It is a storage (
ring in which beams of electrons and ,
positrons circulate in opposite direc- \
tions within a vacuum chamber lo- ,
cated in a magnetic guide field. The |
electrons and positrons will be pro
duced in the already existing two-mile ,
long accelerator at SI.AC and then in
jected into the storage ring," according ,
to a SLAC news release.
Particles in the universe
Burton Richter, physics professor at
SLAC and this year's Nobel laureate in
physics explained that high energy
physics research is "basically locating
the forces between elementary parti
cles and trying to define the number of
the elementary particles. If you know
how many and if you know what the
force laws are, then you know how the
physical universe is put together."
Rees explained that at SLAC, elec
trons and positrons are accelerated
and slammed against stationary par
ticles in a material target.
"That's a way of knocking materials
apart and seeing what the constituents
of them are. The disadvantage of that is
that the particle that's moving and the
one that's at rest in the target has its
center of mass in motion and the whole
system has to recoil," Rees said.
Bowling balls
He used an analogy to further exp
lain the accelerator workings.
"What we're trying to do is hit one
particle with another and convey as
much energy as we can. Suppose you
, were to roll a bowling ball at a statio
nary ping pong ball. When the bowl
ing ball hit the ping pong ball the ping
i pong ball would recoil, the bowling
• ball would scarcely slow down and
they'd both roll off in the direction the
j bowling ball had started in. There'd be
f very little energy available to the colli
r sion between the two. ...
"If we want to find out how the ping
! pong ball and the bowling ball interact
with each other, we'd want as much
. energy as possible available to the in
i teraction.
j "But let's take a situation that is
i analogous to the storage ring," he went
; on. "That is, we take two bowling balls
and we roll them in opposite direc
tions so they strike head on. If the two
bowling balls are going at exactly the
same speed when they strike each
other, they stop. That means that there
I was available to those two bowling
I balls the total energy that has been in
> vested in them. That's the maximum
energy that you can get into a collision.

"That's exactly what a storage ring
does. It takes electrons and circulates
them around in one direction, going
around a roughly circular object and it
takes the anti-particle, the positron,
and circulates it in the opposite direc
tion in the same machine. So they're
like two bowling balls that slam into
each other at chosen points around the
circumference of the machine.
"There are six points in PEP where
those collisions take place and the sum
of the energy of the two particles is
then available for (he interaction bet
ween them. It's enormously greater
than we could achieve by building a
single machine to slam electrons into
stationary positrons," Rees said.
"We don't have any idea of what the
ultimate application will be of the
knowledge we gain from PEP," Rees
said. "I'm confident that someday
people will find a way to use it because
that's always been the way with scien
tific discovery."
Richter said, "It's just too early to say
what the practical applications of this
work are. With most basic discoveries,
it's kind of typically 50 years until
practical things come out of them.
We're in the very early years now."
An Oakland engineering firm and
San Francisco organization have been
awarded a university contract to carry
out the engineering of the $28 million
facility that will house the Positron
Electron Colliding Beam Storage Ring
Project (PEP).
The firms in the joint engineering
venture to build the assorted tunnels
and buildings here are Kaiser En
gineers of Oakland and Parsons,
Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas
(PBQ&D), Inc.
The total cost of the PEP project is
assessed at $78 million. Management
of the project will be shared by Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
(LBL) of the University of California.
John Rees of SLAC is project director

Burton Richter, physics professor at
SLAC and this year's Nobel laureate in
physics explained that high energy
physics research is "basically locating
the forces between elementary parti
cles and trying to define the number of
the elementary particles. If you know
how many and if you know what the
force laws are, then you know how the
physical universe is put together."
Rees explained that at SLAC, elec
trons and positrons are accelerated
and slammed against stationary par
ticles in a material target.
"That's a way of knocking materials
apart and seeing what the constituents
of them are. The disadvantage of that is
that the particle that's moving and the
one that's at rest in the target has its
center of mass in motion and the whole
system has to recoil," Rees said.
Bowling balls
He used an analogy to further exp
lain the accelerator workings.
"What we're trying to do is hit one
particle with another and convey as
much energy as we can. Suppose you
, were to roll a bowling ball at a statio
nary ping pong ball. When the bowl
ing ball hit the ping pong ball the ping
i pong ball would recoil, the bowling
• ball would scarcely slow down and
they'd both roll off in the direction the
j bowling ball had started in. There'd be
f very little energy available to the colli
r sion between the two. ...
"If we want to find out how the ping
! pong ball and the bowling ball interact
with each other, we'd want as much
. energy as possible available to the in
i teraction.
j "But let's take a situation that is
i analogous to the storage ring," he went
; on. "That is, we take two bowling balls
and we roll them in opposite direc
tions so they strike head on. If the two
bowling balls are going at exactly the
same speed when they strike each
other, they stop. That means that there
I was available to those two bowling
I balls the total energy that has been in
> vested in them. That's the maximum
energy that you can get into a collision.

"That's exactly what a storage ring
does. It takes electrons and circulates
them around in one direction, going
around a roughly circular object and it
takes the anti-particle, the positron,
and circulates it in the opposite direc
tion in the same machine. So they're
like two bowling balls that slam into
each other at chosen points around the
circumference of the machine.
"There are six points in PEP where
those collisions take place and the sum
of the energy of the two particles is
then available for (he interaction bet
ween them. It's enormously greater
than we could achieve by building a
single machine to slam electrons into
stationary positrons," Rees said.
"We don't have any idea of what the
ultimate application will be of the
knowledge we gain from PEP," Rees
said. "I'm confident that someday
people will find a way to use it because
that's always been the way with scien
tific discovery."
Richter said, "It's just too early to say
what the practical applications of this
work are. With most basic discoveries,
it's kind of typically 50 years until
practical things come out of them.
We're in the very early years now."
An Oakland engineering firm and
San Francisco organization have been
awarded a university contract to carry
out the engineering of the $28 million
facility that will house the Positron
Electron Colliding Beam Storage Ring
Project (PEP).
The firms in the joint engineering
venture to build the assorted tunnels
and buildings here are Kaiser En
gineers of Oakland and Parsons,
Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas
(PBQ&D), Inc.
The total cost of the PEP project is
assessed at $78 million. Management
of the project will be shared by Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
(LBL) of the University of California.
John Rees of SLAC is project director
and Tom Elioff of LBL is deputy direc
tor. Completion of the entire PEP pro
ject is scheduled for 1980.
According to Robert Lamar, science
editor for the Stanford News Service,
the Energy Research and Development
Administration (ERDA) is financing
PEP.
"ERDA is the government agency
which took over this type of research
support from the Atomic Energy
Commission (AEC). It was the AEC
that originally supported SLAC, not t
only its construction, but continued to a
support its operation when it was
built. That was all taken over by ERDA a
when the AEC was disbanded." he {
said. 4 i
"PEP is a new high energy research f
facility which is expected to yield new (
insights into the fundamental struc
ture of matterand energy. It is a storage (
ring in which beams of electrons and ,
positrons circulate in opposite direc- \
tions within a vacuum chamber lo- ,
cated in a magnetic guide field. The |
electrons and positrons will be pro
duced in the already existing two-mile ,
long accelerator at SI.AC and then in
jected into the storage ring," according ,
to a SLAC news release.
