"Leland Stanford, Leland Stanford, please come to the
United Airlines ticket counter."
"Robert Baron, Robert Baron, you have a call at the
United Airlines ticket counter."
â€”Anonymous voice on
loudspeaker at San Jose
Municipal Airport Dec. 16
It was that time again. Students trudged through the
automatic doors at San Jose Municipal Airport, laden with
heavy suitcases and thick winter coats. They struggled
over to the ticket counter where they lined up to check in.
After sending their luggage on its ride on the conveyor
belt, some of them gathered in small clusters chatting
excitedly as they headed for the gates.
One student rushed to the nearest chair and sat down,
madly scribbling down words on a writting pad. Periodi
cally she looked at her watch and then returned to her
writing. Minutes before her plane departed she thrust the
pad at a friend seeing her off. The friend would turn in the
student's take-home final the next day.
And then there were those who occupied themselves by
paging legendary and not-so-legendary spirits on the
white courtesy telephone.
It was that time again. Christmas. More than 1600 Stan
ford students and faculty members filed through the doors
at San Jose and San Francisco International Airport on
their way to one of nine charters to Washington D.C.,
Boston. Chicago and New York.
During every major holiday break students and faculty
members take advantage of the ASSU Travel Service's
charters and fly home or to a vacation spot for nearly $100
less than the commercial rate.
More flyers
This Christmas break "more people used it (the char
ters) than ever before," according to Joe Hess, manager of
the travel service. The ASSU grossed about $325,000 from
the flights and will pay United and TWA approximately
$310,000 for the use of the planes and the crew. Hess said.
The remaining amount will be used to pay ASSU Travel
Service administrative costs and office expenses, he said.
Most planes are chartered for gamblers heading to Las
Vegas, tourists on their way to Hawaii and football teams
heading for victory or defeat. But charters full of students
on the way to home-cooked meals and days of sleep are
uncommon.
Steward John Radican, who has been with United for
2Vi years, described Stanford students as atypical charter
passengers.

"Charters people think they have special privileges.
They think the airplane is theirs," he said.
'Atypical' passengers
Many of the passengers on the Las Vegas charters
"throw things down the aisles" and stand up around their
seats, disrupting the crew's service. Stanford students are
different, he said.
"I've never had so many thank yous and pleases. It's
incredible," Radican remarked.
One Stanford charter was different in another way, too.
Usually on charters the stock of a particular brand of
liquor is depleted. On United flight No. 5884, the atten
dants ran out of milk, orange juice and Seven-Up first.
Julie Riody, United flight attendant for seven years, said
she felt the crew and the students shared a "mutual re
spect" which she did not find with "normal people," her
term for commercial passengers.
Riody said the students treated the crew members as
equals while most commercial passengers "ignored the
presence of the stews."
Regular passengers sometimes compete for attention,
she said. When one person rings the call button, another
passenger feels neglected. Riody said.
With students, a "feeling of well-being creates a certain
calmness," she said. Because the students are less de
manding and do not treat the attendants as sex objects, the
attendants do not need to be as official and reserved,
according to Riody.
The crew in the cockpit should not treat the football
players, students or tourists any differently than commer
cial passengers, according to the pilots of United charter
from Washington D.C.
As the long-range DC-8 accelerated down the Dulles
International Airport runway and slowly lifted its tires off
the ground, a member of the cockpit crew explained the
weight of the plane, the weather conditions and flight
route to the 173 passengers buckled into their seats.
The sleepy passengers, many of whom had slept on
airport couches the night before in order to catch the 6:30
a.m. flight, took in the pilot's sober facts with little re
sponse.
In contrast, the pilot on the flight leaving San Francisco
joked over the loudspeaker in a thick southern drawl. The
spirit group cheered and applauded. When the DC-8
touched down at Dulles at 4 a.m. (PST), a supportive roar
of clapping burst from the passengers.
Back in San Francisco Jan. 2, the stewardess welcomed
the students, "Thank you again for flying United and
enjoy the rain." There was no applause.
