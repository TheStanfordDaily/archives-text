## Separatism stands alone 
### 
Marc Strassman

Separatist movements and parties
have been enjoying increasing success
recently in many parts of the world.
This phenomenon deserves our atten
tion because of its growing incidence.
It ought to be explained on account of
the insight into current political trends
such an explanation might provide.
And it should be encouraged because
of the possible good its intelligent pur
suit might offer.
Separatist parties have been ex
periencing electoral victories of such
magnitude lately to surprise even the
party stalwarts themselves. The Parti
Quebecois, the electoral representa
tive of the French-speaking separatist
movement that seeks the withdrawal
of Quebec province from the Canadian
federation and the establishment of an
independent nation there, recently
won 41 per cent of the vote in provin
cial elections and also control of the
provincial government. ReneLeveque,
leader of the party, has promised a re
ferendum on independence within
two years.
Scottish and Welsh nationalists
have won increased representation in
the current British parliament, and
have generated sufficient interest and
concern about their nationalist goals
that the ruling labor government
moved last month to offer a plan for
"devolution" of certain government
functions to elected regional as
semblies in Wales and Scotland.
Nationalist leaders in the two coun
tries are willing to accept the devolu
tion proposals, but see them merely as
steps towards greater independence,
including the eventual assumption
of the fundamental responsibilities of
economic and international self
determination.
National autonomy
The Basque populations of northern
Spain and southern France have also
expressed themselves forcefully in the
last few years on the subject of their
national autonomy. This expression
most often took the form of anti
government violence in Franco-ruled
Spa in and the new government of King
Juan Carlos has seen fit to grant certain
minor concessions to Basque
nationalists in an effort to secure grea
ter loyalty from them towards the cent
ral regime in Madrid to diffuse
separatist sentiment in the area.
The reasons for secessionist and reg
ional movements are as varied as the
regions involved, but there are some
common elements. Usually, the
separatists movement draws on feel
ings of oppression and economic and
cultural subjugation imposed upon
the people by the dominant central au
thority.
But there are more contemporary
causes of separatism, which represents
quite a bit more than a feeling of racial
separatism going back to pre-nation
state times. The growing complexity
and centralization of modern
economic and administrative organi
zation forms, particularly the modern
bureaucratic national government and
the contemporary national and multi
national corporation, in conjunction
with ever-more effective and saturat
ing networks of communication, par
ticularly television, are creating a con
tradictory universe of expectations
within which a growing number of in
dividuals are shown a world of physi
cal gratification and almost mythical
self-determination that they do not
find themselves experiencing in their
daily lives.
Compared to long-ago tribal or
feudal days, when individuals lived
within a social context that assured
them of their intrinsic worth and in
dispensability to their community,
people living today in modern nation
states and within the social context of
mammoth corporations cannot feel
rootedness or autonomy in their social
lives.
They cannot do this within the con
text of the nation-state or the global
corporation. As one result of this situa
tion dnd these feelings the eligible
voters in America didn't vote in the
1976 presidential elections. And as
another result, growing numbers of
people all around the world join and

support movements of separatism and
regionalism in hopes of breaking their
social world down to a manageable
size.
Benefits
This analysis leads logically to the
conclusion that separatism, which
arises out of certain fundamental con
tradictions of the dominant contem
porary forms of social and economic
organization, ought to be encouraged
precisely because it offers a resolution
of these contradictions. It also ought to
be encouraged for at least two other
reasons: diversity and peace.
With the creation of a multiplicity of
smaller states in place of a few large
ones, the possibilities for experimenta
tion, diversity and regional individu
ality would be greatly increased. With
the withering away of the continental
state, the oppressive sameness that has
been casting its cultural and
psychological pall over much of the
world since the end of the second
world war would be diminished, and
some of the virtues of small town life,
like a sense of community and a fuel
ing of real control over one's life,
might reappear.
Further, with each person's vote and
voice making up a larger share of the
nations' collective decision-making
machinery, that decision-making sys
tem will be brought closer to everyone,
and the polity will benefit, as will any
organism, from a system of feedback
and self-control that can be more re
sponsive to the desires of its con
stituent parts.
Mobilization
Without continental nation states, it
will become more difficult to mobilize
the tremendous conglomerations of
soldiers and weapons necessary for
war. And since the disintegration of
the modern warfare state derives from
social and historical forces that oper
ate in the Soviet Union as well as in the
United States, there ought to be a
simultaneous breaking apart that will
prevent either side from doing some
thing foolish to the other in their last
years.
A further benefit to be derived from
the creation of many smaller countries
in place of a few big ones is that such a
transformation ought to lead, through
the implementation or unfolding of
economic principles and personal pre
ferences, to the establishment of a
more reasonable urban-rural popula
tion ratio, with more people living in
self-sufficient rural settings and fewer
people existing in urban jungles that
drain the countryside of their produce
and energy and their own residents of
necessary contact with the land that
ultimately supports them and the
inner realities that ultimately sustain
them.
The movement to a decentralized,
small-state world will not be without
obstacles or opponents. The multina
tional corporation, the creature of the
modern nation state that now
threatens to devour its creator, and all
its executives, as well as the bureauc
rats that live off the material and
psychic products of the giant state,
have a lot to lose with the disintegra
tion of the nation state. It will mean the
destruction of their trough. They can
be expected tofight vigorously in their
own defense.
Carter
The recent victory and approaching
ascension to national power of Ceor
gian Jimmy Carter is significant in at
least two ways to the matter under
discussion here. First, as the first pres
ident elected from the deep South in
over a hundred years, Carter repre
sents the contemporary assertion of
regional power and pride from that
part of the American nation that once
made the single most determined ef
fort to assert its own separatist tenden
-1 cies.
And second, if the current con
troversy over increases in the price of
steel and the president-elect's inability
to do anything about the determina
tion of giant corporations to impose
their desires against the wishes and
interests of millions of private indi
viduals is any indication of what is
going to happen in cases like this in

the near future, then what we may be
seeing is the first stage in the
emergence of new forms of corporate
hegemony, accompanied by a corres
ponding reduction in the power of the
presidency.
The presidency is an institution that
has grown to its current status of
power and prominence because it was
acting in concert with giant corpora
tions' efforts to consolidate their
power in the post-World War 11 period.
If President-elect Carter's populism
leads him to principled and deter
mined opposition to corporate policies
and interests. Then there may occur an
effort to replace presidential power
with the naked wielding of power by
the economic czars themselves or by
them through some new figurehead
that they will chose to provide for us
(for example, the B-movie star who
was once thegovernmor of California).
In any case, those who stand to lose
from the growth of separatism in the
United States and elsewhere can be
expected to oppose such trends. Those â– 
who stand to gain from changes of this
kind should support separatism.
