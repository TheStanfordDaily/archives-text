'Naive and arrogant'
I am saddened by your naive and
arrogant editorial criticizing Palo Al
to's recent massage parlor crack-down.
I suggest you sit hack and ponder this
social problem a while; I think it will
add to your wisdom.
First of all. the Palo Alto community
has the right and responsibility to in
vestigate and rid itself of blighting
conditions and 1 consider their action
commendable and courageous, not
repressive, as you call it.
Furthermore, to call prostitution a
"victimless crime" seems to me to he
self-indulgently blind. There are vic
tims — the prostitutes themselves,
their families, children, etc. — whose

complaints you will be aware of in
some form in the future.
I don't think it would be too difficult
to trace some of the roots of many
anti-social actions back to the pathetic
effects of prostitution. In fact. I suggest
you consider the fact that perhaps the
police and other social agencies in
volved are attempting in this en
lightened way to solve present and el
minate some future murders, thefts
and assaults.
Again I earnestly suggest you stop
and think.
