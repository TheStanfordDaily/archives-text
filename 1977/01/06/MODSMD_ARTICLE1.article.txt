# Officials still investigating Stilwell case
## 
### Elizabeth Pollock Staff writer 
No official action has been taker
against Assoc. Anatomy Prof. Donald
Stilwell who sent a possibly unsol
icited letter of recommendation dis
cussing 43 students to medical schools
last quarter.
University officials have not yet re
solved legal and ethical questions sur
rounding the incident.
The Academic Information Center
learned of the letter in late October but
did not notify the students involved
until mid-November because the uni
versity's legal responsibilities were
unclear. AIC agreed to write letters on
behalf of students notifying medical
schools that Stilwell is not an official
pre-rned adviser. Stilwell had the let
ter removed from students' files.
In mid-December, President Richard
Lyman requested Provost William Mil
ler to look into the matter, according to
James Siena, legal adviser to the presi
dent.
Siena said matters involving faculty
members are treated in confidence "at
this stage."
Miller said, "There isn't anything to
say at the moment," but "the question
is being investigated."
No university policy on recommen
dation procedures exists, but Miller
explained that both students and per
sons outside the university can solicit
comments from faculty. Miller would
not comment on the issues raised if
Stilwell's letter were unsolicited.
In an interview last quarter Siena
explained that if a student has not
signed a waiver, he or she may see
letters ot recommendation on file, but
only if the student has already been
accepted and has enrolled in the
school.
Stilwell has said he marked the let
ter "Confidential," and therefore,
whoever gave it to the AIC had no right
to do so. Siena, on the other hand, said
that a letter cannot be confidential
until another party agrees to keep it
confidential.
Admissions officers at Tufts Uni
versity Medical School had "no idea
how to handle the letter" and threw it
away, according to a student who
overheard them talking. The particip
ants in the conversation were "trying
to figure out what possessed him
(Stilwell) to do it,"and "were wonder
ing what was going to happen to him,"
the student said.
John Steward, associate dean of stu
dent affairs at the medical school here,
had not seen the actual letter but said it
"was so distinct and unique and un
precedented that it would im
mediately raise questions of legiti
macy and validity, and 1 doubt that any
medical school would give it consid
eration."
Steward explained that the admis
sions faculty here "just take essentially
what we get" in recommendations. He
explained that different schools use
different formats but Stanford decided
not to prepare a composite of profes
sors' comments for each student. In
stead, each student applying to
graduate school asks individual fa
culty members to send letters of re
commendation.

that a letter cannot be confidential
until another party agrees to keep it
confidential.
Admissions officers at Tufts Uni
versity Medical School had "no idea
how to handle the letter" and threw it
away, according to a student who
overheard them talking. The particip
ants in the conversation were "trying
to figure out what possessed him
(Stilwell) to do it,"and "were wonder
ing what was going to happen to him,"
the student said.
John Steward, associate dean of stu
dent affairs at the medical school here,
had not seen the actual letter but said it
"was so distinct and unique and un
precedented that it would im
mediately raise questions of legiti
macy and validity, and 1 doubt that any
medical school would give it consid
eration."
Steward explained that the admis
sions faculty here "just take essentially
what we get" in recommendations. He
explained that different schools use
different formats but Stanford decided
not to prepare a composite of profes
sors' comments for each student. In
stead, each student applying to
graduate school asks individual fa
culty members to send letters of re
commendation.
No official action has been taker
against Assoc. Anatomy Prof. Donald
Stilwell who sent a possibly unsol
icited letter of recommendation dis
cussing 43 students to medical schools
last quarter.
University officials have not yet re
solved legal and ethical questions sur
rounding the incident.
The Academic Information Center
learned of the letter in late October but
did not notify the students involved
until mid-November because the uni
versity's legal responsibilities were
unclear. AIC agreed to write letters on
behalf of students notifying medical
schools that Stilwell is not an official
pre-rned adviser. Stilwell had the let
ter removed from students' files.
In mid-December, President Richard
Lyman requested Provost William Mil
ler to look into the matter, according to
James Siena, legal adviser to the presi
dent.
Siena said matters involving faculty
members are treated in confidence "at
this stage."
Miller said, "There isn't anything to
say at the moment," but "the question
is being investigated."
No university policy on recommen
dation procedures exists, but Miller
explained that both students and per
sons outside the university can solicit
comments from faculty. Miller would
not comment on the issues raised if
Stilwell's letter were unsolicited.
In an interview last quarter Siena
explained that if a student has not
signed a waiver, he or she may see
letters ot recommendation on file, but
only if the student has already been
accepted and has enrolled in the
school.
Stilwell has said he marked the let
ter "Confidential," and therefore,
whoever gave it to the AIC had no right
to do so. Siena, on the other hand, said
that a letter cannot be confidential
until another party agrees to keep it
confidential.
