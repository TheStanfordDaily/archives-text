# Warren Christopher's many and varied pursuits
## 
### 
(Editor's note: Bill Evers wrote the fol
lowing column in (wo parts in the Oct.
19 and 20, 1972 Daily. Trustee Warren
Christopher was designated last week
as deputy secretary of state in the Car
ter Administration, and his
background is again a relevant issue.)
Who is Warren Christopher? Ac
cording to the Oct. 10 (1972) Daily, he
is a new trustee of Stanford University.
His selection was announced on July
17.
There are many facets to the career of
Warren Christopher. Within the short
compass of this column, I will concen
trate on just three of them: 1) Christ
opher's association with the law firm
of O'Melveny & Myers; 2) his experi
ence and expertise in the 1 control of
urban unrest; and 3) his relationship to
higher education.
In September 1970, Scanlon's
Monthly ran an article by Warren
Hinckle entitled, "The Law Firm That
Runs California." It was about O'Mel
veny & Myers, the firm which Christ
opher has practiced law with since
1950. He has been a partner since 1958.
Interestingly enough, the next trus
tee to be named to the board after
Christopher was Robert Woolsey, who
worked for O'Melveny & Myers before
becoming general counsel to the U.S.
Senate Armed Services Committee.
While the fact that this firm has just
had two lawyers put on the board gives
one some idea of the O'Melveny &
Myers influence in the state, the full
extent of that influence, as described
by Scanlon's, is almost unbelievable:
'This firm has already been instru
mental in electing both of California's
incumbant senators and its last two
governors. It is now in a can't-lose pos

ition with its partners or principals di
rectly running three — and directly or
indirectly helping finance all four — of
the 1970 campaigns of both the Repub
lican and Democratic nominees for
senator and governor.
"The firm handles a surfeit of
California's financial business
through its dominant position in the
preparation of state, county and
municipal bond issues. The same firm
has as corporate clients a majority of
the giant enterprises who in the aggre
gate literally own California — from

oil and aerospace combines to the re
alty trusts."
After detailing the origins of the firm
and its political connections, Hinckle
writes that although people through
out the firm — from John O'Melveny
on down — help with maintaining the
firm's political ties, "there can be only
one Cardinal Richelieu, and at O'Mel
veny & Myers the man who carries the
Holy Ghost within him is Warren
Christopher."
Hinckle contends that "Christopher
must be given the credit or blame for
guiding the firm into the uncommon
role as surrogate for electoral politics
in California."
Hinckle's argument is that politics
in anomalous California is not or
ganized so extensively into ethnic, re
ligious and other interest groups as it
is elsewhere in the United States.
Therefore, an opportunity existed for
Warren Christopher and his O'Mel
veny & Myers team of lawyers to wrest
control of the state-level command
posts of the GOP and the Democratic
party over the course of 10 years of
hard work.
Of fundamental importance in
Christopher's strategy,-according to
Hinckle, was involving the firm in
Democratic party politics — thereby
putting the firm on both sides of the
fence. "Since it already had the Repub
licans, the important corporations and
through its bond busi ness the cities, all
it needed was Democrats and it had the
state for all practical purposes."
In the concluding section of the arti
cle, Hinckle shows that there is what
he considers to be convincing evi
dence that Christopher was the mas
termind behind two famous "smears"

in California politics. The first was Pat
Brown's attempt to make San Fran
cisco Mayor George Christopher ap
pear to be a criminal. The second was
John Tunney's attempt to make Rep.
George Brown appear to be anti-Israel
and in favor of terrorism in the United
States.
In 1965, Pat Brown appointed his
adviser Warren Christopher to the
gubernatorial commission to study the
Watts riots and gave Christopher the
post of vice-chairman on the commis
sion. The chairman was John McCone,
former head of the Central Intelligence
Agency.
In July 1967, Christopher, then an
LBJ appointee to the Justice Depart
ment's number two spot (deputy attor
ney general of the United States), was
on the scene in Detroit during the un
rest in that city. Because he was ex
perienced and fairly knowledgeable
on that subject, Christopher was
Johnson's principal civilian adviser on
such urbaqu^Jisorders.
In addithoh to "his direct work on
containing urban unrest, as Ramsey
Clark's aide and right hand man, Chris
topher handled the Justice Depart
ment's legislative program which
dealt with siirih matters as increasing
government fcontrol of/firearms in the
hands of citizens.
Christopher was president of the
California Coordinating Committee for
Higher Education from 1963 to 1965.
Once again, it was a case of Brown
appointing his own political adviser.
The coordinating council was a
body which had been set up by the
Master Plan Survey Team. Its purpose
was to implement and supervise the
operation of a new program for higher
education in California.
William Barlow and Peter Shapiro
describe the origins of the new prog
ram in their book. An End to Silence:
"The corporate elite had begun to
take an intense interest of its own in
the plight of higher education in the
state in the early 19505. The pheno
menal industrial growth (largely cen
tered around aerospace, electronics
and other defense-related industries)
had created for private enterprise some
exorbitant new expenses, among them
a need to maintain a ready supply of
skilled workers, elaborate facilities
for research and development and a
small, highly-trained 'technological
elite' to operate these facilities.
"Naturally, the corporations were
eager to see al 1 three expenses borne by
California's taxpayers, a goal which
was in effect adopted as public policy
in 1955, when . . . the Restudy of the
Needs of Public Higher Education in
California (was released)."
The Coordinating Council on which

Christopher served was a watchdog
agency designed to see that this care
fully planned program was carried
into effect.
Christopher provided help and ad
vice to Stanford decision-makers for
some time before his formal appoint
ment to the Board of Trustees. On such
vital matters as raising capital for the
Law School or offering recommenda
tions for the future during the inter
regnum between President Pitzer's
abdication and President Lyman's
coronation, Christopher had been of
indispensable assistance. Well before
the formal office and title of trustee
was bestowed upon him, Christopher
was counted among the highly valued
friends of Stanford.
The most outstanding example of
the trust placed in Christopher was the
trustees' decision to retain him as spe
cial counsel to handle the disposal of
the Stanford Research Institute (SRI).
SRI was a "contract laboratory"
owned by Stanford. In 1969, an an
tiwar group called the April 3 Move
ment issued a booklet describing SRI:
"The Stanford Research Institute is
an important source of research for
local electronics and aerospace firms.
Founded in 1946 to serve Pacific coast
industry, SRI has grown and moved
into defense contracting along with
the others. ... In 1968, $29.7 million,

or 46.7 per cent of SRl's work was out
of the Defense Department. $6.2 mill
ion is seen as directly related to South
east Asia, and $404,000 was directly
related to Chemical-Biological War
fare."
The April 3 Movement was a mass
movement which had as its goal not
the severance of ties between the uni
versity and SRI, but rather the ending
of war-related work by SRI and tighter
control over research done at SRI.
In early 1970, Christopher with the
assistance of Don Miller, who was also
from O'Melveny & Myers, presented
the trustees with the options on the
university's relationship with SRI. A
plan keeping SRI a non-profit corpora
tion, severing SRI from Stanford and
having SRI buy itself from the univer
sity was recommended by Christopher
and adopted by the Board of Trustees.
Christopher told a group of student
and faculty leaders on the day that the
decision was announced that he had
taken it "as a given" that there could be
no restrictions on research policy
when SRI was severed.
Warren Christopher is a man of
power and influence whose abilities
will be welcomed by the Board of Trus
tees.

Christopher was president of the
California Coordinating Committee for
Higher Education from 1963 to 1965.
Once again, it was a case of Brown
appointing his own political adviser.
The coordinating council was a
body which had been set up by the
Master Plan Survey Team. Its purpose
was to implement and supervise the
operation of a new program for higher
education in California.
William Barlow and Peter Shapiro
describe the origins of the new prog
ram in their book. An End to Silence:
"The corporate elite had begun to
take an intense interest of its own in
the plight of higher education in the
state in the early 19505. The pheno
menal industrial growth (largely cen
tered around aerospace, electronics
and other defense-related industries)
had created for private enterprise some
exorbitant new expenses, among them
a need to maintain a ready supply of
skilled workers, elaborate facilities
for research and development and a
small, highly-trained 'technological
elite' to operate these facilities.
"Naturally, the corporations were
eager to see al 1 three expenses borne by
California's taxpayers, a goal which
was in effect adopted as public policy
in 1955, when . . . the Restudy of the
Needs of Public Higher Education in
California (was released)."
The Coordinating Council on which

Christopher served was a watchdog
agency designed to see that this care
fully planned program was carried
into effect.
Christopher provided help and ad
vice to Stanford decision-makers for
some time before his formal appoint
ment to the Board of Trustees. On such
vital matters as raising capital for the
Law School or offering recommenda
tions for the future during the inter
regnum between President Pitzer's
abdication and President Lyman's
coronation, Christopher had been of
indispensable assistance. Well before
the formal office and title of trustee
was bestowed upon him, Christopher
was counted among the highly valued
friends of Stanford.
The most outstanding example of
the trust placed in Christopher was the
trustees' decision to retain him as spe
cial counsel to handle the disposal of
the Stanford Research Institute (SRI).
SRI was a "contract laboratory"
owned by Stanford. In 1969, an an
tiwar group called the April 3 Move
ment issued a booklet describing SRI:
"The Stanford Research Institute is
an important source of research for
local electronics and aerospace firms.
Founded in 1946 to serve Pacific coast
industry, SRI has grown and moved
into defense contracting along with
the others. ... In 1968, $29.7 million,

or 46.7 per cent of SRl's work was out
of the Defense Department. $6.2 mill
ion is seen as directly related to South
east Asia, and $404,000 was directly
related to Chemical-Biological War
fare."
The April 3 Movement was a mass
movement which had as its goal not
the severance of ties between the uni
versity and SRI, but rather the ending
of war-related work by SRI and tighter
control over research done at SRI.
In early 1970, Christopher with the
assistance of Don Miller, who was also
from O'Melveny & Myers, presented
the trustees with the options on the
university's relationship with SRI. A
plan keeping SRI a non-profit corpora
tion, severing SRI from Stanford and
having SRI buy itself from the univer
sity was recommended by Christopher
and adopted by the Board of Trustees.
Christopher told a group of student
and faculty leaders on the day that the
decision was announced that he had
taken it "as a given" that there could be
no restrictions on research policy
when SRI was severed.
Warren Christopher is a man of
power and influence whose abilities

(Editor's note: Bill Evers wrote the fol
lowing column in (wo parts in the Oct.
19 and 20, 1972 Daily. Trustee Warren
Christopher was designated last week
as deputy secretary of state in the Car

background is again a relevant issue.)
Who is Warren Christopher? Ac
cording to the Oct. 10 (1972) Daily, he
is a new trustee of Stanford University.
His selection was announced on July
17.
There are many facets to the career of
Warren Christopher. Within the short
compass of this column, I will concen
trate on just three of them: 1) Christ
opher's association with the law firm
of O'Melveny & Myers; 2) his experi
ence and expertise in the 1 control of
urban unrest; and 3) his relationship to
higher education.
In September 1970, Scanlon's
Monthly ran an article by Warren
Hinckle entitled, "The Law Firm That
Runs California." It was about O'Mel
veny & Myers, the firm which Christ
opher has practiced law with since
1950. He has been a partner since 1958.
Interestingly enough, the next trus
tee to be named to the board after
Christopher was Robert Woolsey, who
worked for O'Melveny & Myers before
becoming general counsel to the U.S.
Senate Armed Services Committee.
While the fact that this firm has just
had two lawyers put on the board gives
one some idea of the O'Melveny &
Myers influence in the state, the full
extent of that influence, as described
by Scanlon's, is almost unbelievable:
'This firm has already been instru
mental in electing both of California's
incumbant senators and its last two
governors. It is now in a can't-lose pos

ition with its partners or principals di
rectly running three — and directly or
indirectly helping finance all four — of
the 1970 campaigns of both the Repub
lican and Democratic nominees for
senator and governor.
"The firm handles a surfeit of
California's financial business
through its dominant position in the
preparation of state, county and
municipal bond issues. The same firm
has as corporate clients a majority of
the giant enterprises who in the aggre
gate literally own California — from

oil and aerospace combines to the re
alty trusts."
After detailing the origins of the firm
and its political connections, Hinckle
writes that although people through
out the firm — from John O'Melveny
on down — help with maintaining the
firm's political ties, "there can be only
one Cardinal Richelieu, and at O'Mel
veny & Myers the man who carries the
Holy Ghost within him is Warren
Christopher."
Hinckle contends that "Christopher
must be given the credit or blame for
guiding the firm into the uncommon
role as surrogate for electoral politics
in California."
Hinckle's argument is that politics
in anomalous California is not or
ganized so extensively into ethnic, re
ligious and other interest groups as it
is elsewhere in the United States.
Therefore, an opportunity existed for
Warren Christopher and his O'Mel
veny & Myers team of lawyers to wrest
control of the state-level command
posts of the GOP and the Democratic
party over the course of 10 years of
hard work.
Of fundamental importance in
Christopher's strategy,-according to
Hinckle, was involving the firm in
Democratic party politics — thereby
putting the firm on both sides of the
fence. "Since it already had the Repub
licans, the important corporations and
through its bond busi ness the cities, all
it needed was Democrats and it had the
state for all practical purposes."
In the concluding section of the arti
cle, Hinckle shows that there is what
he considers to be convincing evi
dence that Christopher was the mas
termind behind two famous "smears"

in California politics. The first was Pat
Brown's attempt to make San Fran
cisco Mayor George Christopher ap
pear to be a criminal. The second was
John Tunney's attempt to make Rep.
George Brown appear to be anti-Israel
and in favor of terrorism in the United
States.
In 1965, Pat Brown appointed his
adviser Warren Christopher to the
gubernatorial commission to study the
Watts riots and gave Christopher the
post of vice-chairman on the commis
sion. The chairman was John McCone,
former head of the Central Intelligence
Agency.
In July 1967, Christopher, then an
LBJ appointee to the Justice Depart
ment's number two spot (deputy attor
ney general of the United States), was
on the scene in Detroit during the un
rest in that city. Because he was ex
perienced and fairly knowledgeable
on that subject, Christopher was
Johnson's principal civilian adviser on
such urbaqu^Jisorders.
In addithoh to "his direct work on
containing urban unrest, as Ramsey
Clark's aide and right hand man, Chris

trate on just three of them: 1) Christ
opher's association with the law firm
of O'Melveny & Myers; 2) his experi
ence and expertise in the 1 control of
urban unrest; and 3) his relationship to
higher education.
In September 1970, Scanlon's
Monthly ran an article by Warren
Hinckle entitled, "The Law Firm That
Runs California." It was about O'Mel
veny & Myers, the firm which Christ
opher has practiced law with since
1950. He has been a partner since 1958.
Interestingly enough, the next trus
tee to be named to the board after
Christopher was Robert Woolsey, who
worked for O'Melveny & Myers before
becoming general counsel to the U.S.
Senate Armed Services Committee.
While the fact that this firm has just
had two lawyers put on the board gives
one some idea of the O'Melveny &
Myers influence in the state, the full
extent of that influence, as described
by Scanlon's, is almost unbelievable:
'This firm has already been instru
mental in electing both of California's
incumbant senators and its last two
governors. It is now in a can't-lose pos

ition with its partners or principals di
rectly running three — and directly or
indirectly helping finance all four — of
the 1970 campaigns of both the Repub
lican and Democratic nominees for
senator and governor.
"The firm handles a surfeit of
California's financial business
through its dominant position in the
preparation of state, county and
municipal bond issues. The same firm
has as corporate clients a majority of
the giant enterprises who in the aggre
gate literally own California — from

oil and aerospace combines to the re
alty trusts."
After detailing the origins of the firm
and its political connections, Hinckle
writes that although people through
out the firm — from John O'Melveny
on down — help with maintaining the
firm's political ties, "there can be only
one Cardinal Richelieu, and at O'Mel
veny & Myers the man who carries the
Holy Ghost within him is Warren
Christopher."
Hinckle contends that "Christopher
must be given the credit or blame for
guiding the firm into the uncommon
role as surrogate for electoral politics
in California."
Hinckle's argument is that politics
in anomalous California is not or
ganized so extensively into ethnic, re
ligious and other interest groups as it
is elsewhere in the United States.
Therefore, an opportunity existed for
Warren Christopher and his O'Mel
veny & Myers team of lawyers to wrest
control of the state-level command
posts of the GOP and the Democratic
party over the course of 10 years of
hard work.
Of fundamental importance in
Christopher's strategy,-according to
Hinckle, was involving the firm in
Democratic party politics — thereby
putting the firm on both sides of the
fence. "Since it already had the Repub
licans, the important corporations and
through its bond busi ness the cities, all
it needed was Democrats and it had the
state for all practical purposes."
In the concluding section of the arti
cle, Hinckle shows that there is what
he considers to be convincing evi
dence that Christopher was the mas
termind behind two famous "smears"

in California politics. The first was Pat
Brown's attempt to make San Fran
cisco Mayor George Christopher ap
pear to be a criminal. The second was
John Tunney's attempt to make Rep.
George Brown appear to be anti-Israel
and in favor of terrorism in the United
States.
In 1965, Pat Brown appointed his
adviser Warren Christopher to the
gubernatorial commission to study the
Watts riots and gave Christopher the
post of vice-chairman on the commis
sion. The chairman was John McCone,
former head of the Central Intelligence
Agency.
In July 1967, Christopher, then an
LBJ appointee to the Justice Depart
ment's number two spot (deputy attor
ney general of the United States), was
on the scene in Detroit during the un
rest in that city. Because he was ex
perienced and fairly knowledgeable
on that subject, Christopher was
Johnson's principal civilian adviser on
such urbaqu^Jisorders.
In addithoh to "his direct work on
containing urban unrest, as Ramsey
Clark's aide and right hand man, Chris
topher handled the Justice Depart
ment's legislative program which
dealt with siirih matters as increasing
government fcontrol of/firearms in the
hands of citizens.
Christopher was president of the
California Coordinating Committee for
Higher Education from 1963 to 1965.
Once again, it was a case of Brown
appointing his own political adviser.
The coordinating council was a
body which had been set up by the
Master Plan Survey Team. Its purpose
was to implement and supervise the
operation of a new program for higher
education in California.
William Barlow and Peter Shapiro
describe the origins of the new prog
ram in their book. An End to Silence:
"The corporate elite had begun to
take an intense interest of its own in
the plight of higher education in the
state in the early 19505. The pheno
menal industrial growth (largely cen
tered around aerospace, electronics
and other defense-related industries)
had created for private enterprise some
exorbitant new expenses, among them
a need to maintain a ready supply of
skilled workers, elaborate facilities
for research and development and a
small, highly-trained 'technological
elite' to operate these facilities.
"Naturally, the corporations were
eager to see al 1 three expenses borne by
California's taxpayers, a goal which
was in effect adopted as public policy
in 1955, when . . . the Restudy of the
Needs of Public Higher Education in
California (was released)."
The Coordinating Council on which

Christopher served was a watchdog
agency designed to see that this care
fully planned program was carried
into effect.
Christopher provided help and ad
vice to Stanford decision-makers for
some time before his formal appoint
ment to the Board of Trustees. On such
vital matters as raising capital for the
Law School or offering recommenda
tions for the future during the inter
regnum between President Pitzer's
abdication and President Lyman's
coronation, Christopher had been of
indispensable assistance. Well before
the formal office and title of trustee
was bestowed upon him, Christopher
was counted among the highly valued
friends of Stanford.
The most outstanding example of
the trust placed in Christopher was the
trustees' decision to retain him as spe
cial counsel to handle the disposal of
the Stanford Research Institute (SRI).
SRI was a "contract laboratory"
owned by Stanford. In 1969, an an
tiwar group called the April 3 Move
ment issued a booklet describing SRI:
"The Stanford Research Institute is
an important source of research for
local electronics and aerospace firms.
Founded in 1946 to serve Pacific coast
industry, SRI has grown and moved
into defense contracting along with
the others. ... In 1968, $29.7 million,

or 46.7 per cent of SRl's work was out
of the Defense Department. $6.2 mill
ion is seen as directly related to South
east Asia, and $404,000 was directly
related to Chemical-Biological War
fare."
The April 3 Movement was a mass
movement which had as its goal not
the severance of ties between the uni
versity and SRI, but rather the ending
of war-related work by SRI and tighter
control over research done at SRI.
In early 1970, Christopher with the
assistance of Don Miller, who was also
from O'Melveny & Myers, presented
the trustees with the options on the
university's relationship with SRI. A
plan keeping SRI a non-profit corpora
tion, severing SRI from Stanford and
having SRI buy itself from the univer
sity was recommended by Christopher
and adopted by the Board of Trustees.
Christopher told a group of student
and faculty leaders on the day that the
decision was announced that he had
taken it "as a given" that there could be
no restrictions on research policy
when SRI was severed.
Warren Christopher is a man of
power and influence whose abilities
will be welcomed by the Board of Trus
tees.

was to implement and supervise the
operation of a new program for higher
education in California.
William Barlow and Peter Shapiro
describe the origins of the new prog
ram in their book. An End to Silence:
"The corporate elite had begun to
take an intense interest of its own in
the plight of higher education in the
state in the early 19505. The pheno
menal industrial growth (largely cen
tered around aerospace, electronics
and other defense-related industries)
had created for private enterprise some
exorbitant new expenses, among them
a need to maintain a ready supply of
skilled workers, elaborate facilities
for research and development and a
small, highly-trained 'technological
elite' to operate these facilities.
"Naturally, the corporations were
eager to see al 1 three expenses borne by
California's taxpayers, a goal which
was in effect adopted as public policy
in 1955, when . . . the Restudy of the
Needs of Public Higher Education in
California (was released)."
The Coordinating Council on which

Christopher served was a watchdog
agency designed to see that this care
fully planned program was carried
into effect.
Christopher provided help and ad
vice to Stanford decision-makers for
some time before his formal appoint
ment to the Board of Trustees. On such
vital matters as raising capital for the
Law School or offering recommenda
tions for the future during the inter
regnum between President Pitzer's
abdication and President Lyman's
coronation, Christopher had been of
indispensable assistance. Well before
the formal office and title of trustee
was bestowed upon him, Christopher
was counted among the highly valued
friends of Stanford.
The most outstanding example of
the trust placed in Christopher was the
trustees' decision to retain him as spe
cial counsel to handle the disposal of
the Stanford Research Institute (SRI).
SRI was a "contract laboratory"
owned by Stanford. In 1969, an an
tiwar group called the April 3 Move
ment issued a booklet describing SRI:
"The Stanford Research Institute is
an important source of research for
local electronics and aerospace firms.
Founded in 1946 to serve Pacific coast
industry, SRI has grown and moved
into defense contracting along with
the others. ... In 1968, $29.7 million,

or 46.7 per cent of SRl's work was out
of the Defense Department. $6.2 mill
ion is seen as directly related to South
east Asia, and $404,000 was directly
related to Chemical-Biological War
fare."
The April 3 Movement was a mass
movement which had as its goal not
the severance of ties between the uni
versity and SRI, but rather the ending
of war-related work by SRI and tighter
control over research done at SRI.
In early 1970, Christopher with the
assistance of Don Miller, who was also
from O'Melveny & Myers, presented
the trustees with the options on the
university's relationship with SRI. A
plan keeping SRI a non-profit corpora
tion, severing SRI from Stanford and
having SRI buy itself from the univer
sity was recommended by Christopher
and adopted by the Board of Trustees.
Christopher told a group of student
and faculty leaders on the day that the
decision was announced that he had
taken it "as a given" that there could be
no restrictions on research policy
when SRI was severed.
Warren Christopher is a man of
power and influence whose abilities

(Editor's note: Bill Evers wrote the fol
lowing column in (wo parts in the Oct.
19 and 20, 1972 Daily. Trustee Warren
Christopher was designated last week
as deputy secretary of state in the Car
ter Administration, and his
background is again a relevant issue.)
Who is Warren Christopher? Ac
cording to the Oct. 10 (1972) Daily, he
is a new trustee of Stanford University.
His selection was announced on July
17.
There are many facets to the career of
Warren Christopher. Within the short
compass of this column, I will concen
trate on just three of them: 1) Christ
opher's association with the law firm
of O'Melveny & Myers; 2) his experi
ence and expertise in the 1 control of
urban unrest; and 3) his relationship to
higher education.
In September 1970, Scanlon's
Monthly ran an article by Warren
Hinckle entitled, "The Law Firm That
Runs California." It was about O'Mel
veny & Myers, the firm which Christ
opher has practiced law with since
1950. He has been a partner since 1958.
Interestingly enough, the next trus
tee to be named to the board after
Christopher was Robert Woolsey, who
worked for O'Melveny & Myers before
becoming general counsel to the U.S.
Senate Armed Services Committee.
While the fact that this firm has just
had two lawyers put on the board gives
one some idea of the O'Melveny &
Myers influence in the state, the full
extent of that influence, as described
by Scanlon's, is almost unbelievable:
'This firm has already been instru
mental in electing both of California's
incumbant senators and its last two
governors. It is now in a can't-lose pos

ition with its partners or principals di
rectly running three — and directly or
indirectly helping finance all four — of
the 1970 campaigns of both the Repub
lican and Democratic nominees for
senator and governor.
"The firm handles a surfeit of
California's financial business
through its dominant position in the
preparation of state, county and
municipal bond issues. The same firm
has as corporate clients a majority of
the giant enterprises who in the aggre
gate literally own California — from

oil and aerospace combines to the re
alty trusts."
After detailing the origins of the firm
and its political connections, Hinckle
writes that although people through
out the firm — from John O'Melveny
on down — help with maintaining the
firm's political ties, "there can be only
one Cardinal Richelieu, and at O'Mel
veny & Myers the man who carries the
Holy Ghost within him is Warren
Christopher."
Hinckle contends that "Christopher
must be given the credit or blame for
guiding the firm into the uncommon
role as surrogate for electoral politics
in California."
Hinckle's argument is that politics
in anomalous California is not or
ganized so extensively into ethnic, re
ligious and other interest groups as it
is elsewhere in the United States.
Therefore, an opportunity existed for
Warren Christopher and his O'Mel
veny & Myers team of lawyers to wrest
control of the state-level command
posts of the GOP and the Democratic
party over the course of 10 years of
hard work.
Of fundamental importance in
Christopher's strategy,-according to
Hinckle, was involving the firm in
Democratic party politics — thereby
putting the firm on both sides of the
fence. "Since it already had the Repub
licans, the important corporations and
through its bond busi ness the cities, all
it needed was Democrats and it had the
state for all practical purposes."
In the concluding section of the arti
cle, Hinckle shows that there is what
he considers to be convincing evi
dence that Christopher was the mas
termind behind two famous "smears"

in California politics. The first was Pat
Brown's attempt to make San Fran
cisco Mayor George Christopher ap
pear to be a criminal. The second was
John Tunney's attempt to make Rep.
George Brown appear to be anti-Israel
and in favor of terrorism in the United
States.
In 1965, Pat Brown appointed his
adviser Warren Christopher to the
gubernatorial commission to study the
Watts riots and gave Christopher the
post of vice-chairman on the commis
sion. The chairman was John McCone,
former head of the Central Intelligence
Agency.
In July 1967, Christopher, then an
LBJ appointee to the Justice Depart
ment's number two spot (deputy attor
ney general of the United States), was
on the scene in Detroit during the un
rest in that city. Because he was ex
perienced and fairly knowledgeable
on that subject, Christopher was
Johnson's principal civilian adviser on
such urbaqu^Jisorders.
In addithoh to "his direct work on
containing urban unrest, as Ramsey
Clark's aide and right hand man, Chris
topher handled the Justice Depart
ment's legislative program which
dealt with siirih matters as increasing
government fcontrol of/firearms in the
hands of citizens.
Christopher was president of the
California Coordinating Committee for
Higher Education from 1963 to 1965.
Once again, it was a case of Brown
appointing his own political adviser.
