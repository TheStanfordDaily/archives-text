## Train flick suffers from strain 
### Howard Baldwin 
Dispensing with the confines
of chronological order, I cite one
of the last scenes of Silver Streak
as the most representative of the
film as a whole. The train on
which Gene Wilder, Jill
Clayburgh, Richard Pryor and
Scatman Crothers are trapped is
hurtling out of control toward
Union Station in Chicago.
Wilder attempts to unhitch the
passenger cars from the engines.
His character, George Caldwell,
stretches and strains, trying to

get a foothold between two pas
senger cars. How representative
of the entire movie, as Wilder
and director Arthur Hiller strain
for laughs, exerting themselves
mightily, and only barely suc
ceeding.
With none of the comic frenzy
Wilder projects in his own films
(Young Frankenstein, The Ad
venture of Sherlock Holmes'
Smarter Brother), he acciden
tally becomes involved in mur
der and intrigue aboard the
Silver Streak from Los Angeles

to Chicago. Unfortunately, his
attempts to solve the murder —
the knowledge of which only he
has — are hindered by his com
plete adeptness for being inter
mittently divested of the train,
not once, not twice, but three
times. Rib-tickling, no?
Derailed
No. Traveling on the trail of
North By Northwest, Silver
Streak gets derailed by none
other than its own director. Even
though their initials are the
same, Arthur Hiller (Love Story,

W.C. Fields and Me) is no Alfred
Hitchcock. Whereas the latter's
absurdities flow so smoothly as
to be unnoticeable, all of Hiller's
transitional devices are only
noteworthy in that they continu
ally call attention to themselves.
That Hiller isn't Hitchcock is
forgiveable. Neither is he an ac
tion director. SiJver Streak be
gins at a snail's pace, accom
panied by a romantic Henry
f&ancini score that spells im
pending doom c-a-l-m. The
motivation behind this less
than-subtle start is to make the
film seem like an avalanche, to
bowl the audience over as it
picks up speed. Unfortunately
again, the film never picks up as
much speed as the train. Even
the final crash at Union Station,
filmed without miniatures,
seems inserted for its own sake.
Internal struggle
Another identity problem
Silver Streak has is its internal
struggle between comedy and
thriller. Comedy it is (although
occasionally rather juvenile) and
thriller it is (with disguises and
double-crosses and murder), but
why does the villain Devereau
(Patrick McGoohan, slithering
his way through art forgeries)
have to be so bloodthirsty? His
egocentrism gets its just reward
when his head is lopped off (not
shown, thank you very much) by
a passing train, but his needless
gunning down of everyone from
engineers to his own ac
complices becomes quite de
pressing very quickly.
Nor does the rest of the cast
fare much better. George's
romantic interest is Jill
Clayburgh, the only actress to
have her career skyrocket thanks
to a bomb (Gable and Lombard).
Neither Ray Walston nor Ned
Beatty nor Clifton James are in
the film long enough to provide
any relief. They're either killed
off or left behind with startling
rapidity.
Richard Pryor, however, as
Grover Muldoon, steals the show
as a convict George, accused of
murder, meets up with trying to
elude the police. The only thing
wrong with Pryor is that laugh
ter covers most of his lines. Mul
doon seems to be the only one
who seems vaguely comfortable
no matter what his cir
cumstances. Pryor is alpjQsl
worth the price of admission
himself.
Silver Streak is a slick mixture
of murder and mayhem if you
don't look too closely at its
shortcomings. As a matter of
fact, it might help to take a tele
scope.

the Old Mill in Mt. View.)

Internal struggle
Another identity problem
Silver Streak has is its internal
struggle between comedy and
thriller. Comedy it is (although
occasionally rather juvenile) and
thriller it is (with disguises and
double-crosses and murder), but
why does the villain Devereau
(Patrick McGoohan, slithering
his way through art forgeries)
have to be so bloodthirsty? His
egocentrism gets its just reward
when his head is lopped off (not
shown, thank you very much) by
a passing train, but his needless
gunning down of everyone from
engineers to his own ac
complices becomes quite de
pressing very quickly.
Nor does the rest of the cast
fare much better. George's
romantic interest is Jill
Clayburgh, the only actress to
have her career skyrocket thanks
to a bomb (Gable and Lombard).
Neither Ray Walston nor Ned
Beatty nor Clifton James are in
the film long enough to provide
any relief. They're either killed
off or left behind with startling
rapidity.
Richard Pryor, however, as
Grover Muldoon, steals the show
as a convict George, accused of
murder, meets up with trying to
elude the police. The only thing
wrong with Pryor is that laugh
ter covers most of his lines. Mul
doon seems to be the only one
who seems vaguely comfortable
no matter what his cir
cumstances. Pryor is alpjQsl
worth the price of admission
himself.
Silver Streak is a slick mixture
of murder and mayhem if you
don't look too closely at its
shortcomings. As a matter of
fact, it might help to take a tele
scope.

the Old Mill in Mt. View.)


I got rhythm
In order to elude the police, Grover Muldoon
(Richard Pryor) gives George Caldwell (Gene

—photo courtesy 20th Century-Fox
Wilder) a can of shoe polish and lessons on
how to behave like a black in 20th Century-
Fox's new film, Silver Streak.
Dispensing with the confines
of chronological order, I cite one
of the last scenes of Silver Streak
as the most representative of the
film as a whole. The train on
which Gene Wilder, Jill
Clayburgh, Richard Pryor and
Scatman Crothers are trapped is
hurtling out of control toward
Union Station in Chicago.
Wilder attempts to unhitch the
passenger cars from the engines.
His character, George Caldwell,
stretches and strains, trying to

get a foothold between two pas
senger cars. How representative
of the entire movie, as Wilder
and director Arthur Hiller strain
for laughs, exerting themselves
mightily, and only barely suc
ceeding.
With none of the comic frenzy
Wilder projects in his own films
(Young Frankenstein, The Ad
venture of Sherlock Holmes'
Smarter Brother), he acciden
tally becomes involved in mur
der and intrigue aboard the
Silver Streak from Los Angeles

to Chicago. Unfortunately, his
attempts to solve the murder —
the knowledge of which only he
has — are hindered by his com
plete adeptness for being inter
mittently divested of the train,
not once, not twice, but three
times. Rib-tickling, no?
Derailed
No. Traveling on the trail of
North By Northwest, Silver
Streak gets derailed by none
other than its own director. Even
though their initials are the
same, Arthur Hiller (Love Story,

W.C. Fields and Me) is no Alfred
Hitchcock. Whereas the latter's
absurdities flow so smoothly as
to be unnoticeable, all of Hiller's
transitional devices are only
noteworthy in that they continu
ally call attention to themselves.
That Hiller isn't Hitchcock is
forgiveable. Neither is he an ac
tion director. SiJver Streak be
gins at a snail's pace, accom
panied by a romantic Henry
f&ancini score that spells im
pending doom c-a-l-m. The
motivation behind this less
than-subtle start is to make the
