### 
Looking for something to warm up those cold
winter quarter nights? Need an extracurricular
activity to add to your transcript to impress medl
law/business schools? Want to join other students
to put together something you'll enjoy and be
proud of? If so, then Ram's Head is for you.
Ram's Head is a totally student-run, indepen
dent theatrical group. Following its highly
acclaimed production of Guys and Dolls last
spring, Ram's Head now announced auditions for
its April 20-23 presentation of the musical, Fid
dler on the Roof.
Auditions are scheduled for Sunday, January 9,
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the main stage of Memo
rial Auditorium and on Monday, January 10, from
7 to 10 p.m. in room 125 of the Drama Department,
located in the back of the Auditorium.
All Stanford grad and undergrad students are
eligible to audition for the show, which will have

a cast of over 50 singers, actors, dancers and gym
nasts. "Ram's Head is, among other things, a
learning experience," states Doug Bedard, the
group's producer. "No theatrical experience is
necessary."
Fiddler, to be presented in Memorial Au
ditorium, will be directed by Paul Edwards, an
R.A. in Roble Hall. Edwards will be working with
musical director Sam Spigelman, who will con
duct the 30-piece student orchestra. Ann Mal
mouth, a senior in the Dance Department, will act
as choreographer.
Simon Sanchez will assist Edwards, and Andy
Paul will serve as associate producer. Micahel
Ellis is technical director and Marilyn Driver is
costumer.
Many people are needed for technical crews as
well.
