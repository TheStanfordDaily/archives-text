# Concert ends brilliantly
## 
### Michele Hannoosh 
The San Francisco Sym
phony's second concert of the
season began as though the
musicians were already tired of
their grueling schedule. Fortu
nately for the audience, it im
proved markedly as the program
progressed and, in fact, ended
with a brilliant performance of
the final piece.
The opening work was a
Mozart symphony (no. 3 in C,
K. 388) which, although lively,
lacked the spark that would have
made it vivid. The violins were
very good — delicate and clear
in sound and consistently in un
ison, but the piece on the whole

was ratherbland and unexciting.
The remaining two selections
were well done. A Hindemith
concerto for organ and chamber
orchestra (Op. 46, no. 2) was very
good, as the musicians achieved
appropriate expression, good
contrasts, and clear tones.
In the last piece, the San Fran
cisco Symphony Chorus joined
the orchestra for a performance
of William Walton's "Belshaz
zar's Feast," which was by far
the high point of the program. It
was obvious that conductor Seiji
Ozawa exerted a tremendous
amount of effort and energy in
order to bring out the diversities
of the piece. It was further

heightened by an excellent
baritone soloist who gave a
strong, even rendition of a de
manding part. The chorus and
orchestra were in perfect timing
and responded well to Ozawa's
directing. In all, this made for a
dramatic number, and it re
ceived a solid standing ovation
at its end.
A final reminder: if you have
purchased student tickets, be
certain to take your ID. After
witnessing a rather unpleasant
exchange between the ticket col
lector and a student who had
forgotten his identification, I can
testify that the student did not
win out.
