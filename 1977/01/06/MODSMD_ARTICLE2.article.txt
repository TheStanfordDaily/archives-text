Oakland (AP) — Wendy Yoshimura
was cited on contempt of court charges
five times at her weapons possession
trial yesterday when she refused to
answer questions about her 3V2 years
as fugitive with Partricia Hearst and
others in the radical underground.
Yoshimura took the witness stand in
her own defense and denied charges
that she illegally possessed weapons
and bomb making material found in a
Berkeley garage on March 31, 1972.
After the cache was discovered,
Yoshimura went underground and
was arrested in September 1975 with
her fugitive roommate.
Yoshimura, 33, read to the jury a
dramatic statement in which she said
she would refuse to testify about any
thing after she fled in April 1972 to
avoid prosecution.
Prosecutor Jeff Horner began his
cross-examination by asking the de
fendant to identify the person who
telephoned heron March 31,1972 and
told her that her boyfriend, William
Brandt, had been arrested at a Berkeley
garage rented several months earlier
by Yoshimura. Police found a cache of
illegal weapons and bomb-making de
vices in the garage.
'Can't answer'
Yoshimura referred Horner to her
statement and said, "I just can't answer
that.
"I cannot talk about anything — any
people, any places, or any cir
cumstances—after I fled in 1972," she
said.
"It is impossible to explain my life
after 1972 without suggesting or pro
viding information about the people
and friends who have helped me dur
ing these years. I want you to under
stand that I hold very strong moral
principles that prevent me from doing
this," she said haltingly.
'Dear friends'
"Many people helped me, some of
whom I consider are my very dear
friends, and I am morally obligated to
bring them no harm in any way possi
ble." she continued.
"I admit that I fled out of fear of
prosecution ... I admit that I as
sociated with other fugitives after
1972."
I lie defendant said she had given a
great deal of thought to her refusal to
answer and then asked to read the
single page statement.
After some legal wranfllina with

Alameda County Superior Court Judge
Martin Fulich, she was allowed to read
the bombshell statement.
Yoshimura, later responding to
questions from Larson, said she fled
because "I was scared. I felt boxed in."
She said that she feared police would
not believe her innocence because of
"the government's racist attitude to
ward Asian people."
"She has no legal right to refuse to
answer," said the judge. "I do not rec
ognize that certain moral principles be
greater than the law. She chose to take
the stand. She had a constitutional
right not to do so."
