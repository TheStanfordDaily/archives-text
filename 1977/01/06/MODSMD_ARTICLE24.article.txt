Rabin faces suicide scandal
Tel Aviv — Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
faced with a scandal before upcoming elections,
said yesterday that Housing Minister Avraham
Ofer, who committed suicide three days ago,
was innocent of accepting kickbacks.
Ofer shot himself after press reports linked his
name to alleged real estate deals.
Rabin, in a eulogy at the 54-year-old Polish
immigrant's funeral, called the reports "libels. 1 '
"Will this serve to shock, to teach how careful
people must be in their speech and in the press
to honor a man and his innocence, and not to
judge without trial?" Rabin said.
Ofer committed suicide Monday night in his
car near his Tel Aviv home, leaving a note in
which he protested his innocence and asked:
"Why did they persecute me all the time?"
Despite Rabin's strong defense of Ofer, the
burgeoning scandal involving Ofer's name and
other stalwards of the ruling Labor party could
hurt the prime minister in May elections, politi
cal analysts said.
The Israeli parliament voted to dissolve itself
and hold national elections May 17, five months
ahead of schedule. The vote followed Rabin's
resignation two weeks ago. Rabin will continue
as a caretaker prime minister until the voting.
Ford backs Texan for party head
Washington — President Gerald Ford decided
yesterday that he wants Texas lawyer James
Baker 111 to be the new chairman of the Republi
can Party, a White House source said.
The source said Ford made his preference
known in a telephone conversation with outgo
ing Chairman Mary Louise Smith. Ford talked
with Smith after a luncheon with other senior
party leaders at the White House failed to come
up with a consensus candidate.
In a telephone call to Smith, Ford emphasized
it is "the Republican National Committee's
(RNC) responsibility to pick a new chairman and
that he will support whoever the RNC picks,"
the source said.
However, the source said Ford told Smith that
Baker, Ford's campaign manager, was his
choice.
Smith was in Philadelphia for a speaking en
gagement and could not be reached for com
ment.
Ford's decision to back a candidate for party
chairman came after he hosted a luncheon for
Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, former
California Gov. Ronald Reagan and former
Treasury Secretary John Connally.
But unlike a similar meeting last month, this
one broke up without any formal announcement
or briefing from the participants. Only Reagan

made a few remarks to reporters who caught him
at a White House gate.
Reagan said the four decided to leave the
selection of a new party chairman up to the Re
publican National Committee and did not try to
come up with a consensus candidate.
School finance proposal endorsed
Sacramento — Assembly Speaker Leo McCar
thy cautiously endorsed Gov. Edmund Brown
Jr.'s $3.3-billion school finance proposal yester
day and said he believes the five-year plan can
be financed without a tax increase.
McCarthy, a Democrat whose home city of San
Francisco would get little or nothing from the
Brown proposal, told a news conference after 24
hours silence on the plan that he endorses "the
general essence of the program.
"I am convinced the plan submitted to legis
lators Tuesday is a serious, thoughtful and com
prehensive plan. I believe the plan is sufficiently
long-range to meet the future needs of our chil
dren," McCarthy said.
But he refused to endorse specific points, say
ing the plan is too complex to analyze quickly.
The Brown proposal, intended to help
equalize funding between poor and wealthy
school districts, was unveiled Tuesday — a
week after the state Supreme Court ruled that
California's school financing system was un
constitutional because it allowed an imbalance
in spending that resulted in unequal educa
tional opportunity.
Soviet Union harvests record crop
Moscow — The Soviet Union harvested a re
cord grain crop of 223.8 million metric tons in
1976, Agriculture Minister Valentin Mesyats
announced yesterday.
Mesyats, confirming previous hints at a
bumper crop, told a news conference the Soviet
Union plans to boost the average annual harvest
of grain to 235 million tons by 1980.
Despite the good performance, the minister
said, the Soviets will fulfill their commitments
to buy grain abroad. Those commitments in
clude a minimum six-million-ton annual purch
ase from the United States, a minimum that U.S.
officials say has already been surpassed.
The 1976 record figure compares with the
previous record of 222.5 million tons in 1973
and with the disastrous 1975 figure of 140 mill
ion, a 10-year low.
Poor Soviet crops in the past led to raids on the
American market, driving up domestic prices.
As a consequence, the United States persuaded
the Soviets to sign up for the six-million-ton
annual minimum so the market would not be
disturbed. The agreement, signed in 1975, runs

for five years.
After talks with Soviet officials here last
month. Richard Bell, an assistant U.S. agricul
ture secretary, said the Russians had already
purchased 6.6 million tons of American wheat
and corn from the 1976 crop and had no im
mediate plans to buy more.
Soviets refuse to pay Sinai share
United Nations. N.Y. — The Soviet Union has
balked at paying several million dollars of its
pledged share for supporting U.N. peacekeeping
forces in the Middle East because Moscow did
not participate in drawing up the 1975 Sinai
disengagement agreement.
The refusal came in a Soviet letter to IJ.N.
headquarters dealing with a year-old bill of
$16.5 million toward the cost of keeping U.N.
troops in the Golan Heights and the Sinai penin
sula.
The letter, dated Dec. 30 and released Tues
day, contains figures that do not coincide with
those on the IJ.N. books. It left officials here
puzzled as to how much the Russians plan to
withhold — $10 million or $4.5 million.
Both U.N. and American officials said they
were taken by surprise, since the Soviets have
consistently supported renewal of the Mideast
forces and backed the budgets adopted for the
purpose by the General Assembly.
State court won't review death law
San Francisco — The California Supreme
Court refused yesterday to reconsider its Dec. 7
decision holding the state's death penalty law
unconstitutional.
The brief order denied Atty. Gen. Evelle J.
Younger's petition for rehearing.
Deputy Atty. Gen. Howard Schwab of Los
Angeles said the court had been asked to modify
certain language in its decision.
"We felt the language of the opinion was too
broad and seemed to exclude all mandatory
death penalties," he explained.
Schwab noted that the U.S. Supreme Court
last November agreed to hear a case in which the
sole issue was the constitutionality of a mandat
ory death penalty as applied to first degree mur
der of a peace officer.
Judge permits execution filmings
Huntsville, Tex. — U.S. District Court Judge
William Taylor of Dallas recently signed an
order permitting the television filming of execu
tions at the state prison. His action came as a
result of a lawsuit filed by Dallas television
newsman Tony Garrett of the public KERA-TV.

Taylor also ruled that interviews with death
row inmates, halted about a month ago by the
Texas Department of Corrections (TDC), must be
resumed.
W.J. Estelle Jr., director of TDC, said Tuesday
his agency would abide by the court order on
television filming of executions and that inter
views would be permitted on Wednesdays from
9 a.m. to 11 a.m.
Convict Jerry Jurek agreed to meet with repor
ters yesterday, but several others on death row
refused the requests for interviews.
Unless he is granted a stay of execution, Jurek,
25, will be the first person executed in Texas
since 1964.
Soviet pilot tells of Kamikaze plans
Hamburg, West Germany — A Soviet fighter
pilot who defected to the West told his American
interrogators that Russian combat pilots have
orders to make kamikaze-style suicide attacks
rather than bail out in wartime emergencies,
Stern magazine says.
Those who return alive are to be shot, the
pilot, Victor Belenko, reportedly said.
The weekly West German magazine also
quoted Central Intelligence Agency sources as
saying Belenko suffered a nervous collapse dur
ing weeks of intense grilling by the CIA, and it
said he was now living at a secret location on
$1500-a-month support payments.
Belenko flew his top-secret MIG2S jet from
Siberia to Japan's Hakodate airport Sept. 9 and
told the astonished Japanese he wanted political
asylum in the United States.
U.S. experts examined the plane thoroughly
before it was returned to the Soviets, and Be
lenko was taken to the United States.
The Stern article, scheduled for publication
today, contained excerpts from what the
magazine said were CIA interrogation records.
The Russian lieutenant said air defenses in the
eastern Soviet Union are manned by airmen
considered disciplinary problems, Stern re
ported. Belenko himself was assigned to Siberia
for that reason, it said.
"They (the pilots) are like wolves," he was
quoted as saying. "They try to collect laurels
through daring actions against Chinese combat
aircraft and U.S. spy planes in order to get
posted back to the west of the Soviet Union."
The pilots are ordered to pick out enemy
targets for suicide attacks in combat emergen
cies and "whoever returns is shot," he repor
tedly said.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. Lows in the 3()s
to mid 40s with local frost. Highs in the 50s.
Winds mostly northerly 15 to 25 mph.

The Brown proposal, intended to help
equalize funding between poor and wealthy
school districts, was unveiled Tuesday — a

California's school financing system was un
constitutional because it allowed an imbalance
in spending that resulted in unequal educa

Soviet Union harvests record crop
Moscow — The Soviet Union harvested a re
cord grain crop of 223.8 million metric tons in
1976, Agriculture Minister Valentin Mesyats
announced yesterday.
Mesyats, confirming previous hints at a
bumper crop, told a news conference the Soviet
Union plans to boost the average annual harvest
of grain to 235 million tons by 1980.
Despite the good performance, the minister
said, the Soviets will fulfill their commitments
to buy grain abroad. Those commitments in
clude a minimum six-million-ton annual purch
ase from the United States, a minimum that U.S.
officials say has already been surpassed.
The 1976 record figure compares with the
previous record of 222.5 million tons in 1973
and with the disastrous 1975 figure of 140 mill
ion, a 10-year low.
Poor Soviet crops in the past led to raids on the
American market, driving up domestic prices.
As a consequence, the United States persuaded
the Soviets to sign up for the six-million-ton
annual minimum so the market would not be
disturbed. The agreement, signed in 1975, runs

for five years.
After talks with Soviet officials here last
month. Richard Bell, an assistant U.S. agricul
ture secretary, said the Russians had already
purchased 6.6 million tons of American wheat
and corn from the 1976 crop and had no im
mediate plans to buy more.
Soviets refuse to pay Sinai share
United Nations. N.Y. — The Soviet Union has
balked at paying several million dollars of its
pledged share for supporting U.N. peacekeeping
forces in the Middle East because Moscow did
not participate in drawing up the 1975 Sinai
disengagement agreement.
The refusal came in a Soviet letter to IJ.N.
headquarters dealing with a year-old bill of
$16.5 million toward the cost of keeping U.N.
troops in the Golan Heights and the Sinai penin
sula.
The letter, dated Dec. 30 and released Tues
day, contains figures that do not coincide with
those on the IJ.N. books. It left officials here
puzzled as to how much the Russians plan to
withhold — $10 million or $4.5 million.
Both U.N. and American officials said they
were taken by surprise, since the Soviets have
consistently supported renewal of the Mideast
forces and backed the budgets adopted for the
purpose by the General Assembly.
State court won't review death law
San Francisco — The California Supreme
Court refused yesterday to reconsider its Dec. 7
decision holding the state's death penalty law
unconstitutional.
The brief order denied Atty. Gen. Evelle J.
Younger's petition for rehearing.
Deputy Atty. Gen. Howard Schwab of Los
Angeles said the court had been asked to modify
certain language in its decision.
"We felt the language of the opinion was too
broad and seemed to exclude all mandatory
death penalties," he explained.
Schwab noted that the U.S. Supreme Court
last November agreed to hear a case in which the
sole issue was the constitutionality of a mandat
ory death penalty as applied to first degree mur
der of a peace officer.
Judge permits execution filmings
Huntsville, Tex. — U.S. District Court Judge
William Taylor of Dallas recently signed an
order permitting the television filming of execu
tions at the state prison. His action came as a
result of a lawsuit filed by Dallas television
newsman Tony Garrett of the public KERA-TV.

Taylor also ruled that interviews with death
row inmates, halted about a month ago by the
Texas Department of Corrections (TDC), must be
resumed.
W.J. Estelle Jr., director of TDC, said Tuesday
his agency would abide by the court order on
television filming of executions and that inter
views would be permitted on Wednesdays from
9 a.m. to 11 a.m.
Convict Jerry Jurek agreed to meet with repor
ters yesterday, but several others on death row
refused the requests for interviews.
Unless he is granted a stay of execution, Jurek,
25, will be the first person executed in Texas
since 1964.
Soviet pilot tells of Kamikaze plans
Hamburg, West Germany — A Soviet fighter
pilot who defected to the West told his American
interrogators that Russian combat pilots have
orders to make kamikaze-style suicide attacks
rather than bail out in wartime emergencies,
Stern magazine says.
Those who return alive are to be shot, the
pilot, Victor Belenko, reportedly said.
The weekly West German magazine also
quoted Central Intelligence Agency sources as
saying Belenko suffered a nervous collapse dur
ing weeks of intense grilling by the CIA, and it
said he was now living at a secret location on
$1500-a-month support payments.
Belenko flew his top-secret MIG2S jet from
Siberia to Japan's Hakodate airport Sept. 9 and
told the astonished Japanese he wanted political
asylum in the United States.
U.S. experts examined the plane thoroughly
before it was returned to the Soviets, and Be
lenko was taken to the United States.
The Stern article, scheduled for publication
today, contained excerpts from what the
magazine said were CIA interrogation records.
The Russian lieutenant said air defenses in the
eastern Soviet Union are manned by airmen
considered disciplinary problems, Stern re
ported. Belenko himself was assigned to Siberia
for that reason, it said.
"They (the pilots) are like wolves," he was
quoted as saying. "They try to collect laurels
through daring actions against Chinese combat
aircraft and U.S. spy planes in order to get
posted back to the west of the Soviet Union."
The pilots are ordered to pick out enemy
targets for suicide attacks in combat emergen
cies and "whoever returns is shot," he repor
tedly said.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. Lows in the 3()s
to mid 40s with local frost. Highs in the 50s.
Winds mostly northerly 15 to 25 mph.
Rabin faces suicide scandal
Tel Aviv — Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
faced with a scandal before upcoming elections,
said yesterday that Housing Minister Avraham
Ofer, who committed suicide three days ago,
was innocent of accepting kickbacks.
Ofer shot himself after press reports linked his
name to alleged real estate deals.
Rabin, in a eulogy at the 54-year-old Polish
immigrant's funeral, called the reports "libels. 1 '
"Will this serve to shock, to teach how careful
people must be in their speech and in the press
to honor a man and his innocence, and not to
judge without trial?" Rabin said.
Ofer committed suicide Monday night in his
car near his Tel Aviv home, leaving a note in
which he protested his innocence and asked:
"Why did they persecute me all the time?"
Despite Rabin's strong defense of Ofer, the
burgeoning scandal involving Ofer's name and
other stalwards of the ruling Labor party could
hurt the prime minister in May elections, politi
cal analysts said.
The Israeli parliament voted to dissolve itself
and hold national elections May 17, five months
ahead of schedule. The vote followed Rabin's
resignation two weeks ago. Rabin will continue
as a caretaker prime minister until the voting.
Ford backs Texan for party head
Washington — President Gerald Ford decided
yesterday that he wants Texas lawyer James
Baker 111 to be the new chairman of the Republi
can Party, a White House source said.
The source said Ford made his preference
known in a telephone conversation with outgo
ing Chairman Mary Louise Smith. Ford talked
with Smith after a luncheon with other senior
party leaders at the White House failed to come
up with a consensus candidate.
In a telephone call to Smith, Ford emphasized
it is "the Republican National Committee's
(RNC) responsibility to pick a new chairman and
that he will support whoever the RNC picks,"
the source said.
However, the source said Ford told Smith that
Baker, Ford's campaign manager, was his
choice.
Smith was in Philadelphia for a speaking en
gagement and could not be reached for com
ment.
Ford's decision to back a candidate for party
chairman came after he hosted a luncheon for
Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, former
California Gov. Ronald Reagan and former
Treasury Secretary John Connally.
But unlike a similar meeting last month, this
one broke up without any formal announcement
or briefing from the participants. Only Reagan

made a few remarks to reporters who caught him
at a White House gate.
Reagan said the four decided to leave the
selection of a new party chairman up to the Re
publican National Committee and did not try to
come up with a consensus candidate.
School finance proposal endorsed
Sacramento — Assembly Speaker Leo McCar
thy cautiously endorsed Gov. Edmund Brown
Jr.'s $3.3-billion school finance proposal yester
day and said he believes the five-year plan can
be financed without a tax increase.
McCarthy, a Democrat whose home city of San
Francisco would get little or nothing from the
Brown proposal, told a news conference after 24
hours silence on the plan that he endorses "the
general essence of the program.
"I am convinced the plan submitted to legis
lators Tuesday is a serious, thoughtful and com
prehensive plan. I believe the plan is sufficiently
long-range to meet the future needs of our chil
dren," McCarthy said.

Judge permits execution filmings
Huntsville, Tex. — U.S. District Court Judge
William Taylor of Dallas recently signed an
order permitting the television filming of execu
tions at the state prison. His action came as a
result of a lawsuit filed by Dallas television
newsman Tony Garrett of the public KERA-TV.

Taylor also ruled that interviews with death
row inmates, halted about a month ago by the
Texas Department of Corrections (TDC), must be
resumed.
W.J. Estelle Jr., director of TDC, said Tuesday
his agency would abide by the court order on
television filming of executions and that inter
views would be permitted on Wednesdays from
9 a.m. to 11 a.m.
Convict Jerry Jurek agreed to meet with repor
ters yesterday, but several others on death row
refused the requests for interviews.
Unless he is granted a stay of execution, Jurek,
25, will be the first person executed in Texas
since 1964.
Soviet pilot tells of Kamikaze plans
Hamburg, West Germany — A Soviet fighter
pilot who defected to the West told his American
interrogators that Russian combat pilots have
orders to make kamikaze-style suicide attacks
rather than bail out in wartime emergencies,
Stern magazine says.
Those who return alive are to be shot, the
pilot, Victor Belenko, reportedly said.
The weekly West German magazine also
quoted Central Intelligence Agency sources as
saying Belenko suffered a nervous collapse dur
ing weeks of intense grilling by the CIA, and it
said he was now living at a secret location on
$1500-a-month support payments.
Belenko flew his top-secret MIG2S jet from
Siberia to Japan's Hakodate airport Sept. 9 and
told the astonished Japanese he wanted political
asylum in the United States.
U.S. experts examined the plane thoroughly
before it was returned to the Soviets, and Be
lenko was taken to the United States.
The Stern article, scheduled for publication
today, contained excerpts from what the
magazine said were CIA interrogation records.
The Russian lieutenant said air defenses in the
eastern Soviet Union are manned by airmen
considered disciplinary problems, Stern re
ported. Belenko himself was assigned to Siberia
for that reason, it said.
"They (the pilots) are like wolves," he was
quoted as saying. "They try to collect laurels
through daring actions against Chinese combat
aircraft and U.S. spy planes in order to get
posted back to the west of the Soviet Union."
The pilots are ordered to pick out enemy
targets for suicide attacks in combat emergen
cies and "whoever returns is shot," he repor
tedly said.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. Lows in the 3()s
to mid 40s with local frost. Highs in the 50s.
Winds mostly northerly 15 to 25 mph.
Rabin faces suicide scandal
Tel Aviv — Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
faced with a scandal before upcoming elections,
said yesterday that Housing Minister Avraham
Ofer, who committed suicide three days ago,
was innocent of accepting kickbacks.
Ofer shot himself after press reports linked his
name to alleged real estate deals.
Rabin, in a eulogy at the 54-year-old Polish
immigrant's funeral, called the reports "libels. 1 '
"Will this serve to shock, to teach how careful
people must be in their speech and in the press
to honor a man and his innocence, and not to
judge without trial?" Rabin said.
Ofer committed suicide Monday night in his
car near his Tel Aviv home, leaving a note in
which he protested his innocence and asked:
"Why did they persecute me all the time?"
Despite Rabin's strong defense of Ofer, the
burgeoning scandal involving Ofer's name and
other stalwards of the ruling Labor party could
hurt the prime minister in May elections, politi
cal analysts said.
The Israeli parliament voted to dissolve itself
and hold national elections May 17, five months
ahead of schedule. The vote followed Rabin's
resignation two weeks ago. Rabin will continue
as a caretaker prime minister until the voting.
Ford backs Texan for party head
Washington — President Gerald Ford decided
yesterday that he wants Texas lawyer James
Baker 111 to be the new chairman of the Republi
can Party, a White House source said.
The source said Ford made his preference
known in a telephone conversation with outgo
ing Chairman Mary Louise Smith. Ford talked
with Smith after a luncheon with other senior
party leaders at the White House failed to come
up with a consensus candidate.
In a telephone call to Smith, Ford emphasized
it is "the Republican National Committee's
(RNC) responsibility to pick a new chairman and
that he will support whoever the RNC picks,"
the source said.
However, the source said Ford told Smith that
Baker, Ford's campaign manager, was his
choice.
Smith was in Philadelphia for a speaking en
gagement and could not be reached for com
ment.
Ford's decision to back a candidate for party
chairman came after he hosted a luncheon for
Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, former
California Gov. Ronald Reagan and former
Treasury Secretary John Connally.
But unlike a similar meeting last month, this
one broke up without any formal announcement
or briefing from the participants. Only Reagan

made a few remarks to reporters who caught him
at a White House gate.
Reagan said the four decided to leave the
selection of a new party chairman up to the Re
publican National Committee and did not try to
come up with a consensus candidate.
School finance proposal endorsed
Sacramento — Assembly Speaker Leo McCar
thy cautiously endorsed Gov. Edmund Brown
Jr.'s $3.3-billion school finance proposal yester
day and said he believes the five-year plan can
be financed without a tax increase.
McCarthy, a Democrat whose home city of San
Francisco would get little or nothing from the
Brown proposal, told a news conference after 24
hours silence on the plan that he endorses "the
general essence of the program.
"I am convinced the plan submitted to legis
lators Tuesday is a serious, thoughtful and com
prehensive plan. I believe the plan is sufficiently
long-range to meet the future needs of our chil
dren," McCarthy said.
But he refused to endorse specific points, say
ing the plan is too complex to analyze quickly.
The Brown proposal, intended to help
equalize funding between poor and wealthy
school districts, was unveiled Tuesday — a
week after the state Supreme Court ruled that
California's school financing system was un
constitutional because it allowed an imbalance
in spending that resulted in unequal educa
tional opportunity.
Soviet Union harvests record crop
Moscow — The Soviet Union harvested a re
cord grain crop of 223.8 million metric tons in
1976, Agriculture Minister Valentin Mesyats
announced yesterday.
Mesyats, confirming previous hints at a
bumper crop, told a news conference the Soviet
Union plans to boost the average annual harvest
of grain to 235 million tons by 1980.
Despite the good performance, the minister
said, the Soviets will fulfill their commitments
to buy grain abroad. Those commitments in
clude a minimum six-million-ton annual purch
ase from the United States, a minimum that U.S.
officials say has already been surpassed.
The 1976 record figure compares with the
previous record of 222.5 million tons in 1973
and with the disastrous 1975 figure of 140 mill
ion, a 10-year low.
Poor Soviet crops in the past led to raids on the
American market, driving up domestic prices.
As a consequence, the United States persuaded
the Soviets to sign up for the six-million-ton
annual minimum so the market would not be
disturbed. The agreement, signed in 1975, runs

for five years.
After talks with Soviet officials here last
month. Richard Bell, an assistant U.S. agricul
ture secretary, said the Russians had already
purchased 6.6 million tons of American wheat
and corn from the 1976 crop and had no im
mediate plans to buy more.
Soviets refuse to pay Sinai share
United Nations. N.Y. — The Soviet Union has
balked at paying several million dollars of its
pledged share for supporting U.N. peacekeeping
forces in the Middle East because Moscow did
not participate in drawing up the 1975 Sinai
disengagement agreement.
The refusal came in a Soviet letter to IJ.N.
headquarters dealing with a year-old bill of
$16.5 million toward the cost of keeping U.N.
troops in the Golan Heights and the Sinai penin
sula.
The letter, dated Dec. 30 and released Tues
day, contains figures that do not coincide with
those on the IJ.N. books. It left officials here
puzzled as to how much the Russians plan to
withhold — $10 million or $4.5 million.
Both U.N. and American officials said they
were taken by surprise, since the Soviets have
consistently supported renewal of the Mideast
forces and backed the budgets adopted for the
purpose by the General Assembly.
State court won't review death law
San Francisco — The California Supreme
Court refused yesterday to reconsider its Dec. 7
decision holding the state's death penalty law
unconstitutional.
The brief order denied Atty. Gen. Evelle J.
Younger's petition for rehearing.
Deputy Atty. Gen. Howard Schwab of Los
Angeles said the court had been asked to modify
certain language in its decision.
"We felt the language of the opinion was too
broad and seemed to exclude all mandatory
death penalties," he explained.
Schwab noted that the U.S. Supreme Court
last November agreed to hear a case in which the
sole issue was the constitutionality of a mandat
ory death penalty as applied to first degree mur

immigrant's funeral, called the reports "libels. 1 '
"Will this serve to shock, to teach how careful
people must be in their speech and in the press
to honor a man and his innocence, and not to
judge without trial?" Rabin said.
Ofer committed suicide Monday night in his
car near his Tel Aviv home, leaving a note in
which he protested his innocence and asked:
"Why did they persecute me all the time?"
Despite Rabin's strong defense of Ofer, the
burgeoning scandal involving Ofer's name and
other stalwards of the ruling Labor party could
hurt the prime minister in May elections, politi
cal analysts said.
The Israeli parliament voted to dissolve itself
and hold national elections May 17, five months
ahead of schedule. The vote followed Rabin's
resignation two weeks ago. Rabin will continue
as a caretaker prime minister until the voting.
Ford backs Texan for party head
Washington — President Gerald Ford decided
yesterday that he wants Texas lawyer James
Baker 111 to be the new chairman of the Republi
can Party, a White House source said.
The source said Ford made his preference
known in a telephone conversation with outgo
ing Chairman Mary Louise Smith. Ford talked
with Smith after a luncheon with other senior
party leaders at the White House failed to come
up with a consensus candidate.
In a telephone call to Smith, Ford emphasized
it is "the Republican National Committee's
(RNC) responsibility to pick a new chairman and
that he will support whoever the RNC picks,"
the source said.
However, the source said Ford told Smith that
Baker, Ford's campaign manager, was his
choice.
Smith was in Philadelphia for a speaking en
gagement and could not be reached for com
ment.
Ford's decision to back a candidate for party
chairman came after he hosted a luncheon for
Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, former
California Gov. Ronald Reagan and former
Treasury Secretary John Connally.
But unlike a similar meeting last month, this
one broke up without any formal announcement
or briefing from the participants. Only Reagan

made a few remarks to reporters who caught him
at a White House gate.
Reagan said the four decided to leave the
selection of a new party chairman up to the Re
publican National Committee and did not try to
come up with a consensus candidate.
School finance proposal endorsed
Sacramento — Assembly Speaker Leo McCar
thy cautiously endorsed Gov. Edmund Brown
Jr.'s $3.3-billion school finance proposal yester
day and said he believes the five-year plan can
be financed without a tax increase.
McCarthy, a Democrat whose home city of San
Francisco would get little or nothing from the
Brown proposal, told a news conference after 24
hours silence on the plan that he endorses "the
general essence of the program.
"I am convinced the plan submitted to legis
lators Tuesday is a serious, thoughtful and com
prehensive plan. I believe the plan is sufficiently
long-range to meet the future needs of our chil
dren," McCarthy said.
But he refused to endorse specific points, say
ing the plan is too complex to analyze quickly.
The Brown proposal, intended to help
equalize funding between poor and wealthy
school districts, was unveiled Tuesday — a
week after the state Supreme Court ruled that
California's school financing system was un
constitutional because it allowed an imbalance
in spending that resulted in unequal educa
tional opportunity.
Soviet Union harvests record crop
Moscow — The Soviet Union harvested a re
cord grain crop of 223.8 million metric tons in
1976, Agriculture Minister Valentin Mesyats
announced yesterday.
Mesyats, confirming previous hints at a
bumper crop, told a news conference the Soviet
Union plans to boost the average annual harvest
of grain to 235 million tons by 1980.
Despite the good performance, the minister
said, the Soviets will fulfill their commitments
to buy grain abroad. Those commitments in
clude a minimum six-million-ton annual purch
ase from the United States, a minimum that U.S.
officials say has already been surpassed.
The 1976 record figure compares with the
previous record of 222.5 million tons in 1973
and with the disastrous 1975 figure of 140 mill
ion, a 10-year low.
Poor Soviet crops in the past led to raids on the
American market, driving up domestic prices.
As a consequence, the United States persuaded
the Soviets to sign up for the six-million-ton
annual minimum so the market would not be
disturbed. The agreement, signed in 1975, runs

for five years.
After talks with Soviet officials here last
month. Richard Bell, an assistant U.S. agricul
ture secretary, said the Russians had already
purchased 6.6 million tons of American wheat
and corn from the 1976 crop and had no im
mediate plans to buy more.
Soviets refuse to pay Sinai share
United Nations. N.Y. — The Soviet Union has
balked at paying several million dollars of its
pledged share for supporting U.N. peacekeeping
forces in the Middle East because Moscow did
not participate in drawing up the 1975 Sinai
disengagement agreement.
The refusal came in a Soviet letter to IJ.N.
headquarters dealing with a year-old bill of
$16.5 million toward the cost of keeping U.N.
troops in the Golan Heights and the Sinai penin
sula.
The letter, dated Dec. 30 and released Tues
day, contains figures that do not coincide with
those on the IJ.N. books. It left officials here
puzzled as to how much the Russians plan to
withhold — $10 million or $4.5 million.
Both U.N. and American officials said they
were taken by surprise, since the Soviets have
consistently supported renewal of the Mideast
forces and backed the budgets adopted for the
purpose by the General Assembly.
State court won't review death law
San Francisco — The California Supreme
Court refused yesterday to reconsider its Dec. 7
decision holding the state's death penalty law
unconstitutional.
The brief order denied Atty. Gen. Evelle J.
Younger's petition for rehearing.
Deputy Atty. Gen. Howard Schwab of Los
Angeles said the court had been asked to modify
certain language in its decision.
"We felt the language of the opinion was too
broad and seemed to exclude all mandatory
death penalties," he explained.
Schwab noted that the U.S. Supreme Court
last November agreed to hear a case in which the
sole issue was the constitutionality of a mandat
ory death penalty as applied to first degree mur
der of a peace officer.
Judge permits execution filmings
Huntsville, Tex. — U.S. District Court Judge
William Taylor of Dallas recently signed an
order permitting the television filming of execu
tions at the state prison. His action came as a
result of a lawsuit filed by Dallas television
newsman Tony Garrett of the public KERA-TV.

Taylor also ruled that interviews with death
row inmates, halted about a month ago by the
Texas Department of Corrections (TDC), must be
resumed.
W.J. Estelle Jr., director of TDC, said Tuesday
his agency would abide by the court order on
television filming of executions and that inter
views would be permitted on Wednesdays from
9 a.m. to 11 a.m.
Convict Jerry Jurek agreed to meet with repor
ters yesterday, but several others on death row
refused the requests for interviews.
Unless he is granted a stay of execution, Jurek,
25, will be the first person executed in Texas
since 1964.
Soviet pilot tells of Kamikaze plans
Hamburg, West Germany — A Soviet fighter
pilot who defected to the West told his American
interrogators that Russian combat pilots have
orders to make kamikaze-style suicide attacks
rather than bail out in wartime emergencies,
Stern magazine says.
Those who return alive are to be shot, the
pilot, Victor Belenko, reportedly said.
The weekly West German magazine also
quoted Central Intelligence Agency sources as
saying Belenko suffered a nervous collapse dur
ing weeks of intense grilling by the CIA, and it
said he was now living at a secret location on
$1500-a-month support payments.
Belenko flew his top-secret MIG2S jet from
Siberia to Japan's Hakodate airport Sept. 9 and
told the astonished Japanese he wanted political
asylum in the United States.
U.S. experts examined the plane thoroughly
before it was returned to the Soviets, and Be
lenko was taken to the United States.
The Stern article, scheduled for publication
today, contained excerpts from what the
magazine said were CIA interrogation records.
The Russian lieutenant said air defenses in the
eastern Soviet Union are manned by airmen
considered disciplinary problems, Stern re
ported. Belenko himself was assigned to Siberia
for that reason, it said.
"They (the pilots) are like wolves," he was
quoted as saying. "They try to collect laurels
through daring actions against Chinese combat
aircraft and U.S. spy planes in order to get
posted back to the west of the Soviet Union."
The pilots are ordered to pick out enemy
targets for suicide attacks in combat emergen
cies and "whoever returns is shot," he repor
tedly said.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. Lows in the 3()s
to mid 40s with local frost. Highs in the 50s.

Rabin faces suicide scandal
Tel Aviv — Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
faced with a scandal before upcoming elections,
said yesterday that Housing Minister Avraham
Ofer, who committed suicide three days ago,
was innocent of accepting kickbacks.
Ofer shot himself after press reports linked his
name to alleged real estate deals.

Moscow — The Soviet Union harvested a re
cord grain crop of 223.8 million metric tons in
1976, Agriculture Minister Valentin Mesyats
announced yesterday.
Mesyats, confirming previous hints at a
bumper crop, told a news conference the Soviet
Union plans to boost the average annual harvest
of grain to 235 million tons by 1980.
Despite the good performance, the minister
said, the Soviets will fulfill their commitments
to buy grain abroad. Those commitments in
clude a minimum six-million-ton annual purch
ase from the United States, a minimum that U.S.
officials say has already been surpassed.
The 1976 record figure compares with the
previous record of 222.5 million tons in 1973
and with the disastrous 1975 figure of 140 mill
ion, a 10-year low.
Poor Soviet crops in the past led to raids on the
American market, driving up domestic prices.
As a consequence, the United States persuaded
the Soviets to sign up for the six-million-ton
annual minimum so the market would not be
disturbed. The agreement, signed in 1975, runs

for five years.
After talks with Soviet officials here last
month. Richard Bell, an assistant U.S. agricul
ture secretary, said the Russians had already
purchased 6.6 million tons of American wheat
and corn from the 1976 crop and had no im
mediate plans to buy more.
Soviets refuse to pay Sinai share
United Nations. N.Y. — The Soviet Union has
balked at paying several million dollars of its
pledged share for supporting U.N. peacekeeping
forces in the Middle East because Moscow did
not participate in drawing up the 1975 Sinai
disengagement agreement.
The refusal came in a Soviet letter to IJ.N.
headquarters dealing with a year-old bill of
$16.5 million toward the cost of keeping U.N.
troops in the Golan Heights and the Sinai penin
sula.
The letter, dated Dec. 30 and released Tues
day, contains figures that do not coincide with
those on the IJ.N. books. It left officials here
puzzled as to how much the Russians plan to
withhold — $10 million or $4.5 million.
Both U.N. and American officials said they
were taken by surprise, since the Soviets have
consistently supported renewal of the Mideast
forces and backed the budgets adopted for the
purpose by the General Assembly.
State court won't review death law
San Francisco — The California Supreme
Court refused yesterday to reconsider its Dec. 7
decision holding the state's death penalty law
unconstitutional.
The brief order denied Atty. Gen. Evelle J.
Younger's petition for rehearing.
Deputy Atty. Gen. Howard Schwab of Los
Angeles said the court had been asked to modify
certain language in its decision.
"We felt the language of the opinion was too
broad and seemed to exclude all mandatory
death penalties," he explained.
Schwab noted that the U.S. Supreme Court
last November agreed to hear a case in which the
sole issue was the constitutionality of a mandat
ory death penalty as applied to first degree mur
der of a peace officer.
Judge permits execution filmings
Huntsville, Tex. — U.S. District Court Judge
William Taylor of Dallas recently signed an
order permitting the television filming of execu
tions at the state prison. His action came as a
result of a lawsuit filed by Dallas television
newsman Tony Garrett of the public KERA-TV.

Taylor also ruled that interviews with death
row inmates, halted about a month ago by the
Texas Department of Corrections (TDC), must be
resumed.
W.J. Estelle Jr., director of TDC, said Tuesday
his agency would abide by the court order on
television filming of executions and that inter
views would be permitted on Wednesdays from
9 a.m. to 11 a.m.
Convict Jerry Jurek agreed to meet with repor
ters yesterday, but several others on death row
refused the requests for interviews.
Unless he is granted a stay of execution, Jurek,
25, will be the first person executed in Texas
since 1964.
Soviet pilot tells of Kamikaze plans
Hamburg, West Germany — A Soviet fighter
pilot who defected to the West told his American
interrogators that Russian combat pilots have
orders to make kamikaze-style suicide attacks
rather than bail out in wartime emergencies,
Stern magazine says.
Those who return alive are to be shot, the
pilot, Victor Belenko, reportedly said.
The weekly West German magazine also
quoted Central Intelligence Agency sources as
saying Belenko suffered a nervous collapse dur
ing weeks of intense grilling by the CIA, and it
said he was now living at a secret location on
$1500-a-month support payments.
Belenko flew his top-secret MIG2S jet from
Siberia to Japan's Hakodate airport Sept. 9 and
told the astonished Japanese he wanted political
asylum in the United States.
U.S. experts examined the plane thoroughly
before it was returned to the Soviets, and Be
lenko was taken to the United States.
The Stern article, scheduled for publication
today, contained excerpts from what the
magazine said were CIA interrogation records.
The Russian lieutenant said air defenses in the
eastern Soviet Union are manned by airmen
considered disciplinary problems, Stern re
ported. Belenko himself was assigned to Siberia
for that reason, it said.
"They (the pilots) are like wolves," he was
quoted as saying. "They try to collect laurels
through daring actions against Chinese combat
aircraft and U.S. spy planes in order to get
posted back to the west of the Soviet Union."
The pilots are ordered to pick out enemy
targets for suicide attacks in combat emergen
cies and "whoever returns is shot," he repor
tedly said.
