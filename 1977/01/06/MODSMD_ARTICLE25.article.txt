Meat fraud on campus
Several university employes and
Palo Alto residents have complained
about vendors who sell meat directly
from trucks and misrepresent their
product. The vendors purport to be
wholesalers who have just made a
large delivery and have some meat left
over that they wish to sell rather than
return to the company. They promise
high quality for low prices.
However, Karen Keniston, a Main
Library assistant, who bought some of
the meat claimed her purchase was of
poor quality and short-weighted.
The vendors sell their meat by the
piece (not by weight) and thus appear
to be in violation of California state law
which requires them to sell it by the
pound.
Law prof wins award
Lawrence Friedman, professor at the
Law School, was awarded the Trien
nial Award of the Order of the Coif last
week for his scholarly work in law.
Friedman received the award last
Tuesday in Houston at the annual
meeting of the Association of Ameri
can Law Schools.
The award includes a $1000 prize.
The award is made every three years
in recognition of "authorship of a writ
ten work evidencing creative legal ta
lent of the highest order."
