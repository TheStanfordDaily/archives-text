## Lyman to push 'need' proposal 
### Dave Smith 
President Richard Lyman will lead a
four-man Stanford contingent to the
NCAA convention in Miami this
weekend to resume pushing a cause
that almost triumphed a year ago—
rewriting NCAA rules to make all col
lege athletic scholarships based on fi
nancial need.
Last year a "need" proposal, sup
ported prominently by Lyman and ath
letic director Joe Ruetz, failed in a
roll-call vote after balloting among Di
vision I schools had ended in a 119-
119 deadlock.
This year's balloting may be almost
as close because a solid bloc of tradi
tional athletic powers will oppose any
change from the current policy of
awarding full scholarships for capable
athletes regardless of their financial
status.
The members of the Pacific 8 confer
ence, which includes Stanford, will
unanimously support a change in the
scholarship rule this year, according to

USC athletic director Richard Perry.
Representatives of the conference
schools will meet on Monday morning
to decide between essentially similar
proposals by UC-Berkeley, Oregon
State and Stanford.
USC and Berkeley, which opposed
the rule change last year, have appa
rently fallen into line with the rest of
the conference schools because of the

substantial dollar
savings—up to
$150,000 per year
for Stanford alone,
according to Ly
man. But the prop
osal appears dis
tinctly less popular
among athletic di
rectors and
coaches than
among university
administrators.

Disagreement
"I think there has been a lot of disag
reement between athletic departments
and presidents," said Perry. "I'm per
sonally opposed to the change, and I
could list some reasons—but that
wouldn't make any difference. My
president is supporting it, so I'm sup
porting it."
Athletic director Don Canham of the
University of Michigan, a school op
posing the Pac-B's plan, is not so hesit
ant to speak against "need" scholar
ships. "It would be a giant step back
wards," he said.
"The cost of administering it alone
would practically wipe out any advan
tages. And coaches now are so over
worked. they don't have time to worry
about how the kids they recruit will be
able to support themselves."
'Disaster'
The Big Ten conference schools,
which include Michigan, eight other
state universities, and Northwestern,
formerly awarded need-based athletic
scholarships. Canham called that pol
icy "a disaster.

"You had kids working as janitors or
taking jobs screwing in light bulbs,"
said Canham; "We're lucky that we
can help our athletes get summer jobs
in automobile plants, but they don't
have time to work during the school
year. If this need proposal goes
through, they'll have to take other
jobs—kids nowadays are too proud to
ask their parents for money."
Michigan will sponsor a com
promise resolution, exempting foot
ball and basketball but providing for
need-based scholarships in other
sports. Among Big Ten schools,
Northwestern and Minnesota will ap
parently support the Pac-8 proposal,
but the plan will get little or no support
from the football-rich Southwest,
Southeast and Big Eight conferences
and major independents such as Notre
Dame.
'Super conference?'
These schools derive considerable
revenue from telecasts of their games
and might earn more if they were out
side the NCAA. If the Pac-8 proposal
were to pass, pressures to reorganize
the NCAA to include a "super confer
ence" would increase, Nebraska athle
tic director Bob Devaney predicted.
"If schools can't do what they want
within the NCAA, they're going to talk
about forming other organizations
alongside it," Devaney said. "No one's
talking about seceding, but I'm sure
you'd find a lot of opposition to the
plan in our conference (the Big
Eight)."
Will anything like the plan Stanford
supports pass? "No chance," said Ber
keley athletic director Dave Maggard,
citing the plan's fervent opponents.
Perry of USC is not so sure. "You
hear rumbles, and people say it can't
pass," he said, "but I reflect on what
happened last year and I think it has a
chance."
"There's probably been a lot of
politicking in the past year," said
Ruetz. "But if it passes, the Pac-8 and

Big Ten will hold together on this, and
then the NCAA can't fall apart. It will
all come down to whether the presi
dents will tell the athletic directors
that this is a step we need to take."

can help our athletes get summer jobs
in automobile plants, but they don't
have time to work during the school
year. If this need proposal goes
through, they'll have to take other
jobs—kids nowadays are too proud to
ask their parents for money."
Michigan will sponsor a com
promise resolution, exempting foot
ball and basketball but providing for
need-based scholarships in other
sports. Among Big Ten schools,
Northwestern and Minnesota will ap
parently support the Pac-8 proposal,
but the plan will get little or no support
from the football-rich Southwest,
Southeast and Big Eight conferences
and major independents such as Notre
Dame.
'Super conference?'
These schools derive considerable
revenue from telecasts of their games
and might earn more if they were out
side the NCAA. If the Pac-8 proposal
were to pass, pressures to reorganize
the NCAA to include a "super confer
ence" would increase, Nebraska athle
tic director Bob Devaney predicted.
"If schools can't do what they want
within the NCAA, they're going to talk
about forming other organizations
alongside it," Devaney said. "No one's
talking about seceding, but I'm sure
you'd find a lot of opposition to the
plan in our conference (the Big
Eight)."
Will anything like the plan Stanford
supports pass? "No chance," said Ber
keley athletic director Dave Maggard,
citing the plan's fervent opponents.
Perry of USC is not so sure. "You
hear rumbles, and people say it can't
pass," he said, "but I reflect on what
happened last year and I think it has a
chance."
"There's probably been a lot of
politicking in the past year," said
Ruetz. "But if it passes, the Pac-8 and

Big Ten will hold together on this, and
then the NCAA can't fall apart. It will
all come down to whether the presi
dents will tell the athletic directors
that this is a step we need to take."

Richard Lyman
President Richard Lyman will lead a
four-man Stanford contingent to the
NCAA convention in Miami this
weekend to resume pushing a cause
that almost triumphed a year ago—
rewriting NCAA rules to make all col
lege athletic scholarships based on fi
nancial need.
Last year a "need" proposal, sup
ported prominently by Lyman and ath
letic director Joe Ruetz, failed in a
roll-call vote after balloting among Di
vision I schools had ended in a 119-
119 deadlock.
This year's balloting may be almost
as close because a solid bloc of tradi
tional athletic powers will oppose any
change from the current policy of
awarding full scholarships for capable
athletes regardless of their financial
status.
The members of the Pacific 8 confer
ence, which includes Stanford, will
unanimously support a change in the
scholarship rule this year, according to

USC athletic director Richard Perry.
Representatives of the conference
schools will meet on Monday morning
to decide between essentially similar
proposals by UC-Berkeley, Oregon
State and Stanford.
USC and Berkeley, which opposed
the rule change last year, have appa
rently fallen into line with the rest of
the conference schools because of the

substantial dollar
savings—up to
$150,000 per year
for Stanford alone,
according to Ly
man. But the prop
osal appears dis
tinctly less popular
among athletic di
rectors and
coaches than
among university
administrators.

Disagreement
"I think there has been a lot of disag
reement between athletic departments
and presidents," said Perry. "I'm per
sonally opposed to the change, and I
could list some reasons—but that
wouldn't make any difference. My
president is supporting it, so I'm sup
porting it."
Athletic director Don Canham of the
University of Michigan, a school op
posing the Pac-B's plan, is not so hesit
ant to speak against "need" scholar
ships. "It would be a giant step back
wards," he said.
"The cost of administering it alone
would practically wipe out any advan
tages. And coaches now are so over
worked. they don't have time to worry
about how the kids they recruit will be
able to support themselves."
'Disaster'
The Big Ten conference schools,
which include Michigan, eight other
state universities, and Northwestern,
formerly awarded need-based athletic
scholarships. Canham called that pol
icy "a disaster.

"You had kids working as janitors or
taking jobs screwing in light bulbs,"
said Canham; "We're lucky that we
can help our athletes get summer jobs
in automobile plants, but they don't
have time to work during the school
year. If this need proposal goes

ported prominently by Lyman and ath
letic director Joe Ruetz, failed in a
roll-call vote after balloting among Di
vision I schools had ended in a 119-
119 deadlock.
This year's balloting may be almost
as close because a solid bloc of tradi
tional athletic powers will oppose any
change from the current policy of
awarding full scholarships for capable
athletes regardless of their financial
status.
The members of the Pacific 8 confer
ence, which includes Stanford, will
unanimously support a change in the
scholarship rule this year, according to

USC athletic director Richard Perry.
Representatives of the conference
schools will meet on Monday morning
to decide between essentially similar
proposals by UC-Berkeley, Oregon
State and Stanford.
USC and Berkeley, which opposed
the rule change last year, have appa
rently fallen into line with the rest of
the conference schools because of the

substantial dollar
savings—up to
$150,000 per year
for Stanford alone,
according to Ly
man. But the prop
osal appears dis
tinctly less popular
among athletic di
rectors and
coaches than
among university
administrators.

Disagreement
"I think there has been a lot of disag
reement between athletic departments
and presidents," said Perry. "I'm per
sonally opposed to the change, and I
could list some reasons—but that
wouldn't make any difference. My
president is supporting it, so I'm sup
porting it."
Athletic director Don Canham of the
University of Michigan, a school op
posing the Pac-B's plan, is not so hesit
ant to speak against "need" scholar
ships. "It would be a giant step back
wards," he said.
"The cost of administering it alone
would practically wipe out any advan
tages. And coaches now are so over
worked. they don't have time to worry
about how the kids they recruit will be
able to support themselves."
'Disaster'
The Big Ten conference schools,
which include Michigan, eight other
state universities, and Northwestern,
formerly awarded need-based athletic
scholarships. Canham called that pol
icy "a disaster.

"You had kids working as janitors or
taking jobs screwing in light bulbs,"
said Canham; "We're lucky that we
can help our athletes get summer jobs
in automobile plants, but they don't
have time to work during the school
year. If this need proposal goes
through, they'll have to take other
jobs—kids nowadays are too proud to
ask their parents for money."
Michigan will sponsor a com
promise resolution, exempting foot
ball and basketball but providing for
need-based scholarships in other
sports. Among Big Ten schools,
Northwestern and Minnesota will ap
parently support the Pac-8 proposal,
but the plan will get little or no support
from the football-rich Southwest,
Southeast and Big Eight conferences
and major independents such as Notre
Dame.
'Super conference?'
These schools derive considerable
revenue from telecasts of their games
and might earn more if they were out
side the NCAA. If the Pac-8 proposal
were to pass, pressures to reorganize
the NCAA to include a "super confer
ence" would increase, Nebraska athle
tic director Bob Devaney predicted.
"If schools can't do what they want
within the NCAA, they're going to talk
about forming other organizations
alongside it," Devaney said. "No one's
talking about seceding, but I'm sure
you'd find a lot of opposition to the
plan in our conference (the Big
Eight)."
Will anything like the plan Stanford
supports pass? "No chance," said Ber
keley athletic director Dave Maggard,
citing the plan's fervent opponents.
Perry of USC is not so sure. "You
hear rumbles, and people say it can't
pass," he said, "but I reflect on what
happened last year and I think it has a
chance."
"There's probably been a lot of
politicking in the past year," said
Ruetz. "But if it passes, the Pac-8 and

Big Ten will hold together on this, and
then the NCAA can't fall apart. It will
all come down to whether the presi
dents will tell the athletic directors
that this is a step we need to take."


Construction controversy
This new wing of the Stanford hospital is the subject of
a university claim for $14 million. Stanford claims the

building itself is worth only $13 million.
