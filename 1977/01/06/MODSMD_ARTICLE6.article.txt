# Stanford files building claim
## Seeks $14 million on Med Center wing 
### Dave Ansley 
The claim filed by the university
against the architects of the new Medi
cal Center wing will total about $14
million, more than the cost of the
building itself, a university lawyer
said yesterday.
The university is seeking reim
bursement from Caudill, Rowlett,
Scott of Houston for faults in the de
sign of the $13.23 million building.
Occupancy of the structure has been
repeatedly delayed by revisions and
corrections of building code viola
tions.
Cassius Kirk, university staff coun
sel, says the figure, a total from six
different complaints, is "misleading."
Each complaint is based on a different
legal argument, and some of thr items
overlap, he said.
"We've calculated the figure for the
first five: $13,351,215," he said, "but
the sixth one isn't precise yet — bet

ween six and seven hundred thousand
dollars."
Delays in opening
The wing, which will house post
operational and intensive-care
facilities, was originally scheduled to
accept patients in mid-1975. Design
changes intended to meet new ear
thquake codes pushed the opening
date back to last July. Hut a building
inspection last spring found more than
50 construction errors which must be
corrected before the facility can open.
Corrections are still not complete.'
The university planning office expects
the first patients to be admitted in
March.
Although claims for back charges
were originally filed almost a yearago,
the university has until now refused to
discuss the size of the claim. "We feel
it is essentially a private dispute," Kirk
said.
Confirmation
But a Caudill, Rowlett, Scott attor
ney released the information to the
Daily and Kirk said that "as long as
they're doing that," he would confirm
it.
Kirk admitted that Stanford does not
expect to recover all of the money. But
he said it "could be damaging" to dis
cuss the amount the university expects
to win. Kirk would say only that the
cost of the building itself was the
upper limit.
The claims ask payments for:
—the delay in completion of the
building;
—a failure to provide a precise cost
estimate;
—a design without provision for
later construction of a third floor;
—the fees originally paid to the ar
chitect; and
—the cost of reconstruction to meet
building codes.
Some of the construction problems
which required correction were;
—bathrooms lacking facilities for
the handicapped;
—sprinkler heads hanging too low
in halls;
—narrow exit doors; and
—inadequate fireproofing in some
sections.
Neither Stanford nor Caudill, Row
lett, Scott attorneys expect the matter
to be settled soon. They will most
likely submit the matter to an arbit
rator.
