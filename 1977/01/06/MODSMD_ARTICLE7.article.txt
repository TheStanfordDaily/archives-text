# New cells may offer cheaper solar energy
## 
### Karen Knowles 
Solar energy may become an effi
cient, economical electricity source as
a result of research being done here to
investigate new materials for making
solar energy cells.
New thin-film cells developed by re
searchers in the Materials Science En
gineering Department show promise
of equaling the efficiency of silicon
based cells now in use.
The present silicon cells are 10-15
per cent efficient, that is, electricity
produced generates only 10-15 per
cent of the energy needed to produce

the electricity. More important, the
thin-film cells might be much cheaper
to make.
Richard Bube, chairman of the Mate
rials Science Engineering Department,
and his research associate Alan
Fahrenbruch, plus Frederick Buch and
Kim Mitchell who earned their Ph.D.'s
doing the research, are publishing
their findings in the February issue of
Proceedings of the Institute of Electri
cal and Electronic Engineers.
The present silicon cells are used
most extensively for powering
specialized devices such as satellites,
remote microwave relay stations and
for preventing electrolytic corrosion of
water pipes.
From $15 to $.15
Bube estimated the cost of these cells
at $15 per watt. If the cost could be
reduced to between 15 and 50 cents
per watt. Bube said he believes solar
cells could be used for widespread
commercial power generation.
He estimated that equipping a house
to produce its own electricity from
solar energy would cost about
$100,000 at today's prices. The solar
cells alone would account for 75 per
cent of the cost, added Bube. With the
new cells, Bube said the total cost
could possibly be reduced to about
$1000 for a system Fahrenbruch says
will last for 20 years.
The new thin-film cells are made by
heating cadmium telluride in a vac
uum and evaporating it. Bube con
trasted this to the expensive, special
process through which silicon crystals
are grown and then sliced to the de
sired thickness to make the silicon
based cells.
Thinner and cheaper
He and Fahrenbruch predict thin
film cells will be much cheaper
because they are about 50 times thin
ner than the silicon cells, reducing the
amount and thus the cost of the mate
rials needed to make the cells.
"We just don't know how the costs
will work out," said Bube, "but we be
lieve they can be drastically reduced
with the right materials. Cadmium tel
luride is one of the most promising
compounds so far because its elec
tronic properties are ideally matched
to the sun's radiation."

The present silicon cells are used
most extensively for powering
specialized devices such as satellites,
remote microwave relay stations and
for preventing electrolytic corrosion of
water pipes.
From $15 to $.15
Bube estimated the cost of these cells
at $15 per watt. If the cost could be
reduced to between 15 and 50 cents
per watt. Bube said he believes solar
cells could be used for widespread
commercial power generation.
He estimated that equipping a house
to produce its own electricity from
solar energy would cost about
$100,000 at today's prices. The solar
cells alone would account for 75 per
cent of the cost, added Bube. With the
new cells, Bube said the total cost
could possibly be reduced to about
$1000 for a system Fahrenbruch says
will last for 20 years.
The new thin-film cells are made by
heating cadmium telluride in a vac
uum and evaporating it. Bube con
trasted this to the expensive, special
process through which silicon crystals
are grown and then sliced to the de
sired thickness to make the silicon
based cells.
Thinner and cheaper
He and Fahrenbruch predict thin
film cells will be much cheaper
because they are about 50 times thin
ner than the silicon cells, reducing the
amount and thus the cost of the mate
rials needed to make the cells.
"We just don't know how the costs
will work out," said Bube, "but we be
lieve they can be drastically reduced
with the right materials. Cadmium tel
luride is one of the most promising
compounds so far because its elec
tronic properties are ideally matched
to the sun's radiation."
Solar energy may become an effi
cient, economical electricity source as
a result of research being done here to
investigate new materials for making
solar energy cells.
New thin-film cells developed by re
searchers in the Materials Science En
gineering Department show promise
of equaling the efficiency of silicon
based cells now in use.
The present silicon cells are 10-15
per cent efficient, that is, electricity
produced generates only 10-15 per
cent of the energy needed to produce

the electricity. More important, the
thin-film cells might be much cheaper
to make.
