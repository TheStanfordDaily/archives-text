## Opinions Setting the record straight 
### 
Jordan Schwartz

Last month, the Daily opinions page
presented several letters dealing with
the Big Game Bonfire. These letters
have contained so much misinforma
tion and hypocrisy that I felt it neces
sary to set the record straight.
First of all, Don Barton's letter
(Daily, Nov. 29) needs to be clarified.
While it did touch upon the funda
mental reason for the bonfire's failure,
lack of active fraternity support, it also
contained a number of factual errors
and a generous helping of hypocrisy
since Barton's first involvement with
the bonfire after its cancellation.
But, more importantly, his letter
contained a great many of his personal
opinions. It must be emphasized that
these are his own feelings and do not
in any way represent the official views
or policy of the Inter-Fraternity Coun
cil (IFC).
Only statements of the IFC president
may be construed as representative of
the fraternity position.
Weakness
This points up the basic weakness of
David Lang's letter (Daily, Dec. 1),
which was signed, unlike Barton's,
with the name of an organization, the
Stanford Band. His attempt at cynical
profundity fails miserably when one
tries to discern the point of his letter.
His criticism of the IFC is totally un
warranted. He obviously has no
specific knowledge of the workings of
the IFC but has merely generalized
from Barton's letter.
As a Jew, I also found his cynical
hyperbole tasteless and personally of
fensive. I have no doubt that if the
Band had been present at the
Holocaust it would have been only to
play "All Right Now."
Of course, Lang can be satisfied that
his main purpose in writing that
ludicrous letter has been served. He
did get to see his name in print.
The letter from SAE (Daily, Dec. 1)
and Theta Xi expressing their opposi
tion to the bonfire troubles me deeply.
I have no objection to their opposition
to the bonfire, nor to the statement of
their reasons. I do, however, object to
their attempt to elicit sympathy from
the university community and to
arouse hostility towards the IFC as an
oppressive body by complaining,
"The bonfire is financed through dues
to the IFC, whose constitution de
mands expulsion of any fraternity
which does not pay in full."
Full aware
Both SAE and Theta Xi are fully
aware that IFC dues go to fund many
more projects than just the bonfire and
that, since there is rarely unanimity of
opinion on anything, every expendi
ture is debated and approved by a vote
of the council, the most democratic
process possible.
To complain about having to pay
dues in this case is analagous to
rationalizing tax evasion when you do
not agree with how every tax dollar is
spent. This year, every attempt possi

ble was made to take the views of the
houses opposed to the bonfire into ac
count.
I suggested having an additional
non-fire Big Game event which they
could assist in planning. I also asked
for input on how to make the bonfire
less of a polluter. Yet no one from these
houses came forward in an attempt to
cooperate. Instead, they stubbornly
continued to insist that the views of
the minority take precedence.
Amazement
The letter submitted by 24 members
of Ecology Action of Menlo Park
(Daily, Dec. 2) can only be viewed with
amazement. Although they oppose the
bonfire year after year, they have never
consulted anyone in the IFC, which
sponsors the bonfire. They have a pen
chant for throwing around numbers
which have been dubiously arrived at.
The only source of the "facts" they
have cited is a 1972 bonfire study
which dealt with a fire three times the

size of the one which would have been
constructed this year.
I am also outraged that they have the
audacity to cite the injuries as an ar
gument against the bonfire.
The viewpoint expressed by Ecol
ogy Action is a very curious one. A
small minority, they absolutely refuse
to accept the demonstrated fact of
popular support for the bonfire.
We do not expect their blessings.
But if they are truly concerned about
the environment, their time would be
better spent in a constructive effort to
help the IPC minimize or offset the pol
lutant effect of the bonfire.
The IFC has never disregarded the
concerns of the minority. However, it
will continue to do this by incorporat
ing those concerns and not by the hor
rible illogic of totally ignoring the
majority.

the bonfire after its cancellation.
But, more importantly, his letter
contained a great many of his personal
opinions. It must be emphasized that
these are his own feelings and do not
in any way represent the official views
or policy of the Inter-Fraternity Coun
cil (IFC).
Only statements of the IFC president
may be construed as representative of
the fraternity position.
Weakness
This points up the basic weakness of
David Lang's letter (Daily, Dec. 1),
which was signed, unlike Barton's,
with the name of an organization, the
Stanford Band. His attempt at cynical
profundity fails miserably when one
tries to discern the point of his letter.
His criticism of the IFC is totally un
warranted. He obviously has no
specific knowledge of the workings of
the IFC but has merely generalized
from Barton's letter.
As a Jew, I also found his cynical
hyperbole tasteless and personally of
fensive. I have no doubt that if the
Band had been present at the
Holocaust it would have been only to
play "All Right Now."
Of course, Lang can be satisfied that
his main purpose in writing that
ludicrous letter has been served. He
did get to see his name in print.
The letter from SAE (Daily, Dec. 1)
and Theta Xi expressing their opposi
tion to the bonfire troubles me deeply.
I have no objection to their opposition
to the bonfire, nor to the statement of
their reasons. I do, however, object to
their attempt to elicit sympathy from
the university community and to
arouse hostility towards the IFC as an
oppressive body by complaining,
"The bonfire is financed through dues
to the IFC, whose constitution de
mands expulsion of any fraternity
which does not pay in full."
Full aware
Both SAE and Theta Xi are fully
aware that IFC dues go to fund many
more projects than just the bonfire and
that, since there is rarely unanimity of
opinion on anything, every expendi
ture is debated and approved by a vote
of the council, the most democratic
process possible.
To complain about having to pay
dues in this case is analagous to
rationalizing tax evasion when you do
not agree with how every tax dollar is
spent. This year, every attempt possi

ble was made to take the views of the
houses opposed to the bonfire into ac
count.
I suggested having an additional
non-fire Big Game event which they
could assist in planning. I also asked
for input on how to make the bonfire
less of a polluter. Yet no one from these
houses came forward in an attempt to
cooperate. Instead, they stubbornly
continued to insist that the views of
the minority take precedence.
Amazement
The letter submitted by 24 members
of Ecology Action of Menlo Park
(Daily, Dec. 2) can only be viewed with
amazement. Although they oppose the
bonfire year after year, they have never
consulted anyone in the IFC, which
sponsors the bonfire. They have a pen
chant for throwing around numbers
which have been dubiously arrived at.
The only source of the "facts" they
have cited is a 1972 bonfire study
which dealt with a fire three times the

size of the one which would have been
constructed this year.
I am also outraged that they have the
audacity to cite the injuries as an ar
gument against the bonfire.
The viewpoint expressed by Ecol
ogy Action is a very curious one. A
small minority, they absolutely refuse
to accept the demonstrated fact of
popular support for the bonfire.
We do not expect their blessings.
But if they are truly concerned about
the environment, their time would be
better spent in a constructive effort to
help the IPC minimize or offset the pol
lutant effect of the bonfire.
The IFC has never disregarded the
concerns of the minority. However, it
will continue to do this by incorporat
ing those concerns and not by the hor
rible illogic of totally ignoring the
majority.

Last month, the Daily opinions page
presented several letters dealing with
the Big Game Bonfire. These letters
have contained so much misinforma
tion and hypocrisy that I felt it neces
sary to set the record straight.
First of all, Don Barton's letter
(Daily, Nov. 29) needs to be clarified.
While it did touch upon the funda
mental reason for the bonfire's failure,
lack of active fraternity support, it also
contained a number of factual errors
and a generous helping of hypocrisy
since Barton's first involvement with
the bonfire after its cancellation.
But, more importantly, his letter
contained a great many of his personal
