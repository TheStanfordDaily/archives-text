# Letter: death penalty
## 
### 
Joe Marshall writes as if he were a
doctor of psychiatry, which he isn't
(Daily, Dec. 1). If he believes in evolu
tion, then he surely can't believe that
killing is psychologically abnormal by
definition. All through history man
has killed for purposes of survival.
I doubt that one must become tem
porarily insane to defend against los
ing his life. If you follow Marshall's
logic to the extreme, then any mistake,
including his letter, can be excused as
a deranged act.
In a modern society, we must'ask
why a person kills before we label him
"psychologically abnormal" and
exempt from punishment. Marshall
has confused the cause and effect here.
It is the psychological abnormality

which causes the insane to kill.
It is not the killing that causes the
person to become psychologically ab
normal. Marshall has also made a
nonexistent distinction between an in
sane person who violates the rights of
others in some unspecified manner
and a "psychologically abnormal"
person who does the same thing.
If we believe Marshall's logic we
should define the norm as those who
don't kill and relieve any who do of
responsibility by putting them in an
insane asylum. This only gives us an
arbitrary norm.
Killing for gain or pleasure, like Joe
Marshall's letter, is inexcusable.
