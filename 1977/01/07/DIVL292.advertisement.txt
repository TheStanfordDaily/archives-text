This seminar will examine the properties of "light" — or
electromagnetic radiation — over the broad range of

for further discussion and readings about the many ways
in which "light" is used as an experimental tool. There will
be an opportunity to visit laboratories at the Stanford Syc
hrontron Radiation Project and the SLAC to observe exper
iments with researchers. High school physics is prerequis
