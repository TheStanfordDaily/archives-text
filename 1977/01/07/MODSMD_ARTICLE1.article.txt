California Sen. Alan Cranston's
selection as majority whip this week, a
significant achievement for one who
has served only one term and two years
in the U.S. Senate, was well received
by fellow senators and political obser
vers.
Now the second highest ranking
Democrat in the senate after party
leader Sen. Robert Byrd of West Vir
ginia, Cranston, an alumnus here, was
called one of the senate's "premier
barometers" by Los Angeles Times
writer John Averill because of his abil
ity to accurately predict the outcome of
floor votes.
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), said,
"Cranston does his homework and re
ally lines thingsup. If people waver he
is there to firm them up. He lines up 25
to 30 per cent of the votes on most
legislation."
Sen. Dick Clark (D-lowa), said,
"Alan certainly knows how to or
ganize votes. He is the only one around
here who does."
"Nuts and bolts"
Cranston's press secretary Peggy
Cuthbertson attributed Cranston's in
fluence to his willingness to do the
"nuts and bolts" work on behalf of so
cial legislation that other liberals es
pouse.
Cuthbertson added that Cranston's
success can be attributed to his inde
fatigable work habits and ability to
work out compromises on legislation
in order to produce the best possible
result. The senator has made it a point
to co sponsor some legislation with
every member of the senate, both
Democrats and Republicans,
Cuthbertson said.
At a news conference in his senate
office Tuesday, Cranston said that his
election as assistant Democratic leader
"will enhance my opportunities to be
effective on behalf of California."
"You have more strength as whip
and I can do more as whip," com
mented the former Stanford English
major. "I will not let my new respon
sibilities interfere with the time I de
vote to California problems, con
stituents, and visits."
Cranston said that the most pressing
issue is the economy which he said is
"obviously, .a California issue as well
as a national issue because we have
such a high unemployment rate.
We've got to get people back to work.
We've got to give confidence to busi
ness, consumers and investors," he
said.
Keep senate machine going
