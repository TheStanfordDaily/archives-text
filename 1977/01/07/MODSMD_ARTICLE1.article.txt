# Cranston's selection lauded
## 
### Marc Strassman 
California Sen. Alan Cranston's
selection as majority whip this week, a
significant achievement for one who
has served only one term and two years
in the U.S. Senate, was well received
by fellow senators and political obser
vers.
Now the second highest ranking
Democrat in the senate after party
leader Sen. Robert Byrd of West Vir
ginia, Cranston, an alumnus here, was
called one of the senate's "premier
barometers" by Los Angeles Times
writer John Averill because of his abil
ity to accurately predict the outcome of
floor votes.
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), said,
"Cranston does his homework and re
ally lines thingsup. If people waver he
is there to firm them up. He lines up 25
to 30 per cent of the votes on most
legislation."
Sen. Dick Clark (D-lowa), said,
"Alan certainly knows how to or
ganize votes. He is the only one around
here who does."
"Nuts and bolts"
Cranston's press secretary Peggy
Cuthbertson attributed Cranston's in
fluence to his willingness to do the
"nuts and bolts" work on behalf of so
cial legislation that other liberals es
pouse.
Cuthbertson added that Cranston's
success can be attributed to his inde
fatigable work habits and ability to
work out compromises on legislation
in order to produce the best possible
result. The senator has made it a point
to co sponsor some legislation with
every member of the senate, both
Democrats and Republicans,
Cuthbertson said.
At a news conference in his senate
office Tuesday, Cranston said that his
election as assistant Democratic leader
"will enhance my opportunities to be
effective on behalf of California."
"You have more strength as whip
and I can do more as whip," com
mented the former Stanford English
major. "I will not let my new respon
sibilities interfere with the time I de
vote to California problems, con
stituents, and visits."
Cranston said that the most pressing
issue is the economy which he said is
"obviously, .a California issue as well
as a national issue because we have
such a high unemployment rate.
We've got to get people back to work.
We've got to give confidence to busi
ness, consumers and investors," he
said.
Keep senate machine going
While acknowledging the impor
tance of his responsibilities to his
California constituents and his com-
mitment to economic activism,
Cranston also said "My most impor
tant responsibility is to make the se
nate work well, to make it strong and to
preserve its independence. 1 will keep
right on pitching in very hard on is
sues that I'm concerned about and
generating support for the positions
that 1 believe are wise ones."
Cranston also said that he vigor
ously supports a stringent code of
ethics for the senate "that is observed
and enforced."
Cranston now makes about 18 return
trips to California each year and his
press secretary said Cranston sees no
reason why he cannot continue to
make that many visits to the state or at
least spend an equal amount of time
here by making his individual trips
longer.
Cuthbertson also said that Cranston
will try during this session to make the
procedural reforms necessary to
"speed up" votes after closure (a mo
tion to shut off further debate).
Cranston's duties as whip, said
Cuthbertson, will be "counting noses,
recruiting votes and making sure col
legues are present." He will not have
the latitude to choose which issues to
work on (as he did when he was infor
mally the assistant whip). He will have
to work on every issue
She said that Cranston expects to es
tablish a close working relationship
with Byrd whom he succeeded as
majority whip.
Cuthbertson said that Cranston has
established good relations with
President-elect Jimmy Carter and had

been invited down to Plains, Georgia
for a meeting to discuss legislative
strategy for the current congressional
session.
Other Democratic senators attend
ing the session were: Minnesota's
Hubert Humphrey, recently elected
deputy president pro tem of the senate;
Byrd; Edmund Muskie of Maine, head
of the budget committee; John McClel
lan of Arkansas, chairman of the ap
propriations committee; Louisiana's
Russell Long, chairman of the finance
committee and Daniel Inouye of
Hawaii, the new secretary of the
Democratic conference, the third
highest position among the majority
Democrats in the senate.
Cranston was graduated from Stan
ford in 1936 and worked as a journalist
for International News Service (the
forerunner of United Press Interna
tional) in Ethiopia, Germany and Italy
in the late '30s, witnessing the rise of
European fascism. He was one of the
founders of the liberal California
Democratic Council (CDC) in 1953.
He was controller of the state of
California from 195H until 1966, when
he ran, unsuccessfully, in the U.S.
Senatorial primary. He ran again in
1968 and defeated Republican Max
Rafferty. He was reelected to the senate
in 1974 with a plurality senatorial
candidate and more votes than the 1.4
million votes nationwide that gave
Carter his presidential victory.
Cranston captained the congres
sional Democrats in a recent "King of
the Hill" athletic competition with
their Republican rivals and won the
bicycling competition.

Cranston captained the congres

their Republican rivals and won the
bicycling competition.
California Sen. Alan Cranston's
selection as majority whip this week, a
significant achievement for one who
has served only one term and two years
in the U.S. Senate, was well received
by fellow senators and political obser
vers.
Now the second highest ranking
Democrat in the senate after party
leader Sen. Robert Byrd of West Vir
ginia, Cranston, an alumnus here, was
called one of the senate's "premier
barometers" by Los Angeles Times
writer John Averill because of his abil
ity to accurately predict the outcome of
floor votes.
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), said,
"Cranston does his homework and re
ally lines thingsup. If people waver he
is there to firm them up. He lines up 25
to 30 per cent of the votes on most
legislation."
Sen. Dick Clark (D-lowa), said,
"Alan certainly knows how to or
ganize votes. He is the only one around
here who does."
"Nuts and bolts"
Cranston's press secretary Peggy
Cuthbertson attributed Cranston's in
fluence to his willingness to do the
"nuts and bolts" work on behalf of so
cial legislation that other liberals es
pouse.
Cuthbertson added that Cranston's
success can be attributed to his inde
fatigable work habits and ability to
work out compromises on legislation
in order to produce the best possible
result. The senator has made it a point
to co sponsor some legislation with
every member of the senate, both
Democrats and Republicans,
Cuthbertson said.
At a news conference in his senate
office Tuesday, Cranston said that his
election as assistant Democratic leader
"will enhance my opportunities to be
effective on behalf of California."
"You have more strength as whip
and I can do more as whip," com
mented the former Stanford English
major. "I will not let my new respon
sibilities interfere with the time I de
vote to California problems, con
stituents, and visits."
Cranston said that the most pressing
issue is the economy which he said is
"obviously, .a California issue as well
as a national issue because we have
such a high unemployment rate.
We've got to get people back to work.
We've got to give confidence to busi
ness, consumers and investors," he
said.
Keep senate machine going
While acknowledging the impor
tance of his responsibilities to his
California constituents and his com-
mitment to economic activism,
Cranston also said "My most impor
tant responsibility is to make the se
nate work well, to make it strong and to
preserve its independence. 1 will keep
right on pitching in very hard on is
sues that I'm concerned about and
generating support for the positions
that 1 believe are wise ones."
Cranston also said that he vigor
ously supports a stringent code of
ethics for the senate "that is observed
and enforced."
Cranston now makes about 18 return
trips to California each year and his
press secretary said Cranston sees no
reason why he cannot continue to
make that many visits to the state or at
least spend an equal amount of time
here by making his individual trips
longer.
Cuthbertson also said that Cranston
will try during this session to make the
procedural reforms necessary to
"speed up" votes after closure (a mo
tion to shut off further debate).
Cranston's duties as whip, said
Cuthbertson, will be "counting noses,
recruiting votes and making sure col
legues are present." He will not have
the latitude to choose which issues to
work on (as he did when he was infor
mally the assistant whip). He will have
to work on every issue
She said that Cranston expects to es
tablish a close working relationship
with Byrd whom he succeeded as
majority whip.
Cuthbertson said that Cranston has
established good relations with
President-elect Jimmy Carter and had

been invited down to Plains, Georgia
for a meeting to discuss legislative
strategy for the current congressional
session.
Other Democratic senators attend
ing the session were: Minnesota's
Hubert Humphrey, recently elected
deputy president pro tem of the senate;
Byrd; Edmund Muskie of Maine, head
of the budget committee; John McClel

propriations committee; Louisiana's
Russell Long, chairman of the finance
committee and Daniel Inouye of
Hawaii, the new secretary of the
Democratic conference, the third
highest position among the majority
Democrats in the senate.
Cranston was graduated from Stan
ford in 1936 and worked as a journalist
for International News Service (the
forerunner of United Press Interna
tional) in Ethiopia, Germany and Italy
in the late '30s, witnessing the rise of
European fascism. He was one of the
founders of the liberal California
Democratic Council (CDC) in 1953.
He was controller of the state of
California from 195H until 1966, when
he ran, unsuccessfully, in the U.S.
Senatorial primary. He ran again in
1968 and defeated Republican Max
Rafferty. He was reelected to the senate
in 1974 with a plurality senatorial
candidate and more votes than the 1.4
million votes nationwide that gave
Carter his presidential victory.

in 1974 with a plurality senatorial
candidate and more votes than the 1.4
million votes nationwide that gave
Carter his presidential victory.
Cranston captained the congres

their Republican rivals and won the
bicycling competition.
California Sen. Alan Cranston's
selection as majority whip this week, a
significant achievement for one who
has served only one term and two years
in the U.S. Senate, was well received
by fellow senators and political obser
vers.
Now the second highest ranking
Democrat in the senate after party
leader Sen. Robert Byrd of West Vir
ginia, Cranston, an alumnus here, was
called one of the senate's "premier
barometers" by Los Angeles Times
writer John Averill because of his abil
ity to accurately predict the outcome of
floor votes.
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), said,
"Cranston does his homework and re
ally lines thingsup. If people waver he
is there to firm them up. He lines up 25
to 30 per cent of the votes on most
legislation."
Sen. Dick Clark (D-lowa), said,
"Alan certainly knows how to or
ganize votes. He is the only one around
here who does."
"Nuts and bolts"
Cranston's press secretary Peggy
Cuthbertson attributed Cranston's in
fluence to his willingness to do the
"nuts and bolts" work on behalf of so
cial legislation that other liberals es
pouse.
Cuthbertson added that Cranston's
success can be attributed to his inde
fatigable work habits and ability to
work out compromises on legislation
in order to produce the best possible
result. The senator has made it a point
to co sponsor some legislation with
every member of the senate, both
Democrats and Republicans,
Cuthbertson said.
At a news conference in his senate
office Tuesday, Cranston said that his
election as assistant Democratic leader
"will enhance my opportunities to be
effective on behalf of California."
"You have more strength as whip
and I can do more as whip," com
mented the former Stanford English
major. "I will not let my new respon
sibilities interfere with the time I de
vote to California problems, con
stituents, and visits."
Cranston said that the most pressing
issue is the economy which he said is
"obviously, .a California issue as well
as a national issue because we have
such a high unemployment rate.
We've got to get people back to work.
We've got to give confidence to busi
ness, consumers and investors," he
said.
Keep senate machine going
While acknowledging the impor
tance of his responsibilities to his
California constituents and his com-
mitment to economic activism,
Cranston also said "My most impor
tant responsibility is to make the se
nate work well, to make it strong and to
preserve its independence. 1 will keep
right on pitching in very hard on is
sues that I'm concerned about and
generating support for the positions
that 1 believe are wise ones."
Cranston also said that he vigor
ously supports a stringent code of
ethics for the senate "that is observed
and enforced."
Cranston now makes about 18 return
trips to California each year and his
press secretary said Cranston sees no
reason why he cannot continue to
make that many visits to the state or at
least spend an equal amount of time
here by making his individual trips
longer.
Cuthbertson also said that Cranston
will try during this session to make the
procedural reforms necessary to
"speed up" votes after closure (a mo
tion to shut off further debate).
Cranston's duties as whip, said
Cuthbertson, will be "counting noses,
recruiting votes and making sure col
legues are present." He will not have
the latitude to choose which issues to
work on (as he did when he was infor
mally the assistant whip). He will have
to work on every issue
She said that Cranston expects to es
tablish a close working relationship
with Byrd whom he succeeded as
majority whip.
Cuthbertson said that Cranston has
established good relations with
President-elect Jimmy Carter and had

been invited down to Plains, Georgia
for a meeting to discuss legislative
strategy for the current congressional
session.
Other Democratic senators attend
ing the session were: Minnesota's
Hubert Humphrey, recently elected
deputy president pro tem of the senate;
Byrd; Edmund Muskie of Maine, head
of the budget committee; John McClel
lan of Arkansas, chairman of the ap
propriations committee; Louisiana's
Russell Long, chairman of the finance
committee and Daniel Inouye of
Hawaii, the new secretary of the
Democratic conference, the third
highest position among the majority
Democrats in the senate.
Cranston was graduated from Stan
ford in 1936 and worked as a journalist
for International News Service (the
forerunner of United Press Interna
tional) in Ethiopia, Germany and Italy
in the late '30s, witnessing the rise of
European fascism. He was one of the
founders of the liberal California
Democratic Council (CDC) in 1953.
He was controller of the state of
California from 195H until 1966, when
he ran, unsuccessfully, in the U.S.
Senatorial primary. He ran again in
1968 and defeated Republican Max
Rafferty. He was reelected to the senate
