# Nuclear exports threaten to spread arms race

"We will produce an atom bomb
even if we have to eat grass" —Pakis-
tani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, 1965.
The sentiment quoted above, which
is prevalent among many developing
nations, represents one of the greatest
dangers to world peace and freedom in
the coming years. Third world leaders
across the political spectrum, ranging
from the shah of Iran to South Korea's
Park Chung-hee, have expressed in
terest in obtaining nuclear reactors
and fuel reprocessing plants.
Holding minimal economic benefits
for these nations, the acquisition of
such technology clearly indicates a
desire to achieve a nuclear military
capability and subsequently to alter
the balance of power in their respec
tive regions.
In my last two columns I've discus
sed the dangers of nuclear weapons
and nuclear power. The prospect of
nuclear proliferation connects the two
questions, assuming both their dan
gers, while remaining bereft of their
alleged blessings. Therefore, even if
one advocates ICBMs or breeder reac
tors, s/he doesn't necessarily favor sel
ling reactors to third world countries.
The technical link between nuclear
energy and nuclear bombs can be sim
ply stated as follows: the toxic metal

plutonium is produced as a result of
the chain reaction within an atomic
reactor and remains in the spent fuel.
Each standard-size plant, as it gener
ates electricity, generates enough
plutonium to make one bomb every
two weeks. It is estimated that by 1990
3000 bombs will be produced annually
in less-developed countries alone.
Reprocessing
Extracting plutonium from spent
reactor fuel requires a reprocessing
plant. Small-scale reprocessing plants
can be built for $10 million to $5 mill
ion apiece. After being converted to its
purer form, the plutonium is then
ready to be used in nuclear warheads.
On May 18, 1974, the scenario de
scribed above moved out of the fic
tional realm and into reality when
India exploded a "peaceful" nuclear
device. With the help of an Americaa
firm and technicians trained in the Un
ited States the Indians built a small
reprocessing plant. Coupled with
spent fuel provided by a reactor
purchased from Canada, India used
the plant and joined the nuclear club.
The Indian explosion can be viewed
both as a culmination and an ominous
portent for the nations that are in the
nuclear export business. Since the
Atoms for Peace program of the '50s,
industrial nations, led by the United

States, have spread both nuclear
know-how and hardware.
Perhaps we never expected that
countries like India could one day
build a reprocessing plant; perhaps we
thought such nations would be drawn

under our influence if we gave them
the necessary technology. Whatever
the case, recent years have seen some
genuinely frightening developments
in the area of nuclear proliferation.
Negotiation
In 1975, West Germany concluded a
deal with Brazil which will give that
country 12 reactors, a uranium
enrichment plant and a small repro
cessing plant. France has negotiated
sales of reprocessing plants to Iran,
Pakistan and South Korea.
Finally, as a provision of the Sinai
Peace accord, the United States prom
ised to sell hoth Egypt and Israel nuc
lear reactors.
Why do we and our allies deal such
awesome machines to these unstable
nations? A West German official in a
nuclear company explains: "Wherever
we look — in Italy, Spain, Sweden,
Thailand, South Korea — the Ameri
cans have already been there. The
third world is the only open market
left."
While this opinion may be under
standable from a strictly corporate
point of view, it still lacks justification
from a world-wide political perspec
tive.
There can be only one result if the
hot spots of the world — Korea, India-
Pakistan, and the Middle East — are
further drowned in nuclear fuel. Not to
mention the prospects for terrorist
groups constructing home-made
bombs — a feasible development, re
quiring only the acquisition of
plutonium, either by theft or sale from
a friendly nation, e.g., Egypt to the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
Madness
What can be done to halt such mad
ness? A treaty on the nonproliferation
of nuclear weapons was negotiated by
the United States in 19fi8. Yet, it pro
vides only for inspection of reactors
with no enforcement capability should
a nation decide to divert plutonium to

military ends.
And how can the United States force
a nation like India to relinquish its re
processing plants, once that country
already has a stockpile — however tiny
— of bombs? The gift of reactors ulti
mately-leads to the probability of nuc
lear blackmail. For those of us who
are still optimistic about man's ability
to settle the problems of technology
with reason, an encouraging event oc
curred a few weeks ago. On Dec. 16 the
French government announced that,
"France does not intend to contribute
to the terrible threat of nuclear arms
proliferation," saying that it would
ban further exports of nuclear fuel re
processing plants.
The government indicated that it
would be "only too happy" if the deal
with Pakistan was called oft and that a
similar contract with South Korea has
been postponed.
France, however, will continue to
export power stations. In order to
guarantee that the recipient has no mo
tive to build reprocessing plants on his
own initiative, France also agreed to
deliver enriched fuel to its contrac
tors. . .
Proof
Unfortunately, the threat of prolif
eration will not vanish as long as the

West exports any phase of the nuclear
fuel cycle, as the Indian example has
proved. Ultimately, the question of
proliferation will rest on our decision
to become dependent on nuclear
power, specifically relying on the
breeder reactor. Currently three plants
are in various phases of construction,
each proving to be prohibitively ex
pensive.
Nevertheless, should the United
States lead the world to embrace the
plutonium economy upon which the
breeder depends, we will also have to
reconcile ourselves by 2000 to a world
where a diversion of one-thousandth
of one per cent of existent plutonium
would suffice to produce an A-bomb.
1 only hope that President Jimmy
Carter follows through on his cam
paign promises to curb all forms of
nuclear exports and most importantly,
to engage our nations efforts towards
coal, solar energy and conservation
instead of going the nuclear route.
To those leaders who concur with
Bhutto, whom 1 quoted at the begin
ning of this column, 1 can only say
"Bon a pet it!"

proliferation will rest on our decision

power, specifically relying on the

where a diversion of one-thousandth

"We will produce an atom bomb
even if we have to eat grass" —Pakis-
tani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, 1965.
The sentiment quoted above, which
is prevalent among many developing
nations, represents one of the greatest
dangers to world peace and freedom in
the coming years. Third world leaders
across the political spectrum, ranging
from the shah of Iran to South Korea's
Park Chung-hee, have expressed in
terest in obtaining nuclear reactors
and fuel reprocessing plants.
Holding minimal economic benefits
for these nations, the acquisition of
such technology clearly indicates a
desire to achieve a nuclear military
capability and subsequently to alter
the balance of power in their respec
tive regions.
In my last two columns I've discus
sed the dangers of nuclear weapons
and nuclear power. The prospect of
nuclear proliferation connects the two
questions, assuming both their dan
gers, while remaining bereft of their
alleged blessings. Therefore, even if
one advocates ICBMs or breeder reac
tors, s/he doesn't necessarily favor sel
ling reactors to third world countries.
The technical link between nuclear
energy and nuclear bombs can be sim
ply stated as follows: the toxic metal

plutonium is produced as a result of
the chain reaction within an atomic
reactor and remains in the spent fuel.
Each standard-size plant, as it gener
ates electricity, generates enough
plutonium to make one bomb every
two weeks. It is estimated that by 1990
3000 bombs will be produced annually
in less-developed countries alone.
Reprocessing
Extracting plutonium from spent
reactor fuel requires a reprocessing
plant. Small-scale reprocessing plants
can be built for $10 million to $5 mill
ion apiece. After being converted to its
purer form, the plutonium is then
ready to be used in nuclear warheads.
On May 18, 1974, the scenario de
scribed above moved out of the fic
tional realm and into reality when
India exploded a "peaceful" nuclear
device. With the help of an Americaa
firm and technicians trained in the Un
ited States the Indians built a small
reprocessing plant. Coupled with
spent fuel provided by a reactor
purchased from Canada, India used
the plant and joined the nuclear club.
The Indian explosion can be viewed
both as a culmination and an ominous
portent for the nations that are in the
nuclear export business. Since the
Atoms for Peace program of the '50s,
industrial nations, led by the United

States, have spread both nuclear
know-how and hardware.
Perhaps we never expected that
countries like India could one day
build a reprocessing plant; perhaps we
thought such nations would be drawn

under our influence if we gave them
the necessary technology. Whatever
the case, recent years have seen some
genuinely frightening developments
in the area of nuclear proliferation.
Negotiation
In 1975, West Germany concluded a
deal with Brazil which will give that
country 12 reactors, a uranium
enrichment plant and a small repro
cessing plant. France has negotiated
sales of reprocessing plants to Iran,
Pakistan and South Korea.
Finally, as a provision of the Sinai
Peace accord, the United States prom
ised to sell hoth Egypt and Israel nuc
lear reactors.
Why do we and our allies deal such
awesome machines to these unstable
nations? A West German official in a
nuclear company explains: "Wherever
we look — in Italy, Spain, Sweden,
Thailand, South Korea — the Ameri
cans have already been there. The
third world is the only open market
left."
While this opinion may be under
standable from a strictly corporate
point of view, it still lacks justification
from a world-wide political perspec
tive.
There can be only one result if the
hot spots of the world — Korea, India-
Pakistan, and the Middle East — are
further drowned in nuclear fuel. Not to
mention the prospects for terrorist
groups constructing home-made
bombs — a feasible development, re
quiring only the acquisition of
plutonium, either by theft or sale from
a friendly nation, e.g., Egypt to the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
Madness
What can be done to halt such mad
ness? A treaty on the nonproliferation
of nuclear weapons was negotiated by
the United States in 19fi8. Yet, it pro
vides only for inspection of reactors
with no enforcement capability should
a nation decide to divert plutonium to

military ends.
And how can the United States force
a nation like India to relinquish its re
processing plants, once that country
already has a stockpile — however tiny
— of bombs? The gift of reactors ulti
mately-leads to the probability of nuc
lear blackmail. For those of us who
are still optimistic about man's ability
to settle the problems of technology
with reason, an encouraging event oc
curred a few weeks ago. On Dec. 16 the
French government announced that,
"France does not intend to contribute
to the terrible threat of nuclear arms
proliferation," saying that it would
ban further exports of nuclear fuel re
processing plants.
The government indicated that it
would be "only too happy" if the deal
with Pakistan was called oft and that a
similar contract with South Korea has
been postponed.
France, however, will continue to
export power stations. In order to
guarantee that the recipient has no mo
tive to build reprocessing plants on his
own initiative, France also agreed to
deliver enriched fuel to its contrac
tors. . .
Proof
Unfortunately, the threat of prolif
eration will not vanish as long as the

West exports any phase of the nuclear
fuel cycle, as the Indian example has
proved. Ultimately, the question of
proliferation will rest on our decision
to become dependent on nuclear

processing plants, once that country
already has a stockpile — however tiny
— of bombs? The gift of reactors ulti
mately-leads to the probability of nuc
lear blackmail. For those of us who
are still optimistic about man's ability
to settle the problems of technology
with reason, an encouraging event oc
curred a few weeks ago. On Dec. 16 the
French government announced that,
"France does not intend to contribute
to the terrible threat of nuclear arms
proliferation," saying that it would
ban further exports of nuclear fuel re
processing plants.
The government indicated that it
would be "only too happy" if the deal
with Pakistan was called oft and that a
similar contract with South Korea has
been postponed.
France, however, will continue to
export power stations. In order to
guarantee that the recipient has no mo
tive to build reprocessing plants on his
own initiative, France also agreed to
deliver enriched fuel to its contrac
tors. . .
Proof
Unfortunately, the threat of prolif
eration will not vanish as long as the

West exports any phase of the nuclear
fuel cycle, as the Indian example has
proved. Ultimately, the question of
proliferation will rest on our decision
to become dependent on nuclear
power, specifically relying on the
breeder reactor. Currently three plants
are in various phases of construction,
each proving to be prohibitively ex
pensive.
Nevertheless, should the United
States lead the world to embrace the
plutonium economy upon which the
breeder depends, we will also have to
reconcile ourselves by 2000 to a world
where a diversion of one-thousandth
of one per cent of existent plutonium
would suffice to produce an A-bomb.
1 only hope that President Jimmy
Carter follows through on his cam
paign promises to curb all forms of
nuclear exports and most importantly,
to engage our nations efforts towards
coal, solar energy and conservation
instead of going the nuclear route.

"We will produce an atom bomb
even if we have to eat grass" —Pakis-
tani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, 1965.
The sentiment quoted above, which
is prevalent among many developing
nations, represents one of the greatest
dangers to world peace and freedom in
the coming years. Third world leaders
across the political spectrum, ranging
from the shah of Iran to South Korea's
Park Chung-hee, have expressed in
terest in obtaining nuclear reactors
and fuel reprocessing plants.
Holding minimal economic benefits
for these nations, the acquisition of
such technology clearly indicates a
desire to achieve a nuclear military
capability and subsequently to alter
the balance of power in their respec
tive regions.
In my last two columns I've discus
sed the dangers of nuclear weapons
and nuclear power. The prospect of
nuclear proliferation connects the two
questions, assuming both their dan
gers, while remaining bereft of their
alleged blessings. Therefore, even if
one advocates ICBMs or breeder reac
tors, s/he doesn't necessarily favor sel
ling reactors to third world countries.
The technical link between nuclear
energy and nuclear bombs can be sim
ply stated as follows: the toxic metal

plutonium is produced as a result of
the chain reaction within an atomic
reactor and remains in the spent fuel.
Each standard-size plant, as it gener
ates electricity, generates enough
plutonium to make one bomb every
two weeks. It is estimated that by 1990
3000 bombs will be produced annually
in less-developed countries alone.
Reprocessing
Extracting plutonium from spent
reactor fuel requires a reprocessing
plant. Small-scale reprocessing plants
can be built for $10 million to $5 mill
ion apiece. After being converted to its
purer form, the plutonium is then
ready to be used in nuclear warheads.
On May 18, 1974, the scenario de
scribed above moved out of the fic
tional realm and into reality when
India exploded a "peaceful" nuclear
device. With the help of an Americaa
firm and technicians trained in the Un
ited States the Indians built a small
reprocessing plant. Coupled with
spent fuel provided by a reactor
purchased from Canada, India used
the plant and joined the nuclear club.
The Indian explosion can be viewed
both as a culmination and an ominous
portent for the nations that are in the
nuclear export business. Since the
Atoms for Peace program of the '50s,
industrial nations, led by the United

States, have spread both nuclear
know-how and hardware.
Perhaps we never expected that
countries like India could one day
build a reprocessing plant; perhaps we
thought such nations would be drawn

under our influence if we gave them
the necessary technology. Whatever
the case, recent years have seen some
genuinely frightening developments
in the area of nuclear proliferation.
Negotiation
In 1975, West Germany concluded a
deal with Brazil which will give that
country 12 reactors, a uranium
enrichment plant and a small repro
cessing plant. France has negotiated
sales of reprocessing plants to Iran,
Pakistan and South Korea.
Finally, as a provision of the Sinai
Peace accord, the United States prom
ised to sell hoth Egypt and Israel nuc
lear reactors.
Why do we and our allies deal such
awesome machines to these unstable
nations? A West German official in a
nuclear company explains: "Wherever
we look — in Italy, Spain, Sweden,
Thailand, South Korea — the Ameri
cans have already been there. The
third world is the only open market
left."
While this opinion may be under
standable from a strictly corporate
point of view, it still lacks justification
from a world-wide political perspec
tive.
There can be only one result if the
hot spots of the world — Korea, India-
Pakistan, and the Middle East — are
further drowned in nuclear fuel. Not to
mention the prospects for terrorist
groups constructing home-made
bombs — a feasible development, re
quiring only the acquisition of
plutonium, either by theft or sale from
a friendly nation, e.g., Egypt to the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
Madness
What can be done to halt such mad
ness? A treaty on the nonproliferation
of nuclear weapons was negotiated by
the United States in 19fi8. Yet, it pro
vides only for inspection of reactors
with no enforcement capability should
a nation decide to divert plutonium to

military ends.
And how can the United States force
a nation like India to relinquish its re
processing plants, once that country
already has a stockpile — however tiny
— of bombs? The gift of reactors ulti
