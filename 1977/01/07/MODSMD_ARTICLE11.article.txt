# Let them stay past 65

In reviewing that portion of Stanford
University policy regarding affirma
tive action, in which Stanford is com
mitted to equal opportunity for all
employes and applicants for employ
ment. regardless of race, color, creed,
religion, national origin, age or sex, I
find a very troubling paradox.
In my past seven years at Stanford, 1
have known a large number of univer
sity libraries staff members who have
been forced to retire because of having
attained the age of 65. In many cases,
these people have been extremely pro
ductive and valuable members of the
staff.
Most have made a unique contribu
tion to the overall services of the lib
raries. in that they performed their jobs
for many years. No doubt most of them
possess considerable knowledge of de
tails and techniques which are now
lost to the libraries, particularly since
most openings are filled at some later

date after the departure of the incum
bents.
Everywhere around us we see evi
dence of the fitness of individuals in
later age. Better health care and in
creased knowledge of nutrition have
contributed to man's longevity, which
has been increasing with each year.
Many of the older people have much to
offer; years of experience, special
knowledge and a good mixture of vary
ing points of view.
Most still function both mentally
and physically in such a way as to be a
definite asset to their employers, yet at
Stanford they are required to retire at
age 65.
Because of galloping inflation, in
adequate Social Security pensions and
sometimes meager retirement pen
sions from Stanford, some of these
forced retirees will have great diffi
culty in making ends meet. Some will
be forced to move in with relatives or

strangers, after years of independence
and privacy.
Some of the widows, widowers and
divorcees who for years have pre
vented pangs of loneliness by report
ing regularly to jobs will now be at
loose ends; they will suffer from feel
ings of uselessness, as well as face
worries over finances. Jobs for seniors
can be very difficult to find and may
not be rewarding and stimulating.
Why, then, if Stanford University is
really committed to no discrimination
because of age, must the mandatory
retirement age of 65 remain in effect?
We owe much more than small pen
sions to these loyal, useful workers.
Continuing jobs to healthy people past
the age of 65 is logical and is good
business.
