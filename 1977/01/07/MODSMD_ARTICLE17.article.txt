# Opposition to death penalty earns praise for Brown
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — Lawmak
ers on both sides of the fence said
yesterday that Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr.'s public stand against
the death penalty was "gutsy"
and required "tremendous cour
age."
The Democratic governor said
in his State of the State address
to the legislature that he would
veto any bill to restore the death
penalty in California. The state
Supreme Court last month threw
out California's 1974 capital
punishment law as unconstitu
tional.
The law was passed following
an overwhelming public vote in
favor of the death penalty in
1972.
Some legislators said that it
would be difficult — possibly
impossible — to override a veto.
After the speech, reporters
pursued Brown to his office.
"Will this hurt you politically?"
one of them asked.
The 38-year-old governor,
who stood outside San Quentin
Prison in protest when the last
execution took place 10 years
ago, shrugged and said:
"It's what 1 believe. It's a mat
ter of conscience."
Assembly Speaker Leo McCar
thy, a death penalty foe, said:
"Knowing full well that the

majority of the public is in favor
of the death penalty, the state
ment he just made was one of
tremendous courage."
McCarthy said he supports
Brown's proposal for life in
prison without parole for capital
crimes, but he would not predict
what the legislature would do.
Assemblyman Ken Maddy
(R-Fresno), chairman of the As
sembly Criminal Justice Com
mittee, said:
"I think it's going to hamper
the efforts of the legislature and
give impetus to initiatives
which are the wrong way to
legislate. I think it was ill
advised and contrary to the best
interests and the will of the
people of this state as expressed
in 1972."
Maddy predicted the legisla
ture would send Brown a death
penalty bill, and he said he is
starting hearings January 24 on
bills already introduced for a
new death penalty law.
Eugene Chappie of Roseville,
GOP caucus chairman in the As
sembly, said:
"I think he dug himself a big
political hole. But I have to give

him credit. He came out front.
The guy has a lot of guts." He'
also predicted there will be &
death penalty passed.
Sen. John Briggs (R-
Fullerton), said: ,
"It was smart to get it out in the
open. You don't want any politi-<
cal skeletons in the closet. The
issue could well disappear by
the election. Hut it's a ready
made issue for Chief Davis. It
was pretty gutsy."
Los Angeles Police Chief Ed
Davis is a prospective Republi
can gubernatorial candidate in
1978. Brown has not yet de
clared he will seek a second
term.
Assemblyman Alan Sieroty
(D-Los Angeles), who is a death
penalty foe, said:
"1 think it is a very courageous
act. He is a man of conscience
and conviction. 1 think that
people have to respect him for
his courageous act."
He also said there are enough
anti-death penalty votes in the
Assembly to turn down an over
ride attempt. Brown's action was
not politically fatal, Sieroty ad
ded.

legislate. I think it was ill
advised and contrary to the best
interests and the will of the
people of this state as expressed
in 1972."
Maddy predicted the legisla
ture would send Brown a death
penalty bill, and he said he is
starting hearings January 24 on
bills already introduced for a
new death penalty law.
Eugene Chappie of Roseville,
GOP caucus chairman in the As
sembly, said:
"I think he dug himself a big
political hole. But I have to give

him credit. He came out front.
The guy has a lot of guts." He'
also predicted there will be &
death penalty passed.
Sen. John Briggs (R-
Fullerton), said: ,
"It was smart to get it out in the
open. You don't want any politi-<
cal skeletons in the closet. The
issue could well disappear by
the election. Hut it's a ready
made issue for Chief Davis. It
was pretty gutsy."
Los Angeles Police Chief Ed
Davis is a prospective Republi
can gubernatorial candidate in
1978. Brown has not yet de
clared he will seek a second
term.
Assemblyman Alan Sieroty
(D-Los Angeles), who is a death
penalty foe, said:
"1 think it is a very courageous
act. He is a man of conscience
and conviction. 1 think that
people have to respect him for
his courageous act."
He also said there are enough
anti-death penalty votes in the
Assembly to turn down an over
ride attempt. Brown's action was
not politically fatal, Sieroty ad
ded.
Sacramento (AP) — Lawmak
ers on both sides of the fence said
yesterday that Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr.'s public stand against
the death penalty was "gutsy"
and required "tremendous cour
age."
The Democratic governor said
in his State of the State address
to the legislature that he would
veto any bill to restore the death
penalty in California. The state
Supreme Court last month threw
out California's 1974 capital
punishment law as unconstitu
tional.
The law was passed following
an overwhelming public vote in
favor of the death penalty in
1972.
Some legislators said that it
would be difficult — possibly
impossible — to override a veto.
After the speech, reporters
pursued Brown to his office.
"Will this hurt you politically?"
one of them asked.
The 38-year-old governor,
who stood outside San Quentin
Prison in protest when the last
execution took place 10 years
ago, shrugged and said:
"It's what 1 believe. It's a mat
ter of conscience."
Assembly Speaker Leo McCar
thy, a death penalty foe, said:
"Knowing full well that the

majority of the public is in favor
of the death penalty, the state
ment he just made was one of
tremendous courage."
McCarthy said he supports
Brown's proposal for life in
prison without parole for capital
crimes, but he would not predict
what the legislature would do.
Assemblyman Ken Maddy
(R-Fresno), chairman of the As
sembly Criminal Justice Com
mittee, said:
"I think it's going to hamper
the efforts of the legislature and
give impetus to initiatives
which are the wrong way to
legislate. I think it was ill
advised and contrary to the best
interests and the will of the
people of this state as expressed
in 1972."
