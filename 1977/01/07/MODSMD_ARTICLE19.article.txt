# Sequel not as good as original
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
Dirty Harry Calahan's back,
laying a path oi destruction from
the Hay Bridge to Golden
Gate Park. In his third film ap
pearance, Harry is The Enforcer.
He alone enforces the law when
his bleeding-heart liberal
superiors are ready to coddle
criminals even at the risk of los
ing law-abiding citizens' lives.
Harry's never subscribed to
that philosophy. When he plays
the game, he plays il rough. Dur
ing the course of The Enforcer,

he drives through storefront
windows, hijacks fire boats, and
literally blows away terrorists.
The terrorists he seeks are not
run-of-the-mill terrorists, mur
dering for the sake of social rele-
Viii.ce. hey only desire money.
To fultill their desire they kid
nap the mayor of San Francisco,
who actually deserves to get
kidnapped, and hold him for five
million dollars, which will buy a
lot of accessories the smart ter
rorist is never without.
As might be expected, Harry

does his job as he sees it. His
Superiors, Bradford Dillman and
Harry Guardino, do their jobs as
they see them and try to suppress
Harry's rights by making him do
his job as they see it. Apparently
they've too quickly forgotten
that Harry blew up his last
superior (Hal Holbrook in Mag
num Force) when he got too up-
I As their views are often, if not
always, divergent, Harry and his
superiors get in each other's way
a lot, especially when they as

sign a female inspector with lit
tle or no experience on the street
to be Harry's partner. Finally
Harry is forced to take the law
into his own hands to see justice
done. This is what we've al 1 been
waiting for.
Magnum Force was such a
brilliant sequel to Dirty Harry
that to surpass or even equal it
with a second sequel becomes a
next-to-impossible task. The
plot of Magnum Force hinged so
well on Harry's personality that
the enjoyment was amplified.
So, as might be expected, The
Enforcer is not as great a sequel
as Magnum Force. Not to say that
it's a bad movie—it's not. It's ev
erything Dirty Harry should be.
Of course, it doesn't show San
Francisco in a very flattering
light, what with terrorists, porno
film makers and an all but in
competent government, but
that's not all the film's fault.
Negative images don't just pop
up out of nowhere —they're
based on fact.
It's just that The Enforcer is
not a progression. Few sequels
are. The characters are so well
fleshed out, so vivid, that The
Enforcer could have been the
original Dirty Harry. I suppose
I'm asking too much. Once
you've made the perfect sequel,
there's no place to go but down.
The Enforcer is furious, often
funny, and at the end, sadly
ironic. It has the proper quota of
violence (if that's what you're
looking for), and Glint Eastwood
is still the archetypal supercool
supercop. Tyne Dayly as his
partner is a spritely, dedicated
policewoman and an attractive,
talented actress. Considering the
film as a whole and its current
competition you could do a
whole lot worse.
(The Enforcer, along with
Silver Streak, is now at the Old
Mill Six ,n Mountain View.)

Magnum Force was such a
brilliant sequel to Dirty Harry
that to surpass or even equal it
with a second sequel becomes a
next-to-impossible task. The
plot of Magnum Force hinged so
well on Harry's personality that
the enjoyment was amplified.
So, as might be expected, The
Enforcer is not as great a sequel
as Magnum Force. Not to say that
it's a bad movie—it's not. It's ev
erything Dirty Harry should be.
Of course, it doesn't show San
Francisco in a very flattering
light, what with terrorists, porno
film makers and an all but in
competent government, but
that's not all the film's fault.
Negative images don't just pop
up out of nowhere —they're
based on fact.
It's just that The Enforcer is
not a progression. Few sequels
are. The characters are so well
fleshed out, so vivid, that The
Enforcer could have been the
original Dirty Harry. I suppose
I'm asking too much. Once
you've made the perfect sequel,
there's no place to go but down.
The Enforcer is furious, often
funny, and at the end, sadly
ironic. It has the proper quota of
violence (if that's what you're
looking for), and Glint Eastwood
is still the archetypal supercool
supercop. Tyne Dayly as his
partner is a spritely, dedicated
policewoman and an attractive,
talented actress. Considering the
film as a whole and its current
competition you could do a
whole lot worse.
