# China press clears Teng

### 
Hong Kong (AP) — The Chinese
press has halted its drive to discredit
former Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping,
indicating the moderate leader may be
in line for a second spectacular politi
cal comeback.
Peking wall posters were reported
yesterday calling Teng "comrade"
again and describing him as a victim of
the now-disgraced radical clique led
by Mao Tse-tung's widow.
After more than a week of no
Chinese press criticism of the 72-
year-old Teng, protege of the late Pre
mier Chou En-lai, the Japanese news
paper Ashai said wall posters de
manded the truth about his overthrow.
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug
also reported the posters called Teng
"comrade" for the first time since he
was toppled last April.
The change in the anti-Teng cam
paign suggested he may be on the way
to another dramatic rehabilitation. He
was purged once before, also by the
radicals, during the tumultuous cul
tural revolution of the 19605, but was
restored to power in 1973 by Chou,
who groomed him to be his successor
as premier.
Chou died one year ago tomorrow,
and China's new leaders, headed by
Communist party chief Hua Kuo-feng,
apparently are trying to identify them
selves with his moderate policies.
The Peking leaders were engaged in
a major campaign to honor Chou on
the first anniversary of his death. The
official Hsinhua news agency yester
day reported publication of 19 songs
for the occasion and described Chou as

a man "whom the people throughout
China love dearly."
At the same time Hsinhua and the
key party newspaper People's Daily
claimed the new leaders had the coun
try under control following arrest of
Mao's widow, Chiang Ching, and her
radical colleagues, dubbed the "gang
of four."
In claiming control, they acknow

ledged there has been violence, armed
struggle and work sabotage in many
parts of China but said the trouble took
place before the arrest of Chiang Ching
and her radical associates.
Confirmation of the violence indi
cated the leaders are disturbed by
widespread reports giving the impres
sion of continuing violence three
months after the arrest of the radicals.
