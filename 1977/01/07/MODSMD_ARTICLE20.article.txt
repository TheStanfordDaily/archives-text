# Gallery offers African sculpture
## 
### Katherine Draznin 
The exhibit of African
sculpture currently at the Stan
lord Gallery will dispel any no
tions that African art is simply a
lot of primitive and exaggerated
whittling. The well documented
show concentrates on works
from the countries of Nigeria,
'Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Liberia,
'and Guinea, as wel 1 as one or two
'examples' from the inland areas.
Contrary to popular western
concepts, African sculptors
spend as many as 15 years as ap
prentices, and works are dis
tinctly identifiableas the work of
a specific artist. During the early
20th century, many European ar
tists, led by Picasso and Braque,
studied and emulated African
sculpture for its "anonymity,
primitivism, and concep
tualism." They felt African
sculpture presented a concep

tual man, outside of time and
.Tpace. However, their theories
do not hold up under the
scrutiny of recent scholars.
One of the most remarkable
examples of skill in this exhibit
was the Yoruba (Nigeria) Divin
ing cup in the shape of a women
with a basket and cock. This
ritual cup was used in cere
monies of Moslem origin intro
duced in the 18th century. The
intricate geometric incisions
contradict any theories of
primitivism or arbitrariness in
the work.
Many of the works on display
are masks, illustrating the true
nature of most African
sculpture—as religious or ritual
objects. The striking Gelede
mask of the Yoruba tribe would
be seen only at prescribed festi
vals because masks were consi
dered power objects. Masks

would be kept hidden for fear
that their enormous power
Would rigidify the viewer, and
give him more power over
others. The use of wood and less
permanent materials such as
grass or animal skins highlights
the concept that ancestor figures
(usually vertical to show their
"grown-upness") were to gradu
ally disappear or lose power.
However, the images of kings or
rulers were made in stone or
more permanent material be
cause a power holder's image
"was kept at the forefront of the
society.
One unfortunate aspect of this
display was the use of pristine
white walls as backdrops for the
masks. Although it provided a
Itidiness to the display, the walls
detracted trom one essential
characteristic of most of the
masks—they were designed and
painted to be worn as camouf
lage. Unless one sees the mask
on a person in appropriate cos

tume and body paint, it is dif
ficult to conceive of its function.
Despite this drawback, the
exhibit provides a number of
works which can be appreciated
on their own merits. The Bam
bara antelope headpiece from
Mali shows why these works are
"favorites" among American
and European collectors. The
example on display shows a
rhythmic execution. The stocky
stylized body is offset by an
elegant sweeping crescent neck
that supports latticework de
signs and an elongated face. The
head is surmounted by spiral
horns nearly two feet in length.
A Fang (Cameroon and Gabon)
Pangwe mask indicates the deli
cate, almost classical beauty
achieved by African artists.
The Gallery has provided an
excellent introductory display of
an art form relatively unknown
and frequently misunderstood
by westerners. The display con
tinues through February 27.
