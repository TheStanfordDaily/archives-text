## Despite the philosophy... 'Blue': language as art 
### 
On Being Blue, A Philosophical Investigation; by
William Gass; David Godine; $10.
Reviewed by James Laffan
A poet drunk with language is in many respects
like other obstreperous drunkards. Depending
upon his temperment he may be witty and
loquacious. If truly sunk in his cups he may even
be profound, though at that level of intoxication,
thought tends to be more evocative than analyti
cal, a freely associative montage of philosophical
fragments, interesting stories, quotes and other
diversions strung together to approximate sober
coherence. Though little in the way of sound con
clusions results from such sessions one can, de
pending on the company one chooses, come away
from the encounter satisfied in its small details, a
nice distinction or a clever image.
William Gass, a novelist and critic as well as
professor of philosophy is one such drunkard,
euphoric and a touch besotted with the rich asso
nances of the language. Despite what other pur
poses its portentous title might suggest, On Being
Blue, A Philosophical Investigation is an ani
mated, largely uncharted attempt to fit within
covers the kaleidescopic variety and plush sensu
ality of the written word.
It also, as an apparently peripheral matter, is a
discussion of the amazingly diverse uses of the
word color and concept blue, principally as it
relates to the erotic in literature. Because it has
jocularly proclaimed itself to be philosophical, it
now sits on bookstore shelves rubbing thighs with
Fourier and Hegel.
It may be unkind to argue that it belongs
elsewhere. Gass does after all have a point, be it an
obvious one; that literature is not so much depic
tive as suggestive and that the beauty of its images
is steeped in, and a part of, the imagery from
whence they spring.
But the book is an explanation swallowed by its
illustration. Anyone setting out to draw nice
theoretical distinctions thus: "So I shall, keeping
one (peppermint) in each of my four pockets
while one is in my mouth, describe five methods
by which sex gains an entrance into literature...as
through French doors and jimmied windows
thieves break in upon our dreams to rape our
women and steal our power t0015..." is far too
much the sensual ist to quit the world of stinks and
sighs and deal as a critic in its abstracted values.
It is a fact for which may all be thankful, for it
makes what could be a disastrously vapid dis
cussion of literature's perfumed carnality into an

ingenious essay every bit as moist, warm and
sticky as its subject.
There is, for example, a fine fleeting treatment
of the implausable sexual imagery in the Song of
Solomon, Gass smiling upon the herdsman whose
love has a bosom like young roes, teeth like un
dipped sheep and tresses like unto a comely flock
of goats. Or his observation that "One may decide
that the nipple most nearly resembles a newly
ripened raspbery (never, be it noted, the plonk of
suction principle, gum bubble, mole or birth wart,
bumpy metal button, or the painful red eruption
of a swelling) but does one care to see his breakfast
fruit as a sweetened milky bowl of snipped nips?
no."
Sometimes, Gass does does fall prey to tedium
and sheer goofiness. A chapter given over to a
straight faced discussion of what one means when
one suggests that another go commit an atrocity
upon a duck is, alas neither interesting nor par
ticularly illuminating.
Other times, however, one clear image can
make a whole thought beautifully alive: "Chil
dren collect nouns, bugs, bottlecaps, seashells,
verbs and with the greed which rushes through
them like rain down gulleys...the prepositions of
belonging and the pronouns of possession." or
"Poverty and isolation produce impoverished
and isolated minds, small vocabularies, a real but
fickle passion for slang, most of which is like the
stuff which Woolworths sells for ashtrays, words
swung at random, wildly as though one were
clubbing rats..."
Beneath all this runs a steadygoing stream of
blueness, providing a pretext for writing long
after ceasing to be its real subject. Under cover of
blue one may introduce Henry Miller's descrip
tion of the vagina having the upholstery of a Vic
torian sleeping car, a digression on Berkeley's
theory of perception, a vain attempt to reconcile
Plato and Aristotle and the full text of a vaudeville
skit brimming with sexual innuendo.
Where all this ends, having no perceptible
shape or direction, is largely at the discretion of
the author and Gass does close tidily before in
terest plays out. As a raconteur of dirty stories, as a
wit, Gass is at his best. He is less winning as an
empirical theorist, arguing other people's
theories only half in earnest, with an eye out for
the clever remark leading to a fast getaway. Still
the book is engaging and articulate. For being
exiled to the philosophy section it may yet have a
salutory effect on its dour bunkmates.
