# Consumer service begins
## 
### Kevin Ohlson 
How many times in your life
have you been ripped off? Maybe
it's easier to remember the times
you haven't been cheated—
because there aren't as many of
them. Perhaps you have been
treated well by a local merchant,
and want others in the Stanford
Community to know there are
still a few honest businessmen
left in the world.
Until a few weeks ago, there

wasn't a central clearing center
on campus for consumer infor
mation. Now, there is the Stan
ford Consumer Services Center
(or, in Farm slang, SCSC). David
Brown, with the help of the
Alumni Association's Pierce
Memorial Award, has brought
this organization into existence.
"I first became interested in
consumerism when I saw how
people, expecially women, were
getting 'taken* in the Bay Area,"
says Brown, a graduate student
in Earth Sciences.
"With the SCSC, 1 want to set
up an information and referral
service, and compile a directory
of local businesses. As a student
deals with a merchant, we would
like them to fill out a card—
anonymously — indicating
whether it was a good or a bad
transaction. So when someone
wants to buy merchandise or
services, we can send them to a
creditable firm."
"When somebody gets
ripped-off, we'll be able to ad
vise them as to what course of
action to pursue."
Though Brown claims he has
been consumer-oriented for over
ten years, he has only been a
member of the Palo Alto chapter

of Consumer United for a year.
He is fairly active within this or
ganization, and contributes to
"Consumer's Corner," a column
in local newspapers. He draws
upon the feedback from the col
umn, as well as his personal ex
perience to write consumer bul
letins. Examples of these bulle
tins include "Steps to Follow
When You Rent a Home or
Apartment," and "Hints on Car
Buying."
Initially, Brown plans to com
bine the SCSC with the informa
tional resources of Consumers
United. But in order to tailor the
service to the needs of the Stan
ford Community, he hopes to get
students involved in research
projects in consumerism in the
surrounding area.
"One problem is that we're
very understaffed," says Brown.
"We'll be getting an office soon,
in the Old Firehouse, and Fve
got the money from the Fierce
Award, but without volunteers
nothing will happen."
Students interested should

tins include "Steps to Follow
When You Rent a Home or
Apartment," and "Hints on Car
Buying."
Initially, Brown plans to com
bine the SCSC with the informa
tional resources of Consumers
United. But in order to tailor the
service to the needs of the Stan
ford Community, he hopes to get
students involved in research
projects in consumerism in the
surrounding area.
"One problem is that we're
very understaffed," says Brown.
"We'll be getting an office soon,
in the Old Firehouse, and Fve
got the money from the Fierce
Award, but without volunteers
nothing will happen."
Students interested should
contact David Brown, care of the
Stanford Consumer Service
Center, Box 9565, Stanford, CA

How many times in your life
have you been ripped off? Maybe
it's easier to remember the times
you haven't been cheated—
because there aren't as many of
them. Perhaps you have been
treated well by a local merchant,
and want others in the Stanford
Community to know there are
still a few honest businessmen
left in the world.
Until a few weeks ago, there

wasn't a central clearing center
on campus for consumer infor
mation. Now, there is the Stan
ford Consumer Services Center
(or, in Farm slang, SCSC). David
Brown, with the help of the
Alumni Association's Pierce
Memorial Award, has brought
this organization into existence.
"I first became interested in
consumerism when I saw how
people, expecially women, were
getting 'taken* in the Bay Area,"
says Brown, a graduate student
in Earth Sciences.
"With the SCSC, 1 want to set
up an information and referral
service, and compile a directory
of local businesses. As a student
deals with a merchant, we would
like them to fill out a card—
anonymously — indicating
whether it was a good or a bad
transaction. So when someone
wants to buy merchandise or
services, we can send them to a
creditable firm."
"When somebody gets
ripped-off, we'll be able to ad
vise them as to what course of
action to pursue."
Though Brown claims he has
been consumer-oriented for over
ten years, he has only been a
member of the Palo Alto chapter

of Consumer United for a year.
He is fairly active within this or
ganization, and contributes to
"Consumer's Corner," a column
in local newspapers. He draws
upon the feedback from the col
umn, as well as his personal ex
perience to write consumer bul
letins. Examples of these bulle
tins include "Steps to Follow
When You Rent a Home or
Apartment," and "Hints on Car
Buying."
