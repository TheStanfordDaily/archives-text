## Swimmers travel to Cal for weekend invitational 
### 
Back from Hawaii where dur
ing Christmas vacation the men
claimed the Aulea Invitational
Championship and the women,
minus six or seven team mem
bers, finished third in the same
meet, the Cardinal swimming
teams compete for the first time
of the new year today and tomor
row in the University of Califor
nia Invitational.
The meet begins at 2 p.m.
today and 9 a.m. tomorrow in
Cal's Harmon Fool.
Coaches Jim Caughran and
Debbie Meyer both indicated the
meet will serve primarily as a
tool to measure effects of their
current training regimen.
Caughran said the meet will
probably not produce any great
times but will function as a
"time trial meet where we can
gauge our progress."
Meyer said the meet will be
useful in evaluating the helpful
ness of the Hawaiian training.
For the women, the Invita
tional will amount to a tri-meet
with lIOF and Cal. The men will
face teams from Cal, IJOF. Hay
ward State and San Francisco
State.
The host Colden Bears, led by
1076 Olympic double-silver
medalist Peter Rocca. feature an
impressive crop freshmen,
Caughran said. The prize Cal re

cruit is Canadian Olympian
Graham Smith, the No. 3
breaststroker in the world.
Another formidable name
among the Cal freshmen belongs
to a backstroker and individual
medley specialist, Jim Carter.
(Who cares if he can swim, the
question is: Can he raise
peanuts?)
The meet may prove to be an

interesting preview of the Cal-
Stanford dual February 19 — a
meet which Gaughran promises
will feature "very keen" compet
ition.
In more than a half century of
competition Cal has never up
ended the Cards in a dual meet.
The Bears are no doubt itching to
shed this dubious distinction.
