# WSU outshoots Stanford
## Cougars prey on Cardinals 
### David Georgette 
The Washington State
Cougars combined 25 points by
Harold Rhodes with some key
free throws in the last two mi
nutes to hold oft the Stanford
Cardinals, 80-68, in the Pacific-8
opener for both teams at the Per
forming Arts Center in Pullman,
Washington last night.
The Cougars, 10-2 in non
conference play, scored eight
straight points, mostly on fast
breaks, at the outset of the sec
ond half to break a 37-37 tie. The
Cards never closed to iess than
four points the remainder of the
game.
Trailing 72-67 with 3:05 to
play, the Cards missed field goal
attempts and free throws and
scored only one more point
down the stretch on a free throw
by freshman Kimberly Belton
with 2:03 left.
Hey, big brother
Meanwhile, Cougar senior
guard Marty Ciovacchini,

brother of Stanford's Paul
Giovacchini, hit five of six free
throws when the Cards chose to
foul in attempts to get the ball
back.
When the Cougars did miss
their shots in the final minutes,
postman Steve Puidokas came
up with some key offensive re
bounds.
The Cards took their first lead
of the ball game, 33-31, at
halftime on the strength of five
straight points by Belton, who
chalked up 13 in the first stanza.
The Cougars were ahead of the
Cards 16-8 with 8:30 gone in the
game.
Bratz lets loose
After the half, freshman Stuart
House limited Belton to just two
points. Senior guard Mike Bratz
took over the scoring chores for
the Cards, though, recording all
but two of his 18 points in the
second half.
Rhodes, however, did not
limit his scoring to one half. Av

eraging 17 points a game so far,
he scored 10 early points to put
the Cougars out in front, and
throughout the game plagued
the Cards' zone defense with his
outside jumpers.
Missed free throws
Stanford's second half free
throwing did not help them
much as they netted only 11 of
20 from the charity strip.
Marty Ciovacchini, the
Cougars' floor leader, paced
WSU with seven assists. The
Cougars blocked seven shots,
four of which were House's ef
forts.
Stanford's effort was ham
pered by a leg injury to Jay Carter
which he sustained in the first
half. Carter continued to play,
but the injury limited his effec
tiveness the remainder of the
game.
The Cards travel to Seattle
today to prepare for their game
against the Washington Huskies
on Saturday which begins at 4
p.m.
Live coverage
The game will be televised
live over Channel 4 and carried
on radio by KZSU (90.1 FM). The
Huskies defeated California last
night 85-75.
Marv Harshman's Huskies
were 8-4 in non-conference ac
tion. Washington is riding a hot
streak now, winning its last nine
games after having opened with
four losses. The Huskies' last de
feat came on December 4, 83-81
to Duke.
Last week the Huskies won the
Cabrillo Classic in San Diego,
defeating Texas-El Paso 54-49,
and LaSalle, 114-94.
8.M.0.C.
The Huskies' scoring leader,
seven-foot center James Ed
wards, is averaging 18.8 points
and 10.0 rebounds per game so
far this season. He was voted the
most valuable player in the Cab
rillo Classic. Edwards has hit on
55.2 per cent from the floor and
has blocked 20 shots.
Junior forward Kim Stewart,
who scored 34 points in the two
games, and senior guard Chester
Dorsey, who had a season-high
21 points against LaSalle. made

the All-tournament team in San
Diego.
Stewart is the leading assist
man for the Huskies with 51,
while Dorsey tops Washington
in steals with 26.
Hungry Huskies
The other starting forward for
Harshman is 6-5 freshman Stan
Walker. Starting in the
backcourt with Dorsey is
sophomore Mike Neill. Last year
in the Cards' second conference
game, Neill's left-handed set
shots from way outside made the
difference in Washington's
H7-81 victory at Maples Pavilion.
It has been four years since
Stanford won in Seattle, and
Harshman does not underesti
mate Washington's homecourt
advantage.
"1 certainly would rather open
at home against California and
Stanford than travel to LO9,
Angeles, Oregon or anywhere."
he said recently.
The Cards record, though
gives Harshman cause to worry;
"Stanford, along with Oregon,
have been the early-season sur
prises in the league. Stanford has
great guards, particularly Bratz. v
They have been getting consis
tent play from their inside
players as well." -■

When the Cougars did miss
their shots in the final minutes,
postman Steve Puidokas came
up with some key offensive re

The Cards took their first lead
of the ball game, 33-31, at
halftime on the strength of five
straight points by Belton, who
chalked up 13 in the first stanza.
The Cougars were ahead of the
Cards 16-8 with 8:30 gone in the
game.
Bratz lets loose
After the half, freshman Stuart
House limited Belton to just two
points. Senior guard Mike Bratz
took over the scoring chores for
the Cards, though, recording all
but two of his 18 points in the
second half.
Rhodes, however, did not
limit his scoring to one half. Av

eraging 17 points a game so far,
he scored 10 early points to put
the Cougars out in front, and
throughout the game plagued
the Cards' zone defense with his
outside jumpers.
Missed free throws
Stanford's second half free
throwing did not help them
much as they netted only 11 of
20 from the charity strip.
Marty Ciovacchini, the
Cougars' floor leader, paced
WSU with seven assists. The
Cougars blocked seven shots,
four of which were House's ef
forts.
Stanford's effort was ham
pered by a leg injury to Jay Carter
which he sustained in the first
half. Carter continued to play,
but the injury limited his effec
tiveness the remainder of the
game.

Harshman does not underesti

advantage.
"1 certainly would rather open
at home against California and
Stanford than travel to LO9,
Angeles, Oregon or anywhere."
he said recently.
The Cards record, though
gives Harshman cause to worry;
"Stanford, along with Oregon,
have been the early-season sur

great guards, particularly Bratz. v
They have been getting consis

the Cards' zone defense with his
outside jumpers.
Missed free throws
Stanford's second half free
throwing did not help them
much as they netted only 11 of
20 from the charity strip.
Marty Ciovacchini, the
Cougars' floor leader, paced
WSU with seven assists. The
Cougars blocked seven shots,
four of which were House's ef
forts.
Stanford's effort was ham
pered by a leg injury to Jay Carter
which he sustained in the first
half. Carter continued to play,
but the injury limited his effec
tiveness the remainder of the
game.

streak now, winning its last nine
games after having opened with
four losses. The Huskies' last de
feat came on December 4, 83-81
to Duke.

The Huskies' scoring leader,
seven-foot center James Ed
wards, is averaging 18.8 points
and 10.0 rebounds per game so
far this season. He was voted the
most valuable player in the Cab
rillo Classic. Edwards has hit on
55.2 per cent from the floor and
has blocked 20 shots.
Junior forward Kim Stewart,
who scored 34 points in the two
games, and senior guard Chester
Dorsey, who had a season-high
21 points against LaSalle. made

the All-tournament team in San
Diego.
Stewart is the leading assist
man for the Huskies with 51,
while Dorsey tops Washington
in steals with 26.
Hungry Huskies
The other starting forward for
Harshman is 6-5 freshman Stan
Walker. Starting in the
backcourt with Dorsey is
sophomore Mike Neill. Last year
in the Cards' second conference
game, Neill's left-handed set
shots from way outside made the
difference in Washington's
H7-81 victory at Maples Pavilion.
It has been four years since
Stanford won in Seattle, and
Harshman does not underesti
mate Washington's homecourt
advantage.
"1 certainly would rather open
at home against California and
Stanford than travel to LO9,
Angeles, Oregon or anywhere."
he said recently.
The Cards record, though
gives Harshman cause to worry;
"Stanford, along with Oregon,
have been the early-season sur
prises in the league. Stanford has
great guards, particularly Bratz. v
They have been getting consis
tent play from their inside
players as well." -■
The Washington State
Cougars combined 25 points by
Harold Rhodes with some key
free throws in the last two mi
nutes to hold oft the Stanford
Cardinals, 80-68, in the Pacific-8
opener for both teams at the Per
forming Arts Center in Pullman,
Washington last night.
The Cougars, 10-2 in non
conference play, scored eight
straight points, mostly on fast
breaks, at the outset of the sec
ond half to break a 37-37 tie. The
Cards never closed to iess than
four points the remainder of the
game.
Trailing 72-67 with 3:05 to
play, the Cards missed field goal
attempts and free throws and
scored only one more point
down the stretch on a free throw
by freshman Kimberly Belton
with 2:03 left.
Hey, big brother
Meanwhile, Cougar senior
guard Marty Ciovacchini,

brother of Stanford's Paul
Giovacchini, hit five of six free
throws when the Cards chose to
foul in attempts to get the ball
back.
When the Cougars did miss
their shots in the final minutes,
postman Steve Puidokas came
up with some key offensive re
bounds.
The Cards took their first lead
of the ball game, 33-31, at
halftime on the strength of five
straight points by Belton, who
chalked up 13 in the first stanza.
The Cougars were ahead of the
Cards 16-8 with 8:30 gone in the
game.
Bratz lets loose
After the half, freshman Stuart
House limited Belton to just two
points. Senior guard Mike Bratz
took over the scoring chores for
the Cards, though, recording all
but two of his 18 points in the
second half.
Rhodes, however, did not
limit his scoring to one half. Av

eraging 17 points a game so far,
he scored 10 early points to put
the Cougars out in front, and
throughout the game plagued
the Cards' zone defense with his
outside jumpers.
