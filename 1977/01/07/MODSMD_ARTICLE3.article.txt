# Health plan advances slowly

Washington (AP) â€” Although President-elect Jimmy
Carter has prescribed national health insurance for soar
ing medical costs, don't expect any immediate relief for
that nagging pain in your wallet.
Carter's transition team working on the program says
the nation's economic ills take priority and that Carter
wants to make existing health programs, such as Medicaid
and Medicare, work right first.
Chairman Al Ullman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, which will handle (ax costs of national health
insurance, says the administration will need most of this
year to perfect its recommendations.
"We may get to hearings this year," Ullman said, "but
no more than that."
Even after Congress approves a national health insur
ance plan, it will take "a few years" more to gear it up, said
Rep. Paul Rogers, chairman of the health subcommittee.
Insurance still possible
"However, national health insurance is far from being
on the back burner," said Robert Havely, health issues
coordinator for Carter's campaign and now a key health
program adviser on Carter's transition team. "It's some
thing we're working on now."

But Havely added, "We're going to have to work very
hard and for a long time to get it. It's not something that'll
happen tomorrow or next Tuesday." He said he doubts the
program will begin this year, but declined to speculate
about when it might.
Universal and mandatory
In a campaign speech to the Student National Medical
Association last April, Carter called for a universal and
mandatory national health insurance program to ease the
burden. Fie said it should be funded by general tax re
venues and employer and employe payroll taxes.
Under the program. Carter said, rates should be set in
advance for institutional care and doctor services, and
patients should be free to select the physicians and treat
ment centers they prefer. He said the program should
include more preventative care and pre-natal and infant
care benefits and should monitor the quality of all health
care provided.
He did not say how much the program would cost, but
said the government would not run it by itself. Carter said
the program would be a cooperative effort between the
public and private sectors.
