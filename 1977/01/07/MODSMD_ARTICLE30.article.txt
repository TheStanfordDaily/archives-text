# This season not promising
## Bright future for Card gymnasts 
### Jeff Wahba 
"We will have a hard time competing
competitively as a team against the rest of
the Pac-8 schools," gymnastics coach
Sadao Hamada warned. "But," he added,
"our prospects look much brighter after
this year."
The gymnastics team, traditionally
supported meagerlv by Stanford will
again fare poorly in this season's competi
tion concedes Hamada. With the loss of
three-time NCAA side horse champ Ted
Marcy, all-around gymnast Leo Holberg
and floor exercise specialist Bill Madsen
to graduation, last year's seventh place
finisher in the Pac-8 is resigned to a re
building year.
No money
Hamada's problem is simple. The other
Pac-8 schools take full advantage of the
NCAA allotment of seven athletic scho
larships per gymnastics team. At present,
Hamada is allowed to hand out only one.
"We just can't compete with them,"
said Hamada, "Stanford is difficult to get
into in the first place and I can't offer high
school gymnasts any money."
That is part of the reason why this year
Hamada has scheduled just five meets
plus the Pac-8 championships.
"I really only have three college level
gymnasts and not enough people to field
a full team," he said. "We could have
competed against some of the other Pac-8
schools by making a trip to Oregon but it

just doesn't seem worth the money. I
don't want to embarass us or our com
petitors and overwork our few top people
in meets," he explained.
Down to basics
A big chore Hamada will face this year
will be instructing bis team in new exer
cises which have been incorporated in the
competition format.
"The compulsory exercises for the
Moscow Games (1980 Olympics) will be
completely different from what they were
in Montreal," Hamada said.
He expects his squad to have a rougher
time adapting to the new exercises than
some of the other Pac-8 teams.
"Most gymnasts at other schools are
better trained in the basics because of
their high school background." he said,
"but a lot of my gymnasts just started the
last couple of years so they are weak in the
basics. Because of this, it will take us
longer to learn the new exercises and we
will probably be at a disadvantage this
year."
Three big talents
Despite the Cardinals' team woes, the
squad does have three excellent gym
nasts. Junior bobby Farb. a tenth place
finisher in the 1976 U.S. Olympic Trials,
leads the trio and is a definite contender
for the NCAA Championships. However.
Farb is just recovering from a wrist injury
and could miss several of the upcoming
meets.
Sophomore Chris Takimoto, pommel

horse specialist, is a Pac-8 championship
contender. Hamada's newest find is
freshman Tad Bostick one of the top high
school gymnasts in Texas.
With this strong threesome, Hamada is
eagerly looking forward to next year
when the gymnastics program will be en
larged. A women's team will practice
with the men and compete in its own
meets for the first time. Along with this
change Hamada hopes to receive several
more scholarships to hand out and there
fore has begun serious recruiting.
'Best recruiting year ever'
"This will definitelybeourbest recruit
ing year ever. We have at least 10 pros
pects lined up and after this year we will be
very competitive in the Pac-8," he pre
dicted. Hamada will become director of
the gymnastics program with a women's
coach most likely under his direction.
Even though the squad has averaged
15-17 hours a week of practice so far this
year, the team,which consists mainly of
walk-ons,really Can't expect a winning
season. The gymnasts' season opener is
Saturday at home against USC. The meet
starts at 7 p.m. in Encina gym. The squad
has one other home contest on January 28
when they go up against UCI.A.
Three away meets are scheduled with
UCLA. San jose State and Chico State
being the Cards' opponents. Without
Marcy, and an expanded program still a
year away, improvement — not winning
— will be the team's biggest goal.
