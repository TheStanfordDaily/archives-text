Oil tanker believed sunk in Atlantic
Boston — After three days of futile searching, the
Coast Guard said yesterday the tanker Grand Zenith
probably sank in the North Atlantic with its 38 crew
members and cargo of eight million gallons of oil.
The search changed yesterday from a hunt for the
missing 644-foot tanker to a hunt for life rafts and
(iebris. The Coast Guard estimated there was only a
10 per cent chance the Grand Zenith was still afloat.
All 38 officers and crew members on the tanker
are Chinese from Taiwan. Coast Guard Capt. Ber
nard Hoyland, who is directing the search, said
there is still a 90 per cent chance that survivors — if
any — might be found in life rafts.
A spokesman said two planks were spotted by an
aircraft late yesterday floating in an oil slick about
200 miles southeast of Cape Cod.
The tanker was last heard from Dec. 31 when its
position was reported as 60 miles south of Yar
mouth, N.S. The ship was loaded with No. 6 indust
rial fuel oil. The captain, T.K. Tsou, has 30 years'
experience at sea.
The search area yesterday extended from Nova
Scotia to Rhode Island and more than 500 miles out
to sea from Cape Cod. Seven planes from the United
States and one from Canada conducted the search,
along with the Coast Guard cutter Dallas.
I'he water temperature in the area being searched
was approximately 4 5 degrees. The Coast Guard
said that after 30 minutes in such water, a person
without protective clothes would have a 50-50
chance of surviving. After 2'/2 hours, there is a 99
per cent chance he would die.
TheGrand Zenith left Teesport, England, on Dec.
19, and was scheduled to arrive in Somerset, Mass.,
last Sunday with oil for an electric power plant.
Brown to veto any death penalty bill
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said yes
terday he will veto a death penalty bill if the
California Legislature sends one to his desk.
The 38-year-old Democrat said he "respects the
judgment of the people" who approved capital
punishment by a 2-1 margin in a 1972 voters' initia
tive.
"But for me it is a matter of conscience," said
Brown, who participated in a vigil against thedeath
penalty outside San Quentin Prison 10 years ago
before the last execution in California's gas
chamber.
I.ast month, the California Supreme Court de
clared unconstitutional a death penalty law passed
bv the legislature following the 1972 initiative.
That law was signed by Republican Gov. Ronald
Reagan.
In his annual State-of-the-State address, Brown
proposed legislation substituting life in prison
without possibility of parole in place of the death
penalty. Current law allows paroleas soon as seven
years after sentencing for life.

Supporters ot the death penalty immediately said
they expect to take the issue directly to voters in an
initiative. But Brown's declaration that he would
veto a capital punishment bill was praised as
courageous by foes and opponents.
"I am very pleased that he has been forthright in
making his views known," said Sen. George
Deukmejian (R-Long Beach), the legislature's lead
ing advocate of the death penalty.
Polio vaccination records reviewed
Atlanta — Records of the Salk polio vaccination
program in the 1950s and 1960s are being reviewed
to determine if it had any relationship with
Guillain-Barre syndrome, the national Center tor
Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday.
The syndrome, a mysterious paralysis about
which little is known, was responsible tor suspen
sion of the national swine flu inoculation program
Dec. 29. There were numerous reports of people
suffering from the disease's temporary paralysis
after taking the swine flu shots.
Philip Brachman, director of the center's bureau
of epidemiology, said the investigation of the polio
vaccination program was routine. There were no
clues specifically linking the polio vaccine de
veloped by Jonas Salk in 1953 to Guillain-Barre, he
said.
The investigation does not include use of the oral
polio vaccine developed by Albert Sabin and ap
proved for use in the United States in 1961, he said.
The Salk vaccine was pronounced safe and effec
tive in April 1955. Millions of Americans received
the Salk inoculations.
Polio, or Poliomyelitis, is an inflamation of the
brain and spinal cord which causes paralysis. Re
searchers have said there is no relationship bet
ween the polio paralysis and the paralysis of the
Guillain-Barre syndrome.
"It is not a virus," Brachman said in reviewing an
intensive national study of the syndrome begun
after the swine flu program was suspended.
"We think it is a reaction of the body to the swine
vaccine. It is something foreign to the body. It is
directly related to something in the vaccine — some
material, not a virus or an agent of some kind.
"It is not inconceivable tliat it might be a reaction
to several kinds of material. It might be something
in the makeup of that individual that causes them to
react to something in the vaccine."
Since October, when the swine flu program be
gan, there have been 570 syndrome cases nation
wide, the CDC said. Of these, 287 individuals re
ceived the swine flu vaccine, 261 were not vacci
nated, four received B-Hong Kong vaccine, and the
status of 18 is unknown.
In the same period, 21 deaths have been attri
buted to the syndrome, including 12 patients who
had received swine flu vaccine, eight who had not
and one whose vaccination status is unknown.

Yoshimura's testimony is thrown out
Oakland — Wendy Yoshimura's dramatic re
fusal to answer questions about her 3V2 years in the
terrorist underground prompted the judge to strike
her entire testimony yesterday, stunning the de
fendant and paving the way for a swift end to her
weapons possession trial.
Alameda County Superior Court Judge Martin
Fulich, acting on a motion by prosecutor Jeff
Horner, ordered Yoshimura's direct examination
by her own attorney thrown out and told the
eight-woman, four-man jury to ignore it.
"All of her testimony is stricken," said Pulich.
"The jury will treat it as if it had never been said."
Yoshimura, her eyes misting with tears, stepped
down from the witness stand as defense attorney
James Larson said, "In that case, the defense rests."
He placed a comforting hand on her as she sat in
silence at the counsel table, staring at the floor.
1 lorner immediately told the judge t hat he had no
rebuttal case. The judge adjourned court after
scheduling closing arguments for next Tuesday.
Yoshimura, 33, had spent most of Wednesday
answering Larson's questions about her activities
prior to March 31, 1972, when police raided a Ber
keley garage she had rented earlier and found a
cache of weapons and explosive devices.
But during cross examination she was cited for
contempt of court five times for refusing to discuss
her life after 1972 when she lived in the under
ground with Patricia Hearst and other fugitives.
She referring the prosecutor to a statement she
had read to the jury which said "moral principles"
require that she protect "dear friends" who helped
her elude arrest tor 3Vi years.
When she repeated her refusal yesterday, Horner
said it "would be futile to continue" and asked that
all her testimony be tossed out.
Tighter radiation standards proposed
Washington — The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) yesterday proposed lowering the
amount of radiation the general public can receive
from intentional discharge of radioactive material
by nuclear power production.
EPA Administrator Russell Train said the new
standards would allow about 20 times less permis
sible exposure than current rules.
"These standards establish an important prece
dent in radiation protection because they consider
the long-term potential buildup of radiation in the
environment," Train said in a statement.
Today's weather

clouds tonight and tomorrow morning. Lows
