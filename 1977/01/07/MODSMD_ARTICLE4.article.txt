# Group discusses impact of 'Bakke'
## 
### Elizabeth Pollock Staff writer 
About 35 students met last night at
Zapata Lounge to organize student
opposition to any retrenchment in
university commitment to improving
minority representation on campus.
The group, called the Stanford Coal
ition Against the Bakke Decision
(SCABD), will focus this month's ac
tivities on statewide "actions" plan
ned to show opposition to the Califor
nia Supreme Court's decision in Bakke
vs. Regents of the University of
California that "reverse discrimina
tion" had occurred in the medical ad
missions procedures at UC-Davis med
ical school.
The case is now on appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court and stay has been
granted that will render the California
court's decision ineffective until the
federal court hands down a decision,
probably sometime in the next court
session.
Members of SCABD will participate
in conferences held on Jan. 11 and 15
at California State University, Hay
ward, and University of California,
Berkeley, respectively.
The Berkeley meeting, organized by
the parent Coalition Against the Bakke
Decision (a statewide coalition) has
planned a tentative agenda which in
cludes a speakers' pa nel; a plenary ses
sion given by MEChA, Berkeley to or
ganize "actions" for late February; reg
ional reports on activities in San
Diego, Los Angeles and the Bay Area;

and workshops to study the legal as
pects of the Bakke ouse, plan high
school mobilization, fundraising and
publicity.
An article in the Dec. 15 Law School
Journal that announced the elimina
tion of racial or ethnic criteria from law
school financial aid programs initially
provoked last night's meeting.
The actual changes will be outlined
in Monday's Daily, but according to
the Journal, the new approach to scho
larships will be based solely on an
applicant's disadvantaged economic
position and will apply only to stu
dents yet to be enrolled. Law School
Dean Charles Meyers told the Journal
the new plan should yield "substan
tially the same results, plus or minus
two hundred dollars" as the former
test for aid applicants.
Students at last night's meeting of
SCABD expressed their concern that
changes in aid programs and the
change from minority to disadvan
taged admissions committees at medi
cal schools other than Stanford will
result in lower minority enrollment it
the Bakke case is upheld. *
Reggie Mason, a member of the
Committee on Student Services
(COSS) subcommittee on Minority Af
fairs, said that at DC-San Diego, "You
have to give direct proof that you have
been disadvantaged."
Manuel Hernandez, one of the mod
erators of last night's discussion, said,
"They're squeezing up two ways — on
the economic side and on the
academic side." He added. "Once they
let you in . . . they want you to keep up
with people who have access to
money."
With regard toßakke and its claim of
"reverse discrimination," Hernandez
said. "At this point in time that term
lacks substance because we do not
have proportional representation (in
universities)."
However, minority groups have in
dicated opposition to UC's decision to
appeal because "the case itself is
weak," Hernandez said. "(Also.) four
of the Supreme Court's judges were

appointed by Nixon, which is one
reason minority coalitions are form
ing, asking the University of California
not to appeal."
Hernandez said he had heard from
MEChA sources that minority groups
were under pressure to cooperate or
UC would appeal.
Hernandez said that history has
shown that the Supreme Court can be
influenced by the climate of public
opinion, and Manny Hernandez, the
other moderator, seconded him, pos
ing the question, "In what ways can we
influence the Supreme Court (to over
turn Bakke)?"

larships will be based solely on an
applicant's disadvantaged economic
position and will apply only to stu
dents yet to be enrolled. Law School
Dean Charles Meyers told the Journal
the new plan should yield "substan
tially the same results, plus or minus
two hundred dollars" as the former
test for aid applicants.
Students at last night's meeting of
SCABD expressed their concern that
changes in aid programs and the
change from minority to disadvan
taged admissions committees at medi
cal schools other than Stanford will
result in lower minority enrollment it
the Bakke case is upheld. *
Reggie Mason, a member of the
Committee on Student Services
(COSS) subcommittee on Minority Af
fairs, said that at DC-San Diego, "You
have to give direct proof that you have
been disadvantaged."
Manuel Hernandez, one of the mod
erators of last night's discussion, said,
"They're squeezing up two ways — on
the economic side and on the
academic side." He added. "Once they
let you in . . . they want you to keep up
with people who have access to
money."
With regard toßakke and its claim of
"reverse discrimination," Hernandez
said. "At this point in time that term
lacks substance because we do not
have proportional representation (in
universities)."
However, minority groups have in
dicated opposition to UC's decision to
appeal because "the case itself is
weak," Hernandez said. "(Also.) four
of the Supreme Court's judges were

appointed by Nixon, which is one
reason minority coalitions are form
ing, asking the University of California
not to appeal."
Hernandez said he had heard from
MEChA sources that minority groups
were under pressure to cooperate or
UC would appeal.
Hernandez said that history has
shown that the Supreme Court can be
influenced by the climate of public
opinion, and Manny Hernandez, the
other moderator, seconded him, pos
ing the question, "In what ways can we
influence the Supreme Court (to over
turn Bakke)?"
About 35 students met last night at
Zapata Lounge to organize student
opposition to any retrenchment in
university commitment to improving
minority representation on campus.
The group, called the Stanford Coal
ition Against the Bakke Decision
(SCABD), will focus this month's ac
tivities on statewide "actions" plan
ned to show opposition to the Califor
nia Supreme Court's decision in Bakke
vs. Regents of the University of
California that "reverse discrimina
tion" had occurred in the medical ad
missions procedures at UC-Davis med
ical school.
The case is now on appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court and stay has been
granted that will render the California
court's decision ineffective until the
federal court hands down a decision,
probably sometime in the next court
session.
Members of SCABD will participate
in conferences held on Jan. 11 and 15
at California State University, Hay
ward, and University of California,
Berkeley, respectively.
The Berkeley meeting, organized by
the parent Coalition Against the Bakke
Decision (a statewide coalition) has
planned a tentative agenda which in
cludes a speakers' pa nel; a plenary ses
sion given by MEChA, Berkeley to or
ganize "actions" for late February; reg
ional reports on activities in San
Diego, Los Angeles and the Bay Area;

and workshops to study the legal as
pects of the Bakke ouse, plan high
school mobilization, fundraising and
publicity.
An article in the Dec. 15 Law School
Journal that announced the elimina
tion of racial or ethnic criteria from law
school financial aid programs initially
provoked last night's meeting.
The actual changes will be outlined
in Monday's Daily, but according to
the Journal, the new approach to scho
larships will be based solely on an
applicant's disadvantaged economic
position and will apply only to stu
dents yet to be enrolled. Law School
