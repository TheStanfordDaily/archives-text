# Study of language program proposed
## 
### Bill Sing Staff writer 
A proposal calling for an examina
tion of "the place and function of
foreign languages in the under
graduate curriculum here so as to re
commend ways by which their study
could be encouraged and
strengthened" was submitted to the
Faculty Senate yesterday.
The proposal, if approved by the se
nate, would direct the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, in consulta
tion with the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Dean of the School of En
gineering and "other competent con
stituencies within the university," to
submit recommendations on foreign
language studies before the end of the
calendar year 1977.
"The study of foreign languages in
our country is now experiencing the
most critical decline in half a century,"
said Alphonse Juilland, chairman of
the department of French and Italian.
"Stanford has a special responsibility

to lead other universities in an effort to
assess the crisis and propose approp
riate remedies."
Real crisis
In submitting the proposal, Juilland
said that in no way does it direct the
university to adopt a foreign language
requirement. All the proposal does is
recognize that the crisis in foreign lan
guage study is a real one, said Juilland.
At present the university has no
foreign language requirements, either
for admission or for graduation.
Juilland said that the university's
new humanities distribution require
ments, which now exclude all first
year language courses from satisfying
the requirement, coupled with the lack
of a foreign language admission re
quirement has been "most damaging"
to foreign language studies here.
The change in humanities distribu
tion requirements, said Juilland, ac
counts for the abrupt decline this year
of enrollments in beginning foreign
language courses. First-year Russian
shows a decline of 43 percent from last
year's enrollment, with German at a 38
per cent decline and French at 35 per
cent, according to Juilland.
The professor also said that the
elimination of the foreign language
admission requirement in 1969 has, in
the opinion of the Council of Basic
Education, "contributed more than
any other (decision) to undermine
foreign language programs at the high
school level."
This decline, said Juilland, "is going
to reverberate here in only a matter of
years."
Most students prepared
Provost William Miller pointed out
figures given to him by Dean of Ad
missions Fred Hargadon showing that
over 94 percent of this year's freshman
class has had two or more years of at
least one foreign language in high
school. This, said Miller, indicates that
"indeed most of our students do come
to Stanford with a fair amount of
foreign language preparation."
A position paper entitled The Study
of Foreign Languages submitted this

fall quarter by the so-called
Humanities Circle, a group of 12 fa
culty in the School of Humanities and
Sciences, said that the proportion of
students enrolling in modern lan
guages nationally has fallen more than
one-third since Stanford and several
other major universities eliminated
foreign language requirements in the
late 19605.
Dean of the School of Engineering
William Kays said that there is still a
need to determine whether this crisis

is a university one or simply "a local
language department crisis."
The senate will probably take action
on the proposal at its next meeting on
Jan. 20.
Also at the meeting. Board of Trus
tees member Richard Guggenheim re
ported on the progress of the Cam
paign for Stanford and said that this
past December was "the most success
ful (month) in Stanford solicitation
history."

tion of "the place and function of
foreign languages in the under
graduate curriculum here so as to re
commend ways by which their study
could be encouraged and
strengthened" was submitted to the
Faculty Senate yesterday.
The proposal, if approved by the se
nate, would direct the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, in consulta
tion with the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, the Dean of the School of En
gineering and "other competent con
stituencies within the university," to
submit recommendations on foreign
language studies before the end of the
calendar year 1977.
"The study of foreign languages in
our country is now experiencing the
most critical decline in half a century,"
said Alphonse Juilland, chairman of
the department of French and Italian.
"Stanford has a special responsibility

to lead other universities in an effort to
assess the crisis and propose approp
riate remedies."
Real crisis
In submitting the proposal, Juilland
said that in no way does it direct the
university to adopt a foreign language
requirement. All the proposal does is
recognize that the crisis in foreign lan
guage study is a real one, said Juilland.
At present the university has no
foreign language requirements, either
for admission or for graduation.
Juilland said that the university's
new humanities distribution require
ments, which now exclude all first
year language courses from satisfying
the requirement, coupled with the lack
of a foreign language admission re
quirement has been "most damaging"
to foreign language studies here.
The change in humanities distribu
tion requirements, said Juilland, ac
counts for the abrupt decline this year
of enrollments in beginning foreign
language courses. First-year Russian
shows a decline of 43 percent from last
year's enrollment, with German at a 38
per cent decline and French at 35 per
cent, according to Juilland.
The professor also said that the
elimination of the foreign language
admission requirement in 1969 has, in
the opinion of the Council of Basic
Education, "contributed more than
any other (decision) to undermine
foreign language programs at the high
school level."
This decline, said Juilland, "is going
to reverberate here in only a matter of
years."
Most students prepared
Provost William Miller pointed out
figures given to him by Dean of Ad
missions Fred Hargadon showing that
over 94 percent of this year's freshman
class has had two or more years of at
least one foreign language in high
school. This, said Miller, indicates that
"indeed most of our students do come
to Stanford with a fair amount of
foreign language preparation."
A position paper entitled The Study
of Foreign Languages submitted this

fall quarter by the so-called
Humanities Circle, a group of 12 fa
culty in the School of Humanities and
Sciences, said that the proportion of
students enrolling in modern lan
guages nationally has fallen more than
one-third since Stanford and several
other major universities eliminated
foreign language requirements in the
late 19605.
Dean of the School of Engineering
William Kays said that there is still a
need to determine whether this crisis

is a university one or simply "a local
language department crisis."
The senate will probably take action
on the proposal at its next meeting on
Jan. 20.
Also at the meeting. Board of Trus
tees member Richard Guggenheim re
ported on the progress of the Cam
paign for Stanford and said that this
past December was "the most success
ful (month) in Stanford solicitation
history."
