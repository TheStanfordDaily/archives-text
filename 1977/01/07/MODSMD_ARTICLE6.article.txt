# New law school grads wrestle job market

Although the market for new law
school graduates is not as bleak as re
cent articles have suggested, many
students will have to search for their
positions and consider a variety of al
ternative ones, according to Richard
Badger, president of the National As
sociation for Law Placement (NALP).
Stanford Law School also encour
ages students to conduct their own job
search, especially if they are interested
in public interest or legal aid posi
tions, explained Julie Wehrman, di
rector of the Office of Law Placement.
"It is difficult to find such positions
(public interest or legal aid work) be
cause there are not many jobs available
in these areas," she said.
The Office of Law Placement solicits
most of its interviewers from private
firms (83 per cent of the interviewers
this year were from private firms). It is
difficult finding a job through the
placement office for those not in
terested in big city law firms, said
law student Chris Seaver.
Compared to other law schools,
Stanford students do .very well in the
legal job market, said Wehrman. "I do
not envision that Stanford graduates

are ever going to be dramatically af
fected by a tightening job market," she
said.
Stanford Law School graduate
placement reflected the national trend
last year. Fifty per cent of the graduates
here went into private practice. The
NALP reported that 51 per cent ot the
nation's graduates went into private
practice. Twelve per cent of the Stan
ford graduates went into clerkships
while the nationwide figure was nine
per cent and 11 per cent of students
here accepted government positions
while the NALP figure was 10 percent.
Nationally, 10 per cent entered cor
porate law firms while six per cent en
tered from Stanford. Public interest
jobs and legal aid services attracted six
per cent of the graduates here and five
and-a-half per cent of graduates
nationwide.
The Placement Committee, spon
sored by the Law Association, assists
the office in this effort, according to
Wehrman. One of the main efforts of
the committee is organizing a con
ference to help law students become
more aware of various legal careers
here and in Los Angeles, according to
Eileen Prager, who chairs the commit
tee.
