# Economics Department copes with growing pains
## 
### George Anders Analysis 
Everyone has his own explanation for why
economics has become such a popular major herein the
last five years.
"It's a haven for all the pre-med and engineering
washouts." one co-terminal econ student claimed.
"More people are concerned about the economic
situation and want to study it." Economics Dept.
Chairman Bert Hickman said. "Also, more people are
interested in occupations where economics is good
background."
Whatever the reason, students have flocked to the
department. The registrar's records show 400
economics majors last fall, up from 198 in fall 1972.
Enrollment in classes has gone up 70 per cent from
1971-72 to 1975-76, Hickman said.
To deal with this leap, Hicman explained, the de
partment has:
—expanded faculty size 20 per cent since 1972;
—increased the number of classes taught by visiting
professors and advanced graduate students and
—added about 25 new classes.
Have these measures been adequate? Answers vary
widely, with the most frequent one being "almost."
"It would be desirable if we could increase the

number of faculty further," Hickman said. But he noted
the department is limited by the university's budget
constraints.
University budget decisions must overcome "a great
deal of inertia," Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Halsey Royden explained. Department budgets do not
increase as fast as enrollment because enrollment
•changes are often short-term, he said.
But Royden pointed out that during the recent
Budget Equilibrium Program economics was one of the
few departments that did not lose a faculty position.
Grads anJ visitors
Limited budget growth has required the department
to give more undergraduate teaching to visiting faculty
and grad students, according to Assoc. Economics Prof.
Michael Boskin. director of undergraduate studies for
the department.
"We do not expect graduate students or visiting fa
culty to do as good a job on the average as regular
faculty," Boskin said. He added, however, that some of
these additional teachers perform well and that the
department must use them to have enough teachers.
Boskin cited inexperience as the chief shortcoming
of graduate instructors. However. Tom Ulen, a fourth
year graduate student who is teaching Economic
Analysis I this quarter said he previously taught

courses at other colleges. Other graduate instructors
have also taught elsewhere.
"So the students aren't exactly getting raw meat."
Ulen said.
For visiting faculty, their teaching ability "has no
influence at all" on whether they are hired. Jens Christ
iansen, an economics instructor, asserted. Boskin dis
agreed, but said "it's much harder to judge teaching
than research."
Despite these changes, enrollment has risen in nearly
all economics classes. "Some of our classes are larger
than we'd like but I don't think they're so large it's
inefficient." Hickman said.
Drew Wechsler. a teaching assistant for Elementary
Economics last quarter, said the class was far too big.
With a 450 enrollment, "students get less than a $4000
education's worth of attention" when their exams are
graded, he stated.
Workable enrollments
For upper level courses, professors generally agreed
with Hickman's remarks. Asst. Economics Prof. Karen
Johnson said classes of 90 to 140 students are as work
able as the classes of 60 to 70 which were common five
years ago.
Christensen said seminars do not suffer from tre
mendous overdemand either.

Professors did mention some difficulties from rising
enrollment. Johnson said when 190 enrolled in her
Money and Banking class last spring, it was "larger
than I would hope for my way of teaching." Students
were reluctant to ask questions in that large a class, she
explained.
Economics Prof. John Gurley noted that rising en
rollments have meant more students seek letters of
recommendation from him. Writing those letters
"takes a big chunk out of my time," he said.
The department has frequent scheduling problems,
largely because, as Johnson pointed out, "it does not
have any large lecture hall over which it has first claim.
We're constantly playing musical chairs."
By now, the department appears to have eased most
of its overenrollment difficulties. "Last year was very
hard," Johnson recalled, but she said the department
has now expanded enough to accommodate the stu
dent boom.
Enrollment is leveling off, thus requiring few new
adjustments. Hickman and others predict enrollment
will remain nearly constant the next few years and
discount the possibility that the department will shrink
to its pre-1972 levels.
After all, washouts and executives-to-be need so;>n
thing to major in.
