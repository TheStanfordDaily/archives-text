'Bloody well shouldn't'
As Dave Ansley rightly suggests in
his column from Cliveden (Daily, Nov.
19), more years mQst pass in England
before something is acclaimed as ven
erable there. But when, late last
January, Overseas Studies Director
Mark Mancall proposed a toast at
Cliveden to the center's tenth anniver
sary, it seemed a momentous — almost
antique — occasion indeed.
Things move fast here in the states.
Maybe it was almost inevitable that a
faculty committee would recommend
closing Cliveden; such bodies usually
feel hound to suggest some change
-for-the-sake-of-change to justify their
Cranted, life at Cliveden isn't all
-«»tip-top; one of the center's biggest ex
« penses is fuel oil for heating the drafty
"old manor house. But the committee's
-assumption that a move to Oxford or
. London would result in "more cultural
and social resources" is just plain
wrong.
By rail, London is about as far from
.Cliveden as San Francisco is from
'Stanford, with the difference that
- trains are faster and more frequent; it's
easy for a Clivedenite to go in to hear
'plays and concerts even on a week
night. Oxford is quite a bit farther
away; in this spatial context, moving
Stanford-in-Britain there would be
like moving Stanford to San Jose or
Cilroy (that might save some money
too).
So why not move our campus to
London, if the night life is so great? For
one thing, housing there is scarce and
high-priced. The "campus" would be
come scattered; group identity would
be lost. For another, London still is a
noisy and dirty place as are all big
cities. Residents of "The Farm" here
will appreciate the difference a nice
atmosphere can make.
Finally, the Duke of Cloucester is
fond of pointing out that London is not
all there is to Britain; he tours the Un
ited States to tell prospective visitors
to see "the provinces" instead of just
touring the Tower of London and rid
ing a double-decker bus. His point is
well taken; London is the heart of
Britishculture, but focusing only there
would mean selling England's varied
"social resources" short.
I'm probably not the only student
who could have chosen to study at Ox
ford or London independently; in
stead, I came to Stanford because 1
thought the Cliveden campus was un
ique. Shutting down the place will
surely mean fewer Stanford students
in Britain, and it might mean just plain
fewer Stanford students.
Close Cliveden? The bean-counters

in the Foreign Study Committee
bloody well shouldn't!

Objectionable
What is the CPS news service, and
why should we read their releases? I
noticed that the Dec. 2 issue of the
Daily contained four of their articles.
Particularly objectionable were the
ones headlined, "U.S. 'Screwed Up'
Sexually" (which belongs either on
the editorial or entertainment pages)
and "Carter to Implement Policy for
Pardons" (which is a "make-issue" ar
ticle). Neither is hard news.
The Daily has been swelled recently
by Christmas advertising. That is to be
expected. But to crown each of you'r
center pages with CPS articles — at

best trivial, at worst polemical — is an
added affront. There are a number of
small, purposely low-profile, "gadfly"
news services around the nation that
specialize in old and slanted news. Is
the CPS one of them?
Finally, there is no real socially re
deeming value to pages that are 80 per
cent advertising. So why not stop pre
tending and fill the remaining space
with pictures or cartoons instead of
empty grey matter? "Covering" a
mountain of ads with articles from
what seems to be an- anti
establishment news service simply
makes each page a contradiction.

'Bloody well shouldn't'
As Dave Ansley rightly suggests in
his column from Cliveden (Daily, Nov.
19), more years mQst pass in England
before something is acclaimed as ven
erable there. But when, late last
January, Overseas Studies Director
Mark Mancall proposed a toast at
Cliveden to the center's tenth anniver
sary, it seemed a momentous — almost
antique — occasion indeed.
Things move fast here in the states.
Maybe it was almost inevitable that a
faculty committee would recommend
closing Cliveden; such bodies usually
feel hound to suggest some change
-for-the-sake-of-change to justify their
Cranted, life at Cliveden isn't all
-«»tip-top; one of the center's biggest ex
« penses is fuel oil for heating the drafty
"old manor house. But the committee's
-assumption that a move to Oxford or
. London would result in "more cultural
and social resources" is just plain
wrong.
By rail, London is about as far from
.Cliveden as San Francisco is from
'Stanford, with the difference that
- trains are faster and more frequent; it's
easy for a Clivedenite to go in to hear
'plays and concerts even on a week
night. Oxford is quite a bit farther
away; in this spatial context, moving
Stanford-in-Britain there would be
like moving Stanford to San Jose or
Cilroy (that might save some money
too).
So why not move our campus to
London, if the night life is so great? For
one thing, housing there is scarce and
high-priced. The "campus" would be
come scattered; group identity would
be lost. For another, London still is a
noisy and dirty place as are all big
cities. Residents of "The Farm" here
will appreciate the difference a nice
atmosphere can make.
Finally, the Duke of Cloucester is
fond of pointing out that London is not
all there is to Britain; he tours the Un
ited States to tell prospective visitors
to see "the provinces" instead of just
touring the Tower of London and rid
ing a double-decker bus. His point is
well taken; London is the heart of
Britishculture, but focusing only there
would mean selling England's varied
"social resources" short.
I'm probably not the only student
who could have chosen to study at Ox
ford or London independently; in
stead, I came to Stanford because 1
thought the Cliveden campus was un
ique. Shutting down the place will
surely mean fewer Stanford students
in Britain, and it might mean just plain
fewer Stanford students.

in the Foreign Study Committee
