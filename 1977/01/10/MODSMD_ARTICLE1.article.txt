# Residence program themes submitted
## 
### Arlene Kishi Staff writer 
Proposals for Androgyny and Ger
man Studies Theme Houses as new
undergraduate residence programs for
1977-78, have been submitted to the
Office of Residential Education.
The purpose of Androgyny House
would be to "create a broad educa
tional experience that will give its re
sidents and participants a new sex role
awareness" with its goal "to eliminate
sexism and its oppression not only of
women but also of men," according to
its proposal submitted last week.
A German Studies House would
offer students a "focal point for their
manifold interest in German culture,"
states the proposal submitted by the
Department of German Studies. "It
would also encourage more use of the
German language," according to Prof.
Kurt Mueller-Vollmer, acting depart
ment chairman.
Decision in a month
The proposals will be reviewed by
an Advisory Panel in the Office of Re
sidential Education. The panel's re
commendations for adoption or rejec
tion will then be submitted to Norm
Robinson, acting director of residen
tial education, who will make the final
decision. Robinson said these pro
ceedings should be completed within
a month.
Mike Schuman, one of the sponsors
the Androgyny Theme House prop
osal, expressed his enthusiasm for
their new residential idea.
"1 think we're all extremely excited
about this. We've been working to
gether very enthusiastically gathering
petitions, planning and writing for
well over two months and this is the
culmination of all our efforts."
Members of the house would be re
quired to complete "at least two
academic courses dealing with
feminist-humanist issues" during the
year and participate in weekly \ x h-2
hour "consciousness-raising (CR)
groups," according to the proposal.
The house would also like to sponsor a
speaker or film series.
House members would include 40
students (50 per cent male, 50 per cent
female), at least two resident advisors
and one faculty advisor. The proposal
states that priority would be given first
to the members of the Ad-Hoc Commit
tee on Androgyny, then to students
whose first draw card priority is the
Androgyny House and finally, to stu
dents who have met with the commit
tee and received priority cards.
Locations uncertain
Possible locations for either house
are not yet final. But for Androgyny,
"Jordan and Whitman are the two most
often mentioned for our housing pro
ject because of alleged problems in
both houses," said Schuman.
The tentative academic program for
the German Studies Theme House
would include language instruction
through supplementary tutoring and
quarterly seminars open to residents
&nd non-residents.
The house would be open to all un
dergraduates who have a "strong in
terest in the Central European field"
and not limited to majors in the Ger
man Studies department, states the
proposal.
Members would include 40 to BO
students, six house associates and a
resident director. "Strong interest has
been expressed by students and fa
culty." said Mueller-Vollmer.

to the members of the Ad-Hoc Commit
tee on Androgyny, then to students
whose first draw card priority is the
Androgyny House and finally, to stu
dents who have met with the commit
tee and received priority cards.
Locations uncertain
Possible locations for either house
are not yet final. But for Androgyny,
"Jordan and Whitman are the two most
often mentioned for our housing pro
ject because of alleged problems in
both houses," said Schuman.
The tentative academic program for
the German Studies Theme House
would include language instruction
through supplementary tutoring and
quarterly seminars open to residents
&nd non-residents.
The house would be open to all un
dergraduates who have a "strong in
terest in the Central European field"
and not limited to majors in the Ger
man Studies department, states the
proposal.
Members would include 40 to BO
students, six house associates and a
resident director. "Strong interest has
been expressed by students and fa
culty." said Mueller-Vollmer.

Proposals for Androgyny and German Studies Theme
houses were submitted to the Office of Residential
Education on Friday.
Proposals for Androgyny and Ger
man Studies Theme Houses as new
undergraduate residence programs for
1977-78, have been submitted to the
Office of Residential Education.
The purpose of Androgyny House
would be to "create a broad educa
tional experience that will give its re
sidents and participants a new sex role
awareness" with its goal "to eliminate
sexism and its oppression not only of
women but also of men," according to
its proposal submitted last week.
A German Studies House would
offer students a "focal point for their
manifold interest in German culture,"
states the proposal submitted by the
Department of German Studies. "It
would also encourage more use of the
German language," according to Prof.
Kurt Mueller-Vollmer, acting depart
ment chairman.
Decision in a month
The proposals will be reviewed by
an Advisory Panel in the Office of Re
sidential Education. The panel's re
commendations for adoption or rejec
tion will then be submitted to Norm
Robinson, acting director of residen
tial education, who will make the final
decision. Robinson said these pro
ceedings should be completed within
a month.
Mike Schuman, one of the sponsors
the Androgyny Theme House prop
osal, expressed his enthusiasm for
their new residential idea.
"1 think we're all extremely excited
about this. We've been working to
gether very enthusiastically gathering
petitions, planning and writing for
well over two months and this is the
culmination of all our efforts."
Members of the house would be re
quired to complete "at least two
academic courses dealing with
feminist-humanist issues" during the
year and participate in weekly \ x h-2
hour "consciousness-raising (CR)
groups," according to the proposal.
The house would also like to sponsor a
speaker or film series.
House members would include 40
students (50 per cent male, 50 per cent
female), at least two resident advisors
and one faculty advisor. The proposal
states that priority would be given first
to the members of the Ad-Hoc Commit
tee on Androgyny, then to students
whose first draw card priority is the
Androgyny House and finally, to stu
dents who have met with the commit
tee and received priority cards.
