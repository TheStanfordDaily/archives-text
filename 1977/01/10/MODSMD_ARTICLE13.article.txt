# Cable causes power failure
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
Some classes were canceled,
students were forced to eat off
paper plates in Wilbur and Stern
Halls and the x-ray service at the
Co well Health (-enter was inop
erable after a malfunctioning
cable caused a series of power
failures on campus Friday.
The areas affected by the
faulty section of the under
ground cable include Wilbur,
Stern, Toyon and CrothersHalls;
Encina; Main Library; Hoover
Tower; the Lou Henry Hoover
Building; the Bookstore; the
Quad and several engineering
laboratories.
The power went off about 3
a.m. and was restored almost
immediately, but it went off
again shortly after 7:30 a.m. Ser
vice was restored to most of the
academic buildings before noon
and to Wilbur and Stern Halls
and the Cowell Cluster by 4 p.m.
Using its own generator, Cow
ell Health Center was able to
supply all services except
x-raying. Patients were sent to
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic to
be x-rayed.
In Wilbur and Stern Halls,
there was no hot water for the
dishwashers so students used
paper plates and plastic silver
ware. Some substitutions were
made on the menu, but both
dorms have gas grills and stoves
enabling them to prepare hot
foods as usual. Because re

frigerators were not working,
food was transferred to the
commissary until power was re
stored.
Cancelled classes
The Mathematics Department
reported that one or two of its 8
a.m. classes were canceled.
However, other departments re
ported no classes canceled.
Manager of Utilities Robert
Mcknight said that the steam
heating system had to be shut
down in the affected area be
cause the pumps which carry
condensate back to the steam
plant were inoperable. As a re
sult, those areas had neither heat
nor hot water. Mcknight said a
pipe in the system might have
burst, resulting in loss of pres
sure, if the steam had not been
turned off.
Friday's power outage fol
lowed a brief electrical failure
early Wednesday morning. Plant
Services employes worked all
day Thursday to locate the fault,
but were unable to find it in time
to avert a second and third
power failure on Friday.
Breaker
Manager of Utilities Mcknight
explained that a breaker at the
Panama substation located on
Panama St. near the engineering
buildings failed to open as it was
supposed to. So a breaker
opened further down the line at
the Via Palou substation near Via
Palou and Panama causing a
power failure at approximately 3
a.m. The breaker at Via Palou
was closed quickly thereafter
and stayed closed until shortly
after 7:30 a.m.
After the second failure sec
tions of the affected area were
slowly returned to service as
parts of the electrical system
were checked and cleared of
trouble. The malfunctioning
breaker at the Panama substation
was replaced with a spare.
Mcknight said that the breaker
has yet to be examined to deter
mine the cause of the malfunc
tion.
Finally, workers found the

trouble to be located in an un
derground cable between Wil
bur and Cowell Health Center.
Mcknight explained that the
length of time it took to restore
electricity was not due to any
"lack of concern." He said it
takes time to isolate the bad sec
tion of cable and then reroute
electrical service.
Although the precise reason
for the breakdown in the cable
will not be known for a couple of
weeks, Mcknight explained that
there are four possibilities: a de
fective cable, improper installa
tion, ground shift or some as vet
unknown factor in the environ
ment here. He said that the cable
in question was less than four

years old and that he had not
expected to have any trouble
with it this soon. Such cable
could last up to 40 years.
The power failure also re
vealed that the emergency light
ing system in Wilbur may not be
working properly. There were
reports that these lights failed to
go on in Trancos and possibly in
other Wilbur houses during the
power failure. Maintenance Di
rector Rich Richardson said that
he was not aware of any such
report, but that he would check
into it immediately. He also said
that the emergency lights along
with all other fire safety equip
ment is checked at least once a
month.
