## Huskies maul Cards, 98-77 Washington rains on Stanford 
### David Georgette 
The Washington Huskies ran through
and past the Stanford Cardinals Saturday
afternoon in Seattle's Edmundson Pavil
ion on their way to a 98-77 Pacific-8 Con
ference triumph.
The Huskies' fast break combined with
a weak Cardinal zone defense resulted in
all five Washington starters scoring at
least 12 points for the second game in a
row. Leading the Huskies was sopho
more Larry Neill with 20 points. Neil 1
paved the way to coach Marv Harsh
man's 100 th Washington triumph.
Stanford's Mike Bratz topped all scor
ers with 21 points, 12 of them coming in
the second half. Forward kimberly Hel
ton added 19 for the Cards.
The zone defense used by Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso throughout most of
the game often failed to stop the Huskies
when the ball went to the weak side and
the Huskies were left with easy short
range jumpers. Washington forwards
Kim Stewart and freshman Stan Walker
pumped in 16 and 12 points respec
tively, while the Cards were collapsing
in on the Huskies' leading scorer, center
James Edwards.
"I didn't think our defense was very
good," said Dißiaso. "We gave up too
many points."
He said one of the reasons the Cardinal
defense was porous was due to the fact
that "we had players playing different
positions for the first time."

The 1 ine-up changes were necessitated
by the absence of forward Jay Carter who
did not suit up because of a foot injury
suffered Thursday night against
Washington State.
The Cards went with a three-guard at
tack, with Paul Ciovacchini inserted into

the starting five. This line-up took its toll
in the rebounding department. The Hus
kies dominated the boards, outrebound
ing the Cards.
Stewart and Edwards had 28 rebounds
between them, frequently allowing
guard Chet Dorsey to whiplash the Hus
kies down court on a fast break ending in
a lay-in.
The Cards' final lead of the game was
at 5-4 on the scoreboard with less than
four minutes gone into the contest. And
35 minutes later, the only suspense left
in the game was the answer to the ques
tion of whether or not Washington could
top the century mark. The outcome of the
game, however, had been decided a long
time before.
A Bratz bomb just before the half sent
the Cards into the locker room down by
the score of 41-33, but in the second half
the Cards never lessened the eight-point
gap. The Huskies put the game away at
the beginning of the second half bv out
scoring the Cards 14-4.
In commenting on his team's perfor
mance, Dißiaso said, "some of our
shortcomings are obvious."
They could become more obvious this
weekend against the Los Armeies
schools.ln looking to the Cards nextop
ponents, Dißiaso said, "I th ik \\c lave
to test the validity of the numbe one
ranking of our medical school." He was
referring to the chances of Carter being
ready to face the Trojans and the Bruins.
