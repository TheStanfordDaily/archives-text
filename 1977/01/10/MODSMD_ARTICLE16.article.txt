# End of an era?
## Northern Pac-8 teams tough 
### Jeff Parietti 
The 1977 Pacific>B basketball
season began with a surprise as
Oregon upset sixth ranked
UCLA, 61-60 at Pauley Pavilion
last weekend. Greg Ballard sank
two free throws with one second
remaining in the contest to give
Oregon the win.
UCLA had led 60-53 with 3:49
left, but the Ducks rallied and
closed to within one with 1:59 to
go. David Greenwood had a
chance to ice the game with 49
seconds left, but the Bruin center
missed the first shot of a one
and-one situation.
The Ducks got the rebound

and played for one shot. Ballard
missed a 15-foot jumper, but was
fouled on the shot to set-up his
last second heroics.
Ballard led all scorers with 22
points while Marques Johnson
had 21 for UCLA.
This marks the second con
secutive year that Oregon has
upended UCLA on the Bruins'
home court, and the first time
since 1963 that UCLA has lost its
conference opener.
Oregon chalked up another
win as they defeated USC, 64-52.
Ballard led the Ducks with 27
points. The senior forward hit
for 21 of Oregon's first 27 points.

"He's the most effective player
in the Pac-8," said Trojan coach
Bob Boyd of Ballard, who ended
up with 49 points and 16 re
bounds for the weekend.
USC was led by Marv Safford
with 10 points.
The Bruins bounced back to
even their conference mark at
1-1 as they overcame Oregon
State, 83-66.
The game was actually closer
than the score indicated, as the
Beavers trailed by five, 69-64
with about four minutes left,
UCLA then capitalized on sev
eral Oregon State turnovers and
ran off a string of seven consecu
tive field goals to put the game
out of reach.
The Beavers were hampered
by foul trouble, as two starters
fouled out and two others
finished the contest with four
fouls.
Marques Johnson and David
Greenwood paced the Bruins
with 19 points apiece while Ray
Townsend added 14. Oregon

State's guards combined for 46
points as Rocky Smith hit for 28
and George Tucker contributed
18.
Smith again led the Beavers in
scoring with 18 points as Oregon
State beat USC, 58-50. The
6-foot-2 guard scored the last
five points for Oregon State after
the Trojans' Marv Safford had
brought USC to within two at
51-49 with 2:58 remaining.
Tucker and Ricky Lee added 12
and 10 points respectively,
while Paul Henderson, Mark
Hoisington and Mark Wul
femeyer each had 10 points for
the Trojans.
Up north, California lost to
Washington 85-75 and to
Washington State, 77-63. In the
latter game, Steve Puidokas led
the Cougars with 23 points.
The balance of power seems to
be shifting in the Pacific-8 with
three Northwest schools,
Washington, Washington State
and Oregon tied for the confer
ence lead.

Stanford's icemen took on San Dieqo State Friday at Belmont Iceland. Here Murray Kenney
(6) takes a shot at the goal. The Cards won 5-3 in a game where Stanford shot 54 times.
The 1977 Pacific>B basketball
season began with a surprise as
Oregon upset sixth ranked
UCLA, 61-60 at Pauley Pavilion
last weekend. Greg Ballard sank
two free throws with one second
remaining in the contest to give
Oregon the win.
UCLA had led 60-53 with 3:49
left, but the Ducks rallied and
closed to within one with 1:59 to
go. David Greenwood had a
chance to ice the game with 49
seconds left, but the Bruin center
missed the first shot of a one
and-one situation.
The Ducks got the rebound

and played for one shot. Ballard
missed a 15-foot jumper, but was
fouled on the shot to set-up his
last second heroics.
Ballard led all scorers with 22
points while Marques Johnson
had 21 for UCLA.
This marks the second con
secutive year that Oregon has
upended UCLA on the Bruins'
home court, and the first time
since 1963 that UCLA has lost its
conference opener.
Oregon chalked up another
win as they defeated USC, 64-52.
Ballard led the Ducks with 27
points. The senior forward hit
for 21 of Oregon's first 27 points.

"He's the most effective player
in the Pac-8," said Trojan coach
Bob Boyd of Ballard, who ended
up with 49 points and 16 re
bounds for the weekend.
USC was led by Marv Safford
with 10 points.
The Bruins bounced back to
even their conference mark at
1-1 as they overcame Oregon
State, 83-66.
The game was actually closer
than the score indicated, as the
Beavers trailed by five, 69-64
with about four minutes left,
UCLA then capitalized on sev
eral Oregon State turnovers and
ran off a string of seven consecu
tive field goals to put the game
out of reach.
The Beavers were hampered
by foul trouble, as two starters
fouled out and two others
finished the contest with four
fouls.
Marques Johnson and David
Greenwood paced the Bruins
with 19 points apiece while Ray
Townsend added 14. Oregon

State's guards combined for 46
points as Rocky Smith hit for 28
and George Tucker contributed
18.
Smith again led the Beavers in
scoring with 18 points as Oregon
State beat USC, 58-50. The
6-foot-2 guard scored the last
five points for Oregon State after
the Trojans' Marv Safford had
brought USC to within two at
51-49 with 2:58 remaining.
Tucker and Ricky Lee added 12
and 10 points respectively,
while Paul Henderson, Mark
Hoisington and Mark Wul
femeyer each had 10 points for
the Trojans.
Up north, California lost to
Washington 85-75 and to
Washington State, 77-63. In the
latter game, Steve Puidokas led
the Cougars with 23 points.
The balance of power seems to
be shifting in the Pacific-8 with
three Northwest schools,
Washington, Washington State
and Oregon tied for the confer
ence lead.
