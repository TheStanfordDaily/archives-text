# Cards swim well in tune-up
## Frosh O'Brien shaves times 
### Jeff Parietti 
The Stanford men's and wo
men's swim squads competed in
the University of California Invi
tational over the weekend. No
scores were kept with the meet
serving primarily as a time trial,
from which Card coaches Jim
Gaughran and Debbie Meyer can
gauge the swimmers' progress so
far this year.
Gaughran singled out
freshman Tom O'Brien from
Seattle as having had the best
meet.
"He didn't win anything, but
he did some very good times,"
said Gaughran.
O'Brien turned in good efforts
in the 400 IM (4:10.8), the 500
freestyle (4:38.9) and especially
in the 200 butterfly, where his
time of 1:53.9 was close to the
national qualifying mark.
Olympic gold medalist Mike
Bruner won the 1650 yard frees
tyle in 15:44.3 while another

Olympic team member,
freshman Paul Hartloff finished
in 15:48.9. Both Bruner and
Hartloff qualified for the Nation
als.
Stu Corliss also turned in a
good early season time as he
clocked 2:11.1 in the 200
breaststroke.
The women also had some ex
cellent performances, led by the
efforts of Olympic gold medalist
Kim Peyton. Peyton, a freshman
from Portland, Ore., took the
200, 500 and 1500 freestyle
events.
In the 500 free, Peyton bet
tered the national qualifying
standard with her mark of 5:01.7.
Jo Harshbarger, a sophomore
from Bellevue, Wash., and yet
another Olympic veteran,
finished in 5:03.
"I'm very happy with the
progress we're making, consid
ering the type of training we've
been doing," said Gaughran.

According to Meyer, the team
members have been swimming
"between 13,000 and 14,000
yards a day. The training has
been stepped up. During the
Hawaii trip, we were doing
about 10,000 yards a day."
Meyer added that many other
teams are putting a greater em
phasis on distance training in
swimming.
"Of course," said Meyer, "the
kids are complaining of being
tired. But I think that the kids are
doing extremely well and by the
time we taper and get the speed
work, I think you'll see a lot of
personal bests."
Gaughran commented that
most of the team's sprinters are
"hurting" right now because of
the amount of distance work
they have been doing.
"Our swimmers are tired, but
they're in pretty good shape,"
said Gaughran.

said Gaughran.
O'Brien turned in good efforts
in the 400 IM (4:10.8), the 500
freestyle (4:38.9) and especially
in the 200 butterfly, where his
time of 1:53.9 was close to the
national qualifying mark.
Olympic gold medalist Mike
Bruner won the 1650 yard frees
tyle in 15:44.3 while another

Olympic team member,
freshman Paul Hartloff finished
in 15:48.9. Both Bruner and
Hartloff qualified for the Nation
als.
Stu Corliss also turned in a
good early season time as he
clocked 2:11.1 in the 200
breaststroke.
The women also had some ex
cellent performances, led by the
efforts of Olympic gold medalist
Kim Peyton. Peyton, a freshman
from Portland, Ore., took the
200, 500 and 1500 freestyle
events.
In the 500 free, Peyton bet
tered the national qualifying
standard with her mark of 5:01.7.
Jo Harshbarger, a sophomore
from Bellevue, Wash., and yet
another Olympic veteran,
finished in 5:03.
"I'm very happy with the
progress we're making, consid
ering the type of training we've
been doing," said Gaughran.

According to Meyer, the team
members have been swimming
"between 13,000 and 14,000
yards a day. The training has
been stepped up. During the
Hawaii trip, we were doing
about 10,000 yards a day."
Meyer added that many other
teams are putting a greater em
phasis on distance training in
swimming.
"Of course," said Meyer, "the
kids are complaining of being
tired. But I think that the kids are
doing extremely well and by the
time we taper and get the speed
work, I think you'll see a lot of
personal bests."
Gaughran commented that
most of the team's sprinters are
"hurting" right now because of
the amount of distance work
they have been doing.
"Our swimmers are tired, but
they're in pretty good shape,"
said Gaughran.

Freshman Ken Shilling, one of Stanford's top hopefuls in the breaststroke, competed for the first
time this season Saturday in the Cal Invitational. Shilling had been out of the water for nine
weeks with a punctured eardrum he suffered in water polo practice.
The Stanford men's and wo
men's swim squads competed in
the University of California Invi
tational over the weekend. No
scores were kept with the meet
serving primarily as a time trial,
from which Card coaches Jim
Gaughran and Debbie Meyer can
gauge the swimmers' progress so
far this year.
Gaughran singled out
freshman Tom O'Brien from
Seattle as having had the best
meet.
"He didn't win anything, but
he did some very good times,"
said Gaughran.
O'Brien turned in good efforts
