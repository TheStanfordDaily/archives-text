## USC defeats Stanford gymnasts 
### Jeff Wahba 
"We're going to get the whole
gym, some scholarship money,
and a good women's program
next year," gymnastics coach
Sadao Hamada exclaimed in the
middle of last Saturday's season
opening gymnastics meet
against USC in the Encina Gym.
Clearly, winning wasn't on his
mind as much as the bright fu
ture of the gymnastic team.
Stanford lost before the meet
started. The Cardinals could not
field full contingents of four in
two of the six events, the parallel
bars and the horizontal bars. The
best four scores in each event are
taken and USC had six men in
each event.
The Trojans made it official,
188.15 to 158.25.
But Hamada had much to be
happy about. Freshman Tad Bos
tick, competing in his first col
legiate meet, took the all-around
title by compiling a 48.6 out of
60 points in the six events.
All-around guy
"1 felt a lot of pressure and was
pretty nervous," said Bostick
after his first meet. "I'm pretty
surprised I took the all-around
title, but we've been working
pretty hard and Hamada is a
great coach."
Hamada was equally pleased.
"It was the first time I had seen
Tad in competition and so I
didn't know what to expect.
Now I believe he has a good fu
ture in NCAA competition."

After the first two events, the
floor exercises and the pommel
horse. USC was ahead of the
Cards, 63.6 to 62.0. Luckily the
Cardinals were able to field at
least four participants in both
events. Stanford's success was
highlighted by sophomore Chris
Takimoto on the pommel horse.
"My 9.3 (out of 10) is better
than any score last year,"
Takimoto said. "And consider
ing it was the first meet I'm very
happy."
Takimoto, coming off a sixth
place finish in the pommel horse
in last year's Pac-8 champion
ships commented, "My goal this
year is to finish in the top three
in the Pac-8 so I'll be eligible for
the NCAA championships."

A surprise for Hamada was Al
Nemcek's 9.1 in the long horse
topping the field. "Al has shown
a lot of determination and he got
off a really nice vault," Hamada
said.
Farb out
Missing in the Cardinal roster
was junior Bobby Farb, a 10th
place finisher in the U.S. Olym
pic Trials. "Bobby is getting over
a wrist injury and we've decided
to redshirt him this year so he'll
be eligible to compete the fol
lowing two years. Teamwise
and because of his wrists it just
doesn't make any sense pushing
him into competition this year,"
Hamada said.
The Cardinals have just four
remaining meets and only one at

home against UCLA on Jan. 28.
"Why schedule more meets
when 1 don't have enough qual
ity gymnasts to field a full
team?" Hamada questioned.
"We'll be sending some of our
better gymnasts to invitational
meets throughout the year."
But Hamada continually em
phasized that it will be different
next year.
"The university has decided
to commit themselves to the
gymnastics program. We're get
ting the ent ire Enci na gym and at
least a couple more scholarships
plus a lot of promising pros
pects."
As an afterthought he added.
"It's what I've been dreaming
about for the last five vears."
