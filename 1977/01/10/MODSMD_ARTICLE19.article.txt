# Grapplers down Puget Sound

The Humboldt State wrestlers
pinned the only loss on their
Cardinal visitors Saturday after
noon, proving to be poor hosts
indeed at their four school invi
tational tournament in Areata.
But the Stanford strongmen
proved a thing or two as well as
they headed southward yester
day with a 2-1 record for the day
and a 4-4 overall standing.
"They really did an outstand
ing job in all the matches," said
varsity coach Joe DeMeo. "We
did well to beat a surprisingly

fine University of Fuget Sound
team, and 1 was pleased that the
guys made it a nice win over
Davis.
Humboldt, after grappling its
way to a seventh place ranking
on the national mat charts, ran
up a frightening score over the
Cards. But the 34-3 win for the
"terrific" Lumberjacks was fil
led with "so many exciting
matches that we came so close to
winning."
Cary Lynn suffered his first
loss in a thrilling bout against
last year's West Coast champion
Chris Henty. Stanford's Craig
Reynolds, now 6-2, was barely
out-squirmed by his Humboldt
rival in another particularly ex
citing round.
DeMeo cited other stars in the
Cards' two victories. Mike
Gabors, tipping the scales at 190
pounds, was outweighed fifty
five pounds by his opponent
from Fuget Sound, but his nar
row 6-3 loss salvaged the 24-23
Washington match for Stanford.
Stanford who would have ended
up underneath had the Norwest
ern heavyweight registered a
pin.
"Brad Bartanen certainly
made a big difference in the

Davis contest," DeMeo com
mented of the 30-19 victory. The
tenacious 126 pounder won by a
fall in his impressive upset of the
Aggies' Ted Anagnos.
Coach DeMeo's Cards, who re
turned yesterday afternoon from
their long coastal sojourn, take to
the road again next weekend to
wrestle in Bakersfield's Califor
