# Ethnic criteria dropped
## Law School changes aid policy 
### Elizabeth Pollock Staff writer 
The Law School faculty here voted
last month to eliminate racial and
ethnic criteria from its financial aid
process because "a legal decision in
the district court (Flanagan vs.
Georgetown University) held that
award of financial aid on the basis of
race was a violation of the law," ac
cording to the Law School dean.
A report from the Admissions
Committee to the law school faculty
outlined the new program under
which all students will be expected to
fulfill approximately the first $2000 of
need from loan sources. Remaining
needs will be fulfilled with grant
monies up to approximately the an
nual tuition level.
Overall, grants will provideabout 50

per cent of aid, but individuals may
receive varying percentages of their
aid in grant form.
Charles Meyers, dean of the Law
School, said, however, that "minority
scholarship holders (who generally
have higher need) are in the same posi
tion under the new formula as under
the old." The new program will apply
only to students entering after the cur
rent academic year.

Analysis

The "maximum allowable need" of
an unmarried student who has no un
usual expenses, who receives no sup
port from his family or like sources,
and who practices relatively stringent
economy for academic year 1975-76
was approximately $6500, according

to the report.
"The specific rates, brackets and
limits that would be applied each year
would depend on the available funds,
the total amount of need of the applic
ants, and the current cost of attending
the school," the report said.
However, calculations of the stu
dent's resources "will remain an ad
ministrative decision of the admis
sions staff," the report continued.
About one-fourth of the non-minority
students in this year's first-year class
are receiving financial aid, and 14 of
the 16 minority students are receiving
aid.
Theoretically, the new program
should attract a few more students
who have relatively large financial
need and fewer of those who have rela
tively small financial needs, according
to the report. However, the effects of
this on final class composition both
financially and academically remains
inconclusive.
Another consideration was that the
Law School remain competitive with
comparable institutions. According to
the report, "our financial aid offers to
substantially all minority students and
to most non-minority students, both
under the old aid program and under
the one now proposed by the majority,

are at least as generous as those of rival
institutions and often far more gener
ous."
The report explained that, "the
Committee proceeded on the tacit
premise that differential treatment
based on racial criteria, as endorsed by
a majority of the Faculty some years
ago, has been an appropriate course of
action and that the only reason for al
tering that course stems from a prag
matic response to its possible illegal
ity."
According to the report, "the Com
mittee found it possible to identify
criteria for allocating financial aid
which were racially neutral, finan
cially and educationally sound and
which did not, in their operational ef
fects, significantly reduce the level of
aid to be provided to minority stu
dents."
However, a dissenting opinion ex
pressed by some committee members
about the premise was footnoted: "dif
ferential treatments of groups by
reason of racial characteristics,
whether of the direct or reverse vari
ety, is wrong in principle and accord
ingly (that) every aspect of our prefe
rential admissions and financial aid
practices should be abandoned."

need and fewer of those who have rela
tively small financial needs, according
to the report. However, the effects of
this on final class composition both
financially and academically remains
inconclusive.
Another consideration was that the
Law School remain competitive with
comparable institutions. According to
the report, "our financial aid offers to
substantially all minority students and
to most non-minority students, both
under the old aid program and under
the one now proposed by the majority,

are at least as generous as those of rival
institutions and often far more gener
ous."
The report explained that, "the
Committee proceeded on the tacit
premise that differential treatment
based on racial criteria, as endorsed by
a majority of the Faculty some years
ago, has been an appropriate course of
action and that the only reason for al
tering that course stems from a prag
matic response to its possible illegal
ity."
According to the report, "the Com
mittee found it possible to identify
criteria for allocating financial aid
which were racially neutral, finan
cially and educationally sound and
which did not, in their operational ef
fects, significantly reduce the level of
aid to be provided to minority stu
dents."
However, a dissenting opinion ex
pressed by some committee members
about the premise was footnoted: "dif
ferential treatments of groups by
reason of racial characteristics,
whether of the direct or reverse vari
ety, is wrong in principle and accord
ingly (that) every aspect of our prefe
rential admissions and financial aid
practices should be abandoned."

The Law School faculty here voted
last month to eliminate racial and
ethnic criteria from its financial aid
process because "a legal decision in
the district court (Flanagan vs.
Georgetown University) held that
award of financial aid on the basis of
race was a violation of the law," ac
cording to the Law School dean.
A report from the Admissions
Committee to the law school faculty
outlined the new program under
which all students will be expected to
fulfill approximately the first $2000 of
need from loan sources. Remaining
needs will be fulfilled with grant
monies up to approximately the an
nual tuition level.
Overall, grants will provideabout 50

per cent of aid, but individuals may
receive varying percentages of their
aid in grant form.
Charles Meyers, dean of the Law
School, said, however, that "minority
scholarship holders (who generally
have higher need) are in the same posi
tion under the new formula as under
the old." The new program will apply
only to students entering after the cur
rent academic year.

Analysis

The "maximum allowable need" of
an unmarried student who has no un
usual expenses, who receives no sup
port from his family or like sources,
and who practices relatively stringent
economy for academic year 1975-76
was approximately $6500, according

to the report.
"The specific rates, brackets and
limits that would be applied each year
would depend on the available funds,
the total amount of need of the applic
ants, and the current cost of attending
the school," the report said.
However, calculations of the stu
dent's resources "will remain an ad
ministrative decision of the admis
sions staff," the report continued.
About one-fourth of the non-minority
students in this year's first-year class
are receiving financial aid, and 14 of
the 16 minority students are receiving
aid.
Theoretically, the new program
should attract a few more students
who have relatively large financial
need and fewer of those who have rela
tively small financial needs, according
to the report. However, the effects of
this on final class composition both
financially and academically remains
inconclusive.
