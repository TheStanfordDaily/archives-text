Raiders crush Vikings, 32-14
Pasadena — Ken Stabler directed an Oakland
attack that set a Super Bowl offensive record,
keyed by Clarence Davis' 137 yards rushing, as
the Raiders destroyed the Minnesota Vikings
32-14 yesterday.
The victory in Super Bowl XI was Oakland's
first National Football League championship in
two tries. For the frustrated Vikings, it was the
fourth loss in as many appearances.
A record Super Bowl crowd of 100,421 jam
med the Rose Bowl Stadium to watch the Raid
ers pick the Vikings apart with slashing runs by
Davis and pinpoint passing by Stabler that left
the Minnesota defense helpless.
The Raiders produced 429 yards in total of
fense, smashing theSuper Bowl record of 358 set
by Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers in the
very first Super Bowl a decade ago.
Millions gather to honor Chou
Tokyo — An estimated one million people
thronged Peking's main square yesterday to
honor the memory of Premier Chou En-lai, and
new wall posters appeared demanding that
Chou's disgraced protege Teng Hsiao-ping be
made premier, the Japanese news agency Kyodo
reported from the Chinese capital.
The Japanese newspaper Asahi said that some
people, braving 25-degree temperatures,
brought their children and others took photo
graphs as students and workers carrying pic
tures of Chou stood in ranks, their hats off, sing
ing revolutionary songs.
Kyodo reported that wall posters calling for
Teng's reinstatement had been well received
Saturday by crowds that gathered in vast Tien
An Men Square to mark the first anniversary of
Chou's death.
Kyodo said thousands of wreaths memorializ
ing Chou were in the square yesterday, along
with wall posters demanding punishment for
those responsible for quelling riots in the square
last April.
The rioting broke out after similar wreaths
honoring Chou were removed. Radical leaders
blamed the rioting on Teng, then a vice premier,
and he was ousted in disgrace.
More aftershocks may hit Bay area
Berkeley — A seismologist said yesterday that
a few light earthquakes probably will shake the
San Francisco Bay area in the wake of a swarm of
temblors, one the area's strongest in a decade.
Bruce Bolt, director of the University of

California Seismology Station, said it is likely "a
few more shocks will occur in the next few
days."
Another UC seismologitst said aftershocks of
the series of eight quakes Friday night and
Saturday morning will most likely be so weak
that only seismographs or persons living very
close to the epicenter will detect them "All we
can do is wait and see," he said.
The series of weekend quakes, centered bet
ween Berkeley and nearby Walnut Creek,
awakened thousands of residents and jammed
police switchboards. No injuries and virtually
no damage were reported, although the shake
was felt at the western edge of San Francisco, 25
miles away.
One of the quakes, on a nameless fault bet
ween the major Hayward and Calaveras faults,
registered 4.6 on the Richter scale at 1:38 a.m.
Saturday. A quake of that magnitude is consi
dered strong enough to do moderate damage,
but it was centered in a sparsely populated area.
The other quakes in the series ranged from 2.9
to 4.1 on the scale. More than 40 very small
aftershocks occurred by mid-morning Saturday.
Tax reform tops Carter priority list
New York — A major tax revision program is a
top priority of the new administration and will
probably be submitted to Congress this year,
Treasury Secretary-designate W. Michael Blu
menthal said yesterday.
Blumenthal said that tax proposals an
nounced Friday by the incoming Carter ad
ministration are only "the first step in what we
hope will be a fundamental set of tax reform
proposals to come along, which will impact all
taxpayers."
Although he was reluctant to give a timetable
for the new program, Blumenthal said he ex
pects the proposals to be sent to Congress some
time in 1977 and to be acted upon in 1978.
While he did not detail what he expected the
new plan to contain, Blumenthal defined "tax
retorm"as simplification and said this "is one of
the highest priorities on Gov. Carter's schedule
of what he would like to see done."
Blumenthal said the overall Carter package
will have the effect of giving business incentives
to invest because it will create increased de
mand in the marketplace.
Israel ends investigation
Jerusalem — The Israeli cabinet accepted yes
terday a prosecutor's decision to end an investi
gation into alleged corruption by a cabinet

minister who committeed suicide last week.
But the proscecutor, Attorney General Aharon
Barak, urged that aspects of the police investiga
tion involving other key members of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labor party be con
tinued.
Barak's written opinion on the case, published
by the cabinet, proclaimed that late Housing
Minister Avraham Ofer must be considered leg
ally innocent of the charges since he can no
longer be proven guilty in court.
But the decision by the dead minister's
cabinet colleagues were not expected to dispel
questions in the minds of the Israeli public about
the truth of the charges against Ofer, who de
clared his innocence in a suicide note and then
shot himself with a ,22-caliber pistol last Mon
day.
Lingering doubts of Ofer's innocence could
affect the national elections scheduled for May
17, since Rabin's Labor party was implicated in
the alleged scandal.
Ofer's chief accuser was Haolum Hazeh, a
muckraking newspaper edited by Uri Avneri, a
former leftist member of parliament. Avneri
plans to run for parliament in the May elections.
French agents arrest Arab terrorist
Paris — French counterespionage agents have
arrested a suspected planner of the Palestinian
guerrilla slaying of Israeli athletes at the 1972
Olympic Games in Munich, official sources said
yesterday.
The arrest set oft protests by Palestinian lead
ers. In Tel Aviv, the Israeli government discus
sed asking France to extradite the prisoner.
French sources said that hours after a warrant
arrived from Germany Friday, agents went to a
Paris hotel and seized Mohammed Daoud Au
deh, also known as Abu Daoud.
He was identified as a chief of the Black Sep
tember terrorist group that planned the Munich
raid in which 11 Israelis and four guerrillas were
killed.
The Bavarian state government in Munich,
which issued the warrant, was expected to seek
the extradition of Abu Daoud within the 18-day
limit set by French law.
But an official source in Bonn and a news
paper in Israel suggested West Germany might
welcome an arrangement to send Abu Daoud to
another country because of past terrorist repris
als when Palestinian guerrillas were jailed.
Coalition backs guerrillas
Lusaka, Zamibia — A summit meeting of five

black African states pledged tull support yester
day to the hard-line Patriotic Front of Rhodesian
nationalists, whose guerrillas are fighting to
topple that nation s white minority regime.
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere said the
black states agreed to give "full political, mate
rial and diplomatic support to the Patriotic Front
to enable them to realize their objectives in
Rhodesia." The summit chairman issued a
statement after the two-day meeting ended.
The black nations represented at the summit
were Angola, Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana
and Tanzania, which have provided material
and other support for the Rhodesian guerrillas.
Ford ties up loose ends
Washington —In the final 10 days of his pres
idency, President Gerald Ford is pondering a
number of tough decisions, from amnesty to
gasoline price controls to pay raises for high
government officials.
He also is putting the final touches on his State
of the Union, budget and economic messages
and is promoting his campaign manager, James
Baker, as his choice to head the Republican Na
tional Committee.
Blanket amnesty for Vietnam draft evaders
and deserters has been on Ford's mind since
Dec. 26, when the widow of Sen. Philip Hart
(D-Mich.), asked him to grant such relief.
Ford is not expected to grant blanket amnesty,
but aides said he is considering relief to a few
limited categories of offenders. They said it
might involve restoration of veterans rights to
former servicemen who were wounded in Viet
nam but who later deserted or committed some
other offense that cost them their rights.
Federal energy administrator Frank Zarb said
last week it is highly likely that Ford will act to
remove price controls on gasoline.
On Ford's desk is a recommendation from a
presidential pay panel for substantial salary
raises for members of Congress and for 2500 top
people in government.

French agents arrest Arab terrorist
Paris — French counterespionage agents have
arrested a suspected planner of the Palestinian
guerrilla slaying of Israeli athletes at the 1972
Olympic Games in Munich, official sources said
yesterday.
The arrest set oft protests by Palestinian lead
ers. In Tel Aviv, the Israeli government discus
sed asking France to extradite the prisoner.
French sources said that hours after a warrant
arrived from Germany Friday, agents went to a
Paris hotel and seized Mohammed Daoud Au
deh, also known as Abu Daoud.
He was identified as a chief of the Black Sep
tember terrorist group that planned the Munich
raid in which 11 Israelis and four guerrillas were
killed.
The Bavarian state government in Munich,
which issued the warrant, was expected to seek
the extradition of Abu Daoud within the 18-day
limit set by French law.
But an official source in Bonn and a news
paper in Israel suggested West Germany might
welcome an arrangement to send Abu Daoud to
another country because of past terrorist repris
als when Palestinian guerrillas were jailed.
Coalition backs guerrillas
Lusaka, Zamibia — A summit meeting of five

black African states pledged tull support yester
day to the hard-line Patriotic Front of Rhodesian
nationalists, whose guerrillas are fighting to
topple that nation s white minority regime.
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere said the
black states agreed to give "full political, mate
rial and diplomatic support to the Patriotic Front
to enable them to realize their objectives in
Rhodesia." The summit chairman issued a
statement after the two-day meeting ended.
The black nations represented at the summit
were Angola, Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana
and Tanzania, which have provided material
and other support for the Rhodesian guerrillas.
Ford ties up loose ends
Washington —In the final 10 days of his pres
idency, President Gerald Ford is pondering a
number of tough decisions, from amnesty to
gasoline price controls to pay raises for high
government officials.
He also is putting the final touches on his State
of the Union, budget and economic messages
and is promoting his campaign manager, James
Baker, as his choice to head the Republican Na
tional Committee.
Blanket amnesty for Vietnam draft evaders
and deserters has been on Ford's mind since
Dec. 26, when the widow of Sen. Philip Hart
(D-Mich.), asked him to grant such relief.
Ford is not expected to grant blanket amnesty,
but aides said he is considering relief to a few
limited categories of offenders. They said it
might involve restoration of veterans rights to
former servicemen who were wounded in Viet
nam but who later deserted or committed some
other offense that cost them their rights.
Federal energy administrator Frank Zarb said
last week it is highly likely that Ford will act to
remove price controls on gasoline.
On Ford's desk is a recommendation from a
presidential pay panel for substantial salary
raises for members of Congress and for 2500 top
people in government.

Raiders crush Vikings, 32-14
Pasadena — Ken Stabler directed an Oakland
attack that set a Super Bowl offensive record,
keyed by Clarence Davis' 137 yards rushing, as
the Raiders destroyed the Minnesota Vikings
32-14 yesterday.
The victory in Super Bowl XI was Oakland's
first National Football League championship in
two tries. For the frustrated Vikings, it was the
fourth loss in as many appearances.
A record Super Bowl crowd of 100,421 jam
med the Rose Bowl Stadium to watch the Raid
ers pick the Vikings apart with slashing runs by
Davis and pinpoint passing by Stabler that left
the Minnesota defense helpless.
The Raiders produced 429 yards in total of
fense, smashing theSuper Bowl record of 358 set
by Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers in the
very first Super Bowl a decade ago.
Millions gather to honor Chou
Tokyo — An estimated one million people
thronged Peking's main square yesterday to
honor the memory of Premier Chou En-lai, and
new wall posters appeared demanding that
Chou's disgraced protege Teng Hsiao-ping be
made premier, the Japanese news agency Kyodo
reported from the Chinese capital.
The Japanese newspaper Asahi said that some
people, braving 25-degree temperatures,
brought their children and others took photo
graphs as students and workers carrying pic
tures of Chou stood in ranks, their hats off, sing
ing revolutionary songs.
Kyodo reported that wall posters calling for
Teng's reinstatement had been well received
Saturday by crowds that gathered in vast Tien
An Men Square to mark the first anniversary of
Chou's death.
Kyodo said thousands of wreaths memorializ
ing Chou were in the square yesterday, along
with wall posters demanding punishment for
those responsible for quelling riots in the square
last April.
The rioting broke out after similar wreaths
honoring Chou were removed. Radical leaders
blamed the rioting on Teng, then a vice premier,
and he was ousted in disgrace.
More aftershocks may hit Bay area
Berkeley — A seismologist said yesterday that
a few light earthquakes probably will shake the
San Francisco Bay area in the wake of a swarm of
temblors, one the area's strongest in a decade.
Bruce Bolt, director of the University of

California Seismology Station, said it is likely "a
few more shocks will occur in the next few
days."
Another UC seismologitst said aftershocks of
the series of eight quakes Friday night and
Saturday morning will most likely be so weak
that only seismographs or persons living very
close to the epicenter will detect them "All we
can do is wait and see," he said.
The series of weekend quakes, centered bet
ween Berkeley and nearby Walnut Creek,
awakened thousands of residents and jammed
police switchboards. No injuries and virtually
no damage were reported, although the shake
was felt at the western edge of San Francisco, 25
miles away.
One of the quakes, on a nameless fault bet
ween the major Hayward and Calaveras faults,
registered 4.6 on the Richter scale at 1:38 a.m.
Saturday. A quake of that magnitude is consi
dered strong enough to do moderate damage,
but it was centered in a sparsely populated area.
The other quakes in the series ranged from 2.9
to 4.1 on the scale. More than 40 very small
aftershocks occurred by mid-morning Saturday.
Tax reform tops Carter priority list
New York — A major tax revision program is a
top priority of the new administration and will
probably be submitted to Congress this year,
Treasury Secretary-designate W. Michael Blu
menthal said yesterday.
Blumenthal said that tax proposals an
nounced Friday by the incoming Carter ad
ministration are only "the first step in what we
hope will be a fundamental set of tax reform
proposals to come along, which will impact all
taxpayers."
Although he was reluctant to give a timetable
for the new program, Blumenthal said he ex
pects the proposals to be sent to Congress some
time in 1977 and to be acted upon in 1978.
While he did not detail what he expected the
new plan to contain, Blumenthal defined "tax
retorm"as simplification and said this "is one of
the highest priorities on Gov. Carter's schedule
of what he would like to see done."
Blumenthal said the overall Carter package
will have the effect of giving business incentives
to invest because it will create increased de
mand in the marketplace.
Israel ends investigation
Jerusalem — The Israeli cabinet accepted yes
terday a prosecutor's decision to end an investi
gation into alleged corruption by a cabinet

minister who committeed suicide last week.
But the proscecutor, Attorney General Aharon
Barak, urged that aspects of the police investiga
tion involving other key members of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labor party be con
tinued.
Barak's written opinion on the case, published
by the cabinet, proclaimed that late Housing
Minister Avraham Ofer must be considered leg
ally innocent of the charges since he can no
longer be proven guilty in court.
But the decision by the dead minister's
cabinet colleagues were not expected to dispel
questions in the minds of the Israeli public about
the truth of the charges against Ofer, who de
clared his innocence in a suicide note and then
shot himself with a ,22-caliber pistol last Mon
day.
Lingering doubts of Ofer's innocence could
affect the national elections scheduled for May
17, since Rabin's Labor party was implicated in
the alleged scandal.
Ofer's chief accuser was Haolum Hazeh, a
muckraking newspaper edited by Uri Avneri, a
former leftist member of parliament. Avneri
plans to run for parliament in the May elections.

Another UC seismologitst said aftershocks of
the series of eight quakes Friday night and

that only seismographs or persons living very
close to the epicenter will detect them "All we

awakened thousands of residents and jammed
police switchboards. No injuries and virtually
no damage were reported, although the shake
was felt at the western edge of San Francisco, 25
miles away.
One of the quakes, on a nameless fault bet
ween the major Hayward and Calaveras faults,
registered 4.6 on the Richter scale at 1:38 a.m.
Saturday. A quake of that magnitude is consi
dered strong enough to do moderate damage,
but it was centered in a sparsely populated area.
The other quakes in the series ranged from 2.9
to 4.1 on the scale. More than 40 very small
aftershocks occurred by mid-morning Saturday.
Tax reform tops Carter priority list
New York — A major tax revision program is a
top priority of the new administration and will
probably be submitted to Congress this year,
Treasury Secretary-designate W. Michael Blu
menthal said yesterday.
Blumenthal said that tax proposals an
nounced Friday by the incoming Carter ad
ministration are only "the first step in what we
hope will be a fundamental set of tax reform
proposals to come along, which will impact all
taxpayers."
Although he was reluctant to give a timetable
for the new program, Blumenthal said he ex
pects the proposals to be sent to Congress some
time in 1977 and to be acted upon in 1978.
While he did not detail what he expected the
new plan to contain, Blumenthal defined "tax
retorm"as simplification and said this "is one of
the highest priorities on Gov. Carter's schedule
of what he would like to see done."
Blumenthal said the overall Carter package
will have the effect of giving business incentives
to invest because it will create increased de
mand in the marketplace.
Israel ends investigation
Jerusalem — The Israeli cabinet accepted yes
terday a prosecutor's decision to end an investi
gation into alleged corruption by a cabinet

minister who committeed suicide last week.
But the proscecutor, Attorney General Aharon
Barak, urged that aspects of the police investiga
tion involving other key members of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labor party be con
tinued.
Barak's written opinion on the case, published
by the cabinet, proclaimed that late Housing
Minister Avraham Ofer must be considered leg
ally innocent of the charges since he can no
longer be proven guilty in court.
But the decision by the dead minister's
cabinet colleagues were not expected to dispel
questions in the minds of the Israeli public about
the truth of the charges against Ofer, who de
clared his innocence in a suicide note and then
shot himself with a ,22-caliber pistol last Mon
day.
Lingering doubts of Ofer's innocence could
affect the national elections scheduled for May
17, since Rabin's Labor party was implicated in
the alleged scandal.
Ofer's chief accuser was Haolum Hazeh, a
muckraking newspaper edited by Uri Avneri, a
former leftist member of parliament. Avneri
plans to run for parliament in the May elections.
French agents arrest Arab terrorist
Paris — French counterespionage agents have
arrested a suspected planner of the Palestinian
guerrilla slaying of Israeli athletes at the 1972
Olympic Games in Munich, official sources said
yesterday.
The arrest set oft protests by Palestinian lead
ers. In Tel Aviv, the Israeli government discus
sed asking France to extradite the prisoner.
French sources said that hours after a warrant
arrived from Germany Friday, agents went to a
Paris hotel and seized Mohammed Daoud Au
deh, also known as Abu Daoud.
He was identified as a chief of the Black Sep
tember terrorist group that planned the Munich
raid in which 11 Israelis and four guerrillas were
killed.
The Bavarian state government in Munich,
which issued the warrant, was expected to seek
the extradition of Abu Daoud within the 18-day
limit set by French law.
But an official source in Bonn and a news
paper in Israel suggested West Germany might
welcome an arrangement to send Abu Daoud to
another country because of past terrorist repris
als when Palestinian guerrillas were jailed.
Coalition backs guerrillas
Lusaka, Zamibia — A summit meeting of five

black African states pledged tull support yester
day to the hard-line Patriotic Front of Rhodesian
nationalists, whose guerrillas are fighting to
topple that nation s white minority regime.
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere said the
black states agreed to give "full political, mate
rial and diplomatic support to the Patriotic Front
to enable them to realize their objectives in
Rhodesia." The summit chairman issued a
statement after the two-day meeting ended.
The black nations represented at the summit
were Angola, Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana
and Tanzania, which have provided material
and other support for the Rhodesian guerrillas.
Ford ties up loose ends
Washington —In the final 10 days of his pres
idency, President Gerald Ford is pondering a
number of tough decisions, from amnesty to
gasoline price controls to pay raises for high
government officials.
He also is putting the final touches on his State
of the Union, budget and economic messages
and is promoting his campaign manager, James
Baker, as his choice to head the Republican Na
tional Committee.
Blanket amnesty for Vietnam draft evaders
and deserters has been on Ford's mind since
Dec. 26, when the widow of Sen. Philip Hart
(D-Mich.), asked him to grant such relief.
Ford is not expected to grant blanket amnesty,
but aides said he is considering relief to a few
limited categories of offenders. They said it
might involve restoration of veterans rights to
former servicemen who were wounded in Viet
nam but who later deserted or committed some
other offense that cost them their rights.
Federal energy administrator Frank Zarb said
last week it is highly likely that Ford will act to
remove price controls on gasoline.
On Ford's desk is a recommendation from a
presidential pay panel for substantial salary
raises for members of Congress and for 2500 top
people in government.

Raiders crush Vikings, 32-14
Pasadena — Ken Stabler directed an Oakland
attack that set a Super Bowl offensive record,
keyed by Clarence Davis' 137 yards rushing, as
the Raiders destroyed the Minnesota Vikings
32-14 yesterday.
The victory in Super Bowl XI was Oakland's
first National Football League championship in
two tries. For the frustrated Vikings, it was the
fourth loss in as many appearances.
A record Super Bowl crowd of 100,421 jam
med the Rose Bowl Stadium to watch the Raid
ers pick the Vikings apart with slashing runs by
Davis and pinpoint passing by Stabler that left
the Minnesota defense helpless.
The Raiders produced 429 yards in total of

Millions gather to honor Chou
Tokyo — An estimated one million people
thronged Peking's main square yesterday to
honor the memory of Premier Chou En-lai, and
new wall posters appeared demanding that
Chou's disgraced protege Teng Hsiao-ping be
made premier, the Japanese news agency Kyodo
reported from the Chinese capital.
The Japanese newspaper Asahi said that some
people, braving 25-degree temperatures,
brought their children and others took photo
graphs as students and workers carrying pic
tures of Chou stood in ranks, their hats off, sing
ing revolutionary songs.
Kyodo reported that wall posters calling for
Teng's reinstatement had been well received
Saturday by crowds that gathered in vast Tien
An Men Square to mark the first anniversary of
Chou's death.
Kyodo said thousands of wreaths memorializ
ing Chou were in the square yesterday, along
with wall posters demanding punishment for
those responsible for quelling riots in the square
last April.
The rioting broke out after similar wreaths
honoring Chou were removed. Radical leaders
blamed the rioting on Teng, then a vice premier,
and he was ousted in disgrace.

Dec. 26, when the widow of Sen. Philip Hart
(D-Mich.), asked him to grant such relief.
Ford is not expected to grant blanket amnesty,
but aides said he is considering relief to a few
limited categories of offenders. They said it
might involve restoration of veterans rights to
former servicemen who were wounded in Viet
nam but who later deserted or committed some
other offense that cost them their rights.
Federal energy administrator Frank Zarb said
last week it is highly likely that Ford will act to
remove price controls on gasoline.
On Ford's desk is a recommendation from a
presidential pay panel for substantial salary
raises for members of Congress and for 2500 top
people in government.

Raiders crush Vikings, 32-14
Pasadena — Ken Stabler directed an Oakland
attack that set a Super Bowl offensive record,
keyed by Clarence Davis' 137 yards rushing, as
the Raiders destroyed the Minnesota Vikings
32-14 yesterday.
The victory in Super Bowl XI was Oakland's
first National Football League championship in
two tries. For the frustrated Vikings, it was the
fourth loss in as many appearances.
A record Super Bowl crowd of 100,421 jam
med the Rose Bowl Stadium to watch the Raid
ers pick the Vikings apart with slashing runs by
Davis and pinpoint passing by Stabler that left
the Minnesota defense helpless.
The Raiders produced 429 yards in total of
fense, smashing theSuper Bowl record of 358 set
by Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers in the
very first Super Bowl a decade ago.
Millions gather to honor Chou
Tokyo — An estimated one million people
thronged Peking's main square yesterday to
honor the memory of Premier Chou En-lai, and
new wall posters appeared demanding that
Chou's disgraced protege Teng Hsiao-ping be
made premier, the Japanese news agency Kyodo
reported from the Chinese capital.
The Japanese newspaper Asahi said that some
people, braving 25-degree temperatures,
brought their children and others took photo
graphs as students and workers carrying pic
tures of Chou stood in ranks, their hats off, sing
ing revolutionary songs.
Kyodo reported that wall posters calling for
Teng's reinstatement had been well received
Saturday by crowds that gathered in vast Tien
An Men Square to mark the first anniversary of
Chou's death.
Kyodo said thousands of wreaths memorializ
ing Chou were in the square yesterday, along
with wall posters demanding punishment for
those responsible for quelling riots in the square
last April.
The rioting broke out after similar wreaths
honoring Chou were removed. Radical leaders
blamed the rioting on Teng, then a vice premier,
and he was ousted in disgrace.
More aftershocks may hit Bay area
Berkeley — A seismologist said yesterday that
a few light earthquakes probably will shake the
San Francisco Bay area in the wake of a swarm of
temblors, one the area's strongest in a decade.
Bruce Bolt, director of the University of

California Seismology Station, said it is likely "a
few more shocks will occur in the next few
days."
Another UC seismologitst said aftershocks of
the series of eight quakes Friday night and
Saturday morning will most likely be so weak
that only seismographs or persons living very
close to the epicenter will detect them "All we
can do is wait and see," he said.
The series of weekend quakes, centered bet
ween Berkeley and nearby Walnut Creek,
awakened thousands of residents and jammed
police switchboards. No injuries and virtually
no damage were reported, although the shake
was felt at the western edge of San Francisco, 25
miles away.
One of the quakes, on a nameless fault bet
ween the major Hayward and Calaveras faults,
registered 4.6 on the Richter scale at 1:38 a.m.
Saturday. A quake of that magnitude is consi
dered strong enough to do moderate damage,
but it was centered in a sparsely populated area.
The other quakes in the series ranged from 2.9
to 4.1 on the scale. More than 40 very small
aftershocks occurred by mid-morning Saturday.
Tax reform tops Carter priority list
New York — A major tax revision program is a
top priority of the new administration and will
probably be submitted to Congress this year,
Treasury Secretary-designate W. Michael Blu
menthal said yesterday.
Blumenthal said that tax proposals an
nounced Friday by the incoming Carter ad
ministration are only "the first step in what we
hope will be a fundamental set of tax reform
proposals to come along, which will impact all
taxpayers."
Although he was reluctant to give a timetable
for the new program, Blumenthal said he ex
pects the proposals to be sent to Congress some
time in 1977 and to be acted upon in 1978.
While he did not detail what he expected the
new plan to contain, Blumenthal defined "tax
retorm"as simplification and said this "is one of
the highest priorities on Gov. Carter's schedule
of what he would like to see done."
Blumenthal said the overall Carter package
will have the effect of giving business incentives
to invest because it will create increased de
mand in the marketplace.
Israel ends investigation
Jerusalem — The Israeli cabinet accepted yes
terday a prosecutor's decision to end an investi
gation into alleged corruption by a cabinet

minister who committeed suicide last week.
But the proscecutor, Attorney General Aharon
Barak, urged that aspects of the police investiga
tion involving other key members of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labor party be con
tinued.
Barak's written opinion on the case, published
by the cabinet, proclaimed that late Housing
Minister Avraham Ofer must be considered leg
ally innocent of the charges since he can no
longer be proven guilty in court.
But the decision by the dead minister's
cabinet colleagues were not expected to dispel
questions in the minds of the Israeli public about
the truth of the charges against Ofer, who de
clared his innocence in a suicide note and then
shot himself with a ,22-caliber pistol last Mon
day.
Lingering doubts of Ofer's innocence could
affect the national elections scheduled for May
17, since Rabin's Labor party was implicated in
the alleged scandal.
Ofer's chief accuser was Haolum Hazeh, a
muckraking newspaper edited by Uri Avneri, a
former leftist member of parliament. Avneri
plans to run for parliament in the May elections.
French agents arrest Arab terrorist
Paris — French counterespionage agents have
arrested a suspected planner of the Palestinian
guerrilla slaying of Israeli athletes at the 1972
Olympic Games in Munich, official sources said
yesterday.
The arrest set oft protests by Palestinian lead
ers. In Tel Aviv, the Israeli government discus
sed asking France to extradite the prisoner.
French sources said that hours after a warrant
arrived from Germany Friday, agents went to a
Paris hotel and seized Mohammed Daoud Au
deh, also known as Abu Daoud.
He was identified as a chief of the Black Sep
tember terrorist group that planned the Munich
raid in which 11 Israelis and four guerrillas were
killed.
The Bavarian state government in Munich,
which issued the warrant, was expected to seek
the extradition of Abu Daoud within the 18-day
limit set by French law.
But an official source in Bonn and a news
paper in Israel suggested West Germany might
welcome an arrangement to send Abu Daoud to
another country because of past terrorist repris
als when Palestinian guerrillas were jailed.
Coalition backs guerrillas
Lusaka, Zamibia — A summit meeting of five

black African states pledged tull support yester
day to the hard-line Patriotic Front of Rhodesian
nationalists, whose guerrillas are fighting to
topple that nation s white minority regime.
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere said the
black states agreed to give "full political, mate
rial and diplomatic support to the Patriotic Front
to enable them to realize their objectives in
Rhodesia." The summit chairman issued a
statement after the two-day meeting ended.
The black nations represented at the summit
were Angola, Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana
and Tanzania, which have provided material
and other support for the Rhodesian guerrillas.
Ford ties up loose ends
Washington —In the final 10 days of his pres

number of tough decisions, from amnesty to
