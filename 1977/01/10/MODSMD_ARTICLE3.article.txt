# Congress considers cabinet hopefuls
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€”With only 10 days
left before a new administration takes
over, Congress divides its attention
this week between President-elect
Jimmy Carter's choices for the Cabinet
and President Gerald Ford's final State
of the Union message.
Beginning today and continuing
through Thursday, senate committees
will question nine Carter appointees,
clearing the way for quick action when
the incoming president formally sub
mits the names to the Senate after his
inauguration Jan. 20.
Ford's valedictory message will be
delivered to a joint session of the
House and Senate at 6 p.m. PST Wed
nesday. The heavily Democratic Con
gress is expected to listen politely but
put aside any recommendations while
considering Carter's program.
The House, where Democratic lead
ers have promised to move quickly on
Carter's proposals to stimulate the
economy, gears up for legislation by
reconstituting its committees. A series
of caucuses on committee nominees by
the majority Democrats begins tomor
row.
The Senate has begun what one
member calls the painful process of

overhauling its committee structure
for the first time in 30 years.
Sen. Adlai Stevenson (D-lll.), who
was chairman of the panel that drafted
the proposed reorganization, has ap
pealed for each senator to put aside his
individual advantages in the interest
of making the senate as a whole more
effective.
"This reorganization process is a
painful one," Stevenson told the Se
nate Rules Committee, which is hold
ing hearings on the proposals and
must submit its recommendations by
Jan. 19.
Since the last major overhaul of se
nate committees 30 years ago, said
Sen. Herman Talmadge (D-Ga.), the
cost of operating the senate has in
creased over 2000 per cent and the
number of employes has grown by 335
per cent.
The plan would reduce the number
of senate committees from 31 to 15 and
have the effect of cutting subcommit
tees from 174 to about 100. It also
would rearrange and consolidate the
legislative authority of the committees
and limit the number of committees on
which senators may serve and hold
