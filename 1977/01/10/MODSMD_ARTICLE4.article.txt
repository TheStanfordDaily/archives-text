### Robert Mauro Staff writer 
Six local "adult-oriented" estab
lishments, closed in an early morning
raid Dec. 3, have been returned to the
property owners according to Palo
Alto Police Capt. Gary Tatum, but
none have reopened.
Deputy District Atty» Dan Palmer
said that the properties formerly
known as the Streaker, Magnifique,
Pleasure Palace and Green Door have
been returned to their owners, Joseph
and Diana Chew, in accordance with a
Dec. 20 order issued by Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge Peter
Anello.
The order enjoins the Chews from
operating a sexually oriented estab
lishment as a condition for the return
of their property. The Chews had pre
viously said that they would agree to
abide by such a provision.
According to Santa Clara County
Superior Court records. Don Louden,

who had leased the properties from the
Chews, had been evicted on Dec. 1 and
the sublease holders given 30 days to
vacate the premises.
Advance notification given
According to Tatum, however, the
Chews were notified of the possibility
of court action against their property
eight months before the raid.
"They (the Chews) were advised of
our action in March," said Tatum.
Joseph Chew said that a real estate
agency is presently seeking "good ten
ants, not in that type of business" for
his property.
Linda's, owned by Linda Douglas,
and Diana's Health Studio, owned by
her husband Cordon Douglas, were al
lowed to reopen by court order. How
ever, the owners of the property had
already regained possession of them
and refused to relet to the Douglases.
According to Tatum. Douglas sub
mitted a check to him to cover the mis
cellaneous costs involved in chanuinu

the locks and confiscating and storing
her property. After the cost of chang
ing the locks had been deducted, she
was informed that the property owners
had already obtained both sets of the
new keys. The lease for Linda's ex
pired on Jan. 5. Diana's lost its lease
last month.
No licenses obtained
Two other parlors, Athena's at 3777
El Camino and Royal Massage at 2437
Birch, were also allowed to reopen by
court order, but according to the Palo
Alto Times, did not meet the condition
that they have a city massage parlor
license.
In a related development, Palmer
said that appeals will be heard today
on behalf of Phillip Skinner and James
Hunt, owners of the Streaker and
Copenhagen, two theaters closed in
the raid. The action is being taken in an
effort to lift the Santa Clara County
Superior Court's temporary restrain
ing order.

ing order.
Six local "adult-oriented" estab
lishments, closed in an early morning
raid Dec. 3, have been returned to the
property owners according to Palo
Alto Police Capt. Gary Tatum, but
none have reopened.
Deputy District Atty» Dan Palmer
said that the properties formerly
known as the Streaker, Magnifique,
Pleasure Palace and Green Door have
been returned to their owners, Joseph
and Diana Chew, in accordance with a
Dec. 20 order issued by Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge Peter
Anello.
The order enjoins the Chews from
operating a sexually oriented estab
lishment as a condition for the return
of their property. The Chews had pre
viously said that they would agree to
abide by such a provision.
According to Santa Clara County
Superior Court records. Don Louden,

who had leased the properties from the
Chews, had been evicted on Dec. 1 and
the sublease holders given 30 days to
vacate the premises.
Advance notification given
According to Tatum, however, the
Chews were notified of the possibility
of court action against their property
eight months before the raid.
"They (the Chews) were advised of
our action in March," said Tatum.
Joseph Chew said that a real estate
agency is presently seeking "good ten
ants, not in that type of business" for
his property.
Linda's, owned by Linda Douglas,
and Diana's Health Studio, owned by
her husband Cordon Douglas, were al
lowed to reopen by court order. How
ever, the owners of the property had
already regained possession of them
and refused to relet to the Douglases.
According to Tatum. Douglas sub
mitted a check to him to cover the mis
cellaneous costs involved in chanuinu

the locks and confiscating and storing
her property. After the cost of chang
ing the locks had been deducted, she
was informed that the property owners
had already obtained both sets of the
new keys. The lease for Linda's ex
pired on Jan. 5. Diana's lost its lease
last month.
No licenses obtained
Two other parlors, Athena's at 3777
El Camino and Royal Massage at 2437
Birch, were also allowed to reopen by
court order, but according to the Palo
Alto Times, did not meet the condition
that they have a city massage parlor
license.
In a related development, Palmer
said that appeals will be heard today
on behalf of Phillip Skinner and James
Hunt, owners of the Streaker and
Copenhagen, two theaters closed in
the raid. The action is being taken in an
effort to lift the Santa Clara County
Superior Court's temporary restrain
ing order.
