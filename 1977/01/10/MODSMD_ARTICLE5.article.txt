# Cliveden, Berlin futures in doubt
## 
### Elizabeth Pollock Kath Scanlon 
The fate of several Stanford overseas
campuses remains in jeopardy as the
university attempts to keep them
operating while maintaining a ba
lanced budget back home.
According to Robert Smith, one of
the leaders of the Save Cliveden Com
mittee, "reliable sources" have told
him si nee the beginning of the quarter
that either Cliveden will remain open
or there will be no overseas campus in
Great Britain at all.
London and Oxford have been ruled
out as possible alternative sites for the
program in England, Smith said.
"There's been no final decision, but
as far as we can tell, they've ruled out
London and Oxford because they
would be prohibitively expensive,"
Smith said.
Corb Smith, assistant director of
Overseas Studies, said last week that
"no decisions have been made at all"
concerning moving the Cliveden cam
pus. He added that there has been no
further action on an overseas campus
in Mexico.
"The question is how to get the

budget reduced. We would like to have
a campus in Mexico or a Latin Ameri
can country, but there's no money for
one." he said.
Position paper
The Save Cliveden Committee has
appointed a subcommittee to write a
position paper to address the issue of
keeping Cliveden in operation, ac
cording to Robert Smith.
"More money should be come up
with, or a different program cut, but
Cliveden is one of the more worth
while programs," he said. He added
that the paper should be done by
Thursday, taken to the committee for
approval and will be presented to
"anyone who'll hear us."
"I think they're going to decide
(whether to keep the campus at Clive
den) after Mancall (Mark Mancall, di
rector of Overseas Studies) comes back
from Europe," Robert Smith con
tinued.
He said the committee, made up
of 25 or 30 interested students, feels
the Britain program is important,
"especially since the Faculty Senate
has reinstated the Western Civ re
quirement.
Berlin hanging on
Stanford-in-Berlin will be con
tinued through 1978 if the city of Ber
lin will continue its present rental ag
reement with the university and if the
university will provide the necessary
$82,000-85,000 of general funds
money, Corb Smith said yesterday.
Annual cost of the program is about
$150,000, but costs have remained low
because the city of Berlin has been
"giving us the villa essentially rent
free," he said. Office and class
room space for Stanford-in-Berlin is
located in the architecturally signific
ant Villa Muthesius in southwest Ber
lin.
In order to continue the program for
this year, the university had to provide
about $80,000 of general funds money.
The remainder of the budget comes
from students' room and board pay
ments. Costs include rent and salaries
plus students' room, board and trans
portation.
General funds money for next year's
program "would have to come from
the university," Smith said. He specu
lated that to cut rent expenses, and
thus the amount of funds needed,
some students might be expected to
live in the village. However, he said, "1
guess it's an open question whether
the students would be living in the
villa," he added.
Stanford-in-Berlin's future will not
be decided for some time yet, but
Overseas Director Mark Mancall ar
rived in Berlin Friday and plans to
meet with city officials this week.
