## Letter: ASSU Senate 
### 
1 hope that when it is election time
here again, both this spring and next
fall, students are able to look past the
promises on the posters which are
plastered all over the bathrooms and
remember that the senator who prom
ised us that he only had our interests at
heart has proven there is such a thing

as a free lunch and that one may try to
use the ASSU Senate as a stepping
stone to the Council of Presidents; that
the members of the slate who promised
us that "this time our voice will be
heard" and that "special interest
groups would have no influence in the
Senate" are drowning us out with their

voices expressing their own interests
in what have become petty personal
conflicts with the other senators; and
that the slate which promised to do
nothing and who said they really
didn't want to win is actually coming
to meetings and participating.
I realize that student politics and
government are patterned after those
on the national level to a certain ex
tent, yet I had rather hoped that Stan
ford's ASSU Senate would exclude
grandstanding, the pitting of special
interest against special interest, failure
to keep campaign promises, and other
less-than-honorable political antics
we have grown so disgusted with on
the state and national level.
Although the senate happenings
make entertaining reading in the
Daily, these people have the responsi
bility of making important decisions
that greatly affect the student body,
and in the end, it is the senators who
are laughing at us.
