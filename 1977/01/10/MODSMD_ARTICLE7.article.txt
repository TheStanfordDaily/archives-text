Beware the jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite,
the claws that catch!

Through the Looking-glass
An open letter to all my friends back
at Cliveden:
Stay where you are! Don't comeback
to this crazy campus any sooner than
you must. Enjoy the peace and serenity
of British life while you can.
I returned last week from my 14-unit
vacation cheerfully anticipating the
welcoming embraces of friends and
the challenge of actual schoolwork. I
was naive.
My friends greeted me cheerfully.
But Stanford did everything it could to
make the reunion a painful one.
Most of us learn, eventually, to out
wit the Stanford System.
I don't mean cheating; I mean keep
ing the computer from assigning us to
the Redwood City YMCA.
Or making sure we aren't billed for a
magazine that someone else lost in
1947.
One guy I know is so far ahead of the
game that he actually turned down a
housing assignment to 558 Mayfield
so he could stay in his frat.
But it is easy to dull the fine edge of
your vorpal sword. Spend a few
months in a relaxed non-computerized
society and you drop your guard.
I came back unprepared to do battle
and the red tape won most of the
rounds.
Three nights without sheets — or
towels — were just the joyous begin
ning. No coat hangers in the closet.
The three classes I had pre
registered for were all closed. And
they were all required for my major.
One list had me marked as a non
major in that department.
By the end of the first day of classes I
was enrolled in one — independent
study in photography.
So I went to visit my adviser. He
wasn't there.
I told my story to a friend. He told me
my adviser is on sabbatical. Neat.
Next day I tried a psych course be
cause another friend recommended
the professor. The recommended pro
fessor is on leave.
I got in a few punches: I was handed
my old library job with no hesitation.
But I was also handed three newly
printed pamphlets of rules and regula
tions and no-nos for library employes.
I sailed safely through the engineer
ing corner traffic — no hands — at 11
a.m. and felt confident that some
things never change. But 30 seconds
later 1 sailed down my favorite back
route to Psycho4oand slammed into a
newly-erected cyclone fence.
I tried to deposit a check at the bank
and forgot to fill out a deposit slip. I

corrected my error and stepped up to
the window, only to encounter a sign
saying "Check cashing only."
One week later, things were improv
ing slightly. I have 11 units and 11 coat
hangers.
It's great to be back. When's the next
charter to London?
