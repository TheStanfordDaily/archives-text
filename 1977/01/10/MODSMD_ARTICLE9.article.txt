# Profit motive leads TV to highlight crime, sexism
## 
### 
Network television has finally
proven that no low is too low to stoop
to if stooping means profiting.
The network bill of fare shows an
astonishing sameness of content. Un
fortunately, this sameness focuses on
violence, promiscuity and disregard
for common decency.
This is not an old-fashioned moralis
tic objection. It is instead an assess
ment based on common sense. Vio
lence and sexual crime have sky
rocketed in recent years. Regard for life
and human welfare has taken a propor
tionate downward plunge.
Television can be held accountable
for at least some of this.
A case in point is the Police Story
program aired on Tuesday, Nov. 30.
The plot of the story centered on the
police officers of the "mid-watch," a
group of officers with a reputation for
poor police work and "goofing off."
Two patrolmen of the "mid-watch"
pull over a pair of stewardesses for a
traffic violation. Immediately they are
able to arrange sexual "dates" with
them, even though one of the officers is
married.
When his wife learns of his infidel
ity, by the long scratch marks on his
back, she throws him out of the house.
He is able to rent a house on the prop
erty of an aged woman on his beat who
heroizes police officers.
Soon he is joined by other members
of the "mid-watch," and the house is
dubbed "Monster Manor." For these
law enforcement officers, every night
is party night, with raucous music,
heavy drinking, and a different female
sex partner. As soon as they adopt this
life-style, their official performance of
police work takes a radical turn for the
better. They apprehend criminals right
and left. Their superiors are as
tounded.
The philandering officer tries to
convince his wife to take him back, but
somehow she cannot, especially when
she comes over and finds his latest
bedmate.
When vice squad members of the

police force, who, incidentally are not
interested in their fellow officers'
vices, ask to use the "Monster Manor"
to arrest a group of masseuse/call girls,
the "mid-watch" officers cooperate by
visiting their elderly landlady. While
there, they are barely able to hide their
contempt for her, her art objects and
her tea. They are straining at the win-

dow to see the "squeezes" or "broads"
get arrested when they respond to the
request from the vice squad for "mas
sages."
When the prostitutes' pimp arrives,
he is, predictably, black.
For cooperating in the bust, the
"Monster Manor" officers receive
glowing commendations from the vice
squad and their own superiors.
The policeman thrown out of his
home by his wife is able to reconcile
with her. As he packs his gear to go
home, the other "mid-watch" officers
predict he will be back. When he de
nies it, they call after him, "You're

married, not dead."
The story of this program has several
messages.
The first is that policemen have no
more regard for law enforcement and
decency than do the criminals they ar
rest.
The second message is that promis
cuity and heavy drinking are not vices,
but virtues, since they obviously im
prove job performance.
The third is that most women are
sexually available, which is all right as
long as they don't charge for it. Wives
are portrayed as shrewish and homely.
Elderly women are shown as boring
old fools. The woman officer on the
force is referred to as the "department
iceberg," because she refuses to have
sexual relations with male officers,
thereby deserving ridicule.
The fourth message is that marriage
should present no barriers to promis
cuity, and that promiscuity and heavy
drinking prove one is "not dead."
The fifth message is that minorities
are criminals.
Unfortunately, this particular prog
ram is not unique in the field of net
work programming. On another net
work earlier in the evening, one saw
LaVerne and Shirley forgive and offer
to be the friends of a disgruntled suitor
who wrote their telephone number on
a men's bathroom wall.
So what if they received 40 obscene
phone calls? So what if two men came
to ostensibly "date" them and wound
up trying to rape them?
Network programmers would like
you to believe that their shows don't
have adverse effects on viewers. Well,
they certainly have been able to con
vince advertisers that commercials are
effective. How can they expect anyone
to believe that glorification of crimi
nality, violence and loveless sex are
without effect on the public?
There has been a great deal of public
outcry against the recent upsurge in
crime. All violent crimes have shown
rapid increase in the past few years.
But the same people who deplore

crime in reality are avid television
consumers of crime as they see it on
their home screens.
If crime in actual life is so horrible,
why are so many people willing to
watch it on television? Is it possible
that viewers are growing callous, un
caring? How long will deep regard for
human life last if it is degraded and
thrown away nightly on television
sets, which nearly 98 per cent of the
population possess?
Viewed violence incites children to

aggression, according to researchers.
And we too often read of actual crimes
which were based on last night's crime
drama plotline.
But the networks are making money
by using sex and violence as staple fare
on television. And we will continue to
be deluged by these two sure-fire
profit-makers as long as they bring in
the profits.

Network television has finally
proven that no low is too low to stoop
to if stooping means profiting.
The network bill of fare shows an
astonishing sameness of content. Un
fortunately, this sameness focuses on
violence, promiscuity and disregard
for common decency.
This is not an old-fashioned moralis
tic objection. It is instead an assess
ment based on common sense. Vio
lence and sexual crime have sky
rocketed in recent years. Regard for life
and human welfare has taken a propor
tionate downward plunge.
Television can be held accountable
for at least some of this.
A case in point is the Police Story
program aired on Tuesday, Nov. 30.
The plot of the story centered on the
police officers of the "mid-watch," a
group of officers with a reputation for
poor police work and "goofing off."
Two patrolmen of the "mid-watch"
pull over a pair of stewardesses for a
traffic violation. Immediately they are
able to arrange sexual "dates" with
them, even though one of the officers is
married.
When his wife learns of his infidel
ity, by the long scratch marks on his
back, she throws him out of the house.
He is able to rent a house on the prop
erty of an aged woman on his beat who
heroizes police officers.
Soon he is joined by other members
of the "mid-watch," and the house is
dubbed "Monster Manor." For these
law enforcement officers, every night
is party night, with raucous music,
heavy drinking, and a different female
sex partner. As soon as they adopt this
life-style, their official performance of
police work takes a radical turn for the
better. They apprehend criminals right
and left. Their superiors are as
tounded.
The philandering officer tries to
convince his wife to take him back, but
somehow she cannot, especially when
she comes over and finds his latest
bedmate.
When vice squad members of the

police force, who, incidentally are not
interested in their fellow officers'
vices, ask to use the "Monster Manor"
to arrest a group of masseuse/call girls,
the "mid-watch" officers cooperate by
visiting their elderly landlady. While
there, they are barely able to hide their
contempt for her, her art objects and
her tea. They are straining at the win-

dow to see the "squeezes" or "broads"
get arrested when they respond to the
request from the vice squad for "mas
sages."
When the prostitutes' pimp arrives,
he is, predictably, black.
For cooperating in the bust, the
"Monster Manor" officers receive
glowing commendations from the vice
squad and their own superiors.
The policeman thrown out of his
home by his wife is able to reconcile
with her. As he packs his gear to go
home, the other "mid-watch" officers
predict he will be back. When he de
nies it, they call after him, "You're

married, not dead."
The story of this program has several
messages.
The first is that policemen have no
more regard for law enforcement and
decency than do the criminals they ar
rest.
The second message is that promis
cuity and heavy drinking are not vices,
but virtues, since they obviously im
prove job performance.
The third is that most women are
sexually available, which is all right as
long as they don't charge for it. Wives
are portrayed as shrewish and homely.
Elderly women are shown as boring
old fools. The woman officer on the
force is referred to as the "department

When his wife learns of his infidel
ity, by the long scratch marks on his
back, she throws him out of the house.
He is able to rent a house on the prop
erty of an aged woman on his beat who
heroizes police officers.
Soon he is joined by other members
of the "mid-watch," and the house is
dubbed "Monster Manor." For these
law enforcement officers, every night
is party night, with raucous music,
heavy drinking, and a different female
sex partner. As soon as they adopt this
life-style, their official performance of
police work takes a radical turn for the
better. They apprehend criminals right
and left. Their superiors are as
tounded.
The philandering officer tries to
convince his wife to take him back, but
somehow she cannot, especially when
she comes over and finds his latest
bedmate.
When vice squad members of the

police force, who, incidentally are not
interested in their fellow officers'
vices, ask to use the "Monster Manor"
to arrest a group of masseuse/call girls,
the "mid-watch" officers cooperate by
visiting their elderly landlady. While
there, they are barely able to hide their
contempt for her, her art objects and
her tea. They are straining at the win-

dow to see the "squeezes" or "broads"
get arrested when they respond to the
request from the vice squad for "mas
sages."
When the prostitutes' pimp arrives,
he is, predictably, black.
For cooperating in the bust, the
"Monster Manor" officers receive
glowing commendations from the vice
squad and their own superiors.
The policeman thrown out of his
home by his wife is able to reconcile
with her. As he packs his gear to go
home, the other "mid-watch" officers
predict he will be back. When he de
nies it, they call after him, "You're

married, not dead."
The story of this program has several
messages.
The first is that policemen have no
more regard for law enforcement and
decency than do the criminals they ar
rest.
The second message is that promis
cuity and heavy drinking are not vices,
but virtues, since they obviously im
prove job performance.
The third is that most women are
sexually available, which is all right as
long as they don't charge for it. Wives
are portrayed as shrewish and homely.
Elderly women are shown as boring
old fools. The woman officer on the
force is referred to as the "department
iceberg," because she refuses to have
sexual relations with male officers,
thereby deserving ridicule.
The fourth message is that marriage
should present no barriers to promis
cuity, and that promiscuity and heavy
drinking prove one is "not dead."
The fifth message is that minorities
are criminals.
Unfortunately, this particular prog
ram is not unique in the field of net
work programming. On another net
work earlier in the evening, one saw
LaVerne and Shirley forgive and offer
to be the friends of a disgruntled suitor
who wrote their telephone number on
a men's bathroom wall.
So what if they received 40 obscene
phone calls? So what if two men came
to ostensibly "date" them and wound
up trying to rape them?
Network programmers would like
you to believe that their shows don't
have adverse effects on viewers. Well,
they certainly have been able to con
vince advertisers that commercials are
effective. How can they expect anyone
to believe that glorification of crimi
nality, violence and loveless sex are
without effect on the public?
There has been a great deal of public
outcry against the recent upsurge in
crime. All violent crimes have shown
rapid increase in the past few years.
But the same people who deplore

crime in reality are avid television
consumers of crime as they see it on
their home screens.
If crime in actual life is so horrible,
why are so many people willing to
watch it on television? Is it possible
that viewers are growing callous, un
caring? How long will deep regard for
human life last if it is degraded and
thrown away nightly on television
sets, which nearly 98 per cent of the
population possess?
Viewed violence incites children to

aggression, according to researchers.
And we too often read of actual crimes
which were based on last night's crime
drama plotline.
But the networks are making money
by using sex and violence as staple fare
on television. And we will continue to
be deluged by these two sure-fire
profit-makers as long as they bring in
the profits.

Network television has finally
proven that no low is too low to stoop
to if stooping means profiting.
The network bill of fare shows an
astonishing sameness of content. Un
fortunately, this sameness focuses on
violence, promiscuity and disregard
for common decency.
This is not an old-fashioned moralis
tic objection. It is instead an assess
ment based on common sense. Vio
lence and sexual crime have sky
rocketed in recent years. Regard for life
and human welfare has taken a propor
tionate downward plunge.
Television can be held accountable
for at least some of this.
A case in point is the Police Story
program aired on Tuesday, Nov. 30.
The plot of the story centered on the
police officers of the "mid-watch," a
group of officers with a reputation for
poor police work and "goofing off."
Two patrolmen of the "mid-watch"
pull over a pair of stewardesses for a
traffic violation. Immediately they are
able to arrange sexual "dates" with
them, even though one of the officers is
married.
