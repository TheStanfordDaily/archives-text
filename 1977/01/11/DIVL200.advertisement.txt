SPEED READING COURSE
TO BE TAUGHT
IN PALO ALTO
Golden State Reading Labs is offering their famous
speed reading course to a limited number of qualified
people here in the Palo Alto area. The average person
who completes this course can read 10 times faster,
and with substantially improved comprehension.
This famous course has taught many thousands of
people to read over 1000 words per minute with the
ability to understand and retain what they have read
much more effectively. Average graduates can read
most novels in less than 1 hour.
For complete details about this famous speed read
ing course, be sure to attend one of the free one hour
orientation lectures that have been scheduled. These
lectures are open to the public, above age 13 (persons
under 18 should be accompanied by a parent, if pos
sible) and the course will be explained in complete
detail, including class schedules, instruction proce
dures and a tuition that is much less than similar
