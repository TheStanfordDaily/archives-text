# Profits permit lower Flicks price

The ASSU Sunday Night Flicks'
$4000 profit last year has made it pos
sible to reduce this quarter's admis
sion price to 50 cents, according to
Flicks manager Steve Fugaro.
Tickets sold for 75 cents last year
and last quarter. Fugaro said he plans
to use last year's profit to help offset
losses that may occur this quarter.
"There is no reason for that profit to
be sitting around since the ASSU's
main purpose is to provide a service
rather than to make money," Fugaro
said.
The price of season passes, however,
remains at $5.50. With this quarter's
50-cent admission rate, there is no fi
nancial advantage in holding a pass as
opposed to simply buying a ticket each
time one goes to the Flicks. Fugaro re
ported that only 500 passes have been
sold so far this quarter, in contrast to

1000 sold last quarter.
The reduced Flicks admission is not
expected to affect attendance at the
Saturday Night Films sponsored by
the Hammer and Coffin (H&C) Society,
according to H&C member Jeff Stoler.
Quality, not price
Admission to the Films is $1 or 50
cents if a $5 season pass is purchased.
Stoler said he believes audiences care
more about what movie is shown
rather that the price of tickets since
admissions are already so low.
Fugaro said that this quarter the
Flicks are not competing with the
Films because the two groups are
showing movies which appeal to diffe
rent audiences.
There was some competition last
quarter, said Fugaro, because the two
series were showing similar films. The
Films booked both One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest and Dog Day Afternoon

before the Flicks could book them, he
pointed out.
Stoler commented that the Films are
in competition with the Flicks to the
extent that most persons choose to at
tend only one movie per weekend.
He admitted that the Flicks get better
attendance, partially because persons
are in the habit of going to the Flicks
and also because there usually are
other forms of entertainment offered
on Saturday nights.
Refutes Reg Pack claim
The Chaparral Reg Pack issue made
a claim that Fugaro was receiving 20
per cent of the profit from the Flicks.
According to Fugaro, he actually only
makes two per cent of the gross re
ceipts. He would not disclose an actual
figure, however.
There has also been some con
troversy over the booking of movies for
both the Flicks and the Films. Stoler

explained that the Films had booked a
35 mm print version of Sherlock
Holmes' Smarter Brother, and know
ing this, Fugaro later booked it in 16
mm print.
Fugaro confirmed this story, justify
ing his action by saying he was able to
rent the movie for substantially less
than H&C was paying. Stoler said H&C
decided not to show the film because
the Films would probably have lost
money with such an arrangement.
Fugaro said he feels fairly confident
that Flicks admission will remain at 50
cents for spring quarter, but the deter
mining factor will be the success of the
winter quarter Flicks.
According to Fugaro, the Flicks ran
at a near loss last quarter, experiencing
much lower attendance than last year.
He attributed the lower turn-out to
more films being shown around cam-

Brand new old price
The Sunday Flicks' price is back dowrt to 50 cents per show after four
quarters at six bits. Steve Fugaro, Flicks manager, says last year's $4000
profit made the price rollback possible.
