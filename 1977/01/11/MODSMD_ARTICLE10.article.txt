# America must renew war on poverty
## 
### 
If a free society cannot help the
many who are poor, it cannot save the
few who are rich.
—John F. Kennedy, January 20, 1961
President Kennedy's philosophic
warning stated in his inaugural ad
dress 16 years ago has direct, practical
application to the problem of poverty
today and merits the concern of both
the upcoming Carter administration
and the public. Consider, three re
cently reported facts:
Headline — 25 Million Americans

Live in Poverty,
Headline — Economy Stagnating
in Poorest Nations,
Headline —400 Million People Face
Starvation in the World Today.
Facts regarding poverty in the world
are reported week after week in almost

every newspaperand magazine. And it
seems that aside from those domestic
economic problems which affect the
"American pocketbook" directly, we
have become immune to the startling
reality of poverty in the world.
Perhaps one of the hardest facts the
Carter administration will have to face
is that poverty is built into our domes
ticand international economic system.
This presents us with the dishearten
ing observation that we live in a
"zero-sum" economy — where the
wealth of one class or nation is built
upon the poverty of another class or
nation. The gross economic asymmet
ries between the rich and poor bear
this out.
Although domestic poverty may be
more subtle and less widespread than
the conditions of such poor countries
as Chad and Bangladesh, economic
disparities still exist within the United
States. Everyone is aware of un
employment rising to 8.1 per cent and
the steadily increasing cost of living,
but the roots of poverty and discrimi
nation run deep into the economic sys
tem and are often less apparent than
price indices. Poverty is heavily con
centrated among minority groups.
For example, unemployment among
young blacks may reach as high
as 60 per cent. These trends reveal
years of economic and political repres
sion and a clear denial of "equal op
portunity." In 1975, the federal gov
ernment defined the poverty level for a

family of four as an annual income of
$5,500. At this bare subsistence level
some 25 million Americans or 12 per
cent of the nation qualified as poor.
The domestic situation has revealed
some hope for the poor. The commit
ment started by President Lyndon
Johnson to fight the "war on poverty"
and to support civil rights legislation
has helped balance the inequities of
the nation and move us closer to
achieving economic justice. Although
abandoned during the Nixon years,
such programs await rekindling in the
future. For example, President-elect
Carter has proposed legislation that
would help ameliorate economic bur
dens of the poor through tax benefits,
income redistribution, increased gov
ernment jobs, a national health care
plan and similar programs.
However, domestic improvement
will be short lived unless our relation
ships with other nations follow suit.
Last week the Washington Post re
ported that the poorest nations of the
world comprising one billion people
showed no economic growth in the
past five years. In addition, the na
tional debt of these nations has in
creased. The less developed countries
(LDCs) seem to remain steadily behind
the developed world with little sign of
improvement.
The cause of this poverty is built into
the current international economic or
der. The world is becoming more in
terdependent,as can be seen from in
creases in international trade, foreign
investment and transgovernmental
dealings. However, this interdepen
dence is highly asymmetrical. As a re
sult, economies of many nations in
Latin America, Asia and Africa fluc
tuate at the will of the United States.
The LDCs are dependent on indus
trialized states for export sales, com
mercial capital flows, and foreign aid.
In addition, if development does occur
it is usually capital intensiveand done
in low priority sectors. The overall re
sult is that the Third World nations
remain in poverty, increase their debts
and have little chance to develop to
their benefit.
This condition has been perpetuated

by exploiting nations which have built
dominance into the system through
technological monopoly and control
of capital with regulation of tariff,
trade and expansion.
Colonial and imperialistic exploita
tion of Third World raw materials, in
creased dependency of the LDCs on
the United States and ineffective
toreign aid have left the current wofrld
economic order with intense conflict
dividing the world into two factions —
poor versus rich. Furthermore, even
within our own nation, conflicts exist
between those who are poor, un
employed or discriminated and those
who wish to maintain the status quo.
The solution the United States has
found domestically is to make incre
mental changes through legislation
and reform. Indeed, the situation of
conflict in the world can be improved
along the same lines.
The United States should make
gradual, yet significant concessions to
such Third World demands as com
modity pricing agreements, develop
ment technology assistance, aid and
loan agreements and the opening of
markets. The U.S. must increase
spending on such foreign aid prog
rams as the Peace Corps and Food for
Peace, as well as assist efforts for world
food and monetary organization.
The upcoming administration must
continue efforts to assist the poor and
eliminate discrimination within our
nation, but must also remember that
the international arena is merely an
expansion of our own domestic strug
gle with poverty.
A proposal for economic harmony is
highly idealistic and most likely will
not be achieved in the near future.
However, the United States sits at the
fulcrum of world order, and with that
position a concerted national effort led
by a new administration in
Washington could turn the tide of
events and lead the United States in
the right direction toward avoiding
conflict, achieving world cooperation
and maintaining President Kennedy's
pledge to assist the poor.
