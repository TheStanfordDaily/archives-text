# Denies Soviet superiority
## Kissinger bids farewell to press 
### 
Washington (AP) —Henry Kissinger, in a
valedictory to the capital's press corps, yes
terday dismissed the notion that the Soviet
Union has gained military superiority over
the United States.
In a nuclear age, Kissinger said, "the term
supremacy when casualties on both sides
would be in the tens of millions has practi
cally no operational significance as long as
we do what is necessary to maintain a ba
lance."
However, Kissinger recommended that
the incoming Carter administration moder
nize and strengthen U.S. forces that would
be involved in "regional conflicts," which
he said were the greatest military dangers
facing the country.
Assessing the last eight years, in which he
was a principal architect of American
foreign policy, Kissinger said possibly his
largest achievement was helping the nation
steer past "the trauma of Vietnam" and the
"nightmare of Watergate."

Praising President Ford as a leader whose
strength and honesty calmed our troubled
land," Kissinger said the Carter administra
tion would inherit "a nation recovered."
"The new president and the new secret
ary of state Cyrus R. Vance deserve the sup
port of all Americans," Kissinger said.
In discounting suggestions of Soviet
superiority, Kissinger took direct issue with
at least two teams of experts, one working
with the Central Intelligence Agency and
the other outside the government, who have
warned recently that Moscow appears on
the verge of surpassing the United States in
military and nuclear strength.
No Soviet superiority
"I do not believe the Soviet Union is
achieving military superiority over the Un
ited States," Kissinger said.
"I do not believe that any American ad
ministration would permit a situation to
arise is which the Soviet Union could
achieve military strategic superiority over
the United States."

However, Kissinger went on, the "es
sence" of the situation is that "military
superiority has no practical significance"
when the two superpowers each have the
capability of destroying civilized life.
No service
"Those who are still talking about
superiority are not doing the American
people a service," he said.
Kissinger's appearance at the National
Press Club had its light moments, with fre
quent references to his celebrated verbal
duels with reporters over the credibility is
sue.
He acknowledged "duping" reporters at
least once—when he denied in 1975 that he
had set out for the Middle East already car
rying a list of Israeli prisoners to be released
by Syria. Kissinger said he was guided by
"humanitarian consideration" in telling
some reporters who traveled with him that
he was negotiating for the prisoners' re
lease.
