# 'Man and Superman'
## Shaw's playâ€”ACT star 
### 
Reviewed by Keith Phelge
George Bernard Shaw's play, Mun und
Superman is the current star at the Geary
Theatre in San Francisco. The American
Conservatory Theatre's (ACT) production
of the turn-of-the-century masterpiece is
creditable to be sure, but is out-classed by
Shaw's virtuosity.
Designated by Shaw a "Comedy and a
Philosophy", Mun and Superman is in fact
among the wittiest of all comedies and the
vehicle of an all-embracing philosophy.
The plot, and indirectly the philosophy,
is centered around the romantic lives of two
young English men and a young English
woman. Octavius Robinson is the ward of a
gentleman who apparently died just before
the opening of the first act. That gentle
man's daughter, Ann Whitefield, is the ob
ject of Octavius's copious affections. Oc
tavius' lifelong friend, Jack Tanner, is the
target of Ann's affections and is something
of an iconoclast as well. Through a variety
of comic perambulations the piny winds its
way, with a philosophical digression in the
third act, to its dramatically and
philosophically inevitable end: Ann's cap
ture of Tanner and Octavius' disappoint
ment.
Miscasting
The most conspicuous shortcomings in
director jack O'Brien's production arise
from miscast players. While miscasting is a
frequent problem with repertory com
panies, ACT misses in tliis production with
perhaps one third of the characters.
Peter Donat as Tanner, for example, does
very well with the part, but because of his
age he would be more plausible as Ann's
father than her contemporary. Shaw wrote
that Tanner is "too young to be described

simply as a big man with a beard;" but al
though Donat has neither youth nor a beard,
he does come across as "prodigiously fluent
of speech, restless, excitable, possibly a lit
tle mad."
James Winker as Octavius has more seri
ous drawbacks. Not only is he not "an un
commonly nice looking fellow, a jeune
premiere", he also plays his part with a sin
gular lack of originality. His Octavius is a
creation we recognize from stage comedies
as a young man deeply and romantically in
love. If Winker had not the stage comedy
stereotype on which to model his perfor
mance, one fears he would be at a loss in his
portrayal.
Artist-poet
Shaw never created a stereotyped charac
ter in his career and Octavius is not only a
young man in love but one who wants "to
count for something as a poet." The artist
poet is an integral part of the play's
philosophy; Shaw tells us through Tanner
and Don Juan that the poet is at once the
glorifier of womankind for men and "half
vivesector, half vampire" for women.
A proper interpretation of the part of Oc
tavius should include not only the passion
and idealism of the young poet but also a
trace of the dignity of an artist whose task it
is, as Tanner proclaims, "to show us our
selves as we really are."
Winker turns in a one-sided and uncon
vincing performance.
ACT is fortunate to have Barbara Di
rickson to play Ann Whitefield: she more
than makes up for the shortcomings of her
co-leads. She alone seems to have fully
comprehended the subtleties written into
her part, whether by instinct or otherwise,

and she has enough talent and ability to
convey those subtleties while charming the
audience.
Cool and reticent
Among the supporting characters,
Charles Hallahan as Tanner's chauffeur,
Enry Straker, is the most disappointingly
miscast. Straker is supposed to be "clean
shaven, dark eyed, square fingered, with
brushed black hair and rather irregular
sceptically turned eyebrows. With Tanner
and Tanner's friends his manner is not the
least deferential but cool and reticent..."
This part, one with but great potential for
comedy, depends on how effectively the
actor fulfills the latter part of the descrip
tion. Hallahan fails to capitalize on the pos
sibilities for a devastating irony with which
he is provided. Furthermore he is blond and
is much too well fed and jovial to be con
vincing as a supposed underling who
knows himself to be far superior to those
above him in society.
The production is also somewhat hurt by
the lack of British accents. Shaw intended
broad American intonations of Hector, Oc
tavius' sister's husband, to have been a
source of comedy. He took the trouble to
spell out such lines for Hector as "I too am
the mawdest possessor of a motor car. If
Miss Rawbnsn will allow me the
privilege..." The comic effect of an exagger
ated American accent is lost when there are
no refined British accents for contrast.
In short, devout fans of Shaw may be
somewhat disappointed by the partial fail
ure of ACT to live up to the great playw
right's masterpiece, but the production is
very energetic and the play would be great
entertainment even in a much inferior ren
dition.

portrayal.
Artist-poet
Shaw never created a stereotyped charac
ter in his career and Octavius is not only a
young man in love but one who wants "to
count for something as a poet." The artist
poet is an integral part of the play's
philosophy; Shaw tells us through Tanner
and Don Juan that the poet is at once the
glorifier of womankind for men and "half
vivesector, half vampire" for women.
A proper interpretation of the part of Oc
tavius should include not only the passion
and idealism of the young poet but also a
trace of the dignity of an artist whose task it
is, as Tanner proclaims, "to show us our
selves as we really are."
Winker turns in a one-sided and uncon
vincing performance.
ACT is fortunate to have Barbara Di
rickson to play Ann Whitefield: she more
than makes up for the shortcomings of her
co-leads. She alone seems to have fully
comprehended the subtleties written into
her part, whether by instinct or otherwise,

and she has enough talent and ability to
convey those subtleties while charming the
audience.
Cool and reticent
Among the supporting characters,
Charles Hallahan as Tanner's chauffeur,
Enry Straker, is the most disappointingly
miscast. Straker is supposed to be "clean
shaven, dark eyed, square fingered, with
brushed black hair and rather irregular
sceptically turned eyebrows. With Tanner
and Tanner's friends his manner is not the
least deferential but cool and reticent..."
This part, one with but great potential for
comedy, depends on how effectively the
actor fulfills the latter part of the descrip
tion. Hallahan fails to capitalize on the pos
sibilities for a devastating irony with which
he is provided. Furthermore he is blond and
is much too well fed and jovial to be con
vincing as a supposed underling who
knows himself to be far superior to those
above him in society.
The production is also somewhat hurt by
the lack of British accents. Shaw intended
broad American intonations of Hector, Oc
tavius' sister's husband, to have been a
source of comedy. He took the trouble to
spell out such lines for Hector as "I too am
the mawdest possessor of a motor car. If
Miss Rawbnsn will allow me the
privilege..." The comic effect of an exagger
ated American accent is lost when there are
no refined British accents for contrast.
In short, devout fans of Shaw may be
somewhat disappointed by the partial fail
ure of ACT to live up to the great playw
right's masterpiece, but the production is
very energetic and the play would be great
entertainment even in a much inferior ren
dition.

George Bernard Shaw's play, Mun und
Superman is the current star at the Geary
Theatre in San Francisco. The American
Conservatory Theatre's (ACT) production
of the turn-of-the-century masterpiece is
creditable to be sure, but is out-classed by
Shaw's virtuosity.
Designated by Shaw a "Comedy and a
Philosophy", Mun and Superman is in fact
among the wittiest of all comedies and the
vehicle of an all-embracing philosophy.
The plot, and indirectly the philosophy,
is centered around the romantic lives of two
young English men and a young English
woman. Octavius Robinson is the ward of a
gentleman who apparently died just before
the opening of the first act. That gentle
man's daughter, Ann Whitefield, is the ob
ject of Octavius's copious affections. Oc
tavius' lifelong friend, Jack Tanner, is the
target of Ann's affections and is something
of an iconoclast as well. Through a variety
of comic perambulations the piny winds its
way, with a philosophical digression in the
third act, to its dramatically and
philosophically inevitable end: Ann's cap
ture of Tanner and Octavius' disappoint
ment.
Miscasting
The most conspicuous shortcomings in
director jack O'Brien's production arise
from miscast players. While miscasting is a
frequent problem with repertory com
panies, ACT misses in tliis production with
perhaps one third of the characters.
Peter Donat as Tanner, for example, does
very well with the part, but because of his
age he would be more plausible as Ann's
father than her contemporary. Shaw wrote
that Tanner is "too young to be described

simply as a big man with a beard;" but al
though Donat has neither youth nor a beard,
he does come across as "prodigiously fluent
of speech, restless, excitable, possibly a lit
tle mad."
James Winker as Octavius has more seri
ous drawbacks. Not only is he not "an un
commonly nice looking fellow, a jeune
premiere", he also plays his part with a sin
gular lack of originality. His Octavius is a
creation we recognize from stage comedies
as a young man deeply and romantically in
love. If Winker had not the stage comedy
stereotype on which to model his perfor

George Bernard Shaw's play, Mun und
Superman is the current star at the Geary
Theatre in San Francisco. The American
Conservatory Theatre's (ACT) production
of the turn-of-the-century masterpiece is
creditable to be sure, but is out-classed by
Shaw's virtuosity.
Designated by Shaw a "Comedy and a
Philosophy", Mun and Superman is in fact
among the wittiest of all comedies and the
vehicle of an all-embracing philosophy.
The plot, and indirectly the philosophy,
is centered around the romantic lives of two
young English men and a young English
woman. Octavius Robinson is the ward of a
gentleman who apparently died just before
the opening of the first act. That gentle
man's daughter, Ann Whitefield, is the ob
ject of Octavius's copious affections. Oc
tavius' lifelong friend, Jack Tanner, is the
target of Ann's affections and is something
of an iconoclast as well. Through a variety
of comic perambulations the piny winds its
way, with a philosophical digression in the
third act, to its dramatically and
philosophically inevitable end: Ann's cap
ture of Tanner and Octavius' disappoint
ment.
Miscasting
The most conspicuous shortcomings in
director jack O'Brien's production arise
from miscast players. While miscasting is a
frequent problem with repertory com
panies, ACT misses in tliis production with
perhaps one third of the characters.
Peter Donat as Tanner, for example, does
very well with the part, but because of his
age he would be more plausible as Ann's
father than her contemporary. Shaw wrote
that Tanner is "too young to be described

simply as a big man with a beard;" but al
though Donat has neither youth nor a beard,
he does come across as "prodigiously fluent
of speech, restless, excitable, possibly a lit
tle mad."
James Winker as Octavius has more seri
ous drawbacks. Not only is he not "an un
commonly nice looking fellow, a jeune
premiere", he also plays his part with a sin
gular lack of originality. His Octavius is a
creation we recognize from stage comedies
as a young man deeply and romantically in
love. If Winker had not the stage comedy
stereotype on which to model his perfor
mance, one fears he would be at a loss in his
portrayal.
Artist-poet
Shaw never created a stereotyped charac
ter in his career and Octavius is not only a
young man in love but one who wants "to
count for something as a poet." The artist
poet is an integral part of the play's
philosophy; Shaw tells us through Tanner
and Don Juan that the poet is at once the
glorifier of womankind for men and "half
vivesector, half vampire" for women.
A proper interpretation of the part of Oc
tavius should include not only the passion
and idealism of the young poet but also a
trace of the dignity of an artist whose task it
is, as Tanner proclaims, "to show us our
selves as we really are."
Winker turns in a one-sided and uncon
vincing performance.
ACT is fortunate to have Barbara Di
rickson to play Ann Whitefield: she more
than makes up for the shortcomings of her
co-leads. She alone seems to have fully
comprehended the subtleties written into
her part, whether by instinct or otherwise,

and she has enough talent and ability to
convey those subtleties while charming the
audience.
Cool and reticent
Among the supporting characters,
Charles Hallahan as Tanner's chauffeur,
Enry Straker, is the most disappointingly
miscast. Straker is supposed to be "clean
shaven, dark eyed, square fingered, with
brushed black hair and rather irregular
sceptically turned eyebrows. With Tanner
and Tanner's friends his manner is not the
least deferential but cool and reticent..."
This part, one with but great potential for
comedy, depends on how effectively the
actor fulfills the latter part of the descrip
tion. Hallahan fails to capitalize on the pos
sibilities for a devastating irony with which
he is provided. Furthermore he is blond and
is much too well fed and jovial to be con
vincing as a supposed underling who
knows himself to be far superior to those
above him in society.
The production is also somewhat hurt by
the lack of British accents. Shaw intended
broad American intonations of Hector, Oc
tavius' sister's husband, to have been a
source of comedy. He took the trouble to
spell out such lines for Hector as "I too am
the mawdest possessor of a motor car. If
Miss Rawbnsn will allow me the
privilege..." The comic effect of an exagger
ated American accent is lost when there are
no refined British accents for contrast.
In short, devout fans of Shaw may be
somewhat disappointed by the partial fail
ure of ACT to live up to the great playw
right's masterpiece, but the production is
very energetic and the play would be great
entertainment even in a much inferior ren
dition.
