# 'Last Tycoon' is dreadful
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
The Last Tycoon is the kind of
movie that sends critics scurry
ing to their thesauruses for new
synonyms for the word "dread
ful." Actually, they made a spe
cial thesaurus just for critics, di
vided into sections — positive
adjectives and negative adjec
tives. The Last Tycoon could
single-handedly deplete the lat
ter section, which means we'll
have to start making up new
words to describe bad movies.
The last adaptation of an F.
Scott Fitzgerald novel combines
the vitality of Barry Lyndon, the
structural complexity of Mid
way, the histrionic depth of The
Hindenburg and the cinematic
pacing of The Man Who Fell To
Earth. Not that it's a bad movie,
though — it's simply an atroci
ous movie.

The irony of the whole thing is
that producer Sam Spiegel said
before making the film, "I'd been
toying for a long time with the
idea of making a subjective film
about Hollywood based on my
own experiences in the '40s and
'50s. I began assembling notes for
a nostalgic screenplay — sort of a
negative nostalgia. But 1 went off
on so many tangents that 1 knew
my script wouldn't work." It's
too bad Spiegel couldn't have
been so objective about Harold
Pinter's screenplay. It goes off in
so many directions that it looks
more like a map of the Los
Angeles freeway system than a
screenplay
It features a herd of stars (all
actors are cattle, you know), al
most none of whom have any re
lationship to the story of Monroe
Stahr (Robert DeNiro) and his

elusive love Kathleen (Ingrid
Boulting). I believe Rex Reed put
it best when he described her as
having "puffy cheeks like a
chipmunk storing chestnuts."
She may be the only person I've
ever seen whose face is wider
than it is high.
Revolving around them are
people who have nothing to do
with the love story — lack
Nicholson as a union organizer;
Dana Andrews as a washed-up
director; Jeanne Moreau as a
French bitch; Tony Curtis as an
impotent matinee idol; Ray Mil
land as a benign studio lawyer;
Robert Mitchum as Stahr's boss
Brady; and Donald Pleasance as
a bewildered screenwriter.
None of these established stars
manage to bring any vitality to
the movie. They mill around the
enigmatic Stahr like ghosts in
someone else's dream. As for In
grid and Theresa Russell, who
plays Brady's daughter Cecilia,
they both seem to have
graduated from the Cybill
Shepherd School of Dramatics,
where everyone else attended re
fresher courses.
Even such vital actors as
Nicholson andDeNiroare unable
to inject any excitement.
Director Elia Kazan may be the
only man who has ever wasted so
many million dollars of talent in
one movie. It will be a long time
before anyone hires so many
people to do so little in so long a
movie. The Last Tycoon is the
only two-and-a-half-hour movie
that lasts four hours.

most none of whom have any re
lationship to the story of Monroe
Stahr (Robert DeNiro) and his

elusive love Kathleen (Ingrid
Boulting). I believe Rex Reed put
it best when he described her as
having "puffy cheeks like a
chipmunk storing chestnuts."
She may be the only person I've
ever seen whose face is wider
than it is high.
Revolving around them are
people who have nothing to do
with the love story — lack
Nicholson as a union organizer;
Dana Andrews as a washed-up
director; Jeanne Moreau as a
French bitch; Tony Curtis as an
impotent matinee idol; Ray Mil
land as a benign studio lawyer;
Robert Mitchum as Stahr's boss
Brady; and Donald Pleasance as
a bewildered screenwriter.
None of these established stars
manage to bring any vitality to
the movie. They mill around the
enigmatic Stahr like ghosts in
someone else's dream. As for In
grid and Theresa Russell, who
plays Brady's daughter Cecilia,
they both seem to have
graduated from the Cybill
Shepherd School of Dramatics,
where everyone else attended re
fresher courses.
Even such vital actors as
Nicholson andDeNiroare unable
to inject any excitement.
Director Elia Kazan may be the
only man who has ever wasted so
many million dollars of talent in
one movie. It will be a long time
before anyone hires so many
people to do so little in so long a
movie. The Last Tycoon is the
only two-and-a-half-hour movie
that lasts four hours.

The Last Tycoon is the kind of
movie that sends critics scurry
ing to their thesauruses for new
synonyms for the word "dread
ful." Actually, they made a spe
cial thesaurus just for critics, di
vided into sections — positive
adjectives and negative adjec
tives. The Last Tycoon could
single-handedly deplete the lat
ter section, which means we'll
have to start making up new
words to describe bad movies.
The last adaptation of an F.
Scott Fitzgerald novel combines
the vitality of Barry Lyndon, the
structural complexity of Mid
way, the histrionic depth of The
Hindenburg and the cinematic
pacing of The Man Who Fell To
Earth. Not that it's a bad movie,
though — it's simply an atroci
ous movie.

The irony of the whole thing is
that producer Sam Spiegel said
before making the film, "I'd been
toying for a long time with the
idea of making a subjective film
about Hollywood based on my
own experiences in the '40s and
'50s. I began assembling notes for
a nostalgic screenplay — sort of a
negative nostalgia. But 1 went off
on so many tangents that 1 knew
my script wouldn't work." It's
too bad Spiegel couldn't have
been so objective about Harold
Pinter's screenplay. It goes off in
so many directions that it looks
more like a map of the Los
Angeles freeway system than a
screenplay
It features a herd of stars (all
actors are cattle, you know), al
most none of whom have any re
lationship to the story of Monroe
Stahr (Robert DeNiro) and his

elusive love Kathleen (Ingrid
