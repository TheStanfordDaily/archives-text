### Andrew M. Moravcsik 
The San Francisco Symphony's fourth concert
of the year, featuring conductor Seiji Ozawa and
"internationally renowned" pianist Andrew
Watts, began badly. The usual format (an over
ture, followed by a concerto and finally a sym
phonic work) was scrapped in a last minute shuf
fle, leaving the Schumann Symphony No. 1
("Spring") as the first piece, to be followed by the
shorter and lighter works featuring Watts.
The overture-concerto-symphony arrangement
is an inveterate tradition with orchestras and not
without reason, for it gives both the listener and
the orchestra a chance to "warm-up." Wednes
day's concert evinces the wisdom of this reason
ing.
The Schumann got off to a poor start, with
bloopers in the opening brass fanfare and a mud
diness engendered by the inability to stay to
gether rhythmically. Throughout the first move
ment, the music was uneven and rough, charac
terized by poor tone in all portions of the or
chestra, but most noticeably in the first violins.
Furthermore, the orchestra was balanced very
poorly, with the brass completely overshadowing
the violins. Whether this is due to Schumann's
oft-maligned orchestration (there were, in fact,
more trombones than in most contemporary
works) is irrelevant — it is Ozawa's responsibility
to correct such problems in his interpretation.
Finally warmed-up
The second movement, a dreamy Larghetto,
still lacked the warm string and woodwind tones
necessary to convey the mood. However, the third
movement, a Scherzo, was brilliant. The or
chestra, finally warmed-up, delivered a crisp, joy
ful interpretation, appropriate for a movement
subtitled "Merry Playmates."
Ozawa is a gestic conductor and his forte is
dance-like sections, such as this Scherzo. His
tempo was slightly slower than usual, allowing
one to hear all the subtleties often hidden in faster
interpretations, while maintaining the exciting
rhythm of a dance.
The fourth movement, an Allegro in sonata
form, maintained the excitement of the previous
movement. Fnormous contrasts — accelerando,
deaccelerando; solo, tutti; forte, piano; lyric, dis
joi nted — are characteristic of this movement and
the orchestra handled these difficult changes in
musical style well. Several woodwind solos were
played with the sensitivity and lyricism approp
riate to "Spring's Farewell." Ozawa brought the
work to a tumultuous finish.
Classic interpretation
The second work on the program, Cesar Frank's
Symphonic Variations for Piano and
Orchestra, is a set of 11 free-form variations writ
ten in 1885. Although Frank is best known as an
unabashedly Romantic composer of organ music,
Watts' exciting, yet quiet, pensive and Classic in
terpretation suited the pioce well. Ozawa and
Watts tried to work closely together but unfortu
nately the orchestra, as in the beginning of the
Schumann, was unable to match the lightness of

touch and the balance of Watts' interpretation,
leading to several muddy variations.
Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody To the Vic
tims of Hiroshima, written in 1960, is a strange
and shocking work written for 52 strings who do
not play a single note in the normal fashion. In
stead Penderecki uses strange sounds: strings
played behind the bridge, with the wooden part of
the bow or in the (normally unusable) highest
ranges of instrument; mysteriousglissando slides
and overly emphasized vibrato are contrasted
with percussive effects, such as hitting the in
struments with the hand or bow. Even the normal
five-line staff is replaced by strange designs and
pictures to represent the sounds.
Despite these bizarre techniques, the work is
incredibly effective. The strange tones form an
guished cries and sighs — a combination of fear
and horror occasionally interspersed with a clat
tering, shocking percussion. The performance did
full justice to the work, bringing out the enormous
dynamic range and the various timbres.
Unorthodox nature
This piece is especially challenging to the con
ductor, who must create new techniques to match
the unorthodox nature of the music. Ozawa
adapted magnificently, evoking the subtleties
that are all-important in a work such as the
Threnody. This is promising since the program
for this season contains an inordinate number of
modern works.
1 looked forward to the final work listed on the
program, Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 2, with some
small trepidation. Although Liszt's music is un
deniably exciting, fantastic and fun, it al 1 too often
crosses the thin line between free Romanticism
and much "sound and fury signifying nothing."
This performance was no exception.
Although the quiet passages showed the sen
sitivity that was so evident in the Frank varia
tions, the loud passages were simply banged out
with impressive technique but dubious musical
ity. Furthermore, Watts has the extremely dis
tracting habit of slamming his feet on the floor and
singing along with his music. Now 1 would be the
first to defend artistic freedom, but Mr. Watts
strayed from free interpretation to bad taste. The
slapping, banging sound made by his shoes and
his atonal baritone mumbling reverberated
around the War Memorial Opera House, so that I
could not escape the distraction by merely closely
my eyes and ignoring his swinging feet.
Shattering finale
Despite these drawbacks, the performance was
exciting, and the final section — a series of stir
ring melodies and exhibitions of piano virtuosity
leading to a shattering finale — had the audience
on its feet almost before the last chord.
This week's concert will feature Janet Baker,
internationally famous contralto, in Haydn's can
tata "Ariadne auf Naxos. The orchestra will play
Haydn's overture to "Armida" and Anton Bruck
ner's Symphony No. 2 — a fine early work by this
Austrian symphonist. All performances are at the
Opera House.

played behind the bridge, with the wooden part of
the bow or in the (normally unusable) highest
ranges of instrument; mysteriousglissando slides
and overly emphasized vibrato are contrasted
with percussive effects, such as hitting the in
struments with the hand or bow. Even the normal
five-line staff is replaced by strange designs and
pictures to represent the sounds.
Despite these bizarre techniques, the work is
incredibly effective. The strange tones form an
guished cries and sighs — a combination of fear
and horror occasionally interspersed with a clat
tering, shocking percussion. The performance did
full justice to the work, bringing out the enormous
dynamic range and the various timbres.
Unorthodox nature
This piece is especially challenging to the con
ductor, who must create new techniques to match
the unorthodox nature of the music. Ozawa
adapted magnificently, evoking the subtleties
that are all-important in a work such as the
Threnody. This is promising since the program
for this season contains an inordinate number of
modern works.
1 looked forward to the final work listed on the
program, Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 2, with some
small trepidation. Although Liszt's music is un
deniably exciting, fantastic and fun, it al 1 too often
crosses the thin line between free Romanticism
and much "sound and fury signifying nothing."
This performance was no exception.
Although the quiet passages showed the sen
sitivity that was so evident in the Frank varia
tions, the loud passages were simply banged out
with impressive technique but dubious musical
ity. Furthermore, Watts has the extremely dis
tracting habit of slamming his feet on the floor and
singing along with his music. Now 1 would be the
first to defend artistic freedom, but Mr. Watts
strayed from free interpretation to bad taste. The
slapping, banging sound made by his shoes and
his atonal baritone mumbling reverberated
around the War Memorial Opera House, so that I
could not escape the distraction by merely closely
my eyes and ignoring his swinging feet.
Shattering finale
Despite these drawbacks, the performance was
exciting, and the final section — a series of stir
ring melodies and exhibitions of piano virtuosity
leading to a shattering finale — had the audience
on its feet almost before the last chord.
This week's concert will feature Janet Baker,
internationally famous contralto, in Haydn's can
tata "Ariadne auf Naxos. The orchestra will play
Haydn's overture to "Armida" and Anton Bruck
ner's Symphony No. 2 — a fine early work by this
Austrian symphonist. All performances are at the
Opera House.
The San Francisco Symphony's fourth concert
of the year, featuring conductor Seiji Ozawa and
"internationally renowned" pianist Andrew
Watts, began badly. The usual format (an over
ture, followed by a concerto and finally a sym
phonic work) was scrapped in a last minute shuf
fle, leaving the Schumann Symphony No. 1
("Spring") as the first piece, to be followed by the
shorter and lighter works featuring Watts.
The overture-concerto-symphony arrangement
is an inveterate tradition with orchestras and not
without reason, for it gives both the listener and
the orchestra a chance to "warm-up." Wednes
day's concert evinces the wisdom of this reason
ing.
The Schumann got off to a poor start, with
bloopers in the opening brass fanfare and a mud
diness engendered by the inability to stay to
gether rhythmically. Throughout the first move
ment, the music was uneven and rough, charac
terized by poor tone in all portions of the or
chestra, but most noticeably in the first violins.
Furthermore, the orchestra was balanced very
poorly, with the brass completely overshadowing
the violins. Whether this is due to Schumann's
oft-maligned orchestration (there were, in fact,
more trombones than in most contemporary
works) is irrelevant — it is Ozawa's responsibility
to correct such problems in his interpretation.
Finally warmed-up
The second movement, a dreamy Larghetto,
still lacked the warm string and woodwind tones
necessary to convey the mood. However, the third
movement, a Scherzo, was brilliant. The or
chestra, finally warmed-up, delivered a crisp, joy
ful interpretation, appropriate for a movement
subtitled "Merry Playmates."
Ozawa is a gestic conductor and his forte is
dance-like sections, such as this Scherzo. His
tempo was slightly slower than usual, allowing
one to hear all the subtleties often hidden in faster
interpretations, while maintaining the exciting
rhythm of a dance.
The fourth movement, an Allegro in sonata
form, maintained the excitement of the previous
movement. Fnormous contrasts — accelerando,
deaccelerando; solo, tutti; forte, piano; lyric, dis
joi nted — are characteristic of this movement and
the orchestra handled these difficult changes in
musical style well. Several woodwind solos were
played with the sensitivity and lyricism approp
riate to "Spring's Farewell." Ozawa brought the
work to a tumultuous finish.
Classic interpretation
The second work on the program, Cesar Frank's
Symphonic Variations for Piano and
Orchestra, is a set of 11 free-form variations writ
ten in 1885. Although Frank is best known as an
unabashedly Romantic composer of organ music,
Watts' exciting, yet quiet, pensive and Classic in
terpretation suited the pioce well. Ozawa and
Watts tried to work closely together but unfortu
nately the orchestra, as in the beginning of the
Schumann, was unable to match the lightness of

touch and the balance of Watts' interpretation,
leading to several muddy variations.
Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody To the Vic
tims of Hiroshima, written in 1960, is a strange
and shocking work written for 52 strings who do
not play a single note in the normal fashion. In

The Schumann got off to a poor start, with
bloopers in the opening brass fanfare and a mud
diness engendered by the inability to stay to
gether rhythmically. Throughout the first move
ment, the music was uneven and rough, charac
terized by poor tone in all portions of the or
chestra, but most noticeably in the first violins.
Furthermore, the orchestra was balanced very
poorly, with the brass completely overshadowing
the violins. Whether this is due to Schumann's
oft-maligned orchestration (there were, in fact,
more trombones than in most contemporary
works) is irrelevant — it is Ozawa's responsibility
to correct such problems in his interpretation.
Finally warmed-up
The second movement, a dreamy Larghetto,
still lacked the warm string and woodwind tones
necessary to convey the mood. However, the third
movement, a Scherzo, was brilliant. The or
chestra, finally warmed-up, delivered a crisp, joy
ful interpretation, appropriate for a movement
subtitled "Merry Playmates."
Ozawa is a gestic conductor and his forte is
dance-like sections, such as this Scherzo. His
tempo was slightly slower than usual, allowing
one to hear all the subtleties often hidden in faster
interpretations, while maintaining the exciting
rhythm of a dance.
The fourth movement, an Allegro in sonata
form, maintained the excitement of the previous
movement. Fnormous contrasts — accelerando,
deaccelerando; solo, tutti; forte, piano; lyric, dis
joi nted — are characteristic of this movement and
the orchestra handled these difficult changes in
musical style well. Several woodwind solos were
played with the sensitivity and lyricism approp
riate to "Spring's Farewell." Ozawa brought the
work to a tumultuous finish.
Classic interpretation
The second work on the program, Cesar Frank's
Symphonic Variations for Piano and
Orchestra, is a set of 11 free-form variations writ
ten in 1885. Although Frank is best known as an
unabashedly Romantic composer of organ music,
Watts' exciting, yet quiet, pensive and Classic in
terpretation suited the pioce well. Ozawa and
Watts tried to work closely together but unfortu
nately the orchestra, as in the beginning of the
Schumann, was unable to match the lightness of

touch and the balance of Watts' interpretation,
leading to several muddy variations.
Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody To the Vic
tims of Hiroshima, written in 1960, is a strange
and shocking work written for 52 strings who do
not play a single note in the normal fashion. In
stead Penderecki uses strange sounds: strings
played behind the bridge, with the wooden part of
the bow or in the (normally unusable) highest
ranges of instrument; mysteriousglissando slides
and overly emphasized vibrato are contrasted
with percussive effects, such as hitting the in
struments with the hand or bow. Even the normal
five-line staff is replaced by strange designs and
pictures to represent the sounds.
Despite these bizarre techniques, the work is
incredibly effective. The strange tones form an
guished cries and sighs — a combination of fear
and horror occasionally interspersed with a clat
tering, shocking percussion. The performance did
full justice to the work, bringing out the enormous
dynamic range and the various timbres.
Unorthodox nature
This piece is especially challenging to the con
ductor, who must create new techniques to match
the unorthodox nature of the music. Ozawa
adapted magnificently, evoking the subtleties
that are all-important in a work such as the
Threnody. This is promising since the program
for this season contains an inordinate number of
modern works.
1 looked forward to the final work listed on the
program, Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 2, with some
small trepidation. Although Liszt's music is un
deniably exciting, fantastic and fun, it al 1 too often
crosses the thin line between free Romanticism
and much "sound and fury signifying nothing."
This performance was no exception.
Although the quiet passages showed the sen
sitivity that was so evident in the Frank varia
tions, the loud passages were simply banged out
with impressive technique but dubious musical
ity. Furthermore, Watts has the extremely dis
tracting habit of slamming his feet on the floor and
singing along with his music. Now 1 would be the
first to defend artistic freedom, but Mr. Watts
strayed from free interpretation to bad taste. The
slapping, banging sound made by his shoes and
his atonal baritone mumbling reverberated
around the War Memorial Opera House, so that I
could not escape the distraction by merely closely
my eyes and ignoring his swinging feet.
Shattering finale
Despite these drawbacks, the performance was
exciting, and the final section — a series of stir
ring melodies and exhibitions of piano virtuosity
leading to a shattering finale — had the audience
on its feet almost before the last chord.
This week's concert will feature Janet Baker,
internationally famous contralto, in Haydn's can
tata "Ariadne auf Naxos. The orchestra will play
Haydn's overture to "Armida" and Anton Bruck
ner's Symphony No. 2 — a fine early work by this
Austrian symphonist. All performances are at the
Opera House.
The San Francisco Symphony's fourth concert
of the year, featuring conductor Seiji Ozawa and
"internationally renowned" pianist Andrew
Watts, began badly. The usual format (an over
ture, followed by a concerto and finally a sym
phonic work) was scrapped in a last minute shuf
fle, leaving the Schumann Symphony No. 1
("Spring") as the first piece, to be followed by the
shorter and lighter works featuring Watts.
The overture-concerto-symphony arrangement
is an inveterate tradition with orchestras and not
without reason, for it gives both the listener and
the orchestra a chance to "warm-up." Wednes
