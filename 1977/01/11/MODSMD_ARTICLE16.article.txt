# A
						minority opinion
## 'Rocky' lacks sensitivity 
### Howard Baldwin 
Here now is the minority opin
ion on the film that has been
knocking out both critics and
audiences everywhere. The fol
lowing opinions are those of the
writer and do not necessarily
represent t he views of the editors
of the Daily.
Critics have been falling over
their typewriters proclaiming
writer-actor Sylvestor Stallone's
triumph with the boxing film
Rocky, the story of two-bit
fighter and muscle man Rocky
Balboa, otherwise known as the
"Italian Stallion." By some
strange fluke of fate, Rocky is of
fered a chance at the heavy
weight championship of the
world.
Personally, I can't see what all
the fuss is about. Usually when 1
hold a minority opinion of a
film, I can at least understand
where everyone else is deluded.
But in this case, 1 simply can not
recognize any redeeming fea
tures that could attract anyone.
Ugly ducklings
I concede that the Marty-type
love story between two ugly
ducklings who transform each
other is affecting. Also, that
Rocky is basically a story of de
termination, of the admirable at
tribute of setting a goal for one
self and achieving it, and that
that is a pleasant thing to watch.
But even Rocky's
humanitarianism toward his dog
and his turtles and his clients is
overshadowed by the overpow
ering way in which he seduces
his girlfriend (Talia Shire) on
their first date and in which he
pummels his opponents in the
ring. This is sensitivity?
To begin with Stallone's per
formance, he acts like a cross be
tween a pre-frontal lobotomy pa
tient and Fonzie. He shows no
more versatility than he did as a
gang member in The Lords Of
Flatbush two years ago, except
that he's still impossible to un
derstand. What we have here is a
failure to communicate.
Unintelligible dialogue
Most of the actors talk like
their facial muscles are asleep,
with unintelligible dialogue.

This is compounded by the fact
that Rocky is a very noisy film.
Cheers, televisions, elevated
trains and cars all conspire to
drown out the actors' voices.
Even without dialogue to cover,
the overwhelming noise is an
noying.
As for the story, the word
'cliche' immediately comes to
mind. The story of a boxer beat
ing the odds to discover love and
self-worth strikes me as belong
ing to another era. 1 half
expected Stallone to turn to the

camera and exclaim a la
Brando, "1 coulda been a con
tender!" The expressiveness of
Stallone's script also escapes
me. Each line of dialogue (of
those I could comprehend)
seemed to be said not once but
twice for no other reason than to
put words in the actor's mouths.
Repetition didn't offer insight,
except to unnecessarily increase
awareness of the characters' al
ready obvious awkwardness.
The action progresses jerkily,
predictably, without transition.
One moment Rocky's girlfriend

is a shy and gangly ugly duckl
ing; the next moment she is a
fiery thunderball of affection
and aggression.
The film begins and ends with
boxing sequences which deserve
comment. Anyone who consid
ers them either poetic or majestic
in meaning or appearance ex
poses himself as a blood-thirsty
sadist. There is nothing attrac
tive about two men reducing
each other into bruised and scar
red towers of pain. As a matter of
fact, it's only sickening.
