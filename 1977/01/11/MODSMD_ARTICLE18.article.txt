No new taxes in state budget
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. prop
osed a $15.2 billion state budget yesterday
which he said "does not call for new taxes, not
this year, not next year, not in the foreseeable
future."
The 1977-78 budget, the biggest ever prop
osed for any state, is $1.9 billion greater than
California's spending in the current fiscal year,
and $4 billion more than the current New York
state budget.
It promises hundreds of millions of dollars
more in the coming year for homeowner and
renter tax relief, local schools support and con
struction of new prisons. But it is stingy on pay
raises for the state's 213,594 employes, ranging
from zero to five per cent raises.
"It stinks," said Rich Martin, spokesman for
t he 110,000-member California State Employees
Association.
The budget also contains Brown's first stab at
court-ordered revamping of the state's school
finance system, the only new element in a very
tight public school budget.
The school finance proposal would increase
state school spending $220 million in the first
year of a five-year, $3.3-billion proposal. Other
public school aid would increase only $70 mill
ion, or 2.4 per cent.
An even smaller raise — 2.2 per cent — is
being proposed by Brown for the 11,700 teachers
in the state university and colleges.
S.F. sheriffs to be jailed; no parole
San Francisco — San Francisco's sheriff and
undersheriff each were sentenced yesterday to
five days in jail for failing to evict the tenants of
the embattled International Hotel. But the judge
said the law officers won't have to spend the
time in their own jail.
Superior Court Judge John Benson also fined
Sheriff Richard Hongisto and his assistant James
Denman $500 each. The sentence and the fine
were maximums for the contempt of court con
victions.
Benson delayed execution of the sentence for
10 days to allow r time for an appeal, which the

defendants' attorneys say they will tile in the
next few days.
The judge said Hongisto and Denman would
not be given parole or work furlough but would
actually have to serve jail time.
NAACP urges Bell's rejection
New York — The board of directors of the
National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People voted unanimously yesterday to
urge the Senate to reject the nomination of Grif
fin Bell as U.S. attorney general.
The 65-member board's action followed a re
commendation adopted Saturday by the associa
tion's executive committee. In its resolution, the
board calls on President-elect Jimmy Carter to
nominate "a lawyer whose record and commit
ment to the removal of all barriers of racial dis
crimination through the democratic processes is
not in doubt."
Quake research funds requested
Washington — Legislation to provide $220
million on earthquake prediction research was
introduced yesterday by Sen. Alan Cranston
(D-Calif.).
The measure, which also asks for studies into
reducing losses to life and property from
temblors, calls for $70 million more than a simi
lar bill introduced by Cranston and passed last
year by the Senate, but later derailed in the
House.
Protests build over terrorist arrest
Paris — An international storm blew up yes
terday around the arrest in France of an alleged
Palestinian terrorist on suspicion of command
ing the 1972 slaying of Israeli athletes at the
Munich Olympic games.
Israel said it would ask France to hand over
the suspected terrorist, but Israeli newspapers
and experts expressed pessimism that France,
which depends on Arab oil for its energy re
quirements, would comply.
West Germany and France both claimed the
other initiated the arrest of Mohammed Daoud
Audeh, or Abu Daoud, whose capture appeared

increasingly embarrassing to France.
Arab ambassadors trooped to the French
Foreign Ministry to protest the "unfriendly ac
tion" by France in arresting a member of an
official Palestine Liberation Organization dele
gation. The office of the French president em
phasized the arrest was a "police decision" on
an international warrant.
AFL-CIO criticizes Carter program
Washington — The AFL-CIO yesterday
strongly criticized President-elect Jimmy Car
ter's two-year program of economic stimulus as
"a retreat from the goals" of his election cam
paign.
The labor federation said it would push for a
$30 billion plan emphasizing direct job creation.
In a statement, the AFL-CIO said Carter's
proposal was too small and "too ill-advised" to
pull the economy from the doldrums.
Government drops Bechtel suit
San Francisco — The Justice Department ag
reed yesterday to drop the government's civil
antitrust suit against Bechtel Corp., accused of
participating in an Arab boycott against Israel.
The proposal was filed in U.S. District Court
in San Francisco and will become final upon
approval of the court.
The suit accused the heavy construction firm
of implementing "a conspiracy to boycott cer
tain people and firms by refusing to deal and
requiring others to refuse to deal with United
States suppliers of goods or services blacklisted
by Arab league countries in connection with the
Arab boycott of Israel."
Bechtel Corp., based in San Francisco, is cur
rently working on several projects valued at sev
eral million dollars in Arab nations.
Eastern storm carries snow, rain
A winter storm carried heavy snow and freez
ing rain into the East yesterday while frigid arc
tic air brought the coldest temperatures of the
winter to the western two-thirds of the nation.
Roads were impassable, schools were closed
and storm warnings were posted in an area from
South Carolina to New England and west to the

Great Lakes.
DA drops charges in hospital case
Ventura — Four of eight Camarillo State Hos
pital employes indicted by the Ventura County
grand jury were cleared yesterday of criminal
charges stemming from patient deaths at the
mental hospital.
Hist. Atty. Stanley Trom said he requested that
charges against two doctors and two psychiatric
technicians be dismissed after he reviewed the
transcript of the jury's public investigation last
November.
In the cases of hospital physicians Jack Borel
and Bennie Barker Jr. and hospital employe Hat
tie Davis, said Trom, "I do not believe the availa
ble evidence is sufficient to establish their guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt."
Report advises federal stockpiling
Washington — The world isn't in danger of
running out of resources soon, but the govern
ment should consider stockpiling some goods to
protect against short-term shortages, a report by
a government commission said yesterday.
The National Commission on Supplies and
Shortages also passed along a recommendation
of an advisory committee that Congress create a
National Growth and Development Commission
to anticipate economic problems in advance and
develop alternatives for dealing with them.
