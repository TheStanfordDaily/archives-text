# Mem Aud fountain to be built
## 
### Laura Kennedy Staff writer 
A fountain between Hoover Tower
and Memorial Auditorium will be
built by this September, according to
Roger Buckhout, associate planner at
the university Planning Office.
"It's a simple, baroque fountain," he
said. He explained that the fountain
would consist of two vertical jets of
water falling from a top basin down
into a round concrete basin about 40
feet in diameter.
Surrounding the fountain will be
raised pavement about 100 feet in
diameter, planted with eight flowering
red chestnut trees.
Phase I of the project will cost under
$250,000, according to Buckhout. All
money for this phase is being contri
buted by alumnus Obert Tanner. No
university funds will be used. Univer
sity policy forbids making public the
exact amount of the gift without the

donor's approval, he said.
Bids on Phase I will be open next
month. Phase I will include construct
ing the fountain and pavement and re
surfacing the surrounding street.
A second phase, contemplated by
the university but not yet funded, calls
for extending decorative paving to the
curbs fronting Mem Aud and Hoover
Tower and landscaping new entr
ance way for Hoover Tower.
Thirty two parking spaces in front of
Mem Aud and Hoover Tower will be
eliminated to allow traffic flow around
the fountain. The university has no
plans to directly replace them.
"The university's desire and goal is
to remove parking from the streets into
vehicle parking lots," said Buckhout.
The university incorporated this pol
icy in its master plan in order to clear
transportation lanes and increase
safety on campus, he added.
Parking along the narrow sections of

Serra Street, which passes before Mem
Aud. will remain intact. A study will
be conducted next month to determine
if a 200-space parking lot is needed in a
vacant lot on Serra Street near the
Campus Shell Station, said Buckhout.
Tanner, who obtained his M.A. in
philosophy here in 1937, intends the
fountain to be a memorial to his son,
Dean Obert Tanner. Tanner has contri
buted money for other fountains across
the country, including one in front of
the Latter Day Saints' World Head
quarters in Tanner's hometown of Salt
Lake City.
Tanner taught philosophy here from
1940 to '45, was acting chaplain in
1944-45 and visiting chaplain in 1946.
He is a frequent university donor and
the sole donor to the Tanner
Philosophy Library.
The fountain project is designed by
Johnson and Leffingwell, a San Fran
cisco firm. Walter Guthrie is the pro
ject architect.


Big Splash
A new fountain should be bubbling away by next Sep
tember between Mem Aud and Hoover Tower. Money
is available for the fountain, but not for the decorative

paving surrounding it. Note the disappearance of 32
parking places; there are no plans to provide replace
ment space elsewhere.
