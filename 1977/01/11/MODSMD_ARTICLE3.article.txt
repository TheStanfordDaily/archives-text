# ASSU Senate lauds cautious stand by Faculty Senate
## 
### Kathy Trafton Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate passed a resolu
tion last night at its meeting in
Lagunita dining hall commending the
Faculty Senate for its "cautious" ap
proach in considering the possible
reinstitution of a foreign language re
quirement.
The resolution also asked that a task
force, which would include students,
be set up to study the future of the
foreign language program here.
The resolution was co-sponsored by
Sens. Brad Krevoy and Tim Ferguson.
Krevoy said he approved of the Fa
culty Senate's decision to consider the
necessity of having a foreign language
requirement before implementing any
program.
He said that he questioned why such
an approach was not used by the Fa
culty Senate regarding the Western
Culture requirement.
The resolution also expressed sup
port of a Faculty Senate resolution to
study the "place and function of
foreign language in the undergraduate
curriculum," and suggested that stu
dents be included on a task force for
study set up by the Faculty Senate.
Finally, the resolution requested the
"formalization of future student input
into the Western Civilization issue."
Sens. Roy Skogstrom and Jon Barth
stood upon chairs to sing their ap
proval of the resolution before it was
passed.
In other business, Sen. Rick Hoft,
spokesperson for the Senate Commit
tee on Graduate Affairs, reported four
main areas of concern for graduate
students to be discussed at the next
committee meeting on Monday.
First, "more diverse and enjoyable
housing," such as co-ops and theme
houses, is desired by graduate stu
dents, said Hoft.
Also, many graduate students
would like to see a pub or tavern
placed on campus, he said.
Third, social activities in the form of
interaction between graduate students

in different departments could be
planned.
Fourth, an orientation program for
graduate students should be provided
to familiarize graduate students with
services and activities available here.
Ted Mitchell of the ASSU Speaker's
Bureau reported to the Senate that lec
tures by Andre Almarik, Ray Bradbury
and Julian Bond are in store this winter
and spring along with a Kent State and
Jackson State memorial lecture.
Mitchell said that the bureau has
spent approximately $2400 this year
funding independent organizations as
well as presenting speakers on its own.
He said the bureau received $10,855

through its fee assessment this year,
and that it had a $500 surplus left over
from last year.
This fall, the bureau sponsored the
Harris/McCloskey debates, and guest
lectures by Frank Church, Cesar
Chavez, Jane Margolis, Dernadette De
vlin, Martin Gerry, William Wolfe and
two presentations by the Hillel Found
ation.
The senate decided last night to
send ex-football coach Jack Christian
sen a letter thanking him for his efforts
here and "wishing him good luck."
Sen. "JJ" Chao called the move "an
appropriate gesture."

reinstitution of a foreign language re
quirement.
The resolution also asked that a task
force, which would include students,
be set up to study the future of the
foreign language program here.
The resolution was co-sponsored by
Sens. Brad Krevoy and Tim Ferguson.
Krevoy said he approved of the Fa
culty Senate's decision to consider the
necessity of having a foreign language
requirement before implementing any
program.
He said that he questioned why such
an approach was not used by the Fa
culty Senate regarding the Western
Culture requirement.
The resolution also expressed sup
port of a Faculty Senate resolution to
study the "place and function of
foreign language in the undergraduate
curriculum," and suggested that stu
dents be included on a task force for
study set up by the Faculty Senate.
Finally, the resolution requested the
"formalization of future student input
into the Western Civilization issue."
Sens. Roy Skogstrom and Jon Barth
stood upon chairs to sing their ap
proval of the resolution before it was
passed.
In other business, Sen. Rick Hoft,
spokesperson for the Senate Commit
tee on Graduate Affairs, reported four
main areas of concern for graduate
students to be discussed at the next
committee meeting on Monday.
First, "more diverse and enjoyable
housing," such as co-ops and theme
houses, is desired by graduate stu
dents, said Hoft.
Also, many graduate students
would like to see a pub or tavern
placed on campus, he said.
Third, social activities in the form of
interaction between graduate students

in different departments could be
planned.
Fourth, an orientation program for
graduate students should be provided
to familiarize graduate students with
services and activities available here.
Ted Mitchell of the ASSU Speaker's
Bureau reported to the Senate that lec
tures by Andre Almarik, Ray Bradbury
and Julian Bond are in store this winter
and spring along with a Kent State and
Jackson State memorial lecture.
Mitchell said that the bureau has
spent approximately $2400 this year
funding independent organizations as
well as presenting speakers on its own.
He said the bureau received $10,855

through its fee assessment this year,
and that it had a $500 surplus left over
from last year.
This fall, the bureau sponsored the
Harris/McCloskey debates, and guest
lectures by Frank Church, Cesar
Chavez, Jane Margolis, Dernadette De
vlin, Martin Gerry, William Wolfe and
two presentations by the Hillel Found
ation.
The senate decided last night to
send ex-football coach Jack Christian
sen a letter thanking him for his efforts
here and "wishing him good luck."
Sen. "JJ" Chao called the move "an
appropriate gesture."
The ASSU Senate passed a resolu
tion last night at its meeting in
Lagunita dining hall commending the
Faculty Senate for its "cautious" ap
proach in considering the possible
