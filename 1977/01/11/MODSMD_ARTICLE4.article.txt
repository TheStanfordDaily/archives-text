# $1.5 million donated for cancer facilities
## 
### Karen Wada Staff writer 
The Medical School here has re
ceived $1.5 million to complete its
cancer research facilities from a na
tional philanthropic organization.
The award, given by the Max C.
Fleischmann Fund, will be used to
complete and to partially equip im
munology and animal virology
laboratories on the third floor of the
new Sherman Fairchild Center, ac
cording to Medical School Dean
Clayton Rich.
The building, located on the hospi
tal's south side, already houses the
Departments of Structural Biology and
Neurobiology.
"We asked for the money to finish
what is now only four walls, a ceiling,
and a floor," explained Terry Denley,
associate director for development at
the medical center. The request was
submitted in a proposal prepared by
faculty, administrators and the univer
sity Development Committee.
"The Fleischmann Fund has always
shown interest in medicine...so we

hoped they would help us," said De
nley.
Denley said the fund's past contribu
tions have been used to build the med
ical school cardiovascular disease
center and the Max C. Fleischmann
Laboratories.
"This (year's) grant will have great
impact on cancer research," he said.
Immunology division head Hugh
McDevitt felt completion of the Fair
child facilities will help further de
velop the immunology and animal
virology program at the basic level.
"We are not looking for applied
ideas. A lot has been done with that;
none of it was very productive," said
McDevitt.
He said virologists, directed by a
"soon to be recruited chairman," will
study the influence of viruses in caus
ing cancer.
McDevitt said his staff will work on
cell and cell surface behavior as well as
genetic control of immune responses
to foreign substances (antigens) in cell
structure.
