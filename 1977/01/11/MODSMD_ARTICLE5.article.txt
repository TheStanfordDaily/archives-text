The search for radio signals sent by
extraterrestrial life must proceed
"immediately" before man-made in
terference makes the possibility of re
ception even more remote.
This is the consensus of a recently
completed study conducted by the
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence
program (SETI) at the Ames Research
Center in Mountain View. The two
year study analyzed the feasibility of
intercepting radio signals from
another planet.
According to John Wolfe, deputy
program chief, SETI proposes to de
velop subsystems for use on existing
radio antenna facilities which would
monitor the radio frequencies most
likely to be used for interplanetary
communication.
If extraterrestrial life is transmitting
messages, it probably is doing so in
"an exceedingly narrow band, less
than one cycle per second," said
Wolfe. This band is referred to by re
searchers as "the microwave win
dow," he said.
Wolfe explained that a narrow band
would probably be used because
"physical arguments tell you that (at
microwave frequencies) the sky is least
noisy and that for the same amount of
energy the signal will go for longer
distances."
A million channels
The proposed subsystems would
consist of very low noise receivers and
data processors which could monitor
one million frequency channels simul
taneously. This is one thousand times
the capability of present technology.
In addition, the subsystems would
include pattern recognition equip

ment to discern between natural,
man-made and extraterrestrial signals.
"Radio astronomers have never looked
for narrow band radio sources," said
Wolfe, so even if no signals from
another planet are received, "good
fundamental radio astronomy will
come out of (the program)."
This work must be done im
mediately because man-made radio in
terference is increasing. "We are start
ing to put up navigation satellites
which operate in the microwave win
dows and which pump down
kilowatts of power," said Wolfe. They
will make the search for signals
"which are potentially exceedingly
weak" even more difficult, he said.
In 1979, the World Administrative
Radio Conference will meet in Geneva
to "slice up the radio frequency spec
trum pie," said Wolfe. By then, the
SETI program hopes to know which
frequencies are most likely to be used
for extraterrestrial transmission so that
it can seek protection from interfer
ence, he said.
Costly operation
If the proposal is approved by the
National Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration (NASA), which funds
both SETI and Ames, the subsystems
may be operational by 1978, said
Wolfe. He estimated the cost of the pro
ject in the millions of dollars, equiva
lent to 10 per cent of NASA's Jupiter
and Pioneer missions.
According to Wolfe, SETI began in
1970 as a summer study sponsored by
Ames, NASA. Stanford University and
the American Society of Engineering
Education. The study suggested the
development of technologies for the

purpose of searching for radio trans
mission from extraterrestrial life.
SETI developed the Cyclops concept
in 1971. Cyclops is a ground based,
phased array of over 1000 one
hundred-meter radio dishes designed
to monitor hundreds of frequency
channels simultaneously. However,
this concept has been deferred in favor
of the development of signal proces
sing equipment in the proposed sub
systems, according to Allen Peterson,
an electrical engineering professor
working with the SETI program.
The SETI program is not concerned
with the transmission of signals, said
Wolfe. "It's silly to build a transmitter
until we know where they are," he
said. And the earth has been putting
out enormous power through UHF
television transmission for years.
"We're already a transmitter," he said.

another planet.
According to John Wolfe, deputy
program chief, SETI proposes to de
velop subsystems for use on existing
radio antenna facilities which would
monitor the radio frequencies most
likely to be used for interplanetary
communication.
If extraterrestrial life is transmitting
messages, it probably is doing so in
"an exceedingly narrow band, less
than one cycle per second," said
Wolfe. This band is referred to by re
searchers as "the microwave win
dow," he said.
Wolfe explained that a narrow band
would probably be used because
"physical arguments tell you that (at
microwave frequencies) the sky is least
noisy and that for the same amount of
energy the signal will go for longer
distances."
A million channels
The proposed subsystems would
consist of very low noise receivers and
data processors which could monitor
one million frequency channels simul
taneously. This is one thousand times
the capability of present technology.
In addition, the subsystems would
include pattern recognition equip

ment to discern between natural,
man-made and extraterrestrial signals.
"Radio astronomers have never looked
for narrow band radio sources," said
Wolfe, so even if no signals from
another planet are received, "good
fundamental radio astronomy will
come out of (the program)."
This work must be done im
mediately because man-made radio in
terference is increasing. "We are start
ing to put up navigation satellites
which operate in the microwave win
dows and which pump down
kilowatts of power," said Wolfe. They
will make the search for signals
"which are potentially exceedingly
weak" even more difficult, he said.
In 1979, the World Administrative
Radio Conference will meet in Geneva
to "slice up the radio frequency spec
trum pie," said Wolfe. By then, the
SETI program hopes to know which
frequencies are most likely to be used
for extraterrestrial transmission so that
it can seek protection from interfer
ence, he said.
Costly operation
If the proposal is approved by the
National Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration (NASA), which funds
both SETI and Ames, the subsystems
may be operational by 1978, said
Wolfe. He estimated the cost of the pro
ject in the millions of dollars, equiva
lent to 10 per cent of NASA's Jupiter
and Pioneer missions.
According to Wolfe, SETI began in
1970 as a summer study sponsored by
Ames, NASA. Stanford University and
the American Society of Engineering
Education. The study suggested the

purpose of searching for radio trans
mission from extraterrestrial life.
SETI developed the Cyclops concept
in 1971. Cyclops is a ground based,
phased array of over 1000 one
hundred-meter radio dishes designed
to monitor hundreds of frequency
channels simultaneously. However,
this concept has been deferred in favor
of the development of signal proces
sing equipment in the proposed sub
systems, according to Allen Peterson,
an electrical engineering professor
working with the SETI program.
The SETI program is not concerned
with the transmission of signals, said
Wolfe. "It's silly to build a transmitter
until we know where they are," he
said. And the earth has been putting
out enormous power through UHF
television transmission for years.
"We're already a transmitter," he said.
The search for radio signals sent by
extraterrestrial life must proceed
"immediately" before man-made in
terference makes the possibility of re
ception even more remote.
This is the consensus of a recently
completed study conducted by the
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence
program (SETI) at the Ames Research
Center in Mountain View. The two
year study analyzed the feasibility of
intercepting radio signals from
another planet.
