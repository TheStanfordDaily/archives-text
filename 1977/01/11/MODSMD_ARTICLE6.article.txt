## Aid only needy athletes 
### 
Delegates to the 71st annual NCAA Conven
tion in Miami Beach hold the fate of college
athletics, as constituted now, in their hands.
Among the 175 legislative amendments that
the delegates will consider this week are 37
financial aid proposals. President Richard Ly
man, whose "need" proposal failed in a 119-
119 deadlock vote last year, will again lead the
charge to change the scholarship rule this year.
Under Lyman's proposal college athletes
would still receive tuition and mandatory fees,
but the remaining financial support would be
based on the ability of a student-athlete's family
to finance his/her college education.
Savings would be substantial. Stanford
would save up to $150,000 per year, while
major athletic powers such as Michigan would
save upward of $300,000. Presently athletes
can receive full tuition, room and board.
With the cost of college athletics soaring al
most as fast as tuition, the NCAA can ill afford
to let this madness continue.
Last year more than half of the 247 Division I
members lost money on athletics. Under these
circumstances, it seems foolish for the NCAA

not to consider the "need" proposal which
would save a large amount of money.
NCAA president John Fuzak, of Michigan
State, said when the Big Ten tried the "need"
formula a couple of years ago it was a disaster
and led to the decline of conference football
and basketball teams.
If the "need" proposal were instituted by the
NCAA, all colleges would be operating under
the same guidelines. Theoretically then, all ath
letic departments would not fear falling behind
other schools.
Opponents have also argued that the "need"
proposal will lead to cheating. Michigan Athle
tic Director Don Canham said that when the Big
Ten used the need formula some schools gave
athletes work-study jobs such as screwing in
light bulbs. But we believe the need proposal
couldn't produce any more violations of NCAA
rules than already occur right now.
If delegates to the NCAA convention don't
act on Lyman's need proposal, the NCAA faces
a slow decay, as more and more colleges decide
the cost of athletics is just too great and choose
to cut back their programs.
