# Androgyny House needed here
## 
### 
Lupi, Angeles

We propose a student residence,
Androgyny House .centered around an
awareness of how traditional male/
female roles are dehumanizing and
oppressive to individuals and society.
Androgyny House, a co-op, will st
rive to incorporate its theme of
feminism/humanism into both
academic and day-to-day aspects of
living. The house will serve as a cam
pus center for speakers, organizations
and SWOPSI classes relating to the
theme of androgyny.
Since 1848, when women publicly
came together for the first American
Women's Rights Convention at Seneca
Falls, N.Y., feminism has become a
vital movement aimed at releasing
both men and women from society's
restrictive sex roles. Although some
progress has subsequently been made,
sexism is still abundant in our society.
Sexism undisputedly exists in the
job market. In the last 20 years, a wo
man's wage earnings relative to a
man's has decreased. From 1955 to
1975, women's mean hourly earnings
compared to men's has dropped from
67 per cent to 63 per cent.
Virtual exclusion
_ Women remain only a small percen
tage of the professional work force and
are virtually excluded from positions
of power. Most working women are
relegated to lower-paying, stereotypi
cally "feminine" jobs (secretary, re
ceptionist, etc.).
When Jimmy Carter recently as
serted that not enough qualified
women for top level Cabinet positions
were available, Juanita Kreps, Carter's
choice for secretary of commerce,
suggested that the President-elect
more probably was just making ex
cuses for not looking in the right
places.
Sexism exists here. Only 35 per cent
of tenured and associate professor
ships listed in the 1975 Faculty-Staff
Directory were women.
Feminism asks men and women to
face the vital question of why these
situations persist. It attempts to show
how individuals are programmed to fit
preconceived patterns of thinking and
acting that dehumanize and deny
sexual equality.
Basic change
Feminism/humanism works toward
far more than an equalization of statis
tics; it seeks a basic attitudinal and be
havior change in the ways men and
women interrelate.
Sexism permeates our lives in other
more subtle ways. The research of
Asst. Psychology Prof. Sandra Bern
suggests that very "feminine" indi
viduals tend to have high anxiety, low
self-esteem, and low social accep
tance, while very "masculine" indi
viduals tend to have high anxiety, low
self-acceptance, and high neuroti
cism. . .
In a 1975 speech entitled "Beyond
Androgyny." Bern argued forcefully
for the development of androgynous

individuals by saying, "The two do
mains of male and female are both
fundamental. In a modern complex
society like ours, an adult clearly has
to be able to look out for himself and to
get things done.
"But an adult also has to be able to
relate to other human beings as people,
to be sensitive to their needs and to be
concerned about their welfare, as well
as to be able to depend on them for
emotional support.
Destructive
"Limiting a person's ability to re
spond in one or the other of these two
complementary domains thus seems
tragically and unnecessarily destruc
tive of human potential."
We agree it is preferable for women
to be less demeaningly "submissive"
and for men to be less unemotionally
"dominant." Those of us who are
women want to be treated with dignity
as humans, not as individuals who
comprise only a part of the "male"
world. Those of us who are men want
to overcome our hardened spirits — to
hug male friends without ridicule and
to cry without shame.
Androgyny House would be a un
ique campus living situation where
students could maximize feminist/
humanist values in their lives. It

would also serve as a center for
feminist/humanist events information,
speakers and film series, and classes.
The current absence of such a center
is acutely felt as there is no formal
Women's Studies department or prog
ram. Moreover, Androgyny House
would be the first opportunity for mole
feminists to collectively develop their
consciousnesses.

both men and women from society's
restrictive sex roles. Although some
progress has subsequently been made,
sexism is still abundant in our society.
Sexism undisputedly exists in the
job market. In the last 20 years, a wo
man's wage earnings relative to a
man's has decreased. From 1955 to
1975, women's mean hourly earnings
compared to men's has dropped from
67 per cent to 63 per cent.
Virtual exclusion
_ Women remain only a small percen
tage of the professional work force and
are virtually excluded from positions
of power. Most working women are
relegated to lower-paying, stereotypi
cally "feminine" jobs (secretary, re
ceptionist, etc.).
When Jimmy Carter recently as
serted that not enough qualified
women for top level Cabinet positions
were available, Juanita Kreps, Carter's
choice for secretary of commerce,
suggested that the President-elect
more probably was just making ex
cuses for not looking in the right
places.
Sexism exists here. Only 35 per cent
of tenured and associate professor
ships listed in the 1975 Faculty-Staff
Directory were women.
Feminism asks men and women to
face the vital question of why these
situations persist. It attempts to show
how individuals are programmed to fit
preconceived patterns of thinking and
acting that dehumanize and deny
sexual equality.
Basic change
Feminism/humanism works toward
far more than an equalization of statis
tics; it seeks a basic attitudinal and be
havior change in the ways men and
women interrelate.
Sexism permeates our lives in other
more subtle ways. The research of
Asst. Psychology Prof. Sandra Bern
suggests that very "feminine" indi
viduals tend to have high anxiety, low
self-esteem, and low social accep
tance, while very "masculine" indi
viduals tend to have high anxiety, low
self-acceptance, and high neuroti
cism. . .
In a 1975 speech entitled "Beyond
Androgyny." Bern argued forcefully
for the development of androgynous

individuals by saying, "The two do
mains of male and female are both
fundamental. In a modern complex
society like ours, an adult clearly has
to be able to look out for himself and to
get things done.
"But an adult also has to be able to
relate to other human beings as people,
to be sensitive to their needs and to be
concerned about their welfare, as well
as to be able to depend on them for
emotional support.
Destructive
"Limiting a person's ability to re
spond in one or the other of these two
complementary domains thus seems
tragically and unnecessarily destruc
tive of human potential."
We agree it is preferable for women
to be less demeaningly "submissive"
and for men to be less unemotionally
"dominant." Those of us who are
women want to be treated with dignity
as humans, not as individuals who
comprise only a part of the "male"
world. Those of us who are men want
to overcome our hardened spirits — to
hug male friends without ridicule and
to cry without shame.
Androgyny House would be a un
ique campus living situation where
students could maximize feminist/
humanist values in their lives. It

would also serve as a center for
feminist/humanist events information,
speakers and film series, and classes.
The current absence of such a center
is acutely felt as there is no formal
Women's Studies department or prog
ram. Moreover, Androgyny House
would be the first opportunity for mole
feminists to collectively develop their
consciousnesses.

Lupi, Angeles

We propose a student residence,
