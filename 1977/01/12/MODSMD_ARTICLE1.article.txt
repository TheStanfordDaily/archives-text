## 
### Robert Mauro Staff writer 
Following a high-speed chase and
gun battle, a day-long manhunt for the
robbers of a Woodside bank resulted in
the arrest of two suspects in Portola
Valley late last night.
San Mateo County sheriff's deputies
had pursued two men in a wild chase
which covered the Midpeninsula —
including a stretch along Al
pine Road on the Stanford campus.
The two turned down Los Trancos
Road and ditched their car about a
quarter-mile down the road before flee
ing into the woods, according to de
puties. They had made off with about
$17,000 in the robbery of a Wells Fargo
Bank at 9:20 a.m., the Associated Press
reported.
Police set up a dragnet, and one of
the suspects, described only as a black
male, walked into it at about 9:20 p.m.,
according to San Mateo County Sheriff
John McDonald.
"He ran and tried to pull his gun,"
McDonald reported. Deputies shot at
him and arrested him. taking him to
Stanford Hospital.
Harold Lewis, a black male, was ad
mitted to Stanford Hospital at about 10
p.m., accompanied by San Mateo
County sheriff's deputies, according to
a hospital staff member. He underwent
surgery for two gunshot wounds to the
abdomen and was listed in stable con
dition.
The second suspect was nearby, ac
cording to McDonald, but refused to
surrender.
"He was in the dark and in the
woods. The dog took him down,"
McDonald explained.
Police booked Walter Bob Bigelow, a
46-year-old white male, for bank rob
bery and attempted murder. A
spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) said FBI agents
were "near the scene" of the arrest —
Portolaand Alpineroads — but did not
participate. McDonald said dozens of
deputies were involved in the second
arrest, which took place at about 9:50
p.m.
The bizarre set of events leading to
the arrests began at 9:20 a.m. yesterday
at the Wells Fargo Bank at 2925 Wood
side Road, Woodside.
Bates said that a black male ap
proached a teller, saying, "This is a
holdup," as he revealed the butt of a
handgun stuck in his waistband. His
white partner then confronted a sec
ond teller.
As they attempted to escape in a
late-model Lincoln Continental
Mach-4, San Mateo County sheriff's
deputies responding to the bank alarm
took up pursuit.
The suspects fired shots at the de
puties as they raced down Whiskey
Hill to Sand Hill Road, where they

turned east.
According to California Highway
Patrol Officer Mark Sooy, the suspects'
car was found abandoned about a quar
ter of a mile south of Alpine Road on
Los Trancos Road. Apparently, the
pursuing officers drew hack to avoid
being wounded, allowing the men
enough time to disappear into the sur
rounding woods on foot, he said.
Smoke was billowing from the sus
pects' car when the deputies arrived,
McDonald said. Thinking that a sus
pect was still inside, deputies fired

shots at the vehicle in an attempt to
drive him out.
A day-long search then ensued. Two
helicopters, several police dogs and
approximately 70 law enforcement of
ficers were involved. For most of its
duration, the manhunt centered on the
estate of the parents of Fredrick
Woods, who is awaiting trial for the
July 15 kidnaping of 26 Chowchilla
school children and their bus driver.
It was not until 9:20 p.m., 12 hours
after the robbery, that the suspects
were again spotted.

As they attempted to escape in a
late-model Lincoln Continental
Mach-4, San Mateo County sheriff's
deputies responding to the bank alarm
took up pursuit.
The suspects fired shots at the de
puties as they raced down Whiskey
Hill to Sand Hill Road, where they

turned east.
According to California Highway
Patrol Officer Mark Sooy, the suspects'
car was found abandoned about a quar
ter of a mile south of Alpine Road on
Los Trancos Road. Apparently, the
pursuing officers drew hack to avoid
being wounded, allowing the men
enough time to disappear into the sur
rounding woods on foot, he said.
Smoke was billowing from the sus
pects' car when the deputies arrived,
McDonald said. Thinking that a sus
pect was still inside, deputies fired

shots at the vehicle in an attempt to
drive him out.
A day-long search then ensued. Two
helicopters, several police dogs and
approximately 70 law enforcement of
ficers were involved. For most of its
duration, the manhunt centered on the
estate of the parents of Fredrick
Woods, who is awaiting trial for the
July 15 kidnaping of 26 Chowchilla
school children and their bus driver.
It was not until 9:20 p.m., 12 hours
after the robbery, that the suspects
were again spotted.
Following a high-speed chase and
gun battle, a day-long manhunt for the
robbers of a Woodside bank resulted in
the arrest of two suspects in Portola
Valley late last night.
San Mateo County sheriff's deputies
had pursued two men in a wild chase
which covered the Midpeninsula —
including a stretch along Al
pine Road on the Stanford campus.
The two turned down Los Trancos
Road and ditched their car about a
quarter-mile down the road before flee
ing into the woods, according to de
puties. They had made off with about
$17,000 in the robbery of a Wells Fargo
Bank at 9:20 a.m., the Associated Press
reported.
Police set up a dragnet, and one of
the suspects, described only as a black
male, walked into it at about 9:20 p.m.,
according to San Mateo County Sheriff
John McDonald.
"He ran and tried to pull his gun,"
McDonald reported. Deputies shot at
him and arrested him. taking him to
Stanford Hospital.
Harold Lewis, a black male, was ad
mitted to Stanford Hospital at about 10
p.m., accompanied by San Mateo
County sheriff's deputies, according to
a hospital staff member. He underwent
surgery for two gunshot wounds to the
abdomen and was listed in stable con
dition.
The second suspect was nearby, ac
cording to McDonald, but refused to
surrender.
"He was in the dark and in the
woods. The dog took him down,"
McDonald explained.
Police booked Walter Bob Bigelow, a
46-year-old white male, for bank rob
bery and attempted murder. A
spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) said FBI agents
were "near the scene" of the arrest —
Portolaand Alpineroads — but did not
participate. McDonald said dozens of
deputies were involved in the second
arrest, which took place at about 9:50
p.m.
The bizarre set of events leading to
the arrests began at 9:20 a.m. yesterday
at the Wells Fargo Bank at 2925 Wood
side Road, Woodside.
Bates said that a black male ap
proached a teller, saying, "This is a
holdup," as he revealed the butt of a
handgun stuck in his waistband. His
white partner then confronted a sec
ond teller.
