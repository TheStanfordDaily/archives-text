# Criticism of Ruetz unfounded

Just recently I received several
copies of the Duily containing articles,
editorials and letters concerning the
termination of Jack Christiansen as
Stanford's football coach. In several
instances Joe Ruetz, Stanford's athletic
director, has been severely criticized
for his actions.
It would be a grave injustice if the act
of firing Christiansen (assuming it to
have been wrong) would overshadow
the accomplishments, aspirations, and
integrity of }oe Ruetz in his role of ath
letic director.
For the past three academic years l
served as chairman of the Committee
on Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation (CAPER). In that capacity 1
worked very closely with Ruetz and
his staff, providing input and criticism
when appropriate.
Enormous problems
In my opinion there is no person
more honorable or dedicated to the
educational goals of the university
than is Ruetz. His administrative prob
lems have been enormous.
In addition, major changes have
been implemented, causing a number
of difficult choices as to allocation of
resources. For example, the growing
demands for intercollegiate oppor
tunities for women have not merely
received Ruetz' sympathetic ear, but
major actions have been taken to ex
pand the overall women's program.
Ruetz has not yielded grudgingly,
inch-by-inch, as have many; he has
moved forward actively and boldly on
such matters as planning for new wo
men's sports, hiring new coaches,
equalizing used facilities and equip
ment, etc.
Dedicated
Ruetz is dedicated to improving op
portunities of the individual student
who does not qualify for or desire in
tercollegiate competition. Instruc
tional programs and intramurals are
high on his list of priorities.
He views every coach as a teacher
who must relate not only to team
players but to other students'who want
to improve their athletic skills. Furth
ermore, and most important, he has
demonstrated over and over again that
he firmly ascribes to the view that
Stanford is first and foremost an
academic institution to be governed by
the university president, not some
"athletic establishment."
The Stanford community — stu
dents, faculty, administration and
alumni — all owe much to Ruetz. The
idea that he wants to turn Stanford into
a camp for professional athletes, even
if that were practicable, is ludicrous.
