## Yugoslavs prepare for Tito's death 
### Terry Ross 
Because of the advanced age of
Yugoslavian leader Tito, Yugos
lav Communists are taking
political and military measures
to assure a peaceful succession
to new leadership and prevent
Soviet or Soviet-inspired inter
vention after his death, History
Prof. Wayne Vucinich said in a
public address recently.
Vucinich, curator of the Rus
sian collection at the Hoover In
stitution, said that these mea
sures include the introduction of
a collective legislative body
composed of representatives
from the rural republics and the
introduction of universal milit
ary training.
The new legislative body
would run the country after
Tito's death until such time as a
sole leader is found to take over
the duties. The new civil defense
system is intended to de
monstrate the Yugoslavs' will to
remain outside of Soviet
hegemony.
The preservation of neutral
Yugoslavia, even though corn

munist, is of vital concern to the
U.S. and the NATO allies, Vuc
inich said. A Soviet foothold on
the perimeter of the Alps and the
Mediterranean basin would
seriously undermine the NATO
security system in Europe par
ticularly in light of the gains
made by the Italian Communists
during the recent Italian elec
tions.
But to resist foreign intrusion
Yugoslavia must be strong, he
said. There are nationalist
groups that seek the fragmenta
tion of Yugoslavia into separate
ethnic components, "even
though forces favoring the union
of the South Slavs (Croats,
Macedonians, Serbs, and
Slovenes) far exceed those that
operate against union," he
noted.
However, Vucinich believes
that as long as Yugoslavia pre
sents the appearance of unity, the
Soviets will be reluctant to inter
fere. "The key is to keep them
(the Russians) guessing," he
said.
Vuchinich characterized
President-elect Carter's cam
paign statement that he would
not use U.S. forces to prevent
Soviet interference in Yugos
lavia as a serious mistake in that
it eliminates part of the am
biguity of the situation for the
Russians.
He went on to say that the a
blity of the U.S. and the NATO
allies to project enough strength
into this region to deter the
Soviets has always been in ques
tion and that Carter's statement
merely confirmed this for the
Russians.

said. There are nationalist
groups that seek the fragmenta
tion of Yugoslavia into separate
ethnic components, "even
though forces favoring the union
of the South Slavs (Croats,
Macedonians, Serbs, and
Slovenes) far exceed those that
operate against union," he
noted.
However, Vucinich believes
that as long as Yugoslavia pre
sents the appearance of unity, the
Soviets will be reluctant to inter
fere. "The key is to keep them
(the Russians) guessing," he
said.
Vuchinich characterized
President-elect Carter's cam
paign statement that he would
not use U.S. forces to prevent
Soviet interference in Yugos
lavia as a serious mistake in that
it eliminates part of the am
biguity of the situation for the
Russians.
He went on to say that the a
blity of the U.S. and the NATO
allies to project enough strength
into this region to deter the
Soviets has always been in ques
tion and that Carter's statement
merely confirmed this for the
Russians.
