## Pac-8 home opener Injured Cards host USC 
### David Georgette 
When a team has lost 16 con
secutive Pacific-8 conference
basketball games, there would
seem to be only one way to go —
up. However, the USC Trojans,
3-10 overall this season, could
set new standards of ineptitude
should they fail to gain a victory
the next few days in the Bay
Area.
Tomorrow USC invades
Maples Pavilion to take on Stan
ford at 8 p.m. (KZSU 90.1 FM).
Saturday afternoon coach Bob
Boyd's Trojans visit Harmon
Cym across the Bay in a region
ally telecast game against
California, which is also winless
in the Pac-8.
The executives at NBC and
TVS probably want the Bears
and the Trojans to get on televi
sion early in the season before
binoculars are needed to see
them in the depths of the stand
ings.
Perfect mark
In the Trojans' trip to northern
California last year, the Cardi
nals picked up a 96-83 victory.
Then USC insured itself of a per
fect season by losing to the Bears
in overtime, 96-94.
If the Trojans do not win at
least one game this time, the
days of Bob Boyd's summer bas
ketball camp at Occidental Col
lege in Los Angeles probably
have seen their last visitor.
Coach Dick Dißiaso's Cardi
nals, 7-5 overall, are not in a very

enviable position, either. After
having dropped two games in
Washington last weekend, a loss
to the Trojans would place the
Cards at 0-3 with the UCLA
Bruins on deck Saturday night.
And then the Cards would have
to wait until February for
another crack at a Pac-8 triumph.
League play resumes next month
after a break to allow those
schools on the semester system a
break for finals.
First win
The game, then is more than
just a meeting of two teams look
ing for their first win. And both
teams will have a key player
sidelined because of injury.
Jay Carter, a starting B-foot-4
forward for the Cards, is ex
pected to miss tomorrow's game
and the UCLA contest because of
a sprained arch suffered against
Washington State last week.
"Right now we're not count
ing on Jay for this week's
games," Dißiaso said. "We'll be
trying to find the right playing
combinations for USC and
UCLA."
Hopefully these combinations
can make up Carter's 10.4 scor
ing average and seven rebounds
per game. Dißiaso will probably
start 6-7 Mark Fitzner or 6-IOV2
freshman Tom Schmalzried in
Carter's spot.
Stress fracture
On the Trojan side, senior
Creg White, a 6-8 forward, is out
with a foot stress fracture. Last

season White played in all the
Trojans' games and was their
leading rebounder and second
leading scorer.
White's absence was felt last
weekend as the Trojans lost to
Oregon State 58-50 and Oregon
64-52. "USC probably played
better in their two games than we
did," Dißiaso said. "They are a
very disciplined team with ex
cellent patience in their of
fense."
The Trojans' main man is
senior 6-2 guard Marv Safford
from Worcester, Mass. He is one
of only two out-of-state players
Boyd has on his roster. In last
year's game at Maples, Safford
scored a game-high 22 points.
Ile averaged 18 poi nts a game for
USC last year while hitting 51
per cent from the floor.

This year Safford is averaging
12.6 a game, lunior forward
Cleve Porter is scoring 11.2 a
game and Paul Henderson is
third in team scoring with 10.5 a
game.
"USC has two fine outside
shooters in thebackcourt in Saf
ford and (Mark) Wulfemeyer.
Their front line is very physi
cal," said Dißiaso.
Wulfemeyer is a prolific shoo
ter who can turn a game around.
His long-range jumpers could be
trouble for the Cards' zone de
fense if he is hitting or bad news
for USC if he is missing.
Dißiaso is not fretting over the
Cards' last two efforts. "1 have
confidence in our players' abil
ity to bounce back from last
week's losses," he said. "That
was the first time all year we've
lost two games in a row."
