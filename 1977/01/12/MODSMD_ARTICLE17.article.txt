# Gene Mayer turns pro
## 
### Jeff Brandon 
| The Stanford tennis team has
i lost another top player to the pro
ranks. Number one ranked
amateur in the world, Gene
Mayer has decided to make ten
nis his profession.
Stanford fans may have never
had a chance to see Mayer at full
strength in his career at Stan
ford. Plagued by injuries, he was
unable to play singles in any
dual matches last year and for
the last two years was kept out of
the NCAA Championships.
J "With such a high ranking,"
(48th in the world, ahead of such

players as Billy Martin, Bill
Scanlon, Tony Roche, and even
his brother, Sandy), "Gene
would definitely be sacrificing a
great deal as far as Association of
Tennis Professionals (ATP)
points and money to come back
to play for us this spring," exp
lains tennis coach Dick Gould.
The loss of a player of Gene
Mayer's caliber would hurt any
team, but to this year's team the
loss might not hurt the Card net
ters as much as another squad.
Matt Mitchell, who is in con
tention with Bill Maze for the
number one slot, said, "I feel if

anything this will makethe team
closer. Everybody is secure
about their position. We're a
young team and I feel this ex
perience will make us closer."
Losing a top player is nothing
new to Stanford tennis fans who
have seen such top players as
Sandy Mayer, Chico Hagey, John
Whitlinger, and Nick Saviano
leave the farm to join the pro cir
cuit before graduation. Mayer
was another of the good
amateurs to leave with eligibility
left. He had a great fall tourna
ment season, reaching the finals
of two professional tourna
ments, and winning an amateur
tourney in Japan.
Mayer came to Stanford after a
highly successful prep career at
Wayne Valley, N.J. High School.
His varsity career record at
Stanford is 20-2.
