# Arizona schools officially accepted
## 
### 
From th« Associated Press
Miami Beach, Fla. Arizona
and Arizona State have been of
ficially accepted into the
Pacific-8 Conference, Executive
Director Wiles Hal lock an
nounced yesterday at the 71st
NCAA convention.
The two Arizona schools, cur
rently members of the Western
Athletic Conference were in
vited to join thePac-8 last month
and each had previously an
nounced its acceptance of the
invitation.
Assistant Executive Director
David Price said that while the
two schools will join the league
July 1, 1978 they will not be able
to particpate in football until
1982.
"If they can not compete in
football in 1978, then they will
not share in either our television
or Rose Bowl receipts," said
Price. "The Arizona schools will
participate in all other sports,
however, starting in the 1978-79
school year.
Fake schedules
The Pac.-8 athletic directors
had drawn up mock schedules
which included the two schools
in the 1978 football slate. In 1978
Cal was scheduled to play both
Arizona schools and Stanford
was slated to play Arizona State.
But the Arizona schools were
unable to break their football

commitments in the WAC over
the next five years. Both schools
are making every effort to read
just their football schedules,"
said Price, "so they could have
the seven required conference
opponents by 1978. But right
now 1982 is the probable date
when they will become eligible."
No reorganization
The NCAA in its first session
yesterday tabled its controver
sial reorganization plan, thus
erasing in 10 minutes a proposal
which was in the works for al
most a year.
The action, as the annual
NCAA business session got
under way, was a victory for
many big-time basketball
schools, especially those with
out Division 1 football programs.
Under the plan, a school
would have had to field teams in
at least eight varsity sports, in
cluding football and basketball,
and maintain performance stan
dards in all eight sports to keep
their Division I standing.
Of the 247 Division 1 member
schools, only 137 play major col
lege football.
The move to table the issue
came at the request of Peter A.
Carlesimo, athletic director at
Fordham University. He had the
support of many schools in the
Eastern College Athletic Confer
ence, the NCAA's largest allied
member.
Division 1 schools such as the
University of San Francisco,
Marquette and Providence have
highly ranked basketball teams
but do not play varsity football.
Another Top Twenty basketball
school, Nevada-Las Vegas, is
classified Division II in football.
J. Neils Thompson of the Uni
versity of Texas, a member of the
policy-making NCAA Council
which sponsored the reorganiza
tion plan and chairman of the
Division I Steering Committee
which formulated it, said there
was general agreement that
some form of reclassification is
needed.

Arizona schools and Stanford
was slated to play Arizona State.
But the Arizona schools were
unable to break their football

commitments in the WAC over
the next five years. Both schools
are making every effort to read
just their football schedules,"
said Price, "so they could have
the seven required conference
opponents by 1978. But right
now 1982 is the probable date
when they will become eligible."
No reorganization
The NCAA in its first session
yesterday tabled its controver
sial reorganization plan, thus
erasing in 10 minutes a proposal
which was in the works for al
most a year.
The action, as the annual
NCAA business session got
under way, was a victory for
many big-time basketball
schools, especially those with
out Division 1 football programs.
Under the plan, a school
would have had to field teams in
at least eight varsity sports, in
cluding football and basketball,
and maintain performance stan
dards in all eight sports to keep
their Division I standing.
Of the 247 Division 1 member
schools, only 137 play major col
lege football.
The move to table the issue
came at the request of Peter A.
Carlesimo, athletic director at
Fordham University. He had the
support of many schools in the
Eastern College Athletic Confer
ence, the NCAA's largest allied
member.
Division 1 schools such as the
University of San Francisco,
Marquette and Providence have
highly ranked basketball teams
but do not play varsity football.
Another Top Twenty basketball
school, Nevada-Las Vegas, is
classified Division II in football.
J. Neils Thompson of the Uni
versity of Texas, a member of the
policy-making NCAA Council
which sponsored the reorganiza
tion plan and chairman of the
Division I Steering Committee
which formulated it, said there
was general agreement that
some form of reclassification is
needed.
From th« Associated Press
Miami Beach, Fla. Arizona
and Arizona State have been of
ficially accepted into the
Pacific-8 Conference, Executive
Director Wiles Hal lock an
nounced yesterday at the 71st
NCAA convention.
The two Arizona schools, cur
rently members of the Western
Athletic Conference were in
vited to join thePac-8 last month
and each had previously an
nounced its acceptance of the
invitation.
Assistant Executive Director
David Price said that while the
two schools will join the league
July 1, 1978 they will not be able
to particpate in football until
1982.
"If they can not compete in
football in 1978, then they will
not share in either our television
or Rose Bowl receipts," said
Price. "The Arizona schools will
participate in all other sports,
however, starting in the 1978-79
school year.
Fake schedules
The Pac.-8 athletic directors
had drawn up mock schedules
which included the two schools
in the 1978 football slate. In 1978
Cal was scheduled to play both
Arizona schools and Stanford
was slated to play Arizona State.
But the Arizona schools were
unable to break their football

commitments in the WAC over
the next five years. Both schools
are making every effort to read
