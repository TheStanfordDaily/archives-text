# West Point to Stanford
## Swimmer finds a home here

Sandy Mac Donald is not a superstar in
the world of swimming. Yet his hard
work and dedication to the sport, not
Olympic gold medals or world records,
have made him one of the most respected
members of the swim team.
Few things have come easily for Mac-
Donald, a senior butterflier from Alamo.
Born with short tendons in the back of
his legs and disintegrated hip joints, doc
tors suggested that he start swimming
when he was only nine months old.
"Later I went to a chiropractor who
stretched out my muscles with exer
cises," Mac Donald said. "My legs don't
bother me too much anymore. I used to
get awful cramps."
"Sandy doesn't have natural ability,"
assistant coach Debbie Meyer said. "He
survives on sheer desire and guts."
Mac Donald pushes his body to the ut
most everytime he gets in the water. He
doesn't complain about the 14,000 yard
workouts. And head coach Jim Gaughran
said he hasn't missed a single practice in
two years.
Sophomore flier Jim Belardi, close
friend and roommate on road trips, said,
"Sandy said once after watching Bruner
(Olympic gold medalist in the 200 Fly), 'I
wonder what it's like to be him. He swims
so effortlessly.' Sandy realizes how hard
he's got to work and he does it."

"Sandy works a hell of a lot," said top
frosh butterflier Bob Hagberg. "I've never
seen anyone so totally dedicated to
swimming."
Mac Donald said he wishes he could
compete in the Olympics but stopped set
ting goals long ago.
"If you set a goal for yourself then you'll
try to do that," he said. "But what hap
pens if you haven't set your goal high
enough? I get disappointed if I set goals.
So now I just try my hardest and then 1
can't complain about the outcome."
Mac Donald devotes most of his waking
hours to swimming and studying. As a
result, his times have improved every
year, but he has almost no social life.
"Workout is the only time 1 get to see
anybody and talk to anyone. I don't usu
ally meet people in classes. I've been out
on one date in my life. I'm not used to
having any social life so I don't mind it."
Mac Donald is a favorite among the
team for his "after meet treats." He whips
up delicacies like rocky road eclairs.
"I enjoy making desserts. I don't eat
them — 1 give them away. My mom never
really made much, so if I wanted a cake I'd
bake it myself."
Mac Donald won a baking contest in a
local newspaper with a cookie recipe.
"We're all going to end up getting fat
from his baking," Meyer said.
Mac Donald is a master at transferring to

different colleges. He started his
freshman year at West Point and lasted
only one month.
"We had to eat at attention. We had 17
mi nutes to eat and had to eat a certain way
and in a certain order. Yourchin had to be
tucked in and your hand in your lap be
fore you chewed. If you did anything
wrong you had to recite something like
the number of days until graduation or
until a certain football game. If you made
a mistake, you had to start all over again,
and that easily took up the whole meal. I
remember one guy ended up with mal
nutrition."
Mac Donald attended Diablo Valley Co
llege and began Stanford his junior year.
He plans to pursue a career in environ
mental sciences and is majoring in civil
engineering.
Mac Donald is optimistic about his
chances for a trip to the NCAA champion
ships at Cleveland State in March. Last
Saturday in the Cal Invitational he had
the fastest time in the 100 tly of anyone on
the team, 52.7. He attributes this year's
success to the increase in yardage the
team is going in workouts.
"In order for you to swim in workouts
you have to put your mind into it. If you
really stop and think about what your
body is going through and how tired you
are, you'll want to quit. But you can't —
you've got to keep going."

the fastest time in the 100 tly of anyone on

success to the increase in yardage the

"In order for you to swim in workouts
you have to put your mind into it. If you

are, you'll want to quit. But you can't —
you've got to keep going."


Sandy Mac Donald
Sandy Mac Donald is not a superstar in
the world of swimming. Yet his hard
work and dedication to the sport, not
Olympic gold medals or world records,
have made him one of the most respected
members of the swim team.
Few things have come easily for Mac-
Donald, a senior butterflier from Alamo.
Born with short tendons in the back of
his legs and disintegrated hip joints, doc
tors suggested that he start swimming
when he was only nine months old.
"Later I went to a chiropractor who
stretched out my muscles with exer
cises," Mac Donald said. "My legs don't
bother me too much anymore. I used to
get awful cramps."
"Sandy doesn't have natural ability,"
assistant coach Debbie Meyer said. "He
survives on sheer desire and guts."
Mac Donald pushes his body to the ut
most everytime he gets in the water. He
doesn't complain about the 14,000 yard
workouts. And head coach Jim Gaughran
said he hasn't missed a single practice in
two years.
Sophomore flier Jim Belardi, close
friend and roommate on road trips, said,
"Sandy said once after watching Bruner
(Olympic gold medalist in the 200 Fly), 'I
wonder what it's like to be him. He swims
so effortlessly.' Sandy realizes how hard
he's got to work and he does it."

"Sandy works a hell of a lot," said top
frosh butterflier Bob Hagberg. "I've never
seen anyone so totally dedicated to
swimming."
Mac Donald said he wishes he could
compete in the Olympics but stopped set
ting goals long ago.
"If you set a goal for yourself then you'll
try to do that," he said. "But what hap
pens if you haven't set your goal high
enough? I get disappointed if I set goals.
So now I just try my hardest and then 1
can't complain about the outcome."
Mac Donald devotes most of his waking
hours to swimming and studying. As a
result, his times have improved every
year, but he has almost no social life.
"Workout is the only time 1 get to see
anybody and talk to anyone. I don't usu
ally meet people in classes. I've been out
on one date in my life. I'm not used to
having any social life so I don't mind it."
