# Senate reviews Carter choices
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The men picked
to fill the top national security and
legal posts in the Carter administration
underwent close questioning yester
day about their past views and the
policies they would pursue once in of
fice. Carter's choice for secretary of ag
riculture won quick committee ap
proval.
The Senate Agriculture Committee
voted 9 to 0 to approve the selection of
Rep. Bob Bergland to be secretary of
agriculture after brief, friendly ques
tioning of the Minnesota con
gressman.
Bergland was the first prospective
Carter administration official ap
proved by a Senate committee.
Formal Senate confirmation of the
Carter appointees will take place after
the new president takes office on Jan.
20.
Cyrus Vance, secretary of state
designate; Harold Brown, defense
secretary-designate, and Griffin Bell,
attorney general-designate, faced far
more detailed questioning than Berg
land.
Economic chairman
Charles Schultze, Carter's choice to
be chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers (CEA), appeared
before the Senate Banking Committee.
At the close of the hearing. Sen. Wil
liam Proxmire (D-Wis.), chairman of
the panel, told Schultze, "It's obvious
you'll have no problem at all getting
confirmed and it's obvious you'll be an
ouistanding chairman of the CEA."
Vance and Brown also are expected
to win approval with little or no oppos
ition although both were questioned
extensively at the hearings.
Opposition to Bell
Carter's choice of Bell, an Atlanta
lawyer and former federal judge to
head the Justice Department, drew op

position from the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored
People, Americans for Democratic Ac
tion and some hesitation from Senate
liberals concerned about Bell's record
on civil rights issues.
The Senate Judiciary Committee is
expected to spend several days hear
ing testimony from Bell and other wit
nesses. Bell is expected to be con
firmed if no new, damaging informa
tion is disclosed.
Most of the questioning at the open
ing committee session focused on the
nominee's civil rights record. Asked
about his support of the nomination,
rejected by the Senate, of G. Harold
Carswell to a seat on the Supreme
Court, Bell said he and Carswell had
been law school classmates and per
sonal friends.
'On my tombstone'
"That's just a part of my record," he
added. "I'll have to stand on it. When I
die, I'm sure they'll have on my
tombstone, 'He wrote a letter for Judge
Harold Carswell.' "
Vance got off to a good start with the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
by saying, "First, let me say, I will
come completely clean with you."
Members of the committee have com
plained frequently that Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger too often re
fused to keep Congress informed of
policy initiatives.
Vance also told the committee that
the Carter administration would with
hold military and economic aid from
nations that violate human rights.
Brown told the Armed Services
Committee that cutting $5 billion to $7
billion from the defense budget "is our
goal" but "it's not going to be easy."
Brown said he couldn't promise such
cuts could be made in the first defense
budget prepared by the new administ
ration.
