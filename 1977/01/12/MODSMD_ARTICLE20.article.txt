# Shot putter returns to Farm

Terry Albritton, former holder
of the world shot put record, has
enrolled at Stanford for the
winter quarter and plans to
compete for the Cardinals this
track season pending approval
from Pacific-8 faculty represen
tatives.
Albritton attended Stanford as
a freshman four years ago and set
a school record of 61 feet, 6V2
inches — a record which still
stands. The Newport Beach na
tive dropped out of school to de
vote more time to training and
later enrolled at the University of
Hawaii to capitalize on the ideal

training conditions of the semi
tropical climate.
As part of financial cutbacks,
Hawaii dropped its track prog
ram at the end of last season. Al
britton has one more year of col
legiate eligibility. An NCAA rule
allows an athlete to transfer,
without losing eligibility, when
a school drops his sport.
Last February Albritton put
the shut 71-BV2 at an all-comers
meet in Honolulu to break A 1
Feuerbach's world and Ameri
can mark of 71-7.
In July Alex Barishnikov of the
U.S.S.R. bettered Albritton's

standard with a toss of 72-2 3 U.
Barishnikov, the silver medal
winner in Montreal, and coun
tryman Yevgeniy Mironov, the
bronze medalist, will compete
with Albritton and Feuerbach
this weekend in the Sunkist in
door track meet in Los Angeles.
When Albritton started throw
ing with the other Stanford
weight men last week, he dis
played his world class abilities
by clearing the retaining board
in the training area by four feet.
Bulldozers made an appearance
at the stadium and extended the
shot put area 15 to 20 feet to ac
commodate Albritton.
