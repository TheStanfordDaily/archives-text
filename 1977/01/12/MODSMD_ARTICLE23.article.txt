Vietnam granted IMF loan
Washington — Communist Vietnam was granted
a $36 million loan yesterday by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), largely to compensate for
loss of export earnings resulting from war damage.
The loan to Vietnam by the 129-member agency
was the first since the Communist government was
admitted to membership over U.S. opposition late
last year.
The IMP' didn't say the loan was made because of
the war damage, but it was clear this was the case
from the wording of its announcement yesterday.
The agency said the loan was to temporarily
compensate the Vietnamese for a 10 per cent drop
in export earnings last year.
It was understood the IMF loan was approved
despite reservations of the United States. However,
no country was recorded as opposing the loan.
The United States provides about 20 per cent of
the financial support to the IMF, but would have
been unable to prevent the IMF loan to Vietnam on
its own, an IMF spokesman said.
Vietnam is one of only a handful of communist
members of the IMF, which was set up after World
War II at the urging of the United States to operate
the international monetary system.
Experts urge oil stockpiling
New York — A task force of energy experts re
commended yesterday the establishment of an
emergency national oil stockpile, financed by a tax
on all petroleum products, to reduce the effect of
another possible oil embargo.
The three- to six-month stockpile also would dis
courage oil-producing nations from restricting ex
ports again as they did in 1973-74, according to a
report by the 15-member task force of economists
and businessmen.
Based on the current price of oil and the cost of
storing and shipping it, a three-month stockpile
would cost more than $6 billion.
The group suggested the reserve could be fi
nanced by a small "security" excise tax on all re
fined petroleum products. There were no specifics,
such as how high the tax might be.
Meanwhile, Iran announced yesterday it will cut
back foreign aid and switch to a barter system in its
overseas trade because of a dramatic drop in oil
revenues since it raised prices 10.4 percent Jan. 1.
Iran is the second largest exporter of oil in the
world, after Saudi Arabia.
Iranian officials estimated that revenue was $460
million, compared with $672 million under the
lower price in the same January period last year.
Zoning laws ruled constitutional
Washington — Predominantly white com

munities have no constitutional obligation to
change zoning laws to provide low income housing
for blacks and other minorities, the Supreme Court
ruled yesterday.
The court reversed a lower court's decision that
the "ultimate effect" of zoning laws in Arlington
Heights, 111., is sufficient to prove that the commun
ity discriminated against minorities.
"Disproportionate impact is not irrelevant, but it
is not the sole touchstone of an invidious racial
discrimination," the high court said in an opinion
written by Justice Lewis Powell Jr. Four justices
joined Powell in the majority opinion.
The town's board of trustees in 1971 refused to
rezone a 15-acre lot of undeveloped land sur
rounded by single-family homes so that a federally
subsidized development of 190 townhouses for
low-income families could be built.
The Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., a
nonprofit organization set up to build such hous
ing, sued the board. It charged that the rezoning
denial resulted in unconstitutional racial discrimi
nation.
A federal trial court ruled in favor of the town,
finding that the board's refusal was not out of keep
ing with past zoning decisions.
The circuit court overturned that ruling, citing
the adverse effect on blacks and other minorities.
Suspected Olympics terrorist freed
Paris — Abu Daoud, a suspected plotter of the
1972 Munich Olympics massacre, flew to freedom
in Algeria yesterday after a hastily convened
French court rejected Israeli and West German de
mands that he be held for possible extradition.
An outraged Israeli government immediately re
called its ambassador to P'rance in protest. West
German government officials said they regretted
the decision, and the United States expressed dis
may.
In Tel Aviv, Foreign Minister Yigal Allon de
nounced the court decision as "nothing but a dis
graceful capitulation to the pressure of Arab states
and the threats of terrorist organizations."
Eleven Israeli athletes, four guerrillas and one
policeman died as a result of the terrorist attack on
the Israeli Olympic compound at Munich.
Carter plans unemployment cuts
Washington — The Carter administration plans a
two-phase attack to reduce unemployment to less
than five per cent in years ahead, Charles Schultze,
Carter's top economics adviser, said yesterday.
Public service jobs will be important in both ph
ases of the program ar}d probably will be continued
indefinitely, Schultze told the Senate Banking

Committee. "Our social goal ought to be zero for
socially significant, involuntary unemployment,"
he said.
Schultze also disclosed that the incoming ad
ministration is working on a housing program and
plans to design an anti-inflation program that may
include voluntary "guiding principles" for wages
and prices.
Schultze testified at his confirmation hearing to
be chairman of Carter's Council of Economic Advis
ers. While he was closely questioned about his past
economic policies as a member of the Johnson ad
ministration, there was no opposition to him.
Yoshimura called 'willing terrorist'
Oakland — The prosecutor at Wendy Yoshim
ura's trial bitterly disputed yesterday the defen
dant's contention that she fled arrest on weapons
possession charges because she feared the police
would kill her.
Jeff Horner, in his closing statement to the
eight-woman, four-man jury, told of her association
in the terrorist underground with Patricia Hearst
and Symbionese Liberation Army members Wil
liam and Emily Harris.
Horner concluded his closing statements by
reading portions of a diary and a letter found in a
San Francisco hideout shared by Yoshimura and
Hearst. He suggested the document indicated that
Yoshimura never feared for her life and willingly
traveled with terrorists after she fled to avoid pro
secution.
Interpol violates privacy?
Sacramento — A federal report says the U.S.
government doesn't use enough safeguards to fully
protect Americans' rights when it cooperates with
Interpol, the Sacramento Bee said yesterday.
The Bee said its article was based on a yet-to-be
published report by Congress' General Accounting
Office.
The report on the international police organiza
tion said, according to the Bee:
—The report concluded:
"There is no absolute control over the distribu
tion of information disseminated abroad through
Interpol or U.S. law enforcement agency chan
nels."
—Other governments' requests for information
in confidential files of U.S. law enforcement are
often not backed up adequately with statements
about why the information is sought.
Today's weather
Fair through Thursday with local morning fog.
Lows in mid 30s to mid 40s. Highs in the 50s. Light
winds.
