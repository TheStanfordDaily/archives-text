# ASSU report seeks more assistantships
## 
### Randy David Staff writer 
Changes need to be made in the al
locating of financial aid to graduate
students, said ASSU Vice President
Deric Jennings, on KZSU's Campus
Conference last night.
In his report, Graduate Financial
Report of the School of Humanities
and Sciences, Jennings focused on the
problems of graduate financial aid and
made recommendations to the uni
versity.
Up $100 from last year, the fellow
ship grants now stand at about $2400,
according to Jennings. "It is close to
impossible to live on that amount
without starving to death," he said,
though he said it is not the university's
responsibility to support graduate
students completely. However, it is the
university's policy to support almost
all Ph.D. students between their sec
ond and fourth years, Jennings said.
To better the financial aid situation
for graduates, Jennings suggests mov
ing the emphasis from fellowships (di
rect grants) to assistantships (teaching
jobs). Jennings advocates creating new

assistanlships such as faculty anil de
partment assistants in addition to
teaching assistants. Faculty assistants
would assist professors in research
while department assistants would do
work within the department.
Additional openings for teaching
assistants could also be made, he said.
According to a study done by the
Economics Department, the average
number of students per teaching assis
tant is 50 whereas the maximum
number of students ideally should be
40.
Jennings recommends that parents'
income not be used in deciding finan
cial aid for graduate students. "Parents
are usually willing to support their
child through undergraduate school,
but not through graduate," Jennings
said.
The Graduate School Council, in
advocating a need-based plan in 1975,
was in favor of using parental income
as a criterion for financial need.
Jennings emphasized that his report
only applies to the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
