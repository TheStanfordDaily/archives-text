# Ford proposes energy unit

### 
Washington (AP) — President
Gerald Ford yesterday proposed com
bining key federal agencies into a
Cabinet-level energy department to
solve one of the nation's most urgent
problems, achieving energy indepen
dence.
Ford sent Congress legislation simi
lar to a plan proposed by President
elect jimmy Carter, thus setting the
basis for a bipartisan approach to the
problem.
The president's plan would com
bine functions of the Federal Energy
Administration (FEA), Energy Re
search and Development Administra
tion (ERDA), the Federal Power Com
mission, Bureau of Mines, Rural Elec
trification Administration (REA) and
power marketing functions of the In
terior Department into the new de
partment.
Carter has said one of the first goals
of his new administration will be to
establish a single energy department.
He has mentioned joining FEA and
ERDA, and he has named former De
fense Secretary James Schlesinger to
manage energy programs with author
ity of a cabinet member.
Secretary of Commerce Elliot
Richardson told a White House news
conference yesterday the main differ
ence between the Ford and Carter
plans is the inclusion of the Bureau of
Mines and REA in the president's
proposal.
Richardson said under the Ford
plan, 22.860 employes would be trans
ferred from the various agencies into
the new department. It would have an
estimated initial budget of $7.2 bill
ion.
In his message to Congress, Ford
said the federal energy effort is now
fragmented among several agencies
and that a new energy department
would be instrumental in developing
the technology needed to make the Un
ited States independent of foreign oil.
Included would be development of
such alternate sources of energy as
solar power.

"Energy has played a progressively
more important part in our national
life as our economy and society have
evolved," the president said.
"However, it was not until the oil
embargo of 1973 and the energy crisis
it precipitated that we began to under
stand just how energy dependent we
are," he said.
"The sudden curtailment in oil im
ports also demonstrated vividly that
our national energy supply and de
mand are part of a world market and

that energy has become a major force
in wotld affairs."
Ford said the events of recent years
have made it apparent that a national
energy policy is needed.
His bill is the outcome of an eight
month study by the Energy Resources
Council headed by Richardson.
Asked why Ford is submitting the
bill in the final days of his presidency,
Richardson said a law passed by Con
gress required that a reorganization
plan be submitted at this time.

elect jimmy Carter, thus setting the
basis for a bipartisan approach to the
problem.
The president's plan would com
bine functions of the Federal Energy
Administration (FEA), Energy Re
search and Development Administra
tion (ERDA), the Federal Power Com
mission, Bureau of Mines, Rural Elec
trification Administration (REA) and
power marketing functions of the In
terior Department into the new de
partment.
Carter has said one of the first goals
of his new administration will be to
establish a single energy department.
He has mentioned joining FEA and
ERDA, and he has named former De
fense Secretary James Schlesinger to
manage energy programs with author
ity of a cabinet member.
Secretary of Commerce Elliot
Richardson told a White House news
conference yesterday the main differ
ence between the Ford and Carter
plans is the inclusion of the Bureau of
Mines and REA in the president's
proposal.
Richardson said under the Ford
plan, 22.860 employes would be trans
ferred from the various agencies into
the new department. It would have an
estimated initial budget of $7.2 bill
ion.
In his message to Congress, Ford
said the federal energy effort is now
fragmented among several agencies
and that a new energy department
would be instrumental in developing
the technology needed to make the Un
ited States independent of foreign oil.
Included would be development of
such alternate sources of energy as
solar power.

"Energy has played a progressively
more important part in our national
life as our economy and society have
evolved," the president said.
"However, it was not until the oil
embargo of 1973 and the energy crisis
it precipitated that we began to under
stand just how energy dependent we
are," he said.
"The sudden curtailment in oil im
ports also demonstrated vividly that
our national energy supply and de
mand are part of a world market and

that energy has become a major force
in wotld affairs."
Ford said the events of recent years
have made it apparent that a national
energy policy is needed.
His bill is the outcome of an eight
month study by the Energy Resources
Council headed by Richardson.
Asked why Ford is submitting the
bill in the final days of his presidency,
Richardson said a law passed by Con
gress required that a reorganization
plan be submitted at this time.
