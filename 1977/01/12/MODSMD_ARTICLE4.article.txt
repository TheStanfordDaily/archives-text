## NASA to recruit women 
### Will Nixon 
The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) has contacted
Margaret Collins, director of the
Center for Research on Women here, in
its effort to recruit women to become
astronauts in its space shuttle prog
ram. Collins has not recommended
any specific person, but she has for
warded the request to other people and
organizations.
"We are using a sex blind selection
process," said a public information of
ficer at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space
Center in Houston, Texas. NASA is
conducting a year-long search ending
June 30, 1977 for applicants to its as
tronaut training program. To date they
have received more than 1000 applica
tions. Roughly 10 per cent of these
have been from women.
A spokesman for Ames Research
Center in Mountain View said that an
experiment conducted there in Sep
tember 1973 indicated that women
could serve on the space shuttle
flights.
He said that 12 nurses ages 21-35
underwent two weeks of tests with a
bedrest facility which simulates space
flight. These nurses suffered from
physiological deterioration but not
any more than men would under simi
lar tests. These tests indicate that
women of similar physical condition
would be able to go along on a shuttle
flight as scientists or passengers, said
the spokesman.
Stanford scientists involved
Donald Harrison and Richard Papp,
professors of cardiology at the Medical
Center, worked as collaborators on this
experiment. Ames knew of no other
similar tests elsewhere.
NASA has never had a woman as an
astronaut. The Russians had one

female cosmonaut, Valentina Teresh
kova. She flew a mission, Vostok Six,
on June 16,1963. No women havegone
into space since.
The space shuttle flights for which
NASA is stepping up its recruitment of
women will carry a crew of three
NASA trained people: a commander, a
pilot and a mission specialist. NASA
will choose at least 15 people for pilot
training and at least 15 for the mission
specialist position.
Three different jobs
Pilots will fly the shuttle and be re
sponsible for its maintenance. Mission
specialists will coordinate the com
mand of the shuttle with the particular
project of each flight. The shuttle will
be used to perform missions ranging
from the upkeep of satellites to the per
forming of experiments in many fields
of science.

According to Fred Crawford, elec
trical engineering professor here, who
NASA consulted about the space shut
tle program, experiments to be done on
shuttle flights are still in the planning
stages. One to four people will be on
each flight to operate these projects.
These people will need only limited
training, probably a few months, said
Crawford.
Crawford forecasts the first shuttle
flights will be in 1979 or 1980. Suc
cessful applicants for the astronaut
positions will begin training in July
1978, according to NASA. They will
train for two years after which pilots
and mission specialists will be chosen
for the different flights.
However, the federal government
has not made any final commitment or
budgetary allocations for future space
programs.

The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) has contacted
Margaret Collins, director of the
Center for Research on Women here, in
its effort to recruit women to become
astronauts in its space shuttle prog
ram. Collins has not recommended
any specific person, but she has for
warded the request to other people and
organizations.
"We are using a sex blind selection
process," said a public information of
ficer at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space
Center in Houston, Texas. NASA is
conducting a year-long search ending
June 30, 1977 for applicants to its as
tronaut training program. To date they
have received more than 1000 applica
tions. Roughly 10 per cent of these
have been from women.
A spokesman for Ames Research
Center in Mountain View said that an
experiment conducted there in Sep
tember 1973 indicated that women
could serve on the space shuttle
flights.
He said that 12 nurses ages 21-35
underwent two weeks of tests with a
bedrest facility which simulates space
flight. These nurses suffered from
physiological deterioration but not
any more than men would under simi
lar tests. These tests indicate that
women of similar physical condition
would be able to go along on a shuttle
flight as scientists or passengers, said
the spokesman.
Stanford scientists involved
Donald Harrison and Richard Papp,
professors of cardiology at the Medical
Center, worked as collaborators on this
experiment. Ames knew of no other
similar tests elsewhere.
NASA has never had a woman as an
astronaut. The Russians had one

female cosmonaut, Valentina Teresh
kova. She flew a mission, Vostok Six,
on June 16,1963. No women havegone
into space since.
The space shuttle flights for which
NASA is stepping up its recruitment of
women will carry a crew of three
NASA trained people: a commander, a
pilot and a mission specialist. NASA
will choose at least 15 people for pilot
training and at least 15 for the mission
specialist position.
Three different jobs
Pilots will fly the shuttle and be re
sponsible for its maintenance. Mission
specialists will coordinate the com
mand of the shuttle with the particular
project of each flight. The shuttle will
be used to perform missions ranging
from the upkeep of satellites to the per
forming of experiments in many fields
of science.

According to Fred Crawford, elec
trical engineering professor here, who
NASA consulted about the space shut
tle program, experiments to be done on
shuttle flights are still in the planning
stages. One to four people will be on
each flight to operate these projects.
These people will need only limited
training, probably a few months, said
Crawford.
Crawford forecasts the first shuttle
flights will be in 1979 or 1980. Suc
cessful applicants for the astronaut
positions will begin training in July
1978, according to NASA. They will
train for two years after which pilots
and mission specialists will be chosen
for the different flights.
However, the federal government
has not made any final commitment or
budgetary allocations for future space
programs.


Where'd they go?
