# Student loan defaults hit $46,000 in 1975
## 
### Beth Stern 
Stanford lost $46,000 to defaulted
student loans in 1975, and the loss in
1976 could be twice as much, accord
ing to Joseph Jedd, manager of student
accounting.
"At present, a person can acquire an
education by borrowing $10,000, and
for a fee of $300, clear himself of all
debt," according to Jedd.
Bankruptcy declarations, involving
students here and at other universities,
have increased greatly over the past
few years.
In addition to students defaulting on
their loans, colleges across the country
are having problems with delinquent
repayment of loans.
Jedd said that Stanford presently
faces an 11 per cent deliquency rate:
for every $100 loaned, only $89 is col
lected on time. Some delinquent loans
are eventually repaid, said Jedd, since
the university continues collection ef
forts for 20 years, but much of the
money is written off as lost.
Taxpayers pay
Most of that written-off money is
paid for by the taxpayers, said Jedd.
Government loans, which account for
60 per cent of all Stanford loan funds,
are 90 per cent financed by the gov
ernment, with only 10 percent coming
from the university's own resources.
Therefore, the taxpayer bears the brunt
of bankruptcies through increased
taxes.
Jedd attributed the increase in de
linquencies and bankruptcies to the
changing morals of society, claiming
there is no longer any stigma attached
to bankruptcy.
Originally, Jedd said, the bank
ruptcy laws were designed to protect
the person who went into busi ness and
failed. "It gave the tradesman, the
businessman who tried really hard but
did not succeed, a fresh start. It let him
out of a situation he couldn't cope
with."
Last desperate move
He added that 30 to 40 years ago,
people were embarrassed to associate
with those who were bankrupt, let
alone be bankrupt themselves. Man

kruptcy was usually undertaken as a
last desperate move.
Today, according to Jedd, people
simply want to clear their slate of obli
gations. Jedd said he felt that colleges,
instead of dealing with students who
are truly unable to pay, are dealing
with students who are simply unwil
ling to pay.
"We try to prevent it." said ledd.
"We write them letters, we plead with
them. When everything else fails, we
turn to an outside collection agency."
Stronger collection
Intensifying collections efforts was a
main discussion topic at the November
meeting of the Consortium of Financ
ing Higher Education, a group of uni
versities including Stanford. As a re
sult of this meeting, recommendations
for strengthening bankruptcy collec
tions at Stanford have been sent to
President Richard Lyman for approval.
These include placing holds on re
gistration materials and academic re
cords until the obligation is cleared.
Also, a student who has had a bad cre
dit record (for example, one who re
peatedly pays tuition after the defer
ment deadline) would find it much
harder, if not impossible, to obtain a
loan.
A preventative measure is also now
before the U.S. House. The bill, which
has been approved by the Senate,
would forbid a student from declaring
bankruptcy for at least five years from
the completion of his education
The bill is facing formidable opposi
tion. Opponents say that educational
institutions should not be given
privileged loan status. Proponents
argue that universities need protection
because the borrowers can offer no col
lateral. Jedd commented that in ban
kruptcy cases. usually certain property
of the person may be taken as partial
payment. In the case of a student, he
added, "they would have to amputate
the brain — the student has nothing
thev can take."

Therefore, the taxpayer bears the brunt
of bankruptcies through increased
taxes.
Jedd attributed the increase in de
linquencies and bankruptcies to the
changing morals of society, claiming
there is no longer any stigma attached
to bankruptcy.
Originally, Jedd said, the bank
ruptcy laws were designed to protect
the person who went into busi ness and
failed. "It gave the tradesman, the
businessman who tried really hard but
did not succeed, a fresh start. It let him
out of a situation he couldn't cope
with."
Last desperate move
He added that 30 to 40 years ago,
people were embarrassed to associate
with those who were bankrupt, let
alone be bankrupt themselves. Man

kruptcy was usually undertaken as a
last desperate move.
Today, according to Jedd, people
simply want to clear their slate of obli
gations. Jedd said he felt that colleges,
instead of dealing with students who
are truly unable to pay, are dealing
with students who are simply unwil
ling to pay.
"We try to prevent it." said ledd.
"We write them letters, we plead with
them. When everything else fails, we
turn to an outside collection agency."
Stronger collection
Intensifying collections efforts was a
main discussion topic at the November
meeting of the Consortium of Financ
ing Higher Education, a group of uni
versities including Stanford. As a re
sult of this meeting, recommendations
for strengthening bankruptcy collec
tions at Stanford have been sent to
President Richard Lyman for approval.
These include placing holds on re
gistration materials and academic re
cords until the obligation is cleared.
Also, a student who has had a bad cre
dit record (for example, one who re
peatedly pays tuition after the defer
ment deadline) would find it much
harder, if not impossible, to obtain a
loan.
A preventative measure is also now
before the U.S. House. The bill, which
has been approved by the Senate,
would forbid a student from declaring
bankruptcy for at least five years from
the completion of his education
The bill is facing formidable opposi
tion. Opponents say that educational
institutions should not be given
privileged loan status. Proponents
argue that universities need protection
because the borrowers can offer no col
lateral. Jedd commented that in ban
kruptcy cases. usually certain property
of the person may be taken as partial
payment. In the case of a student, he
added, "they would have to amputate
the brain — the student has nothing
thev can take."
Stanford lost $46,000 to defaulted
student loans in 1975, and the loss in
1976 could be twice as much, accord
ing to Joseph Jedd, manager of student
accounting.
"At present, a person can acquire an
education by borrowing $10,000, and
for a fee of $300, clear himself of all
debt," according to Jedd.
Bankruptcy declarations, involving
students here and at other universities,
have increased greatly over the past
few years.
In addition to students defaulting on
their loans, colleges across the country
are having problems with delinquent
repayment of loans.
Jedd said that Stanford presently
faces an 11 per cent deliquency rate:
for every $100 loaned, only $89 is col
lected on time. Some delinquent loans
are eventually repaid, said Jedd, since
the university continues collection ef
forts for 20 years, but much of the
money is written off as lost.
Taxpayers pay
Most of that written-off money is
paid for by the taxpayers, said Jedd.
Government loans, which account for
60 per cent of all Stanford loan funds,
are 90 per cent financed by the gov
ernment, with only 10 percent coming
from the university's own resources.
