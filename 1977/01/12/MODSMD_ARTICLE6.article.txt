## 50 cent Flicks 
### 
Congratulations to Chris Mathe, ASSU financial manager and
Steve, Sunday Flicks manager, for reinstating the 50 cent flicks
on Sunday nights.
However, we do question the logic of offering a choice bet
ween a season pass, which gives a student 11 movies for $5.50
and 11 weekly tickets at 50 cents each. Our staff calculus whiz
reports $5.50 and 11 times 50 cents are equal.
We also wonder about the wisdom of one movie selection. Are
students mature enough to view the provocative Disney version
of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?"
All in all, though, one can't go too far wrong for 50 cents.
Thank you, ASSU.
