# How to improve TV

A Jan. 10 Daily column by Shannon
Blando complaining about TV net
work programming leaves the reader
depressed, confused and without al
ternatives for action.
How is it journalists feel all they
have to do is point out a problem when
we so need to discuss common solu
tions?
Cigarette manufacturers, liquor dis
tributors, psychiatrists and Jimmy Car
ter may need unfocused anxiety but I
have enough, thank you.
Blando described an episode of
Police Story which offended her. What
can we do about episodes like that?
First, we must get our indictments
clear. Blando offered the show as a
case in point of how television can be
held responsible for increasing vio
lence, sexual crime and decreasing re
gard for human life.
No sexual crimes
Yet in the episode she cites (as she
describes it; I didn't see it) there are no
violent acts, no instance of disregard
for human life and no sexual crimes
except prostitution.
Many of the characterizations in the
episodesound insulting to women and
the "heroes" of the piece sound awful.
But can we regulate the content of
these shows? If so, how?
The episode of Police Story in ques
tion would have "passed" a simple
count of violent episodes, a usual
standard by which TV violence has
been discussed.
Do we forbid sympathetic portrayals
of marital infidelity? Do we discourage
stories about police officers that do not
show them as exemplars of law and
order? Must virtue always be rewarded
and vice punished?
'Don't watch it'
On the other hand, can we simply
say, "If you don't like it, don't watch
it?" Part of the problem is that we don't
have audiences willing to pay enough
to support much good art.
But much of the reason for that audi
ence's nonexistence is differences
among media, regardless of content.
Television is convenient. Access to it
is limited.
TV is unlike popular music, where if
you don't like sexism in rock and roll
or blues or neurotic values in country
music you can stil 1 fi nd (somewhere) a
Holly Near record. With TV it's the
lowest common denominator, public
TV elitism, or almost nothing. We
should demand more diversity, more
opportunities for audiences to develop
loyalties.
Changing the structure of the broad
casting industry might provide a solu
tion. Several proposals have been
made. Asst. Economics Prof. Bruce
Owen argues for paid access to the
channels of distribution and deregula
tion of the media.
Free time
Some owners of television chains
see progress in forcing networks to di
vest their owned-and-operated sta
tions. Many media activists are fight
ing for the establishment of periods of
free television time mandated for pub
lic access.
Change in our communications
structure is coming. This session, the
House Communications Subcommit
tee is beginning a total review of the

Communications Act of 1934, the basis
for all broadcasting regulation. To the
extent that alternatives are proposed
and constituencies organized, real im
provements could result.
But first, some of us have to do some
thing. We have to decide what kind of
communication system we want. To
do this we have to develop public con
versation about the question that goes
beyond vague complaints.
This will require leadership and
cooperation. If our current information
system has robbed us of anything, it is
our ability to be informed decision
makers.
So we can do at least two things:
Don't mourn about television, or
ganize. And, right now, start caring as
much about your own information diet
as you do about your food. The good
stuff costs more, but it's available. Do
it, and in doing it, recreate yourself.

stories about police officers that do not
show them as exemplars of law and
order? Must virtue always be rewarded
and vice punished?
'Don't watch it'
On the other hand, can we simply
say, "If you don't like it, don't watch
it?" Part of the problem is that we don't
have audiences willing to pay enough
to support much good art.
But much of the reason for that audi
ence's nonexistence is differences
among media, regardless of content.
Television is convenient. Access to it
is limited.
TV is unlike popular music, where if
you don't like sexism in rock and roll
or blues or neurotic values in country
music you can stil 1 fi nd (somewhere) a
Holly Near record. With TV it's the
lowest common denominator, public
TV elitism, or almost nothing. We
should demand more diversity, more
opportunities for audiences to develop
loyalties.
Changing the structure of the broad
casting industry might provide a solu
tion. Several proposals have been
made. Asst. Economics Prof. Bruce
Owen argues for paid access to the
channels of distribution and deregula
tion of the media.
Free time
Some owners of television chains
see progress in forcing networks to di
vest their owned-and-operated sta
tions. Many media activists are fight
ing for the establishment of periods of
free television time mandated for pub
lic access.
Change in our communications
structure is coming. This session, the
House Communications Subcommit
tee is beginning a total review of the

Communications Act of 1934, the basis
for all broadcasting regulation. To the
extent that alternatives are proposed
and constituencies organized, real im
provements could result.
But first, some of us have to do some
thing. We have to decide what kind of
communication system we want. To
do this we have to develop public con
versation about the question that goes
beyond vague complaints.
This will require leadership and
cooperation. If our current information
system has robbed us of anything, it is
our ability to be informed decision
makers.
So we can do at least two things:
Don't mourn about television, or
ganize. And, right now, start caring as
much about your own information diet
as you do about your food. The good
stuff costs more, but it's available. Do
it, and in doing it, recreate yourself.

A Jan. 10 Daily column by Shannon
Blando complaining about TV net
work programming leaves the reader
depressed, confused and without al
ternatives for action.
How is it journalists feel all they
have to do is point out a problem when
we so need to discuss common solu
tions?
Cigarette manufacturers, liquor dis
tributors, psychiatrists and Jimmy Car
ter may need unfocused anxiety but I
have enough, thank you.
Blando described an episode of
Police Story which offended her. What
can we do about episodes like that?
First, we must get our indictments
clear. Blando offered the show as a
case in point of how television can be
held responsible for increasing vio
lence, sexual crime and decreasing re
gard for human life.
No sexual crimes
Yet in the episode she cites (as she
describes it; I didn't see it) there are no
violent acts, no instance of disregard
for human life and no sexual crimes
except prostitution.
Many of the characterizations in the
episodesound insulting to women and
the "heroes" of the piece sound awful.
But can we regulate the content of
these shows? If so, how?
The episode of Police Story in ques
tion would have "passed" a simple
count of violent episodes, a usual
standard by which TV violence has
been discussed.
Do we forbid sympathetic portrayals
of marital infidelity? Do we discourage
stories about police officers that do not
show them as exemplars of law and
order? Must virtue always be rewarded
and vice punished?
