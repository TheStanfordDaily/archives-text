# Going home sparks fear of adulthood
## 
### 
The Northwest Orient jet swooped
down through the gray December sky.
The dots of light visible below were
strung like Christmas lights across the
dark expansive girth of the Twin
Cities. I was home at last.
I had finished my last final seven
hours ago, but school with all its mis
eries seemed far more distant than
that. Christmas vacation would be
wonderful: 17 days of sleeping late, no
school work and general good times
with my old friends.
As we taxied to the terminal, I
thought about all my friends. 1 had
written them and asked them to pick
me up at the airport. We would proba
bly go out and do something together
then. It would be just iiketheold days.
I rambled off th<? plane and twisted
through the accordion walkway to the
terminal. I searched the sea of faces to
find that adoring clique from home. I
didn't see them. I looked again and
saw my father in the back of the crowd.
He told me the friends had called to say
they wouldn't be at the airport.
A bit miffed
We grabbed my luggage and started
home. I was a bit miffed. My friends
had never made excuses before.
After a well-deserved noon sleep, I
started calling around. For sure some
thing would be happening tonight.
After a half hour of fruitless calls, I
finally got ahold of Steve.
"Steve, how's it been? Long time, no
see. What's happening tonight? I've
been calling people all morning, but
no one has been home."

"Yeah," said Steve, "I've been cal
ling, too, but everyone has other things
to do, like go out with their fiances."
"Fiances?" I choked, "Who's getting
married?"
Steve shifted the phone to his other
ear. "Gol, there's a whole slug of them.
Dave is getting hitched in June to some
girl from school. Frank and Bubbles
are getting married the next weekend,
as well as Mike and Sarah. Peggy got
engaged, too. I think she's planning an
August wedding. Then, there's Walter
and Carol, Irma and John, Ron and Ro-

bin, Muarry and Diane
"Wait, Muarry and Diane were mar
ried last summer."
"They're getting married again,"
said Steve, "but not to each other. They
were divorced six weeks ago. Oh, and
Brian and Marty have a kid on the
way."
"Marty's pregnant?" I shrilled.
"Yup. Due in May."
This was too much. All these people
were friends I had hung around with in
high school. We had gone to basketball
games and parties together. Now they
were doing "adult" things like getting
married and having babies. What is
this? They're not adults. I'm not an
adult. We're just dumb kids. I sud
denly felt very left out as the invidious
clutches of adulthood tightened them
selves around my young, bachelor
throat.
Old girlfriend
I made some excuse and hung up the
phone. I needed someone to talk to, so I

called my old girlfriend.
"Hello, Sue. This is your old lover
from Stanford."
"Oh, 1 haven't heard from you in so
long. How are you?"
"I'm fine," I said.
"Well, everyone is fine here. My
older brother is getting married next
summer. I'm still going to the univer
sity and hope to graduate next year. I
saw Karen and Lisa the other day and
both of them are still working in the
steno pool at General Mills."
"That's nice." Silence. I couldn't
think of anything more to say. Sue in
terrupted the stilted pause.
"I have to run. We'll have to get to
gether sometime. Call me in six
months and we'll do this again."
Social contacts
I clicked the receiver down. I had
been home 12 hours and had already
exhausted all my social contacts from
home. I was beginning to look forward
to winter quarter.
Later that night, I left the house and
drove to Sam's, a bar the gang and I had
hung around for the last few years. I
didn't expect anyone to be there and
there wasn't.
I sat down and started to recall all
the things my group had done together
in this place. Memory swam into
memory.
Just then, someone came through
the door. It was Steve. He sat down
next to me. "Where have you been? I
thought you wanted to do something
together tonight."
"I'm feeling down because 1 feel so
old. Everyone is getting married and
pregnant (in that order). I'm just not
ready to 'grow up' yet."
'Listen, man'
"Listen man, that's not the way to
look at it," said Steve. "A lot of those
people we hung around with in high
school were friends of convenience.
You can't sustain friendships like that.
But some of those friends liked you
because you are you.

"And about that marriage bit, people
always end up wanting to settle down
with one person. It gives them security
and intimacy. So don't knock the in
stitution of marriage. In fact, someday
you will probably enjoy it."
"You sound like you know a lot
about that stuff," I said. "Are you get
ting married too?"
"Don't worry, I'm not," he said.
"Why don't we go have a drink now?
"And if that's too 'adult' for you," he
added, "we'll just drink gin and kool
aid."
I need friends like him.

this? They're not adults. I'm not an
adult. We're just dumb kids. I sud
denly felt very left out as the invidious
clutches of adulthood tightened them
selves around my young, bachelor
throat.
Old girlfriend
I made some excuse and hung up the
phone. I needed someone to talk to, so I

called my old girlfriend.
"Hello, Sue. This is your old lover
from Stanford."
"Oh, 1 haven't heard from you in so
long. How are you?"
"I'm fine," I said.
"Well, everyone is fine here. My
older brother is getting married next
summer. I'm still going to the univer
sity and hope to graduate next year. I
saw Karen and Lisa the other day and
both of them are still working in the
steno pool at General Mills."
"That's nice." Silence. I couldn't
think of anything more to say. Sue in
terrupted the stilted pause.
"I have to run. We'll have to get to
gether sometime. Call me in six
months and we'll do this again."
Social contacts
I clicked the receiver down. I had
been home 12 hours and had already
exhausted all my social contacts from
home. I was beginning to look forward
to winter quarter.
Later that night, I left the house and
drove to Sam's, a bar the gang and I had
hung around for the last few years. I
didn't expect anyone to be there and
there wasn't.
I sat down and started to recall all
the things my group had done together
in this place. Memory swam into
memory.
Just then, someone came through
the door. It was Steve. He sat down
next to me. "Where have you been? I
thought you wanted to do something
together tonight."
"I'm feeling down because 1 feel so
old. Everyone is getting married and
pregnant (in that order). I'm just not
ready to 'grow up' yet."
'Listen, man'
"Listen man, that's not the way to
look at it," said Steve. "A lot of those
people we hung around with in high
school were friends of convenience.
You can't sustain friendships like that.
But some of those friends liked you
because you are you.

"And about that marriage bit, people
always end up wanting to settle down
with one person. It gives them security
and intimacy. So don't knock the in
stitution of marriage. In fact, someday
you will probably enjoy it."
"You sound like you know a lot
about that stuff," I said. "Are you get
ting married too?"
"Don't worry, I'm not," he said.
"Why don't we go have a drink now?
"And if that's too 'adult' for you," he
added, "we'll just drink gin and kool
aid."
I need friends like him.

The Northwest Orient jet swooped
down through the gray December sky.
The dots of light visible below were
strung like Christmas lights across the
dark expansive girth of the Twin
Cities. I was home at last.
I had finished my last final seven
hours ago, but school with all its mis
eries seemed far more distant than
that. Christmas vacation would be
wonderful: 17 days of sleeping late, no
school work and general good times
with my old friends.
As we taxied to the terminal, I
thought about all my friends. 1 had
written them and asked them to pick
me up at the airport. We would proba
bly go out and do something together
then. It would be just iiketheold days.
I rambled off th<? plane and twisted
through the accordion walkway to the
terminal. I searched the sea of faces to
find that adoring clique from home. I
didn't see them. I looked again and
saw my father in the back of the crowd.
He told me the friends had called to say
they wouldn't be at the airport.
A bit miffed
We grabbed my luggage and started
home. I was a bit miffed. My friends
had never made excuses before.
After a well-deserved noon sleep, I
started calling around. For sure some
thing would be happening tonight.
After a half hour of fruitless calls, I
finally got ahold of Steve.
"Steve, how's it been? Long time, no
see. What's happening tonight? I've
been calling people all morning, but
no one has been home."

"Yeah," said Steve, "I've been cal
ling, too, but everyone has other things
to do, like go out with their fiances."
"Fiances?" I choked, "Who's getting
married?"
Steve shifted the phone to his other
ear. "Gol, there's a whole slug of them.
Dave is getting hitched in June to some
girl from school. Frank and Bubbles
are getting married the next weekend,
as well as Mike and Sarah. Peggy got
engaged, too. I think she's planning an
August wedding. Then, there's Walter
and Carol, Irma and John, Ron and Ro-

bin, Muarry and Diane
"Wait, Muarry and Diane were mar
ried last summer."
"They're getting married again,"
said Steve, "but not to each other. They
were divorced six weeks ago. Oh, and
Brian and Marty have a kid on the
way."
"Marty's pregnant?" I shrilled.
"Yup. Due in May."
This was too much. All these people
were friends I had hung around with in
high school. We had gone to basketball
games and parties together. Now they
were doing "adult" things like getting
married and having babies. What is
this? They're not adults. I'm not an

"And if that's too 'adult' for you," he
added, "we'll just drink gin and kool
aid."
I need friends like him.

The Northwest Orient jet swooped
down through the gray December sky.
The dots of light visible below were
strung like Christmas lights across the
dark expansive girth of the Twin
Cities. I was home at last.
I had finished my last final seven
hours ago, but school with all its mis
eries seemed far more distant than
that. Christmas vacation would be
wonderful: 17 days of sleeping late, no
school work and general good times
with my old friends.
As we taxied to the terminal, I
thought about all my friends. 1 had
written them and asked them to pick
me up at the airport. We would proba
bly go out and do something together
then. It would be just iiketheold days.
I rambled off th<? plane and twisted
through the accordion walkway to the
terminal. I searched the sea of faces to
find that adoring clique from home. I
didn't see them. I looked again and
saw my father in the back of the crowd.
He told me the friends had called to say
they wouldn't be at the airport.
A bit miffed
We grabbed my luggage and started
home. I was a bit miffed. My friends
had never made excuses before.
After a well-deserved noon sleep, I
started calling around. For sure some
thing would be happening tonight.
After a half hour of fruitless calls, I
finally got ahold of Steve.
"Steve, how's it been? Long time, no
see. What's happening tonight? I've
been calling people all morning, but
no one has been home."

"Yeah," said Steve, "I've been cal
ling, too, but everyone has other things
to do, like go out with their fiances."
"Fiances?" I choked, "Who's getting
married?"
Steve shifted the phone to his other
ear. "Gol, there's a whole slug of them.
Dave is getting hitched in June to some
girl from school. Frank and Bubbles
are getting married the next weekend,
as well as Mike and Sarah. Peggy got
engaged, too. I think she's planning an
August wedding. Then, there's Walter
and Carol, Irma and John, Ron and Ro-

bin, Muarry and Diane
"Wait, Muarry and Diane were mar
ried last summer."
"They're getting married again,"
said Steve, "but not to each other. They
were divorced six weeks ago. Oh, and
Brian and Marty have a kid on the
way."
"Marty's pregnant?" I shrilled.
"Yup. Due in May."
This was too much. All these people
were friends I had hung around with in
high school. We had gone to basketball
games and parties together. Now they
were doing "adult" things like getting
married and having babies. What is
this? They're not adults. I'm not an
adult. We're just dumb kids. I sud
denly felt very left out as the invidious
clutches of adulthood tightened them
selves around my young, bachelor
throat.
Old girlfriend
I made some excuse and hung up the
phone. I needed someone to talk to, so I

called my old girlfriend.
"Hello, Sue. This is your old lover
from Stanford."
"Oh, 1 haven't heard from you in so
long. How are you?"
"I'm fine," I said.
"Well, everyone is fine here. My
older brother is getting married next
summer. I'm still going to the univer
sity and hope to graduate next year. I
saw Karen and Lisa the other day and
both of them are still working in the
steno pool at General Mills."
"That's nice." Silence. I couldn't
think of anything more to say. Sue in
terrupted the stilted pause.
"I have to run. We'll have to get to
gether sometime. Call me in six
months and we'll do this again."
Social contacts
I clicked the receiver down. I had
been home 12 hours and had already
exhausted all my social contacts from
home. I was beginning to look forward
to winter quarter.
Later that night, I left the house and
drove to Sam's, a bar the gang and I had
hung around for the last few years. I
didn't expect anyone to be there and
there wasn't.
I sat down and started to recall all
the things my group had done together
in this place. Memory swam into
memory.
Just then, someone came through
the door. It was Steve. He sat down
next to me. "Where have you been? I
thought you wanted to do something
together tonight."
"I'm feeling down because 1 feel so
old. Everyone is getting married and
pregnant (in that order). I'm just not
ready to 'grow up' yet."
'Listen, man'
"Listen man, that's not the way to
look at it," said Steve. "A lot of those
people we hung around with in high
school were friends of convenience.
You can't sustain friendships like that.
But some of those friends liked you
because you are you.

"And about that marriage bit, people
always end up wanting to settle down
with one person. It gives them security
and intimacy. So don't knock the in
stitution of marriage. In fact, someday
you will probably enjoy it."
"You sound like you know a lot
about that stuff," I said. "Are you get
ting married too?"
"Don't worry, I'm not," he said.
"Why don't we go have a drink now?
"And if that's too 'adult' for you," he
added, "we'll just drink gin and kool
aid."
