## ARC pickets Marine recruiters 
### David Georgette 
About seven members of the Al
liance for Radical Change (ARC) pic
keted the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC) yesterday at noon
to protest the presence of United States
Marine recruiters.
"Marines are the biggest bullies on
the earth," said Steve Hansch, one of
the ARC members present. "We think
of the Marines as blindly obeying the
goals of American imperialism."
Hansch said that ARC hoped to
"force them (the Marines) to leave just
out of disdain."
Ralph Keller, director of CPPC, said
of the picketers, "we respect the right
of people to demonstrate their convic
tions." -
Respecting rights
Keller added that the CPPC expected
the ARC to respect the rights of those
who wished to be interviewed by the
Marine representatives.
Despite the pickets, Keller said that
people that did sign up for interviews
did visit the Marine representatives.
The small turnout did not discour
age those who carried such signs as
"The Few, The Proud, The Killers."

"We expected a lot less than this," said
Hansch. He said the demonstration
had not been widely publicized.
ROTC
Hansch added that the ARC is op
posed to any re-introduction of ROTC
(Reserve Officer Training Corps) prog
ram on campus. The ROTC program
was discontinued here in June 1973
because of declining enrollment and
student protest.
"We're telling the students and
we're also directing it against the ad
ministration, we don't want ROTC
ever to come back here," he said.
Keller said any re-introduction of an
ROTC program would be "the kind of
decision made by the Academic Coun
cil."
The rally bore little resemblance to
the violent sit-ins and demonstrations
Stanford experienced during the '60s
and early '70s, Picketers joked with
passers-by and the handful of peaceful
students contrasted with more hostile
mass demonstrations of the past.
Remember the past
But as Hansch said, "We don't want
people to forget what happened in the
'605."

The picketing was the first public
action ARC has taken since a demonst
ration against the National Security
Agency last school year, according to
Hansch. He added that the ARC plans
to be seen next week, too, with a vigi
lance to protest against the B-l bomber
in conjunction with Jimmy Carter's in
auguration.
Hansch said that the ARC opposes
the B-l bomber because the United
States could use it as a "sabre-rattling"
weapon against other countries. For
instance, according to Hansch, the Un
ited States could send out B-l bombers
against Mexico as a threat.

students contrasted with more hostile
mass demonstrations of the past.
Remember the past
But as Hansch said, "We don't want
people to forget what happened in the
'605."

The picketing was the first public
action ARC has taken since a demonst
ration against the National Security
Agency last school year, according to
Hansch. He added that the ARC plans
to be seen next week, too, with a vigi
lance to protest against the B-l bomber
in conjunction with Jimmy Carter's in
auguration.
Hansch said that the ARC opposes
the B-l bomber because the United
States could use it as a "sabre-rattling"
weapon against other countries. For
instance, according to Hansch, the Un
ited States could send out B-l bombers
against Mexico as a threat.

Marine recruiters at the center. The pickets remained
much of the day, but never prevented anyone from
entering the CPPC.
About seven members of the Al
liance for Radical Change (ARC) pic
keted the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC) yesterday at noon
to protest the presence of United States
Marine recruiters.
"Marines are the biggest bullies on
the earth," said Steve Hansch, one of
the ARC members present. "We think
of the Marines as blindly obeying the
goals of American imperialism."
Hansch said that ARC hoped to
"force them (the Marines) to leave just
out of disdain."
Ralph Keller, director of CPPC, said
of the picketers, "we respect the right
of people to demonstrate their convic
tions." -
Respecting rights
Keller added that the CPPC expected
the ARC to respect the rights of those
who wished to be interviewed by the
Marine representatives.
Despite the pickets, Keller said that
people that did sign up for interviews
did visit the Marine representatives.
The small turnout did not discour
age those who carried such signs as
"The Few, The Proud, The Killers."

"We expected a lot less than this," said
Hansch. He said the demonstration
had not been widely publicized.
ROTC
Hansch added that the ARC is op
posed to any re-introduction of ROTC
(Reserve Officer Training Corps) prog
ram on campus. The ROTC program
was discontinued here in June 1973
because of declining enrollment and
student protest.
"We're telling the students and
we're also directing it against the ad
ministration, we don't want ROTC
ever to come back here," he said.
Keller said any re-introduction of an
ROTC program would be "the kind of
decision made by the Academic Coun
cil."
The rally bore little resemblance to
the violent sit-ins and demonstrations
Stanford experienced during the '60s
and early '70s, Picketers joked with
passers-by and the handful of peaceful
students contrasted with more hostile
mass demonstrations of the past.
