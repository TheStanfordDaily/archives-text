# Affirmative action can't reduce racism
## 
### 
I use the term "racism" to refer to a system of
racial stratification legitimized and largely repro
duced via institutional structures and via a domin
ant ideology which posits the inherent inferiority
of relatively subordinated racial groups.
Racism, then, must be understood from three
levels of analysis, the socioeconomic, the institu
tional and the ideological.
Though the world of antiquity was one of consid
erable racial contact, racism — but not necessarily
ethnocentrism — was absent from that world.
Racism is rooted historically in the twin proces
ses of the enslavement of African labor and the
expropriation of land from native Americans and in
the need to legitimize and reproduce these and
similar forms of exploitation. More generally, it is
rooted in the various phases of capitalist develop
ment.
Very much alive
A brief look at racial stratification within the U.S.
labor force is instructive. Though there has been
significant occupational mobility for a number of
individuals of certain non-white economic groups
(primarily, members of the petty bourgeoisie), the
gap between the total income of whites and the
total income of non-whites has increased steadily
for the past 20 years.
Even when non-whites attain the same levels of
skills and educational achievement as their white
counterparts, non-whites still end up in less pre
stigious and less financially rewarding jobs.
Certain other facts are less well-known — e.g.,
facts helping one understand why certain ethnic
groups (especially blacks, chicanos, Puerto Ricans
and native Americans) consistently remain, rela
tively, at the bottom of the U.S. occupational struc
ture. In a brilliant essay, Monopoly Capitalism and
Race Relations, economists Paul Baran and Paul
Sweezy discuss some relevant factors.
'Private interests'
First, "a formidable array of private interests be
nefit, in the most direct and immediate sense, from
the continued existence of a segregated sub
proletariat" and of a subordinated disproportion
ately ethnic unskilled and semiskilled proletariat.
These beneficiaries are employers, slum landlords,

small marginal businesses and many white work
ers.
Next, the development of monopoly capitalism
has caused a decline in the demand for unskilled
and semiskilled labor. Such workers — often
people of color — have essentially become obso
lete, due to technological trends toward increasing
mechanization.
Mechanisms in the world economy which result
in the reproduction of subordinate status for poor,

colored peoples throughout the world are, in cer
tain respects, analogous to those outlined in the
above paragraphs.
Uneven exchange
The mechanisms all result in the uneven exchange
of value, in the transfer of wealth from the relatively
impoverished to the relatively rich. (On this, see the
works of Samir Amin, Arghiri Emmanuel and Im
manuel Wallerstein.)
And again, at the level of the capitalist world
economy, because of these asymmetric economic re
lations and because of the form of labor organiza
tion under which they are realized, racism is a fact
of life.
We see, then, from all that has been stated above,
that racism is historically and functionally linked
to the capitalist social formation, both within the
United States and throughout most of the world.
Racism is "good business," not a pathological aber
ration.
An implication: if racism is to be eradicated, it
must be attacked above all (but not exclusively)
within the division of labor — that is to say, within
the forces and relations of production.

Given the facts illuminated in the above discus
sion, one finds the current white backlash against
affirmative action programs rather interesting.
Note the following points:
First, few poor persons derive direct benefits
from affirmative action programs.
Second, operating on the (conscious or uncon
scious) assumption that the ethnic bourgeoisie is
the decisive group in ethnic communities, token
affirmative action programs are frequently used to
secure their loyalty. When effective, this is a good
tactic for forestalling legitimate protest.
Third, affirmative action often results in a greater
dependence of minority organizations — e.g., the
National Association for the Advancement of Col
ored People and the Urban League — on the white
oligarchy.
Fourth, such programs often result in the co
optation of militant leadership, and in the neutrali
zation, at institutions of higher learning, of poten
tial leaders.
Fervent belief
Fifth, by observing the upward mobility of cer
tain non-white ethnics, the poor and oppressed
classes come to believe a little more fervently in the
myth that for them, too, the possibility of upward
mobility exists.
Sixth, though affirmative action programs are at
least directed at the root cause of racism
(economics) they do not, in the final analysis, even
knock a dent in the structure of inequality. They
serve to maintain the status quo in the face of pro
test demanding an end to racial inequality.
One is forced to admit that all this serves the class
interests of upper and middle class whites far more
than it serves the class interests of poor blacks,
chicanos, Puerto Ricans and native Americans.
Class interests do not always coincide with indi
vidual, personal interests.
With regard to affirmative action programs, one
wonders whether groups doing the most squealing
should be those doing the most rejoicing, and
whether those doing the most rejoicing should, in
fact, be those doing the most squealing.
