# Russia: 1917 and now
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Another revolution in the
Soviet Union is unlikely because
the people have "been used to
suffering for hundreds of years,"
according to Boris Stanfield, an
88-year-old survivor of the Rus
sian Revolution and Columbia
University professor for 26
years. "Suffering is not some
thing new there at all, so that
helps to control them."
Stanfield made his remarks
during an informal interview
here last month.
"In all fairness, the Soviet
government has done a job with
out precedent in history, com
bining terror, intimidation, with
a remarkable, absolutely un
paralleled system of condition
ing the human mind. That is
where they are unique."
According to Stanfield, much
of Soviet Russia today is directly
traceable to the influence of
Vladamir Lenin, the leader of
the Bolshevik Revolution in
1917. The professor first met
Lenin as a reporter for Izvestia,
the Soviet newspaper.
The last time he spoke to
Lenin was "on the eighth of
November, right after his vic
tory. I didn't really see him, I cal
led him up over the phone.
Lenin was at that time accessi
ble. 1 was absolutely convinced
that it was an irresponsible ad

venture that would collapse in
24 hours. 1 thought that it was
Utopian. It turned out that 1 was
Utopian and he was the realist.
"I asked him point blank:
'Comrade Lenin, do you really
believe you can succeed?' And
he said, 'I'm not sure; but we
won't give in.' That was the last
word 1 had from him over the
phone. After that, finished. I had
to go underground."
Stanfield said that Lenin's
success was due to the trust he
inspired in the masses of people
and to a particular tactical ploy
he occasionally employed:
Lenin, he said, exercised an
"absolutely supernatural influ
ence on his party. When the
party would not agree with him.
he used, three times as far as I
know, very successfully, his sec
ret weapon. What was it? A
threat to resign. His prestige was
so great — like a sheep with a
shepherd — that they would not
risk his resignation. So they sur
rendered."
Stanfield fled Russia in 1920,
following the collapse of the
White Army in the Crimea,
where he was editor-in-chief of a
newspaper called Crimen Mes
senger. "I left in November,
1920, on a British destroyer for
Constantinople. . . . Constan
tinople was the worst period in

my life. I suffered more in Con
stantinople than at any other
time, because I refused to enter
any deals.
"I was offered money if I
would be willing to collaborate. I
didn't do it. 1 was literally starv
ing to death. My body was co
vered from filth, because I had
no money to live on.
"I finally got out of Constan
tinople, got to Germany, learned
the language, and soon, my star
began to rise.
"I was engaged at a very fine
salary by Averell Harriman, the
famous American statesman. He
was, at that time, neither a
Democrat, nor a statesman. He
was a greedy capitalist who was
looking for profit."
Stanfield now feels that "there
is no chance of any revolution
against Bolsheviks in the Soviet
Union. Solzhenitsyn and all
those individual intellectuals
are great heroes and martyrs and
admirable men, but they do not
represent the Soviet people. The
Soviet people have given up."
Asked about what might be
done to reduce tensions between
the Soviet Union and the United
States, Stanfield replied that
there is really no hostility bet
ween the peoples; however.
American-Soviet relations re
main "soaked in fear, in dis
trust."

out precedent in history, com
bining terror, intimidation, with
a remarkable, absolutely un
paralleled system of condition
ing the human mind. That is
where they are unique."
According to Stanfield, much
of Soviet Russia today is directly
traceable to the influence of
Vladamir Lenin, the leader of
the Bolshevik Revolution in
1917. The professor first met
Lenin as a reporter for Izvestia,
the Soviet newspaper.
The last time he spoke to
Lenin was "on the eighth of
November, right after his vic
tory. I didn't really see him, I cal
led him up over the phone.
Lenin was at that time accessi
ble. 1 was absolutely convinced
that it was an irresponsible ad

venture that would collapse in
24 hours. 1 thought that it was
Utopian. It turned out that 1 was
Utopian and he was the realist.
"I asked him point blank:
'Comrade Lenin, do you really
believe you can succeed?' And
he said, 'I'm not sure; but we
won't give in.' That was the last
word 1 had from him over the
phone. After that, finished. I had
to go underground."
Stanfield said that Lenin's
success was due to the trust he
inspired in the masses of people
and to a particular tactical ploy
he occasionally employed:
Lenin, he said, exercised an
"absolutely supernatural influ
ence on his party. When the
party would not agree with him.
he used, three times as far as I
know, very successfully, his sec
ret weapon. What was it? A
threat to resign. His prestige was
so great — like a sheep with a
shepherd — that they would not
risk his resignation. So they sur
rendered."
Stanfield fled Russia in 1920,
following the collapse of the
White Army in the Crimea,
where he was editor-in-chief of a
newspaper called Crimen Mes
senger. "I left in November,
1920, on a British destroyer for
Constantinople. . . . Constan
tinople was the worst period in

my life. I suffered more in Con
stantinople than at any other
time, because I refused to enter
any deals.
"I was offered money if I
would be willing to collaborate. I
didn't do it. 1 was literally starv
ing to death. My body was co
vered from filth, because I had
no money to live on.
"I finally got out of Constan
tinople, got to Germany, learned
the language, and soon, my star
began to rise.
"I was engaged at a very fine
salary by Averell Harriman, the
famous American statesman. He
was, at that time, neither a
Democrat, nor a statesman. He
was a greedy capitalist who was
looking for profit."
Stanfield now feels that "there
is no chance of any revolution
against Bolsheviks in the Soviet
Union. Solzhenitsyn and all
those individual intellectuals
are great heroes and martyrs and
admirable men, but they do not
represent the Soviet people. The
Soviet people have given up."
Asked about what might be
done to reduce tensions between
the Soviet Union and the United
States, Stanfield replied that
there is really no hostility bet
ween the peoples; however.
American-Soviet relations re
main "soaked in fear, in dis
trust."
Another revolution in the
Soviet Union is unlikely because
the people have "been used to
suffering for hundreds of years,"
according to Boris Stanfield, an
88-year-old survivor of the Rus
sian Revolution and Columbia
University professor for 26
years. "Suffering is not some
thing new there at all, so that
helps to control them."
Stanfield made his remarks
during an informal interview
here last month.
"In all fairness, the Soviet
government has done a job with
out precedent in history, com
bining terror, intimidation, with
a remarkable, absolutely un
paralleled system of condition
ing the human mind. That is
