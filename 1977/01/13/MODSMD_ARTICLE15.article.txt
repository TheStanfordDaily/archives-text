## Balanchine, Bejart, Christensen choreograph Stravinsky provides background for S.F. Ballet 
### Julianne Koehne 
The San Francisco Ballet
Company presented on Saturday
night a program of four works to
the music of Stravinsky; Agon,
L'Oiseau de Feu, Stravinsky Pas
de Deux, and The Ice Maiden.
Agon, as the San P'rancisco com
pany now does it, stands as an
empty monument to George
Balanchine, the most vital
choreographer of the twentieth
century. While Balanchine says
that he, as choreographer,
merely serves the composer, and
that the great composers will
stand on God's right hand,
Balanchine's critics say that he is
already there — in a league with
Mozart, Wagner, and of course,
Stravinsky.
Sperficially, Agon (1957) re
mains the brilliant Balanchine
neo-classic, the oft-copied (but

never equalled) abstract ballet
danced in black and white prac
tice clothes without scenery.
Choreographed only two weeks
after Square Dance, it's a crafted,
complex melange of seventeenth
century court dances, classical
ballet sequences, and ballet clas
sroom steps twisted, turned-in,
and deliberately inverted to
exploit the versatility and to
reinforce the durability of the
classical technique.
But, seeing the San Francisco
Ballet Company perform Agon, I
wish the New York City Ballet
Company (for whom it was
choreographed) was not con
fined solely to New York and
could perform more often for the
American and European com
panies to whom Balanchine so
generously gives his works.
When I saw the New York City

Ballet dance it, I felt people who
claim there is no more to Balan
chine than dry steps were horri
bly wrong. And no other com
pany should dare perform it
without the particular kinesthe
tic feelings that are as essential
as the bare, mechanical steps,
and these kinesthetics cannot be
learned verbally or intellectually
by someone who merely sets the
steps on the company.
No poignant tension
In the San Francisco version, I
miss the poignant tension of a
turned-in knee, the smug dignity
of the low, courtly steps, the
sense of dancers being totally
unself-conscious and glancing
at us occasionally with haughty
curiosity as if we were the enter
tainment. In Agon's pas de deux,
I miss the simultaneous mag
netism and repulsion, and the
subconscious push and pull for
power, existing in every sexual
relationship, that is abstracted
when two bodies twine and
grope around each other to
Stravinsky's jarring dissonance.
The San Francisco Company
dances his abstract ambiguities
as if it were asleep; it miscon
ceive? his dry choreography and
approaches it with either total
vacancy or superficial emoting
directed to the front rows of the
orchestra. I'm sure their dance
intelligence and musical sen
sitivity equal that of New York
City Ballet dancers, but they con
fuse an abstract extraction of
emotion with mechanical in
terpretation and fail to deliver
the powerful, intense, inner
concentration Agon demands.
Lack feeling
Granted, they lack some of the
feeling because their classical,
consonant training does not
work for Balanchine's neo
classical style of choreography
or for Stravinsky's unique disso

nance. In contrast to classical
ballet training, Balanchine's
neo-classical School of Ameri
can Ballet (SAB) teaches its dan
cers to bend their upper backs
slightly and to extend their arms
behind their backs; this gives a
grander, more operatic style
suitable to the dimensions of the
New York State Theatre. SAB
dancers' arms are longer and
lacier, rather than simply, clas
sically curved; San Francisco at
tempts Balanchine's hands (he
asks for "soft leaves"), but they
look like the floppy mittens my
mother used to attach to my coat
sleeves.
City Ballet's dancers also tilt
their hips to allow their legs to
swing higher and thus extend
their line, but their stomachs and
backs are strong enough to give a
light, thin texture to the high ex
tensions of their legs. San Fran
cisco's dancers generally need
stronger stomachs to achieve the
loose, free tone of arms and legs
demanded by Balanchine's
choreography; obviously, they
must achieve the style techni
cally before they can even begin
to attempt the artistic feeling.
And of course, the combination
of Balanchine and Stravinsky in
Agon will never be easy to do —
a member of New York City Bal
let compared it to running a
marathon while doing your cal
culus.
Freedom, vigor
Bejart's choreography for
L'Oiseau de Feu (1970) had pre
cisely what Agon lacked — a
freedom, vigor, and intensity —
but then, the music's dynamics
are much easier to respond to.
The firebird here symbolizes re
volution; he is the hero of a
group of partisans and eventu
ally he dies and a phoenix rises
from his ashes. It's an interesting
pretense for some gorgeous

dancing; it's nice to see men as
birds for a change and even nicer
to see them use open, flexible
chest, back, and legs as an intrin
sic part of the choreography.
Their arms are strong and yet
undulate in the wrists and el
bows like wings: they wear red
jumpsuits and I think Gary Pahl
and Thomas Rund are marvel
ously strong and lithe at the
same time.
The rest of the ballet has lots of
vigorous, rhythmic movement
for the partisans and the corps,
although I find their hand
kissing in a circle too socially
pretentious for a ballet that
should have kept the theme of
freedom to the birds. Bejart's
version is certainly more fun to
watch than Balanchine's murky
Chagall work, because there is so
much more dancing and the
men's solo parts are so exciting.
Lew Christensen was with one
of Balanchine's earliest com
panies and then moved to the
west coast in the late '40s to di
rect the San Francisco Ballet.
Now he's associate director with
Michael Smuin and also one of
its choreographers; Stravinsky
Pas de Deux and The Ice Maiden
are his most recent works. The
pas de deux was choreographed
especially for Susan Magno
(formerly of the Joffrey Ballet)
and Keith Martin (formerly of
the San Francisco and now on
loan from San Diego), and they
both dance so well that the
choreography's inadequacies
was hidden.
Magno is a joy, a fleet fairy
without Gelsey Kirkland's
neurotic hyperkineticisin, sweet
without being insipid. Her feet
are gently sensual as they caress
the floor and her arms are clear
and dynamic, yet still buoyant

and lyrical. Keith Martin is a
strong, gallant dancer with
sharp beats and panther-like
land'ngs, but the choreography
itself is rather empty, a lot of
running together while holding
hands — in the breezy, carefree
manner of Dances at a Gather
ing, but without its depth. This
dance merely whets my appetite;
it makes me want to get to know
the two dancers, particularly
Magno, better than the choreog
raphy allows.
More intelligent
In contrast, I think Christen
sen's Ice Maiden (to the score of
Le Baiser de la Fee) is much
more intelligent. In comparison,
to other versions, it's "dancier"
than Neumeier's over
intellectualized work, and it has
more kinds of dancing than
Balanchine's stripped-down,
plotless Baiser de la Fee.
Christiansen is true to his
promise to apply twentieth
century craft to a classical narra
tive ballet; the corps of ice
maidens has more steps of a
higher technique (and perform
them very well, I think), than the
traditional heel, toe corps steps.
Their arms in Part I are straighter
and more dynamic than classi
cally soft arms are, and therefore
more convincingly icy.
Christensen keeps the mime
scenes and the peasant dances,
but they are not over
emphasized and so the whole
ballet moves along without a leg
to satisfy today's audience.
Magno as the Bride and Beth
Erickson as the Ice Maiden are
wonderful principals, but
Thomas Rund, as the Groom,
lacks the necessary dynamics to
carry a lead role, if the tempo is
slow, in his white costume,
especially in Part 111, he looks
like a piece of bland vanilla di
vinity, badly in need of paprika.

and Keith Martin (formerly of
the San Francisco and now on
loan from San Diego), and they
both dance so well that the
choreography's inadequacies
was hidden.
Magno is a joy, a fleet fairy
without Gelsey Kirkland's
neurotic hyperkineticisin, sweet
without being insipid. Her feet
are gently sensual as they caress
the floor and her arms are clear
and dynamic, yet still buoyant

and lyrical. Keith Martin is a
strong, gallant dancer with
sharp beats and panther-like
land'ngs, but the choreography
itself is rather empty, a lot of
running together while holding
hands — in the breezy, carefree
manner of Dances at a Gather
ing, but without its depth. This
dance merely whets my appetite;
it makes me want to get to know
the two dancers, particularly
Magno, better than the choreog
raphy allows.
More intelligent
In contrast, I think Christen
sen's Ice Maiden (to the score of
Le Baiser de la Fee) is much
more intelligent. In comparison,
to other versions, it's "dancier"
than Neumeier's over
intellectualized work, and it has
more kinds of dancing than
Balanchine's stripped-down,
plotless Baiser de la Fee.
Christiansen is true to his
promise to apply twentieth
century craft to a classical narra
tive ballet; the corps of ice
maidens has more steps of a
higher technique (and perform
them very well, I think), than the
traditional heel, toe corps steps.
Their arms in Part I are straighter
and more dynamic than classi
cally soft arms are, and therefore
more convincingly icy.
Christensen keeps the mime
scenes and the peasant dances,
but they are not over
emphasized and so the whole
ballet moves along without a leg
to satisfy today's audience.
Magno as the Bride and Beth
Erickson as the Ice Maiden are
wonderful principals, but
Thomas Rund, as the Groom,
lacks the necessary dynamics to
carry a lead role, if the tempo is
slow, in his white costume,
especially in Part 111, he looks
like a piece of bland vanilla di
vinity, badly in need of paprika.
The San Francisco Ballet
Company presented on Saturday
night a program of four works to
the music of Stravinsky; Agon,
L'Oiseau de Feu, Stravinsky Pas
de Deux, and The Ice Maiden.
Agon, as the San P'rancisco com
pany now does it, stands as an
empty monument to George
Balanchine, the most vital
choreographer of the twentieth
century. While Balanchine says
that he, as choreographer,
merely serves the composer, and
that the great composers will
stand on God's right hand,
Balanchine's critics say that he is
already there — in a league with
Mozart, Wagner, and of course,
Stravinsky.
Sperficially, Agon (1957) re
mains the brilliant Balanchine
neo-classic, the oft-copied (but

never equalled) abstract ballet
danced in black and white prac
tice clothes without scenery.
Choreographed only two weeks
after Square Dance, it's a crafted,
complex melange of seventeenth
century court dances, classical
ballet sequences, and ballet clas
sroom steps twisted, turned-in,
and deliberately inverted to
exploit the versatility and to
reinforce the durability of the
classical technique.
But, seeing the San Francisco
Ballet Company perform Agon, I
wish the New York City Ballet
Company (for whom it was
choreographed) was not con
fined solely to New York and
could perform more often for the
American and European com
panies to whom Balanchine so
generously gives his works.
When I saw the New York City

Ballet dance it, I felt people who
claim there is no more to Balan
chine than dry steps were horri
bly wrong. And no other com
pany should dare perform it
without the particular kinesthe
tic feelings that are as essential
as the bare, mechanical steps,
and these kinesthetics cannot be
learned verbally or intellectually
by someone who merely sets the
steps on the company.
No poignant tension
In the San Francisco version, I
miss the poignant tension of a
turned-in knee, the smug dignity
of the low, courtly steps, the
sense of dancers being totally
unself-conscious and glancing
at us occasionally with haughty
curiosity as if we were the enter
tainment. In Agon's pas de deux,
I miss the simultaneous mag
netism and repulsion, and the
subconscious push and pull for
power, existing in every sexual
relationship, that is abstracted
when two bodies twine and
grope around each other to
Stravinsky's jarring dissonance.
The San Francisco Company
dances his abstract ambiguities
as if it were asleep; it miscon
ceive? his dry choreography and
approaches it with either total
vacancy or superficial emoting
directed to the front rows of the
orchestra. I'm sure their dance
intelligence and musical sen
sitivity equal that of New York
City Ballet dancers, but they con
fuse an abstract extraction of
emotion with mechanical in
terpretation and fail to deliver
the powerful, intense, inner
concentration Agon demands.
Lack feeling
Granted, they lack some of the
feeling because their classical,
consonant training does not
work for Balanchine's neo
classical style of choreography
or for Stravinsky's unique disso

nance. In contrast to classical
ballet training, Balanchine's
neo-classical School of Ameri
can Ballet (SAB) teaches its dan
cers to bend their upper backs
slightly and to extend their arms
behind their backs; this gives a
grander, more operatic style
suitable to the dimensions of the
New York State Theatre. SAB
dancers' arms are longer and
lacier, rather than simply, clas
sically curved; San Francisco at
tempts Balanchine's hands (he
asks for "soft leaves"), but they
look like the floppy mittens my
mother used to attach to my coat
sleeves.
City Ballet's dancers also tilt
their hips to allow their legs to
swing higher and thus extend
their line, but their stomachs and
backs are strong enough to give a
light, thin texture to the high ex
tensions of their legs. San Fran
cisco's dancers generally need
stronger stomachs to achieve the
loose, free tone of arms and legs
demanded by Balanchine's
choreography; obviously, they
must achieve the style techni
cally before they can even begin
to attempt the artistic feeling.
And of course, the combination
of Balanchine and Stravinsky in
Agon will never be easy to do —
a member of New York City Bal
let compared it to running a
marathon while doing your cal
culus.
Freedom, vigor
Bejart's choreography for
L'Oiseau de Feu (1970) had pre
cisely what Agon lacked — a
freedom, vigor, and intensity —
but then, the music's dynamics
are much easier to respond to.
The firebird here symbolizes re
volution; he is the hero of a
group of partisans and eventu
ally he dies and a phoenix rises
from his ashes. It's an interesting
pretense for some gorgeous

dancing; it's nice to see men as
birds for a change and even nicer
to see them use open, flexible
chest, back, and legs as an intrin
sic part of the choreography.
Their arms are strong and yet
undulate in the wrists and el
bows like wings: they wear red
jumpsuits and I think Gary Pahl
and Thomas Rund are marvel
ously strong and lithe at the
same time.
The rest of the ballet has lots of
vigorous, rhythmic movement
for the partisans and the corps,
although I find their hand
kissing in a circle too socially
pretentious for a ballet that
should have kept the theme of
freedom to the birds. Bejart's
version is certainly more fun to
watch than Balanchine's murky
Chagall work, because there is so
much more dancing and the
men's solo parts are so exciting.
Lew Christensen was with one
of Balanchine's earliest com
panies and then moved to the
west coast in the late '40s to di
rect the San Francisco Ballet.
Now he's associate director with
Michael Smuin and also one of
its choreographers; Stravinsky
Pas de Deux and The Ice Maiden
are his most recent works. The
pas de deux was choreographed
especially for Susan Magno
(formerly of the Joffrey Ballet)
and Keith Martin (formerly of
the San Francisco and now on
loan from San Diego), and they
both dance so well that the
choreography's inadequacies
was hidden.
Magno is a joy, a fleet fairy
without Gelsey Kirkland's
neurotic hyperkineticisin, sweet
without being insipid. Her feet
are gently sensual as they caress
the floor and her arms are clear

And of course, the combination
of Balanchine and Stravinsky in
Agon will never be easy to do —
a member of New York City Bal
let compared it to running a
marathon while doing your cal

Freedom, vigor
Bejart's choreography for
L'Oiseau de Feu (1970) had pre
cisely what Agon lacked — a
freedom, vigor, and intensity —
but then, the music's dynamics
are much easier to respond to.
The firebird here symbolizes re
volution; he is the hero of a
group of partisans and eventu
ally he dies and a phoenix rises
from his ashes. It's an interesting
pretense for some gorgeous

dancing; it's nice to see men as
birds for a change and even nicer
to see them use open, flexible
chest, back, and legs as an intrin
sic part of the choreography.
Their arms are strong and yet
undulate in the wrists and el
bows like wings: they wear red
jumpsuits and I think Gary Pahl
and Thomas Rund are marvel
ously strong and lithe at the
same time.
The rest of the ballet has lots of
vigorous, rhythmic movement
for the partisans and the corps,
although I find their hand
kissing in a circle too socially
pretentious for a ballet that
should have kept the theme of
freedom to the birds. Bejart's
version is certainly more fun to
watch than Balanchine's murky
Chagall work, because there is so
much more dancing and the
men's solo parts are so exciting.
Lew Christensen was with one
of Balanchine's earliest com
panies and then moved to the
west coast in the late '40s to di
rect the San Francisco Ballet.
Now he's associate director with
Michael Smuin and also one of
its choreographers; Stravinsky
Pas de Deux and The Ice Maiden
are his most recent works. The
pas de deux was choreographed
especially for Susan Magno
(formerly of the Joffrey Ballet)
and Keith Martin (formerly of
the San Francisco and now on
loan from San Diego), and they
both dance so well that the
choreography's inadequacies
was hidden.
Magno is a joy, a fleet fairy
without Gelsey Kirkland's
neurotic hyperkineticisin, sweet
without being insipid. Her feet
are gently sensual as they caress
the floor and her arms are clear
and dynamic, yet still buoyant

and lyrical. Keith Martin is a
strong, gallant dancer with
sharp beats and panther-like
land'ngs, but the choreography
itself is rather empty, a lot of
running together while holding
hands — in the breezy, carefree
manner of Dances at a Gather
ing, but without its depth. This
dance merely whets my appetite;
it makes me want to get to know
the two dancers, particularly
Magno, better than the choreog
raphy allows.
More intelligent
In contrast, I think Christen
sen's Ice Maiden (to the score of
Le Baiser de la Fee) is much
more intelligent. In comparison,
to other versions, it's "dancier"
than Neumeier's over
intellectualized work, and it has
more kinds of dancing than
Balanchine's stripped-down,
plotless Baiser de la Fee.
Christiansen is true to his
promise to apply twentieth
century craft to a classical narra
tive ballet; the corps of ice
maidens has more steps of a
higher technique (and perform
them very well, I think), than the
traditional heel, toe corps steps.
Their arms in Part I are straighter
and more dynamic than classi
cally soft arms are, and therefore
more convincingly icy.
Christensen keeps the mime
scenes and the peasant dances,
but they are not over
emphasized and so the whole
ballet moves along without a leg
to satisfy today's audience.
Magno as the Bride and Beth
Erickson as the Ice Maiden are
wonderful principals, but
Thomas Rund, as the Groom,
lacks the necessary dynamics to
carry a lead role, if the tempo is
slow, in his white costume,
especially in Part 111, he looks
like a piece of bland vanilla di
vinity, badly in need of paprika.
The San Francisco Ballet
Company presented on Saturday
night a program of four works to
the music of Stravinsky; Agon,
L'Oiseau de Feu, Stravinsky Pas
de Deux, and The Ice Maiden.
Agon, as the San P'rancisco com
pany now does it, stands as an
empty monument to George
Balanchine, the most vital
choreographer of the twentieth
century. While Balanchine says
that he, as choreographer,
merely serves the composer, and
that the great composers will
stand on God's right hand,
Balanchine's critics say that he is
already there — in a league with
Mozart, Wagner, and of course,
Stravinsky.
Sperficially, Agon (1957) re
mains the brilliant Balanchine
neo-classic, the oft-copied (but

never equalled) abstract ballet
danced in black and white prac
tice clothes without scenery.
Choreographed only two weeks
after Square Dance, it's a crafted,
complex melange of seventeenth
century court dances, classical
ballet sequences, and ballet clas
sroom steps twisted, turned-in,
and deliberately inverted to
exploit the versatility and to
reinforce the durability of the
classical technique.
But, seeing the San Francisco
Ballet Company perform Agon, I
wish the New York City Ballet
Company (for whom it was
choreographed) was not con
fined solely to New York and
could perform more often for the
American and European com
panies to whom Balanchine so
generously gives his works.
When I saw the New York City

Ballet dance it, I felt people who
claim there is no more to Balan
chine than dry steps were horri
bly wrong. And no other com
pany should dare perform it
without the particular kinesthe
tic feelings that are as essential
as the bare, mechanical steps,
and these kinesthetics cannot be
learned verbally or intellectually
by someone who merely sets the
steps on the company.
No poignant tension
In the San Francisco version, I
miss the poignant tension of a
turned-in knee, the smug dignity
of the low, courtly steps, the
sense of dancers being totally
unself-conscious and glancing
at us occasionally with haughty
curiosity as if we were the enter
tainment. In Agon's pas de deux,
I miss the simultaneous mag
netism and repulsion, and the
subconscious push and pull for
power, existing in every sexual
relationship, that is abstracted
when two bodies twine and
grope around each other to
Stravinsky's jarring dissonance.
The San Francisco Company
dances his abstract ambiguities
as if it were asleep; it miscon
ceive? his dry choreography and
approaches it with either total
vacancy or superficial emoting
directed to the front rows of the
orchestra. I'm sure their dance
intelligence and musical sen
sitivity equal that of New York
City Ballet dancers, but they con
fuse an abstract extraction of
emotion with mechanical in
terpretation and fail to deliver
the powerful, intense, inner
concentration Agon demands.
Lack feeling
Granted, they lack some of the
feeling because their classical,
consonant training does not
work for Balanchine's neo
classical style of choreography
or for Stravinsky's unique disso

nance. In contrast to classical
ballet training, Balanchine's
neo-classical School of Ameri
can Ballet (SAB) teaches its dan
cers to bend their upper backs
slightly and to extend their arms
behind their backs; this gives a
grander, more operatic style
suitable to the dimensions of the
New York State Theatre. SAB
dancers' arms are longer and
lacier, rather than simply, clas
sically curved; San Francisco at
tempts Balanchine's hands (he
asks for "soft leaves"), but they
look like the floppy mittens my
mother used to attach to my coat
sleeves.
City Ballet's dancers also tilt
their hips to allow their legs to
swing higher and thus extend
their line, but their stomachs and
backs are strong enough to give a
light, thin texture to the high ex
tensions of their legs. San Fran
cisco's dancers generally need
stronger stomachs to achieve the
loose, free tone of arms and legs
demanded by Balanchine's
choreography; obviously, they
must achieve the style techni
cally before they can even begin
to attempt the artistic feeling.
And of course, the combination
of Balanchine and Stravinsky in
Agon will never be easy to do —
a member of New York City Bal

curiosity as if we were the enter
tainment. In Agon's pas de deux,
I miss the simultaneous mag
netism and repulsion, and the
subconscious push and pull for
power, existing in every sexual
relationship, that is abstracted
when two bodies twine and
grope around each other to
Stravinsky's jarring dissonance.
The San Francisco Company
dances his abstract ambiguities
as if it were asleep; it miscon
ceive? his dry choreography and
approaches it with either total
vacancy or superficial emoting
directed to the front rows of the
orchestra. I'm sure their dance
intelligence and musical sen
sitivity equal that of New York
City Ballet dancers, but they con
fuse an abstract extraction of
emotion with mechanical in
terpretation and fail to deliver
the powerful, intense, inner
concentration Agon demands.
Lack feeling
Granted, they lack some of the
feeling because their classical,
consonant training does not
work for Balanchine's neo
classical style of choreography
or for Stravinsky's unique disso

nance. In contrast to classical
ballet training, Balanchine's
neo-classical School of Ameri
can Ballet (SAB) teaches its dan
cers to bend their upper backs
slightly and to extend their arms
behind their backs; this gives a
grander, more operatic style
suitable to the dimensions of the
New York State Theatre. SAB
dancers' arms are longer and
lacier, rather than simply, clas
sically curved; San Francisco at
tempts Balanchine's hands (he
asks for "soft leaves"), but they
look like the floppy mittens my
mother used to attach to my coat
sleeves.
City Ballet's dancers also tilt
their hips to allow their legs to
swing higher and thus extend
their line, but their stomachs and
backs are strong enough to give a
light, thin texture to the high ex
tensions of their legs. San Fran
cisco's dancers generally need
stronger stomachs to achieve the
loose, free tone of arms and legs
demanded by Balanchine's
choreography; obviously, they
must achieve the style techni
cally before they can even begin
to attempt the artistic feeling.
And of course, the combination
of Balanchine and Stravinsky in
Agon will never be easy to do —
a member of New York City Bal
let compared it to running a
marathon while doing your cal
culus.
Freedom, vigor
Bejart's choreography for
L'Oiseau de Feu (1970) had pre
cisely what Agon lacked — a
freedom, vigor, and intensity —
but then, the music's dynamics
are much easier to respond to.
The firebird here symbolizes re
volution; he is the hero of a
group of partisans and eventu
ally he dies and a phoenix rises
from his ashes. It's an interesting
pretense for some gorgeous

dancing; it's nice to see men as
birds for a change and even nicer
to see them use open, flexible
chest, back, and legs as an intrin
sic part of the choreography.
Their arms are strong and yet
undulate in the wrists and el
bows like wings: they wear red
jumpsuits and I think Gary Pahl
and Thomas Rund are marvel
ously strong and lithe at the
same time.
The rest of the ballet has lots of
vigorous, rhythmic movement
for the partisans and the corps,
although I find their hand
kissing in a circle too socially
pretentious for a ballet that
should have kept the theme of
freedom to the birds. Bejart's
version is certainly more fun to
watch than Balanchine's murky
Chagall work, because there is so
much more dancing and the
men's solo parts are so exciting.
Lew Christensen was with one
of Balanchine's earliest com
panies and then moved to the
west coast in the late '40s to di
rect the San Francisco Ballet.
Now he's associate director with
Michael Smuin and also one of
its choreographers; Stravinsky
Pas de Deux and The Ice Maiden
are his most recent works. The
pas de deux was choreographed
especially for Susan Magno
(formerly of the Joffrey Ballet)
and Keith Martin (formerly of
the San Francisco and now on
loan from San Diego), and they
both dance so well that the
choreography's inadequacies
was hidden.
Magno is a joy, a fleet fairy
without Gelsey Kirkland's
neurotic hyperkineticisin, sweet
without being insipid. Her feet
are gently sensual as they caress
the floor and her arms are clear
and dynamic, yet still buoyant

and lyrical. Keith Martin is a
strong, gallant dancer with
sharp beats and panther-like
land'ngs, but the choreography
itself is rather empty, a lot of
running together while holding
hands — in the breezy, carefree
manner of Dances at a Gather
ing, but without its depth. This
dance merely whets my appetite;
it makes me want to get to know
the two dancers, particularly
Magno, better than the choreog
raphy allows.
More intelligent
In contrast, I think Christen
sen's Ice Maiden (to the score of
Le Baiser de la Fee) is much
more intelligent. In comparison,
to other versions, it's "dancier"
than Neumeier's over
intellectualized work, and it has
more kinds of dancing than
Balanchine's stripped-down,
plotless Baiser de la Fee.
Christiansen is true to his
promise to apply twentieth
century craft to a classical narra
tive ballet; the corps of ice
maidens has more steps of a
higher technique (and perform
them very well, I think), than the
traditional heel, toe corps steps.
Their arms in Part I are straighter
and more dynamic than classi
cally soft arms are, and therefore
more convincingly icy.
Christensen keeps the mime
scenes and the peasant dances,
but they are not over
emphasized and so the whole
ballet moves along without a leg
to satisfy today's audience.
Magno as the Bride and Beth
Erickson as the Ice Maiden are
wonderful principals, but
Thomas Rund, as the Groom,
lacks the necessary dynamics to
carry a lead role, if the tempo is
slow, in his white costume,
especially in Part 111, he looks
like a piece of bland vanilla di
vinity, badly in need of paprika.
The San Francisco Ballet
Company presented on Saturday
night a program of four works to
the music of Stravinsky; Agon,
L'Oiseau de Feu, Stravinsky Pas
de Deux, and The Ice Maiden.
Agon, as the San P'rancisco com
pany now does it, stands as an
empty monument to George
Balanchine, the most vital
choreographer of the twentieth
century. While Balanchine says
that he, as choreographer,
merely serves the composer, and
that the great composers will
stand on God's right hand,
Balanchine's critics say that he is
already there — in a league with
Mozart, Wagner, and of course,
Stravinsky.
Sperficially, Agon (1957) re
mains the brilliant Balanchine
neo-classic, the oft-copied (but

never equalled) abstract ballet
danced in black and white prac
tice clothes without scenery.
Choreographed only two weeks
after Square Dance, it's a crafted,
complex melange of seventeenth
century court dances, classical
ballet sequences, and ballet clas
sroom steps twisted, turned-in,
and deliberately inverted to
exploit the versatility and to
reinforce the durability of the
classical technique.
But, seeing the San Francisco
Ballet Company perform Agon, I
wish the New York City Ballet
Company (for whom it was
choreographed) was not con
fined solely to New York and
could perform more often for the
American and European com
panies to whom Balanchine so
generously gives his works.
When I saw the New York City

Ballet dance it, I felt people who
claim there is no more to Balan
chine than dry steps were horri
bly wrong. And no other com
pany should dare perform it
without the particular kinesthe
tic feelings that are as essential
as the bare, mechanical steps,
and these kinesthetics cannot be
learned verbally or intellectually
by someone who merely sets the
steps on the company.
No poignant tension
In the San Francisco version, I
miss the poignant tension of a
turned-in knee, the smug dignity
of the low, courtly steps, the
sense of dancers being totally
unself-conscious and glancing
at us occasionally with haughty
curiosity as if we were the enter
tainment. In Agon's pas de deux,
I miss the simultaneous mag
netism and repulsion, and the
subconscious push and pull for
power, existing in every sexual
relationship, that is abstracted
when two bodies twine and
grope around each other to
Stravinsky's jarring dissonance.
The San Francisco Company
dances his abstract ambiguities
as if it were asleep; it miscon
ceive? his dry choreography and
approaches it with either total
vacancy or superficial emoting
directed to the front rows of the
orchestra. I'm sure their dance
intelligence and musical sen
sitivity equal that of New York
City Ballet dancers, but they con
fuse an abstract extraction of
emotion with mechanical in
terpretation and fail to deliver
the powerful, intense, inner
concentration Agon demands.

Granted, they lack some of the
feeling because their classical,
consonant training does not
work for Balanchine's neo

or for Stravinsky's unique disso
