# Scholarships on need turned down by NCAA
## 
### Chris Baker 
The delegates to the 71st annual Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) Convention, meeting in
Miami Beach, yesterday rejected Stan
ford President Richard Lyman's prop
osal to base athletic scholarships on
need.
The proposal which ended in a
119-119 tie vote last year, lost by a
146-102 count this year.
The opponents of the proposal, led
by Edmund Joyce, executive vice pres
ident of Notre Dame, argued that the
need proposal would lead to cheating.
Joyce said that Stanford, USC and
UCLA had violated recruiting regula
tions 20 years ago, when a "need" sys
tem was being used.
"They were caught red-handed and
then they screamed that the rules are
not feasible," said Joyce.
Bitterness
UCLA Athletic Director J.D. Morgan
was bitter. "1 am aghast at what hap
pened in this assemblage. I thought we
came together as adults for the good of
fair competition," said Morgan. "I re
sent Father Joyce's pointed remarks at
my university. 1 believe I have seen the
low of all time."
Joyce later apologized, saying that
his remarks were not directed at cur
rent personnel.
But the apology came after the
NCAA had defeated Lyman's need
proposal.
Other proposals
Several other need proposals, which
exempted football and basketball, also
went down to defeat in both Division I
(schools with major athletic programs)
and II (smaller schools).
Joyce made a highly emotional
speech against the need proposal last
year and he was credited with champ
ioning the efforts against the plan.
The delegates also rejected cost
cutting legislation which would have
cut the number of scholarships at any
one time for sports other than football
and basketball from 80 to 60. The mea
sure would only have applied to Divi
sion I.
Initially, delegates voted 107-102 to
reduce the number to 60, after reject
ing the University of Virginia's figure

of 70 scholarships.
However, after opponents to the re
duction pointed out that 60 scholar
ships was the same number allowed
Division I, the assembly reconsidered
and raised the number back to 80.
The convention also turned down a
proposal by the Pacific-8 to raise the
number of baseball scholarships from
13 to 16.

Several other need proposals, which
exempted football and basketball, also
went down to defeat in both Division I
(schools with major athletic programs)
and II (smaller schools).
Joyce made a highly emotional
speech against the need proposal last
year and he was credited with champ
ioning the efforts against the plan.
The delegates also rejected cost
cutting legislation which would have
cut the number of scholarships at any
one time for sports other than football
and basketball from 80 to 60. The mea
sure would only have applied to Divi
sion I.
Initially, delegates voted 107-102 to
reduce the number to 60, after reject
ing the University of Virginia's figure

of 70 scholarships.
However, after opponents to the re
duction pointed out that 60 scholar
ships was the same number allowed
Division I, the assembly reconsidered
and raised the number back to 80.
The convention also turned down a
proposal by the Pacific-8 to raise the
number of baseball scholarships from
13 to 16.
