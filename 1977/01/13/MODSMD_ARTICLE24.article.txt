Israelis want French envoy expelled
Tel Aviv — Israelis angered by France's release of
a suspected Palestinian terrorist massed outside the
French embassy yesterday, hurled eggs, de
nounced the French president and demanded that
France's ambassador be thrown out of Israel.
Israeli television said Foreign Minister Yigal
Allon was to meet his top advisers today to discuss
further steps in response to Tuesday's release of the
Palestinian, Abu Daoud, who was flown to Algeria.
Daoud was suspected of plotting the massacre of
Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Cames in
Munich.
Israel's recalled ambassador to France, Mor
dechai Gazit, returned home yesterday. He held
discussions at the airport with Shlomo Avineri,
director general of the Foreign Ministry who had
returned to Israel two hours earlier from Romania.
Outrage in Israel over the French action was cer
tain to heighten with reports yesterday from Paris
that France has sold 200 Mirage Fl fighter-bombers
to Egypt. It was widely speculated the impending
sale was one reason for the French haste in freeing
Daoud.
Israeli Foreign Ministry officials had no im
mediate comment on reports of the Mirage sale.
Bell says he'll fire FBI chief Kelley
Washington — Griffin Bell, the attorney
general-designate, promised yesterday to replace
Clarence Kelley as FBI director "before too long."
Testifying at the second day of his confirmation
hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
Bell signaled for the first time that the Carter ad
ministration has decided to let Kelley go.
Bell also pledged that as attorney general, he will
not authorize electronic surveillance against
American citizens without court warrants. That
would carry the current Justice Department policy a
step further toward protection of individual rights.
Bell, an Atlanta lawyer and former federal appe
als judge, also said he will personally go into courts
to urge judges to impose prison sentences against
convicted price fixers.
Bell again was questioned closely about his role
in the school desegregation turmoil in the late
1950s in his native Georgia, where he was counsel
to then Gov. Ernest Vandiver.
He professed pride in his past record, insisted
that he acted as a moderating influence to keep
public schools open, and claimed he has become
more sensitive to the rights of racial minorities in
the years since. Bell was a federal judge from 1901
to 1976.
Hormone use, birth defects linked
Boston — Women who take birth control pills
and other female hormones during pregnancy are
about twice as likely as usual to have babies with
heart defects, a study shows.
A survey of pregnant women, analyzed at Boston
University, showed the increased risk of heart trou

ble in the infants of women who took two com
monly prescribed female hormones, estrogen and
progestogen.
Most of the problems, they found, occurred
among women who took the drug, sometimes acci
dentally, during the second and third months of
pregnancy.
Results of the study, conducted by doctors at the
Drug Epidemiology Unit of Boston University Med
ical Center, were scheduled to be published in to
day's issue ot the New England Journal of
Medicine.
Women are ordinarily urged to stop taking birth
control pills when they become pregnant.
Study warns of medical record abuse
Washington — A government report warned yes
terday that the medical records of millions of
Americans are being punched into computers with
little regard for individual rights of privacy.
"We are on the threshold of abuse," said author
Alan Westin of Columbia University.
The report, prepared for the National Bureau of
Standards, said most Americans are willing to pro
vide medical information about themselves with
out suspecting that it might go far beyond the files
of their own doctors or hospitals.
Increasingly, the report found, health agencies
are creating centralized computer files which are
vulnerable to abuse.
In his report, Westin said while the computeriza
tion of medical records is too new to provide evi
dence of abuse, there have been enough serious
incidents with old-fashioned printed files to know
there will be attempts to break into computerized
medical files.
At the very least, Westin said, the "easily re
trieved identified records of people whose prob
lems include drug abuse, alcoholism, sexual devia
tions and violations are a tremendous temptation to
local and national law enforcement agencies. . . ."
The report recommends that patients be granted
full access to their medical records as one means of
reducing chances for abuse. Only serious cases of
mental illness would be excluded.
Carter to try to settle Mid East crisis
Washington — President-elect Jimmy Carter said
yesterday he will hold talks here shortly after tak
ing office with leaders from foreign trouble spots.
He also said there is "a fine opportunity for drama
tic improvements" in efforts for a Middle East set
tlement.
Carter said he is "deeply disturbed and very
much surprised" that the French released Abu
Daoud, a suspected terrorist leader accused of mas
terminding the 1972 attack on members of Israel's
Olympic team in Munich.
"There will be a number of foreign leaders that
will come to our country to meet with me during
the first few weeks of my administration," Carter
told reporters during a break in an all-day foreign
affairs meeting with congressional leaders.

He said the meetings will be part of "a concerted
effort" to negotiate settlements in "many areas of
the world...
Carter said the first step would be to send U.S.
representatives into these areas. At the same time,
he said, "I would visit personally with a number of
the leaders of other nations who live in trouble
spots in the world.
"I would agree that most of the meetings, perhaps
all of them, would be here in this country between
myself and those leaders," he said.
Carter said the Middle East, Cyprus and South
Africa were among trouble spots where nations
"want the change in administration before seeking
enthusiastically the resolution of their problems."
Today's weather
Overcast with local fog nights and mornings but
mostly sunny afternoons through tomorrow. Little
temperature change. Lows in the upper 30s to mid
