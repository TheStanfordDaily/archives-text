# Ford presents farewell message to Congress
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — In a farewell <
address that he concluded with a
prayer for America, President Gerald
Ford told Congress last night that the
nation is more secure militarily,
stronger economically and more con
fident of the future than when his
White House stewardship began.
To President-elect Jimmy Carter,
eight days from power, Ford wished
"the very best in all that is good for
America."
Before going into joint session with
the Senate to hear the speech, the
House passed by acclamation a resolu
tion of tribute and affection to Ford
and his wife Betty.
The resolution said the Fords "have
conducted themselves with an open
ness and honesty that have done much
to restore confidence in our govern
ment and to earn them the respect of
the people of the United States."
Ford's third and last State of the
Union Address was a review of his
30-month presidency that omitted the
standard litany of recommendations
for congressional action — although it
included a renewal of some tax and
energy proposals he had advanced be
fore.
Ford said, "The people have spo
ken" and it is for Carter to outline in a
few days his priorities and his recom
mendations.
Ford did bequeath to Congress a
series of general proposals that would
benefit the new president.
He urged the Republican minority to
give Carter loyal support in foreign af
fairs. He said past abuses do not justify
congressional intrusion upon presi
dential responsibilities in foreign and
defense matters.
He said the nation's defense is in
good shape, but added: "It will require
a sustained effort over a period of years
to maintain these capabilities. . . ."
"In an era where the strategic nuc
lear forces are in rough equilibrium"
there may be greater peril of conven

tional conflict, the president said. So
he said the nation must maintain its
capability to handle and therefore
deter conventional challenges, par
ticularly in Europe.
To that end, Ford said he has submit
ted a five-year naval building program.
In addition, he said, because European
security and the integrity of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization remain
the cornerstone of American defense
policy, "I have initiated a special
long-term program to ensure the
capacity of the alliance to deter or de
feat aggression in Europe."
The address Ford prepared for a
joint session of Congress and a na
tional television audience contained
no new proposals. They would have
been pointless anyhow with the House
and Senate awaiting Carter's inaugura
tion in only eight days.
So Ford reviewed the presidency by
appointment he began with the resig
nation of Richard Nixon on Aug. 9,
1974.
"Taken in sum, I can report that the
State of the Union is good," he said.
"There is room for improvement as
always, but today we have a more per
fect Union than when my stewardship
began.
"The people have spoken," he said.
"They have chosen a new president
and a new Congress to work their will.
I congratulate you — particularly the
new members — as sincerely as I did
President-elect Carter.
i "In a few days, it will be his duty to
outline for you his priorities and legis
lative recommendations. Tonight, I
will not infringe on that responsibility,
but rather wish for him the very best in
all that is good for our country."
He said he will always treasure the
memories of his congressional career
as of his White House days, and then
he closed:
"My fellow Americans, I once asked
for your prayers and now I give you

mine: May God guide this wonderful
country, its people and those they have
chosen to lead them. May our third
century be illuminated by liberty and
blessed with brotherhood so that we
and all who come after us may be the
humble servants of thy peace. Amen."

there may be greater peril of conven

tional conflict, the president said. So
he said the nation must maintain its
capability to handle and therefore
deter conventional challenges, par
ticularly in Europe.
To that end, Ford said he has submit
ted a five-year naval building program.
In addition, he said, because European
security and the integrity of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization remain
the cornerstone of American defense
policy, "I have initiated a special
long-term program to ensure the
capacity of the alliance to deter or de
feat aggression in Europe."
The address Ford prepared for a
joint session of Congress and a na
tional television audience contained
no new proposals. They would have
been pointless anyhow with the House
and Senate awaiting Carter's inaugura
tion in only eight days.
So Ford reviewed the presidency by
appointment he began with the resig
nation of Richard Nixon on Aug. 9,
1974.
"Taken in sum, I can report that the
State of the Union is good," he said.
"There is room for improvement as
always, but today we have a more per
fect Union than when my stewardship
began.
"The people have spoken," he said.
"They have chosen a new president
and a new Congress to work their will.
I congratulate you — particularly the
new members — as sincerely as I did
President-elect Carter.
i "In a few days, it will be his duty to
outline for you his priorities and legis
lative recommendations. Tonight, I
will not infringe on that responsibility,
but rather wish for him the very best in
all that is good for our country."
He said he will always treasure the
memories of his congressional career
as of his White House days, and then
he closed:
"My fellow Americans, I once asked
for your prayers and now I give you

mine: May God guide this wonderful
country, its people and those they have
chosen to lead them. May our third
century be illuminated by liberty and
blessed with brotherhood so that we
and all who come after us may be the
humble servants of thy peace. Amen."
Washington (AP) — In a farewell <
address that he concluded with a
prayer for America, President Gerald
Ford told Congress last night that the
nation is more secure militarily,
stronger economically and more con
fident of the future than when his
White House stewardship began.
To President-elect Jimmy Carter,
eight days from power, Ford wished
"the very best in all that is good for
America."
Before going into joint session with
the Senate to hear the speech, the
House passed by acclamation a resolu
tion of tribute and affection to Ford
and his wife Betty.
The resolution said the Fords "have
conducted themselves with an open
ness and honesty that have done much
to restore confidence in our govern
ment and to earn them the respect of
the people of the United States."
Ford's third and last State of the
Union Address was a review of his
30-month presidency that omitted the
standard litany of recommendations
for congressional action — although it
included a renewal of some tax and
energy proposals he had advanced be
fore.
Ford said, "The people have spo
ken" and it is for Carter to outline in a
few days his priorities and his recom
mendations.
Ford did bequeath to Congress a
series of general proposals that would
benefit the new president.
He urged the Republican minority to
give Carter loyal support in foreign af
fairs. He said past abuses do not justify
congressional intrusion upon presi
dential responsibilities in foreign and
defense matters.
He said the nation's defense is in
good shape, but added: "It will require
a sustained effort over a period of years
to maintain these capabilities. . . ."
"In an era where the strategic nuc
lear forces are in rough equilibrium"
