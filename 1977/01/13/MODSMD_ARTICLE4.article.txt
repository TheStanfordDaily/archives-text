# 'Quad' in better shape
## 
### Tim Reagan 
The Quad, Stanford's yearbook, is enjoying prosperity
compared to a few years ago although stil 1 recovering from
its two-year halt in publication from 1971 to 1973, accord
ing to Mamie Shih, Quad business manager.
Of the 2000 yearbooks ordered, 1350 have already been
sold, Shih said. This is an increase of about 350 over last
year's sales at this time, she added.
The entire order of 1800 1976 Quad's sold out last June.
The larger order of 2000 for this year is also expected to
sell out.
The Quad is in an increasingly stable financial condi
tion. "We will meet all costs this year," said Shih, "as well
as have a reasonable operating budget for next year."
The stress has been on quality this year, according to
Quad editor Katie Bowen. All advertising has been elimi
nated in order to give more room for photographs of stu
dents. To raise money, theQuad will rely more heavily on
donations which they have been actively soliciting. A
page in the senior section will be devoted to crediting the
donors.
Earlier difficulties
First printed in 1895, the Quad's publication was sus
pended in 1971 due to financial difficulty caused by poor
sales and bad financial management, Shih said. The
Quad's publication halt had precedents: Princeton and
Penn State at one time had to stop publishing their year

books.
The Quad was revived for publication in 1974 when
there were enough students interested in a yearbook to
make it economically viable, said Shih and Bowen.
Increased quality of the book is expected to generate
future sales, Shih said.
Change in format
A change in format has been designed for the 272-page
1977 Quad. "Last year it had no theme," said Bowen. "It
didn't reflect the undergraduate community." She said
this year's yearbook would be more consistent in layout
and design.
Bowen explained that the Quad will include more can
did and campus life photos. It will have a chronological
layout with sections separated by quarter. Residences will
be pictured in the fall section, senior pictures in the spring
section. Outside photographs and material have been sol
icited.
Currently, the Quad's staff of about 50 people are half
finished with their annual task of putting together the
yearbook. They expect to be finished by the end of this
quarter.
In view of last year's sellout, those who wish to purch
ase a 1977 Quad are encouraged to do so early. Yearbooks
can be ordered for $15 at the Quad office weekdays from 2
p.m. to 4 p.m. The Quad will be available the week before
dead week of spring quarter.

be pictured in the fall section, senior pictures in the spring
section. Outside photographs and material have been sol
icited.
Currently, the Quad's staff of about 50 people are half
finished with their annual task of putting together the
yearbook. They expect to be finished by the end of this
quarter.
In view of last year's sellout, those who wish to purch
ase a 1977 Quad are encouraged to do so early. Yearbooks
can be ordered for $15 at the Quad office weekdays from 2
p.m. to 4 p.m. The Quad will be available the week before
dead week of spring quarter.
The Quad, Stanford's yearbook, is enjoying prosperity
compared to a few years ago although stil 1 recovering from
its two-year halt in publication from 1971 to 1973, accord
ing to Mamie Shih, Quad business manager.
Of the 2000 yearbooks ordered, 1350 have already been
sold, Shih said. This is an increase of about 350 over last
year's sales at this time, she added.
The entire order of 1800 1976 Quad's sold out last June.
The larger order of 2000 for this year is also expected to
sell out.
The Quad is in an increasingly stable financial condi
tion. "We will meet all costs this year," said Shih, "as well
as have a reasonable operating budget for next year."
The stress has been on quality this year, according to
Quad editor Katie Bowen. All advertising has been elimi
nated in order to give more room for photographs of stu
dents. To raise money, theQuad will rely more heavily on
donations which they have been actively soliciting. A
page in the senior section will be devoted to crediting the
donors.
Earlier difficulties
First printed in 1895, the Quad's publication was sus
pended in 1971 due to financial difficulty caused by poor
sales and bad financial management, Shih said. The
Quad's publication halt had precedents: Princeton and
Penn State at one time had to stop publishing their year

books.
The Quad was revived for publication in 1974 when
there were enough students interested in a yearbook to
make it economically viable, said Shih and Bowen.
Increased quality of the book is expected to generate
future sales, Shih said.
Change in format
A change in format has been designed for the 272-page
1977 Quad. "Last year it had no theme," said Bowen. "It
didn't reflect the undergraduate community." She said
this year's yearbook would be more consistent in layout
and design.
Bowen explained that the Quad will include more can
did and campus life photos. It will have a chronological
layout with sections separated by quarter. Residences will
be pictured in the fall section, senior pictures in the spring
section. Outside photographs and material have been sol
icited.
