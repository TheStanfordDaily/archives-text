# Students ignore final message

### Jim Tranquada 
President Gerald Ford's annual State
of the Union address last night gener
ated little enthusiasm among students
and faculty contacted by the Daily.
A survey of student residences indi
cated that many students were either
unaware of the address, were too busy,
or considered the address not impor
tant enough to watch.
A Roble resident reported that
"Trekkies" in the house had voted
down watching President Ford's ad
dress in favor of Star Trek. "But then,
both have an other-worldly quality,"
she added.
Mike Epperson, a student in the
French House, was unaware t hat either
the president orStar Trek wereon. "If 1
had known both were on, I would have
watched Star Trek and turned to the
president during commercials," he
said.
Branner resident David Rogers knew
of the address but did not watch it. "1
can't see it as being that important," he
said. "Ford would just try to give some
credibility to his record, and say he
was leaving the country in good
shape."
The faculty audience was curtailed
by the fact that the address was broad
cast while many were on their way
home. The reaction of those who did
see the president was muted.
"The address was essentially a per
sonal statement as to what he (the pres
ident) has accomplished," said George
Bach, professor of economics. Saying
Ford was "looking back with a rosy
glow," Bach cited the president's re
cord as "pretty good," despite the con
tinuing high level of unemployment.
George Marotta, senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, commented that "I
thought it was a very good summary of
his philosophical belief. I think it was
a fine tribute to the man by the Con
gress for his service as a transitional
president ... he said about what the
people expected ... it was a very pre
dictable kind of message."
Political Science Prof. Jan Triska
characterized President Ford as hav
ing "meant well," being "not very
bright," and "a nice guy who brought
the nation together, essentially sub
stituting for two years." Triska, who
advised Jimmy Carter during his cam
paign, said he "wasn't very impressed
— the speech was warm, friendly —
but I wasn't very impressed. I think
Ford will be known for not being
elected."
