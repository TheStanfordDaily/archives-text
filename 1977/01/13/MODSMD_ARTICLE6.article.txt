# Open foreign policy predicted
## 
### Marc Strassman 
First of a five-part series
on the Carter administration
"I expect a great deal from the
Carter Administration," said Politi
cal Science Professor Jan Triska,
who wrote a number of position
papers on foreign policy for the
Carter-Mondale campaign.
Triska's feelings are typical of
other political scientists on cam
pus.
Several professors expressed
confidence in the ability of Secret
ary of State-designate Cyrus Vance.
Alexander Dallin, professor of
history and political science, said
he was "hoping for the best without
being overly optimistic." He added
that he thought that Vance was an
example of the "good people" that
Carter was using to formulate and
carrying out his foreign policy.
Triska said that Vance was "a
competent man" without the tre
mendous ego belonging to outgo
ing Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer.
Single perspective
Triska added that, in his opinion,
U.S. foreign policy under Carter
would get "away from the single
perspective" of detente with the
Soviet Union that characterized the
Kissinger era.
He said he thought that foreign
policy formulation in the Carter
administration would move away
from the State Department towards
the White House where Carter will

control foreign policy decision
making through the National Sec
urity Council and his national sec
urity adviser, Zbigniew√ürzezinski.
Triska said that Vance would do
"much better than Henry (Kis
singer)" in maintaining "a very
open" foreign policy operation. He
pointed out that as national security
adviser, Brzezinski will not be re
porting to Congress as Kissinger
did when he was both national sec
urity adviser and secretary of state.
Policy formulation
Triska said that Carter envisioned
himself and Brzezinski with Vance
mostly in an implementation role.
Triska stressed the opportunities
for "creativity" in policy im
plementation, and praised Vance's
abilities in this regard.
Dallin said he thought that the
appointments of Vance, Harold
Brown as secretary of defense and
the possible appointment of Paul
Warnke to head the American
SALT negotiation team seemed to
indicate "a genuine commitment"
on Carter's part to rapidly negotiate
an arms limitation agreement with
the Soviet Union.
Referring to recent disclosures
leaking estimates of Soviet
strength, Dallin claimed that "the
CIA (Central Intelligence Agency)
used these people."
CIA involvement?
Triska and Dallin both com
mented that they thought the recent
rash of gloomy estimates of Soviet

strategic strength were co
ordinated by the CIA.
Dallin said hard-liners in the de
fense establishment "are worried"
about possible cuts in the defense
budget, and called the recent efforts
by departing officials to portray the
Soviet Union as superior to the Un
ited States in strategic nuclear
capability "an attempt at an end
run"and "a last minute attempt to
influence policy."
This "one-sided attempt at pres
sure" according to Dallin, may lead
to congressional hearings on the
subject, but he predicted it would
not succeed in heightening fears of
Soviet intentions and increasing
defense spending.
Cautious
Triska maintained that "Carter is
cautious" and said that the new
president will "not be party to this
whole CIA" effort.
Asked if he thought the Carter
administration would be unduly
influenced by these charges of
growing Soviet advantage, Triska
said, "I hope they won't be."
Dallin said that the involvement
of both Carter and Brzezinski with
the Trilateral Commission, a con
sortium of politicians and scholars
from Western Europe. North
America and Japan, would mean
closer co-operation with these other
areas and would lead to "avoiding
slaps at Japan and Europe" that
have characterized the Republican
