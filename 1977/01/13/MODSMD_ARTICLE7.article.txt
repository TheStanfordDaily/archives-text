# U.S. backs Taiwan oppression

Foldy, et al.

While the news media is presenting
alarming reports of atrocities commit
ted by dictatorships in such countries
as Chile, Argentina, Iran and the
Philippines, Taiwan has managed
successfully to dodge public attention.
The recent secret trial of Chen
Ming-Chung, however, is bringing
Taiwan's political repression into the
open.
Chen's case may appear to the public
as an isolated incident. But the fact is
that secret arrests, tortures and other
violations of basic human rights have
been common practice on the Taiwan
island since 1949.
This kind of political repression is
part of the real scene in Taiwan despite,
the Kuomintang (KMT) regime's ef
forts to project an image of "Free
China" to the outside world.
What is revealing to the public is the
fact that repressive regimes are not just
oppressing dissidents within their
own countries, but are extending their
repression abroad into other countries,
including the United States.
Not unique
What the South Korean Park regime
and its Korean Central Intelligence
Agency have done in the U.S. Con
gress and in the Korean communities
in the United States is not a unique
example.
The Taiwan KMT regime has de
veloped a more subtle network of rep
ressive mechanisms in the various
Chinese communities within the Un
ited States — commonly known
among the Chinese as the "White Ter
ror."
It is well known that the KMT con
trols most of the powerful community
associations in our Chinese com
munities (such as the Six Companies
in San Francisco). In San Francisco, for
example, the KMT dominates the
Chinese newspapers, controls a
Chinese TV station and wields its
power to influence Chinatown poli
tics.
However, these activities go far

beyond the Chinese communities into
society at large. In 1976, the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology,
UC-Berkeley, the University of Min
nesota and seven other major cam
puses across the country have reported
KMT intimidation and harassment of
Chinese students interested in poli
tics.
Harsh threats
Threatening anonymous letters and
phone calls are not uncommon. More
serious intimidation takes the form of
blatant, harsh and often physical
threats. Students are "hired" by the
Taiwan consulate to spy on fellow
students and to report their actions.
Students who are reported and
"blacklisted" by informers have had
their passports revoked by the Taiwan
Counsulate and thus were forced to re
turn home. Upon their return to
Taiwan, these students face prosecu
tion and are prevented from leaving

home again. Family members of stu
dents abroad are also harassed.
Even more astounding is that the
"Taiwan Lobby" (which grew out of
the original "China Lobby" of the '50s
and '60s) is more active than ever be
fore in the U.S. Congress. Together
with certain interest groups, it lobbies
for a foreign policy that gives military
and economic aid to Taiwan.
Thus it is not surprising at all to
realize that since 1972, Taiwan has
been allowed to open five new consu
lates in the United States for a total of
15 — a privilege no other foreign gov
ernment shares.
Here to stay
This situation of Taiwan's meddling
in U.S. affairs, together with the milit
ary and economic "assistance" the
American government is giving to
Taiwan, is here to stay because of U.S.
corporate interests in Taiwan.
Since 1972, U.S. investment and
trade have doubled in Taiwan. Loans
from the U.S. government and indus
try for the last three years total $2.5
billion. The Taiwan regime needs
American investment to support its
repressive regime; American corpora
tions profit frQm cheap Taiwanese
labor.
The KMT government thus seeks to
expand its involvement in American
politics. Meanwhile, by repressing
dissent at home and abroad, the KMT
regime hopes to project a stable society
suitable for continued investment.
Americans must start to re-evaluate
U.S. interests in Taiwan, and the na
ture of the United States government's
involvement there. Meanwhile,
Taiwanese students in the United
States will continue to struggle for
democracy and human rights at home.
