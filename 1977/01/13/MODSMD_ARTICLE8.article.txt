Add a macho house
No doubt many students here feel
that, with the recent proposals for two
additional theme houses, German
Studies and Androgyny, the trend to
ward more theme houses has reached
an absurd level. But those students are
wrong.
We see no reason why this campus
should not become even more com
partmentalized than it already is. Im
agine a Stanford in which students live
only with those who have the same
political, religious, social, ethnic or
academic characteristics.
Imagine, if you will, the broadened
learning that would take place in such
a diversified climate.
There are many possibilities for ad
ditional theme houses that can even
tually accommodate everyone. For
example, there could be a Nonpractic
ing Episcopalian Theme House, a
Macho Theme House, a Latvian Theme
House, a FORTRAN Theme House and
a Theological Engineering Studies
House. The possibilities are limitless.
The continual spread of theme
houses should be encouraged, not
questioned. After all, the purpose of a
liberal education is specialization,
isn't it?
