# Committee approves Carter pick for defense
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — President-elect
Jimmy Carter's choice as defense sec
retary won the formal endorsement of
a Senate committee yesterday while
hearings over three other cabinet picks
produced little to break up the friendly
Democratic wave carrying them to
ward confirmation.
Harold Brown, a nuclear weapons
whiz and former Air Force chief, was
recommended unanimously by the
Armed Services Committee. Chairman
John Stennis (D-Miss.), scoffed at alle
gations that Brown would be soft with
the Soviet Union on the issue of arms
control, saying "thereare no particular
minuses that we could find" with the
nominee.
Prediction
Stennis predicted that Brown, the
second of Carter's choices to be ap
proved in committee, would be con
firmed by the full Senate on inaugura
tion day, Jan. 20. Agriculture
Secretary-designate Robert Bergland
was the first to win committee recom
mendation.
Meanwhile, Griffin Bell, attorney
general-designate and the most con
troversial of Carter's cabinet picks,
seemed to be breezing through hear
ings by the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee despite opposition from the chair
man of the congressional Black
Caucus.
And hearings over Joseph Califano,
named to head the Health, Education
and Welfare Department, and Ray
Marshall, the labor secretary
designate, produced both pointed
questions and noteworthy answers but
nothing that might imperil their
chances.
'Mastermind'
Bell, an Atlanta attorney and former
U.S. appellate judge, was attacked by
Rep. Parren Mitchell (D-Md) as "the
mastermind of Georgia's massive re
sistance" to court-ordered school de
segregation in the late 19505.
Mitchell and his brother Clarence, a
National Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People official,
testified that Bell, as a Georgia state
official, had knuckled under to the
demands of segregationists in a school
districting fight 20 years ago.
Their words were countered by
former Watergate special prosecutor
Leon Jaworski, who cited what he
termed Bell's courage as a federal
judge in handling a contempt case
against former Mississippi Gov. Ross
Barnett, who tried to block James
Meredith from the University of Mis
sissippi in 1962.
In that case, said Jaworski, Bell "had
the courage of his convictions and
went right down the line in support of
the rule of law."
Meredith was admitted to the school
under a court order amid rioting. The
contempt charges against Barnett
were, years later, dismissed.

Bell, an Atlanta attorney and former
U.S. appellate judge, was attacked by
Rep. Parren Mitchell (D-Md) as "the
mastermind of Georgia's massive re
sistance" to court-ordered school de
segregation in the late 19505.
Mitchell and his brother Clarence, a
National Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People official,
testified that Bell, as a Georgia state
official, had knuckled under to the
demands of segregationists in a school
districting fight 20 years ago.
Their words were countered by
former Watergate special prosecutor
Leon Jaworski, who cited what he
termed Bell's courage as a federal
judge in handling a contempt case
against former Mississippi Gov. Ross
Barnett, who tried to block James
Meredith from the University of Mis
sissippi in 1962.
In that case, said Jaworski, Bell "had
the courage of his convictions and
went right down the line in support of
the rule of law."
Meredith was admitted to the school
under a court order amid rioting. The
contempt charges against Barnett
were, years later, dismissed.
Washington (AP) — President-elect
Jimmy Carter's choice as defense sec
retary won the formal endorsement of
a Senate committee yesterday while
hearings over three other cabinet picks
produced little to break up the friendly
Democratic wave carrying them to
ward confirmation.
Harold Brown, a nuclear weapons
whiz and former Air Force chief, was
recommended unanimously by the
Armed Services Committee. Chairman
John Stennis (D-Miss.), scoffed at alle
gations that Brown would be soft with
the Soviet Union on the issue of arms
control, saying "thereare no particular
minuses that we could find" with the
nominee.
Prediction
Stennis predicted that Brown, the
second of Carter's choices to be ap
proved in committee, would be con
firmed by the full Senate on inaugura
tion day, Jan. 20. Agriculture
Secretary-designate Robert Bergland
was the first to win committee recom
mendation.
Meanwhile, Griffin Bell, attorney
general-designate and the most con
troversial of Carter's cabinet picks,
seemed to be breezing through hear
ings by the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee despite opposition from the chair
man of the congressional Black
Caucus.
And hearings over Joseph Califano,
named to head the Health, Education
and Welfare Department, and Ray
Marshall, the labor secretary
designate, produced both pointed
questions and noteworthy answers but
nothing that might imperil their
chances.
