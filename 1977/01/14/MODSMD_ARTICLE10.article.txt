I read with a great deal of interest
and agreement Shannon Blando's col
umn (Daily, Jan. 10), in which she de
plores the current state of commercial
television. I (who used to watch televi
sion a good deal, and have only re
cently "kicked the habit") too am as
tonished — perhaps "sickened" is a
better word — at the vulgar and dis
gusting fare offered us by CBS, NBC
and ABC.
Lest I sound like a Puritan, let me
state that sex and violence may very
easily be necessary, valuable and re
warding — if properly presented.
What is objectionable is vulgar,
"double-entendrish" sex, racial or
sexual stereotyping, and gratuitous
violence, examples of which being
given in the column.
Blando, however, misses the root of
the problem: it is not so much that the
network officials program shows

which focus on "violence, promis
cuity and disregard for common de
cency"; it is rather that the public
motivates them by making such prog
rams the most popular.
I do not know precise Nielsen rank
ings, but I do know that shows such as
Laverne and Shirley (surely one of the
most odious new shows). Police Story,
and other shows like them are consis
tently among the most popular. So
while it is certainly reprehensible of
network programmers to schedule
such shows, it is just as understanda
ble; furthermore, they have a perfect
excuse: "This is what the public
wants."
So not only does the public get what
it wants, it all too probably gets just
what it deserves.
