# Androgyny house proposal doubtful

Marc Zasada

It is with much trepidation that I
approach the composition of this let
ter, and not without cause, for it is the
fate of all those who dare write against
the loquacious proponents of
feminism to be immediately labelled
and ignored as "chauvinist" or
"sexist" or another of their catch-all
and immediately condemning
phrases. But I shall summon my cour
age and proceed.
My subject in this brave enterprise is
the proposed "androgyny" theme
house so eloquently proposed by Carla
Lupi and Jane Angeles (Daily, Jan.ll)as
a place where the emerging art of
"feminism/humanism" (a newly

coined term to appease those of the
male persuasion) would be practiced
by "conscious" individuals. A place,
they say, where women could be
treated with "dignity" and males
could "overcome their hardened
spirits."
Now all this sounds very well and
good, and certainly I listened with
sympathy to the obligingly brief re
hearsal of the woman's-plight-in
modern-America in this article, and
with continued interest to the sum
mary of Asst. Psychology Prof. Sandra
Bern's consummate analysis of sex
role conflicts, and was certainly struck
to the quick with the stunning
specificity, cutting insight, and pro
fessional acumen of the column's
central quotation (of Bern):
"But an adult also has to be able to
relate to other human beings as people,
to be sensitive to their needs and to be
concerned about their welfare, as well
as to be able to depend on them for
emotional support."
Again, how can anyone do else but
applaud this finely wrought statement
of human needs?
My difficulty is in seeing just how a
theme house would accomplish this
Utopian ideal. Would it be a house
which will "incorporate its theme of
feminism/humanism into both
academic and day-to-day aspects of
living" (a meaningless statement to
my ignorant mind), perhaps striving to
overshadow sexual mores with a cult
of Platonic friendship — or will An

drogyny be simply a building where
feminist speakers will find a ready
podium?
If you desire the former, I question
the ease or even possibility of con
structing such a community. If you
plan merely the latter, I would suggest
you instead procure a room in Tresid
der every other Thursday night.
As 1 perceive it, the Androgyny
theme house would be little more nor
less than any other co-op row house.
They would have house meetings
every Monday night (which the An
drogynians would call encounter ses
sions). They would have a cooperative
work system (just as I clean the bath
room in my row house, so would the
Androgynians have such "cross
stereotypic role reversals").
And all the students would cooper
ate to be friends and be friendly (just as
I have tried to befriend those in myrow
house). The only difference my un
socially-conscious mind might distin
guish in such an establishment would
be a stream of "feminist/humanist"
speakers, a predominance of vocal
egalitarians, and a neutral color
scheme.
My point in all this sarcasm is sim
ply that Androgyny House has no
point. When you winnow out all the

vacuous generalization and fuzzy
headed sloganism, you will find that
these people want little more than all
of us want out of a house — and at a
cost of denying the rest of us a bit more
freedom in residence selection. At
least those in other theme houses (not
ably the language houses) have a defi
nite intent and purpose which might
conceivably be furthered by the exis
tence of such houses.
I would like Lupi and Angeles to
return to the public forum and this
time justify the establishment of their
little paradise, and not justify the fight
for "feminism/humanism" but justify
t he snatching of a university residence
for the androgynous.

It is with much trepidation that I
approach the composition of this let
ter, and not without cause, for it is the
fate of all those who dare write against
the loquacious proponents of
feminism to be immediately labelled
and ignored as "chauvinist" or
"sexist" or another of their catch-all
and immediately condemning
phrases. But I shall summon my cour
age and proceed.
My subject in this brave enterprise is
the proposed "androgyny" theme
house so eloquently proposed by Carla
Lupi and Jane Angeles (Daily, Jan.ll)as
a place where the emerging art of
"feminism/humanism" (a newly

coined term to appease those of the
male persuasion) would be practiced
by "conscious" individuals. A place,
they say, where women could be
treated with "dignity" and males
could "overcome their hardened
spirits."
Now all this sounds very well and
good, and certainly I listened with
sympathy to the obligingly brief re
hearsal of the woman's-plight-in
modern-America in this article, and
with continued interest to the sum
mary of Asst. Psychology Prof. Sandra
Bern's consummate analysis of sex
role conflicts, and was certainly struck
to the quick with the stunning
specificity, cutting insight, and pro
fessional acumen of the column's
central quotation (of Bern):
"But an adult also has to be able to
relate to other human beings as people,
to be sensitive to their needs and to be
concerned about their welfare, as well
as to be able to depend on them for
emotional support."
Again, how can anyone do else but
applaud this finely wrought statement
of human needs?
My difficulty is in seeing just how a
theme house would accomplish this
Utopian ideal. Would it be a house
which will "incorporate its theme of
feminism/humanism into both
academic and day-to-day aspects of
living" (a meaningless statement to
my ignorant mind), perhaps striving to
overshadow sexual mores with a cult
of Platonic friendship — or will An

drogyny be simply a building where
feminist speakers will find a ready
podium?
If you desire the former, I question
the ease or even possibility of con
structing such a community. If you
plan merely the latter, I would suggest
you instead procure a room in Tresid
der every other Thursday night.
As 1 perceive it, the Androgyny
theme house would be little more nor
less than any other co-op row house.
They would have house meetings
every Monday night (which the An
drogynians would call encounter ses
sions). They would have a cooperative
work system (just as I clean the bath
room in my row house, so would the
Androgynians have such "cross
stereotypic role reversals").
And all the students would cooper
ate to be friends and be friendly (just as
I have tried to befriend those in myrow
house). The only difference my un
socially-conscious mind might distin
guish in such an establishment would
be a stream of "feminist/humanist"
speakers, a predominance of vocal
egalitarians, and a neutral color
scheme.
My point in all this sarcasm is sim
ply that Androgyny House has no
point. When you winnow out all the

vacuous generalization and fuzzy
headed sloganism, you will find that
these people want little more than all
of us want out of a house — and at a
cost of denying the rest of us a bit more
freedom in residence selection. At
least those in other theme houses (not
ably the language houses) have a defi
nite intent and purpose which might
conceivably be furthered by the exis
tence of such houses.
I would like Lupi and Angeles to
return to the public forum and this
time justify the establishment of their
little paradise, and not justify the fight
for "feminism/humanism" but justify
t he snatching of a university residence
for the androgynous.
