Jarrah returned to entertain Arroyo residents with his piano bar routine last Friday night after
wandering into the house lounge Thursday evening in search of a telephone. He saw the
piano, and in his words "the keyboard went to singing." His audience quickly grew to nearly
70, and the R.A.s invited him back to play again. Sam McGowan, 26, known professionally
as Jarrah, has played in bars and lounges throughout California, Arizona and Mexico, and is
now living in Palo Alto.
