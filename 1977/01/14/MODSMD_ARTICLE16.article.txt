# Survey says students content with Ro Mo Houses' features

Residents of the new Robert
Moore Houses are very con
tented with the structures, ac
cording to the results of a survey
conducted by the Subcommittee
on Residences of the University
Committee on Services to Stu
dents (COSS/R),
Members of the American
Studies (Robert Moore South)
and the Italian (Robert Moore
North) theme houses often cite
the structural aesthetics as posi
tive aspects of the residences.
"The furniture, the carpets . . .
everything was done in good
taste," commented one American
Studies resident.
The furniture for both houses
is Danish-style natural light
wood.
The structural design of both
houses facilitate both unity and
privacy. Rooms are on the sec
ond and third floors of both
houses, clustered around an
open central area in Casa Italia
and flanking an open stairway in

the American Studies house.
"One thing that's really great is
the open staircase for congregat
ing" said a member of the latter.
It was agreed that the sound
proofing was much better in
both houses than in dorms.
Survey respondents said the
facilities have added to the
theme programs, through the
provision of seminar rooms for
meetings and classes, and sun
ken living rooms for smaller
group interaction and relaxa

tion.
Complaints and suggestions
for improvements were rela
tively few and minor. Bathroom
accessories, expensive clothes
dryers (25 cents), sharp-edged
low light fixtures, only one
closet per two-room double, in
convenient bike storage, and
ants were mentioned. Residents
of both houses agreed that they
were "very happy" living there
and would return next year if
they could.
