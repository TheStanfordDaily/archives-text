What is it? It's a British game,
it's easy to play, and it was
purchased by two million
Americans in the last year and a
half.
It's called Mastermind, and
it's loved by those who make it,
those who sell it, and those who
play it.
"In the spring of 1972, the
public had never heard of Mas
termind. By Christmas 1976, we
sold 15 million sets," says Colin
Wright of Invicta Plastics.
Sales excellent
"Sales are excellent. We have
a hard time keeping it in stock,"
says a Toys R Us spokesman.
"It's simple but fascinating,"
says Wayne Wager, a Master
mind addict. "And it taxes your
mind."
The object of this "battle of
wits and logic between two

players" is to guess the colors
and positions of four pegs hid
den behind a shield.
The "codebreaker" tries to
duplicate the row of pegs by
placing identical pegs in rows of
holes on his side of the board.
After each attempt, the
"codemaker" provides clues to
the correct answer by scoring
each guess with black or white
pegs. Black means "right
color—right position," white
means "right color —wrong pos
ition".
Ten attempts
The codebreaker is given ten
attempts to find the code —one of
1296 possible permutations.
Luck counts a great deal early in
the game, but interpreting the
scoring pegs involves lots of
logic.
"It's not a kid's game. It appe
als to everybody. Everyone tries
to invent a code nobody can
break," says one local player.
And, as Invicta officials are
fond of pointing out, Master
mind requires no conversation,
so it can be played by the deaf,

the mute, and people who don't
speak the same language.
International affairs
A Stanford student once spent
three hours in a Scotland train
station playing Mastermind
with a French girl. Neither spoke
the-other's language, but the
manufacturers encourage such
international relations by
thoughtfully including direc
tions in ten languages.
Invicta has even produced a
Mastermind for the blind, with
different numbers of bumps on
the tops of the different pegs.
Wager, a junior in Mechanical
Engineering, bought a Master
mind set here and took it to Stan
ford's British campus with him
last year, where he "got to play
ing it all the time".
"It was so hard, and it in
furiated me so much that I was
addicted to it,"he says."I never
got very good at it, though. It
takes me a lot longer if somebody
includes more than one of a par
ticular color."
Back to dominoes
Wager says that since return
ing from England he has aban
doned Mastermind in favor of
dominoes.
According toTerry Durnin, an
Invicta employe who has mas
tered Mastermind in his spare
time, the game was never truly
invented. He says the Babylo
nians played a very similar game
for money.
Invicta spiced up a rather
bland line of plastic products
(plastic shutters and spillproof
dog dishes) when they bought
the idea for the current version
from an Israeli postal worker
named Mordecai Meirowitz. The
royalties he earns have allowed
him to retire and give interviews
to People magazine.
Soaring sales
First introduced in England in
early 1972, Mastermind sales
soared beyond all expectations.
In May of 1975 it appeared on

this side of the Atlantic and one
million sets were sold in the first
year. Fifty thousand pieces sold
in two or three years is usually
considered very good.
The basic game sells for about
$4. Those who aren't willing to
invest that much in a pile of
moulded plastic can try their
luck, with the set available at the
Tresidder reading room.
Invicta's goal is to achieve a
saturation of 30 per cent of U.S.
housholds, and it is being done
without any advertising (except
articles like this one).
Mastermind strategy can be
come quite advanced. Playing
logically and carefully, most ex

perienced players can solve the
code in five moves. ButDurnin, a
mathematician, has worked out
the optimum means of finding
the correct pegs and usually suc
ceeds in four rows—when he can
find someone willing to play
him.
Tourney play
Mastermind competition has
reached the status of tournament
play. The second annual British
competition was held in London
last fall. More participants in a
publicity stunt than contestants,
the 30 players were not terribly
good at the game. A 20-year-old
woman won 250 pounds and a
trophy with a strategy best de

scribed as a random guess. The
competition may be expanded
next year to include the United
States.
Mastermind has established
itself. Toys R Us calls it a "sta
ble" product, a game that will
become a tradition like
Monopoly, chess or checkers.
Mathematicians are studying
it. Psychology students are writ
ing theses about Mastermind
experts enticing novices into
games and then humiliating
them. A New York publisher has
brought out a paperback of Mas
termind strategies, and the Au
stralian armed forces are testing
officer potential with the game.

More advanced versions of
Mastermind are now on the mar
ket. Deluxe Mastermind has five
holes in each row and more col
ors to choose from. Another set
incorporates shapes. Word Mas
termind was recently released,
and Number Mastermind is not
far behind.
"I know a lot of people who
have been introduced to it in the
last year. Everybody was giving
it to everybody for Christmas. It's
a grand game," says the man
from Toys R Us.
Mastermind just might be here
to stay.

Colorful concentration
The audience follows the action at the second annual Master
mind tournament. A game of logic and luck, Mastermind was

introduced in Britain five years ago. It has now caught on in this
country, where more than two million sets have been sold.
