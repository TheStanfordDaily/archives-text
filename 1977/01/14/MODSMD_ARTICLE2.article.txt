# Bureaucratic problems, cost block fall pre-reg

Why is it that students are allowed to
pre-register for the winter and spring
quarters, but not for the autumn quar
ter?
According to Assoc. Registrar
Robert Houghton, fall pre-registration
was used in 1972, but was sub
sequently dropped because of
bureaucratic hassles and prohibitive
costs.
The bureaucratic conflict of in
terests arose over deadlines during the
pre-registration process. The Regis
trar's Office needed information as
early as possible about room and board
charges from the Housing Office in
order to allow plenty of time for mail
ing Permits to Register (PTRs) to the
students during the summer.
However, the Housing Office could
not supply accurate information be
cause housing changes were being
made until the beginning of fall quar
ter. The compromise date chosen
"caused a considerable extra amount
of work for the Housing Office," said
Houghton.
Expenses add up
Fall pre-registration was also un
duly expensive because extra proces
sing was necessary to accommodate all
the changes that students made during
the course of the summer.
The PTRs had to be mailed to stu
dents' summer addresses. Housing
changes had to be reprocessed as did
all class and address changes.
"Students were unable to commit

themselves to fees or to classes,"
Houghton said.
There were additional costs for the
special size envelopes for the PTRs
and for the return postage required for
the payment half of the PTRs.
In an evaluation of the 1972 fall
pre-registration. Houghton wrote,
"Nearly all students (deferred) their
autumn quarter tuition and board and
room charges." He added that nearly
all students who completed their ad
vance registration felt it necessary to
return on one of the two registration
days anyway since they wanted to get a
validated sticker on their I.D. cards
and purchase their season football tic
kets."
Benefits only a few
Also, fall pre-registration only be
nefits the returning students, and thus
leaves out the entering freshmen and
graduate students. Because such a
large part of the student body was not
pre-processed, the Registrar's Office
felt it was not worth having fall pre
registration.
As a result of the many problems, it
was recommended by the Registrar's
Office to drop fall pre-registration and
institute class sign-tips, the procedure
now used.
It is doubtful that there will be a re
vival of the old system. There "were
hassles all the way through." said
Houghton. In summing up the Regis
trar's Office position. Houghton said,
"We don't plan to do it again."

Fall pre-registration was also un
duly expensive because extra proces
sing was necessary to accommodate all
the changes that students made during
the course of the summer.
The PTRs had to be mailed to stu
dents' summer addresses. Housing
changes had to be reprocessed as did
all class and address changes.
"Students were unable to commit

themselves to fees or to classes,"
Houghton said.

special size envelopes for the PTRs
and for the return postage required for
the payment half of the PTRs.

Benefits only a few
Also, fall pre-registration only be

leaves out the entering freshmen and
graduate students. Because such a
large part of the student body was not
pre-processed, the Registrar's Office
felt it was not worth having fall pre
registration.
As a result of the many problems, it
was recommended by the Registrar's
Office to drop fall pre-registration and
institute class sign-tips, the procedure
now used.

Why is it that students are allowed to
pre-register for the winter and spring
quarters, but not for the autumn quar
ter?
According to Assoc. Registrar
Robert Houghton, fall pre-registration
was used in 1972, but was sub
sequently dropped because of
bureaucratic hassles and prohibitive
costs.
The bureaucratic conflict of in
terests arose over deadlines during the
pre-registration process. The Regis
trar's Office needed information as
early as possible about room and board
charges from the Housing Office in
order to allow plenty of time for mail
ing Permits to Register (PTRs) to the
students during the summer.
However, the Housing Office could
not supply accurate information be
cause housing changes were being
made until the beginning of fall quar
ter. The compromise date chosen
"caused a considerable extra amount
of work for the Housing Office," said
Houghton.
