## 'Radical' film series begins 
### Marc Strassman 
A Saturday night series of
films that deals with political
and social themes, but is enter
taining as well, is being spon
sored this quarter by Against the
Grain, the occasional newspaper
of the Alliance for Radical
Change.
Dave Hawes, a Columbae resi
dent and a senior in economics
who helped organize the series,
said, "We've tried to pick good
films, ones that have a political
perspective, a political implica
tion."
The purpose of the series,
Hawes said, "is not just enter
tainment. It's much deeper than
entertainment; it's to convey an
interpretation of reality, to give a
better understanding of life and
revolution."
Hawes was unable to provide

an exact description of his posi
tion in organizing the project.
"We're very organized but we
don't have a lot of titles," he re
marked.
The series began last Saturday
in Cubberly Auditorium with
two screenings of Z, a contem
porary thriller by Costa-Gavras
based on the actual assassination
of a pacifist politician in pre
junta Greece. The film's music
was written by Mikis
Theodorakis who was for a time
imprisoned by the Greek junta.
Future selections, locations,
and times are:
—tomorrow, Jan. 15 in Bishop
Auditorium at 7 and 9:30 p.m.:
The Chase, directed by Arthur
Penn and starring Marlon
Brando, Jane Fonda, and Robert
Redford. (A Stanford alumnus,
who is working on the series but

who has declined to be iden
tified, called The Chase "a little
known film with a relatively
progressive analysis." It in
volves Brando as a sheriff and
Redford as an escapee in a
southern milieu. It's a pre
superstardom performance for
Redford.
—Jan. 29 in Cubberly Au
ditorium at 7 and 9:15: Love and
Anarchy, a film directed by Lina
Wertmuller, and a prize winner
at Cannes. The story is set in Italy
during the '30s. The hero is an
anarchist intellectual who lives
in a brothel and procrastinates
over his plan to assassinate Mus
solini.
—Feb. 5 inCubberly Auditorium
at 7 and 9p.m.:Gimme Shelter, a
production filmed at Altamont
Raceway in 1970, featuring Mick
Jagger, a knife, and assorted pool

cues. The anonymous alumnus
says this film provides a glimpse
of the "youth culture" of the late
'60s.
—Feb. 26 in Bishop Auditorium
at 7 and 9 p.m.: Lovejoy's Nuc
lear War, a documentary film
about an ecology freak in New
England who blew up the power
lines leading into a nuclear
power plant construction site
and argued in court that he did it
in self-defense to protect himself
from the nuclear power plant. He
was acquited in 1972. Two
shorts, Felix the Cat and Ambiin
(no "g") will also be shown.
—March 5 in Bishop Au
ditorium at 7 and 9:15 p.m.: On
the Waterfront, directed by Elia
Kazan and starring Marlon
Brando. This story deals with
union organizing on the docks of
New York City, and constitutes
Brando's second in the film
series. Brando who lives in
Tahiti, and has been active in
Native American causes, "con
sciously makes a lot of radical
films" says unnameable alum
nus.
The committed but incon
spicuous radical alumnus, who
while maintaining a low public
profile is in fact the eminence
gris of the film series, promised
that if the series breaks even,
then Against the Grain will
sponsor another group of films
next quarter, including State of
Siege (directed by Costa Gavras,
who directed Z,) Burn, and Av
enue of the Americas, whose
scriptwriter, Charles Horman,
died in Chile shortly after the
coup there in 1973.
Walt Spevak, last spring's
senior class president, one of the
series' organizers, and the per
son who selected the films, said,
'I hope that a lot of people will
watch the films, which have a
dual function: to entertain and to
educate".
