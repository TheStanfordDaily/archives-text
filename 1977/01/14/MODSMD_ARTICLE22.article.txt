# Marv shines in Oakland

Award-winning pianist-composer Marvin
Hamlisch showcased his classic masterpiece, A
Chorus Line, in a most unusual setting last
weekend. The site was the Paramount Theatre in
Oakland, and there were no dancers, no bright
lights, no frustrated budding starlets. In fact, the
only things that this performance had in common
with the original production were that they both
took place on Broadway, and they were both of the
upmost quality.
This time, it was the Oakland Symphony Or
chestra's turn to show its wares. Under the skillful
and charming personal direction of Hamlisch,
this orchestra proved that it possessed the flexibil
ity to handle popular music with the same feeling
and precision that have earned it such a fine repu
tation in the realm of classical music.
For this performance, the spotlight was on
Hamlisch. Judging by the quality of his music, as
well as his directing skills, this spotlight was well
deserved. Hamlisch divided his time evenly bet

ween playing at the piano (demonstrating his
mastery of jazz piano) and standing at the podium
before the orchestra. In both circumstances, he
showed clear control over the musicians, estab
lishing a rapport with the orchestra that
heightened the emotional effectiveness of the solo
and group performances.
Hamlisch's music is unbeatable. As well as the
Chorus Line selections, the program featured
other selections by Hamlisch ("The Way We
Were," "Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows"), as
well as some excellent selections from Gershwin's
Porgy and Bess and some ragtime pieces by Scott
Joplin. The program alternated between these
composers, offering both melodic and thematic
continuity.
Audience reaction was ecstatic. The Oakland
Symphony Orchestra is to be commended for de
monstrating the flexibility and foresight to put
together such a high quality program with wide
audience appeal. Such performances portend
great success for its more conventional classical
programs.
