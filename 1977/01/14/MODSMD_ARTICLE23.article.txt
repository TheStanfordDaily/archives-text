## Stanford downs USC, 68-64 Maples Madness is back 
### Chris Baker 
Just when USC looked like it
was on the verge of winning its
first conference basketball game
since 1975, Stanford responded
with an inspired four minutes of
basketball to extend the Trojans'
conference losing streak to 18
games with a 6H-64 victory last
night at Maples.
"We played the last four mi
nutes about as bad as we can
play," said USC coach Bob Boyd.
Bad isn't a strong enough ad
jective to describe the Trojans'
performance down the stretch.
Easy shot
Trojan forward Doug
Widtfeldt had an easy 10-footer
hit the right corner edge of the
backboard and carom into the
hands of freshman forward kim
berly Belton who threw a
length-of-the-court pass to guard
Daryle Morgan for an easy lay in.
Morgan's lay up iced the game
for the Cards at 64-60 and the
5244 fans went mad — Maples
madness.
Stanford outscored the Tro
jans 8-4 in the final three mi
nutes, using a four-corner of
fense designed to get the Cards
good shots — meaning lay-ins.
And that's exactly what the
Cardinals got — easy lay-ins.
First Mike Bratz, who was the
game's leading scorer with 21
points, got a gift to make it 62-60
with 1:43 left. But what brought
the house down was Morgan's
lay-in.
Stall offense
Dißiaso said of the stall of
fense, "We felt we had the time
outs in our advantage. We were
going to take nothing but a lay
up.
"I told them, 'We're not play
ing the other team, we're playing
the clock.' Belton went in and

made things happen."
I'he freshman from New York
played most of the second half
with four fouls and didn't ease
up any. "Flaying with four fouls
you can't ease up," said Dißiaso.
"When the whistle blew I was
hoping. 1 had my fingers cros
sed."
Final three minutes
But he summed it up saying,
"It got down to the final three
minutes. The ball dropped for
us; it didn't for them. We missed
a lot of shots earlier, but we made
them at the end."
Forward Cleve Porter hit a 14-
foot jumper to cut the Cards' lead
to two points — 64-62, but it was
all over for SC. Stanford went
into their four-corner offense
again and USC had to foul to get
the ball back. Bratz hit two free
throws with 47 seconds left to
put it out of reach at 66-62.
"Except for the last four mi
nutes I thought we played good
defense," said Boyd. "Give
Dick's team credit for coming
back after being down six to
eight points.
No reason
"But everybody's been doing
that to us. 1 should be impressed
but I have seen it before. I don't
know what to say. Perhaps it's
our youth or fatigue . . . maybe
it's because we are losing."
The lead changed hands in the
first half almost as fast as the of
ficials called fouls on Stanford.
The Cards were caught 11 times
in the first half and three starters
— Belton, Bratz and center Tom
Schmalzried all had three fouls.
The Trojans took a 31-28
halftime lead, as Stanford com
mitted 12 turnovers. Many fans
were grateful that the rulesmak
ers decided to make each half 20
minutes long. There were a

couple of three minute periods
where neither team could score
any points and it wasn't because
of great defense.
Turnovers
Stanford turned the ball over
12 times in the first half, while
USC gave it away 10 times. It was
obviously in the half why both
teams were 0-2 in conference
play.
Dißiaso felt his bench was the
deciding factor. "I thought it was
significant that we played in foul
trouble the overwhelming
majority of the game. We got a
great deal off the bench."
Dohrmann, Morgan, Giovac
chini and Fitznerall made a real
contribution. I'm sure that's the
most pressure Daryle Morgan's
ever been under. He's a walk
on."
"We got a great performance
from our bench. That was really
the difference for us."
UCLA
The Cards must play a much
better game if they even hope to
stay in the running with 12th
ranked UCLA tomorrow night.
The Bruins got a 34-point per
formance from forward David
Greenwood to lead them to an
82-74 victory over California last
night. Ail-American forward
Marques Johnson had 20 points
for the Bruins.
"I know they (UCLA) like to
play at our place," said Dißiaso.
"I hope we'll be able to control
the tempo of the game."

Last year the Bruins blew
Stanford out of Maples. 120-74
The Cardinals were never even
in that contest. The Cards have
only beaten UCLA once in
Maples.
In other Pac-8 action last
night. Oregon State got a 61-58
conference victory over
Washington State in Corvallis,
Ore. Rocky Smith, who led ill
scorers with 22 points, hit the
winning bucket for the Beavers
with 3:15 left in the game.
