# Stanford women host Chico State
## 
### Dean Eyre 
The undefeated Stanford wo
men's basketball team continues
season play with two games over
this weekend. The Cards play
Chico State tonight at 7 p.m. and
then take on UC-Davis tomorrow
at 5:15. Both games will be held
in Maples Pavillion, the latter
game serving as the first of a
doubleheader, preceding the
men's match-up against UCLA.
The Card women played their
last three games over a month
ago in the Stanislaus State Tour
nament, claiming victories over
De Anza, 59-55; Stanislaus State,
67-54; and Pacific, 48-35. These
wins plus the win over Santa
Clara in the season opener give
the team a perfect 4-0 record.
Commenting on the effect of
the lay-off, coach Dotty McCrea
said, "The month off hurt us, but
the girls stayed in shape."
One problem with missing
competition for such a length of
time is that injuries occur as
pressure is put back on the team.
The key casualty of the new year
is juniur center Maggie Nelson
who suffered a sprained ankle.
"With or without Maggie we
will play our best," explained
McCrea. "I'm very optimistic.
We'll be hurting without Maggie
playing full strength." she said.
Going into this weekend's ac
tion, McCrea noted, "The team is
confident in their play. They
have started to have their efforts

rewarded. It makes me feel bet
ter. I think we'll give everybody
a run for their money."
The Cards scrimmaged a
men's recreational team to get
practice in game-type situations.
"We were beat badly in the
scrimmage," McCrea said.
"They know what they're going
up against."
The game helped to give
everybody, especially those who
didn't have much actual playing
time, experience in making
plays and setting up formations.
Practice sessions have helped
produce much depthon theteam.
McCrea doesn't set a starting
team for a game, but rather plays
the team members according to
how they are performing.
"Practice looks excellent. We
have really come a long way, and
should be able to go to the bench
a little more," said McCrea.
Three players who have
looked especially good both in
game and practice situations are
Betsy Lough, Nancy Lovvold
and Ruth Montague. Montague
filled in for Stephanie Galef,
who was out with an illness, but
is now ready to return to action.
McCrea said that the Chico
State game is the first single
game of the season, the previous
games being either part of a
doubleheader or a tournament.
She hoped for spectator support
because of the hard work the
team has put in this year.

Commenting on the effect of
the lay-off, coach Dotty McCrea
said, "The month off hurt us, but
the girls stayed in shape."
One problem with missing
competition for such a length of
time is that injuries occur as
pressure is put back on the team.
The key casualty of the new year
is juniur center Maggie Nelson
who suffered a sprained ankle.
"With or without Maggie we
will play our best," explained
McCrea. "I'm very optimistic.
We'll be hurting without Maggie
playing full strength." she said.
Going into this weekend's ac
tion, McCrea noted, "The team is
confident in their play. They
have started to have their efforts

rewarded. It makes me feel bet
ter. I think we'll give everybody
a run for their money."
The Cards scrimmaged a
men's recreational team to get
practice in game-type situations.
"We were beat badly in the
scrimmage," McCrea said.
"They know what they're going
up against."
The game helped to give
everybody, especially those who
didn't have much actual playing
time, experience in making
plays and setting up formations.
Practice sessions have helped
produce much depthon theteam.
McCrea doesn't set a starting
team for a game, but rather plays
the team members according to
how they are performing.
"Practice looks excellent. We
have really come a long way, and
should be able to go to the bench
a little more," said McCrea.
Three players who have
looked especially good both in
game and practice situations are
Betsy Lough, Nancy Lovvold
and Ruth Montague. Montague
filled in for Stephanie Galef,
who was out with an illness, but
is now ready to return to action.
McCrea said that the Chico
State game is the first single
game of the season, the previous
games being either part of a
doubleheader or a tournament.
She hoped for spectator support
because of the hard work the
team has put in this year.
The undefeated Stanford wo
men's basketball team continues
season play with two games over
this weekend. The Cards play
Chico State tonight at 7 p.m. and
then take on UC-Davis tomorrow
at 5:15. Both games will be held
in Maples Pavillion, the latter
game serving as the first of a
doubleheader, preceding the
men's match-up against UCLA.
The Card women played their
last three games over a month
ago in the Stanislaus State Tour
nament, claiming victories over
De Anza, 59-55; Stanislaus State,
67-54; and Pacific, 48-35. These
wins plus the win over Santa
Clara in the season opener give
the team a perfect 4-0 record.
