### Jill Lieber 
National swimming pow
erhouse Indiana University
heads a field of 13 teams entered
in Saturday's Stanford Invita
tional Relays. The meet, com
prised of alternate men's and
women's events, begins at 1 p.m.
at the deGuerre Fools.
Highlighting the meet will be
Olympic 100 meter gold
medalist Jim Montgomery.
Montgomery was the first
human to break the 50 second
barrier for the 100 meter.
Montgomery set the record of
49.99 in swimming to a first
place finish in Montreal only to
Tiave his record barely beaten by
Alabama's Jonty Skinner almost
a month later.
Montgomery will feel right at
home on the Stanford campus as
three of his U.S. teammates, Mike
Bruner and Paul Hartloff, along
with Cal's Peter Rocca. will also
be competing.
Coach Jim Gaughran ranks the
Hoosiers second nationally be
hind USC. Assistant coach De
bbie Meyer said, "Indiana has
always been known for its sprin
ters. 1 expect some good swims."
Other teams entered in the Re
lays are California. University of
the Pacific, Foothill, Arden
Hills, the Foxcatchers Swim
Club from Pennsylvania, Santa
Clara, Concord and Ladera Oaks.
"We've been working long
and hard and the kids will have
Friday morning off—they need a
break," Meyer said. "YVe'll do
quality work Friday afternoon.
They've got to have a mental
loosening up."
Usually the Card women have
trouble against AAIJ clubs, as
the AAU girls are younger and
able to devote much more time to
swimming.

"I think we'll fair pretty well,"
Meyer said. "The top AAU
swimmers will be in the
Northern-Southern California
duel meet on Sunday and there
fore will not take part in the Re
lays."
Meyer said she plans on see
ing good swims from the sprin
ters this weekend.
"I'd like the sprinters to show
me what they can do. We're on a
super sprint program now.
We've been starting a heavier
weight program and their
shoulders will feel tired. But we
started to decrease yardage on
Wednesday to get them mentally
prepared for the meet."
One person to watch Saturday
is frosh Tom O'Brien, a middle
distance freestyler from Seattle,

Wash. O'Brien is a high school
All-American in the 200 and 500

weight program and their
shoulders will feel tired. But we
started to decrease yardage on
Wednesday to get them mentally
prepared for the meet."
