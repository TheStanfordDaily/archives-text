# Adequate foreign language
## Study shows frosh well prepared 
### Cynthia Neil 
In response to a proposal by the Fa
culty Senate to study the language
program here, the Admissions Office
has released a study which indicates
that most students enter the university
with a good foreign language
background.
A total of 98 per cent of this year's
entering class has studied a foreign
language for at least two years. Of
these, 35 percent have studied a
foreign language for three years and 27
per cent for four years.
"Secondary schools are keenly
aware of just how much emphasis we
place upon a very strong college pre
paratory program," Fred Hargadon,
dean of admissions, said.
Among the most popular foreign
languages for this year's freshman
class are French and Spanish. French
was taken by 651 students and Spanish
by 615. Other enrollments were: Ger
man, 260; Latin, 194; Russian, 35;
Japanese, 16; Chinese, 7; Hebrew, 5;
Greek, 3; Italian, 3, and Arabic, 1.
Influence on curriculum reduced
Although Hargadon favors further
discussion on ways the university can
induce its students to study foreign
languages, he said he doubts that ad
missions requirements would rein
force strong and challenging language
programs in secondary schools.
"The influence which prestigious
and highly selective colleges and uni
versities once exercised over secon
dary school curricula has been consid
erably diminished in recent years, for
reasons beyond our control," Harga
don said.
"I am not familiar with the history of
the adoption of specific admissions
requirements by colleges, but I would
hazard the guess that most such re
quirements were adopted for the pur
pose of guaranteeing minimal levels of
preparation for entering students

rather than for the purpose of influenc
ing high school curricula for everyone,
everywhere," he said.
He added that the "adoption of such
requirements undoubtedly had this
latter effect, but I don't think that was
its original purpose.
College-prep requirement
"As time went on, many of the most
selective colleges either dropped, or
kept but ignored, a number of specific
subject matter requirements, largely
because all such requirements eventu
ally were incorporated into the major
ity of secondary school college pre
paratory programs, thus becoming re
quirements for graduation from such

programs.
"And it was from the graduates of
such programs that the selective col
leges drew — and continue to draw —
most of their applicants for admission.
In that sense, most specific require
ments for admission to these colleges
became redundant," he said.
"Moreover, their (requirements')
existence came to serve little purpose,
save to discourage applications from
quite able students who, because of
circumstances beyond their control
(e.g., finding themselves in extremely
small, rural, public high schools),
were unable to meet those require
ments."


Hardy says goodbye
United Stanford Employees (USE) President Roger Hardy resigned Wed
nesday morning. His successor has not yet been named. Hardy, a Stan
ford graduate and veteran USE officer, took over the union last summer
when former President Jim Berk resigned.

discussion on ways the university can
induce its students to study foreign
languages, he said he doubts that ad
missions requirements would rein
force strong and challenging language
programs in secondary schools.
"The influence which prestigious
and highly selective colleges and uni
versities once exercised over secon
dary school curricula has been consid
erably diminished in recent years, for
reasons beyond our control," Harga
don said.
"I am not familiar with the history of
the adoption of specific admissions
requirements by colleges, but I would
hazard the guess that most such re
quirements were adopted for the pur
pose of guaranteeing minimal levels of
preparation for entering students

rather than for the purpose of influenc
ing high school curricula for everyone,
everywhere," he said.
He added that the "adoption of such
requirements undoubtedly had this
latter effect, but I don't think that was
its original purpose.
College-prep requirement
"As time went on, many of the most
selective colleges either dropped, or
kept but ignored, a number of specific
subject matter requirements, largely
because all such requirements eventu
ally were incorporated into the major
ity of secondary school college pre
paratory programs, thus becoming re
quirements for graduation from such

programs.
"And it was from the graduates of
such programs that the selective col
leges drew — and continue to draw —
most of their applicants for admission.
In that sense, most specific require
ments for admission to these colleges
became redundant," he said.
"Moreover, their (requirements')
existence came to serve little purpose,
save to discourage applications from
quite able students who, because of
circumstances beyond their control
(e.g., finding themselves in extremely
small, rural, public high schools),
were unable to meet those require
ments."


Hardy says goodbye
United Stanford Employees (USE) President Roger Hardy resigned Wed
nesday morning. His successor has not yet been named. Hardy, a Stan
ford graduate and veteran USE officer, took over the union last summer
when former President Jim Berk resigned.
In response to a proposal by the Fa
culty Senate to study the language
program here, the Admissions Office
has released a study which indicates
that most students enter the university
with a good foreign language
background.
A total of 98 per cent of this year's
entering class has studied a foreign
language for at least two years. Of
these, 35 percent have studied a
foreign language for three years and 27
per cent for four years.
"Secondary schools are keenly
aware of just how much emphasis we
place upon a very strong college pre
paratory program," Fred Hargadon,
dean of admissions, said.
Among the most popular foreign
languages for this year's freshman
class are French and Spanish. French
was taken by 651 students and Spanish
by 615. Other enrollments were: Ger
man, 260; Latin, 194; Russian, 35;
Japanese, 16; Chinese, 7; Hebrew, 5;
Greek, 3; Italian, 3, and Arabic, 1.
Influence on curriculum reduced

discussion on ways the university can
induce its students to study foreign
languages, he said he doubts that ad
missions requirements would rein
force strong and challenging language
programs in secondary schools.
