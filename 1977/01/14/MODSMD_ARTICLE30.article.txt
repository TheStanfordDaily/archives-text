# Dominance in intramurals
## Wasted Parrots go for 'B' league crown 
### Bill Wernecke 
Sometimes an athletic team, by its
sheer dominance of a given sport,
gains a certain mystique that far trans
cends the world of organized sports.
Examples of this are few but notable.
There were Lombardi's Green Bay
Packers, the Boston Celtics of Auer
bach and Russell and John Wooden's
UCLA Bruins. Now, how aver, another
team stands on the brink of attaining
that legendary status: the Wasted Par
rots.
The Wasted Parrots? Well, they have
become something of a legend in Stan
ford intramural 'B'basketball competi
tion. Twice the Parrots have swept
through their five league games in de
vastating fashion, both times earning
the top seeding for the playoffs. And
twice the Parrots have gone down to
ignominious defeat in theearly rounds
of the playoffs, bringing toa premature
end their dreams of IM glory.
Post-game wrap-up
The story of the Wasted Parrots dates
back over two years, to a group of
freshmen living in Loro House in Flor
ence Moore Hall. Loro is the Spanish
word for parrot, and given the team's
propensity for all-night partying fol
lowing its victories, the nickname
Wasted Parrots was coined. Indeed,
the Parrots consider their post-game
activities to be an integral part of their
i\4

An account of the Parrots' two-year
quest for the 'B' basketball champion
ship ranks with the exploits of Seek
and Destroy and the Zete football
squads in IM annals. As freshmen, the
Parrots swept through their league
undefeated (and unscored upon, ac
cording to historian Charlie Ahn), and
were rewarded with the number one
seeding for the playoffs.
After easily winning their first
playoff game, the Parrots came up flat
in their second contest, and cold out
side shooting spelled a close defeat to a
IRA outfit. Cries of "wait 'til next year"
echoed among thv Parrot faithful.
Let's try that again
The second try proved to be even
more traumatic. Once again, the Par
rots stormed through their regular sea
son undefeated (including a big win
over the Delts), and retained the top
seeding. The first playoff game
matched them against Arroyo, an ex
cellent team which was unseeded due
solely to a loss sustained when several
players were missing.
Disaster struck the Wasted Parrots
on the eve of the playoff contest. Top
scorer Bill Kellar sprained his ankle in
practice and was unable to play. Down
to five men, the Parrots had to bring
back their former RA Rob Quick from
the injured reserve list.
The game itself was a classic. Due
principallv to the efforts of lack Mol

ler, the Parrots led by 10 at the half.
Then forward David Georgette got
hurt, leaving the Parrots with only four
healthy players. Arroyo came back to
tie the score on a free throw with no
time remaining.
The game went to two overtimes,
when Moller finally fouled out on a
questionable call. Arroyo pulled out
the game 6.1-62 on a three-point play,
and went on to win the rest of its
playoff games to become 'B' basketball
champions.
Memories
The memory of that loss still haunts
the Wasted Parrots.
"Arroyo was a great team." recalls
Parrot Aamir Farid. "but with kellar I
know we would have won that game."
Kellar puts it even better. "We really
want that 'B' title," he says. "Every day
I walk past that picture of Arroyo down
at the IM office and it makes my
stomach turn."
For this season the Wasted Parrots'
headquarters is in Manzanita 9Y, in
close proximity to an outdoor basket
ball court. On one wall of the living
room hangs a picture of the team's
mascot — a toucan with a can of Bud
weiser in one wing and a joint in the
other, looking as if he lives on the
fourth floor of Wilbur Hall.
Hey, Rubha
New recruits have been added this
year to counteract the injurv problem

and to insure the team's survival after
the departure of the founding mem
bers. General manager Kellar has re
portedly signed Brent "Bubba" Saylor,
an offensive lineman on the football
team, and says that all former Parrots
have signed their 1977 contracts.
The team did look awfully impres
sive in its league opener last Sunday,
ironically against a new Arroyo team.
Despite having only four players in the
final five minutes due to a football
meeting, the Parrots managed to waste
Arroyo 63-39.
Asked about their title chances this
year, the Parrots seem afraid to be
jinxed with the role of preseason favo
rite.
They are excited, though, at the
prospect of building a dynasty.
"The basketball team is just the flag
ship of our growing world-wide em
pire," according to Georgette. The Par
rots have made the football playoffs for
the last two years and claim that their
softball team this spring will be awe
some.
Georgette quickly adds, however,
that "we're not like IRA. They just get
together to compete athletically. . .
As implied in their name, the Wasted
Parrots are much more than an athletic
outfit. As Kellar has said, "thebest part
of our names is aftrr the names."
