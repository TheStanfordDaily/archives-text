# Shades of glory
## George Schader: gone but not forgotten 
### Gary Sprague 
It would be a good subject for a Nor
man Rockwell painting. Star athlete sits
on the bench in street clothes gazing
wistfully at his teammates hurrying up
and down the court. His hands move
unconsciously to the knee injury which
prevents his suiting up. The title: Out
For The Season. For added pathos, note
that the figure is a senior.
For George Schader, the pain is only
too real.
The day after Thanksgiving last year,
Schader entered the hospital to have the
torn knee cartilage he had suffered a
week earlier removed. The operation
was successful and the doctors assured
him that he would fully recover. They
also assured him he wouldn't play this
year.
Happy ending
Happily for Schader, though, even
this gloomy scenario can have a happy
ending. Thanks to the NCAA's redshirt
policy of letting athletes sit out one sea
son without losing a year of athletic
eligibility, Schader will be able to play
next year as a fifth year senior. Quite
understandably, the redshirt rule has
mollified considerably the psychologi
cal effects of the injury. And in a per
verse bit of luck, Schader sustained his
injury before rather than midway
through the season, allowing him to
capitalize on the opportunity to red

shirt.
Despite the consolation of another
year of eligibility, the injury has been
keenly disappointing to Schader. A JC
Ail-American from Mt. San Antonio
College in 1975, Schader transferred to
Stanford last year looking forward to the
opportunity of playing Pacific-8 basket
ball. He quickly established himself as
one of Stanford's leading rebounders
and scorers. This year, Schader vowed,
was going to be the year.
Then the accident shot it all down.
"You could have scraped me off the
ground, I was so low," Schader said.
It was the type of freak accident you
wouldn't wish on anyone but a USC
player.
Lock, stock and barrel
"I was sitting watching TV with some
friends, Schader said. "When 1 got up
to get something to eat, the knee locked
on me. The leg swelled up. The trainer
threw around the possibility of torn or
floating cartilage."
Schader kept off the knee for four or
five days, waiting and watching for pos
sible developments. But the season
opener against Taiwan was coming up,
and the waiting made Schader restless.
"I wanted to press the issue,' he said.
During a drill, he cut hard and the
knee locked.
"The next thing I saw was the
ground," Schader said. "It took two or

three minutes to unlock."
The diagnosis was torn cartilage; the
solution was to remove it. But the cause
remained problemmatical. According to
the trainer, Schader said, the injury
could have happened years ago but
never caused complications. Since he
had never experienced pain in the knee
prior to the injury, Schader himself has
no idea when it actually happened.
Slow but sure
Schader rejoined the team for practice
Jan. 3. The knee, he said, is up to
about 75 per cent and his weight is still
under his listed 215. His primary con
sideration is to not force the recovery.
Schader's training regimen resembles
more that of a football lineman than that
of a basketball player. On the court too,
his aggressive, physical play has
likened him to a gridiron athlete. Last
year, Oregon coach Dick Harter implied
Schader's lack of finesse when he refer
red to the Stanford forward as "that
football player Schader."
References to football players aside,
the name of Schader's game is indeed
strength.
"I'm not a flash player," Schader said,
"but I make up for it with what I do have.
I emphasize fundamentals, and I'm
strong enough so they have to respect
my size."
Schader arrived at Stanford via the
Nevada-Las Vegas and Mt. SAC. He was

attracted by the opportunity to play
Pac-8 basketball and the lure of a Stan
ford degree. The difference in environ
ments between Stanford and the high
pitched basketball atmosphere of UNLV
was unsettling at first.
"When I first came," Schader said, "1
was blown away by the lack of social
activity and the apathy towards sports
on the part of students and administra
tion."
Schader was also dismayed at the
caliber of players he found on the Stan
ford team.
Dißiaso molds character
"Coming in last year I was sort of dis
appointed with the talent on the team.
But (Dißiaso) did a hell of a job with it."
Schader credits Dißiaso with enough
basketball miracles to start a personality
cult.
"Now there is more interest in sports
at Stanford, more enthusiasm for bas
ketball. With one or two good years, Di-
Biaso will get a good backing."
Schader is equally sanguine about the
fortunes of the team in Pac-8 play, again
attributing the difference to Dißasio.
"Last year, we had no right to be on
the court with some of those teams with
our personnel," Schader said. "We've
got it together this year. (Dißiaso) is
going to make Stanford into — not a
basketball school — but a school which
will be recognized for its basketball."
