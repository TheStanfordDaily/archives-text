Carter confers with foreign leaders
Washington — In a pre-inaugural flurry of
telephone summitry, President-elect Jimmy Car
ter talked to foreign leaders long-distance yes
terday and set up an economic summit meeting
of major non-Communist industrialized nations
in April.
The telephone calls, to President Valery Gis
card d'Estaing of France and Prime Ministers
Helmut Schmidt of Germany, James Callaghan
of Great Britain and Takeo Fukuda of Japan, in
terrupted a day of briefings by the Joint Chiefs of
Staff for the President-elect and his top national
security advisers.
A French spokesman declined to comment
when asked if Carter had spoken to Giscard d 'Es
taing about France's release of Abu Daoud, the
Palestinian terrorist accused of mastermindiing
the 1972 Olympics massacre in Munich. The
action had aroused criticism from the U.S. and a
subsequent response from France.
A Carter aide said the military chiefs outlined
the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the de
ployment and capabilities of U.S. forces around
the world.
Present for the briefings were Carter; Vice
President-elect Walter Mondale; Harold Brown,
incoming secretary of defense; Cyrus Vance, de
signated secretary of state, and Zbigniew
Brzezinski, Carter's national security adviser.
Soviet dissidents convicted
Vienna — The Soviet Union has convicted at
least 90 dissidents since signing the supposedly
liberating Helsinki accords in 1975 and is in
creasingly applying new techniques of political
persecution, Amnesty International said yester
day.
The Austrian section of the international
human rights organization said the techniques
include harassment of political prisoners, re
prisals against friends and relatives and false
criminal charges lodged in order to bring politi
cal cases into criminal courts.
The group's latest report said that in addition
to those convicted, at least 15 completely sane
persons have been examined in mental hospitals
or been declared insane and sent to institutions
since the Helsinki agreement was signed on
Aug. 1, 1975.
The accords, signed by President Gerald Ford
and the heads of 34 other nations, were a major
step in East-West detente. They ratified the
post-World War II boundaries of Europe, tacitly
recognizing Soviet control of Eastern Europe, in

exchange tor nonbinding promises of greater
civil liberties for Russians and East Europeans.
The Amnesty International report said the
Soviets maintain the convicted dissidents were
guilty of "anti-Soviet agitation and prop
aganda" and spreading slanderous information.
The human rights group said spectacular re
leases of Soviet dissidents such as that of Vla
dimir Bukosky could not change the fact that
hundreds of others, gravely ill, were still in jail
and thousands more were deprived of their free
dom, penalized or harassed because they exer
cised their constitutional rights of freedom of
opinion.
France defends Daoud release
Paris — The French government formally pro
tested yesterday against U.S. criticism of its re
lease of Palestinian leader Abu Daoud, accused
of masterminding the attack on Israeli athletes at
the 1972 Munich Olympics.
Daoud, in a telephone interview with the To
ronto Star from Al Fatah headquarters in Al
giers, claimed he played no part in the Munich
massacre. He said he expects Israeli agents will
try to assassinate him and he is ready "to die for
my cause."
The Palestinian revolutionary also claimed in
the interview that an officer who arrested him
last Friday was an Israeli secret agent.
In Tel Aviv, 11 French Jewish youths visiting
from France burned their P'rench identity cards
outside the French consulate in protest over
"French prostitution to terrorism." The youths,
wearing track suits and carrying placards with
the names of the 11 Israelis killed at Munich,
told reporters, "We are ashamed to be French."
The French Foreign Ministry summoned U.S.
Charge d'Affaires Samuel Gammon in Paris to
tell him that the criticism voiced by a State De
partment spokesman "constituted inadmissable
comment on the acts of French courts."
The French statement made no reference to
President-elect Jimmy Carter, who had said
Wednesday he was deeply disturbed and very
much surprised at the release of Daoud.
Commission hears gas proposals
Washington — The Federal Power Commis
sion (FPC) heard pleas yesterday for emergency
relief measures for pipelines short of natural gas.
Two members of the commission voiced sus
picions that emergency natural gas sales prop
osed by a Texas company to ease shortages
elsewhere could turn into a back-door deregula
tion of gas prices, against the present will of

Congress.
The Houston Pipe Line Co.. which is not
under FPC jurisdiction and price ceilings, had
sold emergency gas supplies for 60 days in
November and December to two interstate
pipelines subject to FPC regulation.
Then, Houston Pipe Line proposed additional
60-day sales to these pipelines, Trans Continen
tal Gas Pipe Line Corp (Transco) and United Gas
Pipe Line Co., but wants the commission to con
sider them as new sales rather than extensions of
the old sales — to make sure Houston Pipe does
not fall under federal regulation as an interstate
seller.
Richard Alsup, representing Houston Pipe
Line, said the firm might not be willing to make
the deal at all if it is considered an extension,
because of legal uncertainties in such an in
terpretation.
On that fine legal point, however, may rest the
fate of schools and industries in gas-short states,
especially North and South Carolina, heavily
dependent on Transco gas during the current
severe winter weather.
Ice jams U.S. rivers
New York — Ship and barge traffic moved at a
crawl or not at all yesterday in the ice-jammed
Great Lakes, the Mississippi and Ohio rivers and
on other waterways in the Midwest and East
usually navigable in January.
Lake Erie was almost completely frozen and
Lake Michigan stood a good chance of freezing
over for only the fourth time this century as
earlier-than-usual buildups of ice were reported.
Three barges, two of them carrying oil, were
stuck in ice or aground yesterday in the upper
Chesapeake Bay and unusually heavy ice was
blamed for an 18,000-gallon kerosene spill from
a Hudson River tanker-barge south of Albany,
N.Y.
The Coast Guard halted traffic along 20 miles
of the Mississippi yesterday morning near Cape
Girardeau, Mo., when a collapsing ice dam sepa
rated 11 barges from a towboat. At noon, eight
barges were back under tow, two were aground
and one was missing and believed sunk.
A coast guard spokesman in St. Louis said the
river would remain closed until the missing
barge was located.
Barge traffic was also slowed on the Ohio,
Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. On the
Ohio, the regional chief of the Army Corps of
Engineers, Col. Max Janairo, said ice was caus
ing trouble at locks and dams just below Mor

gantown, W. Va. He said ice was making it dif
ficult to close the locks.
Auditors to study Brown's office
Sacramento — The state auditor general got
the green light yesterday to find out how effec
tively Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. runs his office.
"We'll find out from gas receipts how much it
costs to operate the blue Plymouth," said John
Williams, the state's auditor general.
Gray Davis, Brown's chief of staff, corrected
that to "a blue Plymouth and a white Plymouth,"
and said in an interview that the office will
"fully cooperate."
He added, "The public is served when every
agency is open to public scrutiny."
But auditing the governor's office, which has a
$3.3 billion annual budget, was not always a
routine piece of busi ness for the Joint Legislative
Audit Committee which oversees the auditor
general.
This audit will be the first of a governor's
office since 1963. Assemblyman Vince Thomas,
the San Pedro Democrat who previously headed
the audit committee said former Gov. Ronald
Reagan wouldn't allow auditors in the office.
Thomas said his only recourse would have
been to seek court order, but he didn't want to
take it that far.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow with low
clouds or fog nights and mornings. Highs in the
50s. Lows in the mid 30s to mid 40s.
