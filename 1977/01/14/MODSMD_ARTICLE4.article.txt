# Treatment varies
## Cowell, Bridge battle suicides 
### George Anders 
Six months have passed since the
last student suicide here, but suicide is
hardly a dormant issue.
About 10 per cent of students here
have suicidal thoughts during the
year, David Dorosin, director of coun
seling and psychological services at
Cowell Student Health Center esti
mated.
Vincent D'Andrea, a Cowell
psychiatrist, said he treats about six
seriously suicidal students a year.
D'Andrea said two other Cowell
psychiatrists treat a similar number
per year.
Few students do kill themselves. An
average year will have one or two stu
dent suicides, Dorosin said. "If some
one really wants to kill himself we
can't stop him," he noted. "But there's
always a hope somebody will save
him."

Treatment at Cowell varies, depend
ing on the factors which make a stu
dent suicidal, D'Andrea said. Most stu
dents who attempt suicide do so as a
cry for help, he explained. These stu
dents make "an angry, desperate at
tempt to get somebody else to do some
thing,"
Treatment then involves finding
ways for the person to either get what
he wants or cope without it, D'Andrea
explained.
Occasionally, a student is consider
ing suicide "just for thrills," he said. A
third type is the student with a history
of deep depression and difficult rela
tionships. "Those need a lot more at
tention," he said. "They often take
medical leave and go home."
D'Andrea said with these students,
he begins by establishing a contract
that commits the student to staying
alive. Often, these students have built

up a "death kit" containing pills or
weapons. D'Andrea said he has stu
dents surrender their "kits" thereby
protecting the students from compul
sively using them.
The Bridge, a peer counseling prog
ram here, receives a few phone calls
from "highly lethal" students who
have already planned out their
suicides. Bridge coordinator Don Gal
lagher said. The Bridge more often re
ceives calls from those merely think
ing about suicide, he said.
For "lethal" calls, Bridge sfaffers
first find out if a suicide attempt is
underway, Gallagher said. If so, staf
fers contact police. If not, staffers con
tinue talking to the caller, offering
immediate support to get the student
past that particular suicidal moment.
Callers are usually then referred to
Cowell, Gallagher said, but he main
tained that "providing that support is
the most important thing a person on a
crisis line can do."
Other suicidal students begin treat
ment at Cowell either by appointment
or when Cowell staffers are called into
emergency rooms following attempted
suicides by the students, D'Andrea
said.
Suicide patterns here differ little
from those across the country. Dorosin
said. "It was thought that high expec
tancy universities like Stanford had
high rates of suicide," he said. "But
current evidence does not support
that."
Academic pressures may be men
tioned by a suicidal student who feels
nothing is going well for him, Dorosin
added. "But it's more common for us to
see people because of a disruption in
their personal life than because they
got a 'B' in chemistry."
Tough for frosh
Gallagher said, however, that
"Freshmen experience the loss of a lot
of support systems. For a while they
don't have any real close friends. The
absence of that kind of support makes
them experience any given problem
much more intensely."
Of those students who did kill them
selves, about half never came to Cow
ell for treatment, Dorosin said.
"There are always people you can't
reach," D'Andrea remarked. "We try to
make our services available, but the
ultimate decision is in the hands of the
other (suicidal) person," Dorosin ad
ded.
Drug overdoses were the most com
mon means of suicide here between
1960 and 1974, Dorosin said, with
jumping from heights ranking second.
If a student living in a dorm suc
ceeds in his suicide attempt, members
of the Cowell counseling and
psychological services branch will
offer to meet with dorm members, said
Dorosin.
Dorm members "usually take us
up," he said. "The biggest concern is,
'What could we have done diffe
rently?' But there's also some anger,
'Why did he do this to us?' It's a com
plex of feelings."

Occasionally, a student is consider
ing suicide "just for thrills," he said. A
third type is the student with a history
of deep depression and difficult rela
tionships. "Those need a lot more at
tention," he said. "They often take
medical leave and go home."
D'Andrea said with these students,
he begins by establishing a contract
that commits the student to staying
alive. Often, these students have built

up a "death kit" containing pills or
weapons. D'Andrea said he has stu
dents surrender their "kits" thereby
protecting the students from compul
sively using them.
The Bridge, a peer counseling prog
ram here, receives a few phone calls
from "highly lethal" students who
have already planned out their
suicides. Bridge coordinator Don Gal
lagher said. The Bridge more often re
ceives calls from those merely think
ing about suicide, he said.
For "lethal" calls, Bridge sfaffers
first find out if a suicide attempt is
underway, Gallagher said. If so, staf
fers contact police. If not, staffers con
tinue talking to the caller, offering
immediate support to get the student
past that particular suicidal moment.
Callers are usually then referred to
Cowell, Gallagher said, but he main
tained that "providing that support is
the most important thing a person on a
crisis line can do."
Other suicidal students begin treat
ment at Cowell either by appointment
or when Cowell staffers are called into
emergency rooms following attempted
suicides by the students, D'Andrea
said.
Suicide patterns here differ little
from those across the country. Dorosin
said. "It was thought that high expec
tancy universities like Stanford had
high rates of suicide," he said. "But
current evidence does not support
that."
Academic pressures may be men
tioned by a suicidal student who feels
nothing is going well for him, Dorosin
added. "But it's more common for us to
see people because of a disruption in
their personal life than because they
got a 'B' in chemistry."
Tough for frosh
Gallagher said, however, that
"Freshmen experience the loss of a lot
of support systems. For a while they
don't have any real close friends. The
absence of that kind of support makes
them experience any given problem
much more intensely."
Of those students who did kill them
selves, about half never came to Cow
ell for treatment, Dorosin said.
"There are always people you can't
reach," D'Andrea remarked. "We try to
make our services available, but the
ultimate decision is in the hands of the
other (suicidal) person," Dorosin ad
ded.
Drug overdoses were the most com
mon means of suicide here between
1960 and 1974, Dorosin said, with
jumping from heights ranking second.
If a student living in a dorm suc
ceeds in his suicide attempt, members
of the Cowell counseling and
psychological services branch will
offer to meet with dorm members, said
Dorosin.
Dorm members "usually take us
up," he said. "The biggest concern is,
'What could we have done diffe
rently?' But there's also some anger,
'Why did he do this to us?' It's a com
plex of feelings."
Six months have passed since the
last student suicide here, but suicide is
hardly a dormant issue.
About 10 per cent of students here
have suicidal thoughts during the
year, David Dorosin, director of coun
seling and psychological services at
Cowell Student Health Center esti
mated.
Vincent D'Andrea, a Cowell
psychiatrist, said he treats about six
seriously suicidal students a year.
D'Andrea said two other Cowell
psychiatrists treat a similar number
per year.
Few students do kill themselves. An
average year will have one or two stu
dent suicides, Dorosin said. "If some
one really wants to kill himself we
can't stop him," he noted. "But there's
always a hope somebody will save
him."

Treatment at Cowell varies, depend
ing on the factors which make a stu
dent suicidal, D'Andrea said. Most stu
dents who attempt suicide do so as a
cry for help, he explained. These stu
dents make "an angry, desperate at
tempt to get somebody else to do some
thing,"
Treatment then involves finding
ways for the person to either get what
he wants or cope without it, D'Andrea
explained.
