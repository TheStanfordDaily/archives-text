# Treatment varies
## Cowell, Bridge battle suicides 
### George Anders 
Six months have passed since the
last student suicide here, but suicide is
hardly a dormant issue.
About 10 per cent of students here
have suicidal thoughts during the
year, David Dorosin, director of coun
seling and psychological services at
Cowell Student Health Center esti
mated.
Vincent D'Andrea, a Cowell
psychiatrist, said he treats about six
seriously suicidal students a year.
D'Andrea said two other Cowell
psychiatrists treat a similar number
per year.
Few students do kill themselves. An
average year will have one or two stu
dent suicides, Dorosin said. "If some
one really wants to kill himself we
can't stop him," he noted. "But there's
always a hope somebody will save
him."

Treatment at Cowell varies, depend
ing on the factors which make a stu
dent suicidal, D'Andrea said. Most stu
dents who attempt suicide do so as a
cry for help, he explained. These stu
dents make "an angry, desperate at
tempt to get somebody else to do some
thing,"
Treatment then involves finding
ways for the person to either get what
he wants or cope without it, D'Andrea
explained.
Occasionally, a student is consider
ing suicide "just for thrills," he said. A
third type is the student with a history
of deep depression and difficult rela
tionships. "Those need a lot more at
tention," he said. "They often take
medical leave and go home."
D'Andrea said with these students,
he begins by establishing a contract
that commits the student to staying
alive. Often, these students have built

up a "death kit" containing pills or
weapons. D'Andrea said he has stu
dents surrender their "kits" thereby
protecting the students from compul
sively using them.
The Bridge, a peer counseling prog
ram here, receives a few phone calls
from "highly lethal" students who
have already planned out their
suicides. Bridge coordinator Don Gal
lagher said. The Bridge more often re
ceives calls from those merely think
ing about suicide, he said.
For "lethal" calls, Bridge sfaffers
first find out if a suicide attempt is
underway, Gallagher said. If so, staf
fers contact police. If not, staffers con
tinue talking to the caller, offering
immediate support to get the student
past that particular suicidal moment.
Callers are usually then referred to
Cowell, Gallagher said, but he main
