# Hardy leaves USE post; says decision was personal

### Pan Demetrakakes 
Citing "work-related personal
reasons," Roger Hardy resigned as
president of the United Stanford
Employees (USE) union Wednesday
morning.
"1 was unable to cope with that job
(as union president) and my Stanford
job at the same time," Hardy said.
Hardy, who received no pay for his
duties as president, has worked full
time as a Plant Services stage techni
cian during his presidency.
Asst. President Willam Reynolds is
now acting president of the union, the
third time he has held that post.
USE's executive committee will de
cide whether to hold a special election
for president at its next meeting, Jan.
26. However, USE Reporter Glenda
Jones said, "I think that if a special
election were going to be called, we
would have already done it."
The next regular election of union

officers is scheduled for April.
Hardy became president of the
union last June, three months before
the expiration of the old USE
university contract. He supervised the
negotiation of a new three-year con
tract, which was signed Oct. 27.
John Leung, shop steward for Plant
Services, said: "The workers here feel
that Roger had a difficult job and car
ried the union through a difficult time,
and that it was time for him to end his
personal sacrifice."
Staff Counsel for Employe Relations
Douglas Barton, who served as the
university's chief negotiator during
the contract bargaining, said Hardy
"comported himself with integrity in
dealing with the university, and the
university respects him for that."
Hardy's resignation came as a gen
eral surprise. Although some union
members are dissatisfied with the con
tract, which passed by 17 votes out of
717, this dissatisfaction probably did
not play a part in the resignation.
"I imagine there are people who are
not unhappy about my resignation, but
it was my own idea," Hardy said.
The resignation will probably start a
debate in USE as to whether the presi
dent should be paid. Hardy recently
proposed an amendment to the un
ion's constitution to that effect.
"One thing the union has to do is to
provide a situation where the presi
dent can work for the union full-time,"
Hardy said.
Former USE President Jim Berk,
whom Hardy had replaced, disagreed
with that view.
"What Roger's trying to focus on is
the executive aspect of the job—
signing papers, and soon—as opposed
to being a rank-and-file peson," Berk
said.
Hardy, a Stanford graduate, had

served as organizer and as reporter for
the union before becoming president.
Hardy mentioned several possible
candidates for president, including
Berk, Reynolds, and group representa
tives Damir Ibrisimovic and William
Dawson.
Berk declined to say whether he
would run for president. "I just can't
say," he said.
Ibrisimovic, who served on USE's
bargaining team during the contract
negotiotions, said he does not plan to
run for president—even though "a
couple of people have asked me".
Reynolds said, "I'm not running,
and you can print that."
