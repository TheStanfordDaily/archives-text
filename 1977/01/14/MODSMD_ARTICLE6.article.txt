Proposed changes in federal policies
for reimbursing university research
expenses could cost the university $2
to $4 million annually, according to
Vice Provost for Research William
Massy.
Massy explained that in the past, the
university has had full reimbursement
to offset its sponsored research costs.
Federal reimbursement here trans
lated to approximately $67 million
this year, he said.
The university's ability to recover a
portion of departmental administra
tion, student service and library costs
as indirect expenses, however, is a
central issue in present Congressional
discussions, Massy indicated.
Congress has questioned "the basic
pattern of ground rules we've learned
to live with," Massy said.
The general question underlying
Congressional discussions is whether
research should be viewed as an integ
ral part of education or simply as one
of its by-products. Massy explained.
This issue may receive its first major
public hearing at Congressional hear
ings on authorization for funding the
National Science Foundation later this
month, he said.
"There's absolutely no question
costs should be minimized," Massy
told the Faculty Senate last week. "The
question is who should pay," he said.
Massy explained that departure
from the full reimbursement policy on
research costs would mean shifting a
portion of these expenses to student
tuition, endowment or other income
sources.
The university is working through
the Association of American Univer
sities and the National Association of
College and University Business Of
ficers to oppose the proposed federal
changes, Massy said. He described the
problem in the end as "moderately
serious, but no cause for panic."
