## Opinions Graduate student problems require study, action 
### 
Jennings, Hoft

This is the first of a series of col
umns on the problems of the graduate
student at Stanford. There has tradi
tionally been little public discussion
of issues concerning graduates and yet
one encounters widespread dissatis
faction with the lack of social activities
and other services directed towards
the graduate community.
For example, no general university
orientation exists for graduate stu
dents; hence most graduates remain
unaware of the many possibilities for
extracurricular involvement at Stan
ford.
For example, there is no graduate
student lounge where graduates can
meet informally with students from
other departments. Such a center
could provide a focus for graduate stu
dents with common interests to de
velop friendships and initiate ac
tivities beyond the confines of their
own departments or schools.
No association
For example, there is no general
graduate students' association at Stan
ford which could organize social
events such as the successful Graduate
Weekend last fall, encourage the for
mation of interdisciplinary discussion
seminars and offer a strong voice in
support of the interests of the graduate
community, etc.
For example, except in a few specific
departments, there is little help avail
able for the teaching assistant who
wants to improve his/her teaching
skills.
For example, the real levels of uni
versity financial support in the School
of Humanities and Science for
graduate fellows, teaching assistants
(TAs) and research assistants (RAs)
have been allowed to erode over the
past five years to the point where pre
sent stipends are inadequate — and

there has been little regard to the pos
sible consequences of this neglect.
And even when a proposed solution
did come before the Faculty Senate last
year, it was almost universally viewed
as a money-saving measure.
Marriage problems
For example, many graduate mar
riages suffer due to the alienation of
student spouses from Stanford life.
Were spouses more able to share in the
educational and academic resources of
this community — e.g., by taking
courses on a part-time per-unit basis —
the academic life of married students
would be much less susceptible to dis
ruption by domestic problems.
For example, student parents —
especially the oft-ignored single pa
rent — have a hard time juggling day
time child care and academic respon
sibilities. More adequate and
reasonably-priced day-care facilities
on the Stanford campus would allow a
greater concentration on educational
matters than is presently possible for
these students.
For example, the possible living ar
rangements for on-campus graduate
students are extremely limited.
Neither Escondido Village nor
Crothers Halls offer any real commun
ity for single graduate students, and to
live off-campus is to isolate oneself
even further from one's fellows and
campus activities.
Alternatives exist
The variety of undergraduate hous
ing arrangements demonstrates that
many alternative possibilities do exist
— theme houses, cooperative living
situations (especially for those with
children), etc. — which are not pre
sently open to most graduate students.
For example, the services offered by
the ASSU have traditionally ignored
the special needs of graduate students,

because so few graduates involve
themselves in ASSU functions. The
graduates' disinterest — in turn — is
largely due to the ASSU's lack of atten
tion.
These and many other problems il
lustrate the need for an assessment of
the quality of graduate student life at
Stanford. There are a few organiza
tions (notably the 1-Center and the Es
condido Village Council) actively
concerned with the non-academic
needs of graduate students on this
campus, but much more student
initiated action must occur if any real
progress is to be made.
(Deric Jennings, an ASSU vice presi
dent, is a graduate student in
economics. Hick Hoft, an ASSU
senator, is a first-year medical stu
dent.)
