# Affirmative action necessary
## 
### 
A would-be student sued UC-Davis
Medical School after he was denied
admission in two successive years.
The California Supreme Court de
clared the University of California
program to increase minority enroll
ment unconstitutional and ordered
that the student be admitted.
On Nov. 15, the U.S. Supreme Court
suspended that order for 30 days pro
viding the school an opportunity to
appeal the state decision.
On Nov. 19, the University of
California Regents voted to appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court despite the
concerns of certain civil rights groups
who fear that an unfavorable decision
at that level would have a national
political and philosophical impact
that would otherwise be limited to
California.
The student, Allan Bakke, a white,
36-year-old civil engineer from Sun
nyvale, charged that 16 less academi
cally qualified minority students were
admitted over him. Given his age and
experience, it would not be overly
speculative to assume that he was
more qualified than the average enter
ing U.C.-Davis medical student. So
what is the issue?
Exposed
A third-year University of California
medical student, unaffiliated with the
minority program, exposed the ques
tion in a statement made in the Nov. 18
San Francisco Chronicle:
"Unless applicants have had equal
opportunities, it is absurd to evaluate
them as though they had them."
After depriving generations of
minority Americans the education

(and therefore jobs), high standard of
living and viable participation in the
mainstream of American society that
whites enjoy, America agreed that dis
crimination on racial grounds was un
constitutional. The 1954 Brown vs.
Board of Education U.S. Supreme
Court decision attempted to break
down institutionalized racism.
However, many school districts are
presently under court order because
they have yet to comply with this 22-
year-old decision. The civil rights
movements of the '60s and gains at the
turn of that decade represented an ac
celeration toward the realization of
basic American constitutional rights
that had been denied for centuries.
Active search
Affirmative action is the active
search for qualified minority persons
for employment or admission. Criteria
for their evaluation are different from
the ordinary because they represent
extraordinary backgrounds and cir
cumstances.
To admit students on the basis of
affirmative action is not reverse dis
crimination. In Bakke's case, there
exists an implicit quota for white stu
dents as well as minorities. One white
student was admitted under the spe
cial program when it was started in
1970 and minority students have been
accepted since 1970 under the regular
programs as well as the one under at
tack.
What about the qualified minority
student that doesn't get admitted and
declares that a certain number of stu
dents, who were less academically
qualified than he, were admitted?

Rodney Johnson

I believe the University of California
should maintain its present policy. It's
ridiculous to think that 200 years of
exclusion can be compensated for in a
period of six years. It is the responsibil
ity of the American government to as
sume that minorities get a fair deal.
I do foresee a time when there will be
no need for affirmative action, but I
doubt it will happen in my lifetime.
