JOKES
Once there was a park in which stood two statues
— a boy and a girl statue These two had faced
each other for hundreds of years One day the fairy
godmother appeared and said. Since you have
been such good statues. I will turn you into real
people Thus with the wave of her wand the
statues became a human boy and girl The boy.
with a gleam in his eye. said "are you thinking what I
am thinking''" Oh yes. let's do it." replied the girl
So the two dashed into the nearby bushes Im
mediately there was much agitation and rustling of 1
branches Groans and shrieks of delight were |
heard Then it was quiet The two reappeared, heir
faces all aglow Didn't that feel good?" asked the
boy "It sure did, replied the girl, "but next time you
hold the pigeon and I'll shit on it."
There was an oversexed mouse who was so horny
that he wanted to get it on with all of the animals in
the |ungle He went up to a hippopotamus and said,
Hey hippo, let s get down l whereupon the hip
popotamus laughed and told him to split because ,
he was |ust too small The mouse approached a
giraffe and said, Hey giraffe, wanna get lucky?" '■
whereupon the giraffe replied. "Go away, you re too '
small Finally ne found a gigantic, crary mother
elephant "Hey elephant, said the mouse. "Let's get .
it on'" "Sure," said the elephant, 'lump on fhe (
mouse quickly climbed up a tree, lumped on the
elephant and started going for it. Just then the !
elephant stepped on a big thorn and let out a :
horrendous moan "Suffah baby, suffah!''
screamed the mouse
