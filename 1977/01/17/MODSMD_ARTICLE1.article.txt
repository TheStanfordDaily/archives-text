# IRS won't tax tuition remissions

### George Anders 
Protests from professors here helped
convince the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) not to tax tuition grants for chil
dren of university employes, accord
ing to Pediatrics Prof. Herbert
Schwartz.
The IRS announced Friday it would
cease its two-month effort to make
such grants taxable.
Schwartz, president of the chapter of
the American Association of Univer
sity Professors (AAIJP) here, said "a
grassroots protest here and elsewhere
had a significant effect on the IRS."
Hundreds of employes here wrote
letters to the IRS arguing against the
taxation, he said.
President Richard Lyman also wrote
the IRS opposing the proposed
change. Lyman said he had no way of
knowing the impact of the letters, but
noted many other universities also ex
pressed opposition.
Extent of program
Last year, Stanford's tuition remis
sion program issued 559 students over
$900,000 in grants. Employe children
enrolled here receive a half-tuition
grant. Employe children enrolled
elsewhere receive a grant for half their
school's tuition or half of tuition here,
whichever is less.
Both faculty and staff are covered by
the remission program here. "The
AAIIP was working as much for staff
as faculty," Schwartz said. He said re
latively low salaried staff members
would be hardest hit if tuition remis
sions were taxed.
The IRS proposed such taxation on
Nov. 2, 1976 and also called for taxa
tion of other worker benefits such as
employe discounts.
Glaring exception
The worker benefit proposal was
dropped last month. Lyman said this
made the IRS's continued effort to tax
tuition remission "stick out as a glar
ing exception to the general policy."
Congress had reviewed tuition re
mission programs in 1954 and ap
proved their tax-exempt status.
In his letter, Lyman wrote "this issue
should be referred to the Congress for
study and should not be resolved on
the basis of administrative judge
ments."
The IRS said in a notice published in
the Federal Register that it is yielding
to a recommendation for a congres
sional study of scholarships and fel
lowships.
Lyman said he is unaware of any
Congressional interest in making tui
tion grants taxable.
While the IRS was still considering
taxing these grants, the university con
tacted Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.)
and Sen. John Tunney (D-Calif.) for
support, Schwartz said.
