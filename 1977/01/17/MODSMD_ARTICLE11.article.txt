# Language requirement must be balanced

The major thrust of the article enti
tled "The Study of Foreign Lan
guages" by French and Italian Prof.
Alphonse Juilland and Philosophy
Prof. Julius Moravcsik (Daily, Dec. 1) is
expressed in the following two sen
tences:
"One of the defining human charac
teristics is rationality. But the full po
tentiality of our rational faculties can
be studied only insofar as the thought
forming processes are reflected in lan
guage."
Language, according to these pro
fessors, is one of the most important
keys to the understanding of human
nature, and the understanding of
human nature, or the "deepening of
our humanity," is the purpose of lib
eral education.
"We can know ourselves insofar as
our distinctive human qualities and
capabilities are reflected in such cog
nitive activities as the use of lan
guage," they say. "Furthermore, since
these processes do not lend them
selves to direct observation, we can
only understand them by studying the
nature of their objects: the structure of
language, of argument, of proof, of
explanation."
Inaccurate view
These ideas, though well thought
out, proceed from an inaccurate view
of what our humanity is, and how lan
guage reflects that humanity.
In tact, language has repeatedly
shown itself to be incapable of reflect
ing the "full potentiality of our ra
tional faculties." While Juilland and
Moravcsik attack as a misconception
the notion that "language serves
merely as an external 'wrapping' for
our ideas, and not as an inherent part
of the thought-forming process," the
fact that the professors realize that the
potentialities of our rational faculties
have not been fully revealed shows
that this partnership is not as intimate
as they say.
Our rational faculties are capable of
more than can be expressed through
language. If no thoughts existed apart
from linguistic structures, "novel situ
ations" — new thoughts beyond the
mere re-arrangement of syntactical
building blocks — could not exist. It is

precisely at this point of conception of
a new idea that the inseparability of
thought processes and linguistic struc
tures becomes invalid.
Revolts, experiments
This fallacy is shown by the revolts
and experiments of modern authors,
such as James Joyce in Finnegans
Wake and contemporary Austrian wri
ter Peter Handke in his play Kaspar.
What we find in Joyce and Handke's
works is actually a new, a foreign lan
guage. By studying their new lan
guages we can attempt to find out two
things: what thoughts and ideas are
behind their writings and why the
existing linguistic structures were in
adequate "wrapping" for their new
thoughts. In the same way, the study of
a conventional foreign language al
lows us to see exactly what thoughts
and ideas are being expressed by
non-English authors and the
shortcomings and positive aspects of
our own language.
What we can never find out, how
ever, is the full potentiality of our ra
tional faculties. That our rational
faculties are one step ahead of our lin
guistic structures is the basis for lin
guistic and intellectual progress.
Falls short
We can see, then, that with the study
of language we would fall short of dis
covering the full potentiality of the
human mind; we would not arrive at a
total understanding of human nature.
Even if language were somehow capa
ble of exhibiting the nature of our ra
tional faculties, the study of language
would not lead us to an understanding
of human nature.
For human nature is comprised of
more than just rational faculties. The
essence of man, what makes him the
complex character that he is, is the co
existence of his rationality and his irra
tionality or emotions.
The totally rationalistic view of
human nature that Moravcsik and Juil
land espouse is not a valid one.
The ability of language to express
emotion is very limited. Emotion in
literature is expressed mainly by
showing the effects of the emotion; the
actual nature of emotion cannot be ex
pressed by language.

Mankind, therefore, turns to non
language means of communication to
purely express emotion. If language
had been found to be the most capable
vehicle for emotion, painting and
music would not have been pursued.
They would not have the unique emo
tional impact on us that they do. In
these modes of expression the emo
tional side of human nature is more
clearly visible.
The exploration of both the rational
and emotional sides of human nature
is important to our understanding of
humanity. If we want to have a liberal
education which does this completely,
we must study both courses which
explore the workings of the rational
mind, such as foreign languages and
mathematics, and those which explore
the more purely emotional aspects of
humanity, such as music and art.

John Toenjes

If we feel a need to push for basic
courses required for a liberal educa
tion, we should broaden the require
ments to include more than the study
of the rational aspect of human nature,
or abandon the requirements al
together.
Requiring language and not music
and art may foster a one-sided view of
human nature in Stanford students, a
view that humanity is totally rational,
and not give a picture of the true nature
of humanity.
Although I think that requiring the
study of foreign languages is a step in
the right direction for a broader under
standing of the nature of humanity, the
lack of a counterbalancing step in a
different direction may foster a wrong,
or at least biased, view of "those qual
ities which are distinctly human."

currently on the road in Europe.)
