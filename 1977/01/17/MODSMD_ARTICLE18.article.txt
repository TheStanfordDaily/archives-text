# Group forms to fight abortion
## 
### Karen Knowles 
Abortion is a sign of the gen
eral trend of declining value of
human life, according to a new
group which has formed on
campus, the Stanford Human
Coalition.
About 15 persons attended the
coalition's first organizational
meeting last Thursday night in
Tresidder. Among those attend
ing were Bill MacDougall. Stan
ford Arena editor, and Doug
Bandow, ASSU Senator, who ar
ranged the meeting.
Linda Stierman, one of the
anti-abortionists present, told
the group, "Pro-abortionists
don't know what's involved (in
an abortion). They speak of the
dangers of pregnancy, but don't
mention the dangers of abortion.
The dangerous part of pre
gnancy is labor, but a woman
having an abortion must also go
through labor, an artifically in
duced labor. Pro-abortionists
also fail to point out ihe long
term dangers of abortion, such as
the increased likelihood of mis
carriage."
Stierman, a maternity nurse
for the past seven years, recently
quit her job at the Medical Center

in protest of the new placement
of abortion patients in the
maternity ward.
The group denounced the ar
bitrary decision that birth is the
beginning of life, emphasizing
that an unborn child is human
and alive.
The coalition members said
they hope to heighten the
awareness of the community to
the atrocities of abortion. It is try
ing to convince the community
that condoning an abortion is as
wrong as having one. Stierman
commented, "Many think that it is
not their place to decide if some
one else should have an abor
tion. It is not only their place, but

also their responsibility to pre
vent it."
The coalition stressed, how
ever, that they don't want to
legislate morality, hut only to
prevent murder. They view the
abortion argument as a question
of mere inconvenience versus
human life.
MacDougall and Bandow both
voiced pleasure in the variety of
political and religious
backgrounds of those at the
meeting. MacDougall com
mented that most people think of
anti-abortion as limited to
Catholics and conservatives.
