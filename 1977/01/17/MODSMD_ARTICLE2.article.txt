## 
### Stephanie Smith 
Defending and extending minority
admissions and reversing the Bakke
decision were among the resolutions
passed at the statewide organizing
conference against the Bakke decision
which met Saturday at IJC-Berkeley.
Nine members of the Stanford Coali
tion against the Bakke Decision
(SCABD) attended the conference, ac
cording to member Manuel Hernan
dez. The conference was sponsored by

the Bay Area Coalition Against the
Bakke Decision to organize opposition
to the California Supreme Court's de
cision in Bakke vs. Regents of the Uni
versity of California that "reverse dis
crimination" had occurred in the ad
missions procedures at UC-Davis Med
ical School.
The state conference decided to or
ganize regional demonstrations and
teach-ins during the week of Feb.
18-25 to protest the Bakke decision.

according to Hernandez.
"During that week teach-ins will be
held on all campuses and in com
munities where we have coalition
members," Hernandez said. "De
monstrations have been suggested at
the UC headquarters and at the state
colleges."
Activities
The Stanford Coalition members
presently have no specific activities
planned for that week. The conference
proposals will be discussed at the next
SCABD meeting Thursday.
In addition to passing resolutions
regarding the Bakke decision and
minority admissions, Hernandez said
conference members approved resolu
tions stating:
—The University of California must
plead guilty to past and present dis
crimination as documented by the
Statewide Coalition Against the Bakke
Decision;
—The University of California must
accept the coalition's co-counsel to
represent minorities; and
—The lawyers involved in the Bakke
case should be investigated.
UC lawyers
"Bakke won because the UC lawyers
failed to prove that previous discrimi
nation had taken place in the UC sys
tem. Also, there has been general criti
cism that the UC lawyers didn't repre
sent minorities," Hernandez said.
Another resolution approved by the
conference called for an end to cut
backs in minority admissions prog
rams combined with an increase of
funds and minorities' control.
The conference also resolved that
women's hiring and admissions prog
rams should be expanded and given
more funds, but not at the expense of
minority hiring and admissions prog
rams.
Hernandez said that other areas have
already organized activities against
the Bakke decision.

Decision;
—The University of California must
accept the coalition's co-counsel to
represent minorities; and
—The lawyers involved in the Bakke
case should be investigated.
UC lawyers
"Bakke won because the UC lawyers
failed to prove that previous discrimi
nation had taken place in the UC sys
tem. Also, there has been general criti
cism that the UC lawyers didn't repre
sent minorities," Hernandez said.
Another resolution approved by the
conference called for an end to cut
backs in minority admissions prog
rams combined with an increase of
funds and minorities' control.
The conference also resolved that
women's hiring and admissions prog
rams should be expanded and given
more funds, but not at the expense of
minority hiring and admissions prog
rams.
Hernandez said that other areas have
already organized activities against
the Bakke decision.
