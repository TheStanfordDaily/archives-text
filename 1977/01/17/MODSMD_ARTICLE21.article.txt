The UCLA Bruins are back in their accus
tomed spot at the top of the Pacific-8 confer

to share top billing with three other teams.
Washington, Washington State and Ore
gon join the Bruins in a four-way tie for first
place; with the teams all holding 3-1 records
in league play.
The 12th-ranked UCLA squad collected
wins over California and Stanford as
6-foot-7 senior Marques Johnson and 6-10
sophomore David Greenwood combined for
101 points in the two contests.
Against California, Greenwood hit for a
career high 34 points to pace the Bruins to
an 82-74 win.
Hitting on 13 of its first 15 shots from the
field, UCLA jumped off to a 27-13 lead and
held a 47-35 margin at the half.
Washington and Washington State each
earned a split on the road against the two
Oregon schools.

The Huskies fell to Oregon, 72-68, in
overtime, but bounced back to outdistance
Oregon State, 90-76.
Senior forwards Greg Ballard and Ernie
Kent paced the Ducks to the overtime win
over Washington. Kent, who finished with
18 points, scored his team's last nine points,
including six in the overtime period.
Against Oregon State, Washington con
nected on 13 of its first 17 shots from the
floor to jump out to an early 30-9 lead, and
led by as many as 24 points before settling
for a 47-33 halftime margin.
The Beavers made several comeback at
tempts, once narrowing the margin down to
eight with about nine minutes left, but were
held off by Washington's balanced scoring
attack.
Washington State, meanwhile, lost to
Oregon State, 61-58, but upset 20th-ranked
Oregon 49-45.
In the WSU-OSU contest, Oregon State

four points the rest of the way.
