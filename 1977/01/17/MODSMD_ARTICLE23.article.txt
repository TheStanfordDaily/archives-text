# Stanford gives UCLA a scare
## Aroused Bruins beat Cards 
### Chris Baker 
Stanford played out of its head
for one half against 12th ranked
UCLA Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion, but the Bruins came
out of the dressing room after the
half and played like the UCLA of
old to beat the Cardinals 100-86.
The Cards shot an amazing 74
per cent from the field in the first
half, and 82 per cent from the
line, to take a 49-48 lead at in
termission.
And many among the stand
ing room only crowd were think
ing about a repeat of the Maples
Miracle, when Stanford took a
53-50 lead early in the second
half.
'Control offense'
"We came out in a control of
fense," said Stanford coach Dick
Dißiaso. "Everything went as
planned in the first half."
UCLA coach Gene Bartow, al
ready under fire for losing two
games this season, felt fortunate
to be down by only one point at
halftime.
"Stanford played well. They
shot extremely well in the first
half," said Bartow. "We were
fortunate that we were down by
only one point at the half."
But Bartow should make a
tape of whatever he told his team

in the locker room.
The Bruin front line, Marques
Johnson and David Greenwood,
manhandled Stanford. UCLA
scored 12 straight points to take
a 62-53 lead and it was no con
test.
After the Bruins jumped out to
a 58-53 lead. Johnson dunked
the ball three times and Green
wood once. Johnson was called
for a technical foul on his last
stuff shot because he hung on the
rim.
But the All-American forward
said that the Bruins weren't try
ing to demoralize the Cardinals.
"It wasn't like we were trying to
demoralize them or anything.
The slam dunk is the highest
percentage shot there is," said
Johnson. "David and 1 just hap
pened to have a couple of oppor
tunities.
"It did feel really good to get
really rolling like that. We knew
at halftime we were not playing
anywhere near our potential. We
have too much ability to be los
ing like that," said Johnson.
74 per cent
"Stanford played good tonight
— I mean they shot 74 per cent in
the first half. But we shouldn't be
losing to them."
It certainly didn't look that
way in the first half. Stanford
was the better team.
UCLA opened up a 34-24 lead
before Stanford made its move.
The Cards, with Mike Bratz, Jeff
McHugh and Wolfe Perry run
ning the back door lay-in to per
fection, outscored the Bruins
14-4 to tie the contest at 38-38,
with 3:59 left.
The lead changed hands six
times in the final three minutes
of the half as Maples went wild.
Bratz calmly sank two free
throws with nine seconds left to
send the Cards into the locker
room with a one point lead.
'Mental lapses'
"We weren't running in the
first half," said UCLA guard Roy
Hamilton. "When we slow down
we lose our concentration. They
were shooting unbelievably in
the first half. They had a good
zone to contain Marques on the
wing. I guess we had a lot of
mental lapses."
Three Stanford starters were
in double figures in the first half.

Bratz was tied with Johnson for
the scoring honors with 14
points. McHugh, with a six for
six performance from the floor,
had 12 points and Perry scored
11.
But the Cards couldn't match
their 74 per cent shooting per
formance in the second half.
Stanford shot .472 in the second
half and was outrebounded
21-14.
Defensive pressure
"We played with real intensity
in the second half," said Bartow.
"We knew we could get inside.
We put more pressure on them in
the second half."
The Cards got 43 points from
their guards — Bratz with 22 and
Perry with 21.
"1 thought Wolfe Perry and
Mike Bratz were just tremendous
for Stanford," said Bartow. "But
our guards played well too."
The UCLA backcourt of
Hamilton and Jim Spillane was
the difference in the contest.
Hamilton had just nine points
and Spillane six in the first half.
But Hamilton finished the con
test with 22 points, going six for
eight in the final 20 minutes.
Spillane tallied 18 points in the
contest.
"UCLA's guards played very

aggressive defense in the second
half," said Dißiaso. "Defense
any wrestling coach would have
been proud of."
But the UCLA players thought
the officials — Booker Turner
and Tom Harrington let the
Cards get away with a lot of il
legal contact. "There was a lot of
contact under the basket." said
Creenwood. "We were getting il
legal screens under the basket."
