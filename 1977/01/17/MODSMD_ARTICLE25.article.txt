# Women cagers drop two games
## 
### Debbie Carlton 
The Stanford women's bas
ketball team pulled a jekyll and
Hyde this weekend, showing its
two faces in a 73-62 loss toChico
State, and a 67-35 loss to UC-Davis.
The Cards played without the
services of center Maggie Nel
son, who missed the games with
an ankle injury. But Stanford
almost beat Chico, the best squad
in northern California.
Saturday night's contest
against Davis followed a simple
formula — one team was very
good, and the other was very
bad. The Cards trailed Davis by
no less than 30 points the entire
game. The final 67-35 score
makes one suspect that some

thing was definitely wrong.
Whereas Card coach Dotty
McCrea didn't even want to talk
about Saturday's game, she had
nothing but good things to say
about Friday's performance
against Chico.
"We played very well — I was
very proud of the entire team,"
stated McCrea. "I told them that
they should consider it a vic
tory."
With the half-time score
34-32, Stanford kept up the pres
sure on Chico during the second
half, never allowing more than a
four-point lead. Two free throws
shot by Stanford forward
Stephanie Calef tied the score at
62-62 with 2:08 remaining in the
game. Chico suddenly found
extra energy and surged ahead to
bring the final score to 73-62, the
largest point spread of the even
ing.
McCrea singled out sopho
more forward Ruth Montague
with "a good job on the boards"
and frosh forward Retsv Lough
for a "fine display of hustle."
Senior forward Stephanie Galef
was high scorer for the Cards
with 18 points, followed by
freshman guard Peg Chutich
with 17.
The loss to the tough Chico
team took something out of the
Cards for Saturday night's game
against UC-Davis. Stated
McCrea, "Psychologically they
were down. They weren't in the
game from the very start."
