# Card women finish first
## Indiana swimmers win relays 
### Jill Lieber 
Stanford hosted the 16th annual Stan
ford Invitational Relays Saturday in the
deCuerre Pool Complex with the Card
men coming in third and the women edg
ing out Foxcatchers Swim Club for first
place.
"On the whole the women did a good
job with some good splits in the relays,"
said assistant coach Debbie Meyer. "The
men didn't do too badly, but the sprinters
were disappointed they didn't go faster."
The sprinters are sore as they have been
doing a lot of weight training, and Meyer
t hi nks that as soon as they get weights out
of the way, they will come up with some
good strong swims.
Swimming power
Indiana won the men's portion of the
relays with help from their top sprinter
Jim Montgomery, a three-time gold
medalist in Montreal.

Montgomery, who dazzled the swim
ming world with his 49.99 in the IUO met
ers freestyle in July, swam well Saturday,
yet held back a bit.
"I think Fairbank can beat him," Meyer
said. "Bruner almost caught him on the
800 free relay."
Indiana beat Cal the day before the
Relay in a seesaw battle. Meyer said the
second-ranked Hoosiers were slightly ta
pered for their Western trip. The Cards,
on the other hand, used the meet as a part
of their training program.
Hoosiers rested
"Indiana was more rested for the meet
than we were," Meyer said. "It's hard
when you're swimming through a meet
and another team is more rested. It hurts
mentally to have someone beat you with a
fantastic time."
The Cards however had some great
splits even without tapering for the
meet. Frosh Kim Peyton went 51.9 for her

100 split of the 400 tree relay. Sophomore
Barb Beck swam a 59.7 100 fly in her leg of
the .100 fly relay and she also went a 1:04
in the 100IM leg of the 100 IM relay.
Senior sprinter Dave Fairbank swam a
20.9 going out in the4oo free relay,
l airbank, who was studying overseas in
Italy last quarter, holds the best 50 free
time on the squad. 20.18.
In the 1600 free relay. Bill Chao and
Paul Hartloff had 400 free legs of 3:41.
while Sandy Mac Donald also put in a
good time of 52.1 in the 100 fly leg of the
400 fly relay.
Meyer continues to be impressed by
frosh Tom O'Brien and said she expects
frosh butterflier Bob Hagberg to come on
strong soon, too.
"Hagberg swam a 51.0 fly yesterday but
I'd like to see him go 49.6," she said.
He s been tired because he's also doinu
the sprint workouts."

Hoosiers walked off with the Stanford Invitational Relay title.
Stanford hosted the 16th annual Stan
ford Invitational Relays Saturday in the
deCuerre Pool Complex with the Card
men coming in third and the women edg
ing out Foxcatchers Swim Club for first
place.
"On the whole the women did a good
job with some good splits in the relays,"
said assistant coach Debbie Meyer. "The
men didn't do too badly, but the sprinters
were disappointed they didn't go faster."
The sprinters are sore as they have been
doing a lot of weight training, and Meyer
t hi nks that as soon as they get weights out
of the way, they will come up with some
good strong swims.
Swimming power
Indiana won the men's portion of the
relays with help from their top sprinter
Jim Montgomery, a three-time gold
medalist in Montreal.

Montgomery, who dazzled the swim
ming world with his 49.99 in the IUO met
ers freestyle in July, swam well Saturday,
yet held back a bit.
"I think Fairbank can beat him," Meyer
said. "Bruner almost caught him on the
800 free relay."
Indiana beat Cal the day before the
Relay in a seesaw battle. Meyer said the
second-ranked Hoosiers were slightly ta
pered for their Western trip. The Cards,
on the other hand, used the meet as a part
of their training program.
Hoosiers rested
"Indiana was more rested for the meet
than we were," Meyer said. "It's hard
when you're swimming through a meet
and another team is more rested. It hurts
mentally to have someone beat you with a
fantastic time."
The Cards however had some great
splits even without tapering for the
meet. Frosh Kim Peyton went 51.9 for her

100 split of the 400 tree relay. Sophomore
Barb Beck swam a 59.7 100 fly in her leg of
the .100 fly relay and she also went a 1:04
in the 100IM leg of the 100 IM relay.
Senior sprinter Dave Fairbank swam a
20.9 going out in the4oo free relay,
l airbank, who was studying overseas in
Italy last quarter, holds the best 50 free
time on the squad. 20.18.
In the 1600 free relay. Bill Chao and
Paul Hartloff had 400 free legs of 3:41.
while Sandy Mac Donald also put in a
good time of 52.1 in the 100 fly leg of the
400 fly relay.
Meyer continues to be impressed by
frosh Tom O'Brien and said she expects
frosh butterflier Bob Hagberg to come on
strong soon, too.
"Hagberg swam a 51.0 fly yesterday but
I'd like to see him go 49.6," she said.
He s been tired because he's also doinu
the sprint workouts."
