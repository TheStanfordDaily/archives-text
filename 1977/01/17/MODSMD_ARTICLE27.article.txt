The Stanford gymnastics team
had a disappointing Saturday
night, placing third in competi
tion with Cal State-Northridge
and host UCLA. However, indi
vidual performances proved to
be the highlight for the Cards.
Freshman standout Tad Bos
tick scored 8.55 to take top hon
ors in floor exercise, while mak
ing a strong enough showing in
his other events to win the all
around title.
Chris Takimoto, sophomore
understudy to three-time NCAA

pommel horse titlist Ted Marcy,
scored an 8.7 to capture the
event.
Under the supervision of
coach Sadao Hamada, the team
needs to rebuild after losing
Marcy, Bill Madsen and Leo
Hollberg to graduation. Hamada
has high hopes for Bostick,
Takimoto and junior Bobby Farb
in Pac-8 and NCA A competition.
The next meet will be Jan. 28 at
7 p.m. in Encina Cym.
