# Miller describes state of university

Stanford is in a state of "thriving
uncertainty," Provost William Miller
told the Academic Council Friday.
"On one hand we have produced
many outstanding accomplishments
over the last few years," said Miller,
"but on the other hand there are forces
and pressures at work which simply
have to give us cause for concern and
keep us from becoming complacent."
Such accomplishments include
strong faculty appointments, the uni
versity's ability to attract an outstand
ing student body, and the many
awards won by the university's fa
culty, said Miller.
"One of my most encouraging ob
servations about our accomplish
ments." he said, is that the university
has demonstrated "an outstanding
capacity to respond to new forces and
to deal with different problems."
Miller's remarks were made before a
sparsely attended winter quarter meet
ing of the council. Only 40 out of the
over 1100 council members were pre
sent.

"The economic situation is still
tenuous," said Miller. "Government
action can have a rather big impact on
us, and public and student attitudes
affect our fate."
Economically, "there is no doubt
that higher education is in a less favor
able situation overall than in the recent
past," he said. The labor-intensive na
ture of the university and the increas
ing competition between public and
private education are two causes for
this situation, Miller added.
The university has formerly been
able to adjust more flexibly to
economic pressures because "we were
able to cover up (our) problems with
growth." said Miller. In the past, the
university could more readily increase
the rate of growth of tuition and in
crease the size of its student bodv.
Such methods are not as available to
us now, said Miller.
"Now we must make more efficient
use of our resources (and) also expand
opportunities for increased income."
said Miller.
