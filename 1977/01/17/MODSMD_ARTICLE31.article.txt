# Soviet supports Helsinki pact
## 
### Marc Strassman Yvonne Randle 
Individual Americans can help the
movement for human rights in the
Soviet Union by demanding that the
U.S. Government require the Soviet
government to observe the human
rights provisions of the Helsinki ag
reement before giving the Russians the
grain, high technology and economic
credits they need, according to Andre
Amalrik, a dissident Soviet historian.
Amalrik, 38, was exiled from the
Soviet Union in 1975 from a prison
camp in Siberia, to which he had been
sent for, among other things, writing
Will the Soviet Union Survive Until
1984:' The book is an analysis of fun
damental contradictions in the Soviet
system and a critique of Soviet society.
Before bringing his message to a
capacity audience of 400 persons in
Annenberg Auditorium Thursday
night, Amalrik presented similar pleas
for U.S. pressure against the U.S.S.R.
to the Senate Foreign Relations Com

mittee and to Cyrus Vance. Secretary
ot State-designate earlier this month.
The major goals of the human rights
movement in the Soviet Union, ac
cording to Amalrik, are to increase the
civil rights and moral status of indi
viduals, while at the same time en
couraging corresponding economic
and social reforms.
Subway bombings
Almarik said recent bombings in a
Moscow subway station may have
been performed by the KGB (the Soviet
secret police) as part of a campaign to
discredit the human rights movement
in that country and to prepare for a
stepped-up campaign of repression
against that movement.
Amalrik discounted the possibility
that the bombings could have been
done by the human rights movement,
which, he said, rejects violence as a
method ot achieving social change.
Amalrik said that the Soviet gov
ernment has responded to the human
rights movement in a variety of ways,
all negative. I'hese responses include:
murder disguised as "hooliganism."
dismissal from jobs, forced exile to
another part ot Russia, beatings, con
finement in psychiatric hospitals and
arbitrary arrests.
'The gift of English'
After apologizing to the audience
because he had "not been given the gift
of speaking English." Amalrik read his
speech in English, at a level of profi
ciency which he said was at least the
equal of (first secretary of the Soviet
Union) Leonid Brezhnev's ability to
read Russian.
Questions from the audience and
Amalrik's responses were translated
by Terrence Emmons, associate pro
fessor of history and editor of publica
tions put out by Hoover Institution
concerning the Russian Revolution.
The Institution, together with the
ASSU. sponsored the talk.
Almarik, asked what he now
thought was the most probable answer
to the question posed by the title of his
Will the Soviet Union Survive Until

19W-I?. answered thai he would move
his deadline tor the government's col
lapse "up another 10 years" because of
the Soviet government's unexpected
flexibility in responding to internal
dissent and its policy of detente with
the United States.
Elaborating on the theine of divi
sions within the Soviet ruling class.
Amalrik said that the progressive ele
ments in the Soviet leadership might
possibly be pushed into an alliance
with the human rights movement
against the neo-Stalinists during the
transition period that will follow the
death or retirement of Brezhnev if the
U.S. will demand strict observance of
the Helsinki accords.
Amalrik also argued for withhold
ing American grain shipments as a
means ot torcing the Soviet govern
ment to undertake necessary agricul
tural reforms.

means ot torcing the Soviet govern
ment to undertake necessary agricul
tural reforms.
Individual Americans can help the
movement for human rights in the
Soviet Union by demanding that the
U.S. Government require the Soviet
government to observe the human
rights provisions of the Helsinki ag
reement before giving the Russians the
grain, high technology and economic
credits they need, according to Andre
Amalrik, a dissident Soviet historian.
Amalrik, 38, was exiled from the
Soviet Union in 1975 from a prison
camp in Siberia, to which he had been
sent for, among other things, writing
Will the Soviet Union Survive Until
1984:' The book is an analysis of fun
damental contradictions in the Soviet
system and a critique of Soviet society.
Before bringing his message to a
capacity audience of 400 persons in
Annenberg Auditorium Thursday
night, Amalrik presented similar pleas
for U.S. pressure against the U.S.S.R.
to the Senate Foreign Relations Com

mittee and to Cyrus Vance. Secretary
ot State-designate earlier this month.
The major goals of the human rights
movement in the Soviet Union, ac
cording to Amalrik, are to increase the
civil rights and moral status of indi
viduals, while at the same time en
couraging corresponding economic
and social reforms.
Subway bombings
Almarik said recent bombings in a
Moscow subway station may have
been performed by the KGB (the Soviet
secret police) as part of a campaign to
discredit the human rights movement
in that country and to prepare for a
stepped-up campaign of repression
against that movement.
Amalrik discounted the possibility
that the bombings could have been
done by the human rights movement,
which, he said, rejects violence as a
method ot achieving social change.
Amalrik said that the Soviet gov
ernment has responded to the human
rights movement in a variety of ways,
all negative. I'hese responses include:
murder disguised as "hooliganism."
dismissal from jobs, forced exile to
another part ot Russia, beatings, con
finement in psychiatric hospitals and
arbitrary arrests.
'The gift of English'
After apologizing to the audience
because he had "not been given the gift
of speaking English." Amalrik read his
speech in English, at a level of profi
ciency which he said was at least the
equal of (first secretary of the Soviet
Union) Leonid Brezhnev's ability to
read Russian.
Questions from the audience and
Amalrik's responses were translated
by Terrence Emmons, associate pro
fessor of history and editor of publica
tions put out by Hoover Institution
concerning the Russian Revolution.
The Institution, together with the
ASSU. sponsored the talk.
Almarik, asked what he now
thought was the most probable answer
to the question posed by the title of his
Will the Soviet Union Survive Until

19W-I?. answered thai he would move
his deadline tor the government's col
lapse "up another 10 years" because of
the Soviet government's unexpected
flexibility in responding to internal
dissent and its policy of detente with
the United States.
Elaborating on the theine of divi
sions within the Soviet ruling class.
Amalrik said that the progressive ele
ments in the Soviet leadership might
possibly be pushed into an alliance
with the human rights movement
against the neo-Stalinists during the
transition period that will follow the
death or retirement of Brezhnev if the
U.S. will demand strict observance of
the Helsinki accords.
Amalrik also argued for withhold
ing American grain shipments as a
means ot torcing the Soviet govern
ment to undertake necessary agricul
tural reforms.
