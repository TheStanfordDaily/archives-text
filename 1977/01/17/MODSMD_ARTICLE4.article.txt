# Can Carter save money, serve needs?

Second of a five-part series
on the Carter administration
Professors here differ over whether
Jimmy Carter will be able to
meet his campaign promises to in
crease social services while simul
taneously balancing the federal budget
by 1980.
Citing national health insurance and

'there is no evidence yet of Carter's administration being
a watershed . .

welfare reform as Carter's major
domestic program goals, Thomas
Moore, a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution and director of the Institu
tion's Domestic Studies Program, pre
dicted that Carter "can't do both with
out raising taxes, which in peacetime
is politically impossible. 1 don't think
there is any way he can with the exist
ing taxes and have enough to balance
the budget."
Roger Noll, a visiting professor of
economics at the Business School, dis
agreed with Moore's analysis, saying
that "advances along all fronts" might
be possible, particularly under condi
tions of full employment, which he
said would provide "several tens of
billions of dollars" for social prog
rams.
Duncan Foley, associate professor of
economics, said he thought Carter
would have to compromise to get
either one of his goals of a balanced
budget and increased social programs.

Foley said he thought Carter was
"committed to solving problems
within the existing economic struc
ture," but his ability to do so would be
limited by external conditions over
which Carter would have no control.
While a national health program on
the order of Britain's National Health
System might not be affordable ac
cording to Noll, "an extention of exist-

ing private insurance programs would
cost substantially less and might be
possible."
"I still have high hopes about the
Carter Administration; in the long run,
I'm an optimist," Noll said, but added
he was "surprised a little" that Carter's
major appointments had been "pretty
much the same as those of the last four
or five administrations, going back to
1953."
Referring to the "convergence" of
major party policies, Noll said that
Carter's choices for his cabinet do not
indicate much change in government.
No watershed yet
Noll said "there is no evidence yet of
Carter's administration being a
watershed" in terms of policies and
programs as was the case with
Franklin Roosevelt's presidency. Noll
added that he thought Carter was "too
conservative a person" to make drama
tic changes, and that lack of experi
ence with the Washington bureauc

racy has made him seem to "be acting
like he's overcome" by the enormity of
the government.
Noll is on leave from the California
Institute of Technology, whose presi
dent, Harold Brown, was selected by
Carter to be the next secretary of de
fense. Noll said that Brown is "in the
long tradition of former secretaries of
defense," citing Charles Wilson in the
Eisenhower administration and Robert
McNamara under Kennedy and
Johnson.
Noll commented that "only in the
defense establishment could Brown be
thought of as a dove." Under Brown,
Noll said, the country could expect
"the same policies we've had for de
cades."
Government regulation
Noll, whose area of expertise is gov
ernment regulatory policy, said he had
"high hopes" for regulatory reform
under Carter since "only a Democrat
can reform regulation, in the same way
that only a Republican could establish

'reform would have to be cataclysmic' for substantial
change in regulations for railroads

relations with China." Noll pointed
out that regulatory commissions mus
hroomed during the Democratic ad
ministrations of the 19305.
Noll was not pleased, however, with
the appointment of Brock Adams as
secretary of transportation. He called
Adams "the last defender of the In
terstate Commerce Commission,"

which Noll said is in large part respon
siblefor the establishment of "regional
railroad cartels."
Yak fat
In order to make any substantial
change in the regulatory situation as it
applies to railroads, said Noll, "reform
would have to be cataclysmic." No re
form is possible, he claimed, as long as
the commission's size remains at an
unwieldy level of "11 people having to
decide on rates of hauling yak fat from
St. Louis to Chicago."
Hoover Fellow Moore cited two
major obstacles to any efforts Carter
might undertake to improve the coun
try's economy. First, any Carter prop
osal will face inevitable delay in im
plementation since it will first have to
be passed by Congress.
Secondly, said Moore, Carter can get
the necessary funds for economic
stimulation only by government bor
rowing, which will "squeeze the capi
tal markets and drive interest rates up"
or by printing more money, which

would be inflationary.
Moore said he expects Carter to hold
to his promise of pardoning resisters to
the war in Vietnam.
"The American Legion will jump up
and down and froth at the mouth a
little bit," Moore predicted.
On the subject of race, Moore fore-
