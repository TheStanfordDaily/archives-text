# Delts apply for reinstatement
## 
### Arlene Kishi Staff writer 
The Delta Tau Delta fraternity filed a
petition for reinstatement on campus
in the 1977-78 academic year last
week. The fraternity was suspended
after an incident last May when a
number of Delts and their friends
trashed several other fraternities.
"It is our hope that with this
reinstatement and with proper Delta
alumni and faculty assistance, stan
dards can be established to assure con
tinuance of the Delta Tau Delta chapter
in a manner that would benefit the
Stanford community," stated the peti
tion.
The petition was submitted by Eric
Grunseth, Delt president; Bob Flint,
Delt treasurer; and Steve Schwartz, an
active member, at Thursday's meeting
with Norm Robinson, director of resi
dential education and Tom Hornbeck,
assistant director of the row.
"We feel the record speaks for itself
and in the past they have held us to our

record, so we think the record can be
used here in the same way." Schwartz
explained. "We've been sincere, trying
to develop new traditions as well as
keeping old ones that are beneficial.
We want to help the school out and
we're excited about the possibilities of
what this house can do on campus."
Robinson indicated the possibility
of the reinstatement of the fraternity.
"It's a possibility or else we
wouldn't have let them even petition

Robinson will review the petition with
Hornbeck and Row Director Karen
Murray, and then make a recommen
dation to Jim Lyons, Acting Dean of
Student Affairs. A decision will be
reached "within a couple of weeks,"
said Robinson.
Delts' activities
The petition, submitted to Robin
son, outlined actions taken by the
Delts to "justify their return to full
status in the university fraternity sys
tem." These included regularly
scheduled meetings held all quarter
that unified the membership and firm
leadership development.
"The hard work and long hours in
volved . . . are evidence of the mem
bership's goal to return to its campus
residence as a viable organization;
committed to the educational and frat
ernal goals on which it was founded,"
said Grunseth.
Faculty associations have been es
tablished for continued academic
awareness and they are currently in
the process of establishing a faculty
advisory board to develop a possible
lecture series by university professors
in order to achieve the educational
goals of the fraternity.
In the future, the members are plan
ning to attend the Delt national con
ventions. And prior financial deficits
to the university have been cleared
through the assistance of Delt alumni,
Schwartz said.
The Delts began work on this appeal
last June following their suspension,
Schwartz said.

said Robinson.
Delts' activities
The petition, submitted to Robin
son, outlined actions taken by the
Delts to "justify their return to full
status in the university fraternity sys
tem." These included regularly
scheduled meetings held all quarter
that unified the membership and firm
leadership development.
"The hard work and long hours in
volved . . . are evidence of the mem
bership's goal to return to its campus
residence as a viable organization;
committed to the educational and frat
ernal goals on which it was founded,"
said Grunseth.
Faculty associations have been es
tablished for continued academic
awareness and they are currently in
the process of establishing a faculty
advisory board to develop a possible
lecture series by university professors
in order to achieve the educational
goals of the fraternity.
In the future, the members are plan
ning to attend the Delt national con
ventions. And prior financial deficits
to the university have been cleared
through the assistance of Delt alumni,
Schwartz said.
The Delts began work on this appeal
last June following their suspension,
Schwartz said.
The Delta Tau Delta fraternity filed a
petition for reinstatement on campus
in the 1977-78 academic year last
week. The fraternity was suspended
after an incident last May when a
number of Delts and their friends
trashed several other fraternities.
"It is our hope that with this
reinstatement and with proper Delta
alumni and faculty assistance, stan
dards can be established to assure con
tinuance of the Delta Tau Delta chapter
in a manner that would benefit the
Stanford community," stated the peti
tion.
The petition was submitted by Eric
Grunseth, Delt president; Bob Flint,
Delt treasurer; and Steve Schwartz, an
active member, at Thursday's meeting
with Norm Robinson, director of resi
dential education and Tom Hornbeck,
assistant director of the row.
"We feel the record speaks for itself
and in the past they have held us to our

record, so we think the record can be
used here in the same way." Schwartz
explained. "We've been sincere, trying
to develop new traditions as well as
keeping old ones that are beneficial.
We want to help the school out and
we're excited about the possibilities of
what this house can do on campus."
Robinson indicated the possibility
of the reinstatement of the fraternity.
"It's a possibility or else we
wouldn't have let them even petition

Robinson will review the petition with

Student Affairs. A decision will be
reached "within a couple of weeks,"
