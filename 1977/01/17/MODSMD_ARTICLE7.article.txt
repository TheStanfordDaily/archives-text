# Ford aide to receive Hoover post
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Robert Hartmann, White House
counselor and chief speechwriter for
President Gerald Ford, will be ap
pointed for a two-year term as a senior
research fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, according to W. Glenn Campbell,
director of the Institution.
Hartmann was a top aide to Ford
when Ford was Republican minority
leader in the House of Representatives
nnd chief of staff when Ford was vice
president. Hartmann became Ford's
principal adviser when he became
president in the wake of Watergate.
Hartmann graduated from Stanford
in 1938 with a degree in social sci
ences. He was an editor of the Chapar
ral , the campus humor magazine. Told
that current editors of the Chaparral
today hold important positions of re
sponsibility in several campus organi
zations, the presidential speech writer
commented: "See? Not so much has
changed."
Contacted at his home in suburban
Westgate, Maryland, Hartmann said of
his still unofficially announced ap
pointment: "I'm not going to deny it."
He said a likely source of an article in
Saturday's Palo Alto Times mention
ing the appointment was friends he
had told about accepting the appoint
ment.
No second guesses
Asked to comment on his expecta
tions of the new Car'er Administra
tion, Hartmann said, "I'm not going to
second guess" the Democratic presi
dent before he takes office on Thurs
day.
Hartmann said he was "very busy"
during this last week of the Ford presi
dency, that moving out was "a tre
mendous job."
While Hartmann said it was "sad to
break-up" the group that had served
the president in the White House, he
commented that he had the consola
tion of knowing he "won't have to get
up for those early morning meetings
any more."
He said his personal plans after
Thursday were to "vacation for
awhile."
Hartniann's duties
Hoover director Campbell said that
the precise nature of Hartmann's re
sponsibilities as a senior research fel
low has not been worked out yet.
