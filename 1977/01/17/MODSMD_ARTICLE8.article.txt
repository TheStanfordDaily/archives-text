# Who needs the B-1 bomber?
##

Steve Hansch

One of the first returns that will be
coming in with regard to President
elect Jimmy Carter's ability and/or wil
lingness to fulfill his campaign prom
ises will be his decision to either cut or
continue the B-1 Bomber program.
Indeed, this may well be his most
important single decision as president
for it will determine where $92 billion
dollars will go, when the arms race
finally winds down, and whether the
ozone layer of our atmosphere has a
future.
First, the $92 billion would clearly
provide more jobs and more services if
spent directly within the civilian sec
tor of the economy. B-1 Bombers are
highly capital-intensive products
which consume expensive fuel and
demand costly upkeep.
Therefore there is no question that

the bomber is an enormous burden fi
nancially, leading only to profits in
corporations such as Rockwell Inter
national, General Electric and Boeing.
No contribution
Secondly, there is no question that
the bomber will contribute absolutely
nothing to national security. Mutually
assured destruction already exists be
tween the superpowers and con
sequently there can be no gain through
increased destructive power.
The 425 B-52's now available vastly
outnumber the Soviet Union's fleet.
The point that the United States can
retaliate against nuclear attack with
overkill potential has already been
proven to the rest of the world.
The B-1 cannot reprove this point
however much it may increase the

magnitude and efficiency of the Un
ited State's ability to obliterate.
Enormous threat
Thirdly, the B-l poses an enormous
threat to the environment. The poten
tial of the destruction of the ozone
layer due to nitrogen oxide released in
the stratosphere at four per cent per
annum directly demonstrates another
method by which the B-l could end all
life.
Carter used to agree with these ar
guments, saying last June, "The B-l is
wasteful of taxpayer's dollars and
should not be funded." Recently,
however, he has been ominously silent
as the Pentagon and big business have
applied their pressure.
The Pentagon may succeed in get
ting Carter to wait in making his deci
sion past the Feb. 1, Congressionally
determined deadline. The longer after
the election Carter waits, the less likely
that voters will remember his cam
paign promises.
Merely a tool
Even Carter, however, will not con
sider the use of the B-l as morally rep
rehensible in that it is merely a tool of
United States imperialism. The United
States needs more striking power as
much as it needs more giant corpora
tions and the two are not independent
of each other.
The United State's ability to impose
its will abroad is increased by having
bombers which can potentially fly on
errands of destruction and be called
back (unlike missiles) after the weaker
nation has given in.
The B-l bomber cannot be allowed
to be built dependent upon the deci
sions of generals and politicians alone.
A massive national letter writing cam
paign is needed (and is scheduled) just
prior to Feb. 1.1 urge everyone to send
in their feelings immediately.

One of the first returns that will be
coming in with regard to President
elect Jimmy Carter's ability and/or wil
lingness to fulfill his campaign prom
ises will be his decision to either cut or
continue the B-1 Bomber program.
Indeed, this may well be his most
important single decision as president
for it will determine where $92 billion
dollars will go, when the arms race
finally winds down, and whether the
ozone layer of our atmosphere has a
future.
First, the $92 billion would clearly
provide more jobs and more services if
spent directly within the civilian sec
tor of the economy. B-1 Bombers are
highly capital-intensive products
which consume expensive fuel and
demand costly upkeep.
Therefore there is no question that

the bomber is an enormous burden fi
nancially, leading only to profits in
corporations such as Rockwell Inter
national, General Electric and Boeing.
No contribution
Secondly, there is no question that
the bomber will contribute absolutely
nothing to national security. Mutually
assured destruction already exists be
tween the superpowers and con
sequently there can be no gain through
increased destructive power.
The 425 B-52's now available vastly
outnumber the Soviet Union's fleet.
The point that the United States can
retaliate against nuclear attack with
overkill potential has already been
proven to the rest of the world.
The B-1 cannot reprove this point
however much it may increase the

magnitude and efficiency of the Un
ited State's ability to obliterate.
Enormous threat
Thirdly, the B-l poses an enormous
threat to the environment. The poten
tial of the destruction of the ozone
layer due to nitrogen oxide released in
the stratosphere at four per cent per
annum directly demonstrates another
method by which the B-l could end all
life.
Carter used to agree with these ar
guments, saying last June, "The B-l is
wasteful of taxpayer's dollars and
should not be funded." Recently,
however, he has been ominously silent
as the Pentagon and big business have
applied their pressure.
The Pentagon may succeed in get
ting Carter to wait in making his deci
sion past the Feb. 1, Congressionally
determined deadline. The longer after
the election Carter waits, the less likely
that voters will remember his cam
paign promises.
Merely a tool
Even Carter, however, will not con
sider the use of the B-l as morally rep
rehensible in that it is merely a tool of
United States imperialism. The United
States needs more striking power as
much as it needs more giant corpora
tions and the two are not independent
of each other.
The United State's ability to impose
its will abroad is increased by having
bombers which can potentially fly on
errands of destruction and be called
back (unlike missiles) after the weaker
nation has given in.
The B-l bomber cannot be allowed
to be built dependent upon the deci
sions of generals and politicians alone.
A massive national letter writing cam
paign is needed (and is scheduled) just
prior to Feb. 1.1 urge everyone to send
in their feelings immediately.
