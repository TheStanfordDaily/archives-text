Athletic policy
Last year the university decided to
drop varsity wrestling as a sport. The
major reason was economic — the Ath
letic Department, faced with budget
cuts, could not afford this $10,000 a
year sport.
This year we fired a football coach
and paid off the remaining part of his
contract, approximately $30,000 a year
for two years. We also hired a new
coach at a reported $6000 a year higher
salary.
Where did this money come from?
Not from alumni, we are told. Is it from
a very substantial "reserve fund"? If
so, why aren't these funds available for
wrestling and other minor sports? Is a

new football coach more valuable than
an entire sport?
Perhaps it was felt that a new coach
would produce more winning teams,
thereby improving alumni giving and
gate receipts. Perhaps this additional
money would benefit the entire athle
tic program.
But if we want better football teams,
in order to raise more money, then we
should recognize that our football
players are here to make money for the
university. And for this they are enti
tled to be paid! On ability, not need.
Perhaps I am making too many as
sumptions, drawing untenable con
clusions. However, I am mystified
about our policy towards athletics and
their role in the university. I think we
could use some clear answers.

Cliveden is valuable
With the tightening budgets of the
last few years the fate of Stanford's
overseas campus in England, Clive
den, is in doubt. That Cliveden is at the
bottom of the Foreign Studies Commit
tee's priority list is common know
ledge. Cliveden's relegated position is
based, at least in part, on the notion of
"native language."
The argument goes something like
this; since we speak the same language
as the British (although they would die
at such a degradation of the Queen's
English) the academic and/or social
experience in England will be of less
educational significance than at other
foreign campuses.
The erroneousness of this logic de
fies verbalization. That Cliveden, or
any program based in England, is any
less a valuable part of the Stanford ex
perience due to a similarity in lan
guage, is to grossly simplify our coun
try's relationship with our cultural,
social and political forebearers.
Any such "native language" argu
ment is inherently naive. In the
months to come I hope the English
overseas program receives the fair
evaluation it deserves.
