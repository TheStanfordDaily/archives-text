So Come On In
and Laugh a Little
Once twra was a park in which stood two statues
— a boy and a girl statue These two had faced
each other for hundreds ol years One day the fairy
godmother appeared and said, 1 Since you have
been such good statues, I will turn you into real
people Thus with the wave of her wand the
statues became a human boy and girl The boy,
with a gleam in his eye. said are you thinking what I
am thinking'''' Oh yes, let's do it.' replied the girl
So the two dashed into the nearby bushes Im
mediately there was much agitation and rustling of
branches Groans and shrieks of delight were
heard Then it was quiet The two reappeared, heir
faces all aglow Didn t that fee) good?" asked the
boy Itsuredd. replied the girl, but next time you
hold the pigeon and I'll shit on it." .
There was an oversexed mouse who was so horny
that he wanted to get it on with all of the animals in
the |ungle He went up to a hippopotamus and said.
Hey hippo, let s get down 1 whereupon the hip- ,
popotamus laughed and told him to split because
he was |ust too small The mouse approached a
giraffe and said. Hey giraffe wanna get lucky?'' '
whereupon the giraffe replied, Go away, you re too 1
small Finally he found a gigantic, crary mother :
elephant Hey elephant, said the mouse, Let sget |
it on!' Sure, said the elephant, "jump on the ,
mouse quickly climbed up a tree lumped on the
elephant and started going for it Just then the '
elephant stepped on a big thorn and let out a :
horrendous moan Suffah baby, suftaM"
screamed the mouse.
