# Last-minute appeal fails
## Gilmore executed 
### 
Point Of The Mountain, Utah (AP)
â€” A five-man firing squad executed
killer Gary Gil more yesterday, minutes
after a federal appeals court rejected
the last attempt by death penalty op
ponents to keep him alive against his
wishes.
The execution was the first in the
United States in nearly 10 years.
It was carried out after the Utah at
torney general, a federal judge, and a
lawyer opposed to the death penalty
took a predawn flight to Denver to
argue issues raised in a stay granted by
U.S. District Judge Willis Ritter seven
hours before the execution.
Gilmore died bound to a chair by
nylon ropes with a hood over his head.
Before his death at 9:07 a.m., Pacific
Standard Time, he spoke to two
lawyers and an uncle who witnessed
the execution.
The last-minute efforts of death pen

alty opponents included a bid to the
Supreme Court to reverse the ruling of
the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overturning Ritter's decision. But the
high court declined to enter the case,
ending the legal efforts.
After the Supreme Court decided
not to interfere in the case, Gilmore
was loaded into a van, driven to a cin
derblock building and strapped into
the chair.
Gilmore attorney Ronald Stanger
spoke through tears. He, attorney
Robert Moody and Gilmore's uncle,
Vern D'Amico, spent the night with
the inmate. Stanger said Gilmore joked
and sang as his death approached.
Gilmore curses stay
A break in that mood came when the
temporary stay was announced.
Stanger said Gilmore cursed Ritter,
using strong obscenities.
He said the convict felt he had re

ceived a gift because "he knew when
he was going to die and he felt he was
indeed fortunate."
Stanger added, "In the wee hours ot
the morning, he expressed thanks and
some sorrow. He was a good man. He
expressed love for children."
Gilmore was executed for the mur
der of Bennie Bushnell, 26, a Provo,
Utah, motel clerk. He had also admit
ted killing Max David Jensen, 24, an
Orem service station attendant. Both
were shot during robberies. Each left a
young widow and a child.
He was never tried in the death of
Jensen.
The death announcement was met
with silence by about 60 death penalty
opponents demonstrating outside the
prison fence.
Protesters arrested
In another demonstration in
Washington, eight persons were ar
rested for refusing to leave the Sup
reme Court building after the court re
fused to hear the Gilmore case.
The shots that killed him could not
be heard either in the briefing room
where newsmen waited or among the
demonstrators.
Schiller said there were 30 to 40
witnesses, most of them apparently
prison personnel and authorities.
He said there were emotional ex
changes between the witnesses and
Gilmore spoke quietly to several of
them.
Prison officials said they would
never reveal the identity of the firing
squad or its squad leader, also behind
the screen.
Utah Gov. Scott Matheson and Salt
Lake City Mayor Ted Wilson both said
state law should be changed to provide
for automatic review of death sen
tences.
