# Searching for modern heroes
## 
### 
Admittedly, columnists too often
spend time focusing on the objects of
their scorn, thus giving the reader the
impression that the writer sees the
world as one horrible nightmare.
So instead of devoting this piece to
examining the inanity of a recent San
Francisco Examiner story, "10-year
olds beg Carter to cure nation's ills," I
decided instead to search for some liv
ing heroes in this world.
Hero is, of course, a subjective term;
one can only be a hero to someone else.
Thus forced to draw up criteria for the
distinction, I settled on these: one
whose success came against great odds
(poverty, discrimination, personal
handicaps), or whose toils on behalf of
a principle were undertaken despite
popular opposition or ridicule.
Additionally, and this is where per
sonal philosophy enters the picture,
my search was limited to those whose
actions (through either their intended
or unintended results), on the whole
have not diminished the rights of
others to their lives and liberty (and
thus property).
Exclusions
This condition has excluded, for
example, generals, compulsory-union
leaders and most politicians.
What I found was that it isn't so easy
to find individuals to whom one
wishes to attach the title "hero."
There's Henry Aaron, for instance.
The home run king of baseball and an
occasional agitant for racial justice
seems a likely candidate — but then
there's that incident of the strawberry
pie in the local sportswriter's face.
Does Aaron have the tolerance of criti
cism which befits a hero?
There's William O. Douglas, who
was willing to risk removal from the
Supreme Court over a series of deci
sions championing the rights of un
popular individuals. Yet Douglas re
turned more than his share of bizarre
rulings, lacking in both legal prece
dent and philosophical consistency.
And there's Ralph Nader, the ascetic

giant-killer who has proved the po
tency of one individual, but many of
whose actions have added unneces
sary restrictions to the marketplace
and millions of dollars to the cost of
consumer goods.
Nevertheless, 1 did locate a few can-

didates for sainthood. None is perfect,
but the magnitude of their achieve
ments far outweighs the evil of their
sins.
Former Sen. J. William Fulbright
(D-Ark.) is my sole entry from the
political world. Fulbright's history is
one of struggle against powerful in
stitutions: the University of Arkansas,
Harry S Truman and the imperial pres
idency of Lyndon Johnson.
His strident opposition to interven
tion in Southeast Asia represented a
break from lifelong adherence to Wil
sonian notions of American destiny.
Integrity enhanced
From the sports world come two
men whose actions have enhanced the
integrity of their game and epitomized
the term "sportsman." They are Penn
State football coach Joe Paterno and
Boston Celtic Dave Cowens.
From journalism, I would nominate
Washington Post publisher Katharine
Graham for her courage in dealing
with the high-and-mighty, and syndi
cated columnist Jack Anderson for his
even-handed pursuit of muckraking.
Novelist Ayn Rand rose from the
poverty of her days as a Russian im
migrant to commercial literary success
while living the personal philosophy
she espouses.
Her accomplishments are more

noteworthy for the fact she challenged
the basic ethos of modern civilization
and suffered banishment from the
worlds of academia and the arts as a
result.
Atheist crusader Madalyn Murray
O'Hair has argued untiringly on be
half of the rights of one of the most
scorned minorities in the United
States, and her efforts have born legal
fruit.
Singer Joan Baez's struggle against
tyranny has taken her from the days of
unpopular opposition to the Vietnam
War to her current association with
Amnesty International.
It has also led her to Northern Ire
land, where she is aiding the burgeon
ing efforts of the Women's Peace
Movement and leaders Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan.
Brave exposes
A coterie of Soviet dissidents has
pained the conscience of the world
with brave exposes of oppression be
hind what is still an Iron Curtain.
Former Pentagon analyst Ernest
Fitzgerald paid the price of honesty in
the "Free World" when his relevations
of cost overruns in the Defense De
partment brought a dismissal en
gineered by, among others, Defense
Secretary-designate Harold Brown.
There are other individuals on the
horizon whose acts of principle have
earned them popular derision and may
qualify them for inclusion as heroes,
among them former Central Intelli
gence Agency agent Victor Marchetti,
CBS News correspondent Daniel
Schorr and Margo St. James, advocate
of the legal rights of prostitutes.
Beyond this list are countless others
whose acts of heroism have drawn
only minor notice and whose endur
ance of suffering for a cause goes on
without relent. Thanks to them, life
has dignity, honor and purpose, and
the world is far less a nightmare.

Supreme Court over a series of deci
sions championing the rights of un
popular individuals. Yet Douglas re
turned more than his share of bizarre
rulings, lacking in both legal prece
dent and philosophical consistency.
And there's Ralph Nader, the ascetic

giant-killer who has proved the po
tency of one individual, but many of
whose actions have added unneces
sary restrictions to the marketplace
and millions of dollars to the cost of
consumer goods.
Nevertheless, 1 did locate a few can-

didates for sainthood. None is perfect,
but the magnitude of their achieve
ments far outweighs the evil of their
sins.
Former Sen. J. William Fulbright
(D-Ark.) is my sole entry from the
political world. Fulbright's history is
one of struggle against powerful in
stitutions: the University of Arkansas,
Harry S Truman and the imperial pres
idency of Lyndon Johnson.
His strident opposition to interven
tion in Southeast Asia represented a
break from lifelong adherence to Wil
sonian notions of American destiny.
Integrity enhanced
From the sports world come two
men whose actions have enhanced the
integrity of their game and epitomized
the term "sportsman." They are Penn
State football coach Joe Paterno and
Boston Celtic Dave Cowens.
From journalism, I would nominate
Washington Post publisher Katharine
Graham for her courage in dealing
with the high-and-mighty, and syndi
cated columnist Jack Anderson for his
even-handed pursuit of muckraking.
Novelist Ayn Rand rose from the
poverty of her days as a Russian im
migrant to commercial literary success
while living the personal philosophy
she espouses.
Her accomplishments are more

noteworthy for the fact she challenged
the basic ethos of modern civilization
and suffered banishment from the
worlds of academia and the arts as a
result.
Atheist crusader Madalyn Murray
O'Hair has argued untiringly on be
half of the rights of one of the most
scorned minorities in the United
States, and her efforts have born legal
fruit.
Singer Joan Baez's struggle against
tyranny has taken her from the days of
unpopular opposition to the Vietnam
War to her current association with
Amnesty International.
It has also led her to Northern Ire
land, where she is aiding the burgeon
ing efforts of the Women's Peace
Movement and leaders Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan.
Brave exposes
A coterie of Soviet dissidents has
pained the conscience of the world
with brave exposes of oppression be
hind what is still an Iron Curtain.
Former Pentagon analyst Ernest
Fitzgerald paid the price of honesty in
the "Free World" when his relevations
of cost overruns in the Defense De
partment brought a dismissal en
gineered by, among others, Defense
Secretary-designate Harold Brown.
There are other individuals on the
horizon whose acts of principle have
earned them popular derision and may
qualify them for inclusion as heroes,
among them former Central Intelli
gence Agency agent Victor Marchetti,
CBS News correspondent Daniel
Schorr and Margo St. James, advocate
of the legal rights of prostitutes.
Beyond this list are countless others
whose acts of heroism have drawn
only minor notice and whose endur
ance of suffering for a cause goes on
without relent. Thanks to them, life
has dignity, honor and purpose, and
the world is far less a nightmare.

Admittedly, columnists too often
spend time focusing on the objects of
their scorn, thus giving the reader the
impression that the writer sees the
world as one horrible nightmare.
So instead of devoting this piece to
examining the inanity of a recent San
Francisco Examiner story, "10-year
olds beg Carter to cure nation's ills," I
decided instead to search for some liv
ing heroes in this world.
Hero is, of course, a subjective term;
one can only be a hero to someone else.
Thus forced to draw up criteria for the
distinction, I settled on these: one
whose success came against great odds
(poverty, discrimination, personal
handicaps), or whose toils on behalf of
a principle were undertaken despite
popular opposition or ridicule.
Additionally, and this is where per
sonal philosophy enters the picture,
my search was limited to those whose
actions (through either their intended
or unintended results), on the whole
have not diminished the rights of
others to their lives and liberty (and
thus property).
Exclusions
This condition has excluded, for
example, generals, compulsory-union
leaders and most politicians.
What I found was that it isn't so easy
to find individuals to whom one
wishes to attach the title "hero."
There's Henry Aaron, for instance.
The home run king of baseball and an
occasional agitant for racial justice
seems a likely candidate — but then
there's that incident of the strawberry
pie in the local sportswriter's face.
Does Aaron have the tolerance of criti
cism which befits a hero?

Admittedly, columnists too often
spend time focusing on the objects of
their scorn, thus giving the reader the
impression that the writer sees the
world as one horrible nightmare.
So instead of devoting this piece to
examining the inanity of a recent San
Francisco Examiner story, "10-year
olds beg Carter to cure nation's ills," I
decided instead to search for some liv
ing heroes in this world.
Hero is, of course, a subjective term;
one can only be a hero to someone else.
Thus forced to draw up criteria for the
distinction, I settled on these: one
whose success came against great odds
(poverty, discrimination, personal
handicaps), or whose toils on behalf of
a principle were undertaken despite
popular opposition or ridicule.
Additionally, and this is where per
sonal philosophy enters the picture,
my search was limited to those whose
actions (through either their intended
or unintended results), on the whole
have not diminished the rights of
others to their lives and liberty (and
thus property).
Exclusions
This condition has excluded, for
example, generals, compulsory-union
leaders and most politicians.
What I found was that it isn't so easy
to find individuals to whom one
wishes to attach the title "hero."
There's Henry Aaron, for instance.
The home run king of baseball and an
occasional agitant for racial justice
seems a likely candidate — but then
there's that incident of the strawberry
pie in the local sportswriter's face.
Does Aaron have the tolerance of criti
cism which befits a hero?
There's William O. Douglas, who
was willing to risk removal from the
Supreme Court over a series of deci
sions championing the rights of un
popular individuals. Yet Douglas re
turned more than his share of bizarre
rulings, lacking in both legal prece
dent and philosophical consistency.
And there's Ralph Nader, the ascetic

giant-killer who has proved the po
tency of one individual, but many of
whose actions have added unneces
sary restrictions to the marketplace
and millions of dollars to the cost of
consumer goods.
Nevertheless, 1 did locate a few can-

didates for sainthood. None is perfect,
but the magnitude of their achieve
ments far outweighs the evil of their
sins.
Former Sen. J. William Fulbright
(D-Ark.) is my sole entry from the
political world. Fulbright's history is
one of struggle against powerful in
stitutions: the University of Arkansas,
Harry S Truman and the imperial pres
idency of Lyndon Johnson.
His strident opposition to interven
tion in Southeast Asia represented a
break from lifelong adherence to Wil
sonian notions of American destiny.
Integrity enhanced
From the sports world come two
men whose actions have enhanced the
integrity of their game and epitomized
the term "sportsman." They are Penn
State football coach Joe Paterno and
Boston Celtic Dave Cowens.
From journalism, I would nominate
Washington Post publisher Katharine
Graham for her courage in dealing
with the high-and-mighty, and syndi
cated columnist Jack Anderson for his
even-handed pursuit of muckraking.
Novelist Ayn Rand rose from the
poverty of her days as a Russian im
migrant to commercial literary success
while living the personal philosophy
she espouses.
Her accomplishments are more

noteworthy for the fact she challenged
the basic ethos of modern civilization
and suffered banishment from the
worlds of academia and the arts as a
result.
