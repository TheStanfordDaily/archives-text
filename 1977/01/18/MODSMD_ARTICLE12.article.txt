# Why keep Cliveden? Because it's British
## 
### 
Smith, et al.

The Overseas Studies Office's general fund
budget must be reduced to 50 per cent of its 1975
level by September 1978. As a result, the university
is considering eliminating the program in Great
Britain, now centered at Cliveden.
We believe such action would be a major step
backward in the pursuit of a quality Stanford edu
cation.
It is our understanding that among the reasons
offered for closing the Stanford-in-Britain program,
three are prominent.
First, as there is no language barrier between
Great Britain and the United States, the cultural
differences in Britain are not as great as those ex
perienced in the other overseas studies programs.
Second, because of this language similarity, it
would also be easier for students here to enroll
independently in English universities than in those
of other European nations.
Budget reductions
Third, because of budget reductions, the Over
seas Studies Office has been forced to consider cut
ting back programs and for the reasons stated above
believes Cliveden to be the most expendable. We
will address these issues.
We find it hard to believe that while the ad
ministration has reinstated the Western Civiliza
tion requirement to instruct undergraduates in the
foundations of our culture, it would also contradict
this commitment by eliminating its program in the
country which has provided us with the roots of our
political, legal and cultural systems.
To deny students the opportunity to delve first
hand into a history centuries older than ours,
merely because we share a language with the
British, is a simplification of the relationship bet
ween the two cultures.
Britain's contemporary culture, which includes
distinct languages and customs in England, Scot
land and Wales, does not bear a ereat deal of simi

larity to our own.
Social customs, the standard of living, and the
outlook on life of the average British citizen differ
significantly from those of the average American.
One of the outstanding features of Cliveden is
that it is a mixture of the historical and the contem
porary. The Cliveden estate dates back to 1668, and
its history is intimately involved with the last three
centuries of British history.
As a study center, Cliveden today also offers sev
eral important opportunities. Set near typical En
glish small towns, Cliveden provides myriad occa
sions for interaction with people, and Stanford stu
dents do take advantage of them.
Volunteer teaching, community theater, fencing,
choral singing, rugby, soccer and rowing are just
some of the activities we and other Stanford stu
dents have engaged in in Cliveden's environs.
Unparalleled center
London, unparalleled as center for the theater
and other arts, is less than an hour away from
Cliveden, and is less difficult to get to than is San
Francisco from Palo Alto.
As Cliveden is a small educational facility, stu
dents are required to do field work and research off
campus. Many have arranged through Stanford for
special programs at Oxford, Brunei and Reading
Universities.
The fact there was no language barrier not only
enabled students to appreciate the academic chal
lenge of these programs but also provided
maximum involvement in English society.
Indeed for many studies, such as the Stanford
in-Britain summer focus programs — health care
delivery, communications. Anglo-American law
and international business — the easy ability to
understand a common language was absolutely es
sential for complete and in-depth research.
England is the ideal studv center for students in

history and English, the two largest humanities and
social sciences majors.
Also, by eliminating the program in Britain, most
students with rigid schedule requirements, such as
engineering majors and pre-medical students, and
students who have studied non-Western European
languages, would be denied an overseas studies
experience.
Without a British study center it would be very
difficult for students to enroll in English univer
sities. Securing acceptance, reconciling schedule
differences, arranging transfer of credits, and ob
taining necessary financial aid are all obstacles
which one would have to face.
Realistically, how many of the approximately
230 students who annually attend Cliveden could
be expected to overcome these barriers?
Financially efficient
Pulling out of Cliveden will mean the loss of
some 320 student quarters per year from the Over
seas Studies program. It will mean that more than
one-third of the Stanford students who annually
study overseas will not be able to.
Yet Cliveden is financially efficient on a cost
per-student basis, a fact apparently lost on those
who look only at the $150,000 that will stay in the
general fund each year.
Why must one of Stanford's most attractive prog
rams, be dismantled because of a relatively small
sum of money? Why can't money be located some
where in the budget to stave off the demise of the
Overseas Studies program?
Cliveden has been for many the best experience
of their years here. Its popularity cannot be dis
puted — witness the waiting lists every quarter. We
urge that Stanford honor its commitment to
strengthen the study of liberal arts and save Clive
den.

choral singing, rugby, soccer and rowing are just
some of the activities we and other Stanford stu
dents have engaged in in Cliveden's environs.
Unparalleled center
London, unparalleled as center for the theater
and other arts, is less than an hour away from
Cliveden, and is less difficult to get to than is San
Francisco from Palo Alto.
As Cliveden is a small educational facility, stu
dents are required to do field work and research off
campus. Many have arranged through Stanford for
special programs at Oxford, Brunei and Reading
Universities.
The fact there was no language barrier not only
enabled students to appreciate the academic chal
lenge of these programs but also provided
maximum involvement in English society.
Indeed for many studies, such as the Stanford
in-Britain summer focus programs — health care
delivery, communications. Anglo-American law
and international business — the easy ability to
understand a common language was absolutely es
sential for complete and in-depth research.
England is the ideal studv center for students in

history and English, the two largest humanities and
social sciences majors.
Also, by eliminating the program in Britain, most
students with rigid schedule requirements, such as
engineering majors and pre-medical students, and
students who have studied non-Western European
languages, would be denied an overseas studies
experience.
Without a British study center it would be very
difficult for students to enroll in English univer
sities. Securing acceptance, reconciling schedule
differences, arranging transfer of credits, and ob
taining necessary financial aid are all obstacles
which one would have to face.
Realistically, how many of the approximately
230 students who annually attend Cliveden could
be expected to overcome these barriers?
Financially efficient
Pulling out of Cliveden will mean the loss of
some 320 student quarters per year from the Over
seas Studies program. It will mean that more than
one-third of the Stanford students who annually
study overseas will not be able to.
Yet Cliveden is financially efficient on a cost
per-student basis, a fact apparently lost on those
who look only at the $150,000 that will stay in the
general fund each year.
Why must one of Stanford's most attractive prog
rams, be dismantled because of a relatively small
sum of money? Why can't money be located some
where in the budget to stave off the demise of the
Overseas Studies program?
Cliveden has been for many the best experience
of their years here. Its popularity cannot be dis
puted — witness the waiting lists every quarter. We
urge that Stanford honor its commitment to
strengthen the study of liberal arts and save Clive
den.

Smith, et al.

The Overseas Studies Office's general fund
budget must be reduced to 50 per cent of its 1975
level by September 1978. As a result, the university
is considering eliminating the program in Great
Britain, now centered at Cliveden.
We believe such action would be a major step
backward in the pursuit of a quality Stanford edu
cation.
It is our understanding that among the reasons
offered for closing the Stanford-in-Britain program,
three are prominent.
First, as there is no language barrier between
Great Britain and the United States, the cultural
differences in Britain are not as great as those ex
perienced in the other overseas studies programs.
Second, because of this language similarity, it
would also be easier for students here to enroll
independently in English universities than in those
of other European nations.
Budget reductions
Third, because of budget reductions, the Over
seas Studies Office has been forced to consider cut
ting back programs and for the reasons stated above
believes Cliveden to be the most expendable. We
will address these issues.
We find it hard to believe that while the ad
ministration has reinstated the Western Civiliza
tion requirement to instruct undergraduates in the
foundations of our culture, it would also contradict
this commitment by eliminating its program in the
country which has provided us with the roots of our
political, legal and cultural systems.
To deny students the opportunity to delve first
hand into a history centuries older than ours,
merely because we share a language with the
British, is a simplification of the relationship bet
ween the two cultures.
Britain's contemporary culture, which includes
distinct languages and customs in England, Scot
land and Wales, does not bear a ereat deal of simi

larity to our own.
Social customs, the standard of living, and the
outlook on life of the average British citizen differ
significantly from those of the average American.
One of the outstanding features of Cliveden is
that it is a mixture of the historical and the contem
porary. The Cliveden estate dates back to 1668, and
its history is intimately involved with the last three
centuries of British history.
As a study center, Cliveden today also offers sev
eral important opportunities. Set near typical En
glish small towns, Cliveden provides myriad occa
sions for interaction with people, and Stanford stu
dents do take advantage of them.

of their years here. Its popularity cannot be dis
puted — witness the waiting lists every quarter. We
urge that Stanford honor its commitment to
strengthen the study of liberal arts and save Clive
den.

Smith, et al.

The Overseas Studies Office's general fund
budget must be reduced to 50 per cent of its 1975
level by September 1978. As a result, the university
is considering eliminating the program in Great
Britain, now centered at Cliveden.
We believe such action would be a major step
backward in the pursuit of a quality Stanford edu
cation.
It is our understanding that among the reasons
offered for closing the Stanford-in-Britain program,
three are prominent.
First, as there is no language barrier between
Great Britain and the United States, the cultural
differences in Britain are not as great as those ex
perienced in the other overseas studies programs.
Second, because of this language similarity, it
would also be easier for students here to enroll
independently in English universities than in those
of other European nations.
Budget reductions
Third, because of budget reductions, the Over
seas Studies Office has been forced to consider cut
ting back programs and for the reasons stated above
believes Cliveden to be the most expendable. We
will address these issues.
We find it hard to believe that while the ad
ministration has reinstated the Western Civiliza
tion requirement to instruct undergraduates in the
foundations of our culture, it would also contradict
this commitment by eliminating its program in the
country which has provided us with the roots of our
political, legal and cultural systems.
To deny students the opportunity to delve first
hand into a history centuries older than ours,
merely because we share a language with the
British, is a simplification of the relationship bet
ween the two cultures.
Britain's contemporary culture, which includes
distinct languages and customs in England, Scot
land and Wales, does not bear a ereat deal of simi

larity to our own.
Social customs, the standard of living, and the
outlook on life of the average British citizen differ
significantly from those of the average American.
One of the outstanding features of Cliveden is
that it is a mixture of the historical and the contem
porary. The Cliveden estate dates back to 1668, and
its history is intimately involved with the last three
centuries of British history.
As a study center, Cliveden today also offers sev
eral important opportunities. Set near typical En
glish small towns, Cliveden provides myriad occa
sions for interaction with people, and Stanford stu
dents do take advantage of them.
Volunteer teaching, community theater, fencing,
choral singing, rugby, soccer and rowing are just
some of the activities we and other Stanford stu
dents have engaged in in Cliveden's environs.
Unparalleled center
London, unparalleled as center for the theater
and other arts, is less than an hour away from
Cliveden, and is less difficult to get to than is San
Francisco from Palo Alto.
As Cliveden is a small educational facility, stu
dents are required to do field work and research off
campus. Many have arranged through Stanford for
special programs at Oxford, Brunei and Reading
Universities.
The fact there was no language barrier not only
enabled students to appreciate the academic chal
lenge of these programs but also provided
maximum involvement in English society.
Indeed for many studies, such as the Stanford
in-Britain summer focus programs — health care
delivery, communications. Anglo-American law
and international business — the easy ability to
understand a common language was absolutely es
sential for complete and in-depth research.
England is the ideal studv center for students in

history and English, the two largest humanities and
social sciences majors.
Also, by eliminating the program in Britain, most
students with rigid schedule requirements, such as
engineering majors and pre-medical students, and
students who have studied non-Western European
languages, would be denied an overseas studies
experience.
Without a British study center it would be very
difficult for students to enroll in English univer
sities. Securing acceptance, reconciling schedule
differences, arranging transfer of credits, and ob
taining necessary financial aid are all obstacles
which one would have to face.
Realistically, how many of the approximately
230 students who annually attend Cliveden could
be expected to overcome these barriers?
Financially efficient
Pulling out of Cliveden will mean the loss of
some 320 student quarters per year from the Over
seas Studies program. It will mean that more than
one-third of the Stanford students who annually
study overseas will not be able to.
Yet Cliveden is financially efficient on a cost
per-student basis, a fact apparently lost on those
who look only at the $150,000 that will stay in the
general fund each year.
Why must one of Stanford's most attractive prog
rams, be dismantled because of a relatively small
sum of money? Why can't money be located some
where in the budget to stave off the demise of the
Overseas Studies program?
Cliveden has been for many the best experience
of their years here. Its popularity cannot be dis
puted — witness the waiting lists every quarter. We
urge that Stanford honor its commitment to
strengthen the study of liberal arts and save Clive
den.
