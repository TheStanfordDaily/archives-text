# Shopping center enters new building phase
## 
### Marc Ventresca 
Phase 1 of the three-part plan to reno
vate and enlarge the Stanford Shopping
Center is complete, with construction of
a McDonald's restaurant set to begin this
week and of additional mall buildings to
start in the coming months.
The final part of the modernization
project includes construction of three
more mall buildings which would add
an estimated 110,000 square feet of floor
space to the existing 1,050,000 square
feet, according to John Breedlove, uni
versity manager of land resources.
The new units will contain the same
variety of businesses as the present
building. Construction for the first two
sites, located west of Macy's, will start in
April, while that of the third structure,
set between Macy's and the Emporium,
will start in early 1978, Breedlove said.

The essentially complete exterior re
modeling involved covering open mall
walkways with plexiglass canopies,
creating a covered pavilion for enter
tainment, and building several foun
tains throughout the complex. Tiling
sidewalks, repainting, putting in plan
ters and hanging baskets, and installing
custom lighting fixtures complete the
scope of the first phase.
A tentative fourth phase is also on the
drawing boards. Breedlove stated that
the university's direct participation in
the construction program will conclude
with the third phase, but a large depart
ment store from the East would be in
vited to build a branch in the shopping
center, possibly as early as 1980.
New entrance
A new entrance will also be opened
from Willow Road, when the expansion

and resurfacing of that access is finished.
The cost of the project, as approved
by the University Board of Trustees, to
tals $17 million.
"Revitalizing the whole merchandise
mix in a modern physical environment"
is the underlying goal of the "New Stan
ford Shopping Center," said Breedlove.
He added that the complex was one of the
first major regional malls in northern
California, built over 20 years ago, and
that "shoppers coming to a regional
center today expect a certain environ
ment."
Increased space through remodeling
in the present mall building and the
non-renewal of some leases has enabled
15 new tenants to move in, as well as
several returning businesses.
Breedlove explained that some stores
realized that they could improve their

merchandising by being in a smaller
store, which created new spaces, while
other businesses were not functioning ef
ficiently in the shopping center and did
not have their leases renewed.
McDonald's restaurant, to be located
adjacent and to the rear of Crocker Bank,
is proceeding on schedule and will open
in March. Conforming to the architec
tural motif of the complex, it will have a
free design interior accomodating about
150 persons. Hours of operation for the
restaurant are still undecided, but will
probably approximate those of the mall.
Although shoppers and center
employes are "the main thrust" of the
intended market, Mike Kincaid, senior
supervisor of the McDonald's Bay Area
Corp., added that "we will strive to get
the student trade."
