## Splits hamper Namibia 
### Bill Burger 
"We are used to suffering and
we are prepared to suffer more
till we obtain equality, libera
tion, and complete indepen
dence." This is the prevalent at
titude among blacks in Namibia
(South West Africa) today, said
Gerhard Karl Hans Totemeyer,
senior lecturer in the Political
Science Department at Stellen
bosch University in South Af
rica, in his informal address Fri
day afternoon in Bechtel
I-Center.
Totemeyer is currently visit
ing the United States under the
auspices of the Department of
State's International Visitor
program. In his talk, Dr. To
temeyer presented his assess
ment of the political situation in
Namibia today, and what he
feels the future may hold for that
country.

Namibia, a country of one
million people, has been under
South Africa's domination for
most of this century. According
to Totemeyer, some people's de
sire for continued closeness with
South Africa and other's desire
for independence has led to the
polarization that exists in
Namibia. This polarization also
happens to be divided on racial
lines. Namibia is governed by a
white minority that comprises
only 11.6 percent of the total
population.
Totemeyer described
Namibia's policy of apartheid as
being somewhat less harsh than
South Africa's, but nonetheless,
blacks and "coloreds" (peopleof
mixed racial descent) almost
exclusively make up the coun
try's working class.
Since the 19505, said To
temeyer, there has been an in
crease of black people's aware
ness as to their condition in
Namibia. This awareness, high
tened by external forces outside
of the country, has led to a grea
ter degree of black participation
in Namibia's political forces.
Indicative of this involvement
is the vast number of separate
and identifiable political parties
that are currently active in
Namibia. Dr. Totemeyer's
studies have indicated that there
are now 29 political parties; 23 of
which are exclusively or pre
dominately black.
Totemeyer indicated that the
largest single political force in
Namibia is SWAPO (South West
Africa People's Organization),
supported by 40-60 per cent of
the total population. Hut it is this

group's lack of unity which pre
vents it from realizing its full
power potential.
According to Totemeyer.
SWAPO is divided into three
groups: the conservatives, who
support the governing National
Party; the moderates, favoring
independence; and the radicals,
favoring immediate withdrawal
of the National Party.
Although SWAPO collec
tively opposes any racial dis
criminatory policies and prop
oses a socialistic economic sys
tem for Namibia, Totemeyer said
that total unity within SWAPO is
not conceivable. The three
groups within SWAPO, each in
their own right a powerful polit
ical entity, are just not compati
ble in their ideologies.
Looking to Namibia's future,
Totemeyer admits that any ideas
on his or anyone else's part are
purely speculative, but
nevertheless, he says that a solu
tion can come only from a strug
gle between SWAPO and the Na
tional Party. In his words: "A
synthesis between the two
strongest forces in Namibia is
not forseeable."
As for South Africa's feelings
on the situation. Totemeyer said
that that country continues to
fight a solution on racial lines for
Namibia.
Even though Totemeyer
foresees many changes occuring
within the next year in Namibia,
he sees "the uncertain and unst
able situation lending itself to
conflict between ethnic groups."
The whites, who will be losing
their social and economic
privileges, will probably have
more problems than the blacks
because of a difficult adjustment
period they will face. Still, To
temeyer says the whites have a
definite role to play in Namibia's
future. Dr. Totemeyer, white
and born in Namibia in 1935,
faces his future in a proud man
ner, "1 am a Namibian," he says,
"whether I am black, brown, or
white."
"We are used to suffering and

nevertheless, he says that a solu
tion can come only from a strug
gle between SWAPO and the Na
tional Party. In his words: "A
synthesis between the two
strongest forces in Namibia is
not forseeable."
As for South Africa's feelings
on the situation. Totemeyer said
that that country continues to
fight a solution on racial lines for
Namibia.
Even though Totemeyer
foresees many changes occuring
within the next year in Namibia,
he sees "the uncertain and unst
able situation lending itself to
conflict between ethnic groups."
The whites, who will be losing
their social and economic
privileges, will probably have
more problems than the blacks
because of a difficult adjustment
period they will face. Still, To
temeyer says the whites have a
definite role to play in Namibia's
future. Dr. Totemeyer, white
and born in Namibia in 1935,
faces his future in a proud man
ner, "1 am a Namibian," he says,
"whether I am black, brown, or
white."
"We are used to suffering and
we are prepared to suffer more
till we obtain equality, libera
tion, and complete indepen
dence." This is the prevalent at
titude among blacks in Namibia
(South West Africa) today, said
Gerhard Karl Hans Totemeyer,
senior lecturer in the Political
Science Department at Stellen
bosch University in South Af
rica, in his informal address Fri
day afternoon in Bechtel
I-Center.
Totemeyer is currently visit
ing the United States under the
auspices of the Department of
State's International Visitor
program. In his talk, Dr. To
temeyer presented his assess
ment of the political situation in
Namibia today, and what he
feels the future may hold for that
country.

Namibia, a country of one
million people, has been under
South Africa's domination for
most of this century. According
to Totemeyer, some people's de
sire for continued closeness with
South Africa and other's desire
for independence has led to the
polarization that exists in
Namibia. This polarization also
happens to be divided on racial
lines. Namibia is governed by a
white minority that comprises
only 11.6 percent of the total
population.
Totemeyer described
Namibia's policy of apartheid as
being somewhat less harsh than
South Africa's, but nonetheless,
blacks and "coloreds" (peopleof
mixed racial descent) almost
exclusively make up the coun
try's working class.
Since the 19505, said To
temeyer, there has been an in
crease of black people's aware
ness as to their condition in
Namibia. This awareness, high
tened by external forces outside
of the country, has led to a grea
ter degree of black participation
in Namibia's political forces.
Indicative of this involvement
is the vast number of separate
and identifiable political parties
that are currently active in
Namibia. Dr. Totemeyer's
studies have indicated that there
are now 29 political parties; 23 of
which are exclusively or pre
dominately black.
Totemeyer indicated that the
largest single political force in
Namibia is SWAPO (South West
Africa People's Organization),
supported by 40-60 per cent of
the total population. Hut it is this

group's lack of unity which pre
vents it from realizing its full
power potential.
According to Totemeyer.
SWAPO is divided into three
groups: the conservatives, who
support the governing National
Party; the moderates, favoring
independence; and the radicals,
favoring immediate withdrawal
of the National Party.
Although SWAPO collec
tively opposes any racial dis
criminatory policies and prop
oses a socialistic economic sys
tem for Namibia, Totemeyer said
that total unity within SWAPO is
not conceivable. The three
groups within SWAPO, each in
their own right a powerful polit
ical entity, are just not compati
ble in their ideologies.
Looking to Namibia's future,
Totemeyer admits that any ideas
on his or anyone else's part are
purely speculative, but
nevertheless, he says that a solu
tion can come only from a strug
gle between SWAPO and the Na
tional Party. In his words: "A
