## Hancock reborn Herbie's new sound 
### Roy S. Johnson 
While roaming through the
cables and props backstage at
Memorial Auditorium Saturday
night, a longtime fan of Herbert
Jeffery Hancock was unable to
recognize the star. His charac
teristic goatee, sideburns, and
enormous afro were missing.
But as the band slowly took its
place on the dimly lit stage and
the first familiar waves of jazz
began to flow, there was no mis
take — it was Herbie.
Surrounded on all sides by
keyboards ranging from piano to
synthesizer to things too com
plicated to mention here, Herbie
initiated the crowd — still
somewhat numb from standing
in line in the cold — with early
Hancock, including "Waterme
lon Man."
As it was with the look, the
sound was new. What was it that
brought on the new Herbie Han
cock in such a short time?
Buddhism
"On a gig one time, we had
been up all night, and I was re
ally tired; we all were. We
started the set with 'Toys,'
which starts with a bass solo," he
explained. At the time, Han
cock's bassist was long-time
friend, Mchezaju Buster Wil
liams, a believer in Nicerin
Shoshu Buddhism.
"That solo Mchezaju played
was so remarkable, so rich, the
only word I can use is pro
found," Hancock said. "It was so
full of energy that I thought it
was the best thing I'd heard on
the instrument. It filled the
band, me, the whole room with
energy. Now 1 knew that
Mchezaju had been into some
thing," Herbie said, "but lhad to
know exactly what it was —
right then."
What it was was Nicerin
Shoshu Buddhism. Buster had
been reading from the Lotus
Sutra, studying the ideas of
Nicherin Daishonin, and chant- ,
ing "Nam-Myoho-Rnege-Kyo":
the fusion of self with the univ
ersal laws of cause and effect
through sound, vibration and
energy.
It worked
Whatever it was, it worked for
Herbie Hancock too, for it
changed his entire career. He

moved to Los Angeles, and
112 changed the personel of his en
: tire band — returning only
' saxophonist Benny Maupin—
who is still an integral part of
i Hancock's music.
He recorded Head Hunters,
now recognized as the largest
selling record of its kind. From
that album came "Chameleon,"
still the most recognizable Han
cock hit.
Herbie said the reorganization
of his spiritual energies led him
to a new-found sympathy with
the people. "I got much more in
touch with myself and thus
could reach many."
Hancock moved on to perform
some of the cuts from his latest
album, Secrets, including -
"Doin' It "j and "Gentle
Thoughts," which boasts one of
the most beautiful combinations
of electric piano theme and
Maupin lyricon solos he has ever
composed.
Wah Wah
While taking a short break, the
band left the stage to a stunning
guitar set by Herbie's team
composer Wah Wah Watson.
Anyone who wondered why he
was called "Wah Wah" was not
left in the dark for long.
Watson has been with Han
cock almost from the beginning.
And has just recently released
his first solo album entitled
Elementary.
The guitar sound creations he
made through the use of numer
ous slides, picks, and the popu
lar voice bag could have put
many an English rock star to
shame.
The energy from his solo car
ried through the crowd as they
chanted and cheered in amaze
ment.
The remainder of Herbie's
band includes bassist Paul
Jackson who hails from the Bay
Area. Herbie says he learned a lot
about funk from Paul, and he
depends on that "struttin' confi
dent bass playing" for much of
the attitude of his new music.
Drummer Jones Levi, of Oak
land, lived just two blocks from
Jackson, who brought Levi to
Herbie's drummer auditions
which were being held on a
Monday and Tuesday. Jackson

told Herbie they would be down
on Monday and that he could
cancel his Tuesday auditions.
He was sure of that.
Soulful side
Levi's career has tended to
ward the soulful side of music
with such artists as Al Green,
Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robin
son, and Marvin Gaye. And if
you check the fine print, you'll
notice he is the writer and ar
ranger of Don Cornelius' Soul
Train theme.
After closing with "Cantelope
Island," also from Secrets, Wah
Wah initiated the encore with a
heavy solo that mellowed into
the pounding theme of
"Spider," another new release.
Despite the few technical
problems that caused the show
to start a few minutes late, it
came off smoothly. The promot
ers and ASSU Special Events
crew are to be commended for
that, which is more than can be
said for many of the larger
facilities in the Bay Area, at
times.
There were a few complaints.
At times, the sound didn't come
off as well as some thought that it
should. And there was the gen
eral feeling that Herbie didn't
play long enough.
But still — can one ever get
enough of a good thing?

The energy from his solo car
ried through the crowd as they
chanted and cheered in amaze
ment.
The remainder of Herbie's
band includes bassist Paul
Jackson who hails from the Bay
Area. Herbie says he learned a lot
about funk from Paul, and he
depends on that "struttin' confi
dent bass playing" for much of
the attitude of his new music.
Drummer Jones Levi, of Oak
land, lived just two blocks from
Jackson, who brought Levi to
Herbie's drummer auditions
which were being held on a
Monday and Tuesday. Jackson

told Herbie they would be down
on Monday and that he could
cancel his Tuesday auditions.
He was sure of that.
Soulful side
Levi's career has tended to
ward the soulful side of music
with such artists as Al Green,
Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robin
son, and Marvin Gaye. And if
you check the fine print, you'll
notice he is the writer and ar
ranger of Don Cornelius' Soul
Train theme.
After closing with "Cantelope
Island," also from Secrets, Wah
Wah initiated the encore with a
heavy solo that mellowed into
the pounding theme of
"Spider," another new release.
Despite the few technical
problems that caused the show

came off smoothly. The promot
ers and ASSU Special Events
crew are to be commended for
that, which is more than can be
said for many of the larger
facilities in the Bay Area, at
times.
There were a few complaints.
At times, the sound didn't come
off as well as some thought that it
should. And there was the gen
eral feeling that Herbie didn't
play long enough.
But still — can one ever get
enough of a good thing?

him that inimitable "wah-wah" sound. Herbie, on the right
attends soulfully to his keyboard.
While roaming through the
cables and props backstage at
Memorial Auditorium Saturday
night, a longtime fan of Herbert
Jeffery Hancock was unable to
recognize the star. His charac
teristic goatee, sideburns, and
enormous afro were missing.
But as the band slowly took its
place on the dimly lit stage and
the first familiar waves of jazz
began to flow, there was no mis
take — it was Herbie.
Surrounded on all sides by
keyboards ranging from piano to
synthesizer to things too com
plicated to mention here, Herbie
initiated the crowd — still
somewhat numb from standing
in line in the cold — with early
Hancock, including "Waterme
lon Man."
As it was with the look, the
sound was new. What was it that
brought on the new Herbie Han
cock in such a short time?
Buddhism
"On a gig one time, we had
been up all night, and I was re
ally tired; we all were. We
started the set with 'Toys,'
which starts with a bass solo," he
explained. At the time, Han
cock's bassist was long-time
friend, Mchezaju Buster Wil
liams, a believer in Nicerin
Shoshu Buddhism.
"That solo Mchezaju played
was so remarkable, so rich, the
only word I can use is pro
found," Hancock said. "It was so
full of energy that I thought it
was the best thing I'd heard on
the instrument. It filled the
band, me, the whole room with
energy. Now 1 knew that
Mchezaju had been into some
thing," Herbie said, "but lhad to
know exactly what it was —
right then."
What it was was Nicerin
Shoshu Buddhism. Buster had
been reading from the Lotus
Sutra, studying the ideas of
Nicherin Daishonin, and chant- ,
ing "Nam-Myoho-Rnege-Kyo":
the fusion of self with the univ
ersal laws of cause and effect
through sound, vibration and
energy.
It worked
Whatever it was, it worked for
Herbie Hancock too, for it
changed his entire career. He

moved to Los Angeles, and
112 changed the personel of his en
: tire band — returning only
' saxophonist Benny Maupin—
who is still an integral part of
i Hancock's music.
He recorded Head Hunters,
now recognized as the largest
selling record of its kind. From
that album came "Chameleon,"
still the most recognizable Han
cock hit.
Herbie said the reorganization
of his spiritual energies led him
to a new-found sympathy with
the people. "I got much more in
touch with myself and thus
could reach many."
Hancock moved on to perform
some of the cuts from his latest
album, Secrets, including -
"Doin' It "j and "Gentle
Thoughts," which boasts one of
the most beautiful combinations
of electric piano theme and
Maupin lyricon solos he has ever
composed.
Wah Wah
While taking a short break, the
band left the stage to a stunning
guitar set by Herbie's team
composer Wah Wah Watson.
Anyone who wondered why he
was called "Wah Wah" was not
left in the dark for long.
Watson has been with Han
cock almost from the beginning.
And has just recently released
his first solo album entitled
Elementary.
The guitar sound creations he
made through the use of numer
ous slides, picks, and the popu
lar voice bag could have put
many an English rock star to
shame.

was the best thing I'd heard on
the instrument. It filled the
band, me, the whole room with
energy. Now 1 knew that
Mchezaju had been into some
thing," Herbie said, "but lhad to
know exactly what it was —
right then."
What it was was Nicerin
Shoshu Buddhism. Buster had
been reading from the Lotus
Sutra, studying the ideas of
Nicherin Daishonin, and chant- ,
ing "Nam-Myoho-Rnege-Kyo":
the fusion of self with the univ
ersal laws of cause and effect
through sound, vibration and
energy.
It worked
Whatever it was, it worked for
Herbie Hancock too, for it
changed his entire career. He

moved to Los Angeles, and
112 changed the personel of his en
: tire band — returning only
' saxophonist Benny Maupin—
who is still an integral part of
i Hancock's music.
He recorded Head Hunters,
now recognized as the largest
selling record of its kind. From
that album came "Chameleon,"
still the most recognizable Han
cock hit.
Herbie said the reorganization
of his spiritual energies led him
to a new-found sympathy with
the people. "I got much more in
touch with myself and thus
could reach many."
Hancock moved on to perform
some of the cuts from his latest
album, Secrets, including -
"Doin' It "j and "Gentle
Thoughts," which boasts one of
the most beautiful combinations
of electric piano theme and
Maupin lyricon solos he has ever
composed.
Wah Wah
While taking a short break, the
band left the stage to a stunning
guitar set by Herbie's team
composer Wah Wah Watson.
Anyone who wondered why he
was called "Wah Wah" was not
left in the dark for long.
Watson has been with Han
cock almost from the beginning.
And has just recently released
his first solo album entitled
Elementary.
The guitar sound creations he
made through the use of numer
ous slides, picks, and the popu
lar voice bag could have put
many an English rock star to
shame.
The energy from his solo car
ried through the crowd as they
chanted and cheered in amaze
ment.
The remainder of Herbie's
band includes bassist Paul
Jackson who hails from the Bay
Area. Herbie says he learned a lot
about funk from Paul, and he
depends on that "struttin' confi
dent bass playing" for much of
the attitude of his new music.
Drummer Jones Levi, of Oak
land, lived just two blocks from
Jackson, who brought Levi to
Herbie's drummer auditions
which were being held on a
Monday and Tuesday. Jackson

told Herbie they would be down
on Monday and that he could
cancel his Tuesday auditions.
He was sure of that.
Soulful side
Levi's career has tended to
ward the soulful side of music
with such artists as Al Green,
Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robin
son, and Marvin Gaye. And if
you check the fine print, you'll
notice he is the writer and ar
ranger of Don Cornelius' Soul
Train theme.
After closing with "Cantelope
Island," also from Secrets, Wah
Wah initiated the encore with a
heavy solo that mellowed into
the pounding theme of
"Spider," another new release.
Despite the few technical
problems that caused the show
to start a few minutes late, it
came off smoothly. The promot
ers and ASSU Special Events
crew are to be commended for
that, which is more than can be
said for many of the larger
facilities in the Bay Area, at
times.
There were a few complaints.
At times, the sound didn't come
off as well as some thought that it
should. And there was the gen
eral feeling that Herbie didn't
play long enough.
But still — can one ever get
enough of a good thing?

him that inimitable "wah-wah" sound. Herbie, on the right
attends soulfully to his keyboard.
While roaming through the
cables and props backstage at
Memorial Auditorium Saturday
night, a longtime fan of Herbert
Jeffery Hancock was unable to
recognize the star. His charac
teristic goatee, sideburns, and
enormous afro were missing.
But as the band slowly took its
place on the dimly lit stage and
the first familiar waves of jazz
began to flow, there was no mis
take — it was Herbie.
Surrounded on all sides by
keyboards ranging from piano to
synthesizer to things too com
plicated to mention here, Herbie
initiated the crowd — still
somewhat numb from standing
in line in the cold — with early
Hancock, including "Waterme
lon Man."
As it was with the look, the
sound was new. What was it that
brought on the new Herbie Han
cock in such a short time?
Buddhism
"On a gig one time, we had
been up all night, and I was re
ally tired; we all were. We
started the set with 'Toys,'
which starts with a bass solo," he
explained. At the time, Han
cock's bassist was long-time
friend, Mchezaju Buster Wil
liams, a believer in Nicerin
Shoshu Buddhism.
"That solo Mchezaju played
was so remarkable, so rich, the
only word I can use is pro
found," Hancock said. "It was so
full of energy that I thought it
was the best thing I'd heard on
the instrument. It filled the
band, me, the whole room with
energy. Now 1 knew that
