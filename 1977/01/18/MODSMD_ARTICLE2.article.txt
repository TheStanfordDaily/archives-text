# Sorensen bows out, averts Senate fight
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Theodore
Sorensen yesterday withdrew as
President-elect Jimmy Carter's
nominee to head the Central Intelli
gence Agency, to avoid a Senate con
firmation fight he said would have
handicapped the new administration.
Carter agreed withdrawal was the
best way out of the controversy about
Sorensen's record and credentials for
the top intelligence post, but said he
regretted the loss of "an extremely
talented and dedicated man."
A spokesman said Carter will choose
a new nominee for the CIA post some
time after the inauguration on Thurs
day. Until a new appointee is named
and confirmed, the CIA apparently
will be run by E. Henry Knoche, a 25-
year agency veteran now serving as
deputy director.
While Sorensen was becoming the
first casualty of the new administra
tion, three top-level Carter appointees
appeared before the Senate commit
tees at relatively routine confirmation
proceedings. Only one, Atty. Gen.-
designate Griffin Bell, faced con
troversy, and his approval seemed vir
tually assured despite his critics.
Personal attacks
Sorensen withdrew after denounc
ing "scurrilous and unfounded per
sonal attacks against me" by oppo
nents who questioned his use of clas
sified documents in the administra
tion of John Kennedy and his draft

classification as a conscientious objec
tor.
The 48-year-old New York attorney,
once Kennedy's right-hand man, said
the opposition really stemmed from
disagreement with his view of the way
the CIA should function.
Sorensen told the Senate Intelli
gence Committee he was withdrawing
because there was enough opposition
to point to a divisive controversy about
his confirmation.
Regretted decision
He said he used a pay telephone in
the Senate office building to tell Carter
of his decision, minutes before the ini
tial committee hearing on his nomina
tion. "He regretted it very much,"
Sorensen said. But Carter concurred,
and didn't try to change Sorensen's
mind.
"The governor and I jointly reached
a conclusion . . . that there is substan
tial opposition which would result
either in my rejection, which would
handicap this administration as it gets
off to a new start, or result in my being
confirmed by a narrow vote, which
would handicap my effectiveness as I
got off to a start," Sorensen said.
In Plains, Ga., Carter said Sorensen's
action was "designed to spare the ad
ministration and the country the ef
fects of a divisive and emotional con
troversy.
"I deeply regret this situation," Car
ter said.

his confirmation.
Regretted decision
He said he used a pay telephone in
the Senate office building to tell Carter
of his decision, minutes before the ini
tial committee hearing on his nomina
tion. "He regretted it very much,"
Sorensen said. But Carter concurred,
and didn't try to change Sorensen's
mind.
"The governor and I jointly reached
a conclusion . . . that there is substan
tial opposition which would result
either in my rejection, which would
handicap this administration as it gets
off to a new start, or result in my being
confirmed by a narrow vote, which
would handicap my effectiveness as I
got off to a start," Sorensen said.
In Plains, Ga., Carter said Sorensen's
action was "designed to spare the ad
ministration and the country the ef
fects of a divisive and emotional con
troversy.
"I deeply regret this situation," Car
ter said.
Washington (AP) — Theodore
Sorensen yesterday withdrew as
President-elect Jimmy Carter's
nominee to head the Central Intelli
gence Agency, to avoid a Senate con
firmation fight he said would have
handicapped the new administration.
Carter agreed withdrawal was the
best way out of the controversy about
Sorensen's record and credentials for
the top intelligence post, but said he
regretted the loss of "an extremely
talented and dedicated man."
A spokesman said Carter will choose
a new nominee for the CIA post some
time after the inauguration on Thurs
day. Until a new appointee is named
and confirmed, the CIA apparently
will be run by E. Henry Knoche, a 25-
year agency veteran now serving as
deputy director.
While Sorensen was becoming the
first casualty of the new administra
tion, three top-level Carter appointees
appeared before the Senate commit
tees at relatively routine confirmation
proceedings. Only one, Atty. Gen.-
designate Griffin Bell, faced con
troversy, and his approval seemed vir
tually assured despite his critics.
Personal attacks
Sorensen withdrew after denounc
ing "scurrilous and unfounded per
sonal attacks against me" by oppo
nents who questioned his use of clas
sified documents in the administra
tion of John Kennedy and his draft

classification as a conscientious objec
tor.
The 48-year-old New York attorney,
once Kennedy's right-hand man, said
the opposition really stemmed from
disagreement with his view of the way
the CIA should function.
Sorensen told the Senate Intelli
gence Committee he was withdrawing
because there was enough opposition
to point to a divisive controversy about
his confirmation.
Regretted decision
He said he used a pay telephone in
the Senate office building to tell Carter
of his decision, minutes before the ini
tial committee hearing on his nomina
tion. "He regretted it very much,"
Sorensen said. But Carter concurred,
and didn't try to change Sorensen's
mind.
