# Baker highlights symphony concert
## 
### David L. Miller 
Contralto Janet Baker excelled
Wednesday evening as she
saved the San Francisco Sym
phony's opening concert of the
week in the War Memorial Opera
House.
Performing Franz Joseph
Haydn's Arianna a Naxos,
which for some unknown reason
the symphony program trans
lated into German, Baker exhi
bited stunning dynamic control
and incredible emotional ex
pression through her clear deep
voice and flawless stage pre
sence.
Although Haydn is known
primarily for his instrumental

works, never having possessed
the genius for 18th century
dramatic composition as did
Mozart and Handel, his vocal
works are effective and precise.
In some ways, the restraint and
simplicity of his operatic com
positions are refreshing in com
parison to the artificial and often
extravagant librettos of his time,
but none of his works compare to
Mozart's Figaro or Don
Giovanni.
Myth of Ariadne
Haydn's Ariannci is based on
the tragic myth of Ariadne, King
Mino's daughter who was de
serted by her husband Theseus
on the Aegean Islend of Naxos.
Baker portrayed Ariadne's suf

fering sensitively and power
fully. Her body motions rising
and falling with the intensity of
the vocalizations, Baker dazzled
the audience with rapidly articu
lated recitatives, crisp attacks
and passionate operatic drama.
She tapped a seeming ocean of
power in a strong, direct man
ner. Her tremelos danced. Her
modulations were clean and
energetic. Her transitions
flowed, and her flexible voice
quality packed the aria with an
agitating, soul-searing pathos.
At one point, in a delightful
musical conversation, Baker im
itated the timbre of the cellos in a
deep meditative manner. Later,
during the interlude before the
denouement, she sang a series of
chromatic progressions with
strength and restraint, beauti
fully describing Ariadne's
climbing up the rock and her
hopeless despair.
Although Haydn's works are

not acrobatic, Baker ended the
aria with long sustained pas
sages, potent operatic acting,
and an almost unbelievable in
tensity that brought much of the
less-than-capacity crowd to its
feet with shouts of encore and
bravo.
Evening opener
The evening opened with
Haydn's Overture to Armida, a
lovely work that conductor Seiji
Ozawa interpreted intelligently.
The piece suffered, however,
from a few mushy violin entr
ances and Ozawa's failure to
coax a fuller, richer orchestral
sound. Nevertheless, the Alleg
retto was alluring and the piece
short and sweet, though not
monumental.
Ozawa closed the evening
with Anton Bruckner's Sym
phony No. 2., an odd choice, dull
in sections, and anti-climatic to
Baker's performance. By far the
worst of his symphonies, Bruck

ner's No. 2 came in response
to attacks on his first symphony,
and his lack of confidence is
noticeable. The orchestra's lack
of vigor and inability to perform
the crisp majestic attacks and ar
ticulations necessary for Bruck
ner compounded the problems.
But it played the slow
melodic sections smoothly,
especially the second movement
which featured an eerie french
horn lucidly unravelling the
main theme. The Scherzo was
short and exciting, and through
out the piece, Ozawa's excellent
use of Bruckner's frequenj,_
pauses maximized the work's
emotional depth and sensitivity.
An unusual number of listen
ers were asleep during the finale.
It could have been the piece's
quality, or perhaps the audience
was simply resting after Janet
Baker's energetic performance.
In any event, Baker was clearly
the evening's highpoint.
