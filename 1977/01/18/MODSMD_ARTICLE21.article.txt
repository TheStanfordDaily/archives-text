# Al lacks energy

### Michael O'Cailahan 
"Hey, is this a Super Ses
sion?" came the drunken voice
from the crowd.
Onstage, Al Kooper grabbed a
microphone and snarled, "No,
man. This is a Stupor Session."
Yes, the Old Waldorf was
strangely dead as Al ("Not
Alice. . .") Kooper and Michael
Bloomfield stumbled through
the late show Friday night, de
spite the occurence of four earth
quakes.
Piano man Mark Naftalin
opened and went through a set of
forgettable bluesy songs, play
ing well but having no spark in
his voice, thereby setting the
tone for the evening. Then Al
Kooper, looking like a TV-movie
version of a rock star, and Mike
Bloomfield trooped onstage
with a gang of 12.
At a tender age, Bloomfield

escaped from his family in
Chicago and began haunting
blues joints on the South Side,
eventually developing into one
of the finest white blues
guitarists. Much of his skill was
not evident, possibly due to his
not playing for three months be
cause of bursitis in his hands.
"Now we'regoing to doa song
I hate," said Kooper from behi nd
black shades, finally bowing to
the hoarse cries of one patron for
"Season of the Witch." The
studs on his belt flashed in the
lights and his mastery of the
keyboard began to shine as well.
Bloomfield joined in on this and
"Hey, Mr. Fantasy" and they al
most overcame their energy
shortage. Almost.
Due to bickering between the
Waldorf's manager and Kooper's
secretary, the show closed after
one night. No great loss to the
music scene.
