## 
### Marc Strassman 
"Most people don't know that
women have been making films
from the beginning of the
cinema," says Anne Webber, a
graduate student in film and one
of the organizers of a new movie
series, "Feature Films by Wo
men."
The series, which began Jan.
11 with a showing of Germaine
Dulac's The Smiling Madame
Beudet, will continue every
Tuesday night for the remainder
of the quarter.
"The series will continue to
night," Webber said, "with a
screening of some of Maya
Deren's films, including her very
influential and fascinating
Meshes of the Afternoon. In
Meshes," according to Webber,
"Deren weaves an imaginative
cinematic dream out of objects
seen and moments experienced
by her.
"Deren came to film through
dance," Webber continued,
"and many of her films use the
camera as a creative component
of choreography.
"Other Deren films that will be
shown the same night show her
growing concern with ritual,
such as Ritual in Transfigured
Time and Meditation on Vio
lence, a dance film choreograph
ing the movements and rhythms
of Chinese schools of boxing,"
Webber said.
"The following week, January
25," Webber continued, "we'll
be showing a surrealist film,
Germaine Dulac's The Seashell
and the Clergyman, based on a
script by Antonin Artaud and for
which Dulac was violently at
tacked by Artaud and others for
having transformed his script
and made 'a feminine film.' "
"The other film showing that
night, Jan. 25," said Kate Spohr,
a graduate student in film and

another one of the series' or
ganizers, "will be Agnes Varda's
Lion's Love, a feature about the
filmmaker Shirley Clarke trying
to make a movie in Los Angeles
around the characters of Viva (an
Andy Warhol minion) and
Jerome Ragni (one of the author's
of Hair), and incorporating the
assassination of Robert Ken
nedy, which occurred while the
film was being shot."
Other films in the series in
clude:
—Mai Zetterling's The Girls, a
modern treatment of Aris
tophanes' Lysistrata, a satire on
the sexual strike of the women of
Athens' against the belligerency
of their oppressors, showing
Feb. 1;
—Marguerite Duras' Destroy,
She Said, to be shown in place
of her previously scheduled
Women of the Ganges, on Feb. 8;
—Broder Carl, by Susan Son
tag, a major American critic
known for her writing on mod
ern aesthetics and the author of
Against Interpretation and
Styles of Radical Will, showing
Feb. 15;
— Sarah Muldoror's Sam
bizanga, made in Angola during
the liberation struggle and deal
ing with the plight of a young
African couple and their con
frontation with the colonial re
gime, showing on Feb. 22;
—Yvonne Rainer's Film About
a Woman Who, a formalist and
complex exploration of a wo
man's relationship to those
around her and to herself, to be
shown March 1.
The last film will be March 8,
International Women's Day.
Shown that night will be Chantal
Ackerman's Jeanne Dielman, "a
fictional treatment of three days
in the life of a housewife in Brus
sels in which Ackerman illumi
nates the details of the woman's

day and reveals her routine in a
cinematically radical way," ac
cording to Webber. "Ackerman
tries to show what goes on bet
ween the images that are nor
mally seen when housewives are
portrayed," she added.
The series will also include
short films by major experimen
tal women flimmakers.
The series has a number of
aims, according to Spohr. "One
of these is to show that women
not only have been making films
since the earliest days of cinema,
but have been making major con

tributions to the development of
film as an art form," she said.
Webber noted that one of the
goals of the series is to focus at
tention on the fact that women,
largely excluded form the
mainstream of feature film
directing since the 19205, have
nonetheless been able to make
significant contributions to film
as an art form.
In addition, "the series hopes
to provide a forum for the dis
cussion of issues relating to
women and films," Spohr said,
and Webber added that there

will be discussions following
the films each week.
The series itself is being spon
sored by the Center for Research
on Women (CROW) and has re
ceived funding from the Dean of
Craduate Studies; the Dean of
Humanities; the Dean of Under
graduate Studies; the ASSU
Council of Presidents; Leah Kap
lan, Assistant Dean, Advising
and Women's Affairs; and the
Office of Student Activities.
The screenings take place in
Cubberley Auditorium, and ad
mission is $1.50.

25," Webber continued, "we'll
be showing a surrealist film,
Germaine Dulac's The Seashell
and the Clergyman, based on a
script by Antonin Artaud and for
which Dulac was violently at
tacked by Artaud and others for
having transformed his script
and made 'a feminine film.' "
"The other film showing that
night, Jan. 25," said Kate Spohr,
a graduate student in film and

another one of the series' or
ganizers, "will be Agnes Varda's
Lion's Love, a feature about the
filmmaker Shirley Clarke trying
to make a movie in Los Angeles
around the characters of Viva (an
Andy Warhol minion) and
Jerome Ragni (one of the author's
of Hair), and incorporating the
assassination of Robert Ken
nedy, which occurred while the
film was being shot."
Other films in the series in
clude:

modern treatment of Aris
tophanes' Lysistrata, a satire on

of their oppressors, showing
Feb. 1;
—Marguerite Duras' Destroy,
She Said, to be shown in place
of her previously scheduled
Women of the Ganges, on Feb. 8;

ern aesthetics and the author of
Against Interpretation and
Styles of Radical Will, showing
Feb. 15;
— Sarah Muldoror's Sam
bizanga, made in Angola during
the liberation struggle and deal
ing with the plight of a young
African couple and their con
frontation with the colonial re
gime, showing on Feb. 22;
—Yvonne Rainer's Film About
a Woman Who, a formalist and
complex exploration of a wo
man's relationship to those

The last film will be March 8,
International Women's Day.
Shown that night will be Chantal
Ackerman's Jeanne Dielman, "a
fictional treatment of three days
in the life of a housewife in Brus
sels in which Ackerman illumi
nates the details of the woman's

day and reveals her routine in a
cinematically radical way," ac
cording to Webber. "Ackerman
tries to show what goes on bet
ween the images that are nor
mally seen when housewives are
portrayed," she added.
The series will also include
short films by major experimen
tal women flimmakers.
The series has a number of
aims, according to Spohr. "One
of these is to show that women
not only have been making films
since the earliest days of cinema,
but have been making major con

tributions to the development of
film as an art form," she said.
Webber noted that one of the
goals of the series is to focus at
tention on the fact that women,
largely excluded form the
mainstream of feature film
directing since the 19205, have
nonetheless been able to make
significant contributions to film
as an art form.
In addition, "the series hopes
to provide a forum for the dis
cussion of issues relating to
women and films," Spohr said,
and Webber added that there

will be discussions following
the films each week.
The series itself is being spon
sored by the Center for Research
on Women (CROW) and has re
ceived funding from the Dean of
Craduate Studies; the Dean of
Humanities; the Dean of Under
graduate Studies; the ASSU
Council of Presidents; Leah Kap
lan, Assistant Dean, Advising
and Women's Affairs; and the
Office of Student Activities.
The screenings take place in
Cubberley Auditorium, and ad
mission is $1.50.
"Most people don't know that
women have been making films
from the beginning of the
cinema," says Anne Webber, a
graduate student in film and one
of the organizers of a new movie
series, "Feature Films by Wo
men."
The series, which began Jan.
11 with a showing of Germaine
Dulac's The Smiling Madame
Beudet, will continue every
Tuesday night for the remainder
of the quarter.
"The series will continue to
night," Webber said, "with a
screening of some of Maya
Deren's films, including her very
influential and fascinating
Meshes of the Afternoon. In
Meshes," according to Webber,
"Deren weaves an imaginative
cinematic dream out of objects
seen and moments experienced
by her.
"Deren came to film through
dance," Webber continued,
"and many of her films use the
camera as a creative component
of choreography.
"Other Deren films that will be
shown the same night show her
growing concern with ritual,
such as Ritual in Transfigured
Time and Meditation on Vio
lence, a dance film choreograph
ing the movements and rhythms
of Chinese schools of boxing,"
Webber said.

tries to show what goes on bet
ween the images that are nor
mally seen when housewives are
portrayed," she added.
The series will also include
short films by major experimen
tal women flimmakers.
The series has a number of
aims, according to Spohr. "One
of these is to show that women
not only have been making films
since the earliest days of cinema,
but have been making major con

tributions to the development of
film as an art form," she said.
Webber noted that one of the
goals of the series is to focus at
tention on the fact that women,
largely excluded form the
mainstream of feature film
directing since the 19205, have
nonetheless been able to make
significant contributions to film
as an art form.
In addition, "the series hopes
to provide a forum for the dis
cussion of issues relating to
women and films," Spohr said,
and Webber added that there

will be discussions following
the films each week.
The series itself is being spon
sored by the Center for Research
on Women (CROW) and has re
ceived funding from the Dean of
Craduate Studies; the Dean of
Humanities; the Dean of Under
graduate Studies; the ASSU
Council of Presidents; Leah Kap
lan, Assistant Dean, Advising
and Women's Affairs; and the
Office of Student Activities.
The screenings take place in
Cubberley Auditorium, and ad
mission is $1.50.
"Most people don't know that
women have been making films
from the beginning of the
cinema," says Anne Webber, a
graduate student in film and one
of the organizers of a new movie
series, "Feature Films by Wo
men."
The series, which began Jan.
11 with a showing of Germaine
Dulac's The Smiling Madame
Beudet, will continue every
Tuesday night for the remainder
of the quarter.
"The series will continue to
night," Webber said, "with a
screening of some of Maya
Deren's films, including her very
influential and fascinating
Meshes of the Afternoon. In
Meshes," according to Webber,
"Deren weaves an imaginative
cinematic dream out of objects
seen and moments experienced
by her.
"Deren came to film through
dance," Webber continued,
"and many of her films use the
camera as a creative component
of choreography.
"Other Deren films that will be
shown the same night show her
growing concern with ritual,
such as Ritual in Transfigured
Time and Meditation on Vio
lence, a dance film choreograph
ing the movements and rhythms
of Chinese schools of boxing,"
Webber said.
"The following week, January
25," Webber continued, "we'll
be showing a surrealist film,
Germaine Dulac's The Seashell
and the Clergyman, based on a
script by Antonin Artaud and for
which Dulac was violently at
tacked by Artaud and others for
having transformed his script
and made 'a feminine film.' "
"The other film showing that
night, Jan. 25," said Kate Spohr,
a graduate student in film and

another one of the series' or
ganizers, "will be Agnes Varda's
Lion's Love, a feature about the
filmmaker Shirley Clarke trying
to make a movie in Los Angeles
around the characters of Viva (an
Andy Warhol minion) and
Jerome Ragni (one of the author's
of Hair), and incorporating the
assassination of Robert Ken
nedy, which occurred while the
film was being shot."
Other films in the series in
clude:
—Mai Zetterling's The Girls, a
modern treatment of Aris
tophanes' Lysistrata, a satire on
the sexual strike of the women of
Athens' against the belligerency
of their oppressors, showing
Feb. 1;
—Marguerite Duras' Destroy,
She Said, to be shown in place
of her previously scheduled
Women of the Ganges, on Feb. 8;
