# Grover gives 'tight' show
## 
### Roy S. Johnson 
Few popular music concerts
can be called "tight" these days.
The wonders of the recording
studio have forced us to love our
musical heroes on records, only
to be driven to lowly disap
pointment by their seemingly
inept in-person performances.
And so with jazz shows, we
are often treated to what resem
bles a lackluster jam session.
Nice solos. Mellow touch. Lots
of feeling. But sometimes — too
slow and no show.
But aahhh, praise to those
musical greats who can both per
form my music and keep me
there with them. Awake.
Praise to jazz saxophonist
Grover Washington Jr. and his
part-Creator, mostly-keyboard
genius composer Bob James. To
gether, they drew the near
capacity crowd of the Oakland
Paramount Theater close to jazz
heaven with an unusually stun
ning show last Friday evening.
No frills
There were no frills, flashing
lights, or mountainous

backdrops. Just the music and
the mood, which were more than
enough to reassure me that con
certs can be well done without
being distracting, and that the
heroes can sound better Than
their albums — without blowing
me through the back of the thea
ter.
After a late start (which is un
usual for the Paramount) James
and Washington were greeted
thunderously as they meandered
through the equipment to the
center of the stage. James took
his place at the grand piano,
while Washington was cen
terstage surrounded by his three
— the soprano, alto and tenor
saxophones.
An intricately smooth and
silky duet flowed into the "Mis
ter Magic" from Washington's
album of the same name. Mean
while the five-piece back-up
band clumsily made their way
onto the stage.
Before a short break about an
hour later, the group had spun
between the respective hits of
the two artists. A classic render
tion of the popular "Feel Like

Makin' Love" brought the crowd
to life, while the sweetness of
James' own creations brought
forth the mellow sighs of ap
provement along the way.
Entrancing
Much of the themes of James'
later works are done on the elec
tric piano. His mastery of the in
strument proved to be the most
entrancing aspect of his music.
From Bob James Three, his
most popular album to date, he
offered artistic versions of
"Storm King," "Jamaica
Farewell," and "One Mint
Julep."
Technically, the show was
also superb. The lighting com
plimented the music with per
fectly suited blues and reds. And
not one note was missed through
the sound system — from the
crisp electric piano to the crackl
ing beat of the percussion.
For an encore, Washington
and James lead the group plus a
special-guest four-piece horn
section through James'
"Westchester Lady."
Almost too tight to handle.
