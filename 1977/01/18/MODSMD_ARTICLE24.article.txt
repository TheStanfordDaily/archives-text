State to pay employes' legal fees
Sacramento — Brown administration officials
said yesterday the state will pay for the legal de
fense of state employes indicted for patient deaths
at Camarillo State Hospital.
Health Department spokesman Bob Nance said
Mario Obledo, Cov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s secretary
of health and welfare, decided to provide attorneys
for four employes indicted by the Ventura County
grand jury on the advice of Health Department di
rector Jerome Lackner and department troub
leshooter Raymond Procunier.
Eight employes were originally indicted, but the
Ventura County district attorney has recommended
that four indictments be dropped.
Nance said state law gives departments dis
cretionary power to pay reasonable fees for attor
neys to defend employes charged with offenses al
legedly committed in the execution of their duties.
The indictments were issued after two weeks of
testimony on 12 suspicious deaths at the mental
hospital and a grand jury review 0f42 other deaths.
Charges of neglect and manslaughter were dis
missed against four employes after the district at
torney ruled there was insufficient evidence for
prosecution.
But a Camarillo doctor and three hospital tachni
cians still tace felony manslaughter and conspiracy
charges involving two patient deaths.
Judge delays S.F. elderly eviction
San Francisco — The eviction of some 70 elderly
residents from a low-rent hotel was postponed yes
terday after an eleventh-hour appeal to the judge
who had ordered the eviction.
Superior Court Judge Ira Brown Jr. met in an
after-hours court session with Police Chief Charles
Gain and agreed to postpone the eviction until
March 4.
The delay will give the city Housing Authority
time to try to purchase the International Hotel from
the owners. Four Seas Investment Corp., which
wants the tenants evicted so it can demolish the
ancient structure and erect a new building.
Gain told Brown that he had reports that some
tenants were armed with automatic weapons and
others were storing gasoline for use in fighting
sheriff's deputies in the eviction, scheduled for
early this morning.
Brown said he did not want to "succumb to mob
violence" but felt a postponement would be pru
dent.
The stay came after a flurry of last-minute appe
als to higher courts.
Earlier yesterday, the state Court of Appeal de
nied separate requests from the Housing Authority
and from Sheriff Richard Hongisto.
The housing agency had asked the court Friday

to block the eviction until a Feb. 1 court hearing on
the city's efforts to assert eminent domain and buy
the disputed building at the edge of Chinatown.
Then Hongisto — sentenced to five days in jail for
contempt because he failed to evict the tenants pre
viously — asked the California Supreme Court to
postpone eviction "in the name of preserving pub
lic safety" and "preventing unnecessary
bloodshed."
Brown foresees no tax increase
San Diego — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said again
yesterday that he won't raise taxes this year or in the
foreseeable future.
"I think local government can live within a limit
and state government can live within the limit of
not raising taxes any further," he told a news con
ference.
Crime, said Brown, must be made to cost more
because "the problem is that for many people crime
looks like a good deal."
Criminals "are not caught, they make a lot of
money out of it and it seems to be very prevalent in
many neighborhoods," he said.
In San Diego to discuss criminal justice with
officials, he called reporters together to talk about
his proposals for property tax and senior citizen
renter relief.
Brown has proposed sending rebate checks of up
to $700 to about 1.9 million California homeowners
this year and increasing rebates to 416,000 senior
citizens who pay rent.
Ford sends Congress final budget
Washington — President Gerald Ford sent a $440
billion federal budget yesterday to a Congress al
ready looking beyond it to one drawn closer to
President-elect Jimmy Carter's specifications.
"We'll be watching for the Carter amendments,"
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill told reporters.
Calling Ford a lame duck president, O'Neill said
"No one pays much attention to what a lame duck
president has to say. ... With seven and one-half
million people unemployed, this budget is insuffi
cient."
House Budget Committee Chairman Robert
Giaime (D-Conn.), said at a news conference, "I
expect the Congress and the new administration to
move more positively than does this budget toward
faster economic growth and substantially different
budget priorities."
He said his committee expects Carter's recom
mendations for immediate economic stimulus as
early as next week and Congress could enact them
by the end of March. The new administration's
amendments to Ford's budget, which is for the next
fiscal year, should be along in about a month, he
added.

Interceptions give AFC 24-14 win
Seattle — Cornerback Mel Blount of the
Pittsburgh Steelers intercepted one pass to kill a
scoring threat, then stole another to set up Ken
Anderson's second touchdown pass of the game,
helping lead the American Conference to a 24-14
Pro Bowl victory last night over the National Con
ference.
Anderson, the quarterback of the Cincinnati
Bengals, connected with San Diego wide receiver
Charlie Joiner on a 12-yard touchdown pass in the
second period, then put the game out of reach with
6:47 to play, finding Oakland's Cliff Branch on a
27-yarder.
About midway in the fourth period, with the NFC
trying to wipe out the AFC's 17-14 lead, Blount
picked off a pass by St. Louis' Jim Hart in the end
zone, thwarting an NFC drive to the Americans'
12-yard line.
Pope favors Anglican-Catholic unity
Vatican City — Pope Paul VI has approved in
principle an historic proposal to reunite the Angli
can and Roman Catholic churches, Vatican officials
said yesterday.
But they described as unfortunate a plea by a
leading Anglican newspaper that Pope Paul, 79,
resign in favor of a younger man to help heal Christ
ian divisions.
A joint high-level commission of Catholic and
Anglican scholars is scheduled to publish a docu
ment Thursday recommending an end to the 443-
year-old schism and calling for recognition of the
pontiff in Rome as over-all patriarch.
The reunification document, to be released in
London, is not binding on either church but is
meant as the basis for further discussion by
bishops, theologians and ordinary believers on
both sides.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except local morning fog
and low clouds. Continued cool nights. Lows to
night in the 30s to low 40s. Highs both days in
upper 40s and 50s.
