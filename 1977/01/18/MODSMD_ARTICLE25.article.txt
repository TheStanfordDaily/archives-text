# Many students fall ill
## Flu bug hits campus 
### Yvonne Randle 
With the threat of a swine flu
epidemic apparently over, the univer
sity is now faced with a stomach flu
outbreak. This malady has apparently
affected a significant portion of the
campus, but according to James
McClenahan, director at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, this is not unusual
for this time of year.
The number of cases of stomach flu
on campus is not known. However, ac
cording to McClenahan, there have
been many phone calls and a few
people reporting to Cowell Student
Health Center.
A very, small number of students
were admitted to the infirmary this
weekend, but there was "no overload
of cases," according to a secretary in
McClenahan's office.
Most students are not going to Cow
ell because, as one student put it, "1
was too sick to go to Cowell." He com
plained of feeling so nauseous that it
was an effort to walk to the restroom in
his hall.
Caused by a virus, stomach flu,

otherwise known as gastrointestinal
flu, produces nausea, cramps and
diarrhea, and usually lasts from 24 to
48 hours, according to McClenahan.
He stated that the illness is thought to
be transmitted by direct contact with
an infected person through acts such
as using the same drinking cup or kis
sing.
However, he also said there is evi
dence that it might be transmitted in
other ways, such as through the air.
The disease is not restricted to a
specific area of campus although the
virus will usually spread more rapidly
in close living conditions, McClena
han said. One student reported that
about 10 persons in Hurlburt, a house
of 50 persons, had contracted the
stomach flu.
About one-third of the members of
Kappa Sigma fraternity fell victim to
the virus last week.
Treatment for the stomach flu is al
most the same as for a cold. Cowell
recommends that victims rest, eat
lightly, drink clear fluids, and, if the
flu is accompanied by a headache, take
aspirin three times a day.
McClenahan said that when one
contracts the illness, it is best to take it
easy and "sit it out."
