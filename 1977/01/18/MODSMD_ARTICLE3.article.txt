# Profs predict new farm policy
## 
### Marc Strassman Third of a five-part series 
on the Carter administration
"The Carter administration is likely
to be considerably more interven
tionist in its agricultural policy than
its predecessor," says Roger Gray, a
professor at the Food Research Insti
tute here.
Gray said that Robert Bergland,
named by Garter to be secretary of ag
riculture, will probably tend towards
the farm policy of his fellow Minneso
tans, Sen. Hubert Humphrey and Vice
President-elect Walter Mondale. This
will mean more reliance on farm price
supports and a system of grain re
serves, according to Gray.
Gray said that Bergland seems to
favor a system in which farmers rather
than the government would hold the
reserves, since such an arrangment
would be less costly to the govern
ment.
He said he doubted that the new ag
ricultural policies would have much of
an effect on food prices, which have
risen relatively slowly since the
1973-74 period of rapid inflation.
Grain embargoes
Gray commented further that "Any
administration is likely to be sensi
tive" about imposing grain embargoes
in the future. A reversal of Carter's
campaign promise not to implement
such a policy would be "extremely un
likely," said Gray, because Bergland
has a farming operation himself and
was adversely affected by past grain
embargoes.
Gray said that inevitably both com
mercial and humanitarian exports of
American grain will remain at their
current high levels or increase even
further.
American diet
Even in the wake of a report recently
issued by the Senate Select Committee
on Nutrition and Human Needs, which
said American diets contain too many
fats and refined sugars, Gray said he
doubted that the Carter Administra
tion would undertake a "serious major
initiative" to improve the average diet.
"It's fundamentally a question of
education," said Gray, "and most
people now don't even eat as well as
they know they should."

Gray discounted theories that the
world was entering a period of severe
weather that was likely to seriously ef
fect the planet's food production
capacity. He said changes in the
weather seem to be "more sporadic
than cyclical" and that in any case
their pace is exceedingly slow.
New fuels
Thomas Conolly, professor and as
sociate chairman of the mechanical
engineering department, said he ex
pects uranium and coal to provide the
major share of additional electric plant
fuels during the period of the Carter
presidency.
He said the current state of coal
liquification technology still pro
duces fuel that is more expensive than
oil. He said substantial progress in this
area might be possible in a decade.
On the subject of nuclear power,
Connolly said "the nuclear export

question needs resolution" as does the
problem of treating nuclear reactor
wastes, including plutoniurn.
Nuclear waste
Connolly pointed out that with
40,000 megawatts of nuclear generat
ing capacity now in operation in the
United States, producing radioactive
waste at a rate of 30 tons per thousand
megawatts of capacity, 1200 tons of
this material was being created each
year.
Connolly said one per cent of this
radioactive waste was plutoniurn.
Figuring the amount of plutoniurn
necessary to build an atomic bomb at
10 kilograms, Connolly calculated that
the twelve tons of plutoniurn being
created each year would provide
enough fissionable material for the
construction of approximately "one

While saying large-scale centralized
solar generation of electricity was not
very likely at present, Connolly did say
he thought the prospect for decen
tralized solar heating of water and liv
ing space "looks very good." He pre
dicted that decentralized solar heating
might be a billion dollar market by
1985.
Energy conservation
As for a solution to the energy prob
lem through conservation, Connolly
said he thought the only way to limit
consumption of fuel was "to price the
commodity up, and people will use
less.
"Just telling people that it would be
nice if they used less energy won't
work," he said. "And you can quote
me on that."

risen relatively slowly since the
1973-74 period of rapid inflation.
Grain embargoes
Gray commented further that "Any
administration is likely to be sensi
tive" about imposing grain embargoes
in the future. A reversal of Carter's
campaign promise not to implement
such a policy would be "extremely un
likely," said Gray, because Bergland
has a farming operation himself and
was adversely affected by past grain
embargoes.
Gray said that inevitably both com
mercial and humanitarian exports of
American grain will remain at their
current high levels or increase even
further.
American diet
Even in the wake of a report recently
issued by the Senate Select Committee
on Nutrition and Human Needs, which
said American diets contain too many
fats and refined sugars, Gray said he
doubted that the Carter Administra
tion would undertake a "serious major
initiative" to improve the average diet.
"It's fundamentally a question of
education," said Gray, "and most
people now don't even eat as well as
they know they should."

Gray discounted theories that the
world was entering a period of severe
weather that was likely to seriously ef
fect the planet's food production
capacity. He said changes in the
weather seem to be "more sporadic
than cyclical" and that in any case
their pace is exceedingly slow.
New fuels
Thomas Conolly, professor and as
sociate chairman of the mechanical
engineering department, said he ex
pects uranium and coal to provide the
major share of additional electric plant
fuels during the period of the Carter
presidency.
He said the current state of coal
liquification technology still pro
duces fuel that is more expensive than
oil. He said substantial progress in this
area might be possible in a decade.
On the subject of nuclear power,
Connolly said "the nuclear export

question needs resolution" as does the
problem of treating nuclear reactor
wastes, including plutoniurn.
Nuclear waste
Connolly pointed out that with
40,000 megawatts of nuclear generat
ing capacity now in operation in the
United States, producing radioactive
waste at a rate of 30 tons per thousand
megawatts of capacity, 1200 tons of
this material was being created each
year.
Connolly said one per cent of this
radioactive waste was plutoniurn.
Figuring the amount of plutoniurn
necessary to build an atomic bomb at
10 kilograms, Connolly calculated that
the twelve tons of plutoniurn being
created each year would provide
enough fissionable material for the
construction of approximately "one

While saying large-scale centralized
solar generation of electricity was not
very likely at present, Connolly did say
he thought the prospect for decen
tralized solar heating of water and liv
ing space "looks very good." He pre
dicted that decentralized solar heating
might be a billion dollar market by
1985.
Energy conservation
As for a solution to the energy prob
lem through conservation, Connolly
said he thought the only way to limit
consumption of fuel was "to price the
commodity up, and people will use
less.
"Just telling people that it would be
nice if they used less energy won't
work," he said. "And you can quote
me on that."
on the Carter administration
"The Carter administration is likely
to be considerably more interven
tionist in its agricultural policy than
its predecessor," says Roger Gray, a
professor at the Food Research Insti
tute here.
Gray said that Robert Bergland,
named by Garter to be secretary of ag
riculture, will probably tend towards
the farm policy of his fellow Minneso
tans, Sen. Hubert Humphrey and Vice
President-elect Walter Mondale. This
will mean more reliance on farm price
supports and a system of grain re
serves, according to Gray.
Gray said that Bergland seems to
favor a system in which farmers rather
than the government would hold the
reserves, since such an arrangment
would be less costly to the govern
ment.
He said he doubted that the new ag
ricultural policies would have much of
an effect on food prices, which have
risen relatively slowly since the
1973-74 period of rapid inflation.
