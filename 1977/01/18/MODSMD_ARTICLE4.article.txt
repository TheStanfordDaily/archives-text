# Drought keeps Lake Lag dry
## 
### Mark Schleiss 
Lake Lagunita, Stanford's popular
springtime swimming and sailing
spot, will remain closed this season
due to lack of water,according to Jason
Mavis, director of plant services.
"We didn't expect sufficient rainfall
this year to fill the lake," Mavis said,
"and the forecast was an accurate one.
Our current long-range forecast is that
the lake will be dry again this year."
Last year Lake Lagunita was closed
because of the severe drought condi
tions. Rainfall has been closer to nor
mal this year, but still not nearly
enough to offset the effects of last
year's dry weather, according to
Mavis.

Plant Services Water Supervisor Joe
Carrington said that both Searsville
Lake and Felt Lake must be full before
water can be diverted into San Fran
cisquito Creek. This runoff into San
Francisquito fills Lake Lagunita, but
this year neither Searsville nor Felt are
at sufficient levels to allow filling of
the creek.
One-third full
"Searsville and Felt Lakes are pre
sently only about one-third full,"
stated Carrington, "which is very un
usual for this time of year. San Fran
cisquito is really dry. A good five in
ches of rain would probably fill
Searsville and Felt, but even that won't
help Lake Lag."
Mavis was hopeful that the lake
would be full by next year. "If we get
average rainfall over the next year,"
Mavis said, "Lake Lag will probably be
back in use by next spring." Mavis said
that no academic programs would be
planned for the lake in the near future.
The shortage of water in Searsville
will affect other parts of the Stanford
community, particularly local farmers
who use university water, according to
George Burtness, assistant manager of
land resources.
Farmers' situation
Burtness said, "The situation for the
farmers who use Searsville water is far
more serious than it was last year at
this time." Burtness attributed this to
the fact that farmers have increased
production expecting a year of more
abundant rainfall than last year.
"Unless it rains enough for these far
mers, the water level in Searsville
could go dangerously low," said Burt
ness.
Another problem resulting from the
lack of water is the lack of winter grass
growth on university grazing land.

"The cattlemen who rent the 4000-odd
acres of grazing land are having to ship
in hay for their herds," Burtness said,
"and the horses that graze at Coyote
Hill are being removed to save the
ground there from erosion."
Burtness emphasized that the golf
course and campus are no longer on
Searsville water, but are instead taken
care of by the San Francisco municipal
system.
Thomas Chan, director of planning
at the San Francisco Water Depart
ment, anticipated no diffficulties or
shortages in the water supply. "We go
on a week-by-week basis to keep up
with the situation, but 1 really doubt
that anyone will be cut off," Chan said.

ness.
Another problem resulting from the
lack of water is the lack of winter grass
growth on university grazing land.

"The cattlemen who rent the 4000-odd
acres of grazing land are having to ship
in hay for their herds," Burtness said,
"and the horses that graze at Coyote
Hill are being removed to save the
ground there from erosion."
Burtness emphasized that the golf
course and campus are no longer on
Searsville water, but are instead taken
care of by the San Francisco municipal
system.
Thomas Chan, director of planning
at the San Francisco Water Depart
ment, anticipated no diffficulties or
shortages in the water supply. "We go
on a week-by-week basis to keep up
with the situation, but 1 really doubt
that anyone will be cut off," Chan said.
Lake Lagunita, Stanford's popular
springtime swimming and sailing
spot, will remain closed this season
due to lack of water,according to Jason
Mavis, director of plant services.
"We didn't expect sufficient rainfall
this year to fill the lake," Mavis said,
"and the forecast was an accurate one.
Our current long-range forecast is that
the lake will be dry again this year."
Last year Lake Lagunita was closed
because of the severe drought condi
tions. Rainfall has been closer to nor
mal this year, but still not nearly
enough to offset the effects of last
year's dry weather, according to
Mavis.

Plant Services Water Supervisor Joe
Carrington said that both Searsville
Lake and Felt Lake must be full before
water can be diverted into San Fran
cisquito Creek. This runoff into San
Francisquito fills Lake Lagunita, but
this year neither Searsville nor Felt are
at sufficient levels to allow filling of
the creek.
One-third full
"Searsville and Felt Lakes are pre
sently only about one-third full,"
stated Carrington, "which is very un
usual for this time of year. San Fran
cisquito is really dry. A good five in
ches of rain would probably fill
Searsville and Felt, but even that won't
help Lake Lag."
Mavis was hopeful that the lake
would be full by next year. "If we get
average rainfall over the next year,"
Mavis said, "Lake Lag will probably be
back in use by next spring." Mavis said
that no academic programs would be
planned for the lake in the near future.
The shortage of water in Searsville
will affect other parts of the Stanford
community, particularly local farmers
who use university water, according to
George Burtness, assistant manager of
land resources.
Farmers' situation
Burtness said, "The situation for the
farmers who use Searsville water is far
more serious than it was last year at
this time." Burtness attributed this to
the fact that farmers have increased
production expecting a year of more
abundant rainfall than last year.
"Unless it rains enough for these far
mers, the water level in Searsville
could go dangerously low," said Burt
ness.
Another problem resulting from the
