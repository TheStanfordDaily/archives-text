# A 						second Hawaiian charter?
## 
### Kathy Trafton Staff writer 
The ASSU charter to Hawaii this
spring is already sold out, and there
are more than enough people to fill
another plane. The only problem is
finding one.
According to Marti McCulloch, as
sistant manager of the ASSU Charter
Service, there may be a plane on the
horizon for the 252 unfortunates on the
Hawaii charter waiting list.
"We're working on it every day,"
said McCulloch. "The problem is not a
lack of interest on our part. The prob
lem is a lack of availability of planes."
ASSU Charter Service Manager Joe
Hess said this is the third year in a row
the ASSU has had trouble getting
enough planes for Hawaii flights. He
said he blames a new market structure
in the airline charter business for the
difficulties he has encountered in find
ing planes.
"There is no real incentive for the
airlines to want our business," Hess
said. "More and more large operators
have moved into the business. Only a
long history of business and good will
with Western (Airlines) allowed us to
get the one Hawaii flight."
No more charters
"Western has warned us that they're
not very interested in our business (in
the future). I don't think that the ASSU
will be in the charter business much
longer," Hess said.
The ASSU had scheduled three
other planes for this spring, but cancel
led one of the New York flights be
cause of a lack of student interest. The
remaining New York flight is about
one-half full, according to Hess.
The Chicago flight is currently only
one-quarter full, and Hess said it pos
sibly could be cancelled unless stu
dent demand picks up.
Mexican charters
The ASSU is also sponsoring pac
kage deals to Mazatlan, Puerta Vallarta
and Mexico City over spring break.
Hess said that the ASSU helps arrange
the flights for students but that they are
really available to anybody. Hess said
that he has not been able to get a price
on the flights yet.
Approximately 2000 Stanford stu
dents traveled on the nine ASSU spon
sored flights at Christmas time. Four of
the flights went to New York, two went
to Chicago, and one each went to Bos
ton and Washington, D.C.
Some airlines charged higher prices
for liquor than others. Therefore, to
keep the costs down, liquor was not
served on those airlines' charters.

on one of the Chicago flights (had we
served drinks). But our Hawaii flight
will have first class service. There will
be a champagne brunch, a movie,
and drinks," Hess said.
The charter service made "what
you'd probably consider a profit" this
winter, said Hess. But Hess said, "We
are a service. We're not necessarily a
means for making a profit for the
ASSU. Any extra money we make goes
into the Travel Service Reserve Fund.
There is $70,000 in the fund now. This
spring we'll break about even."

into the Travel Service Reserve Fund.
There is $70,000 in the fund now. This
spring we'll break about even."
The ASSU charter to Hawaii this
spring is already sold out, and there
are more than enough people to fill
another plane. The only problem is
finding one.
According to Marti McCulloch, as
sistant manager of the ASSU Charter
Service, there may be a plane on the
horizon for the 252 unfortunates on the
Hawaii charter waiting list.
"We're working on it every day,"
said McCulloch. "The problem is not a
lack of interest on our part. The prob
lem is a lack of availability of planes."
ASSU Charter Service Manager Joe
Hess said this is the third year in a row
the ASSU has had trouble getting
enough planes for Hawaii flights. He
said he blames a new market structure
in the airline charter business for the
difficulties he has encountered in find
ing planes.
"There is no real incentive for the
airlines to want our business," Hess
said. "More and more large operators
have moved into the business. Only a
long history of business and good will
with Western (Airlines) allowed us to
get the one Hawaii flight."
No more charters
"Western has warned us that they're
not very interested in our business (in
the future). I don't think that the ASSU
will be in the charter business much
longer," Hess said.
The ASSU had scheduled three
other planes for this spring, but cancel
led one of the New York flights be
cause of a lack of student interest. The
remaining New York flight is about
one-half full, according to Hess.
The Chicago flight is currently only
one-quarter full, and Hess said it pos
sibly could be cancelled unless stu
dent demand picks up.
Mexican charters
The ASSU is also sponsoring pac
kage deals to Mazatlan, Puerta Vallarta
and Mexico City over spring break.
Hess said that the ASSU helps arrange
the flights for students but that they are
really available to anybody. Hess said
that he has not been able to get a price
on the flights yet.
Approximately 2000 Stanford stu
dents traveled on the nine ASSU spon
sored flights at Christmas time. Four of
the flights went to New York, two went
to Chicago, and one each went to Bos
ton and Washington, D.C.
Some airlines charged higher prices
for liquor than others. Therefore, to
keep the costs down, liquor was not
served on those airlines' charters.

served drinks). But our Hawaii flight
will have first class service. There will
be a champagne brunch, a movie,
and drinks," Hess said.
The charter service made "what
you'd probably consider a profit" this
winter, said Hess. But Hess said, "We
are a service. We're not necessarily a
means for making a profit for the
ASSU. Any extra money we make goes
