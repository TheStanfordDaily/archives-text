# New computer launched

Although plagued by high demand
and long system response times, Low
Overhead Time Sharing (LOTS) has
been operating with "no real disas
ters" since the beginning of the quar
ter, according to Manager Ralph Gorin.
Located in the Stanford Center for
Research and Development in Teach
ing (SCRDT) building, the facility pre
sently operates a Digital Equipment
Corporation (DEC) System 2040
through 30 terminals.
LOTS was established "for teaching,
unsponsored research, and general
computing by faculty and students,"
according to a memo by LOTS Director
John McCarthy.
The provost's office funded the op
eration for fiscal year 1976-77 with a
budget of $190,000, which includes
start-up costs, machine amortization,
and this school year's operation, said
Gorin.
Funds for LOTS
The funds for LOTS came from cut
ting the computing budgets of indi
vidual departments. The budgets were
formerly used to pay for student in
structional accounts with the Stanford
Center for Information Processing
(SCIP). Since there is no charge to use
LOTS, students in computing courses
based in the new operation have no
need for accounts.
Several computer science, electrical
engineering and education courses
have converted from using SCIP to
LOTS starting this quarter and more
are planning to switch spring quarter.
Response time, which is the length
of time a user must wait to receive a
response after a command to the
machine, is unacceptably long on
LOTS because part of the computer has
not been delivered, according to Go
rin.
Smaller capacity
Instead of a capacity for about
256,000 computer words, the machine
has a capacity of 128,000 computer
words. As a result, the computer de
pends to a large extent on its external
magnetic disc to hold information.
Storage and retrieval on the disc is
more time-consuming than on the
machine's internal memory. Thus.

"the disc is getting a big workout,"
said Gorin.
The slow response situation has also
served to decrease throughout the
volume of processing over a specific
time. However, Gorin expects that the
first week of February will see the in
stallation of the remainder of the
memory.
A further problem with the new sys
tem involves software (programs) bor
rowed from other campus computers,
such as the Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory machine or the SCDP sys
tem.
Different language
Although the DEC 2040 is similar to
some other campus systems, the
adopted programs are not written in its
computer language. Therefore, the
borrowed programs mush first run
through a translator, called a compati
bility mode, before entering the core.
The translation process adds further to
run time.
During tests of a new software pac
kage last Wednesday, the machine
"crashed" (broke down) and remained
inoperative for seven hours. Gorin
admitted that the cause remains un
known.
Gorin expects 16 additional termi
nals to be available by late March, with
the total number of terminals rising to
64 by the end of summer quarter. Ten
tative plans call for ten to be located in
Cedar Hall and an undetermined
number in the to-be-completed Ter
man Engineering building. However,
the need for low-cost communication
is a major obstacle to such plans.
An "eventual goal" calls for termi
nals to be located in dormitories; how
ever, technical and financial consider
ations prevent such installations this
academic year, according to Gorin.
LOTS is an interactive system,
where the user "modifies the behavior
Michael Roberts, deputy director of
SCIP. said that computer scientists on
campus have been debating the rela
tive merits of the batch and interactive
modes as teaching tools.
Gorin thinks "interaction is an effec
tive teaching tool," claiming that stu
dents learn more rapidly and
thoroughly by solving problems in
teractively.
