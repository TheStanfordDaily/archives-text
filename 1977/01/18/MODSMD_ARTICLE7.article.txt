## editorial Examine theme houses 
### 
It's time again for the folks at the Residential
Education Office to decide which under
graduate housing will be plucked from the gen
eral consumption pool and made into "theme"
housing.
As the system stands, theme houses provide a
valuable support service for some students,
After all, some students regard their houses as
merely a place to hang their hats, while others
feel houses should serve a primarily social pur
pose. Theme houses, however, are designed for
the student who wishes to extend the (semi
formal) educational process into his or her
day-to-day living situation.
In light of the intended purpose of theme
houses — and especially because they remove
some of the most attractive housing units from
general access — the university should annu
ally reevaluate all such houses with an eye to
ward whether they are fulfilling specific
academic needs. (For the cultural centers, of
course, different criteria must be established.)
These annual evaluations should be made pub
lic.
In particular, the university should look crit
ically at theme houses which may no longer
have substantive academic programs as
sociated with them. Jordan, Whitman, Terra,
Synergy and Columbae come to mind.
Generally, no university housing should be
converted into outposts for ideological or
evangelical themes. Themes, when deemed
important, should be studied rather than pro
selytized.
For these reasons, the German studies theme

house should be approved if it requires a rigor
ous academic program, such as the French and
Italian houses do now. The proposal for an An
drogyny House, however, seems unacceptable
because of the ideological/evangelical living
group it seems to advocate.
Norm Robinson, acting associate dean of stu
dent affairs, will soon be making a recommen
dation on theme houses to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons. Robinson should re
member that only a limited number of students
are ready to make a personal commitment to
residential education. In light of this, the uni
versity should not be overly eager to expand the
theme housing program, lest it collapse under
its own weight.
In particular, Robinson should consider
whether certain programs now seem successful
because of their academic excellence, or merely
because of their superior physical facilities.
Theme houses should not require <the nicest
housing on campus in order to attract students.
For example, too many houses on the Row are
becoming theme houses. This trend should be
reversed, and Robinson should recommend a
plan under which persons would be grouped
independent of physical facilities.
There is a place at a residential university —
which Stanford likes to consider itself — for
theme housing, as well as for ethnic cultural
centers. But such a system does have inherent
limitations, which the university should con
sider carefully in looking at both present and
future themes.

As the system stands, theme houses provide a
valuable support service for some students,
After all, some students regard their houses as
merely a place to hang their hats, while others
feel houses should serve a primarily social pur
pose. Theme houses, however, are designed for
the student who wishes to extend the (semi
formal) educational process into his or her
day-to-day living situation.
In light of the intended purpose of theme
houses — and especially because they remove
some of the most attractive housing units from
general access — the university should annu
ally reevaluate all such houses with an eye to
ward whether they are fulfilling specific
academic needs. (For the cultural centers, of
course, different criteria must be established.)
These annual evaluations should be made pub
lic.
In particular, the university should look crit
ically at theme houses which may no longer
have substantive academic programs as
sociated with them. Jordan, Whitman, Terra,
Synergy and Columbae come to mind.
Generally, no university housing should be
converted into outposts for ideological or
evangelical themes. Themes, when deemed
important, should be studied rather than pro
selytized.
For these reasons, the German studies theme

house should be approved if it requires a rigor
ous academic program, such as the French and
Italian houses do now. The proposal for an An
drogyny House, however, seems unacceptable
because of the ideological/evangelical living
group it seems to advocate.
Norm Robinson, acting associate dean of stu
dent affairs, will soon be making a recommen
dation on theme houses to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons. Robinson should re
member that only a limited number of students
are ready to make a personal commitment to
residential education. In light of this, the uni
versity should not be overly eager to expand the
theme housing program, lest it collapse under
its own weight.
In particular, Robinson should consider
whether certain programs now seem successful
because of their academic excellence, or merely
because of their superior physical facilities.
Theme houses should not require <the nicest
housing on campus in order to attract students.
For example, too many houses on the Row are
becoming theme houses. This trend should be
reversed, and Robinson should recommend a
plan under which persons would be grouped
independent of physical facilities.
There is a place at a residential university —
which Stanford likes to consider itself — for
theme housing, as well as for ethnic cultural
centers. But such a system does have inherent
limitations, which the university should con
sider carefully in looking at both present and
future themes.
It's time again for the folks at the Residential
Education Office to decide which under
graduate housing will be plucked from the gen
eral consumption pool and made into "theme"
housing.
