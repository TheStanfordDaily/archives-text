# Androgyny House has many points
## 
### 
Shuman, Lupi

We thank Marc Zasada for his articu
late objections to the proposed An
drogyny House in his Jan. 14 Daily
column. He states, "My point ... is
simply that Androgyny House has no
point."
For Zasada and other skeptics of our
proposal, we would like now to justify
our program.
Androgyny House will differ in
three fundamental ways from any
other row house.
F'irst, Androgyny residents will be
required to take at least two classes
during the year pertaining to
feminist/humanist issues. This will be
the most rigorous academic require
ment of any theme house and suggests
that Androgyny residents will be
especially committed to developing
nonsexist consciousnesses.
Basic assumptions
Feminism must be approached from
an intellectual standpoint since it
challenges some of the most basic and
pervasive societal assumptions.
Only by understanding how these
assumptions shape our lives can we
reshape them. Since we have never
lived in a nonsexist society, we must
thoroughly analyze and comprehend
our sexist society so that we have a
point of reference.
Second, Androgyny includes
weekly consciousness-raising (CR)
groups for residents to apply the prin
ciples of feminism-humanism to their
daily lives.
Zasada's comparison of CR groups
to "house meetings every Monday
night" is like equating a quick meal at
Stern for 500 with a romantic dinner
for two.
CR group
A CR group is a flexible structure
which has proven to be an excellent
method for encouraging individuals to
incorporate feminism into their daily
lives and helping them cope with a
sexist society.

Third, and most important, is the
lifestyle that would result from the
synergetic combination of the prog
ram's academic and CR group compo
nents. Androgyny would harbor an
atmosphere which would promote
nonsexist behavior (quite the opposite
of most residences' current norms).
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Michelle
Rosaldo (a feminist but not an an
drogynist) has said, "In all human
societies, people's ideas about male
and female natures are at the core of
their conception of human social life
and order, and so feminism represents
not just the demand of a few people for
a few additional prerogatives, but
rather the suggestion that we reshape
our social lives as a whole."
Drives at roots
And such is our point: Feminism
constitutes a change in the individual
which drives at the roots of his or her
socialization. Comprehension for this
change cannot occur in a single quan
tum leap, but must slowly evolve.
Androgyny House would be an ex
periment in lifestyles which can only
be implemented in a house; a lifestyle
can't be developed in a room in Tre
sidder every other Thursday night.
Just as students choose to be in the
language houses to become better ac
quainted with a culture that is foreign
to their own, students choosing to live
in Androgyny would learn about a
"foreign" society where sexual equal
ity and respect is the rule rather than
the exception.
The obvious difference is that An
drogyny residents would continue di
rectly applying their knowledge inde
finitely, because feminism/humanism
is too deeply personal to be a one year
experience.
We should clarify that we are hardly
a few polemicists imposing their will
upon an anti-feminist student body.
On registration day, a handful of
people collected over 400 signatures

supporting our proposal.
We have similarly been supported
by dozens of faculty and adminis
trators. Furthermore, it is a little
known fact that last year, the participa
tion in feminist and sex-role related
classes exceeded the participation in
each of the French, German and Italian
departments.
Hence, there appears to be at least as
broad a base of support for Androgyny
as for two existing and one other prop
osed theme houses.
It should finally be noted that "an
drogyny" and "feminism/humanism"
are not synonymous. Both ideas strive
for a nonsexist society, but work from
different assumptions. We use the
word "androgyny" as merely a title,
because it easily implies female and
male.
But we must correct Zasada's
suggestion that "feminism/
humanism" is merely a euphemism to
"appease" males. In truth, the word
"feminism" no more refers to just
women than the word "mankind" to
just t men.
Perhaps the failure of Zasada and
many other students to recognize the
elementary fact that feminism works to
liberate all people suggests the real
need for Androgyny House.

Hence, there appears to be at least as
broad a base of support for Androgyny
as for two existing and one other prop
osed theme houses.
It should finally be noted that "an
drogyny" and "feminism/humanism"
are not synonymous. Both ideas strive
for a nonsexist society, but work from
different assumptions. We use the
word "androgyny" as merely a title,
because it easily implies female and
male.
But we must correct Zasada's
suggestion that "feminism/
humanism" is merely a euphemism to
"appease" males. In truth, the word
"feminism" no more refers to just
women than the word "mankind" to
just t men.
Perhaps the failure of Zasada and
many other students to recognize the
elementary fact that feminism works to
liberate all people suggests the real
need for Androgyny House.

Shuman, Lupi

We thank Marc Zasada for his articu
late objections to the proposed An
drogyny House in his Jan. 14 Daily
column. He states, "My point ... is
simply that Androgyny House has no
point."
For Zasada and other skeptics of our
proposal, we would like now to justify
our program.
Androgyny House will differ in
three fundamental ways from any
other row house.
F'irst, Androgyny residents will be
required to take at least two classes
during the year pertaining to
feminist/humanist issues. This will be
the most rigorous academic require
ment of any theme house and suggests
that Androgyny residents will be
especially committed to developing
nonsexist consciousnesses.
Basic assumptions
Feminism must be approached from
an intellectual standpoint since it
challenges some of the most basic and
pervasive societal assumptions.
Only by understanding how these
assumptions shape our lives can we
reshape them. Since we have never
lived in a nonsexist society, we must
thoroughly analyze and comprehend
our sexist society so that we have a
point of reference.
Second, Androgyny includes
weekly consciousness-raising (CR)
groups for residents to apply the prin
ciples of feminism-humanism to their
daily lives.
Zasada's comparison of CR groups
to "house meetings every Monday
night" is like equating a quick meal at
Stern for 500 with a romantic dinner
for two.
CR group
A CR group is a flexible structure
which has proven to be an excellent
method for encouraging individuals to
incorporate feminism into their daily
lives and helping them cope with a
sexist society.

Third, and most important, is the
lifestyle that would result from the
synergetic combination of the prog
ram's academic and CR group compo
nents. Androgyny would harbor an
atmosphere which would promote
nonsexist behavior (quite the opposite
of most residences' current norms).
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Michelle
Rosaldo (a feminist but not an an
drogynist) has said, "In all human
societies, people's ideas about male
and female natures are at the core of
their conception of human social life
and order, and so feminism represents
not just the demand of a few people for
a few additional prerogatives, but
rather the suggestion that we reshape
our social lives as a whole."
Drives at roots
And such is our point: Feminism
constitutes a change in the individual
which drives at the roots of his or her
socialization. Comprehension for this
change cannot occur in a single quan
tum leap, but must slowly evolve.
Androgyny House would be an ex
periment in lifestyles which can only
be implemented in a house; a lifestyle
can't be developed in a room in Tre
sidder every other Thursday night.
Just as students choose to be in the
language houses to become better ac
quainted with a culture that is foreign
to their own, students choosing to live
in Androgyny would learn about a
"foreign" society where sexual equal
ity and respect is the rule rather than
the exception.
The obvious difference is that An
drogyny residents would continue di
rectly applying their knowledge inde
finitely, because feminism/humanism
is too deeply personal to be a one year
experience.
We should clarify that we are hardly
a few polemicists imposing their will
upon an anti-feminist student body.
On registration day, a handful of
people collected over 400 signatures

supporting our proposal.
We have similarly been supported
by dozens of faculty and adminis
trators. Furthermore, it is a little
known fact that last year, the participa
tion in feminist and sex-role related
classes exceeded the participation in
each of the French, German and Italian
departments.

Just as students choose to be in the
language houses to become better ac
quainted with a culture that is foreign
to their own, students choosing to live
in Androgyny would learn about a
"foreign" society where sexual equal
ity and respect is the rule rather than
the exception.
The obvious difference is that An
drogyny residents would continue di
rectly applying their knowledge inde
finitely, because feminism/humanism
is too deeply personal to be a one year
experience.
We should clarify that we are hardly
a few polemicists imposing their will
upon an anti-feminist student body.
On registration day, a handful of
people collected over 400 signatures

supporting our proposal.
We have similarly been supported
by dozens of faculty and adminis
trators. Furthermore, it is a little
known fact that last year, the participa
tion in feminist and sex-role related
classes exceeded the participation in
each of the French, German and Italian
departments.
Hence, there appears to be at least as
broad a base of support for Androgyny
as for two existing and one other prop
osed theme houses.
It should finally be noted that "an
drogyny" and "feminism/humanism"
are not synonymous. Both ideas strive
for a nonsexist society, but work from
different assumptions. We use the
word "androgyny" as merely a title,
because it easily implies female and
male.
But we must correct Zasada's
suggestion that "feminism/
humanism" is merely a euphemism to
"appease" males. In truth, the word
"feminism" no more refers to just
women than the word "mankind" to
just t men.
Perhaps the failure of Zasada and
many other students to recognize the
elementary fact that feminism works to
liberate all people suggests the real
need for Androgyny House.
