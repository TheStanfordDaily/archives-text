..21st I
Year I
In 1956 Ming's came to
the Peninsula with
the idea of introducing
Cantonese food from
the traditional recipes
of Old China —
presented in a mood
of simple elegance
and served by a
meticulous staff.
This was our goal then—
this is our philosophy
now.
We are proud to be
referred to as an
"Institution on the Peninsula". B
