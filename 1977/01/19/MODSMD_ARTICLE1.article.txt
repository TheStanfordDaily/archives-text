# Quad corner face-lift to commence next week
## 
### Laura Kennedy Staff writer 
Construction is expected to begin by the end ot this
week on the renovation of Building 460 in the Outer Quad,
according to Jim Nelson, director for facilities and proper
ties here.
The building, used by the Physiology Department until
Christmas break this year, will be gutted, leaving only the
exterior shell, and rebuilt with a more efficient, increased
floor space, said the Planning Office's project architect,
Roger Buckhout.
The university yesterday signed a $4.19 million con
struction contract with Williams and Burrows general
contractors, with an estimated completion time of 23
months. Total budget for the project is $8.5 million.
T he structure, to be named Margaret Jacks Hall, is being
financed o> u gift from the Jacks family, and a
$1.5 million gift from Boys' Town and $500,000 from
various anonymous donors. The university may have to
turn to debt financing to fill the gap, according to David
Fulton of the General Secretary's Office.
Boys' Town and computers
Boys' Town Center for the Study of Youth Development,
now occupying a temporary building next to Sequoia
Hall, will occupy half of the basement and the first floor.
The Computer Science Department will occupy the rest of
the building.
The Physiology Department has already moved to the
Anatomy Building and the new Sherman Fairchild
Neurosciences Building.
Building 460 consists of three floors with the third floor
mostly used for storage.
The 19-foot ceilings will be lowered to ten and a half
feet, al lowing construction of four floors and a fifth service

floor.
The extra floor will increase useable floor space trom
33,711 square feet to 39,361 square feet. Offices will be
built for easy accessibility and present narrow hallways
and staircases will be brought up to code standards, said
Buckhout.
Building 460 has already been closed oft with a fence as
a preliminary step to construction. Although Margaret
Jacks Hall will provide more floor space, "We'll be com
fortable but tight," said Denny Brown, assistant chairman
of the computer Science Department.
Bringing it all together
The department actually has much more space right
now (33,900 square feet) than the it will have in its new
quarters (20,257 square feet). However, the department is
currently scattered among three buildings (Serra House,
Polya Hall and the artificial intelligence laboratory on
Arastradero Road) and the laboratory was not originally
built for its present purpose, according to Buckhout.
"The main advantage of the new building is getting
people together," said Brown, citing at least one computer
science professor who has offices in three different places.
"The personal time involved in floating around bet
ween those locations is disconcerting," he added.
The computer used for the artificial intelligence
laboratory will be moved to the basement of Margaret
Jacks Hall. The Music Department's computer music sec
tion, which also uses this computer, will be moved to the
fourth floor of the renovated building.
The Low Overhead Time Sharing (LOTS) computer
used for instructional purposes, is "totally independent"
of the Computer Science Department, said Brown, and
will remain at the Stanford Center for Research and De

velopment in Teaching.
The entrances to Building 460 will be made level with
the sidewalk for the convenience of those in wheelchairs.
There will be no connection between Margaret Jacks
Hall and Jordan Hall except by the outside sidewalk or
through the basement.
Spencer Associates have handled numerous other
buildings on campus, including the renovation of Jordan
Hall and the Math Corner.
University officials hope to eventually renovate all the
buildings in the Quad to make them more efficient, ac
cording to Sydney Burkhart, assistant dean for humanities
and sciences.
Bids will be sent in June for the renovation of the History
Corner, and construction is planned to start in August,
according to the Planning Office's project architect, Bob
Nerrie.
Like Margaret Jacks Hall, the renovation of the History
Corner will take about two years to complete, will cost

over $8 million, and will also increase floor space, said
Nerrie.
The History Department moved next door tc the old law
school in the summer of 1975. Burkhart said the History
Department moved at that time because the old law school
was available and not because plaster fell through the
ceiling of a large lecture hall in the History Corner.
"I think it was a factor, but not the cause of the move,"
said Burkhart.
Asst. Provost Amy Blue said, "We were very lucky that
no one got hurt," since the plaster fell on about a half
dozen chairs the day after the room had been used for
graduation proceedings.
Parts of the plaster ceiling, loosened by water coming
through a leaky skylight, fell through a dropped ceiling of
soundproofing tiles, according to Plant Services Opera
tion Manager Bruce Wiggins.
"(However), both the inner and outer quad have very
good roof systems," said Wiggins. "It's very rare that we
have any roof leakages in that area."

33,711 square feet to 39,361 square feet. Offices will be
built for easy accessibility and present narrow hallways
and staircases will be brought up to code standards, said
Buckhout.
Building 460 has already been closed oft with a fence as
a preliminary step to construction. Although Margaret
Jacks Hall will provide more floor space, "We'll be com
fortable but tight," said Denny Brown, assistant chairman
of the computer Science Department.
Bringing it all together
The department actually has much more space right
now (33,900 square feet) than the it will have in its new
quarters (20,257 square feet). However, the department is
currently scattered among three buildings (Serra House,
Polya Hall and the artificial intelligence laboratory on
Arastradero Road) and the laboratory was not originally
built for its present purpose, according to Buckhout.
"The main advantage of the new building is getting
people together," said Brown, citing at least one computer
science professor who has offices in three different places.
"The personal time involved in floating around bet
ween those locations is disconcerting," he added.
The computer used for the artificial intelligence
laboratory will be moved to the basement of Margaret
Jacks Hall. The Music Department's computer music sec
tion, which also uses this computer, will be moved to the
fourth floor of the renovated building.
The Low Overhead Time Sharing (LOTS) computer
used for instructional purposes, is "totally independent"
of the Computer Science Department, said Brown, and
will remain at the Stanford Center for Research and De

The entrances to Building 460 will be made level with
the sidewalk for the convenience of those in wheelchairs.
There will be no connection between Margaret Jacks
Hall and Jordan Hall except by the outside sidewalk or
through the basement.
Spencer Associates have handled numerous other
buildings on campus, including the renovation of Jordan
Hall and the Math Corner.
University officials hope to eventually renovate all the
buildings in the Quad to make them more efficient, ac
cording to Sydney Burkhart, assistant dean for humanities
and sciences.
Bids will be sent in June for the renovation of the History
Corner, and construction is planned to start in August,
according to the Planning Office's project architect, Bob
Nerrie.
Like Margaret Jacks Hall, the renovation of the History
Corner will take about two years to complete, will cost

over $8 million, and will also increase floor space, said
Nerrie.
The History Department moved next door tc the old law
school in the summer of 1975. Burkhart said the History
Department moved at that time because the old law school
was available and not because plaster fell through the
ceiling of a large lecture hall in the History Corner.
"I think it was a factor, but not the cause of the move,"
said Burkhart.
Asst. Provost Amy Blue said, "We were very lucky that
no one got hurt," since the plaster fell on about a half
dozen chairs the day after the room had been used for
graduation proceedings.
Parts of the plaster ceiling, loosened by water coming
through a leaky skylight, fell through a dropped ceiling of
soundproofing tiles, according to Plant Services Opera
tion Manager Bruce Wiggins.
"(However), both the inner and outer quad have very
good roof systems," said Wiggins. "It's very rare that we
have any roof leakages in that area."
Construction is expected to begin by the end ot this
week on the renovation of Building 460 in the Outer Quad,
according to Jim Nelson, director for facilities and proper
ties here.
The building, used by the Physiology Department until
Christmas break this year, will be gutted, leaving only the
exterior shell, and rebuilt with a more efficient, increased
floor space, said the Planning Office's project architect,
Roger Buckhout.
The university yesterday signed a $4.19 million con
struction contract with Williams and Burrows general
contractors, with an estimated completion time of 23
months. Total budget for the project is $8.5 million.
T he structure, to be named Margaret Jacks Hall, is being
financed o> u gift from the Jacks family, and a
$1.5 million gift from Boys' Town and $500,000 from
various anonymous donors. The university may have to
turn to debt financing to fill the gap, according to David
Fulton of the General Secretary's Office.
Boys' Town and computers
Boys' Town Center for the Study of Youth Development,
now occupying a temporary building next to Sequoia
Hall, will occupy half of the basement and the first floor.
The Computer Science Department will occupy the rest of
the building.
The Physiology Department has already moved to the
Anatomy Building and the new Sherman Fairchild
Neurosciences Building.
Building 460 consists of three floors with the third floor
mostly used for storage.
The 19-foot ceilings will be lowered to ten and a half
feet, al lowing construction of four floors and a fifth service

floor.
The extra floor will increase useable floor space trom
33,711 square feet to 39,361 square feet. Offices will be
built for easy accessibility and present narrow hallways

velopment in Teaching.
The entrances to Building 460 will be made level with
the sidewalk for the convenience of those in wheelchairs.
There will be no connection between Margaret Jacks
Hall and Jordan Hall except by the outside sidewalk or
through the basement.
Spencer Associates have handled numerous other
buildings on campus, including the renovation of Jordan
Hall and the Math Corner.
University officials hope to eventually renovate all the
buildings in the Quad to make them more efficient, ac
cording to Sydney Burkhart, assistant dean for humanities
and sciences.
Bids will be sent in June for the renovation of the History
Corner, and construction is planned to start in August,
according to the Planning Office's project architect, Bob
Nerrie.
Like Margaret Jacks Hall, the renovation of the History
Corner will take about two years to complete, will cost

over $8 million, and will also increase floor space, said
Nerrie.
The History Department moved next door tc the old law
school in the summer of 1975. Burkhart said the History
Department moved at that time because the old law school
was available and not because plaster fell through the
ceiling of a large lecture hall in the History Corner.
"I think it was a factor, but not the cause of the move,"
said Burkhart.
Asst. Provost Amy Blue said, "We were very lucky that
no one got hurt," since the plaster fell on about a half
dozen chairs the day after the room had been used for
graduation proceedings.
Parts of the plaster ceiling, loosened by water coming
through a leaky skylight, fell through a dropped ceiling of
soundproofing tiles, according to Plant Services Opera
tion Manager Bruce Wiggins.
"(However), both the inner and outer quad have very
good roof systems," said Wiggins. "It's very rare that we
have any roof leakages in that area."
Construction is expected to begin by the end ot this
week on the renovation of Building 460 in the Outer Quad,
according to Jim Nelson, director for facilities and proper
ties here.
The building, used by the Physiology Department until
Christmas break this year, will be gutted, leaving only the
exterior shell, and rebuilt with a more efficient, increased
floor space, said the Planning Office's project architect,
Roger Buckhout.
The university yesterday signed a $4.19 million con
struction contract with Williams and Burrows general
contractors, with an estimated completion time of 23
months. Total budget for the project is $8.5 million.
T he structure, to be named Margaret Jacks Hall, is being
financed o> u gift from the Jacks family, and a
$1.5 million gift from Boys' Town and $500,000 from
various anonymous donors. The university may have to
turn to debt financing to fill the gap, according to David
Fulton of the General Secretary's Office.
Boys' Town and computers
Boys' Town Center for the Study of Youth Development,
now occupying a temporary building next to Sequoia
Hall, will occupy half of the basement and the first floor.
The Computer Science Department will occupy the rest of
the building.
The Physiology Department has already moved to the
Anatomy Building and the new Sherman Fairchild
Neurosciences Building.
Building 460 consists of three floors with the third floor
mostly used for storage.
The 19-foot ceilings will be lowered to ten and a half
feet, al lowing construction of four floors and a fifth service

floor.
The extra floor will increase useable floor space trom
33,711 square feet to 39,361 square feet. Offices will be
built for easy accessibility and present narrow hallways
and staircases will be brought up to code standards, said
Buckhout.
Building 460 has already been closed oft with a fence as
a preliminary step to construction. Although Margaret
Jacks Hall will provide more floor space, "We'll be com
fortable but tight," said Denny Brown, assistant chairman
of the computer Science Department.
Bringing it all together
The department actually has much more space right
now (33,900 square feet) than the it will have in its new
quarters (20,257 square feet). However, the department is
currently scattered among three buildings (Serra House,
Polya Hall and the artificial intelligence laboratory on
Arastradero Road) and the laboratory was not originally
built for its present purpose, according to Buckhout.
"The main advantage of the new building is getting
people together," said Brown, citing at least one computer
science professor who has offices in three different places.
"The personal time involved in floating around bet
ween those locations is disconcerting," he added.
The computer used for the artificial intelligence
laboratory will be moved to the basement of Margaret
Jacks Hall. The Music Department's computer music sec
tion, which also uses this computer, will be moved to the
fourth floor of the renovated building.
The Low Overhead Time Sharing (LOTS) computer
used for instructional purposes, is "totally independent"
of the Computer Science Department, said Brown, and
will remain at the Stanford Center for Research and De
