# Is fiscal responsibility in vogue?
## 
### 
In September 1975, Ronald Reagan,
two months shy of announcing his
candidacy for the presidency, prop
osed "a program of creative federalism
for America's third century," a plan to
cut income taxes by 23 per cent and
systematically return over $90 billion
to the states.
The idea was aimed at reducing the
size of the massive federal bureauc
racy, and increasing the effeciency of
government programs by allowing the
states and localities that are served to
administer their own programs.
Reagan was denounced by his polit
ical opponents, so severely that col
umnist John Lofton Jr. quipped that
some must have viewed the proposal
as "a-pie-in-the-sky pipedream from a
right-wing fanatic whose fondest
dream was to return to the pre
penicillin days of typhoid fever, child
labor and the Articles of Confedera
tion."
Even America's self-styled "most
conservative president since Herbert
Hoover," Gerald Ford, implied in
New Hampshire that Reagan's plan
would "have the effect of tossing old
people out in the snow."

1976, however, was a year when
political ideologies became so blurred
as to become nearly imperceivably by
the electorate. The master of fuzziness,
Jimmy Carter, was elected president of
the United States so that he could an
nounce appointments like the haw
kish James Schlesinger and conscien
tious objector Theodore Sorenson to
his cabinet on the same day.
At the same time, the breed of "new

Democrats" the progressive, moder
ately liberal likes of our own Gov. Jerry
Brown, Michael Dukakis of Mas
sachusetts and David Pryor of Arkan
sas are proving themselves to be quite
the fiscal conservatives.
Pryor is an excellent example.
Elected as a liberal Democrat in a land
slide, he has proposed what he calls
"the Arkansas Plan" â€” he will reduce
taxes by 25 per cent and cut the state
budget by nearly $26 million, mostly
in local programs now administered
by the state.
Pryor's logic is simple: "local people
know best their local problems," he
says. "An across the board reduction,
as some have advocated, is not the
answer. That is the easy way out. It is
the path of least resistance. It is

another way of saying 'Let's not chal
lenge what's really wrong with our
system. Let's postpone it and let some
one else do something about it.' "
He adds that an increase in sales
taxes is not the answer. They are re
gressive and unfair to the poor and,
besides, they result in greater revenue
for the state and not the cities and
counties. Thus Pryor says we should
reject cosmetic reforms and go directly
to the root of the problem.
"Government, in short, must cease
being a parent and become instead a
partner," he argues. "Unless we take a
bold, new approach and face our prob
lems now, the demands will far out
strip our ability to pay.
"We must get our house in order and
we must take a stand ... I have
watched government expand on both a
federal and state level. In fact, we have
seen an unbelievable growth in size
and scope.

"As a result of this expansion, a deep
frustration has set in. People feel that
government has moved beyond their
grasp. Together, they see an absence
of accountability."
Indeed, the charismatic 42-year-old
progressive sounds very much like the
conservative former governor of
California when he observes:
"The choice of local destiny was
placed as the cornerstone of our
American freedoms. It accounts for the
founding of our cities and states and
the settling of America. But somehow
we have lost our way and have grown
too dependent on our government.
"For too long we have tried to solve
our problems from the top rather than
from the bottom."
Amen. We can only hope that
another product of the New South who
moves into the White House tomorrow
feels the same way.
