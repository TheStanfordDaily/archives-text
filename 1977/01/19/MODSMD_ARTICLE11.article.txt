# Letter: 'Chappie'
## 
### 
As students who have many times
admired the sarcastic humor of the
Chaparral, we feel that a part ofthereg
pack issue overstepped the bounds of
acceptable humor. Specifically, we
refer to the article concerning Brad
Krevoy and some of his friends, where
the writer seems to have drawn the line
determining what would be written
and what would be omitted well

beyond the point where the feelings of
individuals are hurt.
The apparent callous disregard dis
played by both the author and the pub
lication which saw fit to print the arti
cle is most disturbing.
