## State's resources misused? 
### Kathy Trafton 
The main goals for California
energy policy should be a more
appropriate use of existing re
sources and more diversity in
the energy sources supplying
our constant needs, Alan Pater
nack said Monday at an energy
seminar here.
Paternack, a member of the
Energy Resources Conservation
and Development Commission
of California, said that the most
pressing energy problem in the
state today is a reliance on ever
scarcer natural gas.
"A hefty component of
California's electrical generation

comes from natural gas. But this
has been changing dramatically
over the past few years, and the
use of petroleum has expanded,"
Paternack said.
Paternack predicted that by
the year 2000 there will be a shift
toward such energy sources as
coal and nuclear, geothermal
and solar energy. Electricity will
be used to a much greater degree
for both mass transit and for bat
tery powered vehicles, he said.
Because of continued curtail
ment on supplies of natural gas
from Canada, northern Califor
nia will be cutting back the use
of natural gas by two out of its

five priority groups this year,
said Paternack. The two affected
groups are the industrial and
commercial sectors. The domes
tic sector takes top priority.
California differs from the rest
of the nation in the way it
utilizes energy and the way it
provides it, said Paternack. "For
example, California uses propor
tionally more energy for trans
portation than the rest of the na
tion as a whole."
Only .01 per cent of Califor
nia's energy is derived from coal,
as opposed to the 20 per cent na
tional average, said Paternack.
About one-fourth of Califor
nia's energy needs are met by
hydroelectric power as opposed
to the five per cent national aver
age, Paternack said. "This is one
reason the electricity rates in
California are as cheap as they
are," he said.
Also, California is the only
state in the union generating
electricity from geothermal re
sources.
Up to 29 per cent of Califor
nia's energy needs are met by
foreign sources as opposed to a
19 per cent national average.
"How effectively and approp
riately we are using the mul
titude of different kinds of re
sources available to us is cru
cial," said Paternack.
"Nuclear energy and coal
should help replace base oil as a
means for producing electricity
and should help move hyd
roelectric power to its peak im
plementation," he said.
Paternack said that oil is ex
pensive, inefficient, imported,
contains sulphur and contri
butes to air pollution. "1 want to
see it eliminated as much as pos
sible, and replaced with hyd

roelectric power," he said.
Although coal presents an
"awful problem," it is an abun
dant resource, and it will be
used in California, Paternack
said.
"Also, we need a policy in
California to use hydroelectric
power more effectively," said
Paternack. "Hydroelectricity is
well suited for meeting peak
load requirements (require
ments that come only a few times
a year), but 32 per cent of the
base load (energy needed 24
hours a day) is met by using it."
"Why are the utilities propos
ing to build gas turbines to meet
peak demands when we have all
this hydroelectric power that is
available and to a large extent
not being used properly?"
Paternack asked.
Paternack said that he forsees
immediate drawbacks to
California's base level depen
dence on hydroelectric power.
"We're in the twentieth month of
a drought and we'll be running
into some problems. Last sum
mer we were able to import
cheap hydroelectric power from
the Pacific northwest; this sum
mer we won't be able to."
Paternack said that present
state level policies are conflict
ing and are not accelerating. He
said he hopes that such policies
as tax credits and high priorities
for users of solar energy will be
implemented by the California
government.
Paternack said that education
is the best way to encourage the
residential sector to conserve re
sources. "It could make a big
impact, and we could do a lot
more in this area," Paternack
said.

tional average, said Paternack.
About one-fourth of Califor
nia's energy needs are met by
hydroelectric power as opposed
to the five per cent national aver
age, Paternack said. "This is one
reason the electricity rates in
California are as cheap as they
are," he said.
Also, California is the only
state in the union generating
electricity from geothermal re
sources.
Up to 29 per cent of Califor
nia's energy needs are met by
foreign sources as opposed to a
19 per cent national average.
"How effectively and approp
riately we are using the mul
titude of different kinds of re
sources available to us is cru
cial," said Paternack.
"Nuclear energy and coal
should help replace base oil as a
means for producing electricity
and should help move hyd
roelectric power to its peak im
plementation," he said.
Paternack said that oil is ex
pensive, inefficient, imported,
contains sulphur and contri
butes to air pollution. "1 want to
see it eliminated as much as pos
sible, and replaced with hyd

roelectric power," he said.
Although coal presents an
"awful problem," it is an abun
dant resource, and it will be
used in California, Paternack
said.
"Also, we need a policy in
California to use hydroelectric
power more effectively," said
Paternack. "Hydroelectricity is
well suited for meeting peak
load requirements (require
ments that come only a few times
a year), but 32 per cent of the
base load (energy needed 24
hours a day) is met by using it."
"Why are the utilities propos
ing to build gas turbines to meet
peak demands when we have all
this hydroelectric power that is
available and to a large extent
not being used properly?"
Paternack asked.
Paternack said that he forsees
immediate drawbacks to
California's base level depen
dence on hydroelectric power.
"We're in the twentieth month of
a drought and we'll be running
into some problems. Last sum
mer we were able to import
cheap hydroelectric power from
the Pacific northwest; this sum
mer we won't be able to."
Paternack said that present
state level policies are conflict
ing and are not accelerating. He
said he hopes that such policies
as tax credits and high priorities
for users of solar energy will be
implemented by the California
government.
Paternack said that education
is the best way to encourage the
residential sector to conserve re
sources. "It could make a big
impact, and we could do a lot
more in this area," Paternack
said.
The main goals for California
energy policy should be a more
appropriate use of existing re
sources and more diversity in
the energy sources supplying
our constant needs, Alan Pater
nack said Monday at an energy
seminar here.
Paternack, a member of the
Energy Resources Conservation
and Development Commission
of California, said that the most
pressing energy problem in the
state today is a reliance on ever
scarcer natural gas.
"A hefty component of
California's electrical generation

comes from natural gas. But this
has been changing dramatically
over the past few years, and the
use of petroleum has expanded,"
Paternack said.
Paternack predicted that by
the year 2000 there will be a shift
toward such energy sources as
coal and nuclear, geothermal
and solar energy. Electricity will
be used to a much greater degree
for both mass transit and for bat
tery powered vehicles, he said.
Because of continued curtail
ment on supplies of natural gas
from Canada, northern Califor
nia will be cutting back the use
of natural gas by two out of its

five priority groups this year,
said Paternack. The two affected
groups are the industrial and
commercial sectors. The domes
tic sector takes top priority.
California differs from the rest
of the nation in the way it
utilizes energy and the way it
provides it, said Paternack. "For
example, California uses propor
tionally more energy for trans
portation than the rest of the na
tion as a whole."
Only .01 per cent of Califor
nia's energy is derived from coal,
as opposed to the 20 per cent na
tional average, said Paternack.
About one-fourth of Califor
nia's energy needs are met by
hydroelectric power as opposed
to the five per cent national aver
age, Paternack said. "This is one
reason the electricity rates in
