## Examiner Games Russian tracksters practice here 
### Bruce Anderson 
The expansion and renovation of the shot
put training area last week at Stanford
Stadium came just in time. Yesterday the
last three men to own the world shot put
record met at the south end of the stadium
and christened the renovated facility with
an afternoon practice session.
Current world record holder Aleksandr
Barishnikov, A 1 Feuerbach and Terry Al
britton assembled for a workout to prepare
for the San Francisco Examiner Games this
Friday at the Cow Palace.
Yesterday was the second meeting of the
three in four days. The three weight men
competed against each other Saturday in
the Sunkist Meet in Los Angeles where
Mac Wilkins, world record holder in the
discus, defeated all three of them.
Feuerbach and Albritton gave the U.S. a
1-2-3 sweep over Russia's Barishnikov and
Yevgeny Mironov, the Olympic silver

medalist who was also at Stanford yester
day.
"There are two things worse than losing
to a Russian," Albritton said. "The first is
losing to an East German (an East German
Udo Beyer won the gold medal last summer
in Montreal). The second is losing to a dis
cus thrower."
Barishnikov was the first to throw yester
day. He uses an unconventional two
revolution spin technique similar to that
used by discus throwers. Brian Oldfield,
who holds the professional shot put mark,
also uses a spin technique.
"The spin won't replace the orthodox
technique," Feuerbach said. "If it is highly
successful, it may become like the Fosbury
flop — it may become the predominant
style. But it won't completely replace the
orthodox style."
Having turned 29 last Friday (the same
day Albritton celebrated his 22nd birthday),

Feuerbach is the veteran of the trio. When
he broke Randy Mattson's world record
with a 71-7 toss in the San Jose Invitational
in May, 1973, Albritton was just an 18-
year-old freshman at Stanford.
Last February Albritton broke Feuer
bach's 2V2-year-old mark with a 71-BV2 put.
Barishnikov shattered Albritton's record
last July when he became the first amateur
to throw over 72 feet with a 72-2 3 A effort.
After Barishnikov took his practice
throws yesterday, he left the area to lift
weights, but later returned to watch his two
American rivals.
Barishnikov affected a stoic expression as
he watched Albritton and Feuerbach throw
a 15-pound practice ball between 65 and 70
feet. His expression was broken by a laugh
only when Albritton busted the top of the
concrete pole which serves as the 65-foot
marker.
