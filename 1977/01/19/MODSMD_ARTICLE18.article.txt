# Hawaii invades Maples
## Cards find morale booster 
### David Georgette 
The Stanford crowd roared as guard Wolfe
Perry was introduced before the USC game. And
when Perry ran across the court and slapped "ten"
with the cheering fans, Maples Pavilion rocked.
The other four Cardinal starters followed Per
ry's lead last Thursday and then again on Satur
day against UCLA. In both games, the crowd's
enthusiasm, pumped up by the hand-slapping,
could be felt throughout Maples at the opening
tip-off.
"It's great," said Perry of the introductions. "It
gets the fans with us. It makes it us and the Stan
ford crowd against the other guys."
Morale leader
Freshman forward Kimberly Belton, the team's
unofficial morale leader, called the hand
slapping "a way of getting the fans up. It's sort of a
psyche job. He thought it would be sort of a un
ique idea."
And unique it is. While some other schools
might have their cheerleaders or students form
two rows for the players to run out between, the
Cardinals have taken this new approach.
Getting the fans involved with the start of the
game was coach Dick Dißiaso's idea, according to
Perry. Dißiaso credits the players with the origi
nality, though. "The team felt it'd be a very nice
idea," said Dißiaso.
Senior captain Mike Bratz said, "It's kind of fun.
The players seem to like it. The fans do, too. If I
were a little kind, I know it'd be a thrill for me."
Hawaii
Another thrill for the little kids and the fans will
be seeing Gavin Smith launch his arching jum
pers tonight when the Cardinals host the Rainbow
Warriors (4-10) of Hawaii at 8 in Maples (KZSU

90.1 FM).
Coach Larry Little's squad is completing a
swing through the mainland during their semes
ter break. The Warriors are looking for their first
win of the trip after having lost to Fairfield and
Providence last week.
A victory for the Cards (8-6) will equal the
amount of victories they had last season in a 9-18
year.
Last year the two teams played twice in Hon
olulu, with Hawaii winning the opener 70-53 and
Stanford taking the second game, 66-65, on Per
ry's last second jumper.
Transfer
Six-foot-six Smith, who left UCLA because of
academic difficulties, leads the Rainbow Warriors
with a 22.4 point and six rebounds per contest.
Against the Cardinals last season at Maples
Smith hit on 50 per cent of his long-range jumpers
to come away with 14 points. He also came with
heckles from some fans who did not appreciate
his flair for shooting.
This year Smith's abilities have stood out even
more because he is not surrounded by two Ail-
Americans. But the Rainbow Warriors have three
players they can count on besides Smith.
Junior forward John Moore is the team's second
leading scorer, averaging 14.6 points and 5.8 re
bounds per game. He is connecting on 53 per cent
of his shots from the field.
In the backcourt, Gary Gray is the team's assist
leader and his backcourt mate, Robert Kelley, is
the team's third leading scorer.
"Hawaii plays multiple offenses and defenses,"
said Dißiaso, "so it's going to be difficult to pre
pare for them. How well we defend Smith will
have a direct bearing on how successful we are."
