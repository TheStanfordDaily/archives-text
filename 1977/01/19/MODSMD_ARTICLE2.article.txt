New Delhi, India — Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi, declaring her "unshak
able faith in the power of the people,"
announced yesterday that parliamen
tary elections would take place in
March as part of a major relaxation of
her 19-inonth-old emergency rule.
"Let us go to the polls with the re
solve to reaffirm the power of the
people and to uphold the fair name of
India as a land committed to the path
of reconciliation, peace and progress."
Gandhi said in an eight-minute na
tional broadcast.

The elections will be the first since
Gandhi proclaimed a state of
emergency June 26, 1975 following
her conviction on election fraud
charges. She suspended civil liberties,
jailed opposition leaders and imposed
press censorship, and said the mea
sures were needed to quell a "threat to
internal stability."
Year early
The government previously had
won parliament's approval to post
pone elections until March 1978. They
were origi na) ly set for last March at the

end of the regular five-year term of the
lower house of parliament.
Gandhi's surprise announcement
came three hours after the government
freed her arch political foe, former De
puty Prime Minister Morarji Desai,
and L.k. Advani, leader of the right
wing Hindu nationalist Jana Sangh
party. About a dozen parliamentarians
are still in jail, including Socialist
leader Raj Narain, sources said.
The 80-year-old Desai, considered
the most prominent opposition politi

cian in the country, had been impris
oned since the emergency began.
At the same time, the 59-year-old
prime minister warned that she would
not tolerate any disruption.
Normalized
"May 1 remind you that the
emergency was proclaimed because
the nation was far from normal," she
said. "Now that it is being nursed to
health, we must ensure that there is no
relapse."
Gandhi boasted of an improved
oconomy, containment of rampaging
inflation, increased industrial produc
tion, record food grain stocks, and new
social programs to eliminate dowries
and control population, all of which
she linked to her emergency rule.
Gandhi proclaimed the emergency
two weeks after she was found guilty
of misusing the services of govern
ment officials in her own parliamen
tary election campaign in 1971. Major
opposition parties demanded her res
ignation, but the supreme court over
turned her conviction in November
1975 after the laws under which she
was found guilty were rewritten re
troactively.

The 80-year-old Desai, considered
the most prominent opposition politi

At the same time, the 59-year-old
prime minister warned that she would
not tolerate any disruption.

"May 1 remind you that the
emergency was proclaimed because
the nation was far from normal," she
said. "Now that it is being nursed to

New Delhi, India — Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi, declaring her "unshak
able faith in the power of the people,"
announced yesterday that parliamen
tary elections would take place in
March as part of a major relaxation of
her 19-inonth-old emergency rule.
"Let us go to the polls with the re
solve to reaffirm the power of the
people and to uphold the fair name of
India as a land committed to the path
of reconciliation, peace and progress."
Gandhi said in an eight-minute na
tional broadcast.

The elections will be the first since
Gandhi proclaimed a state of
emergency June 26, 1975 following
her conviction on election fraud
charges. She suspended civil liberties,
jailed opposition leaders and imposed
press censorship, and said the mea
sures were needed to quell a "threat to
internal stability."
Year early
The government previously had
won parliament's approval to post
pone elections until March 1978. They
were origi na) ly set for last March at the

end of the regular five-year term of the
lower house of parliament.
Gandhi's surprise announcement
came three hours after the government
freed her arch political foe, former De
puty Prime Minister Morarji Desai,
and L.k. Advani, leader of the right
wing Hindu nationalist Jana Sangh
party. About a dozen parliamentarians
are still in jail, including Socialist
leader Raj Narain, sources said.
