# Olympic Gold medalist Mike Bruner tries to cope with fame
## 
### Jill Lieber 
Mike Bruner is willing to be
himself at the expense of
what others think of him. Any
resentment toward hirn prob
ably stems from an envy that
he has such a strong self
identity.
Bruner radiates self
confidence. He sticks out in a
crowd. It's easy to see he has
done something in life — that
he has reached the goals
which he set out to do. He is
not just another point getter
on the Stanford swim team.
Bruner has charisma, but
not in the sense of outward
appearance. His likeableness
is formed out of respect — re
spect for his self-discipline,
for the fact that he's got his
head on straight, and for his
individuality, which often
times separates him from
others making him insecure
and wondering 'maybe I
should be like everyone else.'
"Everybody gets mad at me
because I'm too outgoing," he
said. "I just like to be me. I'm
not trying to hurt anybody's
feelings.
"It was bad in high school. I
was going out with a girl and

she yelled out in the hall one
day that 1 was the most con
ceited person 9he'd ever met.
It really hurt inside."
Team spirit
Bruner said he swims not
for himself but for the team
and he teases teammates to
get them going.
"I like to bug Jon Powell
about the fact that I beat him
in the 100 free in workout be
cause it makes him go faster.
He never swam any faster
than this in the beginning of
the season.
"The point is he went a
second faster in workout than
he's ever gone in workout,
and I got him motivated."
Bruner openly complains
that he doesn't have much of a
social life yet he admits that if
he wanted an active social life
he could do something about
it. Last season in working for
the Olympics he was totally
dedicated to swimming —
going almost 2.5 million
yards. Now as he devotes less
time to the sport, he sees that
few girls meet his expecta
tions.
"Last year life was boring,"
he said. "I didn't go out and it

was lonely at times. To be
honest, I don't know if I want
to get involved — girls have a
tendency of getting in the
way.
"It bugs the hell out of me
that guys have to ask girls out
all the time. Because I can't —
I fear rejection.
"Hell, I can swim fast but
that doesn't mean I'm a good
person — that doesn't mean
people will like me. Just be
cause I have my head on
straight and I can swim fast
doesn't mean I have my head
on straight for relations with
other people."
This year fame has been
hard for Bruner to cope with.
He's been tagged as "the guy
who won the two Olympic
gold medals."
After the Olympics Bruner
received loads of blank self
addressed stamped post cards
to autograph. Friends ap
peared from nowhere and he
was contacted to do a baby
shampoo commercial.
Free to be me
"I don't want anybody to
know that I won gold medals
because it hinders how they
act toward me. I was intro

duced to a girl at the pool one
day and she said, "Don't 1
know you from somewhere?'
And I thought, 'Oh, God, she
knows.' The she said, 'We
ren't you in a class of mine?'
And I realized she didn't
know and I loved that. Then
people get to know me for
what I am and not for some
thing I did."
However Bruner went on to
say, "I like little kids to know
what I did in the Olympics.
You can impress kids. It's im
portant because very few kids
today have anybody to look
up to."
Bruner said the only time
he has ever been completely
satisfied with his life is the
moment he touched the wall
in winning the 200 fly at
Montreal.
Olympic letdown
"Everyone expected me to
have a really super birthday
because it was right in the
middle of the Games, but it
was the worst birthday I've
had in my entire life. Every
body was on their own trip —
swimming wasn't over with.
We had a team meeting and at
the end they presented me
with a cake and said "Happy
Birthday" and walked out of
the room. They had other
things to do. Nobody hung
around to have any cake."
Terror as a tot
Bruner is an engineering
major with a career in interior
design in the future.
"I knew that I was going to
be an electrical engineer
when I was a little kid. I used
to shove bobby pins in the
light socket all the time.
"My mom was going to
have a kid every two years —
three kids in all. She had my
sister and then I came along.
God, she had to wait four
years before she could handle
another kid like me."
