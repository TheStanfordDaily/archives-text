Brezhnev encourages strong U.S. ties
Moscow—Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev said yester
day the Soviet Union is prepared to make a "new major
advance" in better relations with the administration of
President-elect Jimmy Carter. He said top priority would
go to an agreement on limiting nuclear weapons. "We are
prepared jointly with the new administration in the Un
ited States to accomplish a new major advance in relations
between our countries," the 70-year-old Soviet leader
said.
"First of all, as we are convinced, it is necessary to
complete in the nearest future the drafting of the agree
ment on limiting strategic armaments on the basis that we
had reached in Vladivostok in 1974."
Committee continues Bell hearings
Washington— Returning to ranks after the controversy
that undid one of President-elect Jimmy Carter's nomina
tions, senate committees approved yesterday the ap
pointments of eight top administration officials.
Three cabinet nominees have yet to be approved, but
only one of them, Atty. General-designate Griffin Bell,
faces any significant opposition.
The Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled more hear
ings today to be followed by a vote this afternoon. Bell's
confirmation hearings already have lasted five days.
Bell has been challenged over his civil rights record
which he insists cast him as a Southern moderate when
there were not many to be found, and over his membership
in two clubs in Atlanta and one in Savannah which do not
accept black or women members. He said his letter of
resignation went to the clubs yesterday.
Ford ponders White House run in '80
Washington—President Gerald Ford said "maybe"
when some Republican mayors suggested yesterday that
he try to recapture the White House in 1980.
After leading two dozen Republican mayors on a
farewell visit with Ford, Cleveland Mayor Ralph Perk,
president of the National Conference of Republican
Mayors, told reporters he had suggested to Ford that the
president try to regain the White House.
"He just said 'maybe,"' Perk reported.
Perk cited the example of Grover Cleveland, the only
U.S. president who served two terms that were not con
secutive. Cleveland won the presidency in 1884, lost it
four years later to Benjamin Harrison, then ran against
Harrison again in 1892 and won a second term.
U.S. automakers to sell airbags
Washington—Transportation Secretary William
Coleman Jr. announced yesterday that two U.S. automak
ers have agreed to sell air bags on half a million cars
during a two-year period starting in late 1979.
Coleman announced that General Motors and Ford both
had agreed to his plan to market a fleet of cars equipped
with the space age safety devices.
Coleman said three insurance companies—Allstate,
Nationwide and Volkswagen Insurance—have agreed to
offer premium reductions of up to 30 per cent on medical
coverage insurance for purchasers of air-bag equipped
cars.

The government is interested in passive devices be
cause only about 30 per cent of all drivers buckle up their
seat belts.

Midwest, East slowed by harsh winter
Washington—Energy conservation, a theme from the
days of oil embargoes, was a stark reality to many in the
Midwest and East yesterday as severe winter cold main
