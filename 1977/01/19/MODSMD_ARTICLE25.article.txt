### Jim Tranquada Staff writer 
The university is planning to even
tually phase out financial support of
the ASSU, ASSU financial manager
Chris Mathe said on KZSU's Campus
Conference last night.
"(The university) is looking to phase
out as much as they can and try and
make us self-sufficient," Mathe said.
Although the amount of university
support has been steadily declining
recently, "we'll still get some support,
for the next two years at least," he said.
This year the ASSU received approxi
mately $60,000 from the university.
Currently the ASSU is following a
"much more aggressive" investment
policy that will provide "for an ex
panding financial base from which to
work that will grow as the ASSU
grows," Mathe said.
Emphasizing the "break even"
orientation of ASSU projects, and dec
laring that "I view service much more
than I do profit," Mathe denied a re
cent Chaparral claim that Flicks man
ager Steve Fugaro was receiving 20 per
cent of the Flick's gross income. He
stated that Fugaro actually receives
two per cent of the gross, in addition
to a guaranteed $30-a-show, which av
erages out to "about $50 a week or
less." The exact salary is "privately
negotiated"and "viewed as personal,"
according to Mathe.
