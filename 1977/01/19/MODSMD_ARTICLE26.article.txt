# Ms. Rodden elected editor

### 
« For the first time in six years, the
J staff of the Stanford Daily has cho
* sen a woman as editor. The last time
« it happened, the Palo Alto police
* responded with an illegal and un
* constitutional raid upon the Daily
« offices.
* The editor-elect is Bonny Rod
+ den, a senior majoring in history.
« Her 4V2-month term begins Jan. 31.
* She predicts a springtime ful 1 of of
* tice parties, not search parties.
* "I hope 1 can make the Daily a
J really fun place to be and set a tone
+ that will allow a good morale," she
X said last night.
* Rodden, a 21-year-old native of
* San Francisco, said her gender
4 would not affect the paper's opera
* tion.
* "I do not expect my sex will in
* fluence the running of the paper,"
* she said. "I do feel a responsibility
* to minorities. Perhaps because I'm a

woman, I do realize there are
minorities in the community. I'm
not going to try to promote my own
feelings in the editorial policy just
because I'm a woman.
"There are a lot of people we're
not representing in our coverage,"
she added.
Pictures may be boxed, produc
ing a cleaner-looking paper, and the
front-page masthead may change,
predicted the former "Bug Me"
columnist and news editor.
Rodden is currently executive
editor of the Daily, a position which
includes staff recruitment and
training. She said she will provide
more guidance to the staff in her
position as editor.
"When fee assessment time
comes around, I want the Daily to
have reached the point where
people will have no doubt about
supporting it," she concluded.
