# Mars surface mapped
## Profs analyze Viking I data 
### J.P. Monen 
Six months after Viking 1 landed on
Mars, four professors here are still ac
tive in the ongoing Martian project.
Sidney Liebes Jr., Elliot Levinthal,
Joshua Lederberg and Leonard Tyler
were instrumental in planning the
successful landing portion of the mis
sion. They will be collecting and
analyzing data transmitted from the
Viking landers for about two more
years.
Liebes and Levinthal, of the Gene
tics Department, were part of the re
search team which developed the
sophisticated cameras now operating
on the landers.
They spent most of last year living in
Pasadena and working at the Jet Prop
ulsion Laboratory there. Their main
duties were to analyze pictures of the
terrain immediately surrounding the
landers and make recommendations as
to where the scoops should collect soil
samples. Liebes explained that to do
this, the images had to be converted
from two to three dimensions with the
aid of a computer.
Three dimensional maps
A similar process is now being used
to create a three dimensional topog
raphical map of the Martian surface
visible from the lander. According to
Levinthal, Mars is entering a period of
seasonal changes characterized by
higher winds and dust storms. With
the changes in atmosphere and wind,
and thus changes in the landscape, op
tical depths and distances can be more
easily put into perspective.
Tyler, of the Electrical Engineering
Department, was responsible for scan
ning the landing sites by radar to de
termine their safety and smoothness.
He is now participating in various ex
periments relating to physics. He said
that an experiment just completed, a
test case for Einstein's theory of re
lativity was observed.
The path of radio signals traveling at
the speed of light which were being
transmitted from Mars were plotted.
By comparing observations of the sig
nal as it passed unobstructed through
space, just as the planet disappeared
behind the sun in November and as it
reappeared last month, it was deter
miner! that the signal was actually
slowed or "warped" by the huge gravi
tational field of the sun, as predicted
by Einstein's theory.
Searching for life
Lederberg, chairman of the Genetics
Department, played a critical role in
the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration's broad planning de
cisions on where and how to explore
the planet. He was also part of the team

which interpreted the biological data
sent back from the red planet.
The debate over the existance of life
on the planet continues, and, Levint
hal commented that "the results are
puzzling at best." He added that the
possibility of life on Mars has not been
ruled out, but feels that a "wetter" spot

would be more likely to support a life
form.
The search for such a spot continues,
as do plans for future Martian projects.
According to Levinthal, plans for an
unmanned Martian rover are now in the
conceptual stage and may become real
ity as soon as the next decade.
