fellow from 1973 to 1974.
The Franklins' son John was an an
thropology graduate here in 1973.
Franklin was notified of his selec
tion as commencement speaker De
cember 28. Word of his acceptance of
the invitation arrived last Wednesday,
according to Dorsey. In his letter of
acceptance, Franklin said he has "a lot
of respect for Stanford" and "wel
comes the chance to come here."
Exhaustive search
According to Dorsey, an invitation
to speak at commencement services
here is considered a special honor
since it is one of the few honors the
university gives. Stanford gives no
honorary degrees.
"The selection was an exhausting
one," said Dorsey. Franklin's choice
was the result of narrowing down an
original list of 25U candidates. Sugges
tions were submitted by under
graduates, graduate students and pro
fessors.
