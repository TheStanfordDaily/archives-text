# Carter faces problems inherent in system
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Fourth of a five-part series
Jimmy Carter has promised, among
other things, that the inaugural ad
dress he will deliver tomorrow as he
becomes the 39th president of the Un
ited States will be mercifully brief. In
that same new spirit will be the explo
ration of the opportunities and chal
lenges facing the 52-year-old Georgian
peanut planter as he assumes Ameri
ca's most powerful office.
The presidential mantle that Jimmy
Carter will inherit when lie is inaugu
rated tomorrow has been passed on
under some unusual and trying cir
cumstances in recent years.
John Kennedy was removed from
the presidency by an assassin's bullet;
Lyndon Johnson, largely because of
massive opposition to the conduct of
the war in Vietnam; Richard Nixon by
scandal and the threat of impeach
ment; and Gerald Ford by his inability
to earn an electoral mandate he never
had.
Carter is therefore faced with re
establishing the authority and stability
of his high office at a time when a wide
variety of important problems demand
solutions.
Diverse needs
Most of these problems, both domes
tic and foreign, are in fact connected to
and derived from a common
dilemma—how to provide a large
population with the necessities and
comforts they need and want in an era
of simultaneously diminishing re
sources and escalating expectations.
The problems that Carter will have
to deal with in his administration such
as unemployment vs. inflation, in
dustrial production vs. pollution and
social services vs. taxes all stem from
inherent contradictions that now are
emerging more completely as the
American economy and society con
tinue to develop and mature in lcconi
with their long-standing principle
This principle is that the public and
private good is best served by each in
dividual seeking to maximize his or
her own status.
It appears at this point thai Carter is
goin# to try to solve the problems that
have emerged from this system by ap
olvinu those methods which havpcon

stituted America's most characteristic
contribution to world culture and
which have been prominently man
ifested in Carter's own successive
careers as naval officer, peanut farmer
and politician.
Confidence
These traits include know-how and
an abiding confidence in self and
higher powers. These perhaps con
tradictory attributes emerged during
Carter's campaign for the presidency
as "competence and compassion," in
his simultaneous appeal for votes on
the basis of his ability and skill in run
ning a government or a business and
his constant plea to voters to trust him
because he would never lie to them. He
promised to restore their faith in their
government.
A corollary to these major assump
tions, the efficacy of determination
and hard work in solving any problem,
characterized Carter's 2-year quest for
the presidency and the relatively calm
days of the presidential transition
period.
Cabinet reflects leader
Carter has selected a cabinet and
mapped out tentative policies for the
beginning of his administration in ac
cord with these same principles of
competence, compassion and self
reliance. Most of his choices for
cabinet positions share important
elements of his own life and career
history—humble origins, high intelli
gence, steely will, great ambition, tire
less work habits and significant
achievement by their late 40s or early
50s in one or more fields.
The direction in which Carter seems
to be taking his fledgling ndministra
tive team as it begins its tenure in
power also seems to be characterized,
as a collectivity, by the same princi
ples that Carter and each of his appoin
tees have used successfully in their in
dividual past- a careful surveillance
of the terrain, an energetic effort to
master the intricacies of the operation,
a willingness to innovate within estab
lished forms and a determination to
apply generally-proven principles of
decision-making and problem solving
to particular situations and condi
tions.

The problems that Carter will have
to deal with in his administration such

inherent contradictions that now are

American economy and society con

Confidence
These traits include know-how and
an abiding confidence in self and
higher powers. These perhaps con
tradictory attributes emerged during
Carter's campaign for the presidency
as "competence and compassion," in
his simultaneous appeal for votes on
the basis of his ability and skill in run
ning a government or a business and
his constant plea to voters to trust him
because he would never lie to them. He
promised to restore their faith in their
government.
A corollary to these major assump
tions, the efficacy of determination
and hard work in solving any problem,

Cabinet reflects leader
Carter has selected a cabinet and
mapped out tentative policies for the
beginning of his administration in ac
cord with these same principles of
competence, compassion and self
reliance. Most of his choices for
cabinet positions share important
elements of his own life and career
history—humble origins, high intelli
gence, steely will, great ambition, tire
less work habits and significant
achievement by their late 40s or early
50s in one or more fields.
The direction in which Carter seems
to be taking his fledgling ndministra
tive team as it begins its tenure in
power also seems to be characterized,
as a collectivity, by the same princi
ples that Carter and each of his appoin
tees have used successfully in their in
dividual past- a careful surveillance
of the terrain, an energetic effort to
master the intricacies of the operation,
a willingness to innovate within estab
lished forms and a determination to
apply generally-proven principles of
decision-making and problem solving
to particular situations and condi
tions.
Fourth of a five-part series
Jimmy Carter has promised, among
other things, that the inaugural ad
dress he will deliver tomorrow as he
becomes the 39th president of the Un
ited States will be mercifully brief. In
that same new spirit will be the explo
ration of the opportunities and chal
lenges facing the 52-year-old Georgian
peanut planter as he assumes Ameri
ca's most powerful office.
The presidential mantle that Jimmy
Carter will inherit when lie is inaugu
rated tomorrow has been passed on
under some unusual and trying cir
cumstances in recent years.
John Kennedy was removed from
the presidency by an assassin's bullet;
Lyndon Johnson, largely because of
massive opposition to the conduct of
the war in Vietnam; Richard Nixon by
scandal and the threat of impeach
ment; and Gerald Ford by his inability
to earn an electoral mandate he never
had.
Carter is therefore faced with re
establishing the authority and stability
of his high office at a time when a wide
variety of important problems demand
solutions.
Diverse needs
Most of these problems, both domes
tic and foreign, are in fact connected to
and derived from a common
dilemma—how to provide a large
population with the necessities and
comforts they need and want in an era
of simultaneously diminishing re
sources and escalating expectations.
