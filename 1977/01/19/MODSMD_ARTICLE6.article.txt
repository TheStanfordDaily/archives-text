## Overseas studies 
### 
With rumors of the closure of Stanford-in-
Berlin and the transfer of Stanford-in-Britain
from its present Cliveden setting, overseas
studies has once again become a hotly debated
issue.
In the Berlin case, the university is in a dif
ficult position, subject as it is to the potential
unwillingness of the Berlin government to con
tinue providing the campus rent-free.
It is by no means certain that Berlin will in
the end decide to discontinue its subsidy to the
campus. A prudent course for the university,
however, would be to begin exploring alterna
tives to the campus in Berlin. We suggest that,
should Berlin have to close, the university relo
cate the German language center in another
major city already containing a university with
which Stanford may cooperate.
The university is considering moving
Stanford-in-Britain to an urban setting. London
and Oxford, among other areas, have been men
tioned as possible alternative locations. This

may not, however, be possible. Though we be
lieve there are disadvantages to the Cliveden
setting, if it is not possible to relocate the cam
pus in an acceptable environment we believe
the program should be retained at Cliveden for
the immediate future.
However, we do have misgivings about the
necessity of an overseas campus in an English
speaking environment. An American island in
a foreign language area may be a necessity for
students whose expertise in the language is not
great, but there is little need for a separate
American community in a nation with a lan
guage and culture as similar to ours as England.
For this reason, we believe the university
should explore the possibility of working out
exchange agreements with English universities
to facilitate Stanford students' attendance. In
this way, the university could retain study in
England as a reasonable alternative for its stu
dents without the maintenance of a special
facility.
