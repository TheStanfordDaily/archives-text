# Virgins have rights, too

Upon reading Chris Gray's "Chapar
ral Quiz" (Daily, Jan. 17) one is im
mediately aware of the unabashed bit
terness of the intent, and though his
animosity is probably well-founded,
his method of attack is slanderous to
another innocent group, namely vir
gins.
Gray seems to view virginity as a
qualitative evil and has happily con
cluded that the alleged sexism of the
publication stems from the sexual dis
qualification of its staff. He goes on to
also impute that the despicable traits
of ambition, homophobia, paranoia,
and cynism are all caused by the "un
initiated" sexual status.
As president of the United Virgin
Anti-Defamation League (UVADL) I
find Gray's implications to be a vicious
calumnitory assault on virginity and
its votaries, caused by hedonistically
promiscuous orientation indicative of
a limited and probably exploitive view
of sex.
To equate virginity with sexism or
any such onerous quality is senseless,
as chastity is inherently and proudly
universalistic and egalitarian in both
its form and its outlook. Virgins are

proud, upstanding human beings who
have an energetic love of life, an ap
preciation of the aesthetically un
spoiled and a devout propensity to
ward what is good and pure in the
world.
Many virgi ns, through their courage
and conviction, have become revered
as enduring symbols of righteous
strength. Sir Percival of the Grail,
Thomas a Beckett, Joan of Arc and
Lawrence of Arabia are among these,
not to mention the mother of our
savior.
There were three virgins in the boat
when Washington crossed the Dela
ware and it is well known that many of
the signers of the Declaration of Inde
pendence were virgins at one time or
another.
The sexually unexperienced have
been instrumental in conservation
movements, being responsible for the
creation and maintenance of virgin
forests and territories and world over.
And what skier doesn't thank them for
the chasteness of driven snow. Virgins
have long been respected for their ef
forts in pure science as well as more

recently in the naming of Sonny and
Cher's child.
Thus, in view of the many contribu
tions of virgins to the world past and
present, Gray might be well advised to
reevaluate his malice toward the
chaste and perhaps his own sexuality.
(Because one may enjoy the singular
distinction of having remained totally
devirgined since birth is no reason to
libel others). After all, everybody is a
virgin; at least for a little while.
