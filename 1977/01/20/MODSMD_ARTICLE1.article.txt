# Transition specializes its services

The Transition, the fast food re
staurant at Tresidder, has adopted a
new cashier system that saves the cus
tomer time and increases efficiency,
according to John Martin, Transition
manager.
Formerly, one person at the service
counter had to take the order, serve the
food and act as cashier. Under the new
system, which began last week, four
cashiers take payment for food at the
exit. Martin said he feels this change
has improved service.
"The major reason for the new sys
tem," Martin said, "was to speed up
service at lunchtime. Now the cashier
can handle payment for the food and
the person at the counter can concen
trate on taking orders. Each person be
comes more proficient at their particu
lar duty and the net result is saving the
customer time."
Smaller work force
Martin said the new system has in
creased efficiency so much that a smal
ler work force is needed. With four re
gisters to handle the customers, Martin
said that he had "never seen more than
five people waiting in a line."
Jim Winzler, a sophomore who fre
quents the Transition at lunch, agreed
with Martin that the change was posi
tive. "I think this system is much bet
ter. I won't say it's great, but it defi
nitely saves time and is an improve
ment over the old set-up."
Martin said other changes, includ
ing self-service drinks and possibly a
health-food bar, are being planned.
Martin was not sure when these fea
tures would be added.
Martin, who last year was the man
ager of Encina Commons, has added
several new features to the Transition
since he began as manager at the start
of the year, including the "Hof Brau"
and a greater menu variety at lunch.
Not so well
According to Hob Caselli, food ser
vice director at Tresidder, the Transi
tion made a 4-5 per cent profit last year
but was not doing as well autumn
quarter this year, showing only about a
one per cent profit. Caselli em
phasized, however, that the change in
format at the Transition was not due to
the decline in business.
Caselli said the Transition has been
making more money every year since
TDS took the operation over in 1972-
73, when it showed a large deficit
under university controls.
One proposed change in the food
service at Tresidder that will not be
adopted in the near future is the addi
tion of a student pub, according to Dan
Williams, associate dean of students
and director of Tresidder Union.
A faculty-student group had been
organized to discuss the problem, but
Williams said it had made no progress.
