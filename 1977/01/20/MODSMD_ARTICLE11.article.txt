# Filmmaking trends evoke despair

### 
A killer shark, a blond nun, a
mothballed mafioso . . . what do these
three characters have in common?
They represent the three best selling
movies of all time: Jaws, The Sound of
Music and The Godfather respec
tively.
But suddenly, out of the gloom of
Tokyo's cinematic files, a new figure
emerges to threaten the quaint con
glomerate of copiously coin-garnering
greats . . . King Kong.
Yes, in a single week the 40-foot-tall
gorilla-type primate grossed almost $7
million, opening in 1000 theaters. But
can the humongous ape outsell the
great white shark?
Jaws, as lifeguards everywhere re
member, made its lucky seven million
in its first three days running while
playing in only 400 theaters; and has
taken fully $192 million in since that
record week 18 months ago.
But Dino De Laurentiis, producer of
the film featuring the regal gorilla,
predicts that his protagonist will draw
a total of $200 million, $100 million of
that by the end of January.
Gay Paris
Indeed the film grossed over 27 mill
ion bucks in its first two weeks. Still, as
the 49-foot-high monstrous beast was
paraded through the streets of gay
Paris, it appeared that the race for all
time billing was on.
Now, it may occur to the innocent
bystander that John Q. Public is more
than willing to dish out three and one
half pieces of paper displaying the
father of our country's portrait to see
such trash. So much is obvious. The
pseudo-intellectual, however, will
discern three distinct trends in the av
erage person's entertainment behavior
patterns.
The first theory centers on the con
cept of the supranatural anti-hero
monster of which Kong is the latest
example.
Well-made flick
It all began with laws, actually a
well-made flick put together by the
young and talented director Steven
Spielberg. I left Jaws feeling I'd read
Moby Dick in two hours. Of course, the

film did produce interesting side ef
fects.
I was living in a small New England
town near the Cape when I saw Jaws
and although the region is famous for
its swimming, fishing and boating re
creational facilities I spent the rest of
the summer working on my backhand.

Then came Survive, based on the
best selling book A Jive. The depiction
of cannibalism in this movie shocked
many omniverous audiences. But ac
tually, the jump from sharks eating
people to people eating people is only
a small step in the supranatural anti
hero syndrome. Using these two
examples, I extrapolated and now pre
dict phase three of the cinematic
phenomenon under study — a movie
that pictures graphic sharkabalism or
one that shows sharks eating sharks.
Border the silly
Do I border the silly if not the inane?
Just wait till you see what producer De
Laurentiis has in store for you this
spring.
Even before Spielberg can bring us

the American Dental Association pre
miere benefit of Jaws 11, screens across
the country will project the image of
De Laurentiis' "man and killer whale
epic" — Orca, which will star Richard
Harris.
This gruesome odyssey, called
"Jaws on Ice" by many Hollywood in
siders, should exhaust the marine ter
rorist audiences.
But what does the silver screen hold
in store for the land lubber popula
tion? Would you believe a nine foot
tall white buffalo, entitled, incredul
ously, "The White Buffalo" which will
do battle with the watermelon man
himself, Charles Bronson? Bronson's
death wish might soon be fulfilled by
critics across the country.
Dare not speculate
By the way, why are all these sharks,
Moby whales and buffalos white? Do
they represent purity or pure evil or
even a well known campus plaza? I do
not dare speculate on the ramifications
of this insight.
Turning to the second disturbing
trend in current cinema, one observes
a peculiar fascination with the occult.
Beginning with Roman Polanski's
Rosemary's Baby, the public's clamor
subsequently brought The Exorcist
and The Omen to theaters and drive
ins near us.
Why intelligent humans actually
harbor a trace of the suspicion that
children are sources of evil really wor
ries me. Is this a real symptom of a

society whose declining birth rate
stems from economic straits and
family planning, or do we enjoy being
treated to viewing Linda Blair vomit
upon religious leaders of various dio
ceses?
Occult trend
Between the occult trend and the
monster variety, you'd think we'd just
wait until these movies came on TV
next year. But a third category of films
merits some mention, however minis
cule.
I refer of course to the disaster epics:
Airport, Earthquake, The Towering In
ferno, ad nauseum. Where has
dialogue gone, character, romance?
Has Charlton Heston finally re
placed Bogart, and Jessica Lange In
grid Bergman? Has the Apocalypse
now finally hit with Magnum Force
not even giving us a Two Minute
Warning to leave the theater?
As I despaired over the fate of Hol
lywood, unable to conceive of
movies worse than the monster, devil,
or disaster species, unwilling to face
another Kong, shark or killer water
buffalo in the eye, filmmakers cruelly
created the culmination of such course
crudesence .. . presenting Barbra
Streisand in A Star is Born. And
whether or not she is a monster, I can
only be sure that the movie is a disas
ter.

siders, should exhaust the marine ter
rorist audiences.
But what does the silver screen hold
in store for the land lubber popula

tall white buffalo, entitled, incredul
ously, "The White Buffalo" which will
do battle with the watermelon man
himself, Charles Bronson? Bronson's
death wish might soon be fulfilled by
critics across the country.
Dare not speculate
By the way, why are all these sharks,
Moby whales and buffalos white? Do
they represent purity or pure evil or
even a well known campus plaza? I do
not dare speculate on the ramifications
of this insight.
Turning to the second disturbing
trend in current cinema, one observes
a peculiar fascination with the occult.
Beginning with Roman Polanski's
Rosemary's Baby, the public's clamor
subsequently brought The Exorcist
and The Omen to theaters and drive

Why intelligent humans actually
harbor a trace of the suspicion that
children are sources of evil really wor
ries me. Is this a real symptom of a

society whose declining birth rate
stems from economic straits and
family planning, or do we enjoy being
treated to viewing Linda Blair vomit
upon religious leaders of various dio
ceses?
Occult trend
Between the occult trend and the
monster variety, you'd think we'd just
wait until these movies came on TV
next year. But a third category of films
merits some mention, however minis
cule.
I refer of course to the disaster epics:
Airport, Earthquake, The Towering In

dialogue gone, character, romance?
Has Charlton Heston finally re
placed Bogart, and Jessica Lange In

now finally hit with Magnum Force
not even giving us a Two Minute
Warning to leave the theater?
As I despaired over the fate of Hol
lywood, unable to conceive of
movies worse than the monster, devil,
or disaster species, unwilling to face
another Kong, shark or killer water
buffalo in the eye, filmmakers cruelly
created the culmination of such course
crudesence .. . presenting Barbra
Streisand in A Star is Born. And
whether or not she is a monster, I can
only be sure that the movie is a disas

A killer shark, a blond nun, a
mothballed mafioso . . . what do these
three characters have in common?
They represent the three best selling
movies of all time: Jaws, The Sound of
Music and The Godfather respec
tively.
But suddenly, out of the gloom of
Tokyo's cinematic files, a new figure
emerges to threaten the quaint con
glomerate of copiously coin-garnering
greats . . . King Kong.
Yes, in a single week the 40-foot-tall
gorilla-type primate grossed almost $7
million, opening in 1000 theaters. But
can the humongous ape outsell the
great white shark?
Jaws, as lifeguards everywhere re
member, made its lucky seven million
in its first three days running while
playing in only 400 theaters; and has
taken fully $192 million in since that
record week 18 months ago.
But Dino De Laurentiis, producer of
the film featuring the regal gorilla,
predicts that his protagonist will draw
a total of $200 million, $100 million of
that by the end of January.
Gay Paris
Indeed the film grossed over 27 mill
ion bucks in its first two weeks. Still, as
the 49-foot-high monstrous beast was
paraded through the streets of gay
Paris, it appeared that the race for all
time billing was on.
Now, it may occur to the innocent
bystander that John Q. Public is more
than willing to dish out three and one
half pieces of paper displaying the
father of our country's portrait to see
such trash. So much is obvious. The
pseudo-intellectual, however, will
discern three distinct trends in the av
erage person's entertainment behavior
patterns.
The first theory centers on the con
cept of the supranatural anti-hero
monster of which Kong is the latest
example.
Well-made flick
It all began with laws, actually a
well-made flick put together by the
young and talented director Steven
Spielberg. I left Jaws feeling I'd read
Moby Dick in two hours. Of course, the

film did produce interesting side ef
fects.
I was living in a small New England
town near the Cape when I saw Jaws
and although the region is famous for
its swimming, fishing and boating re
creational facilities I spent the rest of
the summer working on my backhand.

Then came Survive, based on the
best selling book A Jive. The depiction
of cannibalism in this movie shocked
many omniverous audiences. But ac
tually, the jump from sharks eating
people to people eating people is only
a small step in the supranatural anti
hero syndrome. Using these two
examples, I extrapolated and now pre
dict phase three of the cinematic
phenomenon under study — a movie
that pictures graphic sharkabalism or
one that shows sharks eating sharks.
Border the silly
Do I border the silly if not the inane?
Just wait till you see what producer De
Laurentiis has in store for you this
spring.
Even before Spielberg can bring us

the American Dental Association pre
miere benefit of Jaws 11, screens across
the country will project the image of
De Laurentiis' "man and killer whale
epic" — Orca, which will star Richard
Harris.

predicts that his protagonist will draw
a total of $200 million, $100 million of
that by the end of January.
Gay Paris
Indeed the film grossed over 27 mill
ion bucks in its first two weeks. Still, as
the 49-foot-high monstrous beast was
paraded through the streets of gay
Paris, it appeared that the race for all
time billing was on.
Now, it may occur to the innocent
bystander that John Q. Public is more
than willing to dish out three and one
half pieces of paper displaying the
father of our country's portrait to see
such trash. So much is obvious. The
pseudo-intellectual, however, will
discern three distinct trends in the av
erage person's entertainment behavior
patterns.
The first theory centers on the con
cept of the supranatural anti-hero
monster of which Kong is the latest
example.
Well-made flick
It all began with laws, actually a
well-made flick put together by the
young and talented director Steven
Spielberg. I left Jaws feeling I'd read
Moby Dick in two hours. Of course, the

film did produce interesting side ef
fects.
I was living in a small New England
town near the Cape when I saw Jaws
and although the region is famous for
its swimming, fishing and boating re
creational facilities I spent the rest of
the summer working on my backhand.

Then came Survive, based on the
best selling book A Jive. The depiction
of cannibalism in this movie shocked
many omniverous audiences. But ac
tually, the jump from sharks eating
people to people eating people is only
a small step in the supranatural anti
hero syndrome. Using these two
examples, I extrapolated and now pre
dict phase three of the cinematic
phenomenon under study — a movie
that pictures graphic sharkabalism or
one that shows sharks eating sharks.
Border the silly
Do I border the silly if not the inane?
Just wait till you see what producer De
Laurentiis has in store for you this
spring.
Even before Spielberg can bring us

the American Dental Association pre
miere benefit of Jaws 11, screens across
the country will project the image of
De Laurentiis' "man and killer whale
epic" — Orca, which will star Richard
Harris.
This gruesome odyssey, called
"Jaws on Ice" by many Hollywood in
siders, should exhaust the marine ter
rorist audiences.
But what does the silver screen hold
in store for the land lubber popula
tion? Would you believe a nine foot
tall white buffalo, entitled, incredul
ously, "The White Buffalo" which will
do battle with the watermelon man
himself, Charles Bronson? Bronson's
death wish might soon be fulfilled by
critics across the country.
Dare not speculate
By the way, why are all these sharks,
Moby whales and buffalos white? Do
they represent purity or pure evil or
even a well known campus plaza? I do
not dare speculate on the ramifications
of this insight.
Turning to the second disturbing
trend in current cinema, one observes
a peculiar fascination with the occult.
Beginning with Roman Polanski's
Rosemary's Baby, the public's clamor
subsequently brought The Exorcist
and The Omen to theaters and drive
ins near us.
Why intelligent humans actually
harbor a trace of the suspicion that
children are sources of evil really wor
ries me. Is this a real symptom of a

society whose declining birth rate
stems from economic straits and
family planning, or do we enjoy being
treated to viewing Linda Blair vomit
upon religious leaders of various dio
ceses?
Occult trend
Between the occult trend and the
monster variety, you'd think we'd just
wait until these movies came on TV
next year. But a third category of films
merits some mention, however minis
cule.
I refer of course to the disaster epics:
Airport, Earthquake, The Towering In
ferno, ad nauseum. Where has
dialogue gone, character, romance?
Has Charlton Heston finally re
placed Bogart, and Jessica Lange In
grid Bergman? Has the Apocalypse
now finally hit with Magnum Force
not even giving us a Two Minute
Warning to leave the theater?
As I despaired over the fate of Hol
lywood, unable to conceive of
movies worse than the monster, devil,
or disaster species, unwilling to face
another Kong, shark or killer water
buffalo in the eye, filmmakers cruelly
created the culmination of such course
crudesence .. . presenting Barbra
Streisand in A Star is Born. And
whether or not she is a monster, I can
only be sure that the movie is a disas
ter.

A killer shark, a blond nun, a
mothballed mafioso . . . what do these
three characters have in common?
They represent the three best selling
movies of all time: Jaws, The Sound of
Music and The Godfather respec
tively.
But suddenly, out of the gloom of
Tokyo's cinematic files, a new figure
emerges to threaten the quaint con
glomerate of copiously coin-garnering
greats . . . King Kong.
Yes, in a single week the 40-foot-tall
gorilla-type primate grossed almost $7
million, opening in 1000 theaters. But
can the humongous ape outsell the
great white shark?
Jaws, as lifeguards everywhere re
member, made its lucky seven million
in its first three days running while
playing in only 400 theaters; and has
taken fully $192 million in since that
record week 18 months ago.
But Dino De Laurentiis, producer of
the film featuring the regal gorilla,
