Rick Morrow's letter in the Jan. 17
Daily misstates the reasoning of the
Committee on Foreign Study Programs
(C-FSP) in determining that the
studies center at Cliveden has lowest
priority to be continued if the overseas
studies' budget reductions force clos
ing of still another center.
The C-FSP did not determine that
because "we speak the same language
as the British . . . the academic and/or
social experience in England will be of
less educational significance than at
other foreign campuses," as Morrow
states it.
Rather, the C-FSP stated that be
cause there is no real language barrier
between England and the United
States, access to study and travel in
England is greater for Stanford under
graduates than it is for countries where
there is a greater language barrier, and,
therefore, if any center has to be the
next to be closed, the one in England
should be since it is theoretically pos
sible for more students to get there to
study on their own than it is to other
Western European countries.
Nothing was said at all about greater
or lesser qualities in the academic
and/or social experience.

Mac Donald's merits
In my opinion, the Jan. 12 Daily fea
ture on swimmer Sandy Mac Donald
may have made some unfortunate im
plications. I question references bv as
sistant swim coach Debbie Meyer to
his lack of talent.
Stanford had recruited the top high
school butterflyer in the U.S. in 1973.
1974, 1975 and 1976. Mac Donald at
this point is ahead of most of them.
Is this a lack of talent? That Mac-
Donald is an "animal" (hard worker)
in practice is not to be denied. Nor can
we deny that Stanford's Olympic gold
medalists are animals. Talent and hard

work are not mutually exclusive.
Later in the article Mac Donald was
said to have "lasted only one month"
at West Point.
While this is true, the real reason
that Mac Donald had to leave was not
the implied reason (that he couldn't
hack it) but that his physical impair
ment (mentioned early in the article)
was severely antagonized there and he
was forced to leave.

I'm glad the Daily has editorialized

in favor of a reevaluation of current
theme houses (]an. 18). Were the paper
taking up my invitation to have a rep
resentative attend our meetings, it
would know that the COSS Subcom
mittee on Residences (COSS/R) is
doing precisely that.
Acting Assoc. Dean Norm Robinson
and Row Director Karen Murray are
taking part in this review and can be
expected to listen attentively to the re
commendations of COSS/R.
The committee expects to complete
its review by the end of this month,
and it will, of course, make the results

In my opinion, the Jan. 12 Daily fea
ture on swimmer Sandy Mac Donald
may have made some unfortunate im
plications. I question references bv as
sistant swim coach Debbie Meyer to
his lack of talent.
Stanford had recruited the top high
school butterflyer in the U.S. in 1973.
1974, 1975 and 1976. Mac Donald at
this point is ahead of most of them.
Is this a lack of talent? That Mac-
Donald is an "animal" (hard worker)
in practice is not to be denied. Nor can
we deny that Stanford's Olympic gold
medalists are animals. Talent and hard

work are not mutually exclusive.
Later in the article Mac Donald was
said to have "lasted only one month"
at West Point.
While this is true, the real reason
that Mac Donald had to leave was not
the implied reason (that he couldn't
hack it) but that his physical impair
ment (mentioned early in the article)
was severely antagonized there and he
was forced to leave.

COSS on themes
I'm glad the Daily has editorialized

in favor of a reevaluation of current
theme houses (]an. 18). Were the paper
taking up my invitation to have a rep
resentative attend our meetings, it
would know that the COSS Subcom
mittee on Residences (COSS/R) is
doing precisely that.
Acting Assoc. Dean Norm Robinson
and Row Director Karen Murray are
taking part in this review and can be
expected to listen attentively to the re
commendations of COSS/R.
The committee expects to complete
its review by the end of this month,
and it will, of course, make the results
public.

Morrow in error
Rick Morrow's letter in the Jan. 17
Daily misstates the reasoning of the
Committee on Foreign Study Programs
(C-FSP) in determining that the
studies center at Cliveden has lowest
priority to be continued if the overseas
studies' budget reductions force clos
ing of still another center.
The C-FSP did not determine that
because "we speak the same language
as the British . . . the academic and/or
social experience in England will be of
less educational significance than at
other foreign campuses," as Morrow
states it.
Rather, the C-FSP stated that be
cause there is no real language barrier
between England and the United
States, access to study and travel in
England is greater for Stanford under
graduates than it is for countries where
there is a greater language barrier, and,
therefore, if any center has to be the
next to be closed, the one in England
should be since it is theoretically pos
sible for more students to get there to
study on their own than it is to other
Western European countries.
Nothing was said at all about greater
or lesser qualities in the academic
and/or social experience.
