# Stanford-in-Government offers excitement, experience

"I came to Washington think
ing laws were made during
heated congressional debates. 1
expected to see great orators bar
gaining and negotiating to con
vince the other congressmen of
their policies. 1 guess I was kind
of naive about the way govern
ment works," said Mark Hoffman,
chairman of the Stanford-in-
Government Program.
"But working this summer in
Washington, I formed a much
more realistic idea of what really
goes on," he continued. "1 did
volunteer work for Oregon Con
gressman Jim Weaver, research
ing for congressional legislation,
tracking down federal agencies
to handle constituent problems,
and attending subcommittee
hearings. I learned that laws
aren't made on the floor of the
House or Senate, but in the
committees."
Faye Tiano, who- wrote
speeches and researched legisla
tive analysis for Wisconsin Sen.
William Proxmire, agrees. "1 was
amazed at how large a role staff
members play. It's the profes
sionals on the staff who research
the issues and generally write
out the language of the policy.
Working for the senator this
summer was an incredible eye
opening experience for me."
Stanford-in-Government pro

vides a unique service to stu
dents who want to work as
summer interns for the govern
ment. Nearly 100 students here
took part last year in the prog
ram. Many went to Washington
to work for congressmen,
senators and committees. Some
worked for the state government
in Sacramento. Others were
placed in federal agencies and
special interest groups, or par
ticipated in black placement and
chicano placement programs.
"For anyone interested in
government, the summer intern
ship is a very valuable experi
ence," commented Tiano. "Liv
ing in Washington is so exciting
because everyone there keeps up
with what's going on — even re
staurant conversation is
stimulating."
"There are about 2500 sum
mer interns in Washington, and
we got together at least twice a
week for social events," said
Hoffman. "We listened to speak
ers like Humphrey and Udall.
We took trips to the beach,
learned how to sky-dive and
played softball. The Taiwan em
bassy threw a huge party for us
— great food, mixed drinks —
it's a fantastic way to spend a
summer."
Stanford-in-Government is lo
cated in and supported by the
Bowman Alumni House. A 12-

member "board of directors," all
students, run the office, which is
open Monday through Friday
12-5.
Hoffman calls the office a "col
lection of resources," which
contains all the information a
student needs on how to apply
for a summer internship with the
government.
Available votes
"Early in September we
mailed surveys to senators, con
gressmen, committees, and fed
eral and state programs to ask
what jobs would be available for
next summer," explained
Hoffman. "Now a student can
come in and look up, for exam
ple, Pete McCloskey, and find
out that he hires 10 summer in
terns at $500 per month, of
which three are Stanford stu
dents. It just gives you a realistic
idea of what to expect in apply
ing for an internship."
To apply, the student writes a
personal resume and a cover let
ter, which is a personal letter to
the senator or agency saying that
he's applying for the summer in
ternship and giving other details
which could help him get the
job, for example, if he's a con
stituent of the senator's state.
The Stanford-in-Government
office also wants a writing sam
ple of one to five pages to show
that the student can write a cohe
rent essay, and finally, a list of
the internships applied for in
order of preference.
"Next, we hold a personal in
terview with the applicant to
bring out more personal infor
mation which could help him
get the job," said Hoffman. "In
February, five members of the
board of directors go to
Washington and one to Atlanta
to lobby for our applicants. This
gives our program personal con
tact with the offices at least once
a year, and gives our applicants a
little boost in the selection pro
cess, since Stanford students
can't just take the train down to
Washington for a personal inter
view as Harvard students can.
On the spot
"On rare occasions, the office
hires someone on the spot, but
usually it just gives our candi

date a few more words over
someone else. We give the office
the information gathered from
the personal interview, along
with the writing sample if they
ask for it.
"When they return, the lob
byists send out a form letter to
the applicants, saying things
like, 'John Jones, you're still in
the running.' This tells students
the status of their applications,"
said Hoffman.
Due date for applications is
tomorrow so that the
student can have his interview
before the lobbyists leave. "If
you don't get your application in
by this Friday, you can still
apply for an internship,"
explained Hoffman. "You just
won't be able to take advantage
of the lobbyists. There's still a lot
of time to apply for state jobs in
Sacramento and to federal agen
cies.
"I'dalso liketoemphasizethat
a.student doesn't have to be a
poli-sci major or considering
law school to apply. In fact, most
offices want diversity in their
summer interns — an econ or
English major has just as good a
chance as anyone else to be
hired."
Housing situation
Housing is an individual mat
ter for students who are accepted
in the program. "I lived on 14th
and Rhode Island, which isn't
the best part of Washington,
D.C.," said Janice Cohn, who did
research and legislative analysis
for New Mexico Sen. Pete
Domenici. "There were some
shady characters in my apart
ment building. I made my
roommate go to the store with
me. But there were a lot of other
Stanford kids in the complex. It
was like a big dorm."
Many students did live in col
lege dorms, which can be pre
arranged before going to
Washington. "But that's kind of
expensive," said Tiano. "I lived
with two friends in a townhouse
eight blocks from Capitol Hill,
which was ideal. You can really
luck out if you go a couple of
days early and look around."
"I house-sat for people and
didn't have to pay anything to

stay in Washington," said
Hoffman, "which was really nice
because I just had a volunteer
job.
"About half the jobs are paid
and half are volunteer," he con
tinued." The jobs are part clerical
and part interesting work like re
search, but it usually works out
that the volunteer work is more
interesting."
Financial aid
The university has a financial
aid program so that students
who have to earn money during
the summer can still participate
in the program. "We have an
operating budget of $20,000, of
which 85 per cent is used for fi
nancial aid. Usually a student
with a financial aid package here
at school can qualify," explained

Hottman. "The only require
ment is a Parent's Confidential
Statement on file at Stanford.
"The amount of money your
job pays you, if any, is deducted
from the figure that Stanford
feels you need to make for the
summer, and our program makes
up the difference. But I wouldn't
count on getting rich on an in
ternship program," he warned.
"Usually the money doesn't
cover too much more than living
expenses."
Valuable experience
Some students find that get
ting to know their employer is
one of the most valuable experi
ences of the program.
"I knew Sen. Proxmire in an
advisory position when I was
working on bills for him, and we

went out to lunch a couple of
times. He's really a unique
character," related Tiano. "He
jogs a lot anil he recently had a
hair transplant — he used to joke
me about my long hair."
"1 think it's a lot easier to get to
know your boss if you work for a
congressman," said Hoffman. "1
had some really good talks with
Congressman Weaver this sum
mer when I came to use the free
phone lines at night and he'd
still be working in his office. I
dashed him out to the airport
once at about 80 mph."
Cohn, Tiano, and Hoffman are
very enthusiastic about their ex
periences as interns. Hoffman is
already planning his next sum
mer in Washington.
"I came to Washington think
ing laws were made during
heated congressional debates. 1
expected to see great orators bar

poli-sci major or considering

offices want diversity in their
summer interns — an econ or
English major has just as good a
chance as anyone else to be
hired."
Housing situation
Housing is an individual mat
ter for students who are accepted
in the program. "I lived on 14th
and Rhode Island, which isn't
the best part of Washington,
D.C.," said Janice Cohn, who did
research and legislative analysis
for New Mexico Sen. Pete
Domenici. "There were some
shady characters in my apart
ment building. I made my
roommate go to the store with
me. But there were a lot of other
Stanford kids in the complex. It
was like a big dorm."
Many students did live in col
lege dorms, which can be pre
arranged before going to
Washington. "But that's kind of
expensive," said Tiano. "I lived
with two friends in a townhouse
eight blocks from Capitol Hill,
which was ideal. You can really
luck out if you go a couple of
days early and look around."
"I house-sat for people and
didn't have to pay anything to

stay in Washington," said
Hoffman, "which was really nice
because I just had a volunteer
job.
"About half the jobs are paid
and half are volunteer," he con
tinued." The jobs are part clerical
and part interesting work like re
search, but it usually works out
that the volunteer work is more
interesting."
Financial aid
The university has a financial
aid program so that students
who have to earn money during
the summer can still participate
in the program. "We have an
operating budget of $20,000, of
which 85 per cent is used for fi
nancial aid. Usually a student
with a financial aid package here
at school can qualify," explained

Hottman. "The only require
ment is a Parent's Confidential
Statement on file at Stanford.
"The amount of money your
job pays you, if any, is deducted
from the figure that Stanford
feels you need to make for the
summer, and our program makes
up the difference. But I wouldn't
count on getting rich on an in
ternship program," he warned.
"Usually the money doesn't
cover too much more than living
expenses."
Valuable experience
Some students find that get
ting to know their employer is
one of the most valuable experi
ences of the program.
"I knew Sen. Proxmire in an
advisory position when I was
working on bills for him, and we

went out to lunch a couple of
times. He's really a unique
character," related Tiano. "He
jogs a lot anil he recently had a
hair transplant — he used to joke
me about my long hair."
"1 think it's a lot easier to get to
know your boss if you work for a
congressman," said Hoffman. "1
had some really good talks with
Congressman Weaver this sum
mer when I came to use the free
phone lines at night and he'd
still be working in his office. I
dashed him out to the airport
once at about 80 mph."
Cohn, Tiano, and Hoffman are
very enthusiastic about their ex
periences as interns. Hoffman is
already planning his next sum
mer in Washington.
"I came to Washington think
ing laws were made during
heated congressional debates. 1
expected to see great orators bar
gaining and negotiating to con
vince the other congressmen of
their policies. 1 guess I was kind
of naive about the way govern
ment works," said Mark Hoffman,
chairman of the Stanford-in-
Government Program.
"But working this summer in
Washington, I formed a much
more realistic idea of what really
goes on," he continued. "1 did
volunteer work for Oregon Con
gressman Jim Weaver, research
ing for congressional legislation,
tracking down federal agencies
to handle constituent problems,
and attending subcommittee
hearings. I learned that laws
aren't made on the floor of the
House or Senate, but in the
committees."
Faye Tiano, who- wrote
speeches and researched legisla
tive analysis for Wisconsin Sen.
William Proxmire, agrees. "1 was
amazed at how large a role staff
members play. It's the profes
sionals on the staff who research
the issues and generally write
out the language of the policy.
Working for the senator this
summer was an incredible eye
opening experience for me."
Stanford-in-Government pro

vides a unique service to stu
dents who want to work as
summer interns for the govern
ment. Nearly 100 students here
took part last year in the prog
ram. Many went to Washington
to work for congressmen,
senators and committees. Some
worked for the state government
in Sacramento. Others were
placed in federal agencies and
special interest groups, or par
ticipated in black placement and
chicano placement programs.
"For anyone interested in
government, the summer intern
ship is a very valuable experi
ence," commented Tiano. "Liv
ing in Washington is so exciting
because everyone there keeps up
with what's going on — even re
staurant conversation is
stimulating."
"There are about 2500 sum
mer interns in Washington, and
we got together at least twice a
week for social events," said
Hoffman. "We listened to speak
ers like Humphrey and Udall.
We took trips to the beach,
learned how to sky-dive and
played softball. The Taiwan em
bassy threw a huge party for us
— great food, mixed drinks —
it's a fantastic way to spend a
summer."
Stanford-in-Government is lo
cated in and supported by the
Bowman Alumni House. A 12-

member "board of directors," all
students, run the office, which is
open Monday through Friday
12-5.
Hoffman calls the office a "col
lection of resources," which
contains all the information a
student needs on how to apply
for a summer internship with the
government.
Available votes
"Early in September we
mailed surveys to senators, con
gressmen, committees, and fed
eral and state programs to ask
what jobs would be available for
next summer," explained
Hoffman. "Now a student can
come in and look up, for exam
ple, Pete McCloskey, and find
out that he hires 10 summer in
terns at $500 per month, of
which three are Stanford stu
dents. It just gives you a realistic
idea of what to expect in apply
ing for an internship."
To apply, the student writes a
personal resume and a cover let
ter, which is a personal letter to
the senator or agency saying that
he's applying for the summer in
ternship and giving other details
which could help him get the
job, for example, if he's a con
stituent of the senator's state.
The Stanford-in-Government
office also wants a writing sam
ple of one to five pages to show
that the student can write a cohe
rent essay, and finally, a list of
the internships applied for in
order of preference.
"Next, we hold a personal in
terview with the applicant to
bring out more personal infor
mation which could help him
get the job," said Hoffman. "In
February, five members of the
board of directors go to
Washington and one to Atlanta
to lobby for our applicants. This
gives our program personal con
tact with the offices at least once
a year, and gives our applicants a
little boost in the selection pro
cess, since Stanford students
can't just take the train down to
Washington for a personal inter
view as Harvard students can.
On the spot
"On rare occasions, the office
hires someone on the spot, but
usually it just gives our candi

date a few more words over
someone else. We give the office
the information gathered from
the personal interview, along
with the writing sample if they
ask for it.
"When they return, the lob
byists send out a form letter to
the applicants, saying things
like, 'John Jones, you're still in
the running.' This tells students
the status of their applications,"
said Hoffman.
Due date for applications is
tomorrow so that the
student can have his interview
before the lobbyists leave. "If
you don't get your application in
by this Friday, you can still
apply for an internship,"
explained Hoffman. "You just
won't be able to take advantage
of the lobbyists. There's still a lot
of time to apply for state jobs in
Sacramento and to federal agen
cies.
"I'dalso liketoemphasizethat
a.student doesn't have to be a
poli-sci major or considering
law school to apply. In fact, most
offices want diversity in their
summer interns — an econ or
English major has just as good a

hired."

We took trips to the beach,
learned how to sky-dive and
played softball. The Taiwan em
bassy threw a huge party for us
— great food, mixed drinks —
it's a fantastic way to spend a
summer."
Stanford-in-Government is lo
cated in and supported by the
Bowman Alumni House. A 12-

member "board of directors," all
students, run the office, which is
open Monday through Friday
12-5.
Hoffman calls the office a "col
lection of resources," which
contains all the information a
student needs on how to apply
for a summer internship with the
government.

"Early in September we
mailed surveys to senators, con
gressmen, committees, and fed
eral and state programs to ask
what jobs would be available for
next summer," explained
Hoffman. "Now a student can
come in and look up, for exam
ple, Pete McCloskey, and find
out that he hires 10 summer in
terns at $500 per month, of
which three are Stanford stu
dents. It just gives you a realistic
idea of what to expect in apply
ing for an internship."
To apply, the student writes a
personal resume and a cover let
ter, which is a personal letter to
the senator or agency saying that
he's applying for the summer in
ternship and giving other details
which could help him get the
job, for example, if he's a con
stituent of the senator's state.
The Stanford-in-Government
office also wants a writing sam
ple of one to five pages to show
that the student can write a cohe
rent essay, and finally, a list of
the internships applied for in
order of preference.
"Next, we hold a personal in
terview with the applicant to
bring out more personal infor
mation which could help him
get the job," said Hoffman. "In
February, five members of the
board of directors go to
Washington and one to Atlanta
to lobby for our applicants. This
gives our program personal con
tact with the offices at least once
a year, and gives our applicants a
little boost in the selection pro
cess, since Stanford students
can't just take the train down to
Washington for a personal inter
view as Harvard students can.
On the spot
"On rare occasions, the office
hires someone on the spot, but
usually it just gives our candi

date a few more words over
someone else. We give the office
the information gathered from
the personal interview, along
with the writing sample if they
ask for it.
"When they return, the lob
byists send out a form letter to
the applicants, saying things
like, 'John Jones, you're still in
the running.' This tells students
the status of their applications,"
said Hoffman.
Due date for applications is
tomorrow so that the
student can have his interview
before the lobbyists leave. "If
you don't get your application in
by this Friday, you can still
apply for an internship,"
explained Hoffman. "You just
won't be able to take advantage
of the lobbyists. There's still a lot
of time to apply for state jobs in
Sacramento and to federal agen
cies.
"I'dalso liketoemphasizethat
a.student doesn't have to be a
poli-sci major or considering
law school to apply. In fact, most
offices want diversity in their
summer interns — an econ or
English major has just as good a
chance as anyone else to be
hired."
Housing situation
Housing is an individual mat
ter for students who are accepted
in the program. "I lived on 14th
and Rhode Island, which isn't
the best part of Washington,
D.C.," said Janice Cohn, who did
research and legislative analysis
for New Mexico Sen. Pete
Domenici. "There were some
shady characters in my apart
ment building. I made my
roommate go to the store with
me. But there were a lot of other
Stanford kids in the complex. It
was like a big dorm."
Many students did live in col
lege dorms, which can be pre
arranged before going to
Washington. "But that's kind of
expensive," said Tiano. "I lived
with two friends in a townhouse
eight blocks from Capitol Hill,
which was ideal. You can really
luck out if you go a couple of
days early and look around."
"I house-sat for people and
didn't have to pay anything to

stay in Washington," said
Hoffman, "which was really nice
because I just had a volunteer
job.
"About half the jobs are paid
and half are volunteer," he con
tinued." The jobs are part clerical
and part interesting work like re
search, but it usually works out
that the volunteer work is more
interesting."
Financial aid
The university has a financial
aid program so that students
who have to earn money during
the summer can still participate
in the program. "We have an
operating budget of $20,000, of
which 85 per cent is used for fi
nancial aid. Usually a student
with a financial aid package here
at school can qualify," explained

Hottman. "The only require
ment is a Parent's Confidential
Statement on file at Stanford.
"The amount of money your
job pays you, if any, is deducted
from the figure that Stanford
feels you need to make for the
summer, and our program makes
up the difference. But I wouldn't
count on getting rich on an in
ternship program," he warned.
"Usually the money doesn't
cover too much more than living
expenses."
Valuable experience
Some students find that get
ting to know their employer is
one of the most valuable experi
ences of the program.
"I knew Sen. Proxmire in an
advisory position when I was
working on bills for him, and we

went out to lunch a couple of
times. He's really a unique
character," related Tiano. "He
jogs a lot anil he recently had a
hair transplant — he used to joke
me about my long hair."
"1 think it's a lot easier to get to
know your boss if you work for a
congressman," said Hoffman. "1
had some really good talks with
Congressman Weaver this sum
mer when I came to use the free
phone lines at night and he'd
still be working in his office. I
dashed him out to the airport
once at about 80 mph."
Cohn, Tiano, and Hoffman are
very enthusiastic about their ex
periences as interns. Hoffman is
already planning his next sum
mer in Washington.
"I came to Washington think
ing laws were made during
heated congressional debates. 1
expected to see great orators bar
gaining and negotiating to con
vince the other congressmen of
their policies. 1 guess I was kind
of naive about the way govern
ment works," said Mark Hoffman,
chairman of the Stanford-in-
Government Program.
"But working this summer in
Washington, I formed a much
more realistic idea of what really
goes on," he continued. "1 did
volunteer work for Oregon Con
gressman Jim Weaver, research
ing for congressional legislation,
tracking down federal agencies
to handle constituent problems,
and attending subcommittee
hearings. I learned that laws
aren't made on the floor of the
House or Senate, but in the
committees."
Faye Tiano, who- wrote
speeches and researched legisla
tive analysis for Wisconsin Sen.
William Proxmire, agrees. "1 was
amazed at how large a role staff
members play. It's the profes
sionals on the staff who research
the issues and generally write
out the language of the policy.
Working for the senator this
summer was an incredible eye
opening experience for me."
Stanford-in-Government pro

vides a unique service to stu
dents who want to work as
summer interns for the govern
ment. Nearly 100 students here
took part last year in the prog
ram. Many went to Washington
to work for congressmen,
senators and committees. Some
worked for the state government
in Sacramento. Others were
placed in federal agencies and
special interest groups, or par
ticipated in black placement and
chicano placement programs.
"For anyone interested in
government, the summer intern
ship is a very valuable experi
ence," commented Tiano. "Liv
ing in Washington is so exciting
because everyone there keeps up
with what's going on — even re
staurant conversation is
stimulating."
"There are about 2500 sum
mer interns in Washington, and
we got together at least twice a
week for social events," said
Hoffman. "We listened to speak
ers like Humphrey and Udall.
We took trips to the beach,
learned how to sky-dive and
played softball. The Taiwan em
bassy threw a huge party for us
— great food, mixed drinks —
it's a fantastic way to spend a

up the difference. But I wouldn't
count on getting rich on an in
ternship program," he warned.
"Usually the money doesn't
cover too much more than living
expenses."
Valuable experience
Some students find that get
ting to know their employer is
one of the most valuable experi
ences of the program.
"I knew Sen. Proxmire in an
advisory position when I was
working on bills for him, and we

went out to lunch a couple of
times. He's really a unique
character," related Tiano. "He
jogs a lot anil he recently had a
hair transplant — he used to joke
me about my long hair."
"1 think it's a lot easier to get to
know your boss if you work for a
congressman," said Hoffman. "1
had some really good talks with
Congressman Weaver this sum
mer when I came to use the free
phone lines at night and he'd
still be working in his office. I
dashed him out to the airport
once at about 80 mph."
Cohn, Tiano, and Hoffman are
very enthusiastic about their ex
periences as interns. Hoffman is
already planning his next sum
mer in Washington.
"I came to Washington think
ing laws were made during
heated congressional debates. 1
expected to see great orators bar
gaining and negotiating to con
vince the other congressmen of
their policies. 1 guess I was kind
of naive about the way govern
ment works," said Mark Hoffman,
chairman of the Stanford-in-
Government Program.
"But working this summer in
Washington, I formed a much
more realistic idea of what really
goes on," he continued. "1 did
volunteer work for Oregon Con
gressman Jim Weaver, research
ing for congressional legislation,
tracking down federal agencies
to handle constituent problems,
and attending subcommittee
hearings. I learned that laws
aren't made on the floor of the
House or Senate, but in the
committees."
Faye Tiano, who- wrote
speeches and researched legisla
tive analysis for Wisconsin Sen.
William Proxmire, agrees. "1 was
amazed at how large a role staff
members play. It's the profes
sionals on the staff who research
the issues and generally write
out the language of the policy.
Working for the senator this
summer was an incredible eye
opening experience for me."
Stanford-in-Government pro

vides a unique service to stu
dents who want to work as
summer interns for the govern
ment. Nearly 100 students here
took part last year in the prog
ram. Many went to Washington
to work for congressmen,
senators and committees. Some
worked for the state government
in Sacramento. Others were
placed in federal agencies and
special interest groups, or par
ticipated in black placement and
chicano placement programs.
"For anyone interested in
government, the summer intern
ship is a very valuable experi
ence," commented Tiano. "Liv
ing in Washington is so exciting
because everyone there keeps up
with what's going on — even re
staurant conversation is
stimulating."
"There are about 2500 sum
mer interns in Washington, and
we got together at least twice a
week for social events," said
Hoffman. "We listened to speak
ers like Humphrey and Udall.
We took trips to the beach,
learned how to sky-dive and
played softball. The Taiwan em
bassy threw a huge party for us
— great food, mixed drinks —
it's a fantastic way to spend a
summer."
Stanford-in-Government is lo
cated in and supported by the
Bowman Alumni House. A 12-

member "board of directors," all
students, run the office, which is
open Monday through Friday
12-5.
Hoffman calls the office a "col
lection of resources," which
contains all the information a
student needs on how to apply
for a summer internship with the
government.
Available votes
"Early in September we
mailed surveys to senators, con
gressmen, committees, and fed
eral and state programs to ask
what jobs would be available for
next summer," explained
Hoffman. "Now a student can
come in and look up, for exam
ple, Pete McCloskey, and find
out that he hires 10 summer in
terns at $500 per month, of
which three are Stanford stu
dents. It just gives you a realistic
idea of what to expect in apply
ing for an internship."
To apply, the student writes a
personal resume and a cover let
ter, which is a personal letter to
the senator or agency saying that
he's applying for the summer in
ternship and giving other details
which could help him get the
job, for example, if he's a con
stituent of the senator's state.
The Stanford-in-Government
office also wants a writing sam
ple of one to five pages to show
that the student can write a cohe
rent essay, and finally, a list of
the internships applied for in
order of preference.
"Next, we hold a personal in
terview with the applicant to
bring out more personal infor
mation which could help him
get the job," said Hoffman. "In
February, five members of the
board of directors go to
Washington and one to Atlanta
to lobby for our applicants. This
gives our program personal con
tact with the offices at least once
a year, and gives our applicants a
little boost in the selection pro
cess, since Stanford students
can't just take the train down to
Washington for a personal inter
view as Harvard students can.
On the spot
"On rare occasions, the office
hires someone on the spot, but
usually it just gives our candi

date a few more words over
someone else. We give the office
the information gathered from
the personal interview, along
with the writing sample if they
ask for it.
"When they return, the lob
byists send out a form letter to
the applicants, saying things
like, 'John Jones, you're still in
the running.' This tells students
the status of their applications,"
said Hoffman.
Due date for applications is
tomorrow so that the
student can have his interview
before the lobbyists leave. "If
you don't get your application in
by this Friday, you can still
apply for an internship,"
explained Hoffman. "You just
won't be able to take advantage
of the lobbyists. There's still a lot
of time to apply for state jobs in
Sacramento and to federal agen
cies.
"I'dalso liketoemphasizethat
a.student doesn't have to be a
poli-sci major or considering
law school to apply. In fact, most
offices want diversity in their
summer interns — an econ or
English major has just as good a
chance as anyone else to be
hired."
Housing situation
Housing is an individual mat
ter for students who are accepted
in the program. "I lived on 14th
and Rhode Island, which isn't
the best part of Washington,
D.C.," said Janice Cohn, who did
research and legislative analysis
for New Mexico Sen. Pete
Domenici. "There were some
shady characters in my apart
ment building. I made my
roommate go to the store with
me. But there were a lot of other
Stanford kids in the complex. It
was like a big dorm."
Many students did live in col
lege dorms, which can be pre
arranged before going to
Washington. "But that's kind of
expensive," said Tiano. "I lived
with two friends in a townhouse
eight blocks from Capitol Hill,
which was ideal. You can really
luck out if you go a couple of
days early and look around."
"I house-sat for people and
didn't have to pay anything to

stay in Washington," said
Hoffman, "which was really nice
because I just had a volunteer
job.
"About half the jobs are paid
and half are volunteer," he con
tinued." The jobs are part clerical
and part interesting work like re
search, but it usually works out
that the volunteer work is more
interesting."
Financial aid
The university has a financial
aid program so that students
who have to earn money during
the summer can still participate
in the program. "We have an
operating budget of $20,000, of
which 85 per cent is used for fi
nancial aid. Usually a student
with a financial aid package here
at school can qualify," explained

Hottman. "The only require
ment is a Parent's Confidential
Statement on file at Stanford.
"The amount of money your
job pays you, if any, is deducted
from the figure that Stanford
feels you need to make for the
summer, and our program makes
up the difference. But I wouldn't
count on getting rich on an in
ternship program," he warned.
"Usually the money doesn't
cover too much more than living
expenses."
