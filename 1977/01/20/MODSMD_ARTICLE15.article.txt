# Digestible milk?

### 
Cambridge, Mass. (AP) â€” Most of the world's adults cannot
digest milk, but they may someday be able to derive nutrition from
the liquid food with the help of a chemical additive being ested
here. If successful, the tests could help provide a new source of
protein for the earth's underfed millions, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology scientists say.
So far, the scientists say they have gotten good results from trying
out the chemical, calling lactasen on animals. Within a few
months, they say, large-scale testing may begin on humans. Lactase
is necessary to break down the sugar in milk so it can be used by the
body.
Infants produce'it naturally in their intestines, but as people
grow older, they often losetheir ability to makeit. When people fail
to make the chemical, they do not get milk's nutrition and suffer
upset stomachs if they drink it.
Paul Newborne, who is directing the tests, said samples have
indicated that as many as two out of three blacks in the United
States cannot tolerate milk in the quantities usually drunk by
whites.
