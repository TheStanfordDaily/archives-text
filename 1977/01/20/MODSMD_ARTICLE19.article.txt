# Troubleshooter makes a hit

### Kathy Ellison 
Ombudsman John Goheen
can be found toiling away most
weekdays in his tiny, two-room
office, tucked into the northwest
corner of the Quad.
His unobtrusive sign on the
inside of the Geology Depart
ment's door wouldn't cause
most students to look twice,
much less to run up to the build
ing's second floor where, as it
informs them, he can be found.
Nevertheless, Goheen has
heard complaints from at least
145 students during the fall
quarter of 1976.
Born in Washington in 1906,
Goheen, now an emeritus pro
fessor of philosophy, seems to
have easily developed into a
natural "type" for his job. He has
the rare skill of putting a trou
bled stranger at ease with his
sympathetic and informal man

ner.
Yet Goheen's faultless clothes
and perfectly combed white
hair belie the informality of his
manner, and it is the latter evi
dence of meticulousness which
characterizes his working style.
He can be extraordinarily effi
cient and he is famous with un
dergraduates for resolving par
ticularly sticky problems within
days.
Acts as mediator
In his capacity as om
budsman, Goheen mediates be
tween disgruntled teachers, stu
dents, administrators and
bureaucrats. He also "reminds"
the school of its problem areas in
obligatory annual reports pub
lished in Campus Report.
The post of ombudsman
originated in Sweden early in
the 19th century, answering a
governmental need for a legisla

tive commissioner for the inves
tigation of citizens' complaints
of bureaucratic abuse.
By now many American uni
versities besides Stanford have
instituted this office as an inde
pendent, effective check on their
own bureaucracies.
The ombudsman is appointed
each year by the university pres
ident, acting on the recommen
dation of a student-faculty
committee. As the students have
great input into Goheen's reten
tion of his post, he cannot be
fired unless he becomes un
popular. Thus he enjoys unusual
independence.
Independence essential
Independence is essential to
his post, and it seems also to be
the essence of his style. A former
ombudsman chose the remote
location of the office, a location
Goheen now favors as he feels it

is "symbolic" of his perspective
as one outside the mainstream of
academic and institutional ac
tivity.
His professional alliances are
limited to his secretary, Sara
Stephenson, and his student
aides, Marsha Wilkes, Francis
Wong and Barry Bakin. The om
budsman feels it part of his job to
personally inform university
President Richard Lyman, yet
actually Goheen is an adviser to
all; he champions every cause he
feels is just.
The problems Goheen deals
with mostly these days relate to
undergraduate dissatisfaction
with grades and the quality of
instruction.
Poor teaching
"Students are very aware of
poor teaching new," he says.
"Higher levels of competition
make them sensitive to where
they see failures."
Goheen is currently working
on the case, quite typical of the
times, of a junior in mechanical
engineering (who wishes to re
main anonymous in this article
due to the nature of his problem)
who complains he was given a
B-plus in one class instead of the
A-minus he feels he deserves.
"Goheen," said the student,
"told me the proper channels to
go through, and arranged a meet
ing with the department head."
Goheen's lack of non-advisory
power limits him in this type of
situation, but the student still
felt, "He was very nice about it."
In the junior's case, Goheen
can speak to department heads,
call the teacher personally and
mediate between the parties in
volved, yet he cannot, by him
self, do more than recommend a
course of action.
Grade complaints
Complaints about grading are
some of the most common Go

heen is faced with, and his li
mited power frustrates him
sometimes, he says.
"The main difficulty," he
says, "arises from the sense that
it is a general law that the in
structor has the final word.
There is a real problem in the
response of instructors to under
graduates."
Still Goheen feels he is effec
tive in "reflecting problems into
the areas from which they arise."
His continued teaching in the
Structured Liberal Education
(SLE) program keeps him, he be
lieves, "in relation with stu
dents," and he asserts that. "Ev
ery ombudsman ought to be in
volved in teaching."
Bureaucratic bungles
Although his hands are
somewhat tied in the most pre
valent problem area of academic

complaints, Goheen helps stu
dents almost every day to resolve
problems with bureaucracies on
campus, such as the library and
housing systems and the food
service.
Goheen has recently aided a
Donner freshman, Jane Angeles,
to become an eating associate at
Columbae House, where, she
says, she spends most of her time
anyway.
At first, she says, "1 used him
as an explainer. 1 wanted to
change housing but it is a gen
eral rule that freshpeople cannot
change where they live."
In a short time, Goheen helped
Angeles to reach the eating as
sociate compromise, leaving her
to feel, "He was one member of
the bureaucracy who was really
receptive to my needs."
Goheen's other activities

range from submitting recom
mendations to Lyman
concerning the Honor Code, to
advising the food service to be
more responsive to vegetarians,
to encouraging better supervi
sion of teaching assistants and
the abolition of the grading
"curve," to investigating expen
sive parking fees and fines.
In general, Goheen strives to
promote what he feels is the
most important need of the uni
versity: "responsiveness to stu
dent needs," he says.
His success in this goal might
be measured by reading his
Campus Heport summaries, as
they list the many and varied
problems to which he responds.
Yet Goheen's belief in his job, as
well as the natural sympathy he
brings to it, is clearly evident in
the testimony of each student he
has personally helped.


Ombudsman

housing problems. His office, located in the Geology building, is open for any student who
needs advice for unanswerable questions or unsolvable problems.
