# Heating costs rise with oil use

In response to energy demands resulting from the
nationwide cold snap. Pacific Gas and Electric (FCifirE) has
cut off the university's supply of natural gas, thus forcing
the university to use fuel oil which adds approximately
$2000 a day to heating costs, according to Central Plant
Superintendent Warren Weeks.
Natural gas service was interrupted at 8 a.m. Jan. 9.
Weeks said, to meet higher priority demands elsewhere.
Weeks indicated that because of the recent cold weather
and the added square footage of new university buildings,
the university has been consuming approximately 30,000
to 35,000 gallons of fuel oil a day.

"Fuel oil costs 34.8 cents per gallon," Weeks said. He
added that handling, delivery and storage costs raise the
university's bill even higher.
Weeks indicated that in the first eight days on fuel oil,
the university spent approximately $75,000 on the oil. He
said this figure compares with $59,000 to get the same
amount of heat with natural gas at current prices.
Weeks said that the university has a 300,000 gallon fuel
oil storage capacity, which translates roughly to a 10-day
supply.
Weeks did not know when PG&E would restore natural
gas service. He indicated that transferring back to natural
gas would not pose a big problem.
"We can switch over pretty quickly," he said.
