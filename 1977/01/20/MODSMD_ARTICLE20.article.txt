# U.S. caught unprepared

Thousands of Americans were caught
without pants — the long, thermal variety — by
this century's most frigid weather, and business
in longjohns is booming even where chilly legs
are rare.
"Everybody's got a coat or a jacket," said Tom
Latham, a merchandise manager for J.C. Penney in
Columbia, S.C. "But long underwear's a basic
item that a lot of people don't have. Our long
underwear sales are up 35 to 40 per cent over last
year."
"To say the least, sales in longjohns have been
brisk," said Dick Nokes, Sears' merchandise man
ager in Durham, N.C. "People are standing in line
for them. Sometimes I think I'm the East Coast
distributor."
Folks living in the warmer climes weren't the
only ones caught cold by the arctic-like weather.
Sales took off, too, in areas where people should
know better.
"I wouldn't know where .to start to tell you
about all the stuff we sold," said the manager of a

discount store in Marietta, Ohio. "We've sold a
third more of all type of winter items this year
than in previous years."
The demand for winter clothing at J.L. Hudson
Co., Detroit's biggest department store, "has been
fantastic, our best year ever for outer wear, run
ning about 20 per cent ahead of the old record," a
spokesman said.
Colman's, a sporting goods store in Canton,
Mass., near the Blue Hill ski run, said sales of
down-filled underwear and socks have been 20
per cent higher than normal.
"The whole down market is up," quipped Win
Brown, the store's manager.
The hot underwear market is only one phase of
the late-blooming winter sales rush. Consider:
—Snow chains in Arkansas. One Little Rock
dealer sold 400 sets in three days.
—Potbellied stoves in Ohio. A store in Maumee,
near Toledo, sold 100 in the weeks after
Thanksgiving.
Alas, word from California: No run there on
sleds, ear muffs, thermal underwear and the like.
