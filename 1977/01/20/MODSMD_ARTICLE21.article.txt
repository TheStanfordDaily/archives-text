# Radical hooker speaks out
## 
### Frances Draper 
Mother, student, civil rights
worker and hooker Randa
Newby will offer her insights
into the working life of a prosti
tute in her lecture tonight at 8 in
theTresidder Large Lounge. She
is a member of San Francisco
based radical hookers group Call
Off Your Old Tired Ethics
(COYOTE).
In her lecture tonight, Newby
said she plans to discuss "how
this radical group of hookers
ever got started and how their
attitudes have changed since the
'605." She also plans to dis
cuss her personal feelings about
herself, her work, her mother
hood and her clients.
COYOTE was started on
Mother's Day 1973 by Margo St.
James, a former hooker. The idea
was born out of her anger at har
rassments she claimed to have
suffered at the hands of the San
Francisco vice squad. She felt it
was time for hookers to start de
fending themselves.
COYOTE's main goal is to ob
tain the decriminalization,
rather than the legalization of
prostitution. In a recent inter
view with COYOTE's Associate
Director Judy Edwards, she
clarified the distinction.
According to Edwards, legali
zation is simply another form of
male domination which would
allow men to dictate the amount
of freedom prostitutes would be
allowed to have. She said de
criminalization would leave
prostitutes free to govern their
own lives.
Some regulations
According to Newby,
COYOTE recognizes that some
regulation of hookers is neces
sary to obtain the decriminaliza
tion of prostitution.
She added that in the ev6nt of
decriminalization, COYOTE
would request the formation of a
panel composed of hookers,
along with regular policy
forming officials, to determine
appropriate regulations. By this
method, hookers could have
their say and the regulations
formed would be the result of a
compromise.
Newby said that COYOTE
members would be willing to
pay taxes, carry health cards (to
show training in health care) and
follow other regulations estab

lished by the people. How pay
ment of taxes would be enforced
if prostitution were to be de
criminalized is unclear.
The three types of regulation
which the members of COYOTE
are particularly concerned with
avoiding are; zoning (creation of
"red light" areas), restricted
work hours and specification of
who may and may not work as a
hooker.
Main function
COYOTE's main functions are
supplying information on legal
counsel and medical services to
hookers. Edwards added that,
"COYOTE also gets visits from
women who say they're in
terested in getting into the busi
ness and want to learn the
ropes." For them COYOTE has
stacks of articles and psycholog
ical studies on hookers to give a
"true" idea of vhat the business
is really like, and how tough it
may be.
Women looking for help in
getting out of prostitution can
also find it at COYOTE.
Edwards said that "one of the
big changes since the '60s has
been in the attitude of the Wo
men's Lib movement towards
hookers. Originally the wo
men's movement would not ac
cept hookers as members be
cause they were thought to be
the epitome of all sex objects."
Hookers, however, are now
often seen as liberated women
who have complete control over
what to do with their own lives.
Their own self-image has be
come fairly positive and inde
pendent. Those involved with
COYOTE are working to destroy
some of the traditional concep
tions (or misconceptions) of
prostitution.
Newby says she's been an ac
tive member of COYOTE for
three years. She is a 32-year-old
graduate student of psychology

at San Francisco State Univer
sity and the mother of a 12-
year-old daughter.
Vice raid
Newby sa'd she was "arrested
in May 1975, in the famous
Bush Street Raid in San Fran
cisco, in which 20 vice squad of
ficers spent four hours in bed
and drinking in a bordello. They
then proceeded to arrest eight
women, allowing all the male
customers to go."
When asked what she thinks
COYOTE's main concern is,
Newby replied, "COYOTE
wants the public to understand
that prostitution is the symptom
of society's inability to com
municate on a sexual level. It is
counterproductive to attack the
symptom (by putting prostitutes
in jail) rather than to identify and
treat the cause."
Newby said. "Prostitution is
not linked to crimes any more
than other professions. There is
always a certain percentage of
unethical people in every pro
fession, whether it be doctors,
bankers, lawyers, cops or prosti
tutes."
