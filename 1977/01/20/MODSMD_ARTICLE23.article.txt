# Annual report child's play

### 
Hampton, N.H. (AP) — A cure
for financial gobbledygook? It's
child's play as far as one com
pany is concerned.
The firm issues annual reports
in first grade reader style with
cartoon characters.
"The Big Pie," is the latest re
port from Wheelabrater-Frye
Inc., showing a chef cutting up a
financial pie to illustrate the
firm's income, expenses and sav
ings in simple terms.
Each report also contains a
basic lesson in economics.
"Imagine that all the money
people receive from their jobs is
represented by a big pie," says
the text. "We can cut the pie into
smaller pieces — as everyone
shares, but they all get a smaller
piece. Or else, we can make more
jobs by making the pie bigger —
so everyone — including those
who aren't working — can get a
good piece."
One of the characters is the
smiling seagull who is used to
illustrate how new plants create
new jobs. He is standing on a

garbage dump on which
Wheelabrator-Frye built a new
plant.
"Only the seagulls were
happy about the garbage dump
because they sometimes got
their dinner from it,"the story
says.
The kiddie reports, distri
buted to 50,000 shareholders as a
supplement to the company's
regular financial report required
by law, have found their way
into scores of schools. The firm
says it has been flooded with re
quests for the reports to be used
in teaching.
"Dear Big Pie," one 8-year-old
girl wrote to the company, "1
think young children can learn
from it."
Wheelabrator-Frye employs
more than 9000 workers at
plants across the United States.
The firm's products include air
pollution control equipment and
energy systems. It reported earn
ings of $11 million on sales of
$332 million in 1976.
Paul Montrone, a senior vice

president and chief financial of
ficer, says the company began is
suing the supplemental reports
because shareholders were
complaining they couldn't un
derstand the structured reports.
