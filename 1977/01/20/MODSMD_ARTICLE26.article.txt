## Bratz breaks Maples mark Cards down Hawaii, 84-71 
### Chris Baker 
Last year the officiating got so
bad at Hawaii home basketball
games that the NCAA decided to
step in and ordered school offi
cials to bring in one official from
the mainland.
Well, Hawaii senior forward
Cavin Smith, who transferred to
Hawaii after being declared
academically ineligible at
UCLA, thought the Rainbow
Warriors were cheated out of a
victory in last night's 84-71 Stan
ford win.
"The refs cheated us," said
Smith after the game. "They bla
tantly cheated us. They were
worse than the one we have in
Hawaii. It's not sour grapes.
"In the last four minutes they
gave some crucial calls to the
other side," said Smith, who led
Hawaii with 23 points despite
fouling out.
The Cards had a 72-69 lead
with 3:55 to go in the game, but
Stanford outscored Hawaii 12-2
in the last four minutes of the
contest to hand the Rainbow
Warriors their third straight loss
in a three-game mainland road
swing.
Eight free throws
Stanford shot eight free
throws in the last four minutes of

the game and the officials called
23 fouls on Hawaii and IB on the
Cards during the game.
But the Bows should have
never even been in the contest in
the second half.
Mike Bratz scored 25 points in
the first half to set a new Maples
Pavilion scoring record for one
half. Claude Terry, now with the
Buffalo Braves, held the old
mark with a 24-point perfor
mance against California in
1970.
The Cardinals broke open an
8-8 contest, outscoring Hawaii
14-2. to take a 22-10 lead with
11:09 left in the first half. Stan
ford's largest lead was 15 points,
at 30-15 with 7:29 left in the half.
Bratz stats
Bratz was nine for 13 from the
field and seven of eight from the
line in the first half. Bratz got six
points on backdoor lay-ins, as
the Cardinals went into the
locker room with an 11-point
lead.
But Bratz finished the contest
with 25 points — getting shut
out in the second half.
"1 wasn't shooting the ball
great. I was getting a lot of easy
buckets," said Bratz of his first
half performance. "In the second
half the shots just weren't going

in. They played a different de
fense. They played man-to-man
on the guards."
Hawaii outscored the Cardi
nals 10-2 in the first minutes
of the second half to close to
within one point at 48-47.
'Concerned'
"We were concerned early in
the second half," said Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso. "Two of
their four shots were on fast
breaks. We weren't prepared for
their defense. We have never
worked against that."
Rainbow Warrior coach Larry
Little, who coached at NCAA
blacklisted Centenary College
last year, devised a good defense
at halftime. The Bows came out
in a "triangle of two" defense.
The guards used a man-to-man
and the front line played a zone.
Dißiaso said that it took "six or
seven minutes to work our way
through."
Stanford scored 10 straight
points, after being ahead by just
one at 52-5 1, to take a 62-51 lead.
Freshman forward Kimberly
Bel ton carried the load for the
Cardinals in the second half.
Belton shines
Belton scored 23 points, after a
five-point performance in the
first half. Belton made seven of

15 free throws.
"Belton picked up the slack in
the second half when they shut
off Bratz," said Dißiaso.
Hawaii, thanks to forward
John Moore, who was the Bows'
second leading scorer with 22
points, didn't fold. The Bows
closed the gap to four points —
69-65 — with 5:24 left in the
game.
