# Wilde play showcases fine Manhattan Players

### Caryn Jacobs 
What can one say about a play
in which the sole reason for love
is the name Ernest, "Bunbury
i ng " is manifest, sheer aesthetics
take precedence over sincerity,
and love triumphs? Only that it
cannot help being a thoroughly
enjoyable experience.
Last week, the Manhattan
Flayers presented an exhibition
performance of The Importance
of Being Earnest in the Tresidder
Large Lounge. First appearing in
1895, this delightful play by
Oscar Wilde is a comedy of love
in high Victorian society. It is a
very aesthetic play, gentle and
pretty to look at because of the
beautiful costumes and charac
ters. Earnest is not a high-energy
comedy; rather, one of relentless
yet never tiresome wit. The plot
is simply the process of three
love affairs; it involves the audi
ence and induces one to sigh at
its resolution. Oscar Wilde took
no moral stands in this play but
irreverently created a world
where, as Kevin Sullivan in
Oscar Wilde wrote, "wickedness
has no place and goodness is ir
relevant."
High-quality acting
An important factor in the en
joyment of any play is the quality
of the acting which, in last
week's performance, was very
high and skillfully directed by
Judith Dresch. Brian Lucas,
playing John Worthing, was per
fection as the Victorian love-sick
male. He was appropriately
pompous and outwardly virtu
ous, despite his double life. His
clipped accent, forlorn glances,
and hitting of noble poses were
well-done character traits.
Paul West, as Algernon, was
the embodiment of irreverence
and cynicism. His insults of soc
iety and ideal love soon ended
when he fell "wildly, passion
ately, devotedly, hopelessly" in
love. Althea Hern also put in a
fine performance as Gwendolen,
the high-class girl Mr. Worthing
wished to marry. She conveyed
the upper-class snobbery, prop

riety and biting jealousy of the
character excellently.
In my opinion, Leigh De
Kraker, who played Cecily,
exaggerated a bit too much the
empty-headedness of her
character. In reading the play, 1
saw Cecily as more shrewd than
dumb,yet this is strictly a matter
of interpretation. She did in
teract expertly with Gwendolen
in their first confrontation,
where they argue with and insult
each other, and in the final act,
where they call each other "sis
ter."
Most outstanding
The most outstanding perfor
mance, however, was the por
trayal of Lady Bracknell by Mar
jorie Ross, an opinion which was
evidently shared by most of the
audience. Her overbearing
character presented a powerful
and energetic presence on stage
— one appropriate to a Lady ac
customed to handing down fear
ful directives. Her social obser
vations were pricelessly accu
rate and her delivery, complete
with richly rolled "r"s, was the
embodiment of the rich Victo
rian matron.
It is difficult for me to com
ment technically on this presen
tation because the Manhattan
Players could not bring their
stage and sets to Tresidder. The
costumes were historically accu
rate and the dresses were very
striking. The blocking was a lit
tle stilted at times and there was
an occasional upstaging. These
small faults, however, could be
attributed to the small acting
platform set up in the Large
Lounge. Dresch was careful
to explain before the play started
that the real set at the playhouse
was much more professionally
and accurately equipped.
Oscar Wilde, in a letter to
Alfred Douglas, wrote about The
Importance of Being Earnest,
"My play is really very funny. I
am quite delighted with it."l can
sum up my experience with this
acting company in saying that I
was, too.
The Importance of Being Ear

nest will be playing on both Fri
day and Saturday nights at 8:30
p.m. through January at the
Manhattan Playhouse (located
on Manhattan and West
Bayshore Drive in Palo Alto).
Admission is $2.50 and $3.50
and the duration of the play is
approximately 2 x /i hours.
Dresch, director of the Man
hattan Playhouse, explained that
the Playhouse is a non-profit or
ganization created "to produce
the classics and give young ac
tors and actresses a chance to
develop their talents." She is en
thusiastic about working with
Stanford students. If there are
any students interested in this
company, one need only call
Dresch at 322-4589 to set up a
private audition.
In addition to drama, the
Playhouse also produces operas
and musicals. One of their pro
ductions, For The Love of Scan
dal, was presented on channel 9,
station KQED, last year and re
shown three times by popular
demand. Future productions,
with exact dates to be an
nounced, include Olympia's
Marriage by Emile Augier, The
Rivals by Sheridan and The Sea
gull by Chekov.
